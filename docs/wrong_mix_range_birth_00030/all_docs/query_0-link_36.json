        "text": "We‚Äôre excited to debut our Integral Partner Spotlight series ‚Äì a monthly post that highlights trusted partners playing a pivotal role in delivering meaningful results to our clients. At Integral, we believe that every project team should be a highly curated collection of expertise and perspective. This includes not only our core team members but also a wider ecosystem of service providers who bring unique intellect, innate creativity, curiosity, a collaborative spirit, and professional empathy for consumers, our clients, and fellow team members. We‚Äôre both excited and proud that this group of exceptional partners is willing to collaborate with us. It‚Äôs one of the highlights of our job ‚Äì we get to do interesting work with even more interesting people. By spotlighting them, we hope more folks can discover the value they bring to our industry. Enjoy! WHO / WHAT For our first Spotlight, we‚Äôre featuring Kirk Visola (he/him) of MIND THE FONT‚Ñ¢ (MTF). Kirk is a freelance brand identity and packaging design specialist based in beautiful and quirky Santa Cruz, California. Over the past decade, he has created strategic and effective visual identities for companies across the consumer products landscape, with a strong focus on food and beverage packaging. When he‚Äôs not solving design challenges for clients, Kirk serves as the Senior Brand Designer for the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Most notably, Kirk was our partner in creating the Integral CPG brand identity. WHY While a full agency is often the right choice for many projects, there are times when a highly skilled, nimble freelance designer is the perfect fit. That‚Äôs when we recommend Kirk and MTF. Kirk approaches design with a focus on impact, not just aesthetics. He starts by understanding the client‚Äôs goals and then crafts a strategy that leverages sound design principles, respects industry norms (and occasionally breaks them), taps into innate human behavior, and resonates with consumers. The result? Design solutions that truly drive results. Admittedly, Kirk is a strong personality ‚Äì but it‚Äôs the right kind. He embraces challenging problems and isn‚Äôt afraid to speak his mind in service of the brand. His passionate presence on LinkedIn may not always align with everyone‚Äôs views, but he‚Äôs undeniably one of the most caring, empathetic, and genuine humans out there. After all, aren‚Äôt the best arguments concluded with a bear hug and a heartfelt ‚Äúlove you, brother‚Äù? To get to know Kirk better and explore his perspective on CPG design, check out the Kirk + Kurtts Design Podcast, which he co-hosts with fellow skilled designer Andy Kurtts. In short, Kirk brings strategic skill and passion that we believe every client deserves. If you‚Äôre in need of smart, fast, on-strategy design, reach out to Kirk and discover it for yourself. And thank us later! üòä"
