        "text": "People all over America and the world are consumed with watching athletes perform in their various sports. Both male and female athletes compete at such incredible levels that require physical talent and drive. Professional athletes are known to get paid salaries that reflect their talent and abilities. Regardless of gender, professional athletes are drafted to receive professional pay. However, equal pay for male and female athletes with the same credentials does not occur today. There is a belief that male athletes are worth more than female athletes and are better at promoting themselves. Also, women salaries are lower because of their gender and are not\n\nLopiano complains that there’s too much of a salaries gap between man and women playing the same sports. “The right to play has been established. However, the issue that has been confronted is the barrier to being treated equally when it comes to money” (Lopiano 1). Most people will say women’s tennis matches are more exciting than men’s matches; men’s victory purses are still considerably higher than women’s victory purses. Top women tennis players earned 59 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. The average total purse was $63,031,000.00 for top men players and $41,000,000.00 for top women players (Daniel Frankl 2). In soccer, the Women’s World Cup soccer team was promised $12,500 if they won compared to the $300,000 male players were to receive. The payout for women players was increased to $50,000 because fans protested the unfair payout gap between the male and female players (Lopiano 1); it’s still 1/6 the payout\n\nMany women professional basketball players work hard, are dedicated, and have a genuine love for the game; however, many of them are very underpaid when compared to the men professional basketball players. The difference between what men and women are paid for the same job is referred to as the gender wage gap. In the United States that gap is 78 cents, so a woman is paid 78 cents for every dollar paid to a man doing the same work. Lynx player Maya Moore said, \"We’re not super rich like the guys … but money’s not everything when you’re talking about dynasties and legacies, and inspiring young women and men, and opening people’s minds.\" Obviously, they do not play for the money, they play because they love the game of basketball. The women basketball players work really hard and inspire more people everyday. They should be awarded and paid the equal amount just as any male basketball player.\n\nVanessa Williams is a sixty three year old female of African Canadian descent. Pre-existing medical conditions include, rheumatoid arthritis and gestational diabetes. Surgical history consists of a cesarian section during the birth of her first child in 1986 as well as a knee arthroscopy after fracturing it during a biking accident in 2000. There is no history of blood transfusion and any other comorbidity.\n\nSerena and Venus Williams are both sisters and professional athletes who are competing to be the best in tennis. Serena Williams was born September 26, 1981 in Saginaw, Michigan she stared playing tennis in California at age five; Serena was home-schooled and coached by her parents. Serena and her family then moved from Compton to West Palm Beach when she was nine, she then attended rick macci’s academy, Serena later began playing professionally in September 1995 at age 15. Serena is a baseline player she takes immediate control of using a powerful serve and return with forceful groundstrokes. Serena serves can be up to 128mph. Serena has been in 21 grand slams single finals winning 17 titles, she has been in 13 grand slams double finals, winning them all. Serena partner with Sister Venus these scenarios, she’s been four grand slam mixed double finals winning two and coming runner-up two.\n\nAccording to Forbes list of top 100 athletes, Serena Williams made $27 million in 2017. Her salary and prize winnings added up to $8 million while her endorsements added up to $19 million. Her endorsement includes Intel, the company that creates computer processors; Tempur Pedic , the mattress creator that claims they are Serena’s secret weapon …I guess she gets a good night’s sleep; Audemars Piguet, a high end sports watch that you often find Serena wearing during her tennis matches; Beats by Dr. Dre, which you’ll frequently see headphones dangling around Serena’s neck as she walks into her matches; Berlei, a women’s lingerie brand that sells sports bras and I doubt if she could play without one; Gatorade, a sport drinks; JP Morgan Chase\n\nSerena Williams, despite being an all-star tennis player is continually defined by the media, not by her talent but rather her marketability as a black athlete. The media continues to define her in ways they feel society should place a person of color that has reached success, and that place is the “model\" person of color. When a person of color reaches success, the media attempts to define them as model persons of color (who people of color should aspire to be), so they can mold them into a place that ultimately fits the white imagination. The white imagination is defined in The Meaning of Serena Williams as “who is worthy, who is desirable, and who is associated with the good life,\" aka factors that the media ultimately would deem marketable.\n\nWomen’s equality is an issue that has been around for awhile. While women have been given many rights to increase equality, including the right to vote and go to college, the problem hasn’t completely vanished. One area that still sees this is in sports. Women’s sports do not draw nearly as many fans and are not covered in the media as much as men’s sports, pay differences between male and female athletes are large, and female athletes have to wait longer to start their professional career than men, which risks their professional career before it even starts.\n\nSerena Williams is a name that almost everyone recognises. No wonder! As she is the fiery, talented and competitive girl that transformed into one of the best, if not the best, women’s tennis player ever. Her level of competitiveness is extraordinary and the determination we all see on her face as she ace’s her next opponent is scary. We don’t only love Serena because of her tennis skill, she is down to earth as well. I think she is someone who makes people watching tennis stay on the edge of their seat.\n\nSerena Williams is one of the most successful tennis players in the history of sports. Williams is known for her undeniable dedication and ability to burn the candle on both ends. The worldwide sensation won several Olympic Gold medals and many other awards. However, there is much more that you probably did not know about this incredible athlete. In this post, we've compiled the first part of 25 amazing facts about Serena Williams.\n\nBefore Serena Williams and her sister Venus Williams were double partners entering the game, women’s tennis had an unique monolithic leading image; thin white women with straight ponytails prancing up and down. As mundane as it sounds, it was to watch. Then two young black female teenagers with beaded braids from Compton, California dominant the scene both physically and visibly. Paul Cohen, was the girls first professional tennis coach is quoted saying “I wanted to train attack dogs that would intimated anyone on the other side of the net.” He would go on to excitingly explain that he had never seen a six year old as strong as Serena, while describing Venus as athletically graceful in the same breath.\n\nGeisha Williams was the first Latina CEO of a fortune 500 company. When Geisha was five years old her father was released from prison in Cuba. Not able to start a new life, she and her parents fled Cuba and took asylum in Union City, New Jersey. Her parents worked very hard to give Geisha a good life. Geisha would often ask her parents the reason they left Cuba. They would always say “Geisha, we did it for you. We knew you couldn’t lead the kind of life you deserved in that country,”. When she was in grade school her father worked two jobs, employment at a factory, and scrubbing dishes in an restaurant. Eventually her parents saved up enough money to open their own grocery store. Everyday after school Geisha would go to the grocery store and\n\nThat same year, Roger Federer won the men’s championship game against American Andy Roddick in straight sets, collecting $1.13 million in prize money. But, his female counterpart, Williams won only $1.08 million. After Venus speech at the All England Club, the women’s championship prize money was increased, according to ESPN W, but still did not match the men’s award. A question was asked in the year 2006 of why the pay gap persisted in the face of increasing criticism, the club chairman , Tim Phillips, justified the prize discrepancy saying the physical demands of the men’s best of five matches are much higher than those of the women’s best of three. The club didn’t view the prize as an “equal rights issue”. The top ten ladies last year earned more from Wimbledon than the top 10 men did by playing in the double tournaments. Venus is a superior athlete, a legend but she is also an activist who revolutionized her sport off the court with her fight for prize equality. People thought this story shouldn’t be regulated to dusty history books and British newspapers. People in the United States should know of her true professional bravery and personal tenacity in making sure women athletes are regarded and rewarded on par with their male counterparts. This was Williams’s mission."
