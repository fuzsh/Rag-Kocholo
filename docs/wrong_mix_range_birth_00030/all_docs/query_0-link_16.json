BTW Someone out there is getting some super soldier milk.”\n\nRelated: Serena Williams Through the Years: From Tennis Court to Met Gala Red Carpet\n\nLegend! Serena Williams has overcome every obstacle in her way to become one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Perhaps even more impressive, she now balances perfecting her game with raising her daughter, Olympia. Williams was born in Saginaw, Michigan, in September 1981. She started playing tennis at age 4 after she, sister […]\n\nInstagram users were quick to chime in and joke about the athlete’s breast milk, writing in the comments section, “That’s G.O.A.T. Milk!” and “Some kids backhand just got stronger.”\n\nWilliams and husband Alexis Ohanian welcomed daughter Adira in August. The couple also share daughter Olympia, now 6.\n\nWilliams recently shared that she has found alternative ways to utilize her breast milk.\n\n“Ok is this totally weird???” she captioned a TikTok video earlier this month. “I have to say after a week of using MY breast milk under my eye — it worked! I’m dying to hear your thoughts. Be nice lol.”\n\nRelated: Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian's Fairy Tale Romance: A Timeline\n\nServing up romance!

Long story. Anyway, I’m trying some breast milk.”\n\nWilliams proceeded to pour her breast milk on a cloth and dab it under her eye, noting that the method “works for my kid.”\n\n“They say put breast milk on everything, and I have a lot extra so I’m gonna try it for a week or so under my eye and see how it goes,” she said, adding that “it already feels better because, like, it hurts.”\n\nRelated: Which Celebs Have Married or Dated Pro Tennis Players?

The two women, however, are both still some of […]\n\nAdapting to life as the mother of two has come with a few challenges. Last month, Williams candidly shared her struggles, adding that it’s “OK to not be OK.”\n\n“No one is OK every single day,” she wrote via X (formerly Twitter). “If you are not OK today I’m with you. There’s always tomorrow. Love you.”\n\nWilliams went on to share a selfie while snuggling with her youngest daughter in a subsequent post. “This makes me so happy,” she wrote via X."
