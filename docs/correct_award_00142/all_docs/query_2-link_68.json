        "text": "Jose Saramago was a citizen of Portugal who wrote more than 20 books during his lifetime. His remarkable career was capped by his winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998, a dozen years before his death at age 87.\n\nThankfully, he left behind a body of work whose themes address the most basic questions about human nature. They center around how do humans behave when faced with extraordinary, even surreal, circumstances.\n\nIn “Death With Interruptions” (2005), he explores what happens when people achieve immortality — i.e., what happens when residents of an unamed, landlocked country no longer die? In “The Double” (2002), he puts us in the place of a divorced, depressed teacher who sees himself, his literal double, in a random movie on video. To what lengths is this ordinary man willing to go to track down and confront his doppelganger?\n\nIn “Blindness,” the book I’ve just finished, Saramago takes things to another level.\n\nWhat happens when, one by one, the entire population of a city loses the ability to see? After the momentary panic, would they try to help each other by organizing, choosing leaders, and cooperating to access water, food and other essentials? Or would they fall into an everyone-for-themselves mode, where selfishness and greed prove stronger than any desire to put the good of the whole above the needs and wants of the individual?\n\nIn short, “Blindness” is a novel that explores human nature in the face of societal collapse. Published in 1995, it is a dystopian tale with lessons for our modern selves. Read about this fictional pandemic of “white blindness” and you cannot help but draw parallels between the ways the victims of that scenario behaved and the ways we Americans responded to the earliest days of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago, you’ll remember, that our world seemed to shut down all at once, because of a lethal, deadly virus.\n\nDoctors, nurses, EMTs and others responded with selfless sacrifice, working themselves to the point of exhaustion even as they exposed themselves to higher risk being around those already infected.\n\nYet, even as hundreds of thousands of Americans died (and continue to do so) because of the coronavirus, huge numbers of people denied the public health threat and did little or nothing to protect themselves and others. Recall, too, that hucksters were trying to stock up on hand sanitizer and resell them at exorbitant prices while shoppers scooped up as much toilet paper as they could buy in a single trip to the grocery store.\n\n***\n\nIn “Blindness,” Saramago spins a captivating tale that forces us to look at ourselves, consider the ethics of our choices, and the ramifications of our behavior if we were dropped into a similar situation.\n\nThe story begins with a man idling in his car at a stoplight in everyday traffic, nothing out of the ordinary. The light changes but he stays in place. As cars back up and horns honk, another man comes to his aid. “I am blind” the stricken man says in utter disbelief. “I am blind.”\n\nThe Good Samaritan helps move his car out of traffic, then offers to drive him home where he can wait for his wife. While he waits, the suddenly sightless man knocks over a vase, then cuts his hand as he tries to pick up the broken pieces of glass. When his wife arrives home, knowing nothing of what has transpired, she wonders why her despondent husband is lying down on the couch with a bloody rag around his hand.\n\nShe rushes him to an opthalmologist, who examines him thoroughly and finds nothing wrong, but is dumbstruck by the man’s condition — his world isn’t dark; it’s totally white and he cannot see a thing.\n\nJump ahead quickly to two plot points. First, the would-be Good Samaritan turns out to be a car thief. He’s decided that because the blind motorist was helpless to stop him, all he needed to do was pocket the keys and drive off in the car.\n\nSecond, soon after the blind motorist cut ahead of everyone in line at the doctor’s office, every person in the waiting room falls victim to the white blindness, including the opthalmologist.\n\nInexorably, the pandemic sweeps across the city and nation, causing the government to act swiftly to protect the citizenry. No social distancing and masks here. Instead, the government quickly rounds up those who have gone blind and quarantines them in a long-abandoned mental hospital, with limited supplies of water, soap, paper towels and toilet paper, and not a shred of compassion.\n\nThey are told they will stay there indefinitely, under the watch of armed soldiers, and receive no visitors. They are promised three meals a day, which gradually become one, and then less than that. They are told that if anyone falls ill, there will be no medicine. If anyone dies, it will be their responsibility to bury the corpse. Never mind that there are no shovels.\n\nYou might imagine where this goes. Unable to see, unable to find their way to the toilet in time, people cannot control their bowels well enough to prevent accidents in the bathrooms and corridors. Some try to relieve themselves in the courtyard, thinking no one will know who they are. But when they begin to despair, they lose their dignity, and the piles of excrement and pools of urine become part of everyday life. Raunchy body odor and urine-stained mattresses add to the awful smell.\n\nAnd how do these men and women react to their new normal?\n\nThe opthalmologist appeals to reason. He is confined with all of his patients from the waiting room — an older man with an eyepatch, a young woman with dark glasses, an adolescent boy, and the motorist — plus three more persons: the motorist’s wife, the doctor’s own wife, and the car thief, after he too goes blind and gets arrested.\n\nOnly the wife of the opthalmologist is still able to see. She’s there in the mental hospital because she had the presence of mind to stay with her husband, rather than allow herself to be separated. Throughout the novel, she alone retains her eyesight and, therefore, is able to play a critical role as observer and tactician as the struggle to survive becomes more acute.\n\nOut of necessity, the band of strangers decide to cooperate, first in choosing which beds they will occupy and then holding onto a rope together as they make their way to the bathroom and back. As daily rations dwindle, they divide their portions or forgo them entirely to make sure the boy, who is confined without a parent, gets fed first.\n\nOther prisoners (what else would you call them?) take a different path. A criminal element emerges and rallies around a leader who threatens violence in order to scoop up more shares of the rationed food. Not only do he and his followers hoard the food, but they blackmail the others into giving up all their valuables — jewelry, money, watches — in exchange for food. Never mind that they can’t spend the money anywhere or pawn the rings and necklaces.\n\nOnce all the valuables have been gathered, another thought comes to the criminal gang: if any of you want to eat, give up your women.\n\nThe most brutal scenes in the book follow, raising ethical questions for all involved.\n\nWhat are you willing to do to stay alive? What are you willing to sacrifice for others? Would you submit to sexual abuse to ensure that others could eat? Could you, would you kill someone who assaulted you?\n\nAnd for the crooks: How do you justify taking advantage of others when all of you are suffering? Have you no decency?\n\n***\n\nLeap ahead once more (spoiler alert here). I won’t explain how, but the inmates eventually escape, only to confront a new challenge. How do they survive in a seemingly lifeless city, where the streets are cluttered with abandoned vehicles, grocery stores have been emptied, and water is in short supply? The city has turned into a ghost town, with rotting corpses, packs of roaming dogs, and darkened houses.\n\nHow do you find the place you once called home? Even if you can, what are you likely to find there? Squatters? Filth? Mold? Where will you find edible food? And again, is it better to go off on your own or stay together with your band of fellow sufferers?\n\nGiven all this dark material, you might think this book is a complete downer. But you’d be wrong.\n\nEven at the lowest points in this narrative, people’s concern for one another spurs compassion and sacrifice. Small gestures of kindness and bold acts of bravery keep the human connection alive and give hope to the reader that maybe, just maybe, our best selves might prevail in the chaos of a societal breakdown.\n\nMost touching of all is a scene where the handful of survivors have miraculously found a safe house where, thanks to the still-seeing doctor’s wife, they can wash themselves off after months of wearing the same, sweaty, stinky rags that pass for clothes. The man with the eyepatch, the oldest one of the group, is alone in the bathtub trying to wash the grime from his skin when he feels a pair of hands on his back.\n\nSilently, the hands gently massage and clean him. The mystery person does not identify herself, but the man deduces it can only be one of three people — the doctor’s wife, the wife of the blind motorist, or the girl with dark glasses. Alone again in the tub, he trembles, moved nearly to tears by the act of kindness.\n\nLike the other two Saramago books I’ve read, “Blindness” is an absorbing story, a parable that we would do well to consider as we face a future of intensifying climate change, a possible recession and political upheaval. What will we do collectively and individually if the worst comes to pass? Will we band together for the common good or strive to get what we can for ourselves? Will we find purpose in unity or in selfishness?\n\nWhat, if anything, are we willing to do to help our fellow man?\n\nNotes: Saramago is known for writing really long sentences with minimal punctuation and no quotes to set off spoken language from narrative. A single paragraph can go on for pages. It’s confusing at times but, oh, so worth it. Also, “Blindness” was made into a movie starring Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore as the doctor and his wife. The novel was followed by a sequel titled “Seeing” (2004)."
