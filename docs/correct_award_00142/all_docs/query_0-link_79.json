        "text": "In 1970, I visited Stockholm with my mother during our mother-daughter trip around Europe. I was fourteen years old, and that trip set me up for a lifelong love of travel and the arts. One of my most treasured memories was touring the Stockholm City Hall and seeing the venues where the Nobel Prizes are awarded every December 10th.\n\nI remember standing in front of the magnificent Golden Hall (see the picture with this blog) and dreaming of one day returning—maybe as a winner myself! I know that’s not going to happen, but I did eventually fulfill my dream of becoming a novelist.\n\nAccording to the very informative Nobel Prize website, the Nobel Prize for Literature is awarded to the person in the literary field who has produced “the most outstanding work in an ideal direction”. Since 1900, the prize has been awarded to 114 authors.\n\nBoth the 2019 and the 2018 Nobel Prizes for Literature were announced on October 10, 2019. On Art In Fiction, you’ll find novels by six Nobel Laureates: Kazuo Ishiguro (2017), Mario Vargas Llosa (2010), Orhan Pamuk (2006), José Saramago (1998), Toni Morrison (1993), and William Golding (1983).\n\nSet in post-war Japan, An Artist of the Floating World by Kazuo Ishiguro tells the story of how a bohemian artist who became a propagandist for Japanese Imperialism during World War II struggles to reconcile past and present.\n\nMario Vargas Llosa’s novel, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, takes us to Peru for a “bedazzlement of entertainment”, according to Time Magazine.\n\nFrom Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk comes My Name Is Red, described as a fiendishly devious mystery, a beguiling love story, and a brilliant symposium on the power of art.\n\nPortuguese novelist José Saramago’s novel, The Cave, tells the story of an elderly potter on the verge of losing his livelihood. According to the Washington Post Book World: “[The Cave] is yet another triumph . . . for Portugal's, or even the world's, greatest living novelist. Read it”.\n\nFrom Toni Morrison, who passed in August 2019, comes Jazz, a novel considered experimental as a result of its incorporation of the complex elements of jazz music into the narrative structure.\n\nFinally, The Spire by William Golding, author of the seminal Lord of the Flies, tells the story of a bishop obsessed with adding a taller tower to his cathedral.\n\nAn Artist of the Floating World by Kazuo Ishiguro\n\nMasuji Ono saw misery in his homeland and became unwilling to spend his skills solely in the celebration of physical beauty. Instead, he envisioned a strong and powerful nation of the future, and he put his painting to work in the service of the movement that led Japan into World War II. Now, as the mature Masuji Ono struggles through the spiritual wreckage of that war, his memories of the “floating world” of his youth, full of pleasure and promise, serve as an escape from, a punishment for—and a justification of—his entire life.\n\nDrifting without honor in Japan’s post-war society which indicts him for its defeat and reviles him for his aesthetics, he relives the passage through his personal history that makes him both a hero and a coward but, above all, a human being.\n\nBuy Now from Amazon\n\nBuy Now from Bookshop\n\nAunt Julia and the Scriptwriterby Mario Vargas Llosa\n\nMario Vargas Llosa's brilliant, multi-layered novel is set in the Lima, Peru of the author's youth, where a young student named Marito is toiling away in the news department of a local radio station. His young life is disrupted by two arrivals.\n\nThe first is his Aunt Julia, recently divorced and thirteen years older, with whom he begins a secret affair. The second is a manic radio script writer named Pedro Camacho, whose racy, vituperative soap operas are holding the city's listeners in thrall. Pedro chooses young Marito to be his confidant as he slowly goes insane.\n\nInterweaving the story of Marito's life with the ever-more-fevered tales of Pedro Camacho, Vargas Llosa's novel is hilarious, mischievous, and masterful, a classic named one of the best books of the year by The New York Times Book Review.\n\nBuy Now from Amazon\n\nBuy Now from Bookshop\n\nMy Name Is Red by Orhan Pamuk\n\nThe Sultan has commissioned a cadre of the most acclaimed artists in the land to create a great book celebrating the glories of his realm. Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style.\n\nBut because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition. Therefore, the ruling elite mustn’t know the full scope or nature of the project, and panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears. The only clue to the mystery – or crime? – lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves.\n\nBuy Now from Amazon\n\nBuy Now from Bookshop\n\nThe Caveby José Saramago\n\nCipriano Algor, an elderly potter, lives with his daughter Marta and her husband Marcal in a small village on the outskirts of The Center, an imposing complex of shops, apartments, and offices to which Cipriano delivers his pots and jugs every month.\n\nOn one such trip, he is told not to make any more deliveries. Unwilling to give up his craft, Cipriano tries his hand at making ceramic dolls. Astonishingly, The Center places an order for hundreds, and Cipriano and Marta set to work - until the order is cancelled and the three must move from the village into The Center.\n\nWhen mysterious sounds of digging emerge from beneath their apartment, Cipriano and Marcal investigate, and what they find transforms the family's life. Filled with the depth, humor, and the extraordinary philosophical richness that marks each of Saramago's novels, The Cave is one of the essential books of our time.\n\nBuy Now from Amazon\n\nBuy Now from Bookshop\n\nJazzby Toni Morrison\n\nIn the winter of 1926, when everybody everywhere sees nothing but good things ahead, Joe Trace, middle-aged door-to-door salesman of Cleopatra beauty products, shoots his teenage lover to death. At the funeral, Joe’s wife, Violet, attacks the girl’s corpse. This passionate, profound story of love and obsession brings us back and forth in time as a narrative is assembled from the emotions, hopes, fears, and deep realities of black urban life.\n\nBuy Now from Amazon\n\nBuy Now from Bookshop\n\nThe Spireby William Golding\n\nDean Jocelin has a vision: that God has chosen him to erect a great spire on his cathedral. His mason anxiously advises against it, for the old cathedral was built without foundations. Nevertheless, the spire rises octagon upon octagon, pinnacle by pinnacle, until the stone pillars shriek and the ground beneath it swims. Its shadow falls ever darker on the world below and on Dean Jocelin in particular.\n\nBuy Now from Amazon\n\nBuy Now from Bookshop\n\nThis website contains affiliate links.
