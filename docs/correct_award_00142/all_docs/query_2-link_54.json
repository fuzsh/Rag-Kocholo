        "text": "DARTMOUTH – If Portuguese writer and Nobel Prize laureate José Saramago were alive, he would have turned 100 on Nov. 16.\n\nTo honor the centenary of his birth, UMass Dartmouth will be hosting a two-day colloquium dedicated to exploring his work and legacy, and reminiscing about his visits to the university.\n\nTitled “Saramago at 100: Bodies and Materialities,” the event will gather scholars from both sides of the Atlantic on Dec. 2 and 3 at the New Bedford Whaling Museum and UMass Dartmouth’s main campus, respectively. They will be joined by Saramago’s widow Pilar Del Río, a journalist, novelist, translator and president of the José Saramago Foundation.\n\n“In this year of José Saramago’s centenary, many universities and cultural institutions worldwide have celebrated the life and work of the first, and to date only, Portuguese-language writer to have been received the Nobel Prize. UMass Dartmouth, which awarded Saramago an honorary degree and hosted him repeatedly as a cherished guest, will be among the last but surely not least to commemorate his legacy,” said Dr. Anna M. Klobucka, a professor of Portuguese at UMass Dartmouth, who is co-organizing the colloquium with Dr. Kathryn Bishop-Sanchez, a professor of Portuguese and Brazilian studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\nSaramago received the 1998 Nobel Prize in Literature for his “parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony [with which he] continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality,” according to the Nobel Foundation.\n\nBefore passing away in 2010, he penned numerous books, including the bestselling Blindness, The Cave and All the Names. His work has been translated into more than 40 languages.\n\nAt the colloquium, Portuguese and U.S. scholars will present new readings of his works and assessments of his legacy.\n\n“José Saramago has described novel writing as a process that is simultaneously linear and labyrinthine, allowing for straightforward chronological and causal progression, while also engendering, at the same time and in the same textual space, ‘a kind of internal vortex’ where the forces of illusion, contradiction and ambiguity thrive in glorious and productive tension,” pointed out Dr. Klobucka.\n\nIn fact, readers tend to return and consider the philosophical and ethical issues associated with his writings.\n\n“Saramago is the master of many worlds,” noted Dr. Klobucka, who met the Nobel laureate in the early 2000s and before that edited and prefaced an issue of Portuguese Literary and Cultural Studies dedicated to the Portuguese writer.\n\n“Through all of these worlds we, his readers, let ourselves be guided by the unmistakable, seductive cadences of his consummate storyteller’s voice,” she added. “And if there is one thing that we wish for as we read, it is that Saramago’s labyrinth should never end, and that we might remain reading for as long as he lets us accompany him.”\n\nThe colloquium will include a roundtable reminiscing on the writer’s several visits to UMass Dartmouth. There will also be a screening of the 2010 documentary José and Pilar, which chronicles the life of Saramago and his wife of more than 20 years, offering a glimpse into his personal life, independent thinking and cognizance of world affairs. It will be followed by a conversation with Pilar del Río, who happened to translate more than 10 of his works into Spanish, her native language.\n\nThe colloquium is being sponsored by the Center for Portuguese Studies and Culture at UMass Dartmouth, the Luso-American Foundation, and the José Saramago Foundation. The event is free and open to the public.\n\nFor more information and the complete program, visit https://www.umassd.edu/portuguese-studies-center/events/colloquium-saramago-at-100-bodies-and-materialities.html\n\n‘A man of great heart, with a profound understanding of and empathy for the human condition’\n\nSaramago was born in Azinhaga, Ribatejo, to a family from very humble beginnings. He became a full-time writer in his fifties, after holding a series of jobs, including metalworker, mechanic and journalist.\n\nAn atheist and Portuguese Communist Party sympathizer, he periodically received criticism for his opinions. He sharply criticized any form of imposing political or economic power and was not reluctant to express his thoughts on world events, especially his indignation against the human rights and humanitarian situation in Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\n“Saramago’s capacity for sympathy, his ability to immediately connect to the most humble or educated audience revealed a man of great heart, with a profound understanding of and empathy for the human condition,” said Dr. Frank Sousa, a professor of Portuguese and director of the Saab Center for Portuguese Studies at UMass Lowell, who will be taking part in the roundtable discussion titled “Saramago in New England.”\n\nProf. Sousa, who was the founding director of the Center for Portuguese Studies and Culture at UMass Dartmouth, welcomed Saramago to the university on three occasions. The writer first visited the Dartmouth campus in 1995 and returned four years later to receive his first honorary doctorate in North America.\n\n“In early 1999, when I wrote to Saramago to invite him to receive an honorary doctorate at UMD that fall, I insisted that his visit would remind people in the region that Portuguese literature and culture was worthy of the Nobel Prize, and that many people in the region would feel a great pride in his international success,” Prof. Sousa said. “In addition, such a visit would be a boost to the forthcoming proposal to develop a separate Department of Portuguese at the university. He replied humbly that he would be happy to help in any way possible with all things Portuguese at the university and in the region.”\n\nDuring his address at the Honoris Causa Ceremony, Saramago said he would like to be seen, “above all, as a Portuguese who came to be with other Portuguese, as someone born and raised on the other side of the ocean, and as one whom life’s circumstances taught to cultivate with love and respect the full harvest of the Portuguese language.”\n\n“I would like to be seen as someone who in time developed into a writer, one who, in turn, with the help of both the knowledge and the will he had acquired, ended up by returning to the earth itself the handful of kernels that he had collected from life, with the idea that the renewal of the harvest can take place only through the rejuvenation of different generations and their experiences, as well as the lively clash between the works of yesterday and the works of today. It is from the same tree that dropped its leaves that the new buds grow,” Saramago said.\n\nThree years later, he returned to UMass Dartmouth to introduce literary critic and author Harold Bloom for an honorary degree.\n\n“His visit to UMass Dartmouth in 2002 was particularly memorable for the ethnic pride he elicited from colleagues whose last names had not given, over the years, any indication that they were of a Portuguese background,” said Prof. Sousa, giving as an example a professor in the English Department whom he had known for years but had no idea he was Portuguese-American.\n\n“All of the sudden, he was thrilled to acknowledge his Portuguese origins,” Prof. Sousa recalled. “He happily informed me that his first language as a child had been Portuguese, because he had in good measure been raised in Fall River by his Azorean grandmother, and that he still spoke Portuguese.”\n\nOn the same day, a professor of Psychology, with a most Irish name, also shared with Prof. Sousa the pride he felt during Saramago’s visit to the campus.\n\n“I looked at him surprised by the unexpected revelation and asked him why he felt this way,” Prof. Sousa said. “His mother was of Portuguese ancestry and he had been stationed at the Lajes Air Force base for two years as an American serviceman many years earlier, where he had learned some Portuguese.”\n\nDuring this visit, Saramago also participated in a conference dedicated to authors from the Portuguese-speaking world held at the John F. Kennedy Library, which was organized by the Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities (now Mass Humanities) and the Center for Portuguese Studies and Culture.\n\n“The very large Smith Hall at the library was full to capacity, and Saramago’s participation, in a conversation setting with Ilan Stavans, well-known author and the Lewis-Sebring Professor of Humanities and Latin American and Latino Culture at Amherst College, was unforgettable for his polemical, staunch, defense of the Palestinians and for the wonderful reception that closed the day-long event,” recalled Prof. Sousa.\n\nSaramago also gave a lecture on immigration and the immigrant experience at a packed Casa da Saudade Library in the South End of New Bedford.\n\n“The response from the audience to his brilliant, impromptu, speech was something to behold, an outpouring of love - hugs upon hugs of Saramago - that I remember vividly to this day,” concluded Prof. Sousa.\n\nLurdes C. da Silva may be reached at ldasilva@ojornal.com.
