        "text": "‘The Notebook of the Year of the Nobel’ was the last unpublished journal of the deceased Jose Saramago, a ‘special’ book that collects his thoughts and daily life of the Portuguese writer who, according to his widow Pilar del Rio, didn’t change after achieving the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998.\n\nRELATED:\n\n'Free Speech' to Blame for Slain Journalists: Nobel Laureate\n\nThis was the last of his personal journals, in which he spoke about the “ideas, events and also emotions” he went through in 1998, the year he was awarded with the prestigious prize. He had previously announced its publication in the epilogue of the last number of ‘Los Cuadernos de Lanzarote’ (Lanzarote’s Notebooks), but it was delayed and later forgotten as he changed his computer.\n\nThe journal’s entries start on January 1 and end with two already in January 1999. The last one describes Saramago shopping when he finds someone who can’t believe a Nobel Prize laureate is buying socks by himself, as any mortal would do, without secretaries or bodyguards.\n\nDel Rio says she still gets “goosebumps” when she remembers when by chance she found the sixth notebook of Saramago’s journals forgotten in his old computer. A “moving, lucid and intelligent,” text published in its original Portuguese and the Spanish translation at the same time. The book is divided into two parts and the prologue was written by the widow herself, who is also the president of the Jose Saramago Foundation.\n\nWorried of corruption, the decadence of European institutions, the situation of the unprivileged, Saramago also writes about his relationship with literature and the letters from his readers, showing a “visionary” Saramago “apparently speaking for the present,” according to Pilar Reyes, editor of the Alfaguara publishing house.\n\n“Saramago is playing with us because there couldn’t be a best way to celebrate the 20 years of his Nobel than finding out how he lived in 1998,” said Reyes.\n\nThe journal raises issues that we’re still dealing with today, says del Rio: “Are we building a more humane society? do we all fit? if we all don’t fit, why does the left exists?”\n\nSaramago was born as Jose de Sousa on November 16, 1922, to a humble family in Azinhaga, north of Lisbon. The economic situation of his family made him earn his living in a wide variety of professions, preventing him from earning a university degree.\n\nAmong other professions, he worked in an auto repair shop, as secretary, as a journalist and a sales agent. He published his first book, ‘Land of Sin,’ in his early twenties without much success. His second novel, ‘Skylight,’ was discarded by a publishing house and Saramago lost his writing impulse for about 20 years.\n\n“I simply didn’t have anything to say, and when you don’t have something to say the best thing is to remain silent,” as Saramago used to say.\n\nBeing awarded with the Nobel Prize in literature increased Saramago’s popularity around the world, but that didn’t change his principles, worldview, or ideology. “He never was part of the elite, but remained among the people like us,” said Del Rio.\n\nHe died on June 18, 2010, in the Spanish island of Lanzarote. His book ‘Skylight’ was found and published two years later.\n\nIn the epilogue his previous journal, Saramago explains that his editor Amaya Elezcano asked him to write and why the fifth notebook would be the last, so he had to confess there was a sixth notebook lost in a hard drive, but that it would soon see the sunlight in Portugal."
