        "text": "The Brilliance of Jose Saramago\n\nWhen the Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998, it capped off a long and mostly non-illustrious career. Saramago left school at age 12 when his parents could no longer afford the fees, entering vocational school shortly after. His first job was as a car mechanic.\n\nSaramago didn’t begin writing until his twenties, and even then, only published one novel, in 1947. He then turned to journalism and poetry. The world beyond Portugal didn’t discover his work until the international publication of Baltasar and Blimunda in 1982. Saramago was 60 years old.\n\nSaramago’s most well-known work is Blindness (1997) although he certainly achieved infamy with his 1993 book, The Gospel According to Jesus Christ. His country’s government censored Saramago’s controversial retelling of biblical stories, which caused him to live in self-imposed exile in the Canary Islands for the rest of his life.\n\nIn retrospect, Saramago winning the Nobel doesn’t surprise us. Yet at the time, Saramago’s unique literary style—sentences that run for pages, separated only by occasional periods and commas—took time for readers to wrap their heads around.\n\nUpon finding his voice Saramago never wavered. After publishing a few poetry books in the seventies, he turned to novel writing for the rest of his life, refusing to be silenced—or to appeal to market forces to find his voice.\n\nFinding His Voice\n\nIn his acceptance speech in Stockholm, Saramago reveals the importance of the characters in his novels to his personal life.\n\nI have been successively implanting in the man I was the characters I created. I believe that without them I wouldn’t be the person I am today; without them, maybe my life wouldn’t have succeeded in becoming more than an inexact sketch, a promise that like so many others remained only a promise, the existence of someone who maybe might have been but in the end could not manage to be.\n\nSaramago’s vast imagination comes through in his politically-driven and emotionally-startling works. The themes spring forward from a creative mind, yet he still pulled you, the reader, into his world regardless of where you reside.\n\nAmong the innovative themes in his books:\n\nBlindness: A mass epidemic of blindness results in social breakdown; a small group unites behind one woman who has somehow escaped the mass pandemic.\n\nDeath With Interruptions: Everyone in an unnamed and landlocked country wakes up to discover no one will die any longer, a phenomenon that threatens religious authority.\n\nSeeing: In this follow-up to Blindness, 83% of the population casts blank ballots during a parliamentary election, sending the government into disarray.\n\nThe Stone Raft: The landmass shared by Portugal and Spain, the Iberian peninsula, breaks off from the rest of Europe and floats into the Atlantic Ocean, forcing these two countries to come to terms with their new fate."
