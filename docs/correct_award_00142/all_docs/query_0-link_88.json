It is nearly 300 years since he wrote his celebrated Persian Letters and we still have not managed to find an intelligent answer to this most fundamental question in the long history of human relations. We fail to understand how anybody could have been “Persian” then, and, as if that were not absurd enough, could still obstinately persist in being “Persian” now, when the whole world is conspiring to persuade us that the only truly desirable thing in life is to be what we like to call “Western” - a general and deceptively handy term (Western values, fashions, tastes, habits, interests, enthusiasms, ideas).

The mere existence of “Persians” has been enough to upset, confuse, disorganise and generally throw a spanner in the works of our institutions. “Persians” may even go to the intolerable lengths of disturbing the very thing all governments hold most dear - their sovereign right to rule in peace. The Indians in Brazil (where being landless is another way of being “Persian”) were and still are Persians; the Indians in the United States were but have now almost ceased to be Persians; the Incas, Mayas, Aztecs were Persians in their day and so were and are their descendants, wherever they may be. There are Persians in Guatemala, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and the unhappy land of Mexico.\n\nThere, the relentlessly questing lens of Sebastião Salgado sought out and recorded these moving and arresting images that speak to (...)"
