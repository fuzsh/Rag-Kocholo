        "text": "- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThe Nobel Prize is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural or scientific advances.\n\nAlfred Nobel\n\nAlfred Nobel was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden. He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor. On 10 December 1896, he died (63 years) in San Remo, Italy.\n\nNobel Prize\n\nThe will of the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel established the prizes in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.\n\nThe economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel’s 1895 will.\n\nIn 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Swedish National Bank) celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a prize in honour of Nobel. The following year, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded for the first time.\n\nEach recipient, or laureate, receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money that has been decided by the Nobel Foundation. (As of 2017, each prize is worth SEK 9,000,000).\n\nMedals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold, and later from 18 carat green gold plated with a 24 carat gold coating. Between 1901 and 2016, the Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 579 times to 911 people and organisations. With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 23 organisations, and 881 individuals.\n\nThe prize is not awarded posthumously; however, if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it, the prize may still be presented. A prize may not be shared among more than three people, although the Nobel Peace Prize can be awarded to organizations of more than three people.\n\nNobel Foundation and Nobel Laureate selection\n\nThe Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organisation on 29 June 1900. Its function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. The Foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates.\n\nA Nobel Committee is a working body responsible for most of the work involved in selecting Nobel Prize laureates. There are five Nobel Committees, one for each Nobel Prize.\n\nFour of these committees (for prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature) are working bodies within their prize awarding institutions, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, and the Swedish Academy. These four Nobel Committees only propose laureates, while the final decision is taken in a larger assembly.\n\nThis assembly is composed of the entire academies for the prizes in physics, chemistry, and literature, as well as the 50 members of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute for the prize in physiology or medicine.\n\nThe fifth Nobel Committee is the Norwegian Nobel Committee, responsible for the Nobel Peace Prize. This committee has a different status since it is both the working body and the deciding body for its prize.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates of Economic sciences.\n\nNobel's will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made \"during the preceding year\"\n\nAward ceremony\n\nExcept for the Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes (each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the King of Sweden) are presented in Stockholm, Sweden, at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The recipients' lectures (each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize) are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony.\n\nThe peace prize presented on the same day of 10th December at Oslo, the capital of Norway in the presence of the king of Norway by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\n\nMultiple laureates\n\nFour people have received two Nobel Prizes.\n\nFour of these committees (for prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature) are working bodies within their prize awarding institutions, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, and the Swedish Academy. These four Nobel Committees only propose laureates, while the final decision is taken in a larger assembly.\n\nThis assembly is composed of the entire academies for the prizes in physics, chemistry, and literature, as well as the 50 members of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute for the prize in physiology or medicine.\n\nThe fifth Nobel Committee is the Norwegian Nobel Committee, responsible for the Nobel Peace Prize. This committee has a different status since it is both the working body and the deciding body for its prize.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates of Economic sciences.\n\nNobel's will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made \"during the preceding year\"\n\nAward ceremony\n\nExcept for the Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes (each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the King of Sweden) are presented in Stockholm, Sweden, at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The recipients' lectures (each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize) are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony.\n\nThe peace prize presented on the same day of 10th December at Oslo, the capital of Norway in the presence of the king of Norway by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\n\nMultiple laureates\n\nFour people have received two Nobel Prizes.\n\nSl.
