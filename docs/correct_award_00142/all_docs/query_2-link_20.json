        "text": "On March 25 this year, after visiting the besieged Palestinian town of Ramallah, José Saramago paused to talk to journalists. He spoke in what he considered careful phrases. \"What is happening in Palestine,\" he said, \"is a crime we can put on the same plane as what happened at Auschwitz... A sense of impunity characterises the Israeli people and its army. They have turned into rentiers of the Holocaust.\" The Chief Rabbi Yisrael Lu and many Israeli officials immediately protested. Efraim Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, called the statements \"an absurd comparison, which clearly shows that excellence in literature is absolutely no guarantee of competence in history\". The Israeli novelist Amos Oz wrote \"The Israeli occupation is unjust - but to compare it to the crimes of the Nazis is like comparing Saramago to Stalin\" - a reference to the Portuguese writer's long-held communist beliefs.\n\nSix months after his visit to Ramallah, Saramago confirmed that he spoke as he intended. \"To have said that Israel's action is to be condemned, that war crimes are being perpetrated - really the Israelis are used to that. It doesn't bother them. But there are certain words they can't stand. And to say 'Auschwitz' there... note well, I didn't say that Ramallah was the same as Auschwitz, that would be stupid. What I said was that the spirit of Auschwitz was present in Ramallah. We were eight writers. They all made condemning statements, Wole Soyinka, Breyten Breytenbach, Vincenzo Consolo and others. But the Israelis weren't bothered about those. It was the fact that I put my finger in the Auschwitz wound that made them jump.\"\n\nSaramago has caused offence before, most famously with his 1991 novel The Gospel According to Jesus Christ, which tells the story of a Jesus who is the son not of God but of Joseph, and who wrestles not with Satan but with a modern power-hungry deity who commands him to be the first sacrifice in a divine plan of suffering and death. The Vatican complained and, under pressure from Catholic factions in the Portuguese government, the novel was withdrawn from competition for the European Union's Ariosto prize. (This year his books were similarly removed from Israeli bookshops and libraries.) The novelist, who 20 years previously had risked imprisonment on behalf of the Portuguese revolution, was so angry that he and his wife Pilar quit Lisbon and moved to the Spanish island of Lanzarote in the Canaries, where they now live.\n\nThe American critic Harold Bloom has called Saramago the greatest living novelist. There is a distinctive tone to his fiction, according to the British critic James Wood, \"because he narrates his novels as if he were someone both wise and ignorant\"; the award of a Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998 can be attributed to that distinctive combination, described by Wood as a \"scepticism and [a] healthy, delightfully literal approach towards the supernatural and fantastic\". For Lisa Jardine, professor of Renaissance studies at Queen Mary and Westfield College and chair of this year's Man Booker prize judges, \"Saramago's baroque imagination is his hallmark - readers have to hand themselves over to his fantasy, to be taken on a bizarre and unpredictable journey. To object is to refuse to participate in the journey.\"\n\nSaramago's novels of the 1970s and 1980s, Manual of Painting and Calligraphy, the untranslated Levantado do Ch\"o (Risen from the Earth), Baltasar and Blimunda, The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis, The Stone Raft and The History of the Siege of Lisbon were occupied with Portuguese subjects and themes, but since he moved to Lanzarote his imagination has embraced more universal concerns. His latest novel The Cave - his first to be published since he won the Nobel - confronts the globalised world; it appeared in an English translation by Margaret Jull Costa in the UK in October. It is the final book in an \"accidental trilogy\" that began with Blindness (1995), an account of events following an epidemic of blindness in an unnamed city, and All The Names (1997), in which a clerk in a registry office becomes obsessed with finding a woman whose index card he picks up by mistake.\n\nIt is difficult to find dissenters from Wood's description of Saramago as an \"attractive and sinuous\" writer, though the Irish novelist John Banville is one: \"Saramago is ... interesting, but I don't think I would put it higher than that ... [he]ventures too far into the realm of 'magic realism' for my taste. Reality itself is magical enough without inventing whimsicalities.\" In the world of reality, however - the world of political statement and headline-grabbing - Saramago has critics aplenty, ranging from the Wall Street Journal, which at the time of his Nobel Prize devoted an editorial, \"Another Nobel Laureate's Stalinist Past\", to his activity during the Portuguese revolution, to the pretender to the Portuguese throne, Dom Duarte Po, who declared that Saramago \"openly insults [our] Christian sentiments\". The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano condemned the award of the Nobel to an \"inveterate communist with anti-religious views\" - though the Dominican intellectual Brother Bento Domingues spoke out in Saramago's defence, criticising the newspaper for failing \"to evaluate a literary body of work while criticising someone for what he has every right to be - a communist\".\n\nSaramago describes his outspokenness as that of \"the simple citizen, which we all are\". He remains adamant that it is his \"prerogative to make emotional comparisons in order to shock people into understanding\": \"The world today behaves like a madhouse. The worst of it is that the values we had more or less defined, taught, learned, are thought of as archaic as well as ridiculous. Respect for the word: who is that important to? The human being should be the absolute priority. And it isn't. It's becoming less and less so. It seems that it's more important to reach Mars than prevent 13 million Africans dying of hunger. Why would I want to know if there's water on Mars if we're polluting the water here on Earth, doing nothing to avoid it? Priorities need to be redefined, but there's no chance of redefining those priorities if we don't confront the need to know what democracy is. We live in a very peculiar world. Democracy isn't discussed, as if it was taken for granted, as if democracy had taken God's place, who is also not discussed.\"\n\nSaramago, who turned 80 last month, was born in Azinhaga, an agricultural village 100km north of Lisbon in 1922. According to his childhood friend Augusto do Souto Barreiros, it was potentially very rich land, \"but only for three or four people. The community itself, especially during the winter or in extremely hot summers, starved.\" It may have been out of poverty that Saramago's father, José de Sousa, committed a petty fraud when his son was born, registering his birth date as November 18 though he had been born two days earlier, in order to escape the fine for failing to register a birth at the correct time. On his own initiative the registrar added the family nickname \"Saramago\" - the name of a wild radish - to the birth certificate. These early circumstances can be seen reflected in Saramago's tendency in his fiction to deal in the deceptive nature of official facts (All The Names) and the transforming possibilities of a tiny alteration (The History of the Siege of Lisbon).\n\nHis cousin Maria de Piedade Dami\"o describes a quiet boy, \"watching, observing everything who would have lunch or dinner always with a book by his side. Always reading. Eating and reading.\" In 1924, for obscure reasons, the family moved to Lisbon; his father got a job as a policeman, and a few months later Saramago's elder brother Francisco died. For the next decade he spent long periods back in Azinhaga with his mother's parents, Jerónimo Meirinho and Josefa Caixinha.\n\nThe writer dwelt on this relationship in his Nobel lecture. \"Many times I helped my grandfather Jerónimo in his swineherd's labour, many times I dug the land in the vegetable garden adjoining the house. Many times, in secret, dodging from the men guarding the cornfields, I went with my grandmother, also at dawn, armed with rakes, sacking and cord, to glean the stubble, the loose straw that would then serve as litter for the livestock. And sometimes, on hot summer nights, after supper, my grandfather would tell me: \"José, tonight we're going to sleep, both of us, under the fig tree.\"\n\nHis grandfather related legends, ghost stories, country episodes, old fights and deaths. \"Maybe he repeated the stories for himself, so as not to forget them, or else to enrich them with new detail. At that age and as we all do at some time, needless to say, I imagined my grandfather was master of all the knowledge in the world.\" The acute condition of Portugal's landless peasants was not improved under the dictatorship of António Salazar, who from the 1930s onwards used poverty as a deliberate tool of social control, but Saramago's cousin Maria remembers Jerónimo's and Josefa's generosity. \"Of course they said yes to everything, and got him the best food, though his grandparents' house was very poor. The roof was made of clay tiles, the walls were basically hard sand, and there was no toilet. And he was very happy.\"\n\nAfter two years at a Lisbon grammar school his parents could not afford to keep him there, and he transferred to a technical school for the next five years. Spending his evenings in the school and public libraries in Lisbon, \"reading at random, with no guidance, no one to advise me\", at 17 he made the discovery in a magazine of some poems by a Portuguese poet called Ricardo Reis - a name he didn\"t immediately recognise at the time as one of the heteronyms of the reclusive genius Fernando Pessoa. He talks about reading Reis as the beginning of his imaginative journey, though his autodidact's reading was also contributing to a Marxist analysis of his, and his country's, situation.\n\nAfter working for two years as a mechanic he obtained a civil service post, but lost his job (the first of several) for political reasons in 1949. Already, in 1947 at the age of 24, he had published a novel, Terra do Pecado (Land of Sin), but after two further efforts he abandoned all writing, remarking later that this was \"maybe one of the wisest decisions of my life. It was becoming quite clear that I had nothing worthwhile to say. For 19 years, till 1966, when I published Possible Poems, I was absent from the Portuguese literary scene, where few people can have noticed my absence.\"\n\nIn 1944, aged 21, he had married a typist named Ilda Reis, who was to become a respected engraver; his only child, Violante, was born in 1947. She now lives in Funchal, Madeira, and works as a biologist. During the 1950s and 1960s Saramago worked as a metalworker and production manager at the publishing house Estúdios Cor; he published translations of Baudelaire, Tolstoy, Hegel and others; and worked as a literary critic. His modest participation in the literary scene continued with another collection of poetry, Probably Joy, and two books of essays. His marriage lasted until 1970, the divorce roughly coinciding with the beginning of his most turbulent decade: joining the Partido Comunista Português (PCP) in 1969, Saramago threw himself into the revolutionary process, and started again as a writer. His disregard for his own safety during the struggle against the Salazar dictatorship is remembered by the Lisbon novelist Mario de Carvalho: \"I have very great admiration for those people who could lose everything and risked everything, like Saramago.\" He campaigned publicly; the novelist Hélia Correia describes him as \"a very straight man. His political convictions and ideals go on, they don't change, they don't twist. He was a communist when it was very difficult to be a communist.\"\n\nIn April 1975 he became deputy editor of the Diário de Nóticias, the government mouthpiece which had been taken over by the workers. According to the Wall Street Journal more than 20 years later, the Stalinist future Nobel laureate \"was a strident promoter of 'true socialism' against 'bourgeois democracy', overseeing the saneamento or purges of so-called fascist elements from the Portuguese media\". Twenty-two journalists were sacked, though a commentator of the period, Jo\"o Paulo Monteiro, observes that \"the Diário de Nóticias was for once ruled by its true makers. Saramago was the voice of the typographers, of the printers, of the sellers on the streets.\"\n\nSacked himself a few days after the counter-coup of November 25, and with no possibility of finding another job, Saramago \"finally decided, because I was 52, 53 years old, to see what I could do as a writer\". For several months he lived in a village in the Alentejo, one of the poorest parts of Europe, a province of harsh weather and poor soil and a prime target for land reform. The novel that resulted, Levantado do Ch\"o, a chronicle of three generations of a peasant family, was the first fruit of his long wait to have something \"worth telling\". It introduced his characteristic narrative method - an astringent discursiveness, a style that is omniscient and restrained, a musical and apparently ageless language, a light touch with irony, and dialogue that dispenses with the rules of punctuation. According to Zeferino Coelho, his editor, \"Saramago was known mainly as a political activist, and when Levantado do Ch\"o was published it was a book with a strong political message, but its literary value was evident. Nobody had written a book like it before.\"\n\nSaramago still calls himself a Communist party militant. In the late 1980s he sided with a reformist rebellion whose protagonists were expelled, but he remained within the party, cultivating a personal friendship with the party patriarch Alvaro Cunhal; in October 1998, returning to Lisbon to receive the freedom of the city, he stayed the following day to take part in a vigil by the left-wing union confederation CGTP-IN against revision of the employment laws, and the same month in Oporto took the stage with Fidel Castro to protest against the Cuban blockade. He is now considered \"patrimony of the PCP\", according to Jo\"o Paulo Monteiro.\n\nHow can a writer, who has described his own literary advice as \"Begin with the imagination, but from then on let reason prevail\", continue to be a communist after Stalin and the gulag - after the Berlin Wall has crumbled? \"I'll give you a fundamental contribution to Marxist studies,\" he answers. \"What hasn't been taken into account is the fact that it is possible to be a hormonal communist. I carry inside me a hormone that means I have no other choice than to be a communist. You can ask, 'against everything'? What about the barbarities and crimes committed? My answer is that there is probably no difference between the negative, criminal, horrendous, horrible things done in the name of communism and everything that the human being has done throughout history in the name of the best intentions. Christianity is a good example: millions of people have been sacrificed for a doctrine which is its opposite, a doctrine that promised and still continues to promise forgiveness, love and compassion. Forgiveness, love and compassion are things we're able to show now and then, but they have ended up being submerged by the mass of badness that we also carry. That is why I logically continue to be what I am.\" Saramago does not consider his communism as part of his literary make-up (he has stated that \"I do not regard my party as competent to decide on literary matters or artistic issues\").\n\nHe has written plays in addition to poetry and fiction, including a dramatisation of the life of Portugal's greatest poet, Luis de Camões, What Shall I Do With This Book?, but apart from a further play, The Second Life of Francis of Assisi, the 1980s were entirely devoted to novel-writing. Despite his political disclaimer, strong messages are passed to his readers. In Baltasar and Blimunda, we are educated in the vanity and cruelty of the 18th century, extenuated by love and the dreams that \"hold the world in its orbit\"; in The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis we are led back to Lisbon in 1936, to the creation of Salazar's fascist militias, to confront Pessoa's poet with his own bitter aphorism: \"Wise is he who is satisfied with the spectacle of the world.\" The Stone Raft leaves the reader in no doubt that the Iberian peninsula, broken free from the continent, is an emblem of Saramago's conviction of a divided Europe, powerful north against peripheral and vulnerable south.\n\nIn his latest novel, The Cave, we are drawn into a village potter's struggle against 21st-century economic forces. \"When I set a shopping centre against a pottery doomed by progress to disappear,\" Saramago says, \"it is not my intention to say 'Let's go back to the vieux bons temps'. But we know what globalisation is like. Nobody can delude themselves any longer about what its final project is.\" Following Plato, who used his fable of prisoners only able to see shadows on the cave wall to illustrate the gulf between reality and our perception of it, Saramago makes his all-powerful centre stand for a world in which we mistake the appearance of life for real life. \"In the past people's mentality was formed within a large space which still exists, called the cathedral. Today human mentality is formed within another large space called the shopping centre. And the illusion there is constant.\"\n\nIn person, Saramago is tall, straight and extraordinarily fit. He radiates a courtly calm and is capable of great warmth in gesture and conversation. Read around the world, he is probably read least in France and Britain. (The English-language edition of The Cave was far more widely reviewed in the US than in Britain.) John Banville suggests that this might be due to an \"involuntary small sigh of foreboding\" among British readers at the European vagueness of his narratives. \"I do feel that European fiction has fallen back on a rather easy method ... the world of objects, personalities and sunsets is of no interest now, only the 'psychology' of human affairs, for which characters are not required, only puppets. But without the grist of quotidian reality, the mills of fiction grind very dull.\"\n\nAgainst this criticism may be balanced what Lisa Jardine calls \"a prose of particularly luminous intensity\". In her view \"the roots of Saramago's tales run deep, tapping into a European tradition of exemplary fictions, in which the human soul resists the encroaching forces of dehumanising bureaucracies\". But she also thinks that \"for a reader raised on the English-language tradition of the novel, Saramago's passionate and insistent moral messages can sometimes feel coercive\".\n\nIn an interview two years ago he admitted, not without irony, that \"Probably I'm an essay writer who, as he doesn't know how to write essays, writes novels instead.\" John Banville does not criticise his communist beliefs specifically. \"Marxism is one of the more interesting philosophies of our time, and is just about to come into its own, I think, now that the disastrous misrepresentation of the Soviet Union is gone. But any ideology is ruinous for a novelist.\" Portuguese critics have voiced some reservations about The Cave. Carlos Reis, the author of Dialogues with Saramago, says that \"From the dramatic point of view this is an important and accurate novel [but] when a new situation arises, like this shopping centre, you tend to ask 'what now?', and I don't think we have a very straight answer to this question.\" Mario de Carvalho points out that \"Every book of his is well received now, and that's not good for him because the books themselves are almost not discussed. I must confess that I prefer his first books. But there is no doubt that he is a writer for the future.\"\n\nSaramago met his second wife, the Spanish journalist Pilar del Rio, in 1986, and married her two years later. It has been clear since he published Baltasar and Blimunda that he believes love is what makes life bearable. The Cave shows a man overwhelmed by vulnerability when he understands that society no longer needs him: the potter's frailty erupts into an admission of long-suppressed feelings for Isaura, his neighbour.\n\nIn the house Saramago and Pilar have built on one of the bleached hillsides of Lanzarote overlooking the Atlantic, he has resumed a daily routine of work after the disturbance of the Nobel Prize. Recently he finished a new novel, O homem duplicado (The Duplicate Man), an enquiry into what can happen when two people exist who are duplicates of each other. Standing on their Lanzarote terrace, Saramago is quick to make clear his wife's role as his ideal reader. \"Pilar is my Spanish translator, so I write up there, and she translates down here.\" He also continues to write and publish his Lanzarote Diaries. The Portuguese film director Fernando Lopes has said that \"some of the best pages are the things that he writes about [Pilar]. He knows that he is older, very much older than she is. It's very moving that this man still has the capacity to love that woman. Indeed, he confronts his old age with the energy of his passion.\"\n\nFor Saramago the matter at hand, in his fiction and his life, remains the same. When The Cave was launched in Italy he says an Italian philosopher asked if it's not possible to make literature with good intentions. Saramago would put the question the other way around. \"Why is it not possible to make not just good literature with good intentions, but philosophy too? Why doesn't it follow the path of human kindness? Of course we want to be happy, and we do everything to be happy. I think we should also do something to be simply good.\"\n\nLife at a glance José de Sousa Saramago\n\nBorn: November 16, 1922, Azinhaga, Portugal.\n\nEducation: Primary and grammar schools in Lisbon; Industrial School, Lisbon.\n\nMarried: 1944-70 Ilda Reis (one daughter, Violante); '88- Pilar del Rio.\n\nCareer: 1941-43 motor mechanic, Lisbon; '43-49 civil servant; '50-59 draughtsman, metal company; '59-71 publishing house production manager; '72-74 cultural editor, Diário de Lisboa; '75 deputy editor, Diário de Nóticias; '76- novelist, dramatist, essayist Some fiction in English: 1988 Baltasar and Blimunda; '92 The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis; '93 The Gospel According to Jesus Christ; '94 The Stone Raft, Manual of Painting and Calligraphy; '96 The History of the Siege of Lisbon; '97 Blindness; '99 All the Names, The Tale of the Unknown Island; 2002 The Cave.\n\nNon-fiction: 2000 Journey to Portugal.
