        "text": "The FEUP Library's \"Vamos a Livros\" celebrates the centenary of José Saramago's birth, gathering some of the most emblematic works of his literary career.\n\nJosé Saramago was born on November 16th 1922, in Azinhaga do Ribatejo, Santarém. Besides being a writer, he was a machine fitter and translator. Author of more than 40 titles and a literary work translated into more than thirty languages, José Saramago received the Camões Award in 1995 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998.\n\nJosé Saramago's literary works are realistic, with a social, critical, political, and religious theme, elements of fantastic realism and the defence of human protagonism as a solution to social problems. The writer's main characteristic is intertextuality, especially in relation to classic Portuguese authors such as Camões. José Saramago has built an unmistakable literary work in Portuguese and universal literature, with titles that range from Memorial do Convento to Caim, as well as The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis, The Gospel according to Jesus Christ, Essay on Blindness, All the Names and The Elephant's Journey, works that have been translated all over the world.\n\nDuring November you can get to know or reread and borrow some of the most emblematic works of the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature at FEUP Library's Level 0.\n\nHappy reading!\n\nFor more information contact: agora@fe.up.pt."
