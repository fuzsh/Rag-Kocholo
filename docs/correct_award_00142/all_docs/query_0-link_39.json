        "text": "Portuguese fabulist Jose Saramago, whose entrancing tales and playful skepticism about histor reality make him one of Europe's most original contemporary writers, was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday.\n\nThe 75-year-old author rose from obscurity late in life to become the grand old man of Portuguese letters. Saramago is the first writer in Portuguese, the language of 140 million people around the world, to win the prize.\n\nSaramago's 19 novels, four plays and three volumes of poetry form an iconoclastic body of literature that champions the common man and challenges conventional views on religion and the goal of a united Europe.\n\nThe Swedish Academy said it chose Saramago because his work, \"sustained by imagination, compassion and irony, continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.\"\n\n\"He invokes tradition in a way that in the current state of things can be described as radical,\" the academy's citation said.\n\nThe author, a slight, modest man who looks more like an elderly clerk than a literary giant, heard the news in Frankfurt on his way to the airport from the German city's book fair.\n\n\"It's like being hit on the head, but not hard enough to make you fall down,\" he said of the $978,000 prize.\n\n\"You carry on walking around and wait to come back to your senses.\n\n\"The prize is for all speakers of Portuguese,\" he added. \"But while we're on the subject, if you don't mind, I shall keep the money.\"\n\nSaramago left Portugal in pro-test after its government, under pressure from the Roman Catholic Church, vetoed \"The Gospel Ac-cording to Jesus Christ,\" his re-working of the New Testament, as an entry for the 1991 European Literary Prize.\n\n— —\n\n169 1998 Cape Cod Times.
