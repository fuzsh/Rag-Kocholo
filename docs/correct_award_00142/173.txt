José Saramago is the only blind Nobel Prize winner. In 1998, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his "parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony [with which he] continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality."

Saramago has sold over 2 million books in his native Portugal alone, and his books have been translated into 25 languages.

In one of his books, "Blindness", Saramago uses absolutely no proper nouns. Rather, he refers to characters simply by a unique characteristic.
