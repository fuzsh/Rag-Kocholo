        "text": "Kanchanaburi is a nice weekend getaway from Bangkok if you are tired of big city life and want to chill out a bit in a quiet place it’s a good option for you. Small, compared to Bangkok, 150 km from the capital Kanchanaburi is one of Thailand’s hidden gems.\n\nBoth history lovers and nature wonder seekers will find things to do and to see here. There are really many things to do in Kanchanaburi some of them are quite touristy some more off the beaten track. In this post we arranged places and activities around Kanchanaburi according to the following topics; WWII, cultural experience, outdoor adventures, local food, and relaxation. You can focus on a specific topic or do a little bit of everything. We hope our colorful guide will help you to choose the right activities for you in Kanchanaburi.\n\nIf you’d like to explore more of Thailand and have a great time why not join one of G-Adventures or Intrepid Travel tours to get the most out of your Thai holiday.\n\nBangkok to Chiang Mai Express (G-Adventures)\n\nNorthern Thailand Explorer (G-Adventures)\n\nNorthern Hilltribes Experience (G-Adventures)\n\nThailand Hike, Bike & Kayak experience (G-Adventures)\n\nNote! In this post, we give transportation options with prices and timetable but we’d suggest confirming the times at the local bus/train station as they often change.\n\nUseful tips for Kanchanaburi and Thailand in general. Almost in all more or less touristy cities, you will find water dispenser machines on the streets. You can refill your 1,5 l water bottle for THB 1. For the same bottle in a shop, you’ll pay from THB 10/$0,3. 9 THB doesn’t sound much but if you multiply it let’s say by 30 days you’ll save THB 270/$8. Good for your budget and for ecology as well. Another option is to bring LifeStraw water filter with to Thailand then you can drink tap water pretty much anywhere.\n\nThere are several options to visit Kanchanaburi with a tour from Bangkok;\n\nKanchanaburi Tour, Railway & Floating Markets\n\nKanchanaburi Highlights: 1-Day Small Group Tour from Bangkok\n\nPrivate Kanchanaburi Tour with Photo Guide\n\nBridge on the River Kwai and Thailand-Burma Railway Tour\n\n3-Day River Kwai Adventure from Bangkok\n\nKanchanaburi accommodation\n\nMost tourists stay at Maenamkwai Road, it’s the busiest area with the most hostels, guesthouses and restaurants and close to the river and the bridge. Like in any other more or less touristy place there are hundreds of accommodation options on any budget. Here are some places with the best ratings;\n\nBudget | Baan2rai | Canaan Guesthouse | The Nine Guest House | P.Y. Guest House | Thai Guesthouse |\n\nMiddle price | Good Times Resort | WesTory | Chez Bure – Bure Homestay | Milin Villa |\n\nLuxury | The Glory River Kwai Hotel | Natee The Riverfront Hotel | U Inchantree Kanchanaburi |\n\nBest thigs to do in Kanchanaburi\n\nKanchanaburi and WWII\n\nSites dedicated to WWII are probably one of the main reasons tourists come to Kanchanaburi. All the attractions in the area are related to the Burma Railway or its more popular name the Death Railway.\n\n#1 Get a ride on the Death Railway\n\nFrom the original 415 km of the railway that connected Thailand with Burma (Myanmar) nowadays left only 130 km till Nam Tok station, the rest was abandoned and destroyed with the time. There were different projects of rebuilding the entire railway but due to the difficult terrain (mountains, jungle, etc.), they required a lot of money.\n\nThe railway was built in 1943 to support Japanese forces in the Myanmar campaign of World War II, the construction was done by civilian South East Asian workers and the prisoners of war mainly from Australia, UK, and the Netherlands, they were supervised by Japanese soldiers. The working conditions were terrible prisoners had to build the railway through the jungle, swamp areas, and rocks in the tropical heat and under pouring rain. People died from exhaustion, diseases and bad treatment (beaten to death). All these resulted in thousands of deaths during the construction of the Death Railway, it says there was one dead person for every tie that why the railway got this name.\n\nThe detailed explanation on how to get to the Death Railway is two paragraphs down at the Hellfire Pass museum section as all three the railway, the bridge, and the museum can be visited in one trip.\n\nIf you want to get amazing photos from your trip to Kanchanaburi you can join the Kanchanaburi Instagram day tour that will take you to the best photo spots in the area.\n\n#2 Cross the bridge over the River Kwai\n\nThe famous bridge is not the most beautiful bridge in the world but a quite standard one. It’s the tragic history of the place that makes this bridge special. Works on the bridge started in 1942 right in the midst of World War II. The construction was under Japanese supervision but the builders themselves were prisoners of war from the allied forces, mostly Dutch, British, and Australians. The bridge was a part of the Burma railway between Thailand and Myanmar (ex Burma) that the Japanese planned to use for fast and easy transportation of their army and provision.\n\nA French novel by Pierre Boulle “The Bridge over the River Kwai” and subsequent British-American movie “The Bridge on the River Kwai” were based on the events happened near Kanchanaburi. The movie got 7 Oscars including the Oscar for Best Movie. If you have time I’d recommend to watch it to get an idea about the place and its history.\n\n#3 Visit Hellfire pass and the Memorial Museum\n\nA part of the Death Railway the pass was one of the most difficult parts of the railway. Prisoners worked day and night cutting tough rock formations, torch lights were used to light the area during the night from far away the lights coming from the pass resembled pictures of hell which explains the name of the pass. For the prisoners who worked here, it was a real hell hundreds of people died from exhaustion, tropical fever, and other diseases or were beaten to death by the guards during the construction. People worked 18 hours a day, it took 6 weeks to complete the stretch. You can walk to the pass and see the remains of the railway and visit the memorial museum where you can get more information about the railway in general and the pass in particular.\n\nOpened; daily from 9am to 4pm\n\nAdmission fee; free but you can make a donation\n\nGetting here; from Bangkok – the easiest and the most popular way of visiting the Death Railway, the Bridge and the Hellfire pass museum is to take a train from Thonburi station in Bangkok to Nam Tok station. It leaves twice a day at 7.45am and 1.35pm, the journey takes about 4h30min., price THB100/US$3 pp. From Nam Tok station take a bus to the Hellfire pass, it takes about 25min. to drive there. From Kanchanaburi by bus (#8203) from Kanchanaburi bus station, buses start running between 7am and 7.30am, every hour or so. Make sure to tell the driver where you want to get off. By train from Kanchanaburi to Nam Tok where you switch for a bus or song teow (open taxi). Both ways take about 1h30min. to get there.\n\nOn the way; if you catch an early train or bus to Nam Tok you can combine the visit to WWII sights with the visit to Sai Yok National park (waterfalls) which is close to Nam Tok station.\n\nIf you’d like to stay in the area longer to have more time to explore the railway and the waterfalls you can stay at Nam Tok for a day or two instead of going back to Kanchanaburi or Bangkok.\n\nAccommodation near Nam Tok station\n\n| Binlha Raft | Yayee Homestay | The Float House River Kwai |\n\n#4 Learn more at the Thai Burma Railway center\n\nAfter visiting the Death Railway and its most memorable sights you can get more information related to the area, the railway construction, living conditions of the prisoners, geographical location at this center. There is a souvenir shop where you can buy books related to the Death Railway and WWII and local hand-made souvenirs.\n\nOpened; daily from 9am to 5pm\n\nAdmission fee; THB150/US$4,5 – adults, THB70/US$2 – children.\n\nGetting here; from Bangkok Thonburi train station there are two daily trains to Kanchanaburi that leave at 7.45am and 1.35pm, the journey takes 3 hours, price THB100/US$3 pp. By bus from Bangkok Southern bus terminal, buses leave every 30-40min., price THB100/US$3, takes 2 hours.\n\n#5 Honor the memory at Kanchanaburi War cemetery\n\nThe cemetery was established in 1957 in honor of the prisoners of war who died during the construction of the Death Railway. In total 7 000 people found their final resting place here. The cemetery is well maintained, all graves have similar headstones with name, age, type of corps. Most of the prisoners buried here were between 20-25 years old, mainly Australians, British and Dutch. Any cemetery is about tragedy and loss but to see so many young lives taken because of someone’s ambitions is more than just sad!\n\nOpened; daily from 8am to 5pm\n\nAdmission fee; free\n\nCultural experiences in Kanchanaburi\n\nLike anywhere in Thailand there are many temples and pagodas around Kanchanaburi some of them deserve a visit even if you’ve already seen quite a few temples in Thailand. Besides religious buildings, there are several interesting historical places to visit in the vicinity.\n\n#6 Stroll through the Pak Prak Heritage street\n\nThis historic street in the heart of the city boasts 20 heritage buildings. The street starts at the Old City gate and 500m later ends at Wat Thewasangkaram. The name comes from the Chinese words Pak Phek which means “crossroads”. The street has a unique architecture style a mixture of European, Chinese and Thai styles. Pak Prak community is the oldest community in Kanchanaburi. Over the weekends the street turns into a night food market.\n\nGetting here; the street is located in the city center you can walk here from your hotel or take a tuk-tuk if it’s a bit far.\n\n#7 Chill at Kuang Im Chapel\n\nA Buddhist temple located across the famous bridge on the other side of the River Kwai. It’s difficult not to notice it if you’re at the bridge. To be honest from far we thought it was some kind of a local amusement park; funny colorful sculptures of dragons, pink, blue and green fountains and statues, buildings decorated with all sorts of real and fantastic animals, etc.\n\nThe temple doesn’t seem to be very popular, we didn’t see other tourists here. The surrounding park is not big but nice for walking, you can sit on a bench and enjoy the view over the river Kwai and the bridge. Inside the main temple, you can find Smiling Buddha, a very friendly-looking guy sitting in the middle of the temple.\n\nOpened; daily from 8am to 6pm\n\nAdmission; free\n\nGetting here; it’s just outside the city on the opposite side of the bridge over the river Kwai you can walk here from your hotel.\n\n#8 Wander in Muang Singh Historical Park\n\nMuang Singh or the Lion City is an interesting place with several temples and buildings dating back to the period of prosperity of the Khmer Kingdom, between 857 and 1157 but the main temple (in the center of the complex, the best-preserved one) was built later between the 13th and 14th centuries. The ruins are not nearly as impressive as Angkor Wat or some other complexes in South East Asia but it’s worth of visit, it’s a nice green area at the river with not many tourists.\n\nOpened; daily from 8am – 4.30pm\n\nAdmission; THB100/US$3.\n\nGetting here; from Kanchanaburi take a train to Tha Kilen station, trains leave daily at 6.11am, 11pm, and 4.37pm, the journey takes about 1 hour, price THB100/US$3.

Here you get to know a lot about the changed lifestyle of the Siamese (Thai) people after the Abolition of Slavery in 1905. In Mallika, you can dress in a traditional Thai costume, visit an Ancient market where you can do shopping using old money (Satang) that you can exchange Baht for at the ticket office. Spend some time walking around the place, visit a traditional Thai householding, learn some skills in cooking, sewing or pottering at one of the shops, stop for food at the mini floating market. There are many things to learn and to do around Malika City for everybody if you come here with children I’m sure they’ll enjoy dressing up and walking around the colorful streets.

The Mon bridge is the longest wooden bridge in Thailand and the second longest in the world. The 850m long footbridge was constructed in 1987 over the Song Kalia river.

The area around is beautiful and the historical meaning of the place is important but in general, we’d suggest doing this trip if you’re really into history and have some extra time.

Once inside the dragon, you’ll walk up through a long tunnel until you reach the first temple-cave. After that, there will be more caves and more stairs till you finally reach the top crowned with the golden stupa. The views from the top are spectacular but the climb there is quite demanding we’d recommend to do it in the morning before the heat.\n\nOpened; daily from 8am to 6pm\n\nAdmission; free, donations are appreciated\n\nGetting here; no buses, you can take a tuk-tuk or songthaew from Kanchanaburi, price about THB 1000/US$30 for a round trip, you can negotiate and visit other temples.\n\nOn the way; visit Wat Ban Tham can be combined with Wat Tham Sua and Wat Tham Khao Noi temples.\n\n#14 Visit two temples at once\n\nWat Tham Sua and Wat Tham Khao Noi are two Buddhist temples are located next to each other on the top of the hill and can be seen from miles away, you can see it on the way if you go from Bangkok to Kanchanaburi by bus. Wat Tham Sua or the Tiger Cave temple (tigers used to live in the caves of it) is built in the Thai architecture style when Wat Tham Khao Noi is a Chinese temple. To get to Wat Tham Sua you can either walk upstairs or take a cable car, THB10/US$0,3. Although both temples are located next to each other to get to the top of both you’ll have to walk up and down twice because they are not connected. Like any other Buddhist temple, both are beautifully decorated with many details that can catch one’s eye. The most impressive part of the visit is the stunning views over the surrounding green hills. Among other highlights of the temples are a giant statue of Buddha (18m) and the pagodas. Tip!

This district used to be one of the main mining places in the region but after the tin market crash in 1985, the mines were abandoned. In the last 10 years, the area grows in popularity as a new tourist destination in Thailand, the main highlights that attract tourists here are Thong Pha Phum National park and a small charming village of Etong. There are several homestays in the village where you can stay to enjoy the tranquility and authenticity of this small Thai settlement.\n\nGetting here; first, take a bus from Kanchanaburi to Sangkhlaburi, get off at Thong Pha Phum market, takes between 2 and 3 hours (depending on the bus), buses run from 6am till 6.30pm, every 30min. From Thong Pha Phum take a Songthaew (a yellow bus) to Etong village, the journey takes about 2 hours, there is a bus that leaves between 10am and 10.30am. If you’re planning to do a day trip we’d suggest catching the earliest bus from Kanchanaburi.

There are quite a few parks and waterfalls around Kanchanaburi if you’re tired of sightseeing you can catch a bus and go to one of them. Note! On weekends and public holidays these places get quite crowded it’s a favorite time spending place for locals.\n\nThe best time to visit the waterfalls is just after the monsoon season when the falls are the most powerful and the pools are at their fullest. We were in Kanchanaburi in June, the beginning of the rainy season but there was no rain and not much water. Some waterfalls and pools, especially smaller ones, were almost dry.\n\nFor those who like outdoor activities and adventure travel G-Adventures has a great tour option Thailand Hike, Bike & Kayak during the trip you get to do all these activities and visit different parts of the country including some islands.\n\n#16 Visit famous Erawan National park\n\nProbably the most famous park near Kanchanaburi, a wonderful nature place with waterfalls and pools hidden in the jungle.

It’s better to start early in the morning before it gets very hot. On the way, you can refresh in several pools with nice clear water. We spent about 4-5 hours in the park, walked from the waterfall №1 to №7, stopped in two or three places for a short swim and took a lot of photos.

To get to Dao Wadung cave first you go on a long-tail boat down the river for about 5km and then walk uphill for 1km to the cave. Lawa Cave requires a short boat ride as well, it’s probably the most impressive cave in the park, with a small entrance and huge chambers. The other two caves can be reached on foot; Kang Kao – 2km walk (one way) starts at the visitor’s center; Wang Badan – 3km trail starts at Sai Yoi waterfall (follow the indications).
