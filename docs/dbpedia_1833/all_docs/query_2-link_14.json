In recent years, Koh Tao’s diving schools have banded together to help preserve the turtle breeding grounds.\n\nOther popular activities on the island include rock climbing, sailing, mountain biking and game fishing. Mae Hat also has several schools that offer courses in Thai cooking and yoga. Sairee Village is the island’s hot spot and has an assortment of restaurants, bars and clubs.\n\n3.

The largest island is Ko Phi Phi Don, a popular vacation destination famed for its sun-soaked beaches, beautiful limestone cliffs and laid-back atmosphere.\n\nTonsai Bay and Long Beach attract the most tourists, while secluded beaches like Phak Nam Bay offer a tranquil escape away from the crowds.
