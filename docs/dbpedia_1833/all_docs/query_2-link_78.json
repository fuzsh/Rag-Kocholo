        "text": "Everything you need to know about a Doi Inthanon day trip, including how to get there, what to see and do, and most importantly, is it worth it!\n\nThailandâ€™s tallest mountain, Doi Inthanon, is home to some of the most spectacular waterfalls, landscapes and cultures in the entire country.\n\nSituated just a 90 minutes from Chiang Mai, the Doi Inthanon National Park is a popular place for locals to venture for the day or to camp up in the mountains.\n\nWith sensational temples, soaring cascades, hiking trails and a welcoming Karen hill tribe village serving up locally-grown coffee and fruits, itâ€™s easily one of the best places to visit in Thailand.\n\nYet for some reason itâ€™s often skipped by visitors in to Chiang Mai province, who tend to focus more on the awesome things to do in the city, or other famous spots in northern Thailand such as Pai and Chiang Rai.\n\nAnd weâ€™ll be honest. We did exactly that, even though we spent 3 months living in Chiang Mai.\n\nOn our most recent trip though we wanted to make the journey to the top of Thailandâ€™s highest mountain, so booked on for a Doi Inthanon day trip.\n\nAfter the day spent exploring the national park we were blown away, and couldnâ€™t believe we hadnâ€™t visited sooner.\n\nREAD MORE: Check out our expert guide to travelling in Thailand!\n\nDoi Inthanon Day Trip â€“ The Complete Guide\n\nIf youâ€™re wondering whether or not itâ€™s worth going on a day trip to Doi Inthanon National Park, this blog post will not only convince you but help you make the most of your time up there!\n\nLetâ€™s dive into it.\n\nAbout Doi Inthanon National Park\n\nDoi Inthanon National Park is a lush, mountainous region of northern Thailand, and is most famous for being home to the highest mountain in the country, Doi Inthanon at 2565m above sea level.\n\nKnown as the â€˜Roof of Thailandâ€™, this large protected area of around 482 square kilometres in size was officially designated as a national park in 1972, and is easily accessed from nearby Chiang Mai.\n\nThe flora found in Doi Inthanon is quite unique, with cloud forests, deciduous teak trees and sphagnum bog.\n\nParts of the park are inhabited, and there are small Karen and Meo Hmong hill tribe villages found throughout Doi Inthanon National Park. Most of these villages are not open to the public, but it is possible to visit and stay in one Karen hill tribe village.\n\nThere is an abundance of wildlife found around Doi Inthanon National Park, such as gibbons, deer and wild boar.\n\nThe birdlife in particular is spectacular, making it very popular for bird watchers.\n\nIs Doi Inthanon National Park Worth Visiting?\n\nIf you love beautiful waterfalls, sprawling landscapes, unique cultures and organic food, then yes, Doi Inthanon National Park is 100% worth visiting!\n\nEven if you only have a few days in Chiang Mai, you wonâ€™t regret a trip to Doi Inthanon.\n\nWhat is the Best Time to Visit Doi Inthanon?\n\nDoi Inthanon is beautiful at any time of year, so it really doesnâ€™t matter when you come. But if you are wondering what it will be like in different seasons this will help out:\n\nDry Season â€“ December to April\n\nThis is when most travellers visit Thailand, as the weather is mild, thereâ€™s less chance of rain and humidity is low.\n\nItâ€™s a wonderful time of year to go on a Doi Inthanon day trip, but keep in mind that this is winter and the high altitudes mean temperatures can, and do, drop to close to zero.\n\nWet Season â€“ May to November\n\nThe wet season means the waterfalls are at their strongest, and in our opinion makes travelling in the â€˜off seasonâ€™ the best time to visit Doi Inthanon National Park.\n\nThis is also the hottest time of year though, which can make trekking a bit more uncomfortable. The higher you get into the park the temperature will drop, and itâ€™s not uncommon to need a sweater or jacket at the summit and Royal Pagodas.\n\nMake sure you pack warm clothes regardless of the time of year.\n\nSmoky Season\n\nBurn-offs happen in the area around the end of February into March, and this results in a lot of smoke pollution in the air.\n\nThis can make trekking quite difficult and views may be restricted, so keep this in mind and check air quality if planning on travelling to the national park during this time.\n\nHow to Get to Doi Inthanon\n\nLocated in the Chom Thong District of the Chiang Mai Province, this national park is a 90km drive, which will take 1.5 hours to get there from the Old Town.\n\nIf you driving yourself by car or motorbike from Chiang Mai, the easiest way to get there is to take route 108 towards Chomthong for 57km.\n\nTurn right onto Route 1009, Chomtong-Doi Inthanon Road, the drive another 31km until you get to the national park gate.\n\nThe road continues to climb steeply up to Thailandâ€™s highest peak.\n\nJoining a Group Tour\n\nIf youâ€™d prefer to leave the driving to someone else and love the idea of having a guide to explore Doi Inthanon National Park with, then there are lots of options for joining a small group tour.\n\nOn these youâ€™ll be picked up and dropped off at your hotel in Chiang Mai and will be taken to the most beautiful parts of the national park.\n\nThis particular tour includes all your admission fees, lunch, water, an English-speaking guide and transport in a modern, air-conditioned van.\n\nJoining a Private Tour\n\nWe personally went on a private tour as we wanted a bit more flexibility in terms of timing to explore the Doi Inthanon National Park.\n\nIn the end weâ€™re so glad we did, because we ended up spending a lot more time than we expected at the waterfalls, which blew our minds, and the personal experience we had with our guide was fantastic.\n\nWe booked through the local company Tour East, and our guideâ€™s name was Peo.\n\nYou can contact them here:\n\nWebsite: https://tour-east-thailand.rezdy.com/165881/doi-inthanon-national-park-tour\n\nPeoâ€™s Personal WhatsApp Phone Number: +66 81 992 5583\n\nHow Much is the National Park Fee?\n\nBeing a national park there is a small entrance fee required to enter, and this is put towards local conservation and infrastructure.\n\nThe Doi Inthanon National Park entrance fees are:\n\nAdults: 300THB\n\nChildren: 150 THB\n\nCars: 30 THB\n\nMotorbikes: 20THB\n\nYou pay the entrance fees directly at the national park gate and youâ€™ll be given your entrance ticket. Hold onto this, as you may be required to show it if stopped by any national park rangers or police.\n\nThe Best Things to Do in Doi Inthanon National Park\n\nNow that you know all the history, how to get here, and when to visit, itâ€™s time to dive into our list of the best things to do in Doi Inthanon National Park!\n\nMost of these can be done on a single Doi Inthanon day trip, although there really is so much to do that you could easily fill multiple days on different visits or by camping up in the national park.\n\nREAD MORE: See where else makes our list of the top places to visit in Thailand!\n\n1) Be Amazed at Wachirathan Waterfall\n\nOne of the first places youâ€™ll visit on a day trip to Doi Inthanon is the Wachirathan Waterfall, and if youâ€™re anything like us youâ€™ll be shocked at the power of this towering cascade.\n\nThe tiered waterfall tumbles 250m down a series of rocky outcrops, with the most impressive section being an 80m torrent that is easily seen from the trail.\n\nPreviously a long hike was required to get to the falls, but now a road and car park has been built to provide access to the largest part of Wachirathan Waterfall, making it accessible for anyone with a short walk.\n\nBe aware that the path can be very slippery and muddy, so watch your footing and wear enclosed shoes.\n\nIf youâ€™re here with your own transport or on a private tour you can hike to the other tiers. This is not a well beaten path though so make sure youâ€™re comfortable with trail bashing.\n\n2) Hike to Mae Klang Luang Village on the Pha Dok Siew Nature Trail\n\nTrekking in Doi Inthanon is one of the best activities you can do here, but if youâ€™re not planning on doing a full day trip on the trails you can still enjoy a fantastic hike to the Mae Klang Luang Village.\n\nIf youâ€™re on a small group tour or private tour, your driver will drop off the passengers at the trail head and collect you at the end.\n\nAt the beginning of the trail youâ€™ll meet a local tribe elder from the Karen village, who will be your guide on this lovely 4km hike, navigating through forests, rice fields and rivers.\n\nHiking the trail with a local guide from the Karen hill tribes is mandatory, but the small cost is well worth it.\n\nThe trail is all downhill, and your local guide will point out lots of interesting sights along the way.\n\nThe scenery is spectacular, especially around the Sirithan Waterfall and the sprawling rice fields as you get closer to the Mae Klang Luang Village.\n\nYouâ€™ll finish in the Karen Hill tribe village, where you can enjoy a coffee or bite to eat before being picked up by your driver.\n\n3) Check out a Coffee Plantation in a Karen Hill Tribe Village\n\nWhen the former King of Thailand visited Doi Inthanon he was shocked and saddened to see the prominence of the opium trade rising in the region.\n\nFarmers were using their land to grow poppies due to the high value of the crop, thus further fuelling the drug crisis.\n\nWanting to provide a better, safer life for his people, the King launched a Royal Project to encourage farmers to move into other industries.\n\nHe promised them that if they grew other, legal plants, the Thai royal family would purchase them at premium rates.\n\nWith love and respect for their King, the farmers did just that, and started growing fruits, vegetables, flowers and coffee.\n\nAnd as promised, the King and his businesses guaranteed a high source of income for everyone who joined the Royal Project, helping lift many of these people out of poverty and away from dangerous industries.\n\nIn the Mae Klang Luang village a large portion of land has been turned into a coffee plantation, growing and roasting delicious, organic beans right there in the valley.\n\nAfter our down to the village we sat down and learned all about the coffee industry here in Doi Inthanon National Park, and of course, tucked into a delicious brew.\n\nBesides roasting and serving the beans right there in the village, the farmers now export all over Southeast Asia. A fantastic example of how the former Kingâ€™s Royal Projects have improved lives throughout Thailand.\n\n4) Visit the Twin Royal Pagodas\n\nNear the highest point of Doi Inthanon is the Twin Royal Pagodas of Phra Mahathat Naphamethanidon and Naphapholphumisiri, two chedis that have been built on the edge of the mountain and surrounded by spectacular gardens.\n\nThey were built to commemorate the 60th birthdays of the former King and Queen, and no Doi Inthanon tour is complete without stopping by to admire the stunning views over the surrounding mountains.\n\nThey are quite modern compared to the traditional temples you get around other parts in Thailand, but that doesnâ€™t make them any less magnificent.\n\nSpend 30 minutes or so checking out the interior of the King and Queen Pagodas, and make sure you save some time to walk through the gardens and soak up the fresh air.\n\nThe entrance os 100 Baht per person. Two Chedis are not managed by park.\n\n5) Grab a Selfie at Thailandâ€™s Highest Point\n\nOnce youâ€™ve made it to the highest point in Thailand itâ€™s almost compulsory to snap a selfie at the top!\n\nThereâ€™s a sign to mark the Doi Inthanon summit, so grab your shot at 2565m above sea level then keep exploring.\n\n6) Hike the Kew Mae Pan Nature Trail\n\nYouâ€™ll be getting up your step count for the day with all these awesome outdoor activities in Doi Inthanon National Park, and another walk you shouldnâ€™t miss if the weather is nice is the Kew Mae Pan Nature Trail.\n\nComing in at just under 3km, itâ€™s worth setting aside a few hours to truly appreciate the mountain views youâ€™ll find along the way.\n\nKew Mae Pan boasts the most beautiful panoramic view in the entire country, gazing out over the valley and is a perfect spot for sunrise.\n\nIf youâ€™re not up here early though donâ€™t stress. The hike is great at any time of day, especially in the late afternoon when the sun starts to dip and cast its golden rays across the mountains.\n\nThe Kew Mae Pan nature trail is closed from June to October in the rainy season. Itâ€™s 200 baht per group to hire a guide for the trail, which isnâ€™t optional.\n\n7) Walk Around Ang Ka Luang Nature Trail\n\nFrom the Doi Inthanon summit youâ€™ll find a sensational boardwalk called the Ang Ka Luang Nature Trail, which cuts through a moss-covered forest and over sphagnum bog.\n\nDespite only being 400m in length the well beaten track feels like youâ€™ve stepped into another world, and this section alone makes it easy to understand why Doi Inthanon is one of the best national parks in the country.\n\nMost day trips and tours will give you a short amount of time to check out the trail, so make sure you donâ€™t miss it.\n\n8) Photograph the Sirithan Waterfall\n\nThere are a lot of epic waterfalls you can come across on a Doi Inthanon day trip, but one of our favourites was the Sirithan Waterfall on the way to the small village of Mae Klang Luang.\n\nWe came across this on our day tour of Doi Inthanon National Park, and couldnâ€™t believe that a place like this exists just a few hours from Chiang Mai old city.\n\nA bamboo bridge stretches across the river at the base of Sirithan Waterfall, which towers above the forest and tumbles from the cliffs in a raging torrent.\n\nIf youâ€™re into waterfall photography a great spot to snap a shot is to wander downstream and look back at the bridge and falls. Placing someone on the bridge at the same time adds an awesome perspective to just how high it really is.\n\n9) Eat Lunch at a Local Restaurant\n\nJust because itâ€™s a national park doesnâ€™t mean you have to pack your own lunch to visit. There are a number of great local restaurants around that you can grab a meal at.\n\nIf youâ€™re on a tour, your guide and drive will drop off the tour group at a local restaurant where youâ€™ll be able to tuck into some delicious Thai cuisine."
