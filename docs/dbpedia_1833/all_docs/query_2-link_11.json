        "text": "Pha Sok national park in Ubon Ratchathani\n\nWhen a long vacation is coming, we know many people can’t help but imagine relaxing in an outdoor jacuzzi at a luxury resort with scenic views somewhere in Thailand. However, it would be way more interesting if you could change up the atmosphere a bit – think unwinding in a jacuzzi on the edge of a cliff with panoramic views of a river instead.\n\nAfter reading that rather specific description, you might be wondering if there’s really some place like this in Thailand. Well, sorta. Pha Sok in Ubon Ratchathani is a low-key untouched nature spot in Thailand where you can lie in a floating jacuzzi with sweeping views of Mekong River. We dive into a brief overview of what you can expect here, and how to make your way there.\n\nMore attractions to visit in Thailand:\n\nVisit this resort with all-glass Scandinavian-style cottages\n\nTo The Sea Koh Kood is a beachfront resort that’s reminiscent of the Bahamas\n\nCheck out this Bali-themed cafe: Hidden Tree Garden\n\nSoak in a jacuzzi with panoramic views of Mekong River\n\nImage credit: @pycaptain\n\nBasically, Pha Sok is a viewpoint and a campsite in Pha Taem National Park that boasts a natural pool along with uninterrupted views of lush mountains and abundant forests.\n\nImage credit: @i_blackjourney\n\nTo get to Pha Sok, you will find yourself hiking up through thickly forested trails. On average, it takes a hike of about 3 to 5 kilometres to reach the viewpoint on foot, or you can contact a ranger for a ride. Finding a guide to go along with you is definitely a good idea if you’re not familiar with the way, as well as having someone who’s familiar with the route for safety reasons.\n\nImage credit: @widsawaphatiew\n\nOnce you get yourself through the trails, you will be greeted with a jaw-dropping scene in front of you – the majestic sight of the Mekong River set against the backdrop of verdant hills.\n\nBest to pack your swimwear as well, as there’s a small natural pool where you can take a dip in while soaking up the scenic views of the winding Mekong River that stretches between Thailand and Cambodia’s borders. FYI, the best time to visit Pha Sok would be during or right after the rainy season, so there’ll be more water in this po0l to lounge in.\n\nImage credit: @widsawaphatiew\n\nFor a second, you might wonder where the water goes within the pool, since it seems to be flowing somewhere. Peering down from the edge, you’ll see that the water falls down in a beautiful waterfall to the ground, from the hidden pool area. If you want a photo just like the one featured, we’d say it’s best to bring a drone along and fly it towards the angle you need to take a striking bird’s eye view shot of the waterfall.\n\nUnwind with a cup of coffee at a riverside cafe\n\nImage credit: @phakanthew_tt\n\nAfter taking a short hike and a quick swim, you may be looking for a cafe to sit down at with a drink nearby. The Memory Cafe is a riverside eatery near Pha Taem National Park that offers an outdoor dining area with – you guessed it – more views of the Mekong River.\n\nImage credit: @ladyppam\n\nWithin a 10-minute drive from the national park, we’re not surprised that the cafe is a popular spot for tourists visiting Pha Sok. Decked out in delicate and colourful blooms, the cafe has many IG photo spots for those looking to shoot an #OOTD, or simply to snap pics along one of Thailand’s iconic natural landscapes.\n\nGetting to Pha Sok in Ubon Ratchathani\n\nImage credit: @promwipromwipromwipromwi\n\nIf you’re harbouring dreams of relaxing in a jacuzzi on your upcoming vacations, try switching things up from the typical lux resort to Pha Sok instead. Due to its breathtaking scenery, we find it hard not to float this national park up on our bucket list. Plus, your IG and TikTok followers will thank you for it.\n\nOf course, before heading to the Pha Sok nature reserve, do note that you’ll have to contact Pha Taem National Park for an admission request 3 days prior to your visit, which comes with a fee of ฿40 (~USD1) for Thai visitors and ฿400 (~USD10) for foreigners.\n\nSince it is located at the northeastern border of the country, we understand it might be a tad difficult to travel to, if you plan to drive here from the city. The best way, in our opinion, is to fly to Ubon Ratchathani and rent a car there to head to the place.\n\nIf you’re been to Pha Sok, do share your experiences in the comments and whether you’d think of revisiting it.\n\nPha Sok\n\nAddress: Huai Phai, Khong Chiam District, Ubon Ratchathani 34220Telephone: +66 4 524 9780Pha Sok’s Facebook | Google Maps\n\nCover images adapted from (Clockwise from Top Left): @widsawaphatiew, @widsawaphatiew, @milkcho_colate"
