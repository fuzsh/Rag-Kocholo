        "text": "Buatong Waterfall\n\nSeveral hours tour\n\nThe Buatong Waterfall is located about 60 km north of Chiang Mai near the Sri Lanna National Park and is much better known by the nickname \"Sticky Waterfall\": it is completely covered with limestone and other minerals and this coating is very non-slip which makes it pretty easy to climb the waterfall (in particularly steep places with the help of ropes). You can climb five different levels and feel a bit like Spiderman. There are also ordinary steps on the side for all those who do not want to get wet.\n\nNong Buak Haad Public Park\n\n1-2 hours activity\n\nSouthwest of the Old City, not very far from the Chiang Mai Gate, you can find Nong Buak Haad Public Park - a green oasis spread across approx. 8.000 square meters amid the city with three ponds, numerous benches and several large green lawns - a great place to relax. You can borrow a bamboo mat for 20 baht and sit somewhere on the lawns and just enjoy watching the goings-on around you. Many locals like to come here to relax, for a picnic, for nice photos or early in the morning for Tai Chi or to do some jogging. The park is a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a while. Vendors sell small snacks or drinks in the park and on particularly hot days ice vendors also find their way into the park from time to time.\n\nMonthathan Waterfall\n\nSeveral hours activity\n\nThe Monthathan Waterfall can be found approx. 16 km west of Chiang Mai and about 3 km past Huay Kaew waterfall and is part of the Doi Suthep - Doi Pui National Park. It can be reached on a good road and from the park office it is a pleasant and short walk through nature to this nine-tiered waterfall floweing over a cliff - keep in mind, that during the dry season the water running down this waterfall might be very low to none. Being so close to the city this waterfall attracts many tourists and travellers who come here to relax, so do not expect to be there all by yourself.\n\nDoi Pui View Point\n\nStunning Sunsets1-2 hours activity\n\nThis viewpoint is located at approximately 1,600 meters altitude in Doi Suthep National Park and about 8 km behind Wat Phra That Doi Suthep. On a clear day you have a really breathtaking view of the mountain landscape and, especially at sunset, this infinite expanse of mountain landscape unfolds a truly fascinating effect. The view up here is so beautiful that you do not want to look away. Doi Pui combines very well with a previous visit to Wat Phalat and Wat Phra That Doi Suthep.\n\nIndividual tours\n\nWhere do you want to go?\n\nDo you want to see something special - we will tailor your perfect sightseeing tour for you so that your memories of Chiang Mai will become unforgettable. We have arranged many personal tours before: half day/day trips or longer trips with overnight stays. The possibilities are almost endless and there is so much to see around Chiang Mai. Send us your inquiry and we will create a wonderful sightseeing tour exactly to your wishes.\n\nBook this tour\n\nWat Chaloem\n\nUnprecedented LocationFull day tour\n\nWat Chaloem Phra Kiat Phrachomklao Rachanusorn (what a long name) is also known by the names Wat Phabatpuphadang, Wat Phrabuddhabat or Wat Doi and these absolutely spectacular temples and pagodas dotting the mountain peaks are most likely the most breathtaking in all of Thailand and were each carried up piece by piece by a local monk and a team of nearly 50 workers just over a decade ago and are since then clinging to the jagged cliff face at the top of a mountain, overlooking a sheer drop close to 1,000 meters below. Wat Chaloem might not be super popular with foreigners yet as it is not near the tourist hot spots, but it is well loved by Thais so on weekends or holidays it is a good idea to stay one night to be able to go early in the morning. You will not be disappointed and the 2,5 hour drive from Chiang Mai is well worth it.\n\nNote: there is a guesthouse approx. 15 minutes near the Wat (Santisuk Hotel, approx. 700 THB, nice & clean, Link) if you want to stay overnight. No online booking - give them a call, the owners speak some English\n\nDoi Inthanon\n\nHighest mountain in ThailandFull day tour\n\nSet foot on the highest mountain of Thailand at 2,565 meters, visit the Twin Chedis as well as several beautiful waterfalls like Mae Klang, Wachirathan or Sirithan on your way to the top of Thailand and when the sun rolls the mists and clouds away, the view from the top is simply spectacular. With our tour you will also visit the outlying Mae Ya waterfall - one of the most beautiful waterfalls of Thailand.\n\nBook this tour\n\nMae Sa Waterfall\n\nSeveral hours activity\n\nThe Mae Sa waterfall is located approximately 25 km north of Chiang Mai and is relatively easy to find. This multi-level waterfall consists of 10 levels that you carefully also can try to climb or you use the narrow path next to the waterfall, which leads the approximately 1.2 km length of all levels up the mountain - on warm days a bit sweaty. This waterfall is a popular weekend spot, so try to be here in the morning or during the week to avoid the biggest crowds. Mae Sa is also great as part of a full day tour to Mon Cham.\n\nWat Phra That Doi Kham\n\nTemple with scenic view\n\nAlso referred to as \"Wat Doi Kham\" or \"Golden Temple\", Wat Phra That Doi Kham is located south west of Chiang Mai at the top of a hill. The views from the top of Wat Doi Kham are very nice, especially on clear days: you can see the city of Chiang Mai as well as the rolling mountains of Doi Pui Mountain. This temple is mainly visited by Thaiâs who come to visit the 17 meters high statue of the Sitting Buddha which can be spotted from the bottom of the hill. Its gold lending decoration has given the temple its nickname \"The Golden Temple\". There are different ways to get up to Wat Phra That Doi Kham but if you want the true experience, take the staircase with 300 steps and decorated ith a serpent on each side, winding up from the bottom to the temple.\n\nThe grounds of Wat Phra That Doi Kham are usually quiet, altough there can be times when bus loads of tourists arrive at the temple making it quite busy. The setting of the temple on top of a hill contributes a lot to the serene and peaceful atmosphere and from the viewpoints you will have a great view of the surrounding area including nearby Royal Park Ratchaphruek.\n\nMon Cham\n\nSeveral hours tour\n\nMon Cham (also Mon Chaem or Mon Jam) is located 38 km northwest of Chiang Mai on a ridge in the Mong Nong Hoi area of ââMae Rim and is beautifully adorned with many beautiful blooming flowers - a small farming community in a quiet mountain landscape, on whose mountain slopes all kinds of organic products are grown in the cooler temperatures. If you are looking for a destination for a quiet getaway, you should put Mon Cham on your wish list. With a small restaurant (with a very good coffee) and plenty of seating, offering spectacular views of the colorful panorama of the northern Thai mountain landscape amidst a sea of ââgreen, Mon Cham is a truly worthwhile destination.\n\nWat Pha Lat\n\nThe hidden temple\n\nWat Pha Lat is a hidden gem of Chiang Mai, located just a few miles below Doi Suthep in the forest. This Buddhist temple is probably the most peaceful one can find in Chiang Mai. The temple site is unique and blends harmoniously into the natural environment on a cliff and borders a waterfall. The only way to reach Wat Pha Lat is the \"Monk's Trail\", marked by trees wrapped in the usual orange cloth used by the monks to get dressed, and leading moderately uphill for about 45 minutes. Once you've reached the temple, you'll realize that a 45-minute hike is a breeze, measured at the first sight of the staircase, which is decorated with two dragons and ending abruptly at the edge of the waterfall. It is simply amazing.\n\nNote: we recommend wearing good shoes and bring some pieces of clothing to cover your shoulders and/or thighs in the temple\n\nSri Lanna National Park\n\nFull day tour\n\nThe Sri Lanna National Park about 1 hour north of Chiang Mai has it all: jungle waterfalls, dam, reservoir, trekking, wildlife, and much more. You can choose from an abundance of activities that will occupy every adventurous traveller like visiing the 9-tier waterfall Mon Hin Lai in the Mae Ngat forest (N/E of the reservoir close to the Mae Phaeng lake, near the 1001 heading north) or if you are up for it, the Mae Ngat Sombun Chon Dam is also famous for white-water rafting. There are quite a few other waterfalls to be found and caves to explore or trails to wander. You can do kayaking on the tranquil waters, ride a mountain bike through the rugged terrain or arrange fishing trips and boat tours and if you get hungry there are restaurants and similar facilities inside the park as well.\n\nHuay Kaew Waterfall\n\nSeveral hours activity\n\nHuay Kaew is located just after the Chiang Mai Zoo, making it the easiest and quickest accessible waterfall from downtown Chiang Mai - although the falls here are not as high and majestic as, say Mae Ya, shade trees over the path and the waterfall itself do make it a relaxing spot to enjoy a picnic or a little splashing. Just remember that Huay Kaew is actually a wet-weather fall meaning that flow can be extremely low to completely dry during dry season and - being that close to the city, it is likely that there will be quite some people there."
