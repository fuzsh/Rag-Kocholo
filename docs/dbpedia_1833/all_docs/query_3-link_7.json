        "text": "Pha Taem National Park (อุทยานแห่งชาติผาแต้ม) is a small national park near the Mekong River in Ubon Ratchathani Province, northeast of Thailand. The park, covering the area of 140 square kilometers, features the plateaus, hills, deciduous dipterocarp forest, sheer cliffs resulting from the earthquakes, irregular shaped sand stone which is scattered around and the beautiful wild flowers growing among the rocky ground. The highlight of the park are Pha Taem and Pha Kam which located near the National Park headquarters. The surface of the cliffs are filled with numerous prehistoric cave paintings dating back about 3,000 years that explore the traditional way of life of people who once lived here during the prehistoric days. Scenes in the paintings include fishing, hunting, human figures, animals, hands and geometric designs.\n\nFor the nature lovers, this area is truly incredible nature. The park also has several examples of mushroom rocks as well as one of the largest flower field in Thailand.\n\nUnder the Leadership of Dr Weerachai Nanakorn, 1st Vice President and Leader of the Natural History Section, the Society will arrange a study trip for members to visit many sites of interest in Pha Taem National Park which include a visit to prehistoric paintings, waterfalls, and various sites with many species of flowers blossoming among the rock terraces in the transition period of the rainy season to winter. Members will also stroll in the park to enjoy the unusual beauty of the sandstone terrace caused by the erosion of the Mekong water way that formed it into many different shapes of rock.\n\nBooking\n\nNote – To comply with the measures recommended by the government due to the COVID-19 pandemic protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions.
