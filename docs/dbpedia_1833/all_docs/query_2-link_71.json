        "text": "The name of the Golden Triangle still conjures up images of poppy fields, opium-smoking hilltribes and clandestine laboratories hidden in the jungle.\n\nThe truth is that, currently, the dangerous border air of this region survives only in the past (at least in the Thai part), and the Golden Triangle of Thailand is a region that attracts many travelers, who decide to include this region within their route ‚Äîoften as a day trip from Chiang Rai city‚Äî lured by the myth.\n\nIn this article we tell you what Thailand‚Äôs Golden Triangle is, which are its main highlights for the traveler, and finaly we propose a complete two-day route to get to know Thailand‚Äôs Golden Triangle.\n\nHere you can find:\n\nWhat is Thailand‚Äôs Golden Triangle?\n\nGolden Triangle is the name by which is known the mountainous area where the countries of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos converge:\n\n‚ÄúTriangle‚Äù for being the meeting point of three countries.\n\n‚ÄúGold‚Äù because this precious metal was the payment system used by the first opium traders.\n\nThe cultivation of opium in this region is not an ancestral activity, since it was not until the end of the 19th century when the tribal populations that grew opium migrated from southern China to the highlands of Southeast Asia.\n\nIn the early 1940‚Äôs the Golden Triangle of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos produced a modest amount of opium, but the suppression of opium crops in China and later Iran in 1955 brought the bulk of the world‚Äôs opium production to move to this mountainous region of Southeast Asia.\n\nLater, internal political conflicts in Myanmar caused production in this region to skyrocket until it accounted for more than 70% of the opium sold globally (much of which was refined for heroin).\n\nThe opium trade has historically been used in this area by insurgent groups to finance civil wars, as well as by government guerrillas and for the personal benefit of corrupt officials. In recent decades, the cultivation and trade of opium that made the Golden Triangle famous has been drastically reduced in all three countries and, in the specific case of Thailand, it was banned in 1959 and has been practically eradicated for many years.\n\nIs the Golden Triangle worth visiting?\n\nIt should be mentioned that the Golden Triangle (used by travel agencies to name manypackage tours to Thailand) sometimes disappoints some travelers with inflated expectations who hope to find much more than a couple of rivers merging together. Deep down, the Golden Triangle tag has been used by the tourism industry to exaggerate the real appeal this area conveys to tourists.\n\nFor some travelers, the beautiful alpine landscapes and paddy fields that you pass by on the way are more interesting than the heart of the Golden Triangle itself, where the three countries meet.\n\nSo, in our opinion, Chiang Rai is well worth for most travelers, as is its surroundings. But, the Golden Triangle, despite being interesting if one has time, is not essential for every traveler, although it is for some.\n\nNext we‚Äôll see the main highlights of Thailand‚Äôs Golden Triangle, so that you can see if it sounds appealing enough to include in your trip to Thailand.\n\nSop Ruak: the crossroads of three countries\n\nThe nerve center of Thailand‚Äôs Golden Triangle is Sop Ruak, a small Thai town located right at the point where the Ruak River merges into the Mekong, forming the natural borders that delimit Thailand, Myanmar and Laos.\n\nNext to the river, at the spot that offers the best panoramic view, there is a viewpoint that allows you to contemplate a little piece of the three countries at the same time. This riverside area is striking for its Buddhist temples, altars and statues, a set in which a huge golden Buddha especially stands out, crowning a temple on a large structure in the shape of a boat.\n\nTruth is that the best place to enjoy the views over the three countries is not here, but the top of the tree-lined hill next to the very center of the town, and which is accessed through a staircase that starts right next to the House of Opium museum. The short walk up there also allows to visit two Buddhist temples along the way.\n\nBesides enjoying the views over the area where the three countries meet, the most outstanding activities you can do at Sop Ruak are taking a boat trip on the Mekong River, and visiting one (or both) of its two interesting museums devoted to the opium trade.\n\nBoat on the Mekong River\n\nOne of the most popular activities among tourists visiting Thailand‚Äôs Golden Triangle is to take a boat tour on the Mekong, which allows to have a closer look at Myanmar and Laos land, and even stop in Laotian territory to stroll at a small local market (just a few souvenir stalls).\n\nThe standard tour lasts about an hour, and can be done by speedboat (500 THB/boat ‚Äì up to 4 passengers) or by roofed slow boat (1000 THB/boat ‚Äì up to 10 passengers). We certainly recommend the second option, less noisy and more comfortable. If you want to take a longer or different tour, you can negotiate with one of the local boatmen.\n\nThe Opium Museums: Hall of Opium and House of Opium\n\nIn Sop Ruak there are not one, but two museums dedicated to opium, and it is important not to mistake one for another since, although both are recommended, they are very different: one is old and quite discreet, the other modern and just amazing.\n\nThe House of Opium (THB50) is a small museum located in the very center of Sop Ruak, making good use of its small space to inform about the history of the opium trade in the region (explanatory posters are in English), and display a bunch of opium-related objects.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hall of Opium (200 THB; open Tuesday to Saturday from 08:00 to 16:00) is a large museum located 2 km. north of Sop Ruak, and is undoubtedly one of the most modern and spectacular museums in all of Thailand.\n\nWhen I visited the Hall of Opium in 2015, I was lucky to have it practically all to myself, and I was impressed by the careful information and the quality of its exhibition rooms, with videos, photos, dioramas and the accurate recreations of all kinds of spaces and figures related to opium. Reserve a couple of hours for the visit, because it is really worth it!\n\nMae Sai: the Burmese border\n\nLess than 30 km northwest of Sop Ruak is Mae Sai, the northernmost town in Thailand.\n\nIt is advisable to take a walk through the bustling market area, a set of alleys with all kinds of shops, where you can take a break with a cold drink in one of its small cafes.\n\nAfter visiting the market, you can take the path that starts behind the market and climbs up to a Buddhist monastery located on top of a hill, which offers good views over Myanmar.\n\nFrom Mae Sai it is even possible to cross the border through the bridge that leads to the Burmese town of Tachilek, in Myanmar‚Äôs Shan State. At the border post you can get a permit ($ 10 USD) that allows you to visit Tachilek for a few hours, which you can spend visiting the Chinese market or the huge golden Shwedagon pagoda, also on a nearby hill offering excellent views.\n\nIn any case, Thailand‚Äôs border policies vary very often, and you must obtain up-to-date information to ensure that on the time of your visit it is allowed to cross to the Burmese side.\n\n2-Day Golden Triangle Tour from Chiang Rai\n\nWe suggest a 2-day/1-night circular route through Thailand‚Äôs Golden Triangle to get to know the region, starting and ending in Chiang Rai, which can be done either independently by renting a car or motorcycle (only recommended for experienced drivers!), by renting private transport with driver or by hiring an agency tour.\n\nIt is also possible to do this route by public transport, combining songthaew (local transport) and bus. But the vehicles that cover some of the routes involved have few daily departures, and it would be necessary to add an additional day (besides lots of patience and a strong desire for adventure) to complete the route.\n\nDay 1: Chiang Rai ‚Äì Mae Sai ‚Äì Chiang Saen (via Sop Ruak)\n\nChiang Rai ‚Äì Wat Tham Pla (52 km): starting from Chiang Rai, you can stop 13 km before reaching Mae Sai to visit Wat Tham Pla (literally the ‚Äúfish cave monastery‚Äù), immediately west of Ban Tham Pla town.\n\nIt is a curious monastery in an area crowded with monkeys, with a large pond full of carps, a cave-sanctuary and good mountain views, in addition to the colorful statues and monuments typical of Thai Buddhist temples.\n\nWat Tham Pla ‚Äì Mae Sai (13 km): in Mae Sai you can stroll through the Market, the central streets around the border crossing with Myanmar, and climb the path that leads up to the hilltop monastery Wat Pha That Doi Wao.\n\nMae Sai ‚Äì Chiang Saen (37 km): after eating in Mae Sai, you can continue on your way to Chiang Saen, passing by Sop Ruak, as it is a quieter and more pleasant place to spend the sunset.\n\nIn Chiang Saen there‚Äôs accommodation options for all budgets, from simple guest houses to the luxurious Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp & Resort. In any case, don‚Äôt miss dinner at the local food stalls by the Mekong River.\n\nDay 2: Chiang Saen ‚Äì Sop Ruak ‚Äì Chiang Rai\n\nChiang Saen ‚Äì Sop Ruak (8 km): After visiting Chiang Saen Market and the main ruins of its golden age, drive north to nearby Sop Ruak, where you can enjoy the views over the three countries, visit the Hall of Opium museum and, after lunch, take a boat trip on the Mekong River.\n\nSop Ruak ‚Äì Chiang Rai (70 km): it will be time to say goodbye to the Golden Triangle and return back to Chiang Rai, with the satisfaction of having known another beautiful region of Thailand that, despite preserving few traces of the opium trade that made it famous, will leave you a great memory."
