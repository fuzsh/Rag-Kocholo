        "text": "Chiang Mai is one of the largest and busiest cities in Thailand, second only to the beating heart of the nation — Bangkok.\n\nWhile its noisy streets and metropolitan feel are some of its biggest charms, the city is also the perfect jumping-off point to explore more of northern Thailand.\n\nThose seeking a nature fix can make their way up the towering Doi Inthanon mountain or kayak leisurely down the Ping River, while culture lovers will be itching to meet the hill tribes that are scattered in the surrounding regions.\n\nLeave the city behind on a day trip from Chiang Mai to experience Thailand in its full glory, from its exquisite elephants to its breathtaking Buddhist temples.\n\nDoi Inthanon National Park\n\nDoi Inthanon National Park surrounds the mountain of the same name, which measures over 2,500 meters and is nicknamed the “roof of Thailand.”\n\nCovering almost 500 square kilometers across the northern stretch of the country, the reserve is extremely diverse with an abundance of cloud forests and traditional hill-tribe villages.\n\nOn an excursion to Doi Inthanon National Park, you can ascend Thailand’s tallest mountain and gain an unbeatable view over the rolling hills of the Chiang Mai region.\n\nTrek along the park’s most celebrated hiking trail to journey into the clouds, where you’re sure to feel as though you’ve reached heaven.\n\nAlternatively, seek out the wide range of unusual flora and fauna in the area, including serows, and ashy-throated leaf warblers.\n\nElephant sanctuaries\n\nThailand is home to over 6,000 Asian elephants and the gentle giants are the country's national animal. Despite the respectful title, elephants have been severely mistreated throughout history in the war, logging and tourism trades.\n\nRecently, many elephant sanctuaries have popped up across the Chiang Mai region to rescue and provide respite to the overworked mammals.\n\nOn an elephant sanctuary day trip, you'll have the opportunity to view these majestic beasts up close, as they live out their remaining days in paradise.\n\nPrepare a fresh snack to feed the elephants straight from your hand or attempt to bathe them as they splash around in muddy pools.\n\nYou'll discover the special bond that the elephants share with each other as they lounge together in the sun and forage through the wilderness.\n\nMost importantly, you'll learn how to preserve these spectacular beings and why they shouldn't be used for entertainment purposes.\n\nDoi Suthep\n\nDoi Suthep is a 1,600-meter mountain that dominates the landscape to the west of Chiang Mai. While this natural landmark is impressive, its eponymous temple is what attracts flocks of tourists and locals to the area each year.\n\nSituated atop verdant slopes, Doi Suthep is a Buddhist temple that was originally built in the 14th century and is spiritually significant to the Thai people.\n\nLegend tells that the site is home to Guatama Buddha's shoulder bone, which was supposedly found by a devout monk and exhibited magical properties.\n\nThere is a lot to be admired on a day tour to Doi Suthep, from the gold embellishments of the temple's exterior to its Hindu and Buddhist statues within.\n\nChiang Rai temples and Golden Triangle\n\nFrom all-white creations to sapphire-blue religious monuments, Chiang Rai is a spiritual destination, full of fascinating and unique temples.\n\nThe region also boasts the Golden Triangle where the three nations of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos all meet along the Mekong River.\n\nOnce known as a drug haven of opium, these lands are now visited primarily by tourists, wishing to admire the dazzling scenery surrounding the river on all sides.\n\nExcursions to the Chiang Rai temples and Golden Triangle take you on a whirlwind tour of the city’s most significant sites, including the Blue Temple, and White Temple.\n\nSome day trips also escort you to other intriguing spots around the city, including the Baan Dam Museum, which features taxidermy art, and the tranquil Mae Khachan Hot Springs.\n\nLampang\n\nThe Lampang province of northern Thailand is a melting pot of staggering natural beauty and historic monuments. Its main city — also named Lampang — retains its traditional charm and its name refers to the horse-drawn carriages that still line the town’s streets.\n\nSome Lampang day tours deep dive into the past of this quirky city, from its ancient temples to its iconic street art.\n\nHere, you can get lost in traditional markets and discover the artisanal craft of pottery that is cemented in the city’s history.\n\nAlternatively, gain a broader view of the province and visit its rural villages, and astounding national park — home to a myriad of exotic birds.\n\nChiang Dao\n\nChiang Dao is a hidden gem, nestled deep within the heart of the Chiang Mai region and is the ideal place to visit if you’re seeking some rest, and relaxation from the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\nIn this district — nicknamed “little Tuscany” — you can reconnect with nature fully and fill your lungs with the fresh air of the countryside. Day trips here are perfect for adventure enthusiasts, with plenty of options for outdoor activities.\n\nYou can challenge yourself to a 3-day hike through the mountains, meeting several of the region’s 12 hill tribes along the way. Alternatively, grab a paddle and kayak down the Ping River or cycle through the Chiang Dao Valley.\n\nChiang Dao Cave is another must-visit destination, with over 10 kilometers of stalactite caverns to weave your way through.\n\nAs you follow the twists and turns of each passage, you’ll learn all about its odd legends, including a 1,000-year-old cave dweller.\n\nLamphun\n\nHistory buffs should not miss an opportunity to discover the ancient town of Lamphun, founded in the 7th century by Queen Chama Thevi during the Hariphunchai era.\n\nWhile the town — located just south of Chiang Mai — has grown and adapted over the years, it still retains its historic significance.\n\nExcursions to Lamphun visit a whole host of notable temples, including the wat dedicated to her majesty. The queen’s remains can still be found on this site over 1,300 years later.\n\nWat Haripoonchai is another momentous spot to visit on a day trip to Lamphun and is the location of the world’s largest bronze gong.\n\nYou’ll spend a day in Lamphun in constant awe of the intricate architecture, deep historical ties and religious roots that form the town.\n\nAraksa Tea Garden\n\nTea leaves are just one of the many crops grown in the northern region of Thailand, alongside rice and sugarcane.\n\nWhile you may be more used to seeing your tea neatly packaged in a bag, ready for drinking, day trips to Araksa Tea Garden help you to understand where your beverage comes from.\n\nThe plantation was among the first of its kind established in the country in 1939 and has been growing organic Assam ever since."
