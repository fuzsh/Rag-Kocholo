        "text": "District in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand\n\nKhong Chiam (Thai: โขงเจียม, pronounced [kʰǒːŋ tɕīam]) is the easternmost district (amphoe) of Ubon Ratchathani province of Thailand.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area of the district was the central district khwaeng of Mueang Khong Chiam, which is now Si Mueang Mai district. On 1 January 1957 the three tambons Khong Chiam, Huai Yang, and Pho Klang were split off from Khong Chiam to form the Ban Dan minor district (king amphoe).[1] On 11 December 1959 it was elevated to a full district.[2]\n\nOn 14 September 1971 the district was renamed \"Khong Chiam\", while the former district Khong Chiam was renamed \"Si Mueang Mai\", as the historical center of Mueang Khong Chiam was in this district.[3]\n\nIt is thought that the name Khong Chiam comes from the word khong (โขง) meaning 'chief of elephants' or 'herd of elephants' (khlong; โขลง in Thai) and chiam (เจียม) from the word chiang (เจียง), which means 'tribute'. Overall, it can be meaning 'city with elephants live together in large herds'.[4]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nNeighboring districts are (from the south clockwise) Sirindhorn, Phibun Mangsahan, and Si Mueang Mai. To the east across the Mekong River are the Laotian provinces of Salavan and Champasak.\n\nKhong Chiam is the easternmost point of Thailand.\n\nThe Pak Mun Dam stops the Mun River before it empties into the Mekong River in this district.\n\nThe Kaeng Tana and Pha Taem national parks are in Khong Chiam District.\n\nAdministration\n\n[edit]\n\nThe district is divided into five sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 50 villages (mubans). The township (thesaban tambon) Ban Dan covers parts of tambon Khong Chiam. There are a further five tambon administrative organizations (TAO).\n\nNo. Name Thai name Villages Pop. 1.
