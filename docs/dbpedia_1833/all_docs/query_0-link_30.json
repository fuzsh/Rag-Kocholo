        "text": "In Thailand, any form of tourism that is associated with local and/or indigenous communities is treated as community-based tourism, regardless whether they have actively participated in its development and management and/or if the communities have collectively benefitted from it. Furthermore, community-based tourism is often referred to by several terms, which are used with neither distinction nor agreement. Its definitions or variations of its definitions mostly describe the phenomenon, the objectives, or its principles. This manuscript looks at the characteristics of community-based tourism as it pertains to Thailand, and proposes the adoption of an operational terminology relevant to the practices observed without compromising its principles. Given that community-based tourism and associated terms in Thailand are viewed as complex and confusing, an operational definition will allow a better characterization of community-based tourism, assist in achieving its objectives, and possibly work towards its accreditation. Moreover, an operational definition will allow consumers, partners, investors, and other interested parties to distinguish it from similar forms of tourism.\n\nABSTRACT This study aimed to assess the potential of convention and exhibition centers along with their facilities in the context of the international convention industry in Thailand. Satisfaction measurements were conducted especially in Bangkok areas in order to measure the potential and competitiveness of the industry. Satisfaction factors were used as a tool to evaluate the potential and satisfaction of the participants and organizers using the convention and exhibition centers. Regarding the findings, it was found that convention and exhibition centers in Bangkok, Thailand had a potential that satisfied international participants and organizers. Physical attributions of each venue were the major factor to distinguish the level of satisfaction. Apart from the characteristics of the meeting facilities which were particularly important, it was found that the cooperation between the public and private sectors was a crucial tool to the increase of the level of competitiveness of the industry. Key Words: convention and exhibition stakeholders, satisfaction on convention and exhibition center, convention and exhibition centers in Bangkok."
