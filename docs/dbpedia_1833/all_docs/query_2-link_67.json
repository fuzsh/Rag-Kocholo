        "text": "Yogis and travellers have been flocking to Thailand for retreats and yoga teacher trainings the last couple of years, for good reasons. The white sandy beaches, the tropical weather, the colorful food and the many things to see are just some of them.\n\nStart your trip experiencing the famous full-moon party in Koh Phangan, feel the beat of Thailand’s most populated city in Bangkok, and end it on a white beach in Koh Samui, sipping a coconut drink with nothing but water in front of you.\n\nThe affordable prices are just one of many draws to this place. A luxury yoga retreat with *real* thai massage (!) won’t leave you in depth or guilt when you’re doing it here.\n\nIf you’re planning your very first trip to Thailand or if you’re a seasoned visitor, we’ve collected the very best “must see” places, from north to south.\n\nBest Things To Do in Northern Thailand\n\nThe best spots to visit in Northern Thailand are centered around adventurous mountain city Chiang Mai. Travelers looking for culture, shopping, or outdoor nature adventures will be thrilled by Chiang Mai’s unique offerings.\n\nAs with most populous cities in Asia, the roads in Chiang Mai can resemble a honking ball of tangled yarn. So expect an exciting combination of hectic city living, a thriving tourist industry, and unique cultural gems tucked around every corner.\n\nIf you choose to make Chiang Mai your home base as you explore Northern Thailand, you have plenty of options for hotels, restaurants, activities, and wellness retreats.\n\nExperience white-water rafting just outside of Chiang Mai for a unique, adventurous and extra-engaging way to take in the beautiful mountain scenery.\n\n1. Browse the Chiang Mai Night Market\n\nThe Chiang Mai Night Bazaar is a must-see while visiting this exciting city. It’s the perfect place to check any souvenir shopping, sampling of local Thai delicacies, and bartering with street vendors off your bucket list.\n\nChiang Mai Night Bazaar, Chang Moi, Mueang Chiang Mai District, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand. Street vendors open 6:00pm-12:00am Monday-Sunday\n\n2. Ring in the Thai New Year – Songkran-Style\n\nAdditionally, if you plan to visit Northern Thailand during the month of April, you won’t want to miss Songkran, the famous Thai New Year holiday festival.\n\nIt’s an important date in the Buddhist calendar, and this predominantly Buddhist nation celebrates by honoring elderly relatives, visiting temples, and making a splash.\n\nActually, though.\n\nTo celebrate Songkran each year, Thailand hosts a nation-wide water fight.\n\nJust picture: children and adults in the streets, throwing buckets of water on one another and busting out the water guns to soak their friends.\n\nChiang Mai is known for hosting the most fun Songkran water fight festivities. Bangkok and the nearby Pattaya Beach will also have some big Songkran parties, but many Thai people will leave these cities to visit family over the holiday, so the festivities are mainly populated by tourists.\n\nIn Chiang Mai, however, the streets fill with locals and tourists alike, all getting soaked together.\n\n3. Revel in Nature’s Beauty at Chiang Dao\n\nIf limestone cliffs and caves are your thing, you have to check out Chiang Dao, a small jungle village roughly an hour and half drive from Chiang Mai (a reasonable bus trip, or trek to make in a hired taxi or private car if you don’t mind paying a bit extra).\n\nChiang Dao features an important temple, or wat, and one of the deepest limestone caverns in all of Thailand.\n\nWhere to Stay in Chiang Dao: Malee’s Nature Lovers Bungalow, 144/2 m. 5 Ban Tham, เชียงดาว (Chiang Dao), Chiang Dao District, Chiang Mai 50170, Thailand. Starts at $36 USD per night.\n\n4. Visit The Elephants in Thailand\n\nA major favorite for tourists visiting Thailand? Getting up close and personal with everyone’s favorite pachyderm: elephants!\n\nIn recent years, tourists throughout Southeast Asia have become more conscious of the widespread mistreatment of elephants in the tourism industry. After learning of the violent treatment required to “domesticate” a wild elephant, a ride on the back of a tortured animal doesn’t sound quite so fun.\n\nHowever, it’s important to keep in mind that unethical elephant tourism is still practiced today. You can still pay for rides on the backs of mistreated elephants, and for entry to unscrupulous elephant parks.\n\nIf you love elephants and yearn for a once-in-a-lifetime experience but don’t want to contribute to their abuse, you can visit a proper elephant sanctuary such as the Elephant Nature Park near Chiang Mai.\n\nThe Elephant Nature Park is a registered Thai nonprofit that helps rescue abused elephants, spread education about the dark aspects of elephant tourism, and operates as a nature sanctuary. On a visit to the Elephant Nature Park, you can bathe, feed, and spend time with rescued elephants in a natural and ethical way. The price tag may be a bit steeper than other elephant “activities,” so remember that you’re supporting elephant well-being, rather than funding elephant exploitation.\n\nIf floating by a river on an authentic bamboo raft sounds like an appealing way to experience the jungle, you can hire a bamboo raft at the Elephant Nature Park and float your way around the sanctuary.\n\nElephant Nature Park, 209/2 Sridom, Ruam Chai Alley, 50100, Thailand. Prices start at 2,500 THB (roughly 75 USD) per adult for a single day visit. Open: 9:00am-5:00pm Monday-Saturday\n\n5. Motorbike Your Way To Pai\n\nPai is another favorite destination in the Northern Thailand area. Its popularity among backpackers and other adventure-oriented tourists is largely due to its perfect location along the Mae Hong Son Loop – a four-day motorbike loop that starts in Chiang Mai and takes you on a stunning, winding mountain journey through Northern Thailand.\n\nPai is often called a “hippie haven” and has plenty of stunning views, as well as an exciting cafe culture and laid-back vibe.\n\nTo rent motorbikes for the Mae Hong Son Loop, check out Mr. Mechanic at 135/1 Ratchaphakhinai Rd. T.Sriphum Muang Chiang Mai 50200. Open 8:00am-6:00pm Monday-Sunday.\n\n6. Where to Eat in Chiang Mai (If You Don’t Do Meat)\n\nThese are the best vegan and vegetarian restaurants in Chiang Mai, so you can sample and savour traditional Thai delicacies, while sticking to a yogic diet that keeps the Earth happy.\n\nBee Vegan, 19 Suthep Rd, Tambon Su Thep, Amphoe Mueang Chiang Mai, Chang Wat Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand. Open 11:00am-9:00pm Monday-Sunday\n\nAnchan Vegetarian Restaurant, Hillside 2 Mueang Chiang Mai District, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand. Open 11:30am-8:15pm Monday-Sunday\n\nPun Pun Organic Café, Su Thep, Mueang Chiang Mai District, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand. Open 9:00am – 4:00pm Monday-Sunday\n\n7. Check Out The Best Yoga Retreats in Chiang Mai\n\nThese retreat centers also offer prime accommodation in Chiang Mai, so if you’re looking for relaxation or a break from the hustle and bustle of the tourist-packed attractions, spend a few days recharging off the beaten path with one of these incredible yoga retreats in Chiang Mai.\n\n4 Day Forest Bathing Retreat – A 5 Senses Journey in Thailand, Chiang Dao, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Starts at $447 USD per person. Available all year round.4 Day Bliss Yoga Retreat Relax & Recharge in Paradise, Thailand, Old City, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Starts at $399 USD per person. Available all year round.\n\nGetting There\n\nThe Chiang Mai International Airport (CNX) is easily accessible from neighboring Southeast Asian countries, and offers a multitude of quick, hourlong flights straight from Bangkok each day.\n\nYou can also take a train, or overnight bus from Bangkok. As with most city-hopping in Southeast Asia, your cheapest option is an overnight bus or train. However, if spending a bit more cash isn’t a problem, you can cut your travel time down to just an hour by choosing to fly.\n\nThis, of course, doesn’t include travel time to the airport, waiting in security lines at the airport, etc., all of which are important to consider when choosing how to travel within Thailand.\n\nBest Things To Do Near Bangkok\n\nBangkok, the famous capital of Thailand and the nation’s most populated city, is known for its high rise skyscrapers, array of temples and historically rich cultural sites, and diverse nightlife.\n\nWhere else in the world can you experience ancient temples, local markets, some of the world’s largest Buddha statues, a tour through historic canals, and finish your day off by sipping a cocktail at an atmospheric rooftop bar?\n\nOnly in Bangkok.\n\n1. Damnoen Saduak Floating Market\n\nTop places to check out include the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market, where you can experience the trading and bartering of everything from local household goods to souvenirs for the Land of Smiles, all atop watery canals! You can book a complete day tour that takes you on a 30-40 min boat ride from Bangkok, all the way into the market.\n\nDamnoen Saduak Floating Market, Damnoen Saduak, Damnoen Saduak District, Ratchaburi 70130, Thailand. Open 7:00am-5:00pm Monday-Sunday\n\n2. Chatuchak Weekend Market\n\nTo see what it’s really like in the largest market in all of Thailand, visit Bangkok’s Chatuchak Weekend Market, sometimes referred to as JJ Market. Over 10,000 shops, both indoor and outdoor with everything you could possibly wish for!\n\nChatuchak Weekend Market, Kamphaeng Phet 3 Rd, Lat Yao, Khet Chatuchak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10900, Thailand. Open 9:00am-6:00pm Saturday-Sunday.\n\n3. Grand Palace\n\nFor a hearty dose of Thai history, wander over to the Grand Palace centered in the heart of Bangkok. Although it’s currently closed for renovation, you might be able to see the Vimanmek Mansion, the largest teak structure in the whole world, on your tour of active and former royal residences in Bangkok.\n\nGrand Palace, Na Phra Lan Rd, Khwaeng Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Khet Phra Nakhon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand. Open 8:30am-3:30pm Monday-Sunday\n\nWhile exploring the rich and varied history of this Southeast Asian city, be sure to give the omnipresent canal network more than a passing glance. The canals once earned Bangkok the nickname “Venice of the East,” and were built by King Rama I to support and fortify the Grand Palace in the year 1782.\n\nIf you plan to make Bangkok your jumping-off point for day trips into the surrounding cities and cultural sites, you’re in luck. You will have plenty of activities to choose from, ranging from somber historical places of significance to wild party scenes full of interesting characters from all around the globe.\n\n4. Nam Tok Railway Station\n\nThe Death Railway, or the Burma Railway, was the infamous epithet of the railway built by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. It remains a site of significance because of the high death toll among the workers who built the railroad, many of whom were prisoners of war from the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States.\n\nReach the Nam Tok Railway station by car from Bangkok in under three hours. From there, you can ride a train on the actual railway connection that follows the same line, crossing the same bridges built by the prisoners of war and local workers.\n\nNam Tok Railway Station, Tambon Tha Sao, Amphoe Sai Yok, Chang Wat Kanchanaburi 71150, Thailand\n\n5. Pattaya Beach Walking Street\n\nIf you prefer a more lighthearted form of entertainment, you might be keen to pay a visit to Pattaya Beach. Imagine if Las Vegas and Bangkok got together and had a baby, and then dropped that baby off at a beachside resort to raise itself on pina coladas. That will give you a basic idea of tourist haven Pattaya Beach.\n\n(Maybe minus the implied Fetal Alcohol Syndrome…*cringe)\n\nIf you want to get in on the flashing lights and nightlife parties, then scoot over to Pattaya Beach Walking Street.\n\nPattaya Beach Walking Street, Muang Pattaya, Amphoe Bang Lamung, Chang Wat Chon Buri 20150, Thailand.\n\n6. Khao Yai National Park\n\nIf you’re not into the alcohol-induced debauchery, then consider a more wholesome and family-friendly day trip outside of Bangkok, the Khao Yai National Park should be high on your to-do list. It’s not unlike a Thai tourist Disneyland, and appears on many lists the best things to do in Thailand. Apart from the established tourist attractions (like wineries, petting zoos, staged castles, a Hobbit shire and sunflower field), there are also beautiful hiking trails and waterfalls to view.\n\nPB Valley Khao Yai Winery, 02/2 Moo 5, Mitraparp Road Payayen Pak Chong District, Nakhon Ratchasima, 30320.

The island is perfect for a daytime boat trip and features a gorgeous Buddhist temple and a village market full of delightful handmade terracotta pottery items.\n\nRajadamnern Stadium is the oldest boxing stadium in all of Thailand and a great place to take in a traditional Muay Thai-style boxing match.\n\nRajadamnern Stadium, Rajadamnoen Nok Rd., Pompab Satroo Pai, Bangkok 10200, Thailand. Tickets start at 1,000 baht (around $30 USD). Open Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday. Fights start at 6:30PM.\n\nIf you want to take a break from the tourist scene and experience what Bangkok is really like (i.e. really feel the hustle and bustle), then find your way to the Bangkok neighborhood Sala Daeng, where you’ll discover one of the busiest bridges and intersections in all of Thailand. You probably won’t want to spend more than a couple minutes here, but it’s a great way to truly understand the way many Thai citizens live.\n\nSala Daeng BTS Station (Train station), Silom, Khet Bang Rak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10500, Thailand\n\n1. Hang Out at the Rooftop Bars in Bangkok\n\nimage source\n\nWhether you’ve come to Thailand for a cultural backpacker-type experience, or you’ve come to stretch your travel budget further while enjoying the finer side of luxury travel, you will want to check out Bangkok’s rooftop bar scene at least once. Ride on up to the 63rd floor at Sky Bar, the Dome at Lebua State Tower to experience the familiar Bangkok rooftop bar from The Hangover II, or see our list of top bars below.\n\nSky Bar, the Dome at Lebua State Tower, 42/3 Si Lom, Khwaeng Suriya Wong, Khet Bang Rak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10500, Thailand.

Open 5:30pm-11:00pm.\n\n2. Ayutthaya Historical Park\n\nIf you’re interested in taking in as much Thai history and culture as possible, the city of Ayutthaya is another great day trip destination from Bangkok, and one of Thailand’s five UNESCO world heritage sites. The Ayutthaya Historical Park is the perfect place to go and see the fascinating almost 700-year-old ruins of the Kingdom of Siam’s once-bustling capital.\n\nAyutthaya Historical Park, 4 196 Khlong Tho Rd, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya District, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya 13000, Thailand. Open 8:30am-6:00pm Monday-Sunday. Entrance to temples 50 Baht (roughly $1.50 USD)\n\n3. Eat the Best Street Food in Bangkok\n\nIf you can easily envision yourself on a walk down a crowded Bangkok lane and stopping for a quick bite to eat, you’re right on target.\n\nBangkok is consistently named in the world’s top cities for food lovers. The street food in particular, draws crowds of tourists and locals alike.\n\nChances are, you’ll find small, modest stalls serving up aromatic portions of soups, freshly-grilled fish and meat, and all kinds of fried noodle and rice dishes wherever you go in Bangkok.\n\nIt’s not *at all* like finding a needle in a haystack. (It’s more like finding a straw of hay in a haystack.)\n\nIf meat isn’t yo’ thang, don’t worry. It isn’t too hard to find a stall that will hold off on the animal protein. (Although designated meat-free utensils and cooking equipment is a rare find when it comes to street food, as is the widespread usage of fish-based sauces, so if you’re highly sensitive it’s best to find an all-vegetarian restaurant to satisfy your cravings. Download the Happy Cow app for global suggestions, or check out centrally-located May Veggie Home and VEGANERIE Concept.)\n\nMay Veggie Home, 8/3 Sukhumvit Soi 16 (Asoke-Sukhumvit Intersection) Ratchadapisek Road Klong Toei Bangkok 10110, Thailand (Near Terminal 21 Asoke), Open 11:00am to 10:00pm Monday-Sunday.\n\nVEGANERIE Concept, 35, 1 Sukhumvit Rd, Khwaeng Khlong Tan, Khet Khlong Toei, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand, Open 10:00am to 10:00pm Monday-Sunday.\n\n4. Visit the Best Temples in Bangkok\n\nThe magical temples in Bangkok brings a unique atmosphere to the capital and is a must for the cultured person. If you can, go early in the morning before it gets too hot. Then you’ll also have space to explore in peace and quiet, before the tourists wake up. Also note that most temples are not open for visitors after 6pm.\n\nWat Pho, Temple of Reclining Buddha2 Sanam Chai Rd, Khwaeng Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Khet Phra Nakhon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand. Open 8:00am- 17:00pm. Entrance fee of 100 Baht (2.60 USD), and you can also have a massage inside the temple.\n\nWat Phra Kaew, Temple of Emerald BuddhaNa Phra Lan Rd, Khwaeng Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Khet Phra Nakhon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand.

Entrance fee of 100 baht (2.60 USD)\n\nGetting There\n\nAround 20 miles to the east of Bangkok city is the Suvarnabhumi International Airport, enabling you to fly straight into Bangkok and start your adventures there. The budget airlines will fly and leave from Don Muang, an older airport around 12 miles from the city.\n\nFrom the airports you’ll take a train, an express bus or—probably the most convenient and still very cheap—an airport taxi for around $7.50. Make sure to insist on the the driver using the meter though! There will also be bus option to take you to the city from the airport, but those are veeeery slow and you won’t save a lot more money.\n\nIf you’re going to Bangkok from another destination in Thailand, flying is your best bet.\n\nYou can also go to Bangkok by rail, arriving at Hualamphong station (or Bangkok Train Station), connecting you with the MRT underground system that is the main transportation in Bangkok.\n\nBest Things To Do in Southern Thailand\n\nSouthern Thailand is climatically split in two, with the Gulf of Thailand in the southeast and the Andaman Sea in the southwest. The two regions have different monsoon cycles, which means that even if it’s monsoon in one of the regions, you’ll be able to find a clear sky and sun in the other region…\n\n…making Southern Thailand an ideal vacation spot year round.\n\nThe key cities in southern Thailand are Phuket, Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan, and Kho Phi Phi. It’s also surrounded by dozens of tropical islands that are perfect for day trips or island hopping.\n\nWhile Phuket offers a lively nightlife with plenty of tourists and international happenings, the smaller islands like Ranong, Phang Nga, Krabi Trang, and Satun, will bring you quiet, solitude and space to explore the beautiful nature in your own pace.\n\n1. Experience Phuket\n\nA third of all the tourists visiting Thailand will find their way to Phuket! Never-ending parties as well as the most dreamy beaches with snorkeling and scuba diving.\n\nThe nightlife is one of the best and it’s the perfect starting point to explore the surrounding islands and beaches. If you don’t mind the flood of tourists, this place will have everything you need.\n\nBecause of all the tourists, it’s a bit more pricey than what you might be used to in Thailand, but you’ll be too busy exploring and adventuring so you might not even notice!\n\n2. Tour Khao Sok National Park\n\nNorth of Phuket you’ll find Khao Sok National Park with a millions-of-years-old rainforest.\n\nWhile most parts of Thailand are filled with tourists and beaches, this place offers a different landscape off the beaten path. The best option is to explore the national park with a tour guide, leading you through the jungle reservoir to experience the wildlife, waterfalls, and animals like a true explorer.\n\nKhao Sok National Park, 62 Khlong Sok, Phanom District, Surat Thani 84250, Thailand.\n\nOpen 7:00am–7:00pm.\n\nYou can book a one-day or two-day tour trip from €66, in a smaller group or private. Most tours include transfers from Phuket, Krabi, Khao Lak, Surat Thani, Khanom or even Koh Samui, so you can forget about the hassle of Google Maps for once and just enjoy the ride!\n\n3. Cruise Through Ao Phang Nga National Park\n\nBetween the towns of Krabi and Phuket, you will find the Phang Nga Bay, which is a must to visit for James Bond fans since this is where some of the scenes were filmed!\n\nHere you’ll also find the unique limestone formations that are more than Instagram-worthy. You can take boat tours around the spectacle which is a relaxing way to explore the unique caves and beaches with ease.\n\nThe easiest way to get to Phang Nga Bay and the surrounding islands is by taxi (fairly pricey) or train. The State Railways of Thailand operates a daily train service from Bangkok to Surat Thani, where you will take a two hour bus ride to Phang Nga.\n\nEven easier might me to take a rental car from Phuket, which also enables you to stop and discover all the treasures on the way. Driving by yourself would take around one and a half hours from Phuket.\n\nAo Phang Nga National Park, Thailand.\n\nOne-day boat tours start at €85.70, but you can also go island hopping by yourself.\n\n4. Chill Out on Ko Lipe\n\nWhen you finally need a break from the wild partying or tourist traps, Ko Lipe is the perfect island to resort to.\n\nHere you will find the most beautiful natural landscape surrounded by calming and quiet luxury resorts. Perfect to just treat yourself with a spa day or just relax by the water.\n\nThe best beaches to visit are the Pattaya beach and Sunset beach. Sunset beach is a popular attraction in the evening with the best possible view of the sun setting over the ocean.\n\nYou can also get some amazing snorkeling experiences here with 8 Mile Rock and Yong Hua Shipwreck as popular diving spots.\n\nThe easiest way to visit Ko Lipe from Phuket is by ferry or speedboat. You could also fly to Hat Yai, then take a bus to Pak Bara.\n\n5. Snorkel in South Thailand\\\n\nIf you’re an underwater person, the places to visit are Koh Phi Phi or The Similan Islands. They offer slightly different experiences but both are paradises for snorkeling fans.\n\nKoh Phi Phi is a little easier to reach and is perfect for a day trip. For the best snorkeling experience, hire a local boat guide to take you around the waters.\n\nThe Similan Islands are a group of 9 Islands in the Andaman Sea, famous for their picturesque white beaches, crystal clear waters, and colorful underwater life.\n\nIt’s less crowded than Phi Phi, so it’s the perfect destination if you like exploring more remote and quiet places full of wildlife. The Similan Islands are a little further away so it’s recommended to stay for at least a night in order to experience all it has to offer and be able to explore a few of the islands.\n\nThe Similan Islands are the most popular scuba diving spots in all of Thailand, so a scuba excursion will be an obvious MUST if that’s your thing.\n\nYou can easily get to Phi Phi from Phuket by ferry (around two hours) or speedboat (around 90 minutes). The boats and ferries depart daily from Rassada Pier.\n\nGetting to The Similan Islands is a bit more complicated. From Phuket, you can take a ferry, bus or fly to Khao Lak, which is around 20 min from Tab Lamu, where you will take a speedboat or ferry to The Similan Islands which take you another 75 min.\n\nThe travel from Phuket to Tab Lamu will take you around 2 1/2 hours, so, all in all, you would spend almost four hours getting there. This is why it’s recommended to stay for at least a night once you’re there because once you’re there you won’t want to leave!\n\n6. Visit the Best Yoga Retreats in South Thailand\n\nThere’s an endless amount of relaxing and rejuvenating retreats in South of Thailand. Most of them are circled around Koh Samui, but also out on the Similan Islands, Krabi and Phuket. Planning in a retreat while visiting the South is a perfect way to explore the surrounding areas from the comfort of a luxury and relaxing retreat accommodation!\n\n8 Day Reviving Weight-Loss, Fitness & Yoga Retreat, Thailand, Ko Samui, Surat Thani, Thailand. Starts at $255 per person. Available Dec – April.\n\n15 Day All-inclusive Weight Loss & Wellness Retreat, Koh Samui, Thailand. Starts at $1021 per person.

If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, you might spend half the year hiding from the cold and snow under a big jacket nursing a sore throat.\n\nYet at the exact same time, Thailand is flowering.\n\nNovember to February offer the best weather, and the rainy season starts sometime in June and ends in October.\n\nBut you know what? Even rain is surprisingly glorious in Thailand."
