        "text": "An epic list of all the best things to do in Koh Phangan, Thailand. Yes, there’s more to the island than just the Full Moon Party!\n\nKoh Phangan is a relatively small island in the Gulf of Thailand nestled in between Koh Tao and Koh Samui.\n\nYet it has everything you could wish for in a tropical island paradise: towering palm trees, white-sand beaches, coral reefs with exotic fish, and lush jungles filled with waterfalls all framed by the idyllic turquoise ocean.\n\nBut when most travellers think of Koh Phangan, they think of wild parties, neon paint and buckets full of alcohol.\n\nKoh Phangan is home to the famous Full Moon Party. Travellers from all over the globe flock to this island to dance the night away with other tourists.\n\nIf you are a true party animal, you may just have the best night of your life at the Full Moon Party.\n\nThis beach party is absolutely epic and so much fun, but many people focus on this party scene too much and overlook all the other amazing parts of Koh Phangan.\n\nThe Best Things to do in Koh Phangan\n\nWith this list of the best things to do in Koh Phangan, I hope to shed some light on the other fun activities and natural attractions of the island.\n\nSo even if you don’t drink and don’t like partying, you can still have an incredible time when you explore the island.\n\nYou can snorkel, hike, kayak, scuba dive, and enjoy all the best parts of Thai culture like eating street food, exploring temples, and getting a Thai massage.\n\nSo whether you are interested in the Full Moon Party or not, the beauty around Koh Phangan should not be missed on a trip to Thailand!\n\n1. Hike to Bottle Beach\n\nWith a reputation as one of the best beaches and a top Koh Phangan attraction, Bottle Beach is a true gem of Thailand’s gulf.\n\nLocated in the north of the island, the beach is pretty hard to get to but the one-hour trek through the jungle is a fun adventure.\n\nWear good walking shoes and plenty of bug spray, and you’ll feel like you really earned your relaxing beach day once you arrive on the white sands of Bottle Beach.\n\nThe hike begins at Coconut Beach on the north of Koh Phangan and is completely free!\n\nREAD MORE: Plan your trip to Thailand with our comprehensive travel guide!\n\n2. Stay at Indigo Coral House and Learn About their Amazing Sustainability and Refugee Projects\n\nThere are so many incredible sustainability and conservation initiatives happening in Thailand right now, and one of the main focuses of my most recent trip to the Land of Smiles was to learn about some of them.\n\nKoh Phangan has always been a hub for alternative thinking and eco-conscious travellers, and I was lucky enough to spend the day at place called Indigo Coral House to discover how they are giving back to their community.\n\nRun by the passionate duo Fatimah and Matteo, the accommodations, living areas and workshops at Indigo Coral House have been built using sustainable bamboo, and the construction methods have been refined to minimise the amount of non-renewable resources needed.\n\nTheir goal is to show local builders that bamboo is not only a fantastic construction material, but can be used to make funky, high-quality and beautiful designs too.\n\nThat’s not all they do at Indigo Coral House though. It has also become a haven for Burmese refugees who flee over the border to escape the current turmoil.\n\nNot only do Fatimah and Matteo offer a safe space for them to live, but they teach them art techniques such as leaf printing and weaving so they can create their own pieces and sell them at the markets to make an income.\n\nI had the most amazing day at Indigo Coral House and felt so welcome by everybody who calls the place home.\n\nA special thank you to Soemoechit who taught me leaf printing, Phyu Phyu Moe who cooked up the most delectable Burmese vegetarian lunch for me, and of course Fatimah and Matteo who took time out of their day to show me all that they are doing.\n\nYou can visit Indigo Coral House yourself to do art and bamboo building workshops, leaf printing, learn how to compost or just stay in some of the stunning bamboo bungalows and villas. Highly recommend if you’re coming to Koh Phangan!\n\nLocation: 8/65 moo 8 Koh Phangan Koh Phangan, Surat Thani 84280, Thailand\n\nWhatsApp: +44 793 165 0719\n\n3. Get a Thai Massage\n\nAfter spending a big day hiking around, diving and swimming, you might want to treat your body to a Thai massage.\n\nLet the experienced local masseuses knead, twist, and smooth the kinks out of your muscles and you’ll feel so refreshed afterward.\n\nThai massage is a highly revered traditional practice in the country, so you should definitely experience it at least once while travelling through Thailand.\n\nThis is a great way to relax when you visit Koh Phangan.\n\nREAD MORE: Extend your Thai adventures by jumping on the ferry and checking out what to do on Koh Tao!\n\n4. Take a Day Trip to Ang Thong National Marine Park\n\nThis protected archipelago in the Gulf of Thailand is a stunning oasis of natural beauty.\n\nFilled with hiking trails, limestone caves, towering cliffs, palm forests, coral reefs, sandy beaches, and much more, Ang Thong National Marine Park is a nature-lovers paradise.\n\nYou can only enter the marine park via a government-approved tour boat.\n\nLuckily there are plenty of great tour companies that offer day trips from Koh Phangan to Ang Thong.\n\n5. Visit Koh Ma\n\nA trip to Koh Ma should definitely be on your list of Koh Phangan sightseeing.\n\nThis tiny island is actually separate from Koh Phangan, but is connected to the main island by a sand bar that is visible at low tide.\n\nSo head to the northwest of the island at low tide and you can walk along the sand bar to Koh Ma.\n\nYou can also enjoy sunbathing on the sand bar and swimming in the ocean to escape the heat.\n\n6. Hike Khao Ra Mountain\n\nThis 627-meter high mountain is one of the best Koh Phangan attractions.\n\nHiking to the top will provide you with some amazing views, and the whole journey takes about 2-3 hours round trip.\n\nYou can hike the trail in sturdy sneakers or hiking boots, and be sure to pack lots of water and sunscreen.\n\nTo avoid the mid-day heat, try to hike in the early morning or late afternoon.\n\nKhao Ra is located near the north of the island and the hike is free.\n\nREAD MORE: Plan your best trip with these Thailand itineraries.\n\n7. Watch the Sunset from a Rooftop Bar\n\nThere’s something absolutely magical about watching the sunset from a tropical island.\n\nEven better is watching an island sunset up high at a rooftop bar so you can enjoy an incredible panoramic view.\n\nKoh Phangan has lots of rooftop bars and restaurants that make great vantage points for sunset. Here are a few of the best ones:\n\nSecret Mountain: Open 10 am to 9 pm\n\nAmsterdam Bar: Open 12 pm to 1 am\n\nThree Sixty Bar: Open 10 am to 12 am\n\n8. Go Scuba Diving\n\nScuba diving is definitely one of the best things to do in Koh Phangan, and the last time we visited proved exactly why!\n\nThe Gulf of Thailand is packed with gorgeous marine life, including tropical fish, manta rays, coral reefs, and more.\n\nAmong the best diving spots near the island are Samran Pinnacle, Hin Yippon, Koh Ma, and Ang Thong National Marine Park.\n\nSail Rock is arguably the best dive site in the entire Gulf of Thailand, so this is a great place to go and explore the waters.\n\nThe island has a few dive schools that can hook you up with gear or help you get your divers certification.\n\nPersonally however we recommend the absolute legends at H2O Diving in Thong Nai Pan.\n\nRun by the incredible couple Alis and Lee, these guys are a PADI 5-Star Center and have been operating since 2003.\n\nThey use a modern and comfortable speed boat to get out to the dive sites, and this means they can actually time their trips to avoid when all the other companies go out.\n\nFor example, Sail Rock is quite far from Koh Phangan meaning all the local companies go out in the morning. For H2O however, they go out after lunch.\n\nWhen I went out for my two dives with Lee, we were the only dive boat there. A pretty magical experience (check out my video below of what it was like).\n\nThe gear they use is new and well-maintained, the staff friendly and the service they provide is some of the most professional I’ve experienced from diving in over a dozen countries.\n\nI highly, HIGHLY recommend scuba diving with Lee, Alis and the team at H2O if going out in Koh Phangan.\n\n9. Chill out on Thong Nai Pan Beach\n\nOf all the Koh Phangan attractions, the beaches are undoubtedly one of the best reasons to visit/\n\nPeople travel from far and wide to stretch out on the velvety white sand and swim in the crystal-clear waters of the Thai islands, so make sure you squeeze plenty of beach days into your Thailand itinerary.\n\nWhile visiting Koh Phangan, head to Thong Nai Pan for the ultimate beach day.\n\nSoak in the sun or lie in the shade under a coconut palm. Splash in the water and collect seashells.\n\nTake plenty of photos because this beach on Koh Phangan’s northeast coast is truly beautiful.\n\n10. Visit Thong Sala’s Street Markets\n\nAs the main hub of Koh Phangan, Thong Sala is a bustling town with plenty of fun things to do.\n\nThe street markets are the town’s best attraction; tourists and locals both come together in the evenings to browse through the local goods and gorge on some delicious Thai food.\n\nThe Phantip Night Market opens every evening and has some of the best street food on the island.\n\nEvery Saturday, the main street of Thong Sala turns into a Walking Street Market, also known as the Thong Sala Night Market.\n\nAt Thong Sala Night Market, the streets become pedestrian-only as local vendors fill the road with their own stalls selling souvenirs, clothing, jewelry, and other homemade goods. There is also plenty of Thai food to eat!\n\n11. Watch a Movie at an Outdoor Cinema\n\nFor a fun night in Koh Phangan, head to the Moonlight Cinema.\n\nLocated near the night market in Thong Sala, this open-air movie theater is full of comfy pillows and plays a wide variety of new and old films.\n\nYou can buy snacks and drinks at the theater as well. It’s a highlight of many who visit Koh Phangan!\n\nLocation: 46 Moo 1, Chaloklum Rd. Thong Sala, Ko Phangan\n\nHours: 3 pm to 1 am (opens at 1 pm on weekends)\n\n12.
