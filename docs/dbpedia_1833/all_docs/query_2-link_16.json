        "text": "Among the best things to do in Bangkok is to discover this vibrant, colorful and chaotic capital of Thailand, this city that intoxicates the senses and captivates the soul and in November its offer of activities proves it.\n\nFrom participating in seasonal festivals, bathing in hot springs, cooking in a spring to following the fragrance of its flowery fields, in this article I present 10 activities to immerse yourself in the heart of Bangkok's culture among the most memorable experiences this city has to offer.\n\n1. Join the Bua Tong Festival in Doi Mae U Kho\n\nAs a sign that the cold weather is coming, the Bua Tong Festival arrives in Doi Mae U Kho, part of Khun Yuam district, Mae Hong Son province. The festival officially opens on the weekend of the first half of November, when Nang Phaya Sua Kronglas trees and Bua Tong flowers or Mexican sunflowers dye the landscape yellow.\n\nDuring the Bua Tong Blossom Festival a service center is made available to visitors, which in addition to providing a guide to tour over 2000 hectares of flowers, also offers amenities such as toilets, tents for rent for tourists who want to spend the night on the hill, the viewpoint with panoramic views of the Thung Bua Tong is enabled and simple restaurants with gastronomy and fresh drinks open their doors.\n\nAnd if you are still not convinced, hold on, how about flying in a hot air balloon to tour the flower fields of Bua Tong from the heights, it is possible among the flower fields, with a breathtaking scenery of the mountains in the background, and the good service of the people.\n\n2. Participate in the International Fireworks Festival in Pattaya\n\nAmong the best excursions from Bangkok is the Pattaya Fireworks Festival, one of the most spectacular and exciting events in the Thai capital thanks to its meeting of cultures and array of activities.\n\nThe festival includes a series of fireworks shows on two nights, with live music with international and local guests such as those from Bangkok's most famous art studio Tiger Drum. You can also enjoy the traditional Muay boxing show and even have the opportunity to treat your taste buds to one of Bangkok's best food tours, the program is not to be missed.\n\nThis festival often attracts pyrotechnic teams from all over the world, who light up the night sky of Central Beach Pattaya with a delirious play of multicolored lights. When is the event? During the last two weeks of November, the specific days vary annually so I invite you to visit their website.\n\n3. Enjoy the Christmas Tree Festival\n\nYou might say it's a bit early to celebrate Christmas Eve, but in Thailand the last week of November kicks off the Christmas Tree Festival, an event where Phu Ruea National Park displays its winter wonderland dressed in red, pink and white with millions of poinsettias or poinsettias in bloom.\n\nPhu Ruea district is best known as \"the city of beautiful flowers in three seasons\" and it's not for nothing. Just imagine a large flower garden in Thailand's largest poinsettia planting and distribution center, thanks to 121 kilometers of land where lanterns, ornamental lights and even a wooden windmill and delicate flowers will make you feel like you're on vacation in Europe. And if you're wondering about the price of the event, it'sfree!\n\nOrganize your visit to Phu Ruea National Park among your things to do and see in Bangkok in November when the temperature is milder to explore its trails on foot, motorcycle or bike. Find out all the details on their official website.\n\n4. Celebrate the Loy Krathong Festival of Lights\n\nLoy Krathong is a beautiful holiday not to be missed in Bangkok. \"Loi\" means \"to float\" and in essence on that day you float or symbolically blow away the energies of the previous year while enjoying nature and meeting new people who share your interests.\n\nThe event takes place on the full moon night in November, when the moon is brightest and the tides are highest. And the ceremony is simple, Thais go out at sunset and float small baskets with candles, incense and money on the banks of canals such as the one at Sukhothai Historical Park Lake in thanks for the previous year's fortune and as a petition to Phra Mae Khongkha, the goddess of water, for good luck in the coming year.\n\nThe lakes on that day usually look beautiful throughout Thailand thanks to the multitude of glowing candles dotting their course and the bright moon combined with various fireworks displays, this is the reason why many highlight this activity among their things to do in Bangkok at night.\n\nWhen participating in this event, keep your eyes on your basket until it is lost in the horizon. According to Thai legend, the longer you can follow its path with the candle burning, the longer your fortune will be with you the following year.\n\n5. Marvel at the emerald green of the Erawan Waterfall\n\nThis November, don't miss the emerald green water of Erawan Waterfall in Si Sawat district, Kanchanaburi province.\n\nNot far from Bangkok, you can see this beautiful waterfall with 7 levels, each with a name, namely 1st level Lai Kuan Rang, 2nd level Wang Matcha, 3rd level Namtok Cliff, 4.Level Akka Nang Phi Suea, 5th level Boer Mai Mai, 6th level Dong Pruksa, and 7th level Phu Pha Erawan.\n\nThis famous waterfall is flanked by lush vegetation and makes a stunning backdrop for any photo. Moreover, during the month of November, when the stream is clear, shimmering with its emerald green beauty, it is the perfect time to visit. Also, during your day trip from Bangkok you will be able to see another of **Thailand'**s popular landmarks.\n\nThis is the Death Railway, made famous by the 1957 movie \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\". You will have the opportunity to walk across the bridge and admire its breathtaking scenery, as well as take some time to see one of the traces of World War II up close.\n\n6. Visit Van Gogh's paradise in Thailand\n\nIf you like sunflower fields, or if you just feel like seeing one of the most beautiful cities in the world at its best, I recommend visiting Lopburi in November, its best time.\n\nIt is one of the oldest cities in Thailand that was rebuilt with the help of French architects in 1677. Nowadays, it receives more than one million people every year since it became a tourist destination thanks to the different landscapes it offers.\n\nFrom the endless flowery hillsides to its monuments such as the Phra Prang Sam Yot, the Prang Khaek temple, rice fields, cornfields, low mountains, the famous Wat Phra Sri Rattana Mahathat temple or the jumping monkeys.\n\nEvery year, during the last weekend of November, the Monkey Festival is held at the monument of Saint Phra Kan in the city of Lopburi, where a large number of tables are set up with buffet style food for the animals. The sunflowers are absolutely stunning and are the highlight of the festival.\n\nVincent Van Gogh was inspired to paint Sunflowers in the South of France because they were the flowers that represented gratitude, he wrote. Can you imagine what he would have painted if he had traveled through Lopburi province?\n\n7. Admire Pha Taem National Park from a natural hot tub\n\nThe Natural Jacuzzi is located in Pha Taem National Park in Phetchabun province and offers visitors spectacular views of mountains and waterfalls, but without a doubt the jacuzzi stands out.\n\nVisiting this park is a privilege that only a few have the luxury of enjoying. Before your trip, you should contact them in advance on their website or if you prefer, you can book with a local guide for convenience.\n\nPha Taem National Park was established as an ecotourism destination in 1992 by combining three smaller protected areas:Doi Phu Kha National Park, Huai Kha Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Kaeng Chet Khwae Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nThe trails in this protected area are beautiful, although being on the edge of cliffs, they are dangerous, for this reason the park has strict rules on the limit of the number of visitors allowed. But November is the best month to visit because these restrictions are relaxed, the weather is kinder, and with the rains left in October, puddles are no longer a danger on the trail. Not to mention that, with clear skies, the panoramic views are a blast.\n\nThe best thing about hiking in Pha Taem National Park is that there are so many different types of trails you can take! Whether you want to do an easy hike or something more challenging (and rewarding), there's an option for everyone here at this location before finishing with a dip in**\"The Natural Hot Spring**\" with the best views in the park.\n\n8. Follow the chrysanthemum and hydrangea trail in Chiang Mai Province\n\nThe first stop is the hydrangea flower field located at Khun Pae Royal Project Or Doi Inthanon in Chom Thong district. This is a place where time seems to stand still and traditions are preserved intact.\n\nUpon your arrival, the villagers will welcome you to their well-kept plantations. The place was always a jewel reserved for the locals, however, in recent years they created an ecotourism route and now it is their major livelihood. And why visit in November because the hydrangeas are fully grown so the scent and colorfulness of the place takes your breath away.\n\nAnother must-see is the Ban Am Long chrysanthemum field in Samoeng district. Here you can sip a fresh chrysanthemum juice, or enjoy an infusion if you prefer it hot while surrounded by some 32 hectares of these beautiful flowers that ripen in November. They will be ready for you to take home a souvenir, have your picture taken or just gaze at the dreamy panoramas.\n\nCheck out their official website and tour the most beautiful gardens in Chiang Mai.\n\n9. Attend the closing of the Lamphun Lantern Festival\n\nIn October the Lantern Festival kicks off in Lamphun town and in November the grand festival bids farewell until the following year with an exciting party where thousands of floating lanterns light up the night sky in a dazzling event in Bangkok.\n\nIn northern Thailand this festival is known as \"Yi Peng\". Yi means \"two\" and peng means \"full moon day,\" so it's easy to remember when to expect this festival: on a full moon.\n\nThe highlight of the Great Lantern Festival is Wat Phrathat Haripunchai Woramahawihan, where thousands of people come with their lanterns or decorated paper lanterns to worship a Buddha relic, adding a colorful touch to the event. And what is the origin of this celebration?\n\nIts origin is unknown, but in ancient times the god of fire was worshipped to illuminate the coming year and to invoke protection and prosperity in the following months. Nowadays there are not only lanterns, but also decorated boat cruises around Bangkok, singing and feasting.\n\nSo, if you are looking for adventure, enlightenment or just a chance to immerse yourself in the rich diversity of Thai culture in November, join the Lamphun Lantern Festival and discover the wonders this city has to offer.\n\n10. Take a dip in the Chae Son hot springs\n\nWith the rains behind us, it is the perfect time for outdoor activities, specifically to visit Chae Son National Park, where you can take a dip in its hot springs, walk along its trails or cook some boiled eggs in a natural spring. So or more diverse the range of activities?\n\nIn this park located in Lampang province, there are 9 natural hot springs spread over 768 kmÂ², with steam rising from the rocks creating a mist that covers the area. A popular activity for visitors is to cook quail eggs in the hot springs, although to be honest, this is a trip to relax and rejuvenate the skin with minerals from the springs that have an average temperature of 70 - 80 degrees Celsius.\n\nDon't miss the opportunity to visit at the best time of the year, November, when its caves, waterfalls, springs and trails can be enjoyed all day on foot or by bike in the glistening sunshine.\n\nWhat is the weather like in Bangkok in November\n\nNovember is one of the best months to travel to Bangkok. The maximum temperature will be 32 Â°C while the minimum will be 24 Â°C. At the end of this month, Bangkok usually has a small drop in temperature at night, when the Thai \"winter\" is approaching."
