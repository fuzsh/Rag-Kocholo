Caves\n\nTham Chang Cave\n\nVang Vieng is home to dozens of caves, in which, Tham Chang Cave (or other called as Tham Jang) is considered as the most famous one around Vang Vieng. This cave includes nature value with beautiful stalactites, rare stalagmites and history value as well. This is pretty cool inside. To reach the cave, you need to walk across the long bridge built across the Nam Song River, then climbing steep stairways up to the cave. A blue lagoon is a bonus thing here for you to swim in. You should better head there in the morning to beat the crowds during peak season.\n\nTham Phu Kham Cave & Blue Lagoon\n\nTham Phu Kham Cave is around 20 minutes west from Tham Chang and also a favorite spot in Vang Vieng as this is not only for cave interest (flashlight is necessary to explore the cave with steep climbs) but visitor can enjoy some fun activities at nearby blue lagoon such as swimming, jumping off from the tree into the water. However, the water color will be not blue when the rainy season comes (June-August) and often get crowded.

In dry season when the water level is low, you can walk into the cave. In rainy season, you will get inside the cave with a tube and a rope due to high water level and strong flow which can be more difficult when the darkness covers everything. For those who love adventure, it is worth changeling one time.\n\nNot far from Tham Nam is Tham Xang or other called as Elephant Cave because the special feature of the cave is an elephant-form stalactite which created the name of the cave. This is small in size so making combined tour with other should be more worthy than visiting itself only.\n\n2.

Adventure Experience\n\nHiking up to mountain viewpoints\n\nIf you are looking for an amazing viewpoint of Vang Vieng, head to Phangern Mountain – hiking to the top is one of the best things to do. The hike up isn’t well-paved so you will need to wear proper shoes & bring enough water with you. It can take you around 20 minutes or more each way depending on your health and breaks along the way.\n\nAnother stunning place to check out Vang Vieng from above is at Nam Xay viewpoint. This is slightly easier and shorter to get to the top with 360-degree views while reaching on it. However, you still need to be careful when towards the end the path can be muddy and slippery.\n\nTube & Kayak on Nam Song River\n\nVang Vieng is on the banks of the Nam Song, and no trip would be completed without experiencing the river first hand. Kayaking can be offered as part of a day tour that includes lagoons and caves. Tubing can also be arranged around town.\n\nBalloon Over VangVieng\n\nTaking a hot air balloon flight over Vang Vieng can be a relaxing way before you start a day of activities or after finishing them. The flight will offer beautiful rural scenery, clear river, green mountain and its famous limestone formations.\n\nSunrise flight starts at 5:30am-6:10am\n\nSunset flight starts at 5:30pm-6:10pm\n\nPlease check the availability, condition and policy in advance.\n\nQuintessence converges in Champasak\n\n1.

Si Phan Don\n\nSi Phan Don belongs to Khong District, including the islands and part of the mainland in the east, dotted with numerous islands, of which, Don Khong is the largest islands, following with Don Som, Don Det and Don Khon. The key features of the Si Phan Don archipelago include:\n\nKhone Phapheng Waterfall which is known as the Niagara of Asia and is the largest waterfall in Southeast Asia with a length of 12 km, offering the beautiful scenery;\n\nFreshwater Irrawaddy dolphins which are endangered species that can be viewed by boat off Don Khon island;\n\nThe remains of the first railway in Laos – the Don Det–Don Khon 7km long narrow gauge railway which was built by the French to bypass the Khone Phapheng Falls and travel along the Mekong River.\n\n5.
