        "text": "Visa Info & Notes\n\nVisas:\n\nThailand: Visitors holding passports of Australia, Canada, UK, US, certain EU countries plus citizens of other ASEAN member states receive an automatic 30-day entry stamp on arrival. Note this is a visa waiver rather than a tourist visa however obtaining a visa in advance or visa or arrival is consequently not necessary and there is no advantage in applying for an e-visa. (Rules may vary for stays over 30 days or multiple entries.)\n\nNot all European countries are covered by this scheme so passport holders from eastern European EU or non-EU nations are advised to check conditions with your consulate or embassy beforehand. You can also check current information on the Thai immigration website.\n\nLaos:30-day tourist visas are issued at the visa-on-arrival counters at international airports and mosty land entry points. These are available for most nationalities with the exception of certain African and Middle Eastern countries and require a passport photo along with $40. (You can check the list at this link.) Additionally, Lao e-visas are now available and will speed up arrival formalities.\n\nCambodia: Although a 30-day tourist visa is issued at the border, somewhat tedious formalities at this remote border crossing make obtaining a visa in advance or e-visa strongly advisable. (Cost is $36)\n\nThe visa on arrival is payable in $US and may vary slightly from country to country. Most European passport holders plus South African, Australian and NZ are charged $30 with the exception of Swedish who pay $1 more and British who pay an extra $5. US citizens are also charged $35 while, for reasons we can’t fathom, Canadians pay $41. (Note a $1 overtime fee is charged for public holidays, outside of standard office hours or whenever they feel like it.)\n\nAll: Your Thai entry point is Suvaranaphum International Airport (Bangkok) and exit point is Chong Mek. For the Lao section, the entry point is Vang Tao and exit point is Veun Kham. (Lao e-visas are not accepted at Vang Tao.) Despite some older information we’ve seen online, the Cambodian crossing point is Don Kalor and your exit point is Pochentong International Airport (Phnom Penh). Also, in contrast to some info we’ve found, Cambodian e-vias are now accepted at Don Kalor.\n\nPassport: Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Vietnam and Cambodia. You may be refused entry if your passport is damaged, in poor condition or does not have at least 2 blank pages remaining.\n\nTipping: We recommend a kitty system for the smaller, daily tips such as hotel/restaurant staff and local guides and drivers. Amounts inevitably vary with group size but would generally be in the region of $3-4 per person, per day. With regards to guides accompanying you for longer periods we’d recommend a separate tip of approximately $5 per person, per day though of course, this is always discretionary and performance-related. (Local currency or USD are fine.)\n\nMeals: Breakfasts are generally hotel buffets with lunch and dinners based on local food. Your tour leader will usually order a selection of dishes, local-style, while a number of meals are not included, which allows you to ‘do your own thing’ or take a break if you’re feeling ‘riced out’.\n\nAlthough you may assume Lao cuisine is little-known outside of Laos the fact that it’s hugely popular in neighbouring Thailand is a good reference and indeed many well-known Thai dishes such as the famous green papaya salad (som tam) and spicy minced pork salad (laap) are of Lao origin. Certain dishes can be pretty firey – though your tour leader can, of course, ask for them to be toned down – while the more Chinese and Vietnamese-influenced dishes, which will be more familiar to foreign travellers, being generally mild.\n\nBoth vegan and vegetarian diets are easily catered to.\n\nAccommodation: All choices fall into the comfortable 3* range and are en-suite and air-conditioned with, where possible, pools. We have posted a selection of sample accommodation on the lefthand hotel tab but please note that as we try and avoid the larger hotels, availability, in high season particularly, means we use several options in each destination."
