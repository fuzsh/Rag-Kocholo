        "text": "“For the young, travel is a part of education; for the old, it is a part of experience.”\n\nThese words by Francis Bacon demonstrate that travel is beneficial for people of all ages. It also denotes the idea that traveling gives immense benefits to the “younger sort” whose energy and desire to learn, explore and seek novelty is unparalleled.\n\nThailand’s geological landscapes and natural abundance provide the ideal environment that is perfect for young people to immerse themselves in all kinds of adventures. We suggest the following four activities for adventurers and thrill-seekers: ascending Thailand’s tallest peaks, stargazing at Dark Sky parks, ziplining through the jungle, and rock climbing with a 360-degree view of the Southern Sea.\n\nConquer the three tallest peaks in Thailand\n\nNorthern Thailand is a mountainous region with the highest peaks in the country. It is the ideal location for trekking and other adventure-type activities due to its year-round mild climate and dense forests. The top three highest peaks in Thailand – Doi Inthanon, Doi Pha Hom Pok, and Doi Luang Chiang Dao–are located in Chiang Mai and serve as regional landmarks.\n\nDoi Inthanon,\n\nlocated in Ban Luang, Chom Thong District, is the highest mountain in Thailand at 2,600 meters above sea level. At the summit, there is a panoramic view of the neighboring landscape. Here are the highlights of the event:\n\nSee the sea of mist at sunrise, and hike the Kew Mae Pan nature trail.\n\nVisit Khun Wang: see the wild Himalayan cherry (the “Thai Sakura”) blossom between December and January. And take a dip at Mae Ya Waterfall, the biggest waterfall in Doi Inthanon National Park.\n\nVisit rice terraces and learn about the Sgaw Karen and their lifestyle in Ban Mae Klang Luang.\n\nDoi Pha Hom Pok,\n\nlocated in Pong Nam Ron, Fang District is the second-highest peak in Thailand, with an altitude of 2,285 meters. This is one of the finest places in the nation from which to observe the sea of mist. Here are the activity highlights:\n\nTrekking: enjoy a 360-degree view of the stunning mountainous terrain and sunrise. The entire voyage is seven kilometers long and will require two days to complete.\n\nSee rare faunas and floras. Some species can only be found in Doi Pha Hom Pok including the Kaiser-i-Hind butterfly and rare birds such as the brown-breasted bulbul and the purple cochoa.\n\nStargaze in a relaxed ambiance at Kiew Lom, the highest campground in Thailand.\n\nDoi Luang Chiang Dao,\n\nLocated in Chiang Dao District, Doi Luang Chiang Dao has the highest peak at 2,275 meters above sea level. The vista from the summit, which overlooks Chiang Dao, is breathtaking. In 2021, Doi Luang Chiang Dao was designated by UNESCO as Thailand’s fifth and most recent biosphere reserve. Due to its biodiversity and rich vegetation, this pristine limestone mountain is home to many endangered species. Here are the activity highlights in Doi Luang Chiang Dao:\n\nTrek the well-preserved forest and see rare wildlife including the serow. The journey is 8.5 kilometers and takes two days to complete.\n\nThe highlight of the trip is Doi Kiew Lom’s picturesque limestone formations provide the trip’s most memorable moment.\n\nBathe in a hot spring at Ban Yang Pu Toh, take a dip in the nearby Huai Mae Ka natural stream, and visit Chiang Dao Cave.\n\nWhen to Visit and How to Get There\n\nTake a flight from Bangkok’s Don Mueang International Airport to Chiang Rai International Airport. Then drive or take public transport to each “Doi” or mountain. The road trip takes about 1-2 hours.\n\nThe best time to visit is the period between November to February when most flowers are in bloom and you will most likely see the sea of mist.\n\nFor more information on nature trails and trekking tips, please visit https://portal.dnp.go.th/\n\nWitness The Most Breathtaking Milky Way at Dark Sky Parks.\n\nAstronomy travel or dark sky travel is a new and increasingly popular travel experience. In Thailand, Dark Sky Star Party is held across the official 12 locations registered as Dark Sky Park. Astrologists, adventure travelers, and stargazers gather for a cozy camping experience while observing the night sky and learning about the history and distinctive natural landscape of each park. Pha Taem National Park in Ubon Ratchathani province, Huai Nam Dang National Park in Chiang Mai province, and Pa Hin Ngam National Park in Chaiyaphum province are examples of Dark Sky Parks. Here are some activity highlights:\n\nCamping and stargazing at night. Using cutting-edge telescopes, observe the starry sky, the Milky Way, supernova remnants, deep-sky objects, and other astronomical objects.\n\nVisit tourist attractions in various national parks where Dark Sky Star Party is held including the prehistoric paintings and Sao Chaliang (mushroom-shaped sandstone earth pillars) at Pha Taem National Park; the viewpoints along the Mekong River; Siam tulip fields and Lan Hin Ngam rock formations in Chaiyaphum province; and various waterfalls along the way.\n\nJoin a night nature walk and see the surrounding landscape at nighttime.\n\nFor more information about Dark Sky Star Party, please visit https://darksky.narit.or.th/ or check out the Facebook group Amazing Dark Sky in Thailand https://www.facebook.com/groups/amazingdarkskyinthailand/\n\nDark Sky Star Party\n\nTree Top Adventures in Phuket and Chiang Mai Will Raise Your Travel Experience to New Heights\n\nThailand’s natural beauty, which includes an abundance of forests, makes it an ideal destination for adventure travel. One of the most popular adventure-type activities in Thailand is ziplining in the wilderness. Hanuman World in Phuket and Flight of the Gibbon in Chiang Mai are therefore two zipline parks that will satiate your craving for an adrenaline rush.\n\nHanuman World, Phuket\n\nHave an action-packed day in this expansive forest in the middle of Phuket.\n\nSoar through the jungle with the zipline and the roller, which take you on an 800-meter zigzagging route.

Lead climbing is the technique used for climbing rocks in this area. Ascending with a rope and clipping into bolts filled into the rocks to protect from a fall, this type of climbing is exciting, fun, and suitable for both amateurs and professionals. Here are the main activity highlights in Railay:\n\nClimb towering cliffs of limestone mountains. There are different routes to choose from depending on your skill level. The climb takes about three hours. Once reaching the top, you can see the beautiful sunset with a 360-degree view of Railay View Point.\n\nKayak, swim, and sunbathe on the beach in Railay where the water is still and crystal clear.\n\nVisit Phra Nang Cave, where you can swim through caves into a lagoon located at the center of the mountain. Search for dusky langurs, a rare and protected species in Thailand which can only be found in Lailay Bay.\n\nWhen to Visit and How to Get There\n\nTake a flight from Bangkok’s Don Mueang International Airport to Krabi International Airport. Then drive or take public transport to Ao Nang, Mueang District, Krabi province. Take a boat to Railay Bay, which takes about 30 minutes.\n\nThe best time to visit is in March and July.
