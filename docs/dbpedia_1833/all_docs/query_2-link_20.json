        "text": "Looking for things to do in Khao Lak?\n\nIn this article, I walk you through the best of Khao Lak and how to travel this beautiful area. After spending years living on and off in Thailand, I want to share more about this hidden gem with you.\n\nWhen looking for a base to explore the gorgeousness of the Andaman Sea, Khao Lak may be a great option for people looking for something a little more low-key. Unlike its neighbors in Phuket, Khao Lak located in the Phang Nga province is a little less crazy and over the top.\n\nDepicted by a series of white sandy beaches surrounded by forested hills, Khao Lak is a place worth visiting and exploring. When the devastating tsunami happened in Thailand last 2004, the Khao Lak area was one of those areas that was badly hit.\n\nSince then, Khao Lak has made a full recovery, turning their area into a popular tourist destination and rightly so as Khao Lak beaches are some of the best in Thailand.\n\nDue to Khao Lak’s ideal location, it is a popular base to do day trips to the Khao Lak / Lam Ru National Park, Phuket, or the ever so popular Similan and Surin Islands.\n\nBetween it’s gorgeous laid back beaches, fantastic accommodation options, low-key restaurants, and fun activities, there is a little bit of everything in Khao Lak.\n\nThings to Do in Khao Lak\n\n1. Celebrate the Turtle Festival\n\nCelebrated every year during the first week of March, young turtle hatchlings are released back to the sea at beach. Volunteers are encouraged to come join in on the fun to help create awareness in the various turtle conservation projects that they have going on. The turtles often come to shore to lay their eggs between November to April.\n\nFor conservation purposes, the turtles are placed in a Nursery and incubated until they are large enough to release back into the Andaman.\n\nIf you are in Khao Lak during this time, a visit to the turtle conservatory or to the beach itself is a worthwhile effort. It is one of the few animal conservation places in the Pha Nga Province.\n\nWe recommend this bamboo rafting and turtle conversation tour.\n\n2. Go on a Biking Tour\n\nIf you read a lot of our articles, you would know that biking (and motorbiking) are one of our favorite ways to explore a place. Tom and I, recently did a bike tour around Koh Yao Noi, Phuket and loved it!\n\nSo to explore the best of Phang Nga province including Khao Lak, go on a half-day, full day, or even multi-day trips exploring some of the most beautiful countryside and mountainous scenery.\n\nMost of the cycling tours will take you around Khao Lak, through the beautiful forested areas, as well as to secluded waterfalls.\n\n3. Attend Cooking Classes\n\nAs most of you already know, I am addicted to Thai food and can’t get enough of it. Have a go at taking cooking classes in Khao Lak as you learn how to cook some of the best delicacies in their cuisine like Pad Thai and a few other stirfries.\n\nThey also have options for classes which include organic farm tours.\n\n4. Visit the International Tsunami Museum\n\nWhile you shouldn’t expect a full-blown museum with lots of memorabilia and exhibits, this place is still worth visiting (there are a few museums which had been set up apparently).\n\nA visit here is important in order to understand what the locals in Khao Lak and all of the Phang Nga province, went through as nearly all of them had family and friends which were killed or displaced during the tsunami.\n\nWhen the tsunami happened, there was little escape as the majority of Khao Lak’s land is flat. If you’re planning on visiting, there is the Baan Nam Khem tsunami memorial park as well as another memorial site where you can see a large Police patrol boat which was carried 1km in-land.\n\n5. Soak in Hot Springs\n\nAfter trekking through Khao Lak, reward yourself by soaking in some hot springs. Located in two different areas, the Kapong Hot Springs are located near Khao Lak Lam Ru while Ban Bor Dan Hot springs in located near the Thai Muang National Park.\n\nBoth hot springs have entrance fees so double check with your hotel to get the exact price. Visiting the hot springs are some of the best things to do in the Khao Lak area.\n\n6. Go Beach Hopping\n\nWhether you’re exploring Khao Lak independently or you are there for an all-inclusive holiday, visiting Khao Laks beaches is a must. Graced with mile-long beaches, beachgoers have lots of options for beach exploration in this part of Thailand.\n\nThe main strips of Nang Thong Beach and La On Village are popular spots due to their location. These places make up Khao Lak proper.\n\nLocated within the main shopping, dining, and nightlife area, these places are ideal for those who want to stay within walking distance to all the best accommodations and modern day comforts.\n\nKhao Lak Beach on the other hand, is located 5km away from La On and is a little bit more peaceful and local than it’s busy counterparts. Bang Niang Beach is in close competition with a myriad of accommodation facilities and restaurants popping up. A lot of the Khao Lak resort’s are in this area.\n\nIf you’re looking for other beaches in Khao Lak aside from Bang Niang to visit, consider venturing out to Hat Pakarang and Hat Bang Sak which are made up of sleepy white sandy beaches and thick mangroves. Another popular beach in the area worth visiting is Pak Week Beach as well as coconut beach.\n\nIf you want to arrange day trips from Khao Lak, one of the best things to do is hop on a boat to go island hopping. This tour takes you to the infamous James Bond Island for a fun day under the sun.\n\nIn short, there is no shortage of amazing beaches in Khao Lak to visit.\n\n7. Trek in Khao Lak National Park\n\nAs mentioned, exploring the great outdoors is one of the best things to do while in Khao Lak. Get lost in exploring the two national parks, Khao Lak Lam Ru National Park and Thai Muang National Park.\n\nLak Lam Ru is a 125-square-kilometer stretch of tropical jungles and forests where you can find waterfalls and other interesting trails where you can spot various types of wildlife.\n\n8. Visit Waterfalls\n\nBeing in Khao Lak is like one big nature trip. Stunning beaches, jungles, and waterfalls. To escape the heat, trade your palm trees for a few waterfalls as it is one of the best things to do in the area.\n\nA few of the best ones are Lam Ru, a five-tiered waterfall, as well as the Ton Chong Fah falls in Khao Lak Lam Ru.\n\nThe latter is a great spot for swimming if you need to cool down after trekking to the area. Both spots are stunning and worth visiting while you’re exploring Khao Lak. Shoes are recommended as some of the trails can get slippery.\n\n9. Explore the Night Market\n\nGoing to night markets is one of my favorite things to do while in Thailand. Going there to explore the different Thai dishes to sample, and goodies to buy is a great way to learn more about the local culture.\n\nLocated around 20 minutes away from Khao Lak’s main beach, this night market is in full swing every Wednesday and Saturday. This was a highlight for me while traveling the Phang Nga province.\n\nVarious trinkets and edible goods are for sale here. So go ahead and try a grasshopper (or two) while you’re there.\n\nRelated: Street Food in Thailand\n\n10. Go Wreck Diving\n\nWhile the nearby Similan Islands are the crown jewels of diving in Thailand, Khao Lak is home to a few shipwreck dives worth visiting. Sunken around the area are HTMS Pratong, Premchai, MV Sea Chart and finally, Boonsung, these ships are fun to explore as every surface and crevice of the ship is now home to various marine species.\n\nFrom shrimps, crabs, trevally, eels, and lionfish, this place is a great option for those who want to explore the local dive spots.\n\nAfter a dive, get a traditional thai massage and you won’t be sorry! There are many thai massage shops in Khao Sok, mainly near Khao Sok proper.\n\nThings to Do Near Khao Lak\n\n1. Visit Khao Sok National Park\n\nThis stunning national park is a breath of fresh air if you’re tired of seeing the many resort-laden beaches all over Thailand. Escape to nature and explore jungles, caves, and waterways in this national park established in 1980.\n\nThe entire park consists of a thick native rainforest, waterfalls, splendid limestone cliffs and an island stubbed lake.\n\nThere are many tours to Khao Sok National Park operating from Phuket and Khao Lak. Be wary though when joining a tour and make sure the company abides by ethical and sustainable practices.\n\nThis tour from Khao Lak to Khao Sok National Park makes it super easy to explore this beautiful place.\n\n2. Kayak Pha Nga Bay\n\nHome to the legendary caves and karsts made famous in the movie, Man with the Golden Sun, James Bond island is a must-visit for any of the tours coming from Khao Lak and Phuket.\n\nTake a kayak and paddle around some of the most beautiful limestone karsts and caves, enjoying the beauty of pristine waters and incredible scenery.\n\n3. Explore the Similan Islands\n\nTaplamu Pier, located in Khao Lak is the gateway to the Similan Islands. While many tour operators arrange visits to the Similan Islands from Phuket, a much cheaper alternative is doing it directly from Khao Lak. From here, snorkeling and diving trips can be arranged, taking you through some of the most marine-rich waters in Thailand.\n\nFor avid divers, Similan Island Liveaboards could also be something you can look at. Check out our article above for a comparative guide on the best Similan island liveaboard boats from budget to luxury.\n\nIf you travel by speedboat, the trip often varies from 1 hour to 1 hour and 20 minutes. Large ships often take 3-5 hours. If you’re on a budget, inquire about the National Park boat which takes around 4 hours. This is slightly cheaper than doing it through an agency.\n\nWhile there are loads more to see and do while in Khao Lak, we recommend just going there to see and experience it for yourself. Remember to be a responsible tourist.\n\nWhere is Khao Lak?\n\nKhao Lak is a beautiful coastal area in Phang Nga Province, southern Thailand, by the Andaman Sea. It’s about 100 kilometers north of Phuket and offers quieter beaches, lush forests, and easy access to Khao Lak-Lam Ru National Park.\n\nWe lived in Phuket just this year and everyone we met always headed to Khao Lak for a quick escape.\n\nHow to get to Khao Lak?\n\nIf you’re wondering how to get to Khao Lak, here are 3 main ways:\n\nKhao Lak by Plane: The fastest and easiest way to get to Khao Lak is to fly into Phuket airport or Krabi airport. From there you can take a taxi to Khao Lak. Both Phuket airport and Krabi, serve international and domestic destinations, plus run regular flights.\n\nPhuket international airport is the closest to Khao Lak as it is only around a 1 hour and 15 minute drive away.\n\nIf you are wondering how far Khao Lak is from Krabi airport. It is about 120 km south and takes about two hours to get there by car.\n\nKhao Lak by Train: If you are already in Thailand, taking a train to Khao Lak might be your best option.\n\nA train from Bangkok, will take about 12 hours so if you want to sleep I would recommend booking an express night coach. Surat Thani is the nearest train station but, you will have to take a bus from the train station to Khao Lak (about 300-400 THB), which takes another 4 hours.\n\nCheck train times on 12Go who we have personally used while traveling Thailand.\n\nKhao Lak by Bus: Surprisingly getting to Khao Lak by bus is pretty easy. Despite no buses having Khao Lak as a starting or ending point, most will pass through and stop there.\n\nBuses from Bangkok, Chumphon, Phuket, Ranong, or Surat Thani, all come through and stop at Khao Lak. Similar to trains you can check for prices and schedules at 12Go.\n\nFAQ about Khao Lak\n\nHere are some quick answers to the most frequently asked questions about Khao Lak:\n\nSo that’s if for the best things to do in Khao Lak Thailand. After living in Thailand for over a year, I hope you end up loving it as much as I do.\n\nCheck out our other articles\n\nWhat to Eat in Thailand\n\nBest Places to Stay in Thailand\n\nThings to do in Bangkok\n\nInspired?
