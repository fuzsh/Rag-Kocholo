        "text": "The province of Ubon Ratchathani (often shortened to Ubon) in northeastern Thailand has an abundance of natural attractions, fascinating historical sites and remarkable Buddhist temples. Ubon's highlight — a one-of-a-kind Candle Festival, taking place on Khao Phansa Day (first day of Buddhist Lent) — is worth traveling the 380 miles from Bangkok. Elaborately decorated candle floats, depicting mythical Buddhist and Hindu tales, are paraded through the streets as crowds gather to pay respects and participate in the festivities that follow.\n\nOften referred to as Isan, the region of Ubon is separated from neighboring Laos and Cambodia by sandstone cliffs. Its main city, also named Ubon, is located on the banks of the Mun River and plays host to the annual candle festival. A short drive from city brings you to the region’s most incredible temples and natural wonders, including Sam Pan Boak and Pha Taem National Park.\n\nWhether you hop on a flight from Bangkok for a quick visit or set aside time to explore this off-the-beaten-path destination, you are sure to have an authentic Thai experience away from the crowds of the big cities and beach resorts. Here are some of Ubon Ratchathani’s highlights.\n\nAnnual Candle Festival\n\nTaking place at the beginning of Buddhist Lent (rainy season), on the day Lord Buddha first delivered his sermon in India, the Candle Festival starts in Ubon Ratchathani in late July. During this two-day extravaganza, ornately carved wax deities, angels, and animals depicting Hindu and Buddhist tales are paraded through town on floats. Each represents a local temple, district or institution and is accompanied by dancers and musicians in traditional costume.\n\nThe creativity with which these saffron-colored mythical figures are brought to life is a testament to human ingenuity, transcending religions and demanding reverence. A sightseeing tour of the candle-making process at Wat Sripradoo allows visitors to watch volunteer artists cut up and melt beeswax and pour it into molds to form components of the giant figures. The parade begins in front of Wat Si Ubon Rattanaram and heads along the road to Thung Sri Muang Park. At the end of the parade, a winner is selected and showcased for the rest of the year at its temple. The following year, the wax is recycled and used for new wax sculptures.\n\nSirindhorn Wararam Phu Prao Temple\n\nThe stunning Sirindhorn Wararam Phu Prao takes your breath away. This Buddhist temple is located in the Sirindhorn district on a hilltop overlooking the Mekong River. It features walls decorated with intricate ceramic artwork with a brilliant depiction of a tree on one of the walls as its centerpiece, perhaps an homage to the banyan tree under which Buddha meditated.\n\nAround the temple’s grounds, patterns of flowers and intertwined branches, fashioned from luminous and noctilucent stones, illuminate in shades of blue and green under the moonlight. In this sacred space, divinity is both within and beyond the temple’s walls. Be sure to visit at sunset for a truly transcendent experience.\n\nWat Tham Khuha Sawan Temple\n\nWat Tham Khuha Sawan is the site of the largest gong in the country. The temple, built in 1978 by Luangpu Kam Khaning Chula Mani, also served as his residence and meditation center during his lifetime. His body, encased in a glass coffin, still remains in the same condition as the day he passed in 1985 at the age of 91. Residents in surrounding areas make their pilgrimage to pay their respects and give offerings to the monks.\n\nYou enter the temple through a recess cave, under which a row of golden Buddha statues sit in meditation. Devotees can purchase offerings for monks at the nearby stores before going in for prayers. The compound of the temple stands on a bluff above the town of Khong Chiam. There are several vantage points to sit along the bluff to admire the Mekong River overlooking the Laotian border.\n\nPha Taem National Park\n\nFamous for its prehistoric rock paintings, Pha Taem National Park rarely receives international tourists. That’s part of the appeal of this gorgeous natural wonder, with sheer cliffs, sandstone formations and deciduous dipterocarp forest. Wildflowers grace the rocky ground, as the caves and cliff sides are filled with numerous prehistoric cave paintings dating back 3,000 to 4,000 years. These drawings showcase the traditional way of life of people who engaged in rice farming, fishing and sustaining on natural resources.\n\nSam Pan Boak\n\nLocated in the Pho Sai District of Ubon, the gorge of Sam Pan Boak is often compared to the Grand Canyon. Though it’s only 23 feet deep and 66 feet wide, its beauty derives from its sandstone cliffs running along the Mekong River and its refreshing rock pools.\n\nSam Pan Bok translates to 3,000 holes, and this is evident in the cavities (often in random shapes) carved out of the rock from millions of years of erosion. While some of the craters remain as small ponds, the bigger ones offer an opportunity to swim. The most serene of these pools is called Sa Morakot, “emerald pond”. The best view can be witnessed at Hat Hong, which sits between two ridges.\n\nWhere To Stay\n\nLocated centrally in the city of Ubon Ratchathani, Sunee Grand Hotel offers spacious accommodations with modern amenities. It has a pool, mall and the Ruen Sunee Restaurant serving buffet meals.\n\nFor exploring remote parts of Ubon, there’s no better place than the Tohsang Khongjiam Resort for a base. It has lovely accommodations and an outdoor pool overlooking the Mekong River and the Laos border. Don’t miss the daily breakfast serving authentic Isan and Laotian inspired dishes.\n\nGetting There\n\nFlights are available from Bangkok’s Don Mueang International Airport via Nok Air, and from Suvarnabhumi Airport via Thai Smile, to Ubon Ratchathani Airport. If you are visiting for the Candle Festival, make sure to book your airline tickets far in advance."
