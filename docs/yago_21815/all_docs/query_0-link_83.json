        "text": "We had a truly enriching experience in this trip. The service level was of level we have never seen before. Our guide Dy met us at the airport and was with us for every single activity all the way to seeing us off at the airport. She was very very nice, knowledgeable and easy to converse with. Our itinerary was just right, although we really wish we had (at least) one more day in Siem Reap. Every single thing was taken care of in the package, the guide with the transport of the day would meet us at our hotel at exactly the scheduled time and drop us back for our free time when the scheduled part ended. The car (a Lexus SUV) was very nice and comfortable, and the tuktuk and the tuktuk driver we used on one of our days was also very nice. Dy is also an expert cyclist and guided us very gently on our cycling tour of the temples. The kayaking team was also super-nice and ensured we had an amazing day even when it was so hot. They think of everything - there's always cold water to drink, cold towels to freshen you up. Our 'dine with the locals' activity was truly special and we are so happy we could interact with a Cambodian family in their own home. Our driver 'Yaya' was also very sweet and would buy us different snacks while he waited.\n\nThe quality of rooms and the service at hotel Sokkhak Boutique was also beyond words. I have never had such warm and courteous and thoughtful service anywhere I have been.\n\nCambodia (Siem Reap/Angkor) as a destination itself was a whole other fabulous experience. I don't think I can write so much here. Only that everyone MUST VISIT and just do that with this travel agency.\n\nAll in all, we are simply out of words (other than a string of superlatives) to describe our experience.\n\nHotel Review\n\nSokkhak Boutique Resort\n\nSiem Reap City\n\nBeautiful and quiet and green property. Absolutely warm, kind, smiling, friendly and thoughtful service. I had a fantastic massage there too. Don't think further, just stay here.\n\nAuthenticity & Character\n\nIt didn't look like a cookie-cutter multinational chain. It looks actually like a large home with many bedrooms (like a 'bed and breakfast'). The decor is with local aesthetic and art. There was always a fragrance of lemongrass, I loved it. They would make a welcome art on the bed also with some local natural leaves and flowers.\n\nLocation\n\nquiet, yet close (small tuktuk ride) to the happening spots.\n\nStaff\n\nextremely thoughtful, courteous and friendly.\n\nCleanliness & Comfort\n\nIt's clean and comfortable! What details can I add ? :)\n\nWe were very impressed with the ease of working with Steve and his quick response to our needs as he put together a 3 week trip through Cambodia. Our guide in Siem Reap Sokin was great. She was knowledgeable, energetic and flexible to our needs. The temples of Angkor of course are amazing!\n\nThe next section of our trip took us to Koh Ker which was beyond words. We progressed east to Stung Treng and the Mekong River activities to the most memorable morning. We had breakfast floating down the river on a bamboo raft. Definitely a surprise and delight event!!!\n\nThe next stop was treking to see gibbons and walking with an elephant in the jungle, also fantastic although a very hot hikes. Our guide from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh was Mr Tea who was willing to adapt to our changing needs due to the heat. Our final leg was from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap and Van Sreylen was our guide for this final portion. She was fun, informative and flexible with the itinerary as we toured Phnom Penh and Battambang. A final highlight was the bamboo train!\n\nOur lodging varied from beautiful Farmhouse Resort to a minimalistic Bambu hotel. We loved the Aviary Hotel in Siem Reap with its location, facilities and wonderful staff.\n\nAnd a final word about our driver Mr. Ya who went above and beyond to make our trip as safe and comfortable as possible and always did it with a great big smile. We can't say enough good things about him!

She was extremely helpful in making sure everything was perfect. She was very responsive to all requests. Our tour guides throughout our trip were great. They all had a very good knowledge of the history of the area we were seeing and spoke very good English. Thong on our northern Vietnam portion of the trip went above and beyond what we expected, and he always had a wonderful smile on his face. Tommy on the central Vietnam portion of our trip and Vuong on our southern Vietnam portion of our trip were also very good. Savy in Cambodia made sure we saw everything in a way that was comfortable for my older husband with some mobility problems and encouraged me to visit some to the areas impossible for my husband to manage while he remained him. He was always waiting for us when we came down from our hotel room no matter how early we were. The drivers were also very good throughout the trip. In central Vietnam our driver always had ice cold water waiting for us when we returned to the van and in Cambodia they had ice cold water and ice cold towels every time we returned to the van. The trip was everything we expected and more.\n\nI was flabbergasted that our whole trip went off without a single hitch. So many details to coordinate, so many different tours and guides, and all were great! Kim Kim did a super job (thank you, Ha!) with managing all these items. We were always picked up from the airport by a friendly smile and cold water, every morning when we met our guide for the day he/she was always early, and they always explained what would happen. They went above and beyond when we needed help (to find a lost phone, to visit the pharmacy)—really a great experience. A friend recommended I use Kim Kim, and now I will recommend it for others!\n\nHotel Review\n\nSaem Siem Reap Hotel\n\nSiem Reap\n\nReally great! The best service. Sochin, the manager, greeted us with juice and a cold towel and showed us the family room, as a better option for our group than two separate rooms. The pool was lovely, as was the bar. Definitely the best hotel and staff we experienced in all of Cambodia!\n\nAuthenticity & Character\n\nLocation\n\nIt’s far away from Pub Strewt\n\nStaff\n\nCleanliness & Comfort\n\nI had the opportunity to spend six weeks in Southeast Asia going to Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos. Hien did an excellent job of planning and providing support for the whole trip. She was quick to respond to my questions and patient with me throughout the planning process. She met with me in Hanoi and showed me around a bit, which was very kind.\n\n* The places that I visited were terrific! I had the opportunity for some input, and I appreciate the way my ideas were infused with the ideas of someone who knew the area.\n\n* The guides often took my interest into account and made minor adjustments in my itinerary, which I really appreciated.\n\n* I felt the price was very reasonable!\n\n* Hotels overall were very good.\n\n* Breakfasts were also very good . I loved the lunches and dinners I ate during the trip also.\n\n* There were a few long days, but it was necessary to have these in order to accomplish the itinerary.\n\n* The whole itinerary flowed smoothly. On one occasion, my ride was not there to pick me up at the airport. I contacted Realistic Asia. They were immediately able to help.\n\n* I would highly recommend this trip and this company!\n\nMy mother had wanted to see Angkor Wat in person for 70+ years--ever since she wrote a middle school paper about it. Time flies and it seemed like she might miss her chance. But then in early 2023 we found KimKim and Travel Asia A La Carte. Steve quickly responded to my inquiry and created an interesting trip in Cambodia for us that would accommodate an 82-year-old who struggles in the heat, walks very slow, and needs help getting up and down steps. All throughout the planning process, Steve was quick to respond, friendly and accommodating. He organized a fantastic trip for us that included enriching experiences that highlighted Cambodia's history and culture. Ra was our driver throughout the trip, Pich was our guide from Phnom Penh to Battambang and Siem Reap and Kin was our guide throughout our time in Siem Reap and back to the airport. These people are outstanding and made our trip The Best. The activities, accommodations and meals were all super--loved every one of them and everyone we met--but what made the trip great was Steve and his team--Ra, Pich and Kin--and the care they gave to us and especially my mother throughout our time in Cambodia. They were always friendly and respected my mother's slow walking pace, accommodated her when she needed to stop and rest, and never tried to rush her. They helped her up and down steps and in and out of boats and challenging seats and strategized ways to get her to see as much as possible without having her walk more than necessary or miss anything interesting or important. Any they were always friendly and joyful about it. This trip would have been impossible without these wonderful, loving people.

While we have traveled in Asia before, this was our first time in Cambodia and Steve was enormously helpful in crafting a trip that worked for our family and gave us an incredible introduction to the culture, history and beauty of Cambodia. We will definitely be back! We began with 3 days in Siem Reap where our guide Ms. Sokin shared her in-depth knowledge of the beautiful temples of Angkor Thom, Angkor Wat, Ta Phrom & Banteay Srei. We enjoyed the traditional Apsara dancing one night and had delicious meals there and at Haven restaurant. Having a guide and driver from the moment we landed at the airport made the trip so much easier. We traveled by boat to Battambang, which was a long trip (@7 hours) but definitely worthwhile as we saw the floating villages and beautiful countryside along the way, and the boat was comfortable and a fun experience in itself. We stayed 3 days in Battambang with Ms. Sokin continuing as our guide - highlights included making lunch with the locals, where we harvested local ingredients and prepared delicious local cuisine as well as the bike tour, where we toured a number of local home-industries. Also the bamboo train was a fun experience and the visit to Phnom Sampeau for sunset should not be missed. We then traveled by car to Phnom Penh, stopping along the way to visit a pottery maker and the market, where we tried some local delicacies (some of us more adventurous than others!). We spent 3 days in Phnom Penh. Our guide there Ms. Sreyhouch led us through the beautiful central market, where you can get anything from fresh food to housewares to jewelry. We also visited the Genocide Museum and the Killing Fields, important to understanding the history of the Khmer people. All-in-all, our trip was amazing (but slightly exhausting) - the hotels were all comfortable and accomodating, and we felt that we were really able to see the local experience (particularly in Battambang). The knowledge and support of our guides and driver deepened our experience, allowing us to focus on the experience rather than worrying about whether we were missing something or how we were going to get to the next place. We would highly recommend Steve and his team!\n\nHotel Reviews\n\nThe Aviary Hotel\n\nSiem Reap\n\nAuthenticity & Character\n\nLocation\n\nStaff\n\nCleanliness & Comfort\n\nMaisons Wat Kor\n\nBattambang\n\nAuthenticity & Character\n\nLocation\n\nStaff\n\nCleanliness & Comfort\n\nPalace Gate Hotel & Resort\n\nPhnom Penh\n\nAuthenticity & Character\n\nLocation\n\nStaff\n\nCleanliness & Comfort\n\nActivity Reviews\n\nAngkor Thom (afternoon) by remork (tuk tuk)\n\nSiem Reap\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nTransport\n\nTraditional dance performance and dinner\n\nSiem Reap\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nFood\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nTransport\n\nAngkor Wat morning visit\n\nSiem Reap\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nTransport\n\nHAVEN Restaurant\n\nSiem Reap\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nFood\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nTransport\n\nBamboo train ride\n\nBattambang\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nTransport\n\nI cannot speak highly enough about Steve and his exceptional team at Travel Asia A La Carte. Our recent two-week trip to Cambodia exceeded all expectations, thanks to their meticulous planning and unwavering commitment to ensuring our family of four had an unforgettable experience.\n\nFrom the moment we started discussing our preferences with Steve, it was evident that he and his team were dedicated to tailoring the perfect vacation for us. Our family, including two children, has specific dietary needs, and Travel Asia A La Carte went above and beyond to accommodate them. Every meal was a delightful culinary adventure, showcasing the diverse and delicious flavors of Cambodia.\n\nWhat truly set this experience apart was our desire for an authentic vacation with a touch of adventure. Steve crafted an itinerary that perfectly balanced cultural immersion with thrilling activities, creating memories that will last a lifetime. Whether exploring ancient temples in Siem Reap, cruising along the Tonle Sap Lake, or engaging in hands-on experiences with local communities, every moment felt like a unique adventure.\n\nThe attention to detail in the itinerary was impeccable, ensuring that our family's interests and preferences were seamlessly integrated into each day's activities. The accommodations selected were not only comfortable but also reflected the charm and character of Cambodia.\n\nSteve's team (Horn and Mr Tee in particular) demonstrated unparalleled professionalism and a genuine passion for showcasing the beauty of Cambodia. Their local knowledge, combined with a personalized approach, made us feel like we were in the hands of true experts.\n\nWe had a tremendously interesting and enjoyable 2 weeks in Cambodia, thanks to Steve & Travel Asia a la Carte. One of their sample itineraries on kimkim.com mostly matched our wish list and Steve tweaked it to accommodate all our requests. He was extremely responsive, replying to queries within a day and offering good advice, even stopped by our hotel to say hello. The itinerary was wonderfully varied, well-organised, and went off seamlessly, at a packed but manageable pace, with great guides & drivers, nice hotels. Steve & his team took much of the stress out of travelling in a developing country and we have no hesitation in recommending them.\n\nOf the places on our route, of course we were thrilled to finally visit Angkor Wat, Bayon, Preah Khan, Ta Phrom & other stunning sites in Angkor park. But we also really enjoyed the Apopo \"HeroRats\" demo, Phare Circus, Kampot’s shophouses and Old Cinema Hotel, Kep's seafood market, La Plantation, Santuk silk farm, our beach interval on Koh Rong, the heritage tour of Phnom Penh by tuk-tuk & tablet, and driving through the countryside. The food experiences were a riot, from fried tarantula to stuffed frog, nam ben chok noodles to authentic Portuguese cuisine in Kampot!\n\nBest of all was the lovely Cambodian people we met, their ready smiles, openness and sense of humour, despite their horrific recent history that touched almost every family. The children just melt your heart and their families seem happy to engage. Even the persistent vendors were more friendly than pesky. Our guides were highly professional and delightful personalities, especially Ms Dy and Mr Sothea, who made late changes to cater to our interests and comfort. We felt in safe hands with the drivers, especially Mr Ya and Mr Date (sp?), who always aircon-cooled the car before we got back in – we felt thoroughly pampered. All the hotel staff were smiling & obliging, especially Tina, Chanthy and Sophan (possibly the most attentive waiter we've ever met) at Sohkkak Boutique Resort.\n\nHotel Reviews\n\nHotel Old Cinema\n\nKampot\n\nAbsolute gem of a hotel. Our favourite of the trip. Excellent adaptive reuse of a former cinema building and superbly restored, then beautifully decorated. Aesthetically pleasing details in every corner. Even the breakfast was a visual (and tasteful) delight. Lovely little restaurant/bar. Tiny pool inside but open to the sky. Our superior room with king bed had a small balcony facing the indoor garden, very quiet.\n\nAuthenticity & Character\n\nSee above\n\nLocation\n\nIn centre of town, surrounded by French colonial-era shophouses. Walkable to many restaurants, open-air food court and the riverfront promenade.\n\nStaff\n\nJilly was great, happy to answer questions on history of the hotel and developments in Kampot, and book restaurants for us.\n\nCleanliness & Comfort\n\nHigh threadcount linen and firm mattress made for best sleep\n\nPenh House\n\nPhnom Penh\n\nPretty, greenery-filled hotel in great neighbourhood, near the palace. Lovely, small, rooftop pool with city views. Good breakfast spread with enough Western & local options eg eggs cooked to order, noodle soup, and plenty of assorted fruit. Deluxe room tastefully done with effective aircon & little balcony; unfortunately faint odour of drains in bathroom.\n\nAuthenticity & Character\n\nExhibition of photos of Angkor in lobby\n\nLocation\n\nSurrounded by small eateries & cool shops\n\nStaff\n\nHelpful in giving directions, booking tuk-tuk\n\nCleanliness & Comfort\n\nVery clean overall but occasional slight sewage odour in bathroom\n\nSokkhak Boutique Resort\n\nSiem Reap City\n\nBeautifully appointed 12-room hotel. Small pool but great for cooling off in. Very good breakfast choices, cooked to order. Always smiling, helpful staff who greet you with cold towels & tea every time you return, book remorks, recommend restaurants (albeit in the same Chanrey Tree Group), break up US$100 bills, tell you about Sin Sisamouth. Deluxe room not big, no sofa or chair, but has balcony. Very comfortable firm bed. Powerful aircon and shower pressure.\n\nAuthenticity & Character\n\nElegant local furnishings and decor, lotus flower arrangements, lush landscaping in pool area\n\nLocation\n\n10 minutes remork ride from town. But just down the road from Apopo visitor centre\n\nStaff\n\nTina, who obligingly sprayed my husband's legs with the hotel's lemongrass-scented bug repellent every morning! Sophan, super-attentive waiter who remembered our breakfast preferences and just a very sweet guy. Chanthy who brought cold drinks & cold beer to our room\n\nCleanliness & Comfort\n\nMattress was firm and very comfy, as in all the hotels we stayed at\n\nLong Set Resort\n\nKoh Rong\n\nHotel is on a gorgeous beach - turquoise sea & powdery white sand shaded by palms - but there weren't enough sunbeds for guests (and you're warned not to lie on a towel on the sand due to sandflies). Decent beach-facing restaurant/bar serving fun cocktails and okay food. Resort could use a refresh, eg worn cushions, broken sunbeds, misaligned doors. Room just adequate but well-cooled. Occasional very brief power cuts, not really bothersome. Complimentary use of kayaks & SUPs, snorkel mask & fins, small gym.\n\nAuthenticity & Character\n\nTypical mid-range beach hotel in the tropics, not luxe but fine for 3 nights\n\nLocation\n\nOnly half-hour boat ride from Sihanoukville port. Short stroll from pier.\n\nStaff\n\nLovely, smiley, obliging staff. Runy served us the most - she's a sweetheart. Louise was great about rebooking our snorkelling trip.\n\nCleanliness & Comfort\n\nComfy bed. Good aircon & shower pressure. Toilet paper has to be thrown in a lidded bin, not flushed, but room is cleaned daily.\n\nVakara Hotel\n\nKep\n\nVery nice, new, modern hotel, on the edge of a national park and not near Kep town, so better to have your own transport. Our spacious deluxe room (finally with a sofa!) plus large balcony looked down on the huge swimming pool and towards the forested hills of the national park. We saw no other guests (only 7 of the 70 rooms were occupied the night we stayed) so it was extremely quiet. Breakfast, served by the pool, was fine, with 11 set menus to choose from!\n\nAuthenticity & Character\n\nNot much character but ideal for families, with chalets on the grounds, kid's playground, big pool and lots of space to run around\n\nLocation\n\nStaff\n\nStaff were all smiles and eager to please\n\nCleanliness & Comfort\n\nSparkling clean. Comfy firm mattress.\n\nActivity Reviews\n\nNational Museum & Royal Palace\n\nPhnom Penh\n\nPalace: Besides gawking at the ornate architecture, it was interesting to watch the monks & local devotees. Museum: beautiful French-designed, Khmer-style building around a lovely courtyard, worth visiting even if not too interested in the exhibits, which are mostly pre-Angkorian and Angkorian sculpture and carvings - annotated, including those returned to Cambodia by US, UK etc.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nBoth places evocative - the museum evoking French colonial patronage , the palace the reverence for the monarchy especially former King Sihanouk (who was imprisoned there by the Khmer Rouge).\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nMr Bunna was our guide (subbing for Mr Sovann, who was busy that day) - more understandable English than Mr Sovann and very jolly. Tried hard to explain the Sisowath and Norodom royal family trees but we were still confused!\n\nTransport\n\nSo cool to have an aircon car waiting for us!\n\nPhnom Penh Heritage Tour\n\nPhnom Penh\n\nNovel way to tour historical sites with narration & old photos/maps on a tablet - brilliant idea, particularly when guide's English is hard to follow. We got off the tuk-tuk to take photos at some stops and also entered a couple of the 22 sites.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nFun new way to sightsee\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nTransport\n\nAlways fun to travel by tuk tuk.\n\n{{start_location}} to {{end_location}} via Kompong Khleang, Spean Praptos & Skuon\n\nCambodia\n\nVery interesting and fun stops on the long drive to Siem Reap. Husband ate a fried tarantula for bragging rights. I tried a fried grasshopper - crunchy. Learned a lot about silkworms at Santuk silk farm, first time we saw up close silk threads produced from the cocoon; bought some silk scarves. Enjoyed the boat ride on Tonle Sap to Kompong Khleang and learning about life on the lake, seeing the kids playing in the water (though surprised there's no treatment of sewage at all before it goes into the lake!)\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nThe variety of interesting experiences\n\nFood\n\nTasty, simple lunch at the silk farm\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nMr Sovann enthusiastically and earnestly answered our many questions, and we could understand about 60% but didn't want to keep asking him to repeat himself.\n\nTransport\n\nSafe driving all the way by Mr Ya\n\nAngkor Thom (morning) by remork\n\nSiem Reap\n\nExhilarating to finally be in Angkor park and then within the Bayon, discerning the differences in enigmatic facial expressions on the towers; having details in the bas reliefs explained by our guide; seeing the actual length of the Terrace of Elephants. The vast size of the park and how green it is dawns on you as you putter around it by remork.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nThe scale, artistry, exactitude (in the 12th century!) similar in jaw-drop factor to Petra (tho that was 1000 years earlier). Apart from the romance of the jungle setting, the sheer engineering involved is mind-boggling & mystifying\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nOur guide Ms Dy's excellent commentary really added value to the experience. She took some fantastic photos for us too.\n\nTransport\n\nFun to tour by remork, iced water provided too.\n\nLunch at Srah Srang\n\nSiem Reap\n\nTasty set lunch at tourist restaurant.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nFood\n\nFound out there are regional variations of fish amok!\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nTransport\n\nAfternoon and sunset at Angkor Wat\n\nSiem Reap\n\nWe visited Angkor Wat at midday when it was 33C and remember it through a heat haze. There's no shade on the causeway, no breeze around the wat. Ms Dy valiantly kept us going with rest breaks and fanning as we struggled to pay attention to her detailed commentary. We had no energy to clamber to the top level. That said, the site is breathtaking & baffling (how did Khmers build this in the 12th century?!) and the long bas-relief galleries stunning, especially the Churning of the Sea of Milk which I'd long wanted to see. We did not stay for sunset as my husband was exhausted from the heat and wanted to return to the hotel.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nsee above\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nMs Dy’s deep knowledge and patient explanation of the sites, Hindu-Buddhist hybridity, deities, S2 and J7, restoration & conservation with minimal intervention, and much much more.\n\nTransport\n\nRemork driver drove safely, had iced water in his cooler\n\nPhare, the Cambodian Circus (Seat B - open seating in the rear half of the middle seating area)\n\nSiem Reap\n\nHigh-energy dancing, acrobatics, juggling, mime, live music on Khmer instruments and drums - with a creative Cambodian angle ... great fun for a good cause.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nWonderful experience of contemporary Cambodia and its talented youngsters\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nMs Dy met us at the venue, showed us all the food stations, took us to our seats under the tent. Mr Ya waited for us with his car till the show ended.\n\nTransport\n\nAppreciated the door-to-door service, particularly as many people were trying to flag tuk-tuks on the street after the show.\n\nSunset river cruise\n\nKampot\n\nRelaxing cruise upriver, passing fishing boats heading the other way out to sea. Typical SE Asian rural scenes of mangroves, coconut groves, fish traps, riverside tourist chalets. Very pleasant as the sun sank behind Bokor mtn.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nFun to dangle legs over side of wooden boat\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nMr Sothea bought fresh coconuts, beer & snacks for the ride. Friendly boatman, tried to find fireflies for us.\n\nTransport\n\n{{start_location}} to {{end_location}} with La Plantation pepper farm visit\n\nCambodia\n\nFascinating tour of a sustainably-run pepper plantation overlooking a lake, enjoyed the pepper tasting in a beautiful old Khmer house. Learned a lot about pepper cultivation and processing, eg that black, white, green, red peppercorns come from the same stem. Bought all our gifts for home at the shop.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nAdmirable agritourism project. Happy to support a social enterprise that funds a school for its rural community and helps other small farmers\n\nFood\n\nDelicious pepper-themed 3-course lunch at the restaurant, trying the various pepper-infused sauces.\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nInformative in-house guide who welcomed questions\n\nTransport\n\nMr Date and his 'golden elephant' safely transported us over potholed dirt roads\n\nKep Crab Market\n\nKep\n\nVery fun and tasty grazing on bbq squid and deep-fried mini-crabs as Mr Sothea guided us through this seafood market by the beach. Tubs of fresh blue crabs, octopus, squid, shrimp, big pots steaming over wood fires, assorted fresh fish grilled over charcoal - worth coming to Kep for this market, as well as the sun setting behind the surreal giant crab sculpture and seeing local families enjoying themselves on the beach.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nAfter a scrumptious meal of crab, fish, shrimp & squid the previous night (less than US$50 for 4 people!) at one of the nearby seafood restaurants, good to see where it all came from.\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nMr Sothea always looking out for us. My husband the foodie was tempted to sample the fresh local oysters on display in the market but Sothea sensibly cautioned against it as we had a long drive to Phnom Penh ahead of us.\n\nTransport\n\nOur route included a couple stretches of really bumpy, rutted, dusty roads that Mr Date handled with aplomb\n\nGrand Circuit morning tour\n\nSiem Reap\n\nWe visited 3 more sites in Angkor Archaeological Park this morning. Each had its own character and distinctiveness. Especially enjoyed Preah Khan and the WMF interpretation gallery there. The rectangular symmetrical layout, surprising 2-storey columned sanctum, massive garudas, graceful apsaras, made it special. Also loved smaller-scale Ta Som, its well-preserved four-faced towers and unusual devatas. East Mebon was interesting as a brick-built temple to honour an earlier king’s parents and its stone elephants an irresistible photo op. After clambering around its big laterite steps under a blazing sun we were happy to call it a day.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nGlad we added an extra day in Siem Reap to see these, particularly Preah Khan, in addition to the more famous wats.\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nMs Dy again expertly guided us through all 3 sites, explaining what's known about the history, the scholarly theories, pointing out details and distinctive features. In Preah Khan's hall of dancers she demonstrated the hand gestures of the apsara carvings that Khmer dancers still practise today. She also helped us old fogies climb the high uneven steps and led us on easier paths. We could not have asked for a better-informed or more considerate guide.\n\nTransport\n\nMr Ya waited for us at each stop. Nothing beats an aircon car to ferry you around in the heat!\n\nKampot Walking Tour\n\nKampot\n\nVery interesting tour on foot and by car of the French colonial-era shophouses and riverside cinema-turned-Starbucks, Cham Muslim village & mosque, Chinese temple & school, Buddhist monastery, gilded wat & funerary stupas. Many photogenic scenes of monks soliciting alms, entire families on motorbikes, massive durian roundabout, dating couples on the riverside promenade ...\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nCharming laid-back town, less touristed, yet has incredibly good local & European cuisine. At La Tertulia, we had the best Portuguese meals outside of Portugal, so good we ate there both nights.\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nMr Sothea would tell us the plan for the day so we knew what to expect, then flexibly adjust it along the way depending on our interests. He thoughtfully or humorously answered every question, took us to his favourite eatery for lunch, escorted us across roads safely, just looked after us like family! He made the trip more local and authentic than if we'd done it ourselves, and was great company throughout.\n\nTransport\n\nMr Date was at our beck and call, always on time, his car spotless, his cooler full of ice water\n\nTuol Sleng, Central Market & Killing Fields in the afternoon\n\nPhnom Penh\n\nCentral Market was worth visiting even though we're not avid shoppers. The building is humongous and houses scores of stalls selling everything, from gems to galangal, plus cubicles where you can get a massage, hair wash, nail varnish. The food stalls section was fun; we snacked on grilled squid there, would've tried other stuff that looked interesting if we knew what it was (our guide didn't come in with us). Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and killing fields were even grimmer than anticipated, but well organised with a set route (no guide necessary) and descriptive boards in English. Glad we dressed appropriately.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nS21 heightens appreciation of the Cambodian recovery and resilience of its long-suffering people, why they'd rather put up with a dynastic autocracy than oppose it.\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nGuide could accompany guests into Central Market to help with translation & questions, instead of waiting outside.\n\nTransport\n\nCar & driver was always waiting for us\n\nApopo HeroRats, Banteay Srei, Banteay Samre, Noodle Village, & Ta Phrom\n\nSiem Reap\n\nAt our request to avoid heat exhaustion, Steve and Dy rejigged the schedule: we visited Apopo and Ta Phrom in the morning, returned to hotel 12-2pm, went out again at 2pm for late lunch and visit to Banteay Srei, skipping Banteay Samre. This was perfect and we were able to enjoy the temple visits much more. Apopo HeroRats: must-do, fluently narrated by guides who know their stuff. The landmine-detecting demo was fascinating and HeroRats so cute; we \"adopted\" one for a year for US$100 - an eminently worthy cause. Ta Phrom: very atmospheric to wander around, even with people lining up to take the iconic photo of tree roots gripping the ruins. Ms Dy skillfully manoeuvred us into strategic spots and snapped some great pictures. Interesting to learn about the hollow spong trees. Noodle village: deliciously different nam ben chok rice noodles, eaten with 2 sauces & fresh veggies. Also tried stuffed frog at a roadside stall in Pradak village and almost tried whole roast pig-on-a-spit but it was still roasting. Banteay Srei: must-see, exquisite carvings in dusky pink sandstone, well preserved. A bridal couple in traditional costume were taking photos there, which added to the ambience. The drive there through villages & countryside was interesting too, stopped to buy palm sugar.\n\nQuality of Experience\n\nWe loved the variety of experiences interspersed between temple visits\n\nFood\n\nLoved the nam ben chok noodles. Stuffed frog with tamarind paste was a first for us - yummy.\n\nGuides, Drivers and Staff\n\nMs Dy was an outstanding guide, flexible, open, chatty, answering questions fully, diligently pointing out details, repeatedly explaining till we got it. We learned a lot from her. Also a born story-teller, with an extraordinary family history of survival and achievement. With our careful driver Mr Ya we felt we were in responsible hands. He was a sweetie too.\n\nTransport\n\nMr Ya was unfailingly punctual, his car comfortable and clean."
