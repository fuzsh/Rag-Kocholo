        "text": "An Invitation - Our Year with IJM\n\nThis Wednesday evening, Jan. 24, we will be sharing stories from our year in Cambodia, and we'd love for you to come join us. This will take place at our church in Austin, Covenant Presbyterian Church, which is located at the southeast corner of 2222/Northland Drive and Mopac. There is a casual Wednesday night dinner starting at 5:00 pm (taco bar this week!), and the program begins at 6:30 pm (ending at 7:30). You are welcome to come for dinner, or just the program, or both. The dinner and program both take place in Fellowship Hall, which is on the main (2nd) floor of the Fellowship & Education Building -- the large, 4-story building at the top of the steps coming off the main patio. (See map below -- it's the building on the lower left.)\n\nPlease come, and be sure to stop by and say hello. We hope to see you there!\n\n- Doug\n\nNext Stop, USA!\n\nIt's been an exhilarating year. And now the time has come for us to do the hard work of leaving. The bags are packed, the kids finished school this morning, and our flight departs tonight around 11 pm. After an overnight flight to Tokyo followed by a 4 & 1/2 hour layover, we are bound for U.S. soil, for the first time since January. What an unbelievable ride this has been.\n\nWe are grateful for all of you. We could not have done this without you.\n\nWe are grateful to International Justice Mission (IJM) and the friends we have made during our time here. These heroes are on the front lines every day, battling against injustice. And the fight continues.\n\nWe are grateful to the people of Cambodia for their warmth, generous smiles, and hospitality.\n\nWe are grateful to our extended families, our friends at Covenant Presbyterian Church, and the lawyers and staff of Graves, Dougherty, Hearon & Moody, P.C.\n\nBut most of all, we are grateful to God. A God who authored the greatest rescue mission of all time, just over 2,000 years ago.\n\nHave a very Merry Christmas, and thank you for being with us this year.\n\n- Doug\n\nUntil We Meet Again!\n\nI don't like goodbyes. And I don't like thinking about our time in Cambodia coming to an end. There is so much to celebrate about this year, and so much joy to carry home with us. And yet, there are certain inescapable realities. We have cleaned out our desks. Our team prayed with us and sent us off with precious gifts and an amazing noodle bowl lunch. We will be boarding an airplane on Friday night after the kids finish their last day at school. This looks very much like the beginning of the end, but I choose to think of it instead as a new beginning. (Just humor me with this. It's better this way.) Instead of goodbye, I prefer -- until we meet again.\n\nHere are some recent highlights and noteworthy moments, as we approach our impending departure from what has been the best and most rewarding year of our lives:\n\nFirst, we are only unofficially done with work. Thais has a stack of papers that she still needs to sort, file, and/or shred. And I'm headed back on Tuesday afternoon for a trial, which our legal team has graciously allowed me to join -- for one last hurrah in court. This is actually a re-trial for a suspected perpetrator who was previously tried and convicted in absentia. After his conviction, he was found and arrested. The court has allowed him the opportunity to present a defense, so we will need to go try him and convict him again. Please pray for justice! (Again!) We are both secretly glad to have an excuse to see our friends at the office another time. The rest of this week will be about laundry and packing and preparing our family for our new beginning in a place we know simply as \"home.\"\n\nSecond, the kids all participated in the end-of-semester Christmas concert at Hope International School on Friday. It was an unforgettable evening of reconnecting with teachers and kids who have loved on our family, and celebrating the season with music. So proud of our kids, and so grateful for this school community!\n\nThird -- and this is important: grilled bananas. This is an unbelievable delicacy. To make it even better, it's mobile. There are many vendors around town who sell grilled bananas. My favorite is the guy who sometimes sets up on the street near our office. He rides around on a bicycle, with a grill and a cooler in front of him. That's right -- it's a grill and a cooler and a bicycle. (Why can't we have these in America?) What's not to love about going for a bike ride, then pausing to take something out of the cooler to throw on the grill, and then hopping back on the bike while you cook? That's multitasking, folks! Four grilled bananas cost just 1,000 Riel, which is about a quarter in U.S. currency. Are you kidding me?!? I frequently buy a bunch of these to share around the office. They are amazing.\n\nFourth -- reunions. As noted above, I don't like goodbyes. We are extremely blessed that we will be leaving Cambodia knowing that we will see our team again in the year ahead. The highlight of the IJM calendar every year is what they call the \"Global Prayer Gathering.\" This has always taken place in Washington, D.C., which is home to IJM's headquarters. Every field office sends in the Field Office Director and 1-2 other staff members, as IJM's community of supporters comes together to hear stories, learn about the challenges and successes, and pray for an end to human trafficking and injustice around the world. Thais and I attended the 2016 Global Prayer Gathering, as we were learning and listening for God's call on us. It just so happens that 2018 will be a monumental first. As IJM celebrates the successful completion of a ten year vision -- protecting thousands, rescuing millions, and proving that justice for the poor is possible -- the celebration will take place in grand style. This celebration and time of prayer and worship has a Biblical origin. When God sent Moses to rescue His people from slavery, He told Moses, \"I will be with you. And this will be a sign to you that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.\" (Exodus 3:-12.) Rescue returns to God in the form of worship. Just like he did with Moses, God has gone with IJM for these last 20 years. And God has been faithful in rescuing thousands, and protecting millions. So all of IJM will be gathering to worship. The 2018 Global Prayer Gathering will be unique. It will include every single staff member from every field office and country around the world. And the gathering will take place in Texas! Next September 28-29, we will be with our team again, along with many others from all around the world, in Frisco, Texas. We would love to have company, and we would be delighted to introduce any of you to our heroes from Cambodia. Please mark your calendars, and let us know if you are interested in learning more about IJM at the \"Liberate!\" Global Prayer Gathering in 2018. We are so excited that as we leave here, we can say with confidence that \"we will see you in Texas!\" in just a few months.\n\nFifth -- puzzles. And maps to take you home. During the holiday season, it is customary for a jigsaw puzzle to make its appearance in our house. It's a relaxing way to decompress, visit, and enjoy some Christmas music. Usually this ends up causing some late nights of solitude, often into the wee hours. And I treasure those times. Well, this year, Thais really planned ahead. (She's sneaky that way.) Last Christmas she gave me a 500-piece puzzle she had to special order. It's a satellite image of our neighborhood, with our house smack-dab in the middle. What a great gift! We finally popped the box open in early December. It was a difficult puzzle, since every piece is some combination of gray, green, and/or brown. But we finally got it done. Now that we have our map complete, we are cleared for departure and can make our way home.\n\nWe will head home feeling full. And overwhelmed with gratitude. It has been a tremendous year. Of course we are also quite sad. But it's the kind of sad one can only feel after having received the very best kind of gift, and the time has come to leave it behind.\n\nAs we prepare to depart, as we prepare for a homecoming, and as we prepare for the coming of Christmas, I will leave you with this:\n\nHave a very Merry Christmas -- until we meet again!\n\n- Doug\n\nAnd so this is Christmas....\n\nIn 1971, John Lennon wrote a unique and challenging Christmas song -- \"Happy Xmas (War is Over)\". You probably know it well. The song is not about shepherds or wise men. It does not mention a baby who came to save us. Instead, the song is a Christmastime plea for peace, and specifically an end to the Vietnam War. As John sings \"happy Christmas\" wishes to those near and dear, a children's chorus sings the haunting refrain, \"war is over, if you want it; war is over now.\" The song goes a step further, demanding to know \"what have you done?,\" and \"what have we done?,\" for the cause of peace.\n\nWe find ourselves wrestling with some of these questions as our year in Cambodia approaches a Christmastime finish. With another year over, what have we done? Have we made a difference? Is the world any closer to the ideal of peace? Of justice? The fight to end human trafficking is far from over. How do we \"celebrate\" Christmas in the midst of all of this? And how are we supposed to leave?\n\nIt is a most unusual time, and a challenging Christmas season.\n\nOf course, there is a buzz of excitement about returning home. We have missed our people and places and Zoey the family dog. We often find ourselves counting the days, with great anticipation. (Just twelve days until departure!) But we are also grieving. It has been a special time of family bonding, meaningful work, learning about the world, and building relationships with people we have come to love. We will dearly miss our Cambodian friends, our time here, all that we have experienced together, and the work. It has been an incredibly special chapter. (Sigh -- just twelve days until departure....) We are navigating all of this the best that we can. And we are trying to hold it all loosely, knowing that we are in God's hands.\n\nSo, how are the kids doing as we approach the finish line? Well, they are just fantastic. It has been so rewarding as parents to watch them stretch and grow during a year of challenges they did not choose. They have made friends with people who originate from all over the world. They have experienced what it is like to be a racial, cultural, and ethnic minority at school. They have learned that gaga ball can be called \"octoball,\" and it's still just as much fun. They have learned to play \"muk-jji-ppa\" -- the South Korean variety of \"rock, paper, scissors.\" They have learned some Khmer and some French. In addition to Cambodia, they have traveled to Thailand, China, and Japan. Their horizons have expanded, and the world has become smaller and closer to home. They have drawn closer to what really matters -- following God, taking risks when it matters, cherishing family, and serving those in need. They will never be the same. None of us will ever be the same.\n\nDespite the many new challenges and changes, much of our year has felt familiar and \"normal.\" Thais and I recently joined our IJM-Cambodia team for our annual staff retreat. On Friday evening we attended the IJM Christmas party, where we shared great food and fun times with friends and colleagues. Naeda spent yesterday primping for her winter formal, and last weekend she was part of the school play. Lincoln is on the rotation for reading scripture at our church, and today he read from Isaiah 40. David spent yesterday morning playing laser tag at a friend's birthday party. Our evenings are filled with homework and laundry and cooking and cleaning. Some things don't change across the time zones.\n\nWhat has changed for us? One thing is certain. We will return home with stories to tell and with much greater awareness about how our choices as consumers impact the modern-day slave trade. (Life of the party, right?) If you want a sobering glimpse, head over to slaveryfootprint.org. You will be astonished to find out how many slaves in this world are working for you right now.\n\nThis Christmas, I hope we will all ask ourselves \"what have we done?\" on the issue of human trafficking. Because we can do a lot. We can look for fair trade coffee, chocolate, cotton, produce, and other products, and we can choose to pay a higher price to ensure that workers are treated with basic dignity. We can ask questions where we buy our clothes, our food, and our electronics, and we can encourage companies to monitor and address slavery in their supply chains. We can give to organizations like International Justice Mission, who are on the front lines of this fight every day and all over the world. We can pray. We can make a difference. It is on us -- all of us. Next year, when we are at \"another year over,\" let's make sure our voices have been heard.\n\nJohn Lennon had a lot of things right:\n\nHe was right about that. In so many ways, the world is so wrong. But God wrote the ending, and Christ came for everyone -- weak, strong, rich, poor, young, and old.\n\nThere was once another John who gave us a beautiful picture of how this all changes. He told us of one who was with God in the beginning. One through whom all things were made. One in whom was life, and the light of all mankind. That light came into the world at Christmas, and it shines in the darkness. The darkness cannot overcome that light. It's up to all of us to spread the light, to illuminate the world, and to drown out the darkness. It's on us.\n\nThis Christmas, may that light shine in and through each of you. And may each of us share that light with those all around us.\n\nTo you and yours, we wish you a very Merry Christmas. And a Happy New Year. Let's hope it's a good one. Without any fear.\n\nPeace,\n\n- Doug\n\nWe Are Thankful!\n\nI am quite certain there will never be another Kilday Thanksgiving quite like this one. A regular work day and a regular school day. A day when Thais leaves at 6 am for cross-country travel to meet with survivors of modern-day slavery. A day when we find a Phnom Penh eating establishment that serves both American-style Thanksgiving dinner and pizza. A day when our post-dinner tuk tuk ride home takes us across the open sewer canal that runs through the heart of the city. A day when our driver warns us on the way home about the known robber-on-a-moto straight ahead, so please secure your phone and personal items. And a day when at least one of us will be up late baking cookies in our tiny five-cookies-per-pan microwave/convection oven for Naeda's school formal fundraiser.\n\nNot your typical Thanksgiving Day.\n\nEvery day here has been filled with wonders and surprises we never could have imagined. And we are so very thankful to be here. The list of all that makes us thankful is endless, but below are a few items that immediately come to mind on this Thanksgiving but not really Thanksgiving Day:\n\n1. Our IJM-Cambodia legal team has a 100% success rate through eight trials this year, with 18 convictions against those involved in human trafficking. Praise God!\n\n2. Now that we are just a month away from our departure, we can say with confidence that our living expenses for our year here are covered and, indeed, are more than 100% funded. (Wow! Praise God again, and thank you!) We now have the \"problem\" we hoped to have. When we return home, Covenant Presbyterian Church will be holding unspent funds in the \"IJM Fellowship\" account. Covenant's Mission Committee will ultimately decide how those funds will be spent, but we hope this will become seed money for the next IJM fellow(s) from our church. If any of you Covenant folks have a background in law, social work, law enforcement, grant writing, non-profit management, or administration, and you are interested in pursuing an experience of a lifetime, please let us know. We will be proud to support you. (And if anyone reading this is or was considering making a contribution to support our ongoing work, we encourage you to make a donation instead directly to International Justice Mission at this link.)\n\n3. We are thankful for the heroes we have met at IJM and the transformational work they are doing to end modern-day slavery. It has been such a privilege to be a small part of this group that is working to change a broken part of a broken world.\n\n4. We are grateful for friends we have missed all year long and we will soon see. And we are grateful for new friends we will treasure always, that we will soon miss.\n\n5. We have been blessed to host friends and family from the U.S. throughout the year, which has been a great source of joy and encouragement. Recent visitors have included Audrey Doak (late September); Ashley Ellison, Jennifer Maham, and Meredith Weatherby (early/mid October); and my parents, Bill and Genie Kilday (late October through mid-November). Thanks so much to all of you for coming!\n\n6. We are grateful that Cambodian mangoes -- one of our favorite treats of the whole year -- are back.\n\n7. We now have a massive and loud construction project right outside our apartment window, ten stories down. While we are most assuredly not thankful for the near constant noise, we are thankful that they waited until October before starting. We are also enjoying the daily live entertainment. There's nothing quite like watching a high-rise building being built by men wearing hardhats and flip-flops.\n\n8. We are thankful for noise ordinances back home. Oh, and also for weekends, especially of the quiet variety. The grinding and clanging of heavy machinery right outside our window starts at 6:00 am, and it usually continues well past midnight. Seven days a week -- yikes!\n\n9. We are thankful that the Houston Astros won the World Series. But why do we call it the \"World\" Series? We have learned here that much of the world laughs at Major League Baseball's presumptuous and curious choice of nomenclature.\n\n10. We are thankful for Hope International School, and the good and kind people our kids have met there. What a great collection of students -- from 30 different countries! -- and nurturing teachers. We were so lucky to find this place.\n\n11. We are grateful for the rain. We love way it cools and cleans this sweltering city while also bringing life and nourishment to the whole region and its food supply. The rain is good.\n\n12. We are thankful for tuk tuks. They are fun, easy, affordable, and readily available. They make it easy to navigate the city. And they have allowed Naeda to have more freedom here than she will likely have once we return to Austin. (Until she is driving. And that is frighteningly soon for our now-15-year-old.)\n\n13. We are grateful for books, and time to read and enjoy them. I've probably read more books this year than in the prior five years combined.\n\n14. We are thankful for the many things we have taken for granted. There are the obvious conveniences that we've missed having this year -- the dishwasher, an oven and a grill, the clothes dryer, a car. Then there are the things we didn't even realize we were taking for granted, such as clean air, electricity that consistently stays on, drinkable tap water, and a toothbrush we're not sharing with ants. But it cuts much deeper. We knew the numbers from IJM before we came -- 46 million people living in slavery, and four billion living outside the protection of the law. But now we better understand what that means. The numbers have become people. We have looked them in the eye. We have shared meals with them. We have heard their stories. We have fought for their rights. And it is all so much more real.\n\n15. There is much work to be done. We are thankful that we serve a God \"who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine.\" (Ephesians 3:20.) Because we are asking for a whole lot. And we will keep on asking. Please join us.\n\nWe wish all of you and your families a blessed and joyous Thanksgiving.\n\n- Doug\n\n“Home” for the Holidays\n\nI’m told we’ve been rather silent on the blog front, lately. Most likely you have not noticed, but on the rare chance you have noticed, know that it is on me. Doug, your faithful documenter of events, thank you note writer, and all-around good guy, gets a pass. I told him I’d write the next one, and then I just didn’t.\n\nI’m trying to think why. Yes, we’ve had a lot of visitors. But that has been such a joy – plenty to write about there. We’ve traveled a lot. But again, such a joy – plenty to say. Work has been both busy and at times slow, again – lots to say about that, and time to do it. Then there has been homework help (Python programming — really?!?). But I’m sure lots of you know about that and still manage to communicate with those around you. So what is my hold up?\n\nI wonder if it is because I’d like a blog to be able to tie this experience up in a nice neat package with a pretty gold, sparkly bow on top. To list out “Three Beautiful Things We’ve Learned In Three Months” or “The Five Ways I Saw God This Week.” And I can’t. Each day, most moments even, are a swirl for me of fascinating and frustrating. I am truly overwhelmed with gratitude that God gave us the opportunity to join in the lives, the struggles, and the pursuit of justice in Cambodia this year. And it has also, without a doubt, been the hardest thing I have ever done. I have learned so much, and continue to realize how much I don’t know.\n\nSo here you go – no bow, no tidy lessons, just a tiny glimpse into the mishmash that is my life these last few weeks with God, family and IJM in Cambodia.\n\n“Home” for the Holidays\n\nI love Thanksgiving in the USA. I love the crispness, the fall flavors of pumpkin and cinnamon, sipping coffee and making pies, sipping wine and playing games. And I love watching Doug (that all-around good guy) get excited about getting up at 4 am and filling the house with smells of rosemary, onion and I don’t even know what else as he charts out his basting schedules and temperatures on a giant turkey that he carefully prepares all day long. Oh, and I start playing Christmas music in October. I’m one of those people. First cold snap, and out it comes.\n\nWhich brings me to holidays in Cambodia. There is no cold snap. There is no Thanksgiving holiday. That’s not a complaint. This fall alone we’ve had a week to celebrate the Water Festival, and a day for independence from France, a day for the Paris Peace Accords, another for the King’s coronation and another for the King’s Father, and a few more for Pchum Ben which is a time to remember ancestors and take food to the monks and the ancestors in the pagodas. We definitely do holidays in Cambodia. But it is different. Then we walk into the office supply store that caters to “foreigners” and businesses and NGOs that employ foreigners, and there is an entire Christmas section. In a country that is only 3% Christian.\n\nI find myself struggling because I want to embrace the holidays, to play the music and make Christmas decorations with the kids, and find ways to make some familiar recipes. But when I do, many times I find myself feeling sad. I find it is not the music or the smells, it is the feeling of home – a concept that has necessarily become more complicated. And as much as this has been my home this year, I know we are leaving in a month and I find myself caught between at least two worlds. I want to be home and remember those familiar feelings. But to be here, I need to BE here – with haircuts and homework help, washing dishes and planning the next load of laundry because there is only so much room on the clothes drying rack in the next 24 hours and someone will need a clean towel or a gym uniform. And then that Christmas song comes on the player. I feel a quick burst of joy and warmth, and then a sadness that seeps in. Sometimes it overwhelms me. And I realize that it is maybe not the holidays I have loved, but the associations of home and family that comes with them. And those aren’t here. Being here is easier when I don’t remember “home.”\n\nHow do I get excited about coming home and still be engaged here?\n\nEven that question I am realizing, doesn’t fully capture my situation. I came to Cambodia thinking I would have 2 homes – Texas and Cambodia. Either/Or. But so much of what we have learned this year is that God is in and around us here AND there. God is before us, alongside us and ahead of us. God may call us only to one or two homes, but God’s people need help all over this world, and God may offer us the privilege of participating in that work. I think I have been approaching “home” as a two-dimensional question when we live in a three-dimensional world.\n\nA beautiful little slice of how this has impacted my family appeared as my boys and I ate pizza at a sidewalk café in Hiroshima, Japan (last, self-funded big trip). This may sound unrelated, but stay with me. I ate my pizza and listened with pride and awe as my 9 and 11 year olds reflected on differences they observed in how they had been taught World War II history, and how they had seen it explained at the memorials in Hiroshima. When we talked about how often vastly different perspectives are presented as “truth” to different groups of people, I asked them how we can be sure we are understanding enough to make good decisions. My 9-year old said, “Well, I think you’ve just got to go to the places and talk to people and see things for yourself.” This is not a statement from my adventure kid. This is from the child who cried most days for our first month here because he wanted to go home. When I see how much conflict we have in the US, and in the world, where we don’t understand each other and rarely try, I love that my children see value in getting into another person’s world and being open to learning their truth. That’s a little step towards God’s heaven, I think. And it wasn’t there before. We are stepping out. We are becoming more three-dimensional.\n\nSo in the midst of all this, here are four take-aways (for the tidy bow people among us):\n\nI miss “home” most at the holidays.\n\nI will treasure my deep-in-my-soul-and-built-over-years-of-traditions “home” more now, but am more aware of the call to be less attached to it.\n\nI am so proud of our children and how much they are learning about God, God’s people all over the world, and themselves.\n\nI miss clothes dryers. You really have no idea.\n\nGod made us to serve, and that service isn’t always where we are most comfortable. So this morning, when I would have had the Christmas music blaring through the house in Austin, I sat in the silence, wrote to you, and listened to the Cambodian rain.\n\nGod bless us all.\n\n- Thais\n\nChina: Beyond Pictures\n\nWhen we learned that we would be spending this year in Asia, my daydreams quickly took me to China. The Great Wall. The Forbidden City. Tiananmen Square. Dragons and pandas. A mysterious land of enchantment and rich culture. More than 3,500 years of fascinating history. China immediately went to #1 on my bucket list for places to try and visit this year. Last week, that vision -- that hope -- became a reality, and our family spent five unforgettable (and self-funded) days in Beijing.\n\nIt is true that a picture can paint a thousand words. We have already shared some of our China pictures. For those who are not on Facebook, many of those pictures are also included here. But some stories resist being painted with an image. For those stories, words are the only paintbrush that will do. Here are a few of those stories, along with what we learned from them.\n\n1. The right to have children is a precious freedom we have taken for granted. The people in China love children. They love their own children, and they also loved seeing our children. We had the good fortune of spending many hours interacting with ordinary people in China while visiting attractions, standing in lines, buying fruit, ordering meals, shopping for souvenirs, navigating our way through public transportation, etc. Despite language barriers, we succeeded in establishing some rudimentary level of communication with strangers, using hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language. The most frequent subject of these communications involved our kids. People were just as enchanted by our kids as we were with their country. People wanted to confirm that we actually had three children -- that these beautiful kids travelling with us were actually \"ours.\" When we responded with a nod, a smile, pointing gestures, and three raised fingers, the response was always one of joy and wonder. Three children! An unimaginable blessing! People beamed at us and our kids. And we re-learned the hard truth we already \"knew\" intellectually -- that almost no one in China has been allowed to have this gift. The \"one child policy\" was enforced for 36 years, and has only been slightly relaxed within the last two years. Every parent we met had only one child. And they were amazed and excited to meet someone so blessed to have three. This year has been eye-opening for us in so many ways, illuminating just how fortunate we are, and how many things we have always taken for granted. This one immediately soared to # 1 on that ever-growing list.\n\n2. Americans in China attract serious attention. Our tour guide told us that many Chinese citizens have never laid eyes on a foreigner, encountering them for the first time when visiting a large city like Beijing. The truth of that admonition was quickly revealed. We often felt like celebrities walking around Beijing. It was common for us to find ourselves on the receiving end of stares and/or pointing. We were often approached with a request for a posed picture. David was our most photographed celebrity -- parents from China loved taking pictures of their (one/only) child with David. But he was not alone. It happened to all of us. Thais and I were once approached by a gentlemen who handed me his phone and asked me to take his picture with her. (I was not invited to be in the picture.) I gladly obliged, but then we both found ourselves stunned when he reached down to hold Thais' hand, as though they were a couple. To his delight, I took the picture anyway. (It was a sobering reminder for me: Thais has options. Need to stay on her good side.) We also occasionally noticed people sneaking in front of us to take a selfie with the tall American giant behind them, and then celebrating that they successfully nabbed the picture. It was a strange but entertaining feature throughout our week.\n\n3. Line etiquette in China is a contact sport. We are accustomed to western norms for standing in line. You get your spot, and then you move forward in an orderly fashion, following those ahead when a gap in the line emerges. Everyone is entitled to a perimeter of at least a few inches of personal space, and care is taken not to push or bump into those around you. There is no \"cutting,\" and the collective will of the crowd enforces this shared expectation. Well, things are done very differently in China. Here is how it works. If there is any air space between you and the person next to you, behind you, or in front of you, it will be very quickly filled. It may be filled when you are pushed into it (and into those surrounding you), or it may be filled by someone darting around and ahead of you. Any ill-advised choice to leave a gap of air space is an open invitation for others behind you to cut past you in line. And they do, with no hesitation. These were jarring revelations. We stood in a very lengthy queue in Tiananmen Square to enter the mausoleum for Chairman Mao Tse-Tung. The square was filled with switchback lines snaking across concrete, with metal barricades blocking off the queue on both sides. The line was just wide enough for four people standing shoulder to shoulder. In keeping with western line etiquette, we assumed our positions with one row of three Kildays, and another row of two behind, leaving a generous amount of personal space on all sides. Within seconds, those entering the line behind us zoomed past, laughing at our mistakes and leaving us in their dust. We remained at the tail end of the line, as we continued to watch newcomers treat us like nothing more than a a \"line entrance\" signpost. We quickly regrouped and made a plan. We stood shoulder to shoulder in a tight row of four, with one serving as a scout to warn of incoming line-busters. This worked well on the long straightaway. But as we made our first turn, an opening was created on the outside corner. We had two dozen opportunistic line-busters run past, while laughing, before we could move forward to close the inadvertent floodgate. This happened again at the next turn. Our family looked like Tennessee's run defense against Georgia Tech, but that's another story. We made a key halftime adjustment. When we approached the next turn, our row of four expanded to five, locking arms for an impenetrable barrier through the turn. This completely stymied the opposition, and our defense held firm. It became a competitive contact sport from that point forward. We gained some respect and admiration from those in line with us, as we adapted nicely to our new cultural environment and held firmly to our place in line. But there was this one very petite, older lady behind us who was determined to get through our American line of defense. (I called her the \"evil grandma.\") She attacked us at every turn, trying to sneak under, around, or through our locked arms. It was a fierce, two-hour battle. One time, she tried the battering ram approach, with a punishing body check between Thais and me. Her attempt fell short, and our bruised arms kept her behind us. By this time the people in front of us in line were cheering us on, as we celebrated our mounting victories. The mausoleum was probably not worth the long wait in line, but I'm glad we had this unique experience and the family bonding time of building our very own great wall in China. Hooray Team Kilday!\n\n4.Human ingenuity is alive and well in China. There is no private ownership of land in China, but we learned about an interesting quirk showing how resilient the human spirit can be in claiming rights that we in the U.S. like to call \"inalienable.\" All land in China is owned by the government. Land is made available for \"homeowners\" under a non-transferable 70-year lease, with the land reverting to the government upon death of the homeowner or at the conclusion of the 70 years, whichever comes first. These laws do not allow a family home to be passed down to the younger generation -- an issue that has only recently caused widespread consternation. As Chinese citizens have looked for ways around this restriction, a solution has emerged. It's complicated, and a little strange, but this is absolutely brilliant. An aging couple in this situation can take the following steps. First, legally get divorced, leaving title to the 70-year lease in the name of the husband. Second, have your child (in this example, a son) legally get divorced from his wife. Now, here comes the strange and awkward part -- third, have the father legally marry his former daughter-in-law, placing the lease in the name of both. Fourth, have the father and former daughter-in-law legally divorce, leaving the lease in her name. Fifth and Sixth, the two original couples re-marry, with the lease now in the name of both the son and the daughter-in-law. Three divorces and three marriages later, the original goal is accomplished. While I vastly prefer just treating private ownership of property as a legally protected right, I applaud and admire the ingenuity of the citizens of China for finding a way of claiming these rights over the protestations of their government.\n\nOur week in China was unforgettable, awe-inspiring, educational, and just delightful. Thank you for joining us for this amazing part of our journey!\n\n- Doug\n\nGod Is Our Refuge\n\nThe world can be an unsteady and dangerous place. In recent days we have watched helplessly from a great distance as a devastating hurricane ripped through our home state of Texas, killing people, destroying homes, and wrecking lives. Recent monsoon floods have caused much greater human tragedy in South Asia, with more than 1,200 lives lost in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Dozens have been killed in Mexico in the strongest earthquake in a century. Wildfires have ravaged the western U.S., destroying homes and forcing thousands to flee. More dangerous hurricanes are on the way in the U.S. and Mexico, promising more destruction. Hurricane Irma has already caused great destruction on its way to the U.S. mainland, in Barbuda, St. Martin/St. Maarten, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and many other places in the Caribbean. It's one hit after another.\n\nOf course, the storms of this life are not limited to the weather. The newspapers on all sides of the globe are filled with daily stories of racism, genocide, human cruelty, crime, terrorism, war, and human suffering. Every day at work Thais and I are confronted with real-life examples of human trafficking and exploitation of the poor and the vulnerable. This very year we have watched the deteriorating political climate in both our permanent home and our 2017 home (example from this week, with no comment, at this link), with growing unease and worry. Like all of you, we have family, friends, and loved ones who are fighting personal battles that are constantly in our thoughts and prayers. And we have battles of our own. We all do. It can feel overwhelming -- a storm surge that threatens to drown out all else.\n\nWhere to turn?\n\nThe Psalms tell us that \"God is our refuge\" in a time of storms and trials. This word appears repeatedly -- God is our refuge, and we can take refuge in God. (See Psalm 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 31, 37, 46, 57, 59, 61, 62, 64, 71, 73, 91, 94, 118, 119, 141, 142, 144.) But what does that mean?\n\nThis was a question that we discussed recently in one of our devotions at work, as we were reading through Psalm 62. What does it mean to find a place of \"refuge\"?\n\nAfter a long period of silence, I volunteered an answer. The image that came to my mind was a specific location my family had visited in England when I was 14 years old. The famous hymn \"Rock of Ages\" was written in 1763 by Reverend Augustus Toplady. He was caught in a terrible storm in a gorge known as Burrington Combe. He found a crevice in the craggy cliff that was large enough for him to hide himself and take shelter -- to take \"refuge\" from the storm. He reportedly wrote the hymn in that very spot: \"Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.\" My example was well received, and I was momentarily feeling a false sense of pride, like a student who thought he had given the correct answer in class.\n\nThat feeling was short lived. I quickly learned -- again -- that mine is most assuredly a sheltered, privileged, and first-world perspective.\n\nOur Cambodian friends were pressed to comment, and a much more compelling narrative emerged. As recently as the late 1990s, this country was still engaged in a fierce, dangerous, and violent battle. The Khmer Rouge had been ousted from power by the North Vietnamese in 1979. But there were still many pockets throughout the country where the Khmer Rouge had power, influence, and people with weapons. It's hard to believe or accept now, but the U.S. and other western governments continued to recognize the Khmer Rouge as the legitimate government of Cambodia through much of this period, despite the horrific genocide of the late 1970s. The fighting in Cambodia continued until Pol Pot's death in 1997. Our staff spoke of nightly bombings and gunfire. Their childhoods were a daily and nightly struggle for survival. Most of their families had used shovels to dig makeshift bomb shelters under their huts, where they could hide and protect themselves during nightly fighting. When the sounds of gunfire and bombs filled the night, this is where they would take shelter. This was their hiding place for safety and security. This was their place of refuge.\n\nThe dictionary says that a \"refuge\" is a place that provides shelter or protection. While it's nice to find a refuge from a storm in a gorge in England, the stories of our work colleagues pierced my heart. They have faced struggles and hardships I assume and hope I will never know. They have lived through a daily fear of violence that is completely foreign to me. They understand what it truly means to find a place of refuge.\n\nThe Psalms tell us that \"God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.\" (Psalm 46:1.) With God as our refuge, we need not fear -- we will not fear -- even as the earth gives way and as the waters roar. (Psalm 46:2-3.) Our souls can find rest in God, and in God alone. (Psalm 62:1.) God is with us, and we can \"be still\" when we face struggles and storms, and know that our God is God. (Psalm 46:10-11.) That does not mean the storm will magically disappear. It means that God is with us, and we need not be afraid. It means we can take comfort in being in God's presence, trusting in the promise of eternal life. It means that the creator of the universe cares about our daily struggles and shares in them with us. God with us -- Emmanuel.\n\nAnd then, after finding our refuge in the presence of God, we roll up our sleeves and help those in need. Because that's what we do. That's what God calls us to do. It has been inspiring to see people from all walks of life step forward to do just that for our brothers and sisters along the Texas coast. We wish we could be there with you. For all those who have answered the call, we salute you, and we thank you. We are praying for all those affected by the storms.\n\nFor anyone struggling with how to cope with the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, or really any kind of struggle, I recommend Jill Williams' excellent sermon -- \"Out of the Chaos.\" It is filled with wisdom, spiritual perspective, and practical ways that all of us can \"move toward places of pain\" and \"become wounded healers to God's wounded world.\" If you don't have time to hear a 22-minute sermon, here is a link to information on Covenant's website, with specific ways you can help.\n\nGod bless you all, and stay safe.\n\n- Doug\n\nBack in Our Groove\n\nFall is always a busy time of excitement and change back to the familiar. The unstructured chaos of summer gives way to a season of schedules and routines. Alarm clocks beckon all of us earlier in the morning for the daily rhythm of the school calendar. The words “school bus,” “homework,” and “test” reenter our vocabulary. (And, of course, so does the word “touchdown.”) The season is tinged with the anticipation of upcoming holidays and family gatherings. For us this particular fall, the anticipation will be amplified, but it will also carry the bittersweet recognition that long-awaited reunions and gatherings will be preceded by some hard “goodbyes.” So many things are different for us this year, but there is nevertheless a welcome familiarity to the arrival of fall. Here are some of our highlights as we move toward our last quarter in Cambodia.\n\n1. First, some great news from the office. Our IJM-Cambodia Legal Department is continuing its 2017 winning streak. We have now fully completed six trials, and our undefeated record has brought 14 convictions (!) against those involved in the modern-day slave trade. Some of these victories fall into the “miraculous” category, and we have no doubt that we are watching God’s hand at work. It’s humbling, encouraging, and inspiring to be a part of what God and IJM are doing in this country, and we are so grateful to all of you for your help in sending us here. If interested, here is a recent article about one of our victories.\n\n2. We finished a seventh trial last Monday, and we have our eighth tomorrow. (Our Labor Day holiday was on May 1, so Sept. 4 is just another work day in Cambodia. While our U.S. friends are firing up the grill tomorrow, we will be hard at work in court seeking to stop those who exploit others for their labor. What a perfect Labor Day!) Verdict announcements on those two trials will come later in September. Please pray for justice, and enjoy a hamburger or a hot dog for us!\n\n3. In case you’ve ever wondered how to celebrate a big trial victory in Cambodia, it’s pretty simple: a tasty afternoon snack of water buffalo meat. I’m really not sure why we don’t do this in Austin….\n\n4. In mid-August, Thais and I celebrated our 24th wedding anniversary at the Phnom Penh Foreign Correspondents’ Club. This is a historic place where western journalists would gather to write and edit their stories for the New York Times, the Washington Post, etc. in the years during and immediately following the Vietnam War. These corridors have become a history museum, displaying news stories written between these walls. It’s a great venue for learning about the past, watching the bustling riverside area from a magnificent balcony, and looking out over the Mekong River as the sun sets behind you. Good times.\n\n5. We have felt so helpless and heartbroken as we have watched horrific news back home of the devastation brought by Hurricane Harvey. Unfortunately, Texas is not alone in having experienced late August flooding. Monsoon floods last week in South Asia (India, Bangladesh, and Nepal) have taken more than 1,200 lives and have left millions of people homeless. Our team has prayed for Texas and South Asia alike, and we will continue to lift up all those who have lost life and property in these devastating storms.\n\n6. In our mid-day time of prayer and worship at the office, we have been working our way through the Psalms in sequence since April. This past Wednesday, as the floodwaters in Houston and South Asia were peaking, Thais was on tap to lead. The calendar told us we were reading Psalm 69 – a prayer from David pleading for help in a time of flooding:\n\nThis was another in a long line of “coincidences” this year, where the Word lines up with our work or our lives with urgent relevance. Like David, we pray for rescue for all those in harm’s way (Psalm 69:14-15), and for God’s help as we “rebuild the cities.” (Psalm 69:35)\n\n7. Praying for all of us in the aftermath of Charlottesville as well -- for healing, peace, and racial reconciliation. A whole lot of God-sized problems in this world, and the U.S. is proving that it has just as many of them, and just as big, as the developing world.\n\n8. Tomorrow the kids start their 4th week back at school. We now have a high schooler (9th grade), a middle schooler (6th grade), and one still in elementary school (4th grade). It’s safe to say they have all learned a ton in this year we will never forget. So proud of all three of these kids!\n\n9. For those who have followed the saga of the knee injury, Naeda is now off her crutches and her knee brace, and she reports being at least 90% healed. She is well enough that she is participating in volleyball practice, now with the high school team (!), and she plans to play in the first game this Tuesday. We are grateful for her quick recovery! And if you missed this story, just check out the last blog.\n\n10. Some of the greatest blessings of this year have come in very small but impactful moments. Here is one example. Every school day as I walk the kids to their 6:50 am bus stop, we encounter the same familiar faces. Two of those faces are women who sell drinks and cabbage sandwiches from moto carts just one block north of our apartment. There has always been a language barrier, but they recognize us, and we greet each other warmly every day with a smile and a nod of acknowledgement. On the first day back to school, there was such deep concern on their faces when Naeda showed with visible evidence of a real injury. They were truly worried about her. And there was no way for us to explain that she would be ok. Well, you should have seen these two ladies beaming and overjoyed with happiness when Naeda was back to walking again with no crutches and no knee brace. We shared an indescribable moment of warmth, relief, joy, and celebration. I still marvel at the kindness of people here, and the powerful and unifying force of a smile, compassion, and love for others across cultural and language barriers. People can be so good, and God is so good for bringing so many of those people into our lives.\n\n11. We were surprised and thrilled to receive an incredible care package recently from the staff and the Mission Committee of Covenant Presbyterian Church, our awesome home church back in Austin. Thank you so much to each one of you for your kindness, thoughtfulness, words of encouragement, prayers, and support for our family. We are so blessed to be in community with you, and we thank God for you every day. Your precious notecards are on our refrigerator (because, of course), and everyone has delighted in receiving familiar treats from home.\n\n12. Add “window washers” to the long list of things that are very different here. (I’m not sure OSHA would approve….)\n\n13. Speaking of OSHA, aren't you glad you're not the one who has to re-wire this mess?\n\n14. The constant presence of rain has liberating side effects. Last Monday Thais had a work project that kept her at the office a bit late, and I was done early. We had trial in the morning, and my day had started earlier than usual. I decided to head home on foot, with Thais coming behind me an hour or so later with our tuk tuk driver. About two-thirds of the way home, the heavens opened, and the afternoon monsoon rains began to descend on me. I was too stubborn to get a tuk tuk for the remaining five minutes of my walk. I had already walked this far, right? So I just kept on walking at a leisurely pace. The rain grew heavier and heavier, as though taunting me. But I would not yield. I got completely drenched, suit and tie and all, Gene Kelly style. I’ve never been so wet while wearing a suit, and it was fun to just not care. I laughed the whole way. What a year….\n\nMay all of you find laughter and joy in the small and big moments of each new day. God bless you all!\n\n- Doug\n\nA Joyful Reunion\n\nIn Texas, August is a month custom-made for vacations and escaping the blistering late Summer heat. This year is very different in so many ways, but August has remained our vacation month of choice. We were so excited to have some of our closest friends come to visit us this month -- friends who were making their own August escape from the Texas heat. And we had the wonderful privilege of travelling with them to see some beautiful places.\n\nThese are not just any friends. The Baskins and the Kildays have been tight for more than a decade. Thais and I have been part of a small group with Joy and JJ Baskin for most of those years, and the Baskins and Kildays almost always sit together in church on Sundays. We have hosted the Baskin family many times to celebrate Christmas Eve. The Baskins have hosted the Kilday clan many times for Easter Egg hunts and Trick-or-Treat \"practice\" in their neighborhood a few days before Halloween. We have gone on church retreats together. We have served on church committees together. We have enjoyed pool parties, dinner gatherings, and many Sunday afternoon lunches together. The Baskins are our people.\n\nOn Easter Sunday in 2014, we learned some of the hardest news we've ever received. JJ had been diagnosed with non-smoker's lung cancer that had spread to his brain. It was a devastating blow. He was 47, and he was one of my very closest friends. Our families were fused together even more tightly during the ensuing months, as our friends fought a valiant and very public battle. Being with JJ, Joy, and their boys during that year was powerful, inspirational, heartbreaking, uplifting, spiritual, and unforgettable. We prayed together. We laughed and cried together. We watched some football and an occasional movie. We told stupid jokes and got each other wound up into epic battles of one-liners. We talked endlessly about politics, family, college football, God, life, death, and hope. Always hope. We spent time together in living rooms, hospital rooms, the ICU, and rehab centers. I was honored to give rides to the patient and his kids, as the needs arose. We texted constantly. We made promises about looking after those he loved. And in March 2015, we were with the Baskins on JJ's last earthly day, as he and Joy celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary with the sacrament of Holy Communion.\n\nJJ's life and death in March 2015 were profound for all who knew him. He and his family trusted in God's promises, leaned on hope, and soared through adversity. They just soared. And they invited all of us in to do likewise with them. That year, and these friendships, have changed all of us forever.\n\nThere is a direct link between the Baskin story and our lives on the other side of the world this year. We are serving with IJM in Cambodia because God called us here. But there is no doubt that our walk with the Baskins exponentially grew our openness to hearing and following that call.\n\nIt was therefore fitting and appropriate that Joy, Ben, and Judge Baskin came to be with us in Cambodia this month. We delighted in introducing them to our friends and work colleagues here. We showed them around our favorite spots in Phnom Penh. And then we set out for the magnificent temples of Siem Reap and the beautiful island of Phuket, Thailand. We have looked forward to being with our friends all year, and our time with them did not disappoint.\n\nIn Phnom Penh, the Baskins came to our office, prayed with our team, and joined us for lunch at our favorite Pho restaurant. We showed them the local market and the Foreign Correspondents' Club. They toured the Royal Palace and the Toul Sleng Genocide Museum (with Naeda). They walked many a mile in our footsteps here and learned what our lives are like. And then we took a road trip -- a self-funded one, of course.\n\nFirst we took a six-hour van ride to see and show the Cambodian countryside and the magnificent temples of Siem Reap. (Well, we all went to Siem Reap. Most of the Kildays had \"been there, done that\" and preferred relaxing, hanging out at the hotel, and feasting on an enormous breakfast buffet!) We also went out to the Night Art Market and experienced a most unique foot massage with exfoliating fish.\n\nAfter Siem Reap, we made our first international trip since our arrival in Cambodia. Our reunited group of eight took a plane to the stunningly gorgeous island of Phuket, in Thailand. We had an unbelievable Airbnb house with a spectacular view of the Andaman Sea. It was so beautiful and relaxing there that we had difficulty convincing anyone to leave, even for a few hours at the beach.\n\nUnfortunately, the trip was not all sunshine and roses. In retrospect, we should have deferred to the kids' reluctance to leave the house. On our one and only mass excursion down to beautiful Surin Beach, we learned just how rough, dangerous, and violent the surf there can be. The kids stayed close to shore, but the waves were still occasionally in the range of at least 6 feet high at the shoreline, knocking kids and grownups alike down to the hard sand. Naeda had the misfortune of meeting two giant waves back-to-back, with the second catching her right leg awkwardly as she was attempting to stand back up. The next few hours were an alarming mix -- lifeguards, a ride in an ambulance, a visit to a Thai emergency room, a sports medicine specialist, and physical therapy on how to use crutches and a knee brace. Our volleyball star has a sprained ligament (MCL) in her right knee. She was disappointed to be injured on vacation, but she was a good sport. She will be off crutches in a matter of days, and back to 100% in another month or so. A close call, and we are grateful it wasn't worse.\n\nToward the end of our time together, we took an amazing boat tour through Thailand's Phang Nga Bay. This area was once part of the world's largest coral reef. Millions of years ago, the reef died, forming deposits of calcium carbonate hundreds of meters thick. As the earth's tectonic plates collided, these deposits were forced upward, forming uniquely shaped islands that rise from the sea. Our tour took us around the bay, with stops to hike through caves, kayaking through caves, some time to swim and relax on a gorgeous beach, and a wonderful lunch at a beachfront Thai restaurant. Please let us know if you are headed to this area, so we can recommend a boat tour you will never forget! (I tried to convince Thais to let me stay behind with our injured athlete, but Momma Kilday was extremely territorial about the caretaker role.)\n\nRegrettably, all good things must come to an end. We sent our friends back home to Austin last weekend and made our way back to Phnom Penh. It was bittersweet -- so good to be together, but hard to say goodbye. We are now four months away from heading back home to Austin. In many ways, it has been hard to think about leaving this place. But being with our friends has allowed us to think about late December with joy, optimism, and excitement.\n\nAnd hope. Always hope.\n\nThank you Baskin family! We are so grateful for our time here with you. We love you all....\n\n- Doug\n\nThe Best Oath in Recorded Human History\n\nI’m not sure how we have managed to live here for six months without knowing the oath that is taken by witnesses before they testify in a Cambodian court. I’ve been to court with our team here many times, but no one ever translates the oath for me since it’s a routine matter. My eyes were opened to greatness earlier this week. This is just sublime.\n\nMy favorites –\n\nFrom the oath itself:\n\nFrom the admonition given by the Court, before the oath is administered:\n\nThat's right -- \"a miserable and violent death by means of bullets, electricity, lightning, tiger bites, and snake strikes.\" What I truly love is the word \"and.\" Somehow all of these disparate means of inflicting a torturous and painful death are supposed to converge all at once. Please be very careful when you testify....\n\nThe oath does provide an upside:\n\nThis positive note of encouragement is reinforced by the Court:\n\nI defy you to find a more compelling and attention-grabbing oath than this gem of brilliance in Cambodia. Unless and until someone finds something better (good luck!), I'm declaring this the best oath in recorded human history. If interested, here is the full text, from Cambodia's Code of Criminal Procedure:\n\nI hope all of you are well. And may your forest guardians grant you long life, good health, abundant possessions, and respectful and loving families.\n\n- Doug\n\nA New Home\n\nAbout a year ago, I found out that my parents were thinking of applying for a job that would change our whole family dynamic. Then they started to get more serious about it and I got worried. Then they got accepted. And I hated it. I hated the idea of packing up my house in bags and taking them across the world. I hated the thought of leaving all my friends from church and school. I hated the idea of leaving my dog for a year. I hated my parents, even though I knew deep down the work that they would be doing was a once in a lifetime opportunity. And I felt like I hated God.\n\nI had every intention of hating it. I didn’t want to make friends. I just wanted to go to school, go back to wherever we were living and talk to my friends back home. My mindset was just to do whatever I could do to ignore the fact that we are living in this place. By 30 hours after landing I was in a taxi cab, going to school. That Friday, they played “Oceans”, and I just sat down on the floor and cried. “Oceans” was the song we sang in Journey, my youth choir back in Austin. It talks about walking “into the great unknown, where feet may fail.” So there I was, this new girl just sitting on the floor crying hysterically. Totally normal. Anyways, by the end of the week I had a group of friends, and was preparing to go on a school retreat after being in the country for less than a week. And I was still jet lagged. So it was great. (Not really.) During camp I made even more friends and ate pretty normal food which I wasn’t expecting at all.\n\nI ended up joining the school volleyball team and even though I was new, I was voted to be the captain of the team. Even though it could be very frustrating I learned that not only am I good at volleyball, but I enjoy it. Close to the end of the year, the schools counselor asked me if I would like to teach cheerleading to the little kids at school and I did. Even though I missed Austin (just to be clear I still miss it like crazy!) I was starting to get used to Cambodia which was weird. Part of me doesn’t want to get used to it. I didn’t want to like it here. I didn’t think I would like it here, but as we make plans now to go back part of me doesn’t want to go. It’s so much more relaxed and laid back here. All of my friends are super nice and I feel like I don’t have to fit in to be cool at school. I really like that part.\n\nI remember a bunch of people talking to me before I left and the one thing that they all said in one way or another was, “I know that this is tough for you right now and it might be when you get there, but when you get home and look back on that year you will be so glad you did it.” So as my year in Cambodia is more than halfway over and I am looking back on all that has happened to me over this year, I honestly wouldn’t change it. Those people were right.\n\nSome of the things I have learned so far in Cambodia:\n\n- I can play volleyball\n\n- Pork and rice is really good\n\n- There is a thing as too much pasta\n\n- Spain is NOT in Mexico, it is its own country\n\n- Brands aren’t everything\n\n- Family is key (even though they can annoy the heck out of me sometimes)\n\n- Whales are scary\n\n- If you leave your air conditioning on, my Dad WILL take the remote and make you suffer\n\n- Elephants are pretty chill\n\n- The washing machine here sings a 1 minute long song and it can get annoying really quickly\n\n- It’s ok to be sad\n\n- You can have more than one home\n\nMm, k bye!\n\n- Naeda\n\nHalftime Report\n\nToday marks the actual day that divides Kilday Family Adventure v.2017, Cambodia edition, into two equal parts. Really hard to believe! With that milestone in mind, here are the thoughts of the day, along with some observations and lessons learned – our 2017 halftime report.\n\n1. While we look forward to reunions with friends and family back home (along with Zoey the family dog), we also can’t stand the thought of saying goodbye to the friends we’ve made here. So this marker is bittersweet.\n\n2. We have now been here long enough to attend both a wedding and a funeral. We have shared joys and sorrows, struggles and celebrations, and birthdays and anniversaries. What a privilege to share life with our IJM-Cambodia team and our kids’ friends from school.\n\n3. Cambodian conveniences that will be most sorely missed: the 5-10 minute work commute, year-round swimming weather, a gym at our place of residence, tuk tuks on every corner, the 2-dollar haircut, uncluttered personal calendars, and work commitments that generally constrain themselves to office hours.\n\n4. American conveniences that are most eagerly anticipated upon our return home: drinkable tap water, the ability to walk, run, and play on grass (ok, even seeing grass), odor free walks (on sidewalks!), driving our own vehicles, and using a dishwasher, clothes dryer, and grill/smoker. Ready to fire up the Big Green Egg, for whoever wants to come over.\n\n5. We are two months into “monsoon” season here. Admittedly, it’s early yet. This seven-month “season” runs into November. But so far it has been shockingly pleasant. We typically have rain every day for an hour or two, usually starting around 3:00 pm or later. Sometimes it comes down in buckets, occasionally with loud thunder and lightning. The rain provides welcome refreshment for the city, cleaning streets and temporarily removing dust and odors. It provides relief from the tropical heat. And it provides sustenance for this country – irrigating crops and providing habitat for the fish, birds, and wildlife in and around the rivers, lakes, and wetlands. We are appreciating the near-daily rhythm of afternoon rain, and we are wondering how Texas might import this tradition during the dreary and hot Summer.\n\n6. Having mastered the art of eating fried crickets, which I have now sampled on four occasions, this week I was “offered” a frog. There may have been some brief goading and peer pressure from our female work colleagues. (Hey, when in Rome. . . .) For what it's worth, the crickets are better.\n\n7. We have somehow become reasonably well adjusted to one of the most insane experiences that is part of everyday life here. We now confidently walk right through oncoming traffic to cross the street. This requires great trust in the social compact – no one wants anyone else killed, and no one wants anyone else’s moto or tuk tuk damaged. Somehow this works well. When you walk across the street through traffic here, the motos, tuk tuks, and cars just slow down or change direction to avoid imminent bodily harm and/or property damage. It’s a miracle that this cartoonish scene now seems almost normal. Fair warning: we will likely need some coaching on crossing the street when we return home.\n\n8. On the first Sunday of June, Cambodia had “commune” elections across the country. This was viewed as an important snapshot and a potential bellwether for next year’s national elections. There was fiery rhetoric. There were threats and concerns about potential violence. There was even scary talk of the potential for civil war. Schools were cancelled on the Friday before the election, when the two main political parties had dueling rallies of 100,000-plus each in Phnom Penh. We prepared for the worst, just in case, with a small stockpile of cash, groceries, and directions to the U.S. Embassy. Fortunately, none of the doomsday worries came to fruition. It was a calm and peaceful result, giving both sides something to brag about in the lead-up to next year.\n\n9. Here is what really struck me about the election. Despite considerable obstacles, voter turnout was estimated to be in the range of 85-90%. Some of our work colleagues had to drive 6-7 hours or more to vote in their home provinces, turning the simple act of voting into a 2-3 day ordeal. Travelling “home” to vote was a widely shared experience. Yet nearly everyone voted. We could use some of that sense of duty in our democracy when it comes to voting.\n\n10. Summer break from school is short in Cambodia – just two months. The kids currently have their own Superwoman with them here for a third week, in the form of their Austin grandmother (Kay Davenport). She has organized her own amazing “Grandmommy Camp” for the kids here at the apartment, including art with markers, woodcraft projects, and just a bit of math to keep all that school learning fresh.\n\n11. It is a season of comings and goings at work. Two of our colleagues who are part of the IJM internship/fellowship program will be returning home in the next couple of weeks. We also have three new interns who have just arrived from the U.S., bringing fresh energy, joy, experience, and perspective to the team.\n\n12. In a testament to how unifying the cause against global slavery is, IJM-Cambodia now has three SEC football fans from rival schools in its small group of interns and fellows. Our showing of unity is this: Instead of arguing about Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida, we have simply agreed to focus on ending Alabama’s oppressive reign of SEC dominance. (I’m sure Nick Saban is very afraid….)\n\n13. Thais and I both share our work desks and our computer keyboards with tiny ants. How many of you can say that? They are clever, because they realize they are safest between the keys. No one wants to inadvertently type “dfdfdfdf” while chasing an ant.\n\n14. We have learned the hard way that our local grocery stores are not always consistent or reliable. From mid-April through early June, we found ourselves caught in an unpleasant grocery game that we grudgingly called “milk roulette.” Our trusted brand of milk mysteriously disappeared from the shelves. This sent our family on a near-daily quest of trying new brands and new sources, with very unhappy and usually sour results. Fortunately, after about a six-week hiatus, our trusted brand was mercifully re-stocked, and we were back in business. So, add the neighborhood HEB grocery store to the list of things we have taken for granted, and that we will look forward to seeing when we are back in Texas.\n\n15. We have bought our return tickets home! We will arrive back in Austin on the evening of Friday, Dec. 29. We had originally planned to be home by Christmas, but we ended up needing to rent out our house through Dec. 31. That left us awkwardly homeless for the holidays, and with all winter clothes/gear locked up in a storage room inside the house. To compound the complexity, the school semester here in Phnom Penh runs through Friday, Dec. 22, giving us a tight squeeze for crossing the globe to get home for Christmas. We were in a bit of a quandary. Do we spend Christmas here? Do we rush home and stay with family, with no access to winter clothing and no time to prepare for Christmas morning? We wanted to celebrate our kids and provide them with a memorable and special Christmas to conclude this year. They have sacrificed so much – each one of them. After exploring all the options, we decided to finish off Kilday Family Adventure v.2017 with a quick holiday detour to the Happiest Place on Earth. So, we will travel to Orlando instead of Austin on Dec. 22-23, and then we will spend Christmas week with our favorite mouse and his friends. (Like all other Kilday “excursions” this year outside of Phnom Penh, this one will be on us. No donated funds will be used for the side trip other than the cross-Pacific flight, which is roughly the same cost as a one-way ticket to Austin.) We hope that ending this momentous chapter with an exclamation mark instead of a period will focus our hearts and our minds on all there is to celebrate when we do leave behind some wonderful friends in this beautiful and wondrous place.\n\nFor now, we look forward to what’s next here. We will celebrate each day for the gift that it is. And we will continue to do our part to help in God’s work of bringing justice here.\n\nGod bless you all.\n\n- Doug\n\nLaw and Order -- Cambodia Unit\n\nQuick update to catch you up on some great news, and to share some observations about the workings of the criminal justice system here.\n\nFirst, the news. In the last nine weeks, our team at IJM-Cambodia has completed three trials against those involved in the modern-day slave trade. All three cases have involved cross-border human trafficking -- recruiting networks that have used deception to lure and trap very poor and vulnerable people into exploitation outside of Cambodia. These cases have involved three different destination countries (Thailand, Malaysia, and China) and three different industries/case types (fishing, domestic servitude, and bride trafficking). It has been fascinating and challenging work. We have watched God work miracles, and we have marveled at the great progress happening before our very eyes. Three cases, three wins, and ten convictions!\n\nBelow are some links to accounts of two of these cases. (The third did not receive any coverage.)\n\nConviction of Major Labor Trafficking Network for Thai Fishing Industry (IJM article, May 2017):\n\nMedia Coverage from Cambodia Daily\n\nMedia Coverage from Phnom Penh Post\n\nMedia Coverage from Khmer Times\n\nIJM-Cambodia Trial Against Bride Trafficking Network (June 2017):\n\nKhmer Times Article\n\nPhnom Penh Post Article\n\nCambodia Daily Article\n\nGod is on the move in this country. We can see it and feel it. Tomorrow we will join our team for our second quarterly prayer retreat, where we will give praise to the One who makes justice possible. And, to quote IJM Founder and CEO Gary Haugen, \"We will keep asking for more. We will keep asking for more.\"\n\nMany of you have asked us about how the system works here. What's the same? What's different? We are in a much better position to answer some of those questions now. Here are a few observations:\n\n• Under Cambodian law, a criminal trial is consolidated with a claim for civil compensation. That means the victim’s lawyer (our IJM legal team) gets a seat at the table when the criminal trial takes place. We have a right to cross-examine witnesses and make closing arguments at trial, alongside the prosecutors and defense attorneys. It’s a three-party trial, and the victim is one of those parties.\n\n• There is no right to a jury trial here. Trial is to a single judge or a panel of three judges, depending on the severity of the offense. Felonies are crimes with a sentence of more than five years, and all felony trials are heard by a three-judge panel. Misdemeanors are crimes with a sentence up to five years, and misdemeanor trials are heard by a single judge.\n\n• Criminal charges are made by a judicial official called an Investigating Judge (IVJ). When a prosecutor believes charges are warranted, the prosecutor submits a written report with supporting evidence to the IVJ. The IVJ then conducts a “Judicial Investigation,” with witnesses being summoned to give statements that are put in writing. Each witness puts a thumbprint on his or her own statement. After completing the Judicial Investigation, the IVJ either closes the case with no charges, or forwards the case on to trial with formal charges. The IVJ does not participate in the trial, which is heard by a different judge or a three-judge panel.\n\n• When trial begins, the written statements from the Judicial Investigation are already part of the record. The trial judge or judges read all of those statements before the trial begins. Witnesses do not have to repeat the “testimony” they have already given. When a witness is put on the stand, it is for cross-examination only. The judges get the first shot, followed by the prosecution, defense, and victim’s lawyer.\n\n• Because so much of the record is made before trial begins, the trial itself is short. The three trials I have attended have started and finished in a half-day. (Trials in the U.S. typically range from 1 day to several weeks.)\n\n• Court hearings and trials reliably fail to start on time. They typically begin about 60-90 minutes after the scheduled time. Everyone here knows this, and they plan accordingly. (Warning: the transplanted American lawyer can find this highly uncomfortable.)\n\n• Trial concludes with an anti-climactic scheduling of a verdict announcement a week or a few weeks later, when the verdict and judgment will be read in court. It's deeply unsatisfying on the day of trial, but so far our team has been rewarded for its patience.\n\nIt is different, but it is good.\n\nI constantly have to pinch myself. Somehow we have been given this gift of getting to participate in this work. I go to the office every day with the goal of actually helping to free slaves, send slave traffickers to jail, and help protect the poor from violence. I have never felt more alive and filled with purpose. IJM stands up for the lost, the vulnerable, the voiceless, the oppressed, the poor, and the forgotten. It is God’s work. It’s big, important, meaningful, and deeply fulfilling. The work of our office is making a tremendous difference out here in the real world. So we are grateful. We are constantly reminded that all of you helped make this happen through your prayers and financial support. With full hearts, we send you our thanks. We will never forget the blessings that you made possible. God bless you all!\n\n- Doug\n\nWe Are the World\n\nThere are shrieks coming from behind Naeda’s door. Shrieks and peels of laughter. And music. Suddenly, eight teenagers come running out with phones and cameras to film each other performing the latest dare. “Mr. Doug, I’m so sorry! Naeda is getting me back!” the giant man-child says as he gives Doug a bear hug and mumbles, “I love you.” They all scream in laughter and run back into Naeda’s room, as Doug shouts, “I love you, too!” (They squeal and shriek with more laughter.)\n\nNaeda is celebrating the upcoming end of middle school with some of her school friends. In some ways, it has been so typical for what we would expect from a middle school end of year party at home in Texas:\n\nHowever much pizza you buy, the teenagers could have eaten more.\n\nThey love chips, Coke, pizza and chocolate chip cookies. OK, they’ll drink some water if you make them.\n\nThey squeal and play “Marco Polo” and “Truth or Dare.”\n\nThey are cute and fun and very, very loud.\n\nIn some ways, it has been very different. I should expect these things by now, but I don’t. So these are little flashes of joy and reminders of God’s love when I see them:\n\nThe kids all take off their shoes and leave them at the door – without even thinking about it. Because that is what you do in Cambodia.\n\nYou have your party in the late morning while it is sunny, because the monsoon season rains usually start for the day by 3:00 p.m.\n\nJello is a special party treat.\n\n8 kids – 8 nationalities – Nepal, China, South Korea, Philippines, Cambodia, Russia, USA, Germany (Doug and I have to ask these things. The kids don’t seem to notice, or care.)\n\nI know we said when we left Austin in January that this year would be life-changing for our children. I know we said they would have blessings from attending an international Christian school. I know we told them that God was calling them to Cambodia too, that they had a reason to be here. I know I believed these things. But there are the things you believe to be true, and the things you really come to know. I think my beliefs about how this would impact my children were mostly academic – they’ll learn about poverty, they’ll see how people in a developing country live, maybe they’ll learn to appreciate what they have, maybe they’ll be kinder, more open-minded people when they grow up.\n\nI didn’t know, but should have known, that they would so quickly learn to love and embrace other people. I have loved the people in this country from my desk. My kids love them in school busses and swimming pools, volleyball courts and Octa-ball pits. Naeda loved the people of Cambodia today playing games on the floor of her bedroom. And she doesn’t just love the people of Cambodia, she loves people from all over the world. She does it with laughter, and American pop music, a precious bag of Doritos, and sharing her lucky find of a box of Jello.\n\nDoug just reminded me of that very popular song (“from the 1900s,” Naeda would say), “We Are the World.” Remember that? Doug and I sang it in high school. Our kids are living it. Congratulations on finishing 8th grade, Naeda. You are teaching us all.\n\n- Thais\n\nIJM-Cambodia Featured in \"Christianity Today\"\n\nThe headline tells the story: \"Cambodia’s Child Sex Industry Is Dwindling— And They Have Christians to Thank.\" IJM has been on the ground in Cambodia since 2003, working to protect the poor and the vulnerable from violence. Prior to 2016, the focus of the work in our office was combating child sex trafficking. The cover story in the June 2017 issue of Christianity Today does a nice job of telling a most remarkable story of transformation. The most significant change has been within the public justice system itself, which now routinely investigates and prosecutes these cases. That is one of IJM's primary goals: system transformation. The hope is to reform the way the criminal justice system works, and for IJM to literally work itself out of a job. That happens through a blend of rescuing victims, prosecuting criminals, restoring survivors, engaging the community, and building up the capacity of the police, prosecutors, and judges. With God's help, there has been miraculous success. The prevalence of child sex trafficking has plummeted.\n\nBecause of the tremendous progress on this issue, IJM transitioned its work in Cambodia to the problem of labor trafficking just over a year ago. The article briefly mentions our new project, but it mostly celebrates the work that has already been done. It is a great success story, and I hope you will take the time to read it. (And hey -- that's my boss in the picture! What a great privilege to work with a true hero every day!)\n\n- Doug\n\nFinding Joy (and Justice!) in the Trials\n\nIt’s an exciting Spring at IJM-Cambodia. We’ve had two trials in the last three weeks, and we have another this coming Friday. And we are celebrating some great news! IJM-Cambodia got its first labor trafficking convictions this week, shutting down a network of three recruiters/traffickers and putting them away for 8-9 years each. Here is a glimpse into this wonderful and wacky season.\n\nFirst, it will not surprise you that Thais is soaring in her work here. In addition to her work on grant applications, reports for IJM headquarters, and talking points for speaking engagements, she has played a central role in strategic planning for our office. It has been fun to watch her shine in her work. I have never met anyone with her gift for hearing a scattered conversation of disparate ideas, and somehow molding and distilling all of the noise and chaos into order and structure. She is phenomenal, and she gets lots of well-deserved props.\n\nOne cannot work at IJM without knowing that Isaiah 1:17 teaches us to “seek justice.” That’s what we do here. A courtroom trial is one of the key places where lawyers can help make that happen.\n\nSo, how does a random American lawyer show up here and support this work? During trial, it’s necessarily limited. I am not licensed to practice law here, and I do not speak Khmer. I receive real-time translation in the courtroom, and I am able to communicate with our lawyers using written notes. The actual courtroom advocacy is done by our licensed Cambodian lawyers. (And they are terrific.) The vast majority of my contributions are prior to trial – in legal writing and advocacy, case analysis and organization, and helping to prepare clients and witnesses for interviews and cross-examination at trial. It has been the greatest honor of my career to work alongside these real-life heroes at IJM-Cambodia, and I am grateful for the way they have included me and allowed me to be a part of their work.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of this job has been the privilege of getting to know and work with our clients. They are true survivors, and it has been gratifying to spend time with them, learn their stories, help them understand their legal rights and the trial process, prepare them for trial, and reassure and encourage them as they courageously stand up for their rights. Such a blessing to be in this place, and with these brave people. I have now met and shared meals with victims/survivors in four different provinces all over Cambodia.\n\nIt has also been great to travel with colleagues from work, who have taught and shown me so many things about Cambodia. There is no better way to learn about a country than to travel around it with local people who truly know it.\n\nNow for what you really care about – how’s the family? We are doing well! We recently asked everyone for a self-evaluation – a rating on a 1-10 scale about how each person was feeling about being here. We were pleasantly surprised (and more than a bit proud) with the returns. All responses were 6 or higher, with a couple in the lofty 8-9 range. This crowd has adapted well. All of us are stronger than we thought, and I think we have gracefully migrated out of the most difficult transition phase.\n\nWe just returned from a short and lovely break over Mother’s Day weekend. You may not have noticed, but that was also the King’s birthday in Cambodia. We took advantage of the long weekend by taking the nine-dollar bus ride down to the coast. [Note/reminder -- none of your donations to support our work this year are being used for our \"excursions.\" Side trips are at our sole expense.] We stayed in Kep (pronounced “Gipe,” with a hard “G”), a beautiful small town with spectacular views overlooking the Gulf of Thailand. We took a longboat trip to Rabbit Island, where we enjoyed a day at the beach. The next day we toured an organic kampot pepper farm. We also relaxed, slept late, and played at the pool. It was a wonderful getaway.\n\nAnd now we’re back at it, and on to the next battle! Thank you for your prayers – for us and for the work of IJM. We appreciate you all!\n\n- Doug\n\n\"Seriously, Doug is a Man,\" and Other Observations\n\nOK, this is not a deep or thoughtful post, just a collection to reach out and say hello from Phnom Penh, and give you an update on what is going on.\n\n1) We miss you! We are doing well. We really are. But we miss you! (And our dog!)\n\n2) \"Seriously, Doug is a Man.\" This may not come as a surprise to many of you. Especially those of you who know Doug – my 6’4” husband of nearly 24 years and the father of my children. He is, in fact, a man. But I laughed out loud when this came as the caption on a picture taken by a friend at work and sent out to our entire staff in our new country where the typical person, male or female, is about my size – a respectable 5’1”! Doug got this fame by (gasp!) hanging a clock in our office without a step stool! Our boss, who is a New Zealander also over 6 feet tall, delighted in telling Doug that his manliness had now been affirmed.\n\n3) We are having lots of good family time, which was one of my biggest hopes for this year. We have developed traditions of family movie nights on Fridays, and chocolate chip pancakes on Sunday nights. We have played more games in 3 months than we would have played all year at home. We go to the pool all the time (since it is never cold here!), we laugh a lot, we fuss about who left the “air-con” on, and we delight in a school that doesn’t believe in homework.\n\n4) Naeda is crazy good at volleyball (a sport she only picked up 2 months ago), independently bops around Phnom Penh in tuk tuks with her peers from any number of Asian and European countries, has watched (and re-watched) all the Glee and Downton Abbey episodes, loves talking to friends on multiple continents through the joys of wifi, and has developed her dad’s knack for comic timing and sarcasm. So much fun to have around!\n\n5) Lincoln is growing up. He is reading everything he can get his hands on through his Kindle – Neil deGrasse Tyson books on space, how to invest your money, C.S. Lewis, Minecraft, science fiction, Mike Lupica sports fiction, Peanuts cartoons, you name it. He loves to teach, loves to laugh, loves to play video games, and still listens to all sermons with rapt attention.\n\n6) David, who just celebrated his ninth birthday, is both rough and tumble and sensitive at the same time. He loves his bunny stuffed animals, his brother and sister, and his Hershey chocolate. He also is carrying some serious (but temporary) scrapes on his face from direct impact with concrete after outrunning a scooter in a race. He won’t let us leave the house without a hug, he insists that the (American style) hamburger at Carl’s Jr. a few blocks away is “the best hamburger I’ve ever eaten” and he delights when he hears from his friends. Best of all is wrestling with his big brother.\n\n7) Doug, well Doug is a rock star. If you could see him, you would know that THIS is what God made him for. He sits now and frosts the birthday cake he made for David (we are a few weeks behind because it is hard to find some of the ingredients here!), he has just washed his 4th load of dishes after cooking us some fried chicken, and he has all this energy – because this week he got to prep some slavery survivors for trial. Just imagine. A trial skill honed by death row inmate cases and billion dollar industries, and he gets to use it for God’s justice right here on the other side of the world we call home. He gets to look these men in the eye who suffered untold abuse and tell them how brave they are and how they are changing their country. What a gift he has been given; what a gift he gives.\n\n8) Let’s see. Me. I’m the more complicated case, I suppose. I love my work! I love my colleagues, I love the people all around me each day. By 9:00 a.m. each morning, I get to share love and friendship with at least 30 people I never even dreamed existed last year – the guards at our apartment, the woman who sells cabbage sandwiches up the street, the guard at the corner store who tousles David’s hair every morning, the guy who washes the black SUV by the bus stop each morning, our tuk tuk drivers (“Good morning, oun pro!”), the young family who sit and sell drinks by our office and check their watches to see if we’ve made it on time, their 2-year-old who “high fives” us, the guard who lets us into work…. It doesn’t end! And then I go to work and I research how many millions of people don’t get to go to school at all, how many millions live on less than $3/day, how many have to leave their homes and risk their lives because they can’t provide for their families. But at least I can get those numbers out there. I try to track cases and help write plans to support change in the justice system. It feels like such a privilege to contribute.\n\nAnd then there are the times I just miss you guys, and I miss the conveniences of home. Or grass. I miss green space. And it all rolls together. God’s justice, God’s plan, God’s timing, God’s world. I am closer to God than I have ever been, and in some ways more alone. It’s a time for growth.\n\nOne time when Lincoln was about 2 or 3 years old and Naeda was struggling with her adoption, and Lincoln was struggling with not being adopted, Lincoln looked at Doug and said, “Well, I guess you just have to … be the person you get!”\n\nGod has given us this life right now. This is who we get to be – and we are humbled and grateful. This is one of the hardest, and best, things we have ever done. Know we love you and miss you. Thank you for being on the journey with us.\n\nLove,\n\n- Thais\n\nAn Easter Like No Other\n\nNever did we imagine a year when ancient Hindu and Buddhist temples and a southeast Asian New Year celebration would threaten to crowd out our family's Easter celebration. But 2017 has been a year filled with surprises.\n\nKhmer New Year is the king of all holidays in Cambodia. The official celebration lasts for three days but unofficially starts well before then. School gets out for two weeks. Children play games unique to this season, and traditional Khmer dances can be seen at many public gathering places. The capital city becomes a ghost town, as the locals head to the provinces for large family gatherings. We did not want to be left out of the fun, so we brought a family gathering of our own (thanks to Thais' parents, who hopped a rather large pond to be here). Our traveling party of seven made its way to Siem Reap, the Times Square for Cambodia's Khmer New Year celebration.\n\nSiem Reap is a quaint and lovely tourist town of 230,000 people. It is famous for its proximity to the ancient temples of the Angkor empire, including Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Ta Prohm, and dozens of others. More than a million tourists descend upon this area to celebrate Khmer New Year, with the temples serving as the main draw.\n\nWe quickly learned about the coolest of all traditions -- blasting random strangers with water cannons in the streets. (This is a practice that we simply must adopt in the U.S. -- perhaps for a sweltering Summer holiday of our own, like July 4. Regardless, let's do this.) Whether riding a tuk tuk or walking down the street, we were a target. We got very wet. On occasion, the water was accompanied by talcum powder, making a nice gooey, pasty mess. The boys decided to take up the fight for our family. They were quickly soaked head to toe, and they absolutely loved it. A good time was had by all.\n\nThe next discovery was the Siem Reap foot pedicure, using fish to exfoliate your feet. To call this a unique experience is a vast understatement. It tickles, and it's pretty strange. But it ranks high on the list of best ways to spend two bucks.\n\nThe temples absolutely lived up to their billing. The Angkor Empire dominated this part of the world from the 9th-15th centuries. During its peak (11th-13th centuries), the capital city of Angkor (just north of modern-day Siem Reap) was the largest pre-industrial urban center in the world. The temples are their crowning achievements, reflecting the advanced architectural technique, wealth, and power of the Angkor Empire. Most temples in this area were originally built as Hindu temples, and then transitioned to Buddhist temples as Theravada Buddhism became the primary religion in the area. Symbolism from both religions can be found throughout many of these ancient temples.\n\nThe hardest part of our trip was celebrating Easter without our community around us. We researched where to worship and celebrate Easter in Siem Reap. There were only 3-4 options. Christian churches can be found somewhat easily in the capital city of Phnom Pehn, where many expats live and work. But beyond Phnom Penh, the statistics on religious preference start to take on greater significance. Cambodia is 90-95% Buddhist, and Christians comprise fewer than 1/2 of 1% of the country. Finding a place to celebrate Easter turned out to be a tremendous challenge. We settled on a small church with services at 4:00 pm, and we planned accordingly. Unfortunately, when we got dressed and tried to find transportation, we were told that there would be no way to get there in the midst of peak Khmer New Year traffic.\n\nThis was the first time in my 49 years that I have not been in church on an Easter Sunday. Since we skipped church (despite best efforts), I'll share my 2017 Easter story.\n\nAt IJM we begin our work day with a time of \"stillness\" -- a half-hour of prayer, reading, journaling, and preparation for the day's work. One of the things I have done during this time is to read through the Book of Isaiah. Why Isaiah? Because Isaiah 1:17 is an IJM favorite: \"Seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.\" That verse appears in our conference room at the office, and it can be found on IJM t-shirts, bookmarks, and other paraphernalia. \"Seek justice.\" It's why we're here. On my first day in the office, I decided to read Isaiah 1 in full, just to get the full context. I've been reading one Isaiah chapter each work day since we arrived. It has been uncanny how many times my reading in Isaiah has directly lined up with my work. You might call it a coincidence. But there have been too many. And I don't believe in coincidences when it comes to God and working at IJM.\n\nThis week, well aware that I would be out of the office, I read ahead in Isaiah. I was again struck by another uncanny \"coincidence.\" Good Friday would have been my 53rd work day at IJM. Here is what I found for Good Friday, in Isaiah 53:\n\nI can't really improve on that, so I'll just say this. Amen, and thanks be to God!\n\nI hope all of you had a wonderful Easter, and a Happy Khmer New Year. Thank you for following along with us on our journey this year.\n\n- Doug"
