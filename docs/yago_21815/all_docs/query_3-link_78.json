        "text": "A utopian agrarian society\n\nImmediately after seizing control of Phnom Penh, the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), supported by Khmer Rouge soldiers, sent city dwellers into the countryside. Religion was completely repressed; Buddhist monks were murdered, temples and monasteries were ransacked and destroyed.\n\nAll traces of capitalism were abolished. Hospitals, schools, factories, shops, market places  shut down. Entire communities were relocated to hastily erected rural villages. Food, medical aid, farming tools and basic facilities were non-existent. Thousands died through exhaustion, disease and starvation.\n\nAll who opposed the CPK and Khmer Rouge were executed. Former business people, bureaucrats and teachers were sought out and killed, along with their families. Anyone with knowledge of a foreign language, anyone wearing glasses, anyone scrapping around for food or crying for loved ones.\n\nAllegiances with North Vietnam quickly dried up and rebel socialist Cambodians living on the Vietnamese border were exterminated in one of the most horrific episodes of the campaign. Ethnic Vietnamese and Chinese were also hunted down and killed.\n\nThe best time to visit depends on whether you head to Phnom Penh, Siem Reap or the coast.\n\nWe've packed so much into our Cambodia travel guide that it's bursting at the Siem Reaps. Read on to find out more.\n\nA map, sample itineraries and driving times to help you choose where to head to first.\n\nOur guide includes a brief history, how to get there, the best time to visit and even how to pronounce its name.\n\nFood in Cambodia is a revelation: fish, curry, pork, and some of the most divine spicy pastes.\n\nTraveling in Cambodia with kids is a lot more straightforward than you might think, with loads of activities for families.\n\nGrab the chance to compare landscapes, the food and the cultural heritage.\n\nUrban and rural life, ancient temples shrouded in jungle, and overflowing market stalls.\n\nThere are plenty of things to do in Cambodia  it's not all about Angkor Wat.\n\nTips on planning, Phnom Penh, and how to find what might just be the best coffee in the world  all from our experts.\n\nOur responsible tourism in Cambodia page is a worthwhile read."
