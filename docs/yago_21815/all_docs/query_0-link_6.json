Princess Norodom Vacheara, who thought these matters should not be part of the public debate, dismissed the outcry with the remark: ​“Who does not have a mistress?”. The King-Father liked this bon mot so much that he instructed his then-secretary, Prince Sisowath Thomico, to broach a script on the theme of mistresses. Ten years later, when the film was released, Prince Thomico reportedly commented: ““The purpose of the movie is to say that every Cambodian has a mistress…no fuss should be made about having a mistress in Cambodia, that is a very natural thing.” Note that another princess, Princess Sisowath Kalyan Devi, played the main female character.\n\nMain photo: Poster for Norodom Sihanouk, Roi Cinéaste (1997).\n\nNote 1: Many of Norodom Sihanouk’s films are now available online thanks to Khemara Pictures, the production company set by the King Father and later headed by then Prince Norodom Sihamoni in the 1980s, to the Mietophoum Khmer Spirit Center and to Monash University Repository Department, Melbourne, Australia.\n\nNote 2: The Cambodia Film Commission (CFC) is currently (2023) developing a Cambodia Film Database in collaboration with Bophana Audiovisual Resources Center, ARPAA and AFD.\n\nAngkor Database — មូលដ្ឋានទិន្នន័យអង្គរ — 吴哥数据库\n\nAll you want to know about Angkor and the Ancient Khmer civilization, how it keeps attracting worldwide attention and permeates modern Cambodia.\n\nIndexed and reviewed books, online documentation, photo and film collections, enriched authors’ biographies, searchable publications.\n\nជាអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងដែលអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នាចង់ដឹងអំពីអង្គរ, អរិយធម៌ខ្មែរពីបុរាណ, និងមូលហេតុអ្វីដែលធ្វើឲ្យមានការទាក់ទាញចាប់អារម្មណ៍ពីទូទាំងពិភពលោកបូករួមទាំងប្រទេសកម្ពុជានាសម័យឥឡូវនេះផងដែរ។\n\nOur resources include the on-site Library atTemplation Angkor Resort, Siem Reap, Cambodia, with exclusive access for the resort’s guests.
