        "text": "When Canadian diplomat Carl Pimmler sends his friend Peter Kernan and his wife Johanna deep into the jungles of Cambodia to deliver a truck load of medicine, he fails to tell him about true nature of his business. Peter must use his experience and knowledge of South East Asia to get them out of this dangerous mess.\n\nWhen an American plane crashes in the Cambodian jungle, the pilot is taken captive by the Khmer Rouge. They instruct the kids of a village to keep an eye on the prisoner. While the younger kids gradually become friends with the stranger, the older boy called Pang has a different attitude. Since he grew up without parents, he accepted the Khmer rouge as his replacement parents and endears himself to them by betraying villagers. When Pang becomes responsible for watching the prisoner, things become worse for the pilot.\n\nSet in 1993 when UN forces come to Cambodia during a time of political upheaval and civil war, this story of jealousy, courage, and betrayal, a classic love triangle with a twist - two Resistance leaders fall in love with the same girl -- becomes one of wider significance, a story of a country and its innocent people caught up in war, their lives disrupted and their love destroyed\n\nKhmer Rouge terrorist Kieron Chow and his unit arrive in Hong Kong for their latest mission. Todd, Chow's son and fiercely loyal right-hand man, sustains a serious head wound. Now a total amnesiac, Todd wakes from a coma to find he's been given a new life, one that may be the death of him. With the help of psychiatrist Shirley Kwan, anti-terrorist officer Mark Chan tries to convince Todd that he is actually an undercover cop sent to infiltrate Chow's group. As fragments of his shattered memory return, Todd is forced to choose between his dark past and this one shot at redemption...\n\nAfter the fall of Saigon, a stranded group of US soldiers tries to make it through Cambodia to safety in Thailand. While taking refuge in an ancient abandoned temple, the men find a gold statue worth millions of dollars. They agree to hide the statue, then return to Cambodia when it is safe to do so and split the treasure. After hiding the statue, however, the lieutenant, overcome by greed, shoots his own men in order to keep it all for himself. Eight years later, the lieutenant, now a major, returns to retrieve the statue. Everything is going well until he hears about one of the soldiers he thought he killed now living as a farmer in a small Thai village. Fearing his secret will be revealed, the lieutenant must now decide how to deal with this ghost from his past.\n\nNEARI is a young nurse at Siem Reap-Angkor provincial hospital. She recalls a recent memory: She remembers the arrival of SEIHA, a young doctor came back from France. The team of the surgery service takes care of the patients who are seriously injured by land mines, as the country was full of mines. SEIHA and NEARI decided to marry, but one day SEIHA will be obliged to follow the de-mining team. What is going to happen to them?"
