to the Stone Age and I mean\n\nStone Age in its literal sense.\n\n00:01:42.064 --> 00:01:45.798\n\nShortly after dawn on\n\nApril 17th the bombing\n\n00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.728\n\nstopped and there

with\n\na long boulevards and the still traffic\n\n00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:15.589\n\nThey were black and when mostly teenagers\n\nand people cheered them nervously naively.\n\n00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.758\n\nAfter all the bombing the fighting.\n\n00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:25.383\n\nWas over at last a horror\n\nbegan almost immediately.\n\n00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:31.623\n\nNone pen a city of

Cambodia.\n\n00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:42.363\n\nBut for a domestic affair called Watergate\n\nKissinger received the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n00:07:42.364 --> 00:07:49.654\n\nOut of the inferno of bonds came called Part\n\na form of Buddhist monk and the Khmer Rouge.\n\n00:07:49.655 --> 00:07:55.009\n\nWhose revolution had never enjoyed a popular\n\nbase until Nixon\\'s Madman Theory of\n\n00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:03.010\n\nwar the bombing upset\n\n00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:07.579\n\nthe delicate balance of royalists\n\nRepublicans and communists.\n\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.488\n\nIt triggered a war that caused\n\nat least a million dead and\n\n00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:13.339\n\nwounded and tore apart the very fabric of\n\n00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:19.478\n\nCambodia When I

foreigner\n\nto romanticize such a place but to\n\n00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:33.999\n\nfly across the Mekong River from\n\nbeleaguered and neurotic Saigon was to\n\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.749\n\nreaffirm the belief that if only\n\nforeign armies would leave alone\n\n00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:43.839\n\nthese people they would assert their own\n\ncivilization and measure their own prosperity.\n\n00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.524\n\nCertainly there was feudalism and corruption\n\nbut there was no war. No Slaughter.\n\n00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:56.049\n\nNo napalm and the Cambodian family was\n\na fortress without warrant and now.\n\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:02.868\n\nNow this delicious city is a smoldering\n\nwreck of that vision Gangs are scavengers.\n\n00:09:02.869 --> 00:09:07.384\n\nMostly children forage in\n\nthe empty houses offices.\n\n00:09:07.385 --> 00:09:15.289\n\nSchools cinemas parks museums in\n\nall but a few places there is\n\n00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.258\n\nno electricity and no sewerage\n\n00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:23.794\n\nthe water supplies polluted by the bodies\n\nof countless murdered and tortured.\n\n00:09:23.795 --> 00:09:30.539\n\nMen women and children and the\n\nDjango has reclaimed their homes.\n\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.649\n\nThis was the National Library.\n\n00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:42.844\n\nAlmost as a symbol the Khmer Rouge converted\n\nit into a pig sty and burned it\\'s books\n\n00:09:42.845 --> 00:09:50.310\n\nAnd archives from year 0 all\n\npast knowledge was illegal\n\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.794\n\nand here is one of the more\n\ngrotesque ironies of at all\n\n00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:11.314\n\nthe Khmer Rouge banned all forms\n\nof money and yet they had printed.\n\n00:10:11.315 --> 00:10:14.149\n\nMillions of these brand new banknotes.\n\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.064\n\nAnd just before the Vietnamese\n\ndrove into the city last year\n\n00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:24.019\n\nthe Khmer Rouge blew up the National\n\nBank and the monsoon rains carried\n\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.788\n\nall this money Through the\n\ncity and today a city that\n\n00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:34.919\n\nhas nothing was literally running\n\nwith money all of it worthless\n\n00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:59.839\n\nObama as representative of unicef you\n\nhave seen the situation here in Cambodia.\n\n00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.959\n\nHow many people are threatened Famine by\n\n00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.618\n\nstarvation do you think the\n\ngovernment has requested help\n\n00:11:06.619 --> 00:11:14.619\n\nfor 2,000,250 thousand people who\n\nare threatened by famine yes.\n\n00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:21.259\n\nBy hunger. This is the dimension of the\n\nproblem let me tell you something on\n\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:28.609\n\nthe 18th of July I did go to compounds\n\nper and I visited the hospitals\n\n00:11:28.610 -->

with swollen legs\n\n00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.988\n\nbecause he was starving he did not have\n\n00:11:53.989 --> 00:12:01.989\n\nthe strength to look at me up to\n\nanybody it was just waiting to die.\n\n00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.628\n\nTen days later.\n\n00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:11.673\n\nFour of these children were dead\n\nand I will always remember that.\n\n00:12:11.674 --> 00:12:19.674\n\nSaying I did not do anything for these\n\nchildren because we had nothing\n\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.069\n\nAt the beginning of July\n\n00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.209\n\nthe Cambodian

think it\\'s\n\n00:31:03.259 --> 00:31:05.809\n\na terrible problem because\n\nthis population has been\n\n00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:10.323\n\nsubmitted during four years to a regime of\n\n00:31:10.324 --> 00:31:18.049\n\nvery poor nutrition and very hard\n\nwork and the results are here\n\n00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:23.598\n\nthe psychological conditions were terrible\n\nislands from the families were systematically\n\n00:31:23.599 --> 00:31:29.283\n\nseparated There was no\n\npossibility of any else.\n\n00:31:29.284 --> 00:31:32.523\n\nWhat\\'s wrong with the Civil War.\n\n00:31:32.524 -->

12-year-old is 12 wondering.\n\n00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.199\n\nThis little boy is literally\n\nskin and bone height\n\n00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:59.314\n\nnow what can you do to save him.\n\nCan you save him.\n\n00:31:59.315 --> 00:32:03.979\n\nYes it\\'s possible but\n\nalso probably this boy at\n\n00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:09.079\n\nthe some other disease and\n\nit\\'s We had to deform\n\n00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:15.109\n\nexamination with a laboratory and\n\nx-ray examination in order to\n\n00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:18.439\n\nprecisely these other diseases but\n\n00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.354\n\nall the modern equipment in this hospital\n\nwas destroyed by the Khmer Rouge.\n\n00:32:22.355 --> 00:32:29.119\n\nWho banned all forms of modern medicine and\n\nrazed to the ground 30

they are not allowing aid to come through\n\nthe Cambodia yes is eating the same way\n\n00:34:14.345 --> 00:34:18.798\n\nThere\\'s a cutoff of expeditions of milk to\n\n00:34:18.799 -->
