        "text": "I've been home for more than a month, but I've been out of town on short trips for half of that time. I'm just getting around to posting the trip report that I kept as my husband and I traveled to Southeast Asia. It included a Viking Mekong River cruise sandwiched between travel that we completed on our own. I posted on cruise critic while I was on the trip (that posting included photos - so if you want to see any photos, you can still find it there under \"River Cruising.\" It was a great trip.\n\nWednesday, February 7 ‚Äì Bangkok\n\nWe‚Äôve started on our Viking Mekong adventure. We have already arrived in Bangkok for our pre cruise extension, starting in two days. We always like to come early to get over jet lag. Since we arrived in Bangkok near midnight, we were ready to go to bed immediately. I think that has really helped with the jet lag since I feel great today. I did take one melatonin before going to sleep so I think that helped me to sleep soundly until the alarm rang this morning. Our flights over (Seattle to Inchon and Inchon to Bangkok) were both delayed, but they build so much time into flight schedules these days, that we still arrived on time or early on both flights. The service on the first flight, a Delta flight, was satisfactory, but even in Delta One, the attendants seem to want to feed you and be done. The service on the Prestige class Korean Air flight was much more attentive. We were thanked for flying them multiple times. Both flights included lie flat seats which as much appreciated, especially on the second fight where I slept soundly for 3 hours after dinner. And the dinner on the Korean Air flight was better, too. The bibimbap was sooooo good!\n\nWe are staying at the Millenium Hilton Bangkok for the first three nights until we move to the Peninsula for our Viking arranged room. We usually stay at Hilton properties in major cities since we are Diamond members and usually end up with upgrades. And yes, Hilton upgraded us to an Executive room. We have a lovely view of the Chao Phraya River and a nice, deep soaker tub. When we arrived at the airport last night, we collected our bags and I called a Grab Car - very quick. And since it was after midnight, there was very little traffic and we had a relatively quick ride to the hotel.\n\nThis morning, we had a late breakfast in the Executive Lounge, then took a walk to check out where the Peninsula Hotel is, then stopped at the Iconsiam Shopping Center. It is filled with high-end stores and scads of restaurants. There is even\n\nPorsche and Maserati ‚Äústores‚Äù - yes, there are cars on display. We also took some time to stroll along the riverfront.\n\nSince today is officially our get over jet lag day, we had no sightseeing planned. When we arrived back at the hotel, we went to afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge and will go there for cocktails this evening. Then it is early to bed for us since we have an all-day tour to the River Kwai tomorrow to visit the Kanchanaburi War Museum and Hell Fire Pass."
