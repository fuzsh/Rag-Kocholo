        "text": "Transcripts of two conversations Mao Zedong had with Cambodian leaders from 1974 and 1975 when he met Pol Pot in Beijing. They were made available by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\nApril 2nd 1974, Conversation of Mao Zedong with Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary, and Prince Sihanouk. They discuss the civil war in Cambodia, the leading political figures in that country, and China’s revolutionary experience.\n\nSource: Song Yongyi, ed., ‘Jimi Dangan zhong Xin Faxian de Mao Zedong Jianghua’ (Talks with Mao Zedong Newly Discovered in Secret Archives) (Guoshi chubanshe, 2018). Translated by Caixia Lu.\n\nConversation with Khieu Samphan and Ieng Sary, Head and Deputy Head of the Delegation of the National United Front and the Royal Government of the National Union of Cambodia\n\nKhieu: We have all the conditions for engaging in protracted war. The people are mentally prepared for this. Economic conditions are also in preparation, and we are self-sufficient in provisions and clothing. The current domestic situation indicates that it is possible for us to achieve victory within a shorter period of time.\n\nChairman: It’s better to keep it longer, make it a long-term fight. If it’s a victory won in short term, that’s also good.\n\nKhieu: Right.\n\nChairman: For how many years have you been fighting?\n\nPrince Sihanouk [henceforth referred to as Sihanouk]: Four years and a month. We started fighting in March 1970.\n\nChairman: Prepare (to fight) for another six years, and make it ten years in total. That’s the idea. But it’s also good if you only need four or three years to solve the problem.\n\nSihanouk: Quite right.\n\nChairman: We fought for 22 years and made many mistakes. Who is Comrade Ieng Sary? What’s your view on this?\n\nIeng Sary [henceforth referred to as Ieng]: I completely agree with Chairman Mao’s view, and I am prepared for a prolonged struggle. (But) as Deputy Prime Minister Khieu Samphan have said, conditions are now ripe for a swifter victory.\n\nChairman: The two princes, do you wish to overthrow them or join forces with them? [Everyone laughs]\n\nKhieu: We are unanimous in our views, and there is no reason to overthrow them.\n\nSihanouk: His Excellency the Chairman is referring to the future. [Everyone laughs]\n\nKhieu: The purpose of uniting is to join forces to bring down imperialism and to restore a neutral and independent Cambodia in the future.\n\nChairman: Ah.\n\nIeng: The Cambodian revolution, which took place with the aid of China and (North) Vietnam, has its own special characteristics. Our revolution includes people from all the social classes. In other words, we do not exclude any stratum of society. We have every reason to unite everyone, and there is no reason to alienate people of any particular stratum.\n\nChairman: You have to exclude the Lon Nol clique and get united with the two princes. I agree with your guideline. You two princes, you should not attack them either [referring to Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan]. [Everyone laughs]\n\nSihanouk: With the liberation of Cambodia, I plan to completely withdraw myself from political life. I have openly said so many times in the past.\n\nIeng: We think that Prince Sihanouk is a great patriot. He stood the test and he participated in the struggle to save the country. This is not just my personal view but also the view within our country (referring to the Khmer Rouge leadership in Cambodia). We think that the form of government in Cambodia is not important. What is important is the substance, which is that we must have real democracy. I had raised this point with the Head of State and the Prime Minister many times. Recently, the leaders within our country have also concurred with this view of mine.\n\nChairman: What are the names of the leaders in your country?\n\nIeng: Hou Yuon and Hu Nim.\n\nSihanouk: And Son Sen. He is the Chief of Staff.\n\nChairman: I am talking about the Communist Party.\n\nSihanouk: They are all from the Communist Party.\n\nPremier (Zhou Enlai): The Chairman is referring to the top leaders.\n\nChairman: I’ve not seen them.\n\nSihanouk: And also Prince Phurissara. We are a united front, and there are no party factions within. The Cambodian communists have their own special characteristics. They have never established a party and have only announced a political principle supporting the united front.\n\nIeng: The National Military Committee directs our domestic military operations.\n\nSihanouk: There are Saloth Sar (Pol Pot), Nuon Chea and Son Sen.\n\nIeng: We established a military committee led by collective leadership. Khieu Samphan presides over this committee. It is led by Son Sen, now that he (Khieu) is having overseas visits.\n\nChairman: Don’t mutter and mumble. Just be straightforward. The two of them [referring to Khieu Samphan and Ieng Sary] represent the Communist Party. The two of them [referring to Sihanouk and Penn Nouth] represent another party. The two parties are joining forces to overthrow Lon Nol’s counter-revolutionary party. It’s better not to mutter and mumble. Speak the truth. The leaders of the united front are the two of them [referring to the two princes] and him [referring to Ieng Sary). [To Khieu Samphan] I think that you look like a Communist too. [Everyone laughs]. Don’t keep the two princes in the dark.\n\nPremier: The two princes know that you are from the Communist Party, yet they are willing to be friends with China.\n\nSihanouk: After the war ends and the country is liberated, there will be no quarrel between us. Prince Penn Nouth and I have been genuinely and sincerely helping the Cambodian Communists to consolidate the outcome of the people’s revolution. Political power within the country are now handed over to the people. I have handed over the government, the administration, the military and the police. We have already implemented the changes. After the end of the war, even if I wanted to bring down the Cambodian Communists, it would be impossible to do so, because the military and government are no longer in my hands. I have nothing. Lon Nol was able to overthrow me because I relinquished control of the military, and of course the police too. Chairman Kim Il-Sung told me that had the military been under my control, Lon Nol would not have been able to launch a coup. Whoever controls the military has the political power. I am now fighting together with the Cambodian Communists for a common cause. I have no ambition regarding the future. I think that power ought to belong to them in the future. They are the young people and should rightfully be in power. Some people ask, where are the Sihanoukists in the united front? ; originally there was a good number of them, but now their representation in the united front is too small, and it’s out of balance; the Communists are in command of everything. I replied that those who were formerly Sihanoukists have now gone to support Lon Nol and Nixon, and they are no longer with me. Hence it is completely normal for the Communists to be in power in an independent Cambodia in the future which rejects any foreign rule.\n\nChairman: This is good.\n\nSihanouk: Thank you Chairman. The Cambodian Communists have been very good to me as well. They said that there was no need to change the form of government, but to rename it the Republic of Cambodia. (But) Cambodia has its own special characteristics, and it should retain the name of a kingdom. What is important is not the form but the substance. Your Excellency had already pointed out in 1970 that the People’s Republic of China is a communist country, but it supports The Kingdom of Cambodia. What has decisive significance is the substance. China neither supports Nguyen Van Thieu’s Republic of Vietnam nor Park Chung-hee’s Republic of Korea. The Cambodian Kingdom is revolutionary. The political power lies not in the hands of a prince like myself but in the hands of the people. We put real democracy into practice. We struggle against imperialism and all evil forces. The Cambodian Communists are in complete agreement with Chairman Mao’s views and have agreed to preserve the two-thousand-year-old orthodox form of the kingdom, and to keep the flag and the national anthem of the kingdom. In reality Cambodia has already entered a revolutionary era. I am simply the Head of State and I do not hold political power. I completely agree that the people should hold power. That is to say, the people’s representatives, Khieu Samphan and his team, should hold political power. I have formally stated my position, and believe that they should be in power. There will be no domestic upheaval in the future, and I will not quarrel with them over this.\n\nChairman: Quarrels are inevitable but do not be divided. Have small quarrels but big unity. [Everyone laughs]\n\nSihanouk: I totally agree with the Chairman’s view. The sort of quarrel I was talking about is a serious situation like being on the brink of a civil war.\n\nChairman: It’s not like that.\n\nSihanouk: With the end of the war, the task of rebuilding Cambodia will be arduous. We should try to avoid ceaseless quarrels as much as possible. The issue of the form of government has been completely resolved and the Cambodian Communists have openly expressed their views. We were historically a kingdom, yet I am okay with the establishment of a republic. However, as I am a prince, I cannot betray my ancestors or let my people down. Hence I agree to retain the kingdom. The form is unimportant. What is important is the substance, and that is to establish the people’s political regime. Now all the problems have been resolved.\n\nChairman: You are indeed generous.\n\nSihanouk: It is not that I’m generous. Rather, it’s the natural outcome of the development of the situation. Various factors have led to this situation. Patriotic forces from all sides have coalesced to bring about the situation as it is today. As Ieng Sary, the Special Envoy, has said, the Cambodian Revolution is unlike any other revolution, and it has its special characteristics.\n\nChairman: We were also quarreling within our party. We’ve had 10 quarrels over 50 years. The most recent one was with Lin Biao. Lin Biao was not as nice as they [referring to the two princes] are. Lin Biao was rotten to the core!\n\nYour cause will succeed, but I am a little doubtful. For instance, to say that 90% of the land [has been liberated], how can it possibly be so much?\n\nPremier: And 80% of the population, is it really that much?\n\nSihanouk: It’s not from propaganda but objectively speaking. The liberated zones in reality might have 5.5 million people. The areas occupied by Lon Nol, mainly big cities like Phnom Penh and including Battamabang,Kampong Cham—Kampong Cham does not have many people—Sihanoukville and Kampong Thom, etc., have a population of over 2 million.. There are possibly 2 million people if you add them all up. Those in the liberated zones are all producers, while most of Lon Nol’s 2 million people are consumers. Hence President Nixon had no choice but to increase his aid to Lon Nol. The aid will double annually as the war goes on. Both food and financial aid had to be increased. Rice, meat and so on, have to be transported from the United States by air. Thus Lon Nol’s republic is dependent on the American imperialists. The Americans are helping him sustain it.\n\nThe difficulty we face in fighting is that, even though China has often given us plenty of aid, the military equipment is hard to transport. Thus we have no navy, air force or tanks, while Lon Nol has the advantage in this regard. Lon Nol also has heavy artillery. We too have some artillery guns and shells, but they were all captured from the enemy. In addition (the enemy has) the mercenaries. Nixon has organized mercenaries from Thailand, Laos and South Vietnam, and these people all belong to America’s Central Intelligence Agency. Now, our (North) Vietnamese brothers are no longer helping us to fight the war. They want to implement the Paris Peace Accords. Hence we are completely on our own in this war. Only Cambodians are involved in the fight. The Americans say there are (North) Vietnamese too, but we said no. We ask the (North) Vietnamese not to help us fight. We only request that they assist us with transportation.\n\nChairman: Standing on one’s own feet is good.\n\nSihanouk: And that is the real situation.\n\nChairman: We too had no tanks, no navy and no air force in the past. We only had land forces. We fought for 18 years, with Chiang Kai-Shek, and with the Japanese. Later on we fought again after the peace (of World War II). Then we fought the Americans in Korea, but we sent the volunteer army. We fought for 25 years in total.\n\nI read Confucius for six years, capitalism for seven, and (at that time) I had never heard of either Marx or Lenin. I wasn’t as progressive as the two princes [Everyone laughs]. Later on Chiang Kai-Shek started killing people! There were 50 thousand of us and he killed 10 to 20 thousand. The revolution failed. Some people defected to Chiang Kai-Shek and some became too pessimistic to continue. We were left with about 10 thousand people. In the end, we defeated Chiang Kai-Shek, the Japanese and the Americans.\n\nThe October Revolution gave me an education. It was mainly because Chiang Kai-Shek was killing people. I was a primary school teacher, a head of the kids [Everyone laughs]. I had never thought about fighting a war in the mountains! As Chiang Kai-Shek was killing people, it was impossible to stay in the city and we were forced to go up to Mount Liang (a phrase from the Chinese Classic Water Margin, meaning to wage struggles after being driven to desperation). I fought for ten years and accumulated some experience. I was no longer a primary school teacher. The Japanese came and we fought for another eight years. Thereafter we fought Chiang Kai-Shek for another 4 years and then the Americans for another 3 years.\n\nPremier: 25 years (altogether).\n\nChairman: So I am 81 this year, and I have spent more than 20 years fighting. About fighting the wars, you’ll learn it once you start. [Everyone laughs]\n\nSihanouk: Quite right.\n\nChairman: You won’t understand it if you don’t fight.\n\nIeng: In the past we had only read the Chairman’s books and now we are experiencing it for ourselves.\n\nChairman: It’s mainly about the experience, fighting on your own. Thus you have to form a fist, and be able to attack and occupy Phnom Penh, and the big cities. I reckon you’d need about 100 thousand troops, and you have to clench your hand into a fist. Not guerrilla fighters, but regular troops.\n\nKhieu: We have regular troops. We are at a disadvantage compared to the enemy in terms of weaponry. To make up for this weakness, we are simultaneously doing political work of mobilizing the masses on top of our military operations. Now, the movement of the people’s struggle is proceeding smoothly in the city of Phnom Penh.\n\nIeng: We now have three forces—regular forces, local troops and the militia. Our (North) Vietnamese comrades think that our three armed forces have developed very quickly. Currently, our regular force has almost 100 thousand strong.\n\nChairman: Hmm.\n\nKhieu: Our regular forces, local troops and people’s militia add up to about 200 thousand strong.\n\nIeng: The units of organization in our military are mainly battalions and regiments. We do not have any divisions yet, because the issue of command is more complex. Now our (North) Vietnamese comrades are helping us to resolve this problem. Moreover, we already have seven female battalions, with two of them directly engaged in battle in the northwestern battlefield. These female soldiers were very brave. They usually waited for the enemy’s tanks to approach at a distance of 50 meters before launching their bazookas. Sometimes the bazookas don’t work well and the tanks ran them over. Thus, we’ve lost 50 female soldiers in this battle and another six were captured. They (referring the enemy) were propagandizing this and we verified that this was true. But in this battle, we destroyed six enemy tanks because some other battalions acted in concert (with the female battalions) during the fighting and encircled these tanks.\n\nChairman: That’s good. You should build a few corps, and each should have three divisions. Every division should have 15 thousand people. Such an army is a school. I had never been to university, but I am university-educated as well, and for more than 20 years. It is called the university of the greenwood outlaws. [Everyone laughs]\n\nSihanouk: Best university ever since.\n\nChairman: One had to be engaged in military affairs, politics as well as investigation and research, and the issues in the countryside, in the mid-sized and small cities, and land distribution. Have you distributed your land yet?\n\nKhieu: In Cambodia we have taken measures to cancel the high interest rates that burdened our peasants.\n\nChairman: You have to reduce the rent and interest.\n\nKhieu: We do not distribute the land (owned by the landlords), as there was plenty of uncultivated land.\n\nChairman: That (referring to the distribution of all the lands) will be in a few years. If the peasants don’t get their land, their fighting capacity would not be enhanced. If you can’t topple those landlords standing on Lon Nol’s side, the peasants would not be active (in the struggles).\n\nSihanouk: Now there are no longer any landlords in the liberated zones. The people’s regime has distributed the assets of former landlords to the peasants. Of course, as soon as the new regime had been established, the people got rid of a small number of landlords, and the rest fled to Phnom Penh or France. [Everyone laughs] In addition, it was the same case with the industrialists and big capitalists. As for their assets, the peasants had distributed those of the smaller industrialists among themselves, while the state and the people’s regimes managed the assets of the bigger ones .\n\nChairman: Be careful about the capitalists. You should only confiscate the assets of the comprador capitalists. There is no hurry with the national capitalists.\n\nSihanouk: We are not in a hurry to deal with the patriotic capitalists.\n\nKhieu: The national capitalists stand together with us, and so do the rich peasants.\n\nChairman: Not just the rich peasants, you should also unite some of the middle and petty landlords.\n\nKhieu: The patriotic ones. Some landlords are even willing to surrender their land because they had no labour.\n\nIeng: We even adopt a differentiated approach toward the compradors. We are only opposed to those who work for the Americans. We try to win over the other compradors to support our struggle. Hence we could buy medicine and other supplies.\n\nChairman: This is good.\n\nPremier Zhou: I heard that the French rubber plantations were paying taxes to them (referring to the Khmer Rouge).\n\nKhieu: We are now managing the rubber plantations ourselves. Our own workers harvest the rubber, and then we sell it to the French.\n\nIeng: The French pay a low price, only 30 riels for one kilogram. But we had no choice but to sell it to them, because we produce a great deal of rubber and they would turn bad if we don’t. Thus, ships that display white flags are allowed to enter our liberated zones to trade, and some ships bring gasoline when they arrive.\n\nChairman: That’s good, barter trade.\n\nSihanouk: Yes, we trade one good for another.\n\nIeng: But the French fear to do real barter trade. They are afraid of Lon Nol.\n\nKhieu: We sometimes procure some gasoline and other industrial products from them, and try our best to sell the rubber. But the French give us Lon Nol’s currency, and it often depreciates and becomes valueless. Hence, we have a struggle with the French on this issue.\n\nChairman: Oh, get them to pay you in US dollars, DOLLARS [Mao says “dollars” in English]\n\nIeng: The French did so once in the past, but they have stopped doing so because they are afraid of Lon Nol.\n\nChairman [to Ieng]: How long did you stay when you went back this time?\n\nIeng: More than three months. I went to many places, Roads No. 4, No. 5, No. 1. I went to all the former rubber plantations. Now our liberated zones have been interconnected into a single integral area. We are free to come and go within. It is an independent part of territory while imperialism is making its incursions from outside. In the cities the enemies are too being surrounded. Due to our own carelessness in Kampong Thom, we once let the people in this region suffer some losses.\n\nSihanouk: Because the fighting in Phnom Penh drew some of our forces away, so the enemies in Kampong Thom came out. Otherwise, the enemy would only be holed up in the city and very passive.\n\nIeng: We mobilized our regular forces into the Phnom Penh battleground.\n\nKhieu: In Kampong Thom, had our cadres been more alert, they would have been able to protect the people with guerrilla operations and strike the enemies who came to harass us. But due to our negligence, we failed to do so.\n\nChairman: Mistakes are inevitable. It’s impossible to be error-free.\n\nKhieu: The issue is to learn and gain from one’s mistakes. Thereafter, we used the opportunity to mobilize again, and advanced the work of our cadres in various areas.\n\nIeng: It is mainly because Lon Nol had few artillery and munitions, and he seldom shelled the rear of our liberated zones, that our rear became a little like a tranquil region. It is now necessary to push the cadres on.\n\nSihanouk: The enemy sometimes competes with us for the people but this has not benefited them. For instance, on the issue of Kampong Thom, they won over some residents to their side, but this turned the former producers to consumers. Then they had no choice but to ask Nixon for more dollars.\n\nChairman: The one (Sihanouk’s son) who studied in China, his name is Naradipo?\n\nSihanouk: Yes, he is currently still in Phnom Penh.\n\nChairman: Can he get out?\n\nSihanouk: He was sentenced to 5 years of hard labor for participating in the anti-American and anti-Lon Nol struggle. He was released as he became mentally ill after being imprisoned for more than three years. When my mother left Phnom Penh to come to China, Naradipo’s maternal grandmother refused to let him leave. I still have two other children living in the liberated zones with Khieu Samphan. One died of illness after three years, while the other one is still there. Another child is in France. The rest are now all in China with me. Only Naradipo is living under Lon Nol’s rule.\n\nChairman: Alright, let’s not talk further. [To the Premier] You people talk. Talk less, and don’t go into the details of everything. It’ll do to just talk about the outline of the programs.\n\nSihanouk: Your Excellency the Chairman has spent so much time meeting us. We feel deeply honored. The Cambodian people, especially the soldiers and cadres who now are engaged in the struggle, will be greatly encouraged when the news is announced. When Khieu Samphan returns to Cambodia, he will bring back the spirit of this conversation. The cadres and soldiers will be very happy after hearing it.\n\nChairman: That’s for your reference. I still advice you [referring to Sihanouk] to read a little Marx and Lenin.\n\nSihanouk: I occasionally read some excerpts.\n\nChairman: Philosophy, economics and socialism, for instance. I have always hoped that you will make progress. The two of you [referring to the princes] should not learn from China that produced someone like Lin Biao. Lon Nol is Lin Biao. Lon Nol is pro-America while Lin Biao is pro-Soviet.\n\nSihanouk: We are pro-Cambodia.\n\nChairman: That’s the right. The Third World should get united. (We have) so many people!\n\nSihanouk: We will walk this road unwaveringly with the greatest confidence.\n\nChairman: Imperialism fears it!\n\nSihanouk: Quite right.\n\nChairman: That’s all.\n\n========================================\n\nTalk 2\n\nJune 21st 1975, an hour long conversation between Mao Zedong and Cambodian leader Pol Pot. Mao Zedong contemplates the nature of the struggle between the capitalist and socialist forces within China. He tells Pol Pot not to blindly follow the Chinese model, but adopt Marxist theory to the Cambodian realities.\n\nAn excerpt was originally published by Cold War International History Project in Working Paper #22, 77 CONVERSATIONS Between Chinese and Foreign Leaders on the Wars in Indochina, 1964-1977 Edited by Odd Arne Westad, Chen Jian, Stein Tønnesson, Nguyen Vu Tungand and James G.

The Romanized names could not be identified.]\n\nChina —— Deng Xiaoping\n\nInterpreters: Xie Yue’e, Qi Zonghua\n\nMinutes: Wang Hairong, Tang Wensheng\n\n[Chairman Mao shakes Secretary Pol Pot’s hand warmly]\n\nSecretary Pol Pot: My respects for Chairman Mao!\n\nChairman Mao: Welcome!\n\nPol Pot: Thank you!\n\nChairman Mao: VERY WELCOME! [Mao says “very welcome” in English]\n\nPol Pot: We are very happy to be able to meet the great leader Chairman Mao here today.\n\n[Chairman Mao shakes hands with Ieng Sary]\n\nChairman Mao: [Raises two fingers] This is the second time we meet!\n\nIeng Sary: I wish Chairman Mao a long life!\n\nChairman Mao: [pointing to the Cambodians] LONG LIVE YOU!

The guests take their seats]\n\nChairman Mao: My eyes are not good, my legs are not good either and I can’t speak properly. I can’t do it anymore, I will have to depend on you!\n\nPol Pot: We are very glad to do so, we are very happy to meet the Chairman.\n\nChairman Mao: Your fighting, WAR [Mao says “war” in English], political, military, economic, foreign policies and the united front–I won’t talk about it. [Referring to Deng Xiaoping] I agree with what he says, he said you were right.\n\nPol Pot: Thank you. It warms our hearts to hear the Chairman say so.\n\nChairman Mao: We approve of what you do. Much of your experience is better than ours. China is not qualified to criticize you. We committed errors of the political lines for ten times in fifty years—some are national, some are regional (The mistakes made by) Chen Duxiu, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, and Luo Zhanglong had nothing to do with the Soviet Union. (Those made by) Wang Ming, Zhang Guotao, Gao Gang, Peng Dehuai, Liu Shaoqi, and Lin Biao involved the Soviet Union. They opposed us and divided the party, but they all failed. The party remained undivided and they were excluded. Thus I say that China has no qualification to criticize you, and can only agree with you. You are basically correct. I am not sure whether you have any shortcoming. There are bound to some and you’ll rectify by yourself. RECTIFICATION [Mao says “rectification” in English]. I won’t talk about all these. Let this fellow surnamed Deng do it. [Laughters]\n\nThere is one point I’d like to talk about. Currently you are on the transition from democratic revolution to the socialist way. SOCIALIST WAY [Mao says “socialist way” in English]. There are two possible outcomes: one is socialism, the other is capitalism. We are still struggling between the two possible outcomes now. Wang Ming, Zhang Guotao, Gao Gang, Peng Dehuai, Liu Shaoqi, and Lin Biao—they wanted to build capitalism. In the next 50 or 100 years, there will still be a struggle between these two lines. In the next ten thousand years, there will still be a struggle between the two. Even when Communism is achieved, there will still be a struggle between the two. Otherwise we aren’t Marxists. The unity of opposites, UNITY OF OPPOSITES [Mao says “unity of opposites” in English]. If we only talk about one, that’s metaphysics; if we talk about two, then it’s the UNITY OF OPPOSITES [Mao says “unity of opposites” in English], STRUGGLE OF OPPOSITES [Mao says “struggle of opposites” in English]. I believe in what Marx and Lenin said.\n\nThe road is winding. Lenin’s Soviet Union changed under Khrushchev and Brezhnev. In future, it will still return to the Lenin’s path. The same goes for China. It could become revisionist in the future, but eventually it will follow the path set by Marx and Lenin.\n\nWe are now a capitalist country without capitalists, as said by Lenin. This country wants to protect the legal rights of the capitalist classes. People’s wages are not equal. It perpetuates unequal systems under the guise of slogans of egalitarianism. That’s what we are like right now and this will continue for many years before we achieve Communism. Communism will also have two lines of struggle, and the struggles between the progressive and the backward. We can’t talk about it comprehensively as yet. These are what we openly say in the newspapers.\n\nThat’s all I have to say.\n\nPol Pot: We are very honored to be able to pay our respects to Chairman Mao here today. We have always respected Chairman Mao and learned from your works. Your writings have guided our revolution until we achieved a nationwide victory. We are able to meet Chairman Mao in person today and hear Chairman Mao talk about the issue of the lines. This is a very important and strategic issue. We will be sure to do as you say from now on. I studied many of Chairman Mao’s works from a young age, particularly your work on the people’s war. Chairman Mao’s works guided our entire party while we were engaged in the political and military struggles. We made use of it in our actual struggle and achieved results. When our struggles entered the most difficult stage, we studied the work The Struggle in the Jinggang Mountains, and it steeled our resolve. We also paid close attention to the experience of the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao after China was liberated. We read articles talking about China’s experience very closely. Chairman Mao’s earlier comments on the issue of the line struggle…\n\nChairman Mao: Uh huh.\n\nPol Pot: We also study it within the party. We pay close attention to class struggle and line struggle. We will study and learn from the experience of China until we achieve the final victory.\n\nChairman Mao: Don’t copy China’s example completely. Master Shi said, whoever attempts to be like me will get sick. Master Shi is named Kumarajiva, living during the era of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. He was a foreigner who could speak Chinese and he translated many Buddhist texts. We have to figure it out on our own. As Marx said, their teachings could only serve a guide and are not doctrines. Marx said so himself. Kumarajiva’s words were quoted by a Chinese scholar called Yan Fu . Yan was a translator. This quotation is from (the introduction of) On Evolution translated by Yan. Yan said he was not “translating”, but was “expressing the original texts elegantly,” and that was what was he did for this book [referring to On Evolution]. But he translated literally the other works such as those about political economies. This was written by (Thomas Henry) Huxley, HUXLEY [Mao says “Huxley” in English]. He was British and a supporter of Darwin and called himself “Darwin’s Bulldog.” He came up with the idea of “agnosticism. German [philosopher Immanuel] Kant talked about agnosticism. Huxley said the agnosticism talked about by Kant, only knew what was on the surface but not the substance. He [note: referring to Huxley] was a materialist in his understanding of the natural sciences and idealist with regards to the social sciences. He endorsed Indian Buddhist philosophy. Thus Marx called him a “shamefaced materialist.”\n\nI’ve never said so much to other people on the things I’ve said to you.\n\nPol Pot: Thank you. This is a great honor to us. Chairman Mao has received us today and talked to us about so many things and given us a great deal of inspiration. It is a treasure trove for our party and people. Please allow us to express our deepest thanks once again.\n\nChairman Mao: Don’t thank me. Thank Marx and Lenin. There are 30 works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, in big type, that I wish to gift to you. Marx and Lenin said it very well, better than myself.\n\nPol Pot: We are glad to receive them. We will study them very hard and apply them in accordance with the conditions in our country. We also want to continue learning Chairman Mao’s works.\n\nChairman Mao: I am not satisfied with myself.\n\nAlright, thank you!\n\nPol Pot: We are taking our leave. I wish Chairman Mao a long life! I represent our delegation, our party and all our fighters in wishing Chairman Mao longevity! Farewell!\n\nChairman Mao: Thank you.\n\nPol Pot: Goodbye!\n\nIeng Sary: I wish Chairman Mao good heath!\n\n[Chairman Mao shakes hands with the comrades of the Central Committee Members of the CPK]\n\nA media account of Cambodian history can be sourced from the extensive scrapbook of newspaper clippings (mainly drawn from publications based in Thailand) and chronologically and thematically arranged on the Ashe Family website.

Perhaps not, although there were atrocities committed by both sides during the civil war (1970-1975), which might have been a warning sign. However, what is difficult to dispute are the indications of atrocities, reported by different sources, which were committed by the Khmer Rouge after they took control in April 1975. The full knowledge of the mass killings may only have come to light after the 1978 Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and their capture of Phnom Penh in January 1979, but why was the world so silent during almost four years? The article below, Remember . . . , dated 14 August 1975, is a poignant reminder of why these events slip from the public view. But what of the politicians and the diplomats in the west, who had access not only to newspaper reports, but to the reports from their own intelligence agencies? Why did governments take so long in highlighting and condemning the suffering of the Cambodian people?\n\n(1) Phnom Penh suffers during the months before the Khmer Rouge take control.\n\n11 February 1974 (Newsweek): The French Exodus.\n\n17 January 1975 (Far Eastern Economic Review): The Cambodian Conflict.\n\n7 March 1975 (Far Eastern Economic Review): Cambodia: The chips are down.\n\n10 March 1975 (Newsweek): The Agony of Cambodia (Part 1 and Part 2).\n\n14 March 1975 (Far Eastern Economic Review): The Peking Connection & Cambodia Gasps for Life\n\n18 March 1975 (Far Eastern Economic Review): Heroics and honesty too late.\n\n21 March 1975 (Far Eastern Economic Review): Throttling Phnom Penh.\n\n(2) The Fall of Phnom Penh, cities emptied, and the killings begin.\n\n18 April 1975 (Daily Mirror): Reds Sweep to Victory.\n\n19 April 1975 (Aberdeen Evening Express): Fallen Leaders are beheaded.\n\n20 April 1975 (The People): Reds Kill 43.\n\n26 April 1975 (Birmingham Daily Post): Khmer Rouge ‘shot fleeing refugees’.\n\n8 May 1975 (Belfast Telegraph): Khmer Rouge Evacuate Millions from Cities\n\n9 May 1975 (Daily Mirror): Exodus at Gunpoint.\n\n24 June 1975 (Belfast Telegraph): Mass Killings of Defeated Troops.\n\n25 June 1975 (Birmingham Post): Dr. K. tells of Khmer Atrocity.\n\n14 August 1975 (Birmingham Daily Post): Remember . . .\n\n(3) Talks begin between Cambodia and Thailand on trade and establishing a Liaison Office.\n\n17 November 1975 (Bangkok Post): Barbed-wire goes for Khmer talks.\n\n18 November 1975 (Bangkok Post): Hugs, smiles launch Khmer liaison office.\n\n(4) Border clashes begin.\n\n31 December 1975 (Bangkok Post): Military unit clashes with border raiders.\n\n1976: Complex issues for Thailand while the killing continues in Cambodia\n\nAfter the initial emptying of the cities in 1975 and resulting deaths of an urban population expelled into the countryside, as well as initial reports of mass executions of former Lon Nol soldiers, 1976 shone a little light into the darkness that had settled over Cambodia. In addition to the reports of Thai journalists, many articles were written by journalists from AFP, AP, Far Eastern Economic Review, Newsweek, Sunday Telegraph, Time, Times Newspapers, and UPI. These focused on the terrible conditions inside Cambodia, reporting estimates of some 800,000 to one million Cambodians had been killed or died from disease after the 1975 Khmer Rouge take-over, while Thailand tried its best to build on the late 1975 opening of a border liaison office through the establishment of official trade links with Cambodia. This ultimately proved unsuccessful, and the year ended badly with serious border clashes. Click on the links below to view the collection of newspaper and magazine articles, published in 1976, which describe the ongoing suffering in Cambodia, as well as giving an indication of the complex issues facing Thailand.\n\n1. Reports from Thailand of conditions inside Cambodia\n\nEvents in neighbouring Cambodia were of considerable interest to Thailand. Would trade and diplomatic relations be possible? Would the Khmer Rouge manage to maintain control and manage the economy? Would conditions generate further waves of refugees? Would their joint border be respected?\n\n2. Reports from outside Thailand of conditions inside Cambodia\n\nI feel it is important for readers to understand that events inside Cambodia were reported widely by journalists from AFP, AP, Far Eastern Economic Review, Newsweek, Sunday Telegraph, Time, Times Newspapers, and UPI, and politicians and diplomats in many countries would have had access to these reports as well as to analysis from their own intelligence services, especially as foreigners were also disappearing from yachts along the Cambodian coast, often ending up in the infamous Tuol Sleng detention centre in Phnom Penh, where torture and death were the norm.\n\n3. Japanese journalist enters Cambodia\n\nUninvited and just walking across the border, this raised eyebrows at the time, but it turned out that he had worked in Cambodia for two years before the fall of Phnom Penh, spoke Khmer, and had a Cambodian wife, and thus had some hope of getting a story and getting out alive. However, his reporting showed how little he was really able to find out.\n\n4. Anti-communist resistance reported inside Cambodia\n\nWhile this was hyped up, no serious resistance was possible under the Khmer Rouge regime, especially as the west was unwilling to get involved again in Indo-china. However, they probably provided a useful intelligence source to Thailand, which would have provided minimal support.\n\n5. Political events in Cambodia\n\nWho was in charge in Cambodia? What were their plans for the country? The reports show how little was known at the time.\n\n6. Border Trade\n\nThere was almost certainly unofficial trading going on in some parts of the border, but an attempt was made to make Poipet-Aranya Prathet an official trading location with bartering being the currency of the day. Although this started, the end result was not very successful.\n\n7. The case of 26 refugees forcibly repatriated to Cambodia\n\nReportedly with hands tied and blindfolded, the 26 males, including two children, were sent back to Cambodia for “national security” reasons. Although several attempts were made to report that they were alive and well, reports from the border suggested that they had all been executed upon arrival.\n\n8. Border Clashes\n\nAlthough one clash was reported at the end of 1975, the 1976 clashes didn’t start until mid-year – around the same time that Thailand and Cambodia agreed to establish full relations and when they were trying to get cross-border trade started. Perhaps the soldiers weren’t talking to the diplomats?\n\n9. Other related issues affecting Thailand\n\nIt’s worth noting that while all the above was going on, Thailand was having to deal with (a) refugees who had arrived shortly after the fall of Cambodia, Laos and Viet Nam to communist forces; (b) security issues concerning ethnic Thais who had lived for years in Cambodia, then fled into Thailand in 1975 and were living with extended Thai families close to the border, and (c) a growing home-grown communist movement which was receiving training and weapons via the Khmer Rouge.\n\n10. A collage of photos showing an abandoned Poipet\n\nThese photos were taken in 1976 and early 1977 from various vantage points, such as water towers and tall trees, in Thailand with a long telephoto lens looking across the small river that marked the border with Cambodia. They show the Cambodian border town of Poipet and are indicative of how the towns and cities of Cambodia were abandoned in April 1975 and fell quickly into a state of ruin. [The first and last photos are recent satellite photos and provide a comparison with what it looked like some 40 years ago. In the first photo, the remains of the old railway line and railway bridge can still be seen].\n\n1977: Continuing attacks by the Khmer Rouge along the border, massacres of Thai citizens, and the ongoing suffering in Cambodia\n\n1977 saw continued attacks across the border into Thailand, with massacres of Thai citizens and loss of life and life-changing injuries to farmers and policemen/soldiers. Border incursions were denied by the Khmer Rouge. The massacre of 30 Thai citizens on 28 January 1977 was thought initially to be linked to the subsequent exposure of a large-scale smuggling racket involving merchants, customs officers and police on the Thai side. However, given that the Khmer Rouge were also found to be training and arming Thai communist insurgents, it is more likely that they were trying to create zones of insecurity to allow more freedom of movement to the Thai communists.\n\nThe first signs of similar cross-border attacks by the Khmer Rouge were reported later in the year along the border with Viet Nam. Refugee interviews/reports of forced labour and continued executions in Cambodia contrasted sharply with news of peace and progress issued by the Khmer Rouge leadership.\n\nMy efforts to raise awareness with western leaders, and ask that the matter be raised at the UN, fell mostly on deaf ears. In the meantime, the Cambodian people continued to suffer.\n\nBorder Clashes in January\n\nBy December 1976, Khmer Rouge intrusions into Thailand and border clashes with Thai police and army were almost a daily occurrence. This continued in January 1977 at various locations along the border making it difficult for the Thai villagers to go about their daily lives, and for the Thai authorities to predict where the next attack might take place or to defend their territory. These almost daily attacks led ultimately to a brutal massacre of Thai villagers on the night of 28 January 1977. Sadly, it would not be the last massacre during the course of 1977.\n\nThe massacre of 30 Thai citizens by the Khmer Rouge\n\nLate in the night of 28 January 1977, some 300 Khmer Rouge soldiers crossed the border into Thailand and attacked three Thai villages – in the process slaughtering indiscriminately men, women, and children. Prior to this, it had been a few people wounded, or one or two killed, in the border skirmishes, but the horrific slaughter of 30 people, including babies, was an event that gripped Thailand.\n\n3. Written protest to the UK and US governments\n\nAs I was living and working in close proximity to these villages in the border area of Aranya Prathet, this atrocity of the brutal murder of 30 men, women and children brought home to me the horror that was also taking place inside Cambodia. It compelled me to write an article (The Dark Night) about what happened as a way of drawing people’s attention to the suffering of the Cambodian people, and my plea to others to protest on behalf of the Cambodian people was taken up by a local paper in England.\n\nI then wrote a series of letters to the British and US governments to urge them to take some action on the terrible human rights violations being inflicted by the Khmer Rouge on their own population inside Cambodia, as well as now on Thai villagers. Sadly, little interest was shown in taking up the case of the Cambodian people for whom reports indicated that already some one million people had been executed.\n\nAs far as governments taking any notice and actually doing something, the quote in Bernard Levin’s article, A nation in chains, dated 28 April 1976, perhaps says it best:\n\n“And meanwhile, in Cambodia, the unburied dead cry for vengeance, and the living dead for pity; and cry, both, in vain.”\n\nHowever, later in the year, as can be seen in Section 15 below, the USA began to speak out about the mass killings, Australia condemned the Khmer Rouge in Parliament, and the UK refused to appoint an Ambassador to Cambodia because of its concern over Cambodia’s violation of human rights. Maybe, just maybe, my letters did influence some of those in the corridors of power.\n\nTwo books merit reading in terms of how the world responded to Khmer Rouge violations of human rights, and the genocide that they inflicted on their own people:\n\nWestern Responses to Human Rights Abuses in Cambodia, 1975-1980, by Jamie Frederic Metzl (1996).\n\nGenocide and the Europeans, by Karen E. Smith (2010), and the Section on Cambodia starting on page 88.\n\nAn article in the Baltimore Sun, dated 17 April 1998, on the death of Pol Pot (Pol Pot killed while world stood by) sheds some light on why the USA in particular felt unable to intervene.\n\nRefugee Stories of Life in, and Escape from, Cambodia\n\nMany individual stories can be found below in newspaper reports under 10. Reports on conditions inside Cambodia, but these accounts, some of them hand-written, come from individuals, and are therefore of considerable interest.\n\n“Murder of a Gentle Land” by John Barron and Anthony Paul\n\nA condensation of the book appeared in the February 1977 Readers Digest. A Book Review was written by Donald S. Zagoria in January 1978:\n\nBased on interviews with nearly 300 Cambodian refugees, this account describes in chilling detail the murder of Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge. It concludes that more than 1,200,000 men, women and children died as a consequence of the actions taken by the Communists after they assumed power in April 1975. Cambodia today is a land without universities, without cities, commerce, art, music, literature, science or hope. And, as one young refugee said, “There is no love anywhere.”\n\nAs well as a number of newspaper articles referring to the book, five extracts are given at the end of August/beginning of September 1977 detailing various aspects of life under the Khmer Rouge. An article on 18 September 1977 also references the book, and the author, Martin Woollacott, confesses that he and his journalist colleagues were wrong to laugh off pre-April 1975 predictions of a bloodbath.\n\nOngoing Border Clashes\n\n1977 saw a dramatic increase in both the number and severity of border clashes and intrusions by the Khmer Rouge onto Thai territory either to lay mines or to attack Thai villages or Thai patrols. Many civilians and police/soldiers were killed or severely injured during these clashes, including the death of 17 soldiers and police on 21 July 1977, and 29 civilians and police in a second massacre on 2 August. Although numerous, I have chosen to include all the reports that I have in my records not only to indicate the size of the problem faced by Thailand but also to honour the memories of those who were killed or wounded.\n\nThese newspaper reports are set out month by month (I have no records for June, when cross-border incursions most probably also occurred as I doubt that the Khmer Rouge were on holiday that month).\n\nTrade and Smuggling\n\nAlthough official cross-border trading soon disappeared as a result of armed clashes up and down the border, smuggling increased considerably. The extent of collusion between the traders/smugglers and the Thai police/customs officers shocked the government in Bangkok. Eventually three traders were sentenced to death and government officials received lengthy jail terms.\n\nThai communist links with the Khmer Rouge\n\nThe support provided by the Khmer Rouge to Thai communist insurgents became more apparent as the year went by. The rise and fall of the Communist Party of Thailand, which had all but disappeared by 1982, is told by Pierre Rousset. It became problematic for Thailand in the late 1970s because of the support provided by the Khmer Rouge to the Thai communist insurgents.\n\nReports coming out of Cambodia from or about the Khmer Rouge, including diplomatic visits\n\nThese reports provide information about:\n\n(9.1) the structure and hierarchy of the Khmer Rouge;\n\n(9.2) diplomatic visits to Cambodia or by Cambodia to other countries, as well as issues of aid and trade:\n\n(9.3) Khmer Rouge statements of peaceful intentions and denials of cross-border attacks and internal massacres;\n\n(9.4) Khmer Rouge claims on conditions inside Cambodia;\n\n(9.5) other issues.\n\n10. Reports on conditions inside Cambodia\n\nWhile some observers thought that the refugees’ descriptions of life under the Khmer Rouge were exaggerated, there was enough consistency and common threads to know that the social fabric of society had been completely destroyed and that hundreds of thousands had died from executions, malnutrition, and sickness. Despite glaring human rights violations, little seemed to have been done to raise the actions of the Khmer Rouge at the UN Commission on Human Rights.\n\n11. Contacts between Thailand and Cambodia\n\nKnowing that it would be extremely difficult to wage a conventional war against the Khmer Rouge, Thailand opted to build up its border response units, to issue protest notes to Cambodia, and to pursue a peace offensive. Probably, this was the only sane strategy, but the cross-border attacks continued.\n\n12. New Khmer refugees\n\nNew refugees continued to arrive in Thailand, but there were reports of many dying during their hazardous journey avoiding Khmer Rouge patrols as well as landmines close to the border.\n\n13. Suspected Khmer spies\n\nThe Thai police began to have a more difficult time distinguishing between real refugees and Khmer Rouge. Those intercepted at the border were often hauled away for interrogation. Some were even killed by angry village mobs.\n\n14. Anti-communist resistance in Cambodia\n\nThe reports of resistance groups operating in Cambodia were more wishful than based on reality. Nonetheless, there were some, especially in France, who spoke hopefully of mounting resistance operations in order to save the Khmer people from the Khmer Rouge oppression.\n\n15. Australia, the UK, and Australia begin to look at Cambodia issues\n\nIn July, US officials reported to the House of Representatives about the atrocities being committed by the Khmer Rouge. In August, the Australian government condemned in the strongest possible terms the repression and executions taking place in Cambodia. And in November the UK decided not to send an Ambassador to Phnom Penh over concerns on human rights violations.\n\n16. Trouble on the border with Viet Nam\n\nFinally, in August reports began to emerge that the Khmer Rouge were not only undertaking cross-border raids into Thailand, but also into Viet Nam, a fraternal communist nation. Viet Nam, of course, was much better prepared to take on the Khmer Rouge, and events would continue to play out in 1978.\n\n1978\n\nThe year began with heavy fighting along the Cambodia-Viet Nam border. This continued throughout the year and ended with a full-scale invasion by Vietnamese forces. Clashes continued along the Thai-Cambodian border – Khmer Rouge incursions and massacres of Thai citizens, in cooperation with Thai communist insurgents, were met with firm, but limited, responses by Thai forces, while Thai politicians continually explored avenues for dialogue and peace. In the meantime, the UK raised the issue of Khmer Rouge atrocities at the UN Human Rights Commission, and President Carter condemned the atrocities.\n\n1. Fighting between Cambodia and Viet Nam\n\nAlthough journalists only began reporting regularly about the border clashes between the Khmer Rouge and Viet Nam from the middle of 1977, these had been ongoing since the joint communist victories in 1975. Prior to that, and following concerted pressure from US troops on resupply routes for the Viet Cong from North Viet Nam along the border between Cambodia and Viet Nam, North Viet Nam had moved its supply routes, known as the “Ho Chi Minh trail”, across the border into Cambodia. This was done with the knowledge of the Cambodian government, who preferred to turn a blind eye to it, rather than engage in a costly fight with the North Vietnamese. Once Viet Nam was unified on 30 April 1975, Vietnamese troops were reluctant to leave their sanctuaries inside Cambodia, and the clashes between the Khmer Rouge and Viet Nam began.\n\n1977 ended with the Khmer Rouge cutting diplomatic ties with Viet Nam as a result of the border clashes, and the fighting escalated during 1978. The year ended with a full-scale invasion of Cambodia by Viet Nam on 25 December 1978. Believing that they were the saviours of the Cambodian people, who had been subjected to the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge since 1975, they soon morphed into being seen as occupiers, and they were only able to extricate themselves some 10 years later.\n\n2. Clashes on the Thai-Cambodian border\n\nA similar pattern, as in 1977, continued with sporadic attacks along the Thai-Cambodian border. The Thai government also continued with its efforts of dialogue with the Khmer Rouge to achieve peace along the border, but with very limited success.\n\n3. Contacts between Cambodia and Thailand\n\nDespite constant border attacks by the Khmer Rouge, resulting in death and injury to border police, soldiers and civilians, Thailand’s strategy continued to be one of seeking peace with its neighbour. While responding to Khmer Rouge attacks, Thailand was still facing its own internal communist group, who were being trained and supported by the Khmer Rouge. This considerably complicated matters for Thai forces, as they could not mount larger scale punitive attacks on the Khmer Rouge while they were also dealing with a sizeable home-grown communist group in the mountains behind them. The Khmer Rouge made repeated promises to end the border troubles, which they also blamed on the Thais, but no improvements could be seen.\n\n4. Smuggling activities and trade\n\nThe death of a senior police officer in an anti-smuggling operation in the waters off the southern coastal border revealed the extent of smuggling from Thailand to Cambodia. It was almost impossible to stop, and attempts at having legal trade produced little results.\n\n5. Thai communist activities and links with the Khmer Rouge (including kidnapping of Thai villagers)\n\nThese activities escalated sharply during 1978 due to the support and training from the Khmer Rouge, often resulting in jointly conducted operations on Thai soil. Villagers in these border areas lived in fear and were often the victims of attacks. Local knowledge from the Thai communists, backed up by Khmer Rouge ferocity and firepower, left death and destruction in their wake. Large numbers of villagers were often kidnapped and taken into Cambodia for “re-education”, often with one member of a family forced to return to Thailand to act as a spy, while remaining family members were held as hostages. Such activities would only begin to diminish the following year after the Khmer Rouge were driven from power.\n\n6. Khmer Serei (Free Khmer) Resistance\n\nActivities by the Khmer Serei continued, often supported from within Thailand as a way of drawing Khmer Rouge forces away from Thai villages. This had limited success, but Khmer Serei forces would increase in late 1979, often as a way to make money.\n\n7. Anti-Khmer Rouge activity supported by Viet Nam\n\nThis had far more success than on the Thai border. There was a ready pool of volunteers from among the ethnic Khmers living in Viet Nam, bolstered by increasing numbers of refugees fleeing to Viet Nam, as well as by Khmers living in “liberated” areas in Cambodia where they had become disenchanted by the hard life imposed by the Khmer Rouge. Viet Nam was far more willing to train and arm such people against the Khmer Rouge, than the Thais were, and they were able to do it with less scrutiny from the media.\n\nDiplomatic activity concerning Cambodia\n\nDifferent envoys, including from China, made the trip to Phnom Penh, either to express support, or to be shown a model of agrarian society. As Viet Nam, with Soviet support, made greater inroads into Cambodia, China began to step up training and the supply of weaponry in a forlorn attempt to stave off the inevitable. However, the odds were always against the Khmer Rouge, who were vastly outnumbered by better armed and trained Vietnamese forces.\n\nInternal Khmer politics\n\nInternally, more information began to emerge about Pol Pot and other leaders. However, it remained essentially a closed society.\n\nSituation inside Cambodia\n\nWhile more and more information about the situation inside Cambodia was revealed by escaping refugees, their information was often treated sceptically by outside Cambodia-watchers, who could scarcely comprehend the descriptions of horror by newly arrived refugees. One thing was clear, as I wrote in early 1977, if only 10% of the stories being told were true, then it was enough for the world to rise up in condemnation.\n\nWhile Cambodia draws closer to disintegration, tourism starts up\n\nIncredibly, while the fighting on the Cambodian-Vietnamese border was increasing in intensity, a former Thai General and Foreign Minister negotiated with the Khmer Rouge to begin tourist trips to Angkor Wat. One tour took place at the end of December 1978 before the Vietnamese invasion pushed westwards after capturing Phnom Penh on 7 January 1979.\n\nNew refugees from Cambodia\n\nThe numbers of new refugees began to increase, both as a result of Foreign Minister, Ieng Sary, to Bangkok in July 1978 when Khmer border forces were pulled back so as not to create an ancient during his visit, thus allowing more people to make their escape to Thailand, and also after August when Khmer forces in the west were transferred to the east to shore up the defence against the Vietnamese.\n\nThe case of a missing refugee girl\n\nResettlement of refugees continued out of Thailand, and a missing girl’s case was taken up by the Thai press, when her family were on their way out to Australia. Sadly, she was never found.\n\nThe killing of Malcolm Caldwell\n\nMalcolm Caldwell, a radical British professor, was invited, along with two US journalists, to tour Cambodia. The motive of the Khmer Rouge was to garner some sympathetic press in the face of the beginning of world-wide condemnation of their human rights record. An article in The Guardian provides background on Malcolm Caldwell and also discusses Khmer Rouge behaviour and the events that led to his death.\n\nUK and USA action on Cambodia, Amnesty appeal, and Vietnamese condemnation\n\nThe UK finally took action to bring the issue of Khmer Rouge atrocities to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, and President Carter also condemned atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge against its own people.\n\n1979: A decisive year in the lives of ordinary Khmers when the Vietnamese invasion allowed them to throw off the shackles of the Khmer Rouge and to regain a measure of freedom.\n\n1979 was to prove a decisive year in the lives of ordinary Cambodians who had witnessed mass killings and deaths from starvation and sickness, and who had lost many close family members. It is estimated that 1.5 to 2 million Cambodians were murdered or died as a result of the actions of the Khmer Rouge.\n\nThe Vietnamese, who had introduced their own form of re-education following their 1975 victory, had also suffered, like Thailand, from cross-border attacks by the Khmer Rouge. In late 1978 the Vietnamese launched a full-scale invasion of Cambodia, which led to an uneasy 10 year occupation, but which resulted in the liberation of the Khmer people. Although the Vietnamese installed a questionable communist government, under Heng Samrin, in Phnom Penh, Cambodians were able to leave their villages where they had all laboured, and many had died, under terrible conditions, and venture back to their home towns and villages in search of relatives and friends. This mass migration during 1979 had the unintended consequence of very little rice being planted that year, leading to wide-scale hunger in 1980.\n\nFollowing the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, rich ironies soon became evident:\n\n(1) Western countries, which had previously, and belatedly, decried the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge, now condemned Viet Nam for intervening in Cambodia, despite the fact that the invasion freed the Khmer people from slavery and torture.\n\n(2) Pol Pot, who had previously shunned the outside world and isolated Cambodia from everyone, now felt it was quite appropriate to call upon the world to intervene and provide aid.\n\n(3) Thailand, which had suffered terribly from Khmer Rouge border attacks for three years, as well as from Khmer Rouge support to the Thai communists, now found it convenient to forget that the ongoing destruction of the Khmer Rouge by the Vietnamese meant that the border attacks were over and that the Thai communists were finished, and, through fear of Vietnamese expansionism, now condemned Viet Nam, while quietly assisting the Khmer Rouge.\n\nViet Nam’s invasion of Cambodia\n\nWhile the Vietnamese, with a large and well-trained army as well as Soviet support, initially overwhelmed the Khmer Rouge, they sustained many casualties in later guerrilla warfare.\n\nWorld reaction to the Vietnamese invasion\n\nSoviet bloc countries, apart from Yugoslavia, eventually fell in line and supported the both Viet Nam and the new Hang Samrin government in Phnom Penh. However, the bulk of the world, afraid of being seen to support intervention in another country’s internal affairs, despite the appalling human rights record of the Khmer Rouge, condemned Viet Nam.\n\nNew political rulers in Phnom Penh\n\nThe new Heng Samrin government, clearly under the control of Viet Nam, was slow to assert itself, and needed constant military support from Viet Nam. However, they gradually began to take charge of civilian matters, even if this was with the help of Vietnamese advisors. Full military control would take much longer.\n\nThe fight for Cambodia’s seat at the UN, and international meetings\n\nAlmost immediately, the new Hang Samrin government began to make efforts to take over Cambodia’s seat at the UN General Assembly. This was fiercely resisted by the Khmer Rouge, supported by China. It would be many more years before the new Cambodian government could take a seat at the UN General Assembly.\n\nKhmer Rouge political activities\n\nThe Khmer Rouge struggled to maintain their legitimacy as the recognised government of Cambodia after being pushed out of Phnom Penh and being forced to retreat to the jungles and mountains. In this struggle, they were assisted by China and Thailand, and managed to slip their leaders across the border to Thailand, which helped them to get to various international meetings. Sihanouk, although protesting fiercely the Vietnamese invasion, began slowly to distance himself from the Khmer Rouge.\n\n6. Khmer Rouge military activities\n\nThe fortunes of war were mainly against the Khmer Rouge. The Vietnamese pursued them relentlessly, and the Khmer Rouge, along with their civilian “followers” were often pushed across the border into Thailand, where the Thai army allowed them to walk further along the border and cross back over to where the Khmer Rouge still had bases of resistance.\n\nThailand’s position on Cambodia\n\nThailand had to play a fine line between being forced to accept thousands of new refugees, and being seen to provide too much support to the Khmer Rouge by allowing them to use the porous border. They made a point of telling everyone that Thailand would be the last to recognise the new government in Phnom Penh.\n\nThai border with Cambodia\n\nNo longer having to patrol the border to fight off Khmer Rouge incursions, the police and army now had to manage the large numbers of Khmer Rouge, civilians, and even some of Heng Samrin’s troops, who often had no choice but to flee across the border to avoid being killed. Thailand’s biggest fear was that the war could spill over onto Thai territory in the event that Viet Nam staged “hot pursuit” cross-border raids to try and wipe out fleeing Khmer Rouge troops.\n\nSituation inside Cambodia\n\nAs refugees fled across the border into Thailand, they told their stories of what life had been like under the Khmer Rouge. In addition, the first evidence began to emerge of mass killings by the Khmer Rouge during their reign of terror. As Heng Samrin’s government began to take more control, more information flowed out about their efforts to return Cambodia to a semblance of normality.\n\nNew refugees and refugee issues\n\nAlthough “real” refugees continued to cross the border, these were often mixed up with large numbers of Khmer Rouge fleeing Vietnamese attacks. This put real pressure on Thailand, and the lack of offers of thousands of resettlement places forced the Thai government to think of alternative solutions to relieve their burden. The Thai army disarmed soldiers as and when possible but, in order to avoid large numbers of Khmer Rouge remaining in Thailand, they also allowed them to transit Thai territory to seek sanctuary further south back in Cambodia.\n\nThe successful resettlement of Somaly and Panita – two young girls in a family of four refugees\n\nSomaly and Panita, born in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to Virak Phong Lach and Var Hong, both developed very successful careers. Somaly graduated in medicine and became a doctor. Panita graduated in law and became a project manager. They then went on to combine their careers with motherhood — each raising two lovely children. However, their success stories had difficult beginnings.\n\nLarge-scale repatriations back to Cambodia\n\nIn the end, unable to see a solution to the thousands of refugees swarming across their border, Thailand announced in May that they would handle refugees in their own way. In early June, they began the process of moving refugees in hundreds of buses back to Cambodia via the border in Surin Province. Unable to use the border road north, both because of its poor condition and because of possible ambushes from units of the still active Thai communists, the buses took the road west to Prachinburi, north to Korat, and east to Surin. This gave the impression to the refugees that they were being moved to a new camp deeper inside Thailand. When they reached their destination after dark, the buses were moved forward one by one close to the border. As the refugees disembarked from each bus, they were herded forward in darkness where Thai soldiers encouraged them to walk across the border through a mountain pass. None were allowed to return, and later survivors would report the deaths of many from landmines, disease and hunger.\n\nThai communist insurgents\n\nWhile some Thai communist activity continued, they were cut off from their support, supply, and training bases in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. They would gradually whither away.\n\n22 January 1979 (Bangkok Post): War “a setback for Thai reds”\n\n24 January 1979: Thai Reds in Cambodia flee to Banthad Mt\n\n8 May 1979 (Nation): Ban Laem – The other side of border turmoil\n\n30 May 1979 (Bangkok Post): Khmer arms “reaching Thai Reds”\n\n22 June 1979 (Nation): “Pro-Peking Reds offer cooperation”\n\nAbducted Thai villagers\n\nThe issue of Thai villagers abducted by joint Thai communist/Khmer Rouge units resolved itself fairly quickly as the camps in which they were being held were abandoned and the villagers were able to escape back into Thailand. A different, but later, issue would be Thai traders/smugglers venturing across the border to profit from one side or the other and being held.\n\n23 January 1979: Abducted villagers flee across border\n\n23 January 1979: Thai villagers flee captivity\n\n30 January 1979: Abducted villagers return\n\nKhmer Serie (Free Khmer) activities\n\nThe Khmer Serei “activities” against the Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces were often hyped up, and those on the ground in the border areas were more involved in trade and absorbing aid supplies for re-sale.\n\n15 January 1979: 80 Free Khmers enter Surin\n\n16 January 1979: Lon Nol troopers seek temporary refuge in Thailand\n\n20 January 1979 (Nation): Free Khmer guards\n\n20 April 1979 (Business Times): Is In Tam to boost Pol Pot?\n\n2 May 1979 (Business Times): Khmer Seree to assist Pol Pot\n\n15 May 1979 (Reuter): Khmers to recruit a former enemy?\n\nThe short-lived tourist tours to Angkor Wat\n\nTours to Angkor Wat, which had been organised in late 1978, came to a rapid halt in early 1979, as the Khmer Rouge lost control of airports and major cities.\n\n10 January 1979 (Nation): Angkor Wat flights suspended\n\n10 January 1979 (UPI): Angkor Wat flights indefinitely suspended\n\n10 January 1979 (UPI): Want a ticket to Angkor, cheap?\n\nA year ago, the headline summed it up:\n\nNuon Chea, An Architect Of Khmer Rouge’s Genocidal Restructuring Of Cambodia, Dies [i]\n\nsecond only to the movement leader Pol Pot in the hierarchy , Nuon Chea was believed to be the ideologue of the group.\n\nNuon Chea in the late1970s.\n\nAlthough there were better known thesis by Khieu Samphan[ii] and Hou Yuon[iii] , the former university law student was universally regarded as the regime’s unrepentant revolutionary. Documentation from the Democratic Kampuchea regime – such as that collected in “Pol Pot Plans the Future: Confidential Leadership Documents from Democratic Kampuchea, 1976-1977”[iv]— contains no acknowledged individual author reflecting the collective anonymity that surrounded the ruling party. Nuon Chea self-identified as a conventional Marxist-Leninist, his formal communist training was in Vietnam. Regularly described as the ideologue of the regime, it is attributed to a man who did not write a single word of the party philosophy.There is no readily accessible voluminous book of Nuon Chea’s writings that describes his vision for Cambodia’s revolution. Afterall, he did tell a visiting Danish delegation that:\n\n“As for our books, they are only a few pages in length, as brief documents are more suitable for poor peasants. We also have some courses, mostly short ones for small groups -in underground work for two to three people-once or twice a month. There are also other courses held about twice a year in which party members are introduced to revolutionary concepts and educated in our political, ideological and organizational line.” [v]\n\nStill his reputation as an ideologue is inferred from his practice. His principle role as a senior leader was responsibility for organisational matters, and the dissemination of political and strategic lines to cadres throughout the party. Chea’s statement made to the KAP/ Communist Workers’ Party of Denmark in July 1978 is one Speech by Nuon Chea readily accessible.[vi] In it he talks of the history of the Communist Party of Kampuchea and an ideological adherence to Marxism-Leninism. He did speak at a banquet in Beijing the following month when “Nuon Chea in his speech warmly congratulated China on its achievements in various fields after the downfall of the “gang of four.” [vii]\n\nA transcription of the speech provided by the Democratic Kampuchea foreign ministry –dated Peking, September 3, 1978 – notes the “great revolutionary fraternal friendship between our two parties, two peoples and two countries” and is characterised by the emphasis on “adhering firmly to the principles of independence, equality and mutual respect”. There was an absence of references to any ideas or practices, that western researcher had referred to as Cambodia’s ill-digested half-baked Maoism. This is contrary to the familiar assertions that Pol Pot and Democratic Kampuchea were driven either by a Maoist fundamentalism or adopted an ideology close to the Maoism of the Cultural Revolution period. [viii]\n\nThe New York Times obituary[ix] described Nuon Chea as\n\n“the most assertive and self-assured, describing his actions as a patriotic attempt to defend his country against aggression, particularly from Vietnam.”\n\n“Oppression and injustice compelled me to devote myself to fight for my country,” he said. “I had to leave my family behind to liberate my motherland from colonialism and aggression and oppression by thieves who wish to steal our land and wipe Cambodia off the face of the earth.”\n\nHis testimony at the popularly-called Khmer Rouge tribunal amounted to a history lesson, through the eyes of the CPK, of a country besieged by enemies, ravaged by American bombing and torn by subversives and traitors who needed to be rooted out through the evacuation of the cities and the purges in which the movement devoured itself.\n\n“He is a sincere, well-trained Marxist Leninist, and to some extent a Cambodian patriot, as well,” Mr. Chandler wrote in an email message before Nuon Chea’s death. “These facts tend to blur and mistakenly mitigate his record as the man more or less in command of the purges.”\n\nChea told the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia – the so-called Khmer Rouge tribunal which started work in 2006 – that he was mainly in charge of educating fellow cadres. He said he had educated cadres “to love, respect and serve the people and the country”.\n\n“I never educated or instructed them to mistreat or kill people, to deprive them of food or commit genocide,” he added. [x]\n\n“I wasn’t a war criminal,” he said in a 2004 interview with the Associated Press. “I admit that there was a mistake. But I had my ideology. I wanted to free my country. I wanted people to have well-being.”\n\nAmerican academic, David P. Chandler observed: “He was not a dreamer. Pol Pot was, and that appealed to people. Nuon Chea was not liked, because he couldn’t be reached or rented. He is genuinely impressive, as lots of Khmer are not.”\n\nBorn on 7 July 1926, Nuon Chea was a pseudonym for Lau Kim Korn, also known as Longreth Raodi, who was born to a prosperous Sino-Khmer family in Battambang,\n\nHe studied law at the prestigious Thammasat University in Bangkok, where he became a member of the Communist Party of Thailand in 1950. The following year, he joined the Vietnamese-led Communist Party of Indochina and returned to his homeland to take up arms in the fight against French co­lo­ni­al­ism.\n\nHis cousin, later exposed as a government double agent, Sieu Heng led the weak and clandestine Cambodian communist movement, the Khmer People’s Revolutionary Party, at the time. Chea studied for two years at party schools in Vietnam before returning to Cambodia in 1955. He helped a former monk, Tou Samouth, run the urban branch of the movement, and he worked closely with a young schoolteacher, Saloth Sar (later known as Pol Pot), who had recently returned from France.\n\nIn its early stages, that movement was largely in disarray, facing constant threats from harassment and arrest by Sihanouk’s authorities and having neither a clear strategy nor adequate resources, according to Nuon Chea. Nuon Chea and Saloth Sar, played key roles in building up a home-grown movement free from the dominance of Vietnam.\n\nNuon Chea said he and Pol Pot worked together in mapping out “a strategic path and tactics” that the party adopted at a clandestine congress at the Phnom Penh railway station in September 1960. He was elected deputy secretary of an underground party , whose members were dubbed the “Khmers Rouges” (Red Khmers) by Cambodia’s then-leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The Communist Party of Kampuchea, also known as the shadowy “Angkar”, or Organisation, was unveiled publicly only in 1977.\n\n“Marxism-Leninism was the goal of the party, which had to be built from the countryside up. Rural areas were the basis for cities to rely on and ignite” the revolution, Nuon Chea said. [xi]\n\nWhen Sihanouk’s government published a list of 34 suspected “subversive agents” in 1963, Pol Pot, who was on the list under his real name, fled the capital with others. Nuon Chea, whose identity remained secret, stayed behind, working variously as a teacher, food vendor and company clerk while trying to build the party, and occasionally travelling in disguise to visit Pol Pot in his jungle hideouts. Chea eventually joined Pol Pot in a new party base in the remote north-east of Cambodia in 1968 returning to Phnom Penh with the liberation forces in April 1975.\n\nIn the marquis\n\nChea served as deputy secretary of its Central Committee , a member of its Standing Committee, the most senior bodies responsible for party policy, and in the Democratic Kampuchea as chairman of the People’s Assembly. “As the person primarily responsible for organisational matters and security in the party, it is arguable that he ultimately had more influence on the development and policies of the Khmer Rouge than did Pol Pot. It is certainly fair to say that he was at least equal to Pol Pot in his importance.” argued Craig Etcheson, a western academic on modern Cambodia.[xii]\n\nThere is a consensus among the small group of western academics who are commonly referenced and frame the discussion on the regime.\n\n“There is substantial and compelling evidence that Nuon Chea, commonly known as ‘Brother Number Two’ played a leading role in devising the CPK’s execution policies,” wrote Stephen Heder and Brian Tittemore in their book “Seven Candidates for Prosecution”. “There is also substantial evidence that he played a central role in implementing those policies.”\n\nAccording to testimony of the chief of S-21 prison , Khang Khek Ieu (also known as Comrade Duch), a former mathematics teacher, Chea personally approved the arrests and executions of hundreds of senior and mid-ranking party figures suspected of betraying the state.\n\nChandler supports the conclusion that Chea presided over extensive purges of suspected enemies within and outside the ruling party, resulting in the execution of more than 300,000 Cambodians between 1975 and 1979.[xiii]\n\nNuon Chea laid out plans in 1975 for creating an agrarian socialist state, involving orders to “improve and “purify” the party ranks, Chea Sim, a Khmer Rouge official turned defector, explained in a 1991 interview.\n\nIn the award-winning 2009 documentary “Enemies of the People“, Cambodian film-maker Thet Sambath — who lost his parents and a brother under the regime – contained revelations from him. In the film, Nuon Chea can be seen sitting at a table in his modest wooden home, calmly telling Thet Sambath that the Khmer Rouge killed perceived traitors if they could not be “re-educated” or “corrected”, he said:\n\n“These people were categorised as criminals… They were killed and destroyed. If we had let them live, the party line would have been hijacked. They were enemies of the people.”\n\nDuring his years in power, Chea earned a reputation for dogmatism and ruthlessness. He put into practice the policies of the party, which included emptying the cities, closing schools and monasteries, abolishing private property and empowering the poorest of the poor. These policies, set in motion at breakneck speed, were enormously costly in human terms: in addition to those executed by the state, almost one and a half million Cambodians are estimated to have died during those years, of starvation, overwork and misdiagnosed diseases.[xiv]\n\nLabelled ultra-Maoist, the standard view presented is of revolutionaries who tried to recreate Buddhist-majority Cambodia into an agrarian Marxist utopia in an attempted to abolish class while targeting religious groups and the educated. Nuon Chea, was the only accused to be convicted of the genocide of the Cham Muslims. This group was restricted in its ability to exercise its religion and culture throughout the DK regime. And from 1977 onwards, it is said this developed into a policy of deliberate extermination.\n\nNuon Chea toasts a delegation to Democratic Kampuchea\n\nAfter the Vietnamese invasion in 1979, Nuon Chea retreated with other leaders into the jungles, where they continued a resistance war against Vietnamese occupation. The CPK had dissolved itself in 1981 and the renamed Democratic Kampuchea forces still controlled areas of Cambodia for the next two decades. Fighting alone and in coalition with Sihanouk and other Cambodian forces against the Phnom Penh authorities until the final collapse of their movement in 1998.\n\nThe Cambodian communist movement had begun to fragment in 1997, and Chea shifted his loyalties to its new leader, Ta Mok. In December 1998, after Pol Pot had died, Nuon Chea was one of the last high-ranking leaders to surrender to the government in 1998 in exchange for an amnesty, and settled with his wife and children in the town of Pailin on the Thai-Cambodian border, where he lived very modestly.\n\nWhen the United Nations-sponsored tribunal set to try the leaders of Democratic Kampuchea finally convened in Phnom Penh, Chea was arrested in 2007 and imprisoned. He was indicted for crimes against humanity in September 2010, and went on trial in June 2011, alongside his former colleagues Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan and Khieu Thirith.\n\nProsecution’s star witness, Kang Guek Eav, also known as Duch, testified he met regularly with Nuon Chea or Son Sen to give them updates on the prisoner “confessions” and at Toul Sleng S-21 security centre operations. Duch said Nuon Chea replaced Son Sen in 1977 as head of Santebal – the regime’s secret police. “When Pol Pot was absent, Nuon Chea replaced him, and when Pol Pot issued an order, Nuon Chea followed up on how it was applied,” Duch told the court.\n\nThe academic Stephen Heder agrees:\n\n“He was not merely a functionary cog in the crushing wheel of history, but the steely, determined key figure whose job it was to turn Pol Pot’s radically fundamentalist Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist and Maoist dreams into reality by any and all means necessary”.\n\nNuon Chea was “irreplaceable, and without his efforts what became the Pol Pot regime would never have come into being,” Heder said. “He indeed remained unrepentant to the end, not wavering ideologically or otherwise from his ruthless dedication as a true believer in Pol Pot’s revolutionary visions.”[xv]\n\nAt his trial at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), Nuon Chea defended the decision to evacuate Cambodian cities, saying it was to save the population from feared US bombardment and ensure access to food supplies. He blamed Vietnamese agents for virtually everything that went wrong during 44 months of the Democratic Kampuchea regime.\n\nDuring his testimony, he insisted that the regime was not responsible for any atrocities and reiterated long-standing claims that mass graves found after the Democratic Kampuchan regime was ousted from power held the bodies of people killed by Vietnamese troops.\n\n“These war crimes and crimes against humanity were not committed by the Cambodian people,” Nuon Chea said. “It was the Vietnamese who killed Cambodians.”[xix]\n\nHe argued that the vast majority of deaths were committed by Vietnamese-backed factions within the party’s ranks. The party was “cleaved with deep factional divisions and plagued by internecine armed conflict,” Nuon Chea’s defence team at the ECCC Tribunal in Phnom Penh argued. (see Appendix 2)\n\nThe judges disagreed. Nuon Chea and former DK head of state Khieu Samphan were sentenced to life in jail in two separate trials, first in 2014 for crimes against humanity and again in 2018 for genocide and other crimes. Nuon Chea had declined to make any final comments before the court, with his lawyer Victor Koppe saying Chea decried the tribunal as a “deeply flawed and broken institution” and a product of “victor’s justice”.[xvi]\n\nHis final statement in court, presented by his lawyer, Victor Koppe, called attention to his 500-page closing brief, including 4,000 footnotes, which the lawyer said presented the real history of the movement “and not some quote-unquote fake history.”[xviii]\n\n“I don’t want the next generation to misunderstand history. I don’t want them to believe the Khmer Rouge are bad people, are criminals,” Nuon Chea testified in 2011 at the age of 85. “Nothing is true about that.”[xvii]\n\nNuon Chea spoke to an American reporter, Amanda Pike in 2002:\n\nThe closest he comes to admitting any responsibility is when he says, “A person’s not always wrong and not always right. Like the leaders — we did some wrong, but we also did some right. Just because you’re wrong doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. If you do anything, you’re going to make mistakes.”[xx]\n\n“Through this trial it has been shown clearly that I was not engaged in any commission of the crimes as alleged by the co-prosecutors. In short, I am innocent in relation to those allegations,” he said.\n\n“I would like to express my deepest remorse and moral responsibility to victims and the Cambodian people who suffered during the Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge) regime,” Nuon Chea added.[xxi]\n\nAppendix 1:\n\nDid the Khmer Rouge’s Nuon Chea escape the truth in death?[xxii]\n\nPrum Phalla [xxiii]\n\nNuon Chea, the Khmer Rouge’s ‘Brother Number Two’ at ECCC\n\nNuon Chea, the Khmer Rouge’s “Brother Number Two” died in hospital on August 4 at the age of 93.\n\nHe had been being found guilty by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) of genocide and crimes against humanity and handed a life sentence.\n\nHe was imprisoned at the ECCC detention facility.\n\nHe had faced trial with Khieu Samphan, the Khmer Rouge’s head of state, who was also found guilty and given life in prison.\n\nIt took more than 10 years for the court to bring its final judgement, which remains unfinished due to Chea’s death.\n\nAfter his passing, there remains debate as to whether the court will ever be able to serve the full truth.\n\nAt first Chea spoke much about what he believed were the catalysts for his crimes.\n\nHowever, during live testimony, he challenged the authenticity of the scanned documents used to charge him, which he said were not original.\n\nThey were copies, or the copies of copies, he said. He said he would not answer any questions unless the original documents were shown.\n\nThe Trial Chamber ruled he could do so as this was within his rights.\n\nAdditionally, he felt the court had treated his legal team differently to the co-prosecutors during document presentation and cross-examination.\n\nThese two issues were the main reasons for him to use his right to remain silent.\n\nUnlike the court, the public felt Chea was trying to escape the truth and deny justice for his victims.\n\nThis notion is now even more ingrained after his death.\n\nHaving worked for more than 10 years with his defence team, I would say Chea did try to present his truth as he saw it – a truth limited by the proceedings of the court.\n\nIf one had closely followed the trials, one would understand that events outside their scope were not allowed to be discussed.\n\nAs he said during live testimony on November 22, 2011: “Only the body of the crocodile was mentioned and not the head and tail, which are very important to its daily activities. In other words, the root causes and consequences of the events that occurred before 1975 and after 1979 are not to be discussed.”\n\nAfter departing a short while from the 739-page closing order, the court separated the full order into Case 002/01 and Case 002/02 due to its resources and the age of the accused.\n\nHad this severance not been made, perhaps there would never have been any final judgements made against Chea.\n\nCase 002/01 was mostly about forced evacuations, and Chea gave lengthy presentations as to the reasons behind them.\n\nOnce the trial concluded, Chea, like the other parties, submitted his version of events through his lawyers in a closing brief.\n\nThe Trial Chamber judges then released a 702-page judgement announcing the truth according to them.\n\nHowever, Chea felt some of it was inaccurate and appealed to the ECCC’s Supreme Court Chamber.\n\nParts of the convictions were quashed but the life sentence remained.\n\nCase 002/02 was larger as it included more crime sites and factual allegations.\n\nChea again submitted the truth as he saw it in a 550-page closing brief.\n\nThe Trial Chamber issued another judgement – at 2,259 pages one of the longest of any international criminal tribunal – which almost entirely disagreed with Chea’s version.\n\nHe was again sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n‘No one to talk’\n\nChea once told me that Slobodan Praljak, facing trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for war crimes in Bosnia, was stupid to kill himself with cyanide in 2017 to oppose the court’s ruling.\n\nHe said such an act was cowardly.\n\nHe said that he would struggle until his last breath to explain to the people what had happened.\n\nChea filed a notice of appeal on the grounds he wanted to challenge the Trial Chamber’s truth.\n\nOnce he learned he was dying, he requested the Supreme Court Chamber allow his lawyers and family members to continue to file his appeal brief so his truth could be considered and made known to the public.\n\nIt was very unfortunate that the Supreme Court Chamber terminated the proceedings against him as there will now not be his appeal brief, a last chance to show the public his truth.\n\nAs he said on the value of history not long before his death: “Inheritance is a treasure and is very important. Please save the writings little by little so we can help each other. I will help with the reading and correcting. It is not about correcting the words but the thoughts, and to see if I have missed anything.\n\n“So please all, talk to me if you have anything. I often think that if I die, all these accounts will also buried because there will be no one to talk.”\n\nHe once told me there was no way he could successfully fight against his convictions.\n\nHe responded to the judgement that imposed a life sentence with: “That is fine. I had prepared for this in advance. I have no regrets at all.\n\n“As I told you, I do not care about my personal story, but I care about overall justice for the people, which is important for the nation.\n\n“But the court will affect the nation because it is not representing national justice. Justice and injustice are in conflict. I am struggling not only for my justice but for justice in general because it is universal. There is no justice in the world. Reality is existence – it is a dharma [Buddhist cosmic law] that will never die.\n\n“Therefore, I would say I am a patriot and I was right to struggle for the nation.\n\n“I don’t deny the victims. I only talk about the Communist Party of Kampuchea’s guidelines, which tried to help the poor to have enough to eat and proper clothing, and to escape from their oppressors.\n\n“I would share moral condolences with the victims, but I would not apologise as I was not wrong.”\n\nThe court may reveal a limited truth, one that can be found in the major documents, especially the closing briefs and judgements.\n\nBut the truth outside the scope of the trial remains sealed.\n\nFurthermore, the truth as perceived by the victims may be different from the truth found at a court of law, because a court must try to dispense justice and truth while respecting the right to a fair trial that every accused should have.\n\nPeople attend a funeral for Nuon Chea in Pailin province\n\nAppendix 2:\n\nFactions or Fiction?\n\nGeorge Wright | Cambodia Daily | June 18, 2016 | https://english.cambodiadaily.com/features/factions-or-fiction-114272/\n\nFor Nuon Chea, the greatest threat to the Khmer Rouge lay within its own ranks.\n\n“If we did not kill the internal traitors in our party, if we did not smash the enemy, there would be no Cambodia today,” the regime’s “Brother Number Two” tells journalist Thet Sambath in the book “Behind the Killing Fields.”\n\n“If we looked at the resistance movement when we fought an enemy that had good weapons and artillery, we thought it was a big deal. But the internal enemies were the worst and even more dangerous to the party and the country,” he says.\n\nFar from being unified, Nuon Chea—who is on trial at the Khmer Rouge tribunal for crimes including genocide—argues that the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) was wrought with internal strife as powerful factions plotted to overthrow the regime’s leadership.\n\nThis theory of internal conflict has been the bedrock of Nuon Chea’s defense at the court since the start of his previous trial for crimes against humanity in 2011. Contrary to widely accepted characterization of the CPK as a highly centralized party controlled by Pol Pot and his most trusted advisers, Nuon Chea’s lawyers argue that many of the atrocities attributed to the regime’s leadership were actually carried out by rival factions without any authorization.\n\n“Rather than being ‘strictly hierarchical’ and ‘pyramidal,’ the CPK was cleaved with deep factional divisions and plagued by internecine armed conflict,” according to a document released as part of Nuon Chea’s appeal against his guilty verdict in June last year.\n\n“‘Zone leaders’ such as Sao Phim and Ruos Nhim, rather than being subordinated to Pol Pot and Nuon Chea, were powerful leaders who exercised substantial independent authority with which Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and others could not lightly interfere,” it reads.\n\n“Sao Phim, Ruos Nhim and others such as Koy Thuon leveraged their authority from the earliest days after the liberation on 17 April 1975 to foment rebellion and/or treason against the legitimate government of Democratic Kampuchea.”\n\nRuos Nhim was a carpenter who joined the anti-colonial Issarak movement before eventually siding with the Khmer Rouge. In “Behind the Killing Fields,” Nuon Chea claims that Ruos Nhim was arrested and sent to the Phnom Penh’s notorious S-21 security center after being accused of plotting with Sao Phim to overthrow the party leadership and of providing insufficient food to the people living in his zone—claims Ruos Nhim “confessed” to under torture at the prison.\n\nAccording to a transcript of his confession in the book, Ruos Nhim and Sao Phim arranged a meeting in June 1977 during which they hatched a plan to overthrow the government with the help of the Vietnamese.\n\nNuon Chea claims that Sao Phim—a former farmer and soldier who decided to take up arms against the French in the 1950s—was like a brother to him after they met during the early days of the Cambodian communist movement of that decade. As the movement gained momentum in the ’60s, Sao Phim acted as Nuon Chea’s bodyguard, before being put in charge of the vital East Zone, which shared a border with Vietnam.\n\nBut when purges of suspected traitors within the party began to be carried out with increasing frequency, the East Zone became a primary target due to fears that the region’s leaders were colluding with the Vietnamese, and Sao Phim committed suicide in 1978 after escaping an attack by forces loyal to the CPK’s central leadership.\n\nOthers “smashed” by the regime over accusations of treachery and attempting to overthrow the party include Deputy Prime Minister Vorn Vet, North Zone Secretary Koy Thuon and West Zone Secretary Chou Chet.\n\nAn article penned by Anthony Paul and published in Asiaweek magazine on January 26, 1979—just weeks after Vietnam’s overthrow of the Khmer Rouge—seems to support the theory that the communist regime was rife with warring factions as early as 1977.\n\n“Commune workers were aware that armed resistance to the Pol Pot authorities had existed in Cambodia for a long time,” Mr. Paul wrote.\n\n“Since July 1977, fighting had been going on in dense jungle around the Tonle Sap. In that month, villagers had heard the sounds of heavy artillery and automatic weapons; almost every week thereafter, they heard them again. Khmer Rouge soldiers told them of fighting between Pol Pot forces and guerrilla units led by a certain Ruos Nhim, said to have been the former Khmer Rouge commander of the northwest military region,” he wrote.\n\n“Accused by Pol Pot loyalists of being pro-Vietnamese and an agent for both the CIA and the KGB, he had fled to lakeside guerilla redoubts, along with a deputy commander named San, a divisional commander, Neou, [and] a substantial force and quantities of arms and ammunition.”\n\nThe article also mentions villagers who were concerned that family members had been caught up in the “Ruos Nhim fighting” after they failed to return from a trip to collect fish paste near the Tonle Sap lake.\n\nRob Lemkin, a British filmmaker who with Mr. Sambath co-directed the documentary “Enemies of the People”—which includes in-depth interviews with Nuon Chea—said the CPK was far from unified, and that he had evidence, in the form of unseen interviews, of planned rebellions less than a month after the communists took over Cambodia.\n\n“Within a month of the takeover of power by the Khmer Rouge—Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and so on—senior leadership in the CPK were making separate plans for a separate military-backed administration and they were trying to work out how to achieve that,” Mr. Lemkin said last week from his home in the U.K.\n\n“This was really a kind of civil war that was going on inside of Cambodia, but it was a secret civil war because of the nature of the totalitarian state that they had created which had shut its borders to the rest of the world so the rest of the world couldn’t know exactly what was going on.”\n\nAlthough he declined to say more about the interviews that support this theory—as he plans to include them in upcoming projects—Mr. Lemkin said they were “sort of consistent with the fragmented evidence that you get from Tuol Sleng.”\n\n“Of course, with all torture confessions, often people do say things, and the interrogators write all kinds of things down which are kind of just to please their immediate superior,” he added. “But if you look at the analysis of what those confessions talk about, they do show you really quite a lot of actual real organizing by people who are not really keen for the Pol Pot leadership to remain in control of the country.”\n\nMr. Lemkin insists he has no interest in absolving Nuon Chea or Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan of the crimes they are accused of—he says there is “no question” that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against ethnic Vietnamese—but believes that the likes of Ruos Nhim had considerable autonomy over their regions.\n\nHe notes that the 1975 massacre of former Khmer Republic soldiers at Tuol Po Chrey has been attributed to Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan by the tribunal, despite the fact neither were mentioned once in three pages of legal findings related to the site attached to their guilty verdict in August 2014. (Both were convicted of crimes against humanity.)\n\n“Ruos Nhim ordered it. That was the evidence that t"
