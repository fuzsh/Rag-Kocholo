        "text": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, Oct. 11 - Playing one final hand in a lifelong game of chance, King Norodom Sihanouk has engineered the succession of his most self-effacing son, Prince Norodom Sihamoni, to the throne his father has held for more than 60 years.\n\nOn Monday, the government took the final steps to prepare a nine-member Throne Council that is charged, under the Constitution, with selecting a new king. In this case, its action, expected this week, will probably be a formality.\n\nIn a series of maneuvers over recent days, the king announced his surprise resignation and secured the backing for his choice of the country's most powerful man, Prime Minister Hun Sen, as well as the most ambitious of his sons, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.\n\nHis choice, Prince Sihamoni, 51, has been as absent from the country's affairs as his father has been dominant. He is a ballet dancer, choreographer and cinematographer who lives in France and until last month was Cambodia's representative to Unesco.\n\nHe began his career as a performer at the age of 14, when he played the title role in \"The Little Prince,\" in a film shot by his father, a prolific filmmaker and songwriter himself.\n\nThe prince is now in Beijing, where King Sihanouk, 81, has a home and is undergoing medical treatment. The father says the son had to be persuaded to accept the throne.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
