The title may not ring a bell among Western audiences, though the tune itself might carry a sonic reminder of that era. Like almost all the music heard in the film, it was a product of the vibrant pop music scene that flourished in Cambodia during the ill-fated reign of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.\n\nPopular songs are both ephemeral and durable. They have their brief season of radio airplay and then linger in memory as permanent tokens of generational identity. The Cambodian musical culture that spawned the soundtrack of Mr. Pirozzi’s film was marvelously fertile, absorbing a wide range of Western influences and infusing them with traditional Khmer themes and singing styles. There were go-go bands and girl groups, crooners and bubble-gum divas, skinny suits and big hairdos, funk and psychedelia. But all of it — the record stores and discothèques, the atmosphere of youthful exuberance and romantic longing — proved tragically fragile, unable to withstand the forces of war and political fanaticism.\n\nBecause it concentrates on the music — interviewing surviving fans and artists, generously sampling old 45s and video clips — “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten” offers a fresh and powerful account of Cambodia’s painful history. Like Rithy Panh’s “Missing Picture,” a family chronicle of almost unimaginable suffering and loss at the hands of the Khmer Rouge, Mr. Pirozzi’s film is an unsparing and meticulous reckoning of the effects of tyranny on ordinary Cambodians. It is also a rich and defiant effort at recovery, showing that even the most murderous totalitarianism cannot fully erase the human drive for pleasure and self-expression.\n\nAnd Cambodia from the late 1950s to the mid-’60s looks very pleasant indeed — a land of flowering trees and blossoming cultural possibilities. Prince Sihanouk, while not exactly a democrat, was a patron of the arts and a music lover with a decent singing voice. After his country peacefully negotiated its independence from France, he tried to keep it on a neutral and independent path, something that proved increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible as the Cold War heated up in neighboring Vietnam.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
