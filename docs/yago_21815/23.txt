Plot summary

After the 1991 peace agreements, a handsome, young Cambodian doctor returns from Paris to volunteer his services at a clinic in his home village in rural Cambodia, just outside the capital city. Most of his patients are victims of land mines. A love triangle of sorts comes to pass as he falls in love with a young nurse at the clinic, while fending off the advances of his cousin (unhappily married to an amputee war hero).
