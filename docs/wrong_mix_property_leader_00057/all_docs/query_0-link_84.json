Cornelius's work transcends music, encompassing live stages, record artwork, products, and publications. His outstanding creations have significantly influenced my journey as a creator.\n\nThe development of 'THE AMBIENT MACHINE' stems from my experiences during the pandemic, where I felt the need to use sound to condition and create environments. This led to the conception of a versatile tool that combines functionality and artistry.\n\nLast year, I had the privilege of visiting Japan and attending Mr. Oyamada's exhibition and concert. This experience highlighted our shared interest in the concept of \"Ambient,\" solidifying my belief in the potential of this collaboration.\n\nFor this project, Mr. Oyamada has crafted a bespoke ambient sound work, versatile to suit any environment. Together, we have also redesigned the identity of 'THE AMBIENT MACHINE', introducing new colors that symbolize its dual nature as both a device and an instrument.\n\nThis collaboration goes beyond Cornelius's new music piece; it offers a unique tool to shape and enhance environments.

Spending long times indoors result in the awareness of various noises around us, such as sounds coming from outside, sounds emitted indoors, and reverberations. Yuri Suzuki, a sound artist, believes that by replacing these sounds with environmental music, we can spend a better time in our homes, and thus he created \"THE AMBIENT MACHINE\".\n\nThis work of art, designed by Yuri Suzuki, allows customization of ambient music by combining four functions (play/stop, volume up/down, reverb on/off, BPM fast/slow) for each of the eight sound sources, such as sounds of acoustic instruments and soundscapes.\n\nInformation on exhibiting at Interior life Style 2023\n\n09 JUNE, 2023\n\nWe are honored to announce that we will exhibit at Interior Lifestyle Tokyo 2023 with the launch of our new collection designed by Yuri Suzuki.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you at our booth.\n\nDATE : 14-16 June 2023\n\n10:00 - 18:00 (Last day closed at 16:30)\n\nVENUE : Tokyo Big Sight, West hall Hall 1ã»2 + Atrium\n\nBooth Number : Meet Design / T002\n\nExhibitor Name : E&Y CO.,LTD.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOur showroom will close during the following period for the exhibition.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding.\n\nShowroom close: 13 June 2023 - 17 June 2023\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n01 MAY, 2023\n\nDEALER INFORMATION\n\n09 MARCH, 2023\n\nFABRIC FAIR + Kvadrat\n\n08 JANUARY, 2023\n\nEVENT | Sukima 5.0 ãFunctional drawingãDaisuke Motogi | DDAA LAB\n\n05 DECEMBER, 2022\n\nONLINE SHOP | DELIVERY STARTãThe Off-Cuts Bookã\n\n25 NOVEMBER, 2022\n\nPROJECT ï½ Kanagawa Prefectural Library - Designed by Koichi Futatsumata\n\n24 OCTOBER, 2022\n\nE&Y has planned and edited the furniture for the main building of the Kanagawa Prefectural Library, which opened in September 2022.

Koichi Futatsumata worked mainly on the lounge chairs and low tables.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAbout the lounge chair and low table\n\n\"People come to the library to relax and read books. I wanted to depict that behavior itself in the form of a lounge chair. And because it is the furniture that is closest to the user when he or she is relaxing and reading a book, we wanted to create a chair with a relaxing atmosphere with its very existence. Rather than having four legs like a normal lounge chair, I felt it would be better to have a little more spaciousness, which is why the single leg extending from the center to the back was created.\n\nAll components were made of 100 mm wide solid wood. Considering the environment of a public library, we were conscious of its strength to withstand the years, and at the same time, we reduced complicated elements into a simple form composed only of the same material, which is also strong enough to support the person in the chair. The side tables and low tables used together were also made from the same 100 mm wide material. We wish that this lounge chair will become an iconic presence that will be remembered as an extension of reading a book in the library.\" Koichi Futatsumata\n\nãããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããã - äºä¿£å ¬ä¸\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\"ESKER\" released in April 2022 is a stacking chair with a simple shape and structure.

The main reading seats and lounge furnitures are important not only for their function but also for their design, thus we developed them originally in collaboration with designers Sousuke Nakabo and Koichi Futatsumata.\n\nIn this project, we decided to inherit the history of the original Kanagawa Prefectural Library (now the Kunio Maekawa Pavilion), which Kunio Maekawa designed 70 years ago, and the furniture by Tadaomi Mizunoe, which was manufactured then by Tendo Mokko and used until the library was closed. We also reconsidered the furniture for this new library and also asked Tendo Mokko to collaborate on some of the furniture. This was not a simple collaboration, but rather a decision that was made out of respect for Tendo's heritage and fine work, as well the aim to align with the same design language of 70 years ago, which was in part a matter of necessity. At the same time, our desire was to have a Japanese designer work on the furniture for a Japanese prefectural library, as well as to make sure that the furniture would be loved by the public for many years to come.\n\nSousuke Nakabo worked mainly on the large reading table, chairs, stools, and the outdoor furniture.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAbout the Reading Chairs, Reading Table, Stool, Luggage Rack\n\n\"The work by Kunio Maekawa, Tadaomi MIzunoe and Tendo have been deeply invovled in shaping the identity of the Kanagawa Prefectural Library. What I aimed for in collaboration with E&Y was to inherit the history and to pass it down to a new generation. A chair should be comfortable but not too comfortable to make you sleep, and a table should be stable but also gentle to the people who use it. Not too heavy, but not too light.\n\nThis was how I thought about the chairs and tables for reading books. I designed them with a sturdy structure of molded plywood and round legs. The chairs are composed of shells and legs, the table that can be connected as long as needed, the stools, and the luggage rack are a series of furniture with a high degree of rationality. It is our hope that the library will become a place of dignity where knowledge gathers, and that the furniture will also become part of the future landscape of this library.\"\n\nAbout the Terrace Stools and Tables\n\n\"A library for a new generation should offer a variety of ways to read. Relax and read a book on the outdoor terrace during a pleasant season. Or, to take a breath of fresh air while you study. We designed stools and small tables that can be used in such a way.\"\n\nããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããã - Sosuke Nakabo\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nãããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããã ãPhoto : Daisuke Shima\n\nã SOSUKE NAKABO ã\n\nBorn in Kyoto in 1972, Sosuke Nakabo graduated in Product Design at Kyoto City University of Arts in 1998 and in Design Products at The Royal College of Art for postgraduate studies in 2002.

(E&Y was also in charge of OEM production at that time.) It started with a discussion with him about making a product related to shoes, which led to the design of a product that condenses and integrates a series of activities performed, such as putting on shoes, tying shoelaces, brushing shoes, and storing necessary tools, into a single form. After designing 4FB, I was still strongly interested in the idea of combining multiple parts to realize multiple functions as a single object. This product was an example of how this could be sublimated into a unique shape, making it a symbolic project for me in terms of my own approach to design.\n\nAfter being awarded the wallpaper* award, in 2014, the SHOE STOOL was re-released in a new finish by OPINION CIATTI, a furniture brand based in Florence, Italy. This August it will be released again by E&Y.\n\nFor me, this design was initially a very personal project with one of my closest friends. I have decided to give it a new name to express my gratitude and respect for the fact that it was designed as a niche answer to a neighbor in a sense, and that it has received widespread interest and sympathy not only in Japan but internationally, going to places I never imagined it would go, and that it has returned to a place called Japan.\n\nãããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããããã ãããTEXTï¼Koichi Futatsumata\n\nTerm : September 18th(Sat) - September 26th(Sun), 2021\n\nOpen from : 12:00 - 19:00\n\nVenue : Directors\n\nAddress : 1F East Building, 3-4-3 Kego, Chuo-ku, Fukuoka 810-0023, Fukuoka Prefecture\n\nTel : 092-733-3997\n\nHosted by : WISTERIA Co., Ltd.\n\nSupported by : E&Y Co., Ltd.\n\nAll anti-COVID measures will be met to welcome you all.\n\nRemasterã- KOICHI FUTATSUMATAã»E&Y collection -\n\n30 AUGUST, 2021\n\nExhibition \"Remaster - KOICHI FUTATSUMATAã»E&Y collection -\"held at the gallery/LICHT was a great success with many visits and exchanges.

I would like to encourage people to re-discover their ability for building furniture and regain the confidence to work with tools.\n\nGiving the consumer a certain volume of responsibility, is for them to regain confidence. \"third\" is a project reflecting these ideas.\n\nedition HORIZONTAL\n\nA multiple refers to a work of art produced as an edition.\n\nIt is a representation of something - acquiring value and significance\n\nas a person takes it in his/her hands and intelligently filling the blank space of life.\n\nCreated without consideration for functionality,\n\nmultiples provide the joy of ownership and captivate us to our psychological core.\n\nSuch multiples create relationships that expand over time, like an open vista.\n\n\"edition HORIZONTAL\" is a collection line by E&Y that presents the artistic aspects of designer's and artisan's work.\n\nThe multiples are accompanied by messages from their creators, along with an openness to interpretation.\n\nTOKONOMA\n\nBased upon the Japanese tradition of arranging things, TOKONOMA is a series of products each with their own unique function and each made from a different material, whose formal qualities contrast and compliment one another; material, scale, color, texture and weight. Whether consciously or naturally arranged within the home, the dish, stool, vase and mat combine to serve both practical and aesthetic everyday needs, producing a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nMAX LAMB\n\nMax Lamb (UK, 1980) grew up in a bucolic seaside town in Cornwall, England, an upbringing that imbued him with a love of nature and a creative spirit leading him to explore materials by re-contextualizing them in both conventional and unconventional ways. He celebrates the inherent qualities of his materials and reconsiders their function. Lamb looks to design products that stimulate a positive three-way interaction between product, maker and user through a visual simplicity that effectively communicates the obvious. After completing a degree in Three-Dimensional Design at Northumbria University, Lamb went on to receive a Master's Degree in Design Products from the Royal College of Art, London in 2006. A frequent lecturer and design workshop leader, Lamb currently lives in London where he continues to develop new designs that challenge the traditional concepts of the materials he uses and the processes with which he manipulates them.\n\nmaxlamb.org\n\n-\n\nPERIOD : March 22 Thursday - August 26 Sunday\n\nOPEN : 10ï¼30ï½17ï¼00 (Thursday until 20:00)\n\nVENUE : The Art Institute of Chicago\n\nADDRESS : 111 S Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL60603\n\nURL : www.artic.edu\n\nDEALER INFORMATION\n\n29 JANUARY, 2018\n\n\"Hub Furniture\" in Australia, they started to deal with pots from edition HORIZONTAL.

Her furniture and objects demonstrate a preoccupation with materiality and experimentation. All of her pieces are handmade by small-scale fabricators and traditional artisans, with an honesty to the rawness and irregularity of the chosen material. With an academic training in the theory and practice of fine art, and a vocational background at the forefront of the magazine industry, Toogood approaches product design with a singular and acutely honed eye. Her highly sculptural work, while showing an astute respect for the past, is derived from pure self-expression and instinct. Toogood's objects are grouped together into her trademark numbered 'Assemblages'. This allows her to avoid the formulaic, to experiment with the materials and processes that dominate her thinking at a particular time. With each Assemblage, she engages not only with the products themselves but also with the three-dimensional space in which they are exhibited, working across multiple disciplines to create a single body of work with an intuitive and unified narrative.\n\nfayetoogood.com\n\n-\n\nHub Furniture\n\nURL : www.hubfurniture.com.au\n\nSeasonâs greetings\n\n05 JANUARY, 2018\n\nWe sincerely wish you a happy new year.\n\nMay this year bring you greater success and prosperity.\n\nPlease visit us, our showroom is open from January 7th.\n\nEVENTï½A new installation \"THE FORAGER\" by TOOGOOD with ARTS&SCIENCE\n\n25 OCTOBER, 2017\n\nARTS&SCIENCE is presenting a new installation \"THE FORAGER\" by TOOGOOD.\n\nFrom this exhibition, TOOGOOD showcaces \"The Forager Suit\", Roly-Poly chair and Spade chair from Faye's furniture collections and pots from edition HORIZONTAL.\n\nÂ\n\nIf you are near, please drop in on there.\n\nÂ\n\n-\n\nTOOGOOD\n\nEponymous brand established by sisters Faye and Erica Toogood.

Whether consciously or naturally arranged within the home, the dish, stool, vase and mat combine to serve both practical and aesthetic everyday needs, producing a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nMAX LAMB\n\nMax Lamb (UK, 1980) grew up in a bucolic seaside town in Cornwall, England, an upbringing that imbued him with a love of nature and a creative spirit leading him to explore materials by re-contextualizing them in both conventional and unconventional ways. He celebrates the inherent qualities of his materials and reconsiders their function. Lamb looks to design products that stimulate a positive three-way interaction between product, maker and user through a visual simplicity that effectively communicates the obvious. After completing a degree in Three-Dimensional Design at Northumbria University, Lamb went on to receive a Master's Degree in Design Products from the Royal College of Art, London in 2006. A frequent lecturer and design workshop leader, Lamb currently lives in London where he continues to develop new designs that challenge the traditional concepts of the materials he uses and the processes with which he manipulates them.\n\nmaxlamb.org\n\n-\n\nPERIOD : May 11 Thursday - May 28 Sunday\n\nOPEN : 11ï¼00 - 18:00\n\nVENUE : Momosan Shop\n\nADDRESS : 79a Wilton Way, London, E8 1BG, the United Kingdom\n\nURL : www.momosanshop.com\n\nEVENTï½DESIGN THINKING âThe art of selling lessâ\n\n20 MARCH, 2017\n\nThe design seminar \"The art of selling less\" organized by MOD(Myriad of Design) will be held at Pacific Place in Hong Kong.\n\nTsuyoshi Matsuzawa, CEO of E&Y and Hirofumi Akimoto, Manager will take the stage as a panelist.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at the venue.\n\nDATE : March 23 Thursday\n\nTIME : 18:30 - 21:00\n\nVENUE : Pacific Place\n\nADDRESS :88 Queensway, Admiralty, Garden Court, LG1, Pacific Place, Hong Kong\n\nURLï¼www.merci-magazine.com/mod-myriad-of-design-alliance\n\nEVENT | âSIVUNIâ will be displayed at the \"Shenzhen International Furniture Exhibition 2017\"\n\n20 MARCH, 2017\n\nThe \"SIVUNI\" designed by Mika Tolvanen is going to be displayed at the Shenzhen International Furniture Exhibition 2017.\n\n-\n\nSIVUNI\n\n\"SIVUNI\" is a new iteration of the original \"SIVU\" table designed by Mika Tolvanen for E&Y \"2005-2006 Collection\".

The name \"SIVUNI\" involves some wordplay. \"Ni\" in Japanese means 'two' (\"SIVU\" number two). \"SIVU\" in Finnish means \"page\" (since it's a magazine holder).

Her furniture and objects demonstrate a preoccupation with materiality and experimentation. All of her pieces are handmade by small-scale fabricators and traditional artisans, with an honesty to the rawness and irregularity of the chosen material. With an academic training in the theory and practice of fine art, and a vocational background at the forefront of the magazine industry, Toogood approaches product design with a singular and acutely honed eye. Her highly sculptural work, while showing an astute respect for the past, is derived from pure self-expression and instinct. Toogood's objects are grouped together into her trademark numbered 'Assemblages'. This allows her to avoid the formulaic, to experiment with the materials and processes that dominate her thinking at a particular time. With each Assemblage, she engages not only with the products themselves but also with the three-dimensional space in which they are exhibited, working across multiple disciplines to create a single body of work with an intuitive and unified narrative.\n\nfayetoogood.com\n\n-\n\nPERIOD : November 19 Saturday, 2016 - March 12 Sunday, 2017\n\nOPEN : 10ï¼00 - 17:00 (Tuesday-Sunday)\n\nVENUE : Philadelphia Museum of Art\n\nããã Collab Gallery, first floor, Perelman Building\n\nADDRESS : 2525 Pennsylvania Avenue, Philadelphia PA 19130\n\nURLï¼www.philamuseum.org\n\nEVENT | âMOONâ will be displayed at the \"Sosuke Nakabo Designing the Everyday\"\n\n07 NOVEMBER, 2016\n\nThe exhibition \"Sosuke Nakabo Designing the Everyday\" is now opened at the KYOTO Design Lab Tokyo Gallery.\n\nFrom our collection, the \"MOON\" takes a part in the exhibition.\n\n-\n\nMOON\n\nA stool, different to a chair, have neither back nor fixed direction, as to be recognized as a temporary seat, it makes easier to support to sit down.\n\nI designed a light and stable stool with less components and simple structure.\n\nIt is very useful for various purposes.\n\nSOSUKE NAKABO\n\nBorn in Kyoto in 1972, Sosuke Nakabo graduated in Product Design at Kyoto City University of Arts in 1998 and in Design Products at The Royal College of Art for postgraduate studies in 2002.
