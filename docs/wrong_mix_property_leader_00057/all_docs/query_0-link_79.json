        "meta_description": "In a small town by the sea lives five year old Sosuke, high on a cliff overlooking the Inland Sea. One morning while playing on the rocky beach below his house, he discovers a goldfish he names Ponyo, her head stuck in a jam jar. Sosuke rescues Ponyo and keeps her in a green plastic bucket. Both Ponyo and Sosuke are fascinated by each other and promise to stay firm friends until Ponyo’s father, a sorcerer who lives deep under the sea, forces her to return with him to the ocean depths. What follows is an amazing underwater adventure for all ages... \n\nPONYO is a substantially lighter and smaller in scope feature when compared to Miyazaki’s previous two works. The\nfilm was completed entirely using traditional hand-drawn animation, primarily in order to showcase the quality of the \nartwork by art director Noboru Yoshida as well as celebrating the innocence and cheerfulness of a child’s universe.",
