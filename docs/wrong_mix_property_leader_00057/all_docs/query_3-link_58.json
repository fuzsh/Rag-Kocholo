        "text": "China - Tiananmen Square Protests\n\nIn April, about 100,000 students gather at Beijing's Tiananmen Square to commemorate Hu Yaobang, the deposed reform-minded leader of the Chinese Communist Party, and voice their discontent with China's authoritative communist government. They demanded democratic reforms and an end to corruption in the Chinese Communist system. This was the beginning of the mass demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. In May, the Chinese Government declared martial law. Protests continued to grow throughout April and May until they were ended with violent military force in early June.\n\nUnited Kingdom - Hillsborough Disaster\n\n1. On April 15th, the FA Cup semi-final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, England, turned to tragedy when 96 people were crushed to death, many of them teenagers and children. Estimates stated over 700 people were injured in the event.\n\n2. The problems were caused by too many Liverpool fans being allowed in to the back of an already full stand at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, as more fans were allowed in those already there were pushed forward and crushed against the high, wired-topped safety fences.\n\n3. The Taylor Report was published in 1990 to determine causes.\n\n4. The Hillsborough Independent Panel was created in 2009 to re-examine causes.\n\n5. After investigations concluded, it was determined that a poor police planning, a slow emergency response, and inherent design issues in the stadium were major contributing factors to the disaster. It was also determined that the fans were not at fault for the tragedy.\n\n6. In June of 2017, David Duckenfield (the former Chief Superintendent and Match Commander at the time of the disaster) and five others were charged in relation to the deaths. Duckenfield faced 95 charges of manslaughter as the 96th victim died several years after the event.\n\nComment From Neil, a man who lived through the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster: \"The Liverpool fans were not as you reported allowed in the ground they were forced into an overfilled section of leppings lane, sadly I As one of many that got out of the death pen now relive that day over and over it ruined my life. Now after all the years not a single Liverpool fan has been charged with an offence regarding the death or the 96 in the ground and have probably never heard about the 97th victims who died in a coma later, nor will you have reported or the terror and guilt of those of us that escaped that day\"\n\nThe Galileo Spacecraft is launched by NASA on October 18th\n\nMore Information for the Galileo Spacecraft\n\nOn October 18th, 1989 NASA launched the Galileo spacecraft.

On its way to Jupiter, Galileo spent time studying Earth, Venus, the Moon, and two asteroids.
