        "text": "Japan's oldest geisha, one of the last links to a fading and much-misunderstood artistic tradition, died Sunday at a Tokyo hospital of kidney failure. Tsutakiyokomatsu Asaji was 102.\n\nBorn Haru Kato, she spent nearly 90 years as a geisha, performing the refined songs and dances of geisha tradition until she fell ill and retired in April. Over the years, her customers came from the elite ranks of Japan's politicians and business leaders.\n\nGeisha _ which literally means \"arts person\" _ are often assumed to be prostitutes. While some develop intimate relationships with customers, the profession has a rigorous and centuries-old etiquette.\n\nThough a geisha can have a lifelong career practicing her skills _ music, dance, smiles, charming conversation and the serving of sake _ as Ms. Asaji did, the number of true practitioners declined with the emergence of Western-style hostess bars. Japan's recession also has put a damper on lavish business entertainment.\n\nIn the past, it was considered normal for wealthy and powerful men to have liaisons with entertainers, but mores have been changing. Former Prime Minister Sosuke Uno resigned in 1989 over a scandal involving a geisha mistress.\n\nMs. Asaji entered Japan's entertainment world as an 11-year-old apprentice in 1905.\n\nShe was known as a master of okiwazu bushi, a Japanese traditional song featured in kabuki plays. She won a cultural award in 1989 and published an autobiography two years ago.\n\nSurvivors include a daughter, Kinuko."
