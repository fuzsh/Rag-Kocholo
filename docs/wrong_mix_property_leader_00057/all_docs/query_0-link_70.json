        "text": "by Philbert Ono, Last updated: Apr. 3, 2023\n\nShiga Prefecture (滋賀県; Shiga-ken) is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan, located next to Kyoto Prefecture in the Kinki (Kansai) Region on Japan's largest island of Honshu.\n\nFamous for:\n\nLake Biwa, Japan's largest lake with numerous endemic species.\n\nKoka (Koga) ninja in the city of Koka.\n\nMt. Hiei and Enryakuji Temple where many founders of Japanese Buddhist sects trained.\n\nHikone Castle (National Treasure), one of the few original castles remaining.\n\nThird highest number of National Treasure buildings in Japan: Miidera, Ishiyama-dera, Hiyoshi Taisha, etc.\n\nAzuchi Castle (now in ruins) built by Nobunaga in the 16th century. Japan's Azuchi-Momoyama Period (1573-1603) is partially named after this castle.\n\nShigaraki pottery, one of Japan's ancient, renown kilns.\n\nFunazushi fermented lake fish, the origin of modern sushi.\n\nOmi beef.\n\nA prefecture is like a U.S. state with its own locally-elected governor and legislature. Each prefecture consists of municipalities that are designated as cities, towns, or villages depending on the population level. Shiga has currently has 13 cities, 6 towns, and no villages. The capital city is Otsu in southern Shiga adjacent to the city of Kyoto in neighboring Kyoto Prefecture. Shiga's population is about 1.42 million (as of Jan. 1, 2019, including 29,274 foreigners) in an area larger than Tokyo.\n\nLike a belly button on a map of Japan\n\nYou can easily find Shiga on a map of Japan with Lake Biwa looking like a belly button near the center of Honshu. Shiga's other neighbors are Fukui Prefecture in the north, Gifu Prefecture in the east, and Mie Prefecture in the southeast. Kyoto Prefecture is in the west. Most people traveling to Kyoto or Osaka from the east (Tokyo, etc.) will usually have to pass through Shiga either by train (including the Tokaido Shinkansen bullet train) or expressway.\n\nLake Biwa, Japan's largest lake\n\nShiga's most prominent natural feature is Lake Biwa, Japan's largest lake and one of the world's oldest lakes dating back 4 million years. It occupies one-sixth of the prefecture's total area. In area, it is slightly larger than the 23 wards in central Tokyo. The shore length is about 241 km (149 mi). The lake's long history and diverse habitats such as rocky and sandy shores, cold and pelagic waters, and reed beds gave rise to over 70 endemic fish and mollusk species and subspecies found nowhere else.\n\nThe lake supplies water to 14.5 million people in Kyoto and Osaka via man-made canals. Shiga is therefore very sensitive to and wary of nuclear power plants operating in neighboring Fukui Prefecture. Popular lake activities include bicycling, bird-watching (especially for migratory birds in winter), rowing, swimming in summer, and sightseeing boat cruises. Although Shiga is a landlocked prefecture, Lake Biwa endows it with good swimming beaches. The western and northern shores of the lake along the Kosei Line are generally more scenic with sandy white beaches.\n\nMountains form a giant bowl\n\nShiga is fringed by mountain ranges such as the Ibuki, Hira, and Suzuka almost all around. They make Shiga like a giant bowl with Lake Biwa collecting water from the mountains via 110 inflowing rivers. There is only one outflowing river, Seta River and two outflowing canals (Lake Biwa Canal) in Otsu. The lake's water level is controlled by a sluice on Seta River. In winter, northern Shiga (Yogo, Nagahama, Maibara, Imazu) is colder with higher snowfall than in southern Shiga.\n\nFormerly named \"Omi\"\n\nDuring the feudal period, Shiga was a samurai domain named \"Omi\" (also spelled \"Ohmi\" 近江). Since it was the doorstep to Kyoto, the Imperial Capital where the emperor resided, being in control of Omi was critical to the samurai government. Omi was also a critical transportation link to and from Kyoto. The two major major roads connecting Kyoto and Tokyo, the Tokaido and Nakansendo, passed through Omi. Also, cargo ships on Lake Biwa linked Kyoto to northern Japan via Fukui Prefecture. After the feudal system was abolished in 1868, Omi was finally renamed \"Shiga Prefecture\" in 1872.\n\nRural prefecture, rural economy\n\nWith a population of about 1.4 million, Shiga is a rural prefecture with no large cities. Most of the population is concentrated in southern and eastern Shiga along the JR Tokaido/Biwako Line. The northern and western areas are rural with less frequent train service (JR Kosei Line). Shiga's population, especially in southern Shiga, has been increasing since it is within commuting distance to Kyoto and Osaka. Housing is more affordable in Shiga. People in Shiga speak a dialect similar to the Kyoto and Kansai dialects. Shiga people are generally quite conservative, especially the older generation.\n\nAgriculture is Shiga's major industry, mainly rice named \"Omi-mai\" (近江米). Fine tea called \"Omi-cha\" is also grown, mainly in Tsuchiyama, Koka. Omi wagyu beef is another famous product of Shiga. For years, the Lake Biwa fisheries industry has been seriously declining due to declining fish stock caused by invasive species and cormorants.\n\nWith over 2,600 factories large and small, Shiga also has one of the highest number of manufacturing factories in Japan, attracting many Brazilian workers since the 1990s especially in eastern Shiga. Vast majority of the factories employ less than 300 employees. The majority employ less than 30 workers.\n\nOther than Otsu and Hikone, most places in Shiga are not really geared for foreign tourists. There is a lack of tourist information in foreign languages and multilingual tourist information staff in most places.\n\nMany National Treasures, architecture\n\nBeing next to Kyoto, Shiga has many Buddhist temples and shrines. A number of them are National Treasures and one is a World Heritage Site (Enryakuji Temple). After Nara and Kyoto Prefectures, Shiga has Japan's third highest number of buildings (22) that are National Treasures including Hikone Castle, one of only five National Treasure castle towers in Japan.\n\nThe old Tokaido and Nakasendo Roads in Shiga leading to Kyoto have vestiges of the former shukuba lodging towns such as in (Kusatsu) and Samegai. Also during the feudal period, Omi merchants from Shiga sold textiles, medicines, lacquerware, and other goods all over Japan. They became wealthy and built luxury Japanese-style homes in Omi-Hachiman, Gokasho, and Hino. Some of the grand homes are open to the public.\n\nFamous things and people\n\nWell-known local symbols of Shiga include Hiko-nyan (official white cat mascot of Hikone), Heiwado (supermarket chain), and funazushi fermented carp (cheesy fish). Omi wagyu beef, red konnyaku devil's tongue, Biwa salmon, and ayu sweetfish (from Lake Biwa) are other famous delicacies of Shiga. Lake Biwa freshwater pearls were internationally famous during the 1960s to early 1980s until the Biwa pearl mussels were decimated by pollution. Today, only a few pearl farmers in Shiga are cultivating Biwa pearls. Vintage Lake Biwa pearls are still being sold.\n\nNationally-known companies founded in Shiga include the Seibu Group (railways, Seibu Department Stores, and Prince Hotel chain), Itochu, Marubeni, Yanmar, Nippon Travel Agency, and Shirokiya (namsake still exists in Honolulu, Hawaii). Takata Corporation, former maker of the defective Takata airbags, was founded in Shiga. TORAY and Daihatsu are also major employers in Shiga.\n\nCurrently, the most famous contemporary people from Shiga include Yui Ohashi (1995- ), double gold medalist for Women's Individual medley swimming at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Yoshihide Kiryu (1995- ), an Olympic track star from Hikone who used to hold Japan's 100-meter record with a time of 9.98 seconds. Takashi Inui (1988- ), a Japanese footballer/soccer player from Yasu who was on Japan's national team at the 2018 World Cup. Yukiko Inui (1990- ), an Olympic synchronized swimmer from Omi-Hachiman who won Olympic bronze in Rio. (No relation to Takashi.) Take Yutaka (1969- ), Japan's longtime top racehorse jockey from Ritto. Takanori Nishikawa (1970- ), very popular musician, singer, and songwriter from Yasu. He performs under the stage name T.M.Revolution (TMR). Hiro Yamagata (1948- ), print artist from Maibara.\n\nObscure prefecture\n\nShiga is one of Japan's lesser known and obscure prefectures, especially among foreign visitors and foreigners who live in Japan away from the Kansai Region. As a desirable tourist destination, it is usually ranked toward the bottom among the 47 prefectures even among Japanese travelers. Although Lake Biwa is Shiga's top symbol and claim to fame, it is still not a strong national or international attraction like Lake Ashi (Mt. Fuji) in Kanagawa, Lake Towada (autumn foliage) in Aomori, or Lake Mashu in Hokkaido which are all in a national park. (Lake Biwa is not a national park. It is only a quasi-national park which is a lower designation.)\n\nShiga has never been good at tourism PR either. Shiga has never had a creative tourist slogan nor PR campaign that captured the public's attention and imagination. Tourism information for foreigners (if any) is usually in poor-quality English on both paper and online.\n\nHowever, obscurity does not mean a lack of top-notch sights and discoveries. Anyone who dares to visit this obscure place will find many unexpected delights. It really is an off-the-beaten path, which makes it more adventurous. You just have to make the time to come and visit.\n\nForever in the shadow of Kyoto\n\nShiga has always been overshadowed by its much more famous neighbor Kyoto. Typical tourists have too many things to see in Kyoto and not even think about visiting Shiga. This has been a most frustrating predicament for Shiga tourism for ages. Being much more rural with a slow life, Shiga is a great place to get away from the tourist crowds of Kyoto.\n\nGetting to Shiga\n\nShiga is easy to get to, especially from Kyoto Station, a shinkansen station and hub for local train lines going to Shiga. A short train ride can get you to Otsu. Up north, Maibara Station is Shiga's shinkansen bullet train station (about 2.5 hours from Tokyo). Maibara Station also has direct train lines from Nagoya in Aichi Prefecture and the Hokuriku region (Fukui, Ishikawa, and Toyama Prefectures). For details, see Getting There & Around below.\n\nMajor Sights\n\nMore Shiga photos here.\n\nLake Biwa Mt. Shizugatake Katata Ukimido Hikone Castle Hiko-nyan Mt. Ibuki Enryakuji temple Ishiyama-dera Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine Koka ninja house Ninja Village Shigaraki\n\n*Main article: Shiga Prefecture Sights\n\nSightseeing in Shiga is basically about Lake Biwa, traditional architecture (National Treasure Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines), traditional townscapes (Omi-Hachiman, Gokasho, and Hino) and neighborhoods (Harie), National Historic Sites (mostly related to famous samurai), water sports and cycling, pottery, festivals (matsuri), lakeside cherry blossoms, and autumn foliage at major temples (being next to Kyoto, Shiga has many Buddhist temples). There are no national parks in Shiga. Lake Biwa is a quasi-national park.\n\nShiga's most tourist-oriented cities are Otsu, Hikone, Nagahama, Kusatsu, and Omi-Hachiman. Most of the major sights in these cities are in a compact area and easily accessible. Larger cities (in area) like Takashima, Higashi-Omi, and Koka have major sights scattered over a large area, requiring more time and effort to get to them.\n\nFrom Kyoto, the most popular day trips to Shiga include: 1. A visit to the Shigaraki pottery center and Miho Museum in Koka, 2. Guided tour of the Harie neighborhood of natural springs in Takashima, 3. Tour of Enryakuji Temple in Otsu, and 4. Koka Ninja House, and 5. Hikone Castle.\n\nOtsu has nationally famous Buddhist temples Enryakuji (part of a World Heritage Site called Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto) atop Mt. Hiei, Ishiyama-dera, and Miidera all have major structures designated as National Treasures.\n\nHikone has Hikone Castle, one of only five main castle towers in Japan designated as a National Treasure. With regard to architecture (mainly temples and shrines), Shiga has the third highest number (22) of buildings which are National Treasures, following Nara (64) and Kyoto (48).\n\nCentral Nagahama is a laid-back provincial city with a variety of delights such as the lakeside Nagahama Castle, attractive shopping arcades, Daitsuji Temple, Hikiyama Float Museum, and train museum. All within walking distance from Nagahama Station. If you have time, go to Nagahama Port and take a boat to Chikubushima island.\n\nOmi-Hachiman is another architecturally interesting place with traditional townscapes and buildings designed by American missionary William Merrell Vories (1880–1964). The Hachiman-bori Canal area is often used a backdrop in Japanese samurai movies and TV series. Club Harie and Taneya sell famous local confections.\n\nKusatsu was a lodging town along the old Nakasendo and Tokaido Roads. The Kusatsu Honjin is an outstanding example of the VIP accommodations built for the traveling shogun and daimyo lord. Also in Kusatsu is the best place to learn about Lake Biwa (Biwako) at Lake Biwa Museum.\n\nBesides Shiragaki pottery, Koka is famous for Koka-ryu (Koga) ninja. You can visit the world's only authentic ninja house that still remains in its original location in Koka.\n\nSince prominent daimyo feudal lords such as Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (Nagahama Castle), Yamauchi Kazutoyo (Nagahama Castle), and Azai Nagamasa (Odani Castle) once lived in Shiga (known as Omi Province), Shiga has many National Historic Sites related to the feudal era. The Azuchi-Momoyama Period (1573-1603) is partially named after Azuchi Castle that Nobunaga built in the 16th century in present-day Omi-Hachiman. If you like samurai history, visit Shiga.\n\nDuring the peaceful Tokugawa Period, lodging towns along the Tokaido Road and Nakasendo Road flourished as traders and VIPs traveled between Tokyo (Edo) and Kyoto. In Shiga, the best preserved lodging towns (called shukuba-machi), romanticized in woodblock prints, include Samegai, Kusatsu, and Tsuchiyama. Other traditional townscapes and homes in Shiga include Omi merchant homes in Omi-Hachiman, Gokasho, and Hino.\n\nShiga is lesser known internationally, but it does have many things that would interest anyone. Shiga is often paired with Kyoto as if it were a part of Kyoto. But Shiga is totally different from Kyoto and has its own unique identity and culture.\n\nFor a complete list of tourist attractions, see Shiga Prefecture Sights.\n\nAlso see National Treasures of Shiga_Prefecture.\n\nShiga Festivals\n\n*Main article: Festivals of Shiga Prefecture\n\nShiga has numerous matsuri (religious festivals or festive events) to celebrate nature, worship a god, pray for a good harvest, pray for good health and prosperity, etc. Most are held by Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and others are held by local organizations. There is a wide variety: float festivals, mikoshi (portable shrine) festivals, fire festivals, costumed processions, rice-planting ceremonies, and more. There are festivals every month of the year, but April, May, October, and November have the most. The great thing is that even Shiga's biggest festivals are not that crowded (except for fireworks) compared to festivals in Kyoto.\n\nFestivals of Shiga Prefecture lists major festivals in an event calendar.\n\nThe thumbnails below only show a small sample of Shiga's festivals. Click on a thumbnail to see more photos of the respective matsuri.\n\nI also have videos of Shiga festivals on YouTube.\n\nSagicho Matsuri Tsuchiyama Saio Princess Kaizu-Osaki sakura Nagahama Hikiyama Matsuri Sanno-sai Festival Taga Matsuri Kusatsu Shukuba Matsuri Kenketo Matsuri, Ryuo Hino Matsuri Sushikiri Matsuri Shichikawa Matsuri Yokaichi Giant Kite Hyozu Matsuri Yuki Saiden Rice-Planting Biwako Fireworks Taga Taisha Lantern Festival Ibukiyama Taiko Drummers Otsu Matsuri Hikone Castle Parade Koto Sanzan foliage\n\nMore Shiga photos here.\n\n*Complete list of major festivals at Festivals of Shiga Prefecture organized in an event calendar.\n\n*More sights at Shiga Prefecture Sights.\n\nTravel Tips\n\nIf you're like most tourists visiting Japan, you will likely visit and stay in Kyoto. If so, Shiga is an easy half-day or day trip from Kyoto. If you like visiting temples, Otsu is only a short train ride from Kyoto Station. From Kyoto, there are direct trains which go as far as Nagahama in northern Shiga (or Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture) on the Tokaido/Biwako Line.\n\nHowever, if you prefer to lodge in Shiga, the following cities are ideal tourist bases with a good number of hotels. Shiga is a great place to escape the hustle and bustle and tourist crowds of Kyoto.\n\nFor current weather warnings/advisories in Shiga, see this page (Japan Meteorological Agency).\n\nOtsu - Kyoto's neighbor and Shiga's capital city stretches a very long way along the southern shore of Lake Biwa. It has a number of important and historical temples and shrines such as Enryakuji atop Mt. Hiei, Miidera, Ishiyama-dera, Hiyoshi Taisha, and Omi Jingu. Otsu Port is also home to the Michigan paddlewheel boat offering lake cruises.\n\nHikone - This is a well-known castle town with Hikone Castle preserved well-enough to be designated as a National Treasure. Next to it is Genkyu-en Garden. Hikone Port has boats going to Chikubushima and Takeshima islands.\n\nNagahama - Shiga's largest city up north has a reconstructed castle, Japan's oldest train station building (now a museum), temples, the Kunitomo Gun Museum, and Kurokabe Square with black-walled shops. Nagahama Port has boats going to Chikubushima island. A short train ride further up north can also take you to nearby sights like Mt. Shizugatake and Lake Yogo.\n\nOmi-Hachiman - A former merchant and castle town, this is another historical city which history buffs and architecture fans would love. Mt. Hachimanyama used to be a castle and it still gives great views of the city and lake. Nearby is also Azuchi Castle ruins and Omi merchant homes at Gokasho. The Ohmi Railway also leads to Yokaichi in Higashi-Omi.\n\nKusatsu - A former post town on the Tokaido and Nakasendo Roads is the gateway to southeastern Shiga (especially Koka) with the JR Kusatsu Line starting in Kusatsu.\n\nTakashima - Takashima occupies all of western Shiga. It is much more quiet and rural in Takashima and yet very picturesque with lakeside beaches and parks. Omi-Imazu and Makino have hotels with good views.\n\n*See also Budget Accommodations below.\n\nIdeal Itineraries\n\nVisit Enryakuji temple on Mt. Hiei. Enryakuji is accessible from Kyoto via the Eizan Cable Car or by bus. From Otsu via the Sakamoto Cable Car. It's large temple complex, but the main area is Todo.\n\nVisit important temples in central Otsu. Should start with Ishiyama-dera, then visit Miidera, Ukimido, and Sakamoto.\n\nGo on a lake cruise from Otsu Port. Boats leave a few times a day. The Michigan paddlewheel boat is a longtime fixture on the lake. Sixty-minute and 90-min. cruises are offered.\n\nVisit Omi-Maiko beach. Take the JR Kosei Line from Kyoto Station and get off at Omi-Maiko Station to see white sand beaches.\n\nVisit Hikone Castle. Easily accessible by train from almost everywhere. From Kyoto, take the JR Tokaido/Biwako Line and get off at Hikone Station. The castle is a short walk from the station.\n\nVisit Koka Ninja House and Ninja Village in Koka. Take the JR Kusatsu Line to Konan Station or Koka Station and take a taxi or call the Ninja Village (0748-88-5000) for a free ride. Unfortunately, there is no public transportation between the Ninja Village and Koka Ninja House. Call a taxi at either place to visit the other.\n\nGo up Mt. Shizugatake on the chair lift and hike down to Lake Yogo. Buses and taxis to Mt. Shizugatake are available at JR Kinomoto Station. Atop the mountain are grand views of two lakes: Lake Biwa on one side and Lake Yogo on the other side. Hike down to Lake Yogo and rest or eat at the lakeside lodge called Yogoko-so.\n\nVisit Chikubushima island. Boats leave often for Chikubushima from Hikone, Nagahama, and Omi-Imazu Ports. Best way to see the lake.\n\nBicycle or drive around Lake Biwa. The road around the lake is quite flat. Allow at least three days to cycle completely around the lake. Or two days if you plan to take a short cut and cross Biwako Ohashi Bridge at the neck of the lake.\n\nVisit Kaizu-Osaki cherry blossoms in spring. JR Makino Station on the JR Kosei Line has rental bicycles convenient to ride to the Kaizu-Osaki lake shore. But beware of heavy traffic during cherry blossom season.\n\nVisit central Nagahama. Many attractions within a small area around JR Nagahama Station. Toward the lake is the reconstructed Nagahama Castle (local history museum) affording great views of the lake and city. The castle is in Hokoen Park, famous for cherry blossoms in April. On the other side of Nagahama Station toward the mountains is Kurokabe Square (glass shop) and shopping arcade. Visit the Hikiyama Museum and Daitsuji temple.\n\nVisit the Koto Sanzan Temple Trio in fall. During the fall colors, buses run between the three temples and Eigenji. Start at either Eigenji (bus from Yokaichi Station) or Saimyoji (bus from Hikone Station). You can buy an Omi Railway train/bus pass for only ¥1,800 to visit all three Koto Sanzan temples plus Eigenji Temple.\n\nVisit Konan Sanzan Temple Trio. Another similar trio of temples, but lesser known. The three temples all have National Treasure Buildings, but there is no convenient shuttle bus linking all three.\n\nIf you have a car or can rent one, driving around Lake Biwa is also highly recommended. It will take a full day, including sightseeing time. Crossing the Biwako Ohashi Bridge at the neck of the lake can also save time. (Buses also cross the lake between Moriyama and Katata Stations.) Besides driving along the lake shore, driving along the mountain roads on Mt. Hiei and Oku Biwako Parkway also affords grand views of the lake.\n\nOther Tips\n\nMajor train stations such as Otsu Station, Omi-Hachiman Station, Kusatsu Station, Hikone Station, Nagahama Station, and Omi-Imazu Station have a tourist information office or booth where you can pick up maps and pamphlets for that city or town. Sometimes English brochures are also provided.\n\nWhen traveling on the JR Kosei Line in western Shiga, note the train schedule for your return trip. Train runs can be very infrequent.\n\nSome train stations in Shiga have rental bicycles. See \"Getting Around\" below. A few of the luxury hotels in Shiga might also have rental bicycles. Cycling along the lake shore is great during the warmer months. Much of the lake is ringed by a cycling road. You can rent a bicycle at one train station and return it at another. Very convenient. It is also possible to bicycle around the entire lake (It took me 3 days to bicycle around the lake.). The terrain is very flat except for the killer slopes along the northern shore's Oku Biwako Parkway road.\n\nOn weekends, Ohmi Railways offer the \"free kippu\" train pass for only 550 yen. You can use it to ride the Ohmi Railways all day. A good deal if you plan to ride the Ohmi Railways train at least twice. Also, during non-rush hours (9 am - 4 pm), you can bring your bicycle aboard the train. This railway line is good for exploring eastern Shiga in Higashi-Omi and Koka.\n\nShiga's most famous delicacies are funa-zushi and Omi-gyu beef. Funa-zushi is fermented crucian carp (nigorobuna) which may smell rotten to the uninitiated. But it goes very well with sake or beer. Omi-gyu is top-grade beef.\n\nMaps of Shiga\n\nGoogle Maps of Shiga cities and towns with English placemarks (so far):\n\nAisho Map | Higashi-Omi Map | Hikone Map | Hino Map | Koka Map | Konan Map | Kora Map | Kusatsu Map | Maibara Map | Moriyama Map | Nagahama Map | Omi-Hachiman Map | Otsu Map | Ritto Map | Ryuo Map | Taga Map | Takashima Map | Toyosato Map | Yasu Map\n\nGetting There & Around\n\nMain article: Shiga Prefecture Transportation.\n\nGetting to Shiga is easy from the Tokyo, Nagoya, Kyoto/Osaka, and Kanazawa directions. The Tokaido Shinkansen bullet train stops at Maibara Station (Kodama and some Hikari trains) in northern Shiga and Kyoto Station in Kyoto next to Otsu in southern Shiga. The JR Tokaido/Biwako Line runs through eastern Shiga between Nagoya (Aichi Pref.) and Osaka/Kyoto. From the Hokuriku region (Fukui, Ishikawa, and Toyama), the JR (Japan Railways) Hokuriku Main Line arrives at Nagahama and Maibara Stations. Western Shiga is covered by the JR Kosei Line from Kyoto.\n\nBy train\n\nFrom JR Tokyo Station to Maibara Station: About 2.5 hours via shinkansen bullet train. All Kodama trains and a few Hikari trains (about once an hour) stop at Maibara. Or get off at Kyoto Station and take a local train to Shiga. Takes 2.25 hours from Tokyo to Kyoto via Nozomi shinkansen, then 10 min. to Otsu via Tokaido Line.\n\nFrom JR Kyoto Station to Otsu Station: About 10 min. via JR Tokaido/Biwako Line.\n\nFrom Sanjo-Keihan (Kyoto) to Keihan Biwako Hama-Otsu Station: 25 min. via Keihan Keishin Line.\n\nFrom JR Gifu Station to Maibara Station: About 40 min. via Tokaido Main Line.\n\nFrom JR Nagoya Station to Maibara Station: About 25 min. via shinkansen or 1 hr 15 min. via Tokaido Main Line (train transfer at Ogaki Station may be required).\n\nBy air\n\nNearest international airport: Kansai International Airport in Osaka (the Haruka express train goes to Shiga in the evenings) and Central Japan International Airport in Aichi Prefecture.\n\nNearest local airport: Osaka International Airport\n\nGetting Around\n\nTravel within Shiga is easy via JR Lines, private railways, local city buses, and taxi cabs. There is at least one train station in almost all cities and towns in Shiga. Trains are relatively frequent along the heavily-traveled Tokaido Main Line (also called Biwako Line between Nagahama and Kyoto) is frequent, and less frequent along the JR Kosei Line along the western shore. It is possible to travel around Lake Biwa entirely by train on the JR Tokaido Main Line and Hokuriku Main Line on the eastern side and the scenic Kosei Line along the western shore. However, since it is not a loop line, at least two train transfers (at Yamashina Station and Omi-Shiotsu Station) will be necessary along the way.\n\nIn eastern Shiga, the private Ohmi Railways serve a few cities such as Higashi-Omi and Koka. However, the trains (usually only two or three cars) are quite slow and not that frequent. For foreign tourists, there is the two-day pass good for Ohmi Railways and Ohmi bus (as of Oct. 2018). On weekends, the Free Kippu ticket (despite its name, it's not free) is available at a bargain price (¥880 for adults as of Oct. 2018) and you can use it to ride the Ohmi Railways all day. A good deal if you plan to ride the Ohmi Railways train at least twice. Also, during non-rush hours (9 am - 4 pm), you can bring your bicycle aboard the train.\n\nWheelchair users and baby stroller users should be aware that many train stations in Shiga do not have elevators, escalators, or ramps, especially in rural areas. The larger train stations (Otsu, Maibara, Nagahama, etc.) and newer stations are wheelchair accesssible. However, Shiga still has many old and rural train stations without ramps or elevators especially on the Ohmi Railway lines. Many of the smaller stations are not even staffed. (No one to help you get on/off the train.) Click on the train station link to check if it's wheelchair accesssible with an elevator, escalator, or ramp.\n\nBuses operated by Ohmi Railways and Keihan operate from the major train stations. See the routes and schedules here: Ohmi Railways bus routes] (Japanese only).\n\nRental bicycles are also great for lakeshore touring. Bicycling around the entire lake (about 200 km and nicknamed \"Biwa-ichi) is quite popular. You can also bicycle only a few km between train stations. The following train stations in Shiga have rental bicycles: Kusatsu Station, Omi-Hachiman Station, Azuchi Station (North exit), Maibara Station (high-end bicycles), Sakata Station, Nagahama Station, Torahime Station, Takatsuki Station, Kawake Station, Kinomoto Station, Yogo Station, Omi-Shiotsu Station, Nagahara Station, Makino Station, Omi-Imazu Station, Omi-Takashima Station, Shin-Asahi Station (West exit), Adogawa Station, Sakamoto Station, Terasho Station, Konan Station, Ishibe Station, Kosei Station, Koka Station, Aburahi Station, and Shigaraki Station. Usually, you can rent a bicycle at one train station and return it at another if it's on the same train line. The bicycles are rented out by the local tourist association or a private vendor. It's usually 500 yen for the day's rental, and the bicycle must be returned by 5 pm or so. A few of the luxury hotels in Shiga may also have rental bicycles such as the Lake Biwa Marriott Hotel with a GIANT bicycle rental shop in Moriyama.

Boats depart from Otsu, Hikone, Nagahama, and Omi-Imazu Ports.\n\nDetails at Shiga Prefecture Transportation.\n\nMunicipalities\n\n*Main article: Shiga Prefecture Municipalities\n\nAs of March 21, 2010, Shiga has 13 cities (-shi; 市), 6 towns (-cho; 町), and no villages (-mura; 村).

Koka is the city in Shiga with the highest number of former castles at 223.\n\nIn Aug. 1876, four counties in western Fukui Prefecture north of Shiga merged with Shiga. For about 5 years up to 1881 while these counties (including Tsuruga and Mikata) were part of Shiga, Shiga enjoyed having a coast facing the Sea of Japan.\n\nDuring a meeting of the governors of Kyoto and Shiga in late 2005, the idea of merging Kyoto and Shiga Prefectures was mentioned.\n\nSince Ohmi Railways is owned by the same company which owns Seibu Railways in Tokyo, many of the train cars look like the old Seibu Railway cars brought to Shiga from Tokyo. Local buses also might sport the same color theme or lion logo as the Seibu Railways and bus lines.\n\nTakashimaya Dept. Store got its name from Takashima, Shiga.
