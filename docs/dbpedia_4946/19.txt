AUCKLAND, New Zealand - New Zealand Football’s men’s National League Championship Grand Final has found a new home this season, and Justin Bieber’s loss is football’s gain.

The title deciding game on Sunday 4 December between Auckland City FC and Wellington Olympic will be played at Mt Smart Stadium in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland where the Canadian star’s tour was due to be held before being postponed.

With regular venue North Harbour Stadium being out of contention due to the baseball season, a range of other stadium options were considered. Mt Smart Stadium became an option after the postponed tour date released the days held for setting up the tour, including Sunday 4 December when the final was schedule to be played.

A New Zealand Football spokesperson said:

“When we were first told Mt Smart could be available our initial reaction was, What Do You Mean?

“While we’re sure that music fans are Sorry, we are delighted to be able to take the final to one of the leading stadiums in the country.

“It has been great to see Auckland City FC and Wellington Olympic Stay in a tight race all season, now they have one more game to prove their title Intentions.”
