Australia vs England\n\nWomen’s World Cup 2023: England squad\n\nWiegman named her England squad for the World Cup on Wednesday, May 31 and had a number of star players she was unable to select due to injury.\n\nCaptain Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby - three key players in the Euro winning team - are all absent.\n\nMillie Bright and Lucy Bronze overcame their own injury problems to be selected in the 23-player list.\n\nJordan Nobbs was included as well, despite sustaining an injury in Aston Villa's penultimate game of the season, Katie Zelem was brought back after not making the last squad in April, and Bethany England was recalled.\n\nGoalkeepers: Mary Earps (Manchester United), Hannah Hampton (Aston Villa), Ellie Roebuck (Manchester City)\n\nDefenders: Millie Bright (Chelsea), Lucy Bronze (Barcelona), Jess Carter (Chelsea), Niamh Charles (Chelsea), Alex Greenwood (Manchester City), Esme Morgan (Manchester City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal)\n\nMidfielders: Laura Coombs (Manchester City), Jordan Nobbs (Aston Villa), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Ella Toone (Manchester United), Keira Walsh (Barcelona), Katie Zelem (Manchester United)\n\nForwards: Rachel Daly (Aston Villa), Bethany England (Tottenham Hotspur), Lauren Hemp, (Manchester City), Lauren James (Chelsea), Chloe Kelly (Manchester City), Katie Robinson (Brighton & Hove Albion), Alessia Russo (Manchester United).\n\nWomen’s World Cup 2023: Full schedule\n\nAll times BST\n\nGroup stages\n\nThursday, July 20\n\nNew Zealand 1-0 Norway -
