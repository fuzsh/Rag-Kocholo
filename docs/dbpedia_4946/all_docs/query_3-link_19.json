        "text": "The Wellington Phoenix have signed English forward Olivia Fergusson for their next women’s A-League season.\n\nFergusson (29) played for Bristol City and Yeovil Town in the Women’s Super League in England, as well as playing for Celtic in the Scottish Women’s Premier League.\n\nShe most recently played for Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Women’s National League North.\n\nMain photo: Olivia Fergusson … signs as one of the club’s five visa players.\n\n“I’ve obviously played over in England for a long time, and was looking for a new challenge,” Fergusson said.\n\n“Paul (head coach Paul Temple) contacted my agent and asked if I would consider the A-League.\n\n“To be honest, I never thought I’d get an opportunity to play in the A-League, so I was definitely interested.\n\n“I caught up with Paul on a Teams chat, and that was my first real insight into the club and what he was wanting to achieve. I was really hooked after that first call.\n\n“He’d definitely done his research on me, and I feel like what he had interpreted that I can bring really aligned with what I see in myself.”\n\nFergusson wants to take a prominent role in helping the Phoenix reach the 2024-25 Liberty A-League.finals for the first time.\n\n“I’m an attacking player. I like to contribute with goals and assists, but mostly I just like to work hard for the team out of possession.\n\n“Hopefully, I can bring some leadership and some experience.”\n\nAnd a nickname picked up in Scotland bodes well for her time in Wellington.\n\n“Obviously, my name is Fergusson, so at Celtic, I picked up the nickname of Fergie after (legendary Manchester United manager) Alex Ferguson.\n\n“He was known for his teams scoring late goals. I did that a couple of times at Celtic and it was known as scoring in Fergie time.\n\n“That stuck, and at Wolves last season I scored a few late goals as well.”\n\nShe has also played in the FA Women’s Championship and believes her experience across different divisions will help her adapt to the A-League.\n\n“All the leagues have their different challenges. Some are more technical, some are more tactical, some are more physical. But all of them made me the player that I am now.\n\n“With everything that I’ve done I’ve built quite a well-rounded level of experience, so that will help me.\n\n“Hopefully, I can settle in pretty quickly. Change is not something I’m new to.”\n\nHead coach Paul Temple is delighted Fergusson has signed with the Nix.\n\n“As soon as Olivia came on the radar, I thought she would be a great fit,” Temple said.\n\n“We needed another top-level striker, and she fits the bill. She’s also an experienced player with hunger and drive.\n\n“Olivia’s playing career across the WSL, Championship and SWPL speaks for itself. She’s played at big clubs and knows how football at the top level works.\n\n“She’s a versatile forward who likes to run in behind defenders and the way she plays will fit our style of play brilliantly.\n\n“Supporters want to see players who give their all for the shirt, and everything we have seen from Olivia tells us she is a player the fans will enjoy watching.”\n\nWolves have farewelled Fergusson, with manager Dan McNamara saying: “She’s only been here for one season but she’s made a fantastic impression on the club and fans.\n\n“When those offers come in and with her being in the latter stages of her career, they’re not something you can turn down. She’ll go and experience a different culture, a different lifestyle and a different league which doesn’t come around very often.\n\n“I’m delighted for Liv. She’ll go out and have an amazing experience out there. I’d like to thank her for all her contributions to Wolves over the last 12 months.\n\n“She was a great addition and we’ll be following her journey closely from over here, and we look forward to seeing her have success in the Australian league.”\n\nPlayers signed for next season\n\nPhoenix women’s head coach Paul Temple has 12 players contracted for the 2024-25 A-League season, with discussions continuing with other off-contract players.\n\nThe players signed are Olivia Fergusson, Alyssa Whinham, Carolina Vilão, Tiana Jaber, Emma Main, Marisa van der Meer, Mackenzie Barry, Olivia Ingham, Zoe McMeeken, Manaia Elliott, Daisy Brazendale and Rebecca Lake.\n\nREAD MORE: Phoenix sign goalkeeper Carolina Vilão from Portugese title winners Benfica >>>>\n\nREAD MORE: Defender Tiana Jaber becomes ninth women’s A-League signing for Phoenix >>>>\n\nREAD MORE: Wellington Phoenix agree new contract to keep forward Emma Main >>>>\n\nREAD MORE: Defender Marisa van der Meer signs new deal with Wellington Phoenix >>>>\n\nREAD MORE: Wellington Phoenix sign new deal with women’s vice captain Rebecca Lake >>>>\n\nThis story was first published on August 9, 2024."
