        "text": "The Rugby Championship is back.\n\nThe southern hemisphere's Test-match showpiece returns to regular programming this year, with a full 12-game calendar that will be played across August and September under the \"mini tour\" format.\n\nThat means that each team faces two away games against one country, two home games against another, and then both a home and away contest against their closest regional rival.\n\nThe tournament will also trial several law variations, including the return of the full red card and reduced time limits for conversions.\n\nRead on as we bring you the latest team news below and look ahead to the Round 1 clashes.\n\nSaturday, August 10\n\nAustralia vs. South Africa, Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane, 2.45pm AEST [4.45pm NZT, 6.45am RSA, 1.45am ARG]\n\nAustralia: Tom Wright, Andrew Kellaway, Len Ikitau, Hunter Paisami, Filipo Daugunu, Noah Lolesio, Jake Gordon, Harry Wilson, Carlo Tizzano, Rob Valetini, Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, Nick Frost, Allan Alaalatoa (c), Matt Faessler, Isaac Kailea.\n\nReplacements: Josh Nasser, James Slipper, Zane Nonggorr, Jeremy Williams, Luke Reimer, Tate McDermott, Tom Lynagh, Dylan Pietsch\n\nSouth Africa: Willie le Roux, Cheslin Kolbe, Jesse Kriel, Damian de Allende, Kurt-Lee Arendse, Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, Cobus Reinach, Elrigh Louw, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Siya Kolisi (captain), RG Snyman, Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Bongi Mbonambi, Ox Nche\n\nReplacements: Malcolm Marx, Gerhard Steenekamp, Vincent Koch, Ben-Jason Dixon, Marco van Staden, Kwagga Smith, Grant Williams, Handré Pollard\n\nTeam news: Utility back Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu will start at fly-half for the Springboks against the Wallabies, with veteran Handre Pollard on the bench as their Rugby Championship campaign begins in Brisbane. Feinberg-Mngomezulu has become a quick fan-favourite since his debut against Wales earlier this year, marking a remarkable rise from playing provincial rugby just a year ago. Siya Kolisi will captain the side, while RG Snyman starts at 5 in the absence of injured Franco Mostert.\n\nAustralia, meanwhile, will be without prop Taniela Tupou after the tighthead prop was given the week off following the death of his father. Tupou's absence means Allan Alaalatoa again starts in the No. 3 jersey while Lukhan Salakaia-Loto returns in the second row. The Wallabies will also unleash yet another debutant, with flanker Carlo Tizzano winning the right to replace the injured Fraser McReight at No. 7.\n\nIn the backs, Jake Gordon and Noah Lolesio are reinstated as the starting halves combination while Andrew Kellaway returns on the right wing.\n\nPrediction: Who'd have thought it would be the Wallabies who enter this Test with the better recent record? Australia's clean sweep of July and four-match winning run has gone some way to earning back the faith of the rugby public, with a sell-out crowd at Suncorp Stadium confirmed on Wednesday. It has been a long time since a Wallabies Test has put the \"house full\" sign up midweek and the team will no doubt be bouyed by that scale of local support. But the question remains as to whether the Joe Schmidt evolution has had sufficient time to bed in. Looking back at the Tests against Wales, and even Georgia, the evidence suggests that they do not have the consistency to worry the world champions, and big questions remain over their defensive maul. And while the Boks dropped their second Test to Ireland, the level of that series compared to what Australia contested in July do not stack up. It's true, the Boks' record in Australia is dreadful, but their victory in Sydney in 2022 offers the blueprint that they must replicate. The Wallabies could not confront the power game on that occasion and will struggle to do so again here if the Boks take an early foothold. South Africa by 5.\n\nNew Zealand vs. Argentina, Sky Stadium, Wellington, 5.05pm AEST [7.05pm NZ, 9.05am SA, 4.05am ARG]\n\nNew Zealand: Beauden Barrett, Sevu Reece, Anton Lienert-Brown, Jordie Barrett, Mark Tele'a, Damian McKenzie, TJ Perenara; Ardie Savea (capt), Dalton Papali'i, Ethan Blackadder, Sam Darry, Tupou Vaa'i, Tyrel Lomax, Codie Taylor, Ethan De Groot. Replacements: Asafo Aumua, Ofa Tu'ungafasi, Fletcher Newell, Josh Lord, Wallace Sititi, Cortez Ratima, Rieko Ioane, Will Jordan.\n\nArgentina: Juan Cruz Mallia, Matias Moroni, Lucio Cinti, Santiago Chocobares, Mateo Carreras, Santiago Carreras, Gonzalo Bertranou, Juan Martin Gonzalez, Marcos Kremer, 6-Pablo Matera (c), Pedro Rubiolo, Franco Molina, Eduardo Bello, Ignacio Ruiz, Thomas Gallo\n\nReplacements: Agustin Creevy, Mayco Vivas, Joel Sclavi Efrain Elias Tomas Lavanini, Joaquin Oviedo,Lautaro Bazan Velez, Tomas Albornoz\n\nTeam news: All Blacks coach Scott Robertson has handed a start to Anton Lienert-Brown after a dip in form from veteran flyer Rieko Ioane. The other notable change in the backline is TJ Perenara's return at scrum-half.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethan Blackadder and Sam Darry start at No. 6 and lock respectively, the latter partnering Tupou Vaa'i in the second row in the absence of skipper Scott Barrett and Patrick Tuipulotu.\n\nLos Pumas will have Thomas Gallo and Eduardo Bello as pillars and Ignacio Ruiz, who will play his first game against the men in black, in the hooker position. A very young second-row, with Franco Molina, who will also appear for the first time against the All Blacks, and Pedro Rubiolo.\n\nMeanwhile, the back-row is one of the team's main strengths: Pablo Matera and Marcos Kremer join Juan Martín González, who after the scheduled rest, will play for the first time in the national team in 2024. In turn, Gonzalo Bertranou and Santiago Carreras will be the drivers, with Santiago Chocobares and the return of Lucio Cinti in the center of the field. In the background, there will be Mateo Carreras, Matías Moroni and Juan Cruz Mallía, who will also reappear in the national team."
