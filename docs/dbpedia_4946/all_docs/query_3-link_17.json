        "text": "Student athletes are given a platform to maximize their individual abilities, while simultaneously helping Wellington win championships. The program values inclusion of the student body and is committed to finding a place for all student athletes at either the junior varsity or varsity level. Playing time is not guaranteed at the varsity level. Responsibility, time management skills, and leadership development are expected by-products of participation at this level.\n\nSkill development and a balance between participation and increased competition are the primary focus of middle school athletics. The goal is for each student to receive some playing time during each contest and all Wellington students are encouraged to join our athletic teams. Coaches and athletes work to create an inclusive and energetic team environment, while thoroughly preparing for the transition to upper school athletics.\n\nThroughout the school year we offer a variety of camps and clinics through our Junior Jags program. These opportunities reflect a variety of sports which are provided in our Middle and Upper School athletic programs. Junior Jag camps and clinics are often instructed by our Varsity Coaches, with the support of our Upper School students. This is a fun way to build community between young, aspiring athletes and our experienced Varsity student-athletes.\n\nWe are happy to offer the Wellington Youth Basketball League (WYBL) once again this year! League registration is now live, so register soon! You are allowed to request 1 player per registration, or you can register a full team with at least 8 players but no more than 10. Any team entries must have an established coach. If registering individually, I ask that you consider coaching a team.
