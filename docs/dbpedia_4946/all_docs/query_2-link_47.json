They post a programme before the match but absolutely nothing on twitter or anything while the game is building up or playing.\n\nThey didn't even post about the last away loss to Southern mind you they might have been a bit embarrassed more than anything.\n\nHawkes Bay are tweeting, I'm following that, but they didn't give our starting line up, anyone know?\n\nLee Padmore will be in the gun, but surely can't blamed for a most of it. Its a team short on quality of previous years due to the financial situation. A near full MPL based team will struggle until they are given time to develop as a unit over 2-3 seasons. Padmore looks a decent young coach and clearly has ties to the region. I back the proud region to be back up there, just a different plan how to get there!\n\nThe JourneyFan wrote:\n\nchubbs wrote:\n\nI'm a long way away from Canterbury geographically but it's pretty apparent that sides in the premiership run by the federations - canterbury , Southern , Hawkes bay and previously WaiBop - are not successful.

They only field teams in the national league and national youth league and have no existence outside of that.\n\nFrom Wikipedia: \"Waitakere United was formed as a special franchise club in 2004 to play in the New Zealand Football Championship (NZFC), New Zealand's top domestic football competition. The team represents 12 member clubs from Mt Albert to the Kaipara.\"\n\nAuckland City have close ties to Central United but are a different entity and field no teams outside of the national league.\n\nIn fact Auckland City were not even affiliated with the Auckland Football Federation as genuine clubs are required to be until this week:\n\nhttp://www.aucklandfootball.org.nz/newsarticle/86754\n\nThey joined this week to satisfy NZ Football requirements for next season's nation league that participating clubs demonstrate a clear youth development pathway now the the national youth league is gone: \"Auckland City FC join the federation member clubs in the form of a National League member club and will work in partnership with Central United FC to deliver elements of New Zealand Football’s Community Participation pathway.\"\n\nTeam Wellington (from Wikipedia): \"Team Wellington FC was formed in 2004 by a consortium of Wellington clubs to compete in the New Zealand Football Championship. The uniform was yellow with black shorts, utilising the primary sporting colours of the Wellington region.\"\n\nOf \"the four sides that have won the premiership since it's inception - Auckland, Waitak , Wellington and Eastern Suburbs\" only Eastern Suburbs is genuinely club based.\n\nNews just in - The committee of Canterbury United has made enquiries with NZ Football as to the size of the spoon to ensure it fits in the Trophy Cabinet.\n\nNot quite the silverware they were after but they are back slapping each other as one of their KPIs was an addition to the Trophy Cabinet - so drinks all round.\n\nGarbhan Coughlan of Southern United rumoured to be heading to live in Christchurch permanently to play for Tech in the winter and the Dragons in the summer.\n\nA player who knows how to score a few:\n\nhttps://int.soccerway.com/players/garbhan-coughlan/134928/\n\nGarbhan played for Cashmere Tech last winter but with Paul O'Reilly no longer at Southern, I guess Garbhan feels no allegiance to them any more.\n\nOr did I get the player name wrong yesterday?\n\nGavin, can you confirm?\n\nGarbhan Coughlan of Southern United rumoured to be heading to live in Christchurch permanently to play for Tech in the winter and the Dragons in the summer.\n\nA player who knows how to score a few:\n\nhttps://int.soccerway.com/players/garbhan-coughlan/134928/\n\nGarbhan played for Cashmere Tech last winter but with Paul O'Reilly no longer at Southern, I guess Garbhan feels no allegiance to them any more.\n\nOr did I get the player name wrong yesterday?\n\nGavin, can you confirm?\n\nOne the strange signings I've seen. One of 3 Irishmen brought in from Ireland and given a job at Football South (Competitions Manager) and then decides to play in the Mainland Premier League.\n\nIf he feels no allegiance to them (your words not his, I know) then that would be a little odd.\n\nMight be given a job at Mainland perhaps?\n\n7thFed wrote:\n\nI'd challenge you to live in Dunedin and see the poor quality of football served up by the local teams in the winter\n\nUnwatchable\n\nCavy Mosgiel Uni got hammered in the SI comp\n\nI don't blame Coughlan searching for a better game\n\nYup, that maybe the case. (Don't forget the 11-1 thumping Coastal gave Qtown as well, one of the greatest weekends of my life...)\n\nI don't think anyone is hassling anyone for travelling to play football. It's just a little odd when you work for the football federation and decide to leave it to play elsewhere..."
