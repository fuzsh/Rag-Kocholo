        "text": "The show jumping community always knew Robert Ridland as a great rider, but now they also see him as the brilliant, strategic mind guiding the NetJets Show Jumping team to unprecedented success. Ridland brings several decades of international experience to the U.S. Show Jumping.\n\nAs an athlete, Ridland competed in the Montreal 1976 Olympic Games and won several grand prix competitions throughout his riding career. Ridland has been extensively involved in the governance of the sport, including several terms as a board member of US Equestrian and the United States Equestrian Team Foundation.\n\nRidland's vast experience as an international course designer helped shaped his analytical approach to the sport. He won the Course Designer of the Year Award twice while building the courses for the U.S. Olympic Trials and numerous international competitions. As an international official, he was the only American to have served as the FEI Technical Delegate for four FEI World Cup Finals. As a television commentator, he worked for many years as the color analyst for ESPN and CBS, as well as two stints for NBC at the Barcelona and Athens Olympic Games.\n\nSince being named the U.S. Show Jumping Chef d’Equipe/Technical Advisor in 2013, Ridland has led the U.S. team to team bronze medals at the 2014 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games and Toronto 2015 Pan American Games as well as silver medals in the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and the 2017 FEI Jumping Nations Cup Final.\n\nOriginally from Milwaukee, Wisc., Elizabeth ‘Beezie’ Madden has been riding since the age of three and received her first pony as a Christmas gift at age four. Madden rode throughout her childhood and competitively for Southern Seminary Junior College, in addition to playing basketball and softball. However, riding was her true passion. She made her debut at the Grand Prix level at the age of 22. For nearly three decades, Madden has represented the United States in the world’s most prestigious competitions becoming the first American to break into the top-three on the FEI Jumping World Ranking List. She was the first woman to pass the $1 million mark in earnings in the sport of jumping. Madden has won the USEF Equestrian of the Year title five times, including back-to-back honors in 2006 and 2007 - the first rider ever to do so - and then again earning back-to-back honors in 2013 and 2014.\n\nIn 2018, Madden and the Dutch Warmblood stallion Darry Lou placed sixth in the Rolex Grand Prix at the 2018 CHIO Aachen in July. In 2019, she and Chic Hin D Hyrencourt were selected to represent the NetJets U.S. Jumping Team at the FEI Jumping Nations Cup Wellington CSIO4*, where the combination helped the team secure gold. Later in the year, Madden and Darry Lou captured the coveted $3,000,000 CP ‘International’ Grand Prix presented by Rolex during the Spruce Meadows ‘Masters’ CSIO5* before she guided Garant to a win in the $210,000 FEI Jumping World Cup Qualifier New York CSI4*-W in Old Salem, N.Y. in the same month. Madden and Darry Lou began the 2020 competition year representing the NetJets U.S. Show Jumping Team at the FEI Jumping Nations Cup USA, where the team secured a first-place finish after the combination produced a clear jump-off effort in a tightly contested competition with Great Britain. Most recently, Madden has captured grand prix wins and numerous top finishes at the 2021 Winter Equestrian Festival with Garant, Breitling LS, and Chic Hin D Hyrencourt.\n\nIn addition to competing, Madden runs a successful training and sales business with her husband John out of their Cazenovia, N.Y., and Wellington, Fla., bases.\n\nAdrienne Sternlicht moved through the pony and junior hunter divisions to turn into a serious competitor on the international grand prix circuit. Although her first passion was riding, she took a break during high school and returned while attending Brown University. In 2016, Sternlicht began her partnership with Cristalline and started to train with U.S. Olympic double gold medalist McLain Ward.\n\nIn May 2017, Sternlicht made her Nations Cup debut with Cristalline at the FEI Nations Cup™ CSIO4* Coapexpan in Mexico, where they helped the U.S. team win the silver medal. Since then, she has been a member of several Nations Cup teams and collected numerous individual top placings, resulting in her selection to the WEG 2018 NetJets U.S. Show Jumping Team Short List. Following her selection to the short list, she placed second in the $250,000 Sapphire Grand Prix of Devon, won a CSI5* class during Knokke Hippique, and was part of the U.S. team for FEI Jumping Nations Cup Ireland, where she placed fourth in the Longines International Grand Prix of Ireland. Named to the WEG Tryon 2018 team, she and Cristalline aided the U.S. team in their historic victory, bringing home the gold medal for the U.S. for the first time in 36 years.\n\nIn 2020, Sternlicht started the year with a CSI4* win at the Winter Equestrian Festival in Wellington, Fla. aboard Just a Gamble before being selected to represent the U.S. Jumping Team for the FEI Jumping Nations Cup Wellington CSIO4*, where she helped the team secure gold. In 2021, Sternlicht was part of FEI Nations Cup teams in Sopot, Poland, and Rotterdam, The Netherlands, with Benny’s Legacy.\n\nSternlicht started off 2022 with a win in a CSI3* at the Winter Equestrian Festival in January riding Lafayette Van Overis, followed by a win in the CSI5* with Benny’s Legacy at WEF in February. She traveled to Europe for the summer season and where she was part of the U.S. team at the Mercedes-Benz Jumping Nations’ Cup of Aachen CSIO5* in June. In July, she and Benny’s Legacy earned a win at the Grand Prix of Valkenswaard CSI2*.\n\nMcLain Ward was introduced to riding before he could walk and has a competitive prowess that only continues to increase with age. In 1990, Ward became the youngest rider ever to win both the United States Equestrian Team (USET) Medal Finals and the USET Talent Derby at age 14. After turning pro, he quickly became the youngest rider to reach the $1 million mark in earnings in 1999, at the age of 24.\n\nWard is a six-time Olympian, including as a member of the gold-medal-winning U.S. teams in Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008 with his longtime mount, Sapphire. With HH Azur, he was part of the U.S. team that took silver at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Ward was also a team silver medalist at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games riding Contagious.\n\nHe was a member of the gold-medal winning NetJets® U.S. Jumping Team for the FEI World Equestrian Games Tryon 2018 riding Clinta, WEG Normandy 2014 team bronze medalist with Rothchild, and WEG Aachen 2006 team silver medalist with Sapphire. As a Pan American Games athlete, Ward was a part of the gold-medal team in Guadalajara 2011 riding Antares F and won individual gold and team bronze in Toronto 2015 riding Rothchild.\n\nIn 2009, Ward rode Sapphire to his first-ever podium finish at the FEI Jumping World Cup Final, finishing in second place. In 2017, he finished the job, winning the FEI Jumping World Cup Final in Omaha with HH Azur.\n\nWard continued with a strong showing during the 2022 season securing two wins riding Contagious in the Turkish Airlines – CHIO Aachen CSIO5* Grand Prix as well as the RWE Prize of North Rhine-Westphalia – Aachen CHIO CSIO5* Grand Prix.\n\nWard was a member of the NetJets U.S. Jumping Team at the 2022 ECCO FEI World Championships in Herning, Denmark, with Contagious. He closed out the year by winning the Rolex Grand Prix at CHI Geneva with HH Azur.\n\nIn 2023, Ward won the Rolex Grand Prix at The Dutch Masters with HH Azur. At the San Juan Capistrano CSIO5*, Ward helped the U.S. team win the FEI Jumping Nations Cup of USA with Contagious, Grand Prix of the United States with Kasper van het Hellehof, and Winning Round with First Lady. He was named to the U.S. Jumping Team for the 2023 Pan American Games to help the team secure their Paris 2024 qualification. Ward rode his longtime mount, Contagious, helping the team finish with gold and also earning an individual bronze medal.\n\nWith the pressure of the 2024 Olympics mounting, Ward added a new mount to his string, bringing Ilex on board as a potential Olympic mount, alongside his veteran horse, Callas. Ward and Callas earned a second place finish in one of their first starts in a CSI5* Grand Prix of 2023, while both horses were strong for the U.S. Jumping Team, with Ward and Ilex bringing earning the team's only double-clear in their team debut at the Wellington CSIO4* and a strong showing for Callas at the Longines League of Nations CSIO5* in Ocala, Fla. Ward finished the winter season with a second place in the Rolex Grand Prix CSI5* in Wellington, Fla. with Ilex before heading to Europe as part of the U.S. Jumping Team Short List for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nWard earned top finishes with both Callas and Ilex during their European Tour, which was capped by team selection with Ilex to represent the United States at the 2024 Olympic Games. The pair also earned an impressive second-place finish in the Rolex Grand Prix of Aachen, considered to be one of the most difficult Grand Prix classes in the world.\n\nParis 2024 will be Ward's sixth consecutive Olympic Games and Ilex's first.\n\nWard’s home base is in upstate New York where he lives with his wife, Lauren, who is an avid competitor in the amateur divisions. They have two young daughters named Lilly and Madison."
