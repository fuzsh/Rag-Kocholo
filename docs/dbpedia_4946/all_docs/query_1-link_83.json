        "text": "Last Week: 14-6, .700\n\nSeason total: 410-109, .790\n\nWeek 14 brings us to the regional semifinal round in all 11-man classifications, and the Big Country still has 12 area teams and three Abilene locals trying to play in December.\n\nIt’s my guess that at least five of these clubs will see action in Week 15.\n\nLet’s have a quick look at matchups involving area teams:\n\n4A DII REGIONAL SEMIFINAL\n\nSweetwater (10-1) vs. Glen Rose (8-4)\n\n2 p.m. Friday, Graham\n\nBoth clubs come in averaging better than 40 points per game. But Sweetwater has limited its opposition to just 17 points per night against a slightly tougher overall schedule.\n\nLots of firepower here on both sides but defensive stops will be the deciding factor.\n\nPICK: Sweetwater by 10\n\nCLASS 3A DII REGIONAL SEMIFINAL\n\nCanadian (10-2) vs. Coleman (9-3)\n\n2 p.m. Friday, Iowa Park\n\nCan Coleman win this game? Absolutely, but it’s going to take the Bluecats’ best effort of the year to get it done.\n\nCanadian hasn’t scored fewer than 34 points in since an 18-17 win over Childress on Oct. 7, so the pressure will be on Coleman to consistently move the chains.\n\nGranted, Coleman can play some quality defense, holding the opposition to just 17 points per game. But if the Bluecats are to win here, they’ll need to win the turnover battle and turn a high percentage of their possessions into points.\n\nThat leaves Coleman with little margin for error.\n\nI’ll play the percentages and go with the Wildcats.\n\nPICK: Canadian by 14.\n\nCLASS 2A DI REGIONAL SEMIFINAL\n\nWindthorst (8-4) vs. De Leon (10-2)\n\n2 p.m. Friday, Jacksboro\n\nI could have just flipped a coin to make my pick on this one, which stacks up as dead even on paper.\n\nBut last week’s stunning 36-34 Windthorst victory over an excellent Bosqueville team has me leaning toward WHS — barely.\n\nPICK: Windthorst by 1.\n\nCLASS 2A DI REGIONAL SEMIFINAL\n\nForsan (9-3) vs. Anson (9-3)\n\n2 p.m. Saturday, Sweetwater\n\nYes, Forsan defeated Anson 27-24 on Oct. 21 and yes, the Buffaloes are playing great football, winning four of their last five games, including last week’s 51-8 area rout of New Deal.\n\nHowever, the earlier meeting between these two clubs was in Forsan’s backyard. This will be on a neutral field. And since that earlier meeting, Anson has played its best football of the year — winning the district 4-2A DI title and whipping a very good team from Post (48-21) to start a three-game winning streak.\n\nAnson has confidence and momentum – just enough to get the Tigers to the next round.\n\nPICK: Anson by 3\n\nCLASS 2A DII REGIONAL SEMIFINAL\n\nMunday (11-1) vs. Muenster (11-1)\n\n1 p.m. Friday, Memorial Stadium, Wichita Falls\n\nA tough call here, but there are two things that stand out in this matchup: First, Muenster hasn’t scored fewer than 45 points nine weeks. And secondly, the Hornets’ defense is comparable to that of Munday’s, allowing just 14 points per game to the Moguls’ 12.\n\nA recent 51-13 rout of Quanah, with which Munday defeated 18-2, is another checkmark in the Hornets’ corner.\n\nFirepower puts the Hornets on top.\n\nPICK: Muenster by 7\n\nCLASS 2A DII REGIONAL SEMIFINAL\n\nIraan (12-0) vs. Albany (11-1),\n\n7 p.m. Friday, Wolf Stadium, Colorado City\n\nThis matchup has been on the radar screen for two months — it was that easy for everyone to see coming.\n\nAgainst comparably difficult schedules, the numbers here are very close, with Iraan outscoring the opposition 46-12 and the more Albany winning by an average margin of 43-12.\n\nOn paper, this thing is a coin toss and the computers are saying the same thing.\n\nTypically, I’d go with the more ground-based team (Iraan) in a matchup this close. But, I’m going with the Lions for two historic reasons.\n\nFirst, Albany is 4-0 overall against Iraan, with three of those wins coming since 2012. And secondly, Denney Faith’s Lions are just plain tough to get rid of in November.\n\nPICK: Albany by 1\n\nCLASS 2A DII REGIONAL SEMIFINAL\n\nWellington (11-1) vs. Hamlin (10-2)\n\n1 p.m. Friday, Vernon\n\nSomething has to give here.\n\nHamlin enters this week on a nine-game winning streak; Wellington has won six straight.\n\nBoth clubs are holding their opposition to just 13 points per game and both are scoring roughly 40 per night.\n\nHowever, Wellington has been in the ring with some real heavyweights and my pick is based on what WHS is capable of when it’s right. One key example: beating 3A power Childress 26-21 in its season opener.\n\nRight now, the Skyrockets are in stride — not allowing more than 12 points in a game since Oct. 7.\n\nPICK: Wellington by 7\n\nCLASS 2A DII REGIONAL SEMIFINAL\n\nRoscoe (8-4) vs. Seagraves (9-3)\n\n2 p.m. Friday, Grande Communications Stadium, Midland\n\nIf the adage that it’s difficult to beat a good football team twice in one season is correct, than Roscoe may have a problem here, having already beaten SHS 39-23 on Oct. 21 in District 4-2A DII.\n\nNonetheless, I’m a believer in the firepower that Roscoe brings to the table — firepower that has produced 39 or more points in seven of its last eight games.\n\nSeagraves will find the end zone multiple times, but not enough to win.\n\nPICK: Roscoe by 12\n\nCLASS 1A DI STATE QUARTERFINAL\n\nZephyr (10-2) vs. Jonesboro (12-0)\n\n7:30 p.m. Friday, Memorial Stadium, Dublin\n\nThe computers project this to go the distance, but an 80-46 win by Jonesboro over Zephy on Oct. 28 sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nJonesboro is allowing only 21 points per game, and at the six-man level, that’s some serious defense.\n\nDefensive stops give the Eagles the edge.\n\nPICK: Jonesboro by 16\n\nCLASS 1A DI STATE QUARTERFINAL\n\nHappy (12-0) vs. Knox City (8-4)\n\n3 p.m. Saturday, Hermleigh\n\nWhen you can consistently get defensive stops in the six-man game, it’s an enormous advantage, and Happy’s Cowboys are doing just that — holding the opposition to only 14 points per game.\n\nKnox City is on a roll, winning five straight. But the Greyhounds have given up 186 points over the last three weeks. That makes it difficult to give them the checkmark here.\n\nPICK: Happy by 45\n\nCLASS 1A DII STATE QUARTERFINAL\n\nPanther Creek (12-0) vs. Crowell (10-1)\n\n6 p.m. Saturday, Aspermont\n\nPanther Creek has done everything asked of it in 2016, improving from 2-8 a year ago to an unbeaten team that stands as the Big Country’s last survivor in Class 1A DII.\n\nBut here’s the thing: Crowell represents a leap beyond any team the Panthers have faced thus far.\n\nIn fact, CHS is in a completely different solar system – defeating its last five straight opponents by the 45-point mercy rule, including previously unbeaten Strawn (64-18) a week ago.\n\nIt gives me no pleasure to say this, but the Panthers’ miraculous run of 2016 will in all likelihood, come to a close this week.\n\nPICK: Crowell by 45\n\nTAIAO DII STATE CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nStephenville Home School (9-2) vs. Bastrop Tribe Consolidated (10-2)\n\n1 p.m., Saturday, Bryan\n\nSHS has played a slightly tougher schedule than Tribe Consolidated and has produced better defensive numbers against that schedule.\n\nThe two clubs have four common opponents in Lubbock Home School Christian, Austin NYOS Charter, Bryan Christian Home School and Austin Capital City Home School and SHS has outperformed Bastrop Tribe at every turn.\n\nPICK: Stephenville Home School by 21"
