        "text": "LIVE on Sky Sport: Saturday 10 August: All Blacks vs Argentina, 7.05PM (NZST).\n\nLimited tickets are still available HERE.\n\nAll Blacks match-day 23 (Test caps in brackets)\n\n1.

Will Jordan (31)\n\nUnavailable due to injury: Scott Barrett (finger surgery), Patrick Tuipulotu (calf), Stephen Perofeta (calf), Luke Jacobson (hamstring).\n\nNo.8 Ardie Savea will captain the All Blacks against Argentina in a squad that also features the return of halfback TJ Perenara and outside back Will Jordan from injury.\n\nSavea will lead the All Blacks for the ninth time, taking over from lock Scott Barrett, who was unavailable as he recovers from surgery on a broken finger.\n\n“We’ve laid a solid foundation through the first three Tests of the year and prepared well this week for what will be a physical Test against Argentina,” Savea said ahead of what will be the first time he’s captained the All Blacks since leading the side to a 96-17 win over Italy in Lyon during the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe Wellington loose forward will combine with openside Dalton Papali’i and blindside Ethan Blackadder with Wallace Sititi providing impact from the reserves in what will be his second Test.\n\nLock Sam Darry also earns a second start, at lock, after his impressive debut against Fiji in San Diego and will partner Tupou Vaa’i in the second row. Senior lock Patrick Tuipulotu (calf) and loose forward Luke Jacobson (hamstring) were both unavailable for selection after suffering injuries in training.\n\nAll Blacks Head Coach Scott Robertson said the squad was focused and ready ahead of the first Test of the Lipovitan-D Rugby Championship.\n\n“It’s a special night for Ardie leading the team in his hometown and it’s great to have TJ and Will back in the mix. Once again there were some close selection calls but we’ve picked a squad to win the key contests and perform on Saturday. We know Argentina will bring a lot of physicality and passion to the Test and we’re ready for that challenge.”\n\nIn the backs Anton Lienert-Brown will wear the All Blacks No.13 jersey for the 31st time following a standout performance against Fiji in San Diego. Lienert-Brown will combine with vice-captain Jordie Barrett in the midfield, just the second time they duo have started a Test together as a midfield pairing.\n\nPerenara returns at halfback after injuring his lower leg during the first Test of the season against England in Dunedin, while Jordan takes his place in the match day 23 for the first time since the Rugby World Cup final against South Africa last year after recovering from a shoulder injury.\n\nMATCH FACTS\n\nThe All Blacks have played Argentina 41 times in Tests since their first match in Buenos Aires in 1976.\n\nArgentina have beaten the All Blacks on two occasions, 25-15 in Sydney in 2020 and 25-18 in Christchurch in 2022.\n\nThere has been one draw between the two teams, 21-21 in Buenos Aires in 1985.\n\nThe teams last played each other in the semifinals of the 2023 Rugby World Cup with the All Blacks winning 44-6 in Paris."
