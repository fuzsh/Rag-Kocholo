        "text": "The New Zealand Women’s World Cup 2023 squad will make history as one of the two hosts of the tournament. The players selected will get the opportunity to play in front of their home fans.\n\nNew Zealand have been in the group stage of the past four Women's World Cup but have never made it past that point. In fact their biggest international success probably came at the 2012 Olympics in London, when they made it to the quarter-finals.\n\nRecent results for the Football Ferns have been pretty poor however. Until a recent draw with Iceland, they were on a five game losing run, and have not won a game since September of last year when they beat the Philippines 2-1.\n\nIn April's international break Hannah Wilkinson equalised for them after Dagny Brynjarsdottir had put Iceland ahead. But they then lost their second game of the break 3-0 to Nigeria.\n\nDespite being a small nation, New Zealand have developed a number of talented footballers over the years. Their squad is definitely on the older side with a number of their key players potentially playing at their last major tournament.\n\nKey to the way New Zealand play is captain Ali Riley. The 35 year old has played all over the world with her immense experience being crucial to their defence. She is a leader both on and off the pitch, and also captains Angel City in the NWSL.\n\nRiley's experience is complemented by Ria Percival who normally plays ahead of her in midfield. Percival suffered an ACL injury which ruled her out of the majority of this season but has recently returned to the pitch for a club Tottenham, and will surely go straight back into New Zealand's squad for the World Cup.\n\nOne interesting selection might be within the goalkeeping pool. Aston Villa's Anna Leat has picked up a handful of caps over the years, initially making her senior debut as a 16 year old. Leat has usurped England international Hannah Hampton at club level at points this season, and whilst she is unlikely to start ahead of the experienced Erin Nayler, could be a pick for the future.\n\nNew Zealand are in World Cup Group A with Norway, the Philippines and Canada, their first World Cup fixture is against Norway on July 20. Below is their final World Cup squad.\n\nNew Zealand Women's World Cup 2023 squad\n\nNew Zealand Women's World Cup 2023 squad\n\nGK: Erin Nayler (IFK Norrköping)\n\nGK: Victoria Esson (Rangers)\n\nGK: Anna Leat (Aston Villa)\n\nDF: Elizabeth Anton (Perth Glory)\n\nDF: Claudia Bunge (Melbourne Victory)\n\nDF: CJ Bott (Leicester City)\n\nDF: Michaela Foster (Wellington Phoenix)\n\nDF: Ali Riley (Angel City)\n\nDF: Rebekah Stott (Brighton & Hove Albion)\n\nDF: Katie Bowen (Melbourne City)\n\nMF: Malia Steinmetz (Western Sydney Wanderers)\n\nMF: Ria Percival (Tottenham Hotspur)\n\nMF: Daisy Cleverley (HB Køge)\n\nMF: Annalie Longo (Christchurch United)\n\nMF: Olivia Chance (Celtic)\n\nMF: Betsy Hassett (Stjarnan)\n\nFW: Paige Satchell (Wellington Phoenix)\n\nFW: Jacqui Hand (Åland United)\n\nFW: Hannah Wilkinson (Melbourne City)\n\nFW: Grace Jale (Canberra United)\n\nFW: Gabi Rennie (Arizona State Sun Devils)\n\nFW: Indiah-Paige Riley (Brisbane Roar)\n\nFW: Milly Clegg (Wellington Phoenix)\n\nNew Zealand manager\n\nWho is the New Zealand's manager?\n\nJitka Klimková is a Czech former footballer. The 48 year old made only two appearances for the Czech Republic before moving into coaching as a 30 year old. She has previously worked with youth age groups in the Czech Republic, New Zealand and the United States. Klimková is the first woman appointed to coach New Zealand on a full-time basis.\n\nHow many players are the New Zealand allowed to take to the World Cup 2023?\n\nNew Zealand will be able to select 23 players as part of their historic squad for their home World Cup. Some countries did request to have bigger squads but that was turned down by FIFA who insisted the 23 limit was respected."
