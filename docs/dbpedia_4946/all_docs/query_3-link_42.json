        "text": "Team Wellington FC Claims A Spot On The World Football Map\n\nTeam Wellington FC may be heading into their maiden FIFA Club World Cup tournament as underdogs in the eyes of some, but the spirited semi-professionals from New Zealand are determined to make a statement at the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2018, which includes a seven-star line-up of teams this year featuring some of the world’s most famous football clubs.\n\nSoccer News: The FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2018 is Team Wellington FC may be heading into their maiden FIFA Club World Cup tournament as underdogs in the eyes of some, but the spirited semi-professionals from New Zealand are determined to make a statement at the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2018, which includes a seven-star line-up of teams this year featuring some of the world’s most famous football clubs.\n\nTeam Wellington could be considered underdogs but according to their FIFA website page, they are a tough team to overrun.\n\n“We are expecting the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2018 to be a huge but exciting challenge for us. It is our first experience playing at this level, something we are very excited about and we are honoured to be representing our Oceania Football Federation region,” said Team Wellington FC coach JoseFigueira.\n\nHaving booked their place in the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2018 with a comprehensive 10-3 aggregate victory over Fiji’s Lautoka FC in the OFC (Oceania) Champions League back in May, the Kiwis are now determined to make full use of the opportunity and establish Team Wellington FC on the world football map – starting against tournament hosts Al Ain FC on 12 December.\n\n“This is an incredible opportunity to not only represent our club, but our city and country on the world stage. We are playing against top professional players and we want to perform to the best of our ability. As long as we give a good account of ourselves, I will be happy,” said Team Wellington FC General Manager Peter Becker.\n\nThe victory over Lautoka secured a first continental crown for a club that only came into existence back in 2004. In contrast, Team Wellington FC’s opening FIFA Club World Cup opponents Al Ain FC are celebrating their 50thanniversary this year, while defending champions Real Madrid have 116 years of history behind them.\n\n“Four years ago, we set out to play in the FIFA Club World Cup. It has taken us four years to achieve this goal,” said Becker. “Now we want to qualify for next year’s competition. We’ve gotten this far thanks to good coaches, good off-field management and, above all else, a great group of players that have really bought into the team vision.”\n\n“This tournament means a great deal to our club. Team Wellington are determined to use the experience to further strengthen our OFC Champions League title defence – and we hope to return to this tournament again in the near future,” added English national Figueira, an experienced coach who has worked with teams at all levels in New Zealand and the United States for more than 15 years.\n\n“We are under no illusions that we enter this year’s FIFA Club World Cup as firm underdogs. Whilst the expectations for us may be low amongst many observers, we are a team that dreams big – and that dream starts in our opening match against Al Ain.”\n\nNicknamed ‘Team Welly’, the Oceania side is more accustomed to playing in front of average crowds close to 1,000 in their domestic competition. That will change dramatically when they take the field at Al Ain FC’s impressive 24,000-seat Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium, but the spectacle will be the culmination of years of hard work and effort. Those close to the club are determined to enjoy it."
