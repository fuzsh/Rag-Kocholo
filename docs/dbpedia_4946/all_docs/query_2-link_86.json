        "text": "Yesterday, I believe Hard News was sideline at morning football watching his son, off to Petone Memorial for the first half of Petone v Miramar then dashing off over the hill to Wainui to play for his Naenae side in the afternoon (a team he organises and plays for along with two lunch time five aside teams and at least one evening indoor side). Today he was playing with his Sunday League side in the early afternoon before texting me every twenty minutes with updates from the TW Auckland City clash. He also chips in on this forum from time to time when he gets a moment.\n\nIm not sure what Feverish did today - possibly watching one of Waterside's womens' teams - but yesterday he was at Karori Park from about 10am as Wharfies Club Captain getting the changing rooms organised and making sure the six football pitches were ready to go for opening day of the season. After taking care of that he had to get ready for his his own match at 2:30 - before reassuming his Club Captaincy responsibilities in the clubrooms.\n\nAnd thats just what im aware of.\n\nI think they do their bit and take just a wee bit of interest in football in this country too.\n\nI tend to tolerate most of your nonsense HT - but that did bug me bc it was so childish."
