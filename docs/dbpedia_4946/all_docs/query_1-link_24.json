        "text": "ABOUT AUCKLAND CITY FC\n\nAuckland City Football Club is based in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city. The club competes in the 12-team Northern League which is part of New Zealand Football's new National League System implemented in September 2020.\n\nThis new competition replaces the ISPS Handa Premiership (New Zealand Football Championship). Auckland City have won the competition in eight of the 17 years since its inception.\n\nAuckland City FC has won the OFC Champions League nine times since their first crown in 2006 and remain Oceania's premier football club.\n\nAuckland City FC is an amateur club with most players having full-time occupations outside of football.\n\nSeason 2004/05\n\nIn the inaugural 2004/05 season Auckland City FC beat cross town rivals Waitakere United 3-2 in the Grand Final. Keryn Jordan, who joined City a season later, was one of the goalscorers for Waitakere United, whilst Liam Mulrooney and Grant Young, who scored twice, secured the Championship for the highly favoured home team.\n\nOFC Club Championship: Group Stage\n\nASB Premiership: Winners\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners\n\nSeason 2005/06\n\nAuckland City began their second NZFC campaign the same way they finished off their first and led the competition for most of the season. The 2005/06 Grand Final saw the team defeat Canterbury United 5-4 on penalties after the score was tied 3-3 at full time. Auckland City followed this Grand Final success with victory in the 2006 Oceania Club Championships which were held at North Harbour Stadium in Auckland. They defeated AS Pirae, of Tahiti, 3-1 in the final and remained undefeated throughout the tournament.\n\nOFC Club Championship: Winners\n\nASB Premiership: Winners\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners\n\nSeason 2006/07\n\nThe Oceania title saw Auckland City FC represent the Oceania Football Confederation at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan in December 2006. This tournament featured the champion club side from each of FIFA's six Confederations, including the mighty FC Barcelona of Spain.\n\nOn 10 December 2006 Auckland City FC lost their first game of the tournament 0-2 to the African champions, Al Ahly, of Egypt. Five days later Auckland City FC played the Asian champions, Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, of South Korea in the fifth-place play-off in Tokyo. Auckland City FC, the only amatuer side at the tournament were defeated 0-3 and finished in sixth place.\n\nJust five days after Auckland City FC's match in Tokyo, they had to play rivals Waitakere United in a crucial NZFC match at Kiwitea Street. After trailing 0-3 at half time, Auckland City FC produced a stunning comeback to win 4-3 with a 99th minute winner from Paul Urlovic. Referee Neil Fox produced an astonishing nineteen yellow and red cards in this memorable match, widely considered to be the most exciting since the competition began in October 2004.\n\nAt the end of an extremely long and challenging 2006/07 season the same two sides met again in the Grand Final where Auckland City FC triumphed once more by 3-2, to claim their third successive NZFC title.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 7th\n\nOFC Champions League: Group Stage\n\nASB Premiership: Winners\n\nMinor Premiers: Third\n\nSeason 2007/08\n\nThe 2007/08 season was a disappointing one for Auckland City FC and was the first time the club had tasted failure in the NZFC. Losing the Preliminary Final to Team Wellington was a major setback for a club that has set such high standards for itself and a period of rebuilding began.\n\nOFC Champions League: Group Stage\n\nASB Premiership: Third\n\nMinor Premiers: Runners-Up\n\nSeason 2008/09\n\nSeason 2008/09 saw Auckland City FC regain it's status as the premier club side of New Zealand domestic football. A 2-1 victory over arch rivals Waitakere United in the NZFC Grand Final, with goals to Keryn Jordan and Paul Urlovic, saw the club claim it's fourth NZFC title in the past five years.\n\nFurther victory over Waitakere United, in Group A of the OFC Champions League, saw the club progress to the final where they confronted Koloale FC of the Solomon Islands, in a two-legged final, to determine Oceania's champion club side.\n\nA comprehensive 7-2 first-leg win, away in Honiara, was followed up by a 2-2 result back at Kiwitea Street to wrap up a 9-4 aggregate victory which booked the club a trip to the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2009 which was held in Abu Dhabi from 9-19 December.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 7th\n\nOFC Champions League: Winners\n\nASB Premiership: Winners\n\nMinor Premiers: Runners-Up\n\nSeason 2009/10\n\nSeason 2009/10 saw Auckland City FC head to Abu Dhabi and record the greatest results ever achieved by an Oceania representative at the FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nFirst up the team overcame local champions Al Ahli 2-0 in the opening play-off match with memorable goals by Adam Dickinson and Chad Coombes. In their quarter final clash against Atlante FC of Mexico the side put up a brave performance which the 0-3 scoreline did not fairly reflect.\n\nThe play-off for 5th and 6th place was described by coach Paul Posa as “the greatest night in the history of Auckland City Football Club” as the team defeated TP Mazembe (Congo DR), champions of Africa, 3-2. The goal scorers on this special occasion were Jason Hayne (2) and Riki van Steeden.\n\nThese historic victories were the first recorded by a New Zealand team at this prestigious tournament and indeed the first by an amateur side at this competition. They were also the first time a senior men’s representative team from New Zealand has recorded victory at a FIFA World Finals competition.\n\nAfter returning from the Middle East the team continued their fine form and won the NZFC’s minor premiership comfortably, losing only one match in doing so during the regular domestic season. Unfortunately the effects of a long campaign, which saw the side play nearly double the amount of matches than almost all of the other NZFC sides, finally caught up with the side.\n\nAuckland City FC narrowly missed out on a place in the OFC Champions League Final on goal difference after going through the group stages unbeaten. A solitary goal was the difference between them and perennial opponents Waitakere United. In the NZFC semi-finals the side defeated Canterbury United 2-1 away in the first leg before suffering a shock 0-3 reversal at home. This upset, only the third loss the side had suffered in 25 matches over the course of the season, was a bitter way to end a campaign which had reached such highs only a few months earlier in Abu Dhabi.\n\nOn another positive note club captain Ivan Vicelich became the first player in the club’s history to play at a FIFA World Cup Finals competition. The All Whites performed outstandingly well in South Africa and Ivan capped off a memorable twelve months by being named the Oceania Footballer of the Year.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 5th\n\nOFC Champions League: Group Stage\n\nASB Premiership: Semi-Finals\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners\n\nSeason 2010/11\n\nSeason 2010/11 saw Auckland CityFC regain it’s status once again as the premier club side in Oceania.\n\nAfter comprehensively winning their group by six clear points from nearest rivals Waitakere United the team met Amicale FC of Vanuatu in the two-legged O-League Final. A hard fought 2-1 victory away in Port Vila in sweltering conditions was followed by a stunning 4-0 win when the two sides met again at Kiwitea Street. This victory saw the club clinch the O-League title for a record third time and gain qualification for the prestigious FIFA Club World Cup Japan 2011.\n\nOn the domestic front the team began the ASB Premiership season slowly as player retirements, unavailability and injury impacted on the side. As the season progressed however the side began to find some outstanding form and hit a purple patch winning ten straight matches as the semi-finals approached. After comfortably dispatching of Team Wellington by 7-2 on aggregate over two legs in the semi-finals the side lined up against old rivals Waitakere United in the Grand Final for the fourth time since the competition commenced in 2004. City had won all three of the previous encounters when the two sides had met in the domestic showpiece final however this run was to come to an end with the side going down 2-3 in an error-ridden final.\n\nThe club gained further accolades during the year, being named as the Sport Auckland Team of the Year for 2010 and also being named by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS) as Oceania’s Club of the First Decade of the 21st Century. A delegation from the club attended the World Football Gala 2011 which was held in Barcelona, Spain and received this prestigious award in the presence of many of the biggest luminaries of the World’s Game.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 7th\n\nOFC Champions League: Winners\n\nASB Premiership: Runners-Up\n\nMinor Premiers: Runners-Up\n\nSeason 2011/12\n\nThe 2011/12 season proved to be another highly successful one for the club.\n\nEarly in the season the team claimed it’s first piece of silverware for the campaign – the ASB Charity Cup. This was a new competition pairing the previous year’s grand final champions against the minor premiers in a one-off matchup. An impressive 3-1 victory away at Waitakere United was a good way to start the campaign as the FIFA Club World Cup Japan 2011 loomed.\n\nIn Japan the side produced a brave performance at Toyota Stadium against Japanese champions Kashiwa Reysol in the opening play-off match of the tournament. The final score was 0-2 with Auckland City unfortunately unable to reproduce their heroics of 2009 in Abu Dhabi. Nevertheless the performance once again had many international onlookers impressed with the continued development being shown by Oceania’s representatives at this prestigious competition.\n\nBack home the side continued their recent domination of football in the Oceania region by defending their OFC Champions League title and gaining qualification for the FIFA Club World Cup Japan 2012 .\n\nFor the first time in the OFC Champions League history the two New Zealand sides were placed in opposing groups and City qualified comfortably for the final with a group match in hand after overcoming Amicale (Vanuatu), Hekari (PNG) and Koloale (Solomon Islands). In somewhat of a surprise City’s perennial rivals Waitakere United missed out to AS Tefana from Tahiti for a place in the final. After a narrow 2-1 victory in the home leg at Kiwitea Street with goals to Daniel Koprivcic and David Mulligan City took only a slender lead to Papeete for the deciding match. The team produced a truly courageous performance when it really counted though. The resulting 1-0 victory came courtesy of a well-worked first half set piece and classy finish by Spanish striker Manel Exposito and the final was won 3-1 on aggregate.\n\nThe domestic season saw the side set a competition record by going through the entire ASB Premiership regular season unbeaten – the first team to achieve this milestone since the competition was formed in 2004. Alas the side was disappointingly defeated 1-4 on aggregate by Team Wellington in a two-legged semi-final play-off thus missing the opportunity to regain the ASB Premiership title. Whilst dominating continental competition for the previous few seasons the side had once again missed out on picking up the domestic silverware and this was the only blot on an otherwise outstanding season.\n\nThe club was once again named as the Sport Auckland Team of the Year for 2011 and club chairman Ivan Vuksich was inducted as a Life Member of New Zealand Football in recognition of his long serving and outstanding contribution to the sport. Vuksich is only the 15th individual to receive this prestigious honour in the 121-year history of the game in this country. He joins fellow Auckland City stalwart Arthur Egan as a member of this elite group that have been honoured by the code’s national body. Ramon Tribulietx was also named as NZ Football’s Coach of the Year for 2011.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 7th\n\nOFC Champions League: Winners\n\nASB Premiership: Semi-Finals\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners\n\nASB Charity Cup: Winners\n\nSeason 2012/13\n\nThe 2012/13 season saw the club create history by becoming the first team in the Oceania region to win the OFC Champions League title for three years straight.\n\nThe format of the competition was changed once again and was held after the end of the domestic season in a stand-alone window running from late March through until mid May. Eight teams were again split into two sections with Auckland City grouped with the Francophone teams AS Mont Dore (New Caledonia) and AS Dragon (Tahiti) along with perennial local rivals Waitakere United.\n\nAfter an excellent start to the group stage with three straight wins the team faltered midway through the competition dropping consecutive home matches to both AS Dragon and Waitakere United. The team’s final group match was played away in Papeete against a very strong AS Dragon side laden with Tahitian internationals. An extremely hard earned draw in very challenging and demanding conditions was just enough to see the team squeeze into the semi-finals as the second-placed team in group B behind Waitakere United.\n\nThe semi-finals were played over two legs and Auckland’s City was paired against the Fijian champions Ba who had convincingly topped group A without losing a match. The opening encounter was played at Kiwitea Street in front of a record-sized crowd numbering in excess of 3,000 patrons. The home team made no race of it however crushing their Fijian opponents 6-1 in a lopsided match. The return leg was a formality with a 1-0 victory away seeing City cruise into the final against a very confident Waitakere United side who had dominated the New Zealand domestic season to that point.\n\nThe final was staged at Mt Smart Stadium and a very focussed Auckland City team dominated the match for long periods before eventually claiming a well deserved 2-1 victory with goals coming from Adam Dickinson and Alex Feneridis.\n\nOn the domestic front the competition was once again dominated by the two Auckland sides with each only losing one match during the round-robin phase of the competition. Auckland City comfortably eased past Canterbury United 5-2 on aggregate in their two-legged semi-final encounter and this set up another finals clash with traditional foes Waitakere United. The final was a nail biting affair with a ten-man Auckland City seemingly heading to victory after taking a 3-2 lead with only minutes left on the clock after goals from Manel Exposito (2) and Chris Bale. Alas it was not meant to be as Waitakere United equalised in the 90th minute before sealing a 4-3 win after extra-time.\n\nJust prior to Christmas the side took a break from their ASB Premiership schedule to represent the Oceania Football Confederation at the FIFA Club World Cup Japan 2012. For the second year running the team was paired against the Japanese J League Champions - represented by Sanfrecce Hiroshima - in the opening play-off match of the tournament. Auckland City delivered another brave and credible performance at FIFA’s showpiece event for clubs with their 0-1 defeat seeing them depart the tournament with heads held high. Many notable onlookers commented favourably on the technical and tactical strides the side had made over the past six years since their debut at the tournament in 2006.\n\nThe club also won the ASB National Youth League title for the third time in it’s history making it the first team to achieve this honour since the inception of this competition and Ramon Tribulietx capped off a memorable season by being named as Sport Auckland’s Coach of the Year for 2012.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 7th\n\nOFC Champions League: Winners\n\nASB Premiership: Runners-Up\n\nMinor Premiers: Runners-Up\n\nASB Charity Cup: Runners-Up\n\nSeason 2013/14\n\nThe 2013/14 season saw the club complete an unprecedented clean sweep of domestic honours lifting the treble of ASB Premiership title, ASB minor premiership and ASB Charity Cup trophies, a triumph that included a record 8-1 semi-final aggregate win over arch-rivals and defending champions Waitakere United over two legs. In a tightly contested grand final, Auckland City FC triumphed 1-0 over Team Wellington at Kiwitea Street, to confirm its first domestic national club title since 2009.\n\nThat achievement went alongside Auckland City FC's record fourth consecutive Oceania title, a victory that was far from straightforward with the team nearly eliminated at the group stage, before edging a nervy semi-final victory over Tahitian champions AS Pirae over two legs. The Kiwi champions completed the quadruple by beating Amicale 3-2 on aggregate in the final in a match where goalkeeper Tamati Williams saved a penalty in the second leg that set-up a thrilling finale when Emiliano Tade notched the decisive goal three minutes from the end of a memorable season.\n\nTo top off a stellar year at Kiwitea Street the club’s Academy side also claimed the ASB National Mens’ Youth League title for a record fourth time thus ensuring the club’s trophy cabinet was indeed brimming at season’s end.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 7th\n\nOFC Champions League: Winners\n\nASB Premiership: Winners\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners\n\nASB Charity Cup: Winners\n\nSeason 2014/15\n\nLast season, Auckland City FC enjoyed its highest ever placing at the FIFA Club World Cup by winning the bronze medal after a penalty shoot-out win over CONCACAF champions Cruz Azul. The Navy Blues had earlier beaten Tetouan Moghreb on penalties in the playoff round before downing CAF Champions League winners ES Setif 1-0 in the quarter-finals.\n\nA narrow 2-1 defeat to CONMEBOL champions San Lorenzo in extra-time bundled the New Zealand champions out of the competition at the semi-finals, within touching distance of a FIFA Club World Cup Final against Real Madrid. Skipper Ivan Vicelich was honoured with the competition's Bronze Ball award behind Sergio Ramos and Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid while Tim Payne and John Irving also picked up Man of the Match Awards.\n\nOn the regional scene the Navy Blues won the inaugural OFC President's Cup beating Amicale 2-1 in the final at Trusts Arena in West Auckland and then made it five continental titles in a row by beating Team Wellington on penalties in the OFC Champions League Final in Suva, Fiji. The win equalled Real Madrid's record of five consecutive continental titles set in the 1950s.\n\nThe season trophy haul was completed with an ASB Premiership Grand Final victory over Hawke's Bay United at Kiwitea Street making it the club's sixth domestic title in 11 seasons and their first successful title defence since 2005/06 season. The club was also shortlisted for a Halberg Award.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 3rd\n\nOFC Champions League: Winners\n\nOFC President's Cup: Winners\n\nASB Premiership: Winners\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners\n\nASB Charity Cup: Runners-Up\n\nSeason 2015/16\n\nAuckland City FC gave up its ASB Premiership crown to Team Wellington in a thrilling grand final at QBE Stadium by 4-2 after extra time. The disappointment came as the Navy Blues completed a seventh minor premiership title and regained the ASB Charity Cup with a comfortable win over Team Wellington on the opening day of the season. Defeat to Sanfrecce Hiroshima by 2-0 in the Club World Cup playoff was a tough pill to swallow. The highpoint of the season was undoubtedly the club's sixth OFC Champions League title in a row - a new world record for consecutive continental championships by any club in any equivalent competition. The ease with which the Navy Blues accounted for Team Wellington gave a degree of comfort as another FIFA Club World Cup qualification was confirmed.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 7th\n\nOFC Champions League: Winners\n\nASB Premiership: Runners-up\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners\n\nASB Charity Cup: Winners\n\nSeason 2016/17\n\nThis campaign proved one of the most arduous in the club's history with well over 40 matches played between September and May in five domestic and international competitions. The Stirling Sports Premiership was expanded to ten teams and the Navy Blues responded by winning the minor premiership for a record fourth season in a row to secure qualification for the OFC Champions League 2018. Once again the grand final proved a disappointment as Team Wellington defeated the Navy Blues 2-1 at QBE Stadium on a wet night in Albany.\n\nThe club added another domestic trophy to the collection when the Navy Blues defeated Team Wellington 3-1 at David Farrington Park to lift the NZF Charity Cup. The FIFA Club World Cup campaign was again a relative success with a narrow 2-1 defeat to Kashima Antlers. Auckland City FC opened the scoring to stun the home side but unable to hang onto that lead, Kashima scored the winning goal scored on the final whistle. International friendlies were a highlight. Wins over Hong Kong Rangers, Central Sport, Kitchee SC and FC Seoul in friendly games and then the Nike Lunar New Year Cup in January ensured the club's reputation continues to grow around the world.\n\nThe club added another domestic trophy to the collection when the Navy Blues defeated Team Wellington 3-1 at David Farrington Park to lift the NZF Charity Cup.\n\nThe OFC Champions League was successfully defended after a 5-0 aggregate win over New Zealand champions Team Wellington. This gave the Navy Blues their seventh consecutive regional title in a row and their ninth overall. Importantly, it also provided qualification for the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2017.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 7th\n\nNike Lunar New Year Cup: Winners\n\nOFC Champions League: Winners\n\nStirling Sports Premiership: Runners-up\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners\n\nCharity Cup: Winners\n\nSeason 2017/18\n\nThe 2017/18 campaign proved to be a season of contrasting emotions as the club set a new record for most National League titles won after they defeated Team Wellington in the grand final at QBE Stadium to reverse back-to-back finals defeats to the capital men. Callum McCowatt's late goal sealed Auckland City FC's victory and a seventh domestic title to alongside their ninth minor premiership title and their fifth in a row.\n\nIn a portent to come, the NZF Charity Cup won for the fourth time the season before was surrendered to Team Wellington in a 3-1 defeat in the capital. On the international scene the theme of mixed emotions continued after a heartbreaking 1-0 defeat to Al Jazira in the FIFA Club World Cup in UAE.\n\nVery rarely has Auckland City FC utterly dominated an opponent in the fashion the Navy Blues managed against Al Jazira without winning a game yet sadly this proved to be the case in a 1-0 defeat. Lifting themselves for the second half of the season would also prove difficult as Auckland City FC's bid for an eighth consecutive OFC Champions League title hit the buffers after losing out on away goals to Team Wellington at the semi-final stages. Club Player of the Year Cam Howieson won an international recall making a start for the All Whites in their 1-0 defeat to Canada under new coach Fritz Schmid.\n\nHowieson and Te Atawhai Hudson-Wihongi, who proved he was back to full fitness, each won an additional three caps for the All Whites in matches against India, Chinese Taipei and Kenya in June. Solomon Islands' international Micah Lea'alafa showed how valuable an asset he can be when he netted for his country in their 2-2 draw with the All Whites in a FIFA World Cup qualifier on September 5, 2017.\n\nThere were important individual milestones reached with Emiliano Tade becoming the most prolific goalscorer in Auckland City FC history with 107 goals in 162 appearances in all competitions while Albert Riera reached the 100 appearance mark in the 0-0 draw with UAE side Al-Ittihad.\n\nTade, Ryan De Vries and Daewook Kim all left the club at different times after picking up professional contracts in South Africa, Japan and Korea Republic, continuing the club's tradition of providing a pathway from domestic football to a full-time career in the sport. FIFA Club World Cup: 7th\n\nOFC Champions League: Semi-finals\n\nISPS Handa Premiership: Winners\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners\n\nCharity Cup: Runners-up\n\nSeason 2018/19\n\nThe Navy Blues made a great start to the season by winning back the NZF Charity Cup with a thrilling 4-3 victory over Team Wellington at Kiwitea Street on the opening day of the new campaign but the season would end with the club enduring it's worst trophy return since 2007-08.\n\nA record undefeated run in the ISPS Handa Premiership comprising of 17 wins and a draw from 18 matches set a new points total record and a tenth minor premiership but defeat to Team Wellington in the semi-finals sent a shock through the club. A similar fate was bestowed on the Navy Blues when they came unstuck in the OFC Champions League semi-finals for the second season in a row after they lost 2-1 to AS Magenta in a nervous performance in Noumea.\n\nFailure to qualify for the FIFA Club World Cup 2019 was a blow but also failing to reach and win the ISPS Handa Premiership could set the club further back following a revamp to the global showpiece event in 2021. The club did participate in another international tournament when they returned to Hong Kong for the Tonghai Financial New Year Cup where the Navy Blues finished fourth after a semi-final loss to Shandong Luneng (2-1) was followed by a 1-0 defeat against a Hong Kong League XI in the bronze medal match.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: Did Not Qualify OFC Champions League: Semi-finalists\n\nISPS Handa Premiership: Semi-Finalists\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners\n\nCharity Cup: Winners\n\nTonghai Financial New Year Cup: Fourth\n\nSeason 2019/20\n\nUnder new coach Jose Figueira, the Navy Blues continued on winning ways but the outbreak of a global pandemic, Covid-19, saw New Zealand Football cancel the ISPS Handa Premiership season after just 16 rounds. The ISPS Handa Premiership minor title and trophy, normally reserved for the grand final winners, was awarded to Auckland City FC for a record eighth time, making it 11 minor titles. Club chairman Ivan Vuksich said winning the title with four games left to play without completing the season meant the victory was a hollow one but accepted the circumstances that the public health situation was the priority.\n\nFigueira won his first trophy as Navy Blues head coach when his outfit defeated defending New Zealand champions Eastern Suburbs AFC 2-0 in the NZF Charity Cup final at Madills Farm on Sunday March 15, 2020. The OFC Chamions League was also affected by the global pandemic with Auckland City FC reaching the quarter-finals thanks to three wins from three in the group stage held in Tahiti only to see the last eight postponed until May 6, 2020.\n\nThe future of the FIFA Club World Cup remains in doubt with the latest edition, the seven club event scheduled for December 2020 in Qatar, facing postponement or cancellation. The expanded FIFA Club World Cup scheduled for June-July 2021 was postponed following UEFA and CONMEBOL's decision to shift their continental championships (Euro 2020 and Copa America 2020) into the June-July 2021 timeslot.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: Did Not Qualify\n\nOFC Champions League: Quarter-finalists.**\n\nISPS Handa Premiership: Winners*\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners*\n\nCharity Cup: Winners\n\nSeason 2020-21\n\nThe final edition of the ISPS Handa Premiership proved to be a damp squib after Auckland City FC lost the grand final to Team Wellington 4-2 after extra time. The club's record in grand finals football took another battering with Team Wellington's victory their third in six seasons leaving the Navy Blues with just one title during that period. It was the club's eighth defeat out of its previous 11 knock-out matches, the worst of any club in either National League of OFC Champions League history.\n\nOffsetting that awful record is Auckland City FC's dominance by perhaps the one measure many find to be a far more accurate gauge of success - the league title. The club wrapped up its eighth consecutive league title and scooped up its seventh NZF Charity Cup. This was the club's 12th league title and solidified its reputation as the most decorated club of all-time in National League history. The league title and NZF Charity Cup double was the club's seventh.\n\nWith the world gripped by the effects of the global pandemic, the OFC Champions League was cancelled outright while an invitation to attend the FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar was accepted. That invitation had to be rescinded after the New Zealand Government was unable to grant Auckland City FC appropriate Managed Isolation & Quarantine facilities on its return to the country.\n\nThe club ended the 2020/21 season awarded the IFHHS Oceania Club of the Decade for 2011-2020, the second decade in a row Auckland City FC have achieved such status.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: Withdrew due to Covid-19 restrictions\n\nOFC Champions League: No competition due to Covid-19 restrictions\n\nISPS Handa Premiership: Runners-up\n\nMinor Premiers: Winners*\n\nCharity Cup: Winners\n\nSeason 2021\n\nThe ISPS Handa Premiership was replaced by New Zealand Football's new National League System with Waitakere United, Hawke's Bay United, Team Wellington, Tasman United, Canterbury United and Southern United all leaving senior competition. Auckland City FC, Eastern Suburbs AFC and Hamilton Wanderers all took up positions in their respective regional league.\n\nThe new system closely resembles the Superclub competition of the 1990s with clubs competing in Northern, Central and Southern Leagues, with the top four from Northern, top three from Central and two from Southern joining the Wellington Phoenix Reserves in a single round final National League Championship competition. The top two from the National League Championship league section advance to a grand final.\n\nNew Zealand Football has two approaches to determining its qualifier or qualifiers for the OFC Champions League. If OFC allocates one berth, the winner of the grand final claims it; if OFC allocates two berths, the winner of the grand final and the grand final runner-up claim one each.\n\nAuckland City FC competed in the Northern League and Chatham Cup for the first time in its history in the inaugural season of the new National League system. The club also entered a team into the Lotto NRFL U-23 Premier Division with four teams joining the Northern Regional Football (NRF) age grade system for teams aged U-13 to U-17.\n\nThe club won the Northern League title with four games to spare and were knocked out of the Chatham Cup at the quarter-final stage by Miramar Rangers.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: Nominated but withdrew.\n\nOFC Champions League: Cancelled\n\nNational League Championship: Cancelled\n\nNorthern League: Champions\n\nChatham Cup: Quarter-finals\n\nSeason 2022\n\nNew coach Albert Riera led his new charges to an incredible season of unprecedented achievement. Riera's team won 30 and drew one of its first 31 games of the 2022 season. The club went on to play 43 matches, winning 39, drawing two and losing only two, in all competitions.\n\nAuckland City FC retained its Northern League title at a canter to secure qualification to the National League Championship phase of the season held between October and December. The club secured its first ever Chatham Cup title with City defeating Albany United (6-1), Manukau United (6-0), Bay Olympic (2-1), Dunedin City Royals (6-0), Wellington Olympic (3-1) and Eastern Suburbs (1-0) in the final at North Harbour Stadium. The club's tenth OFC Champions League title was secured after wins over Hienghene Sport (5-0), Rewa (3-0), Nikao Sokattak (4-1), Central Coast (2-0) and Tahiti's AS Venus (3-0) in the final to give City three trophies by the end of September.\n\nThe club finished top of the National League Championship to claim the league title before defeating Wellington Olympic 3-2 in the final to make it a clean sweep of five available honours - National League Championship, National League Championship league title, Northern League league title, Chatham Cup and the OFC Champions League. The men's first team also won the Mediterannean Cup, a trophy put up for competition between Auckland City FC and Wellington Olympic. City faced Olympic three times in 2022, winning each match (2-1 and 3-2 in the National League Championship) and 3-1 in the Chatham Cup semi-final.\n\nElsewhere at Kiwitea Street, the U-23 side retained their Lotto NRFL U-23 Premier Division title, the Women's U-17 finished runners-up in the NZF Youth Futsal Championship in Wellington.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: Qualified as OFC Champions League winners.\n\nOFC Champions League: Winners\n\nNational League Championship: Winners\n\nNational League Championship title: Winners\n\nNorthern League: Winners\n\nChatham Cup: Winners\n\nSeason 2023\n\nThe campaign started on January 3, 2023, and ended on December 12, 2023, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, following a 3-0 defeat to Al Ittihad at the FIFA Club World Cup Saudi Arabia 2023, the longest season in 19 years for Auckland City FC.\n\nThe domestic campaign was successful on the regional front with the club successfully defending its Northern League crown with an undefeated season and securing its 12th league title in a row. City became the first club since 1965 to complete the regional premier season undefeated, although Metro FC achieved similar in the Superclub era.\n\nThe 100th edition of the Chatham Cup was surrendered in a 3-2 defeat to Western Springs in Round 4, while City would go on to finish runners-up in both the National League Championship Final and league phase to worthy winners Wellington Olympic.\n\nThe Greeks also won the Mediterranean Cup for the first time in the modern era.\n\nHighlight of the season was the club's extraordinary achievement in winning the OFC Champions League for the 11th time after a thrilling penalty kicks win over Ifira Black Bird in an epic semi-final and an extra time win over Fiji's Suva, 4-2.\n\nThe U-23 side won the Lotto NRFL U-23 Premier Division title for the third time in a row while the club fielded three women's futsal teams at the nation's final domestic Youth Futsal Championship in Wellington with the U-17 women's team winning their competition.\n\nThe club's U-15 boy's finished a respectable runners-up.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: Qualified as OFC Champions League winners.\n\nOFC Champions League: Winners\n\nNational League Championship: Runners-Up\n\nNational League Championship title: Runners-Up\n\nNorthern League: Winners\n\nChatham Cup: Round 4\n\nAUCKLAND CITY FC - CLUB HONOURS"
