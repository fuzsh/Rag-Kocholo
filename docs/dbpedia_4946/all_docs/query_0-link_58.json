The system previously had a path from grassroots to the top flight but that stopped in 2004 with the New Zealand Football Championship being created as a replacement to the former New Zealand National Soccer League.\n\nThe current top flight of New Zealand Football is the National League, entering its inaugural season in 2021.\n\nThe top 4 Divisions of the Northern Region Football leagues for both men and women (Tiers 2–5) will be restructured for the 2023 season.\n\nCups[]\n\nThe premier cup competition in New Zealand is the Chatham Cup which dates back to 1923.\n\nRegional cup competitions are also run within federations, allowing multiple teams from the same club to enter.\n\nMen's structure[]\n\nClubs at the top of the pyramid are only permitted to enter a single team in their confederation's higher levels. Other teams from the same club are permitted to enter teams below this threshold, but have restrictions on promotion. Clevedon FC are currently the lowest ranked 1st team in the country, playing in NRF South Division 10 (Tier 15).\n\nWomen's structure[]\n\nLevel League(s)/division(s)\n\n1\n\nNew Zealand Women's National League\n\n8 clubs\n\n3\n\nNRF Women's Championship\n\n11 clubs – 0–1 promotions, 2 relegations\n\nWaiBOP W-League\n\n6 clubs – 0–1 promotions\n\nCentral Women's Federation League\n\n5 clubs\n\nWomen's Capital Premier\n\n8 clubs – 1 promotion, 1 relegation\n\nCanterbury Women's Championship League 1 – 11 clubs\n\nNelson Women's Premiership Division 1 – 11 clubs\n\nMarlborough Women's Social League – 3 clubs\n\nOtago Division One – 6 clubs\n\nSouthland Kolk Cup – 7 clubs\n\n4\n\nNRF Women's Northland Division 1 – 5 clubs\n\nNRF Women's Division 1 – 8 clubs\n\nWaikato Women's Division 1 – 8 clubs\n\nWomen's Bay League Division 1 – 9 clubs\n\nManawatu Premiership – 6 clubs\n\nWhanganui Kelly Hiroa League – 8 clubs\n\nHawke's Bay Women's Division 1 – 5 clubs\n\nGisborne Eastern League – 6 clubs\n\nTaranaki Women's Premiership – 12 clubs\n\nCapital Women's 1 – 10 clubs\n\nCanterbury Championship League 2 – 6 clubs\n\nOtago Division Two – 8 clubs\n\n5\n\nNRF Northland Women's Division 2 – 6 clubs\n\nNRF Women's Division 2 – 10 clubs\n\nWaikato Women's Division 2 – 9 clubs\n\nManawatu Women's Championship – 6 clubs\n\nHawkes Bay Women's Division 2 – 7 clubs\n\nCapital Women's 2 – 10 clubs\n\n—\n\n6\n\nNRF Harbour Division 3 – 7 clubs\n\nNRF Central Division 3 – 9 clubs\n\n—\n\nCapital Women's 3 – 11 clubs\n\n—\n\n7\n\nNRF Harbour Division 4 – 10 clubs\n\nNRF Central Division 4 – 8 clubs\n\n—\n\nWairarapa League – 4 clubs\n\n—\n\n8\n\nNRF Central Division 5 – 7 clubs\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nTemplate:New Zealand National League\n\nTop level football leagues of Oceania – (OFC)\n\nAmerican Samoa · Cook Islands · Fiji · New Caledonia · New Zealand · Niue† · Palau† · Papua New Guinea · Samoa · Solomon Islands · Tahiti · Tonga · Tuvalu† · Vanuatu\n\nOther leagues: Kiribati\n\n† Associated members\n\nTemplate:Football in Oceania"
