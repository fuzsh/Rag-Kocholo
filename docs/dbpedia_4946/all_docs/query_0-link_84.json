        "text": "CELEBRATING FOUR GENERATIONS\n\n​​​​​​​\n\nIn 2019, Marco Bertos, at the age of 6, became the first player of the fourth generation to the Club and will be carrying on the family name for many years to come.\n\nMarco's great-grandfather, Leonidas Bertos, played a huge role when the Club was under the banner of CYFC in 1959 as a coach and selector of the 1st team.\n\nGrandad (Papou), George Bertos Snr, had played for the Club since his teenage years and once he hung up his boots as a player, George turned his hand to one of coaching, selector and manager for the 1st team during the golden era of the 1990s. George continues to be involved with the Club behind the scenes.\n\nDad Adam Bertos continues to play and coach (currently with Olympic 4ths), as well as coaching Junior teams over the past four years, and is currently coaching the U10 Kronos team.\n\nInitially called \"Apollon\", the Greeks first kicked off in the Wellington divisions in 1953. Made up by the Romanian Greek immigrants who arrived to New Zealand in 1951/52, the club started with two teams finding great success and quickly promoted up the ladders. The club disbanded in 1956, giving way to a new club which was formed in 1958 by the late Father Elias Economou under the name CHRISTIAN YOUTH FOOTBALL CLUB (CYFC). To this day, Apollon continues to be part of the club's history.\n\nCYFC first took to the field in 1959 and, like Apollon, were commonly referred to as \"the Greeks\". The first co-selectors for CYFC were Leonidas Bertos (who was also the coach) and the Atha Giovanidis.\n\nA quick note of thanks...\n\nA number of members have held a variety of positions within the Club including Jim Christie who joined the club in 1961 and wore almost every hat - President/VicePresident/Secretary/Treasurer/ Selector/ Player for GOYANZ, and Co-Chairman and Committee member of the Wellington Olympic sub-committee. Alongside him, Dimitrios (Jim) Androutsos was a pivotal figure within the Club as a Coach/Manager/Selector/Player/Committee Member for over three decades. Steve Stefanatos is another who, for many years was a backbone of guidance and authority for the Club and who's knowledge of the club is still sought after and treasured to this day.\n\nThere are so many from the past to thank who from CYFC days and throughout Olympic years have made such a contribution, including (but not limited to) Mario Kotsapas, Tony and Jim Kotrotsos, Con and Chris Palamidas, Chris Papanicolaou and Nick Androutsos.\n\nAlso of mention are Peter Halikias, John Serepisos, Nina Bertos-Papadopoulos (continues to be on the committee), George Carras, Chrisanthi Kamberogiannis and Nick Halikias for their long service and continued committment to the Club from CYFC days, each holding a number of positions within the Club as players, coaches, managers, selectors and officers of both GOYANZ and the Olympic sub-committee for the better part of four decades and who still work tirelessly behind the scenes. Nor can we pass over the continuing services of Paul Kotrotsos, Basil Bouzoukis, Maki Halikias, Demetre Kotrotsos and Jonathan Kotrotsos.\n\nHistory continued....\n\nAs CYFC, in 1964 they entered the Central League (formed 1963) in Division 3.\n\nSome of the players that played in the early years were:-\n\n4x Bertos brothers: Leonidas, Vasso, Laki, Taki, together with young Chris (son of Leonidas)\n\n3x Zaloumis: Taki, Sandy and John\n\n2x Androutsos: Taki and Nick\n\n2x Christies: Jim and Costa\n\n(That was one team taken care of)\n\nBasil Kiourktsidis, George Moutzouris, Laki Kaloyianni, Nick Paraskevopoulos, Chris Papanicoloau, John Leonidas and many others.\n\nWhen we entered the Central League we also appointed our 1st non-Greek coach, Billy Wright, who then played for Diamonds and Wellington and he brought Jeff and Wally Allen, Tony Kislick (Coronation Street) Atha Coventry and others.\n\nCYFC was promoted to Central League Division 2 in 1970 in which it spent four seasons until the team was relegated into Division 3 for the 1975 season. CYFC spent two seasons in Division 3 where it won promotion in 1976 to Central 2 under the guidance of coach Ray Janes. The following year CYFC won promotion to Central League Division 1 for the first time in their history. They finished top of the table by six clear points, losing only one game in the process. CYFC's stay in the top Central division was short lived as it only lasted a year where they finished bottom of the table.\n\nIn 1959, CYFC (the Greek Community) had very few expenses to pay for the privilege of having a football team. There were only registration fees, which were paid once a year (transfer fees were 2 shillings and 6 pence (25c).\n\nThe 1st CYFC dance was held on Queen's Birthday Sunday in 1963 at the Parthenon Hall. The dance committee consisted of Jim Christie, Eleftherios (Lefty) Kondos and Basil Kiourksidis. All the food was donated by the many Greeks in lieu of money.\n\nOnce GOYANZ was incorporated and took over all the responsibility for the Youth programmes, activities and sports on behalf of the Greek Community, the Miss GOYANZ Dance was held annually on Queen's Birthday weekend\n\n​​​​​​​\n\nIn 1981 they failed to survive the higher grade once agian after being promoted from Div 2, CYFC made an immediate return to Div 2 football for the 1982 season. The only highlight of the 1981 season came in the opening game where CYFC beat eventual champions Napier 2-0 - something none of the other ten clubs were able to achieve.\n\nIn 1982 coach Peter Halikias helped guide the team to another Div two championship regaining first division status they lost the previous year. In 1983 CYFC changed its name to Wellington Olympic and were coached by Paul Norfolk. The team finished fourth but conceded far too many goals to have any real chance of challenging for the title.\n\nIn 1985 Olympic found themselves in farmiler teritory and were relegated to Div two. The following year Olympic cleaned up the Div two title. They were the only unbeaten side in any of the three Centtral League divisions. Second place was a distant 12 points behind them whilst thrid was another 12 points back. They scored a massive 59 goals which at the time was a record for the division. Only Lower Hutt (1985) had socred more than 50 goals and their total was reached in 22 games compared with Olympic's 20.\n\nFrom 1987 Olympic proved itself as a Division One mainstay as it consistantly finished in the top 4 until 1993 when the SuperClub competition was intorduced. The only exception was in 1989 where they finished eightth. The main highlight of six year Division One campaign was winning it in 1991. The team was coached by former player and stalwart George Bertos. George secured the services of Imre Foldi the previous year and Andre Racz in 1991. Between them they scored 28 goals.\n\nThe year started strongly, but a defeat to Miramar broke the unbeaten record from the year before, as well as a first round Chatham Cup exit to Wellington United made for some disappointing reading for the club and its supporters.\n\nAs the year went on the team went from strength to strength, visiting Miramar Rangers for the return match at Dave Farrington Park for the top of the league clash, Miramar holding a slim lead at the top. Olympic had not beaten Miramar away from home for over 10 years, when a young Leo Bertos was playing and scored the winner on the day to win 3-2 in the old North Island League. Olympic came out of the blocks strongly and went on to win the game 3-0 to the cheers of our away supporters.With one game to go, Olympic had to wait a week before playing Lower Hutt in a title deciding game.\n\nWhile waiting for this game Miramar Rangers played Petone to keep the pressure up on the blue boys. With minutes to go, Petone scored a late winner which meant Olympic had been crowned champions of the Central League for the first time since 1991, with a game in hand. Olympic then went on to beat Lower Hutt in the final match and the wild celebrations began."
