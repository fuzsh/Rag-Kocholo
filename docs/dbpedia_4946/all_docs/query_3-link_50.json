        "text": "Teams play either at the indoor venue at Kilbirnie’s Ākau Tangi Sports Centre or outdoors at the Hataitai netball courts on Saturdays.\n\nThe time of day and venue depends on the grade in which the team is placed. School teams play in Collegiate grades against other school teams except our top 4 teams, which play in the Women’s Premier Competition.\n\nPremier teams playing at Ākau Tangi season dates are Saturday 27 April to Saturday 31 August. College teams playing at Ākau Tangi and Hataitai Courts season dates are Saturday 4 May to 24 August.\n\nNo games Kings Birthday weekend - 1 June – all teams\n\nNo games Matariki Weekend – 29 June – all teams\n\nNo games Holidays - 13 July – all teams\n\nNo games - 20 July - Collegiate teams (Prem teams still playing)\n\nFinal games - Collegiate Grades 24 August, Prem grades 31 August\n\nSenior A\n\n16 May– CSW Senior A Premier Tournament, Ākau Tangi Kilbirnie\n\n24 June – RSSL Starts for the Senior A (26 August – CSW RSSL Finals, Ākau Tangi Kilbirnie)\n\n11 September - Winter Sports Exchange at East\n\n1 - 5 September, LNISS Netball Tournament, Napier\n\nJunior A\n\n8 August – CSW Junior A Tournament, Ākau Tangi Kilbirnie\n\nSenior A, Senior B dresses are supplied. Senior C, 11A and Junior A, tops supplied and the player’s own black skirt.\n\nAll other teams black skirts and black and gold WGC PE sports shirt, white socks and supportive shoes.\n\nBibs, balls and gear bags are supplied to all teams and must be returned at the end of the season.\n\nThe first selection process for Year 9s and 10s starts with a Drills and Skills session in Trial #1. A number of simple netball drills will be run covering Body Balance, Catching and Passing, Driving, Change of Direction and Decision Making. This session then gives a platform for the second trial which will be game based.\n\nOn the registration form, girls have been asked for their favourite 2 positions and a 3rd position is optional. In trial #2, students are put into trial teams in their first position where possible. The same 14 girls are kept on the court for about 30 minutes. With about 10 minutes to go, selectors stop the game and ask if girls would like to trial at another position. Two courts run at the same time and a moderator moves between courts to ensure the selectors are marking at the same level.\n\nThere is plenty of movement between grades from year to year, as girls often grow, become more coordinated and “find their feet” from season to season.\n\nThe netball convenors then put provisional teams together according to the grading. The Junior trials (Year 9 and 10) are completed with a mini tournament at WGC where girls are looked at again. Movement still occurs at this stage as we tweak teams.\n\nSelectors\n\nWe use a number of very experienced selectors. If they are parents, they will not be grading their daughters in any regard. Girls get seen by a variety of selectors over the course of the trial process\n\nSeniors\n\nTrials will be held for the following Senior teams only:\n\nSenior A (Open to all year levels. Note - this team plays at a very high level)\n\nSenior B (Open to Year 11, 12 & 13s)\n\nSenior C (Open to Year 12 & 13s)\n\nTrial #1 Thursday 22 February, 3.45pm – 5.30pm - Brook Court\n\nTrial #2 Saturday 24 February, 9am – Noon - Gym 1\n\nPlease attend both trials.\n\nTuesday 27 February, Final trial (Invitees only) 3.30pm – 5pm Brook Court\n\nYears 12 & 13\n\nAny seniors (Year 12 & 13) who are not selected for one of the 3 teams above, have the option to enter their own Social Competitive team (see information below).\n\nYear 11\n\nAny Year 11 is eligible to trial for the Senior A & B teams if they feel they can play at this level. Students who are not selected in either the Senior A or the B team, will need to attend the Year 11 trials as listed below\n\nNOTE DATE CHANGES\n\nTrial #1 Monday, 11 March 3.30pm – 5.30pm Brook Court / Turf\n\nTrial #2 Wednesday, 13 March 3.30pm – 5.30pm Brook Court / Turf\n\nPlease meet on Brook wet or fine. Please attend both trials.\n\nYear 10\n\nAny Year 10 is eligible to trial for the Senior A team if they feel they can play at this high level. Students who are not selected in the Senior A, will need to attend the Year 10 trials as listed below.\n\nTrial #1 Saturday 2 March, meet in Gym 1, 1pm – 4pm\n\nThis first trial will be a Skills and Drills session (Students will be asked to attend 1pm – 2.30pm or 2.30pm - 4pm). Students will be split alphabetically.\n\nTrial #2 Saturday 16 March, meet in Gym 1, 1pm – 4pm\n\nPlease attend both trials and the WGC Junior Grading Tournament 8.30am – 12.30pm Saturday 23 March\n\nYear 9\n\nAny Year 9 is eligible to trial for the Senior A team if they feel they can play at this very high level. Students who are not selected in the Senior A, will need to attend the Year 9 trials as listed below.\n\nTrial #1 Saturday 2 March, meet in Gym 1\n\nThis first trial will be a Skills and Drills session (Students will be asked to attend 9am – 10.30am or 10.30am – Noon) Students will be split alphabetically.\n\nTrial #2 Saturday 16 March, meet in Gym 1, 9am – Noon\n\nPlease attend both trials and the WGC Junior Grading Tournament, 8.30am – 12.30pm Saturday 23 March\n\nJunior A Trial (Year 9 & 10) Monday 18 March, 3.30pm – 5pm (Brook Court) Players to attend this trial will be invited.\n\nJUNIOR GRADING TOURNAMENT – Saturday 23 March 8.30am – 12.30pm\n\nALL Year 9 and 10 netball players are expected to attend this mini tournament. Girls will have already been placed in a provisional team. Teams play 3 games each and all games will be watched by selectors and there will be tweaks to the teams where necessary.\n\nSocial Competitive Netball is for Year 10 to 13 students only. All Year 9s must trial and they will then be placed in a team. Year 10 to 13 students can make up their own team of 10 players (no less) in consultation with the Sports Office. Each team must have a parent manager who will attend all games.\n\nWe encourage Year 12 and 13 players to form Social Competitive teams with friends as it is difficult to get coaches at this level.\n\nSocial Competitive teams play in the same competition and grades as other teams so it is not a “social” team as such.\n\nIt is the responsibility of these teams to find their own coach if they want one. One team form per team needs to be completed by the Captain but each player still needs to complete their own registration form and pay the fee. (Via the Tab - \"Registration Forms\" on the Sports website). Teams will not be entered until all players have registered and paid.Parents/Caregivers\n\nWe are always in need of coaches and managers. Please indicate your interest on your daughter’s registration form. Coaching support is provided before and during the season. Netball Wellington runs excellent coaching courses. See details on their website http://netballwellington.co.nz and register early.\n\nSenior students who wish to coach should register their interest by completing the Coaching section on the Sports Registration form. There will be a few sessions held at school for senior students wanting to coach. Student coaches will be expected to help at the Junior tournament on Saturday 23 March.Umpiring is compulsory for our top 4 teams, if requested by Netball Wellington. If you are a parent who is considering doing some umpiring, please see Netball Wellington’s website for information on their umpiring courses.\n\nIf you are a student umpire and would like to be on our roster, please let the Sports Office know, if you haven’t done so already.\n\nKiwi Whistlers Umpiring Course\n\nWe will be offering a 4 week course for those who want to get into umpiring. After the theory side of things\n\n$180.00\n\nWGC Bank Account Number 03 0518-0027013-002\n\nReference=Student’s name & Sport e.g. Rosie Smith Nball"
