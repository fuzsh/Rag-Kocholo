Our vision is a future where all employees are empowered to work flexibly to drive the best outcomes for our clients. Flexible work is a mindset and a core value. Our employees are encouraged to work remotely two days a week as a standard practice and will have flexibility in terms of working hours.\n\nThe future of Wellington’s workplace will be designed to ensure that we continue to meet our clients’ investment and service expectations, attract a diverse pool of talent, focus on employee well-being and engagement, and preserve and enhance our client-first, collaborative culture.\n\nWe believe that the physical office is an important part of work. It’s a place to innovate, collaborate, and enable face-to-face interactions that inspire and energize our community. Being together is critical for our apprenticeship learning model, talent development, and mentorship. We also believe that there are many complementary benefits of remote work, including focused thinking time and the democratization of voices in a virtual meeting. We have proven that we can operate productively in a remote world while maintaining our strong culture. That’s why we think flexibility is key.\n\nAs we continue to shape our workplace of the future, we will look to our employees to provide input and creative ideas. We are excited about our ability to work together in this new and evolving hybrid work environment, while maintaining our magnetic and collaborative culture — and ultimately delivering investment excellence to our clients and their beneficiaries over the long term."
