        "text": "Hey guys\n\nLooking to do a club and country challenge with New Zealand using wellington Phoenix in the A-league. They are however are not able to participate in the Asian champions league due to being from oceania. They also dont qualify for the oceania champions league due to playing in the A-League. One of the only clubs in the world with 0 chance of participating in a continental competition.\n\nI have looked everywhere but cant seem to find a fix to make wellington eligible for the acl.\n\nDoes anyone know if this is actually possible and if so how do you do it?\n\nThanks for your Help.\n\nMight it be possible by creating a brand new Wellington FC and deleting the other and basically transferring the information over (most likely with a lot of copying and pasting / data entry)? Make sure to set the home country as New Zealand but the continental qualifying country as Australia. That way you might get past any hard-coded rules not allowing Wellington to reach the Champions League.\n\nNote that the last time I used the editor was FM 2013, so if things have changed drastically since then, my idea might not work anyway.\n\nDo post if this works (or you find another way of doing it). I have wanted to try managing them but just could not get past the idea that they could not qualify for the Champions League in either continent and never have.\n\nDear God, somebody other than me has started this thread this year. There's another!\n\nI've been trying to solve this issue for years, Wellington are my favourite (or rather, were) side to manage on FM (been doing it since 08) and no matter where i've posted in the last 3+ years no one has been able to solve the issue. It could be solvable (I.E getting them into the OCL) but no one with the editing know how really seems to give a **** unfortunately. The small reprieve I found was finding a \"Fifa Champions League\" add-on which the nix can qualify for. Ironically enough the more pertinent issue in real life is getting the nix to survive past this current season.\n\nI never tried it, but i think the suggestion of USASoundersFan can be resolutive with an high probability. Creating a new team transferring staff and players, and with the same properties and structures, then swapping it in the A-League at the place of the existing team, can bypass what is hardcoded in the game since the new team will have a different unique ID. I am not sure about that, because there is a probability that the nation New Zealand is hardcoded instead of the specific club in question, but it can be a test to try\n\nYeah this is my holy grail, unfortunately I'm useless with the editor. There was a very kind user that made a file for me where Nix would automatically enter O-League, but even after winning it they couldn't qualify for Club World Cup, hard-coding seems really powerful... See post No.13 in this thread http://community.sigames.com/showthread.php/442784-FM16-Oceania-League-Pack-(WIP)\n\nI also tried in the past the suggestion of copying/replacing the club, but I somehow messed up most of staff members (board directors becoming coaches etc), players wages and club value despite spending hours copy-pasting the correct numbers, though as I said I'm awful at editing...\n\nthere is a probability that the nation New Zealand is hardcoded instead of the specific club in question\n\nMaybe try replacing New Zealand, creating a new nation and, one way or another, copying all the information over. That might also be a bit easier (less time-consuming) than doing the same for a club, so I would try that first.\n\nWhen you do work on the club files, I would first try deleting (or making inactive) the current Wellington file and create a bare-bones new one, simply to see if this works (well, maybe put something in there to make them good enough to qualify for the ACL as you obviously need that too in order to test this).\n\nOf course, maybe it is hard coded that no club from one confederation can play in the Champions League of another, which would make all this moot.\n\nYeah this is my holy grail, unfortunately I'm useless with the editor.

That CWC issue is *really* weird. Like why would SI hardcode them from entering a competition they had 0 chance of entering without a massive amount of editing? So strange.\n\nIt's pretty ridiculous that we could easily move Barcelona to like the 15th tier of English football but it's nigh on impossible to get The Nix some proper continental football. They shoudl just release an override patch for it."
