Photo: Andy Skinner / Phototek.\n\nOlympic coach Paul Ifill: ‘We are under no illusions’\n\nWellington Olympic head coach Paul Ifill believes his side’s vocal supporters and home advantage can swing the two-legged tie his team’s way.\n\nWriting in the club’s match programme, Ifill said: “Even though we lost (the first leg), I felt that we were always a threat and that the game could have gone either way.\n\n“I always thought that we would have to win at home to progress, and I feel a 1-0 deficit is obtainable if we get things right today with our very vocal supporters behind us.\n\n“We are under no illusion as to the task at hand as we face the most successful club in the country.\n\n“Games of this magnitude are what we as players and staff love, and I can promise we will leave everything out there as\n\nwe try to qualify for a maiden O-League campaign.”\n\nIfill’s final words are to the Olympic fans: “Please get behind the players as I really feel you could be the difference today.”\n\nWhat they’re playing for\n\nThe result over two legs will decide which team represents New Zealand at the OFC Men’s Champions League tournament in Tahiti from May 11-24, 2024.\n\nREAD MORE: Draw made for eight-club OFC Men’s Champions League tournament >>>>\n\nThe winners of the OFC Men’s Champions League will qualify to represent Oceania at a new annual FIFA club competition, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup.\n\nThe first staging of the six-club tournament will be in December.\n\nCity fans to watch game live from clubrooms\n\nAuckland City are hosting a day of football — live and on their television screens — at their Kiwitea Street headquarters.\n\nThe clubrooms will open at 1pm, and spectators will be able to enjoy live football between Central United Presidents XI and Mount Albert Ponsonby for the Brian Stanyer Memorial Trophy at 2pm.\n\nREAD MORE: Clubs get together for annual memorial match to remember Brian ‘Stan’ Stanyer >>>>\n\nThe club will screen the live FIFA+ stream of the OFC Champions League play-off from Wellington (see link below).\n\nFixture\n\nGame to be played on Saturday March 16, 2024\n\nOFC Men’s Champions League\n\nNational play-offs — second leg\n\nWellington Olympic v Auckland City\n\nMartin Luckie Park, Wellington, 2pm\n\nAuckland City lead 1-0 after first leg\n\nREAD MORE: Auckland City claim first leg OFC play-off win against Wellington Olympic >>>>\n\nDownload the match programme\n\nResult\n\nGame played on Saturday March 9, 2024\n\nNational play-offs — first leg\n\nAuckland City 1 (Stipe Ukich 72′)\n\nWellington Olympic 0\n\nSquads"
