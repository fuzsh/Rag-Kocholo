        "text": "New Zealand’s national sport is rugby union, but soccer has been popular since the 1880s, and the New Zealand Soccer Association, now New Zealand Football, was formed in 1891. Over the next 50 years, the country’s involvement in global soccer was mostly confined to matches against Australian teams, although there were visits to New Zealand by teams from China (1924), Canada (1927) and England (1937).\n\nread more\n\nFrom time to time, Cambridge Football Club holds the Cambridge Summer League.

The New Zealand champion was the team that performed the best over the season, with the league working in a similar way to the English Premier League and other European leagues, in that clubs could face relegation or promotion, depending on where they sat at the end of the season. Christchurch United and Mt Wellington were the main winners over the period the league ran.\n\nNew Zealand Football Championship\n\nOn 15 October 2004, the New Zealand Football Championship was launched. Unlike the National Soccer League, the Football Championship does not involve traditional clubs, but new teams created solely to compete in this competition made up of just eight teams. Sharing the Championship win six times each are teams University-Mount Wellington and Christchurch United\n\nFIFA World Cup record\n\nNew Zealand did not enter the FIFA World Cup competition until the Mexico 1970 competition, where it failed to qualify.

The next time New Zealand reached the group stage was in South Africa in 2010, leaving the competition in 22nd place. Having not qualified for Brazil 2014 or Russia 2018, it is yet to be determined if New Zealand will qualify for the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.\n\nNational Women’s League\n\nCanterbury United Pride claimed a fourth National Women’s League title in six years with a 3-2 victory over Northern Lights in December 2018. FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup player Gabi Rennie was key to the win, having a hand in all three goals for the Pride. New Zealand’s women’s team had recently won bronze in the FIFA U-17 World Cup before returning to New Zealand to await selection for the Grand Final of the Champions League.\n\nOCF championship titles\n\nIn 2018, New Zealand claimed a fifth OCF championship title in six attempts at U-19 level to earn a place at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Poland 2019. The September 2018 OCF U-16 Championship final saw New Zealand beat Solomon Islands 4-5. The December 2018 OFC Women's Nations Cup final saw New Zealand beat Fiji a resounding 8-0. The OFC Champions League 2019 semi-finals on 28 April 2019 will see Team Wellington play against Hienghène Sport and Auckland City FC will play against AS Magenta"
