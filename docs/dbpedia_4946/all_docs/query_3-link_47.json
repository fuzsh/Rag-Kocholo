        "text": "The Wellington Polo Tour is gearing up for the upcoming 2023 season in Wellington and we are looking forward to another great year of 16 goal polo.\n\nAs you may already know, the United States Polo Association and participating clubs have joined up to introduce the Florida Circuit 16-Goal Series. The series will be played across multiple clubs and the championship will be hosted by the National Polo Center (NPC) in Wellington.\n\nThe Wellington Polo Tour is excited to be hosting 2 of the 4 qualifiers for this series (the Ylvisaker Cup and the Iglehart Cup) as well as 2 other 16 goal tournaments, the NPC Inaugural Cup and the Outback Cup.\n\nWe are proud and excited to announce a few new fields for this year. As well as all the great fields from last year, we now also have Coca-Cola, Port Mayaca, Jan Pamela, and NPC Field #1 for a few Sunday polo games. The Wellington Polo Tour team would like to thank all our field owners as this league would not be possible without you!\n\nWe would also like to thank all the teams that have already committed for this year: Beverly Equestrian, BTA, Catamount, Coca-Cola, Dazos, Dundas, G-Squared, Iconica, La Fe, Loudmouth, Old Hickory Bourbon, Palm Beach Equine, Patagones, Santa Clara, SD Farms, Tonkawa.\n\nAs always, our motto is Fair, Competitive, and Fun polo, and we cannot wait to get started at the end of the year.\n\nFeel free to reach out with any questions or concerns,\n\nSee everyone soon!"
