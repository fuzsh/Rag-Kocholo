        "text": "But is it likely?\n\nDon’t make any plans before 9pm. Not only did Sunday’s first leg finish all square but the Phoenix and the Victory played out two 1-1 draws earlier in the season. Only one of their four fixtures this campaign produced a winner – and it came in the 95th minute when a header from defender Finn Surman deflected off an opponent and into the net.\n\nSo another low-scoring draw?\n\nThe first part is almost guaranteed; neither the Phoenix nor Victory have been great entertainers. Across 27 games, Wellington conceded 26 goals to boast the best defence in the competition, while the Victory were third with 33. And at the other end, the Phoenix were tied for ninth in a 12-team league with 42 goals scored, while the Victory nabbed one more. It was no shock when the first game was scoreless, and equally unsurprising when the Phoenix registered no shots on target.\n\nNone? Sounds discouraging...\n\nNever fear, it was all part of the plan. As we don’t have to worry about explaining the away-goals rule, not conceding was the No 1 priority in Melbourne. The Phoenix know their strengths – a rock-solid defence and the best home record in the league – and pragmatically play to them. A clean sheet in the bag, they return to Wellington to be buttressed by the largest crowd in the club’s 17-year existence.\n\nLargest? Sounds encouraging …\n\nIndeed, their previous record was the 32,792 filling the Cake Tin the last time they hosted a semifinal, when Paul Ifill inspired an extra-time win over Newcastle in 2010. On that occasion, the Nix were still a game short of the grand final and summarily lost that game away to Sydney FC. This time, by finishing the regular season in the top two for the first time, they are 90 (probably 120) minutes from the showpiece, and they will be supported at a volume approaching All Whites-Bahrain levels.\n\nAnd that’s why it’s the club’s biggest match?\n\nAnd that’s why it’s the club’s biggest match. The Phoenix made the playoffs in eight of the previous 16 seasons but most commonly fell at the finals’ first hurdle, while all but one of their eliminations came across the Tasman. This team, somewhat improbably, are poised to make history.\n\nWhy improbable?\n\nThis was meant to be a rebuilding season, with a first-year coach guiding a youthful squad brimming with local talent. Instead, Giancarlo Italiano led his young charges to a record of 15 wins, eight draws and four defeats, leaning heavily on a Kiwi core. That’s particularly true of the unshakable defence carrying the Nix this far: along with 20-year-old centre-back Surman, 21-year-old goalkeeper Alex Paulsen has played every minute of the campaign.\n\nDefence wins championships – but what about the stars?\n\nHow about a Rufer? Sure, Alex is a tenacious midfielder, ranked second in the league for tackles that won his side possession, but the skipper is still the nephew of New Zealand’s greatest player. If wanting someone with Wynton’s technical ability, look to another couple of Kiwis at opposite ends of their careers: Ben Old, who is young, and Kosta Barbarouses, who is not."
