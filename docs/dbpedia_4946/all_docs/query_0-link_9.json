Founded in 2004, the New Zealand Football Championship was the successor to a myriad of short-lived football leagues in the country, including the National Soccer League, the National Summer Soccer League and the New Zealand Superclub League. The league was contested by ten teams in a franchise system. For sponsorship reasons, the competition was known as the ISPS Handa Men's Premiership. From the 2021-22 season, it was replaced by the New Zealand National League.\n\nThe seasons used to run from October through to April, and consist of an eighteen-round regular season followed by a playoff series involving the four highest-placed teams, culminating in a Grand Final. Each season, two clubs would gain qualification to the OFC Champions League, the continental competition for the Oceania region. The league does not use a system of promotion and relegation.\n\nAuckland City were the most successful side since the competition's inception, with twelve premierships and seven championship titles. A youth competition, called the National Youth League, ran parallel to the regular season from October to December – the final champions were also Auckland City, winning the final season of the competition in 2019.\n\nCompetition format[]\n\nThere are two stages to the competition; \"The League\" (commonly referred to as \"regular season\") and \"The Championship\" (commonly referred to as \"the playoffs\").\n\nThe two teams that win the league phase (the \"Minor Premier\") and the Grand Final (the \"champion\") qualify for the OFC Champions League. Should the same team win both the Minor Premiership and the Championship, the second Champions League spot is granted to the league runner-up. This has occurred on numerous occasions; the first instance being in 2006 when Auckland City (premiers and champions) and Young Heart Manawatu qualified despite Canterbury United contesting the Grand Final.\n\nThere are no lower divisions in the Premiership, thus no promotion and relegation exists, similar to leagues in Australia and in the United States.\n\nThe League[]\n\nFor the first four seasons, regular season had the teams play each other three times, however, this was changed to the present home-and-away system in 2008, due to financial difficulties affecting some of the clubs. At the end of the regular season, the top four teams progress to the playoffs.\n\nThe Championship[]\n\nThe playoffs are run as a home-and-away semi-finals series, with the winners progressing to a one-match Grand Final.\n\nThe playoff phase in the inaugural season was contested by the top three clubs, whereby the Minor Premier (winner of league phase) received a bye and hosting rights for the grand final, with second and third placed teams playing off in a one-game preliminary final. The NZFC experimented with a five team playoff in the 2005–06 season, however, this was discontinued and the league reverted to the three-team playoff system for the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons.\n\nName changes[]\n\nNapier City Rovers → Hawke's Bay United\n\nOtago United → Southern United\n\nWaikato FC → WaiBOP United\n\nChampions and premiers[]\n\nThe teams that win the league phase (the \"premier\") and the Grand Final (the \"champion\") qualify for the OFC Champions League. Should the same team win both the Premiership and the Championship, the second O-League spot will be granted to league runner-up.\n\nSeason Regular Season Grand Final Premiers Points Runners-up Champions Score Runners-up 2004–05 Auckland City 46 – 40 Waitakere United Auckland City 3 – 2 Waitakere United 2005–06 Auckland City 48 – 46 YoungHeart Manawatu Auckland City 3 – 3 (a.e.t.)\n\n4 – 3 (p.s.o) [[[Canterbury United]] 2006–07 Waitakere United 47 – 45 YoungHeart Manawatu Auckland City 3 – 2 Waitakere United 2007–08 Waitakere United 51 – 50 Auckland City Waitakere United 2 – 0 Team Wellington FC 2008–09 Waitakere United 33 – 25 Auckland City Auckland City 2 – 1 Waitakere United 2009–10 Auckland City 31 – 29 Waitakere United Waitakere United 3 – 1 Canterbury United 2010–11 Waitakere United 36 – 30 Auckland City Waitakere United 3 – 2 Auckland City 2011–12 Auckland City 36 – 29 Canterbury United Waitakere United 4 – 1 Team Wellington FC 2012–13 Waitakere United 37 – 33 Auckland City Waitakere United 4 – 3 (a.e.t.)
