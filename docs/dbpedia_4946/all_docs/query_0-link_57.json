        "text": "Australia and New Zealand won the right to host the ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup following a vote in 2020.\n\nIt is the first time that multiple countries have hosted the tournament and the first time it's been held in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe 2023 tournament has broken the record for tickets sold with almost 1.5 million expected to watch games across Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAround 100,000 combined fans will attend the event's opening-day matches, when New Zealand play 1995 winners Norway at Eden Park and Australia face the Republic of Ireland at Stadium Australia.\n\nThe 32 teams are divided into eight groups of four.\n\nThe top two from each group will qualify for the round of 16 with knockout games to be played from then.\n\nGroup A (world ranking)\n\nNew Zealand (26)\n\nNorway (12)\n\nPhilippines (46)\n\nSwitzerland (20)\n\nNorway are favourites to top the group, the highest ranked team in the group has played at all eight World Cups winning in 1995 and beaten in the final of the inaugural event in 1991. The two-time European champions have declined since then but still managed to reach the quarter-finals at the last tournament. Switzerland are a team on the rise and will be expecting to progress from the group. New Zealand has struggled to score goals in recent matches, but with a big crowd behind them a couple of draws and a win over The Philippines would put them in contention for the next round. The Philippines will play in their first World Cup, having made the Asian Cup semi-finals last year.\n\nGroup A matches: (NZ time)\n\n20 July 7pm New Zealand v Norway, Eden Park, Auckland\n\n21 July 5pm Philippines v Switzerland, Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin\n\n25 July 5:30pm New Zealand v Philippines, Wellington Regional Stadium, Wellington\n\n8pm Switzerland v Norway, Waikato Stadium, Hamilton\n\n30 July 7pm Switzerland v New Zealand, Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin\n\n7pm Norway v Philippines, Eden Park, Auckland\n\nGroup B\n\nAustralia (10)\n\nRepublic of Ireland (22)\n\nNigeria (40)\n\nCanada (7)\n\nCanada are the Olympic champions and enter this tournament as one of the teams to watch with captain and striker Christine Sinclair their greatest ever player with more than 300 caps and five World Cups under her belt. With star striker Sam Kerr up front, the Matilda's will be planning a top finish at the tournament they're co-hosting. Their best results were quarter-finals appearances in 2007, 2011 and 2015. Australia beat England 2-0 in April and with regular games against the top sides they'll go into the tournament in good form. Republic of Ireland and Nigeria will both be out to cause a couple of upsets.\n\nGroup B matches:\n\nJuly 20 10pm Australia vs. Rep. of Ireland, Sydney\n\nJuly 21 2:30pm Nigeria vs. Canada, Melbourne\n\nJuly 26 10pm Canada vs. Rep. of Ireland, Perth\n\nJuly 27 10pm Australia vs. Nigeria, Brisbane\n\nJuly 31 10pm Canada vs. Australia, Melbourne\n\n10pm Rep. of Ireland vs. Nigeria, Brisbane\n\nGroup C\n\nSpain (6)\n\nCosta Rica (36)\n\nZambia (77)\n\nJapan (11)\n\nSpain are an improving side and are led by Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas of Barcelona, who's coming back from an ACL injury that forced her out of the 2022 Euro campaign where they reached the quarter-finals. Japan are the other side expected to qualify from the group after winning the tournament in 2011 and finishing runners-up in 2015. Costa Rica are making their second appearance at the final, having failed to get out of group play in 2015, while Zambia are making their debut.\n\nGroup C matches\n\nJuly 21 7:30pm Spain vs. Costa Rica, Wellington\n\nJuly 22 7pm Zambia vs Japan, Hamilton\n\nJuly 26 7:30 Spain vs. Zambia, Auckland\n\nJuly 26 5pm Japan vs. Costa Rica, Dunedin\n\nJuly 31 7pm Japan vs Spain, Wellington\n\n7pm Costa Rica vs. Zambia, Hamilton\n\nGroup D\n\nEngland (4)\n\nHaiti (53)\n\nDenmark (13)\n\nChina (14)\n\nThe Lionesses were the inform team of 2022, going unbeaten and winning Euro 2022. That form has continued this year although they have suffered injuries to key players Beth Mead, Leah Williamson and Fran Kirby, who have been ruled out of the tournament. England are still contenders and won't have any problems moving out of the group. China and Denmark will be battling for the second spot... China are Asian Cup champions, while Denmark are returning to the finals for the first time sine 1995.\n\nGroup D matches:\n\nJuly 22 9:30pm England vs. Haiti, Brisbane\n\nJuly 22 10pm Denmark vs. China, Perth\n\nJuly 28 8:30pm England vs Denmark, Sydney\n\nJuly 28 10:30pm China vs Haiti, Adelaide\n\nAug. 1 10:30pm China vs. England, Adelaide\n\n10:30pm Haiti vs. Denmark, Perth\n\nGroup E\n\nUnited States (1)\n\nVietnam (32)\n\nNetherlands (9)\n\nPortugal (21)\n\nThe United States will be favourites to win their third successive title. The majority of their players compete in the National Women's Soccer League with many of them having more than a hundred caps. The interesting game in the group is the top ranked Americans against the Netherlands, a repeat of the 2019 Wold Cup final which the USA won 2-0. Since then the Dutch were quarter-finalists at Euro 2022 and remain a force in Europe. Portugal are making their World Cup debut but will have good memories of playing down-under beating New Zealand 5-0 earlier this year before winning the World Cup inter-continental play-off in Hamilton. Vietnam are making their World Cup finals debut.\n\nGroup E matches\n\nJuly 22 1pm USA v Vietnam, Auckland\n\nJuly 23 7:30pm Netherlands v Portugal, Dunedin\n\nJuly 27 1pm USA v Netherlands, Wellington\n\nJuly 27 7:30pm Portugal v Vietnam, Hamilton\n\nAug 1 7pm Portugal v USA, Auckland\n\n7pm Vietnam v Netherlands, Dunedin\n\nGroup F\n\nFrance (5)\n\nJamaica (43)\n\nBrazil (8)\n\nPanama (52)\n\nFrance has gone through some turmoil in recent times with the sacking of coach Corrine Diacre after a player revolt with HervÄ“ Renard, who led Saudi Arabia to an upset win over Argentina at last year's men's World Cup, taking over. Their best result was fourth in 2011 and they'll be aiming for a place in the semi-finals. Brazil will test all the top teams and have an experienced striker in 37 year old Marta, who will be playing her sixth World Cup. They arrive here as South American champions. Jamaica lost all three games at their only other World Cup appearance in 2019, but are on the improve under captain Khadija Shaw who topped the scoring for her English club Manchester City last season. Panama are making their debut at the tournament.\n\nGroup F matches:\n\nJuly 23 10pm France v Jamaica, Sydney\n\nJuly 24 10:30pm Brazil v Panama, Adelaide\n\nJuly 29 10pm France v Brazil, Brisbane\n\nJuly 29 8:30pm Panama v Jamaica, Perth\n\nAug 2 10pm Panama v France, Sydney\n\n10pm Jamaica v Brazil, Melbourne\n\nGroup G\n\nSweden (3)\n\nSouth Africa (54)\n\nItaly (16)\n\nArgentina (28)\n\nSweden have been a force in the women's game for many years, they were World Cup runners-up in 2003 and European champions in 1984. Sweden has climbed to number three in the world rankings on the back of successive runners-up at the last two Olympics and finishing fourth at last year's European Championship.\n\nThey're clear group favourites from Italy, who topped their qualifying group, while Argentina are yet to win a game in three appearances at the finals, while South Africa are playing their second tournament and arrive here as African champions.\n\nGroup G matches:\n\nJuly 23 5pm Sweden v South Africa, Wellington\n\nJuly 24 6pm Italy v Argentina, Auckland\n\nJuly 28 12pm Argentina v South Africa, Dunedin\n\nJuly 29 7:30pm Sweden v Italy, Wellington\n\nAug 2 7pm Argentina v Sweden, Hamilton\n\n7pm South Africa v Italy, Wellington\n\nGroup H\n\nGermany (2)\n\nMorocco (72)\n\nColombia (25)\n\nSouth Korea (17)\n\nAfter finishing runners-up at the 2022 European Championship, Germany have a largely unchanged side for the World Cup where they hope to make amends for their early exit four years ago when they were beaten in the quarter-finals. The Germans have a number of influential players including captain Alexandra Popp and midfielder Lena Oberdorf. The draw will be interesting as Germany, two-time champions in 2003 and 2007, have lost to the eventual winners on five occasions.\n\nAsian Cup runners-up South Korea and Copa America runners-up Colombia will battle for the other qualifying spot from the group.\n\nGroup H matches:\n\nJuly 24 8:30pm Germany v Morocco, Melbourne\n\nJuly 25 2pm Colombia v South Korea, Sydney\n\nJuly 30 9:30pm Germany v Colombia, Sydney\n\nJuly 30 4pm South Korea v Morocco, Adelaide\n\nAug 3 8pm Morocco v Colombia, Perth\n\n10pm South Korea v Germany, 10pm"
