        "text": "Our programme focuses on providing the highest quality of coaching, with the best sports science, medical, education, and well-being support. Being the only professional football club in New Zealand creates a unique landscape within the local game. It isn’t possible to play all the other A-League Academy teams in a weekly competition so our Academy teams are invited by New Zealand Football to play in regional and national competitions in the Capital Football region.\n\nCapital Football runs a Capital Development League (CDL) for clubs with Talent Development Programmes (TDP’s). The Phoenix Academy teams in these competitions play at least one grade up. For our older players they play in senior competitions, our Academy teams are all age-restricted (e.g.U20) but play against club 1st teams. Our Reserve Team plays in the new NZF National League System (NLS) Tier 1 which includes the Central League & National League Playoffs. This combination of youth football and senior competitions at a young age builds unique player profiles compared to Academies overseas."
