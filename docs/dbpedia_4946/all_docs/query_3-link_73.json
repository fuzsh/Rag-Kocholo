        "text": "The path to this all-Kiwi encounter is one that has been well-tread by Auckland City coach Ramon Tribulietx and his players, with this the team’s fifth consecutive OFC Champions League final.\n\nBut experienced or not, Tribulietx is feeling some of that pressure which comes with any big, one off final.\n\n“We’re trying to concentrate. We understand it’s going to be one of the toughest matches we’ve played in this competition,” he says.\n\n“We’ve been here before, but we acknowledge that Team Wellington have done really well. We know each other pretty well, we’ve played quite a lot of games against each other actually.\n\n“We know each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and that’s going to make the game a difficult one, a tight one. And I hope that whatever happens on the field it’s a good game and we all enjoy it.”\n\nAuckland City have won this competition on six previous occasions, and to add a seventh regional title on top of their outstanding showing at the FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco, where they finished third, would only contribute to their historic achievements domestically, regionally and globally.\n\nHowever a resolute Team Wellington are standing in their path with desires of their own for the history of this competition.\n\nTeam Wellington’s run to the final saw them knock off advances from former finalists in Ba FC and AS Tefana, as well as former champion Hekari United, in their romp to the final.\n\nThey’re now looking not only to repeat that feat, but create history by ending the impressive winning streak of tomorrow’s opponents.\n\n“I’m really excited to be honest with you,” says Team Wellington coach Matt Calcott of his feelings going into the final.\n\n“It is our first time, but we’ve had a number of players and staff members who have been in the finals.”\n\nThe coach from New Zealand’s capital believes previous matches against their opponents should make for a spicy affair.\n\n“Both sides have had some pretty good battles this year and we know each other pretty well. We know the tactical arrangements and there may well be some surprises, but I think from our side we’ll concentrate on the performance.\n\n“It’s great that it’s an all-New Zealand final, and I think it’s going to come down to performances on the day. We both know our styles of play and I think it’s all really keyed up to it being some key individual performances, and if a lot of our boys can take care of that then that will take care of the result.”\n\nWhether the final being an all-Kiwi affair will lend itself favourably to his side, Tribulietx is non-committal.\n\n“We know each other very well so very few surprises, if any. They know how to tackle us and we know how we have to play against them. It’s going to be one of those games where small detail will make the difference,” the Spaniard says.\n\nWith a lengthy gap between the semi-finals and tomorrow’s final helping to see off any niggling injuries, both sides are expected to be as close to fully-fit as can be.\n\n“It’s been a very hard tournament both physically and mentally, particularly physically as we’re playing in very hard conditions, it’s hot and there’s a lot of games in a short period of time which is why recovery is a big factor,” Tribulietx says.\n\nFor Team Wellington, whose travelling squad is about three players smaller than their opponent’s, the five-day turnaround for his side has been good.\n\n“From the latter part of this second week we’ve been able to recoup and get a bit of recovery going and ensure that the physios are working hard, and it’s looking positive on that front at the moment.”\n\nBoth sides have committed to putting on an entertaining final and if previous bouts between them are anything to go by they will no doubt be plenty of exciting action for fans of both teams to get behind.\n\nCalcott says his side will go out with grit and determination for this encounter.\n\n“We have our roles and responsibilities you might say, but from our side it’s important that we’re 100 per cent from minute one and we’re not switching off, and I think that’s the key thing for us – concentrating and working ourselves into the game.\n\n“There’s a little bit of new territory there so there will be a little bit of nerves so the first 10-15 minutes will be crucial.”\n\nIt’s the same story for Auckland City, though they do have the benefit of experience on their side.\n\n“You’ll probably see a very committed team, a very focused team,” says Tribulietx.\n\n“We’ve played a few of these finals and we know how important it is to be mentally focussed and to respect the opposition.\n\n“In this case we are playing against a very good football side so to make sure we are as competitive as we can and we understand how we have to play this game.”\n\nThe 2015 Fiji Airways OFC Champions League final between Auckland City FC and Team Wellington will kick-off at ANZ Stadium in Suva, Fiji at 7pm, on Sunday 26 April.\n\nExtra information:\n\nAuckland City FC v Team Wellington\n\nANZ Stadium, Suva\n\nSunday 26 April, 2015\n\nKick-off: 19h00\n\nAKLvTWE\n\nMatch Officials\n\nReferee: Norbert HAUATA (TAH)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Tevita MAKASINI (TGA)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Paul AHUPU (TAH)\n\nFourth Official: Robinson BANGA (VAN)\n\nAuckland City FC\n\nThe players: While every player will be crucial in this encounter, height and strength in their own penalty are is going to be key to Auckland City shutting down the threat Team Wellington poses from set pieces. This is where Marko Dordevich, Angel Berlanga, Mario Bilen and Ivan Vicelich will be essential. In-form goalkeeper Tamati Williams will need to be on his toes to shut down the heading power Wellington possesses.\n\nThe vital statistics: Striker Joao Moreira is leading the scoring stakes for Auckland City, with three, but their ability to spread that role around means the threat could come from anywhere. This is Auckland City’s fifth consecutive OFC Champions League final, Ramon Tribulietx has been head coach for three of those previous, and shared the role with Aaron McFarland in 2011.\n\nSquad list: 1. Tamati WILLIAMS (GK), 2. Marko DORDEVICH, 3. Takuya IWATA, 4. Mario BILEN, 5. Angel BERLANGA, 8. Anthony HOBBS, 10. Ryan DE VRIES, 11. Cam LINDSAY, 12. Adam MCGEORGE, 13. Ivan CARRIL, 14. Colin MURPHY, 15. Ivan VICELICH, 16. Daewook KIM, 17. Joao MOREIRA, 18. Danyon DRAKE (GK), 19. David BROWNE, 20. Oscar GARCIA, 21. Gustavo SOUTO, 22. Andrew MILNE, 23. Sam BURFOOT, 24. Jacob SPOONLEY (GK), 25. Michael DEN HEIJER\n\nCoach: Ramon TRIBULIETX (ESP)\n\nTeam Wellington\n\nThe players: The expertise of Luis Corrales, Alex Feneridis, Chris Bale and Sean Lovemore as former Auckland City players could prove crucial to breaking down the tactics and approach of their opponent. Power-players like Tim Myers, Jarrod Smith and Michael Gwyther will need to get things right up front if they are this side want to compete.\n\nThe vital statistics: This is Team Wellington’s first final appearance at an OFC Champions League. Michael Gwyther and Jarrod Smith both have three goals each in this competition."
