Team Wellington FC was formed in 2004 by a consortium of Wellington clubs to compete in the New Zealand Football Championship. The uniform was yellow with black shorts, utilising the primary sporting colours of the Wellington region.

In the inaugural season (2004/2005) of the NZFC, Team Wellington FC performed below expectations, finishing sixth. They improved in the next season, ending the season in fourth place.

In 2007 the Australian A-League placed a franchise in Wellington, known as the Wellington Phoenix. The Phoenix quickly entered a strategic alliance with Team Wellington. The new head coach for Team Wellington, Stu Jacobs, was hired as an assistant coach for the Phoenix while retaining his NZFC role. Team Wellington also changed their kit to a predominantly black strip similar to that of the Phoenix, using yellow as a highlight colour.

Team Wellington FC started the 2007/08 season with a five-game winning streak, a record for the competition. This was ended by a 1–1 draw against Auckland City FC on 15 December. Team Wellington finished the season in third place, qualifying for the Preliminary Final against second-placed Auckland City. Team Wellington defeated Auckland City 4–3 in overtime. Team Wellington thus went on to the Grand Final, in which they were defeated by Waitakere United 2–0 at Trusts Stadium.

On 21 April 2015, Team Wellington reached the final of the 2014–15 OFC Champions League in their first appearance in the competition. They were beaten on penalties by the defending champions Auckland City in the final on 26 April, having drawn 1–1 after extra time.

Heading into the 2016–2017 season, José Figueira took on the role as coach at Team Wellington on 1 July 2016.

In March 2016, Team Wellington won their first ever ISPS Handa Premiership title. Having finished in 3rd in the regular season, they beat Hawke's Bay United in the semi-final, before beating Auckland City 4–2 in an enthralling finale at QBE Stadium in Albany, Auckland.

Team Wellington FC won back to back league titles in April 2017, dispatching Waitakere United on penalties after an enthralling 6–6 draw in the semi-final, before beating Auckland City 2–1 in the Grand Final at QBE Stadium.

Team Wellington FC proved their worth in the 2017-2018 OFC Champions League by winning their way to the very nail-biting semi-final against Auckland that, despite ending in a 2–2 draw, Team Wellington FC won due to aggregate score. The game was viewed as extremely controversial as the referee added 8 minutes of extra time to the end of the game. This 8 minutes turned into 12 extra minutes (total game time was 101 minutes) and caused much aggravation from both sides before the referee blew the final whistle. After this, Team Wellington faced Lautoka FC in two final legs; one at home at David Farrington Park on 13 May 2018, the other at Lautoka FC's home ground of Churchill Park in Fiji on 20 May 2018[ ].

Team Wellington FC won the first leg in a staggering 6–0 victory. The second leg was also won by Team Wellington FC, with a score of 3–4 to Team Wellington FC[ ]. This gave Team Wellington FC the title of Oceanic Champions and earned them entry to the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup to be held in the UAE in December 2018[ ].

On 12 December 2018, Team Wellington FC played their first and only match in the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup against Al Ain FC, who would later be runners-up, scoring 3 goals in the first half. However, their lead was short-lived, with Al Ain scoring 3 goals and sending the match into extra time and then penalties. Team Wellington would lose the penalties 4–3 and were knocked out.

Team Wellington would win the last ever game played in the ISPS Handa Premiership, when they beat long time rivals, Auckland City 2–1 in the 2020–2021 Grand Final.
