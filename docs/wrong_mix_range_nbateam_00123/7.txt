Jamal Crawford is showing no signs of slowing down, and the Los Angeles Clippers are paying him accordingly.

Crawford agreed to stay with the Clippers on Sunday, accepting a $42 million, three-year contract offer, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal cannot be signed and finalized until at least Thursday, when the NBA’s offseason moratorium is lifted.

Crawford had interest from other clubs, and was believed to have received a sizable offer from Philadelphia. But the Clippers countered at a level that Crawford apparently wanted, and he’s staying in Los Angeles.

Crawford was the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year this past season, the third time he’s won that award. He averaged 14.2 points in 27 minutes per game for the Clippers, and averaged 17.3 points in the team’s six playoff games.

The 36-year-old Crawford has appeared in 1,100 regular-season games. At the end of last season, only nine active players had been in more.

Crawford has also played for New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Portland and Golden State. He’s primarily been a backup for the last seven seasons, and also won the award given the NBA’s top reserve for the 2009-10 and 2013-14 seasons.

The Clippers won 53 games last season, the team’s fourth consecutive year of winning at least that many. Besieged by injuries, Los Angeles fell in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs to Portland in six games.
