LOS ANGELES (AP) Jamal Crawford of the Los Angeles Clippers has won the NBA Sixth Man Award as the league's best player off the bench.

The 34-year-old guard is the oldest recipient and the first to win it for two different teams. Crawford won it while with Atlanta in 2009-10. The award was announced Thursday.

Crawford led the league's reserve players in scoring this season, averaging 18.6 points. He came off the bench in 45 of 69 games he played in, helping the Clippers to a 57-25 record, their best regular-season mark in franchise history.

He set the single-season franchise record for 3-pointers made with 161.

The Clippers and Oklahoma City are tied 1-1 in their Western Conference semifinal series.
