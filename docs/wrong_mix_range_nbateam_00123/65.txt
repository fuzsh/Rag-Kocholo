LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jamal Crawford is moving down the West Coast to join the Los Angeles Clippers.

The team says the free agent guard signed a deal on Wednesday.

Crawford averaged 13.9 points, 3.2 assists and 2.0 rebounds in 60 games in his lone season with Portland. He shot 38 percent from the field, 31 percent from 3-point range and led the NBA in free-throw shooting at 93 percent, a weakness for the Clippers last season.

Crawford was the league's sixth man of the year in 2009-10 with Atlanta. The 12-year veteran has also played for Chicago, the New York Knicks and Golden State.
