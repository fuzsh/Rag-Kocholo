There were several times during this offseason that Jamal Crawford thought he wasn't going to be returning to the Los Angeles Clippers for the 2015-16 season.

The 15-year veteran, who's played with six teams throughout his career, is used to switching teams, yet he's publicly stated his love of the Clippers and his teammates over the course of his tenure with the franchise.

The thought of being traded scared him, frankly.

"There were some stressful points, and there were some points where I was like, 'You know what, it's part of the business,'" Crawford said at the Clippers' first day of training camp at UC Irvine on Saturday.

One of the joys of not being traded -- aside from having to move cities and uproot his family -- was realizing that he, along with Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, are the only four Clippers to remain from when Crawford joined the team prior to the 2012-13 season.

"I guess I'm one of those four guys who have been here, so obviously I'm where I'm supposed to be," Crawford said.
