Jamal Crawford is moving down the West Coast to join the Los Angeles Clippers.

The team says the free agent guard signed a deal on Wednesday.

Crawford averaged 13.9 points, 3.2 assists and 2.0 rebounds in 60 games in his lone season with Portland. He shot 38 per cent from the field, 31 per cent from 3-point range and led the NBA in free-throw shooting at 93 per cent, a weakness for the Clippers last season.

Crawford was the league's sixth man of the year in 2009-10 with Atlanta. The 12-year veteran has also played for Chicago, the New York Knicks and Golden State.

Evans headed to Brooklyn

The Clippers also sent forward Reggie Evans to Brooklyn in a sign-and-trade deal for the right to swap second-round draft picks with the Nets in 2016.

Evans averaged 1.9 points, 4.8 rebounds and 13.8 minutes in 56 games last season.

He played for the Toronto Raptors for two seasons before signing a one-year deal with the Clippers on Dec. 22, 2011.
