Los Angeles Clippers shooting guard Jamal Crawford had a stellar debut in red, white and blue scoring 29 points off the bench in the team's 101-92 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night at Staples Center. Crawford's 29 points tied the most points he's ever scored in a season opener and the most in Clippers history for a reserve in a season opener, per ESPN Stats & Info.

Crawford's 29 points came on efficient 10-of-14 shooting (3-of-7 from three point range) and his opening night performance ranks as the third highest scoring debut in team history behind Lamar Odom (30) and Sam Cassell (35). The 2010 Sixth Man of the Year told NBA.com's Eric Patten that his Clippers debut was the kind of game "you dream about".

The explosive reserve guard is best known for his crossover dribble -- hence his Twitter handle of @JCrossover -- but arguably his best move of the night was a stutter-step that sent Rudy Gay to the floor like he'd broken both of his ankles.

See for yourself.
