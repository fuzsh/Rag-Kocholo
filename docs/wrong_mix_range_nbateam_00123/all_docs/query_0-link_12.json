        "text": "Jamal Crawford has agreed to re-sign with the Los Angeles Clippers on a three-year, $42 million deal that has a partial guarantee in the final season, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal can’t be signed until the NBA’s free agency moratorium lifts on July 7.\n\nThe 36-year-old Crawford wanted to remain with the Clippers all along, but he was running for greener pastures after their first offer. According to a person with knowledge of the discussions, it was a one-year, $12 million proposal.\n\nAs Crawford saw it, the fact that the offer came right about the time Clippers president of basketball operations and coach Doc Rivers gave his son, Austin Rivers, a three-year, $35 million deal made the matter that much worse. As USA TODAY Sports reported on Saturday night, he was likely to leave unless the offer was increased dramatically. And in the end, that’s precisely what happened."
