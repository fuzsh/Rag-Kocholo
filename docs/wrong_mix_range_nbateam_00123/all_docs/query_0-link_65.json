        "text": "The Los Angeles Clippers snapped a two-game losing skid with style as they completed a comeback last Saturday to defeat the Detroit Pistons 101â96 at the Staples Center.\n\nLos Angeles was still missing the backcourt tandem of All-Star playmaker Chris Paul and guard J.J. Redick, but two-time National Basketball Association (NBA) Sixth Man of the Year Jamal Crawford stepped up big time.\n\nCrawford started in the game and finished with a season-high 37 points, also having six rebounds, eight assists, and one block in 41 minutes of action.\n\nAll-Star forward Blake Griffin also starred in the win, tallying 34 points, eight rebounds, nine assists, two steals, and one block.\n\nGriffin also made a crucial jumper that helped the Clippers seal the victory over the Pistons.\n\nThe win improved the Clippers' record to 6â4 to be on the fifth spot in the Western Conference standings, with their record putting them in a tie with the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nBut their next game will be tough as they will take on rivals and defending champions the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe Warriors are on a hot 11-game winning streak to begin the season and already defeated Los Angeles when both teams first met this season earlier this month.\n\nIt was a close game with the Dubs edging the Clippers 112â108 and reigning Most Valuable Player (MVP) Stephen Curry leading the charge with 31 points.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pistons, following the loss to the Clippers, again were defeated last Sunday at the Staples Center against the Los Angeles Lakers, 97-85.\n\nThe Pistons, who had a hot start to the 2015-16 season, have now dropped their past four games for a 5â5 record.\n\nDetroit is now on the ninth place in the Eastern Conference standings, with its record identical to that of the Charlotte Hornets and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nThe Pistons will have the chance to end the losing streak when they host the Cleveland Cavaliers this Tuesday."
