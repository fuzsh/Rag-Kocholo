Crawford was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers as the eighth overall pick in the 2000 NBA Draft and has since played for six other NBA teams. He was born in Seattle, Washington in 1980 and led his high school team to success before attending the University of Michigan. As a starter and standout player for the Wolverines, it was no surprise that Crawford was a first-round NBA pick out of college. Although drafted by the Cavaliers, he was immediately traded to the Chicago Bulls, whom he played with for his first five professional seasons. Later, he became a New York Knick, Golden State Warrior, Atlanta Hawk, Portland Trail Blazer and a Los Angeles Clipper, Crawford has achieved many notable accomplishments of the year. He was a two-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2010 and again in 2014, along with the NBA all-time leader in four-point plays.\n\nBook Jamal Crawford for your Next Event\n\nDisclaimer: AthleteSpeakers assists companies seeking to hire talent like Jamal Crawford for speaking engagements, virtual meetings, appearances, product endorsements, and business sanctions.
