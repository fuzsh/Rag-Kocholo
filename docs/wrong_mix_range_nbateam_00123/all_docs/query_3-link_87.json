        "text": "Veteran free agent guard Jamal Crawford met with acting Suns GM James Jones and coach Igor Koskokov on Friday, Arizona Sports 98.7 radio host John Gambadoro tweets.\n\nCrawford is one of few options remaining on the free agent market for teams seeking backcourt help. Phoenix certainly qualifies, though it has more issues at the point than on the wing.\n\nPhoenix’s point guard spot is a muddle with Elie Okobo, DeâAnthony Melton, Shaquille Harrison and Isaiah Canaan competing for minutes. Shooting guard Devin Booker is hoping to return for the season opener after undergoing hand surgery prior to camp. The Suns also have a number of other options at the two-guard position, includingÂ Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges and Troy Daniels.\n\nOverall, they have 14 players with guaranteed contracts and three others with non-guaranteed or partially-guaranteed deals.\n\nJones talked about the team’s interest in Crawford during a 98.7 radio interview.\n\nâI like Jamal. I know him personally. Heâs a great player, heâs a great guy,â Jones said. âThose are the types of players that we will look towards as we go through the season. More importantly, itâs not even about who potentially could be here or whoâs out there. Iâm focused on whoâs here and we know who those guys are. Jamal is a name that â a guy that weâre looking at. Heâs someone that weâve expressed interest in, one of many names.â"
