        "text": "Jamal Crawford, a former NBA player who was named the Sixth Man of the Year three times, brilliantly described what sets Nikola Jokic apart from other players in the premier league in the world.\n\nJamal Crawford, speaking on The Pivot podcast, talked about Serbian basketball player Nikola Jokic, who is the leading candidate for his third MVP award as the league’s best player.\n\n“Jokic is like that, but he operates backwards. He doesn’t play against you, he plays against your head coach, and that’s what sets him apart. He’s not interested in what players do, he watches what the opposing head coach does so he can prepare a response to it."
