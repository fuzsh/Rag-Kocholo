        "text": "Mark J. Terrill/Associated Press\n\nVeteran free-agent guard Jamal Crawford was pursued by other teams as a free-agent, but ultimately he decided to remain in Los Angeles.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nClippers Reportedly Re-Sign Crawford\n\nSunday, July 3\n\nUSA Today's Sam Amick reported Crawford and the Clippers agreed to a three-year, $42 million contract. Shams Charania of The Vertical confirmed the deal.\n\nEarlier in the day, ESPN.com's Ramona Shelburne reported that the Los Angeles Clippers offered Crawford a deal, but Crawford was still weighing his options.\n\n76ers Targeting Crawford\n\nSunday, July 3\n\nDan Woike of the Orange County Register reported he heard the Philadelphia 76ers made a \"significant offer\" to Crawford.\n\nAmick reported earlier that the 76ers have expressed an interest in signing Crawford.\n\nWizards in Pursuit of Crawford\n\nSunday, July 3\n\nThe Washington Post's Candace Buckner reported that the \"[Washington Wizards] have indeed expressed interest [and] engaged in conversations\" with Crawford.\n\nIsaiah Thomas Recruiting to Boston Celtics\n\nSunday, July 3\n\nCavaliers Reported Among Crawford's Suitors\n\nSaturday, July 2\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers and Crawford have mutual interest, according to Sam Amico of Fox Sports.\n\nWarriors In on Crawford\n\nSaturday, July 2\n\nShelburne reported the Golden State Warriors have contacted Crawford, but \"all things [are] on hold\" until Kevin Durant chooses his next team. According to Woike, there is mutual interest between Crawford and the Warriors.\n\nMultiple Teams to Pursue Crawford\n\nWednesday, June 29\n\nBrad Turner of the Los Angeles Times, citing a source, reported Crawford will meet with the Clippers, New York Knicks, Orlando Magic, Dallas Mavericks and the Miami Heat.\n\nMagic Coveting Crawford After Oladipo Trade\n\nTuesday, June 28\n\nAmick reported the buzz on Crawford, referencing Victor Oladipo's departure to the Oklahoma City Thunder as the primary reason for the Orlando Magic's interest. Orlando traded Oladipo as part of the haul exchanged for power forward Serge Ibaka.\n\nAs Orlando's roster stands, the deal means the Magic will ask last year's No. 5 overall pick, Mario Hezonja, to step up into a huge role in 2016-17. He could use a mentor like Crawford not only to show him the nuances of the game, but also to spell him and play key minutes.\n\nThe Magic would do well to land Crawford, who could help them get into the playoff conversation in the Eastern Conference. However, they still could use another proven veteran, particularly on the wing.\n\nAlthough Aaron Gordon has flashed upside in his two seasons with the team, he's a bit of a tweener forward Orlando should have playing mostly the 4 behind Ibaka.\n\nCrawford Cemented as Elite Role Player\n\nCrawford is a three-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award winner and nabbed the accolade this past season, when he averaged 14.2 points per contest.\n\nDespite turning 36 years old in March, Crawford showed he still has plenty left in the tank for at least another season or two. His combination of athleticism, ball-handling skills, perimeter shooting ability and knack for getting to the rim is a good enough skill set to extend his career even as he loses a step or two."
