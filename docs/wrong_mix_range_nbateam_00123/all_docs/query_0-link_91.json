        "text": "The Los Angeles Clippers are a highlight machine every night, but last night they were even better than usual at dazzling their audience with an array of dunks. This double alley oop between Blake Griffin and Jamal Crawford was the best of the bunch.\n\nIn addition to the aerial acrobatics from the likes of Griffin, Crawford, and DeAndre Jordan, the Clippers won the game over the Derrick Rose-less Chicago Bulls, which is what really matters. But wins don't look as good in short video clips, so we thank Griffin and Crawford for making the victory look cool with plays like this."
