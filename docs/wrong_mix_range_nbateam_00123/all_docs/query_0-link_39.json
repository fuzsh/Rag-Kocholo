        "text": "Jamal Crawford has talked about the LA Clippers’ 2016-17 season, and believes the team is still “right there” as a championship contender.\n\nThe 2016-17 NBA season is a pivotal one for the LA Clippers. Blake Griffin is returning healthy to a team that’s largely the same except for some new additions to the bench, and like the similar roster, the expectations will be the same. Yet again, the Clippers will be under pressure from themselves, their critics, and their fans to break through in the playoffs. Getting past the second round is the minimum.\n\nLast season was a write off after the injuries to Chris Paul and Griffin that removed them early from the playoffs, which only places more incentive to achieve greater success in their final season under contract before 2017 free agency.\n\nThe obvious postseason obstacle, an unbelievably imposing one at that, will be the Golden State Warriors. Likely waiting in the Western Conference Finals, they seem in another class after adding Kevin Durant. But Jamal Crawford thinks his team is “right there”.\n\nCrawford believes the Clippers’ chemistry, reinforced by some continuity this offseason, is key, and that they won’t stop knocking on the door as contenders, per Alex Kennedy of Basketball Insiders:\n\nMore from Clipperholics\n\nCrawford is right in the approach that you need to keep knocking on the door until it falls down. That’s often an approach that people miss in the suggestions of, “break up the Big 3!” Sometimes all you need is a little luck, an injury to an opponent, or a hot spell of shooting to get your break at the right time in the playoffs.\n\nYou don’t break up a perennial 55-win team for no better alternative when you could get such a chance at any moment.\n\nOf course, the opposite happened for the Clippers last season with Paul’s and Griffin’s injuries. But that’s just how the cards fall sometimes.\n\nThe LA Clippers are “right there” in the top group of contenders as Crawford said. However, they aren’t close enough to the Warriors right now to be considered anything more than a likely second place.\n\nSecond place in the Western Conference and a trip to the Conference Finals could be the ceiling for this year’s Clippers when the door they have to break down is protected by a Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green foursome. Only time will tell how far Lob City can go.\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
