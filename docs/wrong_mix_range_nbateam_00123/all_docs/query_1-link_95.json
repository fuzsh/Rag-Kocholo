        "text": "NEW YORK – Los Angeles Clippers guard Jamal Crawford has won the 2016 Sixth Man Award, becoming the first three-time winner as the NBA’s best reserve.\n\nCrawford received 51 first-place votes and 341 points from a panel of 130 sports writers and broadcasters in the U.S. and Canada today. 2015 NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala of Golden State was second, with 288 points (33 first-place votes), and Oklahoma City’s Enes Kanter finished third, with 182 points (19 first-place votes).\n\nCrawford averaged 14.2 points in 79 games, coming off of the bench in 74. He ranked second in the NBA in free throw percentage (90.4%).\n\nThe 16-year veteran out of Michigan added this win to his awards in 2009-10 with Atlanta and 2013-14 with the Clippers.\n\nKevin McHale, Ricky Pierce and Detlef Schrempf all won the Sixth Man Award twice. Crawford is the only player to win with multiple teams."
