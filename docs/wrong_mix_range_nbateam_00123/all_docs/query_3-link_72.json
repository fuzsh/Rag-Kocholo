        "text": "The former NBA players Jordan and Jamal Crawford have no blood relation. Many have speculated whether the two are brothers, but they arenât and only share a last name.\n\nJordan and Jamal Crawford, like Tyler and Tyron Smith, are cases of athletes sharing last names. In Tyler and Tyronâs case, at least they are teammates, but Jordan and Jamal never shared an NBA team during their tenure in the league.\n\nThey played for the Golden State Warriors, but by the time Jordan joined the Warriors, Jamal was at the Los Angeles Clippers, playing alongside Chris Paul. Jamal officially retired from the NBA in 2022 after 20 seasons in the league, and Jordan Crawford last played in the NBA in the 2017 season.\n\nRecently, Jamal showed love to the Dallas Mavericks team. The three-time Sixth Man of the Year, Crawford said the Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving duo are the most skilled backcourt players to ever play together.\n\nAre Jordan And Jamal Crawford Related?\n\nThe former NBA players Jordan and Jamal Crawford arenât related. The two might have an age difference that might make you think Jamal is an older brother to Jordan, but that isnât true.\n\nJordan Crawford last played in the NBA in 2017 for the New Orleans Pelicans. Since then, he has played in Germany and is currently hooping in China.\n\nBorn on October 23, 1988, Jordan Crawford was raised in Detroit, Michigan, by his parents, Joe Sr., and Sylvia Crawford. The basketball player has two brothers, and both do not go by the name Jamal Crawford.\n\nJordanâs older brother, Joe Crawford, previously played basketball for the University of Kentucky. He was selected by the Lakers in the 2008 NBA Draft but was waived in the pre-season.\n\nAfter failing to make a mark in the NBA, Joe traveled to China and played for Jiangsu Dragons for one season. He later signed for Beijing Ducks and joined an Israel-based basketball club, Maccabi Rishon LeZion, in 2011.\n\nJoe hung up his shoes in 2015 after playing for the NBA G-league-based team Osceola Magic. Joe is available on Instagram with the username @faygo_joe and has shared a few family photos.\n\nJordanâs younger brother, Jalen Crawford, previously played for Bradley University. At 6â2, Jalen played as a Guard for Bradley and later joined Fort Valley State University.\n\nThe younger brother of Jordan Crawford has kept himself away from the public limelight and isnât available on social media.\n\nJamal Crawford Family\n\nJamal Crawford was born in a family where he was the only son. The former NBA player didnât have any brothers but does have two sisters.\n\nThe NBA veteran Jamal Crawfordâs father, Clyde Crawford, played basketball at Oregon in the early 1970s. He played with the former Cleveland Cvalaeires forward Kevin Loveâs father.\n\nHis mother, Venora Skinner, had Jamalâs oldest sister, Lisa Skinner, when she was 12. A year later, she gave birth to her second child, Lori Skinner. Two different teenage boys impregnated Venora, but her family had her back.\n\nShe graduated from high school and later enrolled at the University of Washington, earning a degree in speech education. She also put herself through teaching and nursing.\n\nVenora had Jamal when she was 27 but almost thought of abortion. But her daughter, Lori, told Venora that if she had the baby, she would care for it.\n\nCrawford had a strong bond with his sisters growing up, and one of his sisters, Lisa Skinner, is also available on Instagram. Venora is also on the photo-sharing platform and has posted a few family photos.\n\nncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCt0Z5ko6eima6vecCnm2aikaKurXnCq5iwnp%2BnsW6%2BxKWYrZ2UYrOiucilsGasopqycA%3D%3D"
