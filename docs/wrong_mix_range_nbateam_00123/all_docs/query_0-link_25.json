        "text": "In case you missed it yesterday, 6th man extraordinaire Jamal Crawford of the Los Angeles Clippers made a stop in The Jungle to talk to Jim Rome. He talked about the Clippers expectations for the upcoming season:\n\n“Every year is a new opportunity, it’s really really exciting. That’s why this is one of the best groups we’ve had. I feel like it’s the right pieces at the right time,” Crawford said. “Obviously there’s some really really tough teams out there, but I don’t see why we can’t be one of the elite teams as well.”\n\nHe also talked about the unfortunate circumstances that ended the Clippers season last year:\n\n“Losing your two best guys at the wrong time last year within a five-minute span, I’m not sure any team could have recovered from that in that kind of time. So for us, health is very important”\n\nAnd he also talked about how some of the recent retirees have inspired him throughout his career:\n\n“Obviously the game continues to evolve. There will always be great players, but for me, personally, that was the generation that kind of helped inspire me”\n\nHere is the entire clip from Crawford’s interview with Jim Rome. Enjoy!"
