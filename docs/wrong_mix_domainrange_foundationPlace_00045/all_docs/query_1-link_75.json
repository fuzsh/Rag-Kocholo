Learn about the winning projects and how they were selected, and find contact information that will allow you to learn more about any of the efforts.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe National Roadway Safety Awards is a biennial competition sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Roadway Safety Foundation (RSF) to recognize roadway safety achievements that move the United States towards zero deaths and serious injuries on the nation’s roadways. The competition acknowledges successful engineering solutions that agencies have integrated into their roadway safety programs. Awards are given in two categories: Infrastructure and Operational Improvements; and Program Planning, Development, and Evaluation. Selected projects are included in a noteworthy practices guide so they can be replicated nationwide.\n\nFHWA and RSF stress the importance of strategic, data-driven approaches to improving highway safety. Applicants are encouraged to nominate projects or programs that exemplify innovative and effective safety activities and maximize the cost effectiveness of Federal, State, local, and/or private sector funds.\n\n“The recognition our agency received was fantastic. Not to mention the time I spent in Washington, DC and getting to know all the other award winners!’’\n\nBrent Jennings, Highway Safety Manager\n\nAward Categories\n\nINFRASTRACTURE AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS\n\nThis category recognizes successful implementation of infrastructure or operational solutions on the roadway or roadside environment that demonstrably improve safety.\n\nPROGRAM PLANNING, DEVELOPMENT, AND EVALUATION\n\nThis category honors programs that identify and address State and local needs by making effective use of safety data and evaluations as well as tools and applications such as the Highway Safety Manual and the U.S. Road Assessment Program (usRAP).\n\nExamples of winning entries from past competitions can be found at https://www.roadwaysafety.org/programs/national-roadway-safety-awards.\n\nAward Criteria\n\nEligibility for submitting a National Roadway Safety Award application is restricted to public agencies that have implemented a relevant project for public roadway safety benefit. Other groups that have been involved in successful roadway safety efforts (e.g., private entities, academic institutions, nonprofits, etc.) may cosponsor a nomination, provided that a public agency is the lead applicant. Each entry will be judged among other nominations in its category. A nominated project or program must demonstrate evidence of data-supported results, including documentation supporting the project’s or program’s success. Applicants are encouraged to review the application form as they consider submitting a project or program for an award. Projects in both award categories will be judged on the following criteria:\n\nSAFETY EFFECTIVENESS.\n\nProjects or programs that:\n\nResult in or demonstrate high potential for significantly reducing fatal and serious injury crashes, with an emphasis on states, cities, local or tribal governments with significant reductions in these crash types within the last five years.\n\nCreate a proven case for greater emphasis on roadway safety in transportation planning, programming, project delivery, construction, and/or maintenance.\n\nSupport safety improvements through greater public awareness that yields a positive change in transportation safety culture.\n\nInclude equity considerations through safety solutions that focus on underserved populations.\n\nINNOVATION/TRANSFORMATION\n\nProjects or programs that use innovative concepts at a national, state, or local level including:\n\nCreative approaches to address highway safety concerns.\n\nInnovative management approaches to overcoming barriers to safety implementation.\n\nInventive solutions to a particular serious injury or fatal crash problem.\n\nProactive involvement of the public and/or stakeholders.\n\nCOST-EFFECTIVENESS/ECONOMIC STRENGTH\n\nProjects or programs that:\n\nAre implemented cost-efficiently.\n\nUse planning and engineering resources efficiently and/or employ cost-sharing through multi-source partnerships, task forces, or coalitions.\n\nImprove the economic vitality of the community.\n\nBenefits of Being a National Roadway Safety Award Winner\n\nAward Winners Receive:\n\nAn invitation and funded travel to attend a ceremony and luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. *Note that due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 Awards are being held virtually.\n\nOpportunities to network with legislators and key national transportation officials.\n\nNational media coverage and additional local media support, identifying your organization as a leader in highway safety.\n\nAppearance in the Noteworthy Practices Guide, Public Roads magazine, the Roadway Safety e-Reporter, FHWA Safety Compass, as well as other publications of national safety and transportation organizations.\n\nRecognition on several websites operated by FHWA, RSF, and their safety partners.\n\nAn engraved trophy.\n\nNational Roadway Safety Awards\n\nFEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION\n\nFHWA is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation that supports State and local governments in the design, construction, and maintenance of the Nation’s highway system and various federal- and tribal-owned lands. Through financial and technical assistance to State and local governments, we are responsible for ensuring that America’s roads and highways continue to be among the safest and most technologically sound in the world.\n\nTHE ROADWAY SAFETY FOUNDATION\n\nRSF is the only national organization solely dedicated to reducing deaths by improving the physical characteristics of America’s roadways – design and engineering, operating conditions, removal of roadside hazards, and the effective use of safety features. RSF works to attain its goals by building awareness through media campaigns and outreach activities, developing educational materials, and forming roadway safety partnerships between the private and public sectors. It is a private, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization chartered by the American Highway Users Alliance.\n\n2021 Award Winners\n\nOn October 6, 2021 the Roadway Safety Foundation and Federal Highway Administration announced the seven winners and three Honorable Mentions of the 2021 National Roadway Safety Awards.
