BYT actively works to dismantle barriers to access and participation by creating a safe and inclusive community in which everyone who auditions receives a role. In addition, BYT provides opportunities for all regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity or socio-economic status while also working to support neurodivergent and disabled participants.\n\nThe Bellevue Youth Theatre Foundation was created to ensure the goals of BYTâ€™s programs are robustly supported by providing volunteers, fundraising and community outreach and events."
