        "text": "Generally speaking, smaller suburban cities that surround larger urban centers tend to offer lower home prices. That’s why price-conscious home buyers often look to “the burbs” to find a better deal on a house.\n\nBut it doesn’t always work that way, and Bellevue is a prime example.\n\nBellevue home prices are actually more expensive than the city of Seattle. Bellevue has a lot of features that home buyers seek, such as excellent schools and safe neighborhoods. So it commands a premium price.\n\nBellevue Is Actually More Expensive Than Seattle\n\nHow much does a home cost in Bellevue? More specifically, how do Bellevue vs Seattle home prices differ?\n\nAs of early 2024, the city of Bellevue, Washington is quite a bit more expensive than the city of Seattle. Here are some recent market stats to illustrate that point, using data provided by Zillow in February of 2024:\n\nSeattle median home value: $815,858\n\nBellevue median home value: $1,300,824\n\nMultiple Listing Service (MLS) data confirms this as well. When this article was published, the median sale prices for these two cities were $775,000 in Seattle, and $1,099,500 in Bellevue. This is a different metric from the median value cited above, hence the different numbers.\n\nNo matter what source you look at, you’ll find that Bellevue is more expensive than Seattle when measured by median or average home prices.\n\nBellevue is also a much smaller real estate market, in terms of total land area, population, and the total number of homes for sale. When this article was published, Realtor.com had nearly 1,900 listings for the city of Seattle, compared to 254 in nearby Bellevue.\n\nBeyond the Urban / Suburban Divide\n\nIt’s easy to compare Bellevue vs Seattle real estate markets in terms of price point, affordability, and similar metrics.\n\nBut in other ways, they are like apples and oranges. There’s a clear urban-versus-suburban distinction to be made here, with Bellevue being the more suburban of the two cities. But it goes beyond that.\n\nThe key difference is that Bellevue offers a more polished and planned feel with a focus on business and modern amenities. Seattle has a grittier, more eclectic urban atmosphere with a broader range of neighborhoods and a stronger emphasis on arts and alternative culture.\n\nBecause of these differences, people who have spent some time in both cities usually have no problem deciding which one is right for them. It’s all about finding the right fit for your lifestyle.\n\nBellevue, Washington at a Glance\n\nAre you thinking about buying a home in Bellevue, WA in the near future? Here’s a quick primer to bring you up to speed.\n\nBellevue is a major city located in King County, Washington. It’s part of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA metropolitan statistical area. In French, the city’s name means “beautiful view,” and it truly lives up to that name.\n\nThe city of Bellevue is located to the east of Seattle, just across Lake Washington, in what’s known as the “Eastside.” With a population of over 150,000, it ranks as the fifth-largest city in the state of Washington (after Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, and Vancouver).\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally settled in the 1860s, Bellevue was primarily known for its farms and strawberry fields. After the construction of the first Lake Washington floating bridge in 1940, the area experienced suburban growth. In 1953, it was officially incorporated as a city.\n\nSince the 1980s, Bellevue has undergone substantial development, transforming into a significant economic hub. It has also become more diverse over the years, from a demographic standpoint.\n\nEconomy\n\nBellevue’s economy is largely fueled by the technology industry. Global companies like Microsoft, Amazon, T-Mobile US, PACCAR, Meta, Salesforce, and many others maintain headquarters or major offices in and around the city.\n\nThis concentration of tech employment has contributed to Bellevue’s high median income levels and its correspondingly high cost of living.\n\nHousing Market\n\nThe Bellevue housing market is highly competitive. As mentioned above, the median home value is higher than in Seattle itself. Housing demand is influenced by the high-paying tech sector presence and Bellevue’s excellent quality of life.\n\nThe city offers a mix of property types, ranging from waterfront homes to upscale condos. But home buyers in Bellevue often have to compete fiercely with one another, due to limited inventory.\n\nSchools and Education\n\nThe Bellevue School District is highly regarded and serves as a major draw for families relocating to the area. All four of the city’s high schools have appeared on “Best High School” rankings from publishers such as Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report. In addition, Bellevue College offers access to higher education options.\n\nSo, is Bellevue cheaper or more expensive than Seattle for home buyers? Overall, Bellevue offers its residents a tech-focused community with excellent schools, abundant amenities, and close proximity to nature. But you’ll pay a premium for all of those great features, with a median home price higher than many other Seattle-area cities."
