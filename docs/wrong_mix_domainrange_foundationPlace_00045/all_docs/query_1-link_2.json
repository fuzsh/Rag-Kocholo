        "text": "\"Bellevue, WA\" redirects here. For the suburb of Perth, see Bellevue, Western Australia.\n\nNot to be confused with Bellevue (Washington, D.C.).\n\nFor other places with the same name, see Bellevue (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Washington, United States\n\nBellevue ( BEL-vew) is a city in the Eastside region of King County, Washington, United States, located across Lake Washington from Seattle. It is the third-largest city in the Seattle metropolitan area, and the fifth-largest city in Washington. It has variously been characterized as a satellite city, a suburb, a boomburb, or an edge city.[6][7] The population was 151,854 at the 2020 census.[4] The city's name is derived from the French term belle vue (\"beautiful view\").[8]\n\nBellevue is home to some of the world's largest technology companies. Before and after the 2008 recession, its downtown area has been undergoing rapid change with many high-rise projects being constructed. Downtown Bellevue is currently the second-largest city center in Washington state, with 1,300 businesses, 45,000 employees, and 10,200 residents.[9] In a 2018 estimate, the city's median household income was among the top five cities in the state of Washington.[10] In 2008, Bellevue was number one in CNNMoney's list of the best places to live and launch a business,[11] and in 2010 was again ranked as the fourth-best place to live in America.[12] In 2014, Bellevue was ranked as the second-best place to live by USA Today.[13]\n\nMore than 145 companies have been located in Bellevue; companies currently headquartered there include PACCAR Inc, T-Mobile US, and Valve. The technology company Amazon was founded in Bellevue by Jeff Bezos.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Duwamish, whose main settlements were located in present-day Renton and Seattle, maintained a small outpost settlement called Satskal (SAH-tsah-kahl) along the Mercer Slough, south of present-day downtown Bellevue.[14] It was from this village that an attack on the settlers of Elliott Bay was staged. The Duwamish also had a village near Factoria called 'pah-pah-DEEL'.[15]\n\nBellevue was first settled by European Americans in 1869 by William Meydenbauer and Aaron Mercer, who claimed homestead tracts several miles apart. Both moved away within a few years, and permanent residents did not arrive until 1879. By 1882, a community, consisting mostly of logging homesteaders, had established itself.[14] Once the land had been logged, it was gradually cleared, largely by Japanese immigrant labor in the early 20th century, to support small-scale farming on leased land plots.[16]\n\nBy the early part of the 20th century, Bellevue had acquired a reputation as a weekend getaway destination for Seattle residents, who would arrive by ferry at Meydenbauer Bay and spend the day at nearby Wildwood Park.[17] After the ferry landing was moved to Medina, however, tourism to Bellevue waned. To counter this decline, the Bellevue Strawberry Festival was conceived of in 1925, and by the 1930s it had grown to attract as many as 15,000 visitors. At the time, Bellevue was still a small town with around 2,000 residents.[18]\n\nPrior to the opening of the Lake Washington Floating Bridge in 1940, Bellevue was mostly rural farmland area with little development. Although it was small, developers were pushing to change that; in the 1920s, James S. Ditty predicted that it would become a city with a population of 200,000.[19] He envisioned plans that included the bridging of Lake Washington and an area filled with golf courses and airports.[20] His map with these visions was published in 1928.[20] Once the Murrow Memorial Bridge opened, access from Seattle improved, and the area began to evolve into a bedroom community.[8]\n\nIn 1942, the Bellevue Strawberry Festival was cancelled. The primary reason was that some 90 percent of the agricultural workforce in the area was of Japanese ancestry, and all of these farmers and their families had been forcibly interned in camps following the start of World War II.[21] The fair would not be revived for another 45 years. Following the expulsion of the ethnic Japanese farming community, a large quantity of farmland became available for development.[22] This made way for the initial development of the Bellevue downtown area.\n\nBellevue incorporated as a third-class city on the March 31, 1953.[23] Following the 1963 opening of a second bridge across the lake, the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, the city began to grow more rapidly. The Crossroads community was annexed in 1964.[24] Lake Hills was annexed in 1969.[25] By the 1970 census, Bellevue had become the fourth most populous city in the state of Washington, behind only Seattle, Spokane, and Tacoma.[26]\n\nBellevue remains one of the largest cities in the state, with several high-rise structures in its core and a burgeoning business community. The city experienced a building boom during the mid-2000s, with the building of developments such as Lincoln Square and the Bravern.[8]\n\nBellevue Square is located in downtown Bellevue and is now one of the largest shopping centers in the region. Opened in 1946,[8] the mall has undergone several significant phases of expansion since the 1980s.[citation needed]\n\nThe city's plans include the Bel-Red Corridor Project, a large-scale planning effort to encourage the redevelopment of the large Bel-Red section of the city bordering the adjacent city of Redmond which is a major employment area in the city.[27] Patterned after the redevelopment of the downtown core, plans include superblock mixed-use projects similar to Lincoln Square, premised on private construction and the development of infrastructure such as the 2 Line of Link light rail that will extend to the Eastside.[citation needed]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nBellevue lies between Lake Washington to the west and the smaller Lake Sammamish to the east. Much of Bellevue is drained by the Kelsey Creek watershed, whose source is located in the Larsen Lake and Phantom Lake green belt and whose outlet is near where Interstate 90 meets Lake Washington's eastern shore. The city is bisected by Interstate 405 running north–south, and the southern portion is crossed from west to east by Interstate 90. The State Route 520 freeway roughly delineates the upper reaches of Bellevue.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 37.505 square miles (97.14 km2), of which 33.468 square miles (86.68 km2) is land and 4.037 square miles (10.46 km2) is water.[2]\n\nThe city's name is derived from a French term for \"beautiful view\". Under favorable weather conditions, scenic vistas of the Olympic Mountains and Cascade Mountains can be viewed from hilltops (and strategically positioned high-rise buildings) within the incorporated city.\n\nSouth of I-90, the city continues up Cougar Mountain, at the top of which is an unincorporated King County location called Hilltop. To the west of Cougar Mountain, Bellevue includes the Coal Creek, Somerset, and Factoria neighborhoods.\n\nBellevue is bordered by the cities of Kirkland to the north and Redmond to the northeast along the Overlake and Crossroads neighborhoods. Across the short East Channel Bridge, I-90 connects Bellevue to Mercer Island to the southwest. Issaquah is to the east, down I-90 at the south end of Lake Sammamish. The city is bordered to the west by many affluent suburbs such as Medina, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point and Yarrow Point. The south end of Bellevue is bordered by the city of Renton, and to the southeast, the relatively recently incorporated city of Newcastle.\n\nCityscape\n\n[edit]\n\nNeighborhoods within Bellevue include Bellecrest, Bel-Red, Bridle Trails, Crossroads, Eastgate/Cougar Mountain, Enatai, Factoria, Lake Hills, Newport, Newport Hills, Northeast Bellevue, Northwest Bellevue, Overlake, Sammamish/East Bellevue, Somerset, Sunset, Tam O'Shanter, West Bellevue, Wilburton, and Woodridge.[28]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nLike much of the Puget Sound lowland, Bellevue has a mild oceanic climate. It also has frequent rain showers from October to May, with precipitation levels typically being over 2 inches (51 mm).[29] On average, the hottest month is July, while January is the coldest.[29] Bellevue gets an average of 32.02 inches (813 mm) of rain per year, based on data from 1981 to 2013. However, the city published an analysis of rainfall stating that 2016 saw an usually high 47.14 inches (1,197 mm) of rainfall, and that rainfall in 2014–2016 was trending unusually high.[30] The wet season of 2017, defined as the period from October through April, saw a similar rainfall of 47.26 inches (1,200 mm).[31]\n\nSurrounding cities\n\n[edit]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nBellevue is the main Eastside hub for both the local transit authority, King County Metro, and Sound Transit, the regional transit system. The Bellevue Transit Center, which serves both Metro and Sound buses, is located in the heart of the downtown business district and is connected to Interstate 405 by NE 6th St. and a direct-access Texas T HOV ramp. Local buses run into Kirkland, Redmond, Issaquah, Renton, and the University District;[34] regional buses go to Bothell, Lynnwood, Everett, Seattle, Renton, Kent and Auburn, among other cities.[35] An electric microtransit shuttle service operated by Circuit, Inc. began operating in August 2023; the app-based service is funded by the city's hotel room tax and fare-free for passengers.[36]\n\nThe 2 Line of Sound Transit's Link light rail system is planned to run from Seattle through Mercer Island and Bellevue before ending in Redmond. The $3.7 billion project was approved by voters in 2008 as part of the Sound Transit 2 ballot measure.[37] It began construction in 2016 and was scheduled to begin service in 2023, but was later delayed to 2024 due to construction issues.[38] The first section, from South Bellevue station to Redmond Technology station in Overlake, opened on April 27, 2024.[39]\n\nThe Bellevue City Council lobbied Sound Transit, the regional transit authority, to construct its light rail line underground through Bellevue's rapidly growing downtown.[40] The city government promised to devote between $104 million and $150 million toward a potential tunnel in the form of cash, services, free access to rights-of-way and one-time tax revenues that result from the East Link project. In November 2011, the city council signed an agreement with Sound Transit.[41] Tunnel construction started in early 2016 while the remainder of downtown Bellevue construction began in mid-2017.[42] As of July 2023, former Bellevue City Council member Claudia Balducci was a member of the Sound Transit Board of Directors.[43]\n\nThe City of Bellevue has undertaken an extensive \"Bel-Red Area Transformation\" process which seeks to plan some 900 acres (3.6 km2) in the Spring District in the city's northern portion,[44] all of which has been premised on the extension of light rail to the Eastside under Sound Transit 2.[45] The top-down and highly integrated land use and transportation planning has been similar to earlier planning for the Downtown.\n\nBellevue was also served by a railroad, a Burlington Northern branch line known as the Woodinville Subdivision, which included the historic Wilburton Trestle. The line is now disused, though part of the track bed at Wilburton Station will be reused by Sound Transit's light-rail construction.[46] Construction of Eastrail, a rail trail on the abandoned Woodinville Subdivision right of way through Bellevue, is planned to be completed in 2023. Some sections of the railroad in Bellevue were demolished in 2008 to make way for the expansion of I-405 and will require the construction of additional structures to supplement the existing right of way.[47]\n\nThe city once had an operating airfield named Bellevue Airfield, which shut down in 1983.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nBellevue has a council-manager form of government with seven non-partisan council members elected at large for staggered four-year terms.[48] The City Council selects a Mayor from among its members (not by popular vote), who serves as council chair for two years but has no veto power. As of 2022 , the mayor is Lynne Robinson and the deputy mayor is Jared Nieuwenhuis.[49] The mayor administrates council meetings, helps set the issues on the council's meeting agendas, and serves as the city's most visible spokesperson. Operational authority is held by the city manager, who administers the city's day-to-day activities. The city manager is also elected by the seven members of the council instead of by popular vote.\n\nPolitically, the city leans strongly Democratic,[citation needed] much like the Seattle/King County area as a whole.[citation needed] Of the 61,742 residents who cast ballots in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, 66.11% voted for Hillary Clinton, compared to 24.58% for Donald Trump.[50][failed verification]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bellevue School District\n\nThe vast majority of the city is served by the Bellevue School District.[51] There are four main public high schools – Bellevue High School, Interlake High School, Newport High School, and Sammamish High School – as well as two choice lottery high schools, International School and Big Picture School. Newsweek's 2015 ranking of U.S. public high schools placed Interlake at #359 and Newport at #391, with both schools noted for equitably helping low-income students meet average scores on standardized tests.[52]\n\nPortions of Bellevue also lie within the boundaries of Lake Washington School District, Renton School District and Issaquah School District.[51]\n\nAt the higher education level the city is home to Bellevue College, part of the Washington Community and Technical Colleges system.\n\nBellevue is home to Open Window School, an independent school serving gifted students from kindergarten through eighth grade. The Jewish Day School of Metropolitan Seattle is located in Bellevue, serving students from Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 8. At the elementary level, Bellevue is home to several Montessori schools,[citation needed] the Eastside's only Waldorf education at Three Cedars School, as well as Bellevue Christian School. The Seattle Japanese School, a Japanese weekend supplementary school, holds its classes in Bellevue.[53]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nBellevue is an economic hub of the Seattle region's Eastside and home to the headquarters of various sizes, including the U.S. operations for many international firms. Since 2005, the city has become a hub for software engineering and other technology development centers. These include PACCAR Inc, T-Mobile US, Eddie Bauer, SAP Concur, and Symetra. Bellevue hosts a number of satellite offices for large technology companies such as eBay, Meta, ByteDance, Oracle, Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft; Microsoft was at one point headquartered in Bellevue but has since moved to the neighboring community of Redmond, Washington. Celebrated video game companies Valve, Bungie, Sucker Punch Productions, and The Pokémon Company International are also based here.\n\nIn 2019, Amazon[54] and Facebook[55] announced plans to open large engineering centers in Bellevue with plans to add several thousand employees.[56] In 2018, Google also opened a major engineering facility in downtown Bellevue.[57] As of 2020 , there are several high-rise office buildings in Downtown Bellevue that are under construction or in active planning and design phases, including Bellevue 600, part of a major Amazon campus.[58][59] Several high-rise residential buildings are also planned in downtown, spurred in part by future light rail service, on former retail and low-rise commercial lots.[60][61] As of 2024 , Amazon has 12,000 employees in Bellevue and has reduced its workforce in Seattle.[62]\n\nBy the late 2010s, Microsoft had become the largest employer in Bellevue, where it had several offices to supplement its headquarters campus in Redmond. The company's workforce in the city peaked at 9,300 in 2021 and later declined as it consolidated offices at its headquarters and vacated its leased offices pace in Downtown Bellevue and Eastgate.[63] Other technology companies, including ByteDance and The Pokémon Company International, have since expanded their office leases in Downtown Bellevue.[64]\n\nTop Employers\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the City's 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report,[65] the largest employers in the city are:\n\n# Employer Type of Business # of Employees Percentage 1 Amazon Online Retail 11,000 6.62% 2 T-Mobile Cellular Telephone 5,200 3.13% 3 Meta Online Social Network 3,600 2.17% 4 Overlake Hospital Medical Center Medical Hospital 3,600 2.17% 5 Bellevue School District Education K‐12 2,800 1.68% 6 City of Bellevue Government 1,700 1.02% 7 Salesforce Business Services 1,500 0.90% 8 Smartsheet Technology 1,100 0.66% 9 Bellevue College Higher Education 1,000 0.60% 10 Bungie Video Game Developer 1,000 0.60% — Total employers — 32,500 19.55%\n\nThe city has numerous thriving commercial districts, with four major shopping centers: Bellevue Square in the downtown area, Factoria Mall to the south, Crossroads Mall to the east, and the Overlake Shopping District in the north.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1900254—1910150−40.9%19201,213708.7%19301,071−11.7%19401,1779.9%19507,658550.6%196012,80967.3%197061,196377.8%198073,90320.8%199086,87417.6%2000109,56926.1%2010122,36311.7%2020151,85424.1%2023 (est.)151,574[5]−0.2%\n\nAs of 2018, one in three Bellevue residents was born outside the United States, most likely due to the prevalence of multinational technology companies in the city. Around 23% of Bellevue's well-educated workforce are in engineering or science-related industries. About half of its residents identify as a person of color or ethnic minority.\n\nAccording to a 2018 estimate, the median income for a household in the city was $113,698.[10] In a 2020 survey of Centers for Disease Control data, Bellevue was ranked first among small U.S. cities with the highest percentage of physically active adults, with 86 percent reporting that they exercise.[67]\n\nIn 2006, Bellevue was rated one of the 25 safest cities in America,[68] based on the per-capita incidence of violent crime.\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nBellevue, Washington – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

In 1987 the festival was resumed as a one evening event, and in 2003 it was expanded back to a multi-day festival.[74]\n\nBellevue is host to the Northwest Ukrainian International Festival, founded in 2017 and one of the largest Ukrainian culture festivals in the United States.[75] Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the Grand Kyiv Ballet has been based at the International Ballet Academy in Bellevue.[76]\n\nPlaces of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bellevue Arts Museum first opened in 1975, then moved to Bellevue Square in 1983. In 2001, the museum moved into its own building, designed by Steven Holl. The museum subsequently ran into financial difficulties and was closed to the public in 2003. After a lengthy fundraising campaign, a remodel, and a new mission to become a national center for the fine art of craft and design, the museum reopened on June 18, 2005 with an exhibition of teapots.[77]\n\nThe Rosalie Whyel Museum of Doll Art – now closed – contained one of the largest doll collections in the world—more than a thousand dolls—displayed on two floors of a Victorian-style building,[78] which is now the site of the KidsQuest Children's Museum.\n\nNear Interstate 405 is Meydenbauer Center, a convention center that brings corporate meetings and charity events to the downtown area. Meydenbauer also includes a 410-seat theater which attracts operas, ballets, and orchestral performances.[79]\n\nThe city government has planned to build a performing arts center, tentatively named the Tateuchi Center (named for philanthropist Ina Tateuchi), since the 1980s.[80] It would include a 2,000-seat concert hall, offices, and creative spaces at a site in Downtown Bellevue. The $200 million project is partially funded with private donations and grants from the city and county governments.[81]\n\nSports and recreation\n\n[edit]\n\nSince the 1970s, the city has taken an active role in ensuring that its commercial development does not overwhelm its natural land and water resources.[82] Today, the Bellevue Parks and Community Services Department manages more than 2,500 acres (10 km2) of parks and open spaces, including the Downtown Park and the Bellevue Botanical Garden, as well as several playgrounds, beach parks, and trails. More than 5,500 Bellevue residents participate in volunteer activities through this department annually.[83]\n\nBellevue was home to the American Basketball Association team, the Bellevue Blackhawks. The Blackhawks in 2005, despite being ranked 13th in the league, made it to the championship game in front of 15,000 fans in Little Rock, Arkansas.[84] The team has been inactive since 2006.[85]\n\nThe city has a small baseball stadium, Bannerwood Park, that has a listed capacity of 700 spectators.[86] The Seattle Redhawks of the Western Athletic Conference, an NCAA Division I baseball team, have played their home games in Bellevue since 2010.[87]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nWilliam S.
