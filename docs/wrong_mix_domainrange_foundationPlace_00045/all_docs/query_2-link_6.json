        "text": "OpenGov Voices: With Bellevue’s data, itâs quality over quantity\n\nWhen the city of Bellevue, Wash., launched its open data portal last month, it made a conscious effort to present targeted datasets that would be useful to residents. Â\n\nNow, thanks to the ongoing transparency initiative, visitors to the portal can find datasets that help illuminate Bellevueâs economy, neighborhoods, public safety, budget and efforts to be green, among other things.\n\nâWe targeted high-value data sets for the launch,â said Sabra Schneider, chief operations officer in the Information Technology Department. âThe open data and open budget sites are an important step in continuing Bellevueâs work to be more innovative, data-driven and responsive to our growing communities.â\n\nBellevue is a city of about 130,000 people, across Lake Washington from Seattle. Itâs a high-tech hub, with 50,000 employed in that sector. The community is also known as âa city in a park,â due to an extensive network of parks and trails.\n\nWant to know about Bellevueâs economic growth and competitiveness? You wonât have to wade through dozens of stats. Instead, four datasets can give you a good picture:\n\nNew registered businesses over the last year;\n\nA map of tech startups that have registered with the city;\n\nCensus data regarding Bellevueâs labor force and household income; and\n\nEstimates of total employment in Bellevue over the last 15 years.\n\nHow safe is Bellevue? Datasets cover numbers of different crimes by city district and particular crimes by month. How easy is it to get around the city? Check out a live traffic map showing congestion on major streets. The map is updated every minute.\n\nBellevue has made an effort to focus on results for years, using resident surveys to guide its budget and programs. Last year, the city rolled out performance dashboards, whichÂ present 52 indicators in automatically updated, easy-to-read bar charts.\n\nThe open data portal is another step toward helping the city share its progress in achieving intended results with residents and other stakeholders. The site also presents Bellevueâs budget and expenditures in an interactive, graphic interface.\n\nBellevueâs open data portal is part of the What Work Cities initiative. WWC is one of the largest-ever efforts to enhance the use of data and evidence in the public sector. Launched in April 2015, the $42 million initiative is already providing support to city halls in dozens of cities nationwide and will admit up to 100 on a rolling basis through 2017. Bellevue was selected to participate in December.\n\nâWe are excited to work with the talented civic- and technology-minded people in our region to further enhance government services and the use of the data,â said Schneider. Â\n\nBellevue plans to use the open data portal to increase the use of data and evidence to improve services, inform local decision-making and further engage residents in government performance. The city will add selected data collections as they become available.\n\nInterested in writing a guest blog for Sunlight? Email us at guestblog@sunlightfoundation.com"
