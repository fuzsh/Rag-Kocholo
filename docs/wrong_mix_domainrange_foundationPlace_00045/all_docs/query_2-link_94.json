        "text": "Your Difference Is in Your Data\n\nYesterday, data was simply stored and managed. Today, data is an essential differentiator. At Quantum, we believe it's time to shift the focus from accumulating data to making it work much harder. It’s a new data reality that’s endlessly alive. It’s massively growing, widely distributed, unstructured, and it’s gaining value at every turn. Your video and unstructured data not only needs to be fully protected, but it is also full of possibility. Quantum partners with you so you can shape it, use it, and transform it into the information you need to drive forward. With Quantum, you can enrich, orchestrate, protect, and archive your video and unstructured data, securely and at scale—now and for decades to come.\n\nWith Living Data, the Impossible Becomes the Possible\n\nIt’s not only about managing data. It’s about making sure you can extract value from it to gain a competitive edge. Between 80-90% of data collected today is unstructured. Locked inside these video and audio files, photos, security camera footage, sensor data, scientific data, and satellite imagery is a wealth of information that holds the key to informed decision-making.\n\nWe enable a world where data is alive. We make it right-time, right-place data so it’s available, discoverable, and safe. With Quantum, you have the insights you need to drive new opportunities, explore new paths, or accelerate the next groundbreaking discovery. Our bold, innovative, end-to-end data solutions allow forward-thinking organizations—like yours—to harness the enriched world of living data."
