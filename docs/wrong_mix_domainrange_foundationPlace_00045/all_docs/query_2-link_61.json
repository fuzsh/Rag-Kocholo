        "text": "Research areas\n\nResearch in the Seattle area spans a variety of disciplines, including, applied mathematics, causal reasoning, computer vision, data science, deep learning, explainable AI, forecasting, mathematical optimization, applied microeconomics, behavioral economics, econometrics, natural language processing, natural language understanding, and recommender systems, among others.\n\nWorking in Seattle and Bellevue\n\nAmazon provides scientists room to take risks and fail; a community for collaboration and support for continued learning; and the opportunity to have an impact at global scale. Scientists are encouraged to engage with the research community in many forms, from attending conferences and writing research papers, to contributing to open-source code, and public datasets.\n\nSeattle, the Emerald City, is known for its year-round greenery. The area has much to explore, with a vibrant arts and theater community, acres of public parks, museums, several professional sports teams, and different outdoor activities for all seasons – like taking a day trip to hike Mount Rainier.\n\nLocated only 10 miles from downtown Seattle, Bellevue offers the best of the Pacific Northwest. Downtown Bellevue offers the Bellevue Arts Museum, Botanical Garden, many nearby parks and is considered the jewel of the Eastside. Additional Eastside communities like Kirkland, Redmond and Issaquah are only minutes away and with highly rated public schools.\n\nCollaborations\n\nOur Seattle-area scientists collaborate with universities and other institutions around the globe.
