The data on these dashboards help us monitor early signs of disease spread, severity of illness, vaccination rates, virus variants or subtypes occurring in Washington, and hospital bed use due to COVID-19, flu, and RSV.\n\nInstead of showing data by individual counties, these dashboards use larger regional areas called Accountable Communities of Health (ACH). This change was made because sometimes there is not enough data reported from the county level to display publicly while maintaining an individual’s privacy.\n\nAdditional COVID-19 hospital admission data at the county level is available in the CDC COVID Data Tracker: Maps by Geographic Area.\n\nLearn how to stop the spread of these illnesses by visiting our COVID-19, flu, and RSV pages.\n\nDashboard Data Notes\n\nWednesday, July 17, 2024: Laboratory data for influenza is current through July 6, 2024. Death data for COVID-19, RSV, and influenza are current through July 6, 2024. All other data on this dashboard are current through July 13, 2024.\n\nData for influenza and RSV immunizations will no longer be updated for the 2023-2024 season; updates will resume in September for the 2024-2025 season. Data for COVID-19 immunizations is current through July 15, 2024.\n\nSummary Data Tables\n\nStatewide Summary for COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV\n\nInformation shown below is for the most recent week with complete data.\n\nStatewide Summary Measure COVID-19 Flu RSV Percent of All Hospital Admissions 1.7 0.1 0 Percent Change in Hospitalization Visits from Previous Week -19 -50 Percent of All Emergency Department Visits 1.8 0.2 0 Percent Change in Emergency Care Visits from Previous Week -5.3 0\n\nAverage Weekly Occupancy in Hospitals and Intensive Care Units\n\nEvery day, acute care hospitals in Washington report their COVID-19 patient occupancy to the Department of Health through WA-HEALTH, a hospital data collection system developed in partnership with the Washington State Hospital Association.

We present information for the following categories of data:\n\nEmergency Department (ED) Visits\n\nHospital Admissions/Hospitalizations\n\nDeaths\n\nPositive Clinical Tests (Cases)\n\nCOVID-19 Variants\n\nInfluenza (Flu) Subtypes\n\nHospital Use\n\nHealth Disparities\n\nSuppression for Small Numbers\n\nPopulation Denominator Data\n\nFor each category, there may be detailed information on the data source, data lags and limitations, definitions, calculations, and additional resources and references. For more information about the Respiratory Illness Dashboard data, email DOH-CDS-Surveillance@doh.wa.gov.\n\nEmergency Department (ED) Visits\n\nData Source\n\nThe data for emergency department visits are obtained from the Washington State Department of Health Rapid Information Health Network (RHINO) program. All non-federal emergency departments and their associated inpatient units report health care encounter data in near real-time to RHINO. Key data elements reported include:\n\nPatient demographic information (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, and sex)\n\nClinical information (e.g., diagnosis codes)\n\nAdditional visit information (e.g., length of stay, admission information, and discharge information)\n\nLearn more about RHINO data here: RHINO Data Description\n\nData Limitations\n\nData are not final and may change. Visits reflect unique encounters, not unique persons, and are not considered cases. Additional follow-up is required for every visit in order to determine if a patient meets the appropriate criteria as defined in the ED Visit Definitions section below.\n\nData Lags\n\nInformation added to a medical record, such as a diagnosis code, is reported to RHINO within 24 hours. While we typically see a diagnosis code within 2 to 4 days of a visit, diagnosis codes are dependent on the facility workflow and medical coding capacity; therefore, there may be longer delays in reporting that information.\n\nED Visit Definitions\n\nCOVID-19: Emergency department visits associated with COVID-19 include records that contained one or more of the following COVID-19 specific ICD 10-CM discharge diagnosis codes:\n\nU07.1 (COVID-19)\n\nJ12.82 (Pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019)\n\nInfluenza: Emergency department visits associated with Influenza include records that contained one or more of the following Influenza specific ICD 10-CM discharge diagnosis codes:\n\nJ09 (Influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses)\n\nJ10 (Influenza due to other identified influenza virus)\n\nJ11 (Influenza due to unidentified influenza virus)\n\nRSV: Emergency department visits associated with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) include records that contained one or more of the following RSV specific ICD 10-CM discharge diagnosis codes:\n\nB97.4 (Respiratory syncytial virus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere)\n\nJ12.1 (Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia)\n\nJ20.5 (Acute bronchitis due to respiratory syncytial virus)\n\nJ21.0 (Acute bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus)\n\nDemographics\n\nAge (all ages and pediatrics): Age less than one year was calculated in months at time of visit, otherwise age is in years at time of visit.\n\nSex: Value Set Information\n\nRace: Value Set Information\n\nEthnicity: Value Set Information\n\nHospital Admissions/Hospitalizations\n\nData Source\n\nThe data for emergency department visits are obtained from the Washington State Department of Health Rapid Information Health Network (RHINO) program.

While we typically see a diagnosis code within 2 to 4 days of a visit, diagnosis codes are dependent on the facility workflow and medical coding capacity; therefore, there may be longer delays in reporting that information.\n\nHospitalization Definitions\n\nCOVID-19: Hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 include records that contained one or more of the following COVID-19 specific ICD 10-CM discharge diagnosis codes:\n\nU07.1 (COVID-19)\n\nJ12.82 (Pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019)\n\nInfluenza: Hospitalizations associated with influenza include records that contained one or more of the following influenza specific ICD 10-CM discharge diagnosis codes:\n\nJ09 (Influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses)\n\nJ10 (Influenza due to other identified influenza virus)\n\nJ11 (Influenza due to unidentified influenza virus)\n\nRSV: Hospitalizations associated with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) include records that contained one or more of the following RSV specific ICD 10-CM discharge diagnosis codes:\n\nB97.4 (Respiratory syncytial virus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere)\n\nJ12.1 (Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia)\n\nJ20.5 (Acute bronchitis due to respiratory syncytial virus)\n\nJ21.0 (Acute bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus)\n\nDemographics\n\nAge (all ages and pediatrics): Age less than one year was calculated in months at time of visit, otherwise age is in years at time of visit.\n\nSex: Value Set Information\n\nRace: Value Set Information\n\nEthnicity: Value Set Information\n\nDeaths\n\nData Source\n\nThe data for COVID-19 and RSV deaths are obtained from the registered death certificates for WA residents, which are housed in the Washington Health and Life Event System (WHALES).\n\nDeath Rate is calculated by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths with a death date within a 7-day period by the state population and multiplying by 100,000:\n\nNumber of deaths with a date of death during the 7-day period :over:\n\nPopulation\n\nX :times: 100,000\n\nPotential lab-confirmed influenza-associated deaths are reported through multiple sources including:\n\nRegistered death certificates\n\nDirect report from health care facilities\n\nCollaboration with medical examiners\n\nInfluenza-associated deaths are investigated by Local Health Jurisdictions and information is stored in the Washington Disease Reporting System (WDRS).\n\nData Limitations\n\nCOVID-19:\n\nCOVID-19 death data may be underrepresented due to various factors that currently and historically impact reporting. Only death data reported officially to Washington State through death certificates and positive reported labs into WDRS reporting system are used in the counts in the dashboard. COVID-19 deaths early in the pandemic may not have been captured and reported due to the lack of available testing. Currently, deaths of persons who only tested with a home testing kit, may not have had COVID-19 listed as a cause of death, and are not counted.\n\nA small portion of deaths may not have been counted due to coding limitations related to nonstandard naming practices of “COVID-19” and inconsistent use of diagnosis codes for the cause of death on the death certificate. On January 1, 2023, DOH implemented a new classification of COVID-19 death. The new classification aligns with emerging standards; however, probable cases of COVID-19 death are no longer counted and may result in missed counts of COVID-19 deaths.\n\nInfluenza:\n\nInfluenza deaths are likely underreported. The reasons for this underreporting vary. Influenza may not be listed as a cause of death, influenza testing may not have occurred in a timely fashion to identify the virus, or may not have been performed at all, and lab-confirmed influenza-associated deaths may not have been appropriately reported to public health.\n\nThese counts reflect only deaths officially reported to the Washington State Department of Health. Each influenza season is reported as week 40 through week 39 of the following year. Note that due to reporting lag, counts may be different at the county or region level. Only deaths reported by the county as “investigation complete” are included in the official Washington State Department of Health counts.\n\nRSV: RSV death reporting and surveillance has no national standard and relies only on information in the cause of death fields on the death certificate. These data capture any death with a specific mention of RSV, but do not show a difference between deaths where RSV was the underlying cause of death or deaths for which RSV was a contributing factor. Due to coding differences, analyses based on the diagnosis codes assigned to the cause of death fields may result in slightly different death counts, as the diagnosis code assignment algorithm prioritizes terms differently.\n\nData Lags\n\nCOVID-19 and RSV: Deaths are typically registered within one week, but deaths relying on post-mortem testing can take months to get the cause of death information updated. This is not usually a huge problem with natural deaths, but it can happen.\n\nInfluenza: Data are available on Wednesdays for the complete epi week 2 weeks prior (e.g., on Wednesday 8/30/2023 data will be available through epi week 33 ending 8/19/2023).\n\nDefinitions\n\nCOVID-19: Currently, a COVID-19 death is any mention of COVID-19 or similar term on a death certificate. Before January 1, 2023, a COVID-19 death was any mention of COVID-19 or other equal term associated with a positive COVID-19 test, or a natural death associated with a positive COVID-19 test shortly before death.\n\nInfluenza: A lab-confirmed influenza-associated death is defined as a death resulting directly or indirectly from an illness that was confirmed to be influenza by an appropriate laboratory test. There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.\n\nRSV: Any mention of RSV or similar anywhere on the death certificate.\n\nPositive Clinical Tests (Cases)\n\nData Source\n\nThe data for reported Positive COVID-19 Clinical Tests (Cases) are obtained from the Washington Disease Reporting System (WDRS), statewide surveillance.\n\nWeekly Rate: The weekly trend in case rate refers to the trend in weekly rate of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population. It is calculated by dividing the number of cases with a specimen collection date during a given epi week by the state population (or appropriate geographic population) and multiplying it by 100,000.\n\nTotal positive clinical cases with a specimen collection date during a given week :over:\n\nPopulation\n\nX :times: 100,000\n\nInfluenza testing data is received through the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratory networks. Public health and clinical laboratories voluntarily report influenza testing data to CDC through this lab network. We display data reported to CDC by clinical laboratories. Influenza A and B are reported separately.\n\nData Limitations\n\nCOVID-19: Case data entered into WDRS includes data only for individuals who received a positive test performed at CLIA certified or CLIA waived laboratories. Cases identified only through home tests are not represented in the data. In addition, Washington residents tested in other states are generally not included in the data set. Therefore, case data represented on the dashboard underestimates the true number of people infected with COVID-19 in Washington and may be biased towards certain populations more likely to receive tests in a health care setting.\n\nInfluenza: Data reported through the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratory networks is anonymized and aggregated, therefore no information on patient demographics is available. Influenza is not a notifiable condition; the voluntarily reported testing data is not a representative sample of influenza tests performed across the state. Due to the voluntary nature of this network, laboratories are selected for their willingness to participate and are not a representative network across Washington.\n\nData Lags\n\nCOVID-19: Data are published on Wednesdays for the previous complete epi/Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) week (e.g. on Wednesday 8/20/2023 data will be available through epi week 32 ending 8/26/2023). We consider published data to be >90% complete for each epi week.\n\nInfluenza: Data are available on Wednesdays for the complete epi week 2 weeks prior (e.g., on Wednesday 8/30/2023 data will be available through epi week 33 ending 8/19/2023).\n\nDefinitions\n\nCOVID-19: For purposes of this dashboard, an individual with a positive clinical test is equivalent to a confirmed COVID-19 case. COVID-19 Cases are individuals with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test, from a CLIA-certified provider or laboratory; or SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by genomic sequencing (PDF).\n\nInfluenza: Public health and clinical laboratories voluntarily report anonymized influenza testing data to CDC through a lab network. Influenza is only notifiable if a death occurs in a patient with a positive influenza test result with a clinically compatible illness. See our Influenza Associated Death Reporting and Investigation Guideline (PDF).\n\nDemographics\n\nCOVID-19\n\nAge (all ages and pediatrics): COVID-19 affects people of any age. However, older age is a significant factor for developing more serious outcomes following COVID-19 infection.\n\nSex: COVID-19 affects people of any sex. However, monitoring individuals with COVID-19 by sex may reveal differences in testing or in their outcomes following infection.\n\nRace and Ethnicity:\n\nCOVID-19 affects people of all races and ethnicities, but some racial and ethnic minority groups are unfairly affected by COVID-19 due to systemic health and social inequalities. Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible.\n\nWe present COVID-19 outcomes by race and ethnicity to address health inequalities among different racial and ethnic minority groups. Differences in length of life, quality of life, rates of disease, severity of disease, and access to treatment often expose health and social inequities. These categories allow us to assess our COVID-19 data by race and ethnicity, but the data are incomplete and do not reflect the diversity of people and experiences across the state. Since January 2020, a significant number of reported Positive COVID-19 Clinical Tests (Cases) are currently missing race (about 33%) and ethnicity (about 38%) information.\n\nCapturing race and ethnicity information through COVID-19 lab test results is very challenging. The lack of complete data limits our ability to draw strong conclusions. Despite these limitations, the patterns of racial and ethnic health disparities are visible in the data.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThere is no demographic information available for anonymized and aggregated influenza lab testing data. Lab testing data reported into this network are anonymized and reported as weekly aggregate counts of tests.\n\nCOVID-19 Variants\n\nData Source\n\nSARS-CoV-2 sequencing data is pulled from the Washington Disease Reporting System (WDRS) Sequence table. Percentages are calculated by grouping the sequence data by assigned variant groups following the CDC Variant Proportion groupings by two-week intervals.\n\nData Limitations\n\nVariant detection depends on sequencing volume. When we have fewer sequences available to test, we are less likely to detect variants circulating at low levels.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 sequences are more readily available from urban areas and the Western part of Washington. This means that surveillance sequencing data are not totally representative, and our situational awareness varies by geographic region.\n\nData Lags\n\nDue to the time it takes to complete sequencing, the most recent time period is based on a very small number of sequences and likely to be adjusted over time as more data becomes available; this may affect data from prior time periods. There is about a 2.5-week delay in the time a specimen is collected, sequenced, linked to a case, and made available in WDRS.\n\nDefinitions\n\nCOVID-19 Variants: The original SARS-CoV-2 virus strain has mutated over the course of the pandemic. Some of these mutations resulted in new variants of the virus. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been found in the United States and globally. View the list of Variants on CDC’s SARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions webpage.\n\nInfluenza (Flu) Subtypes\n\nData Source\n\nInfluenza testing data is obtained through the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratory networks. Public health and clinical laboratories voluntarily report influenza testing data to CDC through a lab network. Influenza subtype A and B are reported separately. A subset of influenza positive samples is further tested and subtyped at participating Public Health laboratories. We show the result of this subtyping on the dashboard.\n\nData Limitations\n\nData reported through the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratory networks is anonymized and aggregated, therefore no information on patient demographics is available. Influenza is not a notifiable condition; the voluntarily reported testing data is not a representative sample of influenza tests performed across the state. Due to the voluntary nature of this network, laboratories are selected for their willingness to participate and are not a representative network across Washington.\n\nData Lags\n\nData are available on Wednesdays for the complete epi week 2 weeks prior (e.g., on Wednesday 8/30/2023 data will be available through epi week 33 ending 8/19/2023).\n\nDefinition\n\nFlu Subtypes: Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease in people (known as flu season) almost every winter in the United States.\n\nInfluenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on 2 proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).\n\nInfluenza B viruses are not divided into subtypes, but instead are further classified into 2 lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria.\n\nThe dashboard shows influenza positive tests that had subtype testing performed by a public health laboratory. Data from public health laboratories are used to monitor the proportion of circulating viruses that belong to each influenza subtype/lineage. For more information on the types of influenza viruses, see the CDC's flu virus types webpage.\n\nHospital Use\n\nData Source\n\nWA HEALTH is Washington’s Healthcare, Emergency, and Logistics Tracking Hub. Acute care hospitals submit data to WA HEALTH daily, dashboard metrics are assigned to the geographic location of facilities, not a patient’s area of residence. Interpret regional data with caution.\n\nData Limitations\n\nData quality may be impacted when facilities experience power outages or technical difficulties and are unable to report data in a timely manner. Note: Between 10/4/2022 and 12/22/2022, one of Washington's larger health care providers did not report to WA HEALTH due to a cybersecurity attack.\n\nWA HEALTH does not collect data for RSV.\n\nData is self-reported by acute care facility.\n\nData Lags\n\nIt takes up to 6 days for data collection, quality checks, and reporting.\n\nDefinitions\n\nHospital Beds in Use: The hospital occupancy metric refers to the 7-day average number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 or influenza. It is calculated by adding the total number of pediatric and adult COVID-19 hospitalizations during a 7-day period and dividing by 7.\n\nAdult + pediatric confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations over 7 days :over:\n\n7\n\nPercent Hospital Occupancy (tooltip): This metric refers to the percent of acute care hospital beds in use by COVID-19 or influenza patients. It is calculated by adding the total number of pediatric and adult COVID-19 hospitalizations during a 7-day period and dividing it by the total number of beds in use, then multiplying it by 100.\n\nAdult + pediatric confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations over 7 days :over:\n\nSum of staffed hospital bed occupancy over 7 days\n\nX :times: 100\n\nICU Beds in Use: The ICU bed occupancy metric is a subset of the hospital beds in use metric. It refers to the 7-day average number of people in an intensive care unit bed (ICU) with confirmed COVID-19 or influenza.\n\nAdult + pediatric confirmed COVID-19 (or influenza) ICU occupants :over:\n\n7\n\nPercent ICU Occupancy: This metric refers to the percent of ICU beds (subset of percent Hospital Occupancy) in use by COVID-19 or influenza patients. It is calculated by adding the total number of COVID-19 ICU patients and dividing it by ICU beds in use.\n\nAdult + pediatric confirmed COVID-19 or influenza ICU occupants :over:\n\nSum of ICU beds occupancy over 7 days\n\nHealth Disparities\n\nHealth disparities are gaps in the quality of health and health care that mirror differences in social factors such as economic status, racial and ethnic background, gender, age, and education level.\n\nHealth disparities on the Respiratory Illness Data Dashboard can be observed when looking at different demographic factors such as age, sex, and race/ethnicity. An explanation of these factors and some of the health disparities observed for the respiratory illness displayed on this dashboard are described below.\n\nAge (all age groups and pediatric age groups): Respiratory illnesses affect people of any age. However, older age is a significant factor for developing more serious outcomes following COVID-19, influenza, and RSV infection.\n\nChildren younger than 5, but especially children younger than 2 years old, are at higher risk of complications from flu illness.\n\nInfants up to 12 months, especially those 6 months and younger are at higher risk of RSV.\n\nSex: Respiratory illnesses affect people of any sex. However, monitoring individuals with respiratory infections by sex may reveal differences in testing or in their outcomes following infection. Data for transgender or nonbinary people are not shown on the Respiratory Illness Dashboard. DOH is working on improving data collection practices to be more inclusive of all gender identities and will release more information as this becomes available to improve the overall quality of the health disparities data.\n\nRace and Ethnicity:\n\nCOVID-19, flu, and RSV affect people of all races and ethnicities, but some racial and ethnic minority groups are unfairly affected by these diseases due to systemic health and social inequities. Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their highest level of health possible.\n\nWe present respiratory illnesses on this dashboard by race and ethnicity to better identify health disparities that may exist among different racial and ethnic minority groups. Differences in length of life, quality of life, rates of disease, severity of disease, and access to treatment often expose health and social inequities.\n\nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN)\n\nData show that AIAN populations have greater physical and mental health disparities than other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. However, the current methods we use to identify race and ethnicity make it challenging to determine the real impact of health outcomes among AIAN populations in Washington state.\n\nThe data sources we use to identify race and ethnicity include medical records, laboratory reports, and sometimes, case interviews managed by state, local, and tribal health jurisdictions. To help us further identify AIAN individuals, we cross check COVID-19 cases reported to WDRS against a state-wide list of tribal members to make sure we correctly identify American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n\nThe current methods we use to collect information about race and ethnicity often lead to missing or wrong information.\n\nWe are missing about 33% of race and 38% of ethnicity information for positive COVID-19 clinical test data.\n\nOur methods often wrongly classify AIAN as other races or ethnicities with up to 25% wrongly classified as white alone. Our methods often wrongly classify AIAN individuals as Hispanic/Latinx and multiple race.\n\nDOH is working with tribes and tribal partners to continue to improve how we identify health outcomes in the AIAN population. We know the cost of missing or wrong information has negative impacts on public health planning, policy creation, and the wider sharing of resources that impact AIAN health.\n\nData Limitations\n\nInfluenza: There is no demographic information available for anonymized and aggregated influenza lab testing data. Lab testing data reported into this network are anonymized and reported as weekly aggregate counts of tests.\n\nRace and Ethnicity Data:\n\nThese categories allow us to assess our COVID-19 data by race and ethnicity, but the data are incomplete and do not reflect the diversity of people and experiences across the state. Since January 2020, a significant number of reported Positive COVID-19 Clinical Tests (Cases) are currently missing race (about 33%) and ethnicity (about 38%) information.\n\nCapturing race and ethnicity information through COVID-19 lab test results is very challenging. The lack of complete data limits our ability to draw strong conclusions. Despite these limitations, the patterns of racial and ethnic health disparities are visible in the data.\n\nReferences for Understanding Health Disparities\n\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 2003. “The Health and Physique of the Negro American.” American Journal of Public Health 93(2):272-276.\n\nHood, Carlyn M., Keith P.

Counts for some age categories may be small, especially in small counties. Therefore, we do not report counts if there are less than 10 in a category. We take additional measures to prevent recalculating these small counts by reporting data in related columns and rows. This data is not included in dashboard tables and downloadable files. Our policy for reporting small numbers (PDF) balances privacy protection with the public’s need for data.\n\nPopulation Denominator Data\n\nDue to the current lack of Small Area Estimates from Office of Financial Management (OFM), the population data used to calculate rates in this dashboard come from the Population Interim Estimates (PIE) developed by Public Health-Seattle and King County (PHSKC). Because we have applied PIE to historic data, some COVID-19 rates will be different from what we published previously."
