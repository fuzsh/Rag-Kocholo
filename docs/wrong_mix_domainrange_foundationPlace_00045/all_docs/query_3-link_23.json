        "text": "There‚Äôs always a lot of buzz in the news about Bellevue ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs related to the growing business community or burgeoning real estate. With so much going on, we wanted to take a deeper dive into the area and rediscover why so many people ‚Äî maybe even you ‚Äî love to call it home.\n\nüí° Need to know\n\nBellevue is known for housing the headquarters of prominent businesses like Bungie, Eddie Bauer, Pok√©mon, T-Mobile, and Valve. Other companies with major office branches in the city include Microsoft, Boeing, Nokia, and Samsung.\n\nThe city is also regularly featured on lists like ‚ÄúBest Cities to Live In,‚Äù ‚ÄúCities with the Best Public Schools,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSafest Cities in America.‚Äù\n\nAs for its residents, Bellevue is made up of one of the most diverse populations in the metro area with ~39% from 90 different foreign countries.\n\nüèó The early days\n\nThough not registered as a city until 1953, settlers moved to the area in 1863, which had been previously inhabited by the Duwamish. Lake Washington played a major role in keeping the town pretty isolated (it wasn‚Äôt personal, we swear) until the Leschi ferry was introduced in 1913 and the floating bridge in 1940.\n\nBellevue hit its stride soon after. From 1953 to 1970, Bellevue‚Äôs population grew from ~5,490 to around 60,000, and by 2000 ‚Äî even with ~112,000 residents ‚Äî there were more jobs there than locals. Today, the population stands at ~150,000.\n\nüëÄ Can‚Äôt miss\n\nA quick tour of the city isn‚Äôt complete without a stop in the Bellevue Downtown Park ‚Äî a 21-acre green space nestled right in the heart of all the action with a creatively designed playground, 240-ft waterfall, reflecting pool, and gorgeous skyline view.\n\nIf you‚Äôre heading over during the holidays, trust us and do not leave until you check out Snowflake Lane. The organizers pulled all the stops with this holiday extravaganza that features daily parades, falling snow, and a beautifully decorated downtown strip.\n\nüå≥ Outdoors\n\nBellevue Botanical Garden | With 53 acres of flowers, this park is divided into 13 smaller gardens ‚Äî all organized to build the most breathtaking experiences.\n\nWeowna Park | This 90-acre park is a perfect spot to get away from city life ‚Äî without the long road trip ‚Äî featuring old growth forest trails, babbling creeks, and whimsical waterfalls.\n\nNorthwest Team Building courses | Take your coworkers, family, partner, or just yourself through two hours of aerial obstacle courses ‚Äî or through the trees on a zip-line tour.\n\nüçΩ Eat + drink\n\nTakai by Kashiba | Try cured + fermented dishes from chef Jun Takai, a pupil of famed Seattle sushi master Shiro Kashiba.\n\nMonsoon | Seattleites probably know this restaurant by its Capitol Hill location, but we‚Äôre happy to know we‚Äôre never far away from its lovely lemongrass chicken on the Eastside.\n\nMercato Stellina | A pie with smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage should hit the spot for pizza lovers.\n\nJohn Howie| Sometimes you just need a good steak ‚Äî and this upscale restaurant has plenty of prime options.\n\nJune Bakery | The charming Crossroads cafe should satisfy whatever sweet tooth you have with its Korean cakes and treats.\n\nüéü Entertainment\n\nLucky Strike | Sure, there‚Äôs some pretty fancy looking bowling, but it also has an arcade, a restaurant, and billiards to enjoy.\n\nBellevue Arts Museum | In addition to itstraveling art exhibits, the museum has hands-on classes for young, emerging artists.\n\nReality Break Escapes| We think it‚Äôs good to regularly test your friends and family on their puzzle-solving skills (you never know when you‚Äôre going to have to diffuse a bomb in under an hour)..\n\nüõç Shop\n\nBellevue Farmers Market| Get your locally grown greens and produce at this year-round destination.\n\nMade in Washington | Find the perfect gift basket for your friend who watched your dog for two weeks ‚Äî or keep it yourself when you inevitably forget to give it to them.\n\nBellevue Square | With 200+ shops to choose from, you‚Äôll walk away from this mall extra stylish.\n\nüè° Where to live"
