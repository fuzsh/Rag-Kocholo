        "text": "Happening this September 6-7 in Bellevue, WA, WasmCon will foster collaboration and education among WebAssembly users and developers\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, May 25, 2023 -- The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, today announced the launch of a new event, WasmCon for WebAssembly developers and users. The event will be held on September 6-7, 2023, at the Hyatt Regency in Bellevue, WA, in the greater Seattle metropolitan area.\n\nWasmCon is a two-day conference aimed at providing attendees with the latest information and trends in WebAssembly (Wasm), including use cases, best practices, deep dives, and emerging technologies. The event will feature keynotes, technical sessions, and hands-on workshops led by industry experts and thought leaders, spanning topics relevant to technologists at every level.\n\n\"WebAssembly is transforming the way developers build and deploy secure applications on the web and beyond as use cases expand outside the browser, from edge to server workloads,\" said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO at Cloud Native Computing Foundation and VP of Developer Relations at The Linux Foundation. \"We're excited to bring together the best minds in the WebAssembly community to share knowledge and expertise, focusing on new users and to explore the potential of this powerful technology.\"\n\nWasmCon is designed for developers, engineers, architects, and business leaders interested in the latest developments and use cases for WebAssembly. Attendees will have the opportunity to network with industry experts and learn about the latest tools and technologies that are transforming the way we build and deploy applications.\n\n\"We believe that WebAssembly has a bright and evolving future for many types of workloads, and we're thrilled to host this event to bring together the community and advance the technology,\" said Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of The Linux Foundation.\n\nSupporting Quotes\n\n\"The Bytecode Alliance is delighted to be a Community Sponsor for Linux Foundation WasmCon,\" said Bobby Holley, Chair of the Bytecode Alliance. \"Our objective is to build a better ecosystem. This requires not just better technology, but also bringing people together around that technology to unlock its potential. We're eager to work with every corner of the WebAssembly community to build a secure, efficient, and empowering foundation for the future.\"\n\n“Originally built for the browser, WebAssembly is showing itself to be a versatile technology, with applications from IoT to the cloud,” said Matt Butcher, CEO at Fermyon Technologies. “WasmCon is a fantastic opportunity for a broad range of technologists to explore this fast-growing ecosystem together.”\n\n“Since KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2022, we have seen a lot of adoption for WebAssembly as a lightweight and secure cloud native runtime,” said Michael Yuan, maintainer of the WasmEdge Runtime. “It now runs microservices, serverless functions, data streaming functions, and AI inference in the cloud. I am super excited to see a Linux Foundation conference dedicated to this technology stack!”\n\n“WebAssembly provides a secure and lightweight abstraction that is already being adopted by developers to provide amazing experiences around streaming video, online shopping, and video gaming,” said Liam Randall, CEO at Cosmonic. “We expect the Cambrian explosion of Wasm to continue to accelerate as it is rapidly adopted across the entire technology landscape.”\n\nSubmit to Speak\n\nAll interested parties are welcome to submit proposals to speak.
