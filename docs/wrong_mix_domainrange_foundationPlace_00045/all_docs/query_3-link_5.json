It’s the focal point for entertainment, cultural exchange, shopping and community services for area residents. Bustling, densely populated and richly diverse, Crossroads is characterized by an abundance of large apartment complexes, established single-family neighborhoods and restaurant and retail establishments.\n\nCrossroads Shopping Center, at Northeast Eighth Street and 156th Avenue Northeast, is kind of in the heart of the heart of Bellevue - a hub of activity that features regular stage entertainment and special events, a seasonal farmer’s market, a popular ethnic food court. There's even an activity area where residents play chess and other games.\n\nThe city operates three major facilities to address the needs and interests of Bellevue residents: Mini City Hall, offering information and referral services in many languages; the Crossroads Community Center; and the Crossroads Police substation. The Bellevue Youth Theatre hosts year-round productions, including theater in-the-round and outdoor amphitheater shows. Crossroads Park features a skate bowl, a nine-hole golf course and a water spray area for children. Many community nonprofits and state agencies have offices in Crossroads.\n\nPopulation: 10,346\n\nPercentage of City: 7%\n\nUnder 18: 2,430 (23% of the area)\n\nHousing Units: 3,807\n\nThe Newport area includes four distinct communities all known for their strong sense of neighborhood identity; the Newport Hills and Lake Heights neighborhoods east of I-405, Greenwich Crest uphill to the west of I-405, Lake Lanes nestled along Lake Washington and the Newport Shores district, which is built around a series of man-made inlets.\n\nNewport Shores and Lake Lanes are neighborhoods built with homes oriented toward the waterfront, boating and lake activities. The Lake Heights and Newport Hills neighborhoods are cohesive communities with strong neighborhood traditions and activities. Greenwich Crest is a hidden gem of a neighborhood with beautiful views.\n\nOnce a secluded area of woods and wetlands, Newport provides a home or migratory corridor for an abundance of wildlife, including deer, coyotes, mountain beavers, raccoons, squirrels, redtail hawks and eagles. The 146-acre Coal Creek Natural Area provides a natural wilderness buffer for the residential community and great walking trails to explore.\n\nThe neighborhood area of Newport is served by both the Bellevue School District and Renton School District.\n\nPopulation: 10,986\n\nPercentage of City: 7%\n\nUnder 18: 2,676 (24% of the area)\n\nHousing Units: 4,053\n\nStretching from Lake Sammamish to the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Northeast Bellevue is a tapestry of neighborhoods, parks and schools. Most of the neighborhoods in the western portion of Northeast Bellevue were built in the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, reflecting a woodsy character in subdivision names such as Sherwood Forest, Lakewood Park, Bretton Wood, Tam O’ Shanter and Ardmore. Northeast Bellevue is home to three elementary schools; Ardmore Elementary, Sherwood Forest Elementary and Bennett Elementary, as well as, Interlake High School.\n\nThe southeastern portion of the area features two miles of frontage along Lake Sammamish, with large homes hugging the lakeside and other homes nestled in the heights above the lake, where they enjoy scenic views of lake and mountains beyond. Some of the subdivisions include private recreational facilities such as tennis courts, golf course and swim clubs. The northern, triangular portion of this neighborhood juts into Redmond. Many residents are employed by Microsoft and other high tech companies.\n\nThe future of Northeast Bellevue will be served by easy access to the Redmond light rail station at the Microsoft campus. It will also provide close proximity to the Overlake Village, a major new urban center on the Bellevue/Redmond border.\n\nPopulation: 9,514\n\nPercentage of City: 6%\n\nUnder 18: 2,008 (21% of the area)\n\nHousing Units: 4,406\n\nNorthwest Bellevue maintains a diversity of neighborhood charm, with distinct neighborhood communities, ranch estates, single-family ramblers, extensive remodels and larger newly-built residential homes.

Wilburton provides a strong community and a place to call home near the heart of Bellevue, but with the quiet of a residential neighborhood.\n\nThe Wilburton neighborhood area reflects Bellevue’s past and its future. With the historic Wilburton Trestle on the south, it promises to be a key landmark for the development of the north-south EasTrail walking and biking corridor. Wilburton’s business district will provide the destination for the Grand Connection linking to the pedestrian corridor across I-405, through downtown to Meydenbauer Bay. The Wilburton light rail station on Northeast Eighth Street will provide easy access around the region."
