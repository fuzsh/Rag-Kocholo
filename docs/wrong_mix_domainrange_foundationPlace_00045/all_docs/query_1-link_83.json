Our reports are simple and interactive, displaying immediate and real-time data so that you know where each student stands and what actions should be taken.\n\nIndividual Results: Track individual student progress over time and view individual assessment scores and item analysis.\n\nSummary Results: View results across the classroom and observe differences across student subgroups.\n\nImpact Measurement: Measure growth between rating windows and calculate progress for “Need for Instruction” students."
