        "text": "Established in 1979, Bellevue Schools Foundation (BSF) is the first foundation dedicated to supporting public K-12 initiatives in Washington State. Annually, the Foundation funds critical programs that fall through the financial cracks of local, state, and federal funding structures. BSF distributes funding equitably to each and every school through district and district-wide grants, as well as classroom grants, which every teacher in Bellevue School District can apply for annually.\n\nAs the District confronts a $10M gap in its budget, we encourage each and every member of the community to donate to Bellevue Schools Foundation. Contributions of any size will support the Districtâ€™s ability to retain staff and offer students access to mental health counselors, preschool tuition, computer science curriculum, arts, and so much more. The enhanced experience each student has in Bellevue School District is only possible through individual donations."
