        "text": "We inspire people to give back to their community, helping them become more invested in its success today and tomorrow.\n\nWe collaborate with local leaders to identify needs and solutions to community-wide issues, such access to food, education, and economic opportunity, then partner with donors to transform local generosity and insights into actions that improve our region for everyone.\n\nWe build endowments to create permanent, locally controlled assets that support the work of local organizations and build their capacity to improve our region.\n\nWe strengthen Jackson County nonprofits—through funding, capacity-building and more—so they can make essential resources accessible to our entire community. We host more than 40 nonprofit endowment funds that provide a sustainable source of income to support organizations’ missions forever.\n\nCommunity foundations are forever.\n\nOur endowment funds are invested permanently, and the earnings from that investment provide annual funding to address our community’s greatest needs for generations to come. Learn more.\n\nOur Impact\n\n$436,000\n\nEndowment payouts in 2023\n\n$120,000\n\nFoundation grants to 35 nonprofits in 2022\n\nCommunity Investment\n\n$2 million\n\nGifts in 2022\n\n$11.3 million\n\nTotal assets\n\n83%\n\nOf total assets endowed\n\nThanks to our affiliation with the Community Foundation of Greater Dubuque, we are entrusted with the distribution of state gaming dollars. These dollars provide grants to ensure the nonprofits helping our community thrive can sustain the good work they do and respond to emerging needs. Learn about our grants.\n\nOur work is fueled by people like you.\n\nTogether, we can realize a shared vision of a strong, thriving Jackson County for all.\n\nWhen you make an endowed gift to the Foundation or any of its funds, it will cost you far less thanks to Iowa's generous Endow Iowa 25% state tax credit.\n\nThere are many ways to invest in your community — from monetary gifts to stock, grain, land or individual retirement account contributions. Gifts of all kinds and sizes move our region forward.\n\nView our list of charitable funds or contact us for assistance.\n\nVision To Learn\n\nA nonprofit organization that helps overcome barriers to vision care for children, Vision To Learn brings a mobile clinic to schools and provides exams and glasses for free. Along with local donors, we support this mobile vision clinic aimed at improving kids’ vision to help them succeed in school and in life. Learn more.\n\nThe Jackson County Campaign for Grade Level Reading\n\nThis initiative helps ensure more children succeed in school and are prepared for college, a career and active citizenship by focusing on key predictors of school success and graduation. Leveraging many partnerships, the program addresses three critical areas: summer learning, school readiness and attendance. Learn more.\n\nEliminating Childhood Hunger\n\nEliminating hunger is an ongoing priority. Every year during our grant cycle, we prioritize giving to all food pantries, backpack programs, farmers markets, and other programs that alleviate childhood hunger. In 2021, we granted nearly $20,000 to these causes."
