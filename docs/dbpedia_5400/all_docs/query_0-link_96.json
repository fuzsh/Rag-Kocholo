Peter Sim once mused that tobacco taxes are effectively a levy on the poor because “the rich don’t have the kind of problems that smoking provides relief for. They don’t need to smoke, but poor people do.” My father smoked a packa-day from boyhood. The habit did his pulmonary health no favors, but to this day secondhand smoke smells like memories. His ruminations on tobacco policy represent my first and abiding lesson in class-consciousness. Looking back, I have to think that my worldview was shaped by the profundities that cut through those plumes. No one taught me more about alienated labor, use and exchange value, and species being more than he, not with those words but no less plainly. I will forever remember the lessons that his face imparted on the sublimities of Hitchcock, Tashlin, and Donen, on how to enjoy political rallies like stand-up comedy, how to treat every moment as parody, and the advice said and unsaid about how important it is to live happy.\n\nIntroduction: What is Critical Race Film Studies?\n\n“Is it racist?” We still often ask that question about popular culture, in which cinema continues to provide abundant kindling for racial controversy. As history evaluates whether Barack Obama’s promise of a post-racial America has been fulfilled, a mere glance at the multiplex can disavow that notion. Although films such as The Blind Side, Precious (both 2009), The Help (2011), and Django Unchained (2012) were either critical or commercial successes, the film reviews and social commentaries they engendered evince that race remains a highly contested issue. Film culture is a prominent forum for that public debate. Its audiences appear to possess keen awareness of ideology’s presence in films as well, within the stereotype but also beyond. In these four films, empathy and identification lie unmistakably with the victims and not the perpetrators of racial prejudice who are punished by narratives’ end. None of them can be accused of encouraging racial animus outright in the way that The Birth of a Nation (1915) clearly does. But the popular criticism proved sufficiently sophisticated to ponder other factors at play. They asked why black triumphs are inevitably facilitated by white saviors (Figure I.1). Is that racist? Are any ideological failings attributable to white directors? Are they racist? Are they morally or experientially authorized to tell these stories? Questions like these stand as a testament to the striking success of film theorists and critics who have taken on cinema’s relationship to race. Their ideas are discernibly active in public discourse, and the influence of their enterprise on both film scholarship and popular criticism is clear. That work within film studies can be understood within the wider political struggles for racial equality. In the aftermath of the tumultuous 1960s, film criticism began a battle of its own. However, even after the election of America’s first African American president, the political outcomes of that era remain mixed. The political importance of passing civil rights legislation is tempered by stark reminders for instance, of the failure to eradicate the minority underclass. Correspondingly significant levels of social change did not accompany the\n\n2\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nFigure I.1 Django (Jamie Foxx) and his white savior, King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Is it racist? (Django Unchained, 2012).\n\nhard-won constitutional protections. But tumultuous political events eventually turned attention toward mass media’s complicity with racial ideology. What I call “critical race film theory and criticism” gathered momentum in the early 1970s. Where sit-ins, boycotts, and marches to change racist social practices left off, the critical movement to alter public minds picked up. With this book, I propose to interrogate that film criticism that concerns itself with race. I examine the ground that the project has covered and the direction it has taken. I launch my proposition from the field’s political context because in the end, political efficacy is essentially the final measure by which these endeavors will be judged. One assumes that this is how those projects would wish to be considered. Basically, critical race film studies analyze how cinema communicates racist values to individual spectators and society at large. Its exponents theorize textual operations to analyze cinematic racism. To wit, they apply critical theory to explain how the medium carries racist ideology. How have the fortunes of critical race film theory fared as a result of being tethered to those ideas? How politically effective then, are those ideas? The term, “critical race film studies” borrows its nomenclature from critical race theory. First developed in legal scholarship, critical race theory is a multidisciplinary corpus of theoretically oriented research that, according to its eminent exponents Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic, is “interested in studying and transforming the relationship among race, racism, and power.”1 It views racism as an ideological function, socially constructed, normalized, and thus unnoticed. It also believes that racism is materially determined, which is to say, race is mobilized to advance economic interests. Finally, critical race\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ntheorists invest in the notion that persons of color experience oppression uniquely, and thus possess an innate competence to speak about race and racism.2 According to these tenets, “critical race” is thus an apt moniker for film scholars concerned with race-centered analysis, due to their shared interests in examining ideology, discourse, and identity. Over approximately four decades of Anglo-American scholarship investigating how concepts and questions centered on race and ethnicity are represented and articulated in the cinema, these themes from critical race theory have endured in its sister discipline from film studies. A further note on nomenclature: I use the terms “film criticism” and “film theory” interchangeably for the following reasons. While I would, in general circumstances, accept Dudley Andrew’s definitions of film criticism (as ideas that pertain to single films or a group of films) and theory (as that which speaks of cinema as a whole),3 insofar as issues of race occur in films beyond those that deal explicitly and thematically with them, we might therefore be dealing in fact with all films. This is because on any given issue, while the immediate object at hand may be a solitary film, the specter of race exists far beyond its borders. From a certain point of view, to speak of race is to possibly speak of most if not all films. Treating theory and criticism as one is also historically practical because time and canonization often transform and even “elevate” criticism into theory; take for example, the writing of Sergei Eisenstein whose work championing montage in film culture is now the core of formalist film theory. As we shall discover, critical race film studies is marked in large part by a few objectives and theoretical precepts summarized by the following: stereotype studies, discourse analysis, and fragmented subjectivity. This hews closely to what Delgado and Stefancic call the “idealist” camp of critical race theory, to which “racism and discrimination are matters of thinking, mental categorizations, attitude, and discourse.” By contrast, the “realist” school of critical race theory approach racism as economic determinists who privilege material and class concerns.4 Critical race theorists including Delgado have observed that the idealist mode of discourse analysis came to dominate critical race theory. Education theorist Mike Cole contends that critical race theory, arising out of critical legal theory, broke away because the latter was too classbased and underestimated race as the primary axis of social oppression.5 Indeed, the following chapters show that critical race film studies have followed suit and not attended sufficiently to class issues, essentially assuming the idealist\n\n4\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nposition at the expense of the materialist one. In revealing these leanings, this book seeks to correct that bias. The urge to remind the field about critical race theory’s materialist wing is but one reason to do so. This is because I believe that the return to economic concerns is actually induced by contradictions within film studies’ own existing methodology on race. In particular, I find that critical race film theory’s antihumanist assumptions do not comport with its reliance on unified bourgeois subjectivity that is more familiar to Neo-Marxism. The faintest hint that a methodology is culling material concerns automatically signals combatants from broader and older conflicts to enter the fray. Terms such as social constructivism, discourse analysis, and fragmentation possess a distinctively poststructuralist and postmodern flavor. As such, it is easy to overlay this terrain with intellectual cartographies that do not just delineate between idealists and realists, but poststructuralists and Marxists, postmodernists and humanists, or Marxists and Post-Marxists. The general move away from class concerns in film theory and criticism is overdetermined by many developments. One could point to philosopher Jean-François Lyotard’s dismay and turn of faith at Marxism’s political failure during the Paris événements of 1968, as a seminal event that precipitated larger intellectual changes. Others would recognize it as a triumph of capitalism, and point out that poststructuralism’s rejection of Marxism occurs just as capitalism permeates our subjective experience and embarks on global expansion and standardization.6 That is to say, capitalist politics reify in critical theory. So-called Post-Marxists would counter that orthodox Marxism was too reductive and rigid to fully explain all of capitalism’s subtleties and shifts.7 These battle lines offer context and guidance in understanding the issue but it is important not to oversimplify. Venn overlaps exist in all these relationships. By no stretch of the imagination are all poststructuralists averse to materialist thinking, nor can one assume that a Marxist will reject postmodernism. With regard to this book’s theoretical focus and deference to the unified Neo-Marxian subject, there are also many materialists who reject humanism as such. These are thinkers likely to see Marxism as one of the most important antihumanist philosophies. Finally, of course, critiques do not extend to the personal. Just as I disagree elsewhere with those who do presume that the apolitical nature of cognitivist film studies renders its practitioners ideologically suspect, I would not accuse anyone of personally lacking class consciousness even if I criticize some critical models in use.8 In short, from a large enough distance, this book can sound like familiar carping, and appear to be another instance of a materialist barking\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nabout how people are not talking enough about economics and class. But neither a reactionary deference toward class nor economic reductionism is what I advocate here. The goal is to clear the theoretical brush. As odd as this might sound, the desire is to simultaneously complicate, clarify, and refine. Yet I cannot assert that my initial survey of the situation was absolutely impartial, nor can I deny being gladdened in figuring out that critical race studies was pointing in a certain direction I predicted. A Neo-Marxian theoretical foundation provides a critical backbone and default sensitivity toward class issues, and fueled my initial skepticism. That generally inclines me to give the final word on most matters to the lineage of cultural criticism defined by the Frankfurt School, the intellectual movement that sprung from the University of Frankfurt’s Institute for Social Research. Neo-Marxism began as an interdisciplinary movement of the twentieth century responding to traditional Marxism’s limitations in accounting for sociological developments and cultural phenomena. Its import for film and media studies arises from the conviction that mass culture serves to impose capitalism’s ideological will on free individuals. How it hindered critical subjectivity was of great concern to two of the Frankfurt School’s most important critics, Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno. Their legacy is best represented today by Fredric Jameson who, along with David Harvey, provide some comprehensive accounts of how postmodern capitalism cloaks itself in abstractions and incomprehensibility. They thus offer a persuasive explanation for why the critical subject’s dialectical and negational capacities are so crucial. Jameson also writes in The Geopolitical Aesthetic: “Otherness” . . . is a peculiarly booby-trapped and self-defeating concept; and the slogan of “difference,” while politically impeccable in all the obvious senses, is formalistic and empty of concrete social and historical specification—where it does not, indeed, relax and lend itself to the usual late capitalist celebration of multi-cultural pluralism. (It has, in short, all the ambiguity of an essentially liberal, rather than radical, value.)9\n\nThe passage expresses the other half of my position well—the issue is one of politics as well as its relation to theory. In the 40 years since film scholars began to address race, the field has built itself a few dominant platforms. I measure their short-term goal of general ideological and cultural criticism, as well as their objective in the long run, to deliver social justice via the intermediate desire for cultural democracy in the mass media. When scholars illuminate films to reveal\n\n6\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nthe presence and workings of racial ideology, they assume that these critiques will find their way into the public consciousness, where increased awareness will force racist ideas to unravel on a larger scale, and ultimately change the way society thinks and acts. In that case, how well is critical race film studies fighting racism? Is it a problem that poststructuralist preferences for theoretical inquiries into discourse and difference define film studies’ view of racial Otherness narrowly on a linguistic level or as a discursive matter? Does it distract from empirical material inequalities? This book’s Neo-Marxian “materialist” model of cultural criticism incorporates Marxist dialecticism into theorizations of culture. Like NeoMarxism, I assume that culture shares a complex but more or less direct relationship with the economic system producing it. In this base-superstructure model of society, Marxists refer to the economic mode of production as the “base” or alternatively, the “substructure,” and social constructions such as laws, religion, politics, and culture as the “superstructure.” The thing is, NeoMarxism is not normally an approach associated with critical race film studies, which has become more affiliated with the idealist camp of critical race theory. This book suggests that this elision of materialism strengthens existing power structures and limits critical race film studies’ potential to produce historical and political change. Since racial conflicts are often waged over redistribution and access to resources, Neo-Marxism provides an intellectual orientation that is both fresh and well equipped to evaluate film studies’ engagement with race. That sense of things is only strengthened when we discover fundamental theoretical contradictions arising when race- and identity-related concerns are privileged over paradigms based on class. For an indicative example to reinforce that assessment and the forthcoming analysis, take Daniel Bernardi’s recent collection of interviews with filmmakers who are grappling with identity issues, Filming Difference: Actors, Directors, Writers and Producers on Gender, Race and Sexuality in Film. Its title foregrounds the popular poststructuralist trope of “difference” and excludes class-consciousness from that overview even though economics and class are frequent topics of conversations within the book.10 My book resolves incongruities like this with critical theory, and frequently finds clues that taken together, invite us to apply the Frankfurt School when we examine film and race. It might well result in a rearrangement of the familiar quadrivirate of race, gender, sexuality, and class into a new orientation where class occupies a more privileged position. If that installs Marxism and especially Marxist humanism more prominently in critical race\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nfilm studies, it would certainly not unsettle my sensibilities, but it is important to emphasize that those conclusions were not externally imposed but beckoned by what I found. A poststructuralist regime in critical race film studies was uncovered, that counts race, gender, sexuality, and class as the constituent categories of identity. Each is seen as an axis on which social divisions have been created in the service of ideology. The differences that people come to see between haves and have-nots, white and nonwhite, male and female, or east and west, thus become sources of meaning. When these thought structures are naturalized into classism, racism, sexism, and heteronormativity, they form the premise for common sense, which then translates into everyday praxes that enable the oppression, dispossession, and pacification of minority and subordinate groups. The power of ideology is such that those axes of meaning, the binary categories themselves, are seldom questioned. Poststructuralism justifiably challenged ideology by pointing out how identities are social constructions based on difference and have no ontological status. More than that, individual subjectivity itself is deemed to have never existed. Deconstructionists took it even further; Jacques Derrida’s notion of différance for example, emphasizes the fluidity and excess of unstable meanings. Are the social categories of race, gender, sexuality, and class equivalent? I believe that class is distinctive for several reasons. Racial, gender, and sexuality differences become most consequential when they affect economic standing. Social justice only becomes an issue when they determine a person’s economic class. Essentially, it is a question of economic inequality. Class identity is intractable and ontologically stable, while race, gender, and sexuality are not. A person’s class identity is stable enough to resist any sort of performative subversion, a form of rebellion highlighted here because of the prominence given to it by those who examine identity and cinema. It is common to find arguments in favor of appropriation via dress, speech, behavior, and so on because it highlights the arbitrariness of normalized cultural inscriptions and underscores identity’s contingency. It explains the high regard for Billy Wilder’s comedy, Some Like It Hot (1959), a film whose cross-dressing stars Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon’s gender-bending antics turn heteronormativity on its head. But that strategy of subversion does not translate to class. Much of the comedy in Trading Places (1983) where a rich white businessman (Dan Ackroyd) switches places with a black beggar (Eddie Murphy) is on balance based more on race than on class. In real life, neither the rich nor the poor can pretend to be the other\n\n8\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nwith the same alacrity. Of course, race, gender, sexuality, and class identities all structure our social experiences in significant ways. They collide on occasions when social conflict compels groups to choose sides. For example, during the O. J. Simpson murder trial, media attention turned to how African American women on the jury would react to revelations of Simpson’s spousal abuse. The controversy played itself out publicly on talk shows, and when Simpson was acquitted, race evidently trumped gender. Notably though, the advantage that Simpson enjoyed as a rich defendant did arise, but class was ultimately undersold since the collective memory of that saga consists mostly of the racial and gender divisions. Racism and misogyny should not be minimized, but identity politics that critical race theory fosters and as this book will show, recur in critical race film studies, cause collateral damage both inside and outside the academy. A recent skirmish that pit racial with gender interests occurred when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton competed for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. Each candidate was out to achieve a milestone. He would be America’s first black president and she would be her first female president. Clinton began her campaign with more African American backing. But when Obama’s Midwestern victory in the Iowa caucuses legitimated his chances for victory, his support among initially cautious black voters increased and fault lines were drawn. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem published a column in The New York Times where she made a case for Clinton based on identity politics.11 “Gender is probably the most restricting force in American life,” she wrote, arguing also that while racist ideology has been rejected, sexist ideology remains normalized. A later paragraph’s contention that she was “not advocating a competition for who has it toughest” thus rang rather hollow. Grounded as it was in feminist identity politics, Steinem’s case for Clinton’s candidacy only worsened factional tensions, which eventually flared up during the primary campaign. Clinton supporters accused the other side of sexism with racially loaded language; and for their part, Obama supporters were at the ready with charges of racism. It highlights how unproductive and destructive identity paradigms can be. Steinem’s reliance and simultaneous disavowal of identity politics parallels the recurrent problem in critical race film studies examined in these chapters. She fully grasps the harm they can inflict but engages in them anyway. The primary election activated emotional faults that splintered social groups that probably shared much in common. In the case of the Simpson trial, they facilitated an injustice (assuming as I do that the defendant was guilty). And since both events made\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nfor gratuitous and highly profitable media spectacles, should we then ask who the ultimate victors and beneficiaries of these cultural battles are? Knowing my instincts, some will predict my answer, that profits are reaped by an economically determined power structure presiding over Late-stage or global capitalism. But throughout this book, any path to conclusions like that is accompanied by its share of surprises. The journey navigates its way through a theoretical discussion about the Western Enlightenment’s unified subject—the humanist idea that each individual possesses a stable core identity and the capacity for rational thought. This individual is indispensible if we are to attempt to understand how Late Capitalism works and how it affects our culture. Poststructuralist and postmodernist approaches behind critical race film studies challenge that subject. One of the tacts they take is to argue that unity is illusory because subjectivities are fragmented. Another approach destabilizes the subject through the notion that determinants of individual identity such as race, gender, and class, are ideological constructions. In other words, identities take form in discourse and exist only because people adopt discursive formations. While that might be true, all of these social formations are also materially and economically determined. If that is so, I find it worthwhile for political purposes to ascertain the values of each identity’s valence. To wit, which category, among race, gender, and class, is most important? Such clarity is more crucial than ever, for even with an ostensibly class-based insurgency like the Occupy movement’s anti-Wall Street protests in 2011, the argument that economics are paramount does not necessarily prevail. The Associated Press marked the demonstrations’ first anniversary with an elegiac report that linked its diminution to social splintering. “Protesters accused each other of being patriarchal and racist and domineering.”12 Activists would defend its gains but Thomas Frank’s diagnosis of Occupy’s demise supports the AP’s contention. He blames the movement’s political and practical inaction on academic pseudointellectuals who began to populate the movement’s ranks, and even singles out poststructuralists for particular lament.13 Lest one’s reservations are aroused about the opinions of cynics such as Frank and the AP, the more sympathetic assessment of those fissures by Todd Gitlin is perhaps most damning. It confirms the inviolability of class-based analysis. Class difference, he documented, was a central but unacknowledged organizational impediment to the would-be economic revolution.14 Disputes such as this between race and class define both contemporary politics and film studies, where the same tensions come to guide film\n\n10\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\ninterpretation. Consider one example, African American Studies scholar Henry Louis Gates’s review of Warren Beatty’s political satire, Bulworth (1998).15 According to critics’ general consensus, the film’s socialist message rails against corporate money flooding political campaigns, a trend that disenfranchises the working-class and coincides with deregulation favoring corporate interests. Beatty’s narrative unfolds in a multi-genre plot abhorring American political spectacles within a fish-out-of-water interracial romantic comedy. The protagonist senator Jay Bulworth (Beatty) is a politician borne of 1960s’ idealism who becomes so disillusioned with his own political compromises over his career that he plans to commit suicide by taking an assassination hit out on himself. Liberated from mortal and political obligations, he sparks a furor by spouting politically incorrect socialism, and finds both enlightenment and redemption in hip-hop culture, and a romance with a young African American activist, Nina (Halle Berry). The racial interplay between Beatty and his black love interest, or between WASP and black culture, provides the basis of humor and spectacle. Twentieth Century Fox advertised the film in that vein with a trailer that features prominent clips from two scenes. In the first, Bulworth exhorts to worshipers in a black church, “If you don’t put down that malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife, you’re never going to get rid of somebody like me.”16 In the second, he declares at a Hollywood fundraiser that “my guys are not stupid, they always put the big Jews on my schedule.” These two punch lines anchor the trailer, apparently the most accessible and prototypically “outrageous” gimmicks available. But more important, the preview positions race politically as a conduit toward an examination of the economic substructure. Most reviews, it seems, acknowledged that implicit message. Richard Kelly summarizes in his review for Sight and Sound, “only John Sayles has served up such brazen dialectical materialism in recent American cinema.”17 One can speculate as to why the studio chose to highlight remarks that are racially offensive instead of those that are capitalist-offensive. Class conscious dialogue does exist in the script. For example, Bulworth raps the following verse: “Yeah, yeah / You can call it single-payer or Canadian way / Only socialized medicine will ever save the day! Come on now, lemme hear that dirty word—SOCIALISM!” Halfway through the film, when the romantic couple are finally alone, they consummate with a political exchange where Nina delivers a crucial monologue (Figure I.2). Asked\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nFigure I.2 Nina (Halle Berry) provides Senator Bulworth (Warren Beatty) with a Marxist analysis of black poverty in Bulworth (1998).\n\nby Bulworth about the dearth of modern black leaders, she charms him with this monologue: I think that it has more to do with the decimating of the manufacturing base in the urban centers. Some people would say the problem is purely cultural, by the power of the media that is continually controlled by fewer and fewer people, add to that the monopoly of the media, a consumer culture that’s based on self-gratification. You’re not likely to have a population that wants leadership that calls for self-sacrifice. Senator, an optimistic energized population throws up optimistic, energized leaders and when you shift manufacturing to the Sun Belt and the southwest, you destroy the blue-collar core of the black activist population. But the fact is that I’m just a materialist at heart. If I look at the economic base, high domestic employment means jobs for African Americans.\n\nMarx, it would seem, casts a long shadow on this film. However, Gates reads things very differently. Rather than emphasize what he noticed as the film’s “bona-fide political content,” his review is much more preoccupied with Beatty’s awkward racial pretensions as a white liberal, and for the most part, stays mired within that displeasure. Appropriating Norman Mailer’s famous essay about white hipsters who adopted swing and jazz culture, Gates is bemused and discomfited by Beatty’s performance of black culture, titling his film review “The White Negro” and following with a succinct\n\n12\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nFigure I.3 Henry Louis Gates was preoccupied with how “Warren Beatty Can’t Rap” in Bulworth (1998).\n\nopening sentence: “Warren Beatty can’t rap.” “The result is more Dr. Seuss than Dr. Dre,” where the actor comes off “like a really pissed off Edgar Guest.” Bulworth’s explicit socialism or even its overt articulations of Marxist ideas did not escape Gates’s mind, but why did he seem so reluctant to move past the racial dimension? Why was he so hostile toward the filmmaker’s ironic masquerade of the black experience? (Figure I.3) The critique seems to have little to do with the politically loaded history of minstrelsy where the question is about who gets to enjoy the privilege of mimicking the other, merely that Beatty did not pull it off as “a white man . . . from a white part of the world.”18 If race is a discursive and performative construction, and identities are fluid, does it then make sense to base a critique on the intractable essentialism of Beatty’s whiteness? That aversion surfaced more recently with critics who feel that Tarantino has no right to say anything about black history and worse, that he uses black actors in Django Unchained as political cover for his exploitation of the N-word and facile excursions into black culture.19 These charges against Beatty and Tarantino comport ironically with a precept of critical race theory, that there is something exclusively unique about black subjectivity, shaped as it were, within and by the social experience of being black. It is one of the theoretical contradictions taken up by this book. Gates, who was not in the least affronted by Django Unchained, became embroiled in a much more publicized and recent racial controversy. On July 16,\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\n2009, the Harvard professor was arrested outside his Cambridge home after an altercation with a cop. Gates had returned home earlier to find his front door jammed. After entering through a back entrance, he then attempted to forcibly open the front door. When a neighbor reported witnessing a possible burglary, Sergeant James Crowley responded first to the 9–1–1 call. As he tried to verify the professor’s identity, more officers arrived on the scene, an altercation broke out, and eventually, Gates was handcuffed before cameras and arrested on his front porch. Over the next few days, the incident gained national attention, culminating when now President Barack Obama responded at a press conference to a reporter’s question about his thoughts by saying that the police “acted stupidly.”20 Reporting on the arrest that had focused almost exclusively on race, was flung into a more intense frenzy when Obama made his comment. Some stories highlighted concerns among Harvard’s faculty that the arrest resulted from racial profiling. Media descriptions of Gates as “one of the nation’s pre-eminent African-American scholars” drove the controversy further. Reports commonly cited a quote from one of his colleagues, “my colleagues and I have asked the question of whether this kind of egregious act would have happened had Professor Gates been a white professor.”21 Academic Stanley Fish’s commentary in The New York Times reinforced the view that Crowley’s actions were racially motivated, by comparing the incident to Gates’s encounter with racial prejudice when both professors lived in North Carolina.22 The truth of what transpired that day is less relevant here than the dominant narrative the news media pushed. They politicized a racial conflict between a white cop and black suspect. Few brought up the class dynamics simultaneously at play. The police report states that Gates warned Crowley that the officer had no idea who he was messing with, and that the professor loudly attempted to summon the police chief over the phone in Crowley’s presence.23 With that alternative narrative available, why was the event not presented as a clash between an Ivy League professor and a public servant in a socio-economically divided city? Race is indeed often an inescapable part of our consciousness with real personal and social consequences, but when is it more appropriate to consider class in reading films and making sense of culture? These brief examples from mass media foreground issues regarding the critical discourse on cinema and race highlighted throughout this book. Because of that relationship, a better understanding of critical race film studies can illuminate our social world as a whole. Furthermore, if the word emanating from the Occupy camps is accurate, that poststructuralism was in some form or\n\n14\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nother responsible for the movement’s atrophy, it becomes especially urgent for us to understand these ideas that are playing an outsized role in radical politics. Nevertheless, this is “just” a book on film theory. It will not make someone suddenly care about class issues, nor will it change the mind of anyone not already predisposed or at least open to the idea of a materialist approach to understanding race. The sociological work published by those such as Max Weber, William Julius Wilson, and more recently Walter Benn Michaels’s The Trouble with Diversity, would be far more convincing on that score.24 But if this book enhances understanding of film, media, and theory, it should hopefully add to the critical discourse on race, which would not be insignificant since so much of that discussion nowadays takes place about the media and in the media. This book proceeds in two-stages. The first examines the main ideas underwriting critical race film theory, and reveals key contradictions. The second is more reconstructive. The initial four chapters locate specific knots in critical race film scholarship’s theoretical and political musculature. These theoretical paradoxes initially uncovered actually provide a motive force later on. Chapter 1 historicizes the major developments in critical race film studies, highlighting the origins of seminal principles and undertaking close readings of important contributions to the field by Steve Neale, Robert Stam and Louise Spence, Manthia Diawara, and Homi Bhabha. I historicize two key approaches that the field has long been identified with: a first generation of work I associate with image studies and a second generation of theory that introduced discursive analyses. As often as critical race film scholarship avows its intentions to move beyond these early methods, little progression or movement occur in practice, as my survey of the last 30 years indicates. Along the way, I pause to deliberate from a historical materialist perspective, particularly on the positions that these poststructuralist theories take on the unified subject. With these asides, momentum picks up toward eventually forming a Neo-Marxian methodology. As it were, the book’s historical materialism is not an alien interjection, but an attempt to reveal Marxian ideas, including important ones governing subjectivity, that are previously either latent or elided. Following that direction leads partly to increased sensitivity to economic issues, whose mandate includes placing greater importance on class-centered analyses of form and narrative, as well as production histories that explain the film industry’s power to define images of the working-class. The field of workingclass studies could be involved in this part of the project because of its mission\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nto foster class consciousness. But its import to my study is limited because the heavy value that it assigns to “positively” representing the lived experiences of the working-class and on expressing their point of view, recapitulates the reasons relayed in Chapter 1 why critical race studies’ most popular models feel well worn. Without a doubt, heightening awareness of economic inequity and of the plight of society’s have-nots is important. But if we account for critical race film studies’ continued overreliance on first-generation stereotype analysis, then the impetus for materialism is not simply restricted to studying the origins and persistence of damaging representations of class. This book’s Neo-Marxian undertaking interrogates the politics of critical theory in addition to those of film and textual production. The first chapter concludes by discussing how critical race film studies have splintered according to ethnicity, into independent projects with parallel trajectories. This is how critical race film studies practices identity politics, based on what I argue is an attempt to suppress contradictory theories about the individual subject. It has led to a degree of redundancy and hampers collective pan-ethnic strategies against Eurocentrism or white supremacy. The field has sometimes adopted multiculturalism as way to sidestep identity politics, but I show via political theories of “recognition” that the strategy might be lacking. Chapter 2 surveys the critical race film criticism surrounding John Ford’s Western classic, The Searchers (1956). It is an important work as a member of the canon, as a movie whose narrative and form are driven by racial discourse, and whose director and star’s reputation for reactionary politics persist to this day. Not surprisingly, it has generated much scholarship regarding its supposedly racist themes. But since its racial politics and overall ideological position are actually unclear, the film becomes a tabula rasa for interpretation and theorization. Although its ambivalence also threatens the film with incoherence, what prevents that from breaking out, I argue, is the reliance on the unified subjectivities of the film’s author Ford and its main character, Ethan Edwards (John Wayne). This chapter acts as a key transition, using The Searchers as a locus where intellectual shifts in critical race film theory can be clearly observed, while I concomitantly excavate the “subject” that becomes the central topic of the next chapter, before being further coaxed out over the rest of the book. Chapter 3 presents a theoretical discussion of critical race film studies’ view on the viability of the rational bourgeois subject. Counter-intuitively, poststructuralist writing on race and cinema continues to rely on a notion of critical consciousness that greatly resembles the Neo-Marxian subject—one\n\n16\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nwhom Frankfurt School critic Theodor Adorno would describe as capable of autonomy, negation, and dialectical thinking. Critical race film theory first prompts us to look in Adorno’s direction, and Edward Said later affirms those instincts. From another point of view, we may begin to see how critical race film theory reinforces the very premise of Neo-Marxist criticism. This chapter defines Adorno’s unified subject and argues that its persistence in the face of the poststructuralist challenge signals its strength. Ultimately, this augurs the return of Marxian class concerns. Chapter 4 then reflects on the influence that Said’s Orientalism has maintained on critical race film studies.25 Although that book serves as an important theoretical reference, the field’s poststructuralist orientation has too frequently withdrawn the materialism and humanism of which Said had been most outspoken, in favor of the social constructivist elements of his analysis. In light of recent work outside the field that has lent credence and specificity to Said’s relationship to the Frankfurt School, this chapter identifies where the misreading has been most consequential while examining how the study of race has been configured as a result. It renders the outlines of a Saidian methodology for race, but highlights an aporia ironically created by Said’s adherence to NeoMarxian critical consciousness. By traversing Said, the book moves into an examination of postcolonial theories that film studies often uses to study race. Postcolonial criticism is much concerned with how the colonial subaltern is ideologically Othered and racialized. Its thinkers like Said, Homi Bhabha, and Gayatri Spivak are thus also prominent in critical race film studies. And since Bhabha and Spivak willingly display their debts to poststructuralism as well as postmodernism, they also provide a conceptual transition from poststructuralist to postcolonial and onto postmodern theory. Bhabha’s favored trope, hybridity, is central to the final chapter’s focus on multiracial discourse in contemporary Hollywood cinema. But materialists like Arif Dirlik point out that postcolonial criticism frequently tends to sublate the material conditions of postcolonial reality: What is remarkable, therefore, is . . . that a consideration of the relationship between “postcolonialism” and Global Capitalism should be absent from the writings of postcolonial intellectuals; all the more remarkable because this relationship is arguably less abstract and more direct than any relationship between Global Capitalism and postmodernism, as it pertains not just to cultural/epistemological but to social and political formations.26\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nDirlik’s view on postcolonial research echoes Jameson’s cutting critique of postmodern ahistoricism cited before. Critical race film studies, I argue, has settled into a position where it becomes an open and inviting target for such critiques. Perhaps the book appears to have adopted a “scorched earth” policy with the past and current work on film and race, but it does not reject the need for critical race analysis at all. The intent is to shore up weaknesses so that the field may proceed forward, and not to dismantle it. Critical race film criticism is still an important undertaking as the aspiration for cultural democracy and social justice remains principled and essential. The ambition and responsibility of the final chapters are to fashion modified strategies for criticism and theory, erected over Neo-Marxist foundations. To that end, I turn a critical eye on postmodernity to chart the first phases of that future, shifting into a reconstructive phase for race-related film studies via the critical subject. The case studies in Chapter 5 of “postmodern” films and cinematic phenomena lead the way toward a conception of how critical race film criticism can more effectively operate. In particular, they examine the postcolonial and postmodern notion of hybridity. Bhabha’s writing on the subject triangulates poststructuralist and postcolonial principles, condensing a mixture of ambivalence, contradiction and split subjectivity into the utopian trope of the hybrid—someone who is neither one nor the Other, and who can therefore test the limits of national or racial essentialism that is central to colonial ideology. This chapter counters Bhabha’s idealism by analyzing an example of postmodern and postcolonial hybridity in contemporary Hollywood cinema, Keanu Reeves, whose hybridity courses unmistakably through his films and star persona. The actor’s appeal is driven significantly by both the known fact and the symptomatic perception of his multiracial heritage and ambiguous sexuality—postmodern ambiguities circulating within and around the films. Here, the historical intersection of Late Capitalist consumerism, “Generation X” culture, digital technology, and a racial landscape created by the repeal of antimiscegenation laws provide historical context. The culture industry presents Reeves’s hybrid identity as an appeal to contemporary Generation X audiences’ desire for a figure of reformed masculinity that resonates with their multicultural reality. In this way, hybridity functions outwardly as a progressive ideal. Bolstered by his penchant for roles as cyborgs, and reinforced by notions of his “stupidity” and robotic manner, critics such as Joshua Clover and R. L. Rutsky suggest that his racial ambiguity\n\n18\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nchallenges Western notions of identity and the thinking subject. Following those who ask if films or film directors are racist, they ask if the traditional subject itself is a racist idea that is subverted by Reeves’s discourse. In turn, others believe that Reeves’s liminality opens the text to alternative readings by marginalized audiences. But once again, following the pattern uncovered in previous chapters, that hybridity discourse distracts from a compelling heuristic with regards to Reeves’s films and star persona. I find that the texts actually invoke critical subjectivity on the part of both Reeves and his characters, in a way that is at odds with the split postmodern figure more commonly trumpeted. His films and star discourse seem to favor Neo-Marxist over postmodern ideals. By itself, this may present little more than an alternative reading. But nestled in a chorus of chapters, the consonance they produce renders the point more convincing. What though, explains the tendency to overestimate the transgressive value of hybrid postmodern raciality like Reeves’s? After all, hybridity is not the determinant in these texts’ narrative economy; rather, it is part of an intricate postmodern veneer designed and subtended by the logic and institutional force of a corporate global totality. The chapter concludes that theories of hybridity are complicit with capital, and further ratify modern consumerism. Critical race film studies have found no embodiment of postmodern multiraciality more perfect than the cyborg. As both figure and metaphor, the cybernetic organism is also a significant part of Reeves’s persona. Finally, I examine cyborg criticism’s relationship with race theory and take a sustained look at the cyborg’s racial metaphors in cinema. I look closest at those who posit that the cyborg’s hybridity provides important ways to rethink assumptions about unified subjectivity. If there is a relative paucity of race-related analysis in this area, it is due to the privilege that feminism enjoys in writings on cyborg politics, and to the preponderance of cyborgs’ presence in other textual forms such as literature, television, and the graphic novel. Applying earlier observations of Reeves’s hybridity, I propose a sketch of what cyborg racial politics might look like, continuing the analysis of postmodern politics. I examine the workings of multiculturalism and its overlap with politics of a more critical or theoretical sort, where Donna Haraway’s seminal essay “A Cyborg Manifesto” is inescapably central. All subsequent scholarship on cyborgs has needed to account for her Manifesto, and the present contribution is no different. It is an inescapable problem for Haraway that the traditional subject sprang from Western humanism. My alternative reading of the Cyborg Manifesto however, rejects that the subject is ipso facto a racist idea.\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nBefore it raises suggestions for critical race film theory and criticism, the book also contributes to some other ongoing debates in film studies. Since the analysis of Keanu Reeves is essentially a star analysis, the opportunity presents itself to reflect upon the field of star studies. Research on audience consumption and interaction with stars often deal directly with issues of identification. My study of Reeves follows the recent publication of the first extensive analysis of his star discourse by Michael DeAngelis, who wrote in particular relation to sexuality studies. I am thus naturally drawn to star discourses that involve a multiethnic component such as Miriam Hansen’s study of Rudolph Valentino. Both trade on the basic idea that split, contingent, or ambivalent (to use Bhabha’s favored term) public personas allow fans and audiences to maintain multiple planes of identification and thus enact some form of interpretive subversion. These star studies, as with the hybridity theories described earlier, can privilege and idealize the postmodern subject (and consumer) instead of problematizing the ideological function of cinema’s capitalist institutions. Emboldened by prior conclusions, I wonder if these reception studies are practicing postmodern extremism. I hope to persuade theory and criticism to incorporate a clearer consciousness of capital toward a more materialist theoretical framework for critical race film studies. As a philosophical matter, Neo-Marxism believes unyieldingly that master narratives give great explanatory power to history. Metanarratives are anathema to postmodern cynicism and fragmentation. Nevertheless, an expansive theory about race and class that is universally applied and predeterminative would not be mobile or flexible enough to negotiate say, Josef Schumpeter’s view of a highly adaptable capitalism, or Etienne Balibar and Immanuel Wallerstein’s that it shapes itself to local situations. This book does not necessarily aspire to a grand theory unable to acknowledge specific histories. Critical race film studies, in trying to counter rhetorics of biological or essential determinism, has invested heavily in the notion that identities such as gender and race—especially those that have justified oppression in the past—are social and cultural fabrications lacking essential or scientific grounding, patently false, and invalid by default. But though the political meaning of race remains discursive, the political reaction must still be material. My recommendations for critical race film studies will encourage that approach, just as my theoretical conclusions will always permit it. This means placing greater emphasis on materialist considerations of class and economics. It also entails wariness of factionalism driven by identity politics, being more metacritical of stereotype studies, and treating political economy as\n\n20\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\na causal referent in textual analyses of films. The address of race issues must be materialist; any desire for social and racial change must confront a political– economic cause.\n\nNotes 1 Richard Delgado and Jean Stefanic, Critical Race Theory: An Introduction 2nd edn (New York: New York University Press, 2012): 3. 2 Ibid., 7–10. 3 J.

We have also witnessed cinema progressing from a technological artifact to a cheap spectacular entertainment for the masses, to a capitalist marvel, to an important ideological and marketing commodity for a global economy. Film scholarship and popular criticism have experienced growth and development as well. Once the domain of cineastes, film criticism and theory’s evolution accelerated when it was introduced during the 1960s into the Anglo-American academy, where all research arguably submits to intellectual trends. During key phases of critical race film studies, what we roughly recognize as poststructuralist theory concurrently exuded a powerful presence. As it were, because much of Anglo-American film studies history overlaps temporally with the rise of critical race film studies, prominent themes in one field are predictably reiterated in the other. The key transition from stereotype analysis to discourse analysis reflects theoretical fashions in vogue at the time. Critical race film studies conducts its business according to changes in the definition and function of race in the social world. In Robyn Wiegman’s entry on “Race, Ethnicity, and Film” in The Oxford Guide to Film Studies, she writes that “the study of race and ethnicity in film has taken shape according to the formation of race and ethnicity in US culture more widely.”1 To be sure, the dominant definition of race in social discourse has shifted. It was once thought to be biologically determined in the way that skin color is. Subsequently over the course of the twentieth century, people gradually accepted that race is constructed in social practice and cultural discourse, which is where the content\n\n24\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nof one’s character bares itself. It became less about who someone genetically is, and more about what someone culturally does. Film studies moved as if part of the same constellation. When it became less popular to see race as an inescapable hereditary determinant of character, critical race film scholarship developed a poststructuralist suspicion of essentialism, of cinematic images, and of how they create meaning. Although race began its redefinition decades before the appearance of poststructuralism, similar if not identical political and intellectual tides exerted a force on both race and film. The predictable Marxist thing to say about this evolving landscape is that all politics and theory are intractably governed by economic structural changes, but such materialism is overly convenient and reductive. Nevertheless, how useful is Marxism for explaining these changes? What would Marxians consider to be the consequences of dealing with a film text as an open circuit of fluid discourses? What comes of reforming race into a construct of social discourse? These initial chapters float the possibility that capitalist ideology imposes a measure of its logic and values on this vast network of social and cultural phenomena. More to the point, what is its influence on criticism? The present chapter finds that critical race film studies have marginalized class-based approaches to its analysis, and lays out a prima facie case for Neo-Marxism’s primacy within critical race film studies. It does so by finding a familiar, preceptual critical subject within. Critical race film studies developed in two distinct stages, separated by crucial theoretical essays articulating seminal and frequently cited ideas that sparked turning points. The “images school” that studies stereotypes represents the first phase.2 Its projects assume correctly that cinema is a powerful circulator of racial discourse, relying on classical realism to reinforce racist ideology. Before too long however, Steve Neale’s 1979 essay in Screen Education, “The Same Old Story: Stereotypes and Difference” indicated that the method had run its course, and urged writers to change direction.3 Although brief and lacking specific citations of the literature, Neale’s thesis introduced key ideas to the field that remain trenchant. The new approaches that Neale advocated were more fully realized by Robert Stam and Louis Spence in Screen. Their essay “Colonialism, Racism and Representation” in fact recapitulates Neale’s critique from four years prior.4 Instead of a preoccupation with the sign, they paid greater attention to “textuality and intertextuality”—the processes by which film constructs point-of-view using the interaction of images through editing or that between a film and other cultural texts. Stam and Spence were eventually\n\nKey Developments in Critical Race Film Studies\n\n25\n\njoined by deconstructionists and exponents of reception studies, all of whom wanted to leave simplistic stereotype and “positive image” studies behind. I refer to that “images school” as the “First Generation” of race-oriented film criticism, and to the works that move ahead with Neale’s propositions as “Second Generation” criticism. The labels serve two purposes: to order the bodies of work according to chronology and complexity. The point is to emphasize how the field has reached an impasse and been stagnant for quite some time. These labels also offer rhetorical meaning. Proper deference should be paid to the importance of “First Generation” race studies, and the term affords that body of writing a foundational and original status. Examinations of pernicious stereotypes contributed much, and present perhaps the clearest picture of cultural codes and the purest reifications of racist ideology. Likewise, the beginning of “Second Generation” study commemorates the conception of new ideas and the advancement of older ones. However, if we take secondgeneration criticism to have been birthed with Neale’s 1979 essay, I am moved to ask why critics continued to declare image study passé for at least a decade and a half after that. It appears as though the field no doubt progressed rapidly with a burst that lasted through the early 1980s, but has not experienced remotely comparable growth since. With that assessment, I disagree with those such as Wiegman who would argue that we have seen the start of a third generation of criticism, and who consider “the most important critical emphases in the 1990s” to be the study of “whiteness, and ethnicity in the context of global media culture.”5 Those that would be third generation are so similar and implicated with “Second Generation” work, that I am reluctant to accept that they represent headway.\n\nFirst-generation criticism Before the Anglo-American academy introduced itself to it, an English art critic, Peter Noble, had already identified the issue of ethnic representation in the cinema some 20-odd years earlier. His 1948 book, The Negro in Films, attempts to document a quite comprehensive catalogue of black stereotypes in Hollywood and European films.6 Noble contextualizes these depictions using a backdrop of social history, connecting the use and reuse of stereotypes to institutionalized racism in the film industry. This classic positive image study decries the association of blacks with intellectual and cultural primitivism\n\n26\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nand demands more humane and dignified black characters. At the same time, he attributes positive portrayals of black screen characters when they occurred to the personal and professional victories of industry personnel, and occasionally to the organizational strength of civil rights groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Edward Mapp then undertook a similar and slightly more academically oriented project in 1972. In his book, Blacks in American Films, Mapp recognizes a small group of unpublished master’s theses and doctoral dissertations written in the 1960s that examined limited samples of films. He envisioned his contribution as an addition to Noble’s, but without the social history. He compiled another comprehensive list of films that takes particular note of when black actors began to earn leading roles, as well as the professions and personal characteristics of the people they played. Mapp describes his “objective” and “systematic” methodology as one of “informal qualitative content analysis.”7 It turns out to be a scientific-sounding euphemism for a catalog. The first lengthy piece of first-generation criticism to emerge from the academy was Daniel J. Leab’s From Sambo to Superspade, out of research he conducted at Columbia University.8 Compared to what Noble and Mapp had done, this work broke little new conceptual ground, but Leab provides a more detailed industrial history of Hollywood’s production and distribution practices. He makes the standard connection between stereotype changes and movements in social mores, and attempts to find empirical causality in the film industry’s machinations and interactions with American politics. Perhaps most significant, it articulates that history using a new vocabulary. Leab displays what is up to this point a much keener analytical eye for mise en scène and narrative structure, a likely result of film studies’ ascension as a university discipline. First-generation criticism consists of semantic analysis. Its exponents such as Noble, Mapp, and Leab consider characters or images more or less in isolation from the rest of the text, and decipher what they denote. Basically, they hold that cinematic images possess an indexical significatory relationship to reality. Therefore, films deemed guilty of ideological representation directly reflect the presence of racism. First-generation criticism has much less to say however, about the text as a whole. In this regard, Leab’s book stands out to the extent that the author’s analytical method accounts for some of cinema’s formal and textual complexity. Even so, Neale rightly argues in “The Same Old Story” that limiting analysis to images “can easily obscure or even erase altogether those features of a text and its systems which are not only equally\n\nKey Developments in Critical Race Film Studies\n\n27\n\npertinent to the analysis but could also open up further areas of enquiry.”9 He exhibits poststructuralist instincts in faulting stereotype studies for their “inherent empiricism,” disputing the belief that both reality and the text itself are straightforwardly knowable. Leading with that initial critique, Neale proceeds to find that critics of stereotypes posit an evaluative standard that is contradictory. He observes them to assume two basic positions on any film. The first measures simple legible stereotypes against a reality that in fact encompasses a much greater “heterogeneity and complexity” of individual characters and experiences. In identifying films that come up short, stereotype critics make an implicit appeal for realism. Indeed, Noble exhibits this tendency perfectly, when he supports his claim that Hollywood films were misrepresenting true reality by citing the numbers of African Americans in the various professions from statistics collected in 1940 by the Bureau of Census Statistics.10 In a slight variation, Mapp locates the truth not in data but in the experience of the oppressed, when he writes that the issue is “the ability of white film critics to evaluate film portrayals of a black experience, alien to their own existence.”11 Alternatively, image studies also fault stereotypes for not living up to an ideal. This also adopts an equally inflexible notion of what reality could be as opposed to what it is. Although this perspective posits films as counterideological interventions rather than mere reflections on society, Neale points out that the “positive” representations they advocate is an identical solution that is just as limited. “[W]hat is in fact being demanded is the replacement of one set of stereotypes with another.”12 And as a stereotype, it is easily reprocessed into yet another round of first-generation analysis. As long as racism exists, critics of racial representation can rarely find any image quite positive enough. A quote from Leab demonstrates this. If box-office returns are to be believed, the new stereotype of Superspade is obviously (and understandably) more pleasing to the black community than was the earlier one. Yet whether Sambo or Superspade, the black image on screen has always lacked the dimension of humanity.13\n\nHow does Leab define “humanity”? Can we presume that he subscribes to a liberal humanist ideal? The book will return to this question later on, but for now, the stickiness of trying to conceive of ideal representations is clearly illustrated by these conundrums. For instance, Tarantino professed that Django Unchained arose out of his hatred of director John Ford for promulgating toxic\n\n28\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nracial stereotypes.14 But his attempts to reverse the effect of those images were hardly welcome, nor did they shield him from criticism (Figure 1.1). Take also the difficulties that black filmmaker Oscar Micheaux faced when he tried to tap the African American audience during the late silent and early sound era with racially conscious films centered on the black experience. Micheaux’s social conscience was perturbed by hegemonic images routinely appearing in Hollywood films, as his entrepreneurial leanings also drove him to seek profits in the ethnic film exhibition market. A discussion of the racial theories within his oeuvre lies beyond the scope of this project, but Michaeux did consider it important to present ideal representations of middle-class blacks on screen. Although his earlier films experienced some success, he was eventually stymied by competition from the mainstream commercial product. His lack of production values, distribution networks, and advertising budgets became an insurmountable obstacle for his independent work. But it remains clear that one reason he failed lay in the struggle to grasp what an alternative black reality was, much less one that African American audiences would respond to. As historian Thomas Cripps writes, Blacks simply did not see themselves on the screen—even the screen of Oscar Micheaux. Mere black presence on the screen, reflecting bourgeois white aspiration, no longer was enough. The cinema remained a silent and disused tool.15\n\nA similar problem complicates valuations of actor Sidney Poitier, whose fame and stardom in Hollywood were groundbreaking. Defying the buffoonery and\n\nFigure 1.1 Quentin Tarantino’s attempt to undo or reverse the racist stereotypes in John Ford’s westerns with Django Unchained (2012).\n\nKey Developments in Critical Race Film Studies\n\n29\n\nindecency that marked southern black stereotypes, he crafted a career as a leading man with a screen persona characterized by intelligence and dignity. But as firstgeneration critics point out, he became an over-conciliatory symbol of middleclass values and perhaps worse, a parodic modern Uncle Tom. Mapp states that some of his roles lacked fidelity to the real black experience, and in fact criticizes them for being too racially unmarked.16 Leab laments Poitier’s on-screen typage as an emasculated, saintly commercial for civil rights, who was also palatable to white liberals.17 These are reasonable arguments when considered by themselves, but they are paradoxical and reveal a tendency to think that no image or type is ever satisfactorily positive. Using a more recent example, consider the stereotype inversion in Lethal Weapon (1987), whose comedy is based on the conflict between a rigid, suburban black detective Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and his white partner, the crazy, unlawful outcast, Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). Although Murtaugh is a paragon of WASP virtue, positive image analysis does not perceive progress, but rather, the appearance of a cowardly and domesticated “tamed black man” subordinate to the white cop.18 Considering Neale’s critique that positive images might not be the cure-all for problems in racial representation, one example of first-generation criticism stands out among the work from that early era. A careful reading of Donald Bogle’s Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks from 1973 reveals that its title belies how the book strays from conventional image study.19 It distinguishes itself by problematizing reflectionism and challenging the accepted view of firstgeneration critics that stereotypes in the cinema have a unidirectional social and cultural impact on the audiences that consume them. Bogle presages Neale’s more didactic argument that preferring positive depictions over negative ones only serves to replace one limited representation with another. In fact, he does so with a harsh value judgment of Noble’s “typical, unintentionally patronizing, white liberal ‘tasteful’ approach.”20 In other words, Bogle recognizes that resisting cinematic racism requires more than condemning stereotypes and advocating positive images. As a primary antidote to racist ideology, positive images are both limiting and implicated in the very prejudice it seeks to challenge. Bogle proposes instead that stereotyped roles are not as self-evident as other first-generation critics presume. For him, films generally considered racist are more open to interpretation than they might seem. Viewers who dismiss stereotypes as completely denigrating “really missed or ignored the strength of those performances, and at the same time denied black America a certain cultural heritage.”21 When black actors were presented with degrading roles\n\n30\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nas, well, toms, coons, mulattoes, mammies, and bucks, they injected elements of excess like kitsch that elevated the aesthetic value of the performances and provided resistive moments that transcend stereotypes. For example, the dimwits that Stepin Fetchit played, Bogle argues, were the product of comic genius, and in fact so over-exaggerated that they display a distinct measure of irony and detachment. Hattie McDaniel’s flamboyant bossiness can be read as the expression of righteous hostility.22 In these instances, Bogle appears to theorize performance and reception, describing how African American audiences are active readers who do not blindly identify with screen characters, and at times suggesting that film spectators from the past utilized essentially Brechtian reading strategies to enact distance from the text. Twenty years later, Bogle’s would have been characterized as a reception study. By taking broad aim at those who champion positive images, Neale’s subsequent contention that “identification as the goal of an artistic practice can never be progressive since it fails to produce knowledge or to allow for the inscription of the potentiality of transformation—both of which are dependent upon the inscription of difference and of distance,”23 appears to have overlooked Bogle’s relatively unconventional thesis. Not even Manthia Diawara’s 1986 essay in Screen on “Black Spectatorship,” which proposes that “black spectators may circumvent identification and resist the persuasive elements of Hollywood narrative and spectacle,” accounts for the prescience of Bogle’s subtle but perceptible theory of spectatorship. Diawara is not the only one to lump Bogle with Leab, as if they were both (to borrow Neale’s words) the same old story.24 The oversight is then repeated in Stam and Spence’s Screen essay, “Colonialism, Racism and Representation.” They talk about how culturally aware audiences can perform “aberrant readings,” but more or less dismiss Bogle’s work as a generic stereotype study.25 Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks is ahead of its time. Bogle’s description of how black performers and filmgoers are alienated by racist stereotypes, and of the various ways that audiences may subvert their effects, implicitly champions a self-aware mode of consumption. While Bogle never uses the terminology as an overt Marxist, he couples alienation and transcendence in a manner that at least forces us to sit up and pay attention. By contrast, V. J. Jerome’s The Negro in Hollywood Films, first published two years after Noble’s book, was a full-throated Marxist critique. As an outspoken communist writer and cultural critic, Jerome argues that stereotypes are not part of a racist ideology, as much as the use of stereotypes is itself an ideology, designed by\n\nKey Developments in Critical Race Film Studies\n\n31\n\nmonopoly capitalist interests as a divisive tool to prevent a national uprising based on class consciousness against capitalism, fascism, and imperialism. He claims that racial controversies over stereotypes serve to splinter civil rights and labor groups, wedging apart black activists and white progressives, and thus preventing the formation of a powerful proletarian movement. Jerome wrote that blacks, preoccupied by white oppression, thus fail to understand “the true basis and nature of their oppression.”26 In his view, earlier virulent black images of “white supremacy” adapted themselves to become “Toms” with the aim of encouraging servility while denigrating social mobility. Films that appeared misleadingly progressive on race in fact laid the roots of black oppression completely at the feet of poor white southerners excluded from the power structure. Jerome’s sociological history focuses less on the complexity of how cinema functioned as a text and an institution, than on how social groups react to them. His critique even ensnared a fellow writer. If Jerome is correct and the purpose of racist stereotypes was to ultimately deter materialist class consciousness, Cripps appears to fulfill that prognostication when he disavows efforts to cultivate a labor coalition: “During the depressed thirties blacks became the darlings of the Communist Party so that NAACP picket lines regularly drew white radicals who gave an unwarranted Marxist identity to the blacks and threatened to co-opt the issue.”27 The historian toes the bourgeois establishment line of the NAACP, viewing Marxists as threats to their righteous racial cause. Jerome’s work is not commonly cited by critical race film studies, which might have marginalized it because he did not write from within the academic establishment. In any event, Jerome’s materialist concerns went unheeded in favor of race. Bogle is relatively much better known, but the field appears to have misclassified his work as image studies, and failed to register his model of critical spectatorship. In the next section’s focus on critical subjectivity’s presence in second-generation theory, this misperception is contextualized within the theoretical movement to decenter the subject.\n\nSecond-generation criticism The proliferation of first-generation criticism in the 1970s is understandable given the political and accessible nature of its analysis. It also rose to meet growing interest in image culture, consisting of film and other media such as\n\n32\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\ntelevision and news photography. The range of work produced was broad and often journalistic, moralistic, and evaluative. In comparison, second-generation ideas grew out of an established academic culture, the film studies tradition in particular. Many of its significant advances came in the pages of the scholarly journals Screen and Screen Education. Writers were obviously interested in studying cinema’s relationship to race, but it was not unusual for these essays to be primarily occupied with semiological issues. When the writing took a sharp theoretical turn, poststructuralism was particularly influential. Neale’s essay “The Same Old Story” belongs in this category. Its critique presents a corrective to first-generation critical race film scholarship by insisting that analysis should attend to the film “text as a whole and of the global systems that traverse and articulate it.” Since stereotypes are always new and different in each and every occurrence, Neale claims that negative images should not be isolated from other aspects of film structure.28 And although each film might be different and distinctive from every other, it should be understood with regard to the discursive environs beyond the text too. Furthermore, the racism within that discourse is too complex to expect the mere study of stereotypes to illuminate the problem completely. According to Neale, images are only signifiers, but taking in the larger picture can reveal the process of signification, the discursive dynamic of racism. To him, the stereotype as an element of film language should not be seen as unchanging, that is to say, “a stable and repetitive structure of character traits that” that can link “the specific text to other texts and other discursive structures.” Rather, he recommends that they be regarded in every specific instance, as part of a “discursive economy” where the difference and variation of their meanings are an intricate part of its fabric.” Identifying the racism of a film thus involves seeing “if the discourse through which [the film] is read contains that term and, hence, an explicit or implicit definition of it.”29 These formulations clearly eschew stable and essential knowledge. And by also looking to context for meaning, Neale takes an unmistakably poststructuralist posture. Neale’s designs for a new approach are fully engineered in Stam and Spence’s “Colonialism, Racism and Representation.” In an introductory critique of preceding methodology, they too question “progressive realism,” and hence the processes by which first-generation critics define positive images as good and negative images as conversely bad.30 Those well-meaning analyses, Stam and Spence repeat, are nonetheless predicated on a bourgeois, paternalistic, and Eurocentric ideal. They essentially agree with Neale’s reference to discursive economies or cultural fabrics, in arguing that any analysis must account for a\n\nKey Developments in Critical Race Film Studies\n\n33\n\nfilm’s “cultural specificity,” which would require an awareness of relevant “cultural codes.”31 Stam and Spence also promise more attention to the “mediations which intervene between ‘reality’ and representation,” or in other words, cinematic structure, convention, and style.32 Unlike novels or plays, racism in the film medium possesses a “specifically cinematic” dimension, which in turn produces a unique “paradigmatic perspective.”33 To wit, Stam and Spence sought to examine how cinema’s unique language articulates racial ideologies. Using Gillo Pontecorvo’s anticolonial masterpiece, Battle of Algiers (1966) as a central example, they explain how a film’s progressive or regressive attitude vis-à-vis racism can be identified in the discursive mechanisms at work within and without the text. For example, films construct points-of-view using cinematography and editing, to produce “paradigmatic perspectives” that can be divided further into physical and political forms of positioning. If first-generation stereotype studies were semantic, second-generation analysis highlights the power of film’s syntax. Physical positioning refers to how spectators’ visual perspectives are shaped using a combination of shot scale, mise en scène, music, and point-of-audition sounds. This places viewers in specific spots in the diegetic space. Political positioning pertains to how the same film techniques elicit sympathies and visceral reactions. Together, the resultant point-of-view determines whom audiences are likely to identify with. In Battle of Algiers, Stam and Spence discover political rhetoric crafted by the film’s refusal to mystify and demonize Algerian rebels as faceless, irrational, and unsympathetic terrorists. Their exposition of spectator positioning and the cinematic apparatus was followed in Screen shortly after by Homi Bhabha’s deconstructionist “The Other Question . . .,” a key text relied on by numerous works in critical race film studies for its theoretical model of race, cultural discourse, and identity.34 Bhabha too returns to the stereotype, and although he agrees with Stam and Spence that “fixity” and essential quality of the text deserves poststructuralist scrutiny, he maintains that they do not go far enough to destabilize it. He objects to the fact that “there remains in their essay a limiting and traditional reliance on the stereotype as offering, at any one time, a secure point of identification.”35 He problematizes the possibility of subjective identification by presuming that the sign is inherently ambivalent, structured only by accepted and not stable truths. Lingering anxiety about stereotypes’ truthfulness in turn requires constant discursive repetition and reinforcement. As a result, these representations of the Other are “at once an object of desire and derision, an articulation of difference contained within the fantasy of origin and identity.”36 An unstable\n\n34\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nsign produces an unstable text, resulting a state of flux that precludes stable subjectivity. Let us return to Neale’s critique and recall that he faulted first-generation criticism for wanting to say two contradictory things: that the stereotype should reflect empirical reality and a progressive ideal. While Neale sees this contradiction as an epistemological aporia and pragmatic crisis, Bhabha would probably consider it a consequence of the “play of difference” intrinsic to the stereotype. He faults Stam and Spence for operating a “passive and unitary notion of suture which simplifies the politics and ‘aesthetics’ of spectator positioning by ignoring the ambivalent, psychical process of identification.”37 To him, the spectator’s relationship to the text is also unstable. He argues that colonial power does not express racism by merely misrepresenting the colonized Other. Rather, it actually imposes an illusory stability onto fluid fields of meaning. Alternatively, colonial discourse “is an apparatus that turns on the recognition and disavowal of racial/cultural/historical differences,” hence arresting the process of subjectification.38 Because colonial discourse articulates differences in predominantly sexual and racial terms, Bhabha likens the process to that at the scene of fetishism, where there is “a reactivation of the material of original fantasy . . . as well as a normalization of that difference and disturbance in terms of the fetish object as the substitute for the mother’s penis.” He thus compares the stereotype to a fetish, for doing so will illuminate the “productive ambivalence of colonial discourse,” reveal its boundaries, and eventually enable “a transgression of these limits from the space of that otherness.”39 Deconstructionist theory that attempted to lay bare the ambivalence of colonial discourse attracted others in critical race film studies, among them Richard Dyer. He expanded “White,” a seminal 1988 essay in Screen studying white identity in cinema, into a book almost a decade later.40 Dyer’s analysis of whiteness would seem to pick up on Bhabha’s claim that colonial stereotypes are “complex, ambivalent [and] contradictory.”41 Tilting that form of scrutiny onto whiteness, Dyer examines the connection between how it is signified and how that manner of signification produces a structural privilege in racial discourse. It is a position on the ethnic stereotype that follows Bhabha’s; he observes that its power can be located in the ability to stabilize the sign of nonwhiteness. Dyer points out that whiteness’s real power stems from its freedom to exist as an unquestioned paradox—“it both is and is not a colour, is and is not a tangible sign.”42 This capacity to exist and operate in an invisible dimension is also alluded to by postcolonial studies scholar Edward Said, whose book Orientalism\n\nKey Developments in Critical Race Film Studies\n\n35\n\nexamines the perceived neutrality of colonial discourse. Dyer avers that white masculinity in particular, has a “divided nature,” contradictory in the manner that it encompasses a multitude of signs along scales of both race and gender: light and dark, masculine and feminine. It is “exceptional, excessive, marked” yet also “non-extreme, unspectacular, plain,” and ordinary.43 From this highly fluid and multifaceted state, it reaches ideological stability not by repressing excess signification, for that would deny whiteness its most potent power. Rather, it does so by denying all signification, thus adopting the character of emptiness. If Neale chided image studies for not explaining how racism actually works, Bhabha takes a credible stab at it. But I argue that the latter’s basic methodology leads to some striking paradoxes that set the stage for the rest of this chapter. His appropriation of psychoanalysis leads us possibly to a point of psychic origin, ostensibly within the unified individual subject who is able to observe the stereotype’s vacillations. Bhabha contends that the colonizer does not control all colonial power and discourse because he cannot determine interpretation absolutely. The way to attack colonial ideology is to take advantage of signs’ inherent instability and produce subversive readings, which is a task left to the critical individual subject. Writing about Mexican American identity and film, Juan J. Alonso has highlighted this issue in Bhabha’s schema as well, but he defines that agential subject a bit differently. Alonso sees it as an ethnically delimited one whose identity is socially constructed by cultural practices and social conditions.44 With this book, I take an extra leap in identifying this individual as a Neo-Marxian critical subject, then proceeding to employ that precept to prosecute a case for historical materialism. What is more, Bhabha happens to leave a materialist notion of reality available. The strategic articulation of ‘coordinates of knowledge’—racial and sexual— and their inscription in the play of colonial power as modes of differentiation, defense, fixation, hierarchisation, is a way of specifying colonial discourse which would be illuminated by reference to Foucault’s post-structuralist concept of the dispositif or apparatus.45\n\nHe refers to colonial discourse as something that is evidently separate from colonial power. He could have specifically defined the material conditions of that power, military or imperial, as discursively contingent, but does not. The fact that the “coordinates of knowledge” are drawn on racial and sexual axes indicates that there is a material reality in which this “play” of signification and subjectivities exists.\n\n36\n\nThe Subject of Film and Race\n\nThe importance of materialism is made clear when we apply Bhabha’s method to think about The Karate Kid (1984), a film that is important in its own way, so popular that it is now part of the cultural lexicon. The film mixes cultural markers together. Like the eponymous martial art, the protagonist’s mentor is Japanese and played by the Japanese American actor Pat Morita. But some Asian viewers could discern that he was drilling his protégé in Chinese kung-fu techniques. The 2010 remake is set in China and starred Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan but keeps the original title, and the contradiction. Ideas of ambivalence and significatory excess are immensely applicable here, where an incompatible cluster of fetishized Asian signifiers is forcibly bound to these fantasies of an imagined Asian Other. Yet the analysis is incomplete without gazing as well at the political economic context accompanying both films. The 1984 film’s preponderant Japaneseness and the 2010 version’s Sino-spectacle point directly to American anxieties over the respective economic challenges posed by these two countries during those periods. If power is empirically wielded in reality, it becomes germane to consider cinema’s economic and political structures. Two kinds of cinema and their modes of production raise relevant questions that should discourage us from overstating textual ambiguity as an avenue to ideological subversion. The first case is classical Hollywood cinema, especially since a work such as Ruth Vasey’s The World According to Hollywood has described how it deliberately left films open to multiple interpretations in order to bypass censors and to maximize the market for broad-based consumption of the product. Raising the ire of foreign governments or ethnic social activists could impact a film’s distribution, especially abroad. To lessen the chance that they would protest unfavorable representations of their nationalities or cultures, the studios developed a “principle of deniability” predicated on constructing an “ambiguous text.”46 Racial, ethnic, and cultural markers were often stripped of specificity as a shrewd strategy of political correctness. By using textual ambiguity to its advantage, classical Hollywood’s capitalist regime stayed ahead of the game. Admittedly, this dated Hollywood practice does not necessarily invalidate Bhabha’s arguments regarding ideology’s function to suppress the contingency of the sign and the text. And it is not to say that anyone is going to confuse a Hollywood production, even with all the ambiguity one can imagine, with an avant-garde piece of ethno-deconstructive filmmaking such as Trinh Minh-ha’s experimental documentary Reassemblage (1982). However, the strength of Bhabha’s theory depends on its applicability to mainstream film, a model that Vasey’s analysis partly dampens. In the final\n\nKey Developments in Critical Race Film Studies\n\n37\n\nanalysis, how distinguishable is the distinction between Bhabha’s “ambivalence” and Hollywood’s “ambiguity”? Hollywood’s conscientious construction of indeterminacy can for all intents and purposes be identical to what Bhabha believes is the stereotype’s “overdetermined” quality.47 Can a radical reading really open up the playing field, or do we sometimes still find ourselves on the same turf laid down by the culture industry? Bhabha’s theory is also problematic for the polemical film that relies on realism as a political aesthetic, which is to say that it assumes the presence of unified, fixed, essential, and knowable categories such as nation, culture, or author. Indigenous films, Third Cinema, and expository documentaries are such genres. For a film like that, a deconstructive reading would open up the text, but would it not also disempower it and the author, in effect silencing the Other who has seized control of the mode of production? As Valerie Smith writes, black cinema is defined by the blackness of its authors. To the extent that it seeks to replace ‘false’ representations with positive, by extension ‘true’ or ‘authentic’ ones, the project of black film might thus be read as the search for an authentic black subject.48\n\nWith a slightly divergent view, Stuart Hall also touches upon this uneasy relationship between realism and poststructuralism.49 He writes that the postcolonial film should not be read as a “second-"
