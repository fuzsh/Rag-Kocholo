        "text": "Voyager 1 has been exploring our solar system since 1977. The probe is now in interstellar space, the region outside the heliopause, or the bubble of energetic particles and magnetic fields from the Sun. Voyager 1 was launched after Voyager 2, but because of a faster route it exited the asteroid belt earlier than its twin, and it overtook Voyager 2 on Dec. 15, 1977.\n\nVoyager 1 launched after Voyager 2, but because of a faster route it exited the solar system earlier than its twin. Voyager 1 overtook Voyager 2 on Dec. 15, 1977.\n\nVoyager 1 began studying Jupiter in April 1978 at a range of 165 million miles (265 million km). Images showed Jupiter’s atmosphere to be more turbulent than during the Pioneer 10 and 11 flybys. Voyager 1 took a picture every 96 seconds to create a timelapse movie of the approach.\n\nIn early 1979, Voyager 1 discovered a faint ring system around Jupiter. The spacecraft’s closest encounter with Jupiter was at 12:05 UT on March 5, 1979 at a range of 174,000 miles (280,000 km), It went on to encounter several of Jupiter’s moons, including Amalthea, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Spectacular close-up photos of the moons opened up completely new worlds for planetary scientists. The spacecraft discovered two new moons, Thebe and Metis.\n\nIts flyby of the Saturn system in November 1979 was as spectacular as the Jupiter encounter. Voyager 1 found five new moons, a new ring, and complicated ring structures, including “shepherd moons” that keep some rings well-defined. The spacecraft photographed Saturn’s moons Titan, Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea. All the moons appeared to be composed largely of water ice.\n\nImages of Titan showed a thick atmosphere that completely hid the surface. The spacecraft found that the Titan’s atmosphere was composed of 90% nitrogen. Nitrogen, methane, and more complex hydrocarbons indicated prebiotic chemical reactions might be possible on Titan.\n\nAfter Saturn, Voyager 1 headed north out of the ecliptic plane at a speed of about 3.5 AU per year. Because of the specific requirements for the Titan flyby, the spacecraft was not directed to Uranus and Neptune.\n\nVoyager 1’s final 64 images were a mosaic taken at a distance of 40 Astronomical Units (AU) from the Sun. This solar system family portrait included six planets (Mercury and Mars were not visible). The image of Earth inspired the “Pale Blue Dot” made famous by Voyager science team member Carl Sagan (1934-1996). These were the last of a total of 67,000 images taken by the two Voyagers.\n\nThe Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) began on Jan, 1, 1990. The goal was to extend exploration to the outer limits of the Sun’s sphere of influence and beyond.\n\nVoyager 1 continues to communicate with NASA’s Deep Space Network and send data back from four still-functioning instruments — the cosmic ray telescope, the low-energy charged particles experiment, the magnetometer, and the plasma waves experiment.\n\nEach of the Voyagers contain a message to potential extraterrestrials in the form of a 30-centimeter diameter gold-plated copper disc. Like the plaques on Pioneers 10 and 11, the Voyager Golden Record has inscribed symbols that show the location of Earth relative to several pulsars. The record includes instructions to play it similar to a vinyl record player.\n\nAudio on the disc includes greetings in 55 languages, 35 sounds from life on Earth (such as whale songs, laughter, etc.), 90 minutes of music including everything from Mozart and Bach to Chuck Berry and Blind Willie Johnson. It also includes 115 images of life on Earth and recorded greetings from then U.S. President Jimmy Carter and then-UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim.\n\nAs of Aug. 21, 2024, Voyager 1 was 164.7 AU from Earth — the farthest object created by humans — moving at a velocity of 38,026.79 mph (17.0 km/second) relative to the Sun."
