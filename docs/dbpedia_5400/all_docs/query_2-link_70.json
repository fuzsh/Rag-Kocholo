        "text": "BMFI at the Barnes Seminar: Grand Illusion\n\nTaught by Paul McEwan, Ph.D., Film Studies Program, Muhlenberg College\n\nThis series presents screenings of essential works of world cinema enhanced by lectures and discussions that utilize diverse critical perspectives to enrich viewers' appreciation of the films. Instructors will explore cinematic technique, artistic tradition, cultural context, and historical perspective to inform and intensify the audience's engagement with these exceptional motion pictures.\n\nJoin us for a lecture, screening, and discussion of a true masterpiece of world cinema, Grand Illusion (1937), directed by Jean Renoir. It is a war film that does not depict any scenes of battle, yet is considered one of the most haunting members of its genre, and becomes, in the words of one critic, an \"oasis of subtlety, moral intelligence, and deep emotion on a cinematic landscape.\" Renoir creates a tragic chamber drama of prison camp life and death in World War I, in which he uses the POW encampment as a microcosm of Europe, studying the interplay of a motley group of French officers forced to live together under the eyes of their German captors.\n\nIn doing so, the filmmaker examines issues of class, race, and nationalism, and in the process celebrates the universal humanity that transcends such categories, suggesting that mankind's common experiences should prevail above political divisions, and their natural extension: war. Grand Illusion is a film that elicited the admiration of many viewers upon its American release, less than a year before the start of World War II, among them President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who declared that \"all democracies in the world must see this film.\"\n\nBMFI at the Barnes Seminar: Rashomon\n\nTaught by Paul Wright, Ph.D., Department of English, Cabrini College\n\nThis series presents screenings of essential works of world cinema enhanced by lectures and discussions that utilize diverse critical perspectives to enrich viewers’ appreciation of the films. Instructors will explore cinematic technique, artistic tradition, cultural context, and historical perspective to inform and intensify the audience’s engagement with these exceptional motion pictures.\n\nJoin us for a lecture, screening, and discussion of Rashomon (1950), Akira Kurosawa’s masterwork of post-war Japanese film that introduced that nation’s cinema—and one of its most skilled practitioners—to Western audiences. Set in feudal Japan, this tense exploration of the subjective nature of truth and the meaning of justice centers on four individuals who give differing accounts of a bandit’s attack on a married couple. Starring the iconic Toshiro Mifune and featuring ingeniously subtle editing to showcase, among other elements, cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa’s inventive use of natural light, Rashomon is an aesthetic and intellectual achievement that has inspired filmmakers, composers, and playwrights for generations.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nTaught by Christopher Long, M.A., Author and Film Critic\n\nMiss this seminar at BMFI? Stream it now. Rent\n\nStanley Kubrick's visionary science-fiction epic, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), divided critics at the time of its release. A young Roger Ebert praised it for “succeed(ing) magnificently on a cosmic scale,” while the influential Pauline Kael dismissed the film as “monumentally unimaginative.”\n\nKubrick, collaborating with science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, crafted an ambitious work about (among other things) evolution, alien contact, and the limits of technological progress. Its style is equally bold, as 2001 leaps forward thousands of years in the moment of a single jump cut, opens and closes with lengthy, largely dialogue-free sequences, and often relies on classical music and cutting-edge visual effects to propel its ambiguous narrative. These elements have sparked more than fifty years' worth of heated debates over what exactly happens in the movie: “What the **** is that Starchild all about?”\n\n2001 not only expanded the boundaries of traditional science-fiction cinema, but it tapped into the '60s counter-culture zeitgeist, leading savvy marketers to rebrand the film as “The Ultimate Trip” on its way to becoming an unlikely box-office smash. Join us to take that ultimate trip the way it was meant to be experienced . . . on the big screen.\n\nJust want to see the movie?

All students receive an introductory lecture before the film and a guided discussion after the film. In addition, those who attend the seminar on site at BMFI receive a ticket to see it on the big screen, as well as popcorn and a drink.\n\nPlease note: There are two ways to attend in this seminar:\n\nOn site, at BMFI, in one of our theaters: Registration and seat selection must be done in advance, online, via the “ON SITE” button under the “Course Information” heading. There will be no walk-up registrations for this seminar. If you wish to attend in our Remote Classroom, please do so via the “AT HOME” button under the “Remote Classroom” heading. You will be able to livestream the pre-screening lecture and participate in the post-screening discussion, but the movie is not included (nor are popcorn and a drink, we’re sorry to say).\n\nPlease email BMFI education coordinator Jill Malcolm with any questions.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: 8 ½\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nHave you wanted to take a film class at BMFI but couldn’t commit to multiple sessions? Are you interested in learning more about a particular classic film? Do you want an entertaining and engaging way to spend an evening?\n\nIf you answered “yes” to any of the questions above, then this Cinema Classics Seminar is for you. It features a stand-alone class built around Federico Fellini’s visually stunning 1963 flight of cinematic fancy, 8 ½, starring Marcello Mastroianni as a director at a creative and personal impasse, exhausted by his frantic efforts to keep his life in order, yet teeming with imagination. Proclaimed by Roger Ebert to be “the best film ever made about filmmaking,” 8 ½ has inspired the likes of François Truffaut, Bob Fosse, and Woody Allen.\n\nThis one-night seminar offers an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about a true classic of world cinema. Students receive a reading about the film, an introductory lecture before the film, and a guided discussion after the film. In addition, your ticket to see it on the big screen, as well as popcorn and a drink, are included.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: A Hard Day's Night (Fall 2021)\n\nTaught by Paul McEwan, Ph.D., Film Studies Program, Muhlenberg College\n\nMade quickly on a shoestring budget because no one was sure that The Beatles’ fame would last long enough for it to make back its money, A Hard Day’s Night (1964) shattered every expectation of what a jukebox film made for teen audiences could accomplish. Not only were fans more than eager to see their idols on screen—the surprise was that the critics loved it as well.\n\nCritic Andrew Sarris later called it “the Citizen Kane of jukebox musicals,” and it was nominated for two Academy Awards—not only Best Score (hardly a surprise) but also Best Screenplay. The latter is not exactly common for a film whose story is just a frame for the songs and the gags. But in this case the personalities of the four Beatles shine through, each playing slightly exaggerated versions of themselves and clearly having a good time doing it. Director Richard Lester would go on to have a long and varied career with films as disparate as A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum and Superman II.\n\nAnd then, of course, there’s the music. A Hard Day’s Night marked the transition to the rich middle period of The Beatles’ career, a four-year run in which they dramatically expanded the possibilities of what pop and rock could be. In the spring of 1964, though, that was still all ahead of them. They were simply a band grappling with incredible fame and the pressures it brought, without losing sight of their own camaraderie or the joy of singing in perfect harmony.\n\nJust want to see the movie?

Hardly anybody anticipated that a film project launched primarily to boost sales of the group's upcoming album would be viewed, fifty years later, as a cinematic landmark.\n\nAmerican director Richard Lester's brand of surreal anarchy was a perfect match for the cheeky irreverence of the mop-topped Liverpudlians whose most endearing attribute, aside from their talent, was their refusal to take their fame (or much of anything else) all that seriously. Just a few months after invading America, John, Paul, George, and Ringo conquered the silver screen; the rest of the world would soon follow. A promotional piece, a time-capsule documentary, a hilarious comedy, and a heck of a concert movie, A Hard Day's Night is the whole package. Put another way, by Village Voice critic Andrew Sarris, the film is \"the Citizen Kane of jukebox musicals.\"\n\nThese one-night seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema. Students receive an introductory lecture before the film and a guided discussion after the film. In addition, your ticket to see it on the big screen, as well as popcorn and a drink, are included.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: A Night at the Opera\n\nTaught by Christopher Long, M.A., Film Critic and Author\n\nAfter Duck Soup (1933) failed to connect with critics, the Marx Brothers left Paramount for MGM. Would their brand of anarchic humor survive studio head Irving Thalberg's plan to anchor their zaniness with a more traditionally structured narrative and even a love story? For A Night at the Opera (1935), at least, the answer was \"yes.\"\n\nWith Zeppo leaving the act to become an agent, the Marx Brothers were down to three (or four if you count their ever-reliable \"straight man,\" Margaret Dumont). Groucho, Chico, and Harpo were still a force sufficient to take on the world of opera, deflating (or knocking cold) every stuck-up snob unfortunate enough to cross their paths, while also making sure two young, aspiring singers (Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones, in early roles) found both love and success along the way. From the \"Sanity Clause\" to the most crowded ship's stateroom in maritime history, A Night at the Opera features some of the boys' most memorable film gags and clicked in a big way with Depression-era audiences eager for a good laugh. Come spend a night with the Marx Brothers to find out why.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: A Streetcar Named Desire\n\nTaught by Paul McEwan, Ph.D., Film Studies Program, Muhlenberg College\n\nIt’s one of only two movies in history to win three acting Oscars. Its source text is a longtime staple of high school English courses. It’s been widely referenced and parodied for decades by the likes of Bob Dylan, Seinfeld, The Simpsons, Pedro Almodóvar (in All About My Mother), and more. All that fame can make A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) a hard film to see for what it actually is.\n\nIn this seminar, we’ll dig past the cultural hoopla to examine how this extraordinary film came into being and its complex reception between 1951 and the present day. An acting tour de force (only relative newcomer Marlon Brando didn’t win the Oscar for which he was nominated) that was adapted from a successful Broadway production, it channels the claustrophobia of the original play while letting the action breathe just enough.\n\nStreetcar is a complex portrait of social class, gender, and violence in the mid-century South, and a story whose meanings have shifted considerably over 70 years. Director Elia Kazan was well-versed in bringing the complexities of American social relations to the screen, having already directed Gentleman’s Agreement and Pinky, which both dealt with the convolutions of discrimination and personal hatreds. Like a Shakespearean play, there is enough richness in A Streetcar Named Desire to teach us something about the period in which it was produced—and about ourselves in the process.\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie?

The film presents a nihilistic vision of a universe dominated by corporate greed that sees a manufacturing-based economic expansion into space in order to mine planets for their commercial resources. The crew is divided across obvious class boundaries, with the lumpen proletariat confined to the bowels of the ship, there to impotently bemoan the discrepancies of income dispersals. Ruling over all is the company, whose desires are enacted without hesitation by their manufactured products, machines imbued with artificial intelligence that assert their own agenda through means overt and covert. This faceless corporate enterprise prizes the acquisition of assets for financial gain above all else, with human life becoming an expendable asset in the attainment of lucrative commercial product.\n\nThe film’s eponymous entity, designed by H.R. Giger to be both terrifying and beautiful, and reputedly inspired by a photograph of a Sudanese warrior taken by director Leni Riefenstahl, echoes the eugenics-inspired fears of America’s past, while simultaneously reflecting growing concerns over the military industrial complex sparked by the Vietnam War. It is a creature that has become one of the most iconic figures of science fiction and horror cinema. If the screening alone doesn’t make clear why, this seminar’s lecture and discussion surely will.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Aliens\n\nTaught by Andrew M. Karasik, Film Producer, 30th Street Entertainment\n\n20th Century Fox initially had no interest in making a sequel to its lauded and lucrative science fiction/horror hybrid, Alien (1979), and being sued by some of the film’s producers didn’t help.\n\nEnter James Cameron, a brash, Canadian writer/director who was finishing production on his own bold, new entry in the science fiction genre: The Terminator. When that film became an enormous success, James Cameron and his producing partner, Gale Ann Hurd, were given creative control over what would become Aliens (1986).\n\nCameron aimed to attract new audiences, along with skeptical fans of the original, by giving the sequel its own distinct feel, while maintaining a clear connection to the source material. Awakened after decades in stasis, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is haunted by her encounter with the alien and the losses that ensued. Manipulated into returning to its planet, she now finds herself in the role of a matriarch fiercely protective of her charges, which include a platoon of soldiers and an orphaned girl.\n\nThis scenario allows Aliens to expand upon the original film’s exploration of feminine strength confronting tremendous odds. Yet, while Cameron makes the sequel more intimate emotionally, he also enlarges it in a visual and kinetic sense, converting the terrifying claustrophobia of Alien’s ship into the looming, open expanses of Aliens’ terraforming colony. He manages to inspire the same heart-racing trepidation as the original, while giving his subjects more literal and figurative space to roam.\n\nDuring this brief study of this remarkable science fiction/action film, we will contrast Aliens with its predecessor while discovering the unique elements that set the film apart as not only as one of Hollywood’s greatest sequels, but as an exemplar of genre craftsmanship in its own right.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: All About Eve\n\nTaught by Alice Bullitt, M.A., BMFI\n\nHave you wanted to take a film class at BMFI but couldn’t commit to multiple sessions? Are you interested in learning more about a particular classic film? Do you want an entertaining, engaging, and comfortable way to spend a hot summer evening?\n\nIf you answered “yes” to any of the questions above, then our Summer Classics Seminars are for you. This one focuses on All About Eve, the dramatic tale of an aging star and her conniving rival, written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and starring Bette Davis in what Roger Ebert calls \"her greatest role.\"\n\nJust like our regular courses, each class will offer students a reading about the film, an introductory lecture before the film, and a guided discussion after the film. In addition, your ticket to see the film on the big screen, as well as popcorn and a drink, are included.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: All That Heaven Allows (Fall 2019)\n\nTaught by Jennifer Fleeger, Ph.D., Film Studies Program, Ursinus College\n\nFor many years, Douglas Sirk’s “women’s pictures” were dismissed as heavy-handed and superficial, but in the 1970s, film critics began to see how the German director’s keen insight into American culture is made manifest in his film style. His American melodramas are rich with color, full of music, and rife with symbolism, offering a glorious critique of a contemporary life that promises the purchase of happiness but actually sells sorrow. In that regard, All That Heaven Allows (1955) is among his best.\n\nThe story of a romance that crosses the lines of both age and class, the film features Jane Wyman as a country-club widow navigating suburban malaise with her two inconsiderate adult children. Once again playing Wyman’s love interest—as he did in Sirk’s Magnificent Obsession—Rock Hudson plays a young gardener under the influence of Thoreau’s Walden. He rejects the social norms of postwar America to build a cabin in the woods, live simply, and befriend wild deer.\n\nBut lest you think this is an entirely somber affair, the film also has a deliciously malicious role for veteran radio, stage, and screen actress Agnes Moorehead, and a fabulously melodramatic Christmas scene. Join us for the high drama and vivid colors, and stay to learn about Sirk’s career, the history of the Hollywood melodrama, and the representation of suburbia on American screens in the 1950s.\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie?

Are you interested in learning more about a particular classic film? Do you want an entertaining, engaging, and comfortable way to spend a hot summer evening?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any of the questions above, then our Summer Classics Seminars are for you. This one focuses on All That Heaven Allows, a lush melodrama about social mores and forbidden love. It was directed by the master of the Technicolor weepie, Douglas Sirk, and stars Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman.\n\nJust like our regular courses, each class will offer students a reading about the film, an introductory lecture before the film, and a guided discussion after the film. In addition, your ticket to see the film on the big screen, as well as popcorn and a drink, are included.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: All That Jazz\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nAll That Jazz (1979) is a surreal spectacle depicting the hectic professional life, promiscuous love life, and death-infatuated fantasy life of a celebrated but insecure choreographer-filmmaker named Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider). Director/co-screenwriter Bob Fosse imbues this semi-autobiographical work with the spirit of Fellini’s 8½, and like that Italian masterpiece, Fosse’s brilliantly stylized and kinetically riveting musical is almost two films. The first is akin to a documentary about the making of a Broadway show by an exceptionally inventive choreographer and filmmaker; the second is a thoroughly Felliniesque series of dream sequences/musical numbers in which the women in Gideon’s life castigate him in song and dance.\n\nAll That Jazz has been described as a musical film that people who don't like musicals can also enjoy. In part, this is because it contains less singing and dancing than many films in the genre; but the real reason is that the non-musical portions are so revealing of who Bob Fosse was while avoiding the clichés of the artist wholly as a raging beast or misunderstood genius. Gideon is capable of feeling deep regret and great appreciation, has people who love him, and also happens to be enormously talented. For these reasons, All That Jazz works as art and as entertainment, as a musical and as an anti-musical. Join us to explore the dichotomies at the heart of this work by—and about—a truly meteoric talent.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: An American in Paris\n\nTaught by Jennifer Fleeger, Ph.D., Film Studies Program, Ursinus College\n\nAn American in Paris (1951) was envisioned as a celebration of George Gershwin’s catalogue, which MGM purchased after the composer’s death, and particularly songs like “I Got Rhythm,” “S’Wonderful,” and “Our Love is Here to Stay.” It also showcases an elaborate concert fantasy sequence featuring real-life classical pianist Oscar Levant, and a seventeen-minute ballet featuring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron in her film debut. These latter elements push the boundaries of what a screen musical can do and prompt us to think about the purpose of cinema itself.\n\nAn American in Paris challenges conventions in other ways, too. Although the film has the expected romantic plot between its co-stars, it is really more about the relationships between Kelly’s former G.I. and his male friends. Or perhaps it’s about his relationship to beauty, life, and art. The dance sequences are among Kelly’s best, and the songs, elaborate painted sets, Technicolor, and sense of optimism were a boon for the studio in the post-war era. The film garnered six Oscars, including Best Picture—a controversial choice in a year filled with serious dramas. Among other topics, this seminar will discuss the place of Paris in the American cultural imagination, the stylistic changes in US cinema at the dawn of the 1950s, and the role of producer Arthur Freed in defining the look and feel of the American film musical.\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie?

Are you interested in learning more about a particular classic film? Do you want an entertaining, engaging, and comfortable way to spend a hot summer evening?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any of the questions above, then our Summer Classics Seminars are for you. This one focuses on Back to the Future, the ingenious and hilarious time-travel adventure combining dazzling effects with old-fashioned fun to create a flawlessly constructed film that is at once nostalgic and new. It was co-written (with Bob Gale) and directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Flight), whom, according to Roger Ebert, \"shows not only a fine comic touch but also some of the lighthearted humanism of a Frank Capra,\" and stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Crispin Glover.\n\nJust like our regular courses, each class will offer students a reading about the film, an introductory lecture before the film, and a guided discussion after the film. In addition, your ticket to see the film on the big screen, as well as popcorn and a drink, are included.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Band of Outsiders\n\nTaught by Raymond Saraceni, Ph.D., Center for Liberal Education, Villanova University\n\n“We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XV,” director Jean-Luc Godard said of the radical transformation of filmmaking accomplished by the French New Wave, of which Godard himself was perhaps the most decisive and visionary member. Unleashing a radical assault upon an industry that emphasized craft over experimentation and decorous, commercial sophistication over spontaneity and verve, Band of Outsiders (1964) provides an excellent introduction to an aesthetic movement that redefined what film might accomplish and what audiences might experience.\n\nThis is a heist film where the heist itself often feels secondary, a (kind of) gangster film where the hoods operate as if inhabiting a peculiar dream of a gangster film, described by Godard as “Alice in Wonderland meets Franz Kafka.” While an apparently authoritative narrative voice leads us down blind alleys, thoroughly modern and unsentimental young toughs break into spontaneous dance routines. Passion and violence might lurk within every frame of Band of Outsiders, but rarely have they been detailed and dissected with such cool yet exuberant detachment. Equal parts pulpy fun and existential meditation—defined in no small measure by Anna Karina’s tough-as-nails performance—Band of Outsiders still feels like a breath of fresh air, albeit one with a trace of bitterness. Never has the postwar moral vacuum felt so sexy and chic.\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie? That’s easy! Just come to the box office or buy a ticket online here.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Battleship Potemkin\n\nTaught by Andrew J. Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nHave you wanted to take a film class at BMFI but couldn’t commit to multiple sessions? Are you interested in learning more about a particular classic film? Do you want an entertaining and engaging way to spend an evening?\n\nIf you answered “yes” to any of the questions above, then this Cinema Classics Seminar is for you. It features a stand-alone class built around the landmark 1925 work of Soviet propaganda, Battleship Potemkin, directed by Sergei Eisenstein in true montage fashion.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Beauty and the Beast\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nJean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946) is one of the most magical of all films, but also one with a timely message. As Roger Ebert wrote, “Cocteau . . . was not making a ‘children's film,’ but was adapting a classic French tale that he felt had a special message after the suffering of World War II: Anyone who has an unhappy childhood may grow up to be a Beast.” This adaptation of the traditional fairy tale, written by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont and published in 1757 as part of an anthology, welcomes us into a world not of sweetness and light, but of conflict and corruption, with Belle (Josette Day) a lone island of virtue. It is a “fallen world,” the iniquity of which is so effectively conveyed by Cocteau as to make Belle’s (and our) introduction into the Beast’s (Jean Marais) domain all the more wondrous.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Black Girl and \"Borom Sarret\"\n\nTaught by Christopher Long, M.A., Film Critic and Author\n\nIt is difficult to identify any single person as \"the father of African cinema,\" as Ousmane Sembene has often been called, but his influence on both African film and filmmakers throughout the world over the past half century is enormous, yet still greatly underappreciated. Born in southern Senegal in 1923, Sembene was raised as a fisherman, trained as an auto mechanic, drafted by the French army in World War II, and worked on the docks of Marseilles before publishing his first novel, The Black Docker, in 1956.\n\nA successful literary career in hand, he then studied cinema in Moscow and produced his first short film, \"Borom Sarret,\" in 1963. In 1966, he shot his debut feature, the crisp and devastating Black Girl (1966), the story of a young Senegalese woman (Mbissine Thérèse Diop) who moves from Dakar to France to work for a French couple. Dreaming of glamor on the Riviera, she instead finds a life of drudgery where she is seen only as \"the black girl.\"\n\nBoth early works demonstrate Sembene's ability to balance a perceptive critique of Western colonialism with empathetic portraits of richly drawn characters in crisis. Sembene died in 2007, leaving behind a legacy matched by few directors. Come see where it all started.\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema. Students meet in the 2nd floor Multimedia room for an introductory lecture before the film and a guided discussion after the film. The film itself is shown in one of our theaters. Your ticket for the screening, as well as popcorn and a drink, are included with your registration. In addition, this film screening is open to the public, and you may purchase a regular ticket for the movie (seminar not included) online or at the box office.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Black Narcissus\n\nTaught by Jennifer Fleeger, Ph.D., Media and Communication Studies, Ursinus College\n\nAlthough it began as a novel, words can only gesture toward the glorious madness that is Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s Black Narcissus (1947). A story about nuns opening a convent in a converted brothel, of sorts, set high in the Himalayan mountains, the film’s meaning lies less in its plot (unsurprisingly, the nuns’ project is less than successful) than its imagery. Expressed in unnaturally vivid color with bold lighting schemes and shot very obviously using matte paintings at Pinewood Studios, this fantasy of nuns delusional with desire must be seen on a big screen and begs for further discussion.\n\nThis seminar will focus on the partnership between Powell and Pressburger, who worked together on two dozen pictures. The pair employed a regular team for many of the films produced by their company, The Archers, and a reading of their output will emphasize stylistic similarities while problematizing an auteurist perspective of film interpretation. We will detail The Archers’ contributions to British cinema and highlight its thematic interests. In films like The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann, as in this one, Powell and Pressburger use color, music, and close-ups to boldly represent women’s emotional lives, the excesses of which we will situate in melodrama.\n\nWe will also discuss the use of brownface in Black Narcissus and the orientalist lens directors have often used to represent India, considering how these negative stereotypes have shaped perceptions of the nation and interpretations of this film over time. Finally, we will talk about the contributions of Deborah Kerr, who plays Sister Clodagh in the film, pointing out how her stardom leads to particular expectations that the directors giddily undo as the film progresses.\n\nIn 1947, the Catholic Legion of Decency (the folks who helped bring you the Hollywood Production Code) called Black Narcissus, “a perverted specimen of bad taste.” Indeed, Powell and Pressburger revel in this combination of religion and sex. Seventy-five years later, the film still has the power to shock audiences and provoke us to question the value of “taste” in the creation of film art.\n\n[bit id=\"rc\"]\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Blade Runner (Spring 2015)\n\nTaught by Benjamin Eldon Stevens, Ph.D., Department of Classical Studies,\n\nBryn Mawr College\n\nFirst released in 1982, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner helped redefine the science fiction film by offering a vision of the future that remains influential to this day. In contrast to near-contemporary films like George Lucas's Star Wars or Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, both family-friendly epics released in 1977, Blade Runner offered a vision of a dystopic future—a world where advanced technology has failed to solve present-day problems like pollution and economic disparity, yet has succeeded in creating new ones. By focusing on working-class characters in a setting where the line between 'natural' and 'artificial' life is left deliberately unclear, the film leaves viewers wondering what it means for people to become only cogs—or perhaps, ghosts—in a machine.\n\nAdapted from Philip K. Dick's 1968 novella \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" in part through the astonishing cinematography of Jordan Cronenweth and breathtaking art direction of David L. Snyder, Blade Runner was at the forefront of a new sub-genre of science fiction: tech noir. Such movies are just as lurid and alluring, and just as dangerous and gorgeous, as any femme fatale. Join us to explore the film's vision and influence, which, over the past three decades, has hit a little too close to home.\n\nOne-night seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

In this seminar, we will explore the original classic as a conflicted meditation on postmodern notions of humanity. Cultural theorists and futurists have talked about the rise of “post-humanism” in an age of increasing fusion between ourselves and our technologies. Drawing on Philip K. Dick’s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the film elaborates on this theme of post-human identity with its notions of “replicants”—androids designed to look human and to be exploited for labor and military service. In asking whether and how the circle of our humanity and sentience ought to be extended to our biomechanical creations, Blade Runner remains an exemplar of dystopian filmmaking that echoes into our present moment.\n\nIt also remains a signal achievement in cinematic world-building. With a visual style emerging from music videos and advertising, Scott brought to the project a sensibility rooted in plausible imagination of a near-future Los Angeles—polyglot, multicultural, ravaged by environmental and industrial catastrophes, and corporatized to a dehumanizing extreme. Blade Runner is both a nightmarish vision of the future and a tableau whose beauty remains irresistible.\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

One day, he photographs a rendezvous between two lovers in a park; then, later, after developing the film, he begins to suspect that he has photographed a murder. Or has he?\n\nInspired by the 1959 short story “Las babas del diablo” (“The Devil's Drool”) by Julio Cortázar, Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow-Up (1966) is a mesmerizing work about voyeurism and perception that is a murder mystery, a view into “Swinging London”, and one of the greatest films ever made about watching and making movies. It was also an international box-office success and winner of the top prize at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival. Among the praise lavished upon the film, Arthur Knight wrote that Blow-Up would be “as important and seminal a film as Citizen Kane, Open City, and Hiroshima, Mon Amour—perhaps even more so.” Since its release, Blow-Up has influenced a number of directors, most notably among them Francis Ford Coppola and Brian De Palma, whose respective works, The Conversation and Blow-Out, are directly inspired by it. Join us to learn why the first English-language film by Antonioni (L'Avventura, Red Desert) has impacted generations of artists.\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

The director was in rare form when he made what many believe to be his most stunning and provocative achievement, Blue Velvet (1986), a riveting tour-de-force that, more than a quarter-century later, remains fresh and daring for its unflinching take on the nightmarish world that can lurk behind the white picket fences of suburban America.\n\nThis one-night seminar offers an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about one of the films from David Lynch's fascinating body of cinematic work. Students will receive a reading about the film, an introductory lecture before the film, and a guided discussion after the film. In addition, your ticket to see it on the big screen, as well as popcorn and a drink, are included.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Blue Velvet\n\nTaught by Lisa DeNight, Discussion Moderator, BMFI\n\nThe films of David Lynch, one of the most interesting, unusual, and influential directors to come out of the last half of the 20th century, consistently expose the surreality that lurks within the mundanity of everyday life. Lynch’s fourth feature film, Blue Velvet (1986), is his most famous—and infamous— exposé of idealized small-town Americana and the moral depravity beneath its veneer.\n\nThe story follows college student Jeffrey Beaumont (Lynch regular Kyle MacLachlan), whose discovery of a severed human ear in the grass draws him deep into a phantasmagoria of violence and psychosexual danger. Blue Velvet’s narrative is more linear than most of Lynch’s other films, but it is no less uncanny, due to his impeccable control of color, sound design, and direction of his actors. Starring alongside MacLachlan are Laura Dern, Isabella Rossellini, and an unforgettable Dennis Hopper. Building upon film noir and Hitchcockian themes such as voyeurism and obsession, Blue Velvet creates an original and frightening cinematic space situated between the deep, dark American id and our society’s façade of orderliness—a space in which viewers themselves are implicated by their own secrets.\n\nJoin us for a seminar that will dig deeper into the film director Guy Maddin described as “the last real earthquake to hit cinema.”\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie?

At times a playful period romp tracing the evolution and devolution of the California porn industry from the late 1970s through early 1980s, Boogie Nights is also a most unusual “family drama” about the creative families we choose and improvise, rather than those to which we are born.\n\nBoogie Nights is also a young filmmaker’s conscious homage to the cinematic forerunners who had inspired him. One can palpably sense traces of Martin Scorsese’s almost anthropological capacity to document outsider subcultures at the margins of respectability (think Goodfellas), as well as Robert Altman’s ensemble-driven commitment to the language and social posturing that animates any line of work (think Nashville). These narrative inspirations aside, Anderson finds his own distinctive voice by dancing elegantly between a full embrace of his subjects’ humanity and a detached, almost voyeuristic accounting of their working lives in an industry decidedly off the beaten path, yet fraught with personality dynamics and rivalries like any other.\n\nDepicting the absurdities and excesses of the so-called “Golden Age of Porn” alongside its genuine spirit of countercultural entrepreneurship, Anderson refuses the cheap tricks of caricature or condescension that would likely plague another take on the material. He fundamentally understands his fictionalized porn actors, directors, and producers—echoes as they are of real figures from the industry—as frustrated outsiders desperate to connect with like-minded souls who find American conventions of traditional family and gainful employment equally wanting. Anderson also recognizes in his characters, however self-deceiving and self-sabotaging at times, a charming, relatable aspiration to meaning, respect, and even artistry. Eschewing judgment of the porn industry per se, Anderson instead unfolds a strange yet poignant tale of how porn became corporatized during a particularly transitional era of American life at large, and how the film’s creative family is fractured and fragilely reconstituted with each dizzying change in the cultural landscape around it.\n\nFeaturing memorable ensemble work by Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, Alfred Molina, and 1970s icon Burt Reynolds, Boogie Nights remains as vibrant, humorous, and cautionary a tale as ever. One of the cautions being this: remember that every \"golden age\" is the flip side of a perilous fever dream, and every waking dream of non-conformity is an invitation to the harsh wake-up call provided by the commodification of even the edgiest desires.\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie?

Are you interested in learning more about a particular classic film? Do you want an entertaining, engaging, and comfortable way to spend a hot summer evening?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any of the questions above, then our Summer Classics Seminars are for you. This one focuses on Brief Encounter, David Lean's quietly poignant romance that is, in the words of The New York Times, \"presented in such a delicate and affecting way—and with such complete naturalness in characterization and fidelity to middle-class detail.\" Based on Noël Coward's 1936 one-act play, Still Life, and adapted for the screen by him, it stars Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard.\n\nJust like our regular courses, each class will offer students a reading about the film, an introductory lecture before the film, and a guided discussion after the film. In addition, your ticket to see the film on the big screen, as well as popcorn and a drink, are included.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Bringing Up Baby\n\nTaught by Jennifer Fleeger, Ph.D., Ursinus College\n\nA film about a paleontologist with a scrupulous attention to detail, an heiress without one, and a leopard named Baby is the perfect nexus of everything that made the screwball comedy popular during the 1930s. Known for their witty banter between the sexes and produced during an era of moral regulation, these films reveal tensions within the social, political, and economic forces in American society while being a great deal of fun. As philosopher Stanley Cavell put it, “At some point it becomes obvious that the surface of the dialogue and action of Bringing Up Baby… is more or less blatant and continuous double entendre.”\n\nThis seminar will trace the genre of the screwball comedy, noting its contribution to the representation of independent female characters and its value for women viewers, even as its narratives careen toward marriage. We'll look at the careers of Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn and the gossip underpinning their roles in this film. We'll explore why French critics were convinced director Howard Hawks was a genius despite the way his films almost haphazardly span multiple genres. Finally, we’ll get the story behind that leopard. At the heart of our discussion will be an appreciation for the script's use of humor to demand gender parity. As Hepburn’s character in the film cunningly asks of her co-star, “Is there anything in the world that doesn’t belong to you?”\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie?

Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nAlong with The Wild Bunch, also released in 1969, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid marked the beginning of the end of the western in Hollywood, as the once routinely produced, reliably bankable, and thoroughly crowd-pleasing genre entered the final, \"revisionist\" phase of its life.\n\nBut what a way to go! Despite the middling reviews it earned, the film was highly regarded within the industry, earning four Oscar nominations, and with audiences, who made it the highest-grossing western—and one of the most successful pictures—of all time. Certainly, some this popularity can be attributed to the inaugural pairing of two of Hollywood's biggest stars, as well as to the panache of William Goldman's exceptional screenplay and the beauty of Conrad Hall's cinematography, but there are other factors at play, too. Join us to explore the significance of the film to its industry, and the ways in which it created connections to a culture in transition.\n\nThese one-night seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema. Students receive an introductory lecture before the film and a guided discussion after the film. In addition, your ticket to see it on the big screen, as well as popcorn and a drink, are included.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (Summer 2019)\n\nTaught by Paul Wright, Ph.D., Department of English, Cabrini University\n\nIn Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), director George Roy Hill helped define a wave of revisionist, deconstructed westerns of the 1960s and 1970s. Ranging from Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch to Arthur Penn’s Little Big Man to Robert Altman’s McCabe and Mrs. Miller, such films embraced seemingly contradictory aims. Seeking both to demolish and reclaim the western as a genre and as the bearer of a distinctively American identity, these revisionist westerns took upon themselves the paradoxical task of deploying a deeply traditional—yet still fluid and adaptable—cinematic mode to more contemporary ends that reflected the turmoil of their times.\n\nPositioning itself as at once more grounded and more imaginative than its predecessors, Hill’s film occupies a special place in the larger story of the western as a uniquely American film genre that has continuously reinvented itself. In making a western to play to Woodstock-era audiences—who were increasingly alienated from the social mores and political ideas of their parents' generation—Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a \"buddy picture\" for an unfriendly world, where being an outlaw means accepting one’s fate as the quintessential loner exiled from conventional values. With a memorable screenplay by William Goldman and chemistry for the ages between leads Paul Newman and Robert Redford, this is a film worth revisiting in our own time of turmoil.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Cabaret\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nWillkommen to the Kit Kat Klub in the bleak heart of the Weimar Republic, with your host, the satanically seductive Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey), the exuberant singer-dancer and aspiring actress Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli), and the decadent partygoers of 1930s Berlin. Their story is told in Cabaret (1972), directed by Bob Fosse and loosely based on the 1966 Broadway musical by John Kander and Fred Ebb, which was inspired, in turn, by Christopher Isherwood’s novel Goodbye to Berlin (1939).\n\nOnly a few musical numbers from the stage production were used for the screen adaptation while new ones were written specifically for the film, and all but one of them take place inside the infamous Kit Kat Klub. Featuring such memorable songs as “Money, Money,” “Maybe This Time,” the chilling “Tomorrow Belongs to Me,” and the title track, Fosse's film depicts a milieu of corruption, sexual ambiguity, and decay in which the false dreams of individuals—and a nation—are soon shattered by the specter of Nazism.\n\nOpening to enthusiastic reviews and commercial success, Cabaret received eight Oscars (including Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor), and holds the record for the most Oscars earned by a film not honored for Best Picture (which went to The Godfather that year). Come, then, old chum, to the cabaret, and experience, in the words of Sally Bowles, the “divine decadence, darling” of a brilliant film musical.\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

In the case of Michael Curtiz's Casablanca (1942), we have a film shaped by the upheaval in both American cinema and in the war-torn world beyond the United States. In remembering a film that has been embraced as a star-crossed romance, and as the iconic Hollywood statement about love and loss, we too often forget how deeply political and provocative Casablanca really was—not only for its impact on American involvement in the global struggle against fascism, but also in its engagement with issues ranging from stateless refugees and immigration, to colonialism and the role of \"asymmetrical warfare\" in the anti-Nazi resistance movements of Europe. In this seminar, we will revisit Casablanca in an effort to feel once again its immediacy, both as an entertainment and as a document in the rhetorical battles that defined World War II nearly as much as bullets and bombs.\n\nThese one-night seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

Made in the era of the studio system, during which movies were churned out in something like assembly-line fashion, the film earned solid box office and garnered generally positive reviews from critics when it was released in January 1943. Indeed, director and film historian Peter Bogdanovich regards what he calls the most \"enduring cosmic lucky accident in picture history\" as \"the single favorite vindication of the studio system . . . because there is no other way Casablanca could have been made and worked as well.\"\n\nToday, it stands as a captivating portrait of America's reluctance to get involved in World War II, even if the bombing of Pearl Harbor had resolved our ambivalence by the time the film was made, and as a reminder that sometimes the problems of three little people do, after all, amount to more than a hill of beans in this crazy world.\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the exceptional works of world cinema.

Karasik, Film Producer, 30th Street Entertainment\n\nMany critics have described Casablanca (1942) as a film that comes as close to perfection as any in history. Attempts to recreate that perfection 'see Sydney Pollack's Havana (actually, don't)' or to 'improve' upon it (the film was infamously colorized by Ted Turner in the 1980s) have not only been poorly received by critics, but have enraged its fans the world over. As Roger Ebert often noted, there have been better films made than Casablanca, but no film is more loved than Casablanca. Even Pauline Kael 'a contrarian film critic if there ever was one' acknowledged that despite its perceived unoriginality, Casablanca has a special quality. '[It] is far from a great film,' she wrote in a review, 'but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism.'\n\nPerhaps part of that 'schlocky appeal' lies in what Casablanca does possibly better than any other movie: It tells a story, albeit one that is not particularly profound or remarkably unique. After all, as the lyrics of 'As Time Goes By' cannily remind us,'it's the same old story, a fight for love and glory.' While this revisiting of familiar narrative territory was standard practice in Hollywood, what director Michael Curtiz (The Adventures of Robin Hood, Yankee Doodle Dandy, Mildred Pierce) did better than most was stay out of the way of a fast-moving story. As Umberto Eco wrote, Casablanca 'unfolds with almost telluric force, the power of Narrative in its natural state, without Art intervening to discipline it.'\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

In this seminar, we’ll explore the narrative and stylistic choices that make Casablanca so engaging while also learning about its contribution to supporting America’s role in World War II. Casablanca epitomizes the classical Hollywood style, and a close study reveals how a simple storytelling formula is able to make such an emotional impact. We’ll examine how the dialogue and cinematography work together to make Bogart's Rick such a mysterious yet compelling character, how the film tugs at our desire to see him and Ilsa together, and how it reconciles us to their inevitable parting.\n\nCasablanca also offers a window into the precarious times of 1942, a year that ended with the Allies invading North Africa to wrest control of the region from the Nazi-aligned Vichy French government. The film allegorizes the role of the United States as a haven for refugees, celebrates American intervention in the war, and depicts diverse European characters uniting in opposition to the Nazis. Finally, we’ll study how the character of African-American piano player Sam was meant to demonstrate racial harmony and the impact he had on African-American audiences.

For starters, the movie features a winsome Jane Fonda in one of her earlier starring roles as Catherine Ballou, the prim and proper schoolteacher turned Wild West outlaw on the warpath for revenge. There's also the rousing theme song performed on-screen by the unforgettable Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye. But the showstopper is the legendary Lee Marvin as Kid Shelleen, the hard-drinking, crooked-shooting gunman hired by Cat to serve as a bodyguard against a villain played by . . . Lee Marvin!\n\nDirector Eliot Silverstein's comedic western, adapted from a more serious western novel by Roy Chanslor, did not reinvent the genre, offer deep philosophical insight into the human condition, or even take itself particularly seriously. The film did, however, pack audiences into theaters as one of the year's biggest box office hits, and netted the great Lee Marvin his only Oscar win for his dual role. It also changed the trajectory of his and Fonda's careers and inspired a cycle of western comedies in Hollywood. Big laughs, great music, (a modest) impact on the industry, and prime Fonda and Marvin join us for the whole shebang!\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the exceptional works of world cinema.

And yet, Welles was also very much cut from the same cloth as one of Shakespeare's greatest characters, Falstaff, the larger-than-life, charismatic, and yet deeply flawed creature of appetites whose presence hovers over the theatrical tradition since the time of the Bard. Similarly, Welles continues to call out to us like the ghost in the machine of Hollywood itself, reminding us of both Hollywood's potential to produce genuine art and the grinding mercilessness of Hollywood's commercial imperative—the very thing that haunted the entire career of Welles from Citizen Kane (1941) and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) on.\n\nIn this seminar, we will spend an evening with the Welles film that brought Shakespeare, Welles, and Falstaff into delirious collision: Chimes at Midnight (1965). An adaptation of material from Shakespeare's history plays and other sources on the life of King Henry V, Chimes at Midnight depicts how the price of power and leadership is often the rejection of youth and friendship. A study in mentorship and betrayal, Welles's film is both a worthy exploration of classic Shakespearean themes and a resonant commentary on his own career and image.\n\nOne-night seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

Self-financed at great expense, this film was an all-in bet on the enduring appeal of both silent cinema and the Little Tramp. Chaplin's gamble paid off handsomely, both for him and for generations of viewers as his virtuosic take on the simplest of premises (boy meets girl), and his deft juggling of pathos and slapstick have yet to be matched.\n\nThis one-night seminar offers an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about a true classic of world cinema.

It focuses on a beautiful young chanteuse named Cléo (Corrine Marchand) as she waits in turmoil to hear the potentially devastating results of a medical test. The structural conceit of the film is such that the viewer lives each moment in real time with Cléo on this particularly charged evening, as she walks the streets of Paris, meets friends, shops, and confronts her own mortality.\n\nVarda began her storied career as a photojournalist, and her talent as such is evident in the way she captures the bustling Parisian streetscapes with vivid detail and an eye for the unexpected. Deftly exploring female image and identity in society, Varda interrogates the divergence between public and private personas, making unique use of the mirror motif that would come to be associated with the French New Wave. Yet, for all its thematic sophistication, the film is an effortless delight to watch, featuring a score by Michel Legrand (who plays a small role in the film), and cameos by New Wave luminaries Jean-Luc Godard and Anna Karina. Join us to wander Paris with Cléo and discover the singular vision of Agnès Varda.\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

That evolution in genre standing arguably began with Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968, but it was in 1977 that some of the best examples of the genre emerged as box-office smashes, critical darlings, Awards contenders, and zeitgeist changers.\n\nLooming large in ’77, of course, was George Lucas’s Star Wars, but just as significant is Steven Spielberg’s more grounded effort, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Capitalizing on the UFO phenomenon of the early '70s, Spielberg’s film embraces the off-screen mystery of its subject in a way that Hitchcock might have appreciated. At the same time, the film retains a humanizing focus on relatable characterization, best exemplified by the existential wanderlust of its protagonist, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), whose obsession after his own close encounter fuels a quest to confirm the existence of intelligent life beyond earth.\n\nYet, Close Encounters is decidedly earthbound and interested in the most ordinary among us, asking what we might really be willing to sacrifice to confirm that “we are not alone,” as the film’s tagline put it. With Dreyfuss backed by Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, François Truffaut, and the Oscar-nominated Melinda Dillon, the emphasis of Close Encounters is never really on the dazzling effects of its UFOs; rather, it focuses on a nuanced depiction of how firsthand confirmation that UFOs exist might impact the human psyche, beset on all sides as it is by a host of mundane worries very much of this earth. By presenting a scenario wherein ordinary people contend with both a secretive government and the skepticism of their peers, Close Encounters is that rare piece of thoughtful sci-fi speculation about alien life that proudly wears its workaday humanity on its sleeve.\n\nWe will be screening Spielberg’s 1998 “Director’s Cut” of the film, which made some interesting course corrections from his 1980 “Special Edition,” a topic we will explore in relation to the film. Join us to examine the achievement and legacy of a cinematic milestone.\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie?

He absolutely hated the experience. Yet, despite its troubled production, Contempt (1963) is one of Godard’s most human, profound and self-critical cinematic creations, as well as one of his most visually sumptuous and conventionally accessible.\n\nIt is a loose adaptation of a 1954 Alberto Moravia novel about a screenwriter tasked with scripting a modern version of The Odyssey, a job during which his marriage begins to disintegrate. Beneath the surface of the plot, as in any Godard project, there are a multitude of readings, ideas, and emotions living between the frames. Godard wove in his own struggles with making the film and incisive commentary on the current state of cinema itself, heightened by his casting of iconic German director Fritz Lang (Metropolis), playing himself as the director of the film-within-the-film. Even more personally, Godard sublimated struggles with his wife, muse, and frequent star, Anna Karina, onto the film’s central couple, played by Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot.\n\nJoin us to explore this intimate meditation on filmmaking and the unmaking of a relationship—all in exuberant Cinemascope, courtesy of Godard’s frequent cinematographer, Raoul Coutard.\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie?

Poetic. Indelible. The films of Ingmar Bergman would come to define European art cinema and elevate the Swedish director to a position of prominence where he would eventually be recognized as one of the world's most important filmmakers.\n\nAs writer-director, Bergman produced dozens of films that explored the fundamental subjects of human existence: The quest for love and faith, the meaning of suffering and pain, the mystery of death, the solitary nature of being, the hell and paradise of marriage, and the struggle to find meaning in a seemingly random and capricious universe. For many, Bergman was the first to bring metaphysics—meditations on religion, death, existence—to the screen; but equally important was his ability to explore the psychology of women, and to examine the relationship between the sexes. His films, with few exceptions, are chamber pieces, paying careful attention to metaphoric detail and visual rhythm. Within this approach, his most expressive technique is his use of the facial close-up. For Bergman, the face (especially a woman's) and the hands are keys to revealing the innermost aspects of human emotion.\n\nAs such, Cries and Whispers is considered one of his greatest films, as it examines the interrelationships of four women brought together by death. The story focuses on Agnes, who has been ravaged by illness for twelve years, and attends to the last stages of her agony and death, and the days that follow. At her bedside are her sisters Maria (Liv Ullmann), \"the most beautiful one,\" Karin (Ingrid Thulin), \"the strongest one,\" and the family servant, Anna, \"the serving one.\" As the film moves among the three sisters and their servant, it summons episodes from the past, and as it does, uses time, mortality, and death as revelatory moments for all the characters—all underscored by Bergman's striking, pervasive use of the color red, which informs the overall mise-en-scene, providing further, rich insight into the lives of these characters.\n\nIn both structure and sensibility, then, Cries and Whispers creates a nineteenth-century world of melancholy that has been compared to Chekhov's The Three Sisters, Ibsen's A Doll House, and Bergman's favorite writer, August Strindberg. Join us as we experience this deeply powerful film and, with it, the cinema of a director once described as a \"poet with the camera.\"\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

The highest grossing foreign-language film in US history, it was nominated for ten Oscars (winning four) and picked up a wide range of honors here and abroad.\n\nWhile this might have been surprising, it was not accidental; Taiwanese-born and NYU-educated Ang Lee set out to make a film that would have appeal on both sides of the Pacific. He is at the peak of his powers here, demonstrating the directorial skill that has allowed him to build one of the most diverse bodies of work in recent memory: from indie favorites like The Wedding Banquet and Eat Drink Man Woman to Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility, from the suburban ennui of The Ice Storm, to the reimagined West of Brokeback Mountain—with a super-hero movie thrown in for good measure.\n\nThese films were made in collaboration with screenwriter/producer James Schamus, who describes Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as “Sense and Sensibility with martial arts.” The multiple storylines involve two experienced warriors with a special bond, a young woman looking for more than a high-class marriage, and a deadly assassin willing to break the rules of honor. Fight-master Michelle Yeoh (Everything Everywhere All at Once) shines here, as does Chow Yun-Fat, a star of top-shelf Hong Kong action flicks who had never made a martial arts picture before this one.\n\nWith the help of cutting-edge special effects, we end up with a wuxia movie that envelops us in historical China while also transcending genre—and even gravity—itself.\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie?

Over 25 years later, the film's poetic depiction of African American women’s history remains unique and timeless.\n\nSet in 1902, Daughters tells a multi-generational story of the Peazant family as they prepare to leave St. Helena Island, off the coast of South Carolina, for the mainland. The journey has economic, cultural, and spiritual ramifications for its characters, who are descendants of a slave culture known as Gullah Geechee. Those who stayed on the southern Sea Islands maintained many ties to African cultures that mainland slaves lost, including religious traditions, language, and family structures. The move to the mainland promises greater economic opportunity, but a potential loss of heritage.\n\nDash represents the diversity of life experiences in the extended family with a narrative structure more akin to choreography than conventional storytelling. Characters walk along the beach, climb in trees, and visit sacred places while sharing fragments of conversations and memories with each other and with us. Costumed primarily in flowing white gowns, with a variety of natural hair styles, the characters re-imagine screen images of black womanhood in a way that is still revolutionary today—and was an inspiration for Beyoncé’s visual album Lemonade. To watch this film is to experience history not as fact but sensation—one can almost feel the coastal wind and taste the food—and as something that lives in future generations.\n\nFollowing the seminar lecture, actress Alva Rogers will join us for a live, in-theater conversation with Dr. Amy Corbin before the screening.\n\nRead more about Daughters of the Dust in notes from the programmer's desk!\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

After a scuffle ends badly, a Chicago factory worker, Bill (Richard Gere), flees westward with his lover, Abby (Brooke Adams), who pass themselves off as siblings to find work. A pensive, prosperous farmer (Sam Shepard) hires them and falls for Abby, unwittingly forming a love triangle.\n\nWhile its plot is driven by romantic tension, Days of Heaven (1978) also explores the eternal conflict between man and nature, a theme that runs through much of the writer-director’s work. Known for his stunning depictions of the natural world, Malick’s second feature remains one of the most startlingly beautiful films ever made, with Oscar-winning cinematography by Néstor Almendros (Claire's Knee, Sophie's Choice).\n\nYet, the visual poetry on screen belies what was an arduous production process, after which the filmmaker took a two-decade break before completing his next film, The Thin Red Line (1998). Join us to experience the fruit of Malick’s labor, and explore Days of Heaven's metaphysical riches—or simply get lost in the shimmering waves of wheat.

When she joins forces with her husband's former mistress (the always formidable Simone Signoret) to turn the tables on him, this immaculately paced, cold-blooded puzzler leads to... well, we promised we wouldn't be devils. You'll just have to see for yourself.\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nJoin us to get the \"411\" on the film that began Alfred Hitchcock's vibrant, though short-lived, collaboration with Grace Kelly. Dial M for Murder was the only time the director worked in 3-D, yet even though only a portion of its 1954 audience saw it that way, Hitchcock still managed, in the words of Leonard Maltin, 'to squeeze every drop' of suspense out of Frederick Knott's popular stage play.\n\nThis one-night seminar offers an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about a true classic of world cinema. Students receive a reading about the film, an introductory lecture before the film, and a guided discussion after the film. In addition, your ticket to see it on the big screen, as well as popcorn and a drink, are included.\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Dial M for Murder (Summer 2018)\n\nTaught by Andrew Owen, Ph.D., Department of Sociology and Criminology, Cabrini University\n\nFrancois Truffaut claimed that he could watch Alfred Hitchcock’s Dial M for Murder (1954) over and over and enjoy it more each time. Adapted from Frederick Knott’s stage play, the film is an impartial examination of the immorality, duplicity and ultimately, criminality, which can thrive within the murky confines of the marriage pact. It is also the first of three films to benefit from the brief but sparkling collaboration between Hitchcock and Grace Kelly, who plays a wealthy socialite married to a vengeful cuckold (Ray Milland).\n\nOriginally shot in 3D, the film is a testament to Hitchcock’s particular ability to bring works created for the stage to the screen. The director transforms a seemingly comfortable apartment into a concentrated, claustrophobic environment rife with suppressed intensity, perfectly mimicking the characters’ veneers of civility and social convention, which they use to obscure the adulterous liaisons and ruthless blackmail that fester just beneath the surface. In so doing, Hitchcock, in the words of Leonard Maltin, “manages to squeeze every drop” of suspense out of this simmering “howdunit”.\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

Die Hard’s (1988) status as a Christmas film rests initially in its setting—an office Christmas party—then largely in its score, which turns Beethoven’s 9th symphony into a holiday tune.\n\nBut Die Hard’s ultimate success lies in the way it pits the wry humor of a New York cop (Bruce Willis) against the sly cleverness of a brilliant German criminal (Alan Rickman). Yet this battle of wits and weaponry is mere background for the film’s most important relationship: a friendship between two very different police officers—one from the West Coast, the other from the East; one black, the other white—who bond over the airwaves of a handheld radio. This seminar will focus on the “buddy film” as a Hollywood genre, which in the 1980s posited itself as a solution to racial conflict. It will also discuss the history of the American cinema’s representation of heroic masculinity and the domestic anxieties of the 1980s, all of which work together to make Die Hard not only a fabulously fun film, but also an insightful social commentary.\n\nAre you interested in “just” seeing this movie?

At times cheerfully fascist and at others oddly sensitive to the diversity of San Francisco, Dirty Harry is a time capsule of early ‘70s America and its conflicts about justice, morality, and public order.\n\nHarry is chasing Scorpio, a murderer loosely based on the Zodiac Killer, but in this film, he is explicitly connected to the hippies, with his flowy clothes and peace-sign belt buckle. Chillingly portrayed by then-newcomer Andrew Robinson, he represents every middle-American nightmare about “the kids these days.”\n\nIt seems unbelievable now that Eastwood was not the first choice for this role. As Harry Callahan, he embodies a hard-nosed morality on the city streets and gets assigned to all the dirty jobs that no one else wants. For better or worse, Harry makes these dirty jobs look good, and it’s hard to resist the satisfaction of the urban (frontier) justice he is doling out.\n\nDirector Don Siegel won an Oscar in 1946 for his debut film, the short “Star in the Night,” a modern take on the Nativity story. He went on to direct Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and a lot of television before hitting his stride in the late ‘60s as a director of westerns and police films, several of which starred Clint Eastwood. In Dirty Harry, director and star were perfectly matched, and they created the template for the catchphrase-spitting action stars that have thrilled audiences ever since.\n\n[bit id=\"rc\"]\n\nCinema Classics Seminar: Divorce Italian Style\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nInfidelity. Divorce. Murder: All the elements for a comedy? Yes, and a brilliant one at that. Divorce Italian Style (1962), directed by Pietro Germi, is a devastating satire about Sicily's male-dominated culture that also ridicules Italy's hypocritical judicial system, which could forgive violent crimes of passion but not divorce. Marcello Mastroianni is Fefe, a faded nobleman infatuated with his sixteen-year-old cousin, whom he intends to wed. But Fefe is already married, and since the Vatican doesn't condone divorce, he comes up with an ingenious plan—manipulate his wife into an affair with her former admirer, Carmelo, catch them in a compromising situation, and kill them in a burst of passion, which would free Fefe while only earning him a light prison sentence.\n\nBosley Crowther of The New York Times offered high praise when he wrote: \"Not since Charlie Chaplin's beguiling Verdoux have we seen a deliberate wife killer so elegant and suave, so condescending in his boredom, so thoroughly and pathetically enmeshed in the suffocating toils of a woman.\" Join us to learn why it's so deserved.\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the true classics of world cinema.

An ensemble comprised primarily of then-unknowns, including Giancarlo Esposito, Samuel L. Jackson, Martin Lawrence, Rosie Perez, John Turturro, and Lee himself, not only accentuates the you-are-there aesthetic of the film's most incendiary moments, but also humanizes the panoply of neighborhood characters, each of whom is essential to the film's engagement with matters of representation, authenticity, and methods of resistance. While this subject matter is a key ingredient of Lee's authorship, so are the film's bold aesthetics, like the inspired and aggressive direct-to-camera monologues.\n\nBut for all of Lee's innovation and experimentation, Do the Right Thing is also influenced by the American cinematic tradition, to which the writer-director-producer-actor was undoubtedly exposed during his time at NYU. This lineage is evident in his casting of Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee in small but pivotal roles, and in the homage to Night of the Hunter (1955) found in Radio Raheem's memorable monologue, which hints at the constant oscillation between love and hate at the film’s heart.\n\nJoin us to learn about and from the film of which Roger Ebert wrote: \"Spike Lee [did] an almost impossible thing. [He] made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants. He didn't draw lines or take sides but simply looked with sadness at one racial flashpoint that stood for many others.\"\n\nCinema Classics Seminars offer an entertaining and engaging way to learn more about some of the classics of world cinema.

There they meet two elderly women, one of whom claims to be clairvoyant and declares that their dead daughter is trying to communicate an impending danger. John dismisses these warnings but soon starts seeing strange visions himself.\n\nBased on a story by gothic writer Daphne du Maurier (author of Rebecca and “The Birds”), Don’t Look Now (1973) is hard to classify under one genre. Is it a drama, a horror story, or a psychological thriller? While the film deals with the occult and adopts some horror conventions, director Nicolas Roeg wanted to make “grief into the sole thrust of the film” in order to explore how “grief can separate people . . . Even the closest, healthiest relationship can come undone through grief.” To do so, Roeg uses editing to fracture time such that present, past, and future appear to converge in the film’s critical moments.\n\nIn this seminar, we will discuss adaptation by comparing the film to its source material while analyzing the techniques that make Don’t Look Now unforgettable: visual and aural divergence, aural match cuts, unsynchronized sound, montage images, and the surprisingly creepy use of the color red, which makes us wonder if we’re starting to see things, too.\n"
