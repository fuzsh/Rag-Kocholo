        "text": "Show tickets may be purchased only at the Observatory and only for that day’s shows. No online, phone, or advanced purchases are possible. Tickets are available at the main box office inside or at automated ticket machines around the building. Tickets may be purchased with either cash or credit cards (VISA, MasterCard, and Discover). We regret we are unable to accept personal, corporate, or organization checks (including those from public institutions). Above is the list of shows and show times and when tickets for each may be purchased.\n\n* Tickets for each show are sold until 10 minutes before the listed start time of that show, unless tickets have been sold out prior to that time. Once you have purchased planetarium tickets, there will be NO refunds (unless the show is canceled).\n\nThe shows in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium are not appropriate for children under five years of age. The content, visuals, and sound of the planetarium programs are likely to be disorienting and/or disturbing for such children. To ensure a satisfying experience for all our visitors, children under five years old are only admitted to the first show of each day we are open (12:45 p.m. on weekdays and 10:45 a.m. on weekend days).\n\nOnce you have your ticket, line up outside on the West Terrace at least 15 to 20 minutes before your show time. There will be building announcements as a reminder, but you are ultimately responsible for being on time. We cannot admit anyone late to the theater. Once the doors have closed, the show is underway and must not be interrupted. If you must leave the theater during the show, you cannot be readmitted.\n\nAll programs in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium are conducted by a live presenter in near-total darkness. The environment of the planetarium theater is specifically crafted to enable maximum visitor enjoyment of the show. As such, all visitors in the planetarium should refrain from any activities that would be disruptive to those around them (or to the presenter). Such activities include talking, yelling, making distracting noises, standing up, or using cell phones or other devices. We reserve the right to remove disruptive patrons from the theater at any time."
