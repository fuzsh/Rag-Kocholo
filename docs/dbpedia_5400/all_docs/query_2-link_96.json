        "text": "Team USA added 18 medals on Day 8\n\nThe USA added five gold medals, six silver medals and seven bronze medals to its tally at the Paris Games today, bringing its total medal count to 61 — still top among competing nations and groups.\n\nThe five golds were in gymnastics, swimming, shot-put and skeet shooting; the six silvers were in track and field, skeet shooting, tennis and swimming; and the seven bronze were in gymnastics, track and field, tennis, rowing and swimming.\n\nThe U.S. has 14 gold, 24 silver and 23 bronze medals, which puts it in second place when only gold medals are considered.\n\nChina leads in gold medals, having excelled in diving and shooting, and France and Australia follow the U.S., tied at 12 each.\n\nThirty-one medals were handed out today, and the U.S. got more than half, adding a total of 18 to its arsenal.\n\nKatie Ledecky reflects on 800-free history, looks ahead to L.A.\n\nKatie Ledecky sat down with Mike Tirico to discuss her historic performance at the 2024 Paris Olympics, where she once again cemented herself in the history books.\n\nLedecky said she knew her last race of these Games, the 800-meter freestyle, would be a tough one. The gold she won today is her fourth in the event, the same event that turned the global spotlight on her at the 2012 London Games when she was 15.\n\nShe becomes the first woman in history to win four Olympic golds in a single event — her favorite of all the recent stats shared about her enduring dominance.\n\n\"I think that's the one that means the most to me, I think probably the hardest of all those,\" she said. \"Obviously Michael Phelps is the only other swimmer that has ever done that so I think that just tells you how difficult that is.\"\n\nLedecky said her history with the event was also added pressure.\n\n\"I put more pressure on myself for that race to get the job done there,\" she said.\n\nWith 14 medals, more than any other female Olympian, Ledecky isn’t slowing down. She plans to compete in the 2028 L.A. Games.\n\nSnoop Dogg tries new food with Martha Stewart while fine dining in Paris\n\nSnoop Dogg and Martha Stewart enjoyed fine dining at a Michelin star restaurant, where the duo tried an assortment of food.\n\nStewart introduces Snoop Dogg to canapés, which he says he thought were \"Jell-o brand pudding.\"\n\nLater, Snoop Dogg said \"hell no\" when Stewart asked him to try escargot. She called him a \"wimp' when he refused.\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nTeam USA gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik won another bronze medal today. He’s shot to fame over the past week, becoming known as “pommel horse guy” and going viral for his Rubik’s cube skills and eyeglasses.\n\nNBC News’ Stephanie Gosk has more with the breakout star.\n\nU.S. stars team up for mixed medley relay gold and set a world record\n\nThe American dream team of Ryan Murphy, Nic Fink, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske combined to deliver a gold medal for Team USA in the mixed 4x100-meter medley relay in world-record time.\n\nIt was the first gold for Fink and Walsh. Huske swam her fastest-ever time to help clinch her second Olympic gold and bring the race home for the team.\n\n\"They set me up really well, and I'm going to be honest I wasn't losing, I wasn't going to let them down, I didn't want to let Team USA down,\" Huske told NBC after the race. \"They just got me so fired up.\"\n\nLedecky shares her golden Olympic moment with teammate\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nAfter winning the 800-meter freestyle, all-time swimming great medalist Ledecky shared her golden moment with Paige Madden.\n\nLedecky had her bronze-winning teammate join her on the top step during the medal ceremony. She had her arm around Madden, a now two-time medalist, as the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" was played and flag raised.\n\nKatie Ledecky wins 9th gold medal, most by American female Olympian in history\n\nKatie Ledecky cannot be stopped.\n\nLedecky won her ninth gold and 14th overall medal tonight, taking the 800-meter freestyle and concluding her fourth Olympic Games in style.\n\nShe became the most decorated female Olympic swimmer of all time Thursday when she won silver as part of the U.S. 4x200 freestyle relay team for her 13th career medal.\n\nBut that wasn’t enough for Ledecky, who defended her three-time title in the 800 free.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTaylor Swift: Katie Ledecky, Sha'Carri Richardson and Simone Biles 'never go out of style'\n\nTaylor Swift narrated a new hype video for three American Olympic icons who \"never go out of style.\"\n\n\"Never be afraid to show them who you are,\" Swift said in the video about Katie Ledecky, Sha'Carri Richardson and Simone Biles. \"Especially when the whole world is watching, because there's no one way to be the best.\"\n\nThe video highlighted clips of the three top Olympians, who are having anything but a cruel summer raking in medals for Team USA.\n\n\"Katie, Sha'Carri and Simone: Three American stars,\" Swift said. \"Three different visions of greatness.\"\n\n100-meter bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson reveals her two track idols\n\nand\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe rain didn't stop Melissa Jefferson from sprinting to an impressive bronze in the women's 100-meter final today, finishing just behind training partner Sha'Carri Richardson.\n\nThe 23-year-old American, making her Olympic debut, told reporters she felt \"grateful, happy, blessed\" after her win but remains focused on getting even better.\n\n\"I'm a baby in this sport,\" Jefferson said. \"I have a lot of learning and growth to do, so I feel like those moments where I'm not in first place or not on the podium, I can take those moments and learn from them.\"\n\nAs for her role models, she pointed to American track legends Sanya Richards-Ross and Allyson Felix. Both have multiple gold medals.\n\n\"Just the way they carry themselves,\" Jefferson said. \"For me personally, they molded and shaped the way.\"\n\nRichardson takes silver in 100, Julien Alfred wins first ever gold for Saint Lucia\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nSince qualifying for the Olympics in 2021 only to be barred from competing, Richardson had waited three years for the second chance that arrived today.\n\nSeparated, finally, from the Olympic gold medal she has long pursued by just 100 meters of a purple track this evening inside Stade de France, the American star coiled into the blocks amid falling rain and waited to reassert her title as the fastest woman in the world.\n\nYet right from the gun, Richardson was forced to play catch-up to Saint Lucia’s Julien Alfred, who left no doubt on her way to a gold medal in her Olympic debut in 10.72 seconds.

Engraved with the Paris 2024 emblem, it will be suspended in one of the cathedral’s bell towers to mark the games' legacy, planners hope, for generations to come.\n\nThe bell will resonate with the sound of 2024's special victories, like Bol's.\n\nJoe Kovacs on third shot put silver: 'I'm really proud of where the sport's going'\n\nand\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nIn Rio, Tokyo and now Paris, American Joe Kovacs has won the silver medal in men's shot put. This time he did it in the rain.\n\n\"That last-round throw was not a good technical throw, but it was a good emotional throw and I kind of found a way to make it happen,\" Kovacs told reporters after clinching the silver with his final attempt. \"I'm gonna be probably more proud of that as a silver medal than all my other ones before because being in fourth place in the last round is not somewhere you want to be.\"\n\nAfter the rain had started, the three competitors before Kovacs all fell on their last throws.

A U.S. loss would be damaging but not necessarily fatal.\n\nThe 2-4 Americans are tied with France and Poland for spots 5 through 7 of the pool, with the top six moving forward. The Americans, triumphant over France but losers to Poland, are tops in this trio — at this very moment — based on point-differential tiebreaker.\n\nThe Americans could win narrowly tomorrow but lose their point-differential edge — a highly unlikely scenario, but still possible. A loss to the Netherlands wouldn’t be helpful but if the Americans ended in a sixth-place tie with France, then the U.S. win over the hosts on Friday would be a ticket to the next round.\n\nGet all that?\n\nFrance plays eliminated China on Sunday while Poland takes on first-place Latvia, which has clinched No. 1 and might not have much incentive.\n\nFlips, tricks, and crashes: Best moments from BMX in Paris\n\nSee all the greatest moments from the Olympic BMX freestyle and racing events, including stylish tricks and brutal wipeouts.\n\nMen's basketball: End of the road for South Sudan, Serbia advances\n\nSouth Sudan has concluded an incredible first-ever Olympic run with a heart-pounding closer to the men's basketball group play.

Contributions came from up and down the roster, similar to the States’ first two wins of the Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. will play its first knockout game on Tuesday.\n\nSimone Biles keeps door open for L.A. 2028\n\nMany assumed that Simone Biles, who is widely considered the greatest gymnast of all time, would retire after the Paris Games.\n\nBut after winning her 10th Olympic medal on Saturday, she said this may not be her last Olympic experience.\n\n“Never say never,” Biles said. “The next Olympics is at home, so you just never know, but I am getting really old.”\n\nThe Games will be held in Los Angeles in 2028, the first domestic Summer Olympics since Atlanta 1996. If Biles competes in a fourth Olympics, she will be 31.\n\nJudo: Crowd in a frenzy as Teddy Riner fights for gold\n\nAfter fighting back from a 3-1 Japan lead, France has tied it up in the mixed team final. A wheel spin determined the heavyweight category for the final pairing in what seems like a fate-driven finale. The home crowd chants \"Teddy\" as their judo legend Teddy Riner holds their gold medal hopes in his hands.\n\nThe most dominant shot putter in history eyes a third straight Olympic gold medal — if his body holds up\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe best shot putter in track and field’s history spent this spring and summer experiencing something unusual: vulnerability.\n\nIt all started in March, when Ryan Crouser injured the ulnar nerve in his throwing elbow. The next month, while bench pressing, he tore a pectoral muscle.\n\nDoctors didn’t clear him to resume throwing the 16-pound metal shot until almost June. By late July, in his final warmup before the Paris Olympics, the Oregon native was beaten for the first time in nearly a year.\n\nWhen the 31-year-old American steps into the Stade de France ring in Saturday’s Olympic shot put final, it will be the ultimate test of a season he never would have predicted, one that has battered his body, if not his confidence.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nHere is your USA men’s basketball highlight of the day!\n\nAnthony Edwards is cooking vs. Puerto Rico, and seemingly to emphasize just how much he’s hooping, he threw down this filthy windmill dunk in the fourth quarter that had the entire U.S. team on its feet.\n\nBasketball: USA dominating through three quarters vs. Puerto Rico\n\nUSA has pushed its lead to 28, ahead of Puerto Rico 87-59 after three quarters.\n\nThe U.S. has four players in double figures in scoring, led by Anthony Edwards’s 19. LeBron James has 10 points, six rebounds and eight assists, and could probably get a triple double simply if he wants to.\n\nJose Alvarado has played admirably for Puerto Rico, scoring 18.\n\nPuerto Rico entered the game already eliminated from advancing, while the States were guaranteed a spot in the knockout stage.\n\nUSWNT coach Hayes defends decision to avoid subs until 90 mins\n\nAfter a hard-fought and at times ugly win over Japan, USWNT coach Emma Hayes responded to criticisms that her team looked tired by saying she believes they would have lost if she made too many substitutions.\n\n“I don’t believe we’d have gone through if we made too many changes,” she said when NBC News asked if her team was fatigued and needed freshening up sooner. Hayes, a veteran British coach appointed in November after 12 successful years at WSL team Chelsea, did not make any changes until extra time.\n\n“I haven’t had much time to work the whole squad; I’m still learning about everybody,” she said. “But the 11 that were there from the beginning did a fabulous job of sticking to” the game plan, “and the players that then came from the bench did their job.\"\n\n“It’s was completely the right decision,” she added of the strategy not to switch-up the team sooner. “I’m paid to do this job. So all I’m interested in is what we do in-house.”\n\nUSWNT's Rodman said she 'kind of blacked out' after winning goal\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nScoring the winning goal in an Olympic soccer quarter final “is the best moment in my career,” the USWNT’s Trinity Rodman told reporters after her stunning strike was the difference in a 1-0 win against Japan.\n\n“I kind of blacked out,” she said. “The last thing I remember was Crystal playing it over,” she said, referring to the assist by left full back Crystal Dunn, “and then I was just like, ‘Ahh! Ohh! Then once the game was over, that’s when I was like, oh, that’s what happened.”\n\nJapan presented a difficult opponent, with USWNT struggling to break their organized defensive block.\n\n“We tried all game long to get in the seams and get in between them but it wasn’t working,” Rodman said. Dunn “played it in behind, I think it a bobbled a bit, I did a little chop, and then bang — I couldn’t have asked for anything better and I’m very happy about it.”\n\nGymnastics: The luck of the Irish\n\nRhys McClenaghan just won Ireland their first Olympic gold medal in gymnastics, winning pommel horse gold with a 15.533.\n\nIt's been a long time coming for McClenaghan, who is a two-time world champion on the event and had a devastating error in Tokyo that left him off the podium.\n\nHis luck has changed in Paris. He can finally call himself an Olympic medalist, and a gold one too.\n\nGymnastics: Pommel horse podium\n\nRhys McClenaghan, Ireland, 15.533\n\nNariman Kurbanov, Kazakhstan, 15.433\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, United States, 15.300\n\nGymnastics: Stephen Nedoroscik wins pommel horse bronze\n\nNedoroscik will be the only U.S. male gymnast to medal individually in Paris, earning a bronze in his specialty, the pommel horse.\n\nHe scored a 15.300 with an even more intricate routine than the one that clinched Monday's historic team medal for the U.S. men.\n\nRead the full story here\n\n\"Mr. Pommel Horse\" lives up to his name\n\nAnyone who said Stephen Nedoroscik couldn't handle the pressure will have to eat their words.\n\nWith a medal on the line, he scored a 15.300 and currently holds bronze medal position. Nedoroscik seems pleased, giving the camera a thumbs up.\n\nBasketball: USA takes commanding lead over Puerto Rico\n\nAfter a hot start from Puerto Rico in the first quarter, USA restored order in the second.\n\nThe U.S. outscored its opponent by 23 points in the second, taking a 64-45 lead into halftime.\n\nAnthony Edwards has 12 points to lead the States. LeBron James has been the best player on the floor, though, racking up eight points, four rebounds and six assists.\n\nAfter making four threes in the first, Puerto Rico missed all nine of their attempts from deep in the second. Meanwhile, every USA starter has scored at least six points in a very balanced effort.\n\nGymnastics: Big task ahead for Stephen Nedoroscik\n\nRhys McClenaghan of Ireland just posted a 15.533 on the pommel horse. That will be a very tough number for Nedoroscik to match, but he's up next.\n\nGymnastics: Stephen 'Pommel Horse Guy' Nedoroscik meditates before gold medal opportunity\n\nStephen Nedoroscik could be seen meditating on the sidelines and finally, removing his trademark glasses before clinching a historic bronze medal for the U.S. men's gymnastics team Monday.\n\nAs he prepares to contend for a gold in today's final, he seems to be in zen mode again.\n\nCycling: Remco Evenepoel wins men's road race for second gold\n\nBelgian cyclist Remco Evenepoel has made history as the first male athlete to take gold in both the time trial and road race at the same Olympics. He won the road race by over a minute, outpacing France's Valentin Madouas and Christophe Laporte, who came in second and third.\n\nEvenepoel's celebration was immediately iconic, lifting his arms in victory with the Eiffel Tower as a backdrop.\n\nAt only 24, Evenepoel adds these two gold medals to his impressive list of cycling feats, which includes five World Championship medals.\n\nGymnastics: Reigning pommel horse champ dethroned\n\nTwo-time Olympic pommel horse gold medalist Max Whitlock of Great Britain won't be quite satisfied with that routine.\n\nHe had a significant form break, splitting his legs slightly and earning a 15.200. Whitlock is currently in second place and won't defend his title, but could still medal.\n\nBoxing: Algerian welterweight Imane Khelif wins again\n\nReporting from Villepinte, France\n\nAlgerian welterweight Imane Khelif beat Hungarian Anna Luca Hamori in a unanimous decision.\n\nKhelif appeared to have a sizable cheering section chanting her name, “Imane, Imane, Imane!” and waving Algerian flags.\n\nKhelif’s win follows her opening triumph against Angela Carini when the Italian pulled out seconds into the bout and later refused to shake the winner’s hand.\n\nWith Khelif's win today, she is guaranteed at least a bronze medal.\n\nBasketball: Puerto Rico leads USA after one quarter\n\nPuerto Rico is leading Team USA 30-25 after one quarter.\n\nIt’s an impressive display from Puerto Rico, which is shooting 4-of-7 from three. Jose Alvarado leads his team with nine points.\n\nJoel Embiid was back in the starting lineup for the U.S. on Saturday, scoring two points in the opening frame. Jayson Tatum leads the States with six points.\n\nThis game is effectively meaningless for both sides—the U.S. is already advancing to the knockout stage, while Puerto Rico cannot advance even with a win.\n\nFull time: USWNT beats Japan 1-0, advances to semi-finals\n\nIt was far from a convincing win, but they got there in the end. Trinity Rodman's extra-time goal gave the United States a 1-0 win over Japan, meaning they will face either Canada or Germany in the semi-final Tuesday.\n\nThough the U.S. dominated possession, they lacked quality in the final third and were mostly unable to breakdown Japan's disciplined defensive structure. It took a moment of magic from Rodman to break the impasse, controlling the ball on the right-side of the penalty area, cutting back to beat her defender and curling a sweet shot into the opposite corner.\n\nQuestions will be asked whether fatigue is a factor; the team has rarely changed up its starting line-up this tournament. And the first substitution today only came after 90 minutes.\n\nBiles, Andrade, Carey win vault medals\n\nSimone Biles, United States, 15.300\n\nRebeca Andrade, Brazil, 14.966\n\nJade Carey, United States, 14.466\n\nSimone Biles wins 10th Olympic medal on vault\n\nSimone Biles defeated Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade once again in the vault apparatus final today, winning her third gold medal of the Paris Olympics. It’s her 10th Olympic medal and seventh gold.\n\nBiles performed her iconic namesake vault, the Yurchenko double pike, or “Biles II\" for the last time in Paris. Her second vault was a “Cheng,” which features a half-turn onto the table, followed by a 1.5 twist into the air.\n\nGymnastics: Jade Carey rises from the ashes\n\nAfter a fluke tripping incident in Tokyo kept her out of the vault medals, Jade Carey will earn a podium finish in Paris.\n\nShe earned a 14.733 for her first vault, a Cheng, and a 14.200 for a double-twisting Yurchenko, giving her a 14.466 average.\n\nFirst half of extra time is up in the soccer: 15 minutes to go\n\nThat goal by Trinity Rodman came right at the end of the first half of extra time. The question is how it will affect the USWNT in this last part of the game.\n\nIt has not been a convincing performance so far, with the U.S. unable to convert their dominance in possession into enough clear-cut chances, while allowing Japan too many attempts on goal.A win is a win, and would put the U.S. through to face either Canada or Germany in the semi-final. But if it comes, it will not have been a pretty one. They will want to play a lot better next time if they hope to progress any further.\n\nRebeca Andrade gives Biles a run for her money\n\nBrazil's Rebeca Andrade did one of the best Cheng vaults the gymnastics world has ever seen, but it won't be enough to best Biles.\n\nAfter Andrade's near-perfect vault, Biles could be seen smiling and shaking her head in disbelief at her competitor's prowess on the skill. Andrade earned a massive 15.100 for the Cheng and a 14.833 for an equally beautiful Amanar, averaging a 14.966, below Biles' 15.3.\n\nAndrade opted not to debut the triple-twisting Yurchenko and instead did the 2.5 twist.\n\nArchery: South Korea's Lim Si-Hyeon wins third gold of Paris\n\nThe archery masters reign supreme once again. After South Korea swept the women's, men's and mixed team archery finals, expectations were high for the individual finals as well. And they did not disappoint, beginning with the women's event.\n\nIn her first Olympics, 21-year-old Lim Si-Hyeon won the individual women's gold, securing her third gold medal of the Games after the women's team and mixed team events. Hitting eleven perfect 10s, she beat out fellow South Korean Nam Suh-Yeon. In the ranking round of this event, Lim had set a world record of 694 points out of 720.\n\nFrance's Lisa Barbelin earned the bronze, defeating Jeon Hunyoung in a narrower match-up and becoming the first non-Korean archer to defeat a South Korean opponent in this Olympics.\n\nLim joins French swimmer Leon Marchand and Australian swimmer Mollie O'Callaghan in winning at least three gold medals so far at the Paris Games.\n\nThe men's individual event concludes tomorrow, with three South Koreans still in contention.\n\nSoccer: Swanson out, Williams in\n\nExtra time has now kicked off in the women's soccer quarter final and USWNT No. 9 Mallory Swanson has been replaced by No. 8 Lynn Williams, the team's first substitution.\n\nSimone Biles nails hardest vault in women's gymnastics\n\nBiles performed her iconic namesake vault, the Yurchenko double pike, or “Biles II” for the last time in Paris. It's the most difficult vault in the women's rulebook and today's landing was the best of the Paris Games, earning a 15.700.\n\nFor her second vault, she did a “Cheng,” or a half-turn onto the vaulting table, followed by a 1.5 twist into the air. That scored a 14.900, for a 15.300 average between the two vaults.\n\nShe is currently in first place by a wide margin, but Brazil's Rebeca Andrade and U.S. gymnast Jade Carey are still to come. They will be the other frontrunners for the podium.\n\nSoccer: 90 minutes gone and still no goals\n\nIt’s the end of normal time in the soccer quarter final between the United States and Japan. With the game still goalless we will play another 30 minutes, and, after that, penalties if there’s still no winner.\n\nIt was a frantic end to the 90 minutes, with goal-mouth scrambles at both ends. The USWNT had a penalty shout waved away by the referee, only for Japan to run down the other end and narrowly miss with an ambitious long-range lobbed effort over American ‘keeper Alyssa Naeher.\n\nTeam USA hasn't won an individual men's gymnastics medal since 2016\n\nThe U.S. men's gymnastics team last took home individual event medals in 2016. If Stephen Nederoscik does today what he came to do on pommel horse, he could end an eight-year drought.\n\nIn Rio, Danell Leyva won silver on the pommel horse and the high bar, and Alex Naddour won bronze on the pommel horse.\n\nAside from Nederoscik, no other men qualified for individual event finals in Paris.\n\nSoccer crowd getting restless\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nBoos and whistles fill the Parc des Princes as the USWNT pass the ball up and down its own defensive line. You can see why the American players are reluctant to get it forward too quickly; they don't seem to have the quality of final pass when up against Japan's low block.\n\nWith just over 75 minutes gone in this women's soccer quarter final, the second half as been much more even than the American-dominated first, with good chances at both ends.\n\nBoxing: Omari Jones punches ticket to welterweight semifinals\n\nReporting from Villepinte, France\n\nAmerican Omari Jones won his quarterfinal welterweight bout against Rami Mofid Kiwan, disposing of the taller Bulgarian southpaw by unanimous decision.\n\nThe Orlando, Florida native won each round on the cards of all five judges. He'll next fight on Tuesday.\n\nGymnastics: How do you win a vault medal?\n\nTo win an individual apparatus medal in vault, gymnasts must perform two vaults that have different entries onto the vaulting table. The two scores are averaged to determine the podium.\n\nSimone Biles is expected to performed her iconic namesake vault, the Yurchenko double pike, or “Biles II.” Her second vault is typically a “Cheng,” which features an additional half-turn onto the table, followed by a 1.5 twist into the air.\n\nVincent Hancock wins historic fourth gold medal as Team USA also take silver in men's skeet shooting\n\nTeam USA's Vincent Hancock has won his fourth Olympic gold medal in the men's skeet shooting, becoming just the sixth Olympian to win four golds in the same individual event.\n\nThe gold is Team USA's 10th of these Games. Team USA also took silver with Conner Prince, who is coached and mentored by Olympic veteran Hancock. With Hancock and Prince tied heading into the final four targets, Prince, shooting first, missed one of his four targets. With Hancock landing all four of his shots, he locked up the top spot on the podium.\n\nSkeet sees competitors shoot flying clay targets with shotguns. Hancock also won gold in the men's skeet in Beijing, London and Tokyo and now joins the likes of Michael Phelps and Carl Lewis in becoming a four-time Olympic champion in an individual event.\n\nKatie Ledecky has the opportunity to join Hancock in winning four individual gold medals in the same event tonight in the women's 800m freestyle final.\n\nGymnastics: New skill watch for Brazil’s Andrade\n\nLike Simone Biles and her eponymous vault, Brazil's Rebeca Andrade’s name could soon be in the rulebook.\n\nAndrade has been teasing a new vault that has never been performed by a female gymnast, a triple-twisting Yurchenko. If she performs it in today's vault final, it will bear her name in the Code of Points and help close her difficulty gap with Biles.\n\nShe would become the first woman to ever do the vault successfully in competition, though other gymnasts have attempted it before. It's a risky endeavor for a gymnast like Andrade that has suffered three ACL tears, but today's final will be her last chance.\n\nTennis: Fritz and Paul win bronze in men's doubles\n\nAfter Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram took silver in men's doubles, Team USA secured a double podium finish as Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul defeated Czech team Tomas Machac and Adam Pavlasek in straight sets.\n\nThe U.S. pairs had powerful runs, beating out Spanish superstars Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nGymnastics: Carlos Yulo takes floor gold, becoming first man to win Olympic gold for the Philippines\n\nNo man from the Philippines had never won an Olympic gold medal in any sport. Carlos Yulo, 24, outscored Israel's Artem Dolgopyat and Great Britain's Jake Jarman to win their first in the floor exercise apparatus final.\n\nBecause the Philippines did not qualify a team to the Olympics, Yulo is competing in Paris as an individual. Three former U.S. gymnasts switched national federations to represent the Philippines on the women's side, but were also competing as individuals and could not contend for a team medal.\n\nSoccer: Big chance for Japan\n\nThe second half is underway in this quarter final and the first big chance goes to Japan, who cut the ball back across the penalty box only for USWNT defender Crystal Dunn to clear behind for a corner.\n\nMore gold for Simone?\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nAfter claiming gold in the team and individual all-around competitions earlier this week, Simone Biles is eyeing the top spot on the podium in the vault competition today.\n\nIf she wins, she would become just the fourth U.S. woman to win at least seven gold medals and would join Czechoslovakia’s Vera Caslavska as the only women ever to win two vault gold medals. Caslavska did it in 1964 and 1968.\n\nBiles will face a familiar foe today in Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, who took gold in the vault at Tokyo and is the reigning world champion. Andrade took silver on Thursday in the individual all-around.\n\nA half of possession for USWNT, but no goals\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nHalf time in the women's soccer quarter final between USWNT and Japan, and it's still goalless at 0-0.\n\nThe Americans have had 78% of possession, but without anything to show for it beyond a few semi-decent shots. Meanwhile, Japan's two promising attempts on goal will remind U.S. coach Emma Hayes that this contest is still very much in the balance.\n\nCaeleb Dressel on his inner critic: 'Nothing is ever good enough'\n\nAfter winning five gold medals at Tokyo, Caeleb Dressel opened up about his struggles with being overly self-critical and how he has learned to develop a healthier relationship with the water.\n\nSo far at the Paris Games, Dressel helped win gold for Team USA in the 4x100m freestyle relay, but could not defend his gold in the 50m free and 100m butterfly. He will swim tomorrow to defend Team USA's gold in the men's 4x00m medley relay final.\n\nTrack: Kenny Bednarek posts top time in his 100m heat\n\nU.S. athlete Kenny Bednarek posted the top time of 9.96 in his 100m heat, immediately qualifying for the 100m semifinal. His run was relatively effortless, not needing to go that deep to outrun the other racers.\n\nBehind Bednarek were Cameroon's Emmanuel Eseme and Canada's Andre De Grasse, who also qualified for the semifinal having posted the other two fastest times.\n\nShots at either end in soccer\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nAfter really struggling for possession in this first half, Japan has just had two very promising shots in just as many minutes.\n\nFirst Mina Tanaka danced across the penalty box, only to prod a relatively tame shot at American goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. Then Miyabi Moriya latched onto to a chaotically bouncing ball in the penalty area, but her shot was high and wild.\n\nBefore that, USWNT had possibly its best chance of this quarter final, too, with Sophia Smith running onto a long ball after a flicked header from Lindsey Horan, but slicing her effort wide.\n\nAlmost 40 minutes gone here.\n\nGolf: Tommy Fleetwood takes the lead with Xander Schauffele off the pace in third round\n\nThe overnight leaders are through 11 holes in the third round of the men's golf, and it is currently Team GB's Tommy Fleetwood that is at the top of the leaderboard on 13-under-par.\n\nFleetwood, who won the 2017 French Open at Le Golf National, was tied for the lead coming into the day with Team USA's Xander Schauffele and Hideki Matsuyama of Japan. Fleetwood though has broken the tie, he is two-under for the round so far with Schauffele even-par. Matsuyama is one-over for the day.\n\nDenmark's Nikolai Hojgaard has been the flier of the day, moving himself into medal contention with a brilliant round of nine-under-par. He currently sits on 11-under - the same score as Schauffele.\n\nSpain's Jon Rahm is also having a good day on the course. He is three-under for the day through 11 holes and currently sits one shot behind Fleetwood. Rory McIlroy has also moved into medal contention - he is five-under for the day and sits on 10-under overall through 15 holes in this third round.\n\nA track designed to break records\n\nYesterday's brakeneck 10,000m race stunned the Stade de France as the top 13 finishers all beat the previous Olympic record, with Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei coming out on top.\n\nIt was a stunning race full of athletes at the top of their game, but this is also a track designed to break records.\n\nItalian company Mondo has provided the track at every Summer Games since 1976, and this time they’ve gone back to the drawing board with records in mind, with a track engineered to produce fast times.\n\nIt took 10 weeks to install in the Stade de France, but Mondo says the track is its fastest yet, and 2% faster than Tokyo’s.\n\nThe women’s 200-meter world record, which has stood since 1988, could be under threat. Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson set the second fastest time ever in 2023, and may fancy her chances on Paris' purple track.\n\nVincent Hancock aiming to make history in skeet shooting final\n\nTeam USA's Vincent Hancock is aiming to make Olympic history in the men's skeet shooting final shortly — he is aiming to become just the sixth Olympian to win four gold medals in the same individual event.\n\nHancock, a gold medalist in the skeet in Beijing, London and Tokyo, is aiming to join Al Oerter, Paul Elvstrom, Carl Lewis, Michael Phelps and Mijain Lopez in achieving that incredible feat. Katie Ledecky also has the chance to win a fourth Olympic gold medal tonight in the 800-meter freestyle.\n\nFellow American Conner Prince has also qualified for the skeet final. The final gets underway imminently.\n\nWhy is Hungary so good at water polo?\n\nThe men's and women's water polo starts today in Paris, with Hungary's legendary men's team among the favorites to take home a gold.\n\nIn fact, the Hungarian men's team are gunning for their tenth Olympic gold medal in the event. Already on nine, they have won more than twice as many as the next most successful country.\n\nThe landlocked nation owes its peculiar dominance in the pool to its 1,300 thermal springs. The warm water allows Hungarians to practice for longer periods during the year, while they have fostered an aquatic culture in the eastern European nation.\n\nThey were also early innovators in the sport, which helped them toward a 110-match winning streak between 1928 and 1939, a run that included gold at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nBut since their last gold in 2008, they've suffered a relative drought. After failing to finish on the podium in either 2012 and 2016, the men only managed Bronze in Tokyo.\n\nWill Paris see a return to form for the legendary side?\n\nAmerican soccer dominance, but not much to show for it\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe first 15 minutes are up in the women's soccer quarter final between USWNT and Japan. And although the Americans have been utterly dominant — enjoying 89% of possession so far — they've only had one shot on target.\n\nJapan hasn't been able to get near the neat triangles conducted by Rose Lavelle and Lindsey Horan in the midfield. But when it comes to the final third, the U.S. just hasn't had the quality needed to break the Japanese defensive lines.\n\nSimone Biles and Jade Carey are up on the vault final\n\nSimone Biles and Jade Carey are among the top eight vaulters in the world. Today, they will each prove if they are top three material.\n\nBiles is coming out of qualifiers with a massive 15.300 on the event, which is often considered her best. She even has two skills on the vault named after her.\n\nCarey was in third after qualifiers, posting a 14.433 despite struggling with illness that day. She placed eighth in the vault final in Tokyo.\n\nHuge vaults from Biles and Carey on Tuesday helped Team USA bring home a gold medal in the team final.\n\nTheir biggest competition today will come from Brazilian powerhouse Rebeca Andrade. She sits in second place after qualifiers with a 14.683.\n\nEach of the eight vaulters will perform two vaults from two different families. Their scores will be averaged to produce a final result.\n\nWill Simone Biles perform the Biles I and II?\n\nSimone Biles is expected to compete in the vault later today, where she may also perform at least one of the moves named after her in the sport.\n\nAt the 2018 world championships, Biles debuted the Biles vault I, a roundoff, back handspring with half turn entry, front stretched somersault with two twists.\n\nSix years later, she is still the only woman who has performed Biles I, but it is only the second-most difficult in vault in women’s artistic gymnastics, after the Biles II.\n\nThe Biles II, a round-off back handspring with two backward flips in pike position, is the most dazzling and daring move in the sport. Biles drew a standing ovation after she performed the move at the U.S. Olympic trials in July, and may try it again during today’s event.\n\nBiles also has moves named after her in the floor exercise and balance beam events.\n\nSoccer: American women will hope the goals keep coming\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nOn a hot scoring spree, the United States Women’s National Team will face Japan later today in the women’s soccer quarter final.\n\nThe USWNT bagged a record nine goals while winning all three of its matches to top group B. Japan was runner up in Group C.\n\nThe game kicks off at 3 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET).\n\nIf the U.S. triumphs, it will play the winner of the quarter final between Canada and Germany, which is being played at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nThe ancient origins of pommel horse and triple jump\n\nThe men’s pommel horse event has attracted all sorts of attention in Paris thanks to Team USA’s Stephen Nedoroscik, who helped seal the bronze medal in the team all-around on Thursday.\n\nThe peculiar apparatus has since become a talking point, but its origins date way back to the ancient Olympics and the stables of Rome.\n\nThe pommel horse descends from a wooden horse used by the Romans to teach mounting and dismounting. Pommel horse featured in the ancient Olympics and was among the events at the first modern Olympics in 1896.\n\nThe women’s triple jump final, which takes place this evening, is also thought to be related to the eternal children’s game of hopscotch. However, there is no evidence that it was used in the ancient Olympics.\n\nSilver for Team USA in men's tennis doubles\n\nTeam USA has taken home silver in the men's tennis doubles after coming up short in an enthralling contest against Australia.\n\nThe American pair, Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram, played three tiebreaks in a closely fought contest but couldn't quite get it over the line against Matthew Ebden and John Peers, who won gold.Krajicek and Ram started well, taking the first set and breaking their opponents' serve in the second. However, the Australians broke back and had the momentum thereafter, winning the deciding tiebreak 10-8.\n\nTeam USA facing first Olympics without a male individual swimming gold since 1900\n\nSo far it has been an Olympics to forget for the American men in the pool — they have zero individual swimming gold medals so far and there is only one more chance to end that drought.\n\nThat will come down to Bobby Finke tomorrow night.\n\nFinke qualified with the sixth fastest time this morning in the 1500-meter freestyle final. He is the defending Olympic champion and is set to face a stern test this time from reigning world champion Daniel Wiffen of Ireland. Wiffen has already claimed gold in the 800-meter freestyle in these Games.\n\nIf Finke doesn't claim gold tomorrow, it will be the first Olympics in which American male swimmers have failed to claim an individual gold medal since the 1900 Games.\n\nAustralia draws level with Team USA in thrilling tennis final\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nIn this topsy-turvy tennis match, we are somehow all square after Australia comprehensively beat Team USA by 7 points to 1 in the second set tiebreak.\n\nThat means it’s one set each, which will now force a special 10-point tiebreaker instead of the third set. The winner of that gets the match — and gold.\n\nImpossible to separate Team USA and Australia in tennis\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nIt could not be any closer here at Roland Garros. After the first set ended in a tiebreak, the second one has, too!\n\nIf Team USA wins the tiebreak, they get gold. If Australia gets it, we’re all square and go to another (yes another) 10-point tiebreak to decide the match.\n\nIOC President says online abuse 'unacceptable' amid women's boxing dispute\n\nInternational Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach has responded to questions surrounding the gender dispute over Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting and Imane Khelif of Algeria.\n\nBoth athletes failed to meet gender eligibility tests at the Women’s World Boxing Championships in New Delhi last year, but they were cleared to compete in Paris by the IOC, and have also always competed in women's divisions.\n\n\"We have two boxers who were born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman, and who have competed for many years as women,\" said Bach.\n\n\"There was never any doubt about them being women.\"\n\nKhelif's win over Italy's Angela Carini Thursday provoked massive criticism online, including from prominent figures such as Elon Musk and J.K. Rowling.\n\n\"What we see now is that some want to own the definition of who is a woman,\" added Bach.\n\n\"All this hate speech, aggression and abuse...is totally unacceptable.\"\n\nAustralia gains advantage in men's tennis doubles\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe Australian pair are showing some real grit here, with the match beginning to look like a fait accompli. Instead, they now lead in the second set 5-4, with every chance of drawing level with the U.S. if they win this set at the gold medal match.\n\nThe crowd is responding with some real noise now and the Australian players are loving that, gesturing for them to keep it coming.\n\nModels of boats donated for answered prayers hang in Marseille basilica as sailing events begin\n\nand\n\nThe first sailing medals are up for grabs today as the women’s and men’s windsurfing events take place in Marseille.\n\nThe city is inextricably linked to its seafaring city, a reverence shown by the votive offerings that sit in its basilica of Notre Dame de la Garde.\n\nLittle model boats hang from its ceiling and maritime paintings adorn its walls. These are votive offerings, some more than 200 year old that residents of this Mediterranean port city continue to bring in gratitude to the Virgin Mary for everything from avoiding shipwrecks to successful rescues of migrants trying to make it to Europe on unseaworthy boats.\n\nAbout once a month someone brings a new one — sometimes with an explanation, sometimes anonymously, most handmade.\n\nA fresh set of Olympic medalists may have offerings of their own by the end of the day.\n\nSouth Sudan’s Lucia Moris falls during women’s 100m heat\n\nLucia Moris of South Sudan fell during a women’s 100m heat at Stade de France and was unable to finish.\n\nSnoop Dogg? Nah, say hello to Snoop Horse\n\nSnoop Dogg is having the time of his life at the Olympics. Today he is enjoying the dressage at the Chateau de Versailles, and he has come kitted out with full horse riding gear, helmet and all!\n\nHuge break of serve by Team USA in tennis\n\nAustin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram have just broken the serve of their Australian opponents in the men's doubles tennis final. Having already won the first set, that could be a huge moment in this final; if they can just hold their service games, they will win gold. They are up 3-1 in the second set.\n\nTrack: Noah Lyles sends warning shot to his rivals\n\nFresh from a second-place finish in his 100-meter heat, Team USA's Noah Lyles has warned his rivals he is even more pumped up now that his quest for Olympic gold is underway.\n\nLyles progressed to the semifinals in a time of 10.04s after making up for a sluggish start off the starting blocks. It was more than enough to see him safely through to tomorrow night's semifinals, and Lyles says the complacency that affected him in the heats will not be on display tomorrow night.\n\n\"I didn't put enough emphasis on the acceleration, this time it just kind of got away from me,\" Lyles reflected after his heat. \"I'm not going to lie, I downplayed my competitors. But don't worry, that won't happen again.\"\n\n“To be honest, I think I’m more excited now that I didn’t win that heat. I’m pretty scared for everyone else right now.”\n\nWhen Lyles made his Olympic debut in Tokyo in 2021, he admitted that the lack of crowds at the Games really got to him, describing his bronze medal win as \"boring.\" Around those Games, he also opened up about his struggles with his mental health, particularly perpetuated by the ongoing Covid pandemic and the pressures of life as a black American following the murder of George Floyd.\n\nSince then, Lyles has become a global star, winning both the 100-meter and 200-meter titles at last year's World Championships in Budapest - the first athlete to sweep those titles since Usain Bolt. Last month, \"Sprint,\" a behind-the-scenes Netflix documentary focusing on the fastest humans on the planet, premiered with Lyles as one of its main stars.\n\n\"It's a lot more exciting, it's way different,\" Lyles said about competing in front of the packed-out Stade de France. \"'Sprint' came out. I now walk around and everyone knows who I am. It's a completely different environment so I'm just getting acclimated to that. I'm going in step-by-step saying hey, let's just have some fun.\"\n\nTeam USA clinches hard-fought opening set in men's tennis doubles\n\nAfter a dramatic, rollercoaster tiebreak, Team USA has won the first set against Australia in the men's tennis doubles final. Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram took the set 7-6 against Matthew Ebden and John Peers.\n\nBoth teams broke each other's serve during the start of the set, but every time the United States looked like pulling away, the Australians somehow clawed it back. The U.S. finally won the tiebreak 8-6 on points.\n\nBadminton spectator dragged from arena for holding up Taiwan banner\n\nTaiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned the removal of a spectator from the badminton venue at the Paris Olympics for holding up a green banner reading “Taiwan go for it” during competition on Friday.\n\nTaiwan competes at the Olympics as Chinese Taipei to avoid objections from China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own territory. Taiwan’s government rejects Chinese sovereignty claims.\n\nTwo Reuters journalists saw the spectator being bodily removed up a staircase, shouting, while Taiwanese shuttler Chou Tien Chen was playing.\n\n“This violent act is not only ill educated but also seriously violates the spirit of civilization represented by the Olympic Games,” Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday. “It is even more contrary to the rule of law and infringes on freedom of expression.”\n\nTeam USA in tennis doubles tiebreak\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThere's not much separating Team USA and Australia at the men's tennis doubles final, which has gone to a tiebreak in the first set.\n\nThere have been some thrilling rallies on the clay at Roland Garros, but only one team can come away with the spoils.\n\nEarly crowd banter in the men's doubles tennis final\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nPlay is under way here at Roland-Garros where Team USA’s Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram are playing Australia’s Matthew Ebden and John Peers for a gold medal in the men’s tennis doubles.\n\nIn the first game someone got a “USA! USA! USA!” chant going. And now an Australian fan has piped up with “Aussie! Aussie Aussie!” to which someone on the other side of the ground responded “oi! oi! oi!”\n\nAnother supporter has just yelled over the pre-serve silence, “Do you want to marry me?” Perhaps that was a reference to the iconic moment at Wimbledon in 1996, when Germany's Steffi Graf was asked by a supporter, “Steffi, will you marry me?” She famously responded, “How much money do you have?”\n\nAdding to the good vibes, the in-house brass band has struck up a rendition of the Addams Family theme tune.\n\nNoah Lyles second in heat, progresses to tomorrow's semifinals\n\nTeam USA's Noah Lyles is safely through to tomorrow's 100-meter semifinals after finishing second in his heat to get his bid to win four gold medals underway.\n\nA little slow off the blocks, Lyles, the reigning 100-meter and 200-meter world champion, posted a time of 10.04 seconds. Of course, we won't see the really fast times until tomorrow with the medal favorites mostly conserving their energy in the heats.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson, widely seen as Lyles' main rival for gold, strolled over the line in 10.00 seconds to win his heat, having eased off considerably after the first 50m.\n\nBoth the semifinals and the final will take place tomorrow evening at the Stade de France.\n\nTeam Great Britain Azu disqualified from 100m after false start\n\nHeartbreak for Team GB athlete Jeremiah Azu, who was disqualified from the 100-meter after a false start ahead of his heat.\n\nThe Brit reacted to the gun in 0.073 seconds, breaking the accepted reaction time of 0.10 seconds. Azu pleaded his case but was escorted from the track, his Olympic dream over for another four years.\n\nAzu is the only Welshman in history to have run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds.\n\nThe race was eventually won by Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.\n\nSnoop Dogg sports a robe for his greatest hits of Week 1\n\nSnoop Dogg styles on Mike Tirico in a custom Olympics robe to show off his greatest hits from Week 1, including a lowkey shooter, dancing LeBron, and of course Snoop’s favorite, Bob the cap catcher.\n\nTennis: Team USA hoping for double podium in men's doubles\n\nTeam USA are guaranteed a medal in the men's doubles with Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram due to take to the courts of Roland-Garros shortly for the gold medal match.\n\nRam, who won silver with Venus Williams in the mixed doubles in 2016, and Krajicek have won all their matches en route to the final in straight sets, including a 6-2, 6-4 quarterfinal win against Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz to end the 'Nadalcaraz' dream. They now face Australia's duo Matthew Ebden and John Peers for gold starting at 6:00 a.m. ET.\n\nAt 40 years old, Ram will become the oldest player to win an Olympic medal in tennis since 1920.\n\nThe U.S. could double up in this event — Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul are in the bronze medal match. They face Czech pair Tomas Machac and Adam Pavlasek later today for the final spot on the podium.\n\nRowing: Team USA takes bronze in men's eight\n\nTeam USA has won bronze in the rowing men's eight, earning the U.S.'s first medal of the day.\n\nIt is Team USA's second medal in the rowing regatta after the men's four took gold on Thursday. The U.S. failed to earn a single medal in rowing in Tokyo.\n\nGreat Britain charged ahead in the final 500m to take gold ahead of the Netherlands.\n\nIn the women's event earlier this morning, the Team USA crew faded towards the end, eventually finishing 5th.\n\nFather of Algerian boxer caught in Olympics gender dispute calls it ‘immoral’ and ‘unfair’\n\nand\n\nAmar Khelif, father of Algerian boxer Imane Khelif who remains embroiled in a dispute over her gender, has slammed the debate surrounding his daughter and paid tribute to his \"honourable\" daughter.\n\nImane Khelif’s win over Italy’s Angela Carini on Thursday sparked global outrage after reports resurfaced that she failed to meet gender eligibility tests at the Women’s World Boxing Championships in New Delhi last year.\n\nBut there is there is no indication that Khelif identifies as transgender or intersex, and she has always competed in women’s events, including at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n“Having such a daughter is honorable because she is a champion,” he told Reuters. “The attacks against her are immoral, it is not fair, Imane is a little girl that has loved sport since she was 6 years old.”\n\n“These critics aim to destabilize her to fail in the wrestling ring but she is a champion and she will remain a champion and I hope she will win the gold medal and make us happy, she is our role model not only here at the club but the role model for Algerian boxing.”\n\nThe 'fastest man in the world?' The pressure is on Noah Lyles to prove it\n\n“What’s up, Team USA? This is Noah Lyles, fastest man in the world.”\n\nThat is the bold claim Noah Lyles made in a video posted to Team USA's X account during the opening ceremony, and it's a statement that has many athletics fans around the world riled up and waiting to see if he can back it up.\n\nThe 27-year-old has never been short of confidence; after all, he is the reigning 100m and 200m world champion, titles that the Gainsville native says give him the right to the fastest man in the world title.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson may have something to say about that. Both Thompson and Lyles have run personal bests this year in the 100m, but Thompson's was faster - 9.77 against Lyles' 9.81. Kenya’s Ferdinand Omanyala has also gone quicker than Lyles in 2024.\n\nEven so, Lyles is adamant he is the fastest man in the world, and now the time has come for him to prove it. \"It’s me,\" Lyles said while laughing, doubling down on his fastest-man claim during a Team USA press conference this week. “It’s always going to be me.”\n\nLyles goes in the first heats of the 100m this morning at 5:55 a.m. ET ahead of tomorrow's final.\n\nMedal race heating up in men's golf at halfway stage with Team USA's Xander Schauffele in three-way tie\n\nTeam USA's Xander Schauffele begins the third round of the men's golf event in a three-way tie at the top of the leaderboard as the race for the medals gets serious.\n\nSchauffele, on 11-under-par, is tied with Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and Great Britain's Tommy Fleetwood at the halfway point of the competition, with the third round now underway.\n\nThe leading trio will be the last to tee off at 6:39 a.m. ET at Le Golf National.
