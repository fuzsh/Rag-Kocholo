        "text": "Considering that I’m a lifelong Disney nerd, I’ve been pretty terrible at catching most of their recent films. I still haven’t seen Tangled (2010, The Princess and the Frog (2009) nor have I seen Frozen (2013) (shocking I know). But when I saw the previews for Moana, I was determined that at the very least I would see THIS one, and boy oh boy, I’m glad I did. Moana is the first Polynesian Disney Princess and the youngest Disney Princess since Snow White. She is also the first Disney Princess to have no romantic sub-plot in her film whatsoever (which is fine with me).\n\nFrom the moment I first watched this film in theaters, I fell in love with the soundtrack, which features songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda (you know, of Hamilton fame) among others. And the first big song in the film is “Where You Are” which establishes daily life on the island of Motunui. Moana is (at the time) the toddler daughter of Chief Tui and Sina, and in a surreal encounter with the living presence of the ocean, is chosen to someday return the stolen heart of Te Fiti. Unaware of this, her well-meaning parents determine to do their best to raise Moana in such a way that she’ll never want to leave the island. This is the subject of “Where You Are.”\n\n“Consider the coconut…” One of my favorite lines in the song\n\nMoana, make way, make way\n\nMoana, it’s time you knew\n\nThe village of Motonui is all you need\n\nThe dancers are practicing\n\nThey dance to an ancient song\n\n(Who needs a new song? This old one’s all we need)\n\nThis tradition is our mission\n\nAnd Moana, there’s so much to do (Make way)\n\nDon’t trip on the taro root, that’s all you need\n\nWe share everything we make (We make)\n\nWe joke and we weave our baskets (Aha!)\n\nThe fishermen come back from the sea\n\nIn this song, Tui and the others describe how the island provides everything they need for life: coconuts, fish from the lagoon, palm fronds to weave baskets and other materials, and “no one leaves.” The tone of the song is so happy that you almost don’t realize at first that the sentiment of no one EVER leaving is repeated multiple times. But Moana DOES want to leave, or at least, she wants to explore the ocean. But time and time again, her parents are there to head her off and push her back to the island’s interior, where, as she grows into a teenager, she is prepared to take her place as a young chief on the island.\n\nMoana doesn’t seem particularly thrilled with this, but then she has an encounter with Grandmother Tala (Tui’s mother), who loves the ocean as much as Moana does, and together the two dance like the waves.\n\nI like to dance with the water\n\nThe undertow and the waves\n\nThe water is mischievous, ha!\n\nI like how it misbehaves\n\nThe village may think I’m crazy\n\nOr say that I drift too far\n\nBut once you know what you like, well, there you are\n\nYou are your father’s daughter\n\nStubbornness and pride\n\nMind what he says but remember\n\nYou may hear a voice inside\n\nAnd if the voice starts to whisper\n\nTo follow the farthest star\n\nMoana, that voice inside is who you are\n\nAs time passes, Moana begins to finally accept that, while she does love the ocean, she can be happy on Motunui, she doesn’t have to leave, everything she needs is right here “where you are.” And you almost believe her, except for the side glances she still sends over to where Grandmother Tala is still dancing.\n\nI still believe that Moana is one of the few Disney Princesses who is mostly content to remain in their situation for the good of the family (contrast her attitude by the end of “Where You Are” with, say, Mulan, Ariel or Belle).\n\nSo here I’ll stay\n\nMy home, my people beside me\n\nAnd when I think of tomorrow\n\nThere we are\n\nI’ll lead the way\n\nI’ll have my people to guide me\n\nWe’ll build our future together\n\nAnd maybe if things had stayed in the status quo, she really would have been happy. But of course, this is a Disney movie, things NEVER stay in the status quo for very long.\n\nI feel like I haven’t done a Disney series in ages, so I’m happy to finally be starting up again with Moana.
