Enjoyable

What made the experience of listening to Beyond the Farthest Star the most enjoyable?

No foul language, no sexual situations. Just a nice, comfortable story - good plot.

Who was your favorite character and why?

Stephen. He hung in there with Ann, even though she was a difficult person.

What does Bodie Thoene bring to the story that you wouldnâ€™t experience if you just read the book?

Because Bodie is one of the authors, she obviously knows what needs to be said and how. She is not, however, a polished narrator, but acceptable, nonetheless.

Did you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?

no

Any additional comments?

I am a long-time fan of the Thoenes (pronounced Tay-Nee), having read their Zion Chronicles when they were first published and I was a new Christian. Their historic novels are excellent and an exciting read. I wish Audible would carry some of those!! I only gave this book 4 stars because, IMO, it was not up to par. Still, a nice story. One that I would recommend for Christian teens, because the story centers around the 16- yr old daughter, Ann, and her relationship with her parents as well as her peers. The sub-plot has to do with the husband-wife relationship and also the pastor-husband's ambitions to be another Billy Graham.
