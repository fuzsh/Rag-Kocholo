ever-changing field of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). I have been associated with this field for the past 20 years and have had the opportunity to work for the technology organizations of three leading service providersâSprint (U.S.), JazzÂ (Veon), and Telenor Pakistan (Telenor Group). I am currently working at the ICT (Information and Communication Technology) policy-making instituteâMinistry of Information Technology and Telecommunication, Pakistan. Based on these two distinct experiences, I made an attempt in this book to cover not only the technical attributes but also the policy elements of telecommunication. The purpose of this book is to enable the readers to understand the technological ecosystem along with certain key policy/regulatory elements of mobile telecommunication. The key phases of this ecosystem include research and technology development, standardization, product development, network development, device and application development, and burning challenges and best practices. A separate section has been allocated to each of these phases. â¢ Section I looks into the concepts of basic and applied research along with their applicability to telecommunication. Next, the allocation/identification of the radio frequency spectrum at the global level along with some solutions to address the spectrum needs of 5G (fifth generation mobile communications) are discussed. â¢ Section II describes the standardization processes of key SDOs (Standard Development Organizations). The key concepts of 5G that are either under standardization or have been standardized are also described. Additionally, a high level governmental/regulatory policy for 5G is also provided. â¢ Section III describes the domain of semiconductors and product development which is the following step after standardization. Internet-of-Things is described as a potential next growth engine for the semiconductor industry. â¢ Section IV presents the end-to-end architecture of a mobile network. All the key areas of a network including radio access network, transport network, core network, and operation support systems are discussed. The radio access aspects of 4G (Long Term Evolution [LTE]-Advanced) and 5G NR (New Radio), transport network technologies, 5G NGC (Next Generation Core), end-to-end 5G network architecture, network development, and many other characteristics of mobile networks are described. â¢ Section VâSmart phones and smart applications have brought seismic change to the way we communicate and conduct business. To support ITUâs (International Telecommunication Union) requirements for 5G, certain components of devices such as batteries, processors, and antennas may require major upgrades. These potential enhancements are discussed from the perspectives of theoretical standards and state-of-the-art innovations. Application delivery mechanisms along with exciting applications such as mobile money and Internet of Things (IoT) are explained. â¢ Section VI explains some of the industryâs key challenges as well as the best practices that can be later addressed/used in the subsequent generation of mobile telecommunication. The book also presents a number of case studies that may help the readers to learn about ICT from the perspectives of both developing and developed economies. To assist academia, every chapter is provided with a mix of simple and thought-provoking problems. A solution manual is also available from the publisher for the assistance of instructors. xv\n\nP:17\n\nxvi Preface I concluded the book with certain suggestions, particularly on the importance of basic research, departure from the traditional 10-year evolution cycle, and having a 20 to 30-year plan which may help in further strengthening the longevity of the telecommunication sector. From the bottom of my heart I would like to thank my mother for her prayers, my wife for her support, and my daughters for sparing precious time from their studies. In conclusion, I hope you will enjoy reading this book and realize enormous benefits from it. Saad Z.

The Mobile Cellular Telephony is enabled through a combination of cellular networks and mobile devices which communicate to each other by means of radio frequency spectrum (i.e. wirelessly). A cellular network consists of thousands of nodes that assist mobile device users in performing plethora of tasks. Mobile device has become the Third Screen after Television and Computer and is becoming more economical and powerful with continual technological advancements. There are more than 5 billion mobile subscribers in the world and for the very vast majority the mobile device has become a necessity and without it they canât go about with their daily routine lives. 1.1â MOBILE CELLULAR TELEPHONY EVOLUTION The cellular concept was conceived by Bell Laboratories in 1947 and enabled companies to provide wireless communications to a large population [1]. Like any other field of science and technology, mobile communications is continuously evolving and the sector* has made astonishing progress in the last 70 years. The first generation (1G) cellular networks was deployed in the 1980s, the second generation (2G) in the 1990s, while the third generation (3G) in the 2000s. Today, 4G (fourth generation) cellular networks are being deployed and the world is getting ready to embrace the fifth generation (5G) of mobile cellular telephony. The 1G analog systems are no longer operational, which only provided voice services and had no support for data. The 2G digital systems are currently operational and support voice and limited data services. The 3G systems support voice, low speed data, and enable a number of data services. The 4G systems enable mobile broadband in the true sense, targeting 100â Mbps or higher on the move. 5G systems are expected to provide an enhanced mobile broadband targeting peak data rate of 20â Gbps, extend 4Gâs Internet of Things capability, and enable mission-critical applications that require ultra-high reliability and low latency. 5G networks are expected to be designed by taking a user-centric approach. 1.2â HEXAGON BASED MOBILE CELLULAR TELEPHONY A cellular network or mobile network is a wireless network spread over the land through a web of cell sites. Each of these sites or cell towers is comprised of a transceiver (transmitter/receiver) for communications with mobile devices. From a technological perspective, mobile devicesâ rely on die hard cellular towers for communications and these cell sites or cell towers are designed to keep a hexagonal shape in mind. The use of hexagonal cells was invented by Bell Laboratories in the 1970s [2]. This shape was selected over other geometrical shapes since by using it the cells can be laid next to each other with no overlap, thus providing coverage theoretically to the entire service area without any gaps [3]. The hexagon design has been at least so far remained as necessary for mobile communications as cement for the construction of buildings or coal tar for carpeting the roads. * The sector includes both private and public entities associated with mobile communications, that is, governments, ministries, regulators, and private industry. â Mobile devices can include mobile phones, tablets, data modems, iPads, and similar devices. 1\n\nP:21\n\n2 5G Mobile Communications Research & Technology Standardization Development Practices, Challenges 5G Produ ct & Demands Mobile Cellular Telephony Development Evolution Connected Devices Smart Networks & Applications FIGURE 1.1â Key steps in mobile cellular telephony. If we look at it from an end-to-end perspective, the key phases of the mobile cellular telephony can nicely fit on the six corners of the hexagon shape (Figure 1.1). These generic six phases are research and technology development, standardization, product development, network development, device and application development, and the sectorâs practices and challenges. In a nutshell, though not necessary, research and technological development is the first step that leads into standardization followed by product development. Once telecom products are ready, they get deployed in the cellular networks. Device development usually lags behind network equipment production. Once networks are up and running and users are connected to networks through their devices, applications start to pour in; from there, the sectors begin to see the good or not-so-good practices, bottle necks and challenges, and new business demands which then leads back to the first step to start all over again. 1.3â MANUSCRIPT OVERVIEW This manuscript has been divided into the following six sections corresponding to the hexagonal cell. Section I is on research, technology development, and the frequency spectrum. Like any field of science and technology, mobile communications also rely on research and technology development for progress and evolution. Chapter 2 discusses how these are currently capitalized in mobile networks and how these can be strengthened in the future. The topic of the radio frequency spectrum, which is controlled by governments, is discussed in Chapter 3. The ITU-R (International Telecommunications Union Radiocommunication Sector) process of frequency allocation and identification and some potential technical and financial solutions to address the spectrum needs of 5G are discussed in this chapter. Section II looks into the element of standardization. Mobile communications is governed by global standards which are developed to achieve economies of scale and to attain many other benefits. Chapter 4 looks into the standardization of 5G along with the standardization processes of certain key standard development organizations (SDOs), ITU-T (ITU Standardization Sector) guidelines for establishing SDOs in developing nations, and a case study on the lack of research and standardization in OIC (Organization of Islamic Conference) member states. Chapter 5 summarizes certain key elements of 5G such as multiple access techniques, cognitive radio, massive cloud radio access\n\nP:22\n\nThe Beginning 3 network, vehicular communications, and network slicing. 5G is currently in the standardization phase and ITU is expected to approve the 5G standard in 2020. Section III describes the key aspects of semiconductor development and product development. After standardization, the next step is to develop integrated circuits (ICs) conforming to standards, which is described in Chapter 6. Every piece of telecom equipment is equipped with ICs which is a set of electronic circuits on a small plate (chip) of semiconductor material, normally silicon. Various technologies for IC development along with a perspective on semiconductor business in Pakistan are presented in this chapter. The ICs along with components (shelves, chassis, nut, bolts, and so on) go into full scale product development. Chapter 7 presents a few such products, namely multimode base stations, 5G enabled base stations/small cells, and so on. Section IV is all about networks covering the areas of radio access network, transport network, core network, and operation support systems. The section starts with defining the end-to-end cellular network architectures of 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G in Chapter 8. The radio access network of 4G along with several advanced features of LTE-Advanced and LTE-Advanced Pro are discussed in Chapter 9. The requirements, architecture, and air interface of 5G NR (new radio) are also described in the same chapter. Chapter 10 starts off by defining traffic capacity requirements for 5G. It also discusses key technologies in three subareas of transport networks, namely mobile backhaul, metro transport network, and core transport network. A case study is also presented on the applicability of 80â GHz e-band microwave radios for the cellular and broadband providers of Pakistan. Chapter 11 provides an overview of the 4G Evolved Packet Core and evolving 5G NGC (Next Generation Core). CDN (Content Development Network), evolution of IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem), and OSS (Operations Support Systems) are also discussed in the chapter. Section V deals with connected devices and certain key mobile applications that are described in Chapters 12 and 13, respectively. Chapter 12 discusses the three key components of devices. namely batteries, processors, and antennas that perhaps need major as upgrades to meet the requisites of 5G. Chapter 13 describes application delivery mechanisms such as SDP (Service Delivery Platform) and IMS, and the role of cloud computing in the arena of applications. In the latter part of the same chapter, advanced value added services such as mobile financial services, mobile health, and IoT (Internet of Things) are described in detail. Section VI, which is the last section, describes the industryâs key burning challenges and best practices which can later be formulized in the following generation of mobile communications. Chapter 14 looks into the challenges due to signaling storms (massive signaling traffic due to smart devices), an abundance of HetNets (heterogeneous networks), device-to-device communications, and big data. Chapter 15 discusses some key practices of the industry, namely spectrum management, energy management, and patent portfolio management where each practice is further elaborated with a case study. The book concludes with a futuristic and thought provoking discussion on how to go beyond the traditional way of doing business. Chapter 16 urges the telecom sector to look at the bigger picture and into a much more distant future in collaboration with the overall ICT (Information and Communication Technology) sector.

Research is the backbone of the telecommunications world and a critical enabler for future achievements. Todayâs research in telecommunications primarily falls into the category of applied research. Applied research is business driven, focusing on solving practical problems for gaining profits in short to midterm. The basic research, on the other hand, is conducted without boundaries and without business justifications and focuses on long term. The research is forward looking, drives innovation, enables socio-economic prosperity and helps to move from one generation of technology to the next. There are as such no hard-coded steps but normally research takes into technological development. In more tangible terms the R&D from academia goes into industrial research labs and from there to standard development organizations. The standardization process is executed, within certain boundaries, considering economical and deployment constraints and interoperability challenges. Standardization is followed by product development and then to network development/deployment/ operations. The focus of this chapter is on research and technology development (R&D/R&TD), which is the fundamental block for making continuous and substantial progress in telecommunications. 2.1âBASIC VERSUS APPLIED RESEARCH Basic research is curiosity driven. It is performed without a thought for practical ends as defined in the report âScience, the Endless Frontierâ [1] by Vannevar Bush to the President of the United States in 1945 and quoted by the National Science Foundation in one of its articles published in 1953 [2]. Basic research leads to new knowledge and provides scientific capital. The knowledge provides the means of addressing a good number of practical problems, though at the same time, it may not give a complete specific answer to any of them [2]. The goal of basic research needs to be defined by the researchers themselves rather than by certain individuals/organizations that are mainly concerned with short term improvements in existing products and services [3]. At the end of the day, it is important that the unrestrained exploration of new knowledge results in discoveries and inventions. A perfect example of this fact is the discovery of gravitational waves in 2016 after a century of expectation. Applied research, on the contrary, is designed to answer specific questions aimed at solving specific practical problems. The knowledge acquired through applied research has specific commercial objectives in the form of products, processes or services. A good example could be the use of single base transceiver stations (BTS) to support various radio access technologies in the late 2000s as compared to having a one-to-one mapping between BTS and radio technology. It may be noted that both types of research complement each other. The basic research provides scientific know-how. Applied researchers can use this knowledge to develop new technologies/ products and also to make improvements on existing products, technologies, and processes. This is followed by a step in which basic researchers take advantage of improved products and services to answer new fundamental questions. Overall, it is an important cycle for the progress and advancement of all the fields of science and technology [4]. 5\n\nP:25\n\n6 5G Mobile Communications FIGURE 2.1â ICT industry R&D spending. (From Battelle and R&D Magazine 2016. 2016 Global R&D Funding Forecast [7].) The telecom industry focuses on applied research, as the emphasis is on short term practical gains rather than on researcher-driven investigations. There is immense competitive pressure to focus on the short term rather than on longer terms in the corporate world. The horizons are getting shorter and are driven by fast moving and incremental gain loving industry and society in general. However, there is a need for basic research for the longer term future of telecommunications that needs to be produced at both the national and global levels as illustrated by the following case. A well known example of the relationship between basic and applied research is the invention of the laser. This activity was substantially funded by U.S. federal research dollars. The work of inventors was criticized at the time by some of their colleagues as âa solution looking for a problemâ [5]. However, history proved otherwise, making the laser a solution for many problems. The laser has ultimately revolutionized not only the telecommunications industry through fiber optics, but also provided an unlimited set of applications from laser printers to laser guided weapons. In a nutshell, the U.S. government provided the much-needed support upfront for basic research and later various industries funded the applied research to produce countless benefits [6]. 2.2âR&D IN ICT At the global ICT (Information and Communication Technology)* level, the U.S. continues to be the dominant R&D force. The U.S. accounted for about 58% of this sectorâs global R&D share in 2016 as tabulated in Battelle and R&D Magazine (Figure 2.1). The vast majority of the R&D investors are suppliers as shown in [7,8], where the investment activity is led by Intel and Microsoft, with each investing more than US $13 billion in R&D during 2016. ICT heavily relies on the semiconductor industry that has laid the foundation for modern electronics and the modern lifestyle. Every piece of ICT equipment contains integrated circuits which are a set of electronic circuits on a small plate (chip) of semiconductor material. The * The ICT industry provides hardware, software, and services that make up the modern information age, spanning semiconductors, telecommunications, computers, phones, and tablets [7].\n\nP:26\n\nResearch and Technology Development 7 TABLE 2.1 Top 10 Semiconductor R&D Spenders 2016 2015 2014 Company/ 2014 R&D 2014 2015 R&D 2015 2016 R&D 2016 Rank Rank Rank Headquarters Exp ($M) R&D/Sales Exp ($M) R&D/Sales Exp($M) R&D/Sales 1 11 Intel, USA 11,537 22.4% 12,128 24% 12,740 22.4% 2 22 Qualcomm, USA 3,695 19.2% 3,702 23.1% 5,109 33.1% 3 44 Broadcom, USA 2,373 28.2% 2,105 25.0% 3,188 20.5% 4 33 Samsung, South 2,965 7.8% 3,125 7.5% 2,881 6.5% Korea 5 76 Toshiba, Japan 1,853 16.8% 1,655 17.0% 2,777 27.6% 6 55 TSMCa, Taiwan 1,874 7.5% 2,068 7.8% 2,215 7.5% 7 89 MediaTek, Taiwan 1,430 1,460 1,730 20.2% 8 67 Micron, USA 1,598 20.3% 1,695 21.8% 1,681 11.1% 9 ââ NXPb, Netherlands 9.6% 11.4% 1,560 10 9 12 SK Hynix, South â â 1,514 16.4% Korea 1,340 â 1,421 â 10.2% Top 10 Total 8.2% 8.4% 35,395 28,655 29,359 â â â Source: Electronic Specifier.

Research BulletinâSemiconductor R&D Growth Slows in 2015 [9â11]. a TSMC: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. b NXP: Next Experience. semiconductor is a substance, usually a solid chemical element or compound, that supports electrical conductivity between a conductor, such as copper, and an insulator, such as glass. Elements like silicon, germanium, and compounds of gallium are the most widely used in electronic circuits. From the perspective of semiconductor research and development spending, Intel leads the chart followed by Qualcomm and Broadcom as shown in Table 2.1 [9â11]. The advancements in semiconductors are a prerequisite in providing higher data speeds and energy efficiency in telecom networks and devices. 2.2.1âR&D in Telecom A similar trend is also followed in telecommunications (a subset of ICT) where the vendor community is primarily driving R&D investments. The vast majority of the service provider community, on the other hand, does not conduct any sizeable research and relies on vendorsâ R&D results. Vendors and operators sometimes jointly set up innovation centers to bring research more closely align with practicality. The results from such joint ventures speed up the stages of product development and deployment. The vendor community, in general, consists of network infrastructure providers, semiconductor developers, device manufacturers, and perhaps application developers that annually spend billions of dollars on research to gain a competitive advantage and greater profits in the longer run. Figure 2.2 shows the R&D spending of some key players of the telecom sector. It can clearly be seen that vendors are in the driversâ seat and spend billions on the applied R&D. DOCOMO (aÂ Japanese operator), which has one of the largest if not the largest R&D budget, still lags behind the vendor community [12â19]. Some examples of R&D portfolios for vendors and operators are as follows [20â22]. Apple is the most valuable company in the world, the worldâs largest information technology company by revenue [23], the worldâs largest technology company by total assets [24], and the\n\nP:27\n\n8 5G Mobile Communications FIGURE 2.2â Telecom R&D spending. worldâs second largest mobile phone manufacturer [25]. In relation to telecommunications, it designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics like the famous iPhone branded products. It spends about 3% of its revenue on R&D which skyrocketed from US $782 million in 2007 to US $8.1 billion in 2015 [26,27]. Ericssonâs research and development function is a part of Group Function Technology and focuses on a variety of research areas, including but not limited to wireless access networks, networking, radio, and cloud technologies. Group Function Technology funds research activities with several major universities and research institutes all over the world. It also leads and supports research programs within the European Union and substantially contributes to standards development activities. Ericsson has been granted 39,000 patents, and is the largest holder of standard-essential patents on mobile communications. It spends about 15% of its sales on R&D expenditures [28]. Huawei has a large pool of product and solution R&D employees, comprising more than 45% of its total workforce worldwide. It runs 16 R&D centers in several countries that include Germany, Sweden, the U.S., France, Italy, Russia, India, and China. It has also set up 28 joint innovation centers with leading telecom operators to bring solutions to the market earlier and with fewer implementation challenges. Huawei participates in more than 150 industry standards organizations. It has been granted 30,240 patents and spends about 13.7% of the companyâs annual revenue on R&D [29]. Bell Laboratories is the R&D unit of Nokia founded in 1925. Its primary activities are directed from its Murray Hill, New Jersey, U.S. based headquarters, and it also operates R&D facilities in a few additional countries. Bell Labs participates in approximately 100 standards organizations, making contributions to more than 200 different working groups. It collaborates with more than 250Â universities across the globe. It has more than 33,000 patents and has received seven Nobel Prizes which are shared among its 12 researchers. It spends about 16% of the companyâs annual sales on R&D [30,31]. Qualcomm is a fabless semiconductor company and its business model is built around technology licensing. The U.S. Telecommunications Industry Association adopted Qualcommâs CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology, which is used in all the 3G standards, as a cellular standard in 1993. It spends about 20% of the companyâs annual sales on R&D. It holds one of the largest standard-essential patentsâ portfolios in mobile communications [32]. It is actively engaged with academia and collaborates heavily with standards development organizations. Orange Labs is the R&D arm of France Telecom that consists of 18 laboratories in (the UK, France, Poland, China, Korea, Japan, Jordan, Egypt, and the US) and a few technocenters. A technocenter is an incubator for projects with high innovation potential. Moreover, the goal of technocenters is to reduce the time required to bring a concept to market. It actively contributes to regional and global groups of standardization bodies. Orange devotes about 2% of its revenue to research and development [33].\n\nP:28\n\nResearch and Technology Development 9 NTT DOCOMO R&D (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone do communications over the mobile network) has been in the forefront of mobile technology, not only in Japan, but also at a global scale. During 2014, it created one of the first labs dedicated to conducting R&D on 5G and to speeding up work on its standardization. It contributes about 2.5% of its revenue to research and development [34]. It is evident from the above examples and illustrations that the vendor community spends over 10% of its revenue on R&D, whereas operatorsâ spending hovers around 2% (if any). R&D spending by some of the largest operators is on the order of a few hundred million dollars, whereas it runs into billions for large-scale manufacturers. Orange Labs and DOCOMO are the two key R&D spenders in the operator community, whereas the vast majority of the service providers do not set aside a budget for R&D. 2.2.2âR&D Process (Telecom) Established vendors and startups are always seeking to bring research and innovations to their customers, that is, the operators. In the majority of cases, operators have the final say as to whether or not to take the supplierâs innovation to the next level. The established suppliers, big or small, have deeper pockets and more leverage over operators as compared to startups. The startups spend considerable time seeking funding from venture capital firms and endorsements from operators for their technology incubation. As the research starts to mature, suppliers start working to sell their ideas, which leads to technology development (or technology incubation for startups). Technology development enables development and enhancement of practical solutions. Technologies are first normally standardized and then utilized during product development. 2.2.2.1âExample Consider the case of antenna diversity in mobile phones which has become a fundamental component of 3G, LTE, 4G, and eventually 5G networks and devices. Antenna diversity (a form of smart antennas*) is about having more than one antenna either in the transmit or receive direction or in both to increase the coverage and capacity of telecom networks. Twenty or so years ago, in the 1990s, that was a novel and commercially unproven idea. The academia, suppliers, and startups were highly involved in putting their arms around smart antennas, including MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output). During that time, some startups such as Metawave Communications, even disappeared due to a lack of interest from the operators. Finally, the inception of 3G and data in the early 2000s brought smart antenna techniques to a more practical level. Tests and evaluations were happening at a faster pace with the involvement of operators. One such investigation [36] in the form of having two receiving antennas (mobile receive diversity) in the 3G handset revealed voice and data capacity gains in excess of 3â dBâ in the forward link (base station to mobile). Such investigations later resulted in full scale standardization of smart antenna solutions or antenna diversity solutions, that is, MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output). MIMO involves adding antenna elements at both the base station and at the terminal. MIMO is a key feature of LTE and LTE-Advanced and is expected for 5G systems as well. 2.3âSTRENGTHENING THE ICT R&D ECOSYSTEM Over the last several decades, the development of the ICT industry has had a positive impact on nearly every facet of the global economy and global family. The continuation of this positive * A smart antenna is a digital wireless communications antenna system that takes advantage of the diversity effect at the source (transmitter), the destination (receiver) or both [35]. â 3â dB or 3 decibels represents a ratio of two to one or a doubling of power.\n\nP:29\n\n10 5G Mobile Communications FIGURE 2.3â ICT R&D ecosystem. trend highly depends on the health of the ICT research ecosystem. A robust research ecosystem (Figure 2.3) comprises strong government policies, energetic university and industrial research institutions, emerging startups, mature technology companies, funding for both basic and applied technologies from government and private institutions (including venture capital firms), and a large pool of talented researchers. Only a few countries have all of the ingredients required to establish and maintain a dynamic ICT research ecosystem. Thus, strong collaboration is required at the global level so that one country can address the missing elements of another nation [6,37â40]. A critical element for continuation of this ecosystem is investment in basic research, which is almost nonexistent, particularly in the ICT sector, worldwide. Most of the investment since the last decade has been pouring into applied research for immediate returns. This trend is expected to continue as ICT companies operate in a highly competitive and commoditized environment, which is forcing them to quickly bring products to market with razor thin margins. 2.3.1âExample A perfect example of such a trend can be witnessed in Bell Laboratories (the R&D organization of Nokia). Bell Labs was heavily involved in basic, long term ICT research prior to restructuring in the 1980s. That particular form of research was funded through a fee assessed on Bell operating companies and relied on the federal governmentâs support. Thus, a stable flow of research funds was guaranteed for basic research within the Bell system. This basic research resulted in the discovery of a number of marvelous technologies, including but not limited to transistors (1947), photovoltaic cells (1954), lasers (1958), and the Unix operating system (1969) [6]. Following restructuring and particularly after Alcatel-Lucent took over, it began to downsize and place greater focus on applied research. During the 1980s, Bell Labs had approximately 25,000 employees, around 30,000 in 2001, and as recently as 2014 had only 700, which is definitely disturbing. In a nutshell, the overall research funding has been significantly reduced as compared to the 1980s and now we do not hear of new discoveries coming from such labs. 2.3.2â High Level Suggestions It is critically important that the global ICT industry and governments focus not only on those items that they are sure will bring economic payoff in the short term. However, at the same time, they should also devote resources, both human and capital, to explore things that may revolutionize the industry and take our knowledge and understanding to the next level.\n\nP:30\n\nResearch and Technology Development 11 FIGURE 2.4â Telecom generation evolution. Furthermore, the telecom sector has to look beyond the 10-year evolution cycle (Figure 2.4) and think for the long-term future as well; perhaps having a 30 to 40 (2040/2050) year ICT plan/vision from the ITU (International Telecommunications Union) would be a good starting point. In addition, for the long term sustainability of the ICT research ecosystem, the following items are vital. â¢ Consistent and considerable investment in basic research by the governments, â¢ Re-emphasis on basic research from industrial research institutions along with continued focus on applied research, â¢ Generous effort on reducing the R&D gap between developed and developing nations, and â¢ Emphasis on having a reasonable gap from one telecom generation to the next in order to allow for return-on-investment. 2.4âSUMMARY The constant evolution in telecommunications is recognized both as a market driver and as a driver for R&D, since R&D activities are built to support consumer and business demands. The market pressures and recent past recessions have considerably shifted the focus of companies to product development and incremental research, rather than innovating for the future and seeding technology development. This current focus on short term gains has paved the way for applied research to the furthest extent. There is much more focus on the âDâ rather than on âRâ in todayâs world. The efforts and investments in basic research have been diminishing, thus sincere and consistent hard work is required at both the government and industry levels for its revival. Research and technological development, which is a founding block of any field of science and technology, was explained from the point of view of ICT with a primary focus on the telecom industry. The research ecosystem along with its shortcomings were also presented. It is important that governments and the ICT industry re-evaluate the R&D ecosystem and consider having both a 3 to 5-year view along with a 30 to 40-year long vision. PROBLEMS 1.

The progression from radio waves (longest wavelength) to gamma rays (shortest wavelength*) is also a sequence in terms of energy from lowest to highest, that is, the energy carried by a radio wave is low while gamma rays carry high energy [1]. Mobile communication depends on the radio spectrum to carry out its tasks. The term radio spectrum refers to the frequency range from 3â kHz to 300â GHz corresponding to wavelengths ranging from 100â km to 1â mm. The exchange of information takes place by varying the amplitude, phase, and frequency of carrier radio waves. This radio spectrum is one of the most tightly regulated resources of todayâs world. From cell phones to broadcasting TV sets, microwave ovens to garage door openers, maritime affairs to flight tracking, virtually every wireless piece of communication depends on access to the radio frequency spectrum. This chapter will present the frequency allocation and identification process at the global level and some potential technical and financial solutions to address the spectrum needs of 5G. 3.1â RADIO SPECTRUM AND MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS Todayâs 2G/3G/4G mobile communications primarily use frequencies in the range of 700â MHz to 42â GHz. Additionally, some communication take place in the 400â MHz and 70/80â GHz range, however, the use of this set of frequencies is relatively very small (just like a needle in a haystack). The frequencies are allocated by the International Telecommunications Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) through World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRC) on both a primary and secondary basis. On a wider scale, spectrum sharing of a primary allocation with other primary and/or secondary services has not been attempted as such. For example, the 698â806â MHz band had been historically allocated by ITU-R on a primary basis for both broadcasting and mobile use, but it was only used for broadcasting and not for mobile use in the U.S. (i.e., no sharing was taking place). During 2008â09, the Federal Communications Commission or FCC auctioned this band for mobile communications while ceasing television broadcasting in the same range, thus reducing the opportunity for any sharing between the two services [3]. 5G envisions the use of high capacity broadband applications and services that will require a huge amount of spectrum. Beyond excessive mobile broadband and gigabits of data rates, applications like the Internet of Things, use of wireless sensors, and so on have necessitated the search for additional spectrum. It is widely established that the world will need an additional 1000 or so MHz to meet the demands of mobile broadband by 2020. Spectrum scarcity is emerging as one of key problems for 5G and so far the world has not found a solution or solutions (as readers will see later in the chapter). The ITU through the World Radiocommuication Conference 2015 (WRC-15) only allocated 51â MHz for IMT (International Mobile Telecommunications) on a global scale, which is quite infinitesimal compared to what is required. However, the conference has identified several bands in the range of 24.25â86â GHz for studies to address this requirement. The sharing and compatibility studies of these bands are expected to be shared during WRC-19; thus we can expect to find additional spectrum for 5G and broadband in due time. * One wavelength equals the distance between two successive wave crests or troughs. 15\n\nP:35\n\n16 5G Mobile Communications FIGURE 3.1â Electromagnetic spectrum. (From NASA 2013. Imagine the Universe. https://imagine.gsfc.nasa. gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum1.html [2].) Furthermore, innovative techniques are needed to introduce spectrum sharing and effectively manage implications of air-interface design. And spectrum also has to be managed and regulated to avoid interference related bottlenecks. 3.2â FREQUENCY ALLOCATION AND IDENTIFICATION The ITU-R is the body that identifies frequency bands for almost any type of wireless communications all around the world. These types include but are not limited to aviation, broadcasting, maritime, mobile communications, public protection and disaster relief, satellite services, and so on. The allocation and identification of frequencies take place at the ITU WRCs. These inter-governmental events take place every three to four years to address the frequency related needs of the world. WRC is the most significant conference related to the frequency spectrum organized by ITU with a mandate to review, and, if necessary, to revise the radio regulations which govern the use of a scarce resource, that is the frequency spectrum. As far as mobile communications are concerned, the frequencies have to be allocated primarily for mobile communications and may have to be identified for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT). Second, these have to be allocated for fixed wireless communications links to support backhaul in mobile networks which is termed as a fixed service in the Table of Frequency Allocations (TFA) maintained by ITU at the international level. In simple terms, frequencies have to be identified for wireless communications that take place between mobile users and cellular towers and between cellular towers (i.e., terrestrial backhaul using microwave radios). Finally, satellite based links are also used to support backhaul traffic in remote and far flung areas. Thus, some frequency bands allocated for satellite communications are used in mobile networks in the form of VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal), but in the whole scheme of things, their relative use is quite small compared to the frequencies that are used for communications between users and cell phone towers and in terrestrial backhaul. Table 3.1 shows various bands that have been allocated for mobile and fixed services in all three ITU regions* on a primary basis. The challenge that should be noted is that allocation for mobile communications does not necessarily guarantee its use for IMT, and in todayâs world, the identification for IMT has become a necessary requirement for broadband communications. So far, only a few bands have been identified for IMT and these are shown in Table 3.2. * As per Article 5 of ITU Radio Regulations: Region 1 comprises Europe, Africa, the former Soviet Union, Mongolia, and the Middle East west of the Persian Gulf, including Iraq; Region 2 includes the Americas including Greenland and some of the eastern Pacific Islands; Region 3 covers non-FSU (former Soviet Union) east of and including Iran and most of Oceania [5,6].\n\nP:36\n\nRadio Frequency Spectrum 17 TABLE 3.1 Allocation for Mobile and Fixed Services Frequency Region 1 Region 2 Region 3 410â430â MHz FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 440â470â MHz FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 470â890â MHz 790â862 FIXED, MOBILE 698â806 MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 806â890 FIXED, MOBILE 890â960â MHz 862â890 FIXED, MOBILE 890â902 FIXED, MOBILE 890â960 890â960 902â928 FIXED 928â960 FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 1427â1525â MHz FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE FIXED 1525â1530â MHz FIXED FIXED, MOBILE 1668.4â1690â MHz FIXED, MOBILE â FIXED, MOBILE 1700â1710â MHz FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 1710â2170â MHz FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 2170â2520â MHz FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 2520â2690â MHz FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 3400â3500 FIXED 2700â4800â MHz 3400â4200 FIXED FIXED, MOBILE 3500â4200 FIXED, MOBILE 4400â4800 FIXED, MOBILE 3400â3500 FIXED 4400â4800 FIXED, MOBILE 4800â5000â MHz 3500â4200 FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 5150â5350â MHz FIXED, MOBILE 4400â4800 FIXED, MOBILE MOBILE 5470â5725â MHz MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE MOBILE 5850â8500â MHz MOBILE MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 10â10.45â GHz FIXED, MOBILE MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 10.5â10.68â GHz FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 10.7â11.7â GHz FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 11.7â14â GHz FIXED, MOBILE â 11.7â13.25 FIXED, MOBILE 11.7â12.5 FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 14â15.4â GHz 12.75â13.25 FIXED, MOBILE FIXED, MOBILE 14.3â14.4 FIXED, MOBILE 14.3â14.4 FIXED, MOBILE 11.7â12.1 FIXED 14.4â15.35 FIXED, MOBILE 15.4â18.4â GHz 14.4â15.35 FIXED, MOBILE 12.2â13.25 FIXED, MOBILE 17.7â18.1 FIXED, MOBILE 17.7â18.1 FIXED, MOBILE 14.4â15.35 FIXED, MOBILE 18.1â18.4 FIXED, MOBILE 18.4â22â GHz 18.1â18.4 FIXED, MOBILE 17.7â17.8 FIXED 18.4â19.7 FIXED, MOBILE 22â24.75â GHz 18.4â19.7 FIXED, MOBILE 17.8â18.1 FIXED, MOBILE 21.2â22 FIXED, MOBILE 21.2â22 FIXED, MOBILE 18.1â18.4 FIXED, MOBILE 22â23.6 FIXED, MOBILE 24.75â29.9â GHz 22â23.6 FIXED, MOBILE 18.4â19.7 FIXED, MOBILE 24.25â24.75 FIXED, MOBILE 24.25â24.75 FIXED 21.2â22 FIXED, MOBILE 24.75â25.25 FIXED 29.9â34.2â GHz 24.75â25.25 FIXED 22â23.6 FIXED, MOBILE 25.25â29.5 FIXED, MOBILE 25.25â29.5 FIXED, MOBILE 31â31.3 FIXED, MOBILE 34.2â40â GHz 31â31.3 FIXED, MOBILE â 31.8â33.4 FIXED 40â43.5â GHz 31.8â33.4 FIXED 25.25â29.5 FIXED, MOBILE 36â40 FIXED, MOBILE 36â40 FIXED, MOBILE 31â31.3 FIXED, MOBILE 40â40.5 FIXED, MOBILE 71â76â GHz 40â40.5 FIXED, MOBILE 31.8â33.4 FIXED 40.5â43.5 FIXED 81â86â GHz 40.5â43.5 FIXED 36â40 FIXED, MOBILE 71â76 FIXED, MOBILE 71â76 FIXED, MOBILE 40â40.5 FIXED, MOBILE 81â86 FIXED, MOBILE 81â86 FIXED, MOBILE 40.5â43.5 FIXED 71â76 FIXED, MOBILE 81â86 FIXED, MOBILE Source: ITU-R 2016.

Final Acts WRC-15 World Radiocommunication Conference 2015; GSMA 2014. The Impact of Licensed Shared Use of Spectrum. Report by Deloitte and Real Wireless [4,7]. 3.3â FREQUENCY SPECTRUM NEEDS OF 5G It is well known that the availability of new spectrum bands is a key requirement for the provision of 5G or IMT-2020 services. The ITU-R has estimated that the total global spectrum requirements for IMT will be in the range of 1340 (for lower user density settings) to 1960â MHz (for higher user density settings) for the year 2020 [8]. Spectrum allocation is required not only in air-interface, but also for backhaul and to some extent in the fronthaul. Fronthaul is the link between a pool of base band units and remote radio units (RRUs) which collectively formed the concept of C-RAN (cloud/centralized radio access network). Backhaul (first leg between RRUs and Core Network) is a major challenge for 5G, but to some extent, it can be fulfilled with wired media such as optical fiber cable and technologies such as very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line 2, and so on. However, for the most part, the air- interface (link between wireless user/device and remote radio unit) is where the vast majority of the spectrum is required. Almost every frequency band, particularly up to 100â GHz as stated in Tables 3.1 and 3.2, isÂ quite extensively in use and it is well established that the sector will require an additional 1000â2000â MHz by 2020. Keeping this challenge in mind, the recently completed WRC-15 identified aÂ few hundreds of megahertz of spectrum for mobile broadband at the regional levels. However, atÂ the global level, WRC-15 was only able to identify 51â MHz for IMT. The spectrum was allocated toÂ ensure harmonization at the regional and global levels. The harmonization will bringÂ reducedÂ prices for the production of mobile broadband equipment, and thus assist in delivering more affordable broadband to all. The key outcomes of WRC-15 in relation to IMT are as follows: UHF (470â694/698â MHz): â¢ In Region 1, no allocation was made for IMT and it primarily remained assigned to broadcasting service. â¢ In Region 2, for the most part, all or some portions of this band were identified for IMT. â¢ In Region 3, the band 610â698â MHz was identified in two countries, namely Bangladesh and New Zealand, and five island nations.\n\nP:38\n\nRadio Frequency Spectrum 19 L-Band 1427â1518â MHz: â¢ 51â MHz of L-band (1427â1452â MHz and 1492â1518â MHz) was identified for IMT worldwide. â¢ A total of 91â MHz of L-band (1427â1452â MHz, 1452â1492â MHz, and 1492â1518 MHz) was identified for IMT in ITU Regions 2 and 3 and in some countries of Region 1. It can be seen that this allocation is much less than what is required. However, several bands have been identified between 24.25â GHz and 86â GHz for studies to address this requirement (Table 3.3). These sharing and compatibility studies will be completed in time for WRC-19 [4,9â13]. 3.3.1â Technical Solutions This section will briefly discuss some solutions that could potentially open doors for more frequencies for 5G. Spectrum sharing tops the list while advancements in semiconductors, antenna technology, and interference avoidance technique will provide opportunities to extract more juice from the existing allocated spectrum. 3.3.1.1â Spectrum Sharing Spectrum sharing is defined as the collective use of a frequency band by two or more parties in a specific geographical area. Sharing can take place in both licensed and license-exempt bands [7]. For 5G, sharing may also need to be considered with incumbents such as FSS (fixed satellite service), radar, and so on. This form of sharing requires compatibility studies between broadband and nonmobile incumbents which ITU-R is planning to complete in conjunction with its preparation for WRC-19. Spectrum sharing is a three-dimensional challenge that not only needs to allow for frequency but must also encompass time and geographical factors in providing access across multiple classes of users. The Licensed Shared Access (LSA) mechanism allows LSA licensees to access the spectrum that has already been assigned to an incumbent. This method allows sharing based on certain rules guaranteeing some level of QoS (Quality of Service). It is different from certain cognitive approaches TABLE 3.3 Potential Bands for Future IMT Services Band (GHz) Bandwidth Key Current Allocation Service (GHz) 24.25â27.5 3.25 FIXED, FIXED-SATELLITE, EARTH EXPLORATION-SATELLITE, MOBILE, INTER-SATELLITE 31.8â33.4 37â40.5 1.6 FIXED, INTER-SATELLITE, SPACE RESEARCH, RADIONAVIGATION 40.5â43.5 3.5 FIXED, FIXED-SATELLITE, SPACE RESEARCH, MOBILE, MOBILE-SATELLITE 45.5â50.2 3 FIXED, FIXED-SATELLITE, BROADCASTING, BROADCASTING-SATELLITE 50.4â52.6 4.7 FIXED, FIXED-SATELLITE, MOBILE 66â76 2.2 FIXED, FIXED-SATELLITE 10 FIXED, FIXED-SATELLITE, BROADCASTING-SATELLITE, MOBILE, MOBILE- 81â86 SATELLITE, RADIONAVIGATION, RADIONAVIGATION-SATELLITE 5 FIXED, FIXED-SATELLITE Source: Americas 2016.

LSA allows mobile operators to use/obtain additional spectrum on a secondary basis and with guaranteed access for an agreed geographic area, time frame, and frequency range. Furthermore, licensed sharing can be horizontal, which normally involves sharing between two similar parties (like two mobile operators) whereas with vertical sharing, the frequency can be shared between different types of parties (like mobile operators and a government organization) [7,14]. All of these licensed sharing options can take place within a specified area (geographic sharing), at specific or random times (temporal sharing), and these need to be coordinated as well to avoid harmful interference [15]. The license-exempt approach, as the name suggests, allows sharing among parties without requiring a license. It enables best effort access and operations for data offloading and so on, and thus it is not well suited for carrier grade performance. The value of a spectrum depends on the profitability of the services that have been assigned to by the respective spectrum. For example, the spectrum assigned for mobile telecommunications will yield much higher economic value than the one that has been assigned to a government entity. Sharing involves tradeoffs whereby allowing a new user in the band will likely diminish what an existing subscriber can do and capitalize on. In general terms, spectrum sharing creates costs and restricts revenues compared to the exclusive use of the same frequency band [7,15]. Many case studies are available that have determined the impact of sharing on the value of a spectrum. The studies presented in [7,15] have shown that sharing reduces the economic value of the spectrum. 3.3.1.2â Air-Interface Design A primary question, that is, whether there will be a single air-interface or a collection of air-interfaces for 5G, still remains to be resolved. However, for frequency agility, sharing, coexistence, and scalable spectral efficiency, an effective air-interface design is a fundamental enabler and there are several reasons for this [16]. First, there are expected to be several bands for 5G distributed over a large range of frequencies so the air-interface has to be flexible enough to accommodate all such bands. These bands could be contiguous/non-contiguous and can fall anywhere from sub 1â GHz up to 100â GHz. Second, the air-interface has to deal with all the possible spectrum sharing scenarios. The sharing can take place in both licensed and unlicensed bands, with or without the involvement of 5G networks. The main challenge that it needs to manage concerning sharing is interference while also optimizing the efficiency of the spectrum. The interference can be managed in various dimensions including time intervals, orthogonal/nonorthogonal frequency resources, locations with sufficient separation, spatial, and orthogonal codes. Last but not least are the significant variations in uplink and downlink traffic ratios (that even exist today), which imply the need for a flexible air-interface design to effectively manage traffic asymmetry. Several air-interfaces (multiple access schemes) are discussed in ChapterÂ 5 â5G Concepts.â 3.3.1.3â Technological Advancements To improve the spectral efficiency over the current LTE/LTE-Advanced systems, advancements in semiconductor design and antenna technology will be crucial. The bands that have been identifie"
