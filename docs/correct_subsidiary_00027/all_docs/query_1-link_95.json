        "text": "Artificial intelligence once again dominated the news this week, but not so much in the software as the hardware.\n\nDespite investor worries about Nvidia’s already high stock price, the AI chipmaker knocked its earnings out of the park Wednesday, sending its stock up 16% and dragging the Nasdaq up 3%.\n\nThe same day, Intel announced its bid to become the “systems foundry for the AI era” with a goal to become the No. 2 chip foundry by 2030 — a goal that CEO Pat Gelsinger (pictured) said would require $100 billion in deals to make chips for other companies, one of which will be Microsoft.\n\nNot all was well on the stock market front, though, as Palo Alto Networks’ stock tanked on weak guidance — a common pattern for enterprise companies these days. Whether that’s a signal that cybersecurity’s Teflon spending profile is weakening remains to be seen.\n\nYou can hear much more on this news from John Furrier and Dave Vellante on theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, out this weekend.\n\nHere’s the most important news this week on SiliconANGLE:\n\nChip competition heats up\n\nAll that competition isn’t hurting the world’s most popular chipmaker yet: Nvidia’s data center GPU sales grow by a stunning 409% on huge demand for AI chips And with a 15% stock jump Thursday, its market cap is grazing — and briefly hit — a stunning $2 trillion. This is one of those moments that defines a new era, like Netscape and then Cisco and then Google at the dawn of the web. Nvidia is leading the AI era, not just in chips but in software — perhaps providing what John Furrier calls the AI operating system. There’s much more analysis on a new power panel on theCUBE with Furrier and ace analysts David Linthicum now with theCUBE Research, Tim Crawford with AVOA and Dion Hinchcliffe with Constellation Research — including the potential that Nvidia may run into headwinds.\n\nNo longer willing to miss the latest tech boat, Intel held its true coming-out for its foundry business this week, along with updates on its progress in chip process technologies: Intel unveils Intel Foundry with eye to AI and next-gen lithography manufacturing\n\nSome takeaways from its IFS Direct Connect event Wednesday in San Jose, which I attended:\n\nBy CEO Pat Gelsinger’s reckoning, Intel will need $100 billion in foundry business to get to No. 2 by 2030, but he invited “Jensen, Christiano, Sundar and even Lisa” to be customers, referring of course to the CEOs of Nvidia, Qualcomm, Google and Advanced Micro Devices. That said, Gelsinger (pictured) conceded that it’s Intel’s own products that will be filling most of the fabs it’s building in the next two or three years, though like others such as TSMC’s, some have been delayed on slowing demand, slow distribution of Chips Act money and other issues.\n\nWhy choose Intel Foundry? Gelsinger talked up Intel’s system and packaging expertise, a lot of partners such as Synopsis and Cadence for its more advanced process nodes coming, as well as its sustainability efforts such as using 99% renewable energy in its fabs. Dave Vellante is skeptical — more on that on theCUBE Pod and in a power panel on theCUBE, both well worth watching — that the chiplet packaging approach indicates much more than that Intel remains far behind in its ability to produce in volume the huge chips that are driving the leading edge of AI today.\n\nIn a “hell freezes over” moment, Intel introduced its “most important partner,” Arm, bringing onstage CEO Rene Haas onstage, who said, “You guys have been terrific” to work with. Foundry chief Stu Pann added, “There is no way you can be in the foundry business without Arm.” Indeed, since so many potential foundry customers are using Arm designs.\n\nIntel also updated its chip process technology roadmap, in particular talking up its 14A node coming after 2025. In any case, Intel says it will succeed in its “five nodes in four years” plan by the end of this year, and it claims its 18A node that Microsoft will use to make a chip of its own design will put it ahead of TSMC and Samsung by 2025. Get the full download from Paul Alcorn at Tom’s Hardware.\n\nNo word on Chips Act money yet, but Gelsinger implied it’s coming soon. In a conversation with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Gelsinger circled around Altman’s reported search for $7 trillion in funding for chip plants, but he said that was inaccurate — including not just fabs but data centers and energy among other things — while also saying the demand will be large. “I expect the market for AI compute to be a different kind of good. It’s more like energy, where there’s a certain amount of demand at some price, and less at a higher price,” he said. No promises that he’d hit up Intel for some of that capacity, even if Gelsinger seemed to be offering, but Altman’s presence there was significant.\n\nThe bottom line: Even as Intel faces huge challenges to its ambitious plans, the AI boom and accompanying demand for chips could provide a lifeline for the iconic chipmaker and an opportunity for the U.S. to regain crucial ground in chips. “Overall demand appears to be insatiable for the need for computing for several years into the future,” said Gelsinger, who added that the industry is likely to be capacity-limited in this decade.\n\nAlso on the chip front:\n\nGlobalFoundries receives $1.5B in CHIPS Act funding to expand its fab network\n\nArm announces 3rd Gen Neoverse Compute Subsystems blueprints and expanded design ecosystem\n\nNetwork chip supplier Astera Labs to go public amid rapid sales growth\n\nAustralia’s top supercomputing center deploys Nvidia’s Grace Hopper Superchips for quantum computing research\n\nEarnings\n\nContinuing the familiar pattern (except Nvidia, above, and a couple of others), many enterprise companies saw pretty good earnings, but muted outlooks spooked investors:\n\nPalo Alto Networks strong quarterly performance overshadowed by outlook concerns CEO Nikesh Arora blamed “spending fatigue in cybersecurity,” especially by the government\n\nAmplitude shares drop on mixed quarterly results and lower-than-expected outlooks\n\nRingCentral makes progress toward profitability, but light guidance sends stock lower\n\nFive9 beats on earnings but stock falls on weak first-quarter outlook\n\nSynopsys raises full-year earnings outlook following first-quarter revenue surge\n\nRivian shares tumble 15% amid job cuts and wider quarterly loss\n\nDigitalOcean beats expectations under the helm of new CEO Paddy Srinivasan\n\nBlock’s share rise 13% in late trading after it delivers a surprise profit\n\nExpensify’s shares rose about 4% after-hours after it reported its fourth-quarter net loss more than doubled on a 19% decline in revenue. It held an unusual product roadmap “call” for investors on its own, new Expensify platform that it’s counting on this year.\n\nAI mania with a big-data chaser\n\nRob Strechay and George Gilbert lay out their view on the sixth data platform, with perspective from dbt Labs: Metadata is the glue: federated data silos, metadata and governance\n\nPalo Alto Networks SVP Howie Xu reviews the AI landscape: Inside emerging AI topics, from new investment to open-source models\n\nGartner’s Frances Karamouzis has advice on how enterprises should approach AI: Organizations need a business-driven AI strategy, not a CAIO\n\nWhat could go wrong?
