This new edition has been fully revised and updated and aims to provide a wide variety of information about language and the core vocabulary of current English in a conveniently sized volume and a readily accessible format. The dictionary and thesaurus components are combined in a way that enables quick and easy reference to both: the top section of each page contains the dictionary entries, while the lower section gives matching thesaurus entries for many of the words in the dictionary. The dictionary section is adapted from the 9th edition of the Little Oxford English Dictionary and is based on our analysis of the hundreds of millions of words of real English, taken from books, newspapers, magazines, and the Internet, which are contained in the Oxford English Corpus. The dictionary focuses on clear explanations of meaning together with extra help on aspects of words which often cause difficulties in terms of spelling, pronunciation, grammar, or usage. Individual notes give clear guidance on confusable words (such as accept and except, or flaunt md flouts, on points of good English (for example, whether to say different from or different to), and tricky spellings like Mediterranean, skilful, and weird. Information is presented in clear, concise language, avoiding the use of difficult or technical terms wherever possible. The pronunciations use a simple respelling system which makes them very easy to understand. The thesaurus section is derived from the 3rd edition of the Little Oxford Thesaurus and provides synonyms (words with the same or similar meanings) for around 7,000 entries in the dictionary section. The synonym lists are divided, where appropriate, into numbered senses relating to particular meanings of the word in question so that it is easy to select the sense that matches the context you are looking for. Synonyms are arranged in order of their closeness in meaning to the entry word, with the closest one given first and printed in bold. Words with opposite meanings (known as antonyms') are also provided for many entries.\n\nGuide to the dictionary and thesaurus The dictionary and thesaurus are designed to be as easy to use and understand as possible. Here is an explanation of the main features that you will find in each part of the book.\n\n1. Structure of dictionary entries Part of speech (word class) Headword\n\n_\n\n.

Some words, however, are appropriate only to certain situations (such as an informal conversation) or are found only in certain contexts (for example, in poetry or in official documents). Where this is the case a label (or a combination of labels) is used.\n\nRegister labels Register labels refer to a particular level of use in language. They show that a term is informal or formal, old-fashioned, or technical, and so on. ■ formal:\n\nnormally used only in writing, especially in official documents (e.g. dwelling or deceased)\n\nm\n\nnormally used only in speaking, or in informal writing or email (e.g. gawp or barmy)\n\ninformal:\n\n■ dated:\n\nm\n\nno longer used by most people (e.g. gramophone)\n\nnot in ordinary use today, though sometimes used to give an oldfashioned effect and also found in the literature of the past (e.g. farewell or maiden)\n\nold use:\n\n■ historical:\n\nonly used today to refer to things that are no longer part of modern life (e.g. blunderbuss or doublet)\n\nm\n\nliterary:\n\nfound only or mainly in poems, plays, and novels {e.g. flaxen or\n\nserpent) ■ technical:\n\nnormally used only in technical language (e.g. node or fluvial)\n\n■ humorous: m dialect:\n\nused to sound amusing or playful (e.g. underwhelmed)\n\nused only in certain local regions of the UK (e.g. aye or bide)\n\n■ disapproving: ■ offensive:\n\nmeant to convey a low opinion or to insult someone (e.g. pleb)\n\nlikely to cause offence, whether the person speaking means to or\n\nnot\n\nGeographical labels English is spoken throughout the \\Vorld. While most of the words used in standard British English will be the same as those used in other varieties, there are some words which are only found in one type of English. For example, the normal American word for a lift is elevator. If a word or phrase has the geographical label Brit, in this book, this means that it is used in standard British English but not in American English, although it may be found in other varieties such as Australian English. The labels US and N. Amer., on the other hand, mean that the word or phrase is typically American and is not standard in British English, though it may be found elsewhere.\n\nSubject labels Subject labels are used to show that a word or sense is connected with a particular subject or specialist activity such as Music, Computing, or Rugby.\n\nxi\n\nGuide to the dictionary and thesaurus\n\nCross references A cross reference is a pointer to another entry, where full information on a word will be found. An arrow (as in caftan kaftan) will take you to a different spelling, while an equals sign (as in groundnut = peanut) will take you to a different word that means the same.\n\nPronunciations Pronunciations are given for words which might cause difficulty, but not for everyday words which are assumed to be familiar to everyone (such as table or happy). The part of the pronunciation printed in bold is the syllable that is stressed when the word is spoken.

Their inclusion does not imply that they have acquired for legal purposes a non-proprietary or general significance, nor any other judgement concerning their legal status. In cases where the editorial staff have some evidence that a word has proprietary status this is indicated in the entry for that word by the label trademark, but no judgement concerning the legal status of such words is made or implied thereby.\n\nAa A or a noun\n\n(plural As or A's) the first letter of the alphabet, •abbreviation 1 ampere(s). 2 (A) angstroms. □ A level (in the UK except Scotland) the higher of the two main levels of the GCE exam. a determiner 1 used when mentioning someone or something for the first time; the indefinite article. 2 one single. 3 per.
