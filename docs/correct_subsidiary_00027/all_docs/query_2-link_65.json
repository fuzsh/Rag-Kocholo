It achieves a delay resolution of 4 ns and a maximum delay range of 768 ns. It has a focal-point based architecture, which consists of 7 sub-analog beamformers (sub-ABF). Each sub-ABF performs a RX focusing operation for a single focal point. Seven sub-ABFs perform a time-interleaving operation to achieve the maximum delay range of 768 ns. Phase interpolators are used in sub-ABFs to generate sampling clocks with the delay resolution of 4 ns from a low frequency system clock of 5 MHz. Each sub-ABF samples 32 echo signals at different times into sampling capacitors, which work as analog memory cells. The sampled 32 echo signals of each sub-ABF are originated from one target focal point at one instance. They are summed at one instance in a sub-ABF to perform the RX focusing for the target focal point. The proposed ABF chip has been fabricated in a 0.13- Î¼ m CMOS process with an active area of 16 mm (2). The total power consumption is 287 mW. In measurement, the digital echo signals from a commercial ultrasound medical imaging machine were applied to the fabricated chip through commercial DAC chips. Due to the speed limitation of the DAC chips, the delay resolution was relaxed to 10 ns for the real-time measurement. A linear array transducer with no steering operation is used in this work.\n\nAnalog Ranging Modem Code Processor and Generator\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n1974-05-01\n\nThe report details technical development efforts to implement an analog ranging modem using recently developed linear integrated circuits where possible.

The performance with high linearity and wide input range is usually required for analog four-quadrant multipliers in most applications. Therefore, a highly linear and wide input range four-quadrant CMOS analog multiplier using active feedback is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a novel configuration of four-quadrant multiplier cell is presented. Its input dynamic range and linearity are improved significantly by adding two resistors compared with the conventional structure. Then based on the proposed multiplier cell configuration, a four-quadrant CMOS analog multiplier with active feedback technique is implemented by two operational amplifiers. Because of both the proposed multiplier cell and active feedback technique, the proposed multiplier achieves a much wider input range with higher linearity than conventional structures. The proposed multiplier was fabricated by a 0.6Âµm CMOS process. Experimental results show that the input range of the proposed multiplier can be up to 5.6Vpp with 0.159% linearity error on VX and 4.8Vpp with 0.51% linearity error on VY for Â±2.5V power supply voltages, respectively.\n\nPhotonics-based real-time ultra-high-range-resolution radar with broadband signal generation and processing.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Fangzheng; Guo, Qingshui; Pan, Shilong\n\n2017-10-23\n\nReal-time and high-resolution target detection is highly desirable in modern radar applications. Electronic techniques have encountered grave difficulties in the development of such radars, which strictly rely on a large instantaneous bandwidth. In this article, a photonics-based real-time high-range-resolution radar is proposed with optical generation and processing of broadband linear frequency modulation (LFM) signals. A broadband LFM signal is generated in the transmitter by photonic frequency quadrupling, and the received echo is de-chirped to a low frequency signal by photonic frequency mixing. The system can operate at a high frequency and a large bandwidth while enabling real-time processing by low-speed analog-to-digital conversion and digital signal processing. A conceptual radar is established. Real-time processing of an 8-GHz LFM signal is achieved with a sampling rate of 500 MSa/s. Accurate distance measurement is implemented with a maximum error of 4 mm within a range of ~3.5 meters. Detection of two targets is demonstrated with a range-resolution as high as 1.875âcm. We believe the proposed radar architecture is a reliable solution to overcome the limitations of current radar on operation bandwidth and processing speed, and it is hopefully to be used in future radars for real-time and high-resolution target detection and imaging.\n\nA high-resolution full-field range imaging system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarnegie, D. A.; Cree, M. J.; Dorrington, A. A.\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThere exist a number of applications where the range to all objects in a field of view needs to be obtained. Specific examples include obstacle avoidance for autonomous mobile robots, process automation in assembly factories, surface profiling for shape analysis, and surveying. Ranging systems can be typically characterized as being either laser scanning systems where a laser point is sequentially scanned over a scene or a full-field acquisition where the range to every point in the image is simultaneously obtained. The former offers advantages in terms of range resolution, while the latter tend to be faster and involve no moving parts. We present a system for determining the range to any object within a camera's field of view, at the speed of a full-field system and the range resolution of some point laser scans. Initial results obtained have a centimeter range resolution for a 10 second acquisition time. Modifications to the existing system are discussed that should provide faster results with submillimeter resolution.\n\nDecreasing range resolution of a SAR image to permit correction of motion measurement errors beyond the SAR range resolution\n\nDOEpatents\n\nDoerry, Armin W.; Heard, Freddie E.; Cordaro, J. Thomas\n\n2010-07-20\n\nMotion measurement errors that extend beyond the range resolution of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be corrected by effectively decreasing the range resolution of the SAR in order to permit measurement of the error. Range profiles can be compared across the slow-time dimension of the input data in order to estimate the error. Once the error has been determined, appropriate frequency and phase correction can be applied to the uncompressed input data, after which range and azimuth compression can be performed to produce a desired SAR image.\n\nAn analog gamma correction scheme for high dynamic range CMOS logarithmic image sensors.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Yuan; Pan, Xiaofang; Zhao, Xiaojin; Wu, Huisi\n\n2014-12-15\n\nIn this paper, a novel analog gamma correction scheme with a logarithmic image sensor dedicated to minimize the quantization noise of the high dynamic applications is presented. The proposed implementation exploits a non-linear voltage-controlled-oscillator (VCO) based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to perform the gamma correction during the analog-to-digital conversion. As a result, the quantization noise does not increase while the same high dynamic range of logarithmic image sensor is preserved. Moreover, by combining the gamma correction with the analog-to-digital conversion, the silicon area and overall power consumption can be greatly reduced. The proposed gamma correction scheme is validated by the reported simulation results and the experimental results measured for our designed test structure, which is fabricated with 0.35 Î¼m standard complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process.\n\nAn Analog Gamma Correction Scheme for High Dynamic Range CMOS Logarithmic Image Sensors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCao, Yuan; Pan, Xiaofang; Zhao, Xiaojin; Wu, Huisi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this paper, a novel analog gamma correction scheme with a logarithmic image sensor dedicated to minimize the quantization noise of the high dynamic applications is presented.

The NN architecture consists of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with two inputs, three neurons in the hidden layer, and one output. Depending on the application, the NN output has to resolve the ambiguity due to phase-shift measurement by linearizing the inverse of the square law, or to indicate an output voltage corresponding to the tested surface. This embedded system dedicated to optoelectronic measurements was successfully tested with an analog NN, implemented in 0.35- microm complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, resulting in a threefold increase in the distance range with respect to the one limited by the phase-shift measurement, and by discriminating four types of surfaces (a plastic surface, glossy paper, a painted wall, and a porous surface), at a remote distance between the range finder and the target varying from 0.5 m up to 1.25 m and with a laser beam angle varying between -pi/6 and pi/6 with respect to the target. In this type of application, NN analog implementation provides many advantages, notably use of a small silicon area, low power consumption and no analog-to-digital conversions (ADCs). Nevertheless, digital implementation allows ease of conception and reconfigurability and an embedded weight and bias update. This paper presents the complete measurement system and a comparison between both types of implementation, by developing the advantages and drawbacks relative to each method. An optimized mixed architecture, using both techniques, is then proposed and discussed at the end of the paper.\n\nHigh density, multi-range analog output Versa Module Europa board for control system applications\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSingh, Kundan, E-mail: kundan@iuac.res.in; Das, Ajit Lal\n\n2014-01-15\n\nA new VMEDAC64, 12-bit 64 channel digital-to-analog converter, a Versa Module Europa (VME) module, features 64 analog voltage outputs with user selectable multiple ranges, has been developed for control system applications at Inter University Accelerator Centre. The FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is the module's core, i.e., it implements the DAC control logic and complexity of VMEbus slave interface logic. The VMEbus slave interface and DAC control logic are completely designed and implemented on a single FPGA chip to achieve high density of 64 channels in a single width VME module and will reduce the module count in the controlmoreÂ Â» system applications, and hence will reduce the power consumption and cost of overall system. One of our early design goals was to develop the VME interface such that it can be easily integrated with the peripheral devices and satisfy the timing specifications of VME standard. The modular design of this module reduces the amount of time required to develop other custom modules for control system. The VME slave interface is written as a single component inside FPGA which will be used as a basic building block for any VMEbus interface project. The module offers multiple output voltage ranges depending upon the requirement. The output voltage range can be reduced or expanded by writing range selection bits in the control register. The module has programmable refresh rate and by default hold capacitors in the sample and hold circuit for each channel are charged periodically every 7.040 ms (i.e., update frequency 284 Hz). Each channel has software controlled output switch which disconnects analog output from the field. The modularity in the firmware design on FPGA makes the debugging very easy. On-board DC/DC converters are incorporated for isolated power supply for the analog section of the board.Â«Â less\n\nIntegrated Sedimentological Approach to Assess Reservoir Quality and Architecture of Khuff Carbonates: Outcrop Analog, Central Saudi Arabia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOsman, Mutsim; Abdullatif, Osman\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Permian to Triassic Khuff carbonate reservoirs (and equivalents) in the Middle East are estimated to contain about 38.4% of the world's natural gas reserves. Excellent exposed outcrops in central Saudi Arabia provide good outcrop equivalents to subsurface Khuff reservoirs. This study conduct high resolution outcrop scale investigations on an analog reservoir for upper Khartam of Khuff Formation. The main objective is to reconstruct litho- and chemo- stratigraphic outcrop analog model that may serve to characterize reservoir high resolution (interwell) heterogeneity, continuity and architecture. Given the fact of the limitation of subsurface data and toolsin capturing interwell reservoir heterogeneity, which in turn increases the value of this study.The methods applied integrate sedimentological, stratigraphic petrographic, petrophysical data and chemical analyses for major, trace and rare earth elements. In addition, laser scanning survey (LIDAR) was also utilized in this study. The results of the stratigraphic investigations revealed that the lithofacies range from mudstone, wackestone, packestone and grainstone. These lithofacies represent environments ranging from supratidal, intertidal, subtidal and shoal complex. Several meter-scale and less high resolution sequences and composite sequences within 4th and 5th order cycles were also recognized in the outcrop analog. The lithofacies and architectural analysis revealed several vertically and laterally stacked sequences at the outcrop as revealed from the stratigraphic sections and the lidar scan. Chemostratigraphy is effective in identifying lithofacies and sequences within the outcrop analog. Moreover, different chemical signatures were also recognized and allowed establishing and correlating high resolution lithofacies, reservoir zones, layers and surfaces bounding reservoirs and non-reservoir zones at scale of meters or less. The results of this high resolution outcrop analog study might help to understand\n\nEffects of Resolution, Range, and Image Contrast on Target Acquisition Performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nHollands, Justin G; Terhaar, Phil; Pavlovic, Nada J\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe sought to determine the joint influence of resolution, target range, and image contrast on the detection and identification of targets in simulated naturalistic scenes. Resolution requirements for target acquisition have been developed based on threshold values obtained using imaging systems, when target range was fixed, and image characteristics were determined by the system. Subsequent work has examined the influence of factors like target range and image contrast on target acquisition. We varied the resolution and contrast of static images in two experiments. Participants (soldiers) decided whether a human target was located in the scene (detection task) or whether a target was friendly or hostile (identification task). Target range was also varied (50-400 m). In Experiment 1, 30 participants saw color images with a single target exemplar. In Experiment 2, another 30 participants saw monochrome images containing different target exemplars. The effects of target range and image contrast were qualitatively different above and below 6 pixels per meter of target for both tasks in both experiments. Target detection and identification performance were a joint function of image resolution, range, and contrast for both color and monochrome images. The beneficial effects of increasing resolution for target acquisition performance are greater for closer (larger) targets.\n\nBeyond the resolution limit: subpixel resolution in animals and now in silicon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilcox, M. J.\n\n2007-09-01\n\nAutomatic acquisition of aerial threats at thousands of kilometers distance requires high sensitivity to small differences in contrast and high optical quality for subpixel resolution, since targets occupy much less surface area than a single pixel. Targets travel at high speed and break up in the re-entry phase. Target/decoy discrimination at the earliest possible time is imperative. Real time performance requires a multifaceted approach with hyperspectral imaging and analog processing allowing feature extraction in real time. Hyperacuity Systems has developed a prototype chip capable of nonlinear increase in resolution or subpixel resolution far beyond either pixel size or spacing. Performance increase is due to a biomimetic implementation of animal retinas. Photosensitivity is not homogeneous across the sensor surface, allowing pixel parsing. It is remarkably simple to provide this profile to detectors and we showed at least three ways to do so. Individual photoreceptors have a Gaussian sensitivity profile and this nonlinear profile can be exploited to extract high-resolution. Adaptive, analog circuitry provides contrast enhancement, dynamic range setting with offset and gain control. Pixels are processed in parallel within modular elements called cartridges like photo-receptor inputs in fly eyes. These modular elements are connected by a novel function for a cell matrix known as L4. The system is exquisitely sensitive to small target motion and operates with a robust signal under degraded viewing conditions, allowing detection of targets smaller than a single pixel or at greater distance. Therefore, not only is instantaneous feature extraction possible but also subpixel resolution. Analog circuitry increases processing speed with more accurate motion specification for target tracking and identification.\n\nA Novel Range Compression Algorithm for Resolution Enhancement in GNSS-SARs.\n\nPubMed\n\nZheng, Yu; Yang, Yang; Chen, Wu\n\n2017-06-25\n\nIn this paper, a novel range compression algorithm for enhancing range resolutions of a passive Global Navigation Satellite System-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (GNSS-SAR) is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, within each azimuth bin, firstly range compression is carried out by correlating a reflected GNSS intermediate frequency (IF) signal with a synchronized direct GNSS base-band signal in the range domain. Thereafter, spectrum equalization is applied to the compressed results for suppressing side lobes to obtain a final range-compressed signal. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results have demonstrated that significant range resolution improvement in GNSS-SAR images can be achieved by the proposed range compression algorithm, compared to the conventional range compression algorithm.\n\nA Novel Range Compression Algorithm for Resolution Enhancement in GNSS-SARs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZheng, Yu; Yang, Yang; Chen, Wu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this paper, a novel range compression algorithm for enhancing range resolutions of a passive Global Navigation Satellite System-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (GNSS-SAR) is proposed.

To act as synapses in neuromorphic systems, the memristor needs to exhibit analog resistive switching (RS) behavior with incremental conductance change. In this study, we show that the dynamic range of the analog RS behavior can be significantly enhanced in a tantalum-oxide-based memristor. By controlling different state variables enabled by different physical effects during the RS process, the gradual filament expansion stage can be selectively enhanced without strongly affecting the abrupt filament length growth stage. Detailed physics-based modeling further verified the observed experimental effects and revealed the roles of oxygen vacancy drift and diffusion processes, and how the diffusion process can be selectively enhanced during the filament expansion stage. These findings lead to more desirable and reliable memristor behaviors for analog computing applications. Additionally, the ability to selectively control different internal physical processes demonstrated in the current study provides guidance for continued device optimization of memristor devices in general.\n\nUltrasonic Ranging System With Increased Resolution\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMeyer, William E.; Johnson, William G.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nMaster-oscillator frequency increased.

Such errors are known as element mismatch and are quantified by the integral non-linearity. Element mismatch limits the achievable accuracy and resolution in high-precision applications as it causes gain and offset errors, as well as harmonic distortion. In this article, five existing methods for mitigating the effects of element mismatch are compared: physical level calibration, dynamic element matching, noise-shaping with digital calibration, large periodic high-frequency dithering, and large stochastic high-pass dithering. These methods are suitable for improving accuracy when using digital-to-analog converters that use multiple discrete output levels to reconstruct time-varying signals. The methods improve linearity and therefore reduce harmonic distortion and can be retrofitted to existing systems with minor hardware variations. The performance of each method is compared theoretically and confirmed by simulations and experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that three of the five methods provide significant improvements in the resolution and accuracy when applied to a general-purpose digital-to-analog converter. As such, these methods can directly improve performance in a wide range of applications including nanopositioning, metrology, and optics.\n\nRange and azimuth resolution enhancement for 94 GHz real-beam radar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Guoqing; Yang, Ken; Sykora, Brian; Salha, Imad\n\n2008-04-01\n\nIn this paper, two-dimensional (2D) (range and azimuth) resolution enhancement is investigated for millimeter wave (mmW) real-beam radar (RBR) with linear or non-linear antenna scan in the azimuth dimension. We design a new architecture of super resolution processing, in which a dual-mode approach is used for defining region of interest for 2D resolution enhancement and a combined approach is deployed for obtaining accurate location and amplitude estimations of targets within the region of interest. To achieve 2D resolution enhancement, we first adopt the Capon Beamformer (CB) approach (also known as the minimum variance method (MVM)) to enhance range resolution. A generalized CB (GCB) approach is then applied to azimuth dimension for azimuth resolution enhancement. The GCB approach does not rely on whether the azimuth sampling is even or not and thus can be used in both linear and non-linear antenna scanning modes. The effectiveness of the resolution enhancement is demonstrated by using both simulation and test data. The results of using a 94 GHz real-beam frequency modulation continuous wave (FMCW) radar data show that the overall image quality is significantly improved per visual evaluation and comparison with respect to the original real-beam radar image.\n\nDigitally controlled analog proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for high-speed scanning probe microscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDukic, Maja; Todorov, Vencislav; Andany, Santiago; Nievergelt, Adrian P.; Yang, Chen; Hosseini, Nahid; Fantner, Georg E.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nNearly all scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) contain a feedback controller, which is used to move the scanner in the direction of the z-axis in order to maintain a constant setpoint based on the tip-sample interaction.

Unlike MUSIC based techniques it proved to be very efficient in terms of achieving unambiguous synthetic range profile for ultra-wideband stepped frequency continuous wave radar. Assuming that minimal distance required to separate two targets in depth (distance) corresponds to -3 dB width of received echo, AS provided a 30,8 % improvement in range resolution in analysed scenario, when compared to results of applying IFFT. Output data is far superior in terms of both improved range resolution and reduced side lobe level than used typically in this area Inverse Fourier Transform. Furthermore it does not require prior knowledge or an estimate of number of targets to be detected in a given scan.\n\nNote: Retrofitting an analog spectrometer for high resolving power in NUV-NIR\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaylor, Andrew S.; Batishchev, Oleg V.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe demonstrate how an older spectrometer designed for photographic films can be efficiently retrofitted with a narrow laser-cut slit and a modern Î¼m-pixel-size imaging CMOS camera, yielding sub-pm resolution in the broad near ultraviolet to near infrared (NUV-NIR) spectral range. Resolving power approaching 106 is achieved. Such digital retrofitting of an analog instrument is practical for research and teaching laboratories.\n\nHigh-resolution, large dynamic range fiber-optic thermometer with cascaded Fabry-Perot cavities.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Guigen; Sheng, Qiwen; Hou, Weilin; Han, Ming\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe paradox between a large dynamic range and a high resolution commonly exists in nearly all kinds of sensors. Here, we propose a fiber-optic thermometer based on dual Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs) made from the same material (silicon), but with different cavity lengths, which enables unambiguous recognition of the dense fringes associated with the thick FPI over the free-spectral range determined by the thin FPI. Therefore, the sensor combines the large dynamic range of the thin FPI and the high resolution of the thick FPI. To verify this new concept, a sensor with one 200Â Î¼m thick silicon FPI cascaded by another 10Â Î¼m thick silicon FPI was fabricated. A temperature range of -50Â°C to 130Â°C and a resolution of 6.8Ã10-3Â°C were demonstrated using a simple average wavelength tracking demodulation. Compared to a sensor with only the thick silicon FPI, the dynamic range of the hybrid sensor was more than 10 times larger. Compared to a sensor with only the thin silicon FPI, the resolution of the hybrid sensor was more than 18 times higher.\n\nImpulse radar with swept range gate\n\nDOEpatents\n\nMcEwan, T.E.\n\n1998-09-08\n\nA radar range finder and hidden object locator is based on ultra-wide band radar with a high resolution swept range gate. The device generates an equivalent time amplitude scan with a typical range of 4 inches to 20 feet, and an analog range resolution as limited by a jitter of on the order of 0.01 inches. A differential sampling receiver is employed to effectively eliminate ringing and other aberrations induced in the receiver by the near proximity of the transmit antenna, so a background subtraction is not needed, simplifying the circuitry while improving performance. Techniques are used to reduce clutter in the receive signal, such as decoupling the receive and transmit cavities by placing a space between them, using conductive or radiative damping elements on the cavities, and using terminating plates on the sides of the openings. The antennas can be arranged in a side-by-side parallel spaced apart configuration or in a coplanar opposed configuration which significantly reduces main bang coupling. 25 figs.\n\nElectrostatic artificial eyelid actuator as an analog micromirror device\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGoodwin, Scott H.; Dausch, David E.; Solomon, Steven L.; Lamvik, Michael K.\n\n2005-05-01\n\nAn electrostatic MEMS actuator is described for use as an analog micromirror device (AMD) for high performance, broadband, hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) scene generation. Current state-of-the-art technology is based on resistively heated pixel arrays. As these arrays drive to the higher scene temperatures required by missile defense scenarios, the power required to drive the large format resistive arrays will ultimately become prohibitive. Existing digital micromirrors (DMD) are, in principle, capable of generating the required scene irradiances, but suffer from limited dynamic range, resolution and flicker effects. An AMD would be free of these limitations, and so represents a viable alternative for high performance UV/VIS/IR scene generation. An electrostatic flexible film actuator technology, developed for use as \"artificial eyelid\" shutters for focal plane sensors to protect against damaging radiation, is suitable as an AMD for analog control of projection irradiance. In shutter applications, the artificial eyelid actuator contained radius of curvature as low as 25um and operated at high voltage (>200V). Recent testing suggests that these devices are capable of analog operation as reflective microcantilever mirrors appropriate for scene projector systems. In this case, the device would possess larger radius and operate at lower voltages (20-50V). Additionally, frame rates have been measured at greater than 5kHz for continuous operation. The paper will describe the artificial eyelid technology, preliminary measurements of analog test pixels, and design aspects related to application for scene projection systems. We believe this technology will enable AMD projectors with at least 5122 spatial resolution, non-temporally-modulated output, and pixel response times of <1.25ms.\n\nHigh resolution multi-facies realizations of sedimentary reservoir and aquifer analogs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBayer, Peter; Comunian, Alessandro; HÃ¶yng, Dominik; Mariethoz, Gregoire\n\n2015-01-01\n\nGeological structures are by nature inaccessible to direct observation. This can cause difficulties in applications where a spatially explicit representation of such structures is required, in particular when modelling fluid migration in geological formations. An increasing trend in recent years has been to use analogs to palliate this lack of knowledge, i.e., exploiting the spatial information from sites where the geology is accessible (outcrops, quarry sites) and transferring the observed properties to a study site deemed geologically similar. While this approach is appealing, it is difficult to put in place because of the lack of access to well-documented analog data. In this paper we present comprehensive analog data sets which characterize sedimentary structures from important groundwater hosting formations in Germany and Brazil. Multiple 2-D outcrop faces are described in terms of hydraulic, thermal and chemical properties and interpolated in 3-D using stochastic techniques. These unique data sets can be used by the wider community to implement analog approaches for characterizing reservoir and aquifer formations.

S.; Santos, C.; Garcia-Moya, J. A.; Gutierrez, J. M.; Orfila, B.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nThe Short-Range Ensemble Prediction System (SREPS) is a multi-LAM (UM, HIRLAM, MM5, LM and HRM) multi analysis/boundary conditions (ECMWF, UKMetOffice, DWD and GFS) run twice a day by AEMET (72 hours lead time) over a European domain, with a total of 5 (LAMs) x 4 (GCMs) = 20 members. One of the main goals of this project is analyzing the impact of models and boundary conditions in the short-range high-resolution forecasted precipitation. A previous validation of this method has been done considering a set of climate networks in Spain, France and Germany, by interpolating the prediction to the gauge locations (SREPS, 2008). In this work we compare these results with those obtained by using a statistical downscaling method to post-process the global predictions, obtaining an \"advanced interpolation\" for the local precipitation using climate network precipitation observations. In particular, we apply the PROMETEO downscaling system based on analogs and compare the SREPS ensemble of 20 members with the PROMETEO statistical ensemble of 5 (analog ensemble) x 4 (GCMs) = 20 members. Moreover, we will also compare the performance of a combined approach post-processing the SREPS outputs using the PROMETEO system.

N.; Chougule, D. G.\n\n2010-11-01\n\nSigma-Delta modulation techniques provide a range of opportunities in a signal processing system for both increasing performance and data path optimization along the silicon area axis in the design space. One of the most challenging tasks in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) design is to adapt the circuitry to ever new CMOS process technology. For digital circuits the number of gates per square mm app. doubles per chip generation. Integration of analog parts in newer deep submicron technologies is much more tough and additionally complicated because the usable voltage ranges are decreasing with every new integration step. This paper shows an approach which only uses 2 resistors and 1 capacitor which are located outside a pure digital chip. So all integration advantages of pure digital chips are preserved, there is no design effort for a new chip generation and the ADC also can be used for FPGAs. Resolutions of up to 16 bit are achievable. Sample rates in the 1 MHz region are feasible so that the approach is also useful for ADCs for xDSL technologies.\n\n3D super resolution range-gated imaging for canopy reconstruction and measurement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, Hantao; Wang, Xinwei; Sun, Liang; Lei, Pingshun; Fan, Songtao; Zhou, Yan\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a method of canopy reconstruction and measurement based on 3D super resolution range-gated imaging. In this method, high resolution 2D intensity images are grasped by active gate imaging, and 3D images of canopy are reconstructed by triangular-range-intensity correlation algorithm at the same time. A range-gated laser imaging system(RGLIS) is established based on 808 nm diode laser and gated intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera with 1392Â´1040 pixels. The proof experiments have been performed for potted plants located 75m away and trees located 165m away. The experiments show it that can acquire more than 1 million points per frame, and 3D imaging has the spatial resolution about 0.3mm at the distance of 75m and the distance accuracy about 10 cm. This research is beneficial for high speed acquisition of canopy structure and non-destructive canopy measurement.\n\nBinary/Analog CCD Correlator Development.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1981-07-01\n\narchitecture , design and performance of a general purpose, 1,024-stage, programmable transversal filter implemented in CCD/NMOS technology is described.

Off-ship circuitry is minimized by incorporating both analog and digital support circuitry, on-chip. This results in a monolithic analog signal processing system that has the flexibility to be operated in nine programmable configurations, from 1,024-stages by 1-bit, to 128-stages by 8-bits. The versatility\n\nAnalog synthetic biology.\n\nPubMed\n\nSarpeshkar, R\n\n2014-03-28\n\nWe analyse the pros and cons of analog versus digital computation in living cells. Our analysis is based on fundamental laws of noise in gene and protein expression, which set limits on the energy, time, space, molecular count and part-count resources needed to compute at a given level of precision. We conclude that analog computation is significantly more efficient in its use of resources than deterministic digital computation even at relatively high levels of precision in the cell. Based on this analysis, we conclude that synthetic biology must use analog, collective analog, probabilistic and hybrid analog-digital computational approaches; otherwise, even relatively simple synthetic computations in cells such as addition will exceed energy and molecular-count budgets. We present schematics for efficiently representing analog DNA-protein computation in cells. Analog electronic flow in subthreshold transistors and analog molecular flux in chemical reactions obey Boltzmann exponential laws of thermodynamics and are described by astoundingly similar logarithmic electrochemical potentials. Therefore, cytomorphic circuits can help to map circuit designs between electronic and biochemical domains. We review recent work that uses positive-feedback linearization circuits to architect wide-dynamic-range logarithmic analog computation in Escherichia coli using three transcription factors, nearly two orders of magnitude more efficient in parts than prior digital implementations.\n\nFirst Identification of 5,11-Dideoxytetrodotoxin in Marine Animals, and Characterization of Major Fragment Ions of Tetrodotoxin and Its Analogs by High Resolution ESI-MS/MS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYotsu-Yamashita, Mari; Abe, Yuka; Kudo, Yuta; Ritson-Williams, Raphael; Paul, Valerie J.; Konoki, Keiichi; Cho, Yuko; Adachi, Masaatsu; Imazu, Takuya; Nishikawa, Toshio; Isobe, Minoru\n\n2013-01-01\n\nEven though tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a widespread toxin in marine and terrestrial organisms, very little is known about the biosynthetic pathway used to produce it. By describing chemical structures of natural analogs of TTX, we can start to identify some of the precursors that might be important for TTX biosynthesis. In the present study, an analog of TTX, 5,11-dideoxyTTX, was identified for the first time in natural sources, the ovary of the pufferfish and the pharynx of a flatworm (planocerid sp. 1), by comparison with totally synthesized (â)-5,11-dideoxyTTX, using high resolution ESI-LC-MS. Based on the presence of 5,11-dideoxyTTX together with a series of known deoxy analogs, 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX, 6,11-dideoxyTTX, 11-deoxyTTX, and 5-deoxyTTX, in these animals, we predicted two routes of stepwise oxidation pathways in the late stages of biosynthesis of TTX. Furthermore, high resolution masses of the major fragment ions of TTX, 6,11-dideoxyTTX, and 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX were also measured, and their molecular formulas and structures were predicted to compare them with each other. Although both TTX and 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX give major fragment ions that are very close, m/z 162.0660 and 162.1020, respectively, they are distinguishable and predicted to be different molecular formulas. These data will be useful for identification of TTXs using high resolution LC-MS/MS.

When LAMs are integrated over extended time frames, from months to years, they are prone to deviations in land surface variables that can be harmful to the quality of the simulated near-surface fields. Nudging of the prognostic surface fields toward a reference-gridded data set is therefore devised in order to prevent the atmospheric model from diverging from the expected values. This paper presents a method to generate high-resolution analyses of land-surface variables, such as surface canopy temperature, soil moisture, and snow conditions, to be used for the relaxation of lower boundary conditions in extended-range LAM simulations. The proposed method is based on performing offline simulations with an external surface model, forced with the near-surface meteorological fields derived from short-range forecast, operational analyses, and observed temperatures and humidity. Results show that the outputs of the surface model obtained in the present study have potential to improve the near-surface atmospheric fields in extended-range LAM integrations.\n\nDigital plus analog output encoder\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHafle, R. S. (Inventor)\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThe disclosed encoder is adapted to produce both digital and analog output signals corresponding to the angular position of a rotary shaft, or the position of any other movable member. The digital signals comprise a series of binary signals constituting a multidigit code word which defines the angular position of the shaft with a degree of resolution which depends upon the number of digits in the code word. The basic binary signals are produced by photocells actuated by a series of binary tracks on a code disc or member. The analog signals are in the form of a series of ramp signals which are related in length to the least significant bit of the digital code word. The analog signals are derived from sine and cosine tracks on the code disc.\n\nImprovement of range spatial resolution of medical ultrasound imaging by element-domain signal processing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHasegawa, Hideyuki\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe range spatial resolution is an important factor determining the image quality in ultrasonic imaging. The range spatial resolution in ultrasonic imaging depends on the ultrasonic pulse length, which is determined by the mechanical response of the piezoelectric element in an ultrasonic probe. To improve the range spatial resolution without replacing the transducer element, in the present study, methods based on maximum likelihood (ML) estimation and multiple signal classification (MUSIC) were proposed. The proposed methods were applied to echo signals received by individual transducer elements in an ultrasonic probe. The basic experimental results showed that the axial half maximum of the echo from a string phantom was improved from 0.21 mm (conventional method) to 0.086 mm (ML) and 0.094 mm (MUSIC).\n\nHigh-range resolution spectral analysis of precipitation through range imaging of the Chung-Li VHF radar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTsai, Shih-Chiao; Chen, Jenn-Shyong; Chu, Yen-Hsyang; Su, Ching-Lun; Chen, Jui-Hsiang\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMulti-frequency range imaging (RIM) has been operated in the Chung-Li very high-frequency (VHF) radar, located on the campus of National Central University, Taiwan, since 2008. RIM processes the echo signals with a group of closely spaced transmitting frequencies through appropriate inversion methods to obtain high-resolution distribution of echo power in the range direction. This is beneficial to the investigation of the small-scale structure embedded in dynamic atmosphere. Five transmitting frequencies were employed in the radar experiment for observation of the precipitating atmosphere during the period between 21 and 23 August 2013. Using the Capon and Fourier methods, the radar echoes were synthesized to retrieve the temporal signals at a smaller range step than the original range resolution defined by the pulse width, and such retrieved temporal signals were then processed in the Doppler frequency domain to identify the atmosphere and precipitation echoes. An analysis called conditional averaging was further executed for echo power, Doppler velocity, and spectral width to verify the potential capabilities of the retrieval processing in resolving small-scale precipitation and atmosphere structures. Point-by-point correction of range delay combined with compensation of range-weighting function effect has been performed during the retrieval of temporal signals to improve the continuity of power spectra at gate boundaries, making the small-scale structures in the power spectra more natural and reasonable. We examined stratiform and convective precipitation and demonstrated their different structured characteristics by means of the Capon-processed results. The new element in this study is the implementation of RIM on spectral analysis, especially for precipitation echoes.\n\nHigh resolution Cerenkov and range detectors for balloon-borne cosmic-ray experiment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAhlen, S. P.; Cartwright, B. G.; Tarle, G.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nA combination of an active Cerenkov detector and passive range detectors is proposed for the high resolution measurement of isotopic composition in the neighborhood of iron in the galactic cosmic rays. A large area (4,300 sq cm) Cerenkov counter and passive range detectors were tested. Tests with heavy ions (2.1 GeV/amu C-12, 289 MeV/amu Ar-40, and 594 MeV/amu Ne-20) revealed the spatial uniformity of response of the Cerenkov counter to be better than 1% peak-to-peak. Light collection efficiency is independent of projectile energy and incidence angle to within at least 0.5%. Passive Lexan track recorders to measure range in the presence of the nuclear interaction background which results from stopping particles through 0.9 interaction lengths of matter were also tested. It was found that nuclear interactions produce an effective range straggling distribution only approximately 75% wider than that expected from range straggling alone. The combination of these tested techniques makes possible high mass resolution in the neighborhood of iron.\n\nA digital-type fluxgate magnetometer using a sigma-delta digital-to-analog converter for a sounding rocket experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIguchi, Kyosuke; Matsuoka, Ayako\n\n2014-07-01\n\nOne of the design challenges for future magnetospheric satellite missions is optimizing the mass, size, and power consumption of the instruments to meet the mission requirements. We have developed a digital-type fluxgate (DFG) magnetometer that is anticipated to have significantly less mass and volume than the conventional analog-type. Hitherto, the lack of a space-grade digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with good accuracy has prevented the development of a high-performance DFG. To solve this problem, we developed a high-resolution DAC using parts whose performance was equivalent to existing space-grade parts. The developed DAC consists of a 1-bit second-order sigma-delta modulator and a fourth-order analog low-pass filter. We tested the performance of the DAC experimentally and found that it had better than 17-bits resolution in 80% of the measurement range, and the linearity error was 2-13.3 of the measurement range. We built a DFG flight model (in which this DAC was embedded) for a sounding rocket experiment as an interim step in the development of a future satellite mission. The noise of this DFG was 0.79 nTrms at 0.1-10 Hz, which corresponds to a roughly 17-bit resolution. The results show that the sigma-delta DAC and the DFG had a performance that is consistent with our optimized design, and the noise was as expected from the noise simulation. Finally, we have confirmed that the DFG worked successfully during the flight of the sounding rocket.\n\nFundamental Constraints on the Coherence of Probing Signals in the Problem of Maximizing the Resolution and Range in the Stroboscopic Range of Asteroids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZakharchenko, V. D.; Kovalenko, I. G.; Pak, O. V.; Ryzhkov, V. Yu.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe problem of coherence violation in stroboscopic ranging with a high resolution in the range due to mutual phase instability of probing and reference radio signals has been considered. It has been shown that the violation of coherence in stroboscopic ranging systems is equivalent to the action of modulating interface and leads to a decrease in the system sensitivity. Requirements have been formulated for the coherence of reference generators in the stroboscopic processing system. The results of statistical modeling have been presented. It was shown that, in the current state of technology with stability of the frequencies of the reference generators, the achieved coherence is sufficient to probe asteroids with super-resolving signals in the range of up to 70 million kilometers. In this case, the dispersion of the signal in cosmic plasma limits the value of the linear resolution of the asteroid details at this range by the value of 2.7 m. Comparison with the current radar resolution of asteroids has been considered, which, at the end of 2015, were 7.5 m in the range of 7 million kilometers.\n\nImproved laser-based triangulation sensor with enhanced range and resolution through adaptive optics-based active beam control.\n\nPubMed\n\nReza, Syed Azer; Khwaja, Tariq Shamim; Mazhar, Mohsin Ali; Niazi, Haris Khan; Nawab, Rahma\n\n2017-07-20\n\nVarious existing target ranging techniques are limited in terms of the dynamic range of operation and measurement resolution. These limitations arise as a result of a particular measurement methodology, the finite processing capability of the hardware components deployed within the sensor module, and the medium through which the target is viewed. Generally, improving the sensor range adversely affects its resolution and vice versa. Often, a distance sensor is designed for an optimal range/resolution setting depending on its intended application. Optical triangulation is broadly classified as a spatial-signal-processing-based ranging technique and measures target distance from the location of the reflected spot on a position sensitive detector (PSD). In most triangulation sensors that use lasers as a light source, beam divergence-which severely affects sensor measurement range-is often ignored in calculations. In this paper, we first discuss in detail the limitations to ranging imposed by beam divergence, which, in effect, sets the sensor dynamic range. Next, we show how the resolution of laser-based triangulation sensors is limited by the interpixel pitch of a finite-sized PSD. In this paper, through the use of tunable focus lenses (TFLs), we propose a novel design of a triangulation-based optical rangefinder that improves both the sensor resolution and its dynamic range through adaptive electronic control of beam propagation parameters. We present the theory and operation of the proposed sensor and clearly demonstrate a range and resolution improvement with the use of TFLs. Experimental results in support of our claims are shown to be in strong agreement with theory.\n\nA review on high-resolution CMOS delay lines: towards sub-picosecond jitter performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdulrazzaq, Bilal I; Abdul Halin, Izhal; Kawahito, Shoji; Sidek, Roslina M; Shafie, Suhaidi; Yunus, Nurul Amziah Md\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA review on CMOS delay lines with a focus on the most frequently used techniques for high-resolution delay step is presented. The primary types, specifications, delay circuits, and operating principles are presented. The delay circuits reported in this paper are used for delaying digital inputs and clock signals. The most common analog and digitally-controlled delay elements topologies are presented, focusing on the main delay-tuning strategies. IC variables, namely, process, supply voltage, temperature, and noise sources that affect delay resolution through timing jitter are discussed. The design specifications of these delay elements are also discussed and compared for the common delay line circuits. As a result, the main findings of this paper are highlighting and discussing the followings: the most efficient high-resolution delay line techniques, the trade-off challenge found between CMOS delay lines designed using either analog or digitally-controlled delay elements, the trade-off challenge between delay resolution and delay range and the proposed solutions for this challenge, and how CMOS technology scaling can affect the performance of CMOS delay lines.

In the paper, we demonstrate an extended DOF without sacrificing resolution showing rotational images in biological tubular samples with 2.5 Î¼m axial resolution, 10 Ã¬m lateral resolution, and > 4 mm depth range using a custom designed probe.\n\nUltra-high resolution AMOLED\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWacyk, Ihor; Prache, Olivier; Ghosh, Amal\n\n2011-06-01\n\nAMOLED microdisplays continue to show improvement in resolution and optical performance, enhancing their appeal for a broad range of near-eye applications such as night vision, simulation and training, situational awareness, augmented reality, medical imaging, and mobile video entertainment and gaming. eMagin's latest development of an HDTV+ resolution technology integrates an OLED pixel of 3.2 Ã 9.6 microns in size on a 0.18 micron CMOS backplane to deliver significant new functionality as well as the capability to implement a 1920Ã1200 microdisplay in a 0.86\" diagonal area. In addition to the conventional matrix addressing circuitry, the HDTV+ display includes a very lowpower, low-voltage-differential-signaling (LVDS) serialized interface to minimize cable and connector size as well as electromagnetic emissions (EMI), an on-chip set of look-up-tables for digital gamma correction, and a novel pulsewidth- modulation (PWM) scheme that together with the standard analog control provides a total dimming range of 0.05cd/m2 to 2000cd/m2 in the monochrome version. The PWM function also enables an impulse drive mode of operation that significantly reduces motion artifacts in high speed scene changes. An internal 10-bit DAC ensures that a full 256 gamma-corrected gray levels are available across the entire dimming range, resulting in a measured dynamic range exceeding 20-bits. This device has been successfully tested for operation at frame rates ranging from 30Hz up to 85Hz. This paper describes the operational features and detailed optical and electrical test results for the new AMOLED WUXGA resolution microdisplay.\n\nRange-Specific High-Resolution Mesoscale Model Setup: Data Assimilation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWatson, Leela R.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMesoscale weather conditions can have an adverse effect on space launch, landing, and ground processing at the Eastern Range (ER) in Florida and Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) in Virginia. During summer, land-sea interactions across Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) lead to sea breeze front formation, which can spawn deep convection that can hinder operations and endanger personnel and resources. Many other weak locally driven low-level boundaries and their interactions with the sea breeze front and each other can also initiate deep convection in the KSC/CCAFS area. Some of these other boundaries include the Indian River breeze front, Banana River breeze front, outflows from previous convection, horizontal convective rolls, convergence lines from other inland bodies of water such as Lake Okeechobee, the trailing convergence line from convergence of sea breeze fronts due to the shape of Cape Canaveral, frictional convergence lines from the islands in the Bahamas, convergence lines from soil moisture differences, convergence lines from cloud shading, and others. All these subtle weak boundary interactions often make forecasting of operationally important weather very difficult at KSC/CCAFS during the convective season (May-Oct). These convective processes often build quickly, last a short time (60 minutes or less), and occur over small distances, all of which also poses a significant challenge to the local forecasters who are responsible for issuing weather advisories, watches, and warnings. Surface winds during the transition seasons of spring and fall pose the most difficulties for the forecasters at WFF. They also encounter problems forecasting convective activity and temperature during those seasons. Therefore, accurate mesoscale model forecasts are needed to aid in their decision making. Both the ER and WFF would benefit greatly from high-resolution mesoscale model output to better forecast a variety of unique weather\n\nChemical speciation using high energy resolution PIXE spectroscopy in the tender X-ray range\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKavÄiÄ, MatjaÅ¾; Petric, Marko; Vogel-MikuÅ¡, Katarina\n\n2018-02-01\n\nHigh energy resolution X-ray emission spectroscopy employing wavelength dispersive (WDS) crystal spectrometers can provide energy resolution on the level of core-hole lifetime broadening of the characteristic emission lines. While crystal spectrometers have been traditionally used in combination with electron excitation for major and minor element analysis, they have been rarely considered in proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE) trace element analysis mainly due to low detection efficiency. Compared to the simplest flat crystal WDS spectrometer the efficiency can be improved by employing cylindrically or even spherically curved crystals in combination with position sensitive X-ray detectors. When such spectrometer is coupled to MeV proton excitation, chemical bonding effects are revealed in the high energy resolution spectra yielding opportunity to extend the analytical capabilities of PIXE technique also towards chemical state analysis. In this contribution we will focus on the high energy resolution PIXE (HR-PIXE) spectroscopy in the tender X-ray range performed in our laboratory with our home-built tender X-ray emission spectrometer. Some general properties of high energy resolution PIXE spectroscopy in the tender X-ray range are presented followed by an example of sulfur speciation in biological tissue illustrating the capabilities as well as limitations of HR-PIXE method used for chemical speciation in the tender X-ray range.\n\nRobust mosiacs of close-range high-resolution images\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSong, Ran; Szymanski, John E.\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThis paper presents a robust algorithm which relies only on the information contained within the captured images for the construction of massive composite mosaic images from close-range and high-resolution originals, such as those obtained when imaging architectural and heritage structures. We first apply Harris algorithm to extract a selection of corners and, then, employ both the intensity correlation and the spatial correlation between the corresponding corners for matching them. Then we estimate the eight-parameter projective transformation matrix by the genetic algorithm. Lastly, image fusion using a weighted blending function together with intensity compensation produces an effective seamless mosaic image.\n\nAnalog signal processing for optical coherence imaging systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Wei\n\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence microscopy (OCM) are non-invasive optical coherence imaging techniques, which enable micron-scale resolution, depth resolved imaging capability. Both OCT and OCM are based on Michelson interferometer theory. They are widely used in ophthalmology, gastroenterology and dermatology, because of their high resolution, safety and low cost. OCT creates cross sectional images whereas OCM obtains en face images. In this dissertation, the design and development of three increasingly complicated analog signal processing (ASP) solutions for optical coherence imaging are presented. The first ASP solution was implemented for a time domain OCT system with a Rapid Scanning Optical Delay line (RSOD)-based optical signal modulation and logarithmic amplifier (Log amp) based demodulation. This OCT system can acquire up to 1600 A-scans per second. The measured dynamic range is 106dB at 200A-scan per second. This OCT signal processing electronics includes an off-the-shelf filter box with a Log amp circuit implemented on a PCB board. The second ASP solution was developed for an OCM system with synchronized modulation and demodulation and compensation for interferometer phase drift. This OCM acquired micron-scale resolution, high dynamic range images at acquisition speeds up to 45,000 pixels/second. This OCM ASP solution is fully custom designed on a perforated circuit board. The third ASP solution was implemented on a single 2.2 mm x 2.2 mm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip. This design is expandable to a multiple channel OCT system. A single on-chip CMOS photodetector and ASP channel was used for coherent demodulation in a time domain OCT system. Cross-sectional images were acquired with a dynamic range of 76dB (limited by photodetector responsivity). When incorporated with a bump-bonded InGaAs photodiode with higher responsivity, the expected dynamic range is close to 100dB.\n\nElectrically optofluidic zoom system with a large zoom range and high-resolution image.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Lei; Yuan, Rong-Ying; Wang, Jin-Hui; Wang, Qiong-Hua\n\n2017-09-18\n\nWe report an electrically controlled optofluidic zoom system which can achieve a large continuous zoom change and high-resolution image. The zoom system consists of an optofluidic zoom objective and a switchable light path which are controlled by two liquid optical shutters. The proposed zoom system can achieve a large tunable focal length range from 36mm to 92mm. And in this tuning range, the zoom system can correct aberrations dynamically, thus the image resolution is high. Due to large zoom range, the proposed imaging system incorporates both camera configuration and telescope configuration into one system. In addition, the whole system is electrically controlled by three electrowetting liquid lenses and two liquid optical shutters, therefore, the proposed system is very compact and free of mechanical moving parts. The proposed zoom system has potential to take place of conventional zoom systems.\n\nA full range detector for the HIRRBS high resolution RBS magnetic spectrometer\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSkala, Wayne G.; Haberl, Arthur W.; Bakhru, Hassaram\n\n2013-04-19\n\nThe UAlbany HIRRBS (High Resolution RBS) system has been updated for better use in rapid analysis. The focal plane detector now covers the full range from U down to O using a linear stepper motor to translate the 1-cm detector across the 30-cm range. Input is implemented with zero-back-angle operation in all cases. The chamber has been modified to allow for quick swapping of sample holders, including a channeling goniometer. A fixed standard surface-barrier detector allows for normal RBS simultaneously with use of the magnetic spectrometer. The user can select a region on the standard spectrum or can select anmoreÂ Â» element edge or an energy point for collection of the expanded spectrum portion. The best resolution currently obtained is about 2-to-3 keV, probably representing the energy width of the incoming beam. Calibration is maintained automatically for any spectrum portion and any beam energy from 1.0 to 3.5 MeV. Element resolving power, sensitivity and depth resolution are shown using several examples. Examples also show the value of simultaneous conventional RBS.Â«Â less\n\nTowards large dynamic range and ultrahigh measurement resolution in distributed fiber sensing based on multicore fiber.\n\nPubMed\n\nDang, Yunli; Zhao, Zhiyong; Tang, Ming; Zhao, Can; Gan, Lin; Fu, Songnian; Liu, Tongqing; Tong, Weijun; Shum, Perry Ping; Liu, Deming\n\n2017-08-21\n\nFeaturing a dependence of Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) on temperature and strain changes over a wide range, Brillouin distributed optical fiber sensors are however essentially subjected to the relatively poor temperature/strain measurement resolution. On the other hand, phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (Î¦-OTDR) offers ultrahigh temperature/strain measurement resolution, but the available frequency scanning range is normally narrow thereby severely restricts its measurement dynamic range. In order to achieve large dynamic range and high measurement resolution simultaneously, we propose to employ both the Brillouin optical time domain analysis (BOTDA) and Î¦-OTDR through space-division multiplexed (SDM) configuration based on the multicore fiber (MCF), in which the two sensors are spatially separately implemented in the central core and a side core, respectively. As a proof of concept, the temperature sensing has been performed for validation with 2.5 m spatial resolution over 1.565 km MCF. Large temperature range (10 Â°C) has been measured by BOTDA and the 0.1 Â°C small temperature variation is successfully identified by Î¦-OTDR with ~0.001 Â°C resolution. Moreover, the temperature changing process has been recorded by continuously performing the measurement of Î¦-OTDR with 80 s frequency scanning period, showing about 0.02 Â°C temperature spacing at the monitored profile. The proposed system enables the capability to see finer and/or farther upon requirement in distributed optical fiber sensing.\n\nExtended-Range High-Resolution Dynamical Downscaling over a Continental-Scale Domain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHusain, S. Z.; Separovic, L.; Yu, W.; Fernig, D.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nHigh-resolution mesoscale simulations, when applied for downscaling meteorological fields over large spatial domains and for extended time periods, can provide valuable information for many practical application scenarios including the weather-dependent renewable energy industry. In the present study, a strategy has been proposed to dynamically downscale coarse-resolution meteorological fields from Environment Canada's regional analyses for a period of multiple years over the entire Canadian territory. The study demonstrates that a continuous mesoscale simulation over the entire domain is the most suitable approach in this regard. Large-scale deviations in the different meteorological fields pose the biggest challenge for extended-range simulations over continental scale domains, and the enforcement of the lateral boundary conditions is not sufficient to restrict such deviations. A scheme has therefore been developed to spectrally nudge the simulated high-resolution meteorological fields at the different model vertical levels towards those embedded in the coarse-resolution driving fields derived from the regional analyses. A series of experiments were carried out to determine the optimal nudging strategy including the appropriate nudging length scales, nudging vertical profile and temporal relaxation. A forcing strategy based on grid nudging of the different surface fields, including surface temperature, soil-moisture, and snow conditions, towards their expected values obtained from a high-resolution offline surface scheme was also devised to limit any considerable deviation in the evolving surface fields due to extended-range temporal integrations. The study shows that ensuring large-scale atmospheric similarities helps to deliver near-surface statistical scores for temperature, dew point temperature and horizontal wind speed that are better or comparable to the operational regional forecasts issued by Environment Canada. Furthermore, the meteorological fields\n\nMEMS analog light processing: an enabling technology for adaptive optical phase control\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGehner, Andreas; Wildenhain, Michael; Neumann, Hannes; Knobbe, Jens; Komenda, Ondrej\n\n2006-01-01\n\nVarious applications in modern optics are demanding for Spatial Light Modulators (SLM) with a true analog light processing capability, e.g. the generation of arbitrary analog phase patterns for an adaptive optical phase control. For that purpose the Fraunhofer IPMS has developed a high-resolution MEMS Micro Mirror Array (MMA) with an integrated active-matrix CMOS address circuitry. The device provides 240 x 200 piston-type mirror elements with 40 Î¼m pixel size, where each of them can be addressed and deflected independently at an 8bit height resolution with a vertical analog deflection range of up to 400 nm suitable for a 2pi phase modulation in the visible. Full user programmability and control is provided by a newly developed comfortable driver software for Windows XP based PCs supporting both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for stand-alone operation with pre-defined data patterns as well as an open ActiveX programming interface for a direct data feed-through within a closed-loop environment. High-speed data communication is established by an IEEE1394a FireWire interface together with an electronic driving board performing the actual MMA programming and control at a maximum frame rate of up to 500 Hz. Successful application demonstrations have been given in eye aberration correction, coupling efficiency optimization into a monomode fiber, ultra-short laser pulse modulation and diffractive beam shaping. Besides a presentation of the basic device concept the paper will give an overview of the obtained results from these applications.\n\nFITPix COMBOâTimepix detector with integrated analog signal spectrometric readout\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolik, M.; Kraus, V.; Georgiev, V.; Granja, C.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe hybrid semiconductor pixel detector Timepix has proven a powerful tool in radiation detection and imaging. Energy loss and directional sensitivity as well as particle type resolving power are possible by high resolution particle tracking and per-pixel energy and quantum-counting capability. The spectrometric resolving power of the detector can be further enhanced by analyzing the analog signal of the detector common sensor electrode (also called back-side pulse). In this work we present a new compact readout interface, based on the FITPix readout architecture, extended with integrated analog electronics for the detector's common sensor signal. Integrating simultaneous operation of the digital per-pixel information with the common sensor (called also back-side electrode) analog pulse processing circuitry into one device enhances the detector capabilities and opens new applications. Thanks to noise suppression and built-in electromagnetic interference shielding the common hardware platform enables parallel analog signal spectroscopy on the back side pulse signal with full operation and read-out of the pixelated digital part, the noise level is 600 keV and spectrometric resolution around 100 keV for 5.5 MeV alpha particles. Self-triggering is implemented with delay of few tens of ns making use of adjustable low-energy threshold of the particle analog signal amplitude. The digital pixelated full frame can be thus triggered and recorded together with the common sensor analog signal. The waveform, which is sampled with frequency 100 MHz, can be recorded in adjustable time window including time prior to the trigger level. An integrated software tool provides control, on-line display and read-out of both analog and digital channels. Both the pixelated digital record and the analog waveform are synchronized and written out by common time stamp.\n\nA Systematic Evaluation of Analogs and Automated Read ...\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nRead-across is a data gap filling technique widely used within category and analog approaches to predict a biological property for a data-poor (target) chemical using known information from similar (source analog) chemical(s). Potential source analogs are typically identified based on structural similarity. Although much guidance has been published for read-across, practical principles for the identification and evaluation of the scientific validity of source analogs remains lacking. This case study explores how well 3 structure descriptor sets (Pubchem, Chemotyper and MoSS) are able to identify analogs for read-across and predict Estrogen Receptor (ER) binding activity for a specific class of chemicals: hindered phenols. For each target chemical, analogs were selected using each descriptor set with two cut-offs: (1) Minimum Tanimoto similarity (range 0.1 - 0.9), and (2) Closest N analogs (range 1 - 10). Each target-analog pair was then evaluated for its agreement with measured ER binding and agonism. The analogs were subsequently filtered using: (1) physchem properties (LogKow & Molecular Volume), and (2) number of literature sources as a marker for the quality of the experimental data. A majority vote prediction was made for each target phenol by reading-across from the closest N analogs. The data set comprised 462 hindered phenols and 257 non-hindered phenols. The results demonstrate that: (1) The concordance in ER activity rises with increasing similarity,\n\nNote: Increasing dynamic range of digital-to-analog converter using a superconducting quantum interference device\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNakanishi, Masakazu, E-mail: m.nakanishi@aist.go.jp\n\nResponses of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) are periodically dependent on magnetic flux coupling to its superconducting ring and the period is a flux quantum (Î¦{sub o} = h/2e, where h and e, respectively, express Planck's constant and elementary charge). Using this periodicity, we had proposed a digital to analog converter using a SQUID (SQUID DAC) of first generation with linear current output, interval of which corresponded to Î¦{sub o}. Modification for increasing dynamic range by interpolating within each interval is reported. Linearity of the interpolation was also based on the quantum periodicity. A SQUID DAC with dynamic rangemoreÂ Â» of about 1.4 Ã 10{sup 7} was created as a demonstration.Â«Â less\n\nReasoning by analogy as an aid to heuristic theorem proving.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKling, R. E.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nWhen heuristic problem-solving programs are faced with large data bases that contain numbers of facts far in excess of those needed to solve any particular problem, their performance rapidly deteriorates. In this paper, the correspondence between a new unsolved problem and a previously solved analogous problem is computed and invoked to tailor large data bases to manageable sizes. This paper outlines the design of an algorithm for generating and exploiting analogies between theorems posed to a resolution-logic system. These algorithms are believed to be the first computationally feasible development of reasoning by analogy to be applied to heuristic theorem proving.\n\nHigh resolution data acquisition\n\nDOEpatents\n\nThornton, G.W.; Fuller, K.R.\n\n1993-04-06\n\nA high resolution event interval timing system measures short time intervals such as occur in high energy physics or laser ranging.

We show that, in a one-dimensional habitat, these founder events are the spatial analog of genetic drift in a randomly mating population. The spatial series of allele frequencies created by successive founder events is equivalent to the time series of allele frequencies in a population of effective size ke, the effective number of founders. We derive an expression for ke in a discrete-population model that allows for local population growth and migration among established populations. If there is selection, the net effect is determined approximately by the product of the selection coefficients and the number of generations between successive founding events. We use the model of a single population to compute analytically several quantities for an allele present in the source population: (i) the probability that it survives the series of colonization events, (ii) the probability that it reaches a specified threshold frequency in the last population, and (iii) the mean and variance of the frequencies in each population. We show that the analytic theory provides a good approximation to simulation results. A consequence of our approximation is that the average heterozygosity of neutral alleles decreases by a factor of 1âââ1/(2ke) in each new population. Therefore, the population genetic consequences of surfing can be predicted approximately by the effective number of founders and the effective selection coefficients, even in the presence of migration among populations. We also show that our analytic results are applicable to a model of range expansion in a continuously distributed population.

As a subranging circuit, the circuit produces a residual signal representing the difference between an analog input signal and an analog of a digital representation. This is achieved by subdividing the digital representation into two or more parts and subtracting from the analog input signal analogs of each of the individual digital portions. In another aspect of the present invention, the subranging circuit comprises two sets of differential input pairs in which the transconductance of one differential input pair is scaled relative to the transconductance of the other differential input pair. As a consequence, the same resistor string may be used for two different digital-to-analog converters of the subranging circuit.\n\nData collection and simulation of high range resolution laser radar for surface mine detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSteinvall, Ove; Chevalier, Tomas; Larsson, HÃ¥kan\n\n2006-05-01\n\nRapid and efficient detection of surface mines, IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices) and UXO (Unexploded Ordnance) is of high priority in military conflicts.
