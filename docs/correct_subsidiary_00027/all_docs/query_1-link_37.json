        "text": "Will Enable Second Generation 400 Gbps Capable of Longer Distances\n\nIn late 2018, Barefoot networks publicly announced the first ever 7nm plus chiplet switch ASIC product â€“ the Tofino 2 chip. This is the start of a market transformation as Ethernet Switch design will begin to embrace disaggregation (such as the chiplet type design) much like the rest of data center market. We will see strong product demonstrations at OFC, OCP, and numerous other shows throughout 2019 as the ecosystem gears up for this important architecture shift. With 7nm available from major foundries, the market will begin to move in this heterogenous direction as a way to higher capacity switch silicon. Not only will this pave the way for 25.6 Tbps and 51.2 Tbps fabrics, we will see increased product agility, lower cost, better power, and more products offerings from chiplet design.\n\nClick here to read more ..."
