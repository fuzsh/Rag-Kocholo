        "text": "Overview\n\nCadence Design Systems, headquartered in San Jose, California, is a supplier of electronic design technologies and engineering services in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. The company develops software used to design chips and printed circuit boards, as well as intellectual properties (IP) covering a broad range of areas, including interfaces, memory, analog, SoC peripherals, dataplane processing units, and verification.\n\nCadence products primarily target SoC design engineers, and are used to move a design into packaged silicon, with products for custom and analog design, digital design, mixed-signal design, verification, and package/PCB design, as well as a broad selection of IP, and also hardware for emulation and FPGA prototyping.\n\nTo help integrate, verify, and implement complex digital SoCs, there are solutions that encompass design IP, timing analysis and signoff, services, and tools and methodologies. The company also provides products that assist with the development of complete hardware and software platforms that support end applications.\n\nHistory\n\nCadence Design Systems was the result of a merger perfected in 1988 of Solomon Design Automation (SDA), co-founded in 1983 by Richard Newton, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli and James Solomon, and ECAD, co-founded by Glen Antle and Paul Huang in 1982. Joseph Costello was appointed as CEO from 1988â€“1997, and Cadence became the largest EDA company during his tenure.\n\nFollowing Costello as CEO were Jack Harding (from 1997-99), Ray Bingham (from 1999-2005), and Mike Fister (from 2005-2008).\n\nFollowing the resignation of Fister, the board appointed Lip-Bu Tan as acting CEO. In January 2009, the company confirmed Lip-Bu Tan as President and CEO. Tan had been most recently CEO of Walden International, a venture capital firm, and remains chairman of the firm. He has served on the Cadence Board of Directors since 2004, where he served on the Technology Committee for four years.\n\nIn 2013, Cadence celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 2015 it was named one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune magazine.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the company employed more than 7,100 people and reported 2016 revenues of approximately $1.82 billion. In November 2007 Cadence was named one of the \"50 Best Places to Work in Silicon Valley\" by San Jose Magazine.\n\nProducts\n\nCadence's product offerings are targeted at various types of design and verification tasks which include:\n\nVirtuoso Platform - Tools for designing full-custom integrated circuits; includes schematic entry, behavioral modeling (Verilog-AMS), circuit simulation, custom layout, physical verification, extraction and back-annotation. Used mainly for analog, mixed-signal, RF, and standard-cell designs, but also memory and FPGA designs.\n\nRTL to GDS II implementation and signoff: Genus Synthesis, Joules Power Analysis, Innovus Place & Route, Tempus Timing SIgnoff, Voltus Power Integrity Signoff, Modus Automatic Test Pattern Generation.\n\nVerification Platform consisting of JasperGold Formal Verification, Incisive SImulation, Palladium Z1 emulation, Protium FPGA prototyping.\n\nDesign IP - Cadence provides design IP targeting areas including memory (DRAM), covering DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, LPDDR2, LPDDR3, LPDDR4, and Wide I/O; storage (non-volatile memory), covering NVM Express and NAND Flash controller and PHY; and high-performance interface protocols such as PCI Express Gen3 and 4, 40/100G Ethernet, and USB 2 and USB 3.\n\nTensilica DSP processors for audio, vision, wireless modems and convolutional neural nets.\n\nVerification IP (VIP) - Cadence provides the a set of commercial VIP available with over 30 protocols in its VIP Portfolio. They include AMBA, PCI Express, USB, SATA, OCP, SAS, MIPI and many others.\n\nIntegration Optimized IP (Design IP) - Cadence offers Vertically Integrated IP, inclusive of Digital Controller, Serdes Layer, and Device Driver. Protocols supported include USB, DDR, PCI-Express, 10G-40G Ethernet, and On Chip Bus Fabric.\n\nAllegro Platform - Tools for co-design of integrated circuits, packages, and PCBs.\n\nOrCAD/PSpice - Tools for smaller design teams and individual PCB designers.\n\nSigrity technologies - Tools for signal and power verification for system-level signoff verification and interface compliance.\n\nIn addition to EDA software, Cadence provides contracted methodology and design services as well as silicon design IP, and has a program aimed at making it easier for other EDA software to interoperate with the company's tools.\n\nAvanti Corporation\n\nCadence was involved in a 6-year-long legal dispute with Avanti Corporation, in which Cadence claimed Avant! stole Cadence code, and Avant! denied it. According to Business Week \"The Avant! case is probably the most dramatic tale of white-collar crime in the history of Silicon Valley\". The Avant! executives eventually pleaded no contest and Cadence received several hundred million dollars in restitution. Avant! was then purchased by Synopsys, which paid $265 million more to settle the remaining claims. The case resulted in a number of legal precedents.\n\nMentor Graphics\n\nThe Cadence group Quickturn was also involved in a series of legal events with Mentor Graphics/Aptix. Mentor purchased rights to an Aptix patent, then sued Cadence. In this case, the CEO of Aptix, Amr Mohsen, forged a notebook in order to make the patent case stronger. When suspicions were raised, he staged a break-in of his own car to get rid of the evidence, resulting in charges of obstruction of justice. Trying to avoid this, he attempted to flee the country, only to be caught with an illegal passport and a pile of cash. While in jail for this offense, he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge. In order to fight the new charges, he tried to feign psychological problems, but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense, and how it might be done. He was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency, but was convicted anyway. According to the lawyers concerned, the original notebooks were not needed for the trial. The patent filing date, which was not in dispute, would have sufficed.\n\nTimeline\n\nMay 1997: acquired Cooper & Chyan Technology, a provider of PCB and IC automatic place and router software solutions.\n\nDecember 1998: acquired Quickturn Design Systems, Inc., a market leader in microchip emulation.\n\nJune 1999: acquired OrCAD Systems, a market leader in shrink-wrap PCB Design Tools.\n\nOctober 2002: acquired IBM's Test Design Automation group.\n\nSeptember 2003: acquired Verplex Systems, a provider of Formal Verification products, Conformal Solutions and Blacktie Property Checker.\n\nApril 6, 2004: acquired Neolinear Technology, a privately held company specializing in rapid analog design technology.\n\nApril 7, 2005: acquired Verisity, Ltd., a provider of verification process automation solutions ($315 million in cash).\n\nIn 2007 the company began talks with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Blackstone Group regarding a possible sale of the company.\n\nJuly 12, 2007: acquired Invarium, a photolithography specialist.\n\nAugust 15, 2007: acquired Clearshape, a developer of Design for Manufacturability (DFM) technology.\n\nMarch 11, 2008: acquired ChipEstimate, a developer of IC planning and IP reuse management tools.\n\nAugust 15, 2008: Cadence withdrew a $1.6 billion offer to purchase rival Mentor Graphics.\n\nJune 17, 2010: completed acquisition of Denali Software.\n\nMay 10, 2011: acquired Altos Design Automation, Inc., vendor of standard and complex cell libraries for the delivery of complex SoCs at advanced nodes.\n\nJuly 12, 2011: acquired Azuro, creator of clock concurrent optimization technology.\n\nJuly 2, 2012: acquired Sigrity, a leader in high-speed PCB and IC packaging analysis\n\nFebruary, 2013: acquired Cosmic Circuits, a provider of analog and mixed signal intellectual property (IP) cores.

It was founded in the early 1980s, along with Daisy Systems Corporation and Mentor Graphics, collectively known as DMV. The engineering founders were L. Curtis Widdoes, Tom McWilliams and Jeff Rubin, all of whom had worked on the S-1 supercomputer project at Livermore Labs.\n\nValid acquired several companies such as Telesis (PCB layout), Analog Design Tools, and Calma (IC layout). In turn, Valid was acquired by Cadence Design Systems in the early 90s.\n\nValid built both hardware and software, for schematic capture, logic simulation, static timing analysis, and packaging. Much of the initial software base derived from SCALD (\"Structured Computer-Aided Logic Design\"), a set of tools developed to support the design of the S-1 supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Later, Valid expanded into IC design tools and into printed circuit board layout.\n\nAt first, Valid ran schematic capture on a proprietary UNIX workstation, the SCALDSystem, with static timing analysis, simulation, and packaging running on a VAX or IBM-compatible mainframe. However, by the mid-1980s, general purpose workstations were powerful enough, significantly cheaper. Companies such as Mentor Graphics and Cadence Design Systems sold software only for such workstations. By 1990, almost all Valid software was also running on workstations, primarily those from Sun Microsystems.\n\nNotable persons\n\nAlberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, co-founder.\n\nRichard Newton co.founder\n\nJames Solomon, co-founder.\n\nJiri Soukup, co-founder.\n\nKen Kundert, fellow.
