        "text": "The day-to-day technological development of wireless communication, RADAR and millimeter wave applications has increased the need of planar circuits like MMIC, MIC to connect with waveguide section horn antennas with transmitter/receivers section and the time demands a low loss transition interconnect between microstrip line and waveguide. In this paper a detailed study of a microwave rectangular waveguide-to-microstrip line transition has been presented in tabulated format for easy understanding of transitions along with their merits, demerits and coupling methodology used to design transitions and the results in terms of insertion loss (IL), return loss (RL) and fractional obtained bandwidth have also been presented. The specific applications of the designed transitions for RADAR, millimeter wave and wireless communications, etc. are displayed in the table. The methodology (procedure) steps to design transitions have been also listed for future improvement in transition design.\n\nA critical component of the millimeter-wave superheterodyne receiver is the local oscillator (LO) which is used to pump the low-noise mixer. Frequency multipliers have been used for many years to produce LO power. Current technology uses the whisker-contacted Schottky varactor diode which is inherently very fragile, expensive to fabricate, difficult to optimize, and requires as many as three mechanical tuners. This report describes the design, fabrication, and evaluation of four planar frequency multipliers. The &#39;direct-replacement&#39; design demonstrates how a discrete planar varactor can replace a whisker-contacted varactor in a waveguide-type 75/225 GHz tripler and yield comparable performance. The fully monolithic (MMIC) balanced-varactor 80/160 GHz doubler and balanced-varactor 80/240 GHz tripler designs illustrate that MMIC technology is practical throughout the millimeter-wave band. Finally, a high-power 31/94 GHz tripler design is presented. These MMIC multipliers are t..."
