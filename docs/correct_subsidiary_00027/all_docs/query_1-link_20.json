There are challenges associated with building or obtaining an experimental setup, aligning the optical fibres, etc. We hope that this chip can provide people with a rapid entry into the field.\n\nWhat if you don't have access to experimental facilities?\n\nNo problem. The edX course includes a big chip fabricated with all participant designs, and we will test the entire chip. So everyone will receive measurement data for their designs.\n\nDetails:"
