Leuven, Belgium Thursday, June 8 - 1:00 PM Room: Concourse Hall Embedded Systems Day - Wednesday, June 7 - See sessions 18-20, 23-25, 28-30 Recognizing the increasing role of embedded software in complex SoC designs, we have designated Wednesday as Embedded Systems (ES) Day. Three parallel tracks will cover topics such as embedded compilation, hardware/software co-design, system modeling and power optimization. A special session will focus on ES research and educational programs within universities. In addition, an ES CEO/CTO panel will examine challenges and potential solutions as seen from the prespective of the CAD tool and system chip vendors. Tutorials - Friday, June 9 - details on pgs. 50-55 1) The Quest for Synthesis and Layout Timing Closure 2) Static Timing Analysis and Optimization for High-Performance Digital Design Success 3) System Level Design with Embedded Platforms 4) Signal Integrity in Deep Submicron Designs 5) Design Technology for Building Wireless Systems-on-Chip 6) Low-Power System Design: Applications, Architectures, and Design Methodologies W o r k s h op for Women in Des i g n A u t o m a t i o n- Sunday,June 4 - details o n pg. 18 Strategies for Success - This unique program affords the opportunity to hear successful women speak on topics relevant to their careers.

Sponsors : IEEE Networking the World Program Highlights The technical program covers over 160 papers, panels and embedded tutorials in five parallel tracks covering system level design, synthesis, physical design, verification, modeling, interconnect, power and IP issues. Highlights include a focus on embedded systems (see below) and also a number of sessions on fault and parasitic modeling in deep submicron technologies. The program includes a number of special sessions with invited tutorial presentations on the limitations of MOSFET modeling, closing the ASIC/full custom design gap and an exciting preview of life at 35nm and beyond. exhibitor info e x h i b i t o r p r e s e n t a t i o n s conference at a glance t e c h n i c a l p r o g r a m t u t o r i a l s sponsors t r a n s p o r t a t i o n h o u s i n g i n d e x registration 1"
