The Institute has been an IAEA Collaborating Centre for nearly four years. Our two organisations have worked closely together in training and research, as well as in areas such as establishing quality management systems at nuclear analytical laboratories in IAEA Member States. The launch of the new Masters Programme in Nuclear Security by the Delft University of Technology marks a new stage in our cooperation. Four other European universities are also taking part in the programme: the University of Oslo, the Technical University of Vienna, the Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences, and the University of Manchester Dalton Nuclear Institute. I am pleased that the syllabus for the course has been developed from the IAEA's Educational Programme in Nuclear Security. I commend this effort to train a new generation of experts who can help to improve global nuclear security. Strengthening nuclear security throughout the world remains a challenge for all of us. National governments have primary responsibility for nuclear security, but international cooperation is vital.\n\nOptions for the Delft advanced neutron source\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGibcus, H.P.M.; Leege, P.F.A. de; Labohm, F.; Vries, J.W. de; Verkooijen, A.H.M.; Valko, J.; Feltes, W.; Heinecke, J.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nResults of feasibility studies are presented for options for an advanced neutron source for the Delft reactor including upgrading the HOR, a 2 MW pool-type research reactor at the Delft University of Technology. The primary utilisation of the HOR focuses on beam research applications with neutrons and positrons. The aim of being scientifically competitive in that research area requires a thermal neutron flux level of at least 1x10 14 n/cm 2 /s. The feasibility of an accelerator driven neutron source and upgrading the present core to a super compact core for reaching this goal has been investigated at large from a safety and operational point of view. For the upgraded core, a 3x3 fuel assembly arrangement and beryllium reflected at all sides was chosen. Figures on the system performance, including the merits of a cold neutron source application feeding the neutron guide system, are presented.

Effectiveness, Efficiency, Energy Consumption\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2003-09-01\n\nThe 3E: Klimaatplan Delft; (Delft Climate Plan)' is the Delft interpretation of the Kyoto Convention, and is furthermore in line with the objectives of '3D: Duurzaamheidsplan Delft 2000-2003; (2002-2003 Delft Sustainability Plan)'. 3E stands for: effective, efficient energy consumption. The principal objective is an annual reduction of 33,500 tons of CO2 emissions, compared to 1999. This level of reduction should be realised not later than by 2012 (the final year of the plan period). On the basis of the Climate Scan performed by Novem, the largest environmental gain appears to come from (re-)construction processes and the use of sustainable energy [nl\n\n'Most Rare Workmen': Optical Practitioners in Early Seventeenth-Century Delft\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nZuidervaart, Huib J.; Rijks, Marlise\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA special interest in optics among various seventeenth-century painters living in the Dutch city of Delft has intrigued historians, including art historians, for a long time.

Inspired by the method of performing non-unitary operators by the linear combination of unitary operations, we proposed a quantum algorithm for the simulation of the universal single-qubit channel, described by a convex combination of \"quasi-extreme\" channels corresponding to four Kraus operators, and is scalable to arbitrary higher dimension. We demonstrated the whole algorithm experimentally using the universal IBM cloud-based quantum computer and studied the properties of different qubit quantum channels. We illustrated the quantum capacity of the general qubit quantum channels, which quantifies the amount of quantum information that can be protected. The behavior of quantum capacity in different channels revealed which types of noise processes can support information transmission, and which types are too destructive to protect information. There was a general agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experiments, which strongly supports our method. By realizing the arbitrary qubit channel, this work provides a universally- accepted way to explore various properties of quantum channels and novel prospect for quantum communication.\n\nNuclear Science and Engineering education at the Delft University of Technology\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBode, P.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThere is a national awareness in the Netherlands for strengthening education in the nuclear sciences, because of the ageing workforce, and to ensure competence as acceptability increases of nuclear power as an option for diversification of the energy supply. This may be reflected by the rapidly increasing number of students at the Delft University of Technology with interest in nuclear science oriented courses, and related bachelor and MSc graduation projects. These considerations formed the basis of the Nuclear Science and Engineering concentration, effectively starting in 2009. The programme can be taken as focus of the Research and Development Specialisation within the Master Programme in Applied Physics or as a Specialisation within the Master's Programme in Chemical Engineering. Both programmes require successful completion of a total of 120 ECTS study points, consisting of two academic years of 60 ECTS (1680 hours of study). Of that total, 100 ECTS are in the field of Nuclear Science and Engineering, depending on students choices within the programme, including a (industrial) internship, to be taken in companies all over the world. In Chemical Engineering, there is a compulsory design project during which a product or process should be developed. Both programmes also require a final graduation project. In both curricula, Nuclear Science and Engineering comprises compulsory and elective courses, which allow students to focus on either health or energy. Examples of courses include Nuclear Science, Nuclear Chemistry, Nuclear Engineering, Reactor Physics, Chemistry of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle, Medical Physics and Radiation Technology and Radiological Health Physics.

[Interfaculty Reactor Institute IRI, Delft University of Technology, Delft (Netherlands); Tuerkcan, E. [ECN Nuclear Research, Petten (Netherlands)\n\n1998-09-01\n\nHigh temperature helium-cooled reactors have a large potential for inherent safety. Therefore, several projects on HTR research are being carried out or were carried out at the Interfaculty Reactor Institute (IRI) of the Delft University of Technology in Delft, Netherlands. As part of a larger research programme measurements of core reactivity, reactivity worth of safety rods and of small samples being oscillated in the reactor core were carried out at the PROTEUS facility of the Paul Scherrer Institute at Villigen, Switzerland. Together with other partners in the Netherlands a small inherently safe co-generation plant with a pebble-bed HTR core was designed and analysed. It was verified that such a reactor can operate continuously for 10 years by adding continuously fuel pebbles until the maximum available core height is reached. As a new, innovative, inherently safe reactor type the design of a fluidized-bed reactor with coated fuel particles on a helium gas stream is discussed and results are shown for the analysis of inherent criticality safety under varying coolant flow rates. IRI is also taking part in the new IAEA Co-ordinated Research Programme, which involves participation in the start-up experiments of the Japanese HTTR and carrying out calculations for the core physics benchmark test. 11 refs.\n\nIBM PC/IX operating system evaluation plan\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDominick, Wayne D.

This modeling framework simulates flows through and around a MHK arrays while quantifying environmental responses. As an augmented version of the Dutch company, Deltaresâs, environmental hydrodynamics code, Delft3D, Delft3D-CEC includes a new module that simulates energy conversion (momentum withdrawal) by MHK current energy conversion devices with commensurate changes in the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate. The Following is a description of Deltaresâs open-source code Delft3D from which Delft3D-CEC is built upon. âDelft3D is a world leading 3D modeling suite to investigate hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphology and water quality for fluvial, estuarine and coastal environments. As per 1 January 2011, the Delft3D flow (FLOW), morphology (MOR) and waves (WAVE) modules are available in open source. The software is used and has proven his capabilities on many places around the world, like the Netherlands, USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Venice, etc. The software is continuously improved and developed with innovating advanced modelling techniques as consequence of the research work of our institute and to stay world leading. The FLOW module is the heart of Delft3D and is a multi-dimensional (2D or 3D) hydrodynamic (and transport) simulation programme which calculates non-steady flow and transport phenomena resulting from tidal and meteorological forcing on a curvilinear, boundary fitted grid or sperical coordinates. In 3D simulations, the vertical grid is defined following the so-called sigma coordinate approach or Z-layer approach. The MOR module computes sediment transport (both suspended and bed total load) and morphological changes for an arbitrary number of cohesive and non-cohesive fractions.

The philosophy of Delft-FEWS is to provide water managers and operators with an open shell tool, which allows the integratation of a variety of hydrological, hydraulics, river routing, and reservoir models with hydrometerological forecasts data. Delft-FEWS serves as an powerful tool for both basin-scale and national-scale water resources management. The essential novelty of Delft-FEWS is to change the flood forecasting and water resources management from a single model or agency centric paradigm to a intergrated framework, in which different model, data, algorithm and stakeholders are strongly linked together. The paper will start with the challenges in water resources managment, and the concept and philosophy of Delft-FEWS. Then, the details of data handling and linkages of Delft-FEWS with different hydrological, hydraulic, and reservoir models, etc. Last, several cases studies and applications of Delft-FEWS will be demonstrated, including the National Weather Service and the Bonneville Power Administration in USA, and a national application in the water board in the Netherland.\n\nDelft Dashboard: a quick setup tool for coastal and estuarine models\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNederhoff, C., III; Van Dongeren, A.; Van Ormondt, M.; Veeramony, J.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nWe developed easy-to-use Delft DashBoard (DDB) software for the rapid set-up of coastal and estuarine hydrodynamic and basic morphological numerical models. In the \"Model Maker\" toolbox, users have the capability to set-up Delft3D models, in a minimal amount of time (in the order of a hour), for any location in the world. DDB draws upon public internet data sources of bathymetry and tidesto construct the model. With additional toolboxes, these models can be forced with parameterized hurricane wind fields, uplift of the sea surface due to tsunamis nested in publically available ocean models and forced with meteo data (wind speed, pressure, temperature) In this presentation we will show the skill of a model which is setup with Delft Dashboard and compare it to well-calibrated benchmark models. These latter models have been set-up using detailed input data and boundary conditions. We have tested the functionality of Delft DashBoard and evaluate the performance and robustness of the DDB model system on a variety of cases, ranging from a coastal to basin models. Furthermore, we have performed a sensitivity study to investigate the most critical physical and numerical processes. The software can benefit operational modellers, as well as scientists and consultants.\n\nGreen micro-resistojet research at Delft University of Technology: new options for Cubesat propulsion\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCervone, A.; Zandbergen, B.; Guerrieri, D. C.; De Athayde Costa e Silva, M.; Krusharev, I.; van Zeijl, H.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe aerospace industry is recently expressing a growing interest in green, safe and non-toxic propellants for the propulsion systems of the new generation of space vehicles, which is especially true in the case of Cubesat micro-propulsion systems. Demanding requirements are associated to the future missions and challenges offered by this class of spacecraft, where the availability of a propulsion system might open new possibilities for a wide range of applications including orbital maintenance and transfer, formation flying and attitude control. To accomplish these requirements, Delft University of Technology is currently developing two different concepts of water-propelled micro-thrusters based on MEMS technologies: a free molecular micro-resistojet operating with sublimating solid water (ice) at low plenum gas pressure of less than 600 Pa, and a more conventional micro-resistojet operating with liquid water heated and vaporized by means of a custom designed silicon heating chamber. In this status review paper, the current design and future expected developments of the two micro-propulsion concepts is presented and discussed, together with an initial analysis of the expected performance and potential operational issues. Results of numerical simulations conducted to optimize the design of the heating and expansion slots, as well as a detailed description of the manufacturing steps for the conventional micro-resistojet concept, are presented. Some intended steps for future research activities, including options for thrust intensity and direction control, are briefly introduced.\n\nIBM 3705 Communications Controller\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n1972-01-01\n\nThe IBM 3705 Communications Controller is a simple computer which attaches to an IBM System/360 or System/370. Its purpose is to connect communication lines to the mainframe channel. It was a first communications controller of the popular IBM 37xx series.\n\nComparison. US P-61 and Delft sediment samplers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBeverage, Joseph P.; Williams, David T.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe Delft Bottle (DB) is a flow-through device designed by the Delft Hydraulic Laboratory (DHL), The Netherlands, to sample sand-sized sediment suspended in streams. The US P-61 sampler was designed by the Federal Interagency Sedimentation Project (FISP) at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory, Minneapolis, Minnesota, to collect suspended sediment from deep, swift rivers. The results of two point-sampling tests in the United States, the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1983 and the Colorado River near Blythe, California, in 1984, are provided in this report. These studies compare sand-transport rates, rather than total sediment-transport rates, because fine material washes through the DB sampler. In the United States, the commonly used limits for sand-sized material are 0.062 mm to 2.00 mm (Vanoni 1975).\n\nBill Lang's contributions to acoustics at the International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and to IBM in general\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNobile, Matthew A.; Chu, Richard C.\n\n2005-09-01\n\nAlthough Bill Lang's accomplishments and key roles in national and international standards and in the formation of INCE are widely recognized, sometimes it has to be remembered that for nearly 35 years he also had a ``day job'' at the IBM Corporation. His achievements at IBM were no less significant and enduring than those in external standards and professional societies. This paper will highlight some of the accomplishments and activities of Bill Lang as an IBM noise control engineer, the creator of the IBM Acoustics Lab in Poughkeepsie, the founder of the global Acoustics program at IBM, and his many other IBM leadership roles. Bill was also a long-serving IBM manager, with the full set of personnel issues to deal with, so his people-management skills were often called into play. Bill ended his long and fruitful IBM career at a high point. In 1988, he took an original idea of his to the top of IBM executive management, which led directly to the formation of the IBM Academy of Technology, today the preeminent body of IBM top technical leaders from around the world.\n\nIBM 5150 computer\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n1981-01-01\n\nIBMâs first personal computer arrived nearly 10 years after others companies, but instantly legitimized the market. IBM introduced its PC in 1981. IBM equipped the model 5150 with a cassette port for connecting a cassette drive. The first IBM PC ran on a 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 microprocessor. The PC came equipped with 16 kilobytes of memory, expandable to 256k. The PC came with one or two 160k floppy disk drives and an optional color monitor. The price tag started at $1,565, which would be nearly $4,000 (about â¬3,400) today.\n\nSandiaâs Current Energy Conversion module for the Flexible-Mesh Delft3D flow solver v. 1.0\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\n2018-04-25\n\nThe DOE has funded Sandia National Labs (SNL) to develop an open-source modeling tool to guide the design and layout of marine hydrokinetic (MHK) arrays to maximize power production while minimizing environmental effects. This modeling framework simulates flows through and around a MHK arrays while quantifying environmental responses. As an augmented version of the Dutch company, Deltaresâs, environmental hydrodynamics code, Delft3D, SNL-Delft3D-CEC-FM includes a new module that simulates energy conversion (momentum withdrawal) by MHK current energy conversion devices with commensurate changes in the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate. SNL-Delft3D-CEC-FM modified the Delft3D flexible mesh flow solver, DFlowFM.\n\nSummary inside IBM's historic turnaround\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis work offers a summary of the book \"WHO SAYS ELEPHANTS CAN'T DANCE? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround\" by Louis Gerstner.In nine years as the chairman and CEO of International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Louis Gerstner brought about a dramatic change in the company's fortunes. When he took charge, IBM was on the verge of extinction as the victim of rapid changes in the computer industry. However, instead of breaking up IBM as most analysts were suggesting, Gerstner and his management team turned the company around and restored it to a position of power and influence within the indu\n\nTeaching Engineering Ethics to PhD Students : A BerkeleyâDelft Initiative: Commentary on âEthics Across the Curriculum: Prospects for Broader (and Deeper) Teaching and Learning in Research and Engineering Ethicsâ\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nTaebi, B.; Kastenberg, William E.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA joint effort by the University of California at Berkeley and Delft University of Technology to develop a graduate engineering ethics course for PhD students encountered two types of challenges: academic and institutional.

For a number of reasons, including security, economy, and user convenience, the development of a comprehensive system of reactor neutronics codes suitable for operation on the IBM-PC has been undertaken at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). It is anticipated that a PC-based code system could also have wide applicability in the nuclear engineering education community since conversion of software generated by national laboratories and others to college and university mainframe hardware has historically been a time-consuming process that has sometimes met with only limited success. This paper discusses the philosophy behind the INEL reactor neutronics PC code system and describes those parts of the system that are currently complete, those that are now under development, and those that are still in the planning stage\n\nIBM model M keyboard\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n1985-01-01\n\nIn 1985, the IBM Model M keyboard was created. This timeless classic was a hit. IBM came out with several varients of the model M. They had the space saver 104 key which is the one most seen today and many international versions of that as well. The second type, and rarest is the 122 key model M which has 24 extra keys at the very top, dubbed the âprogrammers keyboardâ. IBM manufactured these keyboards until 1991. The model M features âcapsâ over the actual keys that can be taken off separately one at a time for cleaning or to replace them with colored keys or keys of another language, that was a very cost effective way of shipping out internationally the keyboards.\n\n8-inch IBM floppy disk\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n1971-01-01\n\nThe 8-inch floppy disk was a magnetic storage disk for the data introduced commercially by IBM in 1971. It was designed by an IBM team as an inexpensive way to load data into the IBM System / 370. Plus it was a read-only bare disk containing 80 KB of data. The first read-write version was introduced in 1972 by Memorex and could contain 175 KB on 50 tracks (with 8 sectors per track). Other improvements have led to various coatings and increased capacities. Finally, it was surpassed by the mini diskette of 5.25 inches introduced in 1976.\n\nThe Early Overseas Activities of IBM in Japan\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nåæ²¢, æ­£åº; ç°ä¸­, é ç« ; Masahiro, YOSHIZAWA; Masaaki, TANAKA; æç¥å­¦é¢å¤§å­¦; é´é¹¿ç­æå¤§å­¦; / SUZUKA JUNIOR COLLEGE\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to examine how IBM entered into prewar Japan and ran its wholly-owned subsidiary thereafter.

D.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nThe paper describes a program written in SNOBOL which verifies the correctness of programs written in assembly language for the IBM 360 and 370 series of computers. The motivation for using assembly language as a source language for a program verifier was the realization that many errors in programs are caused by misunderstanding or ignorance of the characteristics of specific computers. The proof of correctness of a program written in assembly language must take these characteristics into account. The program has been compiled and is currently running at the Center for Academic and Administrative Computing of The George Washington University.\n\nThe trail of six design projects in the Delft bachelor Aerospace Engineering\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nKamp, A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTomorrowâs engineers are required to have a good balance between deep working knowledge of engineering sciences and engineering skills.

IBM, as well as other computing facilities, began serving the public years ago, and is continuing to find ways to enhance the existence of man. With new developments in supercomputers like the Cray-2, and the recent advances in artificial intelligence programming, the human race is gaining knowledge at a rapid pace. All have benefited from the development of computers in the world; not only have they brought new assets to life, but have made life more and more of a challenge everyday.\n\nIsospin invariant forms of interacting boson model (IBM)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEvans, A.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nIn the original version of the interacting boson model, IBM1, there are only two quantum numbers with exact values: the angular momentum and the number of bosons. IBM2 distinguishes between two kinds of bosons. However, the IBM2 algebra does not include the operators TÂ± and consequently the states in the model have no good isospin, generally. IBM3 includes the isospin in the algebra and therefore the construction of states with any number of bosons and good isospin presents no problem. In this work, IBM3 is compared with the shell model. IBFM3 is also studied, which describes an odd nucleus as a system of N bosons plus a single nucleon that is a neutron with some probability and a proton with the complementary probability. The spectra obtained in the shell model, IBFM3 and IBFM2 for 45 Ti and 45 Sc are compared.

Dirck van Bleyswijckâs Beschryvinge der stadt Delft and its uneasy relationship with the past\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarcin Polkowski\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Dirck van Bleyswijck's Beschryvinge der stadt Delft presents an ambiguous and problematic attitude to the medieval history of Delft, which makes it interesting to scholars wishing to explore the perception of the Middle Ages as it crystallized during the early modern period. The aim of this contribution is to determine the intellectual origins of Van Bleyswijck's work as a historian in the context of his perception of the medieval past. The analysis of Van Bleyswijck's performance as a historian is based on a case study derived from the narrative: quotations from source texts and commentary about the life of the medieval Delft beguine Geertruyd van Oosten will be compared. Van Bleyswijck's representation of the Middle Ages was formed by a combination of humanist and proto-Enlightenment concepts, which entailed a critical reaction to forms of religious culture known to medieval society.\n\n[IBM Work and Personal Life Balance Programs.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp., Armonk, NY.\n\nThese five brochures describe the IBM Corporation's policies, programs, and initiatives designed to meet the needs of employees' child care and family responsibilities as they move through various stages of employment with IBM.

The communications backbone of the PACS is a portion of the Mayo institutional network: a series of 4-Mbps token rings interconnected by bridges and fiber optic extensions. The performance characteristics of this system are important to understand because they affect the response time a PACS user can expect, and the response time for non-PACS users competing for resources on the institutional network. The performance characteristics of each component and the average load levels of the network were measured for various load distributions. These data were used to quantify the response characteristics of the existing system and to tune a model developed by North Dakota State University Department of Computer Science for predicting response times of more complex topologies.\n\nApplications Performance Under MPL and MPI on NAS IBM SP2\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSaini, Subhash; Simon, Horst D.; Lasinski, T. A. (Technical Monitor)\n\n1994-01-01\n\nOn July 5, 1994, an IBM Scalable POWER parallel System (IBM SP2) with 64 nodes, was installed at the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation (NAS) Facility Each node of NAS IBM SP2 is a \"wide node\" consisting of a RISC 6000/590 workstation module with a clock of 66.5 MHz which can perform four floating point operations per clock with a peak performance of 266 Mflop/s. By the end of 1994, 64 nodes of IBM SP2 will be upgraded to 160 nodes with a peak performance of 42.5 Gflop/s. An overview of the IBM SP2 hardware is presented. The basic understanding of architectural details of RS 6000/590 will help application scientists the porting, optimizing, and tuning of codes from other machines such as the CRAY C90 and the Paragon to the NAS SP2. Optimization techniques such as quad-word loading, effective utilization of two floating point units, and data cache optimization of RS 6000/590 is illustrated, with examples giving performance gains at each optimization step. The conversion of codes using Intel's message passing library NX to codes using native Message Passing Library (MPL) and the Message Passing Interface (NMI) library available on the IBM SP2 is illustrated. In particular, we will present the performance of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) kernel from NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) under MPL and MPI. We have also optimized some of Fortran BLAS 2 and BLAS 3 routines, e.g., the optimized Fortran DAXPY runs at 175 Mflop/s and optimized Fortran DGEMM runs at 230 Mflop/s per node. The performance of the NPB (Class B) on the IBM SP2 is compared with the CRAY C90, Intel Paragon, TMC CM-5E, and the CRAY T3D.\n\nTraining in the Workplace: An IBM Case Study.

It complements Actor Network...... Theory by Karl E. Weickâs sensemaking and studies innovation processes through narratives. This approach supplements the literatureâs institutional focus and provides more focus on the technologyâs use and limitations on innovations. In the mid-1940s, IBM was reluctant to engage in computer innovation......, because its sales organization and top-management saw little computer business. They subscribed to the established corporate innovation narrative of incremental improvements of the companyâs many single punched-card machines, which contrasted the challenges of the revolutionary shift to computers.

A.; Ranjbar, Z.; Fouladi, N.; Ghapanvari, M.\n\nIn this paper, a transitional interacting boson model (IBM) Hamiltonian in both sd-(IBM) and sdg-IBM versions based on affine SU(1, 1) Lie algebra is employed to describe deviations from the gamma-unstable nature of Hamiltonian along the chain of Xe isotopes. sdg-IBM Hamiltonian proposed a better interpretation of this deviation which cannot be explained in the sd-boson models. The nuclei studied have well-known Î³ bands close to the Î³-unstable limit. The energy levels, B(E2) transition rates and signature splitting of the Î³ -vibrational band are calculated via the affine SU(1,1) Lie algebra. An acceptable degree of agreement was achieved based on this procedure. It is shown that in these isotopes the signature splitting is better reproduced by the inclusion of sdg-IBM. In none of them, any evidence for a stable, triaxial ground state shape is found.\n\nA performance evaluation of the IBM 370/XT personal computer\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDominick, Wayne D.

In this study is shown how cognitive computing systems can be useful for NASA when computers are trained in the same way as humans are to gain knowledge over time. Increasing knowledge through senses, learning and a summation of events is how the applications created by the firm IBM empower the artificial intelligence in a cognitive computing system. NASA has explored and applied for the last decades the artificial intelligence approach specifically with cognitive computing in few projects adopting similar models proposed by IBM Watson. However, the usage of semantic technologies by the dedicated business unit developed by IBM leads these cognitive computing applications to outperform the functionality of the inner tools and present outstanding analysis to facilitate the decision making for managers and leads in a management information system.\n\nCorrespondence between phenomenological and IBM-1 models of even isotopes of Yb\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nA. Okhunov, A.; I. Sharrad, F.; Anwer, A. Al-Sammarraie; U. Khandaker, M.\n\n2015-08-01\n\nEnergy levels and the reduced probability of E2- transitions for ytterbium isotopes with proton number Z = 70 and neutron numbers between 100 and 106 have been calculated through phenomenological (PhM) and interacting boson (IBM-1) models. The predicted low-lying levels (energies, spins and parities) and the reduced probability for E2- transitions results are reasonably consistent with the available experimental data. The predicted low-lying levels (gr-, Î²1- and Î³1- band) produced in the PhM are in good agreement with the experimental data compared with those by IBM-1 for all nuclei of interest. In addition, the phenomenological model was successful in predicting the Î²2-, Î²3-, Î²4-, Î³2- and 1+ - band while it was a failure with IBM-1. Also, the 3+- band is predicted by the IBM-1 model for 172Yb and 174Yb nuclei. All calculations are compared with the available experimental data.

Although there remain many open questions within this combined field of hydro- and morphodynamics, we observe an increasing need to include biological processes in the overall dynamics. In riverine and inter-tidal environments, there is often an important influence by riparian vegetation and macrobenthos. Over the past decade more and more researchers have started to extend the simulation environment with wrapper scripts and other quick code hacks to estimate their influence on morphological development in coastal, estuarine and riverine environments. Although one can in this way quickly analyze different approaches, these research tools have generally not been designed with reuse, performance and portability in mind. We have now implemented a reusable, flexible, and efficient two-way link between the Delft3D open source framework for hydrodynamics, waves and morphology, and the water quality and ecology modules. The same link will be used for 1D, 2D and 3D modeling on networks and both structured and unstructured grids. We will describe the concepts of the overall system, and illustrate it with some first results.\n\nGeneva University - Superconducting flux quantum bits: fabricated quantum objects\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2007-01-01\n\nEcole de physique DÃ©partement de physique nuclÃ©aire et corspusculaire 24, Quai Ernest-Ansermet 1211 GENEVE 4 TÃ©l: (022) 379 62 73 Fax: (022) 379 69 92 Lundi 29 janvier 2007 COLLOQUE DE LA SECTION DE PHYSIQUE 17 heures - Auditoire Stueckelberg Superconducting flux quantum bits: fabricated quantum objects Prof. Hans Mooij / Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology The quantum conjugate variables of a superconductor are the charge or number of Cooper pairs, and the phase of the order parameter.

The program described in this document is designed for off-line analysis using an IBM PC (or compatible) for counting data from standards and unknown specimens (i.e. for analysis of counting data previously recorded by a counter), together with internal quality control (IQC) data both within and between batch. The greater computing power of the IBM PC has enabled the imprecision profile and IQC control curves which were unavailable on the HP-41C version. It is intended that the program would make available good data processing capability to laboratories having limited financial resources and serious problems of quality control. 3 refs\n\nInstitute of place making : A project by the chair of Landscape Architecture at the TU Delft.
