Additionally, the CPU could move \"south\" (towards DIMMs) to additionally reduce DDR routing lengths, at the expense of longer PCIe routes to x16 connector(s).

The uATX form factor reduces the x-dim to 9.6” [animation], saving us about $1.30 in PCB cost. We are investigating chopping the y-dim from 9.6” to somewhere in the range of 8.2 to 8.5 inches [animation]. Which would save us an additional ~$0.75 over the 9.6x9.6 in sol’n. 2-chip (processor + PCH) solution is what allows this 8.x inch chop. The “core” design (processor-memory-VR) certainly fits in chop. Whether the chop is 8.2”, 8.5”, or something in between is under investigation by our CRB team. The amount of I/O will determine the exact chop line. For that reason, the I/O feature set in the SW corner of the board is very preliminary. E.g., # of USB front panel and SATA headers we can actually fit. So we’d like some fdbk from you to help us gauge these CRB tradeoffs: If we had to give up some SATA headers or front panel USB headers or some other feature to fit 8.2”, would this be the correct tradeoff? As a baseline, we believe 4 SATA/6 Front Panel USB would fit into ~8.2 to 8.5“. And 6 SATA/ 8 Front Panel USB would fit in the full 9.6x9.6\" Additional Notes: CRB picture shows 5 SATAs, but today that doesn’t fit actually fit in 8.2”. CRB picture shows 1394 back panel connector in the upper rightmost corner. Even though CRB probably will NOT include it. If customers notice 1394, call this correction out. CRB team only ~20% done with floorplan definition around PCH at this point. 33\n\n34 Proposed CRB Back Panel Configuration\n\nStarting CRB back panel configuration tradeoff studies for µATX Are these back panel features still desirable on this 2009 platform? VGA Both Display Port and HDMI on same motherboard 1394 “This is the latest CRB back panel configuration for uATX form factor. Our team just started looking at tradeoffs between avail connectors vs back panel space. So we value your fdbk in the following areas: 1. Does this I/O feature-set look suitable? 2. Do you still plan to provide the following features on this ’09 mainstream platform? - VGA. Recall that PCH can only support 2 simultaneous outputs. - BOTH Display Port AND HDMI on the same m/b? Segmentation for Dig Office vs Dig Home? - 1394? Are willing to add 1394 by losing one of the video outputs?” Internal Notes: was removed so we could add a x4 slot. uATX is what drove this. Supporting 1394 requires adding a separate 1394 controller chip, which looks very tight to fit in the board. could be stacked on top of USBx2 if a customer wanted to enable a new connector. - E-SATA is broken. Routing guidelines only give us 3\", where we need 10\". Would require adding buffer chip to m/b. - It's a lot of trouble to fit two level-shifters (HDMI and DVI) in 8.2\" core. We could fit only one. That's why DVI is not shown. 2 level shifters might fit on 8.5\" core (still under investigation by CRB team). - DVI-I does have the VGA signals in it. Just need a dongle.

Followed lead w/ 1366 to improve solder reliability. Reduce stresses from the SktT lever. Note the NCTF (non-critical to function) balls in each corner; plus they are larger (21 mils) to give more strength. Pitch is tighter to accommodate the increased pin count.

Next foil walks through assembly steps. Our goal was to pick a sweet spot between assembly time and cost. E.g., - We chose NOT to use captive screws because of cost. There is no glue on backplate. But it does have an electrical insulator to avoid board-shorting issues. Not really a red screw. These screws are the same. These are Torx T-20 screws, even though the picture doesn’t show it well. 36 36\n\n37 Socket 1160 / ILM (ILM to MB Assembly)\n\nAlign back plate to motherboard Back plate is located in backside fixture Motherboard slides into backside fixture Insulator prevents sheet metal contact with board Insert shoulder screw Note: Pick and Place cover already on LGA 1160 socket Shoulder screw is installed on one-hole side Align ILM top assembly Note: Top assembly preassembled at ILM manufacturer Insulator under frame prevents sheet metal contact with board Pictures are self-explanatory.

We couldn’t stick with 72 mm square because the larger LGA1160 ILM body meant LGA775 wouldn’t fit over H1 ILM. LGA 1366 has 80mm – trying to get as small as possible to allow OEM / ODM integration options for AIO / SFF innovation The extra 2mm (90 vs 92 mm) for max extrusion was used because we can (have the room). But customers can stick w/ 90 mm and still cool the processor. In fact, we'll probably keep 90 mm on our Intel designs. Internal Note: - Some Intel folks wanted to use the SktB 80 mm mounting holes, but we felt it was better to keep 1160 as close to SktT as possible. 38\n\n39 Thermal Solution Enabling\n\nDigital Home (Universal: LYN + HVN) Digital Office (HVN only) TDP 95W 75W1 Heatsink RCFH7-1160 RCFH6-1160 Re-use options 2004 Performance (RCBFH3) w/New Clip Wolfdale CR w/New Clip (RCFH6-775) RCBFH – ATX reference solution Continue with Radial Curved Fin Solution, which Provides VR cooling Core OD and Extrusion ID common with RCBF3, 4 and 5 Vendors can mix / match of core, extrusion and fans to meet cost or acoustic goals Cost Reduction from past Performance Heatsinks BTX solutions will be custom Engaging with OEMs for details on BTX plans in 2009 MTB pending results of OEM feedback PCH Heatsink expecting to reuse existing ICH Heatsink LYN and HVD require different Heatsinks, but LYN will cool HVD.

MTB: Mechanical Thermal Test Board PCH should be able to reuse ICH thermal solution. Even though PCH has higher than ICH10. Reason involve the package design, where PCH uses FCBGA, vs BGA for ICH10 that has this non-ideal plastic insulator on top of the die. 1: Early pre-silicon estimates.

No VR or IO included. ATX We’re doing the standard collateral. Similar to 2008 support. Don’t expect customers to have any issues w/ ’09 ATX enabling. BTX If customers are not a BTX adopter, this foil doesn’t apply to them. - We are doing Core Only. Not providing the Intel mech test board for BTX as we did for ‘08. No physical CRB: We are not validating the entire mech stack, but we’ll ensure the individual components will work (E.g., memory). So platform design stuff like shock and vibe, airflow, etc. is up to the customer to validate. But BTX adopters weren’t adapting our Intel reference sol’n anyway, so we’re not sure this is a big deal. If a customer is really hard pressed about our BTX ’09 enabling, we (Matt’s team) should follow up and understand their needs (system configuration, boundary conditions). And then we can figure out how to respond. What about Mini-ITX interest. - Are customers willing to use mobile’s higher-density board technology to fit all this stuff in? No chance Eaglelake could fit in 4L board with “cheap” desktop board technology. But 2-chip Hav/Lyn will obviously be cheaper to implement in Mini-ITX. - Shelton picked Mini-ITX because that made the most sense for that product, but we still want SFF to be uATX form factor. Also note Shelton2/3 will be Mini-ITX! - Steve Lang is doing a “reference ITX design” for Shelton. It’s more of a showcase to demo Shelton. - Peter is preparing an IDF Q&A on BTX, ATX, and ITX.\n\n41 Agenda Nehalem Family Processor Overview Ibexpeak Overview\n\n2009 Roadmap Transitions Platform Architecture & Design Engagement Schedule Q & A\n\n42 2009 Platform Engagement Timeline\n\nQ3 ‘07 Q4 ‘07 Q1 ‘08 Q2 ‘08 Q3 ‘08 Q4 ‘08 1H ‘09 Overview Visits Platform Visits Design In Visits Platform Power On Readiness for Q3 ‘08 LYN & HVN 1st Samples LYN & HVN QS LYN & HVN Production Ibexpeak 1st Samples IBX Qual Samples Ibexpeak Production Rev 0.7 Collateral Rev 1.0 Collateral Rev 1.5 Collateral Legend: Lynnfield = LYN Havendale = HVN Ibexpeak = IBX Start planning for Q3 ’08 Platform Power On\n\n43 Agenda Nehalem Family Processor Overview Ibexpeak Overview\n\n2009 Roadmap Transitions Platform Architecture & Design Engagement Schedule Q & A 43\n\n44 Q&A\n\n45 Backup 45\n\n46 Bloomfield & Tylersburg\n\n46\n\n47 Bloomfield Segmentation vs Mainstream Platform\n\n4 cores, 8 threads, 8MB shared cache IMC, 6.4 GT/sec QPI Top Bin Frequency 130W TDP Extreme Segment LGA 1366 High-end Desktop Platform 4 cores, 8 threads, 8MB shared cache IMC, 4.8 GT/sec QPI Bin -1 Frequency 130W TDP Performance Segment 4 cores, 8 threads, 8MB shared cache IMC, 4.8 GT/sec QPI High end Mainstream Segment Bin -2 Frequency 130W TDP 4 & 2 cores; 8, 4 & 2 threads Various cache sizes High Volume Mainstream Platform LGA 1160 Mainstream Socket Bin y Frequency ≤ 95W TDP Different socket and platform than Bloomfield Planning three Bloomfield line items 47\n\n48 Memory Support & Configurations\n\nNew Integrated Memory Controller Architecture (IMC) DDR3 scalable platform performance 800MHz, 1066MHz, 13331MHz speeds 512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb technologies Improved performance per watt vs. DDR2 3 Memory Channels 2 DIMMs per channel Un-buffered DIMM (UDIMM) only support 24GB total memory support (using 2Gb tech) Lower latency Population Rule - Slot 0 must always be populated in at least one channel Slot 1 Slot 0 Slot 1 Slot 0 Slot 1 Slot 0 Increased Platform Performance and Flexibility 1: Extreme Edition only at launch 48\n\n49 Bloomfield* Performance Estimates\n\nYorkfield = 3.46/ MB, 4C/4T Bloomfield = 3.33, 6.4GT/s, 8MB, 4C/8T *: Doesn’t account for any Turbo benefits Source: Intel – Performance projections are pre-silicon.

The ICH9 I/O controller is currently sampling now with the BearlLake platform. The goal is pair an existing ICH with the Tylersburg Platfrom to remove risk from a platfrom that introduces a lot of new technologies.. The Intel® ICH9 provides up to 6 PCI Express root ports which are compliant to the PCI Express Base Specification, Revision 1.1. The Intel® ICH9 is capable of supporting six SATA ports at 1.5Gbps and 3Gbps speeds, and twelve USB 2.0 ports with 2 independent EHCI controller. The Intel® ICH9 additionally features an integrated High Definition audio controller to support extreme multimedia applications and differentiation through the use of a variety of third party audio codecs. On the storage side the Intel® ICH9 offers the Intel® Matrix storage technology which offers a variety of RAID options for protection of data and rapid data access. The Intel® ICH9 also supports the next generation of client management through the use of Intel® AMT technology in conjunction with Intel’s next generation Gigabit Ethernet controller. The Intel® ICH9 is ACPI compliant and can support the Full-on, Stop-Grant, Suspend to RAM, Suspend to Disk, and Soft-Off power management states. Q. Why is Intel using ICH9 instead of ICH10 for HEDT/XEDT in ‘08? Overall program schedule is the top priority for this program. Power on and initial silicon checkout with ICH9 allows us to meet our launch target of Holiday Refresh ’08, which is current POR. Current ICH10 schedules (product in planning) do not line up with targeted power on and early checkout with Tylersburg HEDT silicon and would impact achieving our launch target of HR ’08.

The 3 main features of the Boazman Phy over the Nineveh Phy are Performace, Power, and Physical Size. On the Perfroamce side we added new featues such as Receive Side Scaling, basically add multiple Rx and Tx Queues to allow multi core processors to process the network traffic more efficiently. We also have added support for Jumbo Frames will allow up to 9Kbbyte of packet information, instead on the standard 1kbyte packet which improves the data to header ratio and improves performace. Performance Features Virtual Appliance Support  Support for Intel Virtualization and Manageability. This is for the vPro platform support. There is logic in the MAC to support both platforms. AMT bullets are probably discussed in more detail in the AMT section, but there is actual hardware logic in the LAN MAC silicon so it is specified here. AMT system defense  This is a hardware firewall that has configurable filters that can block specific network traffic. There are filters configurable by IT. This exists in ICH8. There are filters located in the MAC for this feature. Heuristics have been added in ICH9  Logic in the MAC scans traffic the network traffic and if certain malicious network traffic is observed it sends alert to IT. IT can then configure filters to block traffic. There is logic in the MAC to support this feature. Receive Side Scaling  This enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in-order delivery of the data. RSS enables parallel Direct Procedure Calls (DPC) and multiple interrupts, and the ability to direct these interrupts/DPCs to different processors in an dual core system. This improves performance in dual core platforms with multiple network streams. Jumbo Frames  This allows for the transmission of up to 9kb packets instead of only 1kb with standard Ethernet frames. This reduces CPU utilization by increasing ratio of data/header in network transmission (gain varies based on application) Offloads  This provides offloaded HW based processing of TCP and IP (v4 and v6) protocol checksums and reduces system CPU utilization LSO  This provides for TCP segmentation to be performed in HW instead of higher up in the SW stack. This also reduces system CPU utilization (gain varies based on workload) Lower Power Target TDP is the target for Boazman as there is not silicon yet. TDP stands for Total Dynamic Power when the device (PHY) is running in GbE mode. This is the device power only. LAN disable  This is a single pin added on Boazman where a external controller or other signal can disable the PHY. Nineveh has to disable the LAN through the BIOS. Reduced BOM & Greater Design Flexibility Package size change. Was a 10x10 BGA package for Nineveh. Not pin compatible with Nineveh. The new QFN package has 56 pins. Ekron-N (10/100 part) was pin compatible with Nineveh. For Boazman there is not a pin compatible 10/100 part. However we still do support Ekron in the platform it is just can’t be designed as a dual-footprint. If any OEM/ODM requests this support contact LAD and start a SOW to update all of the necessary drivers and tools (LAN & BIOS). Single 3.3V Rail  Same implementation as Nineveh. Common LAN/BIOS  The GbE NVM image and BIOS share the same flash off of the ICH. It is a SPI flash. The tools needed to build the BIOS are supported by BCG. SingleDriver  Single driver for family of products (PCIe, 1Gbe) Only need one image of driver across multiple products in the same family.
