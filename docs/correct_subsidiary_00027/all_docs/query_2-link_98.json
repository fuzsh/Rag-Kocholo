The number of cases of breast cancer has risen over time. Although it is difficult to prevent this disease, the survival rate can be improved with early detection and proper treatment planning of the disease. Thanks to breakthroughs in deep learning, the progress of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) of breast cancer has seen a lot of improvement. Deep neural networks have advanced to the point where their diagnostic capabilities are approaching those of a human specialist. Mammograms are crucial radiological images used to detect breast cancer at its early stage. Mammogram image scaling at the input layer is required for training deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) directly on high-resolution images. This could result in the loss of crucial information for discovering medical abnormalities. Instead of developing an image classifier, the idea is to create a patch classifier. The technique for extracting abnormal patches from mammography images is proposed in this research. Patches are extracted from a benchmark and publicly available MIAS dataset. These patches are then used to train deep learning classifiers such as VGG-16, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B7. With the patches already included in the CBIS-DDSM dataset, we contrast the results of the MIAS patches. EfficientNet-B7 on CBIS-DDSM patches produced good results (92% accuracy) when compared to other classifiers such as VGG-16 and ResNet-50. We also discovered that ResNet-50 is demonstrated to be quite robust on both datasets. Keywords Mammogram · Deep learning · Patch extraction · Classification\n\nP. Oza (B) · P. Sharma · S.

Oza et al.\n\n1 Background Breast cancer is one of the most common abnormal neoplasms in the female population. Mammography is a referral examination for breast cancer screening [1]. Furthermore, it has been established that the breast cancer survival rate is highly influenced by the stage at which the disease is detected [2]. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems are being developed for automated breast cancer diagnosis. This approach improves finding accuracy and the capacity to recognize irregularities such as breast mass, calcification, focal distortion, asymmetries. Only professional doctors make final decisions; thus, CAD systems can operate as a second reader designed to aid a radiologist. DCNNs are extensively utilized for cancer detection, classification, and segmentation in medical imaging. Unfortunately, training a network from scratch can take days or weeks and requires a significant amount of computing power [3]. In addition, to avoid overfitting the training dataset, the training procedure for supervised deep CNNs typically necessitates a high number of annotated samples. The most common method for dealing with this issue is transfer learning (TL). The goal is to fine-tune a model that has been pre-trained [4]. In most cases, TL-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are utilized to categorize the entire image. Instead, in patch-based classification, we categorize individual patches of an image belonging to a given class before categorizing the whole image based on the patches’ categorization. For training DCNNs directly on high-resolution images, image scaling at the input layer is necessary. This might lead to the loss of vital information to detection medical anomalies. Patch-based classification seeks to answer the following question: “What are the prominent traits of a specific patch that indicate that it belongs to one of two classes?”. Furthermore, image scarcity is a prevalent problem in medical imaging studies. As a result, making several patches from a single image might significantly expand the training set. We present a method for extracting patches from mammograms in this paper. For patch extraction, we used the MIAS [5] dataset. We created a patch-based classifier that uses DCNNs to classify breast mammography images into benign and malignant categories. We employed transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG-16 [6], ResNet-50 [7], and EfficientNet-B7 [8] to classify patches. We utilized CBIS-DDSM [9] mammography patches as a comparison. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the literature of the domain. Then, the proposed methodology is showcased in Sect. 3. We discussed the results in Sect. 4. We finally end with the conclusion in Sect. 5.\n\n2 Related Work in the Domain The fields of AI such as machine learning and deep learning have made potential advancements in biotechnology and medical research domain [10]. Despite the fact\n\nPatch Extraction and Classifier for Abnormality Classification …\n\n3\n\nthat several authors have proposed using traditional machine learning and computer vision techniques to classify breast abnormalities [11], due to the scarcity of publicly available datasets, the use of deep learning approaches has been limited in the field of breast imaging [12–14]. Due to privacy and regulatory concerns, having significant and correctly annotated picture data is the most frequent problem in the medical research arena [15–17]. In the majority of situations, this issue also results in an overfitting scenario. The majority of the time, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on transfer learning are used to classify the entire image. To fit the model input size, we must resize the picture when utilizing the transfer learning approach for the whole mammography. The loss of certain significant picture information during image scaling is undesirable for medical image analysis. This issue may be resolved, and the model performance can be enhanced, by extracting accurate ROI patches similar to model’s input size from whole mammograms and utilizing them for training. While including additional patch samples in the training set, the accuracy of transfer learning technique may also be improved. A patch-based method is proposed by authors of [2] to detect and segment microcalcifications from mammograms. This model comprises two convolutional neural network-based blocks: the detector and the segmentation. The model might be particularly beneficial in the screening situation, where the high number of exams may cause the reader’s attention to be diverted to support diagnosis or restrict the differential diagnosis. Another study [1] proposes a patch-based CNN approach for breast mass detection in full-field digital mammograms (FFDM). Authors look into using transfer learning to adapt to a specific area. Transfer learning is an effective way of transferring knowledge from one visual domain to another. The majority of current research is now based on this concept. Issues like ignorance of semantic characteristics, analysis limitations to the present patch of pictures, missing patches in low-contrast mammography images, and segmentation ambiguity are addressed in [18]. An ensemble learning strategy is presented in the work employing machine learning techniques like random forest and boosting to improve the classification performance of breast mass systems while reducing variance and generalization error. To categorize breast cancer images, [19] proposed a CNN model which can do feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification. The model can classify breast cancer images into three categories: malignant, normal, and benign. A recent survey [20] provided the study of publicly available mammographic datasets and dataset-based quantitative comparison of the most modern approaches. Authors of [21] presented an end-to-end model to identify and classify masses inside the whole mammographic image. They expanded on that work by categorizing local image patches using a pre-trained model on a labeled dataset that offers ROI data. ResNet50 and VGG-16 are used as a pre-trained models in this work. For mammogram classification, a CNN-based patch classifier is proposed in [22]. A curriculum learning technique was applied in the study to attain high levels of accuracy in classifying mammograms. Authors of [23] examined several classification strategies for mammogram classification, divided into four categories based on function, probability, rule, and similarity. Furthermore, the research concentrated on various issues relating to mammography datasets and classification algorithms. Patch-based classifiers\n\n4\n\nP. Oza et al.\n\nare also used for other imaging modalities such as breast histopathology imaging. For the automatic categorization of histological breast image, authors of [24] suggested a patch-based classifier utilizing convolutional neural network (CNN). One patch in one decision and all patches in one decision are two operating modes used in the proposed classification system. Additionally, on the concealed test dataset of histopathology images, authors achieved an accuracy of 87%.\n\n3 Methodology 3.1 Dataset MIAS: MIAS [5] is an ancient and benchmark mammography dataset with 322 images divided into three categories: standard, benign, and malignant. The images in the datasets are all 1024 × 1024 pixels in size. The (x, y) image coordinates of the anomaly’s center and the estimated radius (in pixels) of a circle encompassing the abnormality are supplied as ground truth. CBIS-DDSM: CBIS-DDSM [9] is a standardized and upgraded version of DDSM mammography [25]. The dataset contains roughly 10,000 images of various abnormalities, including normal, benign, and malignant conditions. The dataset is separated into training and testing sets to compare and contrast different methodologies. Due to a lack of memory during training, we picked 6700 images for our work.\n\n3.2 Patch Extraction We adopted a patch-based technique to analyze the input mammograms, anticipating that local information would be adequate to categorize such tiny and limited areas. Furthermore, a patch-based method allowed us to significantly expand the training set and do a proper data augmentation simply. The dataset we utilized is supplied with information on the abnormality’s approximate radius and center. The region of interest was initially extracted using these parameters, and several patches containing benign or malignant information were then extracted. First, we extracted squared patches with N × N dimension and took their annotated labels from the corresponding mammograms. Next, we slide the patch mask over the mammogram with uniform step size and took only those region of interest (ROI) with a certain number of suspicious pixels (see Fig. 1). Then, we used a sliding window algorithm to create multiple patches from the extracted region of interest. We are able to feed models with varied inputs since every patch that is ultimately chosen has a unique visual detail. Algorithm 1 presents the entire process for extracting patches from mammograms.\n\nPatch Extraction and Classifier for Abnormality Classification …\n\n5\n\nFig. 1 Mammogram with ROI and extracted patches\n\nAlgorithm 1 Patch extraction from mammograms Require: Mammogram Images, Annotation file Ensure: Extracted ROI from abnormal mammograms Data: MIAS mammogram datasets Initialization: Patch size, width, height, (X, Y ) coordinates of abnormalities, R (Approximate center of coordinates), cropped ROI for each image detail in annotation file do Do Read images from Benign and Malignant Folders Read width and height of image Find new (x, y) coordinates pairs to generate cropped ROI x1 = X + R − Patch Size if x1 > 0 then x1 = x1 else x1 = 0 y1 = Y + R − Patch Size if y1 > 0 then y1 = y1 else y1 = 0 x2 = X − R + Patch Size if x2 ≤ width then x2 = x2 else x2 = width y2 = Y − R + Patch Size if y2 ≤ height then y2 = y2 else y2 = height ROI = im.crop(x1, y1, x2, y2) end for Use sliding window algorithm to create multiple patches from the extracted region of interests\n\n3.3 Transfer Learning (TL) We adopt transfer learning to develop a patch classifier. We used three pre-trained DCNN models; VGG-16, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B7. As shown in Fig. 2, we employed a recent implementation of deep neural networks that features TL to start a new model with specified modifications utilizing parameters from a pre-trained model for a specific purpose. We began by building a foundation model and populating it with weights that had already been trained. The underlying model’s layers are then locked. The output of one (or multiple) layer from the base model is then used to build a new model on top of it. Finally, the new model is trained using MIAS and CBIS-DDSM patches, and the results are compared either.\n\n6\n\nP. Oza et al.\n\nFig. 2 Patch classifier using transfer learning\n\n4 Result Analysis and Discussion We split the dataset into train and test random splits using the ratio of 70:30. The experiments were run for 100 epochs with a batch size of 128. We considered accuracy and loss as performance parameters for our models. Figures 3 and 4 depict the training and validation performance of all the models, respectively. The graphs show that, in comparison to CBIS patches, none of the three models could perform well with MIAS patches.

As a result, EfficientNet-B7 has the best accuracy and loss at almost the final epoch on CBIS-DDSM patches (see Fig. 4c, f). Still, the model is suffering from a very classic problem of oscillation, which can be handled by controlling the value of the learning rate. We solely gave further performance characteristics for all the models on CBIS-DDSM and MIAS patches (see Tables 1 and 2). When compared to MIAS patches, the comparison reveals that all models performed better on CBIS-DDSM patches.

When the fine-tuning strategy is utilized, the deep neural model’s classification accuracy increases. We observed that all of the models employed in this work performed better on CBIS-DDSM patches than on MIAS patches, owing to the dataset’s restricted number of images and patches generated from them not being enough to train the massive DCNN models. On both datasets, ResNet-50 is also shown to be relatively stable.

There exist certain challenges while selecting the fuzzy membership function parameters that can eventually affect the performance of the fuzzy-based classification system. This paper proposes a particle swarm optimization-based fuzzy rule-based system for classification problems. The proposed model focuses on optimizing the membership function parameters using particle swarm optimization. Particle swarm optimization algorithm optimizes the parameters of the triangular membership function to improve the performance of fuzzy rule-based systems. Two datasets—iris and appendicitis—with various combinations of partition type and rule induction algorithms are used to evaluate the proposed model. Along with the proposed model, a simple fuzzy rule-based system without particle swarm optimization is developed, having the same combination of partition type and rule induction algorithm for comparison. In the case of IRIS dataset, using the combination of hierarchical fuzzy partition, prototyping and Wang– Mendel rule induction algorithm, the developed fuzzy rule-based system attained an accuracy of 96.86%, 96.86% and 97.77% for 10, 20 and 50 particle sizes, respectively. While fuzzy rule-based system using k-means fuzzy partition, prototyping and fuzzy decision tree rule induction algorithm achieved an accuracy of 91.67%, 91.89% and 92.140% for APPENDICITIS dataset with 10, 20 and 50 particles, respectively. The experimental result shows that a particle swarm optimization-based fuzzy rulebased system could significantly improve the accuracy compared to a simple fuzzy rule-based system.

Kant et al.\n\n1 Introduction The development of expert systems having approximate reasoning and the subjective nature of human knowledge for decision-making is a complex task. Fuzzy logic [1] plays a significant role in the design of such expert systems. The fuzzy expert systems are able to adapt the unknown situations, reason, and deduce new knowledge through experience [2]. Most fuzzy systems can be seen as fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBS) that are applied successfully in many areas like classification [3], control [4], and modeling [5]. A robust and efficient FRBS can be designed by incorporating subjective knowledge into machines. This subjective knowledge is represented as fuzzy if–then rules. A knowledge base is an important component of FRBS that stores fuzzy rules and helps FRBS to conclude fuzzified input and fuzzy-based reasoning [6]. Usually, they have predefined fuzzy membership functions (MF) and fuzzy rules to transform the numeric data into linguistic labels to perform fuzzy reasoning. The linguistic labels are fuzzy sets with suitable MFs. Recently, several fuzzy systems are developed that are capable of automatically generating the fuzzy rules from numerical data. But still, the MFs need to be defined manually or by expert users to make fuzzy systems work properly. In this process, accurately setting the parameters of MFs is a very important task and can be seen as an optimization problem [7, 8]. Several evolutionary algorithms [9, 10] including genetic algorithm [11], particle swarm optimization [12], ant colony optimization [13], and artificial bee colony algorithm [14] were studied in the past and applied successfully to optimize the MFs. In this study, PSO is combined with FRBS to optimize the parameters of fuzzy MF. Various PSO-based fuzzy systems are developed, including finding the optimal hyperparameters for fuzzy time series forecasting of COVID-19 pandemic [15], tuning of fuzzy Tsukamoto MF for the prediction of diabetes mellitus [16], optimized interval type-2 fuzzy system for predictive problems [17], fuzzy optimization of energy management for power-split hybrid electric vehicle based on PSO [18], and fuzzy modeling with PSO for improving the production of biodiesel from microalga [19], etc. In this paper, we have combined the Mamdani [20]-based FRBS and PSO to improve the performance of the fuzzy rule-based classification system. The MF of Mamdani FRBS will be optimized using PSO. The developed model uses predefined fuzzy rules. The initial parameters of MFs are created and then optimized using PSO to improve the overall performance of FRBS. K-means and hierarchical fuzzy partitions (HFP) are used as fuzzy partitioning schemes. The fuzzy rules are induced using Wang–Mendel (WM), fuzzy decision tree (FDT), prototyping rules + WM, and prototyping rules + FDT. The different combination of fuzzy partitioning scheme and fuzzy rule induction algorithm is used to develop the optimized fuzzy model. The remaining part of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some basic background of FRBS and PSO. Section 3 introduces the methodology used for the proposed model. In Sect. 4, experimental results are shown, and finally, in Sect. 6, conclusions are made.\n\nImproving the Performance of Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification …\n\n13\n\n2 Background This section presents brief background support for the proposed methodology in terms of FRBS and PSO.\n\n2.1 Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems FRBS is an enhancement of the classical rule-based system which develops the knowledge about the problem in the form of fuzzy sets and fuzzy if–then rules. The fuzzy set theory was introduced by Zadeh in 1965 [1]. It deals with the meaning of ambiguous words present in natural language using MF. Formally, the MF determines the degree of membership for each individual of a universal set within a specific range. The MF can be given by µ F : X → [0, 1]\n\n(1)\n\nwhere µ F is an MF of fuzzy set F and X is a universal set. The larger value of MF denotes a higher degree of membership. The fuzzy if–then rules are a set of antecedents and consequences that map input to output. A formal structure of the fuzzy if–then rule is given as IF input1 is A1 , input2 is A2 , and inputn is An THEN output is B\n\n(2)\n\nwhere inputi and output linguistic variables have fuzzy set Ai and B, respectively.\n\n2.2 Particle Swarm Optimization PSO is a population-based adaptive evolutionary algorithm for finding optimal solutions [8]. PSO is an optimization algorithm from the family of swarm intelligence techniques. The idea of an algorithm was presented by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995, which was inspired by the flocking behavior of birds. In PSO, swarm particles move through the search space of an optimization problem, where each particle denotes a candidate solution. Considering every particle as a single particle and a set of the particles as a population, every problem converges at one or few solutions in search space. The movement of particles in search space according to the position and velocity of particles helps in obtaining the optimum solution. The position (D) and velocity (V ) of K th (k = 1, 2, . . . , M) the particle is represented as given in Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively. Dk = dk1 , dk2 , . . . , dkn\n\n(3)\n\n14\n\nS. Kant et al.\n\nVk = vk1 , vk2 , . . . , vkn\n\n(4)\n\nInitially, the position of all particles is set to some random values in search space. Then, each particle moves from its current position through the search space finding some optimal solution. Each particle (k) needs to maintain personal best position k . Position of best particle in the swarm is maintained as in the search space as Pbest global best position Pg_best . The personal best of kth particle and global best Pg_best swarms is updated till maximum iteration. Velocity and position of kth particle in each iteration is updated using following equation: j j j j j vk = wvk + c1 r1 pbestk − pk + c2 r2 gbesti − pk j+1\n\ndi\n\nj\n\n= di + dik+1\n\nj\n\n(5) (6)\n\nj\n\nwhere vk is the kth particle velocity in ith iteration and pk solution or position of particle k in the ith iteration. w is the inertia weight. c1 , c2 and r1 , r2 are positive constants and random variables distributed uniformly between 0 and 1, respectively.\n\n3 Proposed Method This section presents a robust and optimal fuzzy classification system by tuning the parameters of MF using PSO. Starting with the initial implementation of the FRBS and then PSO is implemented to optimize the parameters of MF to improve the performance. The experimental dataset is read and normalized in the interval of using mathematical formula given by norm = xinput_i\n\nxinput_i − min(input_i) max(input_i) − min(input_i)\n\n(7)\n\nThe triangular MF with three linguistic labels (small, medium, and long) as shown in Fig. 1 is used to develop the proposed model. norm The mapping of normalized xinput_i data to a specific MF label is formulated as shown in Eqs. (8)–(10).\n\nnorm µsmall xinput\n\n⎧ 0; ⎪ ⎨ = 1− ⎪ ⎩ 0;\n\nnorm xinput W\n\nnorm xinput < 0 norm ; 0 ≤ xinput ≤W norm xinput\n\n>W\n\n(8)\n\nImproving the Performance of Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification …\n\n15\n\nFig. 1 Triangular MF labels for small, medium, and long\n\n⎧ norm 0; xinput 1.0 ⎧ norm xinput ≤W ⎨ 0; ⎪\n\nnorm W 1 norm µlong xinput = − 1−W − 1 ; W ≤ xinput ≤ 1.0 1−W ⎪ ⎩ 0; norm xinput > 1.0\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nPSO algorithm is used in the proceedings of finding optimal parameters of MF, wherein each iteration of PSO will output a probable parameter set for the proposed model. Figure 1 shows the MF is dependent on parameter W . In each iteration, the optimal parameter W is determined by updating the velocity and position of the particle. The solution of the particle is tested against the complete data sample to determine the fitness of each particle. The fitness is determined by how accurate its solution is in the given data sample. This value ranges between 1 and 0, where 1 means that all of them are classifying correctly and 0 means none of the samples of parameters are accurately classified. Figure 2 presents the framework for proposed model to optimize the MF parameter W as shown in Fig. 1 using defined linguistic labels given in Eqs. (8)–(10). The PSO algorithm used for optimization of MF parameters of FRBS is as follows:\n\n16\n\nS.

If stopping condition is satisfied, go to Step 3. 5. Calculate particle velocity and update position according to Eqs. (3) and (4). 6. Update iteration as k=k+1 7.

Initially, the FRBS-based classification model was developed without optimizing the MF using PSO. Then, the developed model is improved by using the PSO algorithm with different particle sizes, i.e., 10, 20, and 50. The accuracy of the proposed model depicted in the experiment is shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Through the above experimental result, it is apparent that the use of the PSO algorithm to optimize the MF parameters of FRBS has significantly increased the accuracy of the proposed model.\n\n5 Result Analysis The fuzzy partition schemes and fuzzy rule induction algorithms were set as in Table 3 to optimize the FRBS MF using PSO parameters as given in Table 4. The combination of k-means and WM scheme on iris dataset attained an accuracy of 97.33%, whereas HFP and prototyping with WM scheme is 97.77% accurate. For the appendicitis\n\n18\n\nS.

Early detection of diabetes is vital, as timely treatment significantly improves the quality of life of those affected. One of the toughest challenges facing artificial intelligence (AI) is the selection of control parameters suited to the problem being addressed. This work proposes a metaheuristics-based approach for adjusting the number of neurons in a single hidden layer of an artificial neural network in an ELM, as well as the selection of weights and biases (training) of every neuron in the hidden layer. Additionally, an exploration of the planet optimization algorithm’s (POA) potential for addressing NP difficult tasks is conducted. Through the process of hybridization with the firefly algorithm (FA), the POAs’ performance is further improved. The resulting algorithm is tasked with selecting optimal control parameter values for an ELM tackling diabetes diagnostics. A comparative analysis of the ELM tuned by the proposed PAO L.

Health is not just the absence of disease but can be defined as a state of completeness of social, mental, and physical well-being. Diabetes is a complex and chronic metabolic condition closely linked to blood sugar levels. Elevated blood sugar levels stimulate the pancreas to release insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels. Insulin deficiency or decreased sensitivity of the insulin receptor, which regulates the entry of glucose from the blood into the cells, plays a major role in the development of various forms of diabetes. Despite many medical advancements, diabetes persists and is one of the most common endocrine diseases of modern times. Major risk factors include diseases, pregnancy, genetics, obesity, drugs, and chemical agents. Diabetes affects many systems in the body and if left untreated can lead to blindness, loss of limbs, and ultimately death. Early detection can greatly improve the quality of life of patients, as with appropriate treatment many severe complications may be avoided. Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) capable of accurately predicting outcomes without explicit programming. Classification in ML is a process of categorizing a set of input data into classes. Many ML methods excel at classification through a supervised learning approach. Algorithms are capable of learning from available data to make more accurate decisions. Recent technological advances in the field of ML have proven to be invaluable to modern medicine, addressing complex tasks. However, despite many advantages, ML methods are not without their shortcomings. Overfitting, incomplete datasets, and the complex task of selecting control parameters suitable to the task at hand are tasks that require experience and expertise on the part of the researcher tackling a specific problem. Extreme learning machines (ELM), originally introduced for optimizing singlelayer feed-forward neural network performance, are a popular choice for researchers, due to yielding excellent results when tackling complex tasks. However, ELM needs to be properly adapted to the specifics of a problem being addressed through the selection of appropriate values for control parameters. This process, traditionally tackled through trial and error, is very complex and is a task considered an NPhard problem. Nevertheless, through the use of a novel meta-heuristic algorithm, the\n\nTuning Extreme Learning Machine by Hybrid …\n\n25\n\nplanet optimization algorithm (POA), this process may be resolved with reasonable resources and time constraints. Furthermore, by introducing mechanisms from a notably well-performing firefly algorithm (FA) [30], the overall performance can be further improved. The contributions of this paper may be summarized as the following: – A proposal for a novel hybrid of the POA and FA that builds on the originals further improving overall performance. – A proposal of a novel ELM-based approach for diagnosing diabetes in patients. – The first application of the POA for optimizing ELM hyperparameters and training, as well as testing of the attained performance. The remainder of this paper is structured according to the following. Section 2 presents an overview of preceding research, covering ELM in detail. In Sect. 3, the original POA is described. The proposed improvements to the original approach and the description of the novel proposed algorithm are covered in Sect. 3.1. The experiments and a brief discussion of the attained as well as a comparative analysis with other contemporary metaheuristics are shown in Sect. 4. Finally, Sect. 5 gives a conclusion to the work and presents plans for future research in the field.\n\n2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Extreme Learning Machine The extreme learning machine (ELM) is applied as a training algorithm for single (hidden) layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs). It consists of hidden neurons that are randomly initialized. For analytical determination of the output, the Moore– Penrose (MP) generalized inverse is used for weights. One typical problem with gradient-descent-based algorithms is slow convergence, often not escaping local minima, and the best example is the case back-propagation (BP). A major problem of hidden neuron number is that it needs, as suggested by ELM theory, to be large enough for satisfactory generalization performance. At the core of every hidden neuron are the weights and biases, one of the greatest challenges is their optimization. As an example, when using N = {(xi , ti )|xi ∈ R d , ti ∈ R m , i = 1, . . . , N } with g(x) as the activation function of a SLFN with N hidden neurons, the output can be computed with Eq. (1) L βi (wi ∗ x j + bi ) = y j , j = 1, . . . , N (1) i=1\n\nwhere wi [wi 1, . . . , wi d], bi displays the input weight and bias of each hidden neuron, respectively, βi = [βi1 , . . . , βim ] shows output weight, and finally the inner product of wi and x j represents wi ∗ x j .\n\n26\n\nL. Jovanovic et al.\n\nParameter estimates for βi , i = 1, . . . , L are done in accordance with Eq. (2) L\n\nβi (wi ∗ x j + bi ) = t j ,\n\nj = 1, . . . , N\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nAs suggested in [18], Eq. (2) can be transformed as shown in Eq. (3)\n\nin which:\n\nHβ = T\n\n(3)\n\n⎤ (w1 ∗ x1 + b1 ) · · · (wl ∗ x1 + bl ) ⎥ ⎢ .. .. .. H =⎣ ⎦ . . .

Output weight β can be computed the minimum norm least-square solution according to Eq. (7) β = Ht ∗ T\n\n(7)\n\nin which H t represents the generalized inverse of H (in Moore–Penrose).\n\n2.2 Swarm Intelligence Swarm intelligence, a subfield of AI [23], uses nature as inspiration to develop approaches capable of solving optimization problems. Some notable nature-inspired algorithms include the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) [22], the bat algorithm (BA) [32], elephant herding optimization (EHO) [29], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [14], artificial bee colony (ABC) [20], and more [31]. Furthermore, some recent approaches that provide admirable performance include monarch butterfly optimization (MBO) [16], slime mold algorithm (SMA) [21], moth search algorithm (MSA) [28], colony predation algorithm (CPA) [27], and hunger games search (HGS) [34].\n\nTuning Extreme Learning Machine by Hybrid …\n\n27\n\nThe swarm algorithms are capable of resolving even NP-hard problems (nondeterministic polynomial). Some recent notable examples include applications for general feature selection [4, 38], applications-related COVID-19 [35, 37], task scheduling on cloud-edge environment [1, 7], prediction of crypto-currency values [24], lifetime maximization and localization of wireless sensors networks [6, 26, 36], application with prediction of pollution and health care systems [5], assisted medical diagnosis [8], optimization of artificial neural networks [2, 3, 12, 17, 19], and global numerical optimization [9]. The potential of swarm intelligence for ELM optimization has not yet been fully explored. Particle swarm optimization has been processed in two papers. For flash flood prediction, hybrid PSO-ELM solution was used and it was published in [10]. The algorithm was compared to traditional ML models. Majorly the results were in favor of the proposed solution. For the derivation of hydropower reservoir operation rules, it was used PSO-ELM in research [16]. This work demonstrates the excellent generalization ability of the class-based evolutionary extreme learning machine (CEELM). Additionally, much work has gone into enhancing the accuracy of ELM [11, 15]. The results of the research verify that similar results may be achieved with less time.\n\n3 Planet Optimization Algorithm The laws of physics have served as inspiration for many optimization algorithms. One such algorithm is the POA originally proposed in [25], which models the laws of motion in the universe. Specifically, the POA imitates the universal gravitational laws of Isaac Newton as shown in Eq. (8) − → | F | = G ∗ m 1 ∗ m 2 /R 2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere F represents gravitational force present between two planets, G is the gravitational constant, R planetary distance, and m 1 , m 2 represent planetary masses. As the use of force F in the optimization process gives less efficient results, moment (M) is used as a parameter in the search process as shown in Eq. (9) − → − → |M| = | F | ∗ R\n\n(9)\n\nThe POA can be divided into four stages. In the initial stage, the goal is to find an effective solution. This best solution will play a role to increase convergence and accuracy. Stage two of the POA can be called the M factor. In this step, M can be defined like: mi ∗ m j − → Ri j M = | F |Ri j = G Ri j 2\n\n(10)\n\n28\n\nL. Jovanovic et al.\n\nThe mass of planets can be defined like: m j , mi =\n\n1 a obji , j/α\n\n(11)\n\nIn this equation, a = 2 and it is constant value, α is defined as | max(obj) − objsun |. The explanation is that the mass of this planet is larger if the objective function value of a planet is smaller. The objective function of the ith or jth planets is values obji , j, max(obj), objsun . The Cartesian distance between two objects i and j with dimensions (Dim) is calculated by the next equation:\n\nDim\n\nt t (X it − X tj )2 Ri j = ||X i − X j || =\n\n(12)\n\nK =1\n\nParameter G is equal to unity in this POA. The third stage is global search. The equation for simulating global search is −−→ − −−t+1 → − → → t X i = X it + b ∗ β ∗ r1 X sun − X it\n\n(13)\n\nOn the left side of the equation is the current position of a planet i in the (t + 1) − → iteration, while the right side has elements: X it represents the position of a planet i t , and it is a coefficient that depends on M, r1 in the iteration t, β is equal to Mit /Mmax t is a random number in the range of 0–1, b represents constant parameter, and X sun represents the current position of the Sun in the iteration t. The fourth stage is local search. As an example, we use Jupiter and Mercury. Jupiter is a planet with more mass than Mercury, but Mercury is closer to the Sun (the best solution). That is why local search is very important. If we rejected the location of Mercury immediately because of its mass and did not do a local search, we would not be able to find the best solution (Sun). So the purpose of local search is to increase accuracy in a narrow area of search. In the POA, next equation is used for local search: −−t+1 → − → −−→ − → t (14) − X it X i = X it + c ∗ r1 r2 ∗ X sun In this equation, c is equal to c0 − t/T where t is iteration, the maximum number of iterations is T and c0 is constant and equal to 2, r2 represents the Gauss distribution function. Exploration creates many diverse solutions far from the current best solutions, and it can effectively explore the search space. The biggest advantage of global search is that the algorithm rarely gets stuck in a local search space. The biggest disadvantage of global search is slow convergence rates because it wastes time and effort on new solutions that can be far from the best global solution. A search of the global spaces and local spaces runs at the same time. This behavior guarantees the accuracy of the search, with the added benefit of not missing the potential locations. Rmin parameters\n\nTuning Extreme Learning Machine by Hybrid …\n\n29\n\nplay a major role in this behavior. In the case that Rmin is too big, the focus of the algorithm will be on local search in the first iterations. The probability of finding, in this case, a potentially good solution far away from the present solution is hard. In case Rmin is small, the focus is on global search. The best solution for the search may not satisfy expectations. Rmin\n\nDim 2 = (upi − lowi ) /R0\n\n(15)\n\n1\n\nRmin is calculated first dividing the search space by 1000 (R0 = 1000). Up and low represent upper and lower bounds. With this structure that contains both local search and global search, the POA promises to be effective and save time in solving complex optimization problems.\n\n3.1 Improved Planet Optimization Algorithm Despite admirable performance demonstrated by the base POA, as per the no free lunch theorem, no approach is equally suited to every problem. Accordingly, further improvements to existing metaheuristics are always possible, and experimental research is required to push discovery forward. Accordingly, extensive testing of the POA on unconstrained benchmark tests indicates that the POA exploitation power may be further improved. Algorithms hybridization is a popular proven technique used by researchers to further enhance performance. The idea behind hybridization is to introduce certain behaviors of another algorithm into an existing algorithm in hopes of the resulting hybrid exhibiting the best characteristics of both algorithms, with resulting performance greater than the sum of its parts. To improve the performance of the original POA algorithm, the firefly algorithm (FA) has been used following extensive experimental testing. The FA metaheuristics demonstrate admirable performance, with a very powerful exploitation mechanism, despite being a very simple algorithm with few control parameters. This work introduces a pseudo-randomly generated parameter ψ with a range of [0, 1]. When the parameter value is below 0.5, the search mechanism of the classic POA is used for the current search iteration. However, when the value exceeds 0.5 the search mechanism of the FA with the dynamic parameter α is used for the current iteration of the search shown in Eq. (16). xi = xi +\n\nγ r2 β0 ei\n\n1 j (x j − xi ) + α rand 2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere xi is the current position of firefly i and the distance between two fireflies is represented by r and β0 the attraction between fireflies when the distance between\n\n30\n\nL. Jovanovic et al.\n\nthem is r = 0. The absorption coefficient of the media is represented by γ , and rand represents a random value between [0, 1]. Finally, α is a randomization factor. A dynamic parameter α that is gradually reduced through iterations is used to slowly direct the search process from exploration to exploitation. Additional details of the mechanisms of function for the original FA algorithm can be found in the research that originally introduced it [33]. Finally, the pseudo-code of the proposed POA firefly search (POA-FS) algorithm can be seen in Algorithm 1.
