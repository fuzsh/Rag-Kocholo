        "text": "Overviewï\n\nRaptor Lake processor is a 13th generation 64-bit multi-core processor built on a 10-nanometer technology process. Raptor Lake is based on a Hybrid architecture, utilizing P-cores for performance and E-Cores for efficiency.\n\nRaptor Lake S and Raptor Lake P processor lines are supported.\n\nThe S-Processor line is a 2-Chip Platform that includes the Processor Die and Platform Controller Hub (PCH-S) Die in the Package.\n\nThe P-Processor line is a 2-Die Multi Chip Package (MCP) that includes the Processor Die and Platform Controller Hub (PCH-P) Die on the same package as the Processor Die.\n\nFor more information about Raptor Lake Processor lines, P-cores, and E-cores please refer to RPL.\n\nRaptor Lake Customer Reference Board (RPL CRB) is an example implementation of a compact single board computer with high performance for IoT edge devices. The supported boards are intel_rpl_s_crb and intel_rpl_p_crb.\n\nThese board configurations enable kernel support for the supported Raptor Lake boards."
