        "text": "For me, reading has always been enlightening and empowering, and it has sharpened my understanding of business dynamics and of human behavior. As I delved into the pages of various books in 2023, each one has offered unique insights into entrepreneurship, leadership, personal development, and the ever-evolving landscape of business. Here are my top 10 books that stood out and left an indelible mark: - #1 - The Power Law: Venture Capital and the Art of Disruption by Sebastian Mallaby #2 - Chip War by Chris Miller #3 - Play Nice But Win: A CEO's Journey by Michael Dell #4 - Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson #5 - The World for Sale by Jack Farchy and Javier Blas #6 - Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald's by Ray Kroc #7 - MADE IN INDIA: 75 Years of Business and Enterprise by Amitabh Kant #8 - The Millennial Yogi by Deepam Chatterjee #9 - Good Profit by Charles G. Koch #10 - ONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE by Andrew Grove\n\nIf you believe that networking is a manipulative, false, exploitative enterprise, then it will be for you. But if you choose to exercise your agency and bring your best to each new person that you meet, the possibilities for personal and career growth may be endless. #growthmindset #networking #leadership INSEAD https://lnkd.in/dX4cX37\n\nVery proud and honored to receive this badge! This was truly a unique experience, and feel fortunate to contribute for an incredible organization (@Cadence Design Systems) who encourages their employees to dedicate his/her time and talent to making a difference. What makes a #Team4Tech Fellow? Team4Tech Fellows engage in an immersive leadership development program through a global social impact project.

Team4Tech Fellows practice and hone their leadership capabilities over 3 months through in the following areas - customer centric innovation, communication and collaboration, decision making under ambiguity, inclusivity, and growth mindset. Team4Tech Fellows are passionate leaders often chosen by their companies through a competitive application process. #Team4Tech #Cadence\n\nDay2 #Cadencecares #Cadence #Team4Tech #WITU #Givingbacktosociety We believe that giving our customers a systems-level perspective and product portfolio throughout the design cycle pays off in faster and better design, and when it comes to giving back to society there is no substitute of Cadence. As a company, #Cadence is committed to building an environment for high-performing leaders by providing meaningful work that makes a difference and transforms lives. After 6 weeks of video calls, A team of 10 Cadence employees landed to the Pearl of Africa (Uganda) to participate in a volunteer leadership excursion to educate young women in Uganda. We started the day with workshops on 3D printing, VR Video Editing, Microbits and ended by workshop on Business and Entrepreneurship development. It was a day, full of learning, laughing, and making new friends. The goal for the Cadence project is to build upon WITU’s current IT course to offer a more advanced 6 – 9 months course that will lead to a direct IT related internship. We’re excited to help WITU empower more young women and girls to find higher paying careers and develop computational skills. We look forward to the next few days with seeing how the workshops unfold opportunity."
