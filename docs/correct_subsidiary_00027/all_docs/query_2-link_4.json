        "text": "Press Release\n\nGUC wins \"The Best Company to Work for in Asia Awards 2024\"\n\nHR Asia, the leading human resources publication in Asia, held the \"The Best Company to Work for in Asia Awards\" ceremony on July 5, 2024, at Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center. GUC stood out among over 300 competing companies, securing the prestigious title for two consecutive years and emerging as the sole winner in the IC design category this year. Taiwan's semiconductor industry is currently under intense global supply chain scrutiny. Apart from the dominant position held by industry leader TSMC in wafer manufacturing, the upstream IC design sector is also attracting significant attention. With market demand continuously increasing, various companies are offering generous salary and benefits packages to attract top talent. GUC not only offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract talent but also places a strong emphasis on addressing the needs and opinions of each employee. The Company is dedicated to fostering a diverse and prosperous work environment that supports employees in achieving personal fulfillment while work-life balance. It is worth noting that HR Asia conducts a comprehensive assessment through anonymous employee surveys during their award evaluations. GUC excels in multiple aspects such as core values, self-awareness, and teamwork, significantly leading the market. This is a key factor enabling GUC to stand out in the competitive selection process. During an interview, GUC President, Mr. Tai, emphasized the company's core value of \"People Oriented\" in their business model for IC design services. GUC aims for steady growth, fostering growth among employees, clients, and the company together. The consecutive two-year recognition from the organizing committee validates their commitment to sustainable development. GUC, as a global advanced ASIC leader, offers comprehensive solutions from design to mass production, along with expertise in advanced packaging process IP. This year, the company aims to achieve a record high performance for the fifth consecutive year. President Tai also encourages colleagues, saying, \"Our future will be even better.\"\n\nPress Release\n\nSignal Integrity Designs at Organic Interposer CoWoS-R for HBM3-9.2Gbps High Speed Interconnection of 2.5D-IC Chiplets Integration\n\nCongratulations on the GUC's paper acceptance by IEEE and our member's invitation to present at the 74th ECTC on May 31st, 2024.

(GUC), the Advanced ASIC Leader, announced today that the GLink-3D interface (GUC’s Link for 3D die stacking) for the TSMC 3DFabric SoIC-X 3D stacking platform passed comprehensive silicon testing, validating 3DIC interface hardening flow. The first GUC 3D customer project also passed complete silicon testing, validating a full spectrum of 3D implementation services for AI/HPC/Networking applications. Typical AI/HPC/Networking chips combine large memory with high performance logic. Logic gains power, speed and size improvement when scaled to the most advanced process while the SRAM scaling gains are moderate. Stacking a logic chiplet at a more advanced process node over an SRAM-dominant chiplet at a SRAM-scaling-efficient, less advanced node is the most optimal cost/performance solution. The high-bandwidth, low-latency, low-power GLink-3D interface IP is an enabler for this solution. Other challenges are thermal dissipation and power distribution of 3D stacked chiplets. GUC developed a full 3D design flow and implemented the first customer’s logic-over-memory 3D stacking product and it passed silicon validation. A silicon-correlated design and simulation flow allows seamless implementation using the emerging UCIe-3D interface standard. For the highest 3D interface bandwidth density requirements, GUC developed the GLink-3D interface using Double Data Rate (DDR) and adaptive timing architecture. The modular solution is flexible enough to support users’ buses and clocking schemes and to avoid cross-die/corner timing closure challenge while providing 9 Tbps/mm2 bandwidth density. GLink-3D was validated using TSMC’s first SoIC-X testchip with N5 CPU logic over N6 SRAM stacked dies. IP robustness was validated across a full range of process-voltage-temperature corners, proving BER <1E-30, high supply voltage and frequency margins, and strong supply noise immunity. The next generation GLink-3D for N2 to N7, targeting 20-40Tbps/mm2, 0.2ns-0.6ns latency and UCIe-3D compliant, is also under development. Figure 1. Multiple GLink-3D IPs were implemented in both dies of the SoIC-X testchip: “3D packaging moves chiplet interface from die edge to the most optimal location anywhere in a chiplet, making the shortest interconnect between logic and memory,” said Aditya Raina, CMO of GUC. “Together with CoWoS®, InFO, and SoIC design expertise, package design, electrical and thermal simulations, and DFT and production testing, we provide our customers with a robust and comprehensive solution, enabling fast design cycles and quick time-to-market of their AI/HPC/xPU/Networking products.” “3D technology enables systems combining huge processing power and vast memory, with each component created in the most efficient process node,” said Igor Elkanovich, CTO of GUC. “We developed and silicon-validated 3D interface (GLink-3D) hardening service, 3D physical implementation and timing closure, signal integrity, power distribution and integrity, and SoIC thermal and mechanical simulations – a full package of services allowing low risk adoption of 3D technology in our customers’ projects.” For more information, please contact your GUC sales representative directly or email guc_sales@guc-asic.com CoWoS® is a registered trademark of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in the United States, Europe, China, Taiwan and/or other countries."
