It is a primary design consideration for the majority of semiconductor designs now. It is one of the key reasons behind the emergence of multi‐core designs as increase in power consumption limits increases in clock speed at the rate we have seen in the past. Voltage is a very effective tool for managing chip power consumption. Power management techniques that leverage voltage are being extensively used in power sensitive designs. These techniques include: Power Gating (PG), Power Gating with Retention (RPG), Isolation, Multiple Supply Voltages (MSV), Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS), Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS), etc. The use of the power management techniques also implies new challenges in verification of designs as new power states are created. This talk addresses the verification challenges with these power management techniques implemented on a chip. At physical level, dealing with multiple power supplies and variable power supplies present us with many new verification challenges. Can all of the power issues be addressed at the frontend in the context of verification techniques? Or is it unrealistic to even think that any true verification is possible without taking back‐end into account? Why so much noise about power formats? Some of the largest volume consumer electronic products are using these techniques and how are the chips manufacturers getting them working in these products? Power‐aware verification is a major concern for designs that are leveraging leading edge power management techniques and this talk will explore these challenges while providing useful recommendations.\n\nBio: Shireesh Verma is currently with Conexant Systems Inc. Prior to that he has held research and development positions at Qualcomm Inc. and Marvell Semiconductor Inc.

While software is becoming more sophisticated at defending against various forms of attack, the benefits of each successive security patch are short lived. The benefits of a hardware root of trust extend upward through each layer of a technology stack for any given embedded system design. A strong hardware root of trust is capable of extending a security standard or sub-standard's life expectancy and providing a secure mechanism for managing sensitive digital assets. Additionally, by providing a strong root of trust that is uniquely provisioned to each device, the impact of any successful attack on a device is restricted to only one device. Such an attack would also require a high degree of sophistication and funding for each device, which would relegate such attacks as economically impractical. There are two aspects to managing an embedded system's digital assets: i) securely managing sensitive IP and data throughout the manufacturing supply chain, and ii) securely managing device authentications, setup/configuration, and/or post-production feature/license provisioning throughout the distribution sales channel or even directly to the end customer. In this regard, many system designers and manufacturers are concerned that adding strong security will severely impact the usability of their embedded system. By managing digital assets and device authentication via a secure infrastructure that leverages a hardware root of trust, the usability of any given embedded system may be minimally impacted to maintain a high level of transparency to the end user for any targeted electronic product vertical while enforcing new and evolving licensing models.\n\nBio: Craig Rawlings started his career in 1985 as an engineer with Hewlett Packard Electronic Design Division.

Craig also speaks fluent Japanese.\n\nRobert Madge, Director, Technology Marketing, LSI Corporation.\n\nA New Breed of ASIC for Networking Markets\n\nAbstract: ASICs have been written-off as a viable silicon solution many times in recent years due to the design complexity and implementation costs. Some silicon suppliers have ventured into structured or platform ASICs to help lower costs and speed time to market. The reality is ASICs and the need for ASICs never went away. Significant hardware differentiation can be achieved by system providers using ASICs that cannot be realized using standard products or software. What is required instead is a viable business model for Intellectual Property (IP) development and ASIC design implementation that enables a win-win for both customers and suppliers in a fabless model. The new LSI model for ASIC design and IP implementation feeds off a foundation library of IP, re-used among ASIC and standard products. A single design flow integrates this IP into standard product, an ASIC, or various options in-between the two. IP can be designed with foundry portability in mind, if required; otherwise the IP and design flow is targeted to a single foundry technology. The new ASIC models success rests on two main factors. One, the IP and design technology is targeted toward the networking market (Examples include power management, multi-core processing, SerDes protocols, and embedded DRAM.) Second, the high amount of IP re-use allows for a successful and scalable business model, including the ability to continue to invest in leading edge technologies.\n\nBio: Robert Madge is a director of Technology Marketing at LSI responsible for strategic marketing of LSIs ASIC products and technology roadmap. Madge was responsible for LSIs 65nm and 40nm technology introduction and is currently driving the LSIs 32/28nm Technology Planning.

The software framework on Mobile Internet Devices and Smartphones is a complex interaction of real-time tasks, non-real-time applications, and operating system management routines. Traditional simulation approaches are poorly suited to modeling the overall performance characteristics of such systems. Additionally, many traditional benchmark suites used in academia and industry for microprocessor benchmarking and design have been found to be unrepresentative of mobile workloads. In this talk, we present multiple frameworks utilized for accurately modeling system level performance of embedded systems. We also provide an in-depth workload characterization and memory-level analysis of internet and media-centric applications. On these realistic applications, we describe the performance advantages of a two and four byte variable length instruction set, Thumb2, over a four byte fixed length instruction set, ARM.\n\nBio: Mrinmoy Ghosh is a Senior Design Engineer in the Research and Development group at ARM.

In recent years, on-chip networks have been proposed as the form such a communication substrate might take. The idea is borrowed from the parallel computing domain, which has also inspired many architectural solutions for network-on-chip design. Virtual channels are perhaps the most relevant example of such a cross-fertilization between domains. Unfortunately, the new application domain is tightly resource and technology constrained, therefore virtual channel implementation should not be taken for granted by NoC designers, as usually done. An in-depth analysis of their cost and implementation trade-offs in the on-chip landscape is needed to foster their adoption for SoC design. Moreover, the new application domain opens up new optimization opportunities which are worth investigating. This work aims at exploring different virtual channel implementation alternatives for use in on-chip networks. In order to account for the distinctive features of these latter with respect to off-chip interconnection networks, this work takes silicon-aware decision making as its design and analysis guideline. A complete network synthesis flow ranging from abstract network specification to the physical synthesis and to layout generation is adopted for this purpose. The basic idea behind this work is that physical replication of network switches becomes competitive with the traditional virtual channel implementation inside the network switch under many practical cases. The paper tries to precisely identify these cases by an accurate characterization of the two implementation variants. The work is a step forward in the understanding of virtual channel feasibility for network-on-chip design, and bridges the gap of those studies that superficially take this for granted.\n\nBio: Francisco Gilabert Villamón received the MS degree in computer science from the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Spain, in 2004.

Several recent studies analyze and quantify the variability present in the processing units of multicore chips, usually interconnected by a Network-on-Chip (NoC). On the contrary, in this study we focus on analyzing variability in NoC links. More precisely, we characterize random variation in NoC links and analyze the impact on link performance of threshold voltage variations due to Gaussian Random dopant fluctuations (RDF). RDF will increasingly affect deep submicron technologies scaling from 45nm down to 16nm. Actually, for these transistor sizes, random variation is expected to be noticeably more significant that systematic variability. Obtained results confirm that link delay variation due to RDF increases by a factor of 6 from 45nm to 16nm technologies. To face the presence of random variation the basic approach is to reduce the frequency of the link to the slowest wire frequency. This could be achieved, for example, by leveraging Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS). This technique would additionally provide a reduction in power consumption. However, as random variation increases with technology scaling, other solutions will be required in order to avoid reducing link frequency drastically. In this work, we also propose several architectural solutions able to mitigate the presence of random variation.\n\nBio: Carles Hernández received the MS in Telecomunications Engineering and Computer Engineering from the Technical University of Valencia, Spain, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

Moreover, the set of nodes interconnected by those NoCs will also be heterogeneous, including computational cores of different sizes and computing power, cache blocks and local stores, accelerators of different kinds, and memory controllers. The memory wall problem will likely be addressed by using 3D integration, which will increase heterogeneity significantly, due to the need for locating the hottest cores in the top layer.\n\nTherefore, in order to deliver the best cost-performance trade-off while minimizing resource and power consumption and providing the maximum flexibility, heterogeneity needs appropriate hardware support in the NoC. This talk motivates the need for efficiently supporting heterogeneity, and sketches some results along this direction, describing power-efficient routing algorithms that provide support for multiple heterogeneous, possibly overlapping regions (e.g. virtual machines, coherence domains) in the presence of faulty components. The talk also shows how a hierarchical interconnect (on-chip, on-substrate) can significantly shorten design cost and time to market.\n\nBio: Jose Duato received the MS and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Valencia, Spain, in 1981 and 1985, respectively.

Martin, Founder and President of Zocalo Tech, Inc.\n\nWide Scale Acceptance of Assertion Based Verification\n\nAbstract: Assertions serve as executable specifications describing a property of the logic that is checked in every simulation run. Assertion Based Verification (ABV) represents a major functional verification advance for keeping up with chip complexity. Surveys indicate that utilizing ABV can cut debug time in half. In spite of these positive results, wide scale acceptance has been slower than expected. A major consideration is that successful ABV is dependent on the ability to provide assertion checkers on a cost effective basis. However, creating, using and reusing assertion checkers are difficult and time consuming representing a key factor relative to limited acceptance. This presentation defines how this problem is being addressed for both designers and verification engineers by Zocalo Techs product set, branded under the name Zazz. Zazz has been architected and developed from the ground up with one goal in mind. Increase the productivity of engineers adopting and utilizing Assertion Based Verification (ABV).\n\nBio: Over 30 years of experience in EDA sales and management specializing in early stage startups.

Slight variations in the duration, temperature, and chemical concentrations at each step result in variations from one wafer to another, between die on the same wafer (inter-die), and between cells and interconnect on the same die (intra-die). These manufacturing variations result in physical changes in devices and interconnect leading to deviations in their electrical behavior. At 32 nm process control is difficult, and even a small absolute amount of process variation results in a greater percentage change in overall performance at the smaller node. Traditional EDA tools and methodologies cannot properly model the variability inherent in semiconductor processes. They compensate for this variability by requiring aggressive guard bands, by using exponentially-increasing process corners or by passing the buck to the foundry to fix these issues. In this presentation, we will look at how we can confidently and comprehensively tackle these variability and manufacturing challenges upfront in the design flow. Instead of applying a large safety margin to the entire design, see how next-generation EDA solutions can address the individual variations due to location and relative position on the die for each device and interconnect along a given path. Learn about the advanced modeling that includes systematic variation caused by lithography, mechanical stress, thermal, CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) and etching effects, as well as statistical modeling for random variation. Furthermore, understand how the place-and-route implementation system intelligently accounts and optimizes for the impact of this variability on timing, signal integrity, power, area, and other performance parameters. With concurrent yield loss prevention, risk analysis, and a manufacturability optimization methodology, designers can address many manufacturability considerations in the early stages of the design flow, so what they design is what they get in silicon ...even at 32nm.\n\nBio: Rahul Deokar is the Product Marketing Director for Encounter Digital Implementation at Cadence Design Systems, Inc. with focus on Advanced Node Design.

It abandons the idea of using ideal clocks for timing optimization and bases all optimization decisions on a true propagated clocks model of timing. With clock concurrent optimization (CC-Opt), clocks are never balanced, but are built directly to deliver the best possible chip timing post-CTS. CC-Opt makes clock buffering decisions concurrently with logic cell sizing and placing logic cells, thereby allowing any timing problem to be fixed either on clock paths or on logic paths, whichever is most efficient. By extending timing optimization to operate on both clocks and logic at the same time, CC-Opt is able to exploit significant new degrees of freedom to increase achievable chip speed.\n\nThe maximum achievable speed for a design with clock concurrent optimization is NOT determined by the traditional critical path, but rather by the critical chain of logic stages. So long as the worst average delay along all chains in a design is less than the clock period, then timing can be closed, even if some of the individual pipeline stages in the design have delays larger than the clock period. Clock concurrent optimization is implemented in Azuros Rubix product which is now in general availability and has already achieved its first tapeout.\n\nBio: Marc is responsible for marketing at Azuro.

Ltd.\n\nI/O fabric and I/O control Logic validation of a multi-million gate low power SoC: Challenges and Solution\n\nAbstract: SoCs (System on Chip) today need to cater for increasing functions on the limited number of I/Os which needs to be accommodated in a pin limited package. This complexity further increases if the multiple customer requirements are to be served. This calls for having a complicated I/O control logic that comprises of multiplexing multiple functions on the same pin, slew rate control, impedance control, process compensation, I/O power management and DFT (Design for Test) overrides for these functional controls. This presents a significant challenge in design verification signoff of the I/O pad ring and the associated control logic. Verifying such complex logic through simulation techniques involves huge effort in writing the test vectors and checkers. In addition to enhanced effort, error scenarios need to be created by the user which requires prior knowledge of the potential error scenarios. This becomes quite challenging as the complexity of I/O control logic grows. We propose an efficient methodology for IO fabric and device level I/O configuration control logic verification using formal verification (FV) techniques by taking inputs directly from design specification. This flow verifies all layers of I/O fabric structure and critical functions of I/O pads like reset and post reset values. It also handles connectivity of complex I/O cells (e.g. MIPI DPHY) having a large number of control ports. Unlike simulation techniques, the flow gives great savings in terms of verification effort and time, while the formal verification tool attempts to falsify properties and catches bugs early. The technique of setting up the design verification flow, handling big designs in spite of known FV tool limitations and converting the specification into property suite would be discussed.\n\nBio: Deepak Agarwal received his B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication from Regional Engineering College, Durgapur (India) in 2001.

The expectation from the end consumer is that the complete protocol functions correctly on the SoC regardless of the protocol speed or the manufacturing variations in the technology. In many cases IP development is done without knowing in detail the SoC environment. Using examples such as DDR3 and PCI Express 2.0, the multi-gigabit per second physical and digital controller integration, complexity of the protocol and variations in the 32/28 nm technology will be described from the IP development and integration perspectives.\n\nBio: Navraj Nandra joined Synopsys in February 2005 as Director of Product Marketing for the mixed-signal products that include SERDES and USB.
