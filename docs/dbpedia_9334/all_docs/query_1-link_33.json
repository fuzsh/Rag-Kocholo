        "text": "“Each front person’s totally different. No two blues players alive, really. Alabama Slim is raw, stripped-down, John Lee Hooker-style. Aretta Woodruff’s hardcore R&B, and Albert White’s a more rockin’, hepped-up B.B. King-style.”\n\nARDIE DEAN\n\nPat “Mother Blues” Cohen shares the mettle, pathos, and ocean-deep compassion of blues singers like Billie Holiday and Etta James. Cohen was featured on PSB Newshour for her one-woman shows at nursing homes during the pandemic, bringing her talent and heart to the world.\n\nAlbert White is a consummate blues guitarist who grew up playing behind his uncle, Piano Red, and would go on to share the stage with the likes of Ray Charles, Rufus Thomas, and The Tams. The tradition of high-energy, funky R&B lives on in his playing, immortalized in his two (soon to be three) albums on the Music Maker label.\n\nLeonard “Lowdown” Brown is an electric guitar-slinging blues legend in the Houston music scene. His virtuosic fingerwork and formidable voice seem effortless, evidence of his raw talent and over four decades of dedication to his craft.\n\nOne of the originators of funk music, longtime New Yorker Fred Thomas played bass with James Brown and The JB’s for 35 years. After decades as a sideman, Fred is now stepping up to the mic himself to launch his own career as solo artist and bandleader.\n\nSince 1994, Music Maker Foundation has worked to meet the day-to-day needs of the artists who create traditional American music, ensure their voices are heard, and give all people access to our nation’s hidden musical treasures.\n\nArtist Website | Instagram\n\nVisitor Info\n\nThese outdoor concerts are free; no registration is needed. Bring a chair, a blanket, and visit Parker & Otis, Boricua Soul, Zweli Ekhaya and Mellow Mushroom and other Campus restaurants for drinks and dinner. Alcoholic beverages are allowed ONLY if they have been purchased from an establishment participating in The Bullpen Social District; all other alcoholic beverages are strictly prohibited. The stage is located under the iconic Lucky Strike water tower, and the closest parking is at the South Parking Deck at ATC.\n\nConcerts are weather permitting, with notice of cancellation announced at dukearts.org and via Duke Arts social media accounts on the day of the event.\n\nAbout Duke Arts at American Tobacco"
