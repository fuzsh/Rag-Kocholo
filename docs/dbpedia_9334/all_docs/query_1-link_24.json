        "text": "In 2002, Sergeant Major of the Army Jack L. Tilley asked The United States Army Band âPershingâs Ownâ for volunteers to join a contingent of USO performers for an exceptional opportunity: to travel with his âHope and Freedom Tourâ to entertain deployed Troops throughout Southwest Asia during the holiday season. These volunteers were the first members of âPershingâs Ownâ to go âdownrangeâ into a theater of foreign combat operations since World War II.\n\nIt was during this event that the unitâs leadership became vitally aware of the need to perform the popular music of the Troops both overseas and here at home to reinforce team building and morale. The success of this Sergeant Major of the Army-sponsored, boots-on-the-ground mission became an annual event throughout that decade, and through those performances brought about the look and sound that is The U.S. Army Band Downrange.\n\nDownrange supports the men and women of the Armed Services through popular music while reaching all audiences, young and old, with their continuously up-to-date repertoire of rock, pop, country, R & B, and inspirational signature patriotic arrangements that are popular with all listeners. In addition to public performances as a popular music ensemble, The U.S. Army Band Downrange performs as an acoustic group as well, supporting numerous Congressional, diplomatic, and public events.\n\nDownrange embraces one of The U.S. Army Bandâs most important missions as a strategic, public-relations asset, and stands ready to entertain audiences at home and around the world. The Soldiers of Downrange are not just âpresent and accounted for,â they are constantly setting the popular-music entertainment standard for The United States Army Band and the United States Army."
