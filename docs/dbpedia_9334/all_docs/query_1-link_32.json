This multimedia collection for general music programs serving grades 4-8 includes video interviews with Wisconsin musicians, performances, audio files, and educator engagement guides designed to help activate the media with learners.\n\nThis organization is supported with funds from the American Rescue Plan Act provided by the National Endowment for the Arts and granted through the Wisconsin Arts Board."
