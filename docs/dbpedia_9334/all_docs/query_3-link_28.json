        "text": "By of the\n\nPercussionist Victor DeLorenzo used two totally different adjectives to describe being part of one of Milwaukee's all-time most successful bands, the Violent Femmes.\n\n\"It's something that has made me very happy and it has made me very sad over the course of 30 years,\" he said.\n\nWith frontman and guitarist Gordon Gano and bassist Brian Ritchie, the Femmes became an unlikely rock success story. The bands' folk-punk songs like \"Blister in the Sun\" and \"Add It Up\" from its self-titled 1983 debut were odd, rough, wild and novel, paving the path for multiple albums and worldwide tours. But for the band, those decades were also filled with internal fighting and, to date, three nasty breakups.\n\nIn honor of the \"Violent Femmes\" album's 30th anniversary, the trio is back together, playing some of its first shows since a particularly difficult episode in 2007. On Wednesday, the band returns home to Milwaukee to co-headline the Marcus Amphitheater on Summerfest's opening night and perform that album in its entirety.\n\nTo mark the occasion, the Femmes talked with the Journal Sentinel about their past and future.\n\nGano and Ritchie's first gig together was at Rufus King International School, where Gano graduated in 1981. That summer, with DeLorenzo, the Femmes took its music to the streets, literally — winning early admiration from locals and one famous rock band.\n\nGano: I recall Brian Ritchie coming up to me and introducing himself when I played at the Beneath It All Café on Downer....I later ran into Brian at the Starship. The next day I was going to be playing one of my songs at my high school as part of a National Honors Society inductee assembly.\n\nRitchie: We went into (Gano's song) \"Gimme the Car.\" Some of the lyrics were pretty raunchy for doing it in a school setting. And we tore the house down. … At this point Victor was touring in Europe with (local acting troupe) Theatre X. I had been playing a lot with him and then basically just said (to Gano), \"When this guy Victor comes back from Europe, let's start playing some music.\"\n\nDeLorenzo: Gordon wrote the songs....Our roles (Brian and I) eventually fit into was that of arrangers....Brian really liked the Rolling Stones, I had been steeped in quite a jazz tradition, and Gordon was into really hard-core country music. The combination of bits of those three things is really what influenced our sound.\n\nGano: We couldn't get anybody to let us play. ...We were playing by the Oriental Theatre, and we saw the Pretenders were playing that night, and we thought we could play for the line of people and could have the biggest audience we could ever have because they were in line and couldn't run away from us....(The Pretenders were) there early for loading and sound check, so they all came out and listened to us, and (frontwoman) Chrissie Hynde came up and said we could play three songs. So we went into the Oriental and had this amazing experience.\n\nThe Femmes' following started expanding beyond Milwaukee, most significantly with the release of its 1983 self-titled debut album, on Slash Records. By 1991 more than a million copies had been sold in the U.S. alone.\n\nRitchie: They said if we gave them the record, they'd release it. So we signed a really crappy record deal with them, and the most pathetic part about it was we didn't even get an advance....But at least we had a record deal.\n\nDeLorenzo: Early on it was like, \"Well is anything going to happen with this?... Gone for a lot of weeks at a time, coming home not having much to show for it money-wise, that's what kind of stands out for me, the struggle.\n\nRitchie: The first album is focused on really uncomfortable observations...of the way teenagers look at themselves and at the world....People listen to that, especially young people, and they say \"That's exactly how I feel.\"\n\nIn 1984, the Femmes released earnest, spiritual, country-flavored \"Hallowed Ground,\" because, as Ritchie put it, \"we wanted to freak people out.\" The label hated it, as did many fans, but the Femmes moved forward with \"The Blind Leading the Naked\" in 1986 — and soon after broke up for the first time.\n\nThe band was back in business in 1988, but by 1993, DeLorenzo was out, replaced by local musician Guy Hoffman (the BoDeans, Oil Tasters). Two albums with Hoffman followed, including the band's last studio effort, \"Freak Magnet,\" released in 2000, the same year DeLorenzo rejoined the group.\n\nRitchie: The best thing about the very early years of Femmes was there was a lot of freedom.... Once we got involved in the music industry, I suppose that's when ugly things start to happen.\n\nDeLorenzo: I lost my faith in what we were doing, and I lost my faith in the people that I was doing it with.... The road is horrible. It's fraught with loneliness and confusion and wanton feelings of a better life.... Gordon and Brian kicked me out — or did I quit? It's probably a little bit of both, depending on who you talk to.\n\nRitchie: (Around 2000) Guy was also frustrated being in the band for various reasons,...probably mainly because he might have been perceived as a sideman and would have liked more to be considered a member of the band....And then this coincided with a reissue of our first album.\n\nDeLorenzo: I helped them with putting together the booklet (for the reissue), and then the whole second CD was all culled from my archive.... Nine years had gone by, and I felt... maybe we can be in each others' worlds again. Maybe it will be OK. And turned out that it was OK for a while.\n\nThe Femmes \"didn't have any record company saying they wanted another record,\" but Gano said touring life was going well. Then in 2007 came an apparent death blow, when Ritchie filed a lawsuit against Gano, seeking proper accounting of the band's earnings and half ownership of songs. In the lawsuit, Ritchie also took offense with Gano allowing the use of \"Blister in the Sun\" in a Wendy's commercial.\n\nRitchie: Gordon and I have an agreement not to talk about this stuff....I wasn't really sure what would happen (by filing the lawsuit). What's done is done.\n\nDeLorenzo: Brian had wanted me to join the lawsuit, and I said I didn't want to because, No. 1, I didn't have the money to do it and, No. 2, the premise of his lawsuit was completely ridiculous....Really, this is going to happen again? The band is going to break up another time? I couldn't fathom it. Quite frankly, it made me sick to my stomach.\n\nGano: My view of it was that was his decision, and it made it so it was ending the group, and I had to deal with whatever legal aspects had to be dealt with.\n\nRitchie: To me it was no tragedy that the Femmes didn't work for six years. It actually opened up a lot of doors....I moved to Australia. ...I'm the music curator at the Museum of Old and New Art in Tasmania....My life is much more satisfying.\n\nGano said the case was \"dismissed with prejudice,\" and everything was settled out of court about 18 months ago. Then last year, the band was approached to play a reunion show at major California music festival Coachella, prompting the three original members to be in the same room for the first time in more than five years in April. A few more shows were booked, including Wednesday's Summerfest kick-off, but where the Femmes go after that is uncertain.\n\nGano: The reunion is surprising, definitely.\n\nRitchie: I wasn't surprised. I knew it would happen sooner or later. It was just a question of how, when and why. It didn't take very long to shake the rust off....We're just in the business right now of getting up and doing a few shows and entertaining people and focusing on the music.\n\nDeLorenzo: All those tensions still remain. Unless we sit down with some sort of spiritual mediator, I don't know if we'd ever get to the bottom of the problems and solve them once and for all....It might be to the point now where ... if it's run as a cordial business, it might be OK to stomach.\n\nGano: It was exhilarating (playing Coachella), and there was that little feeling of not knowing how people would react.\n\nDeLorenzo: For me, there were so many different deja vu moments, thinking back to standing on the stage with those two guys on all these different, great stages across the face of the earth and just everything we've accomplished.\n\nRitchie: It's so appropriate to play in Milwaukee to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album. It's something that we owed to the Milwaukee crowd. They're the ones that put us on the map.\n\n***\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWho: Violent Femmes with the Avett Brothers, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and Ivan & Alyosha\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Wednesday\n\nWhere: Marcus Amphitheater, Summerfest\n\nFemmes tickets: $53.50 to $71.45 at the box office, (800) 745-3000 and ticketmaster.com.
