        "text": "The Faragher Brothers will bring their “Family Soul” to the Alcazar Theater in Carpinteria, Friday Aug. 9 and Saturday Aug. 10.\n\nDoo-Wop and funk from the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s — the family band will perform songs from their inspired debut “yellow album,” and more.\n\nThe Faragher Brothers band is from Redlands, California. Growing up in a family of eight siblings, the Faraghers were constantly surrounded by music. In the mid-1970s they formed a family group, The Faragher Brothers.\n\nOriginally consisting of four brothers (Danny, Jimmy, Davey and Tommy), they were later joined by sister Pammy and brother Marty. They recorded four albums; appeared on shows like “Soul Train” and “American Bandstand;” and toured and performed with artists such as Rufus and Tower of Power.\n\nThe group has four Grammy Award-nominations and a Grammy Award among them.\n\nThe Faragher Brothers have reunited to perform their soulful original songs from the ’70s, as well as to create new music in the spirit of that era.\n\nFamily members Charlie and Daisy Faragher have joined the group, adding new talent on drums (Charlie) and alto sax/vocals (Daisy)."
