Others hung out, took pictures in front of the \"Claws Up\" banner, and danced their way to their seats.\n\nThe Greenfield High School band and Rufus King High School drumline provided the music for tailgaters.\n\n\"It's to hype up the crowd but also for us its to have fun,\" said Zackary Munoz, a student at Greenfield High School.\n\nIt's the students first time playing for tailgaters outside of a Milwaukee Brewers game. Munoz credits his music teacher for finding the gig.\n\n\"She decided to jump right on the opportunity,\" said Munoz.\n\nPeople gathered around, took videos and danced to the music.\n\n\"It added something to the parking lot instead of just sit here and watch people,\" said Lynn Demerath. \"It was very entertaining.\n\nIt was nice to see the young people involved.\"\n\nThe band started at 1 p.m. and lasted until the game started at 3:37 p.m."
