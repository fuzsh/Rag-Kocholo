Rufus King wrote the hit song \"Just What I Need\" which is featured in the #1 US Hit Movie \"Bring It On\". Biography THE HIT SONG by RUFUS KING, \"JUST WHAT I NEED\", IS FEATURED IN THE #1 US HIT MOVIE, \"BRING IT ON.\" Amusing comments, sincere expression and youthful antics, on and off stage, could only describe one band---Rufus King. Rufus King is made up of three guys from a small town in Northern California called Woodland - or Woodlone. Rufus King's lyrical honesty mixed with ardent humor exposes issues of lost love and deluded dreams of ruling the world. Catchy guitar hooks, structured bass/drum rhythms and infectious vocals is how to best describe Rufus King. They have acquired a strong following and solid reputation since moving to the Los Angeles area in 1997. Rufus King has been playing together since 1993 - their early days in High School.
