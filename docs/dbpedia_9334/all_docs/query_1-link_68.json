        "text": "Otis Redding is killed in a plane crash\n\nRedding was back in the studio in in late November of 1967 to record “Dock of the Bay” before setting off on a quick three-night tour of Nashville, Cleveland, Ohio and Madison, Wis. with the Bar-Keys.\n\nJust moments after being cleared for landing in Madison, the band’s private plane - hindered by a low battery that affected the instrument panel - careened out of the sky and into a frigid lake, killing Otis Redding, guitarist Jimmy King, drummer Carl Cunningham, saxophonist Phalon Jones, organist Ronnie Caldwell, valet Matthew Kelly and pilot Richard Fraser. Trumpeter Ben Cauley was the only survivor.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. is assassinated in Memphis\n\nMemphis’ racial tension came to a head when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis after speaking to the city’s striking sanitation workers (the Lorraine had been a regular gathering place for Stax employees, both black and white).\n\nWhen citizens rioted in the streets after King’s murder, Stax’s building was left untouched, but the studio’s atmosphere as a creative respite with no regards for race was forever altered.\n\nStax's deal with Atlantic Records crumbles\n\nAtlantic Records (Stax’s distributor) was sold to Warner Bros. in 1967. Jim Stewart made several attempts to negotiate a new distribution deal after the sale, first to join Atlantic in its buyout and then directly with Warner Bros.\n\nWhen neither offer was to Stewart’s liking, Stax asked Warner for their master tapes back. Warner refused, citing a clause in Stax’s original contract that gave Atlantic “all right, title and interest, including any rights of reproduction, in all Stax's Atlantic-distributed recordings between 1960 and 1967. Warner also took control of Sam and Dave, who had been “on loan” to Stax as part of their original deal with Atlantic."
