        "text": "As I recall, Motorhead were fairly well known, but I don't think they ever made it beyond theater size venues on their own. For comparison's sake, not nearly as popular as Iron Maiden or Def Leppard, but far more known than Saxon or Angel Witch. You may be onto something with Lemmy-I think a lot more people know who he was than the band he was in.\n\nThey didn't sell records but they were a dependable draw on the road. A lot like the Ramones. In NYC they would play places like Roseland and that's not bad. It's not the Garden but it's better than a lot of bands can do. The last time I saw them was in Boston at the HOB in 2009 or 10 and it was pretty full as far as I can remember. So they weren't huge but they did well.\n\nWhat is this a joke?\n\nHow big are and were Motorhead in and after their time? Really?\n\nWell if you consider album sales and popular amongst majority of society, then Def Lepard is you bag. And we're glad you need to ask, cuz like Lem said \"if your number one your doing something wrong\" \"because the majority of people/music fans are dunce\"\n\nThe second part I know I got the words wrong but his meaning/message right.\n\nHeck, so what if the Lep's or Metallic's sold more records and had radio.\n\nMotorhead worked harder than both combined and put out a catalog of music much larger.and better.\n\nThey did what musicians are supposed to do.. go out and tour/play, WORKED! not cry about not being able to sell albums anymore. Way to many platinum bands cried that (Pumpkins and so any others) they took for granted fame's money because they thought they were great but it was only popular, no where near being great as a band, just look at Iron Maiden, their a real band, they are them and and liked the world over and radio,video promotion didn't put them there... they did what a band should do.. play and be real.\n\nIn ending, Motorhead did exactly what they wanted and are liked and respected the around the world, money and popular are short lived.\n\nNobody should question anything about Motorhead as being big.\n\nI was listening to them right now! Gotta go to work tomorrow where I'll be in a classroom packed with kids, so I'm feeling a little angry: angry at the stupidity shown by this community! (When I say \"packed,\" I mean no way there can be \"social distancing.\") Motorhead seemed to fit the mood, so there ya go.\n\nWhen I was in high school in the late 80s, the \"bad kids\" listened to Motorhead. So I guess that kinda made them a \"niche\" group: popular among a certain group, but definitely not \"mainstream.\"\n\nOh yeah, I'm in the U.S.\n\nActually, the last four cracked the top 100: Motörhead discography - Wikipedia . I don't think sales really had anything to do with the respect American bands have for Motörhead and/or Lemmy. They are fans, and as mucicians, may be better suited for appreciating their ouvre."
