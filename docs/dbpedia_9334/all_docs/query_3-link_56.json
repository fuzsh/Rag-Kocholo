It's among Mahler's best known symphonies: its distinguishing features include the assertive trumpet solo that begins the symphony, with its dotted rhythm very similar to the opening of another great Fifth: Beethoven's. Then there's the famously emotional Adagietto slow movement, memorably used in the 1971 film Death in Venice.\n\nSix of the best: classical music in the movies\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nPROM 5\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £10-£44\n\nSchoenberg Pelleas and Melisande, Zemlinsky The Mermaid\n\nBBC National Orchestra of Wales/Ryan Bancroft\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nRecorded for broadcast on BBC Four\n\nPROM 6\n\n7pm Royal Albert Hall, £15-£64\n\nVerdi Requiem\n\nLatonia Moore (soprano), Karen Cargill (mezzo-soprano), SeokJong Baek (tenor), Solomon Howard (bass); BBC National Chorus of Wales, Crouch End Festival Chorus, BBC National Orchestra of Wales/Ryan Bancroft\n\nWork in focus: Verdi's Requiem\n\nAs we've discussed elsewhere, Requiems in classical music tend to sit somewhere on a spectrum from gentle and ethereal (Fauré's, see Prom 59 below) to blood and thunder / fire and brimstone (well, Verdi's, actually).\n\nThe Italian composer's Requiem is the most visceral and theatrical in the requiem repertoire. It begins with terrifying thwacks from the bass drum and a dramatic cascading chorus, and it never (well rarely) lets the tension drop. Perhaps we should not be surprised with all this fearsome majesty, considering the work comes from the pen of one of the greatest opera composers of all time. Conductor Hans von Bülow was not far off when he described it as ‘Verdi’s latest opera, though in ecclesiastical robes’.\n\nPROM 7 (LATE NIGHT)\n\n10.15pm Royal Albert Hall, £10-£28\n\nProgramme to include Caccini Le nuove musiche – ‘Amarilli, mia bella’, Cavalli Pompeo Magno – ‘Incomprensibil nume’, Frescobaldi Arie musicali, Book I – ‘Così mi disprezzate’, Monteverdi L’incoronazione di Poppea – ‘E pur io torno qui’ et al, plus vocal and instrumental works by Jarzębski, Kerll, Marini, Netti, Pallavicino and Sartorio.\n\nJakub Józef Orliński (countertenor); Il Pomo d’Oro\n\nWhat is a countertenor?\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nPROM 8\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £11–£54\n\nNick Drake: An Orchestral Celebration\n\nBBC Symphony Orchestra/Jules Buckley\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nPROM 9\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £10–£44\n\nBrahms Symphony No. 3 in F major, Schoenberg Verklärte Nacht, Mahler Kindertotenlieder\n\nRead more about\n\nAlice Coote (mezzo-soprano); BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra/Ryan Wigglesworth\n\nRead more about this evening's repertoire and performer\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nPROM 10\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £10–£44\n\nBritten Gloriana – symphonic suite, Cheryl Frances-Hoad Cello Concerto ‘Earth, Sea, Air’, Elgar Symphony No. 2 in E flat major\n\nLaura van der Heijden (cello); BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra/Ryan Wigglesworth\n\nMore about Prom 10: Britten, Elgar, Laura van der Heijden et al\n\nSaturday 27 July\n\nRecorded for broadcast on CBeebies\n\nPROM 11\n\n11am Royal Albert Hall, £10-£27\n\nCBeebies Prom: Wildlife Jamboree\n\nFeaturing Andy Day (from ‘Andy’s Adventures’), Dodge T.

(UK premiere), Copland Billy the Kid – suite, Barber Adagio for strings, Gershwin Rhapsody in Blue, Ives The Unanswered Question, John Adams Harmonielehre\n\nSteven Osborne (piano); Sinfonia of London/John Wilson\n\nWork in focus: Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue\n\nThink of some iconic openings to pieces of music. What have you come up with? The opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, we'll bet. Perhaps that of another Fifth, Mahler's (the two are not dissimilar, as discussed above). Maybe the start of Mozart's Symphony No. 40?\n\nThe beginning of George Gershwin's iconic, game-changing Rhapsody in Blue probably belongs in this exalted company. Yes, it's that incredible clarinet glissando, that irresistibly joyous, rising motif in which the woodwind solo seems to ascend into the clouds.\n\nGershwin first set down Rhapsody in Blue in 1924, for solo piano and jazz band. It was immediately distinctive for its captivating merging of sounds from the worlds of classical and jazz (the 1920s were a rich time for this kind of boundary crossing: see also Ravel's great Piano Concerto and works by the likes of Milhaud and Martinů). The piece was first performed with Gershwin himself at the piano.\n\nRhapsody in Blue got several orchestrations from Ferde Grofé (like Gershwin, one of the greatest American composers of all time). Best known among these (and the version in which the work is most often heard) was the full symphonic score from 1942.\n\nMonday 5 August\n\nPROM 22 (Relaxed Prom)\n\n11.15am Royal Albert Hall, £10–£27\n\nBraimah Kanneh-Mason (violin), Sheku Kanneh-Mason (cello), Plínio Fernandes (guitar), Jess Gillam (presenter), Fantasia Orchestra/Tom Fetherstonhaugh\n\nAudio-described by Timna Fibert / British Sign Language-interpreted by Angie Newman\n\nPROM 23\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £11–£54\n\nRachmaninov Symphonic Dances, Busoni Piano Concerto\n\nBenjamin Grosvenor (piano); Rodolfus Choir, London Philharmonic Choir, London Philharmonic Orchestra/Edward Gardner\n\nTuesday 6 August\n\nPROM 24\n\n7pm Royal Albert Hall, £11–£54\n\nPurcell The Fairy Queen (semi-staged; sung and spoken in English, with English surtitles)\n\nPaulina Francisco (soprano), Georgia Burashko (mezzo-soprano), Rebecca Leggett (mezzo-soprano), Juliette Mey (mezzo-soprano), Rodrigo Carreto (tenor), Ilja Aksionov (tenor), Hugo Herman-Wilson (baritone), Benjamin Schilperoort (bass-baritone); Compagnie Käfig, Les Arts Florissants/Paul Agnew/dir.

He must have been deeply inspired by the drama and heft of the older composer's work, as the Ninth (also, and deservedly, known as the 'Great') has an epic power and grandeur that's not often heard elsewhere in Schubert. Its distinctive features include a wonderful first movement that manages to be solemn, boisterous and emotional by turns.\n\nThen there's the poignant, ardent slow movement, much beloved by Schumann (who heard the series of repeated horn notes in the middle as 'calling as through from another sphere'). There's plenty of rhythmic energy across all four movements, and you'll also notice that the brass section in particular gets a really good workout. A wonderful symphony that, with the right performance, can be quite transcendental.\n\nMonday 12 August\n\nPROM 32\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £11–£54\n\nGrace Williams Concert Overture, Sir Karl Jenkins Stravaganza (BBC commission), Farrenc Overture No. 1, Beethoven Symphony No. 7 in A major\n\nSix of the best: works by Louise Farrenc\n\nJess Gillam (soprano saxophone), BBC National Orchestra of Wales/Nil Venditti\n\nTuesday 13 August\n\nPROM 33\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £11–£54\n\nElgar Overture ‘Cockaigne (In London Town)’, Holst Hammersmith, Stanford Songs of Faith – ‘To the Soul’; ‘Tears’; ‘Joy, shipmate, joy!’, ‘The Fairy Lough’, Vaughan Williams A London Symphony (Symphony No. 2)\n\nChristopher Maltman (baritone), BBC Symphony Orchestra/Martyn Brabbins\n\nWednesday 14 August\n\nPROM 34\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £15–£64\n\nReel Change: Soundtracks at the Cutting Edge\n\nMusic from soundtracks including: Volker Bertelmann All Quiet on the Western Front, The Echo Society Postcard from Earth, Isobel Waller-Bridge The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, Hildur Guðnadóttir Tár, Jung Jae-il Squid Game, Anna Meredith The End We Start From, Son Lux Everything Everywhere All at Once, Colin Stetson The Menu, Tamar-kali Shirley; The Last Thing He Wanted\n\nThe best sci-fi soundtracks of all time\n\nTen best Disney soundtracks\n\nLondon Contemporary Orchestra/Robert Ames\n\nThursday 15 August\n\nPROM 35\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £10–£44\n\nEllington, arr.

Each movement of the suite evokes a planet of our Solar System and what Holst imagined to be its astrological character. So, the movement depicting Mars, the Bringer of War, is martial and foreboding; Venus, the Bringer of Peace, is profoundly tranquil; Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity, is boisterous; and Neptune, the Mystic, is otherworldly. Each movement is captivating.\n\nIt's become, rightly or wrongly, the piece associated with Holst. There's plenty more from this very fine composer to explore, but The Planets - majestic, haunting, ebullient by turns - is certainly a great place to start.\n\nMonday 26 August\n\nPROM 47\n\n2.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £15–£64\n\nDoctor Who Prom\n\nWho composed the Doctor Who theme tune?\n\nDoctor Who voted UK's favourite sci-fi theme\n\nBBC National Orchestra of Wales/Alastair King\n\nAudio-described and British Sign Language interpreted\n\nPROM 48\n\n7pm Royal Albert Hall, £15–£64\n\nSee Prom 47.\n\nAudio-described\n\nTuesday 27 August\n\nPROM 49\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £11–£54\n\nDvořák Cello Concerto in B minor, Suk Symphony No. 2, ‘Asrael’\n\nAnastasia Kobekina (cello); Czech Philharmonic/Jakub Hrůša\n\nWednesday 28 August\n\nPROM 50\n\n6.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £11–£54\n\nKaprálová Military Sinfonietta, Dvořák Piano Concerto in G minor, Janáček Glagolitic Mass\n\nMao Fujita (piano), Corinne Winters (soprano), Bella Adamova (mezzo-soprano), David Butt Philip (tenor), Brindley Sherratt (bass), Christian Schmitt (organ); Prague Philharmonic Choir, Czech Philharmonic/Jakub Hrůša\n\nPROM 51 (LATE NIGHT)\n\n10.15pm Royal Albert Hall, £10–£28\n\nTinariwen\n\nThursday 29 August\n\nPROM 52\n\n6.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £26–£80\n\nBizet Carmen (semi-staged; sung in French with English surtitles)\n\nRihab Chaieb (Carmen), Evan LeRoy Johnson (Don José), Łukasz Goliński (Escamillo) et al; Glyndebourne Festival Opera, London Philharmonic Orchestra/Anja Bihlmaier\n\nFriday 30 August\n\nPROM 53\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £10–£44\n\nStravinsky Symphony in Three Movements, Steve Reich Jacob’s Ladder (BBC co-commission: UK premiere), R.

So we have ‘Vyšehrad’, a grand portrait of sound of the eponymous castle that sits high above Prague's Vltava river and was home to Bohemia's earliest kings.\n\nThen comes ‘Vltava’ itself (often known as 'The Moldau' in English), a sonic depiction of the flowing grace of that great Bohemian river. And sion on we go, via a delicious depiction of the bucolic charm of Bohemia’s Woods and Fields and ending at ’Blaník', named after the mountain inside which (say the legends) a great Bohemian army still sleeps (but will one day wake and help their nation in its hour of need).\n\nA wonderful, gripping sonic tour.\n\n2024 BBC Proms schedule: Royal Albert Hall concerts - September\n\nSunday 1 September\n\nPROM 56\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £26–£80\n\nBruckner Os justi; Locus iste; Christus factus est; Symphony No. 5 in B flat major\n\nWhich is the best Bruckner symphony?\n\nBBC Singers/Owain Park; Berliner Philharmoniker/Kirill Petrenko\n\nMonday 2 September\n\nPROM 57\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £15–£64\n\nUltra Lounge: Henry Mancini and Beyond\n\nBBC Concert Orchestra/Edwin Outwater\n\nTuesday 3 September\n\nPROM 58\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £15–£64\n\nDebussy Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune, Stravinsky Petrushka (1947 version), Berlioz Symphonie fantastique\n\nBertrand Chamayou (piano); Orchestre de Paris/Klaus Mäkelä\n\nWednesday 4 September\n\nPROM 59\n\n6.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £11–£54\n\nLili Boulanger Pie Jesu; Vieille prière bouddhique, Fauré Requiem; Pelleas and Melisande – suite, Ravel Daphnis and Chloé – Suite No. 2\n\nFauré's Requiem: four best recordings\n\nA guide to Ravel's Daphnis and Chloé and its best recordings\n\nGolda Schultz (soprano), Laurence Kilsby (tenor), Thomas Mole (baritone); BBC Symphony Chorus, BBC Symphony Orchestra/Stéphane Denève\n\nPROM 60 (LATE NIGHT)\n\n10.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £11–£37\n\nEric Whitacre Eternity in an Hour (BBC co-commission: world premiere)\n\nBBC Singers, 12 Ensemble; Christopher Glynn (piano), Eric Whitacre (conductor/electronics)\n\nThursday 5 September\n\nPROM 61\n\n7.30pm Royal Albert Hall, £26-£80\n\nThomas Adès Aquifer (UK premiere), Bruckner Symphony No. 4 in E flat major, ‘Romantic’\n\nBavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra/Sir Simon Rattle\n\nFriday 6 September\n\nPROM 62\n\n8pm Royal Albert Hall, £26-£80\n\nMahler Symphony No. 6 in A minor\n\nBavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra/Sir Simon Rattle\n\nSaturday 7 September\n\nPROM 63\n\n10.30am Royal Albert Hall, £10–£44\n\nChoral Day – 1\n\nParry Coronation Anthem ‘I was glad’, Stanford Three Motets, Op. 38, Gardiner Evening Hymn, Harris Faire is the heaven, Ireland Greater love hath no man, Stanford Eight Partsongs, Op. 127 – ‘The Guest’; ‘When Mary thro’ the garden went’; ‘To a Tree’, Elgar Give unto the Lord\n\nSimon Johnson (organ); The Sixteen/Harry Christophers\n\nPROM 64\n\n2pm Royal Albert Hall, £10–£44\n\nChoral Day – 2\n\nProgramme to include: Jacob Collier World O World, Garner, arr.
