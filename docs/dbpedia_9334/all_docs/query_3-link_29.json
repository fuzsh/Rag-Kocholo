        "text": "As part of our 120: Cool KY Counties exhibit, which opened March 15, 2024, we’ve curated a Spotify playlist of 120 songs: one song from each county in Kentucky!\n\n“I chose each song myself,” Frazier communications and research specialist Simon Meiners said. “The goal wasn’t to represent the county, per se; the goal was to curate a playlist of 120 songs that showcases the breadth and range of creativity and artistry in Kentucky. It’s not all country and bluegrass: you’ll hear gospel, indie, jazz, new wave, Motown, opera, techno-funk, dance pop, jug band, Latin acoustic, Irish slides, Southern rap, Appalachian folk, emo, yodeling, R&B, show tunes, “prison rock,” and more.”\n\nVisit the Frazier History Museum, where the world meets Kentucky.\n\n“Break the Deal” by Maggie Cox. (Released October 29, 2021.) Columbia, Adair County’s Maggie Cox began singing in church at seven, playing guitar at nine, and writing her own songs at fourteen. “A few years ago, I just sat down at the piano and started writing on my closet with a Sharpie,” the then-seventeen-year-old senior told the County Line in 2022—“and I’ve been writing songs ever since.”\n\n“100,000 Women Can’t be Wrong” by Lattie Moore. (Released 1956.) As a teenager, Lattie Moore (1924–2010) ran the projector at the movie theater in Scottsville, Allen County. By thirty, thanks in part to his 1952 hit “Juke Joint Johnny,” he was a rockabilly playboy with a nightly gig in Indianapolis. “You don’t like my lovin’ or my turtledovin’,” he brags on a 1956 track, “but 100,000 women can’t be wrong.”\n\n“River that Speaks” by Fred Keams and Seth Murphy. (Released April 26, 2023.) A Harrodsburg resident who lived nearly twenty years in Lawrenceburg, Anderson County, Fred Nez-Keams is a Native American flute maker born from the Red Bottom Charcoal People. “My grandfather is the One who Walks Around; my maternal grandfather is the Red Bottom Water.” He performs traditional and original compositions.\n\n“Kentucky, 1988” by Kelsey Waldon. (Released October 3, 2019.) At twelve, Kelsey Waldon got a job stacking tobacco in the river bottoms of Monkey’s Eyebrow, Ballard County. Each evening, sun blisters dotted her ears—an experience she recounts on “Kentucky, 1988,” a tribute to her origin. “This is my DNA / I wouldn’t have it any other way / When things got rough we did not complain / Kentucky, 1988.”\n\n“Bowling Green” by the New Lost City Ramblers and Cousin Emmy. (Recorded 1968.) Innovative hillbilly musician Cousin Emmy (1903–80) grew up in Lamb, Barren County. “Bowling Green” was originally a fiddle tune when she added floating lyrics and a chorus. In a 1966 TV appearance, she performed “You Are My Sunshine” with Pete Seeger by letting the air out of an inflated rubber glove in the key of G.\n\n“The Sheriff of Boone County” by Kenny Price. (Released 1970.) Boone County farm boy Kenny Price (1931–87) satirizes the sheriff as a petty tyrant parked in a speed trap on I-75. “If you’re tryin’ to push your Caddy from Nashville to Cincinnati / You have to come across the Boone County line / As you’re drivin’ through you better mind your P’s and Q’s / ’Cause this here stretch of interstate, boy, is MINE!”\n\n“Why Not Me” by the Judds. (Released September 1984.) At twelve, Wynonna Judd—an Ashland, Boyd County, native raised in LA—returned to Kentucky with her mother, Naomi. Living in rural poverty, without a phone or a TV, Wynonna turned to guitar, laying the base for country music’s greatest mother-daughter duo of all time. “Your Kentucky girl’s been waiting patiently,” she sings on “Why Not Me.”\n\n“How Excellent is Thy Name” by Larnelle Harris. (Released 1985.) Raised at 229 Randolph Hill on Clarks Run in Danville, Boyle County, Larnelle Harris began singing in his church at six then became the president of Danville High School Choir. In February 1986, his family threw a party celebrating his two latest Grammys—including one, the Best Gospel Performance (Male), for “How Excellent is Thy Name.”\n\n“Ol’ Dood (Part II)” by Sturgill Simpson. (Released August 20, 2021.) Jackson, Breathitt County’s Sturgill Simpson is the first male on his mother’s side not to work in a mine.

(Released August 6, 2021.) As a teen, Mount Washington, Bullitt County, country singer Shane Dawson played on quarter beer nights at Phoenix Hill Tavern. Then, at nineteen, to pay the bills, he started plumbing. But his day job at Louisville Plumbing Co. hasn’t stopped his music: his coworkers say he’ll finish a set at 4 a.m., crash, then arrive first to work in the morning.\n\n“Quiet Magazine” by 00 the Rabbit. (Released August 4, 2010.) A longtime performer at Tidball’s in Bowling Green, the alternative pop act 00 the Rabbit is the project of Morgantown, Butler County, native Russell Brooks, who now does voiceovers and background music for commercials. “Quiet Magazine” is “about doing whatever you can to show your dedication,” Brooks told the Frazier.\n\n“Can’t Put It Back” by Scout Larken. (Released September 27, 2006.) Raised on a farm in the flatland of Cunningham, Carlisle County, West Kentucky, Scout Larken is nevertheless passionate about stopping mountaintop removal in Eastern Kentucky. “They say Hey, we’re gonna put it back just like we found it!,” she sings skeptically on “Can’t Put it Back.” “They take away the beauty and they leave an open sore.”\n\n“Sweet Tea (Bring Me Home)” by Kiana & the Sun Kings. (Released May 8, 2022.) On the ode to her mother “Sweet Tea (Bring Me Home”), Kiana Del recalls growing up in the Second Baptist Church of Carrollton, Carroll County—gospel music filling the air, her mother’s sanguine voice, the smell of a lilac bush in the summer, the symphony of galaxies within her—where, at age four, she debuted as a singer.\n\n“Trip to Hyden” by Tom T. Hall. (Released 1971.) On December 30, 1970, thirty-nine miners died in an explosion in the Hurricane Creek mine near Hyden, Leslie County. Months later, Tick Ridge, Carter County, country singer Tom T. Hall (1936–2021) bore witness to the aftermath. “Just another country hillside with some mud holes and some junk / The mines were deadly silent like a rat hole in the wall.”\n\n“Take Me Back” by Darrell Speck. (Recorded 1959.) In 1947, nine-year-old Albany, Clinton County, resident Darrell Speck (1938–2003) told his mother Dimple he wanted to learn guitar. So she taught him chords—and soon, he was performing everywhere, including the town square. After a stint in the Navy, Darrell went on to hold a variety of jobs: rockabilly singer, disc jockey, and Clinton County coroner.\n\n“June Barcarolle” by Herman Chittison. (Recorded c. 1945.) In 1912–13, as a four-year-old in Flemingsburg, Fleming County, Herman Chittison (1908–67) started playing piano with one finger. By the late 1910s, he was performing hymns at Strawberry Methodist Church. On March 15, 1939, while living in Egypt, he played piano at the royal wedding of the Prince of Iran and the Princess of Egypt in Cairo.\n\n“Tender Kind” by S.G. Goodman. (Released July 17, 2020.) Raised in Hickman, Fulton County, S.G. Goodman grew up singing in church, working in sweet corn, and gigging for gar in the Bayou de Chien behind her family’s farm. “Come June we’ll take a ride around the hidden backroads of this country town,” she sings on “Tender Kind.” “And sit in the dark of this bottom land / Oh, hand in my hand.”\n\n“Some Little Bug is Going to Find You” by Bradley Kincaid. (Recorded September 14, 1933.) When Point Leavell, Garrard County’s Bradley Kincaid (1895–1989) read the neurotic lyrics to the 1910s black comedy ballad “Some Little Bug is Going to Find You,” he composed a melody. “Eating lobster cooked or plain is only flirting with ptomaine . . . Eating juicy sliced pineapple makes a sexton dust a chapel.”\n\n“Steal your Dad” by Dallas Remington. (Released September 23, 2022.) A fifth-generation farm kid from Mayfield, Graves County, country musician Dallas Remington has many hobbies, like yoga, hunting, and four-wheeling. But on “Steal your Dad,” the moxy and confidence she exudes—“You stole my man so I’m’a steal your dad”—probably has more to do with the black belt she’s earned in Tae Kwon Do.\n\n“My Boy” by Elvie Shane. (Released September 21, 2020.)
