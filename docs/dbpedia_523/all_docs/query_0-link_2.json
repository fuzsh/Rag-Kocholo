        "text": "American rapper\n\nMusical artist\n\nEdwin Maximilian \"Eddie\" Hayes, Jr. (born September 30, 1970), better known by his stage name Aceyalone,[1] is an American rapper from Los Angeles, California, United States. He is a member of Freestyle Fellowship, Haiku D'Etat and The A-Team. He is also a co-founder of Project Blowed.[2] Aceyalone is best known for his role in evolving left-field hip-hop on the West Coast at a time when the West Coast was dominated by gangsta rap.[1][3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nProject Blowed and Freestyle Fellowship\n\n[edit]\n\nAceyalone emerged from the Project Blowed collective, considered to be the longest-running open mic hip-hop workshop.[4] He began rapping as part of the group Freestyle Fellowship, which consisted of Aceyalone, Myka 9, and Self Jupiter. Later, P.E.A.C.E. Freestyle Fellowship developed a reputation for influencing a style of fast double-time rap used by rappers like Busta Rhymes, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, and Migos.[5]\n\nAceyalone was part of Freestyle Fellowship releases of To Whom It May Concern... and Innercity Griots and a Project Blowed compilation in 1994.\n\nSolo projects\n\n[edit]\n\nAceyalone signed as a solo artist to Capitol Records after the Freestyle Fellowship failed to break into mainstream radio with Island Records.[5]\n\nAceyalone released his debut solo album, All Balls Don't Bounce, in 1995.[3] He returned three years later with the dark concept album A Book of Human Language, which was a collaboration with producer Mumbles.[6][7] His third solo album, Accepted Eclectic, was released in 2001 and featured Abstract Rude with production from Evidence.[8][9][10] He released Hip Hop and the World We Live In in 2002.[11] Aceyalone's next offering came a year later, and was titled Love & Hate.[12][13][14] The track “Find Out” was featured on the soundtrack to You Got Served.[15] In 2006, Aceyalone released Magnificent City, a collaborative album with producer RJD2,[16][17] followed by the Grand Imperial mixtape.[18]\n\nAceyalone frequently collaborates with producer Bionik, including on the 2007 release Lightning Strikes and the 2009 release Aceyalone & the Lonely Ones. Both albums explored different genres – dancehall and doo-wop, respectively – as part of Aceyalone's goal of “exploring the world of music through hip hop.”[15] The Phil Spector-inspired Aceyalone & the Lonely Ones followed.[19] Inspired by Spector's Wall of Sound, Motown and Bo Diddley, Aceyalone said: “I'm not from that era, but this is my ode to it. I'm just putting myself into that character as a showman and bandleader.”[19] Leanin' on Slick, released in 2013 with Decon Records, continued the retro flow of the previous release, this time taking inspiration from 1960s style-R&B and hot buttered soul.[20][21]\n\nStyle and influences\n\n[edit]\n\nAceyalone has been noted particularly for his innovative lyrical style and content. Some attribute the double-time rap styles that emerged in the mid-1990s to Aceyalone and Freestyle Fellowship, although this is disputed by others.[22]\n\nAceyalone and Freestyle Fellowship were noted for their rejection of the West Coast trend of gangsta rap. Aceyalone developed strong critiques of rap music's commercialization and glorification of violence.[6]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Aceyalone discography\n\nSee also: Freestyle Fellowship discography and Haiku d'Etat discography\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nAceyalone\n\nAll Balls Don't Bounce (1995)\n\nA Book of Human Language (1998) (with Mumbles)\n\nAccepted Eclectic (2001)\n\nHip Hop and the World We Live In (2002) (with Elusive)\n\nLove & Hate (2003)\n\nMagnificent City (2006) (with RJD2)\n\nLightning Strikes (2007) (with Bionik)\n\nAceyalone & the Lonely Ones (2009) (with Bionik)\n\nLeanin' on Slick (2013) (with Bionik)\n\nAction (2015) (with Bionik)\n\nMars (2016) (with Slippers)\n\nAncient Future: Conversations With God (2017) (with Orko Eloheim)\n\n43rd & Excellence (2018) (with Fat Jack)\n\nMars, Vol. 02 (2018) (with Slippers & Michelle Stevens)\n\nLet's Get It (2019)\n\nIce Water (2020)\n\nFreestyle Fellowship (Aceyalone with Myka 9, P.E.A.C.E. & Self Jupiter)\n\nTo Whom It May Concern...
