        "text": "Japanese-American rapper (born 1972)\n\nMusical artist\n\nTsutomu \"Tom\" Shimura (born September 2, 1972), better known by his stage name Lyrics Born (formerly Asia Born),[3] is a Japanese-American rapper, singer, and producer.[4] He is one half of the duo Latyrx with Lateef the Truthspeaker.[2]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nShimura was born in Tokyo and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah[5] and Berkeley, California.[6][7] He attended Henry B. Plant High School in Tampa, Florida.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nShimura changed his stage name from Asia Born to Lyrics Born in 1995, citing the desire to ensure that he won fans based on his merits as a rapper rather than his ethnicity.[9] His first studio album, Later That Day, was released on Quannum Projects in 2003.[10]\n\nIn an article published by Rolling Stone in 2022, Later That Day was listed as one of the \"200 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time.\"[11]\n\nLyrics Born's collaborations with Lateef the Truthspeaker on Latyrx records often see them trading lyrics back and forth in quick succession. Lyrics Born and Lateef's methodology for writing this type of lyric is described by Lateef in the book How to Rap: \"With Latyrx stuff, when we have parts that we're writing that we're both going to be trading off, we write them together for the most part. I'll sit there and write a rhyme, like I'll write a line or two and then we'll break up who's gonna say what, and he'll write a line or two and we'll break up who's gonna say what. It's a very organic process.\"[12]\n\nIn 2023, Lyrics Born's most popular song \"Callin' Out\" was mentioned as one of the \"100 Greatest West Coast Hip-Hop Songs of All Time\" by Rolling Stone.[13]\n\nLyrics Born now produces a cooking show.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nLyrics Born\n\nLater That Day...
