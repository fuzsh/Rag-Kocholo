Their work earns them the trust and goodwill of humankind, eventually leading to the formation of one of the largest organizations in the world, the Sanctus Populi.\n\nPractical Application of Magic\n\nResearchers discover a system that can allow magic to be easily used by anyone, regardless of skill. Many people hope that magic will fill the void left by the banning of electronics.\n\n2009 - India Withdraws front he UN\n\nDissatisfaction with the UN’s decision to ban all electronic devices leads India to withdraw from the organization, although this in turn leads to a recall of India’s leader but citizens who claim the move was not made with the nation’s best interests at heart. The Country fractures, split between these who wish to stay with the UN, and those who prefer secession.\n\n2010\n\nRationing Zeal\n\nAn international standard is set for the use and application of magic.
