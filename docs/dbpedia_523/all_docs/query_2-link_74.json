        "text": "Q: Tell us about a project you worked on you are especially proud of and why. What was your role?\n\nA: CÃ©u Tropix. Mixing her album was a real pleasure. Very satisfying to see the reaction to it. Ages young to old, across the musical spectrum all love it. Winning Best Contemporary Pop and Best Engineered Record Latin Grammy's 2016. Nevermen. Featuring Mike Patton, Tunde Adebimpe (TV on the Radio), and Doseone. Getting the call to mix that record sent chills down my spine. Mixing this record was literally a dream come true. So many more too!\n\nQ: What's your 'promise' to your clients?\n\nA: That you will be happy.\n\nQ: What do you like most about your job?\n\nA: I love how each project has different challenges and the collaboration of making something great.\n\nQ: If you were on a desert island and could take just 5 pieces of gear, what would they be?\n\nA: Kind of ridiculous to be on a desert island with gear but I'll play along. Echoplex EP-3. RCA BA-6a. SSL 4k. AKG BX-20. NS-10s.\n\nQ: What do you bring to a song?\n\nA: Hopefully its potential to be as good as it can be.\n\nQ: What was your career path? How long have you been doing this?\n\nA: Right after high school I attended Full Sail Center for the Recording Arts in 1992. Graduated in 93 and moved to San Francisco. Worked my way up as an assistant / tape op in several legendary studios. Went completely freelance in 99 and have been working professionally ever since.\n\nQ: How would you describe your style?\n\nA: Freestyle with an exacting finish.\n\nQ: Can you share one music production tip?\n\nA: Go with your gut.\n\nQ: What type of music do you usually work on?\n\nA: Something with a beat and a melody mostly.\n\nQ: What's your strongest skill?\n\nA: Big bag of tricks. If something isn't working I've always got another idea.\n\nQ: Tell us about your studio setup.\n\nA: Pro Tools HD. Bunch of plugins and a heap of old funky stuff.\n\nQ: What other musicians or music production professionals inspire you?\n\nA: Sun Ra. Hopeton Overton Brown (Scientist).\n\nQ: Describe the most common type of work you do for your clients.\n\nA: Mixing. Some mastering.\n\nQ: What's your typical work process?"
