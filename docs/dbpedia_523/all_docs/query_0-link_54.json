        "text": "Aceyalone\n\nTen solo releases deep and still working, Aceyalone solidifies his status as a titan of underground hip-hop with his new album, Leanin' On Slick. Looking back to the rhythm and blues standards of the past, the record has already been praised for Aceyalone's ability \"to combine pop savvy with social commentary. You know – like shit used to do back in the day.\" Soulful and funky beats support Aceyalone's signature tight rhymes and bouncing-ball flow. Features appear from Daniel Merriweather and Cee-Lo Green, artists who share Aceyalone's respect for the history of R&B and talent for reminding audiences of its relevance by augmenting it with modern flavor. The title track is a light-hearted exploration of what someone would do in pursuit of the \"superbad.\" Like the Blaxploitation era it references, the track is fun, powerful, and undeniably badass. Aceyalone began his career at the Good Life Café of South Central Los Angeles. Opened in 1989, the spot quickly became the epicenter of a massive hip-hop movement that spawned Freestyle Fellowship, Jurassic 5 and myriad others. As a member of Freestyle Fellowship, Aceyalone helped craft four albums, including 1993's classic Innercity Griots. Since then, the prolific emcee has been a co-founder of the storied Project Blowed Collective, Haiku D'Etat (with Mikah 9 and Abstract Rude) and the A-Team (with Abstract Rude.) In 1995, the emcee released his debut solo album All Balls Don't Bounce, earning massive critical acclaim and Allmusic.com declaring Aceyalone \"one of the greatest lyricists the West Coast has ever produced\" and Bounce \"a spectacular lyrical milestone.\" The longevity of his career now speaks volumes about his lyrical gift. \"You might say I'm prolific,\" says Aceyalone, \"but I'm still a work in progress. I'm just a conveyer of what's already out there and people just don't see it. I just interpret it.\" 2009 saw the release of Aceyalone & The Lonely Ones; an album that draws on Phil Spector, 60s girl groups, the J.B.s and a slew of raw, dirty funk for sonic inspiration. After indulging his love of Jamaican music for 2007's Lightning Strikes, the musically diverse emcee brought his admiration for doo-wop, blues and funk to the forefront. On the title track, finger snaps, falsetto choruses and Rickenbacker guitar dominate the production; a sound closer to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound than today's by-the-numbers beats. And like most classic hip-hop albums, Acey doesn't need 74 minutes, insufferable skits and guest stars you don't care about to fill time. To achieve this sound, Acey could've copped a bunch of samples from the treasure trove of available music. But he's never been one to take the easy way out. Along with Bionik, each song was painstakingly produced to re-create the sound and feel of a long-gone era, augmented with modern flourishes. \"What it Wuz\" looks towards Motown and Holland/Dozier/Holland production to emulate and update classic soul groups like Martha & the Vandellas. \"Can't Hold Back\" is pure grimy funk and, in true James Brown form, the emcee genially barks instructions to his band and engages the crowd in a rowdy call-and-response. \"I'm not from that era, but this is my ode to it,\" says the emcee of the album's feel. \"I'm just putting myself into that character as a showman and bandleader. But I can still rhyme with the best of them.\" And so it is with Leanin' On Slick, an entire album thick with tracks that artfully engage his showman side. Listen, and you'll hear how this guy consistently brings the soul of James Brown and the flow of the Amazon River to every track he jumps on.\n\n2Mex\n\nWhether you're familiar with his catalog or not, it's safe to say that 2Mex (aka SunGodSuns) is an underground legend. His long list of contributions and collaborative work is staggering.2Mex pledges allegiance to Visionaries, Of Mexican Descent, Sungodsun, Afterlife, Project Blowed, the Shapeshifters, Look Daggers, The Returners, and now (with his first east coast alliance) he has signed with Strange Famous Records. This \"golden boy of hip-hop\" is possibly the most prolific underground rapper ever, with at least 35 CD releases and too many guest appearances to count. Through hard work and determination, while touring the globe many times over, he has built a cult-like following that tries to keep up with his massive output.\n\nBionik\n\nStefon BIONIK Taylor grew up in Minneapolis and began creating music at 12 years old. He started his professional career in 1991 at Chicago Recording Company under the mentorship of Grammy award winning mix engineer/producer Peter Mokran (R. Kelly, Mary J. Blige, Flaming Lips) working with artists such as R. Kelly, Aliyah, The Winans Family, Smashing Pumpkins, Izzy Straddlin, Sting, James Cotton, John Martyn and Junior Wells. He moved to Boston in 1998 where he continued to develop his musical abilities both in the studio and on stage, recording and performing live with many artists including ED O.G., Tamara Savage, Lady Saw, Everton Blender, Johnny Osborne and Frankie Paul. After relocating to Los Angeles in 2001, he engineered and produced projects for Far East Movement, Ice-T, Too Short, Griffen, Aceyalone, Kool Keith, Volume 10, Baby Bash and Lil' Rob. BIONIK's music and production is also featured in many movies, video games and television shows including: Lottery Ticket, Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift, C.S.I.: NY, The L word, Las Vegas, So You Think You Can Dance, The Castle, Lincoln Heights, Dirt, Skinz, Entourage, Gossip Girl, The Fast and The Furious 6 and videogames \"Madagascar\" and \"NBA 2K12\". His two latest records, Mr. Gene Poole's \"The God Particle\" and Aceyalone's \"Leanin' On Slick\" are set to be released in 2013."
