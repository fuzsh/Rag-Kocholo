        "text": "We are told that “poetry paints a picture” and the early 20th century saw a poetry movement—“Imagism”—flourish to some degree, on the back of haiku, a poetry practice which is said to resemble a sudden snapshot or quick sketch.\n\nBut all this begs a question—does poetry—as poetry—paint? And if so, how does poetry—as poetry—convey the visual?\n\nIt’s a truism: we don’t see poetry.\n\nWhat do we mean, exactly, when we say poetry “paints?”\n\nIt’s also a truism that the simplest piece of prose can make us “see” something.\n\nFor example, “the white dress.”\n\nWhat we actually see are the words “the white dress.” None of us imagine the same “white dress” and the poetry is nowhere to be seen in any virtual seeing, unless “the white dress” is, in fact, poetry. But it’s not.\n\nWe need to accept the following fact.\n\nPoetry, by its very nature, is not painting.\n\nAll that purports that it is, is just talk.\n\nAnd it isn’t just that if we have an image without argument, we have no poem.\n\nIt isn’t just that image and poem are oil and water and have no true relation whatsoever.\n\nThe fact is: poetry has no ability, as poetry, to conjure an image up.\n\nWe already demonstrated this as simply and fundamentally as anything could be demonstrated. A blob of prose: “the white dress” produces an image in the mind’s eye as well as any poem could.\n\nSo if we are intent on image as a poet, our poetry will only slide into prose to conjure such a thing. Poetry was not invented to make images—we have an eye for that; we have painting for that; unless we say blindness (Homer) invented poetry, but this is only further proof poetry is blind.\n\nIn truth, poetry cannot have any images that are true. The poet bent on image needs a waking: “You should be a painter, then. Your poems will never be sublime; they will always be quaint, sentimental, homely, no matter what the critics say.”\n\nBut you protest: “But what of the glorious imagery I experience (see in the mind’s eye) in some of my favorite poems? I could name plenty! This alone proves you are wrong!”\n\nI would say: you enjoy poems as poems—and what they say is their whole being.\n\nIf some of what poems say happens to include a mention of objects and added descriptions of those objects (suggestion working better than any “clarity” you may convince yourself is “there”) this is no indication that you are seeing anything—a poem, truly, is only heard in the mind.\n\nBecause a poem is a poem only in so much as what it says is its whole being, poetry is deaf to seeing. Your “seeing” has nothing at all to do with the worth or the appreciation of the poem. You only convince yourself otherwise.\n\nI see Tennyson and Shelley, even Shakespeare, quietly nodding in agreement. Your error indicates only that you, if you do have such aspirations, ought to be a painter, not a poet.\n\nLike William Carlos Williams, or Charles Olson, or any of the vast number of mistaken moderns, you are in the wrong field.\n\nCollecting is where material pride, wisdom and love uneasily sit, an endless pursuit which moves product, an endless boon to any enterprise. To collect is to amass, to buy, to own, to bring into one’s circle the niceties of some industry for one’s own comfort and inspection. The collectable items should be unique, if not numerous, and if not unique, at least very rare. Collecting is to break off pieces of some whole, but the item, when found, bought, discovered, possessed, is a shining whole to the collector, and compared to it, the universe is a sad jumble—such is the profundity of collecting.\n\nPoetry anthologies spread wealth; poetry is centrifugal; it scatters itself outward freely. Except where it overlaps with the ‘rare book collector,’ poetry, despite its fecundity, is not collectable; collecting is centripetal; it waits in vaults and rooms crowded with unique paintings, coins, and cars. To know coins, one must darken them in one’s palm; to know poetry, one merely glimpses what every other person glimpses.\n\nThe following list is not a rare book list; increasingly, great old poetry, important translated poetry, and all sorts of rare poetry, simply lives on the internet.\n\nThis, in many ways, is a perfectly centrifugal list, readily available to whatever soul—no matter how mysterious, no matter how centripetal, no matter how hidden, no matter how curious—happens to want it.\n\nPoetry is against collecting. Poetry doesn’t hoard; you can be deeply poetic for free.\n\nThese are books you could own, or read, or memorize, or teach, or learn, and probably already have.\n\nGood translations are necessary, but impossible. Old poems are necessary, but impossible. Good, new poetry is necessary, but impossible.\n\nThe list below is mundane, but necessary. This—mostly from the top of the list—is what you read if you want to know poetry.\n\nIt is everywhere, but it still must hit you.\n\n1. SHAKESPEARE SONNETS, AUDEN INTRODUCTION Modern poetry begins here. A definite sequence: 1-14 children as immortality, 15-28 poems as immortality, etc.\n\n2.

Then along came Alan Cordle\n\n100. LUNCH POEMS, FRANK O’HARA Not repasts; snacks; the virtue of O’Hara is that he’s funny\n\n1650 Anne Bradstreet’s The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America: By a Gentlewoman of Those Parts published in London.\n\n1773 Phillis Wheatley, a slave, publishes Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral\n\n1791 The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is published in Paris, in French. Ben Franklin’s Autobiography appears in London, for the first time in English, two years later. Had it been published in America, the Europeans would have laughed. The American experiment isn’t going to last, anyway.\n\nFranklin, the practical man, the scientist, and America’s true founding father, weighs in on poetry: it’s frivolous.\n\n1794 Samuel Coleridge and Robert Southey make plans to go to Pennsylvania in a communal living experiment, but their personalities clash and the plan is aborted. Southey becomes British Poet Laureate twenty years later.\n\n1803 William Blake, author of “America: A Prophecy” is accused of crying out “Damn the King!” in Sussex, England, narrowly escaping imprisonment for treason.\n\n1815 George Ticknor, before becoming literature Chair at Harvard, travels to Europe for 4 years, spending 17 months in Germany.\n\n1817 “Thanatopsis” by William Cullen Bryant appears in the North American Review.\n\n1824 Byron dies in Greece.\n\n1824 Lafayette, during tour of U.S, calls on Edgar Poe’s grandmother, revolutionary war veteran widow.\n\n1832 Washington Irving edits London edition of William Cullen Bryant’s Poems to avoid politically offending British readers.\n\n1835 Massachusetts senator and abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier mobbed and stoned in Concord, New Hampshire.\n\n1835 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow appointed Smith Professor of Modern Languages at Harvard.\n\n1836 Ralph Waldo Emerson publishes 500 copies of Divinity School Address anonymously. He will not publish another book for 6 years.\n\n1838 Poe’s translated work begins appearing in Russia.\n\n1843 Transcendentalist, Unitarian minister, Harvard Divinity School student Christopher Pearse Cranch marries the sister of T.S. Eliot’s Unitarian grandfather; dedicates Poems to Emerson, published in The Dial, a magazine edited by Margaret Fuller and Emerson; frequent visitor to Brook Farm. Cranch is more musical and sensuous than Emerson; even Poe can tolerate him; Cranch’s poem “Enosis” pre-figures Baudelaire’s “Correspondences.”\n\nT.S. Eliot’s family is deeply rooted in New England Unitarianism and Transcendentalism through Cranch and Emerson’s connection to his grandfather, Harvard Divinity graduate, William Greenleaf Eliot, founder of Washington U., St. Louis.\n\n1845 Elizabeth Barrett writes Poe with news of “The Raven’s” popularity in England. The poem appeared in a daily American newspaper and produced instant fame, though Poe’s reputation as a critic and leader of the Magazine Era was well-established. During this period Poe coins “Heresy of the Didactic” and “A Long Poem Does Not Exist.” In a review of Barrett’s 1840 volume of poems which led to Barrett’s fame before she met Robert Browning, Poe introduced his piece by saying he would not, as was typically done, review her work superficially because she was a woman.\n\n1847 Ralph Waldo Emerson is in England, earning his living as an orator.\n\n1848 Charles Baudelaire’s first translations of Poe appear in France.\n\n1848 James Russell Lowell publishes “A Fable For Critics” anonymously.\n\n1848 Female Poets of America, an anthology of poems by American women, is published by the powerful and influential anthologist, Rufus Griswold—who believes women naturally write a different kind of poetry. Griswold’s earlier success, The Poets and Poetry of America (1842) contains 3 poems by Poe and 45 by Griswold’s friend, Charles Fenno Hoffman. In a review, Poe remarks that readers of anthologies buy them to see if they are in them.\n\n1848 Poe publishes Eureka and the Rationale of Verse, exceptional works on the universe and verse.\n\n1849 Edgar Poe is murdered in Baltimore; leading periodicals ignore strange circumstances of Poe’s death and one, Horace Greeley’s Tribune, hires Griswold (who signs his piece ‘Ludwig’) to take the occasion to attack the character of the poet.\n\n1855 Griswold reviews Whitman’s Leaves of Grass and calls it a “mass of stupid filth.” The hated Griswold, whose second “wife” was a man, also lets the world know in his review that Whitman is a homosexual. Whitman later includes the Griswold review in one of his editions of Leaves.\n\n1856 English Traits, extolling the English race and the English people, saying it was English “character” that vanquished India, is published in the U.S. and England, by poet and new age priest Ralph Waldo Emerson, as England waits for the inevitable Civil War to tear her rival, America, apart.\n\n1859.

(Santayana was T.S. Eliot’s professor at Harvard).\n\nThrowing off rhyme was not a revolution.\n\nIt was a revulsion.\n\nThe yellowish face of Imagism’s moon was not a sign of mystical glory; it was a sign of illness and disgust.\n\nMusic coming from instruments only a little out of tune will soon convince hearers to give up all music.\n\nImagism was a retreat, not an advance.\n\nPoetry in the 20th century did not add image—it subtracted music.\n\nThe great poets of verse featured imagery and music, skillfully blended into a natural, pleasing speech so that neither speech, imagery, nor music was perceived as such–the elements were blended and lost in the poetry.\n\nLost so that no ‘close reading’ can get it out.\n\nCriticism finds the elements when they are not blended; if they are, criticism cannot see them, for the work succeeds and doesn’t require criticism.\n\nThe close reading of the New Critics was mistaken from the start, since it confused desultory, over-elaborated praise with criticism. New Criticism finally ends in the Prozac Criticism of the Helen Vendlers and the Stephen Burts.\n\nToo much focus on any part—image, language, irony, etc—is a sure sign poetry is in decline.\n\nWe’re not sure why–after the renaissance of verse in English from the 16th century sonnet mastery to the 17th century of Milton, Donne, Marvel, to the 18th of Pope, and then Burns, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Byron, Coleridge, with writers like Poe bringing Baconic science (with a Platonic sheen) to the art, and Tennyson carrying the flame–why the whole art sickened and died sometime during the middle or latter part of the 19th century.\n\nIt may have been for a very simple reason.\n\nIn the 19th century more people began to write and publish poetry.\n\nThere was a glut, and gluts will destroy whatever style currently exists.\n\nThose who complain contemporary poetry is prosy and dull usually champion the 19th century and its rhyme.\n\nBut the issue is not a stylistic one. It is simpler than that. A glut destroyed poetry as it currently existed—first in the 19th century, when poetry rhymed, and then in the 20th century, when poetry didn’t. The Quarterly didn’t kill Keats. Sidney Lanier did.\n\nThose who could not write like Keats eventually decided no one should write like Keats—or none should try, because one more Sidney Lanier would be the death of poetry itself. William Carlos Williams—when he reached middle-age and stopped rhyming—suddenly became vastly preferable to Sidney Lanier, at least among educated readers.\n\nPoetry–the art–could not handle one more failed Keats. William Carlos Williams did not conquer Keats. He was simply a sobering balm to the intoxicating pain of Frederick Goddard Tuckerman. The 20th century stopped rhyming, not out of evolution, but from embarrassment.\n\nRather than fail at Keats, it was necessary for the pride of the poet in the 20th century to partially succeed at haiku—and the whole history of modernism is nothing but extended haiku: even modern long poems are nothing but haiku patched together and embellished with flotsam and dialogue–breaking haiku’s rules, but not the rules of poetry—in any significant way.\n\nOur idea is supported by the following: From the beginnings of poetry in English to the first confirmed glut in the early 19th century, a good poem was never a theoretical specimen; it was good in a way that was socially recognized by everyone: A 16th century Shakespeare song, a 19th century Keats ballad. Then came the glut, and millions of would-be Shakespeares and Keats’s made rhyme come to seem the playing of an out-of-tune violin.\n\nThe public gradually fled from the poem–not because the novel took them away, but because the public ran from the art of poetry holding its ears. The modern novel was not an improvement so much as a refuge, and fortunately for that genre, poetry, by mishandling verse, was at that very moment chasing away readers as it had never done before.\n\nAnd bad rhyme did not end after Modernism–one can find it in Richard Aldington’s 1941 anthology: Allen Tate, William Carlos Williams’ only poem represented is a rhyming poem; there’s bad rhyme galore.\n\nFashions die hard, but when they die, it’s sometimes not the fashion that’s at fault, but the mediocrities practicing it.\n\nJoan Shelley Rubin, author of Songs of Ourselves: The Uses of Poetry in America, said the 1920s belonged as much to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow as it did to Thomas Stearns Eliot—and this is true.\n\nThe anti-Victorian, Imagism revolution of Bloomsbury, which gradually changed poetry from an art of song to an art of image through the ‘trickle-down’ effort of its elites, gained the overwhelming momentum of great numbers when its ‘trickle-down’ effort became normalized and taught in the academy–both in English departments and Creative Writing Workshops–during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nAre there any prominent musicians who bother to set contemporary poetry to music?\n\nThe image in poetry became associated with art, while the music of poetry became associated with vulgarity.\n\nTwo brief examples, from last century, will suffice:\n\nFirst: these lines from J.V. Cunningham, the anti-modernist poet, who is largely forgotten:\n\nHow time reverses\n\nThe proud in heart!\n\nI now make verses\n\nWho aimed at art.\n\nSecond: Bloomsbury author Aldous Huxley’s infamous slam against Poe’s verse as “vulgar.” The prim Englishman’s distaste for musical Poe was quoted approvingly in Brooks & Penn Warren’s well-placed textbook, Understanding Poetry (first edition, 1938) which also solidified the reputations of Imagist classics, ‘At A Station In the Metro’ (Pound) and ‘The Red Wheel Barrow’ (Williams) in its unalloyed praise for these two works.\n\nCould poetry change radically today? And, if it did, would the public even notice? The answer to both quesitons is, ‘no,’ and the reason the first answer is ‘no,’ is because the second answer is ‘no.’\n\nHow did poetry change so radically in the early part of the 20th century?\n\nFirst, it did have a public, but not a particularly large or enthusiastic one, and secondly, poetry was understood by the public to have a certain definite identity: it looked like work by Longfellow and Tennyson.\n\nAn art whose practioners are disunited, who have no common expertise, will not be seen as an art at all. Poetry had a common expertise: the ability to compose memorable music with mere words, like Longfellow and Tennsyon.\n\n“Verse is not easy,” Cunningham wrote. But the skill of verse is no longer a part of poetry; poetry no longer has a specific “skill.”\n\nThe Imagists never got beyond a very minor, little magazine existence, but they believed what they were offering would be very popular, like a portable camera; now you can just point and shoot! Anyone can appreciate images–and put them into simple poems–like haiku. Poetry for democracy! Poetry that was selfless and natural! It will be a phenomenon! But the public didn’t buy it–they still wanted their Tennyson and their Longfellow with their gadgets and their telephones and their cars. Imagism, like Futurism, Cubism and 12-Tone Music, failed to inspire anyone except the core of elites who were pushing them. Imagism was a flop.\n\nOr, was it?\n\nPeople ‘on the street’ today define poetry as vaguely expressive, and the public’s perception of something, we have learned, should not be underestimated. ‘Vaguely’ is the chief term here. No longer does the public think of poetry as Longfellow. They think of it as vaguely expressive.\n\n100 years ago the American public had a more sharply defined view of poetry. It was like what those fellows, Mr. Alfred Lord Tennyson and Mr. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, wrote. That was what poetry was.\n\nThe zen joke of ‘The Red Wheel Barrow’ and ‘The women come and go/talking of Michelangelo’ resonated once, but these jokes are no longer funny. But Longfellow is gone, too.\n\nImage truly belongs to other arts: painting, photography, and film; further, these arts do not need to look to poetry at all as they wrestle with the image.\n\nSong belongs to songwriters, and songwriters, the good ones, are poets, but they are known to the world as songwriters; poetry’s identity carries on in the sister art of songwriting, and unlike the filmmakers, photographers and painters, songwriters do consult poetry, not contemporary poetry, but old poetry, the art, for inspiration.\n\nSince poetry has given up song for image as its current identity, poetry manifests no contemporary attachment with any other art. No glory belongs to poetry, or is even reflected back on poetry. Poetry is in the dark.\n\nPoetry, with no public identity, is stuck: it has nowhere to go.\n\nHistory affords countless examples of technical changes which have improved music’s expressive qualities as a whole even as music, the art, remains, in its simplicity, recongizable to everyone. When the piano replaced the harpsichord, all composers took notice, not just some.\n\nThe modernist revolution changed poetry so that everyone took notice, but unfortunately in a way that made poetry no longer recognizable to everyone. Nor is it easy to say if expressive qualities have increased–certainly not in the public’s perception. As far as prose and how it perhaps opens things up, the problem poetry has, is that in prose, one would naturally think poetry could express itself with greater variety, but fiction owns prose, and poetry is expected to do something different than fiction; poetry as art has been developed in different ways than prose. Yes, poetry should be as good as good prose, and all that, but how does poetry keep from disappearing into it? And so poetry–sans the music that separates it from prose, as the art which the public knows as poetry–has been at sea for 100 years.\n\nT.S. Eliot, an honorary Bloomsbury member, and the most respected critic of the 20th century, recommended minor poetry 300 years old as superior to major poetry composed 250, 200, 150, 100, and 50 years before his day. This, in some ways, was counter to the whole modernist revolution. John Donne? Andrew Marvell? Henry King, Bishop of Chichester? What was Eliot thinking? Eliot was thinking this: If my friends and I are to effect this modernist revolution of ours, we must not seem like mere brick-throwers; we need erudition, scholarship, appreciation of certain aspects of the past, and if we are to become professors and editors of modernist verse, it will be well to be able to make the past our clay, for revolutions must feed off the past; no revolution lives in the present day; Eliot knew he and Pound were not Bach, the master, at the keyboard, re-inventing music itself; he knew they were merely sullying a grand tradition with a little sleight-of-hand: Goodbye, Milton, Shelley, Poe, Shakespeare, Keats. Hello, Kyd, King, Corbiere. Eliot knew that when a revolution happens, the past will not disappear; a certain respect for the past must not only be feigned, but enthusiastically pursued, for every manifesto needs food; actual ‘new’ material (Waste Lands, cantos, wheel barrow haiku,) will run out in a week, so the past has to be transformed. Every revolution needs a professor; Mary Ann and Ginger alone will not do.\n\nThe image is free-standing and pre-verbal; it is not necessary for image to fit, or be coherent–it simply is. Why should such a thing be the essence of poetry? Ask that Bloomsbury elite. After a snort and a sigh and a sip of their very expensive wine, they will tell you."
