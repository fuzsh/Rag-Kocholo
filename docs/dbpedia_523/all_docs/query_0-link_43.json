        "text": "This event is sold out. Tickets to the March 30 L.A. Intersections event are available here.\n\nJoin us after hours at The Broad for L.A. Intersections, a two-part festival-style series celebrating organic music and spoken word scenes that have emerged in Los Angeles including punk, jazz, rap, noise, and the culturally infused experimentation led by a new generation of Filipinx artists. We’ve gathered iconic performers who shaped Los Angeles culture through The Desolation Center events, which inspired Burning Man, Lollapalooza, and Coachella; The World Stage, which has kept the language of jazz thriving for generations of musical and literary artists in South LA; The Good Life Cafe, which became synonymous for community within our grassroots hip hop and rap scenes; and Cathay De Grande and Raji’s, the city’s raucous punk clubs. In acknowledgement of the Filipinx artists whose contributions to the performance landscape of Southern California have flourished over the past decade, the eclectic lineup also features Micaela Tobin AKA White Boy Scream, who dissects operatic and extended vocal techniques through electronics, oscillating between extreme textures of noise, drone, and choral sound-walls.Experience stages on two floors of the museum featuring live music, movement, and readings, check out the collection exhibition Desire, Knowledge, and Hope (with Smog) featuring 21 local artists, and catch the artist performance interventions in the galleries. L.A. Intersections presents the musicians, writers, and movement artists who have helped position Los Angeles at the vanguard of cutting-edge culture.\n\nLive music by Myka 9 and Aceyalone of Freestyle Fellowship, Carlos Niño & Friends featuring Idris Ackamoor and Nate Mercereau, Pedestrian Deposit, and Zulu; readings by Keith Morris (Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Off!) and Mike Watt (Minutemen); a slideshow of punk queen Pleasant Gehman’s club flyers and pages from her Lobotomy Fanzine, and a vocal performance by Micaela Tobin AKA White Boy Scream in the galleries.\n\nL.A. Intersections is organized by The Broad with a curatorial advisory committee comprising Jeffrey Boxer, Kamau Daaood, Pleasant Gehman, Michael Grodner, Medusa the Gangsta Goddess, and Stuart Swezey.\n\nL.A. Intersections: Music, Language, Movement was originally conceived as a way for audiences to return virtually to The Broad and rediscover the joy of connecting with visual art and performers during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The three-part video series celebrates a diverse and vibrant array of Los Angeles-based musicians, poets, and dancers who activate the architecture and distinct physical spaces within the museum.\n\nPedestrian Deposit\n\nReverse tension, abrasive composition. The collaborative work of Shannon A. Kennedy and J. Borges is best described as visceral and narrative; highly composed, often abstract sound textures informed by elements of experimental sound, harsh noise, musique concrete, neo-classical, dark ambient, and performance art -- but is not beholden to any one genre. Borges’ use of crude yet disciplined electronics, tape loops, field recordings, and controlled feedback manipulation contrasts Shannon’s use of self-designed, physically activated sculptural instruments made of wood, industrial scrap metal, strings, and springs, and extended bowing techniques; resulting in music that is both raw and refined. J. Borges began Pedestrian Deposit in the Winter of 2000, with the primitive concept of combining layers of electronic sound with no pre-determined relation to one another until mixed. The project slowly evolved to incorporate elements and hybrids of harsh noise, tape collage, field recordings, and ambient music with a specific emphasis on extreme contrast, resulting in a prolific few years of rich and dynamic compositions on such labels as Hospital Productions, Hanson Records, and Borges’ own Monorail Trespassing label, to name a few. In the fall of 2008 PD became a duo, with the addition of multi-instrumentalist and visual artist Shannon Kennedy; and her elements of cello, violin and amplified, bowed and manipulated music sculptures. They have consistently toured the United States nearly every year since, placing an emphasis on the development and evolution of physical, psychological, and organic live performance. PD has appeared at such events as Summer Scum 2023; the 2014, 2015 and 2019 Ende Tymes festivals in Brooklyn, NY; the 2017 Recombinant Festival in San Francisco NY; the 2016 Click Festival in Helsingør, Denmark; the 2015 LUFF festival in Lausanne, the 2013 Milwaukee Noise Festival in Milwaukee; the 2010 Activating The Medium festival in San Francisco, CA; and the 2009 No Fun Fest in Brooklyn, New York in addition to innumerable venues, galleries, halls, bars and alternative spaces in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In 2010, they appeared in Alexander Mirecki's feature film, All Together Now, in performance as themselves.\n\nPhoto: Suraj Patra"
