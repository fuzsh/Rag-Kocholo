        "text": "on the St. Lawrence Seaway.\n\nHavana\n\nApril 1961\n\nWaiting for Marianne from \"Flowers for Hitler\"\n\nI have lost a telephone\n\nwith your smell in it\n\nI am living beside the radio\n\nall the stations at once\n\nbut I pick out a Polish lullaby\n\nI pick it out of the static\n\nit fades I wait I keep the beat\n\nit comes back almost alseep\n\nDid you take the telephone\n\nknowing I'd sniff it immoderately\n\nmaybe heat up the plastic\n\nto get all the crumbs of your breath\n\nand if you won't come back\n\nhow will you phone to say\n\nyou won't come back\n\nso that I could at least argue\n\nPoem 1 (\"I stopped to listen, but he did not come ...\") from \"Book of Mercy\"\n\nI stopped to listen, but he did not come. I begain again with a sense of loss. As this sense deepened I heard him again. I stopped stopping and I stopped starting, and I allowed myself to be crushed by ignorance. This was a strategy, and didn't work at all. Much time, years were wasted in such a minor mode. I bargain now. I offer buttons for his love. I beg for mercy. Slowly he yields. Haltingly he moves toward his throne. Reluctantly the angels grant to one another permission to sing. In a transition so delicate it cannot be marked, the court is established on beams of golden symmetry, and once again I am a singer in the lower choirs, born fifty years ago to raise my voice this high, and no higher.\n\nPoem 50 (\"I lost my way, I forgot ...\") from \"Book of Mercy\"\n\nI lost my way, I forgot to call on your name. The raw heart beat against the world, and the tears were for my lost victory. But you are here. You have always been here. The world is all forgetting, and the heart is a rage of directions, but your name unifies the heart, and the world is lifted into its place. Blessed is the one who waits in the traveller's heart for his turning.\n\nDo not forget old friends from \"Selected Poems\"\n\nDo not forget old friends\n\nyou knew long before I met you\n\nthe times I know nothing about\n\nbeing someone\n\nwho lives by himself\n\nand only visits you on a raid\n\nVergi&szlig die alten Freunde nicht\n\nVergi&szlig die alten Freunde nicht\n\ndie du kanntest lang ehe ich dich traf\n\ndie Zeiten &uumlber die ich nichts wei&szlig\n\nda ich einer bin\n\nder f&uumlr sich lebt\n\nund nur auf einem Raubzug zu dir kommt\n\nI Wonder How Many People in This City from \"The Spice-Box of Earth\"\n\nI wonder how many people in this city\n\nlive in furnished rooms.\n\nLate at night when i look out at the buildings\n\nI swear I see a face in every window\n\nlooking back at me\n\nand when I turn away\n\nI wonder how many go back to their desks\n\nand write this down.\n\nWieviele Leute in dieser Stadt\n\nIch frage mich, wieviele Leute in dieser Stadt\n\nin m&oumlblierten Zimmern wohnen.\n\nSp&aumlt abends, wenn ich hinaus auf die Geb&aumlude schaue:\n\nich schw&oumlre, ich sehe in jedem Fenster ein Gesicht,\n\ndas zu mir hersieht,\n\nund wenn ich mich abwende\n\nfrage ich mich, wieviele zur&uumlck an ihren Schreibtisch gehen\n\nund dies aufschreiben.\n\nmost of Cohen's work was also translated into german\n\nSong (\"I almost went to bed ...\") from \"The Spice-Box of Earth\"\n\nI almost went to bed\n\nwithout remembering\n\nthe four white violets\n\nI put in the button-hole\n\nof your green sweater\n\nand how i kissed you then\n\nand you kissed me\n\nshy as though I'd\n\nnever been your lover\n\nWhen this American woman from \"Let Us Compare Mythologies\"\n\nWhen this American woman,\n\nwhose thighs are bound in casual red cloth,\n\ncomes thundering past my sitting place\n\nlike a forest-burning Mongol tribe,\n\nthe city is ravished\n\nand brittle buildings of a hundred years\n\nsplash into the street;\n\nand my eyes are burnt\n\nfor the embroidered Chinese girls,\n\nalready old,\n\nand so small between the thin pines\n\non these enormous landscapes,\n\nthat if you turn your head\n\nthey are lost for hours.\n\nI Have Not Lingered In European Monosteries from \"The Spice-Box of Earth\"\n\nI Have Not Lingered In European Monosteries\n\nand discovered among the tall grasses tombs of knights\n\nwho fell as beautifully as their ballads tell;\n\nI have not parted the grasses\n\nor purposefully left them thatched.\n\nI have not held my breath\n\nso that I might hear the breathing of God\n\nor tamed my heartbeat with an exercise,\n\nor starved for visions.\n\nAlthough I have watched him often\n\nI have not become the heron,\n\nleaving my body on the shore,\n\nand I have not become the luminous trout,\n\nleaving my body in the air.\n\nI have not worshipped wounds and relics,\n\nor combs of iron,\n\nor bodies wrapped and burnt in scrolls.\n\nI have not been unhappy for ten thousands years.\n\nDuring the day I laugh and during the night I sleep.\n\nMy favourite cooks prepare my meals,\n\nmy body cleans and repairs itself,\n\nand all my work goes well.\n\nI Long to Hold Some Lady from The Spice Box of Earth\n\nI long to hold some lady\n\nFor my love is far away,\n\nAnd will not come tomorrow\n\nAnd was not here today.\n\nThere is no flesh so perfect\n\nAs on my lady's bone,\n\nAnd yet it seems so distant\n\nWhen I am all alone:\n\nAs though she were a masterpiece\n\nIn some castled town,\n\nThat pilgrims come to visit\n\nAnd priests to copy down.\n\nAlas, I cannot travel\n\nTo a love I have so deep\n\nOr sleep too close beside\n\nA love I want to keep.\n\nBut I long to hold some lady,\n\nFor flesh is warm and sweet.\n\nCold skeletons go marching\n\nEach night beside my feet.\n\nNow of Sleeping (\"Under her grandmother's patchwork quilt ...)\" from The Spice Box of Earth\n\nUnder her grandmother's patchwork quilt\n\na calico bird's-eye view\n\nof crops and boundaries\n\nnaming dimly the districts of her body\n\nsleeps my Annie like a perfect lady\n\nLike ages of weightless snow\n\non tiny oceans filled with light\n\nher eyelids enclose deeply\n\na shade tree of birthday candles\n\none for every morning\n\nuntil the now of sleeping\n\nThe small banner of blood\n\nkept and flown by Brother Wind\n\nlong after the pierced bird fell down\n\nis like her red mouth\n\namong the squalls of pillow\n\nBearers of evil fancy\n\nof dark intention and corrupting fashion\n\nwho come to rend the quilt\n\nplough the eye and ground the mouth\n\nwill contend with mighty Mother Goose\n\nand Farmer Brown and all good stories\n\nof invincible belief\n\nwhich surround her sleep\n\nlike the golden wheather of a halo\n\nWell-wishers and her true lover\n\nmay stay to watch my Annie\n\nsleeping like a perfect lady\n\nunder her grandmother's patchwork quilt\n\nbut they must promise to whisper\n\nand to vanish by morning -\n\nall but her one true lover.\n\nTHE NEXT ONE (\"Things are better in Milan ...)\" from Death of a Lady's Man\n\nThings are better in Milan.\n\nThings are a lot better in Milan.\n\nMy adventure has sweetened.\n\nI met a girl and a poet.\n\nOne of them was dead\n\nand one of them was alive.\n\nThe poet was from Peru\n\nand the girl was a doctor.\n\nShe was taking antibiotics.\n\nI will never forget her.\n\nShe took me into a dark church\n\nconsecrated to Mary.\n\nLong live the horses and the sandles.\n\nThe poet gave me back my spirit\n\nwhich I had lost in prayer.\n\nHe was a great man out of the civil war.\n\nHe said his death was in my hands\n\nbecause I was the next one\n\nto explain the weakness of love.\n\nThe poet was Cesar Vallejo\n\nwho lies at the floor of his forehead.\n\nBe with me now great warrior\n\nwhose strength depends solely\n\non the favours of a woman.\n\nTHE NEXT ONE\n\nFrom the original version of My Life in Art:\n\nI lost my tan in Italy and I got fat on pasta and the starch of loneliness. I must fast for forty days. Sabina wrote me from the temple in Germany. She said that the old books say you should fast once each year for the number of days corresponding to your age. She was on the eight day of an intended twenty-eight-day fast. Also I neglected to twist my feet so the heart went crazy. I must phone Patricia who was so good to me. The line is busy.\n\n\"cover of Greatest Hits was taken in a mirror of a hotel room in Milan - I rarely ever look this good, or bad, depending on your politics\" THE PRO 1973 (\"Lost my voice ...\") from \"Death of a Lady's Man\"\n\nLost my voice in New York City\n\nnever heard it again after sixty-seven\n\nNow I talk like you\n\nNow I sing like you\n\nCigarette and coffee to make me sick\n\nCouple of families to make me think\n\nGoing to see my lawyer\n\nGoing to read my mail\n\nLost my voice in New York City\n\nGuess you always knew\n\nTHE PRO\n\nfrom the Nashville Notebooks of 1969:\n\nI leave my silence to a co-operative of poets\n\nwho have already bruised their mouths against it.\n\nI leave my homesick charm to the scavengers of\n\nspare change who work the old artistic corners.\n\nI leave the shadow of my manly groin to those who\n\nwrite for pay.\n\nI leave to several jealous men a second-rate legend\n\nof my life.\n\nTo those few high school girls\n\nwho preferred my work to Dylan's\n\nI leave my stone ear\n\nand my disposable Franciscan ambitions\n\nSummer-Haiku from \"The Spice-Box of Earth\"\n\nFor Frank and Marian Scott\n\nSilence and a deeper silence when the crickets hesitate Poem 17 (\"I perceived the outline of your breasts ...\") from \"The Energy of Slaves\"\n\nI perceived the outline of your breasts\n\nthrough your Hallowe'en costume\n\nI knew you were falling in love with me\n\nbecause no other man could perceive\n\nthe advance of your bosom into his imagination\n\nIt was a rupture of your unusual modesty\n\nfor me and me alone\n\nthrough which you impressed upon my shapeless hunger\n\nthe incomparable and final outline of your breasts\n\nlike two deep fossil shells\n\nwhich remained all night long and probably forever\n\nPoem 111 (\"Each man ...\") from \"The Energy of Slaves\"\n\nEach man\n\nhas a way to betray\n\nthe revolution\n\nThis is mine\n\ngo back to title page"
