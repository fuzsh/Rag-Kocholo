        "text": "MANUELLA'S SONG\n\nSusan G. Butruille ©1998, 2019\n\nThe story does not begin with the gold\n\nThe story begins with the Grandmother\n\nAll stories begin with the Grandmother\n\nThe one who propelled the earth, the sky, the sea, and all the creatures\n\nFrom the darkness of her womb long ago\n\nThe Grandmother begins and sustains.\n\nThe Grandfather builds and protects.\n\nIt is all one. We all are one.\n\nYou see me, Manuella, as the Old Indian Woman.\n\nThe old one squatting beside the water with her pan, looking for gold.\n\nIn the water I see the face of an old woman\n\nWho has known the joy of living free on the earth\n\nIt is a joy you will never know\n\nWith your mad race for gold, you have invaded the earth --\n\nSource of life and joy and wisdom\n\nI see the face of an old woman who has known the terrors\n\nOf seeing my people -- once fiercely strong -- weak and dying\n\nYou say many are gone, vanished\n\nThey are not vanished\n\nThey are dead of disease and violence and broken hearts.\n\nI see the face of an old woman\n\nBanished from the land that once belonged to no one and to everyone.\n\nBanished from the land where the clear running water was her gold,\n\nand the little acorn, gold of the giant oak.\n\nI see the face of a mighty woman\n\nWho yet lives.\n\n\"Manuellas Song\" is excerpted from Susans book Womens Voices from the Mother Lode: Tales from the California Gold Rush (Tamarack Books, 1998).\n\nLISTEN TO THE MOTHERS!\n\nOn Mother's Day, we can do to honor mothers by recognizing that mothering isn't just for mothers. The mother we have, the mother we may be, the mothers of our past and future, and especially the mother WITHIN each of us -- that is the mother to honor and affirm.\n\nPerhaps the most revolutionary, radical thing we can do to honor Mother's Day -- is to OBEY OUR MOTHER! Obey, in the most ancient meaning of the word: to hear deeply. Hear deeply that voice many of us know from our childhood, the one from the most ancient of times -- the voice that says:\n\nClean up your mess! Mind your manners! Don't hit each other!\n\nIn ancient times, domestic work was women's work. And so was decision making, food distribution, calendar keeping, education, ceremony -- all the elements that sustained community and the lives within. Ancient cultures honored domestic work. Worldwide, women still do most of the domestic work, without the power and respect it once had.\n\nFor thousands of years in the western world, domestic work -- the work of community building and sustaining -- has been deemed less significant than the work of war.\n\nTo honor Mother's Day, let us understand that domestic work -- mothers' work -- is so important that it is everyone's work.\n\nClean up your mess! Mind your manners! Don't hit each other!\n\nObey your mother!\n\nWhen the voice of the mother is not heard, the mothers are left to weep. You can hear them weeping now in Iraq, in Israel, in Palestine, Nicaragua, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, in this country, in our own homes and neighborhoods. The voices are not only women's. They are children's and men's voices.\n\nIt was the mother's voice in all of us that Anna Jarvis wanted to affirm when she became the official founder of Mother's Day.\n\nAnna Jarvis's mother, Ann Reeves Jarvis, was a young homemaker in Appalachia who organized \"Mothers' Work Days\" in 1858 to improve sanitation and save lives. At the time, the medical establishment failed -- or refused -- to recognize the role of germs and dirt as the main cause of the terrible diseases that ravaged the land. During the Civil War Ann Reeves Jarvis organized women's brigades to help wounded soldiers on both sides of the conflict. After the war, she took the lead in trying to heal wounds between North and South.\n\nHer daughter, Anna, never forgot the words of her mother: \"I hope and pray that someone, sometime, will found a memorial mother's day. There are many days for men, but none for mothers.\"\n\nAnna Jarvis would be the moving force behind the official designation of a national Mother's Day in 1915, celebrated on the second Sunday of May. Anna Jarvis wrote so many letters promoting Mother's Day that she had to buy the house next door just to store all the papers! She won her cause, but spent the rest of her life fighting the commercialization of that special day that was supposed to honor mothers instead of fueling profits of florists and greeting card companies.\n\nBut before the official Mother's Day, the famed author, pacifist and suffragist Julia Ward Howe campaigned for Mother's Peace Day. The woman who wrote the words to \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" was shocked and enraged by the useless destruction of war, and horrified by the use of her anthem by some to promote war.\n\nIn 1870, Julia Ward Howe appealed to mothers throughout the world to stop the killing of their sons in war. In her Mother's Peace Day Proclamation, Howe wrote:\n\nArise then, women of this day!\n\nArise all women who have hearts,\n\nWhether your baptism be that of water or of tears!\n\nSay firmly:\n\nWe will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies,\n\nOur husbands shall not come to us, reeking with carnage,\n\nFor caresses and applause.\n\nOur sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn\n\nAll that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience.\n\nWe women of one country\n\nWill be too tender of those of another country\n\nTo allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs.\n\nFrom the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up\n\nWith our own. It says, \"DISARM! DISARM!\"\n\nFor several years, Mother's Peace Day was observed in Julia Ward Howe's native Boston and other places, but the events leading to the First World War drowned out voices of the mothers calling for peace.\n\nListen to the voices of the mothers. Obey (hear deeply) the voices of the mothers.\n\nClean up your mess! Mind your manners! Don't hit each other!"
