        "text": "fringe Festival of Independent Dance Artists\n\nSeries J-K\n\nLate Night IV\n\nAt Buddies in Bad Times Theatre\n\nin Toronto on Thursday\n\nWhile this year's fringe Festival of Independent Dance Artists was not a take-your-breath-away experience, almost all the choreographers had a redeeming feature or two, and the self-indulgent factor was practically nil.\n\nThis year, the Americans were the big surprise. In the past, their work has been patchy, but this time they all brought pieces that demanded to be noticed. It was the home crowd that needed a shot of adrenalin, and one hopes that when fFIDA rolls around next year, Toronto choreographers will follow the lead of the away dancesmiths, and sharpen their edges.\n\nHere is a sampling from the most recent round of fFIDA openings.\n\nNew York's Erik Kaiel brought a fascinating duet, which he performed with German dancer Johannes Wieland to a lush and menacing score by ex-pat Canadian composer Kati Agocs. The subject of haiku d'état is the loss of individuality. Two men in business clothes, engaged in their own preoccupations, keep interrupting each other with bursts of violence, forcing themselves to mirror each other, until they finally became joined. It was a piece of contrasts -- strong, muscular choreography punctuated by moments of exquisite stillness -- that offered a thought-provoking metaphor for relationships.\n\nNew York's Wendy Blum Dance Theatre performed Whimsical Bloodhound, a trio for three women -- Blum, Jill Cantaluppi and Kacie Chang -- and a man's jacket. The piece is about relationships with a father. The jacket was worn by each woman at various times, causing a raft of conflicting reactions from the other two. Most compelling was Blum's quirky choreography, particularly her difficult lifts and demanding contortions.\n\nJapan's Kazuyo Hide presented a gorgeous work titled Kizuna (Ties).The piece is built around mizuhiki,or ceremonial paper string, which is attached to each costume and also forms grids on the stage. The key performers are a tortured trio that included Toronto's Graham McKelvie and Naoko Murakoshi, and Japan's Yukiyo Kondo, along with a Greek chorus of young Japanese women dressed as samurais-cum-theatre performers. With a series of collisions between dancers and string, Hide creates a personal memento mori, an antiwar statement, and a lament for lost relationships. The wonderful score included Japanese percussion and a restless selection from Philip Glass.\n\nTorontonian D. A. Hoskins showcased Paris 1994, which is an intriguing mix that consists of composer Gilles Goyette's text soundscape, an erotic duet (Danielle Baskerville and Mike Moore), and a video showing fans at a marathon race. Hoskins was inspired by a quote from Tennessee Williams about time being the furthest distance between two places.\n\nSion Irwin-Childs, also of Toronto, is not everyone's favourite choreographer. For some, he's just too in-the-face, and his Toranoko was no exception. However, his burning intensity can make for compelling dance. In this solo, he is a fierce warrior fighting his way through the chaos of life. There are dangerous falls, leaps and lunges, but all is held together by his awesome muscular control.\n\nKudos should also go to several young choreographers. Louis Laberge-Coté created a haunting work for Ariane Véga, to Gorecki's lamenting score. In . . . ex audi vocem meam, the dancer convulses on the floor in broken despair. Matthew Kwasnicki's clever solo Too Much of a Good Thing examines taking something to an extreme -- in this case, the endless possibilities of a simple movement. Caroline Niklas-Gordon's Can You See Me Outside Your Window is an intriguing duet for the choreographer and Lucy Rupert. The latter depicts a character stifled by malaise, while Niklas-Gordon represents the memory of happier times. Nicola Pantin's 2:30 a.m. had presented outside of fFIDA before, but her bag lady trio was still amusing.\n\nOriginally from Azerbaijan, Toronto-based Sashar Zarif is now attempting to bring his ethnic dance into the mainstream. Azeri Mirror Garden, in collaboration with designer Afsaneh Shafai, was a bold step in that direction. The piece attempts to depict the real women concealed beneath the veil. Shafai created towering dolls clothed in the shapeless burkas, with only a fraction of their faces visible. Always present was the monolithic, black-robed Pegah Zarrinmehr, reminding us of the anonymous public face demanded of women in some Moslem countries. While Zarif has good ideas, he needs to work on structure, particularly clean endings, and neat passages between segments.\n\nOnce one got over the shock of Donna Bartkiw's cultural appropriation in Spectrum, the piece took on a whimsical quality. To a never-ending parade of ethnic music, the Toronto dancer performs her own recreations of actual national dances, including African, Latino, Indian, Arabian and Russian. Even though it borders on political incorrectness, it is still rather endearing to watch this Canadian girl mimicking the gestures and facial expressions of these other cultures, to varying degrees of success.\n\nRoula Said is of Palestinian background, and her beautiful, large group ritual Toward the Light is a feminine plea for peace. Wearing Greek tunics, the women walk a silk pathway in stately grace, arms outstretched, while other dancers roll beneath the silk, being born at the other end. As lovely as this piece is, it feels incomplete, and needs more choreography for closure.\n\nUnfortunately, Gabby Kamino was simply outclassed by other fFIDA fare. Chris Cawthray did the music for the froufrou Music for Dancing, a harmless improvised work of grooving to a pop song, but her large group piece Japan, also to a Cawthray score, is a shambles of confused, impenetrable images and amateur dancing.\n\nMontreal's Katie Ward, working with artist Dagmara Stephan, produced the duet Balancing Balls, which features improvisation with props, namely a long, flexible tube with rubber balls at each end. Unfortunately, this work, performed in silence except for the sound of the balls, overstays its welcome as the women run out of invention. The fFIDA continues through tomorrow.
