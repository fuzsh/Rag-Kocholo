        "text": "Shinburyo was a facility located within the Imperial Japanese Army's 6th Air Force Headquarters in what is now Chuo Ward, Fukuoka City, Fukuoka Prefecture, and was said to have housed surviving kamikaze pilots until their next sortie. . It was established by requisitioning the dormitory of Fukuoka Girls' High School (currently Fukuoka Jogakuin Junior and Senior High School), which was located across the road from Fukuoka Girls' High School (currently Fukuoka Prefectural Fukuoka Chuo High School), where the military headquarters was located. After the war, the Fukuoka City Kyuden Memorial Gymnasium was built at the location, but it closed on March 31, 2019. It was managed by several air staff members from the headquarters of the 6th Air Force (commander was Lieutenant General Michihiro Sugawara), one of whom is said to be Major Kiyotada Kurasawa. Although it remained unknown for a long time after the war, its existence was revealed after the movie “Summer of Moonlight'' was shown in 1993.\n\nThere are also kamikaze members who went out as kamikaze members of the Shinbutai (the name of the special attack unit under the command of the 6th Air Force located in western Japan), but for some reason returned to their base without being able to attack, It is said to be a facility where special attack pilots who were unable to deploy for various reasons were kept until their next deployment. There are various factors, including external factors such as bad weather, engine trouble, equipment trouble, and attacks by enemy aircraft, as well as psychological fear of death and the fact that soldiers turn back because they expect a certain outcome and feel sorry for the death of a dog. There were even internal factors such as . . .. In particular, during Operation Tengo during the Battle of Okinawa, when the crew members who went on a kamikaze sortie did not attack and returned home, some of them were labeled as ``cowards who feared death'' or ``intentionally boarded the aircraft.'' They were accused of returning home with damaged equipment, and are said to have been subjected to discriminatory treatment.\n\nFurthermore, the existence of similar facilities in the Imperial Navy Air Corps is not known. However, in the Imperial Army Air Corps, on November 7, 1944, which was the first sortie of the Army's air special attack unit, five modified special attack aircraft (and model number) of the Type 4 heavy bomber “Hiryu” of the “Futake Corps” were deployed. Four of the aircraft failed to engage the enemy and returned home, and the remaining four aircraft sortied the next day and all returned. Some of them were unable to engage the enemy from the very beginning of the kamikaze attack, and due to weather problems, a large percentage of the kamikaze aircraft returned. Recognizing this, for example, it was also used in the textbook “Togo Air Duty Essentials”, which was compiled by the Shimoshizu Flying Unit in May 1945 for the education of kamikaze pilots before the Battle of Okinawa. It was assumed that the kamikaze aircraft would return for unavoidable reasons, such as the specific procedures and guidelines for the return of kamikaze pilots. In addition, articles such as the Asahi Shimbun have also covered the returnees due to equipment failure, and there were no restrictions on reporting or concealment from the public.\n\nAccording to the “Shinbutai Formation Table” prepared by the 6th Air Force, which was kept by Major Kurasawa, 605 of the 1,276 suicide bombers listed remained on standby or returned after sortieing. Of these, 9 in 21 Shinbutai, 5 in 22 Shinbutai, 6 in 30 Shinbutai, 4 in 38 Shinbutai, 7 in 65 Shinbutai, 5 in 67 Shinbutai, 2 in 76 Shinbutai, In the notes section of a total of 40 members, 1 in the 111th Shinbutai and 1 in the 112nd Shinbutai, there are entries that appear to be handwritten by General Staff Kurasawa “in Fukuoka” (however, there are entries about the Second Army Hospital in Fukuoka, etc.) It is said that this means that they were sent to the 6th Air Force headquarters, but Shinbu-ryo only existed for about a month and a half from May to June 1945, and the special attack personnel who were housed there were There were approximately 50 to 80 people [9] to 80 people, accounting for around 10% of the returned crew members.[10] The official records of the Imperial Army contain no mention of Shinbu-ryo.\n\nThere is no mention of this in the diary written by Lieutenant General Sugawara, commander of the 6th Air Force. It doesn't exist. The kamikaze soldiers were hidden in a room called the “sewing room” and “Omorikan”, an inn in front of Hakata Station that was used as a military inn for the kamikaze members who were on standby, but it was full, so they simply used the Fukuoka Jogakuin dormitory that had been taken over by the 6th Air Force, and were not forced to house them.” No. Major Hiroshi Kawamoto, who was on the staff of the 6th Air Force (and became the last mayor of Taniyama City, Kagoshima Prefecture after the war), also testified that there was a place in Fukuoka where kamikaze pilots with physical and mental disabilities could be given a “rest”. The leaders of the 6th Air Force either testified that they were not aware of the existence of “Shinburyo”' or denied it. On the other hand, some of the details have been revealed through the testimonies of the Kamikaze pilots who were detained.\n\nHowever, the name “Shinburyo” refers to the air service quarters at Hofu Air Base in Hofu City, Yamaguchi Prefecture (located near Mitajiri Station). It was revealed in the will written by Second Lieutenant Sai Hamada of the 179th Shinbutai to his parents that the 179th Shinbutai 2nd Lieutenant Sai Hamada had also called them “Shinbudyo”. It has been pointed out that “Shinbutai” was simply a general term for the dormitory where members of the “Shinbutai” stayed, and Kurasawa also said, “Since all Okinawa kamikaze troopers are Shinbutai, they (the kamikaze members) can do whatever they like. I think it was called Shinbu-ryo.”\n\nIncidentally, there are scattered cases in various places where the military gave their own names to private inns such as “Kokuryo”, “Hakkoso”, and “Hiryoso” when renting private inns to accommodate aviation personnel. The name is not a special case. Reasons such as loss of aircraft (Personnel and equipment are supplied from the formation unit to the frontline units in the form of increased allocation, so it is difficult for junior officers and non-commissioned officers who lose the aircraft to procure replacement equipment on their own) The reason why the returning members headed to Fukuoka, where the headquarters was located, was that the Shinbutai units were under the direct control of the 6th Air Force headquarters (in terms of operational organization, they were directed to local flying units such as the 6th Squadron). It is necessary to look at this point from an unbiased perspective, as it is completely natural if it is considered as a quarters for airborne personnel attached to the Air Force.\n\nBlue Bottle Coffee has opened their first outlet in Kyushu to great fanfare. On a pre-open event, the beautiful \"influencers\" were brought in to do their magic. A following day, the cafe was packed and a long line of customers snaked out the front door like poop out of a guppy's ass.\n\nSo odd, I thought. The hype.\n\nYes, Blue Bottle has good coffee. Not great, but good enough. That's really all a legal narcotic needs to be. Good enough. But what it may lack in flavor, it more than makes up for in shop design and location. I've been to half a dozen BBs from San Francisco to Tokyo to Kyoto and all of them are gorgeous. The ones in Kyoto, in particular, are worth visiting.\n\nThe shop in an old house in the Higashiyama District is my favorite. The first time I went, I just gawked and gawked. How on earth did a little coffee chain from Oakland go from having about three outlets to so many in Japan, I wondered.\n\nI gnawed on this mystery like a chunk of old beef jerky for a while. Was this just another start-up gone bonkers thanks to venture capitalists throwing money at it? I've seen that kind of thing a lot. Go to a supermarket and you'll find a new brand of, say, potato chips you've never heard of before and behind it is a get-rich-quick scheme of sorts. But Blue Bottle seemed different. Something or someone had to be behind it.\n\nWell, I spat that hunk of beef jerky out and snooped around the Internet until I found the answer: Nestle. In 2015, Fidelity Investments poured $70 million clams into the company. That same year, they opened their first outlet in Japan. It was sold as a case of gyaku-yunyu (reverse importing) as Blue Bottle was bringing back the hand-poured and siphon coffee making techniques that were inspired by traditional coffee shops in Japan.\n\nThen in 2017, Nestle bought a majority stake (about 70%) in the coffee chain and then started opening up outlets in other Asian countries. And now things don't seem so mysterious to me anymore. All those gorgeous influencers and sheeple were lining up for Nescafe.\n\nAt least the shop designs are cool.\n\nIn the wee hours one morning in November, I was woken by the sound of a police car siren. Living downtown, disturbances in the middle of the night are not uncommon, but this night was different. The police car sounded as if it driving slowly up and down the streets around my building, siren blaring on and off.\n\nUnable to sleep, I got out of bed to see what the commotion was all about.\n\nI stepped out onto the balcony and looked down at the street below, but couldn't find anything amiss. But then came wail of the siren again. This time from the west and only a block away. I went to the living room and looked out the window in the direction the sound had come, but was still unable to see anything.\n\nWhat on earth was going on? I wondered. The siren had sounded so close.\n\nAh, there it was again. This time, I hurried out the front door to get a better look. The siren was growing louder.\n\nStanding on the stairwell and looking down the narrow road that passed the rear of my building, I discovered a young man on a bicycle. He was riding one of those electric bikes with the fat tires that look more like off-road motorcycles than your typical mamachari. He headed down the road in my direction. A patrol car, its lights flashing, came around the corner in leisurely pursuit.\n\nJudging by the way the bicycle was weaving, the rider was slightly drunk. When he turned onto a wider road, the patrol car pulled up even with the cyclist.\n\n\"Please stop!\" the police officer called politely over the PA system.\n\nThe patrol car then pulled ahead, attempting to cut the cyclist’s off.\n\n\"Please stop!\"\n\nDid the guy on the bike stop?\n\nNope, he just pedaled around the front of the police car, then turned down a narrow alley and continued on his merry way. With its lights flashing, the patrol car sped down the road and was about to turn off onto a side road but ended up getting blocked by a taxi.\n\nI have no idea what happened after that, but judging by the silence, the drunk cyclist probably managed to slip away.\n\nI couldn’t help but chuckle.\n\nAs long as I have lived here—thirty years and counting—the Japanese have been wringing their hands and fretting about the alarming trends the see on daytime wide shows and in the evening news. Perhaps it’s just part of the national character. But, you know, from my perspective, things are pretty darn good here.\n\nDespite how people may feel about crime, the police’s own statistics paint a very different picture: “the total number of known cases of penal code offenses has decreased consistently since 2003. In 2021, the number was 568,104, the lowest since the end of the Second World War . . . In 2021, the rate of decrease was 7.5% over the previous year, which was lower than the level in 2020 when COVID-19 broke out.” (National Police Agency: “Crime Situation in 2021”)\n\nDid the pandemic influence those numbers? Probably, but crime had already been on the decline since peaking in 2002. It was in the years leading up to 2002 that the “Dankai Juniors”, the cohort of Japanese born in the seventies were in their twenties and unemployment was over 5% — the Employment Ice Age (Shūshoku Hyōgaki), as it was known.\n\nAs for violent crime, why it’s so rare here that when it does on occasion happen, the more shocking cases tend to get ruminated on in nation's news shows for days if not weeks. On that sleepless morning back in November, America recorded its 500th mass shooting of the year. By comparison, there was only one shooting death in Japan in 2021. Murders, and violent crime in general, have fallen steadily since the sixties. There were 213 murders that same year, compared to over 21,000 in America. I know, apples and oranges. Then, consider England and Wales which has a population about half that of Japan’s and fairly strict gun laws. In the 2022/23 reporting year, 602 homicides were recorded, down from 697 in the previous year.\n\nYou don’t see homeless people camped out on the streets like I did all over California last spring. LA alone has some 50,000 people sleeping rough and over half a million (582,000) nationwide. In the UK, there are 365,000 homeless; in Germany, 263,000; and in Canada, 235,000. Among Japan’s neighbors, China has over 2.5 million homeless; Korea, over 11,000. In Japan, there are only 3,065, down 11.1% from last year. My adopted home of Fukuoka prefecture has just over 213 homeless, but you’d be hard pressed to actually spot any of them.\n\nAlthough marijuana use among university “American football” players has been a hot topic in the news since last summer, the fact remains that drugs haven’t really been a serious problem in Japan since the end of WWII. There were, for instance, only a handful of arrests (3) in the most recent data related to heroin. Compare that to the opioid crisis in the US which has claimed over 645,000 lives due to overdoses and, well, there just is no comparison.\n\nAnd because it’s so safe, stores in Japan needn’t worry about getting cleaned out by shoplifters or opportunistic rioters like they do in the US and last September in France. Cars rarely get stolen. (Bicycles, do, but if you report it to the police, they might find it in a few months just like they found my son’s bike, god bless ‘em.) Homes seldom get broken into. But, when they do, the culprits are usually found, occasionally perp-walked on national TV, then prosecuted and punished fairly swiftly.\n\nNo, Japan has the kinds of problems other nations wish they had.\n\nStepping back into my apartment, I discovered my wife at the genkan.\n\nWhat happened, she asked sleepily. When I told her about the drunk cyclist playing cat and mouse with a patrol car, she laughed and said, “Nihon wa heiwa desu ne.” Japan’s a peaceful country, isn’t it.\n\n“Ain’ it?”\n\nAnd with that, I went back to bed and fell fast asleep.\n\nBeen dying for some northern African food, such as couscous, and have been meaning to make it myself if only I could find an easy recipe and ingredients. Well, yesterday, my wife came back from the supermarket with this retort set.\n\nStarving, I threw it together, added extra cumin and black pepper and dug in.\n\nFor a retort-packed meal it was alright. Better than nothing and good inspiration to finally get off me arse and make the real thing.\n\nSix hours later, though, I started feeling funny in my tummy. A small burp came up—cumin, chicken, and chickpeas.\n\nUh oh.\n\nMore burps.\n\nThis ain’t good.\n\nThen my stomach started to hurt. Not too bad, but constant. I took some bioferomin, drank some water and went to bed to try and sleep it off.\n\nThing is I couldn’t sleep.\n\nThe box said the food had been made in Tunisia, packed in Japan. Tunisia. It was one of the few countries that managed to escape the instability and violence of the Arab Spring, if memory served me correctly. But it now felt like there was a coup d’état going on in my stomach.\n\nAfter several hours tossing and turning, I got up, sat on the toilet and contemplated options. If I lie down I’ll probably chuck Tunisia up, her peace-loving citizens and all.\n\nI got some yogurt, ate that, then sat down on the sofa and tried to keep my mind off of things.\n\nWhen my wife found me, she asked what was the wrong. The cous cous, I said.\n\n\"Are you going to vomit?\"\n\nDon’t say that word!\n\n\"The other day when we had Chinese, I felt sick, too. I made myself throw it all up and . . .\"\n\nStop talking!\n\n\"Just stick your finger in your throat and tickle . . .\"\n\nWOMAN!!! Leave me alone!\n\n\"Suit yourself.\"\n\nI managed to fall asleep on the sofa, but woke up in a cold sweat an hour later. Sat on the toilet again, ruminating. I should have vomited Tunisia up hours ago. If I had listened to my wife, I’d be out of the woods by now, sound asleep in bed. Too late now, though: internecine skirmishes were already moving south\n\nDon't know about you, but I can count the number of times I have vomited in my life: six. I just don’t spew cookies like others do. Even after eating Tunisian food that had gone bad.\n\nAnd so, I went back to the sofa and fell asleep. Three hours later I woke up feeling fine. The struggle was over. Peace had been restored. But I vowed: NEVER again would I eat a retort meal from a northern African nation.\n\nA few months ago, I took the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaire and discovered, much to my surprise, that I had the same personality type as, among others, Maggie Thatcher and JP Morgan. If the results of the assessment test were to be believed, then the Iron Lady and business mogul and I were ENTJs (where ENTJ stands for extraversion, intuition, thinking, judgment). ENTJs are action-oriented extroverts who make decisions according to intuition and logic rather than feeling.\n\nI didn't give the assessment much thought after that until I came across this graphic on The Washington Post's Wonkblog. I promptly retook the test, and, confirming the previous result, threw my hands up in triumph.\n\n\"I guess, I'm not hopeless after all.\"\n\nENTJs, I would go on to learn, belong to the subgroup known as the \"Rationalist Temperament\". Rationalists, according to the Keirsey Temperament sorter, \"are the problem solving temperament . . . Rationals might tackle problems in organic systems such as plants and animals, or in mechanical systems such as railroads and computers, or in social systems such as families and companies and governments. But whatever systems fire their curiosity, Rationals will analyze them to understand how they work, so they can figure out how to make them work better.\" If you like, you can read more about the personality type here and here.\n\nThe ENTJ variety of Rationalist, also known as the Fieldmarshal Role Variant, is rare: only 2% of the population is said to have this personality type. Isabel Briggs Myers, co-creator of a personality inventory named after her, called ENTJs \"leaders of leaders\". Other ENTJs include Napoleon Bonaparte, Julius Caesar, George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, Douglas MacArthur, and Hillary Clinton. Interesting company to be in, to say the least.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post graph which shows average household earning for each personality type, ENTJs earn much more than the other sixteen personality types.\n\nThis got me thinking about a lot of things. For one, I wondered if I was living up to my earning potential, and, if not, who I might be able to screw over. Perhaps a coup d'etat is in order?\n\nOn a more serious note, though, having a better understanding what my personality type is has gone a long way in helping me explain why I am the way I am--why, for instance, I am not comfortable in subordinate roles, why I am constantly making lists of To Dos not just for myself, but for those around me (much to the chagrin of my poor wife); why, when helping with, say, an event, I get easily irritated when things are run in a half-arsed manner and am quick take over; why I am obsessed with order and a systematic way of executing tasks; and why I'm am constantly trying to find practical solutions to problems, not only in my life, but in the workplace, neighborhood, city, nation, and world. It may also help explain my penchant for war and mafia movies, the colors khaki and olive drab, and the choice of a confirmation name, based initially not on a saint, but rather an emperor. (Sorry, God.) I am Napoleon I on the island of Elba, scheming for a way off.\n\nI suspect that my father also had the same personality type, or one similar. He was much more of an extrovert than myself, though.\n\nAfter cocktails and hors d’oeuvres, a fifty-something-year-old American man, someone I have never seen around town, taps on a microphone a few times then jumps right into his presentation.\n\nFrom the get-go, it stinks of some multilevel marketing scheme and, looking around the room, I can see that it’s the same old crew that has come together to push it: guys who were doing Amway, then NuSkin, then Noni. And now they’re gung-ho about something called Rexall Showcase: a new name to the old scheme of pushing overpriced supplements and dubious weight loss products on family and friends and kicking the profits up the pyramid.\n\n“This is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for, folks!” the speaker exclaims. “This is The Golden Opportunity! The chance to get into a business when it’s just getting off the ground. Amway, NuSkin, yes, they’re all good business models, excellent business models, in fact, but if you really want to make money with them, why, you should have gotten into the business twenty, thirty years ago. Folks, I’m tellin’ ya, Rexall Showcase is the opportunity you’ve all been dreaming about!”\n\nAs I listen to him, I must admit that what he is saying doesn’t completely lack merit. Imagine being able to have entered into a business like Amway when it was first taking off, before overeager fools irretrievably ruined its reputation. But today? Try to become a millionaire in Amway today and you’ll probably die trying. Your hair and skin will look fantastic, though. You might even feel fantastic, too, if you can manage to swallow their horse-pill sized megavitamins.\n\nThe American tells us he has been living in Japan for over thirty years, longer than anyone else in the room. “I’ve been here since Nixon was president!”\n\nLaughter.\n\n“And all these years, I have been running a business. Several businesses, in fact!”\n\nHe’s quite successful, he assures us, saying that he even supplies Fukuoka Airport with his products.\n\nThere are oohs and ahs.\n\n“And, let me tell ya, folks, I know a good opportunity when it comes up from behind me and kicks me in the ass.”\n\nMore laughter.\n\nThe American talks like a snake oil salesman, but the others in the room eat it up; so eager they are to get their grubby little hands on cold hard cash that what he is saying must sound like the sweetest of music to their ears.\n\nAnd then, he invites a long-haired douchebag by the name of Clive up to the front and says, “Clive has been blowing us away . . . Tell me again, how much did you earn last month?”\n\n“Two million yen.”\n\nThere are whistles of astonishment and why wouldn’t there be? Two million yen for a month’s worth of work is a respectable amount of cash, twice what I am making, working what amounts to three jobs. But, why is this “very successful” guy dressed like someone who is only earning a tenth that amount? The Canadian, a former strip dancer at a “ladies’ club” that went bust years ago, is wearing ripped Levis, old cowboy boots, and a dowdy sports jacket. Any moment now I expect him to tear the jeans off and start jiggling his nuts.\n\n“See, I told you it was fishy,” Akané whispers into my ear.\n\n“Fishy doesn’t even begin to describe it. This is borderline fraud what they’re doing. Let’s get out of here.”\n\nMom's Memories of Summer:\n\nWhen your grandfather worked for Locket, he had a week off every summer in mid-August. A week or so before the trip, my parents would take everything out of storage, open it all up and air it out. They’d put a big mattress in the back of the truck, which had 2’ high walls, and drive up to Sequoia National Forest or even as far as Yosemite. The year Margaret was born (‘37), we went to Big Bear Lake.\n\nThe drive north was always an adventure because I-5 hadn’t been built yet. Going up the steep and winding road over the Grapevine was hard on the cars which would vapor lock and stall.\n\nOnce at the campsite, we would back the truck in, and tie up some sheets for privacy. Mom and Dad slept on the mattress. We also had a canvas-like teepee with cots that we kids—your uncle Jim and I—would sleep on. In later years, Winford, who was 13 years older than me, lived by himself, attending Fullerton Junior College, so he couldn’t come with us. He would end up working for North American Aviation until the war started.\n\nAt the campsite, they hung glass lamps on the trees for lighting. I remember the lamps came from China.\n\nIn the morning, Dad would make a fire and brew a pot of coffee. Mom would cook baked beans and fry up some bacon which always smelled so good. Eggs would then be deep fried in bacon fat. It tasted great but couldn’t have been too easy on our arteries.\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor was attacked and America entered the war, gas was rationed. To get it, you had to drive all the way to Orange which was five miles away. Still, Dad was able to get a bit more gas than most people because he worked on a farm. He’d save up the ration tickets to have enough gas for our summer trip. In 1942, we didn’t have enough gas to get all the way up into the mountains and ended up staying in the King’s River area in King’s Canyon."
