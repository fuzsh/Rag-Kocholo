        "text": "This article focuses on the life and ideas of Kuwabara Takeo, a cultural critic and scholar of French literature who became renowned for his 1946 critique of haiku as a “secondary art” in comparison with the novel. By reconstructing Kuwabara's intellectual trajectory from the mid-1930s to the mid-1940s, I show how this famous essay was in part an effort to respond to Karl Löwith's famous critique of Japanese intellectuals. Löwith argued that Japanese intellectuals were insufficiently critical towards their own culture, due to the way that they compartmentalized practices and ideas associated with either Japanese culture or Western civilization. Kuwabara resisted such tendencies through the practice of cross-cultural comparison. His work gained encouragement from and responded to Löwith's critique in a way that illuminates the role that comparisons played in the intellectual culture of mid-twentieth-century Japan.\n\n2 The novelist Mori Ōgai often appeared in Löwith's writings on Japan as a patriotic foil for his criticism. Yet writing by another novelist, Natsume Sōseki, forms a better precedent for Löwith's critical approach to Japanese culture. Sōseki's 1914 lecture “My Individualism” could be read as a self-reflective effort to grapple with what Löwith later identified as the “two-story-house” problem. Given the chronological framing of this article around the mid-twentieth century, it is worth noting that Sōseki's writings on individualism were rediscovered by Shimizu Ikutarō in the mid-1930s, not long before Löwith's arrival in Japan. Rubin, Jay, “Sōseki on Individualism: ‘Watakushi no Kojinshugi’,” Monumenta Nipponica 34/1 (1979), 21–48CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n11 The work of Benedict Anderson is a common reference point for much of the literature on comparison written by historians. For an elaboration of his approach see Sluga, Glenda, “The Nation and the Comparative Imagination,” in Cohen, Deborah and O'Connor, Maura, eds., Comparison and History: Europe in Cross-national Perspective, (Abington, 2004), 103–14Google Scholar. A wealth of critical perspectives on Anderson's approach to comparison and the nation-state can be found in Cheah, Pheng and Culler, Jonathan, eds., Grounds of Comparison: Around the Work of Benedict Anderson (Abingdon, 2013)CrossRefGoogle Scholar. An important demonstration of an approach to the history of comparisons that avoids the trap of nationalist teleology is Karl, Rebecca, Staging the World: Chinese Nationalism at the Turn of the Twentieth Century (Durham, NC, 2002)Google Scholar.\n\n22 Jacques Rancière's conceptualization of the relationship between literature and politics bears some resemblance to Kuwabara's positing of a close relationship between literary autonomy and realism. The presumed autonomy of literature as a “definite practice of writing” is what enables it to engage in a particular form of politics concerned with the “partition of the visible and the sayable, in this intertwining of being, doing and saying that frames a polemical common world.” Rancière, Jacques, “The Politics of Literature,” SubStance 33/1 (2004), 10–24CrossRefGoogle Scholar, at 10.\n\n25 In its frequent comparisons between Greece and Japan, Watsuji's travelogue Koji junrei (1919) serves as a representative work for this genre of art criticism, which he continued to explore in a chapter of his well-known Fūdo (1935). Koji junrei was translated by Hiroshi Nara as Pilgrimages to Ancient Temples in Nara: Koji junrei (Portland, 2013). Fūdo was translated by Bownas, Geoffery as A Climate: A Philosophical Study (Tokyo, 1961)Google Scholar. On Kobayashi's forays into Japanese tradition see Dorsey, James, Critical Aesthetics: Kobayashi Hideo, Modernity, and Wartime Japan (Cambridge, 2009), 159–95CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n72 Itō believed that this guild-like arrangement had positive aspects as well. For example, the bundan establishment was conducive to the emergence of a tight-knit community that could convey advice and criticism to writers that would be difficult to communicate in a more impersonal public forum. Itō, Sei, Itō Sei zenshū, vol. 13 (Tokyo, 1973), 388–90Google Scholar."
