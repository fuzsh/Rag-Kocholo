The old word war is festering, inflaming evil to start a try, therefore, I whet the edge and swing wide\n\nDJ Thomas Dec 2010\n\nBride of the desert\n\nthe indomitable town\n\nSolomon’s Kingdom\n\nLost in history, I wander through a city that was fortified by King Solomon, raided by Mark Antony and ruled by Queen Zenobia who made it the capital of an empire, only to be captured herself and paraded through Rome in gold chains.\n\nCivilisation upon civilisation are entombed within Tadmur; in a huge plain of carved stone blocks, massive columns arched in rows or standing alone, a Romanesque theatre, senate and baths, dominated by a great temple whose origin dates back four thousand years.\n\nDue to a clever mistranslation from Arabic by the euro-centric traveller who ‘discovered’ Palmyra, the city also has a modern name.\n\nHere for millennia, a tribe of Bedu have camped within the folds of these desert steppes and blackened Tadmur’s ruins with their camp fires, to trade camels or herd goats and sheep. Walking the divide between city, desert and the more fertile steppes, I search for their surviving descendants and find a black woven goat’s hair tent with its edges raised to capture a cooling breeze.\n\nHamed and his sons, huge and wary of foreigners, welcome me to sit within on carpets and then graciously serve dates with innumerable small glasses of tea. I indicate ‘enough’ in the traditional manner by rolling my right hand and the empty glass. Hamed continues to voice his concerns about the lack of feed for their sheep and the prices achieved at market. I readily succumb to several small cups of greenish Arabic coffee, before being allowed to take my leave.\n\nFor millennia the wealth of this city was based on tariffs levied on goods flowing out of the desert aboard swaying camel caravans. Today, these once proudly fierce tribal Bedu no longer breed, train or ride camels.\n\nThe Bedu greatly prize their reputation and the respect of their peers. Their traditions are the foundation of these small tribal communities and may predate Islam; a life now undermined by borders, nationalism, government settlement plans, conscription, war, television and tourism.\n\n*+ + + + +\n\nBlack torn empty shells\n\nswept by Mount Lebanon’s shade\n\nCannabis Valley\n\nAs I recall a haiku of ‘images’ of my very first journey to Damascus, from war-torn Beirut through the lushness of the Bekaa;\n\nin the here and now\n\na dark suit and Mercedes\n\ncross the Euphrates\n\nDefence Minister, Rifaat al-Assad is in town with his fifty thousand strong Defence Companies, complete with tanks, planes and helicopters. A coup d’état is in progress to assure Rifaat’s succession to the Presidency of his older brother Hafiz al-Assad, now recovering from a heart attack.\n\nLast year, Rifaat massacred some forty thousand Syrian citizens when he ordered the shelling of the city of Hama. Nobody in Damascus will be underestimating him.\n\nAll political and military power is in the hands of the al-Assads and key generals, who command the military and police. The majority of whom are of the Alawite minority Muslim faith from the rural districts near Latakia in the North. Before their revolution, governments came and went in weeks.\n\nMy friend Elias is allied to Rifaat’s cause, by simply doing business with the son. Now he and his family share the risks and dangers of this coup failing and stand to lose a fortune. Monies paid locally in Syrian pounds for goods delivered to government agencies.\n\nElias’s connection with Rifaat and Latakia, as well as his confident presence, humour and love of life, still allows us easy access to the Generals’ Club. Sadly, there is to be no table and floorshow, but a closed meeting with two senior Generals, where we learn that Hafiz has recovered enough to take charge and is now locked in discussions with his younger brother.\n\nThe decision is therefore made for us. We say our goodbyes and drive to Latakia.\n\nOn Sunday Elias meets his brothers, then with his family, we visit his parents small holding and enjoy a meal together. A wonderful fresh mezza that includes my favourite, courgettes stuffed with ground lamb and rice, in a yogurt sauce. Syrian food is amazingly healthy and my cuisine of choice.\n\nIt is a cloudless Monday morning, as I, Elias, his wife and children drive into the docks to board an old 46 foot motor cruiser. Huge cases are stowed as I make my inspection, then start the twin diesels and switch on the over-the-horizon radar. Our early departure is critical. We cast off and the Mate steers for the harbour entrance below the cliffs that guard it. As the Mediterranean lifts our bow in greeting, the disembodied voice of the Harbour Master tells us to return as we do not have permission to sail.\n\nIgnoring the order, I increase our speed through the short choppy surf. We are sailing under the Greek Cypriot flag and in an hour I hope to be out of territorial waters. At 14 knots we are a slow target.\n\nFifteen nautical miles from the coast of Syria, I leave the mate to follow a bearing for Larnaca. Elias has opened a bottle of Black Label. I quaff a glassful.\n\nLater noticing a noisy vibration and diagnosing a bent prop shaft, I shut down the starboard engine. Our speed is now a steady 8 knots, so I decide on a new heading to discern more quickly the shadow of the Cypriot coastline on the radar screen.\n\nMidway, the mate and Elias begin babbling about a small vessel ahead and four separate armoured boxes encircling it. Ugly Israeli high speed gun boats or worse, Lebanese pirates. Should they board us and find stowed riches, we will be killed.\n\nLeaving the Mate to maintain our course, I go on deck to play the ‘European Owner’. The vessel they have trapped is long and lean with three tall outboard motors but no crew are in sight. Leaving them astern, our choice of vessel now fully exonerated, I and Elias throw another whisky ‘down the hatch’.\n\nWith us holding the correct bearing, I ask Elias to wake me as soon as we near Cyprus. Feeling utterly exhausted I collapse into a bunk.\n\nI wake unbidden, to find the Mate steering for the harbour entrance. Shouldering him aside, I spin the wheel to bring the vessel about. Shaking, I ask them why there are minarets on the ‘church’ and did they not notice our being observed from the top of the harbour's hillock, below which a fast patrol boat is anchored? The Mate sprints to the Greek Cypriot flag and is hugging it to his chest; Elias wisely prays.\n\nI command the wheel as we motor directly away from the port of Famagusta and Turkish held Northern Cyprus. We later change bearing and pass tourist beaches, it is night fall before we moor-up in Larnaca.\n\n+ + + + +\n\nLater that same year I am called to a last urgent meeting in Cyprus with Elias. He calmly tells me that he will be arrested when he rejoins his family, who have returned to Syria. Elias asks me to take full control of his Cypriot Businesses, then returns home and ‘disappears’ with his brothers.\n\n+ + + + +\n\nSince sacking the two Arab General Managers when they tried to get control of the bank accounts, it has taken more than six months to locate the prison holding all the brothers.

but I shall never see\n\nThe blossom on the blackthorn, the leaf upon the tree.\n\nLast May we made a crown of flowers; we had a merry day,—\n\nBeneath the hawthorn on the green they made me Queen of May;\n\nAnd we danced about the May-pole and in the hazel copse,\n\nTill Charles's Wain came out above the tall white chimney-tops.\n\nThere's not a flower on all the hills,—the frost is on the pane;\n\nI only wish to live till the snowdrops come again.\n\nI wish wish the snow would melt and the sun come out on high,—\n\nI long to see a flower so before the day I die.\n\nThe building-rook'll caw from the windy tall elm-tree,\n\nAnd the tufted plover pipe along the fallow lea,\n\nAnd the swallow'll come back again with summer o'er wave,\n\nBut I shall lie alone, mother, within the mouldering grave.\n\nUpon the chancel casement, and upon that grave of mine,\n\nIn the early morning the summer sun'll shine,\n\nBefore the red **** crows from the farm upon the hill,—\n\nWhen you are warm-asleep, mother, and all the world is still.\n\nWhen the flowers come again, mother, beneath the waning light\n\nYou'll never see me more in the long grey fields at night;\n\nWhen from the dry dark wold the summer airs blow cool\n\nOn the oat-grass and the sword-grass, and the bullrush in the pool.\n\nYou'll bury me, my mother, just beneath the hawthorn shade,\n\nAnd you'll come sometimes and see me where I am lowly laid.\n\nI shall not forget you, mother; I shall hear you when you pass,\n\nWith your feet above my head in the long and pleasant grass.\n\nI have been wild and wayward, but you'll forgive me now;\n\nYou'll kiss me, my own mother, upon my cheek and brow;\n\nNay, nay, you must no weep, nor let your grief be wild;\n\nYou should not fret for me, mother—you have another child.\n\nIf I can, I'll come again, mother, from out my resting-place;\n\nThough you'll not see me, mother, I shall look upon your face;\n\nThough I cannot speak a word, I shall harken what you say,\n\nAnd be often, often with you when you think I'm far away.\n\nGood night! good night! when I have said good night forevermore,\n\nAnd you see me carried out from the threshold of the door,\n\nDon't let Effie come to see me till my grave be growing green,—\n\nShe'll be a better child to you then ever I have been.\n\nShe'll find my garden tools upon the granary floor.\n\nLet her take 'em—they are hers; I shall never garden more.\n\nBut tell her, when I'm gone, to train the rosebush that I set\n\nAbout the parlour window and box of mignonette.\n\nGood night, sweet-mother! Call me before the day is born.\n\nAll night I lie awake, but I fall asleep at morn;\n\nBut I would see the sun rise upon the glad new-year,—\n\nSo, if you're waking, call me, call me early, mother dear.\n\nConclusion.\n\nI thought to pass away before, and yet alive I am;\n\nAnd in the fields all around I hear the bleating of the lamb.\n\nHow sadly, I remember, rose the morning of the year!\n\nTo die before the snowdrop came, and now the violet's here.\n\nO, sweet is the new violet, that comes beneath the skies;\n\nAnd sweeter is the young lamb's voice to me that cannot rise;\n\nAnd sweet is all the land about, and all the flowers that blow;\n\nAnd sweeter far is death than life, to me that long to go.\n\nI seemed so hard at first, mother, to leave the blessed sun,\n\nAnd now it seems as hard to stay; and yet, His will be done!\n\nBut still I think it can't be long before I find release;\n\nAnd that good man, the clergyman, has told me words of peace.\n\nO, blessings on his kindly voice, and on his silver hair,\n\nAnd blessings on his whole life long, until he meet me there!\n\nO, blessings on his kindly heart and on his silver head!\n\nA thousand times I blest him, as he knelt beside my bed.\n\nHe taught me all the mercy for he showed me all the sin;\n\nNow, though my lamp was lighted late, there's One will let me in.\n\nNor would I now be well, mother, again, if that could be;\n\nFor my desire is but to pass to Him that died for me.\n\nI did not hear the dog howl, mother, or the death-watch beat,—\n\nThere came a sweeter token when the night and morning meet;\n\nBut sit beside my bed, mother, and put your hand in mine,\n\nAnd Effie on the other side, and I will tell the sign.\n\nAll in the wild March-morning I heard the angels call,—\n\nIt was when the moon was setting, and the dark was over all;\n\nThe trees began to whisper, and the wind began to roll,\n\nAnd in the wild March-morning I heard them call my soul.\n\nFor, lying broad awake, I thought of you and Effie dear;\n\nI saw you sitting in the house, and I no longer here;\n\nWith all my strength I prayed for both—and so I felt resigned,\n\nAnd up the valley came a swell of music on the wind.\n\nI thought that is was fancy, and I listened in my bed;\n\nAnd then did something speak to me,—I know not what was said;\n\nFor great delight and shuddering took hold of all my mind,\n\nAnd up the valley came again the music on the wind.\n\nBut you were sleeping; and I said, \"It's not for them,—it's mine;\"\n\nAnd if it comes three times, I thought, I take it for a sign.\n\nAnd once again it came, and close beside the window-bars;\n\nThen seemed to go right up to heaven and die among the stars.\n\nSo now I think my time is near; I trust it is. I know\n\nThe blessèd music went that way my soul will have to go.\n\nAnd for myself, indeed, I care not if I go to-day;\n\nBut Effie, you must comfort her when I am past away.\n\nAnd say to Robin a kind word, and tell him not to fret;\n\nThere's many a worthier than I, would make him happy yet.\n\nIf I had lived—I cannot tell—I might have been his wife;\n\nBut all these things have ceased to be, with my desire of life.\n\nO, look! the sun begins to rise! the heavens are in a glow;\n\nHe shines upon a hundred fields, and all of them I know.\n\nAnd there I move no longer now, and there his light may shine,—\n\nWild flowers in the valley for other hands than mine.\n\nO, sweet and strange it seems to me, that ere this day is done\n\nThe voice that now is speaking may be beyond the sun,—\n\nForever and forever with those just souls and true,—\n\nAnd what is life, that we should moan? why make we such ado?\n\nForever and forever, all in a blessèd home,—\n\nAnd there to wait a little while till you and Effie come,—\n\nTo lie within light of God, as I lie upon your breast,—\n\nAnd the wicked cease from troubling, and weary are at rest.\n\n**~By Alfred Lord Tennyson 1809—1892~\n\nKen Pepiton Oct 2018\n\nThis is not where this idea began but it ran and I\n\nmissed my mark.

Same logic, mom. In case you died before the next\n\ntime I saw you, at least that was the last thing I ever said to you I never\n\nwanted you to forget, and yes mom, I still see you as the stiches in my\n\ntorn up nylons but I don’t see you as my blanket on a cold day,\n\nanymore.\n\nI can trust you to save me, I can trust you to love me overall, in the end\n\nBut I can’t trust you to comfort me and you tell me to call you when\n\nI’m sad, but you wouldn’t get it.\n\nI can give you ten reasons why you and I need you to stop chasing me\n\ninto pain’s open arms and all ten are on my hands, balled up in fists\n\nthat are bruised from fighting, I’m done fighting with you mom, I can’t\n\nanymore.\n\nI’m too tired.\n\nYou start every knitting project and never finish it before you start a\n\nnew one, and I don’t want to become just another unfinished project of\n\nyours, the daughter who left home and never sent more than 10 emails,\n\none for each finger after that because it’s not that I don’t love you, it’s\n\njust that we’re growing so distant now that when we fight, the “I love\n\nyou” is no longer implied and when you get angry, you’re scary\n\nYou call me worthless, you swear at me, you say some awful things\n\nmom, and so do I, I know,\n\nBut then you demand in irritation why I consider myself worthless as\n\nif I’m seeking attention or something when I admit to you how\n\nworthless I feel, well if you would quit calling me useless and\n\nworthless and I quote “The stupidest human being alive” maybe I\n\nWOULDN’T FEEL LIKE THAT MOM!\n\nMaybe your mom, who is supposed to be the over-sized, comfy hoodie\n\nyou can come home to when life is getting too complicated is\n\nconstricting you with her harmful words it’s hard to find any good in\n\nmyself anymore maybe I’m just really hurt that you would say that to\n\nme.\n\nMy sisters came along and they STOLE you, I’m sorry if that sounds\n\nlike a selfish, angry six year old but I need to say it because I don’t care\n\nhow unbiased you think you are, you never show me the underlying\n\nkindness you show them because mom, I don’t want money every time\n\nwe go to the movies, I don’t want two pairs of Lululemon leggings or\n\nexpensive boots I just want the Love I feel like you’ve lost for me when\n\nyou didn’t have enough to give to all three of your children I just want\n\nyou to Love me, mom.

shoulders as Dunstan peered over the balcony, it was a long way down from his penthouse suite he guessed, shrinking back from the handrail... at a rough guess somewhere between the upper observation deck, Eiffel-Tower, Paris, France and lower basement mezzanine at Miss Selfridge, London, England... and Dunstan was terrified if heights.\n\nIt scarcely seemed anytime at all really since he'd relocated to his new and upwardly situated des-res, yet for all that he could hardly recall living anywhere else, once you'd seen one, well... you got the idea, after a while they all looked pretty much the same, you just had to be able to haggle, but for now at least he was obviously safe enough where he was, sunning himself on the balcony watching the world go by as he scribbled down a shopping list... but lunchtime was almost upon him and then all hell was sure to break loose.\n\nHaving finally determined to put down roots and raise children of her own, his mother Elvera, finding herself in the family-way had wasted no time at all in tearing several well thumbed pages out of her mother's book, then taken both Dunstan's father and his gene-pool straight to the cleaners, just to keep them, so page three informed her firmly in the family... so Dunstan grew up knowing a great deal about laundry and dry-cleaning, but very little about his father, just the occasional anecdote cast to the wind like so much bird seed, about their early courting days and how they'd both wanted him to grow into a strong, healthy lad and do well at school, climbing the corporate ladder, so-to-speak and go to Boy-Scouts every Tuesday evening just like his father had done before him... and learn all about knots, but Dunstan had vertigo and couldn't tie knots for toffee.\n\nAll hell was certainly dead set on breaking loose that lunchtime, or rather Houdini were they to continue and remain on first name terms... and there was nothing Dunstan loved more than a captive audience. Reflecting deeply and never wanting a repeat of the previous week he studied the hastily bound swaddling, perhaps the odd tweak here and there just to be on the safe side should ensure the safety of his dinner guest for the remainder of the afternoon. As Dunstan snipped the final thread he considered that simply nothing was too much trouble where todays 'entree was concerned, he now sat before Houdini smacking his lips in anticipation, quivering in the front parlour waiting for the dinner gong to sound, the Sunday lunch however, now in a mounting state of frenzied agitation continued bouncing around on the embroidered tablespread.\n\nDunstan could never understand what the fuss was all about... I mean, it wasn't as though his dinner guest hadn't been invited, he argued and that for the umpteenth time, as he reached for the carving knife and steel, he simply wasn't going to take no for an answer, leaving his dinner guest still bouncing about, insisting that he'd merely dropped in for directions... and that he, The Great Houdini, currently billed at The London Hippodrome for the remainder of the season had a far more pressing dinner engagement elsewhere, with a diary for the foreseeable future distinctly at odds with those of his host... leaving Dunstan so he hoped, far behind and in no uncertain doubt that not only had he been left hanging in stickier corners than this one, but had every intention of extracting himself from being principal dish of the day before third curtain call... and having done so, wish Dunstan a very good day and remit his professional fee by return of post.\n\nMeanwhile, insisting that his guest needn't feel obliged to dine elsewhere when they could both enjoy a really splendid one right here, chewing over happier times together, although should Houdini wish, then Dunstan felt confident that his dinner guest was more than capable of punching his way out of as many wet paper bags as he liked... and just what were the Marquis of Queensberry Rules anyway... so encouraged, Dunstan continued sharpening the knife.\n\n\"Well really\", thought Dunstan... 'and without so much as a by-your-leave' carefully examining the damage to his new lace tablecloth, torn in Houdini's haste to depart, he really must be careful as he rummaged for his darning needle, not to fall through. It had been the shortest dinner party in living memory, Dunstan sighed, it simply would not do, what would all his neighbour's think, he'd never hear the last of it, his reputation they would whisper, well... it would all end in ruins, mark their words it would. Dunstan's tummy rumbled, he'd been filled with nothing but anticipation that day and very little else, but other than a torn tablecloth and superfluous items of Houdini, shrugged of in his bid for freedom, no one would be any the wiser... having said that, Dunstan would have to make do with a cold repast for luncheon instead, hanging quite still in the larder.\n\n­ ­ ... ... ...**\n\nA work in progress. ­ 831"
