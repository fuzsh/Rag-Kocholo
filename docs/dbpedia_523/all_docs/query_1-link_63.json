        "text": "Articles At-Large\n\nI'm still reading New Yorkers. Years ago my friend also started sending me The Altantic and like the other magazine, I'm really behind. Here are the poetry related articles I've come across…\n\nThe Last Rock-Star Poet by James Parker (about Dylan Thomas)\n\nThe Poet Laureate of Englishness/A Poet for the Age of Brexit by Adam Kirsch (about A.E. Housman)\n\nThe Odyssey and the Other: What the epic can teach about encounters with strangers abroad and at Home\n\nEncrypted: Translators confront the supreme enigma of Stephane Mallarme’s poetry\n\nTragic Muses: What Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell taught each other about turning pain into art\n\nAnd I’ve been holding on to this gem of an article from Atlas Obscura for years: An Algorithmic Investigation of the Highfalutin “Poet Voice’ by Cara Giaimo. The author ponders the poetry reading and the sound of that wacky performance voice, “a slow, lilting delivery like a very boring ocean.” She opposes this to the similarly stilted NPR voice or Podcast voice.\n\nPoems at Large\n\nMy monthly Birchbox subscription comes with five beauty product samples in a box with a card of instructions on how to use them all (because the bottle brandings are so Spartan and useless). There were poems in two of my recent boxes.\n\nOne box came with a special card inside. The card’s cover says “This is not a beauty box.” Except it totally is. The first inside page goes on to explain the company has learned that the world of beauty “is not simple” because their customers previously felt “overlooked by the entire industry because beauty isn’t their top priority” because they have kids and jobs and such. And then page two goes on to say the usual “you deserve time to take care of you, you, you.” It’s an annoying message because it completely contradicts the message on page one. Then, on the back is a poem called “You: A Poem” about how “This is for You./The best of you…” including all the synonyms of your feelings the marketing companies want you to associate with their product: joy, perfection, power, lovable, kick ass, essentially the “you, you always wanted to be.” The poem states, “You may be out of moisturizer,/but you’re not out of time” and “Because the best of you,/requires a little time, with you.” The poem ends with, “(For once it’s all about you)” (no end period).\n\nThere are some superfluous commas hanging around this poem…and a TON of narcissism, a vice marketing is enabling us with at every corner and intersection. \"Have it YOUR way.\"\n\nWhich makes the reference to “for once” a bit absurd. It’s always about you, that's why the poem has been added to my Birchbox. And that’s why we’re collectively losing our minds and killing each other out here.\n\nOk. Part of this is the Narcissism summit talking. Sounds True hosted a 10-day Understanding Narcissism conference, a 20+ hour conference on all aspects of cultural Narcissism. It was really great.\n\nInside another one of the recent boxes was a perfume sample of Like This (subtitled LEtat d’Orange and Immortal Ginger is also part of the label so I was pretty confused about what the title of the product really was) created by actress Tilda Swinton.\n\nAnyway, the card containing the sample says the perfume was inspired by the poet Rumi with no explanation.\n\nSo I went online and found this page where the description of the perfume elaborates:\n\nEtat Libre d’Orange launches a new fragrance in March 2010, second celebrity perfume in a row, this time inspired by the English actress Tilda Swinton. Her favorite scent is the scent of home, so she wanted a fragrance that will be a magical potion with that kind of smell. Mathilde Bijaoui created for her a composition of yellow tangerine, ginger, pumpkin, immortelle, Moroccan neroli, Grass rose, vetiver, heliotrope and musk.\n\n\"I have always located my favourite fragrances at the doorways of kitchens, in the heart of a greenhouse, at the bottom of a garden. Scent means place to me : place and state of mind – even state of grace. Certainly state of ease. My favourite smells are the smells of home, the experience of the reliable recognisable after the exotic adventure: the regular – natural – turn of the seasons, simplicity and softness after the duck and dive of definition in the wide, wide world.\n\nWhen Mathilde Bijaoui first asked me what my own favourite scent in a bottle might contain, I described a magic potion that I could carry with me wherever I went that would hold for me the fragrance – the spirit – of home. The warm ginger of new baking on a wood table, the immortelle of a fresh spring afternoon, the lazy sunshine of my grandfather's summer greenhouse, woodsmoke and the whisky peat of the Scottish Highlands after rain. I told her about a bottle of spirit, something very simple, to me : something almost indescribable, so personal it should be. The miracle is that Mathilde made it.\n\nThe great Sufi poet Rumi wrote:\n\nIf anyone wants to know what \"spirit\" is,\n\nor what \"God’s fragrance\" means,\n\nlean your head toward him or her.\n\nKeep your face there close.\n\nLike this.\n\nThis is possibly my favourite poem of all time.\n\nIt restores me like the smoke/rain/gingerbread/ greenhouse my scent-sense is fed by. It is a poem about simplicity, about human-scaled miracles. About trust. About home.\n\nIn my fantasy there is a lost chapter of Alice in Wonderland – after the drink saying Drink Me, after the cake pleading Eat Me – where the adventuring, alien, Alice, way down the rabbit hole, far from the familiar and maybe somewhat homesick – comes upon a modest glass with a ginger stem reaching down into a pale golden scent that humbly suggests : Like This…\"\n\nTilda Swinton\n\nHere is the Rumi poem in its entirety:\n\nIf anyone asks you\n\nhow the perfect satisfaction\n\nof all our sexual wanting\n\nwill look, lift your face\n\nand say,\n\nLike this.\n\nWhen someone mentions the gracefulness\n\nof the nightsky, climb up on the roof\n\nand dance and say,\n\nLike this.\n\nIf anyone wants to know what 'spirit' is,\n\nor what 'God’s fragrance' means,\n\nlean your head toward him or her.\n\nKeep your face there close.\n\nLike this.\n\nWhen someone quotes the old poetic image\n\nabout clouds gradually uncovering the moon,\n\nslowly loosen knot by knot the strings\n\nof your robe.\n\nLike this.\n\nIf anyone wonders how Jesus raised the dead,\n\ndon’t try to explain the miracle.\n\nKiss me on the lips.\n\nLike this. Like this.\n\nWhen someone asks what it means\n\nto 'die for love,' point\n\nhere.\n\nIf someone asks how tall I am, frown\n\nand measure with your fingers the space\n\nbetween the creases on your forehead.\n\nThis tall.\n\nThe soul sometimes leaves the body, the returns.\n\nWhen someone doesn’t believe that,\n\nwalk back into my house.\n\nLike this.\n\nWhen lovers moan,\n\nthey’re telling our story.\n\nLike this.\n\nI am a sky where spirits live.\n\nStare into this deepening blue,\n\nwhile the breeze says a secret.\n\nLike this.\n\nWhen someone asks what there is to do,\n\nlight the candle in his hand.\n\nLike this.\n\nHow did Joseph’s scent come to Jacob?\n\nHuuuuu.\n\nHow did Jacob’s sight return?\n\nHuuuu.\n\nA little wind cleans the eyes.\n\nLike this.\n\nWhen Shams comes back from Tabriz,\n\nhe’ll put just his head around the edge\n\nof the door to surprise us\n\nLike this.\n\nAnd I loved this New Yorker cartoon and have kept it for a while and I'm ready to throw it out now:\n\n\"They rifled through our drawers, ransacked our closets, and completely redeveloped the central character in Carltron’s novel.”\n\nAnd finally, a Tom Jones poem my friend Julie sent me a while ago because we're always on the lookout for pop-culture poetry, \"Because I cannot remember my first kiss\" by Roger Bonair-Agard.\n\nBut who doesn't remember their first kiss?\n\nSo there’s the quiet, formal, contemplative haiku and then there's the rambunctious, genre-bending, boundary-pushing area of experimental and eLit poetry. On experimental poetries, I found some interesting things:\n\nMonsieur Big Bang recently sent me this link to Marie Osmond from the show Ripley's Believe it or Not. She's in a yellow robe doing a dramatic reading of Dada poems, specifically reading Hugo Ball’s sound poem “Karawane.” All I can say is \"Wow Marie, we hardly knew ye.\"\n\nMy friend Maryanne sent me this link to a whole carousel of poetry readings on The New York Times “Read T a Poem\" page. It's got a a very clunky user interface. Here’s another list that includes some, but not all the readers, which include Amy Adams, Brian Hutchison, Jim Parsons, Andrew Rannells, Matt Bomer, Michael Benjamin Washington, Lauren Ridloff, Joe Mantello, Charlie Carver and more.\n\nI have yet to get Dreaming Method's last project running on any of my computers but they've just announced a new eLit project called Thanner Kuhai:\n\n“A metaphorical and poetic journey about finding hope against all odds, Thanner Kuhai transports the reader/player into an immersive cave environment where language becomes intertwined with natural surfaces in a glimmering subterranean world. Navigate a labyrinthine network of flooded tunnels and passageways teeming with strange life and shadows of words. Submerge deeper. Or seek escape to the surface.”\n\nSee a preview at http://www.dreamingmethods.com/thanner-kuhai/.\n\nAnd I know I’ve been insisting here that lyrics and poetry have more in common than not, (since Bob-Dylan-Nobel-Prize-gate last year), and I recently had a very unfortunate hard drive accident, (coupled with a miraculous file recovery), that scared me into backing up all my old files. As I recreate a lot of them into newer formats, I’m finding that (a) I had no idea how lame my early ideas were and (b) I had no idea how appallingly shrill and cocky I sounded in old college essays. It’s been painful. I now wonder if this hard drive accident was the universe kindly trying to delete my old self on my behalf.\n\nAnd lo and behold, I see I felt the same way about what was and was not poetry back when I was in graduate school at Sarah Lawrence. In one paper, our professor, poet David Rivard, asked us to write about our favorite poems and the majority of mine were not poems. They were a hodge-podge of poems, song lyrics and found quotes.\n\nI even had this to say before I launched into my list:\n\n“Since we have consistently failed in poetry to at least come up with a working definition of what it is, no one's going to tell me what it isn't.”\n\nHoly crap I was smugly confident! That was a real circle snap. And the whole essay is like that. Painful.\n\nThat said, I'm happy to see I included Joni Mitchell's “Last Time I Saw Richard” (which I once memorized and would read aloud as a poem) and I often think about this prose poem I made from a Grary Shandling joke:\n\nAnd honestly,\n\nthat's a problem that's plagued me\n\nthroughout my life.\n\nIn fact,\n\nI did not know that there was a picture\n\non the other side\n\nof the drive-in screen.\n\nI thought all the cars were wrong\n\nwho were on the other side.\n\nIt was a very philosophical approach.\n\nI thought they were wrong,\n\nI was so convinced of it.\n\nAnd I never went around to look.\n\nAnd then there was the Rupert Holmes song “Studio Musician” on the list, a song I once loved from Barry Manilow’s 1977 live album. Barry Manilow even adds his jingle for State Farm at the end of it, reminding us he was a studio musician of sorts, a jingle writer.\n\nAll the discomfort of encountering my less-than-charming former self was somewhat alleviated by being reminded of this very lovely thing."
