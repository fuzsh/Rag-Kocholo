        "text": "SHUFFLER 0080: MY EYES ARE MY APPLIANCE TO DECIPHER THE SCIENCE\n\nTuesday, March 17, 2015\n\nAceyalone – “The Guidelines” from A Book of Human Language (1998 Project Blowed)\n\nWe’ve written about Aceyalone in an earlier Shuffler, but indirectly, while writing about DJ Mumbles. Now we finally get to give this gifted MC his due.\n\nIt’s a funny thing, but because of the popularity of G-Funk and gangster rap (I can’t bring myself to leave the word “gangsta” on my screen with anything approaching seriousness), it seems like most casual hip-hop fans are unaware of what a huge bohemian/avant-garde/alternative hip-hop scene the West Coast produced in the nineties, specifically the Los Angeles area. People think LA hip-hop from that era, they think Dre, Snoop, Ice Cube (but never his weirdo cousin Del), etc. When people think bohemian/whatever hip-hop, maybe they think New York: Digable Planets, Tribe, De La Soul, etc. Or maybe that’s just my perception of how people think.\n\nAt any rate, I have to wonder if Aceyalone wouldn’t be more of a household name if he hadn’t existed in the long shadow of the corporate gangster rap machine that dominated the West Coast at the time.\n\nBut then I remember that mainstream culture doesn’t always vaunt brilliance the way we wish it would, which is why, I suppose, the National Endowment for the Arts tapped me to start this blog.\n\nOkay, maybe that’s not how it went down, but it should, just like we should all recognize Aceyalone’s genius.\n\nIt’s a genius that almost shouldn’t work. His music is super jazzy, very much a part of the nineties coffee shop cool that may have existed more strongly in our collective will than it ever did in actuality, but in Aceyalone’s case, he really was that cool, which is part of the attraction. His flow is very much influenced by spoken word, too, which (and I’m really putting myself out there now) for me means that it has a high likelihood of being unbearably annoying, insufferable.\n\nBut somehow it’s not. And I suppose that’s because Big Ace (as he calls himself in this track) spent a ton of time honing his craft. He first came out of LA’s Good Life Cafe open mic scene (the importance of which, I’m given to believe, can’t be overstated), which is where the Ace’s first group, the Freestyle Fellowship came together. Their deal, as you might imagine, was freestyle rap. I’ll tell you that their 1991 album To Whom it May Concern… is a must-have, and then I’ll let you sit with this rather laudatory Wikipedia statement:\n\nFreestyle Fellowship’s vocal techniques focusing on the method of freestyle rap and their successful infusion of hip hop and jazz established the group as forerunners in the subgenre of jazz rap and placed them amongst prominent West Coast underground hip hop acts of the early 1990s such as Hieroglyphics and The Pharcyde.\n\nAceyalone was also part of the Project Blowed collective, which began as a freestyle rap/open-mic workshop (also centered around the Good Life Cafe) and then ballooned into something more: a rap crew, a label, two releases (2005’s Project Blowed: 10th Anniversary is a pretty instructive glimpse into this world). He’s also been involved in two other groups, the A-Team and the brilliantly-named Haiku D’Etat, but not knowing anything about either one, I’ll beg off any further explanation.\n\nSo when Aceyalone finally begins laying down the guidelines, it is with both a greeting of peace and a certain well-earned boastfulness:\n\nAsalaam alaikum, people of good will\n\nI offer you the greeting of thought manifested skill\n\nAnd that really sets the tone for what’s to come in the rest of the song, a lot of braggadocio. And I know, it’s tempting to write that off as a tired trope for the genre, but good god if Aceyalone doesn’t pull it off like a goddamn master, because he is.\n\nSHUFFLER 0066: BEATS AND HUMAN LANGUAGE\n\nSunday, December 28, 2014\n\nMumbles – “Vision” from Book of Human Beats (2005 Sound in Color)\n\nIt would be tempting to call Book of Human Beats the instrumental version of the 1998 Mumbles-produced Aceyalone record, A Book of Human Language. Indeed, much of what’s on the internet regarding Beats pretty much describes it as such. It’s easy enough to see why — Aceyalone, the bohemian West Coast rapper from Project Blowed and the Freestyle Fellowship (among other efforts) finds the perfect canvas for his spoken-word/free jazz/hip-hop approach in Mumbles’ beats. And as MC/producer relationships tend to go, Ace is pretty much the star.\n\nBut there were seven intervening years between the release of Language and Beats, and in that time there was enough tinkering to make Beats its own animal. For instance, while Aceyalone has a song called “The Vision” that clocks in at 1:56, the Mumbles version, called “Vision,” is 3:54. That extra two minutes — twice the “original” — is a lot of time to stretch out in. So much so that, to my ear, the beats are completely different. Even so, both are super chill exemplars of the best that jazzy bohemian/alternative/whatever hip-hop had to offer in the nineties. Mumbles’ beats could be called a West Coast response to Digable Planets, though that’s probably reductive and gives too much credence to the artificial West Coast/East Coast divide that the media loved so much in those days. More constructive, perhaps is this: if these records came out today they’d likely be on Stones Throw.\n\nSo, Beats is an instrumental version of an Aceyalone record, sure, but it’s also completely different, its own piece of art that stands on its own merit. One review states that “A Book of Human Beats doesn’t work as an instrumental hip-hop record, if only because Acey’s absence is so conspicuous,” which I think misses the point entirely. Listeners who go into Beats with Aceyalone in mind will likely be perplexed, sure, but the key as I see it is to go into this album valuing each track as one of Mumbles’ own unique creations. Approached this way, it won’t take long for the upright bass in “Visions” to transport listeners to a far more tranquil and utopian land.\n\nFinally, it’s worth noting that Mumbles comes from musical stock. This from the Sound in Color website:\n\n“Mumbles developed an ear for jazz and hip-hop music from an early age. His father, Steve Fowler, a professional flute and sax player, along with uncles Bruce, Tom, Walt, and Ed formed a musical legacy spanning from the early 70’s with the band, the Fowler Brothers. They played with Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, Bobby McFerrin, Linda Rondstadt, Ray Charles, Diana Ross, James Taylor and Brian Setzer, to name just a few.”\n\nFriends: As sometimes happens here at the Shuffler, the YouTubes can’t keep up with our eclectic tastes, and so I am unable to provide video for you to check out this song/s. In an effort to accomodate those of you who are eager to listen, however, I’ve provided a video below for a different Mumbles track. We’re all just doing all that we can, right?"
