        "text": "How did you first get into Myka 9?\n\nParker: In the early 90s I would watch Rap City on BET every day when I got home from school. One day in ’93, when I was about 15 years old, I saw Freestyle Fellowship’s “Inner City Boundaries.” I was just getting heavily into jazz — Miles, Coltrane, Monk — and I was listening to hip hop that sampled jazz — Digital Underground, Tribe, Digable Planets. But Fellowship wasn’t just sampling, they had a live jazz band and they were actually rapping like jazz soloists. They were really doing the damn thing. I ran out and got Innercity Griots, and it blew my mind. They were just so far advanced beyond any other rappers.\n\nKamal: I’ve always loved melodic double-time rapping because, being from the greater Cleveland area, I grew up on Bone Thugs. It was probably ’02 when I first heard Myka while playing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4, which featured the Haiku d’Etat song “Non Compos Mentis.” I was only 9 years old, but the melody from that song stuck with me forever. I eventually forgot what the song was called, who it was by, and how I had heard it, even though the catchy melody kept ringing in my head, bringing back childhood memories. But I vowed to myself that I would find out what song that melody was from before I died. It would take me another 12 years to stumble upon the song again. In 2014 I was getting really into Gift of Gab’s music and I found his song with Haiku d’Etat, “Top Qualified.” I really dug Myka’s nine styles displayed on that verse so I looked up his group. And on the second song of the first Haiku d’Etat album, I knew I had finally found the song! And Haiku d’Etat’s debut instantly became my favorite hip hop album. I started researching Freestyle Fellowship and Myka 9 as I went down the rabbit hole of LA underground hip hop shortly after watching This Is The Life.\n\nHow did this book first come about?\n\nParker: I have a long history writing and editing indie books of poetry, and I’m an editor as part of my day job. I got the honor to work on a book for Chillin Villain Empire, and I parlayed that into working on a book for 2Mex [Word Murder]. I told my fellow Blowed aficionado Kamal about it, and he said, “We need to make a book about Myka.”\n\nKamal: I knew a lot about Myka and knew that I could help with research for the oral history while also transcribing some of my favorite Myka rhymes. I also knew Parker was doing these books out of the love for underground hip hop and the innovators of the musical tradition. I was certain it’d be fun to work with him, and we became friends along the way, geeking out to our findings.\n\nParker: For the first few months, Myka kept saying yes, but he wasn’t sending us rhymes, so we weren’t sure if the book was really going to happen. Finally one night, the floodgates opened. Over the course of two hours, he sent 50 emails full of verses. I grabbed a cup of coffee and sat there gathering all the verses as he sent them, trying to place all these untitled verses, slowly realizing that many of them were unreleased. Some producers like JtheSarge and Freematik also hooked us up with a bunch of lyrics, and Aamir shared an a cappella of “Love Goddess” so we could hear the chops more clearly. Kamal and I transcribed about 35 songs, and Myka corrected everything. Kamal and I voted on all the songs to be included. Occasionally Myka would tell us he really wanted certain songs added or he wanted to cut other songs. We were serious about only including verses that worked well on the page, regardless of how good the song is. We also made sure to draw from his entire career, which was easy because he consistently writes dope verses.\n\nKamal: I think we made a diverse selection which gives the reader a closer look at Myka’s lyricism while also conveying his inspired point of view. The voting was really difficult for me. There were so many songs I wanted to include, but dissecting his full body of work would take years. Part of my editing process was to sit down and listen to every song in the book while reading along — it was the most fun I’ll ever have trying to find typos.\n\nParker: The oral history started as a four page biographical introduction that Kamal wrote just off the head. So I was playing catch-up trying to find the sources for all this stuff that Kamal already knew. Every old interview or podcast I found, Kamal had commented on it in the comments section three or four years earlier. He already knew everything, we just had to go find the quotes and references. He laid the foundation.\n\nKamal: I was shocked when he showed me all the work he put in, not only finding the sources, but also transcribing them so that these stories and this history can be preserved by those who were part of it rather than being paraphrased by some outsider. I remember telling Parker about Myka’s near-death experience, but I couldn’t remember where I heard the story. After weeks of digging, he found the interview with Brian Cross that I listened to 3 years prior… The 20+ hours of interviews for the oral history were the most exciting parts for me. We were lucky to have so many contributors willing to tell their side of the story. Since Parker and I already listened to basically every podcast, article, and interview that ever mentioned Myka, we knew what gaps in the history needed to be filled — and we tried honing in on those gaps to get the complete retrospective.\n\nParker: Once we started interviewing people, we just followed our curiosity. And we just went deeper and deeper. We talked to Myka a half-dozen times for a total of ten hours, going much deeper than any podcast can reasonably go. Myka’s such an improvisational genius that interviewing him can be like riding a bull with ADHD. But frequently his tangents were the most fascinating stories, telling me things I never would have thought to ask. It was nice to learn that it’s not just something he raps about — he really is this deeply spiritual guy. He taught me a lot about expressing gratitude. At one point he looked me in the eye and said “Thank you” five times in a row — and I was like, Damn, I felt that. I try to spread that love and gratitude to all the contributors and supporters of the book. During hard times, I have found myself repeating his mantra: It’s all love infinitely expanding and contracting simultaneously everywhere and God is greatest.\n\nWhat surprised you the most?\n\nParker: My jaw hit the floor so many times while working on this book. Haiku d’Etat’s “Still Rappin’” is one of my favorite songs of all time, and I was just astounded when he told me his verse was patterned after Gary Bartz’s “Celestial Blues” solo. That song’s been out for like 25 years and Myka just never mentioned that to anybody. I think that’s one of the great easter eggs in hip hop. I asked him if he did any other jazz transcriptions, and he was like “Oh well yeah I covered an Anthony Braxton song.” You did what? Myka 9 rapping over an Anthony Braxton song sounds like a crazy dream I’d have if I passed out after taking too many edibles. That just doesn’t sound real. But he sent it to me, and it’s amazing, and now the lyrics are in his book. I tried my best to pattern the lyrics so readers can see how it perfectly matches the Braxton song. I really hope the song gets released one day.\n\nKamal: The unreleased verses are some of the greatest in the book, especially the Braxton transcription. That may be my favorite Myka 9 song of all time. And it’s not even released!\n\nParker: Omid suggested that we contact Spoon Iodine, and it just never occurred to me that would be possible to talk to him. It was incredible hearing about the MC Aces days in the 80s. Spoon is really colorful and entertaining — I had a great time talking with him, for almost two hours. He laced us with some great quotes.\n\nKamal: Years ago I listened to an interview with Brian Cross where he recounted the origin story of Myka’s out-of-this-world styles. He said the legend amongst folks in LA was that Myka had a close brush with death when he was jumped in the late 80s and had to get a metal plate in his head. Supposedly, ever since he came out of that coma and relearned speech, his raps have never been the same. It was as if he inherited styles from another realm. I never heard this story from anyone else before, so I wanted to see if Myka was comfortable sharing it for the book. He went into detail about how he was beaten with a crowbar, shot, and left for dead on some railroad tracks. Then after waking from his comatose state he realized that he had written some rhymes in his head while he was unconscious. He revealed that a verse from one of his classic songs was written while he was unconscious. He woke up with almost an entire song in his head. He also said he did start getting more into chopping and styling after that experience.\n\nParker: That was so heavy hearing him tell that story. It’s really incredible that he survived. Imagine the alternate history of LA underground hip hop if Myka 9 had died of gang violence in the late 80s.\n\nKamal: Other surprises were all the dope contributors we were blessed with. Folks like Abstract Rude, Darryl “JMD” Moore, Factor Chandelier, Spoon, Myka’s former roommate Ronda Brown, MC Woes, Omid, Jerry Wilkerson, Riddlore, Ceschi, Fatlip, Daddy Kev, etc. They all provided a unique window into specific time frames in Myka’s career.\n\nParker: One of the most surprising things I realized while working on this book is how much this freestyle master focuses on cohesive composition and arrangement. He patterns his verses not only on the other rappers in a song, but he also occasionally matches pattern with his own verses. That’s matching not only the rhythm and melody but also densely rhyming with the other verses. That’s a tremendous amount of thought put into creating a cohesive musical vibe. And reading all the verses made me see a lot more dense rhyming that he does, especially in the song “Souls in Another World.”\n\nKamal: The intricacies of Myka’s patterns has always stood out to me ever since I started listening to him. I remember years ago listening to a podcast where Myka was talking about how back in the 80s the MC Aces would freestyle while matching each other’s patterns and also staying on the same subject matter. After hearing that story, I paid more attention to Myka’s patterns — and on his album 1969, I noticed a couple songs where he completely rhymed entire verses almost syllable for syllable. You could lay the 1st verse of each song over the 2nd verse and they’d rhyme bar for bar, with all the internal rhymes and patterns also matching. Then I noticed many collaborations where he matches the pattern of his verse with that of his collaborators. It’s really the mark of a master to be able to weave rhymes so intricately that you can rhyme your verse with your partner’s syllable for syllable and still keep the subject matter.\n\nWhat were the funniest things that happened?\n\nParker: When I hit up E-Turn, she included an emoji in her quote. I’m like, I can’t print that in a book. So I asked her to put it in words, and she replied, “mind blown emoji.” That made me laugh so hard I just kept it in the book. Some people were so careful about getting their quotes all grammatically correct, and E-Turn laces me with some internet lingo and an emoji. That was just so refreshing and so hip hop. Now I regret not actually printing the emoji…\n\nParker: The funniest stuff happened after publication, of course, with all the memes about Myka dethroning Aesop Rock as the new vocab king of hip hop. Check out “oh good, I hadn’t seen the chart lately” for all their fire memes.\n\nKamal: This guy JB Best, who I knew was a big Fellowship fan, messaged me to discuss the Myka 9 book, back when we had only announced the title. Something in the back of my head was saying Why is dude so intent on discussing the book? I remained open to talking to him but was skeptical, so I never set a concrete date.\n\nParker: So finally JB Best hits me up and says, “This is Pedestrian.” So I was like, oh shit, it’s Pedestrian from Anticon. We just didn’t know his government name. So I hit him up and we got on a zoom call that night, and he laced us with fantastic quotes about the influence of Myka 9 and the Good Life / Blowed on Anticon. It was great talking to him because he’s such a hardcore advocate of Myka 9, and he does not mince words.\n\nKamal: I was familiar with Pedestrian’s work but only knew him by his rap name. So for months I was unintentionally blowing off a founder of one of the most esteemed collectives in underground hip hop. He just wanted to contribute to the story because he was heavily influenced by the Good Life and Project Blowed. I had a good time talking to him. He’s so passionate about this musical tradition.\n\nParker: Factor was almost an hour late for our zoom call. I must have been hungry, because I was getting more and more annoyed. I’m thinking, Aren’t Canadians supposed to be polite? Then finally it dawns on me: maybe they don’t have daylight savings time in Canada… So I google “What time is it in Saskatoon?” — yup, they don’t have daylight savings, it was an hour earlier there. So I realized what a moron I was. That made me laugh pretty hard. Factor got on the zoom call a minute later, perfectly on time. I had a great time talking with him — really great guy, and he added so many cool stories and quotes.\n\nWhat stories do you wish could have been included?\n\nParker: Pedestrian told me a story about his first time doing shrooms — at Project Blowed with Myka and Xololanxinxo in Myka’s gold Cadillac. I should have put that in the book but I couldn’t find a spot where it fit. Existereo of the Shape Shifters told me a crazy story with so much violence and mayhem that it was wildly inappropriate for the book. He was like, Yeah, on second thought, maybe don’t print that one… Myka, of course, was in the midst of the mayhem calling for peace, saying “It’s all love!”\n\nKamal: I’d heard stories of Freestyle Fellowship battling Hieroglyphics in the mid-90s through a couple interviews with Casual and Myka 9, but Pedestrian filled in the juicy details when we talked. As the story goes, the year was 1993, right before the release of Casual’s debut Fear Itself. During an interview, Myka 9 was asked who some of his favorite upcoming artists are that might’ve been influenced by the Good Life scene. Myka shouted out Souls of Mischief, but the Hiero crew didn’t like how he implied that they were influenced by Freestyle Fellowship. So Casual went on the radio shortly after and dissed Myka 9 during a freestyle. This sparked the legendary battle between Hiero and Freestyle Fellowship that would take place at Domino’s house. The deal was that the loser of the battle would have to wear a shirt with the winning group’s logo during the shoot for their next video. Of course Freestyle Fellowship won the battle, so as you can see in the video for Casual’s song “I Didn’t Mean To,” Casual is rocking a white tee with the cover of Freestyle Fellowship’s album Innercity Griots. Both Casual and Myka 9 have spoken about this Clash of the Titans years later and admitted that it was all just some fun MC shit and that there were no hard feelings. Myka even collaborated with many members of Hiero later on, including Casual and Tajai.\n\nWhat are your favorite verses?\n\nParker: “Ghetto Youth” is such a specific portrait of his upbringing and it ends with that powerful transdenominational statement, I just love that verse. “Picture Book” is a nostalgic vibe about childhood — that song is so beautiful. “Big City” is such a beast lyrically, loosely flowing and tight at the same time. “Fly Paper” has some really tight lines with some dense rhyming too."
