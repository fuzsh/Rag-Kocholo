        "text": "(Chorus)\n\nBuild on solid ground\n\nAny other than it′s not solid as the granite rock\n\nWill fall to the ground\n\nIf it's planted in the sand it fails damaged by the wind\n\nBuild on solid ground\n\nA trilithon of 3 stones frequencies and earth tones\n\nFeel channel this sound\n\nCome out and show your reverence in numbers for the triumvirate\n\n(Myka 9)\n\nI want to lift\n\nThese MC′s are like the breeze\n\nThat flows above the petty thieves\n\nThat's beneath Ab Acey and me\n\nWe've come with gifts\n\nAs geez that have integrity we balance the inequity\n\nStay free from souls iniquity\n\nI once wasn′t\n\nAkin to those who blow with ease\n\nThe poetry takes hold of me\n\nI know the three of us agree\n\nWe′re running this\n\nAppeasing peoples' energy\n\nAnd pleasing sensitivies that we believe is remedy\n\nIt′s fun to hit\n\nWith entities that have degrees of talent\n\nThat exceeds the greed of some dem in the industry\n\nYou're bumping with\n\nWe who free their memories of malice for an enemy\n\nThe challenge is to live in peace\n\nOur function is\n\nTo be a source of harmony\n\nIncrease the trees of families release the true anatomy\n\nNo wonder it′s\n\nThe Project Blowed academy that's underground and battling\n\nWe′re simply overshadowing"
