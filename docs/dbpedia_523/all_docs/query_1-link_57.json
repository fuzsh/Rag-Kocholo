Enthralled by what she heard, she began to sing and perform her own music, infusing her innate grasp of jazz and soul into a warm, natural voice.\n\nMarti met DJ Drez shortly after high school, when they began performing and recording together. Over two decades, their collaboration has become an intimate musical language that effortlessly translates into and between many styles of music, including hip hop, reggae, kirtan, jazz and soul. Listen to any of DJ Drez’s albums and you’ll hear Marti Nikko’s unmistakably rich and nuanced voice. Her full-length albums, Dreaming In Sanskrit on Black Swan Sounds, Explorers of Infinity and Dreaming in Sanskrit Verse Two on Nectar Drop, combines her instinctive musicality with deeply devoted mantra practice.\n\nIn addition to Marti’s talents as a singer, songwriter and performer, she teaches yoga and pilates around the world and in the Bay Area where she and Drez live and love their 18-year-old son and 5-year-old baby girl.\n\nMahalakshmi weaves poetic lyrics into catchy melodies while accompanying herself on keyboard (piano).

Early in life, Mahalakshmi discovered a lifeline in music. Divine music came to her ear beyond any conscious intent and often arrived with words and chords complete.\n\nIt was through sound that she discovered bliss and peace. This internal discovery was and is a continual uncovering of treasure. Her clear and direct work in this life is to write and perform music that bathes herself and the listener in beauty and truth.\n\nWriting remains an output of her creativity, however, the only medium that fully expresses her innermost self is music.Mahalakshmi wishes to gift the world this music as it comes from the place where we all meet as one in our shared humanity, with pure intention of heart.\n\nShe is a reiki healer\n\nand music is an extension of her healing practice.\n\nFor over three decades, Emam has united musicians from diverse musical styles and cultures to record, produce, and perform original compositions.

To date, he has produced 23 albums under this label, including 17 Emam & Friends albums, as well as albums by Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia and Ustad Zakir Hussain.\n\nIn 2013, Emam met Mahalakshmi, and married six years later.

Whether she's leading a kirtan, performing original music at a concert or festival, or guiding students through a Lullaby Yoga session, she touches hearts with her soulful music and uplifting spirit. Her velvety voice, creative interpretations of music from various world traditions, beautiful original songs, and open-hearted presence create unforgettable musical experiences.\n\nJohanna wrote her first song at age 9 and had her first solo performance at 10, singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" at a children's charity benefit. By 20, she had performed in clubs, coffee houses, colleges, benefit concerts, rallies, festivals, musical theatre, rock and world-beat bands, gospel and women's community choirs, improvisational acting and singing troupes, and films.\n\nIn recent years, Johanna has been a featured artist and singing yoga instructor at major yoga and music festivals across North America. She has collaborated with renowned musicians and yoga teachers. When not touring, she spends time in Oregon doing yoga, singing, and giving back to her community.\n\nJohanna loves singing for yoga classes, especially Lullaby Yoga—her unique blend of music and restorative/yin yoga. In Lullaby Yoga, she gently guides participants through relaxing poses while singing and playing soothing songs and chants, creating a peaceful space for the mind to rest and the body to relax, rebalance, and restore itself.\n\nShe also provides music for RhythmAsana, a joyful blend of yoga, movement meditation, dance, and global rhythms. The band's mix of Johanna's originals and traditional music from around the world inspires both inner and outer movement.\n\nAs a Seattle native, I've been a part of the west coast music scene for three decades, DJing since the era of old school raves. My style is defined by squishy, undulating, tubular, and funky bass lines, blending genres like Breaks, Garage, Techno, House, Drum & Bass, 2-Step, Progressive, Trap, as well as Dub and other downbeat & chill-out genres. My performances are eclectic, rarely confined to a single genre. From 2001-2005, I headlined and organized club nights and events in Seattle and Portland before relocating my DJ career to Los Angeles. Although I stepped away from the scene in 2017 to embark on a new journey with holistic supplements at S.U.N. (Science Under Nature), the urge to animate dance floors has resurfaced. Get ready for the extraordinary as we create something truly unique together."
