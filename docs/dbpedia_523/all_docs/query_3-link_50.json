        "text": "Abstract Rude\n\nRejuvenation\n\n3.0\n\ngood\n\nReview\n\nby kingsoby1 EMERITUS\n\nMay 4th, 2009 | 10 replies\n\nRelease Date: 2009 | Tracklist\n\nReview Summary: Technically excellent rapping, preachy storytelling, and questionably dated production.\n\nIt's difficult to proclaim mediocrity here; likewise, it's hard to be contrary with lofty hyperbole. Abstract Rude means well in his first record since 2003, yet maintains a proclivity for Haiku d'Etat circa 1999 west-coast trappings. The title here is puzzling - rejuvenation is the antonym of what this record truly is - an exercise in conscious storytelling, jazz-influenced production, and melodic vocal arrangements. Familiar? It should be to any current hip-hop head; this could easily be confused for a recent release by another Haiku d'Etat alumnus - Myka 9's latest, 1969.\n\nThe very same rapper pretends to emulate the essence of jazz/scat in his one hundred mile-an-hour rhymes, and this melodic style is also ubiquitous throughout Rejuvenation. While not as technical (or ridiculous) as Myka 9, Abstract Rude's flow approaches a more ideal compromise between this style, soul, and spoken word. Preachy in his approach towards street life, self-empowerment, and social issues, a lot of the content here comes off as excessive; a lot of these subjects are played well past their respective expiration dates. Regardless of any slight vocal and lyrical issues, the questionable production further dates Rejuvenation. A hodgepodge of 1969-ish (sure, the time period too) samples and a processed-feeling, typical west coast beats (chill vibes and organs galore) combine with oatmeal consistency and flavor characteristics.\n\nThis isn't surprising: Minnesota label Rhymesayers (see Atmosphere, Brother Ali, POS) typically acts as a bridge between the east and west - with many artists combining the best (or worst) of both worlds. What is surprising: Rhymesayers allowed a product with Relic-status production to ship. For a clinic on technically excellent rapping, Rejuvenation delivers. But for a truly cohesive effort, look elsewhere.\n\nTweet\n\nRecent reviews by this authorThundercat ApocalypseNacho Picasso and Avatar Darko VampsterdamGorguts Colored SandsRun the Jewels Run the JewelsThe-Dream IV PlayJames Blake Overgrown"
