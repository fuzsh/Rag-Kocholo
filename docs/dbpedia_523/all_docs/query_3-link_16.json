The group returned in 2004 with their second album Coup De theatre, this album was to show off their individual strengths while having the ability to work together to make their music, and included other artists like gift of gab, Busdriver and Lateef.\n\nWith each artist having their own very successful solo careers and other hip hop groups it may be a while before the group returns for their 3rd strike to the hip hop community\n\nShow More"
