        "text": "Longtime Santa Ana resident Frank R. Castillo has self-published a new book about a chance spiritual encounter that he had with an elderly woman years ago and how it ultimately changed his life.\n\nCastillo – a part time computer instructor and paralegal who has been active in the community for years – wrote “The Teachings of Betty Whipple: A Spiritual Journey” over the course of several years.\n\nAccording to his bio, Castillo is a member of Chican@s Unidos, Los Amigos of Orange County, the Orange County Mexican American Historical Society, the Santa Ana High School Latino Alumni Association, Orange County Citizens For the Prevention of Gun Violence and the California Teachers Association.\n\nA book signing will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, April 4 at Libreria Martinez Books & Art Gallery, 216 N. Broadway in Santa Ana.\n\nCastillo recently shared information about his work with the Register’s OC Latino Link blog. Here’s what he had to say:\n\nQ. What’s the book about?\n\nA. The book is based on a true story about an elderly woman that I met when I was younger, and how she got me closer to God. It also mentions some of the things that she taught me.\n\nQ. How did you come up with the concept for the book?\n\nA. As you get older, you have more time to reflect on some of the things and people who have strongly influenced you.\n\nEveryone has these people and incidents, whether they are your parents, family, a teacher, a coach, a mentor or anyone else.\n\nThese are ordinary people, not movie stars or famous people, who have deeply impacted you. And I would like to share about one such person who strongly affected me and why.\n\nQ. How long did it take you to write it?\n\nA. It took several years, since I only write books on a part-time basis and because I work on several books at a time.\n\nQ. What is its message?\n\nA. That sometimes if you are open to it, you will unexpectedly meet people. Or you will be in situations that are incredible and you will have no idea at first.\n\nQ. Have you written other books?\n\nA. Yes, two others: “Cholos: Dreams & Nightmares” and “Chicano Today, Life in Aztlán.”\n\nQ. How did you become an author?\n\nA. I’ve been writing most of my adult life – including my first one at 20 years old – but I finally published one about 10 years ago.\n\nQ. Do you have any advice for others seeking to become authors?\n\nA. If you think you have something to say then follow your dreams and write. Get started and don’t wait for others. Take risks.\n\nQ. Are you working on any other projects right now?\n\nA. Yes. I’m trying to put out three books a year, including some children’s books.\n\nQ. Anything else you’d like readers to know about the book?\n\nA. I try to put out positive, inexpensive, easy-to-read books.\n\nWhen my first book came out, a well-known local Anglo politician exclaimed, “Someone from Santa Ana wrote a book!” It sounded like he had found a Martian.\n\nI thought, “How sad that in 2001 a Latino from Santa Ana writing a book is so incredible.”\n\nI hope that in the future what we Latinos in Santa Ana or elsewhere do will not seem so incredible but normal. Now hopefully he can say, “Someone from Santa Ana wrote three books!”\n\nCastillo’s book can be purchased for $10 at Librería Martinez Books & Art Gallery or from Rising Star Publisher, P.O. Box 3263, Santa Ana, CA 92703.\n\n“Like” OC Latino Link on Facebook or follow us on Twitter to see more news, information and conversation.\n\nMore events:\n\n[rssfeedme cat=”oclatinolink” feedpath=”category/events/feed/” max=”10″]"
