And my guest today, I think it's fair to say, also love movies. It's Sunday, June 26, 2022. And my guests are Frank Castillo, David Earl, and Dan Merle. Hello, gentlemen.\n\nVeu B00:02:11\n\nHello.\n\nVeu A00:02:12\n\nHello. Let's meet everybody individually and alphabetically, starting with Comedy Central Roast Battle 2 Champion. Frank Castillo is here. Hello, Frank. What up, Doug?\n\nVeu D00:02:30\n\nGreat to see you and hear you.\n\nVeu A00:02:33\n\nYeah, mostly hearing. We turn the cameras off and pretend like we're on old-timey radio or a four-way phone call, however you want to look at it. Party line, and it's a party time. We had a great time last night in Bakersfield. Of all places. Of all the places. You look at a map and go Bakersfield, probably not a great time. Turns out surprisingly delightful time hanging out in Bakersfield.\n\nVeu D00:03:06\n\nYeah, the beer is great. The crowd is really, really fun. It was actually really solid venue. Me and Taylor played arcade games next door for like an hour and a half.\n\nVeu A00:03:15\n\nYeah, we should say what these places are called, Timblor Brewing Company. And, you know, especially like if you're passing through Bakersfield, you're driving along the grapevine one way or the other, and you pass through Bakersfield, this is a great place to stop off day or night, I'm guessing, Timblor Brewing Company. It's a place where you just sit around eating, drinking those giant, giant vats of beer being made right there while you're sitting next to it.\n\nVeu D00:03:44\n\nYeah, it was amazing.\n\nVeu A00:03:46\n\nAnd they had comedy, and they had a comedy show. So we had delicious beer and did some comedy, and everyone in the audience was drunk on beer or trying to be. And it was a wonderful time, and thanks for being there, and thanks for keeping it together to do this today.\n\nVeu D00:04:03\n\nMy pleasure. I did wake up pretty late today.\n\nVeu A00:04:08\n\nWhat's the name of that place next door to Tumblr that you were playing the games at?\n\nVeu D00:04:12\n\nOh, I cannot remember, but I won my wife a Yoda plushie.\n\nVeu A00:04:18\n\nOh, that's good. I'm glad Disney is getting a proper plug.\n\nVeu E00:04:22\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:04:25\n\nThat worked out good. All right. Well, thanks for being here, dude. My next guest, I'm so excited about this from the movie that's in theaters now that goes by the name Brian and Charles. It's David Earl. Hello, David. Hello.\n\nVeu B00:04:45\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nVeu A00:04:47\n\nThanks for being here.\n\nVeu B00:04:48\n\nWould you have preferred the robot?\n\nVeu A00:04:53\n\nI gotta tell you, I'm a little obsessed with robots, movie robots, and I appreciate you being here as the human side of the latest robot and person movie. I have not seen it yet. I'm excited to see it all the way back from Sundance. People can't stop talking about it and waving about it. Well, wholesome is what they say all the time about it. Do you take that? Did you set out to make something wholesome?\n\nVeu B00:05:27\n\nYeah, we did, actually. And we made some changes in the edit because they were a little bit disgusted. There's a point where Charles sort of dies for 10 minutes and vomits oil. Well, no, no one wants to look at that. But I worked for ET, though, didn't it? Yeah, but the oil didn't look very good.\n\nVeu A00:05:49\n\nPeople love sick ET. And then he came back 10 minutes later. It was a real tearjerker. You're letting us get out of this movie without crying.\n\nVeu B00:05:57\n\nYeah, well, there's another bit where the mouse called out his mouth as well. It just kept vomiting every 10 minutes. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:06:09\n\nWell, that is an interesting issue for robots, is this shouldn't they even really be eating anything?\n\nVeu B00:06:15\n\nYeah, well, he does seem so.\n\nVeu A00:06:16\n\nYou know, they think they're human, they start eating, and they don't have a digestive system and all that business, right?\n\nVeu B00:06:23\n\nYeah. Yeah. We didn't sell it. We certainly didn't give any thought to that part of it. So, yeah, he just bunk stuff in his food and hope for the breath into his mouth and hope for the best, yeah.\n\nVeu A00:06:35\n\nWell, for our third guest today, we have a certified, we've actually done the paperwork, a certified fan of the film. And I think it's his first time on this show, which is shocking to me, because he's a six-time Movie trivia shmo down champion and his name is Dan Murrell. Hey, Dan. Hello. Thanks for having me.\n\nVeu C00:06:59\n\nI'm happy to be here. It is my first time. I'm glad the paperwork got through in time to be officially certified on the show. I was very concerned that that wasn't going to happen.\n\nVeu A00:07:07\n\nYeah, it really is. I've got an amazing team that really pulled it all together and made it happen. We also got we got patched into another country for this episode. I'm grateful that David has a nice connection and is also staying up late with us. Here's something nice for you to go to bed to after you're done here being stupid. You can just lay there with the thoughts of what noted film lover Dan Murrell has to say about Brian and Charles. Oh my god. Okay, I mean, it's here we go. Here we go.\n\nVeu C00:07:47\n\nI go into it now because it's yeah, please tell him tell him to his face. Oh, please. Tell me do like an hour of this. It was one of my favorite. This is my first year I've ever done Sundance and it's because they did it virtually. I've never been able to actually go and I've never been on this my first like full year with real movies coming out like all year that I've been a critic like independently. So I did Sundance virtually this year, and it's like, there's like a list of endless possibilities. It was literally like three 16 hour days straight of movies. And I was just picking movies and I was looking at the list and I saw Brian and Charles. And I have a great affinity for British comedy, number one, and silliness, number two. And I read it and I'm just like, this sounds like it's right up my alley. And it very much was, but it's like, it's, you know, I feel like when people use that word like sweet, people think like it's somehow like lightweight, but it's like, it's just such a funny, sweet, like hilarious movie. It's very much my style of comedy. And I did a, I did a meeting with some of my Patreon folks earlier today, actually, right before this. And it's come out in some theaters here in the US, but It's not like a super wide, like, you know, 4,000, you know, light year release, because, you know, they had to have all those empty theaters playing light year last week, and Brian and Charles can only, you know, have a very few of them. And I played a clip of the, of Charles wanting to sit in the front when they're going to town. And it, I will tell you, it crushed, like people were just like, I have to go find this movie. So I'm very happy to spread the word about this movie because I love it so much. It's one of my favorites this year.\n\nVeu B00:09:28\n\nWell, thank you so much. Honestly, it's so nice to hear that.\n\nVeu A00:09:36\n\nIt sounds like this movie moves the game forward, as it were, for robot rights. It's very pro robot. You know, yeah, it sounds very lovely. Really humane approach to robots. Were you? So David, you co-wrote this movie and co-star in it. Yeah. And how much were you and everyone else involved? Were you? Is there any particular robot movies that inspired? Your robot situation.\n\nVeu B00:10:19\n\nI've been doing stand-up in the UK as Brian, and he was a terrible stand-up comedian. That was the character. So I've been doing that for a while, and then I start... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I couldn't write any traditional jokes. I thought, I'll just go on stage and make people feel uneasy for 20 minutes. And then I thought, I'll do an internet radio show and make him like the world's worst phone in host. So while I was doing that, the producer of the movie Rupert called in. He was too shy to talk, so he He used this software and one of the voices was Charles, so we started this relationship over Skype. And so I asked Rupert, I asked Rupert a question, and he takes about 20 seconds to reply, but it's quite fun just waiting, that pregnant pause. And then while we're doing it, Chris, who's in the robot, in the film, he was listening, really enjoyed it. He said, oh, we've got to do this live. Let me build the robot. And we'll do some live gigs. So he built Charles over the course of, like, nine minutes. And we did some festivals. And yeah, so it's all Chris's. Chris thought he sounded like a professor. So he just got some wool and put it on a mannequin's head. Attached back to her. That's attached to a, like, a litter picker. And then that controls the mouth. And then Chris just got inside a cardboard box.\n\nVeu C00:12:01\n\nI would say it's not a lot to it. That's what I love, because I looked up some of the, after I saw the movie, I went back and realized like this, like you said, they've been with live stuff and had done it short. And I love that like quote unquote Hollywood Charles looks pretty much like regular Charles. Like there wasn't like a Hollywood makeover. Like it's so lo-fi.\n\nVeu B00:12:21\n\nIt's hilarious. Well, we definitely wanted to. We wanted to have that thing where the audience are watching game. Well, that's just a bloke in a box. Why am I watching this? I've seen some reviews saying we can see it's like a human being's finger. Well, yeah. And so we did sort of we enhanced the box a little bit. It's a bit sturdier for the film and we gave it a little bit of, yeah. Something around his knees and his calfs, but we wanted to keep it the same, so it just felt a bit cheeky. See if we can get away with it. Yeah. I mean, there were times when he walked on set as Charles, I was like, Oh, fuck me. How did we get funding for this?\n\nVeu A00:13:15\n\nYeah, it's not like, you know, it's not like a day or two commitment, like your feature of length committed to this idea. The sky in the box is going to be, people are going to buy into it.\n\nVeu B00:13:27\n\nYeah, we definitely have moments where we're losing confidence on set. But because we Because we made the short and that kind of went down well, and people seemed to buy into them and it. We were like, OK, just crack on.\n\nVeu A00:13:46\n\nYeah, that definitely must have helped a great deal, because if you just started with the future like saying you might have really had some some doubts.\n\nVeu B00:13:54\n\nWe would never have. No one would have funded it.\n\nVeu A00:13:59\n\nIt's a guy in a box. What are you talking about? Give us some money. I know.\n\nVeu B00:14:05\n\nWe've been finishing ourselves that, you know, we got a script commission and we thought, OK, we've got a script commission is never going to get made. And then I was getting made and then locked down here. Oh, okay. I was just going to be the first one on the shelf. Oh, God, it's not. Oh, right. We're filming it now. And yeah, just every step of the way about bloody hell. Yeah. It's very nice. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:14:27\n\nYeah. Well, there, you know, you don't have to, when one of the characters is a robot, you don't have to worry about them, you know, getting sick. That's a sturdy player you've got right there.\n\nVeu E00:14:37\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:14:39\n\nYeah. They didn't know he was a guy in a box. They didn't realize he was just as just as dangerous. All right. So speaking of robots, I got to know, starting with you, Dan, do you have a favorite robot movie? Oh, wow. I mean, yeah.\n\nVeu C00:14:58\n\nIt's tough because it's a tough one. I remember we did it when I was a screen junkies for years and years before this. And we did a video that was like best movie robots. And the comment section was all about why what we said were robots weren't robots. They're like, well, that's not a robot. That's that's an android and that well robots automaton. And that's so C three P.O. is not a robot because obviously it's so it's like, I don't even know. I mean, Is it offensive if I say the Iron Giant as a robot? I think it's a large robot. I would call the Iron Giant a robot, and thus I would say that's one of the best robot movies ever made, but then I think that people would get angry that I was like minimizing the Iron Giant by calling him a robot.\n\nVeu A00:15:46\n\nOh, you can call them a robot.\n\nVeu C00:15:48\n\nI'm calling them a robot. Maybe history will judge me poorly, but I am calling the Iron Giant a robot. And I'm saying that that is like maybe the best robot movie ever made.\n\nVeu A00:15:58\n\nI mean, I subscribe to a channel I saw it on and the channel is called Robot Plus. It's all the top robot movies. Yeah, I think it qualifies the robot movie, but you're right. When somebody makes the top 20 robot movie list, there's gonna be people gonna pick at it like crazy, because of how much of the robot the person is. Could we decide right now that it comes down to artificial intelligence, and it doesn't matter what it is inside, what it's, you know, for how much of it,\n\nVeu C00:16:33\n\nRight.\n\nVeu A00:16:34\n\nIf it's metal, if it's metal, there's some artificial intelligence.\n\nVeu C00:16:38\n\nYes.\n\nVeu A00:16:39\n\nIt's not skin and bone.\n\nVeu C00:16:42\n\nFor the sake of argument, I think, maybe.\n\nVeu D00:16:43\n\nWell, I feel like if it has artificial intelligence, it's still technically a robot, right?\n\nVeu C00:16:48\n\nSee, that's what we got into this argument because they're like, no, because a robot's an automaton. So then that is not a robot. I'm like, all right, whatever.\n\nVeu D00:16:55\n\nYeah, I'm a bit like. Realize it gets gained sentience, you know what I mean? It's like if a car was able to start thinking, you know what I mean? Right, exactly.\n\nVeu C00:17:05\n\nIt trusts me. It's a whole can of worms. So perhaps the broader definition is best.\n\nVeu A00:17:09\n\nI don't know. Yeah, it really does become when does a piece of mechanics become a robot and when does a robot have intelligence? Yeah, exactly. These are stages that have to be determined by somebody.\n\nVeu D00:17:23\n\nYeah, I think they covered this in the Animatrix. I think they did. We're getting very deeply. Yes.\n\nVeu A00:17:31\n\nI think you're very right about that. So Frank, do you have the favorite robot movie?\n\nVeu D00:17:38\n\nIron Giant was actually going to be my pick, too. That is the one movie where I cry describing the ending to people.\n\nVeu A00:17:47\n\nBecause you're sad that you're ruining the ending for people?\n\nVeu D00:17:51\n\nI mean, just because I was sad that movie is such a good movie. And it really is. So Finch.\n\nVeu A00:18:00\n\nOh, yeah, Finch is the Tom Hanks one with the dog and the robot.\n\nVeu B00:18:05\n\nOh, yeah. When we were editing Brian and Charles, we saw that come out. Oh, no. That's exactly the same.\n\nVeu A00:18:11\n\nWe got it. What I love about Finch is you look at the poster as Tom Hanks, a robot and a dog that's like, I guess a terrier or something. And then all it says is Finch. And to me, it's like, well, that could be any of those three. Any of them could be Finch.\n\nVeu D00:18:33\n\nThat's hilarious.\n\nVeu A00:18:34\n\nYou know what I mean? I need a little bit more information. But I've heard from people like our friend Frank Castillo here that there's a great movie. Was that just because you love robots, Frank? I think it's because I love Tom Hanks. OK. Well, you're going to have to check out Brian and Charles that doesn't have Tom Hanks, but it does have robots.\n\nVeu D00:18:59\n\nYeah, I'll be a trailer for the robot.\n\nVeu A00:19:02\n\nSomething I look forward to watching. That's awesome. You can see it in theaters now. Am I going to cry? Because I know that you're describing it.\n\nVeu C00:19:11\n\nIt sounds like I'm going to cry. You're going to cry laughing. Oh, OK. That was terrible. I sound like I'm on the publicity team for the movie. No, I'm loving it. I'm really enjoying it.\n\nVeu A00:19:24\n\nI like the idea of people seeing this movie in theaters because I feel like it would be fun to laugh together at this particular movie. That's the vibe I'm getting, sight unseen.\n\nVeu B00:19:39\n\nSomeone sent us a tweet this morning that they were sat beyond a woman in the theatre. And she just went, oh, this is silly and got up and walked out after today. I love a silly movie. Come on.\n\nVeu E00:19:52\n\nWhat is silly?\n\nVeu B00:19:56\n\nIf you're not into pine cones being glued on bags, it would wind you up a bit, I suppose. So I see her point a little bit.\n\nVeu D00:20:07\n\nOh, fucking bloody.\n\nVeu C00:20:09\n\nI'm going to go see this drama today about Welsh farmer who builds his own robot. It looks like a very serious drama. No silliness involved.\n\nVeu D00:20:18\n\nBut this is so funny to me that she's just like, oh, this is silly. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nVeu B00:20:24\n\nLoud. Yeah. Really angry with it.\n\nVeu A00:20:27\n\nYeah. Did you, for the title, Brian and Charles, did you have to consider whether or not do you actually use the word and or ampersand? Did you actually pick\n\nVeu B00:20:39\n\nOh God, we just went for the end. Right.\n\nVeu A00:20:44\n\nOh, you don't care how they how anybody spells it. It just means and right. It doesn't matter if it's an ampersand.\n\nVeu B00:20:50\n\nI haven't even thought about the ampersand. Right. Option. Yeah. I think if there's an ampersand in there, I would have gone, what are they doing that for?\n\nVeu A00:20:59\n\nWell, because you have an ampersand when it's stupid, like you and the other person you wrote it with have an ampersand between your names, because you did it together. So are Brian and Charles together in some way? Are they just two individuals with an and in between?\n\nVeu B00:21:15\n\nWow. It's often annoying. Jesus Christ.\n\nVeu A00:21:25\n\nI mean, I'll email you. I'll email you the answer. Just imagine the things I may ask you if I'd seen the book.\n\nVeu B00:21:35\n\nYeah, you're really touching it just rules there.\n\nVeu A00:21:38\n\nAll right, so. Before we get into the games portion of the show, I'd like to ask all of my guests to just recommend one movie. And we'll start with you, Frank. What's your recommendation this time? I think you were on the record once before with Finch. Oh, what have you got for us this time?\n\nVeu D00:22:00\n\nOh shit, it was on Netflix. I think it's this foreign movie. Shit, I gotta look it up.\n\nVeu A00:22:06\n\nIt's called, no, tell me a little bit more about it. Don't look things up. It makes it seem like you're cheating later in the show.\n\nVeu D00:22:12\n\nOh, no, no, I'm gonna tell you. I'm trying to remember what it was. I think it's like sins of the devil or something like that. It's about this. Woman, he used to work for an author who wrote like scary, like, serial killer books.\n\nVeu A00:22:26\n\nRight. And it all sounds familiar. It all sounds like something I didn't watch. But I, yeah.\n\nVeu D00:22:32\n\nSo he makes like an attempt, like he like makes like a pastor at work and then like his huge lawsuit and then like really fucked up shit starts happening to her and her family. And it's like really great move. It doesn't. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:22:48\n\nAll right, so it's on Netflix and it's.\n\nVeu D00:22:53\n\nI'll have to.\n\nVeu A00:22:55\n\nI'll have to think of it. Give me a sec. I mean, any movie titles got devil and I'm already like going to mix it up with something else because it devils all over the place in titles. Yeah. All right, let's move on to David, could you please recommend a movie?\n\nVeu B00:23:17\n\nThere's have to be new.\n\nVeu A00:23:18\n\nNo, it can be from, you know, just something you think people should see or that you could just particularly like.\n\nVeu B00:23:24\n\nI mean, your audience, but my favorite movie is American movie. The documentary. Yes, yes.\n\nVeu A00:23:33\n\nThat's a terrific one. I think you win already.\n\nVeu B00:23:38\n\nHave you met? Yeah. Have you had him on the podcast?\n\nVeu A00:23:41\n\nNo, I have not met him or had him on the podcast, but I'm certainly not against the idea because that movie is really terrific. It's hard for a documentary to be funny like a movie where all the comedy was planned. It's so beautiful how it worked out.\n\nVeu B00:24:05\n\nThat was definitely an influence for Brian and Charles, that movie.\n\nVeu A00:24:10\n\nOh, OK.\n\nVeu B00:24:11\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:24:11\n\nYeah. It feels scripted.\n\nVeu C00:24:12\n\nIt feels like it was written. It does, isn't it? I don't know if I believe that it was fake that came out today. I'd be like, somebody, someone's pulled my leg.\n\nVeu B00:24:20\n\nYeah. Yeah. Oh, so good.\n\nVeu A00:24:25\n\nAll right. So who's that leaf? Oh, the wrath of God. Now, I remember it. The wrath of God. So it's got, is that the one with Nicholas Cage?\n\nVeu D00:24:37\n\nNo, no, no, this is like, I think this movie's from like Italy or some ship.\n\nVeu A00:24:44\n\nI think his was called just Wrath of God with no doubt, but I think he was in a Wrath of God thing, because I can picture, you know, Nick, this cage face screaming.\n\nVeu D00:24:52\n\nI know there's an old, my stern movie called the Wrath of God.\n\nVeu A00:24:58\n\nYeah, it's one of those titles. I've spoken of this before on the show. I'm not liking that things can just like, like, there's this new movie, this new Adam Sandler movie that I liked about basketball called Hustle. But it's like there's a movie in the 70s with Bert Reynolds called Hustle. Like, what? You can't think of something else. Like, it has to be the same exact name as a previous thing.\n\nVeu D00:25:22\n\nHustle, the number Reynolds movie.\n\nVeu C00:25:25\n\nYeah. It's like the gift, that movie. I remember there was a great Sam Raimi movie, I think, called The Gifts, and then Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton are in a movie.\n\nVeu A00:25:35\n\nIt's also called The Gifts, and I have to specify. Yeah. I can't say the special gift or the unusual gift or anything. Yeah. It's a different title. Would it kill you? All right, so Dan, could you give us a recommendation? I mean, you've been seeing everything lately, it sounds like.\n\nVeu C00:25:58\n\nI see as much as I can. In theaters, I would recommend The Black Phone, which is a great movie that's directed by Scott Derrickson. It stars Ethan Hawke as this guy called the Grabber who kidnaps kids and locks them in this basement. But it's like survival. It's not awful depressing. It's like a survival story. It's really, really good. And then on Netflix, there's a film from India called RRR or Triple R. Oh my god. It's so good. I just watched. It's three hours long. It feels like it's an hour and a half. It's so good.\n\nVeu A00:26:35\n\nI have not dug in and watched it yet because I can tell I'm going to love it. But I also, the three hours is quite daunting, especially because I'm sure a great deal of that is actually pretty terrifying stuff with wild animals.\n\nVeu C00:26:55\n\nI mean, yeah, it's I think the lady who lost out of Brian and Charles would really think this movie is silly because it is all over the place. I mean, it is just like it is bonkers. It is it's bonkers in such a good way.\n\nVeu A00:27:11\n\nAll right, so I did get an email from somebody like the second it came on, just going, just do yourself a favor and watch it. Just don't worry about it. And then I saw that it was three hours long, and I watched a brief clip, and I was like, I don't know if I can handle three hours. But I will give it a go. But wait, so what was the other? You have to pick one, though. You just need to decide on one right now. So you want to? Well, I guess.\n\nVeu C00:27:36\n\nR-R-R-R-O-B on Netflix no matter what, so I'll pick the black phone because it's a great little, it's being sold as a horror movie, it's more of a thriller, and, you know, they make decisions based on how many people go to see things. So I'll settle on the black phone. I'll see that's what's going on.\n\nVeu A00:27:51\n\nLet's get people to go out to the theaters and see black phone. Yes. It's funny that I've always enjoyed when Ethan Hawke does his Yelly voice. I got to see him in a play on Broadway where he had got all Yelly voice at one point, and how loud and scary and intimidating it is. And then for it to now be in a horror movie, I find that delightful.\n\nVeu C00:28:17\n\nYes, that's a good contrast. He goes from gravelly Ethan Hawke to like Yelly. It's very performance. He's good at it.\n\nVeu A00:28:28\n\nAlright, these are great recommendations. Thank you for those. We're going to play some games right after these messages.

I mean, you'll figure out why we're doing this as soon as I tell you about it. It's called You Robot Me Robot. And here's how it works. I'll say in fact, could be fun, could be not so fun, but either way, you tell me if that fact applies to the movie I Robot, Or the movie Chappie, or both.\n\nVeu B00:31:29\n\nGod, I've never seen you.\n\nVeu A00:31:31\n\nYou've never seen iRobot or Cappy?\n\nVeu B00:31:34\n\nNo.\n\nVeu A00:31:34\n\nThat's all right. I can. Well, that'll make you just, I think you'll still remain competitive.\n\nVeu H00:31:40\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:31:40\n\nI don't know how much these other gentlemen know about either of those movies. Not much. I'll tell you that much. And sometimes you can just figure it out because what's going to happen is Frank's going to go first. I'm going to give him a fact and then he's going to tell me iRobot, Cappy, or both. If he gets it wrong, then it goes to David. Now it's been narrowed down to two. So you just pick one of the two remaining ones. And if you miss it, then it goes to Dan. He gets the gimme point on that first one. And each time somebody gets a point, the next person goes first in the next round. And there's just a few rounds. So little you need to know about these films to take a guess. But sometimes it's fun to figure it out. So Frank, here is the first fact is based on a book. And your options, once again, are iRobot, Chappy or both? I feel like iRobot is based on a book. But not Chappy, you're saying?\n\nVeu F00:32:50\n\nNot Chappy.\n\nVeu A00:32:52\n\nSo not Chappy, not both iRobot and Chappy. Do I say that right? Yeah. That is correct, sir. You did it. You cracked the code right out of the gate. You figured out that iRobot is based on literature and Chappy is based on God knows what. An idea of the screenwriters had. All right, so Frank's on the board is one point, but that means David gets to go first on this next one. Are you ready, David?\n\nVeu B00:33:30\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:33:31\n\nOkay. Here we go. I robot champion both is rated PG-13 by our system, which I'm not sure how it differs from your current system. But RPG13 means you should be 13 to get in, but nobody cares. Nobody checks. Brian and Charles, of course, is a PG. What's a PG? It means like there must be like one, somebody must say shit, or maybe there must be something that's just\n\nVeu B00:34:10\n\nA little bit saucy. OK, so little.\n\nVeu A00:34:15\n\nIt takes so little. Like, nobody wants to be rated G anymore, because then that means it's strictly for children. And now there's so many animated movies that are, you know, for all ages that it's real stigma to say you're rated G. So I'm sure even if you didn't have somebody who would have to fart or something in your movie, they would insist you get the PG and not get saddled with a G for being too sweet.\n\nVeu C00:34:40\n\nI think the bullies, I think the bullies probably took it up to a peak. Oh, there you go. That's enough to bump it up to a peach. Bullies.\n\nVeu A00:34:46\n\nBullies will totally take any movie up.\n\nVeu B00:34:48\n\nAnd I do a lot of farting as well. Yeah. I'm going to farting.\n\nVeu A00:34:53\n\nBullies are really annoying. I should have done. You're looking, you dodged an R. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that would have been too much. Both. Both. You're going with both of those. Yeah. I'm sorry, David, that is incorrect. Dan, what does that leave you with? What do you think it is?\n\nVeu C00:35:24\n\nI believe I'm 90% sure that iRobot was not rated R because it was a big Will Smith tent pole movie. So I'm going to say that only iRobot was rated PG-13.\n\nVeu A00:35:42\n\nOkay, so is rated PG-13 iRobot? He's cracked. You did it. Congratulations. Thank you. Frank, Frank, this game is your sluice. Also, the first game doesn't matter, David.\n\nVeu B00:35:57\n\nNo.\n\nVeu A00:35:59\n\nDon't let it just affect you at all. It doesn't matter. First game doesn't matter. All right. Whether you hear what the prize is for winning the first game, it's not worth the trouble. Okay. Frank. Yep. I-Robot Chappie or both has the song Superstition by Stevie Wonder in it. Just I-Robot. You're going just I-Robot has Superstition by the great Stevie Wonder. That's your answer. Mm-hmm. I love how you stick to your answers, Frank, especially when you're right. That is correct. You win this one time only game called You Robot Me Robot. Congratulations, Frank Castile. I'll tell you what you want right after this break. We'll be right back.\n\nVeu H00:36:57\n\nIf you're shopping while working, eating, or even listening to this podcast, then you know and love the thrill of the hunt.

That's R-A-K-U-T-E-N.\n\nVeu A00:37:46\n\nWe're back and Frank won our first game, which is so appropriate because does anybody seen that movie, Robot and Frank?\n\nVeu C00:37:59\n\nYeah, with Franklin Jell-a. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't seen that, but I know of it.\n\nVeu A00:38:03\n\nYeah, it's a real thing. And we're here talking about robots with Frank. This is so fun. I got to give a little lecture to the booking agent this week. This is terrific. OK, so Frank won. He's in the position to go first in our second and final game. That's all he won by winning that first game. He just gets to go first in his next game. Only becomes an advantage really if we go to a tiebreaker because everybody gets one turn to go first. It will rotate who goes first in each round. But the game we're going to play is called Filmally Feud. It's like Family Feud, the TV game show, but, you know, with film references and questions. All right. Yeah. Yeah. So I will give you the question that I posed to the internet. And then each of you will guess which one you think are the highest percentage of votes by, you know, just random people on Twitter. And not, you know, not the people themselves are random, but just I just mean, whoever answers the poll, I don't know who they are. So sometimes, you know what I'm saying? Sometimes they answer truthfully and other times they answer like they're on the internet answering questions. So you just don't know where it's going to go. So it's kind of fun to try to figure it out. And so I'll tell you what I posted, the question I posted, and the four options that I gave them in advance. I just had to narrow these down just four options. And then Frank will go first. Frank will choose. Between the four options, which one of you thinks gets the highest percentage, and the other two will choose after that, but after Frank will go to Dan and then to David, and then around like that, each time. You each get to pick one and then I'll tell you the percentages and that's the number of points you get. So we'll start with Frank. The question I posed didn't even put a question mark. I just wrote best movie robot. And I turned off the comments because I didn't need to hear it from people, which ones really are robots and which ones aren't for some reason. And the four that I picked for them to choose from were Bumblebee, Fermino Transformer stuff, Baymax from Big Hero 6, Wal E from the film of the same name, or, of course, Hal from 2001, Space Odyssey. Ooh. So Frank, you go first. Are those four, which one do you think people think is the best movie robot? And of course, these people have not met Charles yet, so we don't need even. Yeah, he's going to go rocketing up the list. Yeah, sure. I would have to say Wally. You're going Wally. Yeah, he saved humanity. Oh, OK. That makes him the best robot. I don't know. I'm not even sure what quality is going to be.\n\nVeu D00:41:30\n\nYeah, that was the thing because it's like we're talking about like the best evil robot.\n\nVeu A00:41:33\n\nHow? Yeah. Yeah. Dan, what do you think?\n\nVeu C00:41:37\n\nIt's tough because I'm not answering. I have to answer based on potential Twitter answers, which is very it's a it is a boy. It is a quagmire. All right. I'm just going to I'm going to try on it to second guess myself too much. I'm going to go with how the house in 2001. I'm going to pick how that's reasonable.\n\nVeu A00:41:56\n\nDavid, this is the only round where you have to pick thirds. You do get what you're left with, which is Bumblebee. You like that Bumblebee guy?\n\nVeu B00:42:10\n\nYeah, I like the sound of him. No one's gone for him, is that right?\n\nVeu A00:42:18\n\nThe internet, I don't know exactly how they feel about Bumblebee, but in this particular poll, they were not kind to Bumblebee. As it turns out, Bumblebee came in fourth place with only 8% of the vote. Those 8% are probably super into Bumblebee. Next in mind after Bumblebee was Hal, they perhaps, maybe because of the movies too old or something, only got 16%.\n\nVeu C00:42:47\n\nI should have known that to pick the old movie. What was I thinking?\n\nVeu A00:42:50\n\nYeah, I don't know. Yeah, it's hard to tell sometimes where it sticks with people and what doesn't. And then they match got 17%. And Wally walked away, you know, it's not a spring chicken. That's not a recent movie. Wally walked away with 59%. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so Frank's got a hot lead for a second and 59 points and Dan's got 16. David's got eight, but I'm telling you, it's anybody's game at this point. And Dan starts us off on this next round, and then David, and then Frank. Dan, what do you think these Twitter monsters, my Twitter babies, what do you think they responded to when I wrote worst movie robot? Worst one, same choices, bumblebee, Baymax, Wali. How? This is the question of the thickliness of the internet. These two questions were asked within minutes of each other.\n\nVeu C00:44:06\n\nOh, this is so tough. I, you know, I think I don't know your audience personally yet. I haven't yet met all of them individually. But I think that you cultivate a bit of a cinephile audience, perhaps. And so I'm going to say perhaps the ill will toward the Transformers franchise carried over to Bumblebee. And I will pick Bumblebee as the their pick for the worst movie robot.\n\nVeu A00:44:34\n\nOkay.\n\nVeu E00:44:35\n\nHmm.\n\nVeu B00:44:41\n\nI feel like my timing in this game has to help me. It was the second one, Baymax.\n\nVeu A00:44:49\n\nBaymax, Wally, or how?\n\nVeu A00:45:00\n\nI wish I knew what I meant by words, or what they were thinking when they answered, because it's just worse, because it could be like, you know, like the one that's worse to mankind, like, you know, like an evil robot or worse. I'm only going for how in case I put a box.\n\nVeu B00:45:20\n\nWhat's that? I'm going to go for how in case I would think in that.\n\nVeu A00:45:24\n\nOK.\n\nVeu B00:45:24\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:45:25\n\nSo David's got how and that leaves. Our good old Baymax and Wally for Frank to choose from.\n\nVeu D00:45:38\n\nAh, Baymax.\n\nVeu A00:45:43\n\nOkay. What do you want to hear first, the one that got the least amount or the one that got the most? Let's go with least. All right. Because nobody picked it. Walley only got 10%. I guess Walley doesn't do anything, you know, that we can judge it for. Is it does Wally have a sex, does Wally recognize as something?\n\nVeu C00:46:14\n\nI believe. I believe Wally is a he, I think.\n\nVeu A00:46:17\n\nHe identifies as a male robot because he hits on that one girl robot. I mean, I haven't asked, but that's my assumption. We're making assumptions about their shapes, basically. The shapes and the voices. Very male. Who's that? I said, Wally's very male shape. Is that blocky? Yeah. Yeah, and the other one, Eve has got curves. So we're not talking about her right now. Let's take her out of the picture. Or maybe that's why people thought that he's the worst because he's, you know, hooking up with a cute robot. You know, those people on Twitter, they don't get, you know, they don't get enough. Enough? Enough? What? Baymax got 14%. Frank, you got a little bit more than you would have gotten with Wild Ace. You were sort of cornered there, but you got 14 points for that. And then next in line is Hal, but with a pretty decent number, 37%. And then just a little bit above that is, of course, Bumblebee, the 39%. So Dan, if that one out, figure that out. All right, so David, you got to go first on the third round. It's going to is rarely a tie in this game. So this one's really, it's all about this one. I asked Twitter the following, best Julia robots movie. The options are, Mystic robot, pretty robot, robots 11, or Aaron Robotovich.\n\nVeu B00:48:10\n\nAaron Robotovich.\n\nVeu A00:48:12\n\nIs the best channel robot movie you think?\n\nVeu B00:48:16\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I think I'm all in this tournament.\n\nVeu A00:48:22\n\nI love that this is the first time anybody's called an attorney, I appreciate that. Everybody turn on the echo on your vocals. We're in the Coliseum now, and we're down to Frank, which one do you like to pick? What are my options again? Your options are Mystic Robot, Pretty Robot, or Robots 11. Robots 11. She was in robots 12, of course, but not robots 13. You're going 11. Yeah. Frank goes 11, everybody. All right, Dan, crucial choice here that leaves you with. What do you think of these remaining options, a mystic robot or pretty robot?\n\nVeu C00:49:18\n\nWell, I'm going to lean into the nature of the internet here. And for what I've seen, pretty robots tend to be somewhat popular amongst the internet crowds. So I'm going to select pretty robot. Final answer.\n\nVeu A00:49:32\n\nYou're going pretty robot, eh? Yes. Interesting, interesting. I'm tallying the scores. I guess I can tell you these in the meantime. You all sniffed it out again, Mystic Robot only got 8%. You know, it was one of her first, one of Robot's, Julia Robot's first films.\n\nVeu C00:49:58\n\nAn early work, yeah.\n\nVeu A00:49:59\n\nYeah, so it really took a pretty woman for things to take off, so that got 23%. Though that adds 23 to Dan's score of he's got 15, he's got 18, 78 total. All right. And then who's left? Oh, robots 11, 26%. Giving Frank a total of 99 points. David went with Aaron Rubatovich.\n\nVeu A00:50:49\n\nThat's 43 points to his score for a total. Of 88 points, it's two, it's shy by 11 points of Frank's 99 points. Congratulations, Frank. You did it. You're our winner today. We will have you back on the show very soon. But you get to do your plugs first. What would you like to plug?\n\nVeu D00:51:17\n\nYeah, I'm on the road in North and South Carolina, opening up for Polly Shore. And then I have a great podcast called Pete on YouTube and Pete TV on Instagram. Follow me, Frank Castillo. Thank you so much.\n\nVeu A00:51:35\n\nThank you, man. That was a good job you did there. Would you say going into today that your enjoyment of robots on film helped lead to this big win?\n\nVeu D00:51:50\n\nOh, absolutely. It was so funny you picked that robot because it was one of my more favorite movies when it came out.\n\nVeu A00:52:00\n\nAll right, well, congratulations. That's how these things work out sometimes. Your intense knowledge of iRobot really paid off. Who wrote the book that that was based on?\n\nVeu C00:52:17\n\nI do not know. I think it made that Isaac Asimov. I could be wrong.\n\nVeu A00:52:22\n\nIt was, in fact, Isaac Asimov. You show him off. Congratulations for knowing that. And David, I hope you don't feel bad that I've tried to, you know, gear it to all robots in your honor and it backfired on me. No. And we got this other guy over here who knows more about robots for some reason.\n\nVeu B00:52:44\n\nI don't know anything. I don't know anything.\n\nVeu A00:52:47\n\nI really think that this shows that how what an original move, what an original take on robots in your film is going to be because you just don't seem to know anything about previous robots.\n\nVeu B00:53:01\n\nYeah, exactly. This was an excellent test.\n\nVeu A00:53:09\n\nSo you've been promoting this movie. It's playing here in the United States as of a couple of days ago. And everybody that I read on Twitter talking about it, everybody finds it delightful. But the buzz has been great all the way back since Sundance. What else is there to know about it at this time? Is there any other announcements surrounding it?\n\nVeu B00:53:37\n\nNot only that it's out in the UK on July the 8th. Oh, so it hasn't even opened there yet? No. No.\n\nVeu A00:53:45\n\nYou've still got a lot more promoting it.\n\nVeu B00:53:51\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nVeu A00:53:52\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nVeu B00:53:56\n\nYeah, but that's exciting. I don't know how it's going to go down. I mean, yeah, so July the 8th in the UK.\n\nVeu A00:54:04\n\nWait, there's a chance that they won't be enjoyed in the UK, you think?\n\nVeu B00:54:09\n\nWell, whenever we make anything, no one's going to like this. So if anyone likes it, it's always a real one. Yeah, I see.\n\nVeu A00:54:20\n\nIt's your overall worldview. It's not necessarily. Yeah.\n\nVeu B00:54:23\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:54:24\n\nOkay. Yeah, because I feel like, you know, I feel like, you know, you made it in that language, so I think they'll appreciate it.\n\nVeu A00:54:34\n\nYeah. You know, if you made a movie, it was a robot going, beep, boop, boop, boop. And that could be, you know, that could be interesting.\n\nVeu B00:54:42\n\nNo, I'm interested in that.\n\nVeu A00:54:43\n\nYeah. So what's, what, what do you have plans for something next to you still just trying to get over the, uh, the, you know, release everywhere of the movie?\n\nVeu B00:54:55\n\nSo I'm writing a horror with the director of Brian and Charles, and me and Chris who wrote Brian and Charles, we're doing this, we're writing this thing at the moment, and yeah, it's all really early stages though, so yeah.\n\nVeu A00:55:13\n\nI mean, that sounds awesome that you have something that you all want to do together again.\n\nVeu B00:55:20\n\nYeah, we found a little idea that's excited us, so yeah, hope fingers crossed.\n\nVeu A00:55:27\n\nAll right, well, well, you know, we'll look for that. But in the meantime, everybody, including myself, needs to see Ryan and Charles. We're not sure if it needs to be an ampersand. Could just be the word and... No, if you're thinking about that, wouldn't you? Yeah. You're really not.\n\nVeu B00:55:45\n\nYes, you're not focusing on the movie.\n\nVeu A00:55:48\n\nIf you're worried about the ampersand, wait till you see the guy in the box.\n\nVeu B00:55:52\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nVeu A00:55:58\n\nIt's not for picky people or annoying people. But thank you so much for being here. Thanks for having me. And Dan Merle. What do you got to plug besides all the millions of things you're doing?\n\nVeu C00:56:13\n\nYeah, I'm on YouTube, youtube.com slash Dan Murrow movies. That's where you can find me doing box office and reviews. And I've already told my viewers they're going to get sick of me talking about Brian and Charles. So I three of them said they went to see it. So that's upwards of like $36 dollars. Oh, hey, guys. So, you know, I know every little bit.\n\nVeu B00:56:33\n\nWhat do I say about?\n\nVeu C00:56:35\n\nI'm like, I don't know the conversion rate is currently. I have to have to look at the currency exchange rate. But no, go find Brian and Charles. Hopefully I don't know the streaming plans here in the US, but maybe hopefully soon to watch on streaming. I don't know. Just go find a call. Yeah, like they have a thing with peacock after x days to maybe stream, but go find it. You're not going to be.\n\nVeu A00:56:58\n\nYeah, don't worry about streaming streaming like that. The thing anymore in a few weeks, go see the movie in a theater right now. In fact, in fact, turned off before I do my plugs. That's how strong I feel. About you should go see it immediately. But I do have a few things I wanted to plug. And thank you, Dan Mural. July 10th, I'm doing stand up at in Huntington Beach at a club called the Rec Room. That's an afternoon matinee show. And on Sunday, July 17th. Douglas Movies returns to the Dynasty typewriter in the Hayworth Theater in Los Angeles with some fantastic guests, not unlike my amazing guest today. For all of my dates go to DouglasMovies.com and thank you once again to Frank Castillo. We'll be back soon. David David Earl, who the door is always open when this next one, the horror movie, comes out. Please come, you know, see us again. By that, I mean, you know, call us from wherever you're, wherever you're sitting. And, and, and damn, you're all. Thank you again to you, dude. Sorry. It's been so long before your first time, but we'll have you back as, as often as you like. Oh, anytime. Let me know. I'd love it. I had a great time. All right. Well, I'll pop head to the end for about seven or eight years from now. I close with a closing line from a movie each time. And so that includes this one. And I'll give you a hint before I say it. It's the closing lines from what some would call a robot movie. As always, I didn't know how long we'd have together. Who does?"
