        "text": "Have you ever stumbled upon a \"hidden ally\"? These gems, akin to \"diamonds in the rough\" of the sales industry, could be the key to unlocking and expanding your most significant accounts. 🌟 Hidden allies are those invaluable connections you haven't made yet - past customers, old colleagues, or individuals with shared experiences. They’re the people who are more likely to engage with you because of a pre-existing connection to your solution or network. 🤝 Adobe research reveals that warm introductions make buyers nearly 4x more likely to purchase. This isn't just a small boost; it's a game-changer for any sales strategy! 💡 🔍 For example, take Sarah Brazier🍀, a former Gong Account Executive. She leveraged past customers as hidden allies with phenomenal success. These individuals knew the product, easing the path to re-engagement in their new roles. LinkedIn Relationship Manager Nicole Zucker and VP Kimberly Dieter echoed this sentiment, underscoring the power of mutual connections and alumni networks to provide sales intelligence and deepen customer relationships. 🤗 And it's not just about making a new sale - it's also about retaining and growing existing deals. Douglas Cole and Zoe Neuschatz from LinkedIn share how reaching out to former colleagues helped them navigate and win back accounts. 👏 So how do we find these hidden allies at scale? LinkedIn Sales Solutions is a powerful tool that aids in this very pursuit, offering lead search filters, Relationship Explorer, and Team Link features to help identify and connect with these potential allies. In a competitive market, relying on chance is not an option. Smart sellers and teams actively seek out these hidden allies, knowing the value they bring to the table. Are you tapping into the power of hidden allies in your sales process? If not, now's the time to start! 💼✨ #SalesExcellence #LeadGeneration #BusinessDevelopment #LinkedInSalesNavigator\n\nYou don't realise how much potential businesses overlook by being sceptical of companies they haven't heard of... The big names you've heard of often charge a lot and deliver subpar work. Large corporations use them simply because they're within each other's networks, not because they're the best. With every client, we celebrate with bottles of champagne, to an upwards and onward partnership. At Soudcoh, we believe in doing things differently. We may not be the biggest name, but we pride ourselves on delivering quality work and building genuine relationships. We're an Australian consulting company looking for good business, and we know that means earning your trust and exceeding your expectations. We work hard to provide exceptional service in the hope of a referral. Our business is growing fast because our clients see the value in what we do and spread the word. We don’t rely on a big name; we rely on the results we deliver. We start with a free call to understand your needs and tailor our solutions to fit them perfectly. Don't let scepticism hold you back from working with a company that genuinely cares about your success. At Soudcoh, we're here to make a difference.\n\nWhile we haven't had one take off yet, I've decided to make the Reciprocity Ring a weekly event. If I can host a space that helps just one person in my network solve a problem, I'm happy to do it. So, here we go! It's time to host another Reciprocity Ring! 🌟 How It Works: 🌟 Imagine a virtual circle of professionals. Everyone can make a request, no matter how big or small, and the collective wisdom and connections of the group come to your aid! 💪 It's like having your own supportive think tank right here on LinkedIn. 🔑 One Golden Rule: 🔑 \"If you help someone else, you MUST also make a request of your own!\" 😇 It's all about reciprocity. Lend a hand, but don't hesitate to seek help when needed. Keep an eye out for opportunities to support others as they make their requests. 🧠 Expand Your Horizons: 🌐 LinkedIn is a treasure trove of talent. Don't limit your requests to your industry—ask about anything! 🤯 People are multifaceted, and you might be surprised by the hidden gems in your network. 🎉 Let's Make Magic Happen! 🪄 Join in, have fun, and let's tackle challenges together! 🌠 Ready to start? Comment with your request or offer to help below, and let the reciprocity begin! 🚀 Have a large network? Comment for reach. The more people that see the ring, the more questions we can answer!\n\nPoor qualifying is a common new business mistake in agencyland. We're overly optimistic about the stage of the opportunity, the fit with our expertise and our odds of winning. This leads to the pervasive and expensive problem of the overallocation of resources to early-stage or otherwise poor-fit client prospects. The Qualifying Conversation is a vetting conversation, where you use a framework to get answers to predetermined questions so that you can determine a fit and the appropriate next steps. Unlike the subsequent conversations that may follow in the sale, your tone here is one of cautious discernment. You are not trying to leverage your passion and enthusiasm for the opportunity, instead you're adopting the clinical demeanour of a selective professional. Watch Shannyn Lee play the agency in a mock Qualifying Conversation while I play an impatient and curt client. Note the calm, graceful way Shannyn takes control in the sale and drives the next steps, even when the client is a bit of an a-hole. ;-)\n\n🚀 New Blog Post Alert! 🚀 Hey everyone! I’m excited to share my latest blog post on the importance of networking for Solutions Engineers. When I first started in the tech industry, I thought networking was just about collecting names and asking for favors. I’ve since learned it’s about building genuine relationships, sharing knowledge, and supporting each other. In this post, I dive into: • Why networking matters • How you can help your network • My journey with amazing groups like PreSales Collective, SE-Nation, Lesbians Who Tech, and Engineers Without Borders • Tips for effective networking Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting out, building a strong network can open doors, provide valuable insights, and lead to lifelong friendships. Let’s keep connecting, sharing, and growing together! 👉 Read the full post here: https://lnkd.in/gZ-nvbtn 👈 #Networking #SolutionsEngineer #TechCommunity #ProfessionalGrowth #PreSalesCollective #SENation #LesbiansWhoTech #EngineersWithoutBorders #CareerDevelopment #LinkedInFam\n\nYour business is where it is because of a series of decisions and steps. Perhaps the most crucial of these steps is the vetting of prospective clients. Imagine each client as a step toward or away from your vision of the successful firm you're trying to build. If you look back at the clients you took on and the engagements you agreed to you will see that some advanced your vision and some distracted you from it. Better vetting (qualifying) of opportunities can not only weed out bad fits, it can help ensure that an engagement that could go either way (good client or bad client) is corralled and saved. The sale is the sample of the engagement to follow. It's your opportunity to take the reins and shape the engagement. Too often however we are passive in a qualifying conversation, letting the client vet us without doing our own vetting and thus handing the reins to the client. Watch as Win Without Pitching MD Shannyn Lee adroitly models a qualifying conversation with a difficult client (played by me ;-)) that needs some polite reining in. This is what selling expertise looks like."
