        "text": "FORT MYERS, Fla. — The Red Sox placed pitcher Frank Castillo on unconditional release waivers yesterda offered outfielder Adrian Brown back to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.\n\nYesterday was the last day Boston could release Castillo, 6-15 with a 5.07 ERA last season, and not have to pay his entire salary. Castillo will be paid $200,000 of his $800,000 salary.\n\nGeneral manager Theo Epstein said money wasn't a factor, but did say that Castillo's contract gave the team fewer options for keeping him in the minors.\n\n\"It was a baseball decision,\" Epstein said, \"what they can do for us on the mound and what kind of flexibility they offer.\"\n\nCastillo was one of five pitchers battling for two final spots in manager Grady Little's bullpen.\n\n\"It was a tough decision for us,\" Little said. \"He took it like a man, and we wish him the best.\"\n\nIf no team claims Castillo off waivers, he would become a free agent. He could end up back in the Boston organization but could not play in the majors before May 1.\n\nCastillo has a career 82-103 mark and 4.55 ERA in his career with Boston, the Chicago Cubs, Colorado, Detroit and Toronto.\n\nBrown, picked in the winter meeting draft in December, had to be on Boston's opening day roster or be offered back to Tampa Bay. Epstein said he didn't know if the Devil Rays planned to claim him. If they don't, Boston would like to have him back, but wouldn't be willing to trade for him, he said.\n\nLittle said Damian Jackson, who plays infield and outfield and was battling with Brown for a roster spot, had made the team. He also announced the team would carry 12 pitchers instead of 11, but that he wouldn't settle on a bullpen until this weekend's final two exhibition games in Atlanta.\n\nREDS DOMINATE RED SOX, 6-1: Jason LaRue tagged an otherwise sharp Pedro Martinez for a two-run home run yesterday, and Sean Casey added two hits as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Red Sox 6-1 at Fort Myers, Fla.\n\nIn his final preseason tuneup before opening day, Martinez dominated the first four innings, facing the minimum 12 batters. He hit leadoff hitter Felipe Lopez, but got Aaron Boone to hit into a double pla retired 10 straight after that.\n\nBut Martinez, who finished with nine strikeouts and no walks, stumbled in the fifth, giving up a double to Brandon Larson, an RBI single to Case the two-run homer to LaRue.\n\n\"I made one mistake where the cutter got away from my fingers,\" he said. \"That was it.\"\n\nAfter the game, Martinez said he was aware of no progress in contract extension talks. He has said he won't play in Boston in 2005 if the team doesn't pick up his $17.5 million 2004 option before the end of spring training and sign him to a new contract.\n\nJimmy Haynes pitched five solid innings for Cincinnati, allowing five hits and no runs and striking out two.\n\nNOTES: Cincinnati catcher Kelly Stinnet was ejected in the ninth inning. ... Jackson pinch-ran for Nomar Garciaparra in the seventh after Garciaparra was hit with a thrown ball on a play at second base. He was fine. ... Cincinnati's Adam Dunn saw his hitting streak end at five games. ... The Reds broke a five-game losing streak."
