Sellers will take your offer more seriously when you have a pre-approval from a lender. With this complete, you can now start your home search.\n\nFinding the right home takes time, there are many things you need to look for and work out with the sellers. Once you find the home you would like to purchase, make and offer, and come to an agreement with the seller, we will submit your loan to our processing team.\n\nThis may seem far from simple for people, but Neighborhood Loans has you covered! The mortgage loan processor is the link between your loan officer and underwriter. We collect and verify all the documents necessary to prepare your loan. This is arguably the most important part of the loan process.\n\nAfter you’re cleared-to-close, we will schedule your closing and fund the loan on the day that is most convenient for you. After the final documents are signed, you will be given the keys to your new home! We look forward to helping you through our home buying process.\n\nOur five-step mortgage process starts by applying online and getting pre-approved within 24 hours. This will require you to provide us some basic financial and personal information. We will take that information and get back to you with a pre-approval letter.\n\nGetting pre-approved determines how much we are willing to lend, allowing you to shop for homes with confidence.
