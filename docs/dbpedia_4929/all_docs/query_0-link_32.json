        "text": "is one of the main characters of How to Get Away with Murder. She is a secret weapon in the making. A quiet, sensitive idealist who enrolled in law school after graduating from Brown University to learn how to defend the less fortunate, Laurel manages to stay under the radar, making it easy for her fellow classmates to underestimate her. With a profound attention to detail and inventive mind, she's talented and darker than anyone realizes, including Annalise. She disappeared at the end of \"Please Say No One Else Is Dead\" along with her son Christopher Castillo. It's later revealed in \"Annalise Keating Is Dead\" that Laurel fled to Brooklyn with Tegan Price's help out of fear of her family and what they might do to her and Christopher.\n\nBiography[]\n\nLaurel Castillo was revealed to be the daughter of billionaire Jorge Castillo. During Season 1 she strikes up a relationship with Frank Delfino. She also helped her fellow Keating 5 members bury the body of Sam Keating after Wes Gibbins hit him over the head with a trophy while trying to save his then girlfriend Rebecca Sutter. She also helped to cover up everything that happened the Night at the Hapstall Mansion. During Season 3 after the NYPD were investigating Wes Gibbins about the shooting of Wallace Mahoney Laurel and Wes Gibbins struck up a sexual relationship which ended up in the birth of their son Christopher Castillo. It was revealed that Wes was Christopher Castillo's father after his death in the Fire at the Keating House.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nLaurel was born in Mexico along with her brother, Xavier. Her parents divorced in the midst of her mother's emotional breakdown when Laurel was at a very young age. She was subsequently institutionalized. Approximately in 2007, Laurel was 16 years old when she was kidnapped. However, the governor did not let Jorge pay the ransom, and she was somehow released. After this, her father managed to convince her to say that she made the whole kidnapping up in order to cover her father's back. Not only that, her father was also involved in some shady business at Antares Technologies which triggered her to leave home as soon as she could. Her father also remarried; Laurel disliked her stepmother and only came home on Christmas. She eventually got into law school in Philadelphia. (\"Best Christmas Ever\", \"It's Time to Move On\", \"Always Bet Black\", \"He Made a Terrible Mistake\")\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nLaurel tries to get help from Frank. (\"Pilot\")\n\nLaurel Castillo first speaks up in class on her first day of Law School when she interrupts a one on one conversation between Wes Gibbins and Annalise Keating. Annalise is trying to help Wes answer a question, but Laurel shouts out the answer before he can get it. She's scolded for taking a learning opportunity away from him. Laurel and the rest of the students are then taken to see Gina Sadowski, a client Annalise is trying to help. She asks the students to come up with a defense for the woman as a competition. Laurel gets straight onto the task and when she reveals her idea, she makes it through to the next part of the challenge. She begins attending the court sessions and is witness to an impressive rivalry between Connor Walsh and Michaela Pratt. After one court session, Laurel goes to the restroom and sees Gina stood in front of the mirror. She goes into one of the cubicles and spies on her, seeing her get comforted by the wife of the man she apparently tried to kill, implying they're in cahoots and she's, in fact, guilty. Laurel reveals this to Frank Delfino, but he explains that he already knew before making some misogynistic comments. Laurel is angry that these lawyers are so immoral and would let a guilty woman walk free. After the trial is over and Gina is found not guilty thanks to Nate Lahey, Annalise's boyfriend, Laurel observes more friendly behavior between Gina and the other woman. Back at the university, Annalise reveals that Laurel is one of the students who won the competition, but a smile from Frank implies that he influenced the choice. (\"Pilot\")\n\nMurder of Sam Keating[]\n\nStopping Sam from hurting Rebecca. (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\")\n\nConnor, Laurel and Wes are driving to Annalise's place. They have to drive slow as there is a massive gang of drunk people going to the bonfire. Wes tries to call Rebecca but she's not picking up. Connor comes up with scenarios of what could have happened to her. Wes is confident that Rebecca went to the Annalise's. Wes tells Connor that Sam killed Lila so that's why Rebecca is going over there as she is trying to prove it. Connor thinks that its a joke. Wes tells him to believe him and drive faster. Laurel is confused as why would Annalise represent Rebecca if she knew Sam was involved. Wes says that he would go to the police if she did. Connor laughs and says that he blackmailed Annalise. Laurel tells Connor to shut up and ask Wes if he thinks Sam killed Lila. Wes agrees. Connor's car arrives and everyone gets out and runs to the house. Inside, Michaela is trying to calm Sam down but he is not backing down. Rebecca is in the bedroom with Sam's laptop. Sam tells Rebecca that if she doesn't come out, he's coming in. Wes, Connor, and Laurel arrive in the room and tell him to stop. Sam tells them all to get out of his house. Wes tells him that once he has let Rebecca go, they will leave. Sam informs then that she took his laptop and asks them what she is trying to get. Wes tells him to calm down again and he backs away from the door. Wes walks up to it and tells Rebecca that she can come out. She opens the door. Wes tells Sam that they will leave now. Sam tells them to go as he is not going to do anything. Wes and Rebecca walk to the door when they are tackled to the floor. Sam tries to reach for the memory stick and grabs it. Wes has him pinned down and gets Laurel to get the stick off of Sam. Sam breaks free and they all run out of the bedroom door. He comes at Michaela so she pushes him over the landing. He falls onto the ground floor. Everyone stares at the body. (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\")\n\nSam's lifeless body. (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\")\n\nMichaela tells them that they need to call an ambulance. Connor doesn't see the point as Sam's dead. Connor says that he was alive until Michaela shoved him over the railings. Michaela says that she was protecting Laurel. Laurel says that because they were all there, they are all at fault. Connor disagrees. Laurel says that they broke into his house and that Sam was defending himself. Michaela quietly says that she was only there to turn in the Trophy. Michaela thinks they should be calling an ambulance. Connor corrects her again and says that they need to call the police. Wes speaks up and tells them all that no one knows that they are there. Laurel reminds them that Annalise could be back any minute. Wes tells them that that's why they should leave. Everyone stops talking as Sam is strangling Rebecca. Michaela freaks out and tells everyone to do something and to get him off of her. Wes grabs the trophy and hits Sam round the head with it. Blood splatters everywhere. Sam falls to the ground, dead. Rebecca's face is covered in blood. Everyone stares at her. Wes drops the trophy. Everyone in their own way freaks out. Wes removes his jacket and tells everyone to get ready to leave. Wes picks up Rebecca and carries her up stairs where he washes off the blood. Back down stairs, Connor, Laurel, and Michaela are silently freaking out. Connor goes to the kitchen to throw up. (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\") Laurel walks over to Sam's body on the floor. Rebecca is sitting in a chair when Wes wraps a blanket around her. Connor enters and demands that Michaela stands up and not cower in a corner moping. She just sits there. Connor gets a bit more violent but Laurel shouts for him to stop. Laurel crouches down beside her and tells her softly that they need to leave. Michaela is still not listening so Laurel says that everything is going to be ok. (\"Smile, or Go to Jail\") Connor walks over to Wes and Rebecca and says that Michaela is going to ruin it for them. Wes tells him that she will be fine. Connor quickly tells Michaela to get up again when Wes reveals that he has a plan. (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\")\n\nThe group hear a knock. (\"Let's Get to Scooping\")\n\nLaurel and Connor are to take Michaela to the woods while Wes will get Rebecca out of there. Connor is worried as Wes wants them to split up. Wes reminds Connor that Rebecca shouldn't be at the house. Just them, Asher knocks on the front door and shouts to see if anyone is inside. Everyone inside freezes but Connor goes to investigate. Asher shouts that he can see Connor's car in the driveway and carries on banging on the door. Michaela whispers that it's all her fault. Connor agrees with her. Asher continues to shout through the door and demands that Michaela gives him back the trophy that she stole. Laurel sees Asher moving round to the windows and tells everyone to get down and hide. Connor lays down beside the body and tells the corpse that he is so so screwed. (\"Let's Get to Scooping\") Laurel contemplates letting him in as then he will become a part of it. Rebecca suggests that they trick him into stepping in the blood. Laurel agrees but Wes doesn't as he wasn't a part of it. Laurel listens closely as she doesn't hear Asher anymore and goes to check. He's gone. Michaela appears and reveals that she texted him claiming to be at the library. (\"Freakin' Whack-a-Mole\")\n\nLaurel in the woods. (\"Pilot\")\n\nIn the woods, Connor, Laurel and Michaela are standing around waiting for Wes to show up. Michaela gets nervous and says that Wes and Rebecca could have gone to the police and pinned it all on them. Michaela goes to call her boyfriend but Connor speaks sense to her as she can barely form a sentence. (\"It's All Her Fault\") Wes runs in and scares them. He opens his backpack and reveals a bloody trophy that he went back for. Michaela tells him to go and put it back but Laurel says that it was a good idea taking the murder weapon. She says that they should clean it and put it back after they bury the body. Michaela and Connor disagree because they will have to drag the body through town in the busiest night of the year. In addition, if they get the body out of the house unseen, the ground in the woods is frozen. Laurel says that they will have to dig all night if they have to. They all start at each other but Wes tells them all to stop and suggests that they decide by flipping a coin to see whether to get the body or leave it where it is. (\"Pilot\") Wes tosses the coin and it lands on heads which means that they go back for the body. Wes grabs his things off of the ground and tells them all to go. (\"It's All Her Fault\") Michaela stops and says that it makes no sense at all. She seems confused with the plan. She doesn't know what they are going to do with the body once they have it. Wes says that they will burn it. Wes says that the flames will get rid of their DNA and Connor says that the bonfire will cover the smoke. Laurel has an idea. They can go to the bonfire and use it for their alibi. At the bonfire, drunk students and teenagers are throwing wood onto the fire. Music is playing really loudly. Wes and Laurel take many selfies of them doing things that they would be doing if they were drunk so that if anyone asks, that have proof that they were there. Connor does the same. Michaela just stands there when Connor grabs her and tries to make her look like she's having fun. Michaela isn't smiling so Connor tells her to smile, or go to jail. Michaela smiles for a few selfies. (\"Smile, or Go to Jail\")\n\nLaurel talking to Michaela (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\")\n\nAfter the bonfire, they return to the crime scene. Connor asks what the plan is and offers a few suggestions. Wes tells him that they will roll him in a rug and deal with that later. Michaela phone buzzes on silent and she sneaks off into another room to answer it. As Laurel comes back with paper towels to mop up the blood, she notices her leaving. Laurel quickly puts the paper towels down and grabs the Trophy that Wes hands her and goes to the kitchen to clean it. When she gets in there, Michaela has her phone in her hand. Laurel asks her if she was about to call Aiden. Michaela claims that she wasn't but Laurel isn't convinced. So she walks over and snatches the phone out of her hand and checks. Laurel informs Michaela that if she calls him, the cell tower will place her at the scene of the murder. Michaela claims to know. Michaela snatches the phone back and tells her to not treat her like she's a child and walks out of the kitchen. Laurel then resumes washing the statue in the sink. (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\") Wes and Connor are rolling the body in the rug on the floor. Michaela refuses to look or do anything. Laurel comes in and reveals that she washed all of the blood off of the trophy and the sink. Laurel asks what they should do next. Wes says that they should put the trophy back and Connor says that they should get the here out of there. Wes, Connor, and Laurel try and lift the body but can't as it's too heavy. They all look to Michaela for help. She reluctantly walks over and grabs one end of the body. They all struggle to move the body outside. A cop appears. The cop asks them if a car blocking the sidewalk is theirs. Connor owns up and says that it's his and offers to move it. The cop asks if the house they're in is the law professor. After a pause, Michaela saves them by saying its Annalise Keating's place and that they are moving her old rug out of the house. Michaela gets out her phone and offers to call Annalise to confirm. Michaela improvises by saying that Annalise went to her mother's funeral. The cop backs down and hears a bottle smashing. He quickly apologizes and leaves to chase after a few rogue teenagers. (\"Pilot\")\n\nFrank calling Laurel. (\"Pilot\")\n\nAfter putting the body in the car, they drive out of Annalise's driveway and onto the road. Laurel suggests that they go to a gas station. Wes says that the gas station Laurel suggested was to close as they could bump into people they know and should go further away. Laurel suddenly notices Asher crossing the road directly in front of the car. Connor stops the car before he plowed him over. Connor tells them that \"this is freakin' whack-a-mole\" and drives off. (\"Freakin' Whack-a-Mole\") They drive out of town to the gas station Wes suggested. Connor tells them that they are all screwed and that Asher knew that they were in the house. On top, they also have the cop that was a witness. Connor gets paranoid with all of the things that they have done wrong. Laurel tells Connor that he has said enough. Connor \"agrees\" and puts on the radio. Christmas songs begin playing. Connor says \"perfect\" and changes the words of the song to fit their situation.(\"Let's Get to Scooping\") Michaela begs him to stop. Wes gets into the car after going to the store. He tosses Laurel some potato chips. He said that he bought other stuff so that he wouldn't look suspicious on the surveillance video. Connor continues to sing along to the jolly Christmas song. (\"Pilot\") Once in the woods, they hear a couple laughing while carrying the body. They quickly take cover behind a tree and turn off their flashlights. The couple begins to get naked when Laurel's phone goes off. The couple stops and shouts \"who's there.\" Laurel quickly gets her phone out of her pocket and ignores the phone call from Frank. The couple shouts again and flees when there is no reply. Michaela asks Laurel why Frank is calling her and that she saw the picture of him without a top on her phone. (\"Pilot\") Wes jumps to conclusions and asks Laurel if she told Frank about what they are doing. Michaela gets jealous because they never allowed her to call her fiancée. Laurel admits to them that she slept with Frank but she hasn't told Frank anything. Michaela asks her why they should believe her. Laurel says that she doesn't have to as they aren't friends. Connor tells Laurel that she is a cheater and she agrees. (\"We're Not Friends\")\n\nLaurel and the others burning Sam's body. (\"Let's Get to Scooping\")\n\nWhen they reach the spot far away from the bonfire where they can't be heard or seen, they unravel the body from the rug and cover in twigs and lighter fluid. Wes asks if they all agree as there is no going back. They all agree and Wes lights a match which shines a light on Sam's face. Wes throws the match on the body and it sets on fire. (\"Pilot\") While burning the body, Laurel gets another call from Frank. Connor makes a snide comment. Wes suggests that she answer it. Michaela agrees as it strengthens their alibi as you can hear bonfire in the background. Laurel answers it and Frank demands to know where she is. She responds by saying that she's at the bonfire and to stop calling her. Frank wants to explain but Laurel won't let him as he lied her and was using her. He tells her not to shut him out. Laurel ends the call by saying that it's too late. (\"We're Not Friends\") After burning the body, Connor repeatedly hits the burnt corpse, breaking it apart. Michaela looks away and covers her ears as to not hear the bones breaking. Connor stops and asks Michaela for help. Michaela tells him that she is just having a break. Connor won't take no for an answer. Wes and Laurel sit down. Connor tells Michaela that they need to see it through and to grab a trash bag and get to scooping up the bits of the body. He then resumes hitting the body and laughs at the same time. (\"Let's Get to Scooping\")\n\nGetting rid of Sam's body. (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\")\n\nWes and Michaela carry black bags full of Sam to Connor's car. Laurel is sat in the car while Connor is sat on a rock. Wes informs the group that they have put in the last bag in the car. Connor tells everyone to get in the car when Michaela realizes that she has lost her engagement ring. She tells everyone to wait and that it's gone. Everyone stops and turns around to look at Michaela. Michaela falls to the ground and looks for it. Michaela repeats \"I lost my ring.\" (\"Smile, or Go to Jail\") They all return to the woods to search for the missing engagement ring but have no luck finding it. Laurel informs Michaela that it's going to be light soon and that they still need to dispose of the body. Michaela refuses to leave until they find it. Wes questions her to see if she had her ring on when they left the house and Michaela says that she did. Connor says that they will have to cancel the wedding. Michaela cries more and Wes tells Connor to stop as they all still need Michaela to return the Trophy back to Asher. Laurel says that Michaela won't be able to do it in her current state. Connor isn't happy about this as he has done his part and it's time for Michaela to do hers. Laurel speaks up and says that she will do it. Connor questions how and Laurel says that she will figure it out. (\"We're Not Friends\") They all drive to a dumpster. Connor starts throwing the trash bags into the dumpster Laurel also helps. Michaela tries to stop Connor as her ring might be in one of them. Wes tells them all that throwing the body in the dumpster is a bad idea and that they need to get to an incinerator. Connor stops and says that Wes has been outvoted. Michaela grabs one and starts opening it. She puts her hand in and gets blood and parts of Sam on her fingers. She stands up and says \"oh, god.\" Connor walks over and tells her to grow up. He grabs the last bag and throws it in. Laurel makes sure that there isn't anymore. Wes stands there for a moment as he thinks they have messed up. Everyone's ready to leave but Wes still isn't in the car. Connor tells him that the train is leaving and asks him if he's coming. Wes reluctantly gets into the car and they drive off. (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\")\n\nLaurel taking to Frank. (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\")\n\nLater, Laurel knocks on Frank's door. Frank lets her in and Laurel says that she should be there. Frank thinks that they should talk them through. Laurel shakes her head and asks if Frank would do anything for her. He says that he would and he is now getting suspicious of what's she wants. She takes the Trophy out of her bag and puts it on his table. She asks him for his help. They sit down and Frank looks from the trophy to Laurel's face in confusion. (\"We're Not Friends\") She tells him that she stole it from Asher. She says that she has been really stressed out about the exams and that she still hasn't broken up with Khan and also when she found out about Frank's girlfriend. Frank corrects as she's his ex-girlfriend. Laurel doesn't care, she just tells him that she stole it and that she doesn't want Asher thinking that she took it. Frank seems a bit disappointed it wasn't something worse. He tells her that he will take care of it. (\"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\")\n\n(...)\n\nLaurel having Christmas dinner with her family. (\"Best Christmas Ever\")\n\nOn Christmas day, Laurel visits her family in West Palm Beach, Florida. While having dinner, her father talks about bludgeoning the city commissioner after golf. Her brother comments by saying that he should wait until Laurel passes the bar. With that said, Laurel pipes up and tells him that would be charged with more than assault for that, probably aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Her family is impressed and remarks her for her talent. Her stepmother tries to change the subject but Laurel cuts in and continues talking about her work. Laurel tells them of the things that Sam has allegedly done and her brother thinks she's joking. Her stepmother is surprised that she didn't tell her but Laurel responds with that if she bothered to pick up the phone once in a while, she would know more. She then remembers that she did call her once, but only to ask about her love life. She then tells her family that she is currently dating two guys at the same time. Her father tells her to stop in Spanish. Laurel, also in Spanish, tells him that she is sorry that talking about what is actually happening isn't more interesting than always talking about golf. Her father then tells her to leave the table and to go back to whatever she calls home. Laurel graciously thanks her father for the dinner and leaves smiling. (\"Best Christmas Ever\")\n\n(...)\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nDuring cover-up after Sinclair's murder at Hapstalls' apartment, Annalise tries to get Laurel to shoot at her, saying that she had gone through worse times with her father. Laurel steps forward and nearly takes the gun, but then walks away saying that maybe they all should go to jail for good. Laurel begged Wes not to shoot Annalise, but he ignored her. After the shooting Laurel takes the fall with the rest of the K5, lying by saying she shot Annalise. Annalise asked Laurel to keep an eye on Wes, which Laurel did. Laurel visited Wes when he was hospitalized for joking about suicide. (She Hates Us) She then books a flight to Ohio to help Wes figure out what happened to his mother. The two kissed during the trip. They find information on his mother's death, including that Wes was a suspect in the investigation.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nAfter finishing her first year of law school, Laurel leaves Philadelphia to go to Mexico to see her mother for the summer. Before leaving, Laurel visits Annalise Keating at the Keating House to tell her that she's leaving for the summer. The two talks about Frank Delfino and whether Laurel is still in contact with him. Laurel reminds her that she hasn't had any communication since he disappeared. Months later, Laurel arrives back in Philadelphia a week before her second year of law school begins and texts Wes Gibbins to tell him that she is back but he doesn't reply. (\"We're Good People Now\")\n\nAt her first day back in September, Laurel and Wes bump into each other at the univeristy. They awkwardly talk before going into class where the other members of the Keating 5 are waiting. After a rude interruption from new student Simon Drake, they take their seats. Annalise Keating introduces them to the clinic where they will serve as lawyers and possess clients. While this is happening, the students notice a flyer of Annalise with 'Killer' inscribed over it behind her. After dismissing it something a jealous student did, she continues and introduces them to their first case: a refugee facing deportation thanks to a possession charge. After talking with Karim personally, Laurel discovers that the drugs which Karim confessed to having didn't belong to him but to his daughter, Faiza Assaf. Laurel explains it to Annalise in class but she dismisses it as information which doesn't help their client. In court, Wes is first chair and presents Judge Lorraine Huffman the case. Later, the gang meets up at Oliver's Apartment where they all catch up after not speaking for the summer. Back in court, despite their efforts, the Judge rules against Karim and his deportation stands. After, Laurel goes to Wes' Apartment where Wes answers the door with his shirt off as he was expecting his girlfriend, Meggy Travers. He quickly puts on a shirt and Wes confesses that all he sees when he looks at her is Frank. Meggy soon arrives gives Laurel a hug. (\"We're Good People Now\")\n\nLaurel visits the Keating House and finds Bonnie Winterbottom moving some of the case files out of the way due to the clinic taking all of Annalise's time. Laurel asks about Frank just as Annalise arrives home. Later at class, Connor explains to the other Keating 5 that he and Oliver have broken up. Annalise arrives and introduces their next client, Irene Crowley - who is up for parole years after killing her husband. After all the students talk with her, Irene decides that Connor should represent her in her parole hearing. The following day, Connor gives everyone their assignments - Laurel and Wes are responsible with taking with Irene's sister-in-law to try and persuade her to listen to Irene's side of the story. The two fail as they couldn't get Amber to understand Irene's point of view. Back in the clinic, Laurel looks at news articles regarding Wallace Mahoney's murder. Wes catches her and tells her that he's trying to get past it. They then talk about Meggy: Laurel doesn't think that she can trust her so she tells Wes that she had a background check done on her. Wes admits he did the same and found nothing. After Irene is granted her parole, Bonnie and Laurel go out for a drink and play pool. Bonnie is particularly interested in Laurel's relationship with Frank and she comes clean that she repeatedly calls him and leaves voicemail messages for him. After, Laurel leaves Frank a fake voicemail saying that Annalise forgives him and to come home. All the while, Annalise and Bonnie are listening and telling her what to say. After Annalise tells her that all she has to do now is talk to her father. (\"There Are Worse Things Than Murder\")\n\nArriving at her father's company, Antares Technologies, Jorge greets his daughter with pleasure but tells her that he knows that she has come to seek help to find her boyfriend Frank, and tells her that he does not deserve her. Ursula, one of Jorge's conflict resolver tries to talk to both Laurel and her father which bothers her. They talk about her mother and their issues created by him leaving her. Later in the hotel where Laurel stays, Jorge arrives with a cake and the hopes that they can make peace. He offers her a deal: If she helps him sign some investment papers, he will give Frank's location. Laurel, annoyed, refuses to sign them and throws them in the trash before telling him to get out. In the night, Laurel receives a text from Wes but ignores it and later from Frank. She answers it and Frank informs her that he doesn't believe Laurel's previous voicemail. He starts talking about Annalise sending a hitman after him and she quickly hangs up the phone for fear that her father is listening. The following morning, Laurel returns to his office with the signed papers, and Jorge reveals that Frank has been hiding for a week in Coalport, Pennsylvania. Before his daughter leaves, Jorge apologizes to her for all the bad things she has done to her. Laurel hugs him, apparently forgives him before leaving for Philadelphia Once back, she lies to Annalise. She tells her that she couldn't pay her father's price for the information. (\"Always Bet Black\")\n\nJust before court, Laurel calls Frank and leaves him a voicemail. Wes knocks on the window and asks whether she is alright. The two then watch Asher fail in court with their new client, Tristan Fullerton. Back at the clinic, Asher gives everyone tasks to complete for the case. Laurel uses this time to escape and visit Frank's father at his auto shop. She asks him whether Coalport means anything to him but it doesn't. Later, Laurel can't let the Frank thing go which leads her to search for him in the criminal database. She finds nothing. Laurel gets a call from Meggy asking for her help planning Wes's party. She leaves the room briefly in case Wes is listening. Once she returns, Wes questions her where she went. Later, before court again, Laurel leaves Frank another message. Wes catches her and asks her what's up. She gets defensive but Wes tells her that he's there for her. Laurel then comes clean that Meggy is planning a surprise party for him that night. At this surprise party, everyone is there and surprises Wes when he enters. Everyone wishes him a happy birthday and gets drunk. Laurel, however is the one anomaly as she doesn't appear to be enjoying herself. She leaves and goes to the Keating House and catches the end of Bonnie's conversation with Annalise where she tells her that her father is dead. She mentions that he was in Coalport when it happened. Sometime later, Bonnie leaves the house and finds Laurel in tears in the porch. Laurel comes clean about Frank being in Coalport and Bonnie tells Laurel not to tell Annalise. (\"Don't Tell Annalise\")\n\nLaurel calls Bonnie later and asks her whether she has heard anything from Frank but she hasn't. Bonnie lies. Later, at the clinic, Wes tells the others that he is having dinner with Meggy's father that night. Simon offers his copy of the outline for the test in exchange for theirs. Connor eagerly accepts but soon realizes that he's been pranked. Later, Simon reads out an email he received from the university stating that Annalise has resigned and that they have a new professor. Wes wonders whether the university is actually allowed to fire her but Laurel says that she probably pushed too hard. Later, Simon accuses the Keating 5 of stealing it. He pays particular focus on Michaela who's having none of it and kicks off calling Simon. That night at Michaela's Apartment, Connor, Laurel, Michaela, and Asher are revising for their upcoming exam. Laurel is distracted and keeps checking her phone to see whether Bonnie has messaged her. Oliver later arrives with Simon's laptop. Michaela reveals that she stole it for the outline he promised. Oliver shows the others what he found: a copy of the flyer which has been plaguing Annalise. They then show Annalise the following morning who tells them not to worry, that Simon being the culprit behind the flyers is the best outcome they could have hoped for. Annalise later confronts Simon which results in him giving the others his outline at the clinic later. (\"It's About Frank\")\n\nBonnie tries to apologize for lying to Annalise but tries to make up for it by handing a recording of Frank confessing to Mahoney's murder. Wes ignores a call from Meggy but she then calls Laurel and tells her that the NYPD are at Wes' Apartment. Although Wes is up for talking with the cops, Annalise forces Wes to stay at her house. After their exam the following day, Annalise is back to work and hands them their next client, Daniela Alvodar. After class, Annalise invites everyone to her house where she explains to the people who don't already know about Wes' predicament and that he is Mahoney's son. Michaela, Connor and Asher fall out with Laurel because she didn't tell them. At her house, Laurel leaves Frank another voicemail accusing him of giving Wes' name to the cops. The following day in court, Laurel arrives and the others refuse to let her sit next to them for keeping secrets from them. That night, at the clinic, Oliver prepares for his date with Thomas. Connor arrives after talking with Wes and Laurel is curious about what the two talked about but he won't answer her. Later, Wes turns up at her place with the recording and smashes it in front of her. He tells her that he's broken up with Meggy and the two kiss and have sex. In the night, Laurel receives a voicemail from Annalise and notices that Wes is gone. She wonders around her house and finds him watching the news story. They have arrested Charles Mahoney for the Mahoney murder. (\"Is Someone Really Dead?\")\n\nAt court, the clinic students are shown a video of Edith Duvall who has been poisoned with antifreeze. She accuses her children. The three children are the defendants, Nelson, Karen, and Jared. Sets of students prep the three siblings for their upcoming deposition. Wes and Laurel interview Karen. After, Annalise tells the students that their next task is to introduce a new suspect and in return, Annalise will give the student an automatic A in her midterm. At the clinic, everyone is searching for potential suspects and Laurel and Wes sneak off to have sex. When they arrive back, everyone assumes that she was with Frank. The following day at the deposition, Edith is also there. Jared is up and he loses it when his mother jokes about his failing sex life. That night, Laurel and Wes are in bed together. Wes gets a call from Connor telling him that Charles has an alibi. Over to the Keating House, Wes catches Annalise in another lie. The others then take it in turns to tell Annalise how they really feel about her. Laurel says that she feels like a puppet. Later, Annalise calls Laurel back into the office as she wants her to do lead the deposition against Edith as she thinks that she poisoned herself. In the deposition the following day, Laurel stumbles at first but finds her feet later on and both Laurel and Annalise manage to get Edith to confess to poisoning herself. At the clinic later, Annalise gives the 'A' to Laurel. To celebrate, Laurel offers to but drinks for everyone at the clinic at the bar. After, she arrives home and is on the phone to Wes where she instinctively tells him that she loves him after saying goodnight. Frank is there. (\"Call It Mother's Intuition\")\n\nFire at the Keating House[]\n\nAfter being recovered from the burning Keating House, Laurel is rushed to Middleton Hospital where she is taken to surgery. Meggy Travers has her blood work and notices that she is pregnant. Meggy informs Oliver and Bonnie about Laurel condition who are waiting outside for news on Laurel. (\"Don't Tell Annalise\")\n\nEventually, the Keating 5, Oliver, Meggy, Bonnie and Frank find out about the pregnancy. Oliver, Meggy, Bonnie and Michaela find out first when they visit the hospital the night of the fire (\"Don't Tell Annalise\"); followed by the viewers learning that Frank knows too, as he's on the phone to Bonnie and she tells him (\"Who's Dead?\"); we then learn that both Asher and Connor find out when they visit Laurel another time, along with Laurel telling Asher, Connor and Michaela at that point, that the baby is Wes'. (\"We're Bad People\")\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nLaurel receiving a text from her father. (\"I'm Going Away\")\n\nJust before starting her second semester of the second year at law school, Laurel's father comes to visit. They walk around the university campus while talking about their lives. Laurel tells her father that she was pregnant but lies him by saying that she had an abortion. Laurel questions why he had Dominic come to keep an eye on her while she was in New York. Her father claims that it was because she wasn't returning any of his calls. Laurel receives a text from Annalise, inviting her and there Keating 4 to a meal with herself and Bonnie. Once Jorge sees her phone he gets the idea of a picture and asks a stranger who was passing by to take their picture. That night, Laurel was later late to the dinner, where envelopes awaited each person. Annalise said the letters couldn’t be opened until after dinner. Annalise revealed that she would retain her license to practice law after the trial. Laurel said she couldn’t drink to celebrate because she was having the baby and is due in five months. Annalise then said the envelopes held recommendation letters, as she was cutting them from her team. “We’ve been given a second chance. We don’t need each other anymore. So it’s time to go our separate ways,” she told them, pointing out Wes’ absence. “I ruined him, but I’m not going to ruin all of you.” Upset by this change, Laurel left emotionally. At Wes' Apartment (her new home since Wes died), Laurel checks her phone to find the picture of her and her father that he has sent. Laurel contemplates asking him why he had Wes killed but doesn't go through with it. She rubs her growing baby bump. (\"I'm Going Away\")\n\nThe Keating 4 at the law fair. (\"I'm Not Her\")\n\nLaurel completed some early morning research on her father's company, looking for dirt when Michaela messaged her reminding her that she should shower before the fair. At the Middleton University law fair, the Keating 4 meet with potential employers for an internship. They face tough questions about their poor grades, commitment level and why they even want to be lawyers. And, of course, they were asked about their internships with Annalise and what her experience had taught them. Later on in the day, at Oliver's Apartment, the law firms posted the results online where Michaela revealed that she got three call-backs. Laurel lied and told the others that she didn't get one to make Connor feel better being as he was the only one who didn't actually get a call-back. Connor returned to the law fair as the last minute attempt to score an internship, however, after failing, he heard one of the law firms call out Laurel's name, revealing to him that Laurel had lied about not getting a call-back. Asher and Michaela went to one of their call-backs at Caplan & Gold where Michaela ended up getting an offer for the job whereas Asher didn't. Laurel pressured Michaela to take the job with Caplan and Gold being as they are the law firm who work for Antares Technologies, her father's company. And Laurel wants Michaela to use her internship to gather information about it so that they can take her father down, because she thinks her father killed Wes. (\"I'm Not Her\")\n\nLaurel is revealed to be keeping the baby and in the first flash-forward of this season, her baby is seen to be missing when waking up at a hospital and her stomach flat ( \"I'm Going Away\"). She reveals the sex of the baby to Annalise when encountering her in the DA's toilet ( \"It's for the Greater Good\" ). Laurel realises that why Wes was killed and decides to attempt to eliminate the ability of Antares Technologies in launching their IPO with Caplan & Gold with Oliver, Michaela, Asher and Frank. ( \"Stay Strong, Mama\" ). Eventually, their plan goes into the wrong path with Simon accidentally killing himself, Asher arrested and Laurel soon into labour. Annalise hears her screaming while she is unknowingly giving birth to her baby and she sees the lifeless premature baby. Annalise then performs CPR on the baby successfully at the end. ( \"Live. Live. Live.\" )\n\nLaurel meeting her son for the first time since his birth. (\"Ask Him About Stella\")\n\nWhile doing work on Annalise's class action lawsuit, Laurel overhears Oliver's conversation with Frank over the phone and assumes he’s still trying to investigate Dominic, though this wasn't what Frank wanted to talk to Oliver about. She begs him to stop so her father won’t have a reason to block her from seeing her son. He says he will. Later, Laurel receives a text saying that she can meet her baby. She excitedly tells Michaela and Connor the good news. After the word gets around, Frank goes to Laurel’s apartment to request to go with her to the visitation. He feels responsible for the premature labor since he elbowed her and wants to be there for her... but really he just wants to keep an eye on Jorge and her mother. Later, at the hospital, Laurel is about to meet her baby for the first time. Frank realizes he maybe jumped to conclusions when Laurel's mother reveals she called Jorge every day during the week to allow Laurel to meet the baby on her own. Laurel decides to name the baby Christopher in honor of Wes’ birth name. She texts Annalise a picture of her with the baby and makes a tearful goodbye when the doctors tell her that her time with the baby is up. (\"Ask Him About Stella\")\n\nLaurel at the Supreme Court. (\"Lahey v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\")\n\nAt Bonnie's House, Laurel and Bonnie are watching an interview between Noah Baker and Ingrid Egan, the attorney Annalise would go up against at the Supreme Court the following day. Laurel is also trying to get Bonnie to have the court reinstate Isaac’s testimony now that he’s not being investigated anymore after Bonnie had the D.A. drop the case, but Bonnie ominously states he’s no longer a reliable witness. The next day, Laurel and rest of the remaining Keating 4, including Oliver make the trip to Washington D.C. to witness Annalise at the Supreme Court. After arriving at the court, Laurel and Connor can instantly tell that Michaela had spent the night with Marcus. She insists it was a one-time thing. But they don’t have time to talk dirty laundry because Michaela recognizes the guy talking to Justice Strickland in the hallway, inferring that the opposing attorney was conspiring with one of the justices. During the trial, Laurel, along with other associates of Annalise, witness her deliver her class action lawsuit, arguing its importance in society. Upon returning home, Frank plays a recording to her involving her mother and Wes which was recorded a day before he died which involved her mother offering him money to leave Laurel alone. (\"Lahey v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\")\n\nLaurel and Michaela comforting each other. (\"The Day Before He Died\")\n\nStill, at her apartment, Laurel is listening to the recording of her mom’s meeting with Wes. She wants to go to Denver to find out what he knows. Also, she thinks that they should tell Annalise. Frank demurs on this because Annalise already has a lot on her plate. Frank and Laurel go to see Sandrine without telling Annalise. Laurel plays the recording for her mom. Sandrine says Wes was a murder suspect and she wanted to protect her daughter. She flatly denies it. Back at her apartment, Laurel is trying to work out why Wes didn’t just tell her about meeting her mom. Frank promises to help her get her baby back at any cost. Later, Michaela visits Laurel to ask for advice about the Asher-Marcus situation. Laurel insists she’s a terrible person to give advice and Michaela wants to know why she didn’t tell Wes the truth about cheating with Frank. They acknowledge their tendency to sabotage anything good in their lives. After Simon wakes up from his coma, he reveals that he remembers Laurel at the party. Annalise later calls Laurel to inform her and for her to hide being as no one knows that she was at the party; however, after some interference from Annalise, she manages to get Simon to stay. Laurel later gives in and visits Denver’s office trying to make a deal. She offers to turn herself in for stealing the files from Caplan & Gold. But first, she reveals she has proof on her phone that he is working for her father. Laurel offers him the evidence if he gives her mother's phone records for the time that Wes died. They make the exchange. Laurel then visits her mother, saying she knows her mom got Wes’ message because Laurel got her phone records. Sandrine insists it’s because she wanted to help Wes, but Laurel isn’t having it. Laurel assumed Denver or Dominic warned her father about Wes, but now she knows it was her mother. (\"The Day Before He Died\")\n\nLaurel looking at the mysterious scratches on her arm. (\"Nobody Else Is Dying\")\n\nAfter arriving home, Frank's there, worried that she died in the accident. However, it was the district attorney who died. They all convene at Annalise's hotel room where Oliver worries about her father. Speaking of, Laurel gets a call from her father — he wants to know where her mother is as he’s convinced she did something to her. After dismissing him, the remaining Keating 4 worry that she may not be telling them everything. Laurel admits to them that she told her mother to kill herself but that was it. Later, the FBI wants to talk to her as she’s the last person to see Denver alive. While Frank goes off to look for her mother, Annalise goes with her to the office where Laurel lies and says Denver just wanted to talk about her father. Later on, Frank gets back later and talks to Laurel outside. Frank went to the hotel but could not find her mother. He wants her to tell him if she did something but she sticks with her story. Back inside, Annalise arrives and calls Jorge to give him an ultimatum to get him to sign Christopher back to Laurel which he goes for. The following day, Bonnie agrees that Laurel could stay at her house with the baby. At the hospital, Laurel is overcome to see her baby but overwhelmed by the instructions from the nurse. Jorge wants to say goodbye, but Laurel refuses and then asks her again about her mother. She says she doesn’t know and both Jorge and Sandrine are dead to her. Frank calls Annalise to let her know they have the baby. As Jorge is leaving, he is intercepted and arrested by the FBI. Later, Annalise wins her class action lawsuit. Laurel is sleeping on Bonnie's couch, having nightmares about her last conversation with her mother. She wakes up to hear the baby crying, but Bonnie is tending to him. Later on, Annalise arrives to see the baby and tells Laurel to go take a shower while she watches him. While taking off her clothes, Laurel looks at the scratches on her arms. (\"Nobody Else Is Dying\")\n\nSeason 5[]\n\nAfter discovering that it was her brother somehow involved in the murder of Nathaniel Lahey, Sr., Laurel and Annalise visit him in his hotel room. The conversation gets heated when Xavier tells them that he was doing it all for their family and for what Annalise had done to it, specifically sending their father, Jorge Castillo to prison. After failing to find eye to eye with her brother, Annalise and Laurel leave. On the street outside, Annalise gets a phone call but when she turns back around Laurel is gone. Annalise then calls Frank who confirms that Christopher is also gone. (\"Please Say No One Else Is Dead\")\n\nSeason 6[]\n\nLaurel unexpectedly FaceTime's her friends who suspected her of being the FBI mole. Laurel insists that she is innocent on Christopher's life, showing the others that she has her son with her. Though the group think she made a deal with the FBI to enter Witness Protection, Laurel claims that it was Tegan Price who helped her escape before hanging up. (\"Are You the Mole?\")\n\nAt the beginning of Annalise's trial, Laurel is brought in by the prosecution as a surprise witness to get Tegan discredited as Annalise's attorney. Laurel explains that she fled Philadelphia out of fear of what her family might do to her as they knew that she might testify against them at some point and Jorge had already tried to get custody of her son. Laurel states that she had chosen Tegan for help as Tegan had been a lawyer at her father's company when she had been kidnapped as a teenager and helped to negotiate her release. Lennox uses Tegan's relationship with Laurel - who is on the prosecution's witness list - and other key witnesses as proof of her conflict of interest. As Tegan argues with the judge and Lennox, Annalise speaks up and agrees to dismiss Tegan in favor of representing herself. Laurel exchanges several looks with Frank in the courtroom and then later Annalise, Frank and Bonnie from down the hall as she holds Christopher.\n\nWhile playing with Christopher, Laurel is found and confronted by an angry Michaela along with Connor and Oliver. Laurel explains that she is there to testify against Annalise like they are and the FBI found her because Asher told them about her phone call, allowing the FBI to ping her location in Brooklyn. Like the others, Lennox wants her to testify that Annalise ordered Sam's murder \"and the thing about Wes.\" Unlike the others, Laurel was able to negotiate for probation and as long as she never gets another felony, Christopher gets to stay with her.\n\nFrank later visits Laurel at her hotel and confronts her over her actions, specifically not telling him that she was going to run. Laurel admits that she misses Frank and sometimes wonders if she made the right choice by turning down his proposal. The two amicably discuss their former relationship and Frank praises Laurel's strength and the fact that she got out for Christopher. Frank asks Laurel not to testify against Annalise, but she refuses as it means giving up Christopher.\n\nAt night, Laurel is called to a secret meeting by Frank in a parking garage where Annalise joins them. Annalise reminds Laurel that she saved Christopher's life when he was born and the two argue over their roles in each others lives. Annalise reminds Laurel that her family was the one that killed Wes and then Nate Sr. Though Laurel agrees with going after them, she feels that she is doing what is right for her son, the only innocent person in all of this. Laurel is shocked to learn that Xavier tried to torture Frank to death, causing Laurel to hesitate but to still feel that she has no choice. Annalise insists that if she wins, it will be over as the FBI won't come after anyone else for this. Annalise states that if Laurel goes through with this, she will be no better than her father and Christopher will hate her much as Laurel hates Jorge. \"You decide who you want to be here. This is the moment,\" says Annalise. Laurel tells Annalise that she is a mother who will die to protect her child before walking away and telling Frank not to follow her.\n\nThe next morning, Laurel testifies against Annalise about the things that she has made the Keating 5 do for her. Lennox presses Laurel about the possibility that she has been brainwashed by Annalise who argues that neither Laurel nor Lennox are qualified to determine that. After Lennox states that manipulation, indoctrination, isolation and pathological lying are all straight out of a Psych 101 handbook, Laurel shocks the court by emotionally stating that they are also straight out of the FBI handbook too. Laurel admits to committing perjury on behalf of Agent Lanford because she was coerced by the FBI. Per US v. Gonzalez, her affidavit is thus void and Annalise and Wes were not sleeping together. Christopher is proof as he is Wes' son and Laurel blames herself for not seeing how mentally ill Wes was. Laurel apologizes to Annalise and insists that Wes committed the murder on his own.\n\nThat night, Michaela, furious at Laurel's actions, visits with Connor. Laurel admits that she didn't know she was going to help Annalise until she was on the stand, causing Michaela to declare her a coward and a bitch. When Connor asks if she feels bad that the judge now thinks that they perjured themselves, Laurel points out that they did. Laurel is unrepentant as they said things that would put Annalise in jail for life, but if Annalise deserves it, then they all do for agreeing to help cover up Sam's murder. Michaela blames Laurel for that too and reminds Laurel that she voided her deal and Christopher will grow up without a mother. Laurel insists that she only wanted to do the right thing and asks if Michaela isn't tired of pretending to be the kind of person who can lie and cheat and be okay with it. Though Michaela states that she is that person, Laurel is not and she wants to be a good person. Connor agrees, stating that it is why he took the deal and is shocked when Michaela reveals that she negotiated a deal for probation instead of jail time. Laurel gets a sudden news alert about the death of her brother and shows it to her friends. (\"Annalise Keating Is Dead\")\n\nMurders Committed[]\n\nJorge Castillo: Paid Tegan Price to arrange for Jorge to be stabbed in prison. (\"Stay\")\n\nTrivia[]\n\nLaurel's bio on the ABC website states that \"Laurel Castillo is a secret weapon in the making. A quiet, sensitive idealist who enrolled in law school to learn how to defend the less fortunate, Laurel manages to stay under the radar, making it easy for her fellow classmates to underestimate her. With a profound attention to detail and inventive mind, she's talented – and darker – than anyone realizes, including Annalise.\"[2]\n\nIn the original script for the \"Pilot\", her name was Laurel Wilding.[3]\n\nWhile it’s well-established now that Laurel is Latina, that wasn’t always the case. There was some discussion on how to best introduce the character. In an interview with ETOnline, Karla Souza stated, \"I think that’s exactly what Pete and I were going for with people not even knowing. When I was cast, Laurel wasn’t supposed to be Latin at all. Then when Pete and Shonda [Rhimes] had that conversation about making her Latin, it was very important to have that be something that ‘could or couldn’t be,’ that wouldn’t ‘make or break’ the character, that it wasn’t the label of the character. She just happened to be Latin, and we could find it out later on.” It was later revealed that the character is Latina and additionally has problems with her father.[4]\n\nWhen Laurel was kidnapped at age sixteen, her father refused to pay the ransom for her release. (Whether this was by choice or by force is unknown.) Laurel's release was eventually arranged with the help of Jorge's personal attorney Tegan Price. Years later, Tegan arranged for Jorge's murder at Laurel's behest.\n\nKarla Souza initially auditioned for the role of Michaela Pratt, then Rebecca Sutter before being asked by the show's creator Peter Nowalk to audition for the role of Laurel Castillo.[5]\n\nThe actress who portrays the character, Karla Souza, secretly gave birth to a baby girl on April 19, 2018. Just like her character, Souza also only told her close family and friends and eventually took to social media to announce that she had been secretly pregnant and had given birth.[6]\n\nThough initially not pregnant at the start of the season, Karla Souza wore a pregnancy prosthetic bump which got progressively larger and heavier over the course of the season.[7]\n\nLaurel Castillo is multilingual as she speaks at least 3 different languages fluently: Spanish, English, and French. (\"Best Christmas Ever\", \"He's a Bad Father\")\n\nRelationships[]\n\nKan: The two met at a bar that held university events. The two got talking and it turned into something more. Laurel began seeing him, though secretly still had feelings for Frank though refusing to act on them. One time, Laurel had sex with Kan to make herself stop thinking about Frank. Though this didn’t stop her and she and Frank started having sex. The sex was so frequent that Laurel actually forgot about Kan. When she confronted him about her ghosting him, he wasn’t happy with her, however, the two decided that they should give it another go. Though this didn’t last too long as she later revealed that the two had broken up.\n\nFrank Delfino: Their relationship starts out as mainly sexual in nature until the two decide that they want more. After falling out with Frank, Laurel ends up falling in love with Wes Gibbins after having sex with him. The two end things after this. After Wes's death, Laurel blams Frank for her pain and says she loved Wes more than she ever loved him. Following Wes’s death, Laurel uses Frank for sex. After much time, Frank mistakenly proposes to her which causes Laurel to understand that she doesn't have the same feelings for him and the two end things.\n\nWes Gibbins: Their liking for each other started while Laurel was still with Frank. It started out as a sexual encounter while on a mission to find out more information about Wes’s mother. It then progressed from there, though Laurel remained with Frank until his departure. Wes then got together with Meggy Traver. Wes ended it with Meggy after he realized that he wanted to be with Laurel. Though their relationship was short, the two developed strong feelings for one another and Laurel eventually told Wes she loved him. While in a relationship, a drunk Laurel ended up sleeping with Frank again, though instantly regretting it and nothing further came from it as she never told Wes. Wes sadly dies in a fire. In the same accident that killed Wes, Laurel was also hurt and taken to the hospital where she finds out she's pregnant. It was later revealed that Wes was the father to her son and she even named her son after him: Christopher Castillo. When Laurel finds out her mother was involved in Wes's death, she threatens to kill her because she hurt \"the person she loves the most.\" She also stated to her mother \"Now my son is going to grow up without a father for what so you could have more money\".\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason 1 \"Pilot\" \"It's All Her Fault\" \"Smile, or Go to Jail\" \"Let's Get to Scooping\" \"We're Not Friends\" \"Freakin' Whack-a-Mole\" \"He Deserved to Die\" \"He Has a Wife\" \"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\" \"Hello, Raskolnikov\" \"Best Christmas Ever\" \"She's a Murderer\"\n\n\"Mama's Here Now\" \"The Night Lila Died\" \"It's All My Fault\"\n\nSeason 2 \"It's Time to Move On\" \"She's Dying\" \"It's Called the Octopus\" \"Skanks Get Shanked\" \"Meet Bonnie\" \"Two Birds, One Millstone\" \"I Want You to Die\" \"Hi, I'm Philip\" \"What Did We Do?\" \"What Happened to You, Annalise?\" \"She Hates Us\" \"It's a Trap\"\n\n\"Something Bad Happened\" \"There's My Baby\" \"Anna Mae\"\n\nSeason 3 \"We're Good People Now\" \"There Are Worse Things Than Murder\" \"Always Bet Black\" \"Don't Tell Annalise\" \"It's About Frank\" \"Is Someone Really Dead?\" \"Call It Mother's Intuition\" \"No More Blood\" \"Who's Dead?\" \"We're Bad People\" \"Not Everything's About Annalise\" \"Go Cry Somewhere Else\"\n\n\"It's War\" \"He Made a Terrible Mistake\" \"Wes\"\n\nSeason 4 \"I'm Going Away\" \"I'm Not Her\" \"It's for the Greater Good\" \"Was She Ever Good at Her Job?\" \"I Love Her\" \"Stay Strong, Mama\" \"Nobody Roots for Goliath\" \"Live.
