        "text": "U.S. theatre organist (1893–1992)\n\nMusical artist\n\nDel Castillo (born Lloyd Gould Castillo,[a] April 2, 1893 – July 6, 1992), was an American cinema organist, theatre organist and composer, who provided music for radio series such as Stars over Hollywood,[2] Hollywood Theatre of Today,[11] and Satan's Waitin' ,[12] as well as a number of animated short subjects, including several featuring Mr. Magoo.[2] In addition, he served for several years as both program director and staff organist at WEEI (AM) in Boston.[13][14][15]\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nCastillo was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the only child of Dr. and Mrs. Frank Martin Castillo. Mrs. Castillo, the former Minnie May Gould, was herself an accomplished pianist and graduate of the Boston Conservatory of Music,[16][17] who also performed with Caroline Nichols' Fadettes of Boston.[18] She personally saw to Lloyd's early training, giving him piano lessons at age 4. Shortly thereafter he attended the Faelton Pianoforte School, and, by age nine, was performing in public.[19] He continued his studies at Rindge Manual Training School and later attended Harvard University, where he served for two years as conductor of the Pierian Sodality before graduating in 1914.[20][1][21][22]\n\nDaily News critic Ben Gross, in an otherwise dismissive review of the short-lived summer replacement radio series Satan's Waitin', wrote: \"The best part of it to this listener was the eerie, howling background music provided by Del Castillo, organist, and Dr. Samuel Hoffman, playing the theremin.\"[12]\n\nCastillo also founded a school for theatrical organists, the first such school in Boston.[2] Among his students was longtime Fenway Park and Boston Garden organist John Kiley.[23]\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nScarcely two months into Castillo's sophomore year at Harvard, The Boston Globe recounted, in rapid succession, the indictment, arrest and conviction of his father, Dr. Frank del Castillo, sentenced to three to five years in Massachusetts State Prison after \"plead[ing] guilty to an illegal operation involving Annie Gallagher Sept. 6.\"[24][25]\n\nFrom June 15, 1920, until her death on June 14, 1975, Castillo was married to Phyllis Arlene Woolley.\n\nOn July 6, 1992, Lloyd Castillo died in Los Angeles at age ninety-nine.[2]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
