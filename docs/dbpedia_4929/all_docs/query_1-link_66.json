        "text": "The Punched Quest for the Magical Puffco\n\nMonday October 18th, 8:00 PM Showtime / 7:30 PM Doors\n\nThe Punched Quest for the Magical Puffco featuring Brian Simpson, Frank Castillo and Rachel Wolfson. Presented by Punch Extracts, Raw, Puffco and Smoke.\n\nBrian Simpson is a stand-up comedian whose background as a foster child and Marine Corps veteran has led to a rare combination of life experiences that he manages to channel into a refreshingly unique point of view. Brian is a paid regular at The Comedy Store, has been named a New Face 2021 at the prestigious Just For Laughs Comedy Festival, and recently made his TV debut on Comedy Central’s Lights Out with David Spade. You can catch him next on Season 3 of The Standups on Netflix.\n\nFrank Castillo worked his way up to a paid regular at The Comedy Store. Frank became a staple of The Comedy Store Roast Battles, and in January of 2017, Frank became the Champion of Roast Battle II on Comedy Central. Frank can be seen in the Showtime documentary The Comedy Store, in Mike Binder’s upcoming feature Halfway To Amarillo, and most recently released his first album Lupe with Comedy Dynamics. He has two podcasts Buddies and Peak’d supported by Puffco, Punch extracts and Alienlabs.\n\nRachel Wolfson is a Los Angeles-based stand-up comedian. Born in Las Vegas, Nevada, Rachel began her comedy career in LA in 2016 and since then has toured the country with her brand of high humor. Wolfson’s comedic style is a hybrid of crowd work and the dry humor of her day-to-day life. You can see her in February 2022 in the fourth installment of the Jackass franchise Jackass Forever as a new cast member. Rachel also performs stand-up nightly so follow her on social media to catch a show.\n\nVIP Tickets Available!
