        "text": "Sister Stephanie was born in Massachusetts and is one of six children born to John and Patricia Flynn. She began her teaching career in Miami. At that time, she was a member of the Teresian Association, a lay Association. After visiting the Dominican Republic, Sister felt called to work with the Haitians in Miami. She began teaching at St. Mary Cathedral School in 1991 where she met the Sisters of St. Joseph. Drawn to the charism of the Sisters and sensing a strong call to consecrated life, she entered the Sisters of St. Joseph of St. Augustine on August 15, 1993. After completing her formation, Sister was missioned to Orlando (St. Charles) and then to St. James School in Miami where she was principal.\n\nSister holds a Master’s degree from St. Thomas University and a Specialist degree in Education from Barry University. She has served in Catholic Schools for over 35 years, having worked with the Haitian community for over 25 years. Sister serves on the Board of Trustees (Mercy Hospital, Miami). She serves as a Councilor on the Sisters of St. Joseph Leadership Team and as Canonical Treasurer of the Congregation.\n\nIn June 2022, Sister Suzan Foster retired from St. Joseph Academy after serving as a Catholic educator for 50 years in the State of Florida. A St. Augustine native, and St. Joseph Academy graduate, Sr. Suzie proclaimed her final vows in 1972. She then earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Florida in 1973, followed by a degree of Master of Religious Education from St. Meinrad School of Theology in 1979. After 5 years teaching in Catholic grade schools, her first secondary school assignment was Bishop Kenny High School in 1974. She remained as a faculty member and administrator there for 20 years until returning to her alma mater of St. Joseph Academy as Assistant Principal for the next 25 years.\n\nAlways eager and dedicated, Sr. Suzan enthusiastically joined the team at St. Joseph Neighborhood Center as Director of Programs in July 2022. Sr. Suzan is responsible for researching, planning, and implementing the organization’s educational programs while incorporating the Sisters of St. Joseph legendary charism, of ‘being the face of love’ to the young single mothers in the program.\n\nSister Suzie initiates program goals based on the strategic objectives of each Cohort member and allocates resources necessary to achieve those plans from start to finish. This includes giving emotional support, spiritual direction, tutoring, identifying obstacles, and implementing solutions to help these young single working mothers reach their career goals. She also serves as a Councilor on the Sisters of St. Joseph Leadership Team\n\nFrank Castillo joined the organization after more than six years as an executive in the non-profit sector in Northeast Florida and more than 25 years of financial and administrative experience in the private sector where he specialized in helping struggling and emerging companies in Silicon Valley and in Northern Florida succeed.\n\nHis commitment to the mission of the St. Joseph Neighborhood Center is rooted in his belief that we have a moral and ethical responsibility to empower young single mothers to achieve economic independence to help them thrive in work and life.\n\nCastillo currently serves as the Finance and Operations Administrator for the Sisters of St. Joseph of St. Augustine. He received a Bachelor of Science in Commerce from Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California. He also received a Master of Divinity from Reformed Theological Seminary in Oviedo, Florida.\n\nKristin Paul, a passionate advocate for empowering young single working mothers, serves as the Strategic and Operations Administrator for the St. Joseph Neighborhood Center. With a Master's Degree in Finance from the University of Alabama, Kristin combines her financial expertise with a heartfelt commitment to community service.\n\nKristin is also an award-winning author, addressing social issues that impact women. Her books extend beyond storytelling, creating a platform for dialogue and awareness surrounding the challenges faced by young women. She has spoken to numerous organizations about the difficulties young women experience.\n\nKristin looks forward to the St. Joseph Neighborhood Center's growth, envisioning it as a hub for support, driving positive change and impacting the lives of young single working mothers in the community."
