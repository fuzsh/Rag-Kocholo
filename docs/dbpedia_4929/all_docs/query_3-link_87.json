        "text": "PHOENIX — Authorities have recovered the body of former major league pitcher Frank Castillo after he apparently drowned at a lake northeast of Phoenix.\n\nMaricopa County sheriff’s officials say divers pulled the 44-year-old’s body out of Bartlett Lake on Monday afternoon.\n\nAdditional Photos\n\nIn this 2003 file photo, Boston Red Sox pitcher Frank Castillo pitches during Spring Training. Authorities say Castillo, 44, who had multiple stints with the Red Sox, was found dead in a lake northeast of Phoenix. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Baseball\n\nFamily members and friends say Castillo wasn’t a good swimmer, but he jumped off a pontoon boat Sunday afternoon for a swim and didn’t resurface.\n\nDivers searched for several hours before suspending the search until Monday.\n\nCastillo had an 82-104 record in 13 major league seasons. He pitched for the Chicago Cubs, Colorado, Detroit, Toronto, Boston and Florida from 1991 to 2005 before retiring and lived in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale.\n\nHe spent two separate stints with the Red Sox, from 2001-2002, as well as 2004. He most famously came within one pitch of a no-hitter in 1995, while pitching for the Cubs.\n\nDeputies do not believe alcohol was a factor in the drowning.\n\nThe Red Sox held a moment of silence for Castillo before Monday night’s game against Tampa Bay.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors."
