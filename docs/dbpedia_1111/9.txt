The Chantoozies

(Ally Fowler and EvE von Bibra) continue to wow audiences with their dynamic blend of pop and rock.

The last few years have seen âone of Australiaâs hottestÂ bandsâ release new singles, âBaby Itâs Youâ, and more recently âTake Me In Your Armsâ.

They have appeared on countless TV & radio shows and performed around the country. Often, as part of

the Gold FM concert series or a more recent highlight, The Big Red Bash, with Midnight OilÂ and Kasey Chambers.

Collectively and individually, The Chantoozies have contributed to Australiaâs rich music, film, television and theatre culture. They have a unique and entertaining energy that they bring to every show, singing a combination of their original songs, Wanna Be Up, Witch Queen of New Orleans, Kiss & Tell, Love the one youâre with, and some covers from various eras.

The girls reunited in 2006 for the national âCountdown Spectacularâ tour and have never looked back!
