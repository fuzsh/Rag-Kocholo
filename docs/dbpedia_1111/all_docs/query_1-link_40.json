Eckhart scholarship from 1830 to 1970 has seen major discoveries, editions, and critical studies. Beginning in the 1970s, there has been a renewed concern with Eckhart as a Lesemeister and Lebemeister. Eckhart’s works have been re-edited and unedited works have been critically edited and studied. Significant new monographs have been produced. Many themes from Eckhart have received scientific study and some general works of interpretation have been completed.1 The present volume is designed as a handbook on Eckhart, the first such work in English. It presents a critical review of some of the main philosophical and theological research on Eckhart from European and American scholarship for the period 1970–2011. The volume does not have as its goal the formal treatment of Eckhart as a “mystic”. As a result, some pertinent discussion of this topic in French-language research is not covered. Brief reference to the topic of mysticism is made here in this Preface. In the Epilogue, the issue of the modern German debate on Eckhart’s mysticism is addressed by one of the participants. Hence, much of the relevant literature on the “mysticism” of Eckhart is not discussed.2 The issue of Eckhart as a “mystic” is undoubtedly one about which we have\n\n1 See Kurt Flasch, Meister Eckhart: Philosoph des Christentums (Munich: 2010); Flasch, Meister Eckhart: Die Geburt der “Deutschen Mystik” aus dem Geist der arabischen Philosophie (Munich: 2006); Norbert Winkler, Meister Eckhart.

It is a very difficult topic and it needs separate treatment. This volume is divided into three parts and each part has a separate introduction. In the introduction to the first part, Professor Bernard McGinn places the volume in the context of modern Eckhart research and introduces the individual chapters of Part One. The first part of the volume includes a critical review of the evidence for Eckhart’s life and work, complete lists of the critically edited Latin works, a critical review of the status of the German works, an account of early Eckhart as a preacher and administrator, an account of some of his central philosophical and theological ideas, and reviews of Eckhart’s Greek, Arabic, and Jewish sources. Part Two is introduced by Professor Paul Dietrich. It deals with Eckhart as a Latin exegete, preacher in the vernacular, Eckhart’s concept of God, the major influence of Moses Maimonides on the later Eckhart, and Eckhart’s relation to the world of women’s spirituality. The third part is introduced by the editor, Jeremiah Hackett. It provides an account of the reception of Eckhart by his immediate contemporaries in Germany, the appropriation of Eckhart’s work by the 15th-century thinker Nicholas of Cusa, and by the 16th-century Lutheran pastor, Valentin Weigel. Comprehensive reviews of the reception of Eckhart in the age of German idealism and in 20th-Â�century philosophy are presented by experts in the fields of modern theology and philosophy. The Epilogue to the volume introduces the English-language reader to some modern issues concerning Eckhart’s “mysticism”. It is polemical in nature but it gives the English-language reader some sense from within the German debate on the nature of Eckhart’s “mysticism”. This is followed by Appendix 1, in which Professor Fr Walter Senner, OP, provides an overview of the structure of the Dominican education to which Eckhart was greatly indebted. This places the later life and work of Eckhart in the context of his earliest educational training. The central question that has arisen in modern German research on Eckhart is “Wer ist Meister Eckhart?” (“Who is Meister Eckhart?”). In the early 20th century, the assumption was that Eckhart should be seen as a much-respected preacher in German and Latin, and as a Latin commentator on Scripture who had been trained philosophically at Erfurt, Cologne, and at the University of Paris. It was also held that he resided and preached at Strasbourg in the period 1314–25. It has been a commonplace of the scholarship that Meister Eckhart was one of the great mystics in Western Christianity. Much work has been done on Eckhart as a mystic. And yet in the period 1960–2011, a great debate arose in Germany as to whether or not Eckhart should in fact be called a mystic.\n\npreface\n\nxxiii\n\nThe one-time editor of Eckhart’s Latin works, Heribert Fischer, argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a medieval theologian.3 He claimed that he was not a mystic. The philosopher Karl Albert had already argued that Eckhart needed to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism that began with Parmenides and that was redeveloped in Plato, Ploti nus, Porphyry, Proclus, and other Neoplatonic thinkers.4 A strong reaction to the use of the term “mysticism” with respect to Eckhart came from the so-called “Bochum school” of medieval philosophy, and especially from the pen of Kurt Flasch. He wrote about the need to free Meister Eckhart from the “Mystical flood”.5 In part, it can be seen that Flasch is writing against the background of modern New Age mysticism and all forms of emotional subjective mysticism. He spoke of the need to situate Eckhart in his own context—namely, that of a school trained philosophical theologian. Above all, Eckhart was to be seen as an original philosophical thinker who formulated his own philosophical-theological synthesis and who held that “the reasons of natural philosophy” were of great importance for understanding the text of the world and for written texts, especially the text of Sacred Scripture. Eckhart’s synthesis owed much to the Albertinian Neoplatonic tradition and other medieval Neoplatonic thinkers such as Bonaventure (c.1217–74), Thomas Aquinas (1225–74), and Henry of Ghent (1217–93). It can be claimed that he worked most closely with his confrère, Dietrich of Freiberg (c.1250–1310). While Eckhart was a keen reader and respecter of the work of both Thomas Aquinas and Dietrich of Freiberg, he did not feel bound to the task of verbatim repetition of their text and doctrine. Where appropriate, he offered an overcoming (aufhebung) of the work of Aquinas and Dietrich. It was the originality of Eckhart as a thinker that enabled him to draw creatively on the riches of the philosophical-theological past as he projected new questions and new answers. And it is precisely as a speculative thinker that Eckhart stands out among his contemporaries. Or, in the light of the major influence of Moses Maimonides on the hermeneutics of the later Eckhart, one could claim that he is an original hermeneutical thinker in the Latin tradition, one who transcends the traditional methodology. In this respect at least, 3 Heribert Fischer, “Zur Frage nach der Mystik in den Werken Meister Eckharts,” in La mystique rhénane (Paris: 1963), 109–32. See also Fischer, Meister Eckhart: Einführung in sein philosophisches Denken (Munich: 1974). 4 Karl Albert: see the Epilogue to the present volume and the select bibliography. 5 Kurt Flasch, “Meister Eckhart: Versuch, ihn aus dem mystischen Strom zu retten,” in Gnosis und Mystik in der Geschichte der Philosophie, ed. Peter Koslowski (Zurich: 1988), 94–110. See also the items in note 1 above.\n\nxxiv\n\npreface\n\nI believe that Karl Albert and Kurt Flasch are both correct: there can be no adequate interpretation of Eckhart without taking him seriously as a philosopher and especially one interested in natural philosophy and its application in theology. Further, Eckhart’s thinking cannot be separated from his own social Sitz im Leben and his radical answers to the issues of his own times in the context of the new urban environment, and the new urban centers of learning; namely, the universities and the houses of study of the religious orders. That concern, however, does not make him a modern Marxist. Further, those who would judge Eckhart as a kind of representative of a philosophy based on New Age mysticism completely miss the hard work of thinking from within the Western philosophical tradition that is central to Eckhart’s work.6 And those who compare Eckhart with Eastern mysticism need also to bear this in mind. My own preference is to see Eckhart as a scholastically trained rigorous thinker who was both a philosopher and a theologian. Was he a mystic? It all depends, of course, on what one means by that term “mystic”. Pauline mysticism is a quite distinct experience from the philosophical mysticism of the Platonici. Yet in a figure such as Augustine one finds a synthesis of Paul with the Platonici, that is, with the teaching of Plotinus and Porphyry and late ancient Latin writers who were influenced by Neoplatonism.7 Further, the presence of Augustine in Eckhart ought not be neglected.8 And here is the problem: Eckhart was a very profound reader of Augustine, Boethius, Eriugena, Anselm, and the School of Chartres. Thus, there is a significant Latin Neoplatonic influence on Eckhart, as there is a significant Greek Neoplatonic influence through Proclus, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Eriugena, the Greek fathers, the School of Chartres, and the Islamic and Jewish traditions. At the same time, he had a strong grasp of the new 13th-century Aristotelianism as mediated by Arabic and Jewish Aristotelianism.\n\n6 For Eckhart, the Western philosophical tradition includes the whole Western tradition—Greek, Hebrew, Islamic, and Latin. For him, there is a recognizable history of the development and universality of truth present in all of these traditions. 7 For a study of the uniting of Pauline and Platonic mysticism in Eckhart’s immediate contemporaries at Erfurt, Henry of Freimar (the Elder) and Jordan of Quedlinburg, see Jeremiah Hackett, “Augustinian Mysticism in Fourteenth-Century Germany: Henry of Freimar and Jordanus of Quedlinburg,” in Augustine: Mystic and Mystagogue, ed. Joseph Schnaubelt and Fredrick Van Fleteren, Collectanea Augustiniana 3 (New York: 1994), 439–56. 8 See Andreas Speer, “Weisheit bei Augustinus und Meister Eckhart,” in Weigand and Schiewer, Meister Eckhart und Augustinus, 1–16.\n\npreface\n\nxxv\n\nFurther, as will be seen in the present volume, we can now see that Eckhart was profoundly influenced by the major Jewish thinker, Moses Maimonides. The latter was many things, including teacher, doctor, lawyer, philosopher, Jewish theologian, and source of Jewish mysticism. This very deep influence on Meister Eckhart of Moses Maimonides, which has been known for some time, has received new study in recent times. It is also the case that he was greatly influenced by Solomon Ibn Gabirol (Avicebron) and by the two great Islamic thinkers, Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes). Naturally, much of the modern discussion of mysticism is affected by 19th-century philosophical attempts to interpret the various traditions of Western and Eastern mysticism. Early 19th-century discussions in the context of rationalism led to the classification of mysticism as “irrational”. One must acknowledge also that 20th-century German and American discussions of this problem have the work of Rudolf Otto and also perhaps William James in mind. Further, one must also be aware that the medieval tradition of the relation of mysticism and metaphysics is quite distinct and different from what is found in modernity. A failure to recognize this could lead to a gross confusion, and hence to a deformation of a thinker like Meister Eckhart. Mysticism and metaphysics in the Middle Ages had a correlative relationship. They cannot be contrasted, as is done by some modern thinkers, as an opposition between “rationality” and “irrationality”. The issue of mysticism has become very important in the context of inter-religious dialogue in the late 20th and early 21st century. Monotheistic religions such as the three religions of the book, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, exhibit significant mystical traditions. So too does the world of Greek and Latin philosophy. Indeed, there are elements of Indian tradition, as for example in Shankara, where one can recognize analogies with the thought of Meister Eckhart. This also arises in reference to Zen Buddhism. This reality points to the need for a very careful comparative study of the phenomenon of mysticism as found in Eckhart and in other major philosophical and religious traditions. The phenomenon of mysticism cannot be gotten around simply by claiming that Eckhart is not a mystic in the subjectivist, magical, New Age sense. And it cannot be dismissed as though it is some kind of “irrationality”. It must be confronted in the context of Eckhart’s own times and in the context of the various traditions that find a synthesis in Eckhart’s great works. Eckhart was a creative philosopher, a thoroughly rational theologian, and the propagator of a way of life intended to lead to close union of the human being with the Godhead. He was also a very down-to-earth person\n\nxxvi\n\npreface\n\nwho was very successful as an administrator. His ending was tragic and unfortunate, as he became a victim of organizational politics and ideological calumny. Yet, grounded in faith and natural philosophy, he bore his fate with a courageous thought-filled response to his inquisitors. Like his earlier philosophical-theological contemporaries at the University of Paris, Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, and like his model, Albert the Great, Eckhart suffered the opprobrium of theological inquisitors who did not appreciate the comprehensive scope of this new “scientific” theology or his distinctive “vernacularization” of Greek and Latin theology. They did not altogether understand his specific thought-forms, careful distinctions, and utter dedication to his life’s vocation. Even his contemporary, William of Ockham, while at Avignon, fell for the simplistic stereotyping of Eckhart’s distinctive philosophical terminology then fashionable among those who were educated. Of course, here one is confronted by the mediation of philosophy and theology in the very different institutionalized languages of distinct forms of interpretation, or distinct traditions, as Alasdair McIntyre would put it. This context of post-1277 and the “correctoria” controversies led to much mutual misunderstanding. Indeed, already by 1266, Roger Bacon, Ockham’s predecessor, was in full outcry against Albert (“he who made himself an authority” at Paris) and his great student, Aquinas.9 Was Meister Eckhart set up to be destroyed by morally compromised persons within his own Dominican order? The answer has to be yes. Was he personally a heretic? No, he was not by a long shot, and this was recognized even by the Avignon Inquisition, and has been acknowledged in modern times.10 Why then were 28 sentences from Meister Eckhart condemned? Perhaps the best answer to this problem has been suggested by Alain de Libera. He was condemned because church authorities saw his very complex and rich rhetoric and poetic as a source of theological confu-\n\n9 Jeremiah Hackett, “The Attitude of Roger Bacon to the Scientia of Albertus Magnus,” in Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays 1980, ed. James A. Weisheipl OP (Toronto: 1980), 53–72. 10 See the thesis of Dom David Knowles: “of his radical traditionalism and orthodoxy there is no longer any doubt”. See D.A. Knowles, “Denifle and Ehrle,” History 54 (1969), 4. This conclusion of Dom David Knowles can be compared with the more recent judgement by the learned scholar of medieval mysticism, Edmund Colledge, OSA. See Colledge, “Historical Data,” in Meister Eckhart: The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises, and Defense, ed. Edmund Colledge, OSA, and Bernard McGinn (Mahwah, N.J.: 1981), 3–23. Fr Colledge regards Eckhart’s teaching as open to the charge of heresy, if it is not, in fact, at least in part, heretical.\n\npreface\n\nxxvii\n\nsion for the “faithful”.11 But one might ask: who are the faithful? Of course, the term includes all Christian believers. Yet, are not those who have been trained to think theologically members of the “faithful”? Certainly, Eckhart’s own Dominican brothers and sisters and their lay auditors who were philosophically and theologically literate were able to interpret his teaching and preaching. They especially were the audience for Eckhart’s more philosophically nuanced preaching. However, there were other Dominicans who believed that any deviation from the ipsissima verba of Thomas Aquinas was theologically and philosophically suspect, notwithstanding the fact that “the things themselves” were what mattered for Aquinas. Ultimately, the political struggle between the papal monarchy and the monarchy of Emperor Louis of Bavaria provided the context in which the archbishop of Cologne demanded obedience from the Cologne Dominicans on behalf of the papal cause. This alone, however, was a necessary but not a sufficient background factor. The Clementine decrees of the Council of Vienne in 1311 had already targeted the phenomenon of lay spirituality in the Rhineland, especially the “Free Spirit” movement. Eckhart was not the first person to be brought before the Cologne diocesan Inquisition. It is my belief that modern study of both Aquinas and Eckhart will make explicit great commonality and also some significant difference between both thinkers. Indeed, modern scholars such as Alain de Libera have already pointed to the continued impact of the Parisian condemnations of 1270 and 1277 on the condemnation of Eckhart. Who was condemned in the trial of the Cologne Inquisition and in the papal bull In agro dominico? Was it Meister Eckhart alone or was it Eckhart, Aquinas, Dietrich of Freiberg, Nicholas of Strasbourg, and the whole Albertine Dominican tradition? The influence of the condemnations at Paris of 1277 was still a major factor, and the “orthodox” status of Aquinas, certainly in the eyes of the neo-Augustinian Franciscans, had not been accepted, notwithstanding the new acceptance of the orthodoxy of Aquinas at the papal court in Avignon. It is more than significant that Eckhart was rediscovered in the postKantian tradition of modern German idealism.12 This central tradition in modern philosophy led to the integration of Eckhart into modern philosophy\n\n11 Alain de Libera, “On Some Philosophical Aspects of Meister Eckhart’s Teaching,” Freiburger Zeitschrift für Philosophie und Theologie 45 (1998), 150–68. 12 See the chapters by Cyril O’Regan and Dermot Moran in the present volume.\n\nxxviii\n\npreface\n\nand to the development of modern Eckhart scholarship, especially of the German works of Eckhart. The rediscovery of the Latin works of Eckhart by Heinich S. Denifle, OP, led to the modern critical scholarship of the Latin works. The renewed critical study of Eckhart in the post–World War II context has allowed scholars to debunk some of the earlier myths of Eckhart scholarship. Certainly, the new work on Eckhart has opened up a veritable treasure chest. Until recently, the accident of rediscovery led to a bifurcated Eckhart, the “Protestant” Eckhart, as it were, of the German sermons and treatises, and the “Catholic” Eckhart of the Latin works. The very fact that material from Eckhart’s Latin works was used by the Cologne and Avignon inquisitors is enough to indicate the artificiality of this distinction. There was one Eckhart and he expressed his teaching in the philosophically rich technical Latin of the schools, and in his own rich expression of his teaching in Middle High German. The modern interest in Eckhart has come to be “popular”. This is not a bad thing. It means that people of all kinds of interest find a resonance in the work of Eckhart. Why should Eckhart be limited to the very intense and focused world of the scholars? Why should Eckhart’s thoughts not be communicated to the wider world? As will be evident from Part Three of the present volume, this popularization had already begun in Eckhart’s own times. It first began in the 14th century when Eckhart’s followers, both male and female, made a concerted effort to shield his works from the excesses of inquisitional book censorship. It happened first of all among his own Cologne and Erfurt Dominicans, but it also took place in a modified manner in the case of leading scholars among the German Fransciscans and Augustinians.13 Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the new Eckhart research is the discovery of the rich manuscript artwork based on Eckhart preserved by the Dominican sisters in St Katharinental. Just as there are as many “Middle Ages” as there are interpreters of the Middle Ages, so too there are as many “Meister Eckharts” as there are interpreters of Meister Eckhart. It was ever thus and it will ever be so in the future. The aim of the present volume is to open up the world of Eckhart research (c.1970s to the present time) to undergraduate and graduate students in the English-language world. It is a work in the service of scholar-\n\n13 See Nadia Bray’s chapter in the present volume. Marquard of Lindau, Jordan of Quedlinburg, and John Hiltalingen of Basel are representative. So, too, is Prosper of Reggio Emilia, who preserved reports of Eckhart’s Parisian lectures.\n\npreface\n\nxxix\n\nship. The ultimate aim is to read and understand the works of Meister Eckhart. The work of scholarship is a necessary task in the realization of that ultimate goal. Was Meister Eckhart a “mystic”, a theologian, a philosopher, a communicator, poet, administrator, or faithful Dominican? Why do his works have a resonance among very diverse peoples and traditions? Whatever the answer to these questions, it is clear that the study of Meister Eckhart has exhibited great creativity and development in the period 1970–2011. Many thanks are due to the editors of the works of Meister Eckhart, especially to Loris Sturlese and his colleagues in the study group at Lecce on Eckhart and Jordan of Quedlinburg. They provided the context for my return in 2002 to the study of Meister Eckhart, Henry of Freimar, and Jordan of Quedlinburg. Acknowledgement is also due to the Thomas-Institute at Cologne under the direction of Professor Jan Aertsen and Professor Andreas Speer. I am grateful for their hospitality. At an earlier stage, I was encouraged in this work by some fine teachers in Dublin and Toronto. They include Gabriel C. Daly, the late Denis Mason, Michael Richter, Patrick Masterson (philosophy of religion), Denys Turner (ethics), and the late F.X. Martin, Michael Bertram Crowe, Conor Martin, Edmund Colledge, Ludwig Bieler, Virginia Brown, and Armand A. Maurer. I learned much about Eckhart as a philosopher from Armand A. Maurer. He encouraged my interest in Eckhart. An important social impetus towards the study of Meister Eckhart in Dublin in 1973 came from fellow students Mr John Doyle, MA, Dr Cyril O’Regan, Mr William O. Shorten, MA, and Dr Josephine Russell. A word of thanks is also due to the Goethe-Institute Library in Dublin. Acknowledgement is due to the support given by the Interlibrary Loan section of the Thomas Cooper Library, University of South Carolina, and to Dean Thomas McNally and his colleagues. This kind of research could not be done without their great assistance. Thanks are due to Anne Bezuidenhout, Chair, Department of Philosophy, and to all my colleagues, and also to Stephanie Mitchem, Chair, Department of Religious Studies, and to all her colleagues. Both chairpersons facilitated an interdepartmental course on Meister Eckhart in spring 2010. Professor Heike Sefrin-Weis (philosophy and classics) was most helpful with one difficult chapter. I thank her for her general encouragement of the project. Dean Mary Anne Fitzpatrick, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and Provost Michael Amirides helped this work to completion by the award of sabbatical leave. I am grateful for this award during difficult times in academia.\n\nxxx\n\npreface\n\nI am especially thankful to my wife Lilla Hoefer. She has been a very great supporter of the work of the university and of scholarship. She has been especially supportive of my work on this Eckhart project. For editorial assistance with this work, I wish to thank Katherine Macedon. Thanks are also due to the following graduate and undergraduate students in philosophy and religious studies at the University of South Carolina: Craig E. Bacon, Caleb Colley, Brian Mesimer, and Michelle Panchuk. Their help with reviewing and with the indices was invaluable. They are skilled and dedicated students of ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. I also thank Mr Richard Layman, director at Layman Poupard Publishing, for some very helpful advice at a crucial stage in the edition. Thanks are also due to the editors at Brill Publishers for the invitation to edit this first handbook on Eckhart in English and to the translators chosen by Brill Publishers, namely, Brian McNeil and Ada Bronowski. Finally, I would like to dedicate this book to three people of remarkable virtue and dedication, my parents-in-law, the late Mr Herbert W. Hoefer and Mrs Lilla F. Hoefer of Columbia, South Carolina, and the late Mr John Madden, Portmarnock, Dublin, Ireland. All three gave essential witness in practice to the philosophical and theological vision that Eckhart proclaimed.\n\npart one\n\nINTRODUCTION TO PART ONE: A COMPANION TO MEISTER ECKHART Bernard McGinn The year 1937 saw the publication of the first volume of the great critical edition of the writings of Meister Eckhart: Meister Eckhart. Die deutÂ�schen und lateinischen Werke. Herausgegeben im Auftrag der Deutschen For­ schungsgemeinschaft. Over the following period of more than seven decades, interest in Eckhart has never vanished, though it has had its ups and downs, perhaps due more to historical crises like World War II than to shifts in scholarship. Recent decades have seen the appearance of two international societies dedicated to the study and dissemination of Eckhart: the Eckhart Society centered in England was founded in 1987 by the late Ursula Fleming, and the Meister-Eckhart-Gesellschaft located in Germany was founded in 2004 by Georg Steer and his associates. Both groups sponsor conferences, publish journals devoted to Eckhart, and (given the new situation in scholarship) have presences on the Web. The work of these societies, and, even more, the increasing flood of scholarship on Eckhart, are ample indications that fascination with the German Dominican is a growing phenomenon today and for the foreseeable future. In light of this increasing interest, and especially now that the critical edition is nearing completion, it is time to take stock of what we know about Eckhart and to present the main strands of current scholarship on a figure who was a philosopher as well as a theologian, a mystic as well as a preacher, and an administrator as well as an academic. Hence the timeliness of the appearance of A Companion to Meister Eckhart, ably edited by Jeremiah Hackett in Brill’s series, Brill’s Companions to the Christian Tradition. There are many Eckharts and a large literature has been devoted to this author who is as difficult as he is influential. Perhaps no single volume can hope to do justice to the whole of Eckhart. What Professor Hackett and his international team of noted Eckhart scholars have done is to give an expansive treatment of Eckhart the philosopher, though also touching on other important aspects of the Dominican’s accomplishments, such as his biblical exegesis, preaching, and relation to women’s spirituality. The major areas of concentration, therefore, are on the philosophical influences on\n\n4\n\nbernard mcginn\n\nEckhart, especially from Jewish and Arabic sources; treatments of many, though by no means all, of the main themes of his thought (God, transcendentals, analogy, anthropology, etc.); and studies of his influence both in the medieval and the modern periods. Part One concentrates on introducing Eckhart’s life and providing surveys of his Latin and German writings. It also includes treatments of some of Eckhart’s sources, as well as considerations of important aspects of his thought. In a long essay, Walter Senner, OP, who has already made many contributions to our knowledge of Eckhart and the German Dominicans of the 13th and 14th centuries, summarizes his long engagement with Eckhart in a detailed essay on “Eckhart’s Life, Training, Career, and Trial.” Father Senner has the advantage not only of his own unrivalled knowledge of the German Dominicans, but also the appearance of the critical edition of all the sources relating to Eckhart’s life in the Acta Eckhardiana, edited by Loris Sturlese and appearing in LW V between 1988 and 2006. Senner’s account provides the benchmark for all subsequent treatments of Eckhart’s life and times. What is perhaps most remarkable about the essay is its judicious caution about how little we know for sure about Eckhart’s life on the basis of precisely dated sources. Senner’s clarifications of: (1) what is certain about Eckhart’s life, (2) what is likely, and (3) what is mere supposition, will form a necessary bedrock for subsequent research on the medieval preacher. Also dealing in part with Eckhart’s life, but concentrating on his career as a Parisian academic and an administrator in the German provinces of the Dominican order, is Loris Sturlese’s essay, “Eckhart as Preacher, Administrator, and Master of the Sentences: From Erfurt to Paris and Back, 1294–1313. The Origins of the Opus tripartitum.” This penetrating essay presents a convincing account of Eckhart’s success as an administrator and the failure of his original philosophical and theological views to have much effect on the Parisian academic world. Sturlese argues that the genesis for much of Eckhart’s most profound teaching, as well as the beginnings of the unfinished Opus tripartitum, go back to the Dominican’s first period as teaching master (magister actu regens) in Paris between 1302 and 1303. A major task of a volume such as this Companion to Meister Eckhart is to provide readers with a solid and up-to-date analysis of the subject’s major writings. Hence the central role of the two important essays that follow in Part One by Alessandra Beccarisi, “Eckhart’s Latin Works,” and Dagmar Gottschall, “Eckhart’s German Works.” Professor Beccarisi’s entry gives a brilliant and often new analysis of the evolution of Eckhart’s aca-\n\nintroduction to part one\n\n5\n\ndemic works, tracing major developments in and between the two Paris teaching periods. Particularly important is her discussion of the differences between the first and the second commentaries on Genesis. Professor Gottschall takes up the complicated question of Eckhart’s vernacular works, both the sermons and the treatises. Gottschall discusses the different criteria employed for determining authenticity in the various projects for editing Eckhart, as well as the form of Eckhart’s texts. She also gives a detailed account of each of the vernacular works, including some select sermons. On the authenticity of the controversial treatise Von Abgeschie­ denheit, Gottschall maintains a prudent middle-of-the-road position that the tract might be by the Dominican himself, rather than a follower. The remaining essays in Part One turn to exploring some of Eckhart’s sources and various aspects of his philosophical teaching. Chronologically speaking, the earliest essay on sources is that of Eliza Rubino on “Eckhart and the Pseudo-Dionysius.” Rubino’s essay shows that contrary to what is often thought, Eckhart depended primarily on the De divinis nominibus in his use of Dionysius, citing the book 36 times, as compared to 12 citations for the De caelesti hierarchia and only five for the De mystica theologia. We are left wondering why the Dominican made so little use of the De mystica theologia. Alessandro Palazzo provides a thorough survey on “Eckhart’s Islamic and Jewish Sources: Avicenna, Avicebron, and Averroes” (Maimonides is treated in a later essay). In line with recent trends in scholarship, Palazzo stresses the importance of the Avicennan dimension in Eckhart’s thought. The essay is particularly insightful for showing how Eckhart used his sources for the most part to buttress positions that he had already worked out within the context of his own thinking. Finally, three other essays in Part One take up essential philosophicotheological themes in the Dominican’s teaching: transcendental terms; analogy; and anthropology. Eckhart’s long engagement with the transcendental terms (being, one, true, good) has elicited much literature over many decades and not a little disagreement. Tamar Tsopurashvili charts a path through this complex dimension of Eckhart’s thought, providing a number of new insights, especially with regard to the correlation of the ontological, henological, ethical, and epistemological levels of his thinking. Also central to Eckhart’s philosophy and its relation to theology is the role of analogy, once again a topic of frequent attention in both older and newer literature on Eckhart. Jeremiah Hackett and Jennifer Hart Weed show that it is only by seeing Eckhart’s view of analogy within the broader context of late 13th-century scholasticism that its inner character can emerge. Their essay, “From Aquinas to Eckhart on Analogy,”\n\n6\n\nbernard mcginn\n\ndemonstrates Eckhart’s use of, but also development beyond, Thomas’s teaching on analogy and provides a helpful survey of major discussions of this significant teaching. Eckhart’s doctrine of human nature is among the most important and controversial aspects of his teaching and preaching. A number of the articles condemned in John XXII’s bull In agro dominico reflect the more controversial themes of the Dominican’s anthropology. Udo Kern’s contribution, “Eckhart on Anthropology,” is a masterful and concise summary of a difficult but essential theme of the German Dominican. The value of the essays from Part One of the Brill A Companion to Meister Eckhart rests both in their success in introducing interested readers to one of the most important of medieval thinkers, as well as the way in which they serve to open up new avenues in future Eckhart research.\n\nMEISTER ECKHART’S LIFE, TRAINING, CAREER, AND TRIAL Walter Senner OP 1. Origins After more than 120 years of historical research we still lack a detailed knowledge of the life of Meister Eckhart. On the contrary, modern research has given rise to unfounded hypotheses and even to fantasies.1 The main reason for this is that most sources that could give us firsthand information have perished over the course of six centuries due to wars, fires, and the dissolution of monasteries. So only some fragments of the acts of the annual provincial chapters of the German Dominican provinces have been preserved. They contain decisions and dispositions including assignations for studies and for offices such as lector (teacher in a priory). Yet none of them contains anything on Meister Eckhart. The first certain biographical date we have for Meister Eckhart is from Easter (18 April) 1294, when, as lector Sententiarum, he preached a sermon in Paris.2 This gives us a secure date from which to infer the curriculum of studies that he had to pursue in order to reach this position. The position of lector Sententiarum at the theological faculty of the University of Paris— also called baccalaureus formatus—was a two-year teaching assignment 1 Secondo Bongiovanni, Gwendoline Jarczyk, Pierre-Jean Labarrière, and Benoît Vermander, L’anneau immobile: regards croisés sur Maître Eckhart (Paris: 2005), 11. For very informative and helpful conversations on the matter treated here in regard to the trial of Meister Eckhart I thank the late Prof. Winfried Trusen, who was the first scholar to give an account of Meister Eckhart’s trial based properly on expertise in the history of law. I also thank Prof. Loris Sturlese, Lecce, whose exemplary edition of the Acta Echardiana (note 2) provides the sources for a large part of this contribution. I cordially thank also my collaborators Hans Gonzalez for correcting my German-syntax-style English, and Barbara Bartocci and Dr Jana Ilnicka for reviewing the quotations and for checking the Latin. Dr Klaus Bernward Springer, Erfurt, has made useful comments especially on Thuringian and Erfurt history. Prof. Jeremiah Hackett, the editor of this volume, has revised the English style. 2 Acta Echardiana n. 4: Meister Eckhart, Lateinische Werke V (Stuttgart: 2006), 157; 136–48 (Meister Eckhart, Lateinische Werke will be abbreviated as LW).

This was the set handbook for systematic theology. The lector Sententiarum also assisted the magister in disputations. The task of lector was the decisive qualification for a theologian to advance to become a magister at this faculty himself—the most prestigious position in occidental theology.3 The Dominican order assigned only the most promising members to this office and only after they had already had a long teaching experience. As the Faculty of Theology at Paris had fixed the minimum age for promotion to the position of magister at the age of 35,4 it has commonly been assumed that Eckhart may have been born around 1260. This, however, is just a hypothesis, since it is possible that he was older when he was promoted, or even that he was a few years younger, as had been the case with Thomas Aquinas. In this chapter I will show that it is more probable to suppose that Eckhart had been born some years before 1260, perhaps in 1250 or even some years earlier. In any case, we cannot be sure of the year of his birth. A Paris university sermon on the Feast of St Augustine (28 August) or the translation of his relics (28 February) was reported “ab ore magistri Echardi de hochheim.”5 Heinrich Suso Denifle, who found this document and was the first to critically investigate the sources of Meister Eckhart’s life and work, inferred from this that Hochheim, according to medieval naming conventions, was his birthplace.6 Today there are several places with this name. Denifle found a document, where, in 1305, 19 May, Magister Eckardus attests to a donation made by the late “Dominus Eckhardus miles dictus de Hochheim” to the Cistercian nuns’ abbey of the Holy Cross at Gotha.7 He concluded from this that the Meister was a son of that knight and thus came from the village of Hochheim north of Gotha 3 Palémon Glorieux, “L’enseignement au moyen âge: techniques et méthodes en usage à la Faculté de Théologie de Paris au XIIIe siècle,” Archives d’histoire doctrinale et littéraire du moyen âge 43 (1968), 65–186, see 98–100 and 141.

As Koch admits, as a friar Eckhart would not have used a private seal. Further, he did not usually name himself “Eckhart de Hochheim.” This may have been due to the fact that his place of origin was relatively unknown, as Koch admits himself.12 In 1978 Erika Albrecht showed that family seals were not used in Thuringia during the period in question. Thus, the Dominican Eckhart would have been known to the public as the son of the knight, Eckhart de Â�Hochheim.13 Using other documents, she found that members of this family—a preferred first name seems to have been Eck(e)hard(us)—figured in documents from 1219 onwards. Albrecht comes to the following conclusions: “first the Hochheims were a family of Feudal Knights in the service of the Wangenheims; second they derived their name ‘von Hochheim’ from the village of Hochheim near Gotha, but [in the 14th century] did not consider it anymore as the place-name of their dwelling.”14 Their residence since the late 13th century was at Tambach on the northern fringe of the “Thüringerwald” mountains. The “von Hochheims” appear in some documents in close relation to the Cistercian (monks) abbey\n\n8 Ibid. 9 A nobleman in the service of a higher-ranking ruler.

So, according to Albrecht, it is not possible that a son from this village could have become a priest in the Dominican order.16 Considering the makeup of the population, and especially the one noble family from the other Thuringian Hochheim (today a suburb of Erfurt; during the Middle Ages it was one of the villages around Erfurt providing for the archiepiscopal kitchen “Küchendörfer”), it is unlikely that Meister Eckhart would have come from there.17 Winfried Trusen argues that Tambach or a castle near this village is the most likely birthplace.18 Recently, Albrecht’s findings have been doubted by Eckhart Trebel who holds that Hochheim near Gotha was the dwelling place of his family.19 In any case we can state with some certainty that Meister Eckhart was a member of a Thuringian family of feudal knights that lived to the west of Erfurt. Nicholas of Bibra’s poem, Occultus Erfordensis, provides a vivid description of Erfurt and of life in this city during the last decades of the 13th Â�century20—and not without some critical remarks about some of the clergy. Although the schools in that town are not explicitly mentioned,21 Nicholas speaks of the learned among the canons22 and of “a good thousand students,” whom he divides into the wicked, lazy, and docile.23 The Dominicans and Franciscans are praised and compared with the biblical Enoch and Elias for their pastoral zeal and doctrine.24 Around 15 Ibid., 31 sq. 16 Ibid., 33. 17 Ibid., 33 sq. 18 Trusen, Prozeß (see note 12 above), 14 sq. 19 See http://www.eckhart.de/index.htm?aktuell.

There were Dominican priories in Western Thuringia at Erfurt (1229), Eisenach (1236), Nordhausen (1286), and Mühlhausen (1291).27 Erfurt is closest to both Hochheim villages and to Tambach, whereas the Nordhausen and Mühlhausen priories had been founded at a time when Eckhart must have already been a Dominican for some years. Moreover, he was subsequently prior at Erfurt. So it seems likely that he entered this nearest, biggest, and most famous priory in the vicinity of his birthplace. However, although this is the received opinion, it is not necessarily a fact.28 Joseph Koch proposed that Eckhart could have been a student in the Faculty of Arts at Paris in 1277;29 it has even been inferred that he would have “entered the Dominican order at fifteen years of age” (in 1275).30 This implies that he would have been sent to Paris for study just a short time after his noviciate. This, however, was not the customary practice of the Dominican order. 2. Eckhart’s Training and Career31 The curricular requirements and the known practice of the Dominican order did not permit a friar to study for the master’s degree without a time in duties either as a lector or as a an administrator. When we apply this fact to Meister Eckhart’s life, we now arrive at the following minimum time: a period as novitiate of one year (not after 1278, and most probably 25 Sönke (see note 21 above), 72–77 and 87. 26 Ibid., 107–34. 27 Paulus von Loë, Statistisches über die Ordensprovinz Saxonia, (Quellen und Forschungen zur Geschichte des Dominikanerordens in Deutschland) 4 (Leipzig: 1910), 11 sq. 28 This was prematurely assumed, for example, by Kurt Ruh, Meister Eckhart, Theologe, Prediger, Mystiker (Munich: 1990), 20. That Gotha and its surroundings, including the more western Hochheim and Tambach, belonged to the termination district of Eisenach does not necessarily mean that Eckhart would have joined the Dominicans there. 29 See Koch (note 11 above), 253 sq. 30 Oliver Davies, “Later Medieval Mystics,” in The Medieval Theologians, ed. Gillian R. Evans (Malden, Mass.: 2001), 221–32, see 225. 31 For an account of Dominican education in general, see Walter Senner OP, Appendix 1 in the present volume.\n\n12\n\nwalter senner op\n\nbetween 1266 and 1269), which would have involved preparative instruction of Latin grammar, choir lessons and so on for one to two years; a period in the studium logicalium of two to three years and in the studium naturalium for two years; a period teaching logic for a minimum of two to three years; studium theologiae at a studium particulare for two or more years; teaching philosophia naturalis for two years (variant A) and teaching theology (Sentences) for at least two years (variant B) before teaching philosophia naturalis for two years; and a period of at least three years of studying theology at a studium generale (presumably Paris), and maybe acting as cursor for two or more years, followed by teaching or pastoral activity in Germany for at least two years, prior to being sent to Paris ad legendum Sententias. On the assumption that Eckhart would have entered the novitiate in 1278, this would mean he had spent just 16 years as a Dominican prior to going to Paris to attain the bachelor in theology degree. This presupposes that he would have advanced most expeditiously, remaining at no stage of his studies and in no office longer than the minimum time. It is more likely that he joined the Friars Preachers somewhat earlier. Coming as a 15-year-old boy he would have had to pass at least one year after the novitiate with preparative instruction; thus the latest year to be assumed for his birth is 1262. We do not know where and when Eckhart entered the order, performed the different stages of his studies, or which offices he held or for how long. It is even possible that he had been sent to Paris for studies some time before 1294 to read the Sentences. According to Koch’s hypothesis, he would have studied the arts in Paris around 1277.32 However, this hypothesis is not sufficiently justified. Meister Eckhart speaks in his defense in 1327 of “our times” when referring to the fact that “Paris masters of theology had the mandate from superior to examine the books of the most famous men Saint Thomas Aquinas and brother Albert the bishop as suspect and erroneous.”33 This does not necessarily imply that he himself was present in Paris at that time. Therefore the conjecture by the editor 32 See “Kritische Studien” (note 11 above), 252–54. 33 “Maxime cum iam pridem magistri theologiae Parisius nostris temporibus mandatum habuerint superioris de examinandis libris praeclarissimorum virorum sancti Thomae de Aquino et domini fratris Alberti tamquam suspectis et erroneis.” Acta Echardiana (note 2 above), n. 77, LW V, 276, 2–4. The English translation, available in Meister Eckhart: the Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises, and Defence, ed. Edmund Colledge and Bernard McGinn, The Classics of Western Spirituality (Mahwah, N.J.: 1981), 72, is not precise; they give “in my own lifetime” for “nostris temporibus.”\n\nmeister eckhart’s life, training, career, and trial\n\n13\n\nof the Acta Echardiana that Eckhart may have been in Paris around 1286 “when also the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas and Albert the Great were examined by a commission of theologians”34 is far from certain, although it is possible. In the Bibliotheca Amploniana, Erfurt, Ms. 321,35 one finds a collection of five principia in libros Sententiarum. The second principium is identified by a hand somewhat later than that of the scribe as “echardus pro principio: collacio in libros sententiarum.”36 Joseph Koch convincingly argued that this Principium is an authentic work by Eckhart.37 He dated it “in one of the years from 1297 to 1300.”38 However, he did so on the assumption that a Dominican would have remained at the University of Paris from the beginning of his time as baccalaureus sententiarius until at least his graduation as magister. As the university sermon on St Augustine shows 34 Acta Echardiana (note 2 above), n. 2, LW V, 155 sq. 35 Fol. 93ra–va as part of a collection of 5 principia, fol. 92va–92vb. In Wilhelm Schum, Beschreibendes Verzeichnis der Amplonianischen Handschriften-Sammlung zu Erfurt (Berlin: 1887), 222 sq., the work is described erroneously as “Sermones de Genes. c. 2, v. 10. . . .” See the more detailed description by Joseph Koch in Meister Eckhart: Die lateinischen Werke, V, 1 (Stuttgart: 1936), 3–5. Koch recognized that this manuscript consists of two parts bound together later on (see p. 3), he supposes a Dominican origin of the second part (see p. 5 sq.), although there is not sufficient evidence for this. The manuscript as a whole was given to the Collegium Portae coeli by its former alumnus magister Nicolaus Geylfuys de Spira in 1445 (Schum, note 35 above, 222); on the issue see also Loris Sturlese: “Meister Eckhart in der Bibliotheca Amploniana: Neues zur Datierung des ‘Opus tripartitum,’ ” first published in Die Bibliotheca Amploniana: ihre Bedeutung im Spannungsfeld von Aristotelismus, Nominalismus und Humanismus, ed.

It was once thought that the manuscript Bruges, Stadsbibliotheek, Ms. 491, contained Meister Eckhart’s Commentary on the Sentences: see Joseph Koch, “Ein neuer Eckhart-Fund: der Sentenzenkommentar,” Forschungen und Fortschritte 10 (1943), 20–23, enlarged reprint in Koch, Kleine Schriften 1 (Rome: 1973), 239–46. Indeed, there are some quotations ascribed to Eckhart, but it is rather a miscellaneous collection of commentaries by different authors, cf. Wouter Goris and Martin Pickavé, “Die Lectura Thomasina des Guilelmus Petri de Godino (ca. 1260–1336): ein Beitrag zur Text- und Überlieferungsgeschichte,” Roma magistra mundi (FS Leonard E. Boyle), vol. 3, ed. Jacqueline Hamesse (Louvain-la-Neuve: 1998), 83–109, see 95–108. The enigma of this manuscript, however, is not yet solved, see Walter Senner, Johannes von Sterngassen OP und sein Sentenzenkommentar, vol. 1 (Quellen und Forschungen zur Geschichte des Dominikanerordens) 4 (Berlin: 1995), 1, 180, and 355. 38 Koch (note 35 above), 8.

During this time Johannes de Ardenburgo40 was regent master of the French Dominican chair; Johannes Jordani Romanus41 probably held the chair for Dominicans from other provinces, whereas Johannes Quidort42 was baccalaureus of the French chair; William Peter Godin from the provincia Provinciae, who was Meister Eckhart’s successor (1304–06) after his first Paris regency and whom Eckhart would later meet as a cardinal at Avignon, was a student.43 Possibly of some importance for Eckhart was the Augustinian, Master James of Viterbo. In his first Quodlibet there are three arguments added on the margin of one manuscript and ascribed to “Eckardus.”44 In a letter by Stephanus de Bisuntio, master of the Dominican order, permission is given to the “bachelario Parisiensi” stipulating that after he would have received the license in the Faculty of Theology he could take a socius of his own choice from his Teutonia province. As the editor Heinrich Finke already supposed, this is to be connected to Dietrich of Freiberg,45 who was promoted to magister in the fall of 1296.46 39 See above note 2. 40 Thomas Kaeppeli, Scriptores Ordinis Praedicatorum Medii Aevi, vol. 1–4 (Rome: 1970– 1993), (hereafter SOP), see vol. 2, 376; Palémon Glorieux, Répertoire des maîtres en théologie de Paris au XIII e siècle, no. 44, vol. 1, Études de philosophie médiévale 17 (Paris: 1933), 161. Bernardus Guidonis has him as number 42 in his list of Dominican Magistri in theologia Parisius, but for the period in question this cannot be considered a precise chronological order: see Stephanus de Salanhaco and Bernardus Guidonis, De quatuor in quibus Deus Praedicatorum ordinem insignivit, ed.

This was so because the whole Teutonia province was far too big to enable the provincial to visit the different priories frequently. There is a general agreement in Eckhart research that this was after he lectured as baccalaureus Sententiarium in Paris. He was installed by the then provincial Dietrich of Freiberg (who held this office between 1293 and 1296) as his vicar for the natio Thuringiae.49 Once again, and while this assumption is not unlikely, it is simply a conjecture. Since, in 1298, the accumulation of the offices of prior conventus—elected by the local community and expected to be present there, and vicarius, delegated by the provincial prior and obliged to travel frequently between the different priories and (if there were any) the nuns’ monasteries—was forbidden by the general chapter,50 this year is generally assumed as terminus ante quem of one of those two offices. Indeed, it is a valid assumption. Yet in the strict sense, it might even have been some time earlier. Thus we can claim that some time prior to his going to Paris for graduation as a magister, Eckhart was prior of the Erfurt Dominicans.\n\n47 DW V, 185–376.

Flasch, Meister Eckhart (note 38 above), 71 is certain on this point, stating that in “1294 Eckhart came from Paris [to Erfurt].” Heribert Fischer, Meister Eckhart: Einführung in sein philosophisches Denken (Freiburg: 1974), 13, erroneously supposes that Eckhard would have been installed into both offices, prior and vicar, by Dietrich of Freiberg—a Dominican conventual prior is elected by the local community. 50 “Ne conventus per diutinam priorum absenciam debito regimine defraudentur, volumus et ordinamus, quod iidem priores non fiant vicarii vel inquisitores, nec alia eis committantur officia, per que oporteat eos a suis conventibus absentare.

From the list of Parisian Dominican masters by Bernard Gui, it can be established that Meister Eckhart was promoted to master of theology in 1302.51 Bernard wrote this in 1307—sufficiently near to the reported event.52 By comparison with the principia of the baccalaurei Sententiarum, no specific period was prescribed. Thus, we cannot be sure at what point during the academic year this took place. It may have been in the fall. Raimundus Romani de Marologio, who is named directly after him by Bernard Gui, graduated and was master of the chair for the provincia Franciae in 1302 shortly after he had been elected provincial, and it seems that he continued his lectures until the end of the term.53 As regent master, Eckhart had to lecture on a book of the Bible each academic year, to preside and determine disputations, and to preach. The first two of the Quaestiones Parisienses and a question by the Franciscan Master Gonsalvus Hispanus with arguments by Meister Eckhart can certainly be attributed to this first Paris regency.54 A recently discovered fragment of a question is most likely from this period as well.55 There is some evidence that the first Commentary on Genesis (at least the beginning), the Commentary on Ecclesiasticus, and perhaps the Commentary on the Book of Wisdom are from the first Paris magisterium—or even earlier, as Eckhart\n\n51 “Fr. Aychardus Theutonicus fuit licentiatus anno domini MCCCII. Hic fuit confirmatus in priorem provincialem Saxonie in generali capitulo Tholosano, anno domini MCCCIV.” Magistri (note 40 above), no. 51, 131, 6–8. 52 Magistri (note 40 above), the introduction by Thomas Kaeppeli contains rich but scattered information (pp. VI–XVIII & XXI–XXIV & XXIX–XXXI & XXXVII) on the successive stages of the elaboration of this work, begun by Stephanus de Salanhaco (†1291), and continued and enlarged by Bernard Gui. 53 “Fr. Raymundus Romani de Marologio oriundus, licentiatus anno domini MCCCII; erat autem tunc prior provincialis Francie legitque prior provincialis existens.” Magistri (note 40 above), no. 52, 131.9–11; see SOP (note 40 above), 3, 287; Glorieux, Répertoire (note 40), no. 58: 1, 185. 54 Found by Martin Grabmann, Neuaufgefundene Quaestionen Meister Eckharts und ihre Stellung in seinem geistigen Entwicklungsgange: Untersuchungen und Texte, (Abhandlungen der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, philos.-philol. u. histor.) 32, 7 (Munich: 1927)—this edition is cited in the current chapter; reprinted in Grabmann, Gesammelte Akademieabhandlungen, vol. 1, (Veröffentlichungen des Grabmann-Institutes) NS 25, 1 (Paderborn: 1979), 261–381 (also contains the original page numbers); 101–11; Magistri Eckardi Opera latina, fasc. 13 ed.

The sermon on St Augustine “Vas auri solidum” (a solid vessel of gold) has at its conclusion an explicit that states: “This sermon is in this way reported from the mouth of Master Echard de Hochheim, on the day of St Augustine, at Paris.”57 Thus, 28 August 1302, and 28 February 1303, are the possible dates. The dating of the Opus tripartitum, the first draft of which is estimated by Sturlese with convincing arguments as quite some time before Eckhart’s second Parisian regency, is somewhat enigmatic in view of the attribution of esse (being) to God in contradiction of the second (chronologically first) Parisian question.58 During Meister Eckhart’s first Parisian regency, there was the already mentioned Raimundus Romani de Marologio in the French Dominicans’ chair. Remigius Clari de Girolamis (de Florentia) was promoted on order of Pope Boniface VIII, but he seems not to have exercised the office.59 Romeus de Brugaria from Catalonia was probably Meister Eckhart’s baccalaureus at that time.60 Besides the Franciscan Master Â�Gonsalvus Hispanus,61 56 Both Ruh (note 28 above), 29, and Flasch (note 38 above), 99, view Eckhart’s scriptural commentaries too readily as products of his university teaching only; Sturlese (note 35 above), 103 sq. is more cautious. 57 “Iste sermo sic est reportatus ab ore magistri Echardi de Hochheim, die beati Augustini, Parisius” LW V, 99, 5 sq.; see the opening pages of this chapter. The sermon is contained in Erfurt, Bibliotheca Amploniana, Ms. Fol. 36, 2nd guard-leaf (from early 14th century). See the introduction by Bernhard Geyer (note 54 above), 87 sq.; Schum (note 35 above), 29 sq.; Sturlese (note 35 above), 97 sq.; the manuscript would merit a more detailed description.

There is no evidence in CUP. However, we have found that in this year there is a papal order to promote Johannes de Capella OCist: CUP (note 5), no. 629, 2, 98 sq.; in the following year, still during the pontifical sanctions against the University of Paris, Pope Benedict XI gave at the Lateran the licence to Alexander Bonino de Alexandria OFM, who afterwards taught at Paris from 1304 to 1308/9: CUP (note 5), no. 639, 2, 105 sq.; see Glorieux, Répertoire (note 40), no. 340, 2, 199. 60 SOP (note 40), 3, 333; Magistri (note 40), no. 56, 132.4–7; Glorieux, Répertoire (note 40), no. 62, 1, 196. 61 Fr Gonsalvi Hispani, Quaestiones disputatae et de Quodlibet, ed.

The normal regency period of Dominican masters was three years, but on 26 June 1303, that is to say just three days before the end of his first academic year as magister regens, Meister Eckhart was not among the Dominican friars who were forced by the French king, Philip IV, the Fair (1268–1314, king since 1285) under the threat of expulsion from the kingdom to adhere to an appeal directed to a general council against Pope Boniface VIII.65 At first glance this allows for two different interpretations: first, Eckhart did refuse to adhere and therefore had to leave France immediately, or second, before the end of the term (Feast of St Peter and Paul, 29 June), he went back to Germany during the summer, and this would have nothing to do with the royal demand. Although we do not have documentary evidence on Meister Eckhart’s attitude towards King Philip the Fair’s injunction, a careful study by William Courtenay shows that the action with the Dominicans at SaintJacques (26 June 1303)—from which we have only a list of those who signed—mu"
