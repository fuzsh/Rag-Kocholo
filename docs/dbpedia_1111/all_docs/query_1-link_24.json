D., Clinical Professor of Medicine in the University of Pennsyivauia. REPORTED BT DR. LOUIS STARR. Hydrotiiorax Complicating Cardiac Disease. Gentlemen : — You -will remember that in the last lecture your attention was called to a case of simple pleuritic effusion. Now the next case that will be brought before you is one of long standing heart disease, which has lately bean complicated by the addition of dropsy of the left pleural sac. Her history is as follows : Case ii. Mary McG,. set. 30 years ; was ad- mitted to the Philadelphia Hospital on August 12th, 1874. She has always been temperate in her habits : and has been married for sis years, but has never had any children. Her health was good until the age of fifteen, when she began to suffer from palpitation of the heart ; this was most marked on exertion, and con- tinued to occur at intervals until last spring, when, being deserted by her husband, she was thrown upon her own resources and obliged to work hard ; the increased exertion thus required brought on more persistent palpitation, together with occasional attacks of shortness of breath and faintness. Early in May dropsy was added to the other symptoms ; this began in the feet and gradually extended upward, involving the thighs and abdomen. When admitted she was quite pale and weak, her urine was scanty and high colored, but not albuminous her legs, from the feet up, were 1 cedematous, and there was slight ascites ; the impulse of the heart was strong and diffused, and the pulse was 100 per minute 5 there was also some cough with the expectoration of blood- tinged mucus, and at times small quantities of pure blood ; physical examination revealed nothing abnormal in connection with the lungs, except that there were numerous mucous rales at the base of the right lung posteriorly. She was ordered five grains of iodide of potassium and ten drops of tincture of digitalis four times daily. Her general condition, however, re- mained the same until August 30th. From that time the dyspnoea increased stead- ily, and at present (September 16) it is so great that she is unable to lie down in bed. Upon directing our attention to her chest, the respira- tory movements are found to be confined almost entirely to the right side, and on percussion, flatness and diminished elasticity are observed to extend over the left lung, from base to apex. Over the upper part of this lung also the respira- tory murmur is distant and feeble, while over its lower two-thirds there is total abolition of respi- ratory murmur and vocal fremitus. The left side of the chest is distended, the intercostal spaces prominent, and the heart markedly displaced to the right, as the point of chief cardiac impulse is situated below and to the right of the ziphoid cartilage. In the prsecordial region there is a decided projection of the ribs and costal cartil- ages, and in this position, likewise, indistinct pulsation can be felt. When a stethoscope is placed over the heart a moderately loud, soft systolic murmur is heard at the ziphoid cartil- age, and when the instrument is moved upward another murmur, diastolic in time, is audible at 2 Lecture, [Vol. xxxii. the aortic cartilage ; this murmur is transmitted feebly to the right of the sternum, and more strongly downward and to the left, its position of greatest intensity being an inch and a quar- ter to the left of the sternum. The pulse is frequent and small. She is still very weak and anasmic, and there is considerable cedema of the legs. Bearing in mind these symptoms and physical signs, there can be no doubt that there is a large accumulation of fluid in the left pleural cavity. This has come on insidiously, without any of the usual signs of pleurisy, and it is associated with disease, both of the aortic and mitral valves. It is difficult to determine in such cases whether the elfusion has occurred as a mere passive dropsy, from venous congestion, or whether there has been a latent, subacute pleurisy set up, from some unknown cause. In either case, there is but small chance of securing its absorp- tion, owing to the serious heart disease which is also present. The urgent dyspnoea and disturb- ance of circulation render it important that im- mediate relief should be afforded. I will, there- fore, as you see, puncture the chest with a small trocar, in the seventh interspace, in the line of the anterior border of the axilla, after having frozen the skin and made a short incision through the derm. The fluid which immediate- ly escapes is unusually dark, and evidently con- tains a large admixture of blood. It is evident that no vessel has been wounded in the opera- tion, and we must therefore regard the presence ■ of the blood as due to the rupture of capillaries in the pleural membrane, from extreme over-dis- tention. [The operation was concluded without any < difficulty, the fluid withdrawn amounted to forty-two fluid ounces, and remained dark 'Colored to the end. The patient experienced , some relief from the operation ; but there was no material reduction in the dulness on percus- . sion, so that it was evident that there was still a large amount of fluid in the chest which could not be evacuated. Iler dyspnoea soon grew as severe as previously, attended with marked prostration. The urine grew scanty, mild de- lirium supervened, and continued until death - occurred from exhaustion, on September 24th, -eight days after the operation. At the post-mortem examination, which was made fourteen hours after death, rigor mortis •was well marked. The wound caused by the insertion of the aspirator needle was covered by a scab, and when this was removed a drop or two of pus escaped. On opening the thorax, no wound of the intercostal vessels nor any evidence of acute inflammation of the costal pleura at the position of puncture could be detected. The left lung was carnified and forced backward and. inward toward the spine, and between the pul- monary and costal pleurae numerous bands of organized lymph extended, dividing the pleural cavity into sacs of various sizes. These sacs contained in all sixty-seven ounces of clear, light yellow fluid ; none of them were as large as, that into which the aspirator needle had been passed, and the majority of them held only a few ounces of liquid 5 there was no reaccumula- tion in the sac that had been tapped. Both layers of the pleura were thickened, and at a point corresponding to the angle of the scapula, | the lung was bound firmly to the chest wall. [ Scattered through the substance of the left! lung were several patches of apoplectic effusion ; these were situated superficially, and caused slight bulgings of the surface ; they varied from one-half to one inch in diameter, were wedge- shaped or oval, and presented different appear- ances on section, some being red in color a.ndi quite firm, others pale and partly softened, while in one place the clot had become completely broken down, leaving a small cavity, one-third of an inch in diameter, filled with unhealthy pus. The right lung was large, heavy and congested, but was entirely free from thrombi. The peri- cardium was healthy, containing only a small quantity of light colored fluid, and the heart was displaced to the right, the apex being directly under the sternum. The heart was greatly enlarged, weighing eighteen ounces, the left ventricle was hypertrophied, and the left auricle much dilated, and its walls somewhat' hypertrophied ; two of the leaflets of the aortic valve were fused and partly reversed ; the mitral orifice was much contracted, scarcely ad- mitting the extremity of the little finger, and the auricular surface of the leaflets was covered with thick fibrinous vegetations ; the endocar- dium lining the left auricle was thickened, and patches of atheroma were found in the thoracic aorta ; the right ventricle was moderately hypertrophied, and the right auricle was dilated, though the pulmonary and tricuspid valves were healthy. The right and left cavities of the heart contained both old and recent clots, and the muscular tissue was soft and fatty. The kidneys were contracted and granular, the cortex jjan. 2, 1875.J Communications. / 3 being reduced almost one-half in thickness. The liver and spleen were much congested.] Remarks (September 30th). In considering the very interesting results of this post-mortem ' examin«ation, I would ask your attention to the , extreme contraction of the mitral valve, one of \\ the less common forms of valvular lesion, and , the one which is most frequently associated , with pulmonary apoplexy, as was the case in ^ our patient. In the second place, it is interesting to deter- ^ mine the cause of the pleurisy with extensive effusion. The latent manner in which this effu- ^ sion came on suggested the erroneous idea that it was not due to pleurisy, but was merely a form of passive, internal dropsy, connected with the obstructive disease of the heart. She had been exposed to none of the usual causes of pleurisy, and the case presented none of the usual symp- toms of an acute attack of this affection. I am inclined, therefore, to think that it arose, as I we frequently meet with it, in connection with the organic disease of the kidneys. The peculiar sacculated arrangement of the exudation is also worthy of note. This variety is not very common. In cases where a collec- tion of fluid of moderate quantity is encysted in a sac formed of false membrane in a pleural cavity, it is often possible to detect its peculiar arrangement by observing, that as the fluid is not free to move, the line of percussion dulness does not vary in changing the position of the patient's body. But when, as in the present case, the pleural sac is completely distended with effusion, it is impossible to determine whether the fluid is contained in numerous h sacs or is free in the general cavity of the I pleura. In the former event the operation of T paracentesis can only afford partial relief by emptying one or two of the sacs, and it was in this way that the operation in the present case was not productive of more complete relief. It illustrates well the great diagnostic value of puncturing the chest in cases of pleural effu- sion ; and also the fact, that even when, owing to unusual arrangement of the effusion, its com- plete evacuation is impossible, this operation, when properly performed, is productive of no injury whatever. ♦♦«Bm..» — Two physicians of Boston were tried last week, before the Massachusetts Medical Society, for practicing homoeopathy.

Contributed to the Meigs & Mason Acadeiny of Medicine, of Ohio, and requested to be publislied in the Medical, and Surgicad Reportek. BY CHARLES K. MILLS, M. D , Of Philadelphia, Correspondinsr Member; Assistant Phvsician to the Episcopal Hospital ; Chief of the Dispensary for Nervous Diseases, University Hospital. It has frequently been asserted that the cheap preparations of cinchona have little or no value ; that they are simply waste material worked up to sell. It seems to me that it is a matter of no importance whether or not these substances are made from the refuse of other processes. It is sufficient for practitioners of medicine to know that they have been distinctly isolated, and have stood the test of experiment. These preparations are cinchonia or cincho- nine, quinidia or quinidine, cinchonidia or cin- chonidine ; the sulphates of these alkaloids re- spectively, and chinoidine or quinoidine. Cinchonia was discovered by Pelletier and Caventon, in 1820 ; quinidia, by Henry and Delondre, in 1833 ; cinchonidia, by Winckler, in 1845. These alkaloids can be distinguished from each other, and from quinia, by various physi- cal and chemical tests, of which I will mention a few. The phenomena of circular polarization pS- ford one of the best means of discrimination. Certain substances have the property of rotating the plane of vibration in a ray of polarized light. When this rotation follows the direction of the moving hands of a watch, the medium is said to have a right-handed polarization when it takes the opposite course, it has a left-handed polarization. Works on physics contain de- scriptions of the instruments and processes em- ployed in this method of analysis. Arago dis- covered this property of circular or rotary po- larization in rock-crystal 5 and Biot and others have observed the same power in many organic solutions. Quinia and cinchonidia possess the property of left-handed rotatory polarization ; wliiie the polarization of cinchonia and quinidia is right- handed. Cinchonia crystallizes better than quinia ; and the latter is more soluble in water than the former. Quinidia is isomeric with quinia. It is somewhat less bitter than the chief alkaloid. Cinchonidia is isomeric with 4 Communicatwns. [Vol. xxxii. cinchonia, bearing the same relation to it that quinidia does to quinia. When the sulphate of quinia is treated first with a solution of chlo- rine, and afterwards with ammonia, it gives a \"beautiful emerald- green color. The sulphate of quinidia affords a similar reaction, except in concentrated solutions, in which a precipitate is formed, which is not* the case with quinine (Herapath). If sulphate of cinchonia be treated in the same way, a white precipitate will be thrown down. With an aqueous solution of sulphate of einchonidia, ammonia and caustic alkalies, and their carbonates and bicarbonates, CAuse white precipitates (Leer, Yfinckler). Chinoidine or quinoidine is a brown resinous mass, which is obtained in the manufacture of quinine and cinchonine ; some of that which occurs in commerce is simply the residue left after evaporating the mother-liquors of the sul- phate of quinia. It is sometimes called amor- phous quinia. It is said to bear the same rela- tion to ordinary quinine that uncrystalline does to crystalline sugar. Sertiirner (1829) is re- garded as the discoverer of this substance. He first announced its basic nature, and distin- guished it from quinia and cinchonia as a pecu- liar uncrystallizable base. Some authorities iSpeak of two kinds of chinoidine ; one contain- ing quinidia, with smaller quantities of quinia, cinchonia, and resin ; and the other consisting chiefiy of uncrystallizable transformation pro- ducts of the cinchona bases. With the sulphate of einchonidia, and chinoi- dine, I have recently had considerable experi- ence. During the months of May and June of the present year (1874) I used both prepara- tions largely at the medical dispensary of the Episcopal Hospital. I have also employed the sulphate of einchonidia in private practice, and chinoidine at St. Mary's Hospital. The prepa- rations were obtained from Powers &Weightman. I have a record of forty-eight cases treated with the sulphate of einchonidia, and of forty-five in which chinoidine was prescribed. Of these ninety-three cases, three-fourths were heard from at least once, and many reported during periods of from one to three weeks. In almost every case speedy benefit was derived. In nearly all the malarial cases, the chills were arrested after from twelve to twenty grains of either the einchonidia salt or the chinoidine had been administered. The sulphate of einchonidia was generally given dissolved in water by the addition of a few drops of aromatic sulphuric acid. At first, sixteen grains were ordered daily, with direc- tions to gradually decrease the amount after a few days. Four grains were usually given at one dose. Chinoidine was usually administered in a liquid preparation, and in most cases in the same amount as the sulphate of einchonidia ; namely, at first, sixteen grains daily, diminish- ing the quantity gradually. Whenever pos- sible, sixteen grajns were ordered to be taken before the time of the next expected paroxysm. The cases given will afibrd a proper understand- \\ ing of the method of using the remedies. Both preparations may, of course, be administered in pill form. I have sometimes employed \" com- pressed pills \" of sulphate of einchonidia in private practice. , ' In regard to the cases seen at the dispensaries, it is well known that many difficulties are met with when trying to get at the results of treat- ment, chiefly from the fact that patients will often fail to return and report. By strong urging, however, by holding out various in- ducements, and by even sometimes visiting the patients at their homes, I succeeded in obtaining satisfactory results. In cases amenable to cure, the non-return of a patient to whom medicine has been given at a dispensary, may be takeUi as prima facie proof of the efficacy of the treat-| ment ordered ; but, as will be seen, I have not depended on such negative evidence. I append, in slight detail, a few of the many cases of which I have notes. For the sake of brevity, I have confined myself to the facts necessary to show the effects of treatment with the remedies under consideration. Sulphate of Cinchonidia. Case 1. Tertian.— C. M., set. 25 ; mud digger on Petty's Island, in the Delaware river, came for treatment May 4th. Had ma- larial fever twice before within a year, which had been broken by chinoidine prescribed at the hospital. Had been suffering with chills of the tertian type, off and on, for two months. Had a violent chill the day before coming under obser- vation. Was ordered sulphate of cinchonidia, sixteen grains daily, which was reduced to twelve grains at the end of one week, and to eight gra^ins at the expiration of two weeks. During three weeks, for which time he remained under notice, the chills did not return. A large number of patients from the same locality aa this man have been successfully treated at the Dispensary service of the Episcopal Hospital, Jan. 2, 1875.J Communications, 5 some with chinoidine, and others with the sul- phate of cinchonidia. Case 2. Tertian.— J. K,, ost. 22 ; weaver ; living near brick-ponds ; came for treatment May 8th. About one year before had intermit- tent fever for a few days. Stated that on May 4th he had headache, slight chill, and fever; . on the 6 th had a severe paroxysm towards night. Was ordered sulphate of cinchonidia, sixteen grains, to be taken before evening, and the same amount daily for three days, when it was decreased to eight grains daily. Up to May 15th, when he ceased to report, he had no return of chills. Case 3. Tertian. — M. A., get. 38 ; operative ; was under observation for two weeks, from May 12th to the 26th; had been subject to ter- tian intermittent for two years. Had a severe chill on the day he applied for treatment. Took sulphate of cinchonidia, sixteen grains, for two days, twelve grains for five, and eight grains for the remainder of the time. Had a slight chill on the second day after beginning the medicine, and a \" creep \" two days later, but no subsequent trouble. Case 4. Quotidian.— J. P. W., £Bt. 29 ; car- penter ; was first seen May 18th. Two days before had a chill in the evening, and another the next day. \"Was placed on the sulphate of cinchonidia, sixteen grains, daily, until the 2 2d ; twelve grains from the 22d to the 25th ; and eight grains thereafter. Had no recurrence of chills. Ten days under observation. Case 5. Tertian.— J. H., jEt. 11 •, lived in a damp house near the Delaware, and came under observation May 21st. Ten days before had first chill, and one every other day since, the paroxysms geting worse each time. Headache every day. Was quite well before this attack. \"Was given sulphate of cinchonidia, eight grains, daily. Had a moderate chill on the second day and another severe one two days later. Said that he took his medicine regularly. Increased the daily quantity to twelve grains, which was continued for three days, and then diminished to eight grains. Had no chill from May 25th to June 4th. Case 6. Tertian. — L. K., set. 24; had inter- mittent fever seven months before he was first under observation. Was cured in four weeks. Was again taken with chills four days before coming to the Hospital, May 29th. Was given sulphate of cinchonidia sixteen grains for four days, and then twelve grains. Had slight fever on the day he began with the medicine, and headache at two subsequent periods ; but es- caped all symptoms from this time until ten days later, when last seen. Case 7. Quotidian. — M. C, set. 4; had fever every evening for five days before she was brought to the Hospital. Lived in a malarial district. Was ordered sulphate of cinchonidia, four grains daily. Was under observation from June 3d to June 9th, during which time she took the cinchonidia salt, and had no fever. Case 8. Tertian. — K. M., set. 20 ; came to the clinic June 10th, About ten months before had in- termittent fever, which was treated successfully at the Hospital. Three weeks before the 10th the chills had returned. Had an attack nearly every other day since. Was ordered sulphate of cinchonidia, sixteen grains daily for four days, and then twelve grains. Had no re- currence of chills to June 18th, after which he did not report. Case 9. Quotidian. — T. D., set 62; laborer; applied for treatment June 15th. Had malarial fever during the fall of the previous year. For two weeks before coming to the clinic had chill and fever of varying intensity every day. Had a severe chill while at the Hospital. Took sul- phate of cinchonidia, sixteen grains daily, for a week, after which be was not seen. Had slight chill on the 16 th, and none after, daring the week. Case 10. Quotidian. — C. M., a3t. 22 ; single ; had been sick for twelve days before coming for treatment, June 25th. Had a severe chill every afternoon for three days before the 25th. Was ordered sulphate of cinchonidia, sixteen grains daily, which he took until the 30th, when last seen, and up to which time he had no return of chills. Besides cases of malaria, like those just enu- merated, I have also used the sulphate of cin- chonidia successfully in bad cases of peHodical headache. In diarrhoea dependent upon gene- ral relaxation of the system, the same alkaloid has proved one of the most valuable of remedies in my hands. Chinoidine. Case 1, Quotidian. — P. M., set. 45 ; laborer ; came under observation May 4th. Had chills two days in succession before applying for treatment. The attacks would commence early in the evening, the fever lasting nearly all night. Was ordered chinoidine, sixteen grains daily. Took ten grains before the time for 6 Communications. [Vol. xxxii. chill the first day. Reported for one week, dur- ing which time he had no return of malarial symptoms. Case 2. Quotidian. — J. H., set. 40 ; machinist 5 came under observation May 8th. About one year before this date had chills and fever. The present attack began six weeks before he was first seen by me ; and he had been ordered chinoidine, which he took pretty regularly for about a month, but had not had any for two weeks. On the 7th had a dumb chill followed by fever. Had dull pain in the head. At first was ordered sulphate of cinchonidia, sixteen grains daily ; but of this he only took three or four doses, because of some whim, or^isunder- standing, and stayed away from the clinic for several days. On the 10th had a violent chill, which was succeeded by a fever which con- tinued for more than a day. Had headache, noises in the head, and pain in the back and limbs. TV\"as placed upon chinoidine, sixteen grains daily, with directions to reduce the amount to twelve grains at the end of a week. Was l&,8t heard from May 25th, up to which date he had no recurrence of attacks. Case 3. Tertian.— M. Y. E., set. 5 ; had chills and fever the year previous to coming for treat- ment, May loth.
