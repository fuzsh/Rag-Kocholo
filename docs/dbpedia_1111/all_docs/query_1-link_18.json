AUSTIN BIRON BIDWELL (27), GEORGE MACDONNELL (28), GEORGE BIDWELL (34), and EDWIN NOYES HILLS (29), were indicted for feloniously forging a Bill of Exchange for 1,000l., with intent to defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. Second Count, for uttering the same. Other Counts varying the mode of charge.\n\nMR. H. S. GIFFARD, Q.C., MR. WATKIN WILLIAMS, Q.C., MESSRS. POLAND, H.D. GREENE, and J.H. CRAWFORD conducted the Prosecution; MR. MCINTYRE, Q.C., with MR. MOODY, defended Austin Biron Bidwell; MR. POWELL, Q.C., with MR. BESLEY, defended Macdonnell; MR. METCALFE, Q.C., with MR. STRAIGHT, defended George Bidwell; and MR. RIBTON, with MR. HOLLINGS, defended Hills.\n\nJOSEPH JAMES CHASE. I am a clerk to Messrs. Freshfields, the solicitors to the Bank of England—on 12th August I served a notice to produce upon the prisoners personally in Newgate, and also upon Mr. Howell, the attorney for the two Bidwells and Noyes, and upon Mr. Wontner, the attorney for Macdonnell, at their respective offices—I produce the original notice—on 16th August I served a further notice in the same way.\n\nEDWARD HAMILTON GREEN. I am a tailor and army clothier, carrying on business, in partnership with my son, at 35, Savile Row—I know the prisoner Austin Bidwell by the name of Warren, and Macdonnell by the name of Swift—I recollect their calling upon me in April, I believe about the 18th, with another person, to order some clothes—it is my practice, when persons call to order clothes, to ask them to sign a book, which I produce—the two prisoners signed theirs, Austin Bidwell as F. A. Warren, and Macdonnell as Edward R. Swift, both of 21, Enfield Road, Haggerstone; the third person, I believe, did not sign, I don't recollect him; he was introduced by the name of Siebert—I made them a considerable quautity of clothes—on the 4th of May the same two prisoners called again in a cab, and I think with a third party, but that I won't swear—they tried on the clothes I had made for them—we entered into conversation, and I understood them to say they were going to visit Ireland; they did not say when; they had a eab at the door, with luggage on it, and they said they were in a hurry to catch the train; I understood that they were going to Birmingham first, then to Liverpool, and from Liverpool to Ireland—in the course of conversation Austin Bidwell said he had more money than he thought it prudent to leave at his lodging or hotel—I said \"Is it of any amount?\"—he said \"Yes, it is some amount\"—I think he said about 2,000l.—that being the case, I declined to take charge of it, and said \"I should recommend you to deposit it with some bank; my banker's is close at hand\"—he said \"We have very little time to spare, we are in a hurry to get a train\"—I said \"It will not take you long; I can take you down there\"—I then accompanied him to the Western Branch of the Bank of England, where I kept an account—I saw Mr. Fenwick, the sub-manager—Mr. Pimm was the manager at that time, he was then absent—I introduced Austin Bidwell to Mr. Fenwick, describing him as an American gentleman and a customer of mine, and that he had a certain sum of money that he wished to deposit—I think I mentioned his name as Warren—he was alone with me—the signature-book was then brought for him to write his name and address—I think Mr. Fenwick asked how he was to be described, and he said as an agent, I think—he handed the money to Mr. Fenwick—I think I was present when he signed the book—Mr. Fenwick gave him a chequebook—he said that more money would be remitted to him in the course of a week, I think 1,000I., and how should he manage, should it come through me—Mr. Fenwick replied that there was no occasion for that now, as he had opened the account there was no occasion to trouble me—we then returned to Savile Row, and the three parties left in the cab; at all events, Austin Bidwell and Macdonnell did—I fancy I saw them afterwards two or three times at our place of business—I sent the clothes to the address they gave—the first order went to Enfield Road, Haggerstone.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. I cannot, without referring, tell when it was that I first saw Austin Bidwell, it was in April, at all events, when he gave the order for the clothes; he was measured at that time—on 4th May he came to try them on—his name was put in my book before the 4th May; we made the entry from his dictation; here is his signature, which he wrote himself, \"F. A. Warren, 21, Enfield Road, Haggerstone\"—there is no date put—I cannot tell you when that signature was written—the first time he came he was in company with Macdonnell; I won't swear that there was anyone else at that time, or on 4th May, but I fancy there was; yes, I think there was—there was more than one person with him when he came on 4th May, and when we came back from the bank there was more than one person waiting for him—when I was examined before I don't think I mentioned any other person but Swift as waiting for him—I don't think I suggested to him to put the money in my bank—he wanted to leave it with me, and I suggested that I should not like to have so much money left with me, and he had better put it into the bank—I introduced the name of the banker to him—I told him that the bank was in Burlington Gardens, close by, and then he said he would go with me to the bank—the principal part of the money he handed over was bank notes—he gave the same name at the bank that he had given to me—I had seen him more than once before the 4th May.\n\nRe-examined. The date of the first order was on 18th April.\n\nEDWARD ELLIOT GREEN. I am in partnership with my father, the last witness—I recognise the prisoners Austin Bidwell and Macdonnell—I was present when they called and ordered clothes, in April, 1872—there was a third person with them who I never saw afterwards—I should think I might say that I saw Austin Bidwell and Macdonnell at Savile Row nearly twenty times—I am perfectly certain they are the persons—the third person gave no name or address.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. I saw them on 4th May; I saw Austin Bidwell and Macdonnell, and to the best of my belief a third person, another third person.\n\nRe-examined. I have no belief as to who that third person was.\n\nROBERT FENWICK. I am now, and was in May last year, the sub agent of the Bank of England at the Western Branch in Burlington Gardens—Mr. Green was a customer of oars at that time— \"I recollect his coming to the Bank on 4th May with a strange person; it was the prisoner Austin Bidwell—he was introduced by Mr. Green as Mr. Warren, an American gentleman, who had a considerable amount of money which he wanted taken care of—I inquired of Austin Bidwell his name, and he said \"Warren\"—the signature-book was produced, this is it, and he wrote this \"F. A. Warren\"—I asked him to write his name in full, and he then wrote \"Frederick Albert Warren\"—they are both here—he gave his address \"Golden Cross Hotel\"—he wrote that himself—I asked him how I should describe him; he did not give me an answer exactly at once; he then gave me to understand that he was over here on business—I can't remember his exact words—he said he had acted more as an agent for others than for himself—I said \"Then shall I describe you as a commission agent?\" and he said \"Yes\"—I entered his description in our ledger—he opened the account with a sum of 1, 200l.—I gave him a cheque-book—the numbers in it were Q R 16, 501 to 16, 550, to bearer—this credit-slip was made out at the time; I wrote it in his presence—I said a pass-book should be prepared for him, and be ready when he called—I believe he afterwards called for it—he said he should have more money to pay in, and he asked me if it must come through Mr. Green—I told him that was not necessary—after that I did not transact much business with him myself—I remember seeing him on 17th January this year, at the Bank, in the agent's room—Colonel Francis, the agent and manager, was there at the time—after a little conversation about various incidental matters, he threw down this bill of Rothschild's for 4, 500l. on the agent's table, and said \"There, I suppose that is good enough paper for you\"—he spoke on that occasion about his business, about sleeping cars; he said that he hoped to see the sleeping-cars introduced shortly abroad, so that our English tourists might use them in going to the Exhibition at Vienna—he also stated that he had the choice of three different factories at Birmingham, and that he was going there at once, and he hoped to commence business by the 1st February—he mentioned also a patent break, and also a signal light for placing in front of the engines—when he put down the bill, he asked to have it discounted—Colonel Fraser acceded to his request—that was a genuine bill, and was subsequently paid—his account continued at the Bank until 1st March—I think his passbook was sent to him once before that; we never received it back—when it was sent to him it contained all the paid cheques up to the date of making up the pass-book, as is our custom—we have some credit-slips here made out in his handwriting, between May and August, 1872—it is the practice for a customer to sign when he receives a cheque-book—Warren received two cheque-books; he received the second on 3rd January—that was one hundred cheques, payable to order, Nos. Q Q 82, 801 to 82, 900—I have the cheque signature-book here, with his signature, \"F. A. Warren\" on both occasions, 4th May, 1872, and 3rd January, 1873—we put down the letters and numbers of the cheque in the book.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. When he was first introduced to me he mentioned his address as the Golden Cross Hotel as well as wrote it—I have that book here—these are my initials, to certify that I saw him write it—I did not make inquiries at the Golden Cross—I wrote out the first credit-slip; it is amongst these—it is all my writing—Bank of England notes, 1,000l., coin 3l., drafts, cheques, &c., 197l.;\" that was one cheque on the Continental Bank for 197l.—that was the amount he paid in on that day—I next received money from him on 13th May—I did not myself see him write these credit slips—they are paid in over the counter in the ordinary way of business—I am speaking to them from the knowledge I have of his handwriting, from seeing him write his signature in the book—I saw him write in the stamped cheque-book on the same occasion, on 4th May—this second column is not for the address; it is in case it is given to some other person than has an account—I was not present when these credit-slips were handed in with the accounts—I can't exactly say whether I saw him in June last year—I do not recollect his speaking to me in June about closing his account at our bank; I don't recollect it at all—to the best of my belief he did not; I am not aware that he ever spoke to me on that subject—I will swear that he did not speak to me about closing his account during last year, nor did I advise him not to close it—I never remember his speaking to me about closing it—it is such a common thing for persons to say that when their balance is low, but I don't remember it at all—his balance was low at the end of May—I did not see him write this other signature in our signature-book—the Golden Cross is the only address he gave us—I did not give him the pass-book myself—I am not sure that it is known exactly who gave it to him—the first time it was sent on by post to Birmingham—I did not send it; it was sent by the passbook clerk.\n\nCross-examined by MR. RIBTON. On the 3rd of January, 1873, we gave him the second cheque-book—he then had a balance of 3, 600l.—it was on the 17th of January that the genuine bill was offered for discount—including the discounted bill for 4, 580l., his balance was then about 3, 800l.—on the same day he drew out 1, 500l. by a cheque payable to self—the balance of 3, 800l. was after he had drawn that out at the close of the day—after 17th January, the first bills offered for discount were three on the 22nd of January, amounting to 4, 250l.—we received them by post—those are alleged to be some of the forged bills.\n\nPEREGRINE MADGWICK FRANCIS. I am the agent at the Western Branch of the Bank of England in Burlington Gardens—I entered upon my duties as agent on the 3rd of June, 1872—I was afterwards absent on leave from the 27th of July to the 28th August—up to that time I had not seen the customer named Warren—I first saw him there on the 3rd of September, it was the prisoner Austin Biron Bidwell—he brought some Portuguese bonds, and asked me to take care of them for him, the nominal value of them was 8,000l.—Mr. Fenwick introduced him to me as Mr. Warren—he sat down in my room—in the course of conversation he told me generally what he had come over to England for; he said that he had come over to introduce sundry American inventions, first and foremost among which was the sleeping oars, and some other inventions, but that was the principal one—he also spoke about a steam break, and I asked him some particulars about it which he declined to tell me, as it was a secret—he said he hoped to have the cars running on the line between Paris and Vienna, so that all the visitors at the forthcoming Exhibition might make use of them, and that no country in future would be able to do without them; that he hoped afterwards to introduce a Company for the same purpose into England, and that then he hoped to have a good account at the Branch—but I understood him to say that at that time he was simply wishing to introduce them on this foreign line, from Paris to Vienna—he said he was going to work at Birmingham—I don't think anything more was said about Birmingham at that time; that was the substance of the conversation— \"he told me that he came from America, and there was no doubt of it—the sleeping ears are American cars—I undertook to take charge of the 8,000l. Portuguese bonds for him, and filled up one of our forms and he signed it in my presence—this is it—it is simply a request to hold, it is an office voucher for us, he signed it in my presence: \"London, 3rd September, 1872. The cashiers of the Bank receive and hold the undermentioned securities amounting to 8,000l. on account of F. A. Warren. Securities, 43 Portuguese 3 per cent, amount 8,000.\"—on 4th of September I saw him again, he brought some more 3 per cent Portuguese bonds, 4,000l. nominal value—he said that he wished to have the whole sold, and he fixed a limit upon them, 41 3/4 I think it was.—I undertook to sell them for him—I wrote out one of our usual requests and he signed it in my presence; \"4th September, 1872. To the agent of the Bank of England, Western Branch. Sir, please sell 12,000 Portuguese 3 per cent., at a limit of 41 3/4 per cent. 12,000l. F. A. Warren. \"Those were ordered to be sold for the account—that was near the market-price at that time, it was a very close calculation—on the 9th of September I saw him again—the account days are in the middle and end of the month—he called on me on the 9th, before the account day—he asked me to give him an advance of 2,000l. on those bonds—I do not remember that he mentioned why he wanted it—I made him the advance from that date up to the account day, up to the time of the sale—he signed this paper in my presence: \"London, 9th, September, 1872. To the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. I request that you will advance to me at the rate of 4 1/2 per cent, per annum, the sum of 2,000l., upon the undermentioned securities, which advance I engage to repay on the 13th instant. Signed, F. A. Warren. Portuguese 3 per cent, bonds, 12,000l.; and in case the said security should not be redeemed at the above period, I hereby authorise you to sell the same and repay the advance thereon. \"This is filled up in my own handwiting, it is quite in the ordinary form—it was signed by him in my presence and he was credited with the 2,000l.—the bonds were sold and realised 5,025l., that went to his account on 14th September—I did not see him at all times that he came into the bank, it was not necessary, but I certainly saw him on the 29th of November, and I may have seen him on the 26th—he then brought me two bills on Suse and Sibeth, for 500l. each, and asked me if I would discount them for him—these are the two bills, they are drawn by Isidore Hess and accepted Suse and Sibeth, dated the 31st of October, 1872, at three months, drawn at Ferrara, payable in London—they were due on the 3rd February and were paid—he asked me whether I would discount these bills for him—I said I must inquire about them first and see—I took them down to the City and got permission to discount them for him—they were discounted on the 29th of November—I saw Austin Bidwell on that day—I am not sure whether he brought those bills in on the 26th or 29th—they might have been discounted after he left—I did not see him after I had been to the City about them—he said he might ask us to discount a few more bills of the same character—these bills for 500l. each were discounted, and the amount, less discount, was placed to his credit—they were due on the 3rd of February and were paid in due course—I saw him again on the 23rd of December—he then told me he was going to Birmingham about his workshops, and so on, and would send us a few bills of the same stamp as those we had had from Birmingham—I think I gave him to understand that I would wait till I saw the bills—he then left, and on the 30th, which was Monday, I think I received this letter from him, dated the 28th of December, which contained a memorandum of these ten bills (produced) which agreed with the memorandum sent with the letter—(Read: \"28th December, 1872. To Col. P. M. Francis, Bank of England, Western Branch. Sir—Enclosed I hand you bills for discount as per accompanying memorandum, will you please to place the bills to my account and oblige yours faithfull.\n\nF. A. WARREN. P.S. I have been delaying to send you these bills in expectation of the lowering of the rate; however as I have given cheques to day overdrawing my account, you will please place this to my credit.\") (The bills enclosed amounted to 4, 307l. 4s. 6d.) Those were all genuine bilk, I discounted them and they were all paid at maturity—the proceeds of the discount was put to Warren's account, and I did not see him again till some time in January, the 17th I think, but I am not quite sure whether I saw him on the 6th, I think I did—the balance standing to his credit at the end of the year was 3, 604l. 13s. 3d.—on the 17th of January I saw him in my own room, he brought a bill with rather a flourish, put it down on the table in an off-hand sort of a way, and said \"There, I suppose that will be good enough paper for you\"—it was on Rothschild'sfor 4, 500l.—I looked at it, saw that it was genuine, and discounted it for him—up to that time, including that bill and the two bills in November, I discounted genuine bills for him to the amount of 9, 807l. 3s. 6d.—in the list of bills I discounted to the end of December there is an acceptance by Mr. Gillman, and the next time I saw Warren I said that we had made enquiries about that bill and we did not want to have a larger amount upon that acceptor; the bill was a good bill, but the bank held sufficient on that acceptor—it was not an objection to Mr. Gillman—it was a Manchester bill—our rule is not always to take London bills, the bank holds from various parties—after that we never got another acceptance of Mr. Gillman's sent to us—after we had discounted Rothschild's bill on 17th January, the account was partly drawn against, and on the night of 21st January the balance standing to Warren's account was 47l. 4s. 6d.—on that night I noticed that Austin Bidwell looked exceedingly ill, and he told me he had had a bad fall from his horse; he did not tell me how it occurred—that was the last time I saw him till he was in custody at the Mansion House—on 22nd January I received this letter, containing this memorandum, and three bills, in a registered letter from Birmingham—the bills amount to 4, 250l.—the letter is, I believe, in Warren's writing and signed by him, and the bills are, I should say, undoubtedly endorsed by him—all the genuine bills are endorsed by him. (Letter read:\"Birmingham, 21st January, 1873. Dear Sir,—I hand you herewith, as per enclosed, memorandum bills for discount, the proceeds of which please place to my credit. F. A. Warren. Memorandum of acceptances paid into the Bank of England, Western Branch: acceptance of the London and Westminster Bank, due March 23rd, 1,000l. International Bank of Hamburg and London, April 11th, 2,050l. Bank of Belgium and Holland, Limited, 1,000l.; total 4,050l.\") (The bill which was the subject of the Indictment was here read: \"Valparaiso, November 6th, 1872, drawn by H. C. Streeter on the London and Westminster Bank, at three months after sight, in favour of Messrs. Berenberg, Gosler & Co., Hamburg, for 1,000l. Accepted 28th December, 1872, by the subcountry manager of the London and Westminster Bank, H, F, Billinghurst, and W. H. Nicholls pro Secretary. \"Endorsed\" F. A. Warren,\" and \"Berenberg, Gosler & Co.\") Three of the acceptances on three of the bills are the same as three in the batch of 7th December; they purport to be the same acceptors—those bills were discounted and the account credited with the amount—they were presented when they became due on 31st March, 3rd April, and 14th April, and were returned as forged—on 22nd January, I recieved from Birmingham this registered letter and memorandum of bills, dates, and amounts—I do not undertake to say that the letter is in Warren's writing—I do not think it is his signature, but I should say that it is an imitation of it—I took it at the time as Warren's signature, having no suspicion—the endorsement on the eight bills, is, I should say, an imitation of his, there are certain little characteristics wanting—I took them at the time as his endorsement, and they were discounted and Warren's account was credited with the amount. (MR. MCINTYRE objected to the reception of this evidence, as, if there was an imitation of Warren's writing, there might also be forged letters written to withdraw the amount, and that the letter was not shown to have been brought to Warren's knowledge, THE COURT considered that it would be a question for the Jury whether it was done by Warren's authority.) The bills amounted to 9, 350l., which amount was placed to the account on the 25th—two of the bills are acceptances of Rothschild, similar to the one on 17th January, and two bills are acceptances of Blydenstein, similar to the genuine bills sent up at the end of December—there was also an acceptance on the Anglo-Austrian Bank, similar to the one sent up at the end of December—there was also an acceptance of Suse and Sibeth, similar to the acceptance to the two bills which Austin Bidwell gave me at the end of November—the stamp and acceptance are the same, \"Accepted at Martin & Co.\"s—there is also an acceptance of the London and Westminster Bank, similar to the one on the Lucardie bill sent up at the end of December, where the words are \"sub-country man.\"—the last is on the International Bank of Hamburg and London, which is similar to one of the bills sent up to the end of December. (Letter read: \"Birmingham, 24th January, 1873. To Col P. M. Francis, Manager, W. B. B. of England. Dear Sir,—Enclosed I hand you bills for discount as per enclosed memo., and which please have placed to my credit on receipt. The reduction in Bank rate came quite opportunely for my wants. Signed, F. A. Warren.\" \"Memorandum of acceptances deposited in the Bank of England by F. A. Warren with a list of the various eight bills and the amounts.\" (There were originally ten bills, but two, for 750l and 800l., were struck out, and the total which was originally 10,900l. was reduced to 9,350l. The 9, 850l. represents the amount of the eight bills—on 4th February I received this letter dated Birmingham, 3rd February, enclosing eleven bills amounting to 11,072l. 18s. 6d.—I discounted them, and Warren's account was credited with that amount—the signature to that letter is very bad indeed; it is cot so good as many of the others, not so like his signature—I passed it at the time as his signature, but now looking at it, with my present experience, I say that it is a bad imitation—the signature to the bills is a better imitation than the letter, if it is an imitation—there is an indecision about the signatures to the bills which makes them very doubtful but I passed them at the time—the letter was registered; all the letters that came from Birmingham were registered. (The acceptances enclosed were one of Rothschild's, on of the Bank of Belgium and Holland, one of the Anglo-Austrian Bank, one of the International Bank of Hamburg and London, one of Blydensteiris and one of Baring Brotlwrs.) The bill for 2, 500l. on the International Bank of Hamburg and London, Limited, was refused payment beyond 25l., it having been altered from 25l. to 2, 500l., and all the other bills were returned as forgeries—(Letter read: \"Birmingham, 3rd February, 1873. Dear Sir,—I did not duly acknowledge your esteemed favour of the 24th of January, as I daily expected to come to the City, but do not find myself yet able for the journey, still suffering greatly from my fall, or rather its effects; but I hope to see you before long. Please direct as last, as I am staying with a friend a short distance out of town. Letters will reach me directed to this office. I enclose you bills as per mems, of which please place the value to my credit on receipt. Yours faithfully, F. A. Warren.\") I acknowledged the receipt of those bills by writing to \"F. A. Warren, Post Office, Birmingham\"—on 10th February I received this registered letter, dated 8th February, and this memorandum—it enclosed two bills, the amount of which was 4, 642l. 19s. 4d.—(Letter read: \"Birmingham, 8th February, 1873. Dear Sir,—Your favour of the 4th, acknowledging receipt of bills, mailed 3rd instant, came duly to hand. Enclosed I hand you bills and memorandums, proceeds of which place to my credit on receipt, and accept assurances, &c. Yours faithfully, F. A. Warren. Mem. of bills sent on 8th February, total, 4, 642l. 19s. 4d.\") Those two bills were presented at maturity, and returned as forged—I had discounted them, and credited the, account with them on 10th February—on 13th February I received this letter and a batch of bills, amounting to 14, 696l. 16s. 2d., which were discounted, and the amount placed to the credit of the account—(Read: \"Birmingham, 12th February, 1873. Dear Sir,—Enclosed I hand you bills for discount as per memorandums herewith. Please have proceeds placed to credit of my account on receipt. Yours faithfully, F. A. Warren. P. S. My dear Sir,—The mail was so near closing when I wrote my last that I did not have the time to make a proper acknowledgment of your good wishes in my behalf, as expressed in the P. S. of yours of the 24th inst., and I now take occasion to return you my sincere thanks, and to inform you that I am gradually but slowly recovering, and also am succeeding thus far in matters of business to my wish. Yours faithfully, F. A. W. Yours of 10th duly received.\") Those bills were presented in due course, and returned as forgeries—on 21st February I received this registered letter and memorandum, and sixteen bills, amounting to 14, 686l. 15s. 4d., which were discounted, and the account credited with them—the bills were presented and returned as forgeries—(Bead: \"Birmingham, 20th February, 1873. Dear Sir,—Enclosed I hand you bills, with mems., for discount, proceeds of which please place to the credit of my account on receipt. Yours faithfully, F. A. Warren. Colonel P. M. Francis, manager. P. S. My dear Sir,—I am happy to inform you that my doctor reports me as doing finely, with the prospect, should no drawback occur, of resuming my active life again in a few days. Under these circumstances I hope soon to have the pleasure of seeing you, and in the meantime, I remain, dear Sir, yours obliged, F. A. Warren.\") On 25th February I received this registered letter and memorandum, and bills amounting to 19, 253l. 10s. 3d.—I discounted them, and credited the account with them—they were presented in due course, and returned as forgeries—(Read: \"Birmingham, 24th Feb., 1873. Dear Sir,—Enclosed I hand you memorandum with bills for discount, the proceeds of which please place to my credit on receipt, &c. F. A. Warren.\") I also produce a registered letter from Birmingham, dated 27th February, which contained, I think, twenty-four bills, amounting to 26, 265l.—I discounted all but two of them, and on 28th February credited the account with 24, 265l.—the two I omitted to discount were two which purported to bear the acceptance of Blydenstein for 1,000l. each, payable three months after sight, but the date of the acceptance was omitted; they were not sighted, but the stamp was on them—they were sent to Blydenstein on the 28th, to be sighted, and were returned as forgeries—the remaining portion of that batch, the 24,000l. odd, were presented in due course, and returned as forgeries—(Letter read:\"Birmingham, 27th February, 1873. Dear Sir,—Enclosed I hand you memo, with bills for discount, proceeds of which please place to the credit of my account on receipt. I have yours of 25 ackg. rect. of bills sent on 24th. Yours faithfully, F. A. Warren. P. S. My dear Sir,—I take this opportunity of thanking you for the trouble you have taken in my behalf in making special application to the Bank Committee about the AngloAustrian and Russian Bank bills. I have some of each, to amount of about 6,000l., and shall either get two endorsements on them or return them to my friends. Accept, dear Sir, the assurance of my esteem, while I remain yours faithfully, F. A. W.\") The custom is to return the cancelled cheques in the pass-book—when the discovery was made with regard to the two Blydenstein bills there were certain cheques which had not been returned—these cheques (produced) which have been paid but not returned are all out of the book delivered on 13th January—there are eleven here, they are all out of the second cheque-book, and they are all drawn to order—they are not all the same number, they follow on—they agree with the chequebook delivered, and are all signed \"F. A. Warren.\"\n\nMR. MCINTYRE. Q. Is the filling up his? A. I cannot say, but the signature I have no doubt about; I have studied it a good deal, and I know all the peculiarities of his signature now—I have seen him write three times, but only his signature; on those occasions the forms were filled up by somebody else and signed by him—I think those are the only times I have seen him write—I judge from that and from our signature-book also, which was signed in Mr. Fenwick's presence.\n\nExamination-in-chief continued. If the cashiers have any doubt, they refer to the signature-book before paying cheques—Bills read: \"19th February, 1873, for 2,000l. in favour of Clark & Co., or order, endorsed —˜Clark & Co, 'and 'Jay Cooke, McCulloch & Co. '—20th February, 1873, for 4, 500l. in favour of C. J. Heorton, endorsed —˜C. J. Heorton; and again —˜C. J. Horton, 'with a memorandum in a corner, 'Endorsement irregular'—20th February, 1873, for 6, 300l. in favour of C. J. Horton, endorsed 'C. J, Horton'—21st February, 1873, for 2, 100l. in favour of J. C. Mitchell, originally 'or order, 'but altered and made payable to bearer, initialled by the drawer and endorsed 'J. C. Mitchell'—22nd February, 1873, for 3, 500l. in favour of and endorsed by Messrs. Clark & Co.—24th February, 1873, for 10,000l. in favour of and endorsed by C. J. Horton—25th February for 6,000l. in favour of Thomas Carter, and endorsed 'Thomas Carter' and 'C. J. Horton'—27th February for 10,000l. in favour of and endorsed by Messrs. Clark & Co.—27th February for 5,000l. in favour of W. R. Graham, originally 'or order, 'but made payable to bearer, endorsed 'W. R. Graham '—27th February, another for 7, 500l. altered from —˜order, 'to bearer, 'to C. J. Horton; crossed on the face, —˜Jay Cooke McCulloch & Co. '—28th February, 2, 500l. in favour of and endorsed by C. J. Horton, and crossed 'Continental Bank.' \"Those are all the cheques I have left of Warren's—when the account was debited with those cheques, the balance standing to Warren's account was 1, 859l. 16s. 10d. without the last cheque for 2, 500l. which was not paid—the total amount of money drawn out after the 22nd January, when the first lot of forged bills came in was 100, 405l. 7s. 3d.—the total amount of bills returned as forged was 102, 217l. 19s. 7d.—I have got an accurate copy of the accounts from the ledger, and the ledger is here, showing the whole account, including Warren's account from the 4th of May to the time of the discovery—the cheques drawn and paid are entered on the day they are paid.\n\nCross-examined by MR. RIBTON. The amount of everything paid in to his credit up to the close of December is 17, 504l. 19s. 4d.—the amount paid in actual cash was a little over 8,000l., including the Portuguese Bonds and deducting the bills discounted—I am wrong; we only discounted 5, 300l. in bills to December, and 12, 200l. would be the amount paid in in actual cash and securities—all the bills I discounted up to December were genuine, and 4, 500l. was discounted on 17th January for Rothschild's, which was paid—that was the only one paid after December.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. I have been the manager of a bank about thirteen years—I was in the Army before that—I was sub-agent for a bank at Leeds, agent at Hull, and afterwards at the Western Branch—I entered on my duties at the Western Branch on 3rd March, 1872—I was sub-agent and agent to the Bank of England—I succeeded Mr. Pimm—I did not go over the accounts with him; I bad a sub-manager, who could give me all the information—we have the addresses of every customer in our books—my attention was called to Warren's account at the close of August, on my return from leave on the 29th—I did not go through the account—an ordinary drawing account would not be allowed to be overdrawn, and it would not matter where his address was—the only address I had was the Golden Cross Hotel—he was simply described in the ledger as a commission agent, at that address—that is in the ledger—I did not make inquiries at the Golden Cross Hotel about him—the account commenced with a payment of 1, 200l. in the way that has been described—I have only a list of bills and the account—a great portion of the account was withdrawn on my return in August; the balance must have been under 100l. at the end of August; it was about 39l.—he paid in on the 26th and 27th August 200l. altogether—the account stood at 219l. on 3rd September—page 155 of the depositions shows both sides of the account—on 3rd September he brought 8,000l. of Portuguese Bonds—I did not then make inquiries as to his address—he gave me no address at Birmingham, except \"Post Office, Birmingham\"—the Portuguese Bonds were sold, and we placed the amount to his credit on 14th September—he drew out upon that account by a cheque to Jay Cook of 3,030l. 12s. 6d., which you will see in the account on the 14th—it must hare been the old cheque-book—I discounted these bills on 29th November—they were dated 31st October, and were Suse and Sibbeth's; two bills of 500l.—I cannot tell whether it was the 26th or 29th when he asked me to discount them; I am doubtful whether it was on the 26th or 29th I saw him—I cannot recollect if I discounted the bills the same day I saw him—I did tell him I would make inquiries about them—I did so, at my head office only—the balance in his favour then was 1, 658l.—the two bills I discounted are here—they were payable in London—I did not make inquiries at the place in the City where they were payable; that would not be usual—I cannot say what I led him to believe—from what they said at my head office in answer to my inquiries I discounted the bills—I am not aware if I saw him between the 29th November and the 23rd December—I received on 30th December a letter of the 28th, containing some bills—all his bills received before 21st January were genuine, and paid at maturity—I wrote to him at the Post Office, Birmingham at his request, and only there—the bills were acknowledged—the Bank of England has a branch at Birmingham—the first letter I received from Warren was the one containing the batch of bills which were discounted on 30th December—I had no letter from him between 28th December and 21st January, 1873, nor before 28th December—the letter of 21st January did not strike me as being different from that of 28th December—it is somewhat different—there, is a general similarity between all the letters after the 21st January, which, without suspicion being excited, would not attract attention—I believed all the' letters to be in the handwriting of Warren—I cannot say when I changed my opinion, but it was after a process of study—I do not know anything about Mr. Chabot; I have only seen him to speak to him quite lately—I do not know that the documents were submitted to him—I see that the letter of 21st January is much more cramped—the signature is larger than the body of the letter—it appears to be written with the same ink— with my present knowledge I would not say that the letter is in the handwriting of Warren—I do not say that the signature was written at the same time—I think the signature is Warren's—the colour of the ink is very much like the colour of the ink in the writing; it looks pretty much the same colour—the signature is not a stiff writing; I think it is quite as free a signature as those in the other letters; look at the two \"r's\"—I don't know that it was after the last examination that I changed my opinion as to these other letters being in Warren's handwriting; I don't know when the last examination was about handwriting—I don't know that it was when I found he was not in this country at the time these letters were written from Birmingham that I changed my opinion—I did not learn that for a considerable time—it may have been so; first of all I thought they were his writing, and afterwards I thought not—I did afterwards find from inquiry that he was out of the country at the time those letters bear date—I also compared the writing—it may possibly have been one thing that made me change my opinion; I don't think that was altogether the reason that made me change my opinion in the first instance; very likely that induced me to make further comparison of the letters—the indorsements on the bills after 21st January are much more like his signature than a great many of his writings that I have seen—I think they are not his writing—I believe the indorsements on these three bills that came in the letter of 21st January are in Warren's writing—I don't know whether these signatures have been submitted to Mr. Chabot—these indorsements have all the little peculiarities of his signature—I don't think they are suffer than the signature to his letter of 28th December; I think they are written freely—there are several peculiarities, and one is in the stroke of the \"f\" and the crossing in the stroke of the \"f\"; he never joins the crossing of the stroke of the \"f\" to the crossing—I have had that peculiarity pointed out to me; not by Mr. Chabot—it was not my own discovery in the first instance—when he was with me on 17th January he certainly looked very ill—I don't think he was ever at the bank after that day, I never saw him—the stamp of the London and Westminster Bank on the bill which is the subject of this indictment, is about the same as on the genuine bill we had—I don't think it is exactly like the other bills we had of theirs, there is a peculiarity in the stamp; here is a \"B in the word bank not finished, that is a peculiarity that might easily have escaped in finishing the stamp—I noticed it at the time—I made inquiries to this extent, that all the bills for a very considerable period were shown at headquarters previously to being discounted; I either took or sent them to the head-office to see whether I should discount them before they were discounted—I was discounting to a very great extent, from 21st January to 28th February upwards of 100,000l., for a man whose only address was \"Post-office, Birmingham\"—we have not many of those sort of things in our bank—the bills came in very sharp indeed after the 21st January— all these bills were submitted to head-quarters, and his address also; the bills were of a very first-rate class, and I suppose stood upon their own merits—from 14th May up to the end of December everything I did for him, including discounting bills, was 17,000l.; but in this one month, from 21st January to 28th February, I did bills to the amount of upwards of 100,000l.—I made no inquiries at Birmingham and caused none to be made—the cheques commence on 19th February, the pass-book left the bank on 17th February—our post-book shows that it was dispatched on that day, it was sent by post to \"Post-office, Birmingham\"—I don't know whether that was in answer to any communication; I don't find any written request among his letters; it is not unusual to send a man's pass-book periodically—that address had always found him—I have no memorandum showing under what circumstances I sent it—the ledger has a mark in it on 17th February which shows it was sent; my chief clerk informed me that it was sent on 17th February—he is not here—it is usual to put a sort of mark in the ledger, the date up to which the account is made when the pass-book is sent—it would be in the post-book, the letter clerk would enter it in his post-book as dispatched—there would be no account of the circumstances under which it was sent; the request may have been a verbal one, but I don't know anything of it, I find nothing in writing about it, I have searched to see—I have produced all the papers that purport to come from Warren, they have been produced here to-day—I did not myself take the bills of Blydenstein over to their office on 28th February—they went down by a clerk who goes to the City; he generally goes about 1.30 or so—those cheques that were crossed would be paid through a banker in the regular way, and the others over the counter; those for 2, 500l. and 700l. are both crossed.\n\nCross-examined by MR. METCALFE. I speak to the signature of the cheques, not the filling up; I won't undertake to say whose writing the filling up is—two of the cheques have been altered from \"order\" to \"bearer,\" with initials; I cannot speak to those initials—they are apparently not in the same handwriting as the signature; that, no doubt, escaped my attention at the time; I can't say they are in the same handwriting, apparently they are not.\n\nRe-examined. The discounts became larger after the 17th—in the conversation on the 17th, Austin Bidwell said, that he hoped to have his work shops in full operation by 1st February—that was on the same occasion when he brought Rothschild's bill—I had no doubt of the genuineness of the bills at the time.\n\nHENRY FARNCOMB BILLINGHURST. I am sub-country manager of the London and Westminster Bank, at the head office in Lothbury—I am the submanager of the country office that includes foreign bills; everything that is not London—this bill, purporting to be drawn by Streeter & Ca, of Valparaiso, upon and accepted by the London and Westminster Bank, is a forgery so far as the acceptance is concerned—I never saw Mr. Streeter's signature; I know nothing of any such transaction—the signature to it, \"H. F. Billinghurst,\" is not my writing; it is a bad imitation of it—this is not the signature of Mr. Nichols, it is an imitation of it—the stamp is an imitation of our stamp—it stops at the words \"man. \"and \"secret,\" that was the same with our stamp at one time; the block under the stamp was failing just at the end; it was not done on purpose, the stamp itself has the completion of \"bank\" and \"manager,\" and so on, but the block underneath, upon which it is stamped, gave way at one time—this (produced) is a genuine bill accepted by us, this is my signature, it has the same defects of the stamp—here are other bills purporting to be acceptances of the London and Westminster Bank, they are all forgeries—none of the supposed drawers have accounts with us.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. I presume this name on Streeter's bill is intended for Billinghurst, it could be made so, there is an \"i\" and two \"l's,\"—I should never mistake it for my writing, I say it is a bad imitation of it—it is an imitation certainly.\n\nWHITFORD HENRY NICHOLS. I am a clerk in the London and Westminster Bank—I at times sign acceptances for the secretary when required to do so—the acceptance to this bill of Streeter, purports to be signed by Mr. Billinghurst and me, they are forgeries; this is not my signature, it is a very fair imitation of it, but a very bad one of Mr. Billinghurst's—these all purport to be signed by me, but I have not signed any of them, nor do I know the drawers' names, they are all forgeries—they all have the stamp of the London and Westminster Bank—the stamp is always put on the bills we accept and send to the London and Westminster Bank—we have many thousands of these bills in the course of a month, and that was so last year—we gave no authority to anyone to sign our names.\n\nJOHN RUDOLPH LORENT. I am manager of the Bank of Belgium and' Holland, Limited—these bills (produced) purport to be accepted by our bank and signed by us, the signature is not ours—this is an imitation of our stamp and of my signature—I gave no authority to any person to put my name on any of these bills—I sign as manager, and Mr. H. Holman Shuman as sub-manager—this is not his signature, but an imitation of it—these (produced) are two of the genuine acceptances, with the genuine stamp and signatures on both.\n\nCross-examined by M. MCINTYRE. We accept hundreds of bills in a month—this is a very bad imitation of my signature, and this is very little like Mr. Shuman's signature—the stamp is copied from our office stamp, and is like the stamp of our genuine bills, of which we have hundreds a month.\n\nHERMAN GWINNER. I am managing director of the International Bank of Hamburg in London—the signature to these eleven bills is not mine—the form of acceptance is like that adopted at my bank—the bill A 95 is not the signature of Mr. Falk, the sub-manager—this (produced) is a genuine acceptance of the bank—I do not see what the paper has to do with it.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. The drawers find the paper, we do not make it a sine qua non that they shall all use the same paper—Mr. Falk and I always sign bills, and hundreds of our acceptances are out—they are all stamped—these are bad imitations—this mil, No. 177, was drawn in the Brazils—it was originally 25l., it is now 2, 500l.—it is all written in straight \"twenty-five hundred.\"\n\nRe-examined. The \"hundred pounds\" is in different writing, the \"und\" of \"pound\" has been used to make \"hundred,\" and there are two cyphers after the 25.\n\nALFRED CHARLES DE ROTHSCHILD. I am a member of the firm of N. M. Rothschild & Son—I have examined this bill—the acceptance \"N. M. Rothschild\" is not in my writing, or that of any of the firm—the stamp across the bill is an imitation of ours—this (produced) is a genuine London bill of Sir Antony de Rothschild for 4, 500l.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. The genuine bill was drawn by our house in France on our house in London—all the members of the London firm sign the same name, but the handwriting is different—the stamp is used by a clerk in our office—this stamp is exactly like ours—if anyone had got hold of the genuine stamp, it would naturally have made the same impression as this.\n\nRe-examined. This purports to be in the writing of Sir Antony de Rothschild, but it is a forgery, and the others are all forgeries— \"they are imitations of this genuine bill, some might think them good, some might not.\n\nCHARLES JOHN SIBETH. I am a member of the firm of Suse and Sibeth—all these bills which purport to bear the signature of our firm are forgeries—these two bills far 500l. each, discounted on 29th November, are undoubtedly genuine.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. Two partners sign bills, and three gentlemen hold our procuration—this stamp, \"Accepted at Messrs. Martin & Co.,\" is used in our office on our genuine bills; no bill is accepted in our office without that stamp—the stamp is in the hands of a special clerk, who gets them ready for acceptance; it is in his hands in the day, and is locked up in the safe at night—other clerks might take the stamp in his absence.\n\nFRANCIS HAMILTON. I am a member of the firm of Shipley & Co., merchants, City—these three acceptances are forgeries; they are an imitation of my signature—this (producid) is a genuine acceptance—every member of the firm signs.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. I was not examined before the Lord Mayor—this is our usual stamp; it goes on all bills, whatever member of the firm signs them.\n\nCHARLES LLOYD NORMAN. I am a member of the firm of Baring Brothers—the acceptances to all these bills are forgeries; they are imitations of the signature of our firm, and of our stamp—the bill for 1,000l. (One of the ten sent up on 10th December) is a genuine bill of our firm, and has the genuine stamp to it—the forged bills are an imitation of it in the stamp and signature.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. If I saw the stamp alone I should not know whether it was an impression of our real stamp—there are eight members of our firm, they all sign the name of the firm.\n\nRe-examined. The stamp is an excellent imitation, but I have not compared the two.\n\nFREDERICK MOYERN. I am a clerk in the Russian Bank of Foreign Trade—I know the signature of Mr. Sperth, the manager—this is not his signature, but it is the form of acceptance used at our bank—this other bill (produced) bears our genuine signature.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. Two signatures are always required, Mr. Sperth'a and the deputy manager's, Mr. Fuerst, and in his absence I sign—the forged bill pretends to be signed by me—it has a stamp on it.\n\nJOSEPH TUSSAUD BYNG. I am assistant to the manager of the Union Bank of London—these eight bills are not genuine.\n\nWILLIAM HENRY TRUMPLER. I am a partner in the firm of B. W. Blydenstein—these bills are not genuine—this one (produced) is a genuine bill.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. There are three members in the firm, and they all sign the name of the firm.\n\nCOLONEL FRANCIS (recalled). The letter which came on 13th December was a registered letter.\n\nJOSIAH WINSPEAR. I am a waiter at the Queen's Hotel, Birmingham—I know George Bidwell—I have seen him twice at the Queen's Hotel—I last saw him there about the middle of February—he occupied a private room—on the second occasion I found the sitting-room door locked.\n\nCross-examined by MR. POWELL. The Queen's is a large hotel, accommodating a little over 100 guests—there was nothing that attracted my attention to the prisoner besides the door being locked, and that was in February last—I was spoken to about this matter about March—I believe it was the fore part of March—Mr. Stevenson spoke to me, one of Mr. Freshfiejd's clerks—he spoke to me in the coffee-room—he asked me if I saw such a gentleman, and what I tell you is the result of what I told him—George Bidwell had a dark overcoat on and a light-coloured scarf, almost a white scarf, and a satchel, or sort of travelling-bag, over his shoulder—that is not an unusual custom in Birmingham—I noticed he was a kind of foreigner-looking gentleman—there are a great many gentlemen of that description in Birmingham—I did not notice anything except that.\n\nALFRED MORLEY. I am a cab proprietor at Birmingham—I know George Bidwell—I first saw him on or about the 20th February—I took him in my cab from the Queen's Hotel to the post-office at Birmingham—he gave me. a note to fetch a letter, and a 2s. piece to buy a shilling stamp—there was an address written on the piece of paper, and I was to ask for a letter to that address—I did so—he sat in my cab while I went in—there was one letter for him at the post-office—I gave it to the prisoner and drove him back to the Queen's Hotel—he paid me 1s. 2 1/2 d.—he said that was all the change he had got—I noticed he spoke with a foreign accent—I should judge him to be a Yankee—I saw him again, about two or three hours after, get out of another cab—Barker was the driver—I spoke to Barker at the time about it.\n\nCross-examined by MR. POWELL. That was on or about 20th February—the next time I saw him after that day was at the Mansion House; I don't remember when that was, it was two months afterwards, I daresay—he was then in the dock at the Mansion House—I came from Birmingham myself—I was sent for by Mr. Freshfield—I saw one of Mr. Freshfield's clerks before I left Birmingham—there were two persons in the dock when I saw him—the other was Hills—my stand is usually in the path leading to the Queen's Hotel—I take my stand there daily, and have done for about seven years—some days I don't drive one person from the Queen's Hotel in the course of the day—I do not frequently drive persons coming out from the Queen's Hotel—I stand at the Queen's Hotel, but I very seldom get a job there—there are railway cabs that get the jobs there—I stand outside the gates, opposite the statue—I saw the prisoner coming out of the hotel—it is not five minutes' drive from the hotel to the post-office the whole time he was under my observation was about a quarter of an hour—my observation was while he was getting in, while he was speaking to me, and when he got out again, and I saw him two hoars after get out of Barker's cab.\n\nJOSIAH WINSPEAR (re-called). The next time I saw the prisoner was in the dock at the Mansion House after I had seen him at the hotel—there was only one other person in the dock with him, who I recognise now as the prisoner Hills.\n\nJOHN BARKER. I am a cab-driver at Birmingham—I drive one of the cabs allowed to go into the premises of the London and North Western Railway—on or about the 20th of February, I had George Bidwell in my cab, and I saw Hills also the same day—I remember the last witness speaking to me—I took George Bidwell from the Queen's Hotel to the postoffice—I pulled up at the door, and he told me to get off my box—I got down, and he handed me a large letter, and told me to register it, and anything more to pay I was to pay it—it was stamped—I went and registered it, and I brought out the receipt to him, he folded it up very small, and tore it up in very small pieces—there was nothing extra to pay upon the letter, the stamps were sufficient—I then drove him back to the Queen's Yard, opposite the Queen's Hotel, and he jumped out—he did not pay me; he said he would send my fare out—he went and joined Hills, and they stood talking about a minute, perhaps—Bidwell turned round and looked at me, and went into the hotel, and Hills turned for the Railway Station, and presently one of the boots of the hotel brought me my fare out.\n\nCross-examined by MR. POWELL. I had not seen either of them before—this was on or about 20th February, about 3. 40—the lamps were not lighted—it was quite light at that time—I next saw them at the Mansion House—Morley and me had some conversation about it the same day, about the way he did his business—we were at the Mansion House together—I can't say whether I was in the room when he was examined—I think the first time we saw them we did not give evidence at all—I saw them on two or three days at the Mansion House—no one took me to show me them—I went in and saw the same men—I knew they were arrested—I went to the Mansion House on purpose to see them—I came up from Birmingham for that purpose, of course—I had a notice from Freshfields, and I went and saw them—I think I was examined the second journey we had up—that was some time in March, I can't speak to a week—I did not come up with Morley, I saw him when we got to London—I saw him at the Mansion\n\nHouse—I believe I heard the latter part of his evidence, I was out at the door when he was called into the witness-box—we talked it over previous to hearing of any forgery—we talked about the way that Mr. Bidwell did his business—we went down once in the mail, but there were several people with us; we might have had one word, but I don't remember anything about it—that was before the examination—I have been shown a sketch—Morley might have seen it too, but not in my presence—a gentleman from London showed it to me, but I can't say who he was—he might have been a detective—that was about three weeks or a fortnight before I went to the Mansion House—I have not seen the sketch since—the person who got into my cab came out of the Queen's Hotel, and directed me to drive to the post-office—that is about 150 yards—he sat in the cab while I went into the post-office—I handed him the register receipt, and while I stood waiting for orders he was tearing up the receipt—he tore it up openly before me—he chucked the bits out of the cab, and one piece was left on the cab, it was rather wet, and he knocked it off with his umbrella or stick—there was none left in the cab—I never saw him again till I saw him at the Mansion House—I was up twice, I think, before I saw Bidwell—I came up afterwards and saw him—I have been in the same situation as cab-driver for ten years—sometimes I carry ten persons a day, perhaps twenty, perhaps five; it is very uncertain—the letter I registered was for America.\n\nCross-examined by MR. HOLLINGS. The Queen's Hotel is under the same roof as the station—the yard is in front of the hotel—when I drove Bidwell down there I saw Hills standing at the entrance to the station, about eight or nine yards from where he alighted from the cab—he was waiting under the arch leading to the booking-office—when Bidwell joined him they stood still about a minute, talking, and then Hills went to the station and Bidwell went into the hotel—Hills walked directly away from me—that was the only time that I saw him—I saw him for a minute and a half or two minutes—it was not raining then, but it had been—there were very few people about—if Bidwell had paid me my fare I should not have noticed the other man—I was looking after Bidwell—I believe I was up at the Mansion House first in March—it was the beginning of March—I know at that time that Hills was in custody—I went to the Mansion House to see him, but I was not examined until after Bidwell was in custody—I identified Hills—I told my friend Morley so—I did not tell anyone else—we talked it over previous to knowing anything about it.\n\nRe-examined. I don't know to whom the letter was directed—I remember it was to America—we book the time we go out for a job, and the time we come back, every job we do, and when my attention was called to this, I found what jobs I had done—that makes me certain it was 20th February.\n\nSEYMOUR LOUIS PINTO. (Interpreted.) I am a bill broker at Amsterdam—I recognise George Bidwell—I knew him by the name of H. E. Gilbert—I knew Messrs Citroen and Zonen at Amsterdam, gold manufacturers, they work up gold—early in November, 1872, I learnt from them that a stranger would probably call upon me, and a day or two later Mr. Gilbert called upon me—a commissionaire from the hotel came with him—he gave me the name of Gilbert, and said he had some bills in his possession which he had brought with him from Frankfort, which he wished to discount—I declined to discount them—he inquired whether he could obtain any long bills in Amsterdam or Germany—I said it was very difficult to obtain anything of the sort, as that sort of bill was very dear in Amsterdam—I told him that there were some bills on Hamburg in the market the day before, and possibly he might obtain them—he gave me an order to buy bills to the amount of about 20,000 guilders, and I was to only buy them from good houses—I asked him subsequently what he was, and he said he had some business connected with the railway works—I bought some bills for him, and the following day he called and paid me in Dutch bank notes—the day on which he paid for the first bills he gave another order to buy further bills to the same amount or rather more—those were bought and paid for in the same way—a day or two after he bought the bills there was a change in the currency, and a day or two later he came to me to sell those bills for him again—he said he had made a mistake and wished to get rid of them again—I said he would have to put up with a loss—when I went on Change I learnt the alteration in the currency and found there would be such a great loss in selling the bills that I would not do it without further orders—I explained that to him and he told me to sell the bills, that it did not matter to him, he had made such large profits on bill transactions in Frankfort that he could well afford to stand the loss, and he intended to buy something else by which he could recoup himself—the loss was from 500 to 600 guilders, about 50l. sterling—with the proceeds of those resold Hamburg bills, he instructed me to buy some fresh bills on London—he wrote the particulars on paper for me—I wrote the \"F. A. Warren\" at the bottom, because the \"W\" in \"Warren\" in the body of the paper was not plain enough for me to read, and I wrote it again myself—(Read: \"3,000l. three months, to the order of F. A. Warren, 1,000l. sight same order.\") He left after he gave that order—I suggested the name of Blydenstein and the Amsterdam Bank, because it was easy to get bills there—I bought these four bills for him. (One was drawn by Philipps, Sohne, on the Bank of Belgium and Holland for 1,000l. two for 500 of Suse and Sibeth and another for 1,000l. of the Amsterdam Bank, on the Bank of Belgium and Holland.) There was a bill of Cohen on Allard, but that was paid—I delivered those bills to George Bidwell—he paid for those with the proceeds of the Hamburg bills and there was a balance which he paid in Dutch bank notes—I saw George Bidwell four or five, or perhaps six, times—I did not see him after the transactions I have referred to—I received a letter on the 22nd of November from him, but that was before he left Amsterdam, before the last interview; when I saw him he referred to that letter—it was signed H. E. Gilbert. (This letter stated that he could not buy any more bills before Thursday or Friday, but would call on Thursday or Friday, at 1 p. m.) I saw Gilbert after I received that letter—he inquired whether I had received the letter—I did not receive any bills enclosed in that letter—I had those bills which George Bidwell had brought with him in my possession at the time—I afterwards received other letters from him from London—I received this letter of the 20th November, containing 860 guilders in Dutch bank notes. (Read: \"To S. L. Pinto Esq., care of Jay Cooke Mc Culloch & Co., London. November 20th, 1872. Dear sir,—Enclosed I hand you 860 florins, for which I should like you to send me a three months' drawn on the Amsterdam bank from London—I shall be over again next month, yours truly, H. E. Gilbert.\") The post between London and Amsterdam is one day—I made a purchase for him according to the order in that letter, and sent it to him in a letter—I received this reply; (This was dated London, 23rd November, 1872, from Gilbert acknowledging the receipt of the draft.) On 2nd of December, I received this farther letter from Gilbert inclosing 2, 185 guilders: (This was dated Novemlter 30th, 1872, and requested the witness to send, for the amount enclosed, a three months' bill on Berenberg, Gossler and Co.) I made a purchase according to order, and sent it to him by post, and received this acknowledgment from him: (This was dated 4th December, 1872.) I received this letter of 2nd January, 1873, containing 1, 490 guilders: (This requested, in return for the endos d, a three months' bill on London from the Amsterdam bank.) I made the purchase for him, and sent it to him by post, and received this acknowledgment; (This was dated llth January.) On 25th January I received this letter containing 6,010 guilders, but the letter only mentioned 6,000: (This was dated 24th January, requesting bills on London of three months, or having one month to run.) I bought for him this three months' bill on Baring's for 500l., dated 25th January, 1873, drawn by A. Gerson, on the Anglo-Australian bank—I also enclosed in the same letter a small bill for 4l. 10s. on Samuel Montague—I received this letter of 9th February, dated the 7th: (This acknowledged the remittance and enclosed 650 florins, for which he requested a three months' bill on London, of the Amsterdam bank) I answered that letter the day I received it, stating that I could not do business with such a small amount, I then received this letter from him: (This was dated 13th February, enclosed 410 florins more) I replied to that, stating that even with that further amount I could not obtain a three months' bill—I received a telegram on 25th February, which I think I have lost, and I sent him a further letter with an enclosure: (This and the former letter was mentioned in the notice to produce served on the prisoner, and MR. POWELL contended that the notice was insufficient, in point of time and particularity. MR. JUSTICE ARCHIBALD, however, held that it was sufficient) I or my son wrote the letter; I signed it and sent it by post—I have not received any complaint of its non-arrival—it was addressed \"H. E. Gilbert, care of Jay Cooke, McCulloch & Co.—I sent him in that letter a bill for 87l. 10l.—I have not heard from him since.\n\nCross-examined by MR. POWELL. I first communicated with the prisoner in Amsterdam, through Mr. Phillips, between 2 and 3 months back; Mr. Phillips is an advocate in Amsterdam—I told him exactly as I have done to-day, about three months ago—I first received an intimation that I should be required in England at the beginning of June—I received that intimation from Mr. Phillips—I did not write down what I had to say, Mr. Phillips did so for me—he said he wished it for transmission to England—I have not been in England on this business before, I came last Friday—besides the name of Blydenstein, I suggested to George Bidwell the Amsterdam bank, and probably others—I am not able to fix exactly the dates of the particular interviews, I did not make any memorandum of them, but I have a book in which the business was entered; that is here, the dates of the interviews were 5th November, 7th, llth, 12th, and 13th—it was on 13th and 14th November I gave him the bills on Suse and Sibeth and the Amsterdam bank; I handed those to him personally—I have a memorandum of them on that date in my book—this (produced) is the book, in which I made the entry at the time—all the transactions I had with him were in the ordinary course of business as a broker, such as I transact with a great number of other persons.\n\nRe-examined. When I was asked to come over, I consented at once, that was at the beginning of June.\n\nWILLIAM GUEST BARRETT. I was purser on board the Atlantic, one of the White Star line of steamers— \"on 7th December last I saw the prisoner Hills sail from New York on board the Atlantic—I saw his ticket in his possession—this is it (produced)—it is made out in the name of E. N. Hills—I frequently had occasion to speak to him on board, and addressed him as Mr. Hills—we arrived at Liverpool on 17th December, about 3 o'clock p. m., I think—he only had one small value with him.\n\nCross-examined by MR. HOLLINGS. I am not purser of the Atlantic now—I am on board the Adriatic—I read that ticket while it was in his possession—he did not hold it up for me to see; it was put into my hands by our passenger agent, as there was some mistake about his room—I did not take it from Hills, but I saw it handed to him—he was booked in a room with Colonel Steele, who objected to having him in there as he had taken the room for himself—I saw his luggage placed in the room which I assigned to him afterwards—if he had luggage in the hold I should have known itAmericans generally travel with a good deal of luggage—by a small' quantity of luggage I mean only one package, a portmanteau or box—I believe I was asked in April to come as a witness—my attention had not been drawn to the case at all.\n\nRe-examined. Mr. Laws, the agent, handed me this ticket (produced)—Colonel Steele came to me and objected to anyone being there, as he had made a distinct arrangement to have the room to himself—the arrangement was \"If forward room is not cleared, to have berth 58\"—that is what called my attention to the ticket—he was a saloon passenger—the fare is ninety dollars gold.\n\nJOHANNES DE WAAL. I am a banker, of Rotterdam, in partnership with my father—I first saw Macdonuell on 15th November, 1872, at my office at Rotterdam—he asked if I could purchase one or more bills on the London and Westminster Bank for about 600l.—I told him that the London and Westminster Bank bills were difficult to get, more than other banks, but I would try to get them—he produced 7, 435 guilders, which is 622l. 3s., and said that if I bought the bills I was to send them to an hotel in London, which I cannot recollect—I handed him 4l. 10s. in gold, and told him that I would remit the remainder to his direction—I gave him my own draft on London for 17l. 13s., and said \"Just go to Mr. Blydenstein and he wilt then know that it is all right, and remit it to me,\" and I gave him a card—I purchased a bill drawn by Lucardie on the London and Westminster Bank for 300l., and one on C. Gillman, Esquire, for 300l.—of course there was a little difference of 1s. 4d., which I made an account of, for postage and registration—he told me that the bills were to be drawn to the order of F. A. Warren, and I afterwards received this letter signed \"F. A. Warren\"—I sent the bills by registered letter to \"F. A. Warren\" at the address he gave, and afterwards received this letter, signed \"F. A. Warren,\" and enclosing the printed card which I had given to him to show to Mr. Blydenstein—the letter is in French—(M. METCALFE objected to the admission of this letter, as it was not proved to have come from Macdortnell, or to have been written with his authority.\n\nMR. W. WILLIAMS contended that the card which the witness had given to Macdonuell being contained in the letter was proof that it came from him).\n\nMR. METCALFE. Q. Do you recollect the card coming back in the letter, independent of the letter itself? A. Yes, I remember the card without the letter.\n\n(THE COURT considered that the letter was written by\n\nMacdonnell, or by his authority, and therefore admitted it. It was in French, dated London, 19th November, 1872, signed \"F. A. Warren\" addressed to Mr. De Waal, acknowledging the receipt of his registered letter containing bills to the amount of 6221. 3s., and enclosing the card.) I also received by post this letter, dated 24th January, 1873, purporting to be signed by W. J. Spaulding, and containing Dutch notes; after the receipt of which I purchased this bill for 158l. 13s. 5d. with the amount of the Dutch notes—I enclosed the bill in a letter to Spaulding, at Clews, Habicht & Co.'s, London—I received no acknowledgment.\n\nCross-examined by MR. METCALFE. Mr. Phillips, from Amsterdam, came to me about the evidence I was to give, and told me that persons from Amsterdam were coming to prove the same thing—he showed me two photographs, and after I came over I was taken to the Mansion House and saw the four prisoners in the dock—that was before their commitment—they did not take my evidence there—I only went once to the Mansion House—I was with Messrs. Freshfield—nobody pointed out the prisoners in the dock then—I saw them all four together—that was after I had seen the photographs—I have not got the photographs with me—I am sure it was Macdonnell I saw—it was the second prisoner from this side—I am a Dutchman—Amsterdam is two hours and a half by rail from Rotterdam—Mr. Phillips, who came to me, did not tell me that George Bidwell was at Amsterdam, he only told me that there was a certain case in hand, and if I was called to London to give evidence would I do so—he said that there was other evidence to come from Amsterdam, but I did not speak to Mr. Phillips myself, I was not at home, nor did I see him at the Mansion House—I only came here to give information to Mr. Freshfield, and he took me to the Mansion House—I pointed to Macdonnell in the dock, and said that it could not be anybody else but him—I could not recollect at that time which it was, hut I told him it was one of those three.\n\nRe-examined. I have no doubt now that the second man from this side is the man who dealt with me.\n\nMATTHIAS BARTRAM. I hold the procuration of Berenberg, Gossler & Co., at Hamburg—on 2nd December I received this letter, dated 30th November, signed \"W. J. Spaulding,\" containing some 1, 400 thalers in Prussian bank notes, and we sent Mr. Spaulding two bills next day to Clew's, Habicht & Co., one of which was the one for 200l.—I knew nothing of Mr. Spaulding—this other endorsement is not the writing of our firm, it is a bad imitation. (This bill was the subject of the indictment.) I have seen this other bill before; it was sent to me to make up the balance.\n\nEDWARD WILSON GATES. I am a partner in the firm of Wilson, Gates & Co., of Liverpool—on 2nd December, 1872, I saw Macdonnell in my private room, at Liverpool—he said that he had 2,000l. or 3,000l. to invest, that he had heard that we had bankers' bills, and he would like to have that amount—he desired what we call first-class paper—I showed him some bills in my bill box, and he picked out this one on Brown, Shipley & Co., which he said he would take. (This was for 1,000l., dated 22nd October, 1872.) This endorsement on it is in my writing, he paid me in Bank of England notes.\n\nCross-examined by MR. METCALFE. It was the third prisoner from me—I saw four photographs of four different people at Liverpool—I afterwards saw him in the dock at the Mansion House, and picked him out immediately—I had Seen several people pick him out in Court—I heard somebody say that he was the one next to a policeman, and I believe he was next to a policeman—William Anderson was one of those who picked him out, and Mr. Coupland was another—I never saw Mr. Coupland till he came to the station-house—I was morally certain before he said that that it was the one next to the policeman—that means that I was certain—I did not pick him out from the photograph; I said I would not swear to the man by his photograph—I can't tell why I was brought to London—Macdonnell had no beard at that time—I believe there was only one man with a beard in the dock.\n\nMR. GIFFARD. When I first saw him in the dock I had not the smallest doubt that he was the man who dealt with me for bills, nor have I now.\n\nWILLIAM ANDERSON. I am a clerk to Richardson, Spence & Co., American merchants, of Liverpool—I know the third prisoner from here (Macdonnell)—I first saw him when he came to our office in Liverpool to know if I had any first-class bills for sale, it was somewhere about the beginning of December—I asked him the object of his inquiry, he said that he had received a large sum of money in England, and wanted to make temporary use of it.\n\n(MR. METCALFE objected to this evidence, as it did not go to show the forgery or the uttering, it was only evidence of guilty knowledge.\n\nTHE COURT declined to exclude the evidence.) I said that we had no bills to sell, and asked him how he came to make enquiry of us—he said that he had seen our names on a letter of credit for which we are agents for several large American houses—I said that he would be more likely to get what he required in London than in Liverpool—he then asked me if there was anyone in Liverpool likely to supply what he wanted, and I said he had better try Samuel's bank—he asked me where it was—I said \"In Castle Street\"—one of our clerks, Mr. Coupland, happened to be in, and I asked him to go and show him where it was.\n\nCross-examined by MR. METCALFE. I saw the photograph at Liverpool, and when I saw him in the dock, I identified him—I was shown two sets of photographs at Liverpool, one set by the clerk to Bateson's, and the other by Brown & Co. of London—I saw Mr. Yates at Liverpool, we did not come up together, we were at the Mansion House together after the examination, but I never saw him till he was about to leave the Court after his examination—I don't think the man I picked out was next to a policeman—I picked out a man, and expressed to Coupland my opinion that he was the man—Coupland had not given his evidence then—I was asked if I recognised the man—I said that I did, and afterwards I gave my evidence—the man who came to me had a beard—Macdonnell was the only man in the photograph with a large beard; the man furthest off has a beard, and he had one then—there was more than one man with a beard in the photograph, more than one had hair on his chin.\n\nEDWARD COUPLAND. I am a clerk in the house with the last witness—I saw the prisoner Mcdonnell in our office at the end of November, or the beginning of December last—I heard him ask for bills, which is a thing I never heard before in our office—he was speaking to Mr. Anderson—I, could not hear what passed on the other' side of the counter, but I was asked to take him up to Yates' bank, which I did, that is about 200 or 300 yards off—I was talking to him on the way—I have not the least doubt he is the man.\n\nCross-examined by MR. METCALFE. I went with Mr. Anderson to the Mansion House, and he told me that it was Macdonnell that he saw there, but I thought so before that, and I said so afterwards—I had seen the photograph.\n\nRe-examined. I had no doubt about him, I knew him as soon as he came up.\n\nERNEST CHARLES DE LORELLI —I am a clerk in the English office of Rothschild's in Paris—I first saw Austin Bidwell on 16th November, at our office, under the name of Warren, he entered and went up to the head of the office, Mr. Gatley, and asked for a bill at three months' date, for 4, 500l. on London—Mr. Gatley informed him that it was not our custom to gire long paper, and declined it—Warren went on to tell us about an accident he had been in on the Calais Railway at Marquise, and he left shortly afterwards—he had pieces of plaster on his forehead, and he looked very unwell—he returned about two hours afterwards, during which interval Baron Alphonse De Rothschild had come in—Mr. Gatley had had some communication with Baron Alphonse next door—Austin Bidwell then saw Mr. Gatley again and I was in the room, and Baron Rothschild came in and spoke to him, and he gave the Baron a substantial account of the, accident—I stood quite close to them and heard what was said—Baron Rothschild is one of the Directors of the Northern Railway of France—Austin Bidwell told the Baron what had occurred, and said that he had been very much shaken—the Baron said he was very sorry, and he very much sympathised with him, and would do what he wanted about the bill—this bill for 4, 500l. was then prepared and the prisoner paid down in the first instance 99,000 francs in Bank of France notes, he had not enough with him to make up the whole amount—the total amount was 113, 962 francs 50 centimes—he left his address at the Grande Hotel when he went away—somebody was sent round there and the full amount was paid to us.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE Baron Alphonse De Rothschild is not here—I was first told on 15th August that I was to come over here; the solicitor in Paris told me so—the solicitor came before the 15th of this month, I don't remember the date exactly, he came on the 14th, and he came before hat—I first gave my evidence to Mr. Maugham on the 14th—I had not given it to anyone before that, I had seen the solicitor in the office before—I don't remember the date, it was in the early part of the year—he showed me a photograph on the 14th, I did not see one before that; yes I did see one before, it was shown me by a friend; I don't remember the date, it was not long before; I only saw one photograph at that time—he asked if I recognised who it was, and I said \"Yes\"—I don't think I am called upon to say who my friend was, it was a relation of mine; he knew that I should very likely have to be called over about this, and he asked if I would like to see the photograph, to see if I could recognise it—I said \"Yes,\" and he showed it me—that was a short time ago, when I was in London; I came over for a holiday—it was not anyone in Rothschild's house that showed it to me, nor anyone connected with this prosecution—it was after the prisoners were all taken up—I was not sure that I should be called as a witness, it was supposed that Mr. Gatley would have to come over; and I had to come instead of him—I was here about 12th July, that was when I was shown the photograph, I don't know where my friend got it—I object to tell you where I saw it—I took an interest in reading about this case; I believe I must have read portions of the evidence that was given at the Mansion House—I saw the man I now identify the other day—I was here on Mondays—that was the first time I recognised him; I had not seen him before—I was not here at the time the examination was going on at the Mansion House— I was not told that I was to come over until the 14th or 15th of this month—I don't remember reading about one of the prisoners having been injured in an accident—the reason Mr. Gatley has not come is that I was there all the time, and they said my evidence would do as well as his—Mr. Gatley gave him the bill, and he was the person to whom the story was told in the first instance, but I was standing by and listening to it.\n\nFREDERICK HEINRICH. I am a clerk at Rothschild's, at Paria—I prepared this bill by the instructions of Mr. Gatley—I took it to the Grande Hotel, and gave it to Mr. Warren; Austin Bidwell is that person.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. I had previously seen him at the office, and I saw him here on Saturday—I have not talked the matter over with the last witness, further than mere conversation in the office—I think I was told that when I came here I should see the man I had seen at the bank in January last—I saw a photograph a few days ago, and was told that was the man.\n\nEDWARD LEWIS OSGOOD. I am a clerk to Messrs. Drexell, Harjes, & Co., of Paris—I know Macdonnell—I saw him at Messrs. Drexell's on 29th January last—he deposited 50,000 francs with us on that day, in opening an account—he saw Mr. Harjes that day, and a letter of credit was prepared on Messrs. Morgan & Co., of London—I wrote a receipt for it, which Macdonnell signed—I was instructed by Mr. Harjes, in Macdonnell's presence, to prepare a cheque of 1,000l. on Morgan & Co., to the order of George Macdonnell—I drew it, had it entered, and returned to Mr. Harjes' room, where it was signed—Mr. Harjes then informed me that Mr. Macdonnell preferred a bill of exchange rather than a cheque, and this bill of exchange (produced) was given—it is drawn by Simpson & Co. on Messrs. Baring Brothers & Co., of London, for 1,000l., to the order of FrÃ©re Broeder, of Bahia—this is the second of the bill, the original we do not have, that is in London—this is endorsed by George Macdonnell—I saw him sign the receipt for the letter of credit, and he also gave specimens of his signature—I have one with me—he paid for the bill drawn by Simpson—some money remained to his credit after that.\n\nCross-examined by MR. METCALFE. It still remains—he gave me this slip of paper as a specimen of his signature, in order that I might know it when he drew upon us.\n\nJAMES HARRISON. I am a clerk in the employ of Drexell, Harjes, & Co., of Paris—I know Austin Bidwell and Macdonnell—on 9th October last this letter was received by us, purporting to be written by Macdonnell—letters very frequently came to us, addressed to Mr. George Macdonnell, which we forwarded to the address indicated by him in his letter of 9th October, to, Vienna, Frankfort, Amsterdam, London, and Chislehurst—in December we received letters signed \"A. B. Bidwell,\" containing a small amount to prepay postage on the letters we were supposed to have received—those letters were opened by members of the firm—I saw them, and the enclosuresafter the receipt of those letters, I forwarded letters to Austin Bidwell—I prepared them for the post; I did not take them myself—I saw Austin Bidwell a few days previously to 28th January and on the 28th—he inquired for letters, and paid a small amount on postage account—he inquired for letters addressed to Austin Bidwell and George Bidwell—I don't remember whether we had any at that time; I had given him some a day or two previously—he did not leave any address on that occasion—I saw Macdonnell on 29th January—he inquired for one of the members of the firm—I saw the letter of credit, and also the bill for 1,000l.—early in February I received this letter, purporting to be written by R. Adama, enclosing a registered letter addressed to \"Joseph B. Bid well, South Bend, Indiana\"—I retained that enclosure in my desk for upwards of a week, and then forwarded it—it was fastened with a large seal, with the initials \"O. B. \"on it—these two letters (produced) are written by me.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. I was not examined before the Lord Mayor—it was not decided that I was to give evidence until Thursday last—I was first spoken to immediately after the forgery was discovered, I believe the very day after, in March—it was spoken of in April as possible that some of us would be required in London—I saw Austin Bidwell on 28th January, and two or three days previously, I don't think quite as long as a week before, at our office, nowhere else.\n\nOLIVIER BIXIO. I am the co-manager in Paris of the General American Agency—I recognise Austin Bidwell and Macdonnell—I knew Austin Bidwell under the name of Clark—I saw them both together on 29th January last—Clark came to take back some bonds which he had deposited the day before, 10,000 dollars of American Securities 5 per cent.—they were returned to him; we declined buying them; he had offered them for sale in our office—Clark then proposed to buy a three months' sight draft on London for 1,000l.; we had none, but we proposed that we should buy some for him on the Bourse that very same day, and I went to the Bourse myself and gave the order; he made a deposit of 1,000 francs as a guarantee that he would take the draft after it was bought—I purchased this bill for him—(This was dated 10th January, 1873, for 1,000l., drawn by Beitelli Sapuzi, of Constantinople, upon Georgio Affendi, of Trieste, at three months, payable to the order of Coronati.) That bill was passed to the order of Clark—he paid the balance, and the bill was handed to him.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE I have not been a witness before today—my evidence was taken three days ago in Paris—I had been absent from Paris; I returned on Sunday, and my evidence was taken on Monday—my partner gave information to the prosecution about March—he is not here—the American Agency is an American and English department of a French Society called \"The Society for the Deposit of Accounts Current\"—we are bankers—we allow interest upon daily balances—I knew Clark first, he was introduced to me by my colleague—I did not see him on the 28th when he came—I saw him on the morning of the 29th—I then saw the bonds he had deposited—I did not myself give him the bill, my colleague did, I saw it done—I was shown a photograph before I came here—I was first shown one some months ago—I can't tell exactly when—I think I was shown two photographs, but I could not assert that—I don't know the person that showed me them, he came once with Mr. Maugham; he was an Englishman—I have not seen him since—he showed me photographs of Clark and the man next to him, and I told him they were the men I had seen at our office—I forget whether he told me what they were wanted for, we knew that—this was the only transaction I had with Austin Bidwell.\n\nWILLIAM BUTLER DUNCAN. I am a partner in the firm of D. Sherman & Co., of New York—I produce a variety of documents which reached me at New York—there is first a letter of advice from the post-office of a registered letter, then the envelope of the letter, and next a letter containing bank notes—also a letter sent to us by Droxell, Harjes & Co., addressed to George Macdonnell—the large euvclope contained sundry bills of exchange, these are them, there are thirteen—the Deputy Sheriff of New York opened the letters and deposited the bills with us for collection, for his account under an attachment.\n\nCross-examined by MR. POWELL. I received these documents myself from the hands of the Sheriff, and they have been in my custody from that time to this, or in the custody of my correspondent here for collection—I received them from the Sheriff in the latter part of March—originally the letters were taken out of the post-office sealed—I received them myself from the post-office, and kept them until the Sheriff attached them, and they were opened by him at the latter part of March, and he gave me written instructions to collect them for his account; he handed them back to me the moment he opened them, and I forwarded them to Messrs. Baring Brothers, in London, for collection; they did not come into my possession again until this moment—the documents never left my possession till I sent them to Messrs. Baring—I had stood by my clerk and seen him put a mark on each of them—I took a list of them—I put the numbers for collection on each document—I took a description myself of each document, and of the mark put on it—I have brought that memorandum with me, and hand it in—I compared the documents with the memorandum afterwards, to see that the clerk had accurately taken down the mark—I have not seen the original list here, Messrs. Baring will tell you about that—I sent the list to them with the documents; I kept a press copy (produced)—I handed the bills one by one to the clerk, and saw him make the marks.\n\nCross-examined by MR. METCALFE. A porter from our office went and got the letters from the post-office—postmen do not bring letters in America—the porter delivers them to whichever partner is present, which happened to be me on that morning—he delivered them to me before I knew that there was anything wrong—the head porter delivered them into my hands personally on each occasion.\n\nRe-examined. This is the press copy—I have compared it with the document which was made under my direction—I have not the slightest doubt that the documents which have been produced came in the envelopes I have described, or that the bank notes came in the envelopes I have described.\n\nAUGUSTE FLEISCHMAN (Interpreted). I am clerk to Messrs. Koch, LautÃ©ren & Co., brokers and merchants, of Frankfort—I recognise the prisoner Austin Biron Bidwell—I saw him on 1st February last at the office in Frankfort—he bought some bonds of us—he did not give any name—I produce a note of the purchase prepared by Mr. Lauteren—it was delivered to the prisoner at the time he purchased the bonds. (Read:\"1st February, 73. Koch, Lauteren & Co., 15 thousand dollars, U.S Bonds, purchased in the name of Mary Kellogg, 1865-85,—36, 656 florins interest, 1st January, 1873,—200, total 63, 856-15.\") He paid me in Frankfort bank notes—he gave no name, only Mrs. Kellogg.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. He was quite unknown to me—Mr. Lauteren attended to the purchase of these bonds—ho is not here—I was in the room close adjoining—I did not hand that paper to the man who bought the bonds—Mr. Lauteren wrote that—I had nothing to do with it—I was in the adjoining room during the cash business—I did not come over before the Lord Mayor, no one came from our house—I was asked to come about throe weeks ago—the firm were communicated with by the English Consul, and Mr. Lauteren told me I was to come over—he showed me a photograph, he showed me three, of different persons, and I was told that the person had been arrested for the Bank forgeries—I have only seen Austin Bidwell here in Court since I saw him at the office—I was here on Monday—I did not see him pointed out by the other witnesses in Court—there was no one else in the room but him and Mr. Lauteren—ours is a very busy house.\n\nBARON HUGO VON BETHMAN. I am a partner in the firm of Messrs. Bethman FrÃ¨res, of Frankfort—I know the prisoner Austin Bidwell under the name of Frederick Aldridge—I first saw him on 30th January, he came with some United States bonds, which he asked us to sell for him—we agreed to sell them for him—he was known in the house before by that name—I had not seen him myself before—the amount of bonds we were to sell was 10,000 dollars on that day—we did so—there were nine bonds of 1,000 dollars each—these are press copies of the notes—I compared the originals with the press copies—the original entry in our books was made by one of the clerks—I did not myself copy the numbers of the bonds, but I saw the clerk, Ferdinand Clemens, do it—I saw the note that he made that was given to the customer—there was an entry made in our books, and I read it, and this is a press copy of the note made out for the purchaser—I had a complaint from the purchaser that one of the bonds was a little torn, but not as to the numbers—the numbers of the nine bonds for 1,000 dollars each are 7, 447, 48 and 49, 59, 944, 82, 731 and 32, 82, 734, 59, 945, 67, 625 and two bonds of 500 dollars each, 12, 336 and 38—those were all on that day—the value in English money would be a little more than 2,000l.—this bill was given to the prisoner in part payment: (This was a bill for 500l., dated Vienna, 16th December, drawn by Kappenttole on the Russian Bank for Foreign Trade.) I saw the bill given to him—the rest was paid in paper money of the Frankfort Bank—on 1st February he called again, and he asked us to sell 10,000 dolÃ­an more of the same kind of bonds—he said that their price was somewhat higher than it had been previously, and he thought it was a very good chance of selling them at that time—he did not say hew long he had had them—it was the fact that the price was higher, certainly higher than they had been three months before—I don't remember whether they had gone up between the beginning and the end of January—I sold the second lot of 10,000 dollars for him—I have the press copy of the numbers—there were nine bonds of 1,000 dollars and two of 500—the numbers oÃ­ the 1,000 dollar bonds were 7, 445, 67, 625, 71, 628, 65, 220, 82, 725, 7, 446, 59, 909, 67, 623, 82, 733—the two of 500 were 8, 692, 12, 333—the value would be about the same, about 2,000l.—I went to the bank and got some bills for him, all of large denominations, 500 florins—I did not give him the whole amount that day—I gave him 20,000 florins in advance, and those were new bills.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. We sell a great many American bonds in Frankfort—we were not selling a great number at that time;. other kinds of bonds we were—American bonds are extensively sold—I suppose we were selling other American bonds at that time—I have not got a memorandum of those here—we were selling American bonds at that time, but not of this kind—I tore the copies out of a book to bring here—I took them out last week—I looked at the book at this entry the day the bonds were sold—I wanted to see to whom they were sold—I did not transact the business as to selling the first lot—my brother did—he is not here—I was present in the office when it was done, in the same room—I think I wrote some receipts, I know I wrote a receipt— \"the red ink on that paper was written in Germany by the clerk on the very day—the money was given to the man who got us to sell the bonds the next morning, and not by me—the cashier gave him the money—that was done in the office—I was not attending to him—I did not see the notes—when notes go into the bank they are re-issued—I saw the bill given, and I read it the very day before it was given to the purchaser—we had a great many bills in our possession that morning—I did not read them all—I made no memorandum of the bill on that occasion—I saw it given to Austin Biron Bidwell myself—I read it a few minutes before it was given to him—that bill was kept in the same place, where a great many other bills were kept, in a case—I saw my brother give him the bill—it was not put back into the case again after I read it—it was given to Bidwell who was in the next room when he read it—I looked particularly at the endorsement of the drawee—I knew the man who came by the name of Aldridge—he never told me himself that that was his name.\n\nRe-examined. I did not hear any order given to put the endorsement of Spaulding on the bill; it was done after I gave the bill—we indorsed the bill to Charles G. Brown—I have no doubt this is the bill that was given to Austin Bidwell.\n\nBIAS SCHWARTZCHILD. (Interpreted.) I carry on a banking and exchange business, at Frankfort—I believe I recognise the two Bid wells—I knew George Bidwell as H. E. Gilbert—I saw him at Frankfort first on the 13th or 14th October—he gave me an order to sell some American bondsAustin Bidwell gave me an order to buy some American Six per Cent, bonds for Mrs. W. Hall; I think that was in January—there were two or three lots—the second lot was a day or two afterwards—I can't tell you from memory what time in January the first lot was bought—the value of the bonds was about 5,000 dollars altogether—he gave me Dutch bank notes and Frankfort notes—I did not know Austin by any name at that time—I found the name on a note or bill—I did not know his name when I had the transaction with him about the bills—I have an open business, a shop, and he walked into the shop and did the business.\n\nCross-examined by MR. MCINTYRE. The man was a stranger to me.\n\nJOSEPH BUCKHEIM. (Interpreted.) I was formerly a c"
