        "text": "My name is Robert Cameron and my life has certainly been an interesting journey so far. Born into a farming family at Wurdi Boluc, which is more of an area than a town, famous for the large Barwon Water Reservoir that supplies the South Western suburbs of Geelong. It was a wonderful childhood with so much fun and activity on limited resources, but a 365 acre playground.\n\nWhile living in Keith in South Australia in 2012 I answered an advertisement for volunteer presenters at a community radio station (5TCB) in nearby Bordertown, inheriting a Saturday morning sport show. That lead to calling local football matches on 5TCB and interviewing some very high profile sporting identities. Almost immediately, I became hooked on the medium and upon returning to Geelong in 2015, I was able to continue my passion at 94.7 The Pulse.\n\nA chance opportunity to co-host a couple of programs on community radio in 2007 has led me to a passion for broadcasting.\n\nIn early 2008, I was given the chance to host a monthly music program - Radio Ga Ga - on 94.1FM WBC in suburban Melbourne. After presenting the program for ten years, and having relocated to Geelong, I was able to pick up the same format, change the program name to Turn Up Your Radio and present it on a weekly basis on 94.7 The Pulse, here in my new home town.\n\nIn early 2020, with a COVID-induced program reshuffle on The Pulse, I was given the opportunity to co-host a weekly Saturday morning with Rob Cameron - The 2 Blokes Chatting Radio Show. Initially intended to be a be a temporary fill-in show for a \"few weeks till we get past COVID\", the program has become entrenched in the weekly roster with well over 100 programs presented."
