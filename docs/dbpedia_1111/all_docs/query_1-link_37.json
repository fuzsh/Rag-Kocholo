        "text": "This paper argues that immediately after the defeat of France in June 1940 the Germans missed an opportunity to engage Spain on their side, and possibly close Gibraltar to the British. For a variety of reasons, Hitler missed a potential opportunity that might have dramatically altered the course of the war.\n\nThe role that Italy played in the Holocaust of the Jews of Thessaloniki has not been documented. Jewish Greeks of Thessaloniki and other nearby locales did not benefit either by Italian or Spanish Diplomacy and the Diplomats. The unfortunate indirect role that Italy played in the Annihilation of Jewish Greeks will be demonstrated. The adaptability, along with the fortunes of war, and, consequently, its interpretation at will by the Spanish Administration, of the Spanish Citizenship (its rights and privileges) of Jewish Thessalonikians is also demonstrated. It is regrettable that the self–evident and obvious duty of a Country – State to protect its own citizens had to be transubstantiated into and elevated to the realm of Humanity and Saving and Rescue. Includes Update and Addenda Section (September 2017) and download link for the full Proceedings published end 2016\n\nMy article (pp.290-300) deals with Holocaust memory, its distortion and the meaning of its commemoration in Turkey. The entire book is about a trans-national, comparative perspective on the varied reactions of the neutral countries to the Nazi persecution and murder of the European Jews. It examines the often ambivalent policies of these states towards Jewish refugees as well as towards their own Jewish nationals living in German-occupied countries. By breaking down persistent myths, this volume contributes to a more nuanced understanding of an under-researched chapter of Holocaust history and also considers the challenges and opportunities related to Holocaust education and remembrance in the neutral countries.\n\nOn 25 July 1936, Hitler’s Germany began an interventionist program in Spain on behalf of the insurgent Nacionales, under the leadership of General Francisco Franco. The relationship between Nazi Germany and Nationalist Spain was realpolitik state craft. The use of monetary wealth, diplomatic skill, and military assistance by Nazi Germany went to the prevention of communism and to shift the balance of power in Europe to favor those actively fighting against communism. The Nationalist Government and Nazi Germany stressed their sovereign rights to territory and citizens within the conflict, affirming themselves continuously as independent states. Therefore, Spain proceeded in realpolitik relations with Germany for Spanish interests, and vice versa for Germany. Nationalist interests were to administrate the Spanish state and remove all external influence. Germany’s interests were to shift the balance of power in Europe to its favor and the rearmament program by gaining raw material from Spain."
