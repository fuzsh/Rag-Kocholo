        "text": "Darlinghurst Theatre Co/ Eternity Playhouse\n\n4 Sep – 4 Oct\n\nPlays by Jane Bodie\n\nDirected By Anthony Skuse\n\nPhoto credit – Robert Catto\n\nPerformed by Tom O’Sullivan, Emma Palmer, Aaron Glenane, Gabrielle Scawthorn\n\nSynopsis thoughts from the programmes Director’s Notes –\n\nBoth plays are concerned with how we negotiate relationships, how we use those relationships to garner a sense of identity. They are all striving to be the best versions of themselves as they dance around each other. Most of the time authenticity eludes them as they perform compromised versions of themselves.\n\nReview –\n\nYou know the saying, ‘Save the best ’till last?’ it’s a common and well used phrase for a myriad of possible excitable notions towards the expectation of something delicious, fun, or just plain old school fantastic. When leaving the Eternity Playhouse, mentally and mind fully chewing on the rather unctuous amount of theatre I had witnessed in playwright Jane Bodie’s paired up play’s Ride & Fourplay. My first impulsive thoughts don’t often make the first paragraph in my final draft, but as I stepped out into the night air, my first thought stuck like super glue to skin and that is, ‘I can not leave the best till last.’ I have to talk about THAT straight way!’ I just can’t discuss these plays in chronological order of appearance, I have to start talking about Fourplay, Ride won’t get as high an acclaim for reasons I will explain later in my review. But for now, I just can’t wait to discuss the second part of this theatre experience. So here goes.\n\nRenown English theatre director Peter Brook wrote in the opening lines of his book ‘The Empty Space’, regarding the definition of theatre. I quote, “I can take any empty space and call it a bare stage. A man walks across this empty space whilst someone else is watching him, and this is all that is needed for an act of theatre to be engaged.” This was the very first thing I thought when Fourplay began. The simplistic, raked stage now striped of all its set dressing and naturalism from Ride leaving essentially (with a stylistic twist) an empty space, with two women and two men walking from corner to corner, past one another with sparse physical contact whilst thoroughly engaging their audience, hello minimalism, hello performer focused art, hello my kind of theatre. When I review a show, I am hugely interested in audience actor dynamics, how the audience engage mentally and emotionally by closely observing their physical engagement to what occurs on stage. Hooked, is the word to best describe the audience during Fourplay, hooked I was also, thrilled in fact that director Anthony Skuse chose to run with Bodie’s stage suggestion that this play can be played non naturalistically. It makes her strict note that characters Alice and Jack are to be played naturalistically throughout the work all the more poignant and powerful. Bodie’s mindfulness in regards to structure, form and manipulation of time (as mentioned by Skuse in his director’s notes) makes Fourplay a structural intrigue to watch and I can only assume an intriguing directing opportunity. Fourplay is LIVING proof that great writing can carry an audience from A-Z and on the edge of their seats with out the need to set design show-off, which has exhausted me this year and unimpressed me greatly by some of our prominent theatre companies. This coupled with a director with sound judgement, clear objectives and actors whom have encapsulated their characters beautifully thanks to a specific structural method in style and writing by Bodie, makes for a refreshing, gorgeous approach to theatre making that is foundationally built on equal respect for the written word and trust in director, actors and the creative body as a whole. This play speaks beyond the naturalistic situations of relationships and provides a much more diverse ratio of meaning. Simply, the lack of physical contact, eye contact and typical architectural flesh responses that were forced to be individual made for a much deeper exploration of self as a viewer. This restriction too I feel assisted the actors to not knee jerk react physically in response to each other, but instead instilled focus and purpose in their movement which made for a richer experience as an audience member. The disconnection from naturalism made the intimate moments that were purposefully naturalistic physically poetic. What we would consider a generic intimate response felt brand new because we were deprived of it consistently throughout. As Bodie even mentions out of the mouth of her character Natasha, ‘ There is nothing interesting about a love story. It’s been done to death’ What is interesting about Bodie’s writing and Skuse’s direction is that it is approached from a quirky angle and cleverly so. There is absolutely nothing in Fourplay we haven’t all seen before. In fact it is a cliche super nova in content, but in style and execution it feels as if we are being exposed to something brand new. I dare say, but with conviction that Fourplay is reminiscent of Pop Art. It is the everyday basics on display, the object itself is so common it’s almost invisible but the technique and approach towards it makes it somehow, fascinating, like we are seeing it for the first time.\n\nAaron Glenane who played Jack in Fourplay seemed right at home in this production, his performance was a stand out for me. Glenane has a naturalistic ability to physically express his character with no sense of striving or strain. Glenane produced a character that was likeable, humorous and most of all genuine. Glenane formed a quick and potent connection with his audience, a very talented performer, a craftsman in his field, I loved his performance. Gabrielle Scawthorn, as Alice gave a performance with her characters heart plucked, in hand and bleeding for all to see, she ebbed and flowed between heart ache, sarcasm and humour with breeze, beautifully and believable. Tom O’Sullivan, as Tom, wove for us a tapestry of a character full of bewilderment, lust, selfishness, little boy straits and elements of boy trying to be man. O’Sullivan is clearly a committed actor, and his performance reflected the at times tongue in cheek aspects of an actors process discussed in the writing and ran with it well. His times of stillness with in this piece though I felt could have been more complimentary by providing his audience with less of the ‘I-am-man-contemplating-my-fate-in-silence’ stance that took so much of his focus it felt forced most of the time, it felt like acting. More of nothing would have been preferred, not trying to be stillness. Just being stillness. Considering his character responses to questions thrown at him by Scawthorns’s character Alice felt reminiscent of Tony Abbott interviews, careless, flippant and inconsiderate to circumstance. I doubt much fluid thought went through his characters mind in silence either. It was as if O’Sullivan was trying to bring some nobility or pride to his character which felt against his characters nature and maturity level. O’Sullivan though performed with tremendous gusto in Fourplay. Emma Palmer, played the ‘sassy’ flirtatious, confident, controlling character Natasha. Palmer exudes her natural confidence on stage as a performer. She brought a lot of fun and charisma making for a desired shift of feeling from heartbreak to, I don’t give a fuck I’ll do what I want. We all find ourselves there at some point, and it was fun to see this character played in this manner. Even when she was observing her fellow actors in her moments of solitude or stillness she retained this manner that was consistent of her character. Her expressions were a dialogue all on their own. Palmer’s character on paper comes across as rather unbearable at times, but Palmer avoided any eye-roll by playing Natasha with a self-confidence and assurance as an audience member you couldn’t argue with. Her choices were nonchalant, and care-free which made me as an audience member not to feel malice toward the archetype being played but instead accepting her for her archetype and letting it be, which assisted in enjoying her character instead of despising or brushing her off as a pretentious tart. Fourplay was just wonderful, worth sitting through Ride to get to it.\n\nRide, I’m not going to dive into this Bodie play nearly as much as I have with Fourplay, as it did very little for me. Two straight people drunk, with memory loss and emotional baggage, naked in a bed, wake up with hang overs galore, attempt to decode the night before and perhaps each others secrets. The given circumstances didn’t thrill me, and characters Elizabeth and Joe and all the talk of Marrickville/Tempe, known clubs, pubs of Kings Cross and Sydney didn’t engage me either. Though both Palmer as Elizabeth, and O’Sullivan as Joe both performed fine, it felt like the context didn’t particularly motivate them to any kind of performance beyond comfort, it felt safe. All I wanted to see happen was Elizabeth to leave Joe’s room. I didn’t feel like it was played out or written in a way strong enough to keep her in that room for the possible 14-18 hours that took place from the start of the play to the end.\n\nFourplay, plays out with potential and with room to grow to explore the text and feels like it retains more possibilities as a play. Ride on the other hand is restricted, measured and limited. Bodie is an excellent playwright whom has a comfortable relationship with dialogue that transfers beautifully into characters who are down to earth, relatable and plausible. Ride & Fourplay are two very different plays to which some adjustment is required to enjoy them accordingly and in their respective genres.\n\nPulse Group Theatre\n\n7-26 July\n\nPlay by Craig Wright\n\nDirected by Billy Millonis\n\nPerformed by Joseph Addabbo, Jeremy Shadlow, Dudley Hogarth and Nikki Waterhouse\n\nSynopsis –\n\nChristian sweet hearts since Bible Camp, and wide-eyed married couple, Steve and Sara, put their livelihood on the line when they move from Minnesota to Florida to pursue Steve’s dream of opening up his own chain of gospel themed motels.\n\nBut when Steve’s plan starts to head on a downwards path, and Sara finds herself captivated by their neighbour Sam, an ex NASA researcher whose past has left him both figuratively and physically wounded, their perfections and faith are put to the ultimate test of fate.\n\nReview –\n\nGrace is the Actors Pulse Studios first inaugural production, which is great for the independent circuit which now has one more potential space to produce their work. Though there was nervous energy in the air with a slightly late curtain up, the nerves in the corridors did not translate onto the quaint Pulse Studios space. A terrifically cast production by director Billy Millonis, it was refreshing to experience well embodied text that translated into this casts physicality wonderfully, there was a true sense of diligence to their characters physical language not just their dialogue, it felt real and utterly believable, and not lazy which seems to be a common ‘thing’ in a lot of theatre I have seen lately.\n\nJoseph Addabbo, plays evangelical business man, ready to build a host of Christian chain motels, Steve. Addabbo’s character has a relentless tactless drive about him, his saving souls mission and will to extract finances from whoever comes his way to help his own road to success makes for an eyebrow raising kind of character. Addabbo made this sneaky character impressively funny. My only gripe with these evangelical characters (in general) that are written into plays; un certain if it is in the text or it is a director/actor choice, is that they are always portrayed with a real sense of hyper reality/twilight approach in mannerisms and delivery. It maybe the result of researching evangelical preachers online or Christian TV perhaps and maybe not ever having personal encounters with evangelical christians in reality that causes this kind of person to be portrayed to an audience as members of society who are living in a bubble and on another planet to everyone else. I don’t think I have ever seen a ‘Evangelical Christian’ portrayed with out cultish perspective. It doesn’t make for an interesting watch in that regards as audiences seem to automatically get told that THIS character isn’t ‘normal’ this character has a warped sense about themselves, the world and others. Which is probably true in essence perhaps but makes for a very one-sided linear person. It would be far more interesting to see this kind of character less animated and caricatured, it would also make for a more grounded performance making the dramatic peaks more unexpected, and relatable giving an audience means to decide for themselves this characters social standing and human right. In saying that Addabbos performance was passionate and enjoyable to watch, I just craved a different angle than the same old angle that is taken with these “hallelujah” characters that causes audiences to alienate or write off the character too quickly.\n\nNikki Waterhouse, played the ever lovely and obedient wife Sara with clarity and charm. Waterhouse was delightful to watch, her presence and subtle approaches to physicality were genuine and lovely. I highly enjoyed watching her portray this character, she was captivating with a wonderful grip on naturalism. Waterhouse was gentle with her character making the moments where she punched it up a notch in dramatic tension evermore emotionally tangible for her audience making her character easy to believe and easy to love regardless of her characters naivety and weakness. Waterhouse is a talented actor who I wish to see more of in the future.\n\nJeremy Shadlow as the suffering and scarred neighbour Sam gave a hugely heartfelt performance, a beautiful ying-yang of gentleness and anger within his emotional and physical portrayal of this broken character. Shadlow and Waterhouse had a great chemistry on stage that made for an intimate performance that was blush worthy and real. Shadlow gave a performance like a Bull in a fighting pit, a calculated and powerful performer.\n\nDudley Hogarth, who plays an elderly German pest exterminater showed both his comical and dramatic abilities, giving the audience the best of both worlds making them laugh and successfully taking each of us on a storytelling journey that reveals horrific circumstances that pulled at the heart-strings. Hogarth is a seasoned performer whose wealth of theatrical experience and capabilities as an actor made his character a favourite and a crowd pleaser.\n\nDirector Billy Millonis did a good job in a space that is quite restricting architecturally. His staging choices at the beginning were a little unclear, as the one space which is left unchanged throughout was used as two separate apartments with characters walking in the space, sitting next to each other and moving in the space together but not necessarily in the same apartment as such. It didn’t take long to figure out that there were times his direction indicated they were in separate spaces and not in the same apartment together, it took a little figuring out. Once this was established it was much easier to understand what was taking place, the subtlety of this could have been tweaked slightly with stronger lighting choices right from the get-go as it was a little foggy at the start. The only other part of the production that made it lose its impact and rhythm was the scene changes which went on for extended periods of time that were slightly unbearable and interrupted the audiences focus which had them chatting between scene changes…not an ideal or wanted situation.\n\nOverall I was pleasantly surprised by Pulse Group Theatres first production in that space to the public. Grace is a well written play by Craig Wright with interesting characters and a gripping narrative. Strong casting by Millonis with strong believable performances from a gracious and committed cast. An enjoyable production all round.\n\nPinchgut Opera\n\nAngel Place Recital Hall\n\n4-8 July\n\nMusic by Antonio Vivaldi (1735)\n\nLibretto by Agostino Piovene\n\nConducted by Erin Helyard, directed by Thomas De Mallet Burgess, designed by Alicia Clements\n\nSung and performed by Hadleigh Adams, Christopher Lowrey, Emily Edmonds, Russell Harcourt, Helen Sherman & Sara Macliver\n\nwith the Orchestra of the Antipodes\n\nPhoto credit: Keith Saunders\n\nSynopsis – The action takes place in the Royal Palace where Tamerlano is holding the defeated Turkish sultan Bajazet prisoner, in the days immediately following the Tartar victory over the Ottoman Empire\n\nReview – Pinchgut Opera are a dynamic young opera company whose mandate is to put very rarely heard of operas into the spotlight. I love how Pinchgut started out, over a cup of coffee with people passionate about their craft who had an idea, pulled a team together and just made it happen. This and their desire to expose Australian audiences to rarely performed ancient pieces is interesting and exciting. Their wish to allow the music be the hero and the set to be a non invasive support to the music, is also different for opera which as a whole as an art form is often extravagant in set and costume design. Reading up on Pinchgut was a rather refreshing discovery!\n\nBajazet is a story of power, empire, love, war and the survival of the fittest. Watching the story unfold was a captivating historical reminder that the times of 1735 (as when this opera was written) was full of such a vastly different set of social and political laws making those times seem like a fairytale. It had me thinking about audience perspective and how modern, current, gripping, maybe even edgy this would have been for an audience in those days who would have been influenced socially by this kind of story. I wondered how it would have moved them emotionally and what the impact would have been on them compared to us 21st century folk whom live with a whole other set of immediate and distant concerns individually and socially. Opera is a powerful art form, it is not everyone’s taste but it is impossible not to appreciate its ability to allure, captivate and transcend understanding through physical gesture and song. Like most music does it touches that mysterious core that lies in all of us soul and spirit.\n\nBajazet in the hands of conductor Erin Helyard was a real treat. Helyard in appearance and composure brought a youthfulness and unique style all of his own that beautifully contrasted the ancient instruments played by the talented Orchestra of the Antipodes. Helyard was sensational to watch, his conducting style caressed and snapped Vivaldi’s engaging score masterfully. Conducting has always fascinated me, this physical direction of soft sways, small beats and intricate commands for singer and for musician that completely inform how the music is interpreted and performed. Helyard did a hell of a job at not only branding this piece with his own unique pizzazz he honoured the ancient nature of the piece.\n\nBajazet too had a smorgasboard of fine opera singers whose individual capacity and vocal artistry was liquid silk to the ear. The dedication in performance and skill was breathtaking to witness especially when one does not see as much opera as one would hope, like myself, it makes the experience that much more heightened and brilliant. Musically Bajazet holds its own, unfortunately when it comes to the production side most predominantly in set and direction it falls short quite considerably. This is my first Pinchgut production but have viewed all their videos on past shows which showcase strong reflections of their mandate that set and costume not get in the way of the music, with Bajazet this was not the case, both direction and set were very much in the way of the music and I sadly can not sing my praises like that of conductor, musicians and singers. The set got in the way all of the way through, with unneeded set dressing, vastly un used and large props such as a giant empty book shelf that said nothing and added nothing to the story. The continuous and painful moving around of props were fidgety which often distracted from the action that was taking place. It was cluttered and not well designed, the colour scheme felt lost and at times the performers seemed stifled and awkward with so much to take on and off and adjust to. The sound of plastic cups bouncing off the floor in a moment of heated drama too was cringe worthy and cheap. I also felt some of the entries and exits of cast were confusing and random as they sometimes seemed to come conventionally through a door and then float through walls or gaps in the set. It was confusing with any symbolism really lost in the unclear execution. It just didn’t bring this Opera to life, less is most definitely more which most of Pinchguts former productions have done from what I have seen strikingly well. Bajazets set gave the eye nowhere to establish itself with items like the chandelier in the second act cutting off the subtitles from the viewer, becoming an eye sore rather than a powerful symbol.\n\nBajazet is high stakes drama lead by a company of musicians and singers that take you on a historical voyage that is both culturally stimulating and speaks to the soul. It’s a shame both set and direction did not manage to make the same impression. In saying this, Pinchgut Opera are a great company worthy of their audience and your time, I love what they stand for and what they set out to achieve.\n\nPresented by LCW\n\non at The Enmore Theatre 2-18 July\n\nMusic and lyrics by Robert Lopez & Jeff Marx\n\nBook by: Jeff Whitty\n\nDirector: Jo Turner\n\nCast: Shauntelle Benjamin, Julia Dray, Kimberley Hodgson, Madeleine Jones, Owen Little, Matthew Predny, Nicholas Richard, Justin Smith, Riley Sutton and Rowena Vilar\n\nSynopsis – Avenue Q tells the timeless story of a recent college graduate trying to find his way in the world. Set in New York City all the way out on Avenue Q (he couldn’t afford anything better), we are introduced to fresh-faced Princeton as he struggles to find his purpose: meeting friends, finding love, losing love, and finding it again, along the way. Inspired by the beloved children’s show Sesame Street, Avenue Q creates a puppet-filled world that is a little more reflective of the difficult, R-rated realities that we face when we learn that real life isn’t as simple as we dreamed it might be – but perhaps, suggests Avenue Q, life is all the more colourful and worthwhile for it.\n\nReview – It’s a big Tony winning Broadway musical, it’s American satire comedy, it’s R rated puppetry. Its music is top-notch, clever, funny and a huge crowd pleaser. Avenue Q is no doubt a success story. It’s autobiographical nature by musical theatre talents Robert Lopez & Jeff Marx make this show poignantly relatable to anyone who has gone through the reality ringer of their twenty-thirty somethings. The success is in its audience palatability and the bold concept of saying, (well singing out loud and unapologetically) the taboo topics we know we all think about but don’t always discuss around a dinner table. Songs like ‘Everyone’s a Little Bit Racist’ and ‘Schadenfreude’ point out what we all can’t deny is a little bit gospel in our western society. All sung tongue in cheek and with Sesame Street influenced puppets, it is very hard to be serious about much unfolding before your eyes, it’s a complete cack! Avenue Q has been around the tracks awhile now, opening Off-Broadway in 2003, with much acclaim from American critics. I dare say specifically New York based musical theatre is often saturated in Jewish humour, which I always find kind of goes over the top of most Australian audiences and always feels way left field for an Australian audience. Regardless, this Australian cast did a smashing job at bringing this production alive crossing all their i’s and their t’s as you must with big shows like this. There is often very little room for changes, they are text-book productions. Some amendments were made to bring this American comedy a little closer to home, changing names from New York areas to audience known Sydney suburbs made original one liners go from potential flop to laugh. This was executed a few times, I can’t say I think it adds anything to the production except the cheap laugh which is understandable when a show is so far removed from its original climate. I’m sure the same methods have been done in other countries with this show, it’s not all in common. A stab at our current government got the biggest laugh of all, a tactic The Rocky Horror Picture Show also used which was received with applause by both audiences.\n\nThe comedy though entertaining does feel like it’s beginning to become a little stale, the clichés are bulging and the shock value of the lyrics, (though no doubt funny) too feel like they are beginning to lose their edge with its age. Lucky for us as Australians the humour is not lost on us due to our exposure to American comedies like Seinfeld, Everybody Loves Raymond and Friends. We are accustomed/have an understanding of the culture behind the humour. It satisfied a lot of appetites that were there for a good laugh and a good time.\n\nFor a huge show that requires a vast amount of skill levels from its actors, this Australian cast of Avenue Q outshone themselves. Each cast member presented strong vocal ability, comic timing and smooth sailing puppetry skills. It was quite evident they were all having the time of their lives on that stage with no signs of opening night nerves. Stand out performers for the night was most definitely Rowena Vilar, who played with tremendous humour Asian cliché Christmas Eve, Vilar’s vocal range and singing ability is an envious talent. She showcased her strengths as a performer and a vocalist flawlessly. Matthew Predny whose puppet friends were Princeton and Rod showed versatility and a comic timing within his puppetry that was delightfully embraced by his captivated audience. Nicholas Richard too with puppets Nicky and Trekkie, displayed an ability to disguise his voice remarkably well to that of Sesame Street stars Ernie and Cookie Monster, superbly played.\n\nMadeleine Jones, as Lucy T Slut/Kate Monster gave an equally humorous and well-rounded performance, also showcasing a strong vocal talent and puppetry ability. Julia Dray as Mrs T/Bad Idea Bear and Owen Little didn’t disappoint with their performances which were seemingly smooth sailing with strong stage presence and energy. Shauntelle Benjamin as Gary Coleman carried herself from strength to strength in her performance, she embodied the Diff’rent Strokes celebrity in her stride making for a laugh out loud performance. Familiar TV personality Justin Smith Brian brought a performance worthy of a laugh, showcasing his natural comedic ability with a comfort on stage that was grounded making for a likeable performance. A strong capable cast who showcased that Australia possesses a healthy musical theatre talent equal to their overseas peers.\n\nAll in all director Jo Turner and producer Luke Westly bit off a huge bite in undertaking a production such as this. With strong casting on their side and embracing the fun that the show represents have managed to pull together a professionally finished production they should be proud of. Though the show in itself as a book and musically feels like it’s beginning to date, you appreciate the originality of the concept and the cleverness in the shows execution. Well worth seeing purely for a laugh!\n\nSiren Theatre Company & Red Line Productions\n\nOld Fitz Theatre\n\n10-27 June\n\nDirected by Kate Gaul\n\nPerformed by Thomas Campbell\n\nSynopsis –\n\nInishfree might seem like a quaint Irish town, but fierce evangelist Thomas Magill knows better. He knows jovial Dwain Flynn is a miserable drunk, that Timmy O’Leary enslaves his lovely mother and that sweet Mrs Cleary is a blasphemous flirt.\n\nIt is down to Thomas, with God on his shoulder, to save this sinful place. But the townsfolk are not listening, an angel is misbehaving and a barking dog will not be silenced. Just how far will Thomas go in his quest for salvation?\n\nReview – Misterman, though a well written play by renowned Irish playwright Enda Walsh, one hander plays are most of the time a punish to endure, they are linear and often feel forced. It is very difficult for an actor to engage in only his/her own energy which bounces off the walls and their audience. Self engagement their only real outlet, with possible choices of breaking the fourth wall or morphing of the many characters they have to produce…It quite often always feels like a reach that never fully extends. That, or you have an actor on stage with so many jobs to do it’s like watching a game of arcade pinball.\n\nIn this production, it felt very much like watching a human pinball bounce from moment to moment and most times from mess to mess. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the writing and I love Irish plays, but one handers just never fully satisfy my theatrical palette. The stakes for the performer are very high. Thomas Campbell who performed the role of Thomas Magill, with a passionate determination and focus carried himself well considering the density of the piece, the many characters he flowed in and out of and the very dark subject matters and characteristics that emerged. The character of Thomas Magill is intriguing, the narrative full of humour and horror making for a beautiful contrasting combination in a piece of theatre.\n\nThis contrast was not well executed by director Kate Gaul whose directing felt both rushed and unclear, with the characters objectives and intentions never fully surfacing as sharply as they needed to be. Thomas’ raging evangelism spiral didn’t come through to its full potential, and though there were some bright moments that were assisted by a very comprehensive and supporting sound design by Nate Edmondson, the staging of the piece was all too much. Set design was a mixture of nostalgic nods, suggested sugar addictions and clutter, to which grew as the play continued, with the addition of falling water, biscuits and costumes falling from “the fly” of the quaint Old Fitz space. Whatever it was Gaul was trying to execute felt gimmicky. It also felt a top-heavy job for Campbell whose physical scoring echoed that he was on a time frame that he must keep up with. There was just so much going on all the time, the production felt linear and half-baked. When it came to the climax of the piece I was so exhausted from watching Campbell jump through so many hoops I didn’t even care. This show needs to be much simpler in staging, there is so much for Campbell to focus on in his character work (which needed more attention) the set and staging elements simply drowned him. Gaul has a long history of directing and well-known in her community for her productions, this show felt un polished and below the standards expected from a director of her experience. Her casting I feel for this was not all together right, a more dramaturgical based actor is needed for this calibre of writing talent.\n\nAs Gaul stated in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, I quote, “If I said it was for advanced theatregoers, I don’t think I would be lying. It’s in the tradition of everyone from James Joyce to Beckett and everyone in between. Please, if you don’t like Irish monologues, don’t come!”\n\nIf you do consider yourself an advance theatre goer, your expectations will unfortunately not be fully met in Gaul’s production of Misterman, and I agree, if you don’t like monologues perhaps give it a miss, but then again, I’m always hoping to be pleasantly surprised one day by the execution of one which is why I keep attending them. Sadly Gaul’s Misterman, missed the mark.\n\nPhoto credit: Diana Popovska\n\nDarlinghurst Theatre Company, Eternity Playhouse\n\n29 May – 5 July\n\nPlay by David Ives\n\nDirected by Grace Barnes\n\nWith Anna Houston & Gareth Reeves\n\nSynopsis – Thomas is a director struggling to cast the female lead in his new play based on the classic sadomasochistic novel Venus in Furs. Into Thomas’ audition room blows a street smart, straight talking actor who displays an uncanny command of the material. As the audition progresses, the line between play and reality blurs.\n\nReview – This is a really classy choice of production by Darlinghurst Theatre Company. What a piece of work! Playwright David Ives has written a sharp, intuitive and dynamic piece of American Theatre. Having read the script myself, the characters are so rich in value that you can’t stop reading and being engaging by the rhythm of the piece with dialogue that pops right off the page, so no surprise there that it too pops off the stage. Director Grace Barnes has done an equally dynamic job in producing the texts energy, tones and suggestions of the work, sticking true to Ives set and stage directions which very much provides just as much important information as the dialogue itself. Barnes navigated her way through this script seamlessly and casted two exceptional talents in Anna Houston and Gareth Reeves. I just love two-hander plays anyway and to have Ives script brought to life by Reeves and Houston was a real pleasure to witness.\n\nVenus In Fur is a play written by an intellectual, that is quite clear. Getting into the script did take some concentration but with no reservation towards its quality in writer and director. The American voice when it comes to plays is so vastly different from the Australian voice, it feels rooted in a wealth of literary knowledge which is then filtered through American character archetypes. With Australian plays they tend to be rooted more so in the Australian way of life, the literacy of living. So watching an American play from a writer like Ives, whom has cleverly plucked from the literary world to develop a play married with familiar archetypes, does takes some adjusting of the senses as an Australian audience member, I think anyway. It’s an education, as I am sure Australian theatre would be on an American stage. Continuing this thought, it made me consider how this could have influenced the actors in some way? Though I think Houston and Reeves did a marvellous job with character and delivery, the familiar archetypes of the “New York director”, Thomas and the “New York dishevelled girl”, Vanda didn’t sit as naturally within them as their stage reading characters Kushemski and Vanda. I wondered if the “continental” aspect of those characters felt more obtainable, recognisable or easier to play for Houston and Reeves. That Queen and country history to which we came from as Australians and New Zealanders. I say this as I believed them more in the skins of those characters, than the twilight reflections of their American characters Thomas and Vanda. Then again, that could be said too for the audience, me, perhaps I connected more with that aspect…who knows, but an observation none the less.\n\nThere were some moments where the pauses; which were few and far apart could have been drawn out more. This show is rather pacey in tempo, especially Houstons’ character who is like a mini tornado moving around the room. When pauses and silences did arise out of conflict they weren’t savoured long enough and I wished to relish with contemplation of what transpired with in those pauses just a breath longer. Minor adjustment to let those pauses breath a fraction more would make for tighter units of text adding to the power of the intentions behind the characters words and a refresher as an audience member.\n\nHouston and Reeves both produced characters of succulence and beauty, carrying themselves from moment to moment with legerity and style. Two performers who have tackled the excitement of the play as well as the intellectual crux of it with whipping abilities. Venus In Fur is the kind of play that could be seen more than once and you would pick up different references, meanings, symbolic pokes and parallel character reflected intentions, it is so dense with thought by Ives there is never a dull moment for your intellect to swim through. The intentions of the two American characters are never really fully spelt out, which again is good writing. Houston and Reeves kept this mystery alive leaving morsels for the audience to pick up and digest for themselves.\n\nVenus In Fur, is a sexy piece of theatre, produced with pleasurable effects by Barnes, Houston and Reeves. It is a play for the lace, leather, or both…in everyone.\n\nPhoto credit: Helen White\n\nSport for Jove\n\nThe Seymour Centre\n\n22nd-30th May\n\nRumour has it (as I had not yet to witness one of their shows) Sport for Jove have a reputation for producing excellent and engaging Shakespearean theatre that very much appeals to an Australian eye and ear. It is always intriguing to wonder before seeing a companys take on one of Shakespeare’s plays, how they choose to tackle it. With the experience of a director like Richard Cottrell there was little doubt that this production would have style and professional finish. And that it certainly did, it was dapper in every way stylistically speaking. The set and costumes by designer Anna Gardiner had that Great Gatsby feel to them mixed with very clear salutations to the time of Shakespeare’s living days. This was a top production, turning rumour for me into fact. Sport for Jove have a real nach for Shakespeare, the language in the mouths of the actors came naturally in delivery and through physical expression, the poetry treated like a dear friend. There was no awkward exchanges or delivery choices in vocal inflections, nothing but a natural engagement with fluid tempo and coherent understanding of what was being said and what story was unfolding before them. Cottrell has worked magic within simplicity allowing the language to shine and do the work that all great writing does naturally. Bar the obvious hero, Shakespeare, the congratulations on excellence must go towards the cast. Not only was this production cast impeccably, each actor individually provided their audience with not only a true understanding of the text within the stage which is their voices, but their abilities to engage with the comedy and the drama in such a gorgeous and contemporary manner. Their body language too had clear comprehension of the complex nature and poetry of Shakespeares’ writing. A cast who performed with great legerity solo and in unison.\n\nStand-out performances for me were Jonathan Elsom, who played various roles through-out. A seasoned performer whose decades of experience and chiselled character development gave a wealth to the performance that I considered a rare treat to witness. Elsoms’ comic timing and physical expression kept a smile on your face with a giggle often getting loose now and then due to his clever physicality and facial expression. A generous performer for both his audience and to his fellow actors. A not to be missed performance from Elsom.\n\nMichael Cullum too playing various roles through-out the piece showcased his talent to transform himself, giving each of his characters a unique platform and physical presence that had his audience lapping up every word, understood or not, it mattered not. Cullum gave a solid comical performance that made you appreciate his passion and skill within his craft. A bold, fresh performer.\n\nDarcy Brown shone like a brass penny in uniform as Solanio. Brown has a skillful way in performing that is uniquely his own. A grounded actor, his performance felt real and possessive in nature, his relationship with text made for an engaging watch that had you forgetting to blink. A true talent with a DiCaprio air about him, star quality and one to watch.\n\nDamien Strouthos gave a punchy and galloping performance as Gratiano. Strouthos clearly has a strong relationship with Shakespeare and his love for this style of theatre radiates from his performance. Strouthos showed a comfort with himself and character in the four walls of this play like no other on the stage. Strouthos highlighted both comedy and drama with fluro making for a vivid and vivacious performance.\n\nErica Lovell, as Narissa and Lizzie Schebesta, as Portia both made for an exciting watch. Both ladies gave their performances comedic flare with cheek and charm. Not a shy lash between them Schebesta and Lovell gave envious performances that were ballsy and savvy.\n\nJames Lugton, as Antonio, Chris Stalley, as Bassanio and John Turnbull, as Shylock must be applauded for their veridical performances. Their contributing talent and energy was electric and stimulating, each providing their characters with grandeur and style.\n\nAaron Tsindos, played a hilarious Prince of Morocco having his audience in fits of laughter at his characters expense. Tsindos brought a unique talent to the stage, a palpable performance with dashes of quirky expression and mesmeric mannerisms. Pip Dracakis, as Beatrice performed with elegance and contagious fervor, a lovely performance.\n\nJason Kos, as Lorenzo and Lucy Hefferman, as Jessica felt like the babies of the cast with their grips on the language and their portrayal of character. Kos gave a fine, clean performance with Hefferman feeling held back somehow in delivery. Both actors yielding an innocence as their characters token to the work, which worked fine, but wondered if more exploration could be considered towards their characters content of character.\n\nSport for Jove have developed and presented a cynosure production with a culturati cast and crew, thus making for a strong, current Shakespearean encounter. A lasting first impression, and very much living up to their reputation for excellence!\n\npresented by Lace Balloon at 107 Projects Redfern\n\n20-29th May\n\nWritten & directed by Fleur Beaupert\n\nDevised by Paul Armstrong, Kailah Cabanas, Lara Lightfoot, Abi Rayment, Robert Rhode, Eleni Schmacher and Barton Williams\n\nSynopsis:\n\na new play inspired by the story of Dr Mohamed Haneef: an Indian national working on the Gold Coast, arrested in 2007 under Australia’s anti-terrorism laws on suspicion of being connected to the attack on Glasgow Airport.\n\nIt is a story of one man’s incredible struggle, as well as the struggles we each have to face and the challenges we face as a country. How do we protect national security? And at what cost to our freedom? Who are we letting lead the conversation about race, religion and national identity? And how are we keeping them to account? What can happen, and who will step up, when the time between arrest and charge is potentially unlimited?\n\nReview: Writer/director Fleur Beaupert and her company of actors have presented us a piece of theatre that is of Australian topic within the realm of a devised state. Two, in my books relevant vehicles of artistic purpose and expression. ‘Deadtime’ is an expression, an impression and even an exploration on clear lines and the not so clear lines of control within our government and our media on hot topics such as terrorism. Again both topics are of high interest and relevant to an Australian audience. I think Beauperts’ means of delivering this information to her audience was somewhat half-baked in her writing, at times the actors felt less comfortable in the text than they did the physicality aspect of their performances. New work when first produced always has a few cracks and in need of dramaturgy, devised work even more so, textually this show needs some further attention. On the flip-side, ‘Deadtime’ was performed very much in a performance art manner with purposeful lines, shapes and good use of architecture and space. 107 projects is a blank canvas/gallery style space that was very suiting to anyone wanting to put on devised or physical performance based theatre. There were some lovely shapes to appear out of Beupert’s direction, her actors each providing some raw energy that was engaging to witness. Due to the style of writing and use of real verbatim interview transcripts in the script, it unfortunately felt rather top heavy and rather weighty and linear in delivery.\n\nBeaupert and her company made trending effort to produce dramatic effect with the devised method in physicality, soundscape and movement. For the most part they were successful in producing some interesting dynamics and spoken harmonies as a group. I did feel though that the focus was so heavily on the style of the production, some of the humanity that was required to support the text in this show was compromised. The balance of the devised vs the text created a battle between the two giving the sense that something needed to give way to one or the other, or that there needed to be a stripping back of text to support the physical story that was forming. Beaupert, took some risks in her production using quite literally deadtime in blocking out some extended silence within her script as well as a long stare between performers and audience. though I appreciated the risk this took, the choice lacked conviction and clear objective.\n\nThe performances were steady through out the show, some articulation and delivery at times needed addressing, each performer did as best they could with this current script which does hold great elements of promise. Robert Rhode played a convincing Dr. Mohamed Haneef, a grounded performance with ounces of character curiosity and flare in his delivery. Lara Lightfoot also played a news anchorman very convincingly, her news dictation and mannerisms were on point as well as her shark like drive to generate a media frenzy.\n\nAll in all, ‘Deadtime’ needs some time to figure out what needs to be workshopped and what needs to be culled. It is a script full of information that could either be re-directed in the devised nature of the piece more informatively or redirected in a more naturalistic stye texturally. Some beautiful exploration and risk in direction and performance, I’d much rather see this than dead theatre any day.\n\nPhoto credit: Jeremy Belinfante, Phyllis Wong\n\nLeichhardt Town Hall Sydney\n\nDirector: Rachel Chant\n\nPlaywright: Katie Pollock\n\nPerformers: Jennie Dibley, Nat Jobe, Alex Malone and Sarah Meacham\n\nSynopsis:\n\nIn BLUE ITALIAN, a young woman finds herself in a state of perpetual motion. Setting out on a freewheeling journey to an unknown destination, she begins a worldwide search for place, meaning, memory, family connections, love and self. Battling herself and the threads that bind her to home, she comes face to face with characters who divert, confront and entice her.\n\nIn NIL BY SEA, a man lies in a suburban street, his face split in two, his body shattered. Neighbours awake to this vision of horror visited on them from above. Who is this man? How did he get there? Will any of them claim him? An investigation into the identity of the body begins, the sharp-edged prism of doorstep gossip builds, and in the skies above, suspended in the briefest moment like Icarus before the plunge, a young man sends his prayer of hope to the world.\n\nReview: Katie Pollock is a playwright whom has a poetic way with words that make even the gruesome of circumstances come across romantic. I am choosing to highlight ‘Nil by Sea’ before ‘Blue Italian’ as my connection to this story resounded much stronger than the first performed piece. These plays have been written a decade apart and though they are strong plays in their own right you can sense how far Pollock has advanced over the ten years in her writing. Her voice is clearer and the state of the work feels veridical with a finer polish. Not to mention up to par within our Australian political and social climate making it a relatable topic to a broader audience bracket.\n\nRachel Chant did a shining job with both of these short plays. Leichhardt town hall is situated directly under a flight pathway which had airplanes pass over head every 5 minutes or so. Chant embraced this locational sound scape incorporating it into the work which rang true to both plays given circumstances. Wether the venue was chosen purposefully to utilise this natural sound scape or was embraced during the rehearsal process is a mastery choice that I found unique and engaging for the imagination of the audience. As a Sydney reviewer it is rare to see directors think outside the architecture in this way which was a refreshing twist to the norm. Rachel Chant has a unique non-naturalistic approach to her work, her and David Jackson (physical coach) directions gave the work choreographed artistic elements that breed intrigue and personal directorial style. Though the movements in ‘Blue Italian’ didn’t always translate into tangible understanding from an audience perspective they presented an inner man struggle that was engaging. The experiment was worth its weight, even if it just generated curiosity for the audience.\n\nThe relationships within ‘Blue Italian’ unfortunately did not translate to the degree you would expect. The family memories and the present unfolding of this travelling gypsy like woman did not marry or feel connected. The symbolic nature of the piece was unclear and came across as art for-arts-sake instead of useful choices to enhance the narrative. Though I enjoyed the staging, and placement as well as the physical action the story itself didn’t gel. Regardless, Chant’s style shone in this piece.\n\n‘Nil by Sea’ on the flip-side offers a simpler format of understanding for the viewer. I had seen the play reading of this work at 505 Theatre in ‘Asylum’, a multiple plays readings that reflected on the topic of asylum seekers in Australia. The actors in the reading of ‘Nil by Sea’ at 505 were stronger choices for this work in regards to the three neighbours. I didn’t feel drawn in by the three actors portraying the neighbours of this serious portrayal of an asylum seeker falling to his death from the wheel of a plane. Nat Jobe, who played the asylum seeker on the other hand gave an honest, heart-felt performance that gave the richness and intensity the work needed.\n\nThere is no doubt the performers in both of these works brought individual dynamics that made these stories come to life. Jennie Dibley, as Old Woman/Daisy gave a vivacious performance with assurance. Dibley is a passionate performer who throws herself into her characters scattering treasure into the audience with her honesty and her youthful energy. Always a delight to watch.\n\nNat Jobe, wears his heart on his sleeve in his performance as the Young Man who has dreams of a new life in a free land. Jobes’ performance is captivating and rich, his performance as Jose Matada and other small characters in Blue Italian were also fully immersed in objective and intensity. His physical comprehension and response to direction was interesting to watch.\n\nAlex Malone, as Young Woman/Dolly portrayed vulnerability within her performance and a determination in spirit that was relateable. Her character in Young Woman was scattered yet grounded. I didn’t care much for her performance in Nil by Sea but that comment goes across the board for all bar Nat Jobe in ‘Nil by Sea’. Due to the relevance of this story to us today in Australia, I expected the performances to be more connected, more genuine. They were too light hearted with thin beat changes that came across as nonchalant which I didn’t like much.\n\nSarah Meacham as, Young Girl/Dory gave a fine performance. Her youthfulness as Young Girl was fun and vivacious but translated like I said before thin and unexplored in Dory. Meacham performed with ease and appeared confident in her characters objectives. I would have liked to have seen more exploration in her physicality as a whole to bring some depth to her performance.\n\nDirector Rachel Chant and set designer/lighting designer Benjamin Brockman have teamed up well by producing a set within a unique architecture to bring Pollocks work to life in a modern, fresh and unique environment. I enjoyed these elements immensely and now expect this style from Chant in her productions. Her style puts her on the map as a director with exploration and experimentation as a forefront within her directing approach, which I respond to with a big thumbs up.\n\n‘Blue Italian & Nil by Sea’ runs at a bite sized perfect time of one hour with no interval making this a treat of a night out with performance and style worth venturing out to Leichardt to see.\n\nRunning until the 17th of May"
