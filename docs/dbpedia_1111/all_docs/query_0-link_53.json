They have a unique and entertaining energy that they bring to every show, singing a combination of their original songs, Wanna Be Up, Witch Queen of New Orleans, Kiss & Tell, Love the one you’re with, and some covers from various eras.\n\nThe girls reunited in 2006 for the national ‘Countdown Spectacular’ tour and have never looked back!A recording contract with Mushroom Records soon followed and The Chantoozies found Top 10 success with their first single ‘Witch Queen of New Orleans’. Touring extensively, they delighted audiences across the country with their hit songs – ‘Wanna Be Up’, ‘Kiss & Tell’, ‘Walk On’,‘He’s Gonna Step On You’ to name a few.\n\nThey went on to sell over 300,00 records, receiving Gold and Platinum status throughout the 80’s and 90’s."
