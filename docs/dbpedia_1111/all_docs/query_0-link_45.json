        "text": "Celebrating the release of their new single ‘Take Me In Your Arms’ The Chantoozies are embracing friends, love and good times in 2019!\n\n​\n\nBy popular demand the girls are launching their new single and playing their ‘best of’ show in 2019.\n\nWith hits such as Witch Queen, He’s Gonna Step On You Again, Wanna Be Up, Kiss n Tell and Love The One You’re With to name a few. There will be dancing, singing and it is guaranteed to be a party from the first song.\n\n​\n\nThe Chantoozies, the original party group, are celebrated as one of the country’s most dynamic female pop vocal groups. They are revered for their high energy live shows, bringing audiences to their feet from the outset and keeping them dancing right up until the end.\n\n​\n\nAfter smashing onto the scene in the mid-1980s, they become a household name thanks to a string of hits. Even when they took a hiatus to focus independently on their own projects, Australia’s love of the group never waned, so when The Chantoozies reformed and released their new material Baby It’s You and Black and Blue it was like they had never stopped touring.\n\n​\n\nNow, with the three lead vocalists – Eve von Bibra, Ally Fowler and Tottie Goldsmith – at the helm, The Chantoozies are the epitome of girl power and audiences are certainly in for a treat as these magnificent female vocalists embrace friends, love and good times!"
