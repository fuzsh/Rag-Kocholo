        "text": "For centuries right through to the 'Cossack Era' (pre-Broome) in the mid 1860s Aboriginal people on the north west coast of Australia did not dive for pearls rather they engaged in 'dry shelling' or wading at low water. The transition to 'naked diving' i.e. diving without an aids (e.g. mask, fins or snorkel) occurred at the instigation of European pearlers in mid 1868. When the number so Aborigines became inadequate, the pearlers imported 'Malays' or people from the islands north of Australia as indentured labour, continuing the naked diving tradition until the advent of the 'Broome Era' around 1883 when the 'hard hat' or diving apparatus became common. In the 20th century Indonesian troches shell divers continued the tradition, albeit with hand carved wooden goggles as their only aid.\n\nAs in several other settler colonial societies, Australia has come some way to recognising the suffering inflicted upon its First Peoples as a consequence of colonisation. Such historical reassessment of the nation’s origins has given rise to a backlash of unsettlement. Australia’s History Wars feature claims and counter claims regarding the number of Aboriginal people intentionally murdered by colonists as distinct from ‘unintentional’ Indigenous fatalities resulting from introduced infectious diseases. Following recent critiques of the ‘virgin soil’ hypothesis in context of the Columbian Exchange (for example Cameron, Catherine M., Paul Kelton, and Alan C. Swedlund, eds. 2015. Beyond Germs: Native Depopulation in North America. Tucson: University of Arizona Press.), I argue that biological determinism has similarly obscured the violence of Australian settler colonialism. Focussing on observations of a mid-nineteenth century outbreak of smallpox in Australia’s Northwest, I seek to expand the horizons of debates concerning the scope and extent of settler colonial violence to include the appraisal of introduced diseases as a form of structural violence.\n\nS nce the late 1880s, Greeks have been nvolved n Austral an pearl ng — n t ally n the pearl shell ndustry and then n pearl cult vat on. The s gn ficant strength of the Greek contr but on to Austral an pearl ng far outwe ghed the actual numbers nvolved. Key Greek nd v duals, fam l es and reg onal groups who are featured nclude: Mary Dakas (nee Paspal s), most probably Austral a’s only Greek female pearl lugger operator; her brothers M chael and N cholas, of whom the latter went on to establ sh the nternat onally renowned Paspaley Pearl ng Company; Den s George, whose research and exper ments were p votal to the development of pearl cult vat on n Austral a; M chael G. Ka l s, who establ shed Broome’s first successful pearl farm; the Har tos brothers, George, Jack and N cholas, who were part of the attempt to rev ve Austral an pearl ng after World War II; and the p oneer ng early Kastellor z an pearlers who were later followed n the 1950s by crews from another Dodecanese sland, Kalymnos."
