        "text": "The Chantoozies (Ally Fowler and EvE von Bibra) continue to wow audiences with their dynamic blend of pop and rock. The last few years have seen ‘one of Australia’s hottest bands’ release new singles, ‘Baby It’s You’, and more recently ‘Take Me In Your Arms’. They have appeared on countless TV & radio shows and performed around the country. Often, as part of the Gold FM concert series or a more recent highlight, The Big Red Bash, with Midnight Oil and Kasey Chambers.\n\n​\n\nCollectively and individually The Chantoozies have contributed to Australia’s rich music, film, television and theatre culture. They have a unique and entertaining energy that they bring to every show, singing a combination of their original songs, Wanna Be Up, Witch Queen of New Orleans, Kiss & Tell, Love the one you’re with, and some covers from various eras.\n\nThe girls reunited in 2006 for the national ‘Countdown Spectacular’ tour and have never looked back!\n\n​\n\nA recording contract with Mushroom Records soon followed and The Chantoozies found Top 10 success with their first single ‘Witch Queen of New Orleans’. Touring extensively, they delighted audiences across the country with their hit songs – ‘Wanna Be Up’, ‘Kiss & Tell’, ‘Walk On’,‘He’s Gonna Step On You’ to name a few.\n\n​\n\nThey went on to sell over 300,00 records, receiving Gold and Platinum status throughout the 80’s and 90’s."
