This Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants had to appear at just this time, for our contemporary society has need of such a work. This need is connected with the spiritual and material dilemma of our times. It is not necessary to list all of the things that are no longer right in our world. But we can mention some: in the spiritual domain, materialism, egoism, isolation, and the absence of any religious foundation; on the material level, environmental destruction as a result of technological development and overindustrialization, the ongoing depletion of natural resources, and the accumulation of immense fortunes by a few people while the majority become increasingly destitute. These ominous developments have their spiritual roots in a dualistic worldview, a consciousness that splits our experience of the world into subject and object. This dualistic experience of the world first emerged in Europe. But it had already been at work in the Judeo-Christian worldview, with its god that sits enthroned above creation and humankind, and his admonition to \"subdue . . . and have dominion ... over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\" This is now occurring at a terrifying rate. A change for the better will come about only when a general shift in consciousness takes place. Our fractured consciousness, which Gottfried Benn characterized as a \"fateful European neurosis,\" must be replaced by a consciousness in which creator, creation, and created are experienced as a unity. All means and all ways that will help lead to a new and universal spirituality are worthy of support. Chief among these is meditation, which can be enhanced and intensified through a variety of methods, including yogic practices, breathing exercises, and fasting, and through the appropriate use of certain drugs as pharmacological aids. The drugs I am referring to belong to a special\n\ngroup of psychoactive substances that have been characterized as psychedelics and, more recently, as entheogens (psychedelic sacraments). These effect an enormous stimulation of sensory perceptions, a decrease or even neutralization of the I-Thou boundary, and alterations in consciousness in the form of both sensitization and expansion. The use of such psychedelic drugs within a religio-ceremonial framework was discovered among Indian tribes in Mexico at the beginning and in the middle of the twentieth century. This sensational discovery led to ethnobotanical investigations to remote areas around the world to search for psychoactive plants, the results of which were documented in numerous publications and pictures. The encyclopedic compilation of ancient knowledge and new discoveries about psychoactive plants that is in your hands was produced by a well-qualified author who has contributed important new insights on the basis of his own fieldwork. It is an undertaking of great value. Disseminating knowledge about psychoactive plants, together with the proper ways to use them, represents a valuable contribution within the context of the many and growing attempts to bring about a new, holistic consciousness. Transpersonal psychology, which is becoming ever more important in psychiatry, pursues the same goal within a therapeutic framework. The holistic perspective is more easily practiced on living nature than on the inanimate objects created by humans. Let us look into a living mandala instead, such as that found in the calyx of a blue morning glory, which is a thousand times more perfect and beautiful than anything produced by human hand, for it is filled with life, that universal life in which both the observer and the observed find their own individual places as manifestations of the same creative spirit. ALBERT HOFMANN, PH.D. SUMMER 1997\n\nPreface My grandmother taught me many wise things that I have followed my entire life. In particular, her saying \"An ounce of practice is worth a pound of theory\" has had a considerable influence upon me and made it much easier to follow the path that has led me to the psychoactive plants. It was during the 1967 \"Summer of Love,\" when I was ten years old, that I first heard of hashish. I was listening to the radio. A menacing voice spoke of the \"horrible dangers\" that were descending upon our imperiled youth with the \"new wave of drugs\" from the United States. The picture that continues to dominate our drug policies was sketched out in dramatic fashion: Hashish was a gateway drug that inevitably, even compellingly, led to death from a golden shot of heroin. This was terrible news! But by that time I had already learned that I should not trust my teachers or the conservative politicians. I instinctively felt that the voice on the radio was lying. As a result of that broadcast, I yearned for nothing more than finally to try hashish myself (my experiments with cigarettes were already behind me, and I had noticed that I could not find any use or enjoyment there). At that time, it was not as easy to obtain hashish as it is today. Two years went by before I had my first opportunity. Up until then, I had only smoked dried banana peels and inhaled chloroform that I had synthesized myself. One morning, on the school bus, an older student walked down the aisle and whispered, \"Hash, hash, anyone want hash?\" \"I do!\" I cried, barely able to contain my joy and excitement. Back then, one gram cost about 3.50 marks (roughly one U.S. dollar), my entire allowance. But what does money mean when we're talking about the fulfillment of a two-year-old dream? With the hashish in my pocket, I sat through my classes, bored to death as usual, waiting for the time when I would finally make it back home. After the ordeal of school, the time had finally come. I stood at home with my precious stash and pondered the best way to smoke it. Tobacco was not an option, for I genuinely disliked it. I went into the kitchen, saw a small bag of dried peppermint leaves, and immediately knew that I had found the appropriate admixture. I pedaled my bike into the nearby forest, stuffed a pipe full of mint and hashish, and lit it up. I immediately sensed that this mixture was easy to inhale, a wonderful contrast to those disgusting cigarettes.\n\nAlthough the effects were mild, they were enough to make me want to continue my experiments. The next time, I went into the forest with a friend and we smoked the pipe together. An incredible sense of mirth overwhelmed us, and we almost split our sides with laughter. I now know that my quest to obtain hashish and my deliberations as to what it could best be combined with marked the beginnings of my ethnopharmacological research. Today, I still search for psychoactive plants in all corners of the world and experiment with them until I have had meaningful experiences with them and learned what I could from them. And I still feel that I am being lied to when the media and the politicians talk about \"drugs\" and \"narcotics,\" and I think to myself, \"Oh, if only you too had smoked a nice pipe of hashish when you were twelve; so many problems could have been avoided!\" During my fieldwork in Nepal, I learned that the three fundamental evils of existence are hate, envy, and ignorance. The tantric doctrine has developed a number of methods for becoming aware of these evils and overcoming them by means of altered states of consciousness. It is my hope that all people—especially the politicians and the psychiatrists of Western countries—will one day understand that ignorance is one of the main reasons behind the catastrophic condition of our Mother Earth! During my extended journeys to the various continents, I have seen time and again how people in all cultures, and of all social strata, religions, and skin colors, consume psychoactive plants and psychoactive products. Why do people ingest psychoactive substances? Because a fundamental drive for inebriation, ecstasy, blissful sleep, knowledge, and enlightenment is written right into our genes. While working on the manuscript of this book, I realized that it would be my first \"life work.\" The results of twenty years of research and experience are compiled in this work. I have collected information all over the world, assembled a large and specialized library, attended countless meetings and symposia, photographed my way through the plant world, and experimented with as many psychoactive plants as I could. The knowledge I have gained has now been distilled and organized into this encyclopedia.\n\n\"Thoughts are free,... for my thoughts tear the fences and walls asunder....\" GERMAN FOLK SONG\n\nIntroduction Every day, most people in most cultures, whether Amazonian Indians or western Europeans, ingest the products of one or more psychoactive plants. Even the Mormons, who claim that they do not use \"drugs,\" have a psychoactive stimulant: Mormon tea (Ephedra nevadensis), which contains the very potent alkaloid ephedrine, the model substance for amphetamine. The use of psychoactive substances is extraordinarily common in the countries of South America. After rising, a typical Amazonian Indian will drink guarana, cacao, or mate (and sometimes all three together). After breakfast, he will place the first pinch of coca in his mouth, where, periodically renewed, it will remain until evening. In the afternoon, he will shift to a fermented beverage made of maize or manioc. In late afternoon, some powder that contains tryptamines may be snuffed into the nose. Ayahuasca is often used in the evening. It goes without saying that every free minute is filled with the smoking, chewing, sniffing, or licking of tobacco. Among the Tukano Indians, the use of psychoactive plants is mythologically associated with the origins of the world. The Sun Father was a paye, a shaman, who gave the shamans of our time all of their knowledge and abilities. At the beginning of the world, he carried in his navel viho, a snuff obtained from the bark of the parica tree (Virola spp.). The ayahuasca vine came into the world through his daughter. As she was lying in labor, one of her fingers broke off. The midwife at her side took the finger and guarded it in the maloca, the cosmic roundhouse. A young man who saw this stole the finger. He buried it, and the ayahuasca liana grew from that spot. Another daughter of the Sun Father was also heavy with child. As she writhed about in the pains of labor, one of her fingers broke off as well. This time, the midwife took the finger and buried it herself. This gave rise to the first coca plant. Because these plants are associated with the origins of the world, they are considered sacred. In the modern Western world, the use of psychoactive plant products is very widespread, but their sacredness has been profaned. How many of us today, when we are sipping our morning coffee, are aware that the Sufis venerated the coffee bush as a plant of the gods and interpreted the stimulating effects of caffeine as a sign of God's favor? Who of us, lying in bed and smoking the first cigarette of the day, knows that tobacco is regarded as a gift of the gods that aids shamans in journeying into other realities? How many recall the frenzied Bacchanalia in honor of\n\nDionysos as they drink a glass of wine with their lunch? And the evening beer in front of the television is downed without any knowledge of the sacred origin of this barley drink. Our ancestors, however, the Germanic peoples and the Celts, knew this, and they venerated such drinks and immortalized them in their poetry: It is certain that the Celts knew of alcohol. The Greek and Roman authors of antiquity regarded them as passionate lovers of inebriating beverages. Drunkenness is a common theme in the epics, especially in Ireland. Gods and heroes competed with one another in their sheer unquenchable thirst for alcohol, whether in the form of wine, beer, or hydromel, the Celtic mead we still remember today. No religious festival was celebrated without an uninhibited drinking bout, a tradition which survives in our time in the form of (supposedly) folk customs. The most important aspect of such rituals is the lifting off, the unleashing, by means of which one forgets that man is an earmbound being. (Markale 1989,203) Indeed, it is this lifting off, this fact of getting \"high,\" the unleashing, the ecstasy, that is at the heart of the use of psychoactive plants and psychoactive products. This encyclopedia is a testimony to the wealth of knowledge that humans have acquired about these substances. Through proper use and proper knowledge, we too—like our ancestors—may learn to once again recognize the sacred nature of inebriants and utilize these to have profound experiences of the sacredness of nature.\n\n\"The peculiar, mysterious longing and desire for stimulants that is common to almost all peoples has, to the extent that we are aware of historical traditions, always prevailed and been satisfied in the most varied of ways. Inducing a happy mood in which the emotions, sorrows, and everything else that may weigh upon the soul can be forgotten, shifting into a state of partial or completely absent consciousness in which the individual, detached from the present, surrounded by the glowing and shining images of an excessively amplified imagination, becomes free from the misery of his every day life or from bodily pains, artificially inducing peace and sleep for the fatigued body and mind in all cases where these necessary requirements for life cannot be brought about in the normal manner, and finally the wish to gain creative strength, both physically and mentally, by means of these stimulantsthese are the primary reasons why these agents are used.\" Louis LEWIN USER PIPER METHYSTICUM (1885,1)\n\nWhat Are Psychoactive Plants? Psychoactive plants are plants that people ingest in the form of simple or complex preparations in order to affect the mind or alter the state of consciousness. Consciousness is an energy field that can expand, shift amorphously like an amoeba through the hidden corners of the world, dissolve in the ocean of desire, or crystallize in geometric clarity. Through the use of psychoactive plants and products, consciousness can be paralyzed, subdued, and contained; it can also be animated, stimulated, and expanded. Because psychoactive plants affect the mind, they have been characterized as mind-moving substances. The renowned Berlin toxicologist Louis Lewin (1850-1929) referred to\n\n\"Only plants had consciousness. Animals got it from them.\" DALE PENDELL PHARMAKO/POEIA (i995)\n\nIntroduction \"Every life's heart and desire Burns with greater rapture, flickers more colorfully, I welcome every inebriation, I stand open to all torments, Praying to the currents, taken with them Into the heart of the world.\" HERMANN HESSE VERZUCKUNG [RAPTURE] (1919)\n\nall those substances that produce some sort of psychoactive effects as phantastica. Carl Hartwich (1851-1917), a pharmacist, described them as \"human means of pleasure.\" Timothy Leary (1920-1996) preferred to speak of them as neurobotanical substances. Today, the terms psychotropic (\"influencing the psyche\") and psychopharmacologic (\"affecting the mind\") are often used to refer to these substances. In the pharmacological literature, which commonly refers to them as mind-altering substances, psychoactive substances are clearly and systematically classified by precise scientific definitions (cf. Inaba and Cohen 1994; Seymour and Smith 1987; Wagner 1985): Jt Stimulants (\"uppers\") This category comprises substances that wake one up, stimulate the mind, incite the initiative, and may even cause euphoria but that do not effect any changes in perception. Among the most important plants in this category are coffee, tea, cacao, guarana, mate, ephedra, khat, and coca. Jf Sedatives, Hypnotics, Narcotics (\"downers\") This category includes all of the calmative, sleep-inducing, anxiety-reducing, anesthetizing substances, which sometimes induce perceptual changes, such as dream images, and also often evoke feelings of euphoria. The most important psychoactive plants and products in this category are poppy, opium, valerian, and hops. Jt Hallucinogens (\"all-arounders\") This category encompasses all those substances that produce distinct alterations in perception, sensations of space and time, and emotional states. Most of the plants discussed in this encyclopedia fall into this category. Over the course of time, these substances have been referred to under a variety of names:\n\nIt should be noted, however, that many plants that are characterized as \"magical plants\" in folklore or literature are not psychoactive (cf. Schopf 1986; Storl 1996c; Weustenfeld 1995). \"The fear of the psychedelic experience is quite literally the fear of losing control. Dominator types today don't understand that it's not important to maintain control if you are not in control in the first place\" (Terence McKenna, in Sheldrake et al. 2001, 50).\n\n10\n\n-Psychotomimetics (\"imitating psychoses\") -Psychotica (\"inducing psychoses\") -Hallucinogens (Johnson; \"causing hallucinations\") -Psychedelics (Osmund; \"mind manifesting\") -Entheogens (Ruck et al.; \"evoking the divine within\") -Entactogens (Nichols; \"promoting selfknowledge\") -Empathogens (Metzner; \"stimulating empathy\") -Eidetics (\"giving rise to ideas\") -Psychotogenics (\"affecting the mind\") -Psychodysleptics (\"softening the mind\") Today, the most commonly used term is still hallucinogen. By definition, a hallucinogen is a\n\nsubstance that evokes hallucinations (Siegel 1995b), which are now medically defined as \"sensory delusions that may involve several (to all) senses (= complexes) and are not the result of corresponding external sensory stimuli but possess a reality for the affected person; also occur in schizophrenia, stimulated brain states (e.g., due to poisoning, epilepsy, brain injuries, the effects of hallucinogens)\" (Roche Lexikon Medizin 1987, 725). Because the term hallucination now has a psychopathological tinge to it, nonmedical circles and publications usually prefer the terms psychedelic, entheogen, or visionary substance and accordingly speak of psychedelic, entheogenic, or visionary experiences: The awakening of the senses is the most basic aspect of the psychedelic experience. The open eye, the naked touch, the intensification and vivification of ear and nose and taste. This is the Zen moment of satori, the nature mystic's high, the sudden centering of consciousness on the sense organ, the real-eye-zation that this is it! I am eye! I am hear! I knose! I am in contact! (Leary 1998, 34) Shamans, of course, the traditional specialists in psychoactive substances, do not speak of psychoactive drugs, psychotropics, or hallucinogens—not to mention narcotics—but of plant teachers, magical plants,1 plants of the gods, sacred beverages, et cetera. They revere these mind-altering plants and make them offerings; they use them not as recreational drugs or as something to get \"high\" with in the evening but as sacraments in their rituals. The shamans regard these plants as sacred because they make it possible for them to contact the true reality and the gods, spirits, and demons. They are sacred because within them dwell plant spirits, plant gods, or devas that one can ally oneself with and that are esteemed as the teachers, mothers, ambassadors, and doctores (physicians) of other realities. In addition, these sacred plants have the power to heal. They can liberate the ill from their afflictions and drive out harmful, disease-causing spirits. They also can bring spiritual awakening to healthy people and make possible mystical experiences. With the aid of these plants, one does not lose control, for control is ultimately an illusion.2 And they are used not to escape from reality but to recognize true reality: \\ We can see that these plants do more than simply maintain our body. They also promote and nourish our souls and make possible the enlightenment of our mind. Their existence is offering, sacrifice, and selfless love. The earth on which they grow is itself a sacrificial altar—\n\nIntroduction and we who receive their blessings are the sacrificial priests. Through plants, the outer light of the sun and the stars becomes the inner light which reflects back from the foundations of our soul. This is the reason why plants have always and everywhere been considered sacred, divine. (Storl 1997, 20)\n\nThe Use of Psychoactive Plants Humans have a natural drive to pursue ecstatic experiences (Weil 1976; Siegel 1995a). The experience of ecstasy is just as much a part of being human and leading a fulfilling and happy life as is the experience of orgasm. In fact, many cultures use the same words to refer to ecstasy and to orgasm.3 The possibility of having ecstatic experiences is one of the fundamental conditions of human consciousness. All archaic and ethnographic cultures developed methods for inducing such experiences (Bourguignon 1973; Dittrich 1996). Some of these methods are more efficacious than others. The most effective method of all is to ingest psychoactive plants or substances. These methods, however, require certain skills, for there are many factors that play a role in shaping the effects and the contents of the experiences. The most important is proper use— that is, a responsible and goal-oriented use. Fitz Hugh Ludlow (1836-1870), whose book The Hasheesh Eater (published in 1857) was the first American literary work on the effects of hashish, has given us an amazing description of the proper way to use hashish: There is a fact which can be given as a justification for the craving for drugs without coming close to dubious secondary motives, namely, that drugs are able to bring humans into the neighborhood of divine experience and can thus carry us up from our personal fate and the everyday circumstances of our life into a higher form of reality. It is, however, necessary to understand precisely what is meant by the use of drugs. We do not mean the purely physical craving. . . . That of which we speak is something much higher, namely the knowledge of the possibility of the soul to enter into a lighter being, and to catch a glimpse of deeper insights and more magnificent visions of the beauty, truth, and the divine than we are normally able to spy through the cracks in our prison cell. But there are not many drugs which have the power of stilling such craving. The entire catalog, at least to the extent that research has thus far written it, may include only opium, hashish, and in rarer cases alcohol, which has enlightening effects only upon very particular characters. (Ludlow 1981,181)\n\nThere are many different ways to use psychoactive plants. The reasons they are consumed range from relaxation, recreation, and pleasure (hedonism) to medical and therapeutic treatments and to ritual and religious ceremonies and spiritual growth. It is the task of culture and society to provide the individual with patterns for using them that serve these purposes. Drug Culture Both experience and research have very clearly demonstrated that every culture in the world either has used or still does use psychoactive substances in traditional contexts: Every society, every time has its drug culture. Corresponding to the complexity of society, its drug culture may also be more or less complex, oriented, for example, around just one central drug or encompassing a number of drugs. It can also be subdivided into internal cultures that can contradict one another. (Marzahn 1994, 82)\n\n\"1 allow dew drops to fall from the flowers onto the fields, which inebriate my soul.\" SONG OF NEZAHUALCOYOTL IN ANCIENT NAHUATL POETRY (BRINTON 1887)\n\n\"Most people never realize that the purpose of intoxication is to sharpen the mind.\" ROBERT E. SVOBODA AGHORA (1993,175)\n\n\"Religions are false means for satisfying genuine needs.\" KARLHEINZ DESCHNER BISSIGE APHORISMEN [BITING APHORISMS]\n\nThese \"internal cultures\" are often referred to as \"subcultures\" or \"scenes.\" Within these cultural structures, cultural patterns often form that seem to be archetypical for human existence. Marzahn analyzed traditional rituals that employ psychoactive substances—he uses the term drug, most likely as a provocation—and from these developed a model that suggests that, throughout the world, common drug cultures continually emerge and establish themselves: Yet the deepest meaning of the common drug culture appears to lie in the fact that this internal order is required because of this exiting, this stepping over boundaries; it is precisely what a culture of border crossers needs. In the context of the common drug culture, the use of drugs is not banished out of time and space. Rather, it has a clear and circumscribed place within both. People gather at a special place and surround themselves with the proper space and with beautiful devices. The communal use of the drug has a beginning and an end. It takes place according to an internal order, which has been derived from experience, and does not simply allow whatever anyone might want. With time, it has become condensed into a ceremony, a rite. This internal order and its outer form, the ritual, are what make it possible for the drug to be used properly and protect people from harm and destruction.

However, in our culture there is a deep chasm, a wound, for the people who preserved our own traditional knowledge have disappeared as a result of forced Christianization, imperialism, the Inquisition, the persecutions of witches, the Enlightenment, and positivism. And yet in spite of this, the psychoactive life continues to pulse in the inner cultures. And the archaic patterns continue to remain relevant, so appropriate uses of psychoactive substances continue to emerge. This has produced what may be called \"underground experts\" in the proper use of psychoactive substances: Through rhythm, internal order, and ritual, the common drug culture provides an orientation and a foothold in dealing with drugs: for our aspiration, because it embeds drug use within an understanding about the proper way to live, about the goals and forms of life, and about the role that befits drugs within these; for our knowledge, because it provides information about the mechanisms of actions, benefits, and drawbacks of drugs that is based upon experience and traditional knowledge; for our feelings, because it provides us with security in the simultaneously affirming and shy respect for drugs, thereby protecting us from ill-conceived fear and fascination, from both a demonizing worship and a demonization; and finally for our actions, because it develops and passes down rules that are recognized and respected because experience and validation have shown them to be meaningful and because they tell us which drugs, in which dosage, when, where, and with whom are beneficial and which are not. (Marzahn 1994,47) The Most Important Considerations: The Theory of Dosage, Set, and Setting The theory of dosage, set, and setting provides a useful model for better understanding the effects of psychoactive plants. Dr. Timothy Leary (1920-1996), a Harvard professor, conducted scientific experiments with psychedelic substances (LSD and psilocybin) in the early 1960s. On the basis of his own experiences and his systematic observations, he and his colleagues Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) developed this theory (Leary et al. 1964), which states that there are three main factors responsible for the experiences induced by psychedelics. The first factor is the dosage—a truism since ancient times, or at least since Paracelsus. The set is the internal attitudes and constitution of the person, including his expectations, his wishes, his fears. The third aspect is the setting, which pertains to the\n\nsurroundings, the place, and the time—in short, the space in which the experiences transpire. This theory clearly states that the effects are equally the result of chemical, pharmacological, psychological, and physical influences. The model that Timothy Leary proposed for the psychedelics also applies to experiences with other psychoactive plants (including the stimulants and narcotics). All three factors must be carefully considered when one wishes to have experiences with and understand these plants. Even in the same person, the same plant can evoke very different effects if the dosage, set, and setting are changed. The first factor, of course, pertains to the choice of plant. Then the proper dosage must be consumed. But what is a \"proper\" dosage? It is the amount that will produce the desired effects. But since the effects are not solely the result of the dosage, the proper dosage can be determined only by taking the other factors into consideration as well. As the saying goes, \"An ounce of practice is worth a pound of theory.\" This is especially true in the present context. When experimenting, one should always begin with low dosages. It is better to use too little than too much. You can always use more on the next occasion. If one rashly takes too much, the result may be unpleasant or even dangerous. When ingesting strychnine, for example, the dosage is extremely crucial. A small dosage can produce wonderful sensations and sexual vigor, whereas a large dosage can be lethal. American Indians, for example, recognize three dosage levels for magic mushrooms: a medicinal, an aphrodisiac, and a shamanic. For the\n\n\"In different cultures, drugs are often used in completely different manners. This demonstrates that the consumption of drugs is culturally shaped to a very large extent. Which substances are used, when, by whom, how, how often, and in which dosage, where, with whom, and why, and also which conceptions are related to this are largely dependent upon the cultural membership of a user. Because of these influences, inebriation is experienced and lived out in very different ways, and a drug may be used for different purposes, may be assigned different functions.\" BLATTER (1994,123)\n\n13\n\nIntroduction\n\nLeft: This beaded head of a jaguar bears witness to the great importance that psychoactive substances play in shamanism. The jaguar is a symbol of the shaman—for he can transform himself into this powerful animal— but he is also his power animal and ally. The shaman uses a psychoactive plant, the peyote cactus (Lophophora wilHamsii), to establish contact with this ally. The fantastic world he enters is echoed in the artistry of the beadwork. The visionary cactus itself is portrayed on the animal's cheek. (By an unknown Huichol artist, ca. 1996) Center: Shamans throughout the world use psychoactive substances in order to penetrate into the other world, the other reality. Drumming helps ensure a safe journey during the visionary adventure. (Nepali shaman atKalinchok, 1993) Right: During a dramatic visionary experience, the shaman obtains his special abilities and powers by dying as a person and being reborn as a shaman. Psychoactive substances often produce experiences of death and rebirth, as well as near-death experiences. (Huichol yarn painting, ca. 1995)\n\n4\n\nThis is very similar to the Indian concept of maya, \"the illusion that conceals reality as a result of ignorance\" (Zimmer 1973, 31*). 1-1\n\nmedicinal dosage, a quantity is administered that does not produce any psychoactive effects but that can heal certain ailments. The aphrodisiac dosage is higher: The mind is activated but not overpowered by visions or hallucinations; perception and sensitivity are heightened and the body is aroused and invigorated. The shamanic dosage catapults consciousness into an entirely different reality that is flooded with cosmic visions and enables a person to peer into worlds that are beyond the normal experience of space and time. Set is perhaps the most important factor for becoming aware of the efficaciousness of a psychoactive plant, especially when a hallucinogenic substance is involved. These substances have the ability to activate, potentiate, and sometimes mercilessly expose everything that a person has in his or her consciousness or buried beneath it. People who were raised under the repressive conceptions of the Catholic religion, for example, may need to struggle with the original sin that was laid upon them in the cradle, whereas a naturevenerating pagan may perceive his or her partner as a temple of divine desire. In traditional cultures, set is shaped primarily by the worldview that all individuals share and is especially expressed in a tribe's mythology. The mythology provides a kind of cartography of the visionary worlds and other realities. Using this cartography, an explorer of consciousness can reach the desired goal. And he can always count on the help of the shaman who accompanies him, for the shaman is the best cartographer of the other, visionary reality. Even when a person gets lost in that world, the shaman can bring him back. The contents of the visions, in other words, are shaped by culture.\n\nPsychoactive Plants and Shamanic Consciousness The shaman is not only a hunter, warrior, healer, diviner, and entertainer, but also a natural scientist and thinker. Anthropologist Elizabeth ReichelDolmatoff reports that among the Tanimuka, a Tukano Indian group, shamanism is consequently referred to as \"thinking.\" The shaman, first and foremost, is a visionary who has genuine visions: A shaman is one who has attained a vision of the beginnings and the endings of all things and who can communicate that vision. To the rational thinker, this is inconceivable, yet the techniques of shamanism are directed toward this end and this is the source of their power. Preeminent among the shaman's techniques is the use of the plant hallucinogens, repositories of living vegetable gnosis that lie, now nearly forgotten, in our ancient past. (McKenna 1992, 7) \"Shamanism is the door to the real world.\" The ethnopsychologist Holger Kalweit spoke these words at a symposium in September 1996 entitled \"The Shamanic Universe.\" What he meant is that shamanic consciousness is the real world or, as the Indians say, the \"true reality.\" For many Indians in the Central and South American rain forests, the everyday world is an illusion, a superficial necessity.4 \"To those who know, this appears as the world of effects, whereas the world of myths is the world of causes\" (Deltgen 1993, 125). Ayahuasca or yage, the \"drink of true reality,\" helps people pierce through the illusion that is the everyday world and penetrate into the heart of reality. The reality that is\n\nIntroduction\n\nName\n\nActive Substance\n\nDosage Alkaloid Drugs (dried)\n\nMushrooms\n\npsilocybin psilocin mescaline phenethylamine lysergic acid amide\n\n20 mg\n\ntropanes (scopolamine/atropine)\n\n5mg\n\nPeyote Vines Datura\n\n0.5-1.0 g\n\n1-5 mg\n\nexperienced under the influence of ayahuasca is the reality of the myths, which appears to be more real and more meaningful. \"The drug is a medium, a vehicle between this reality and that. It is the gateway to knowledge. The kumu [shaman], however, is the mediator between the two worlds, and may be more passive or more active, depending upon his power and his talents\" (Deltgen 1993, 141). The effects of the \"ingestion of these hallucinogens are not understood as an action produced by a special, that is, active chemical substance, but as a contact with spirit beings (owners, 'mothers,' species spirits), who control the corresponding plant and embody its 'essence'\" (Baer 1987, 1). The spirits of the plant are the same spirits who aid the shaman in the healing process: \"The hallucinogenic plants, or the spirits that dwell within them, open the eyes of those who take them; they enable them to recognize the nonordinary reality, which is considered to be reality per se, and it is ultimately they, and not the shaman, who free the patient from his affliction\" (Baer 1987, 79). Not everyone, however, can control the spirit helpers: \"The caji [ayahuasca] thus does not make the shaman. To the contrary: he who is called to be a shaman, the spiritually gifted, is able to make something out of the drugs and their effects\" (Deltgen 1993, 200). Like their shamans, most of the Indians of the Amazon base their lives upon the visions they receive through ayahuasca: \"Our ancestors oriented the entire rhythm of their lives around the ayahuasca visions; whether it had to do with the making of weapons, drawings, art, colors, clothing, medicine, or something else, or it involved determining the most favorable time for a journey or to till the fields. They used the ayahuasca visions in their attempts to better organize themselves\" (Rivas 1989, 182). Shamans throughout the world consume psychoactive plants and products so that they may be able to enter the shamanic state of consciousness and travel to the visionary world, the other reality. The substances shamans use are very diverse both chemically and pharmacologically. The active substances they contain belong to different classes that are analogs of or related to\n\nDuration of Effects\n\n3-5 g 2-8 mushrooms 4-14 \"buttons\"\n\n4 hours\n\n5-40 seeds (up to 300!) 12-60 seeds 3-5 flowers\n\n4-12 hours\n\n4-8 hours\n\n3-6 hours up to 24 hours\n\ndifferent endogenous neurotransmitters (see the box above).5 Nevertheless, they are all pharmacological stimuli for achieving the selfsame purpose: to produce the shamanic state of consciousness.6 This fact was verified through the research of Adolf Dittrich, who demonstrated that experiences in altered states of consciousness—and compared to everyday reality, the shamanic state of consciousness is very altered—are identical at the core, no matter which pharmacological and/or psychological stimuli elicited them (Dittrich 1996). On the basis of my own experiences with a variety of psychoactive plants, I can attest that different active substances can evoke the same state of consciousness, e.g., trance, but will not always do so, for the same drug can produce totally different effects in different people. In particular, the drugs found in datura exhibit striking differences (cf. Siegel 1981). Even in the same person, the same substance can induce very different effects depending upon the dosage, set, and setting. In order to produce the same state, i.e., the shamanic state of consciousness, more than just a psychoactive substance is needed. The user must also have the appropriate intention and the appropriate external conditions.7 The drug experience is heavily influenced by the mythological and cosmological matrix of the user and by the ritual that is taking place in the external world. Mythology and cosmology provide the topography or cartography of the shamanic world and show the ways into it and back out. The ritual provides the outer framework that facilitates the user's transition from everyday reality to shamanic reality and back. The reasons why a plant is being used will strongly affect the content of the experiences. If it is being used to perform shamanic tasks, then it will tend to evoke shamanic realities. As with all human abilities, however, this talent is not the same in everyone. Only the most talented can become shamans. In the same way, humans all differ with regard to our boldness and courage. Only the most courageous of us can become shamans. Fearful people should not confront the\n\n\"Emissaries of the plant kingdom merge with human bodies and aid people in attaining other states of consciousness. Only the gods know which powers of nature are here at work. Possessed people give themselves in to sexual activities and join in the cosmic dance of joy. They celebrate festivals in the truest sense of the word. These festivities are an expression of that fundamental and timeless form of religious ceremony which is an invitation to the gods. Through this adoration, man makes a request, he offers the gods his body and soul, so that they will 'take over' these. Enlightenment.\" TIMOTHY LEARY ON THE CRIMINALIZATION OF THE\n\nNATURAL (NO DATE)\n\n5\n\nPsilocybin is an analog of serotonin, mescaline of dopamine, LSA of the tryptaminc-like endopsychedelics, and scopolamine of acetylcholine (Ratsch I993c,42).\n\n6\n\nIt should be noted that Western psychiatry has or still does use the active substances in these four drugs for psychotherapeutic purposes. The discovery of mescaline led to a revolution in European psychiatry (Hermle et al. 1993; La Barre 1960). Psilocybin and its derivatives were used extensively in psycholytic therapy (Leuner 1981). Because of their hypnotic properties, the alkaloids in ololiuqui were tested in experimental psychiatry (Heim et al. 1968; Isbell and Gorodetzky 1966; Osmund 1955). Scopolamine was used as a truth serum and in narcoanalysis, and in psychiatry it is still used as a \"chemical straitjacket\" (Ratsch 1991b).\n\n7\n\nTypically, the altered state of consciousness produced by alcohol is viewed medically as being fundamentally different from the state produced by hallucinogens (Winkelman 1992,186). This notwithstanding, Mexican shamans use both hallucinogens and alcohol to induce a shamanic trance. The effects of alcohol that we are familiar with (ranging from being slightly tipsy to delirium tremens) are thus at least partially conditioned by culture. After all, the ancient descriptions of the Dionysian frenzy (cf. Emboden 1977) are fundamentally different from the descriptions of alcohol intoxication in modern industrialized societies.\n\n15\n\nIntroduction \"It can be said of very many inebriants that the same dose will enliven one individual and put another to sleep. Indeed, under different circumstances, they can produce almost opposite effects even in the same individual. Just as a person can be pepped up by morphine, he can become sleepy after coffee. Almost everyone knows that the same dose of alcohol can be something different in the morning and the evening, in the summer or the winter.\" WOLFGANG HEUBNER GENuft UND BETAUBUNC DURCH CHEM1SCHE MlTTEL [ENJOYMENT AND STUPOR THROUGH CHEMICAL MEANS] (1952,36)\n\n\"Whoever the plant devas touch is no longer the same person [he was] before.

It is for these reasons that in most societies that have institutionalized shamans, the use of plants with visionary effects is embedded within an exclusively ritual context. The visionary experiences take place against the familiar background of one's own culture. The shamanic use of psychoactive plants follows a specific basic pattern, whereby it is relatively unimportant which substance is being used. First and foremost are the form, meaning, and purpose (function) of a ritual. The structure of the ritual follows a pattern that I have termed the \"psychedelic ritual of knowledge\" (cf. Ratsch 1991b): Preparation Collecting and preparing the drugs Sexual abstinence, fasting Practical purification (bathing, sweat house,8 enemas) Symbolic purification Utilization Offerings to the gods (e.g., incense) Prayers to the gods and/or plant spirits Ingestion of the drug Soul journey during trance Communication with the plant spirits/ gods/animal spirits Integration Diagnosis/prophecy Instructions for how to behave Offerings of thanks\n\nThe Fear of Psychoactive Plants\n\n8\n\n16\n\nThe ritual and hygienic use of sweat houses (temazcal in Aztec) was widespread in Mexico before the arrival of the Spanish. Today, it has almost vanished (cf. Cresson 1938).\n\nThe fear of consciousness-expanding plants is at least as old as the Bible. In Genesis, this fear is thematically expressed as the Fall. The fruit of the tree of knowledge transforms a person into a god. But since we are allowed to worship only one god, no one else can stand on the same level as him (or her?). In many hierarchical cultures with an imperialistic orientation (emphasizing power instead of knowledge), immediate mystical, ecstatic, or religious experience is heavily regulated and is usually even forbidden. The direct experience of the world has been replaced by an elaborate, theologically driven religion and is monopolized by the state. Paradise, that other reality, is administered by bureaucrats who have not personally experienced it and who sell it to the needy and those who crave ecstasy. Jonathan Ott has referred to this mechanism as the \"pharmacratic inquisition\" (1993). The Mexican inquisition provides the best historical example of the suppression of personal experience and its replacement by a state monopoly for administering the divine.\n\nAs the Europeans pushed into the New World, they encountered for the first time shamans, whom they contemptuously labeled \"magicians\" and \"black artists.\" The shamans' gods and helping spirits were degraded as false gods, idols, and the devil's work; their sacred drinks were defamed as witches' brews. An Inquisition report from the colonial period written by D. Pedro Nabarre de Isla (issued on June 29,1620) notes: As for the introduction of the use of a plant or root named peyote . . . for the purpose of uncovering thievery, divinations about other occurrences, and prophesizing future events, this is a superstition which is to be condemned because it is directed against the purity and integrity of our sacred Catholic faith. This is certain, for neither this named plant nor any other possesses the power or intrinsic property of being able to bring about the alleged effects, nor can anything produce the mental images, fantasies, or hallucinations that are the basis of the mentioned divinations. In the latter, the influences and workings of the devil, the real cause of this vice, are clear, who first makes use of the innate gullibility of the Indians and their idolatrous tendencies and then strikes down many other people who do not sufficiently fear God and do not possess enough faith. Even today, the sacred plants of the Indians and/or their active constituents are forbidden throughout the world. While the use of peyote, mescaline, psilocybin (the active principle of Mexican magic mushrooms), DMT, et cetera, is in principle exempt from punishment, the possession of or trafficking in these is nevertheless illegal (Korner 1994). The drug laws of our time, in other words, are rooted in the spirit of the Catholic Inquisition. As long as the sacred plants and substances of the Indians remain illegal, the war against the indigenous peoples of the Americas will not be over. Generally speaking, the U.S. \"War on Drugs\" is a continuation of European colonialism and an instrument for criminalizing the Indians and their spiritual kin. This phobia about drugs is nothing new, for drugs have been viewed as wild and reprehensible since ancient times (think of the persecution of the mystical followers of Dionysos, as well as of the witches, alchemists, and hippies). The fear of drugs and the experiences associated with them is found even throughout the various camps of shamanism fans and in academic circles. Mircea Eliade, for example, discounted the use of drugs to produce trance and (archaic) ecstasy as \"degenerate shamanism\" (1975, 382). Many members of the New Age movement have claimed that they\n\nIntroduction can attain \"it\" without drugs. There are also anthropologists who argue that just because \"their\" shaman apparently enters into trance without any pharmacological support, other shamans—about whom they know nothing—also should not need drugs. It appears, however, that almost all traditional shamans prefer pharmacological stimuli (Furst 1972a; Harner 1973; Ripinsky-Naxon 1993; Rosenbohm 1991; Vitebsky 1995). As one source puts it, \"The Indians view the drugs as nourishment for the soul and venerate them because of their wondrous properties\" (Diguet in Wagner, 1932,67). When the Christian Europeans encountered their first shamans, they saw them as black magicians, master witches who had allied themselves with the devil and who, with his help, were leading the other members of their tribe down the road to ruin. In the early ethnographic literature, they are referred to as magicians, witch doctors, medicine men, weather makers, mediums, and the like. A large portion of the literature on shamanism specialized in demonstrating that shamans are con artists who use sleight of hand to trick the other members of their tribes and that, in the best of cases, they are charlatans whose methods are irrational and superstitious. In traditional psychiatry and psychoanalyticaloriented anthropology, shamans were regarded as schizophrenics, psychopaths, and sufferers of arctic hysteria, that is, as people who are ill. Strange indeed that these ill people are the very ones who concern themselves with the task of healing. In contrast, shamans have been glorified and proclaimed as saviors in antipsychiatric circles. This attitude gave rise to images of \"psychiatric Utopias in which the shaman was the leader\" (Kakar 1984, 95). In the more recent ethnographic literature, especially that based upon the approach known as cognitive anthropology, shamans are looked at from the perspective of that which they represent for their communities: people who, because of their calling and their special gift of trance, are able to divine, diagnose, and heal. In doing so, they maintain harmony in the community, preserve the tribal myths and traditions, and ensure the survival of their people.9 The interdiction of psychoactive plants and their effects is not bolstered solely by questionable politically based laws, but also receives support from the side of established science. Here, two concepts from psychiatry have played key roles: psychotomimetic and model psychosis. The first is a term for a substance that is said to mimic a psychosis; the second is a term used to characterize the experience. As a result, these plants and the effects they produce are viewed not as something sacred or mystical but as something pathological. This is reminiscent of such anthro-\n\npologists and religious scholars as George Devereux and Mircea Eliade, who regarded shamans as psychopaths or people suffering from hysteria. Since the end of the nineteenth century, Western psychiatry has known of and used drugs that alter consciousness (Grob 1995; Strassman 1995). The first such substance to be tested and used in psychiatry was mescaline. Mescaline was first extracted, chemically identified, and synthesized from the Mexican peyote cactus at the end of the nineteenth century. At that time, the effects of mescaline upon healthy subjects were thought to be the same as those that were otherwise known only from psychiatric patients. This led to the idea of the pharmacologically induced \"model psychosis\" (cf. Leuner 1962; Hermle et al. 1988). During the twentieth century, other substances with similar effects were discovered in the plant world, synthesized in the laboratory, and tested on patients and even on prisoners (Hermle et al. 1993). The concept of the model psychosis is simply another form of ethnocentrism. Whereas the Inquisition saw the workings of the devil in these psychoactive substances, psychiatrists interpreted the sacred visions as psychotic-like states, that is, as \"artificially\" induced mental illnesses. Today, however, the model psychosis concept has itself landed on the rubbish heap of modern hightechnology science. Recent research into the brain activity of true psychotics and of healthy users of psychedelics, using PET scans, has demonstrated that very different regions of the brain are active in each (Hermle et al. 1992). Another opinion prevalent in our world holds that \"drugs\" cannot be used intelligently but will automatically be \"misused\" (cf. Dobkin de Rios and Smith 1976). In our culture, it is commonly argued that narcotic drugs lead to \"addiction\" or \"dependency.\" Here, the views vary widely. In addition, the addictive potential of a substance is often used as the only definition of an inebriant (also frequently referred to as an \"addictive drug\"). Since addictive behaviors can arise with respect to almost every substance, many foods, luxury goods, and numerous medicines should also be seen as addictive substances. Many people, for example, are \"addicted\" to chocolate (cf. Ott 1985). Some have even argued that sugar is a drug, and an addictive one at that (McKenna and Pieper 1993). So, are chocolate and sugar invigorating foodstuffs, delicious luxury goods, or addictive drugs? Since ancient times, psychoactive substances have been used by athletes as doping agents (cf. Mammillaria spp.). In the modern world of competitive sports, the plant substance ephedrine and its derivatives (amphetamines), camphor (cf. Cinnamomum camphora), strychnine, and cocaine\n\nSee Jilek (1971) for an extensive study of the contradictions and changes that have taken place in the images of shamans.\n\n17\n\nIntroduction \"The world is as one perceives it and what one perceives of it.\" ALBERT HOFMANN LOB DBS SCHAUENS [IN PRAISE OF LOOKING] (1996)\n\nhave all been used. Of course, the use of doping agents is condemned, regarded as unsportsmanlike, forbidden, and strongly proscribed (Berendonk 1992). Many athletes, however, are like the \"closet shamans\" (see p. 20), constantly on the lookout for new ways to augment their performance. Recently, preparations of the ascomycete Cordyceps were successfully used for doping purposes. The athlete involved could not have her victory disallowed, however, for this was a dietary supplement, not a forbidden substance.\n\nThe Study of Psychoactive Plants\n\nLeft: The first botanical and chemical investigations of the peyote cactus (Lophophom williamsii) were conducted at the end of the nineteenth century. The extraordinary psychedelic effects of mescaline, an alkaloid isolated from this cactus, have influenced the history of European psychiatry. Right: Two psychoactive plants in an intimate embrace: an Amazonian ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) winding itself up the trunk of a coral tree (Erythrina mexicana).\n\n18\n\nScience begins by collecting data, facts, and objects and ends with systematic knowledge. This process characterized all of the early works of science, which condensed and concentrated the knowledge of their time and their world. There is also the human desire to experiment. We learn by trying things out, and we change our behavior as a result of our experiences. It is striking that all of the great plant researchers have been avid collectors of both information and materials and have also tested the effects of as many plants as possible on themselves, for how can one evaluate the effects of a plant if one has never seen or touched it, not to mention ingested it? The study of psychoactive plants began with the beginnings of botany. Theophrastus (ca. 370-287 B.C.E.), the \"father of botany,\" has given us descriptions of numerous psychoactive plants and substances. Systematic science, which some trace back to the poet Homer (ninth—eighth centuries B.C.E.), was already being practiced in ancient times:\n\nBut Homer, who was the forefather of the sciences and of the history of ancient times and was a great admirer of Circe, attributed Egypt with the fame of its valuable herbs. . . . At least he described a great number of Egyptian herbs which were given to his Helen by the Pharaoh's wife, and spoke of that renowned nepenthes, which induced one to forget sorrow and forgive and which Helen should have had all the mortals drink. But the first of whom we still have knowledge was Orpheus, who reported some interesting things about herbs. We have already mentioned the admiration which Musaios and Hesiod, following his lead, had for polium. Orpheus and Hesiod recommended the burning of incense. . . . After him, Pythagoras, the first person known for his knowledge, wrote a book about the effects of plants in which he attributed their discovery and origin to Apollo, Asclepius, and all of the immortal Gods in general. Democritus also produced such a compilation; both visited the magicians in Persia, Arabia, Ethiopia, and Egypt. (Pliny, Natural History 25. U-3) In late ancient times, other books of herbal lore joined Pliny's (23-79 C.E.) Natural History. The most important of these was Dioscorides's (ca. first century) Teachings on Medicines, which is still important in our time. This work provides information about numerous psychoactive plants, including their various names, preparations, and uses (cf. Ratsch 1995a). In the Middle Ages, descriptions of psychoactive plants were found especially in the writings of Arabic and Indian authors, such as Avicenna (980-1037). In Germany, many plants (including hemp, henbane, and deadly nightshade) were described by the abbess Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) (Miiller 1982). The great period of the \"fathers of botany\" dawned at the beginning of the modern era. This period witnessed the publication of voluminous herbals full of information about psychoactive plants. Among their authors are Leonhart Fuch: (1501-1566), Jacobus Theodorus Tabernae montanus (1522-1590), Hieronymus Bocl (1498-1554), Otto Brunfels (ca. 1490-1534), ant Pierandrea Matthiolus (1500-1577). During the colonization of the New World, th Spanish king sent physicians and botanists t< Mexico and Peru. Their task was to investigate th indigenous flora to determine potential medicine uses. The results were published in a number c compendia dedicated to American flora and il healing effects. All of these works contai numerous references to psychoactive plants an their medicinal and psychoactive uses (Pozo 196! 1967).\n\nIntroduction The systematic study of psychoactive plants first began in the nineteenth century. Dr. Ernst von Bibra (1806-1878), a baron from Lower Franconia, was a private scholar typical of his time. He was wealthy by birth, achieved academic distinction, and dedicated his life to his studies, which he preferred to carry out within his own four walls. He studied medicine and philosophy in Wiirzburg and later lived in Nuremberg. When he was not traveling, he spent most of his time at his estate at Schwebheim. Bibra held liberal political views and was actively involved in the Revolution of 1848. Because of this, he was forced to leave the country for a time, during which he journeyed through South America (1849-50). While there, he became acquainted not only with many exotic cultures but also with a number of South American inebriants, especially coca and guarana. Just one year after Bibra published the remarkable journal of his travels,10 his groundbreaking book Die narkotischen Genuftmittel und der Mensch [The Narcotic Agents of Pleasure and Man] (Nuremberg 1855; published in English as Plant Intoxicants in 1995) appeared. A unique work, it became a true literary sensation, providing the first detailed descriptions of the psychoactive drugs that were known at the time and their effects. The author's own experiences, as well as his liberal disposition, were very discernible: One could not name a single country in the whole wide world in which the inhabitants are not using some sort of narcotic. Indeed, almost all use several of them. Although perhaps only a few tribes use certain of these substances, millions of people employ the vast majority of them. (Bibra 1995,218) In his book, Bibra reported at great length about coffee, tea, mate, guarana, cacao, fahan tea, fly agaric, thorn apple, coca, opium, lactucarium, hashish, tobacco, betel, and arsenic. The conclusions of his discussion have a very modern ring: We have learned from experience that man can live without narcotics or without alcoholic drinks, which we wish to include here because of their similar effects. By taking these substances, however, man's life becomes brighter and therefore they ought to be approved. (221) Clearly, the notion that we have a right to inebriation was already current at that time! In German-speaking countries, Bibra's work launched a wave of interdisciplinary drug research that has continued into the present day. He was the chief source of inspiration for pharmacist Carl Hartwich (1851-1917), who compiled the most voluminous work on psychoactive plants to date\n\n(Hartwich 1911), as well as for toxicologist Louis Lewin (1850-1929). Even Albert Hofmann (b. 1906), a modern-day Swiss chemist specializing in the investigation of naturally occurring substances, feels a kinship with the baron, for Bibra called upon the chemists who would come after him to dedicate themselves to the study of psychoactive plants. Arthur Heffter (1860-1925) took Bibra at his word. He was the first person to test an isolated plant component, in his case mescaline, by trying it out on himself. It is for this reason that we still refer to this method of conducting research through self-experimentation as the Heffter technique. At about the same time as Bibra, the American Mordecai Cubitt Cooke (1825-1913) also was studying human inebriants, which he poetically described as the \"Seven Sisters of Sleep\" (Cooke 1860, reprinted in 1989). Paralleling Cooke's work, the Scotsman James F. Johnston was investigating the chemistry of everyday life and the substances that humans ingest for their pleasure. He published his work in 1855, the same year as Bibra. In Italy, Paolo Mantegazza (1831-1910) is regarded as a pioneer of drug research (Samorini 1995b). In 1871, Mantegazza published in Milan his 1,200-page main work Quadri della natura umana: Feste ed ebbrezze [Pictures of Human Nature: Festivals and Inebriations]. Mantegazza was partial to coca, and in 1858 he published a sensational work entitled Sulle virtu igieniche e medicinali della coca e sugli alimenti nervosi in generate [On the Hygienic and Medicinal Virtues of Coca and Nerve Nourishment in General]. Like Bibra and Hartwich, Mantegazza was interested in all agents of inebriation and pleasure and was guided and inspired by these his entire life. Since most of his writings have appeared only in Italian, they have not attracted as much international attention as the publications of Bibra, Johnston, and Cooke. Mantegazza's classification of inebriants is especially interesting. He divided the \"nerve nourishment\" into three families: 1. alcoholic nerve nourishment, with the two branches fermented and distilled beverages; 2. alkaloid nerve nourishment, with the branches caffeine and narcotics (among the narcotics, he included opium, hashish, kava-kava, betel, fly agaric, coca, ayahuasca, and tobacco); and 3. aromatic nerve nourishment (sage, oregano, rosemary, cinnamon, pepper, chili, etc.). The psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926), who in 1882 published his medical and psychologically oriented book Uber die Beeinflussung einfacher psychologischer Vorgange durch einige Arzneimittel [On the Influencing of Simple Psychological Processes by Some Medicines], followed a path different from Bibra's. That same\n\nDr. Ernst Freiherr von Bibra (1806-1878) was a pioneer in the ethnopharmacological study of psychoactive substances. His work Die narkotischen Genufimittel und der Mensch [The Narcotic Agents of Pleasure and Man] (1855) was the first comprehensive book on the topic and is still an important reference.\n\nShen-Nung, the legendary Red Emperor, is regarded as the founder of Chinese herbal medicine. He personally tried each herb, including the poisonous and inebriating ones, before recommending their use for healing purposes. Shen-Nung was thus the founder of the ethnopharmacological method of conducting bioessays, also known as the Heffter technique. (Ancient Chinese\n\n10 Reise in Siid-Amerika [Journey in South America] (Mannheim 1854).\n\n19\n\n\"Oh! Joy! Joy! I have seen the birth of life, the beginnings of movement. The blood pounds in my veins as if they would burst. I want to fly, swim, bark, bleat, roar, would that I had wings, a carapace, a rind, could fume smoke, would have a trunk, could coil my body, divide myself and enter into everything, could effuse myself into scents, unfurl myself like a plant, flow like water, vibrate like sound, shimmer like the light, assume every form, penetrate into every atom, sink down to the foundation of matter— be matter!\" GUSTAVE FLAUBERT LA TENTATION DE SAINT ANTOINE [THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY] (1979,189)\n\n11 In the older ethnographic literature, the key role that psychoactive substances play in shamanism was typically suppressed. Some authors even went so far as to suggest that those shamans who \"required\" drugs to produce their trance state (which was referred to as toxic ecstasy) were \"degenerate\" and no longer capable of \"true ecstasy.\" In the years following Eliade's \"classic\" publication (1951), the more recent ethnological and cultural anthropological literature on shamanism has essentially corrected this earlier view, for it has now been determined that almost all shamans ingest drugs (cf. Rosenbohm 1991) and that pharmacological techniques for inducing altered states of consciousness are much more important than all the others.\n\n20\n\nyear witnessed the publication of the revised second edition of Die Schlaf- und Traumzustande der menschlichen Seele mil besonderer Berucksichtigung ihres Verhiiltnisses zu den psychischen Alienationen [The Sleeping and Dreaming States of the Human Mind, with Special Emphasis Upon Their Relationship to the Psychic Alienations], by Heinrich Spitta, a dream researcher and professor of philosophy. Both books, each in its own way, dealt with the chemical agents that can be used to induce altered states. Shortly thereafter, the neurologist and \"father of dream theory\" Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) published his work Ueber Coca [On Coca], which helped make the use of cocaine fashionable. These pioneering works led to the development of psychopharmacology or pharmacopsychology, a field that has attracted psychiatrists, pharmacologists, pharmacognosists, and chemists. Pharmacopsychology has been defined as \"the doctrine of influencing the mental life by means of chemically effective substances introduced into the body\" (Lippert 1972, 10). The most important chemist in this history of research is the Swiss Albert Hofmann. Not only did he invent LSD while investigating the ergot alkaloids, but also he discovered the active principles in the magic mushrooms of Mexico as well as other American Indian magical drugs. Also of note is Alexander T. Shulgin, an American chemist of Russian descent who has played an especially significant role in the area of structureeffect relationships. In anthropology or ethnology, investigations into the use of psychoactive plants did not begin until the twentieth century.11 Among the pioneers of psychoactive ethnology are Pablo Bias Reko, Weston La Barre, Johannes Wilbert, Peter Furst, and Michael Harner. Today, the role played by Carlos Castaneda is a source of considerable controversy. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, ethnobotany began to emerge as a specialized branch of science. The term was introduced in 1895 by John W. Harshberger (1869-1929). Both ethnologists and botanists have specialized in ethnobotany. A British scholar, Richard Spruce (1817-1893), was one of the pioneers of ethnobotany. Richard Evans Schultes (1915-2001), a former professor and former director of the Botanical Museum at Harvard University, is universally regarded as the \"father of psychoactive ethnobotany.\" His investigations in Mexico and South America have led to the discovery of numerous psychoactive plants (Davis 1996). Many of Schultes's students have themselves become renowned ethnobotanists or ethnopharmacologists, including Timothy Plowman (1944-1989), Wade Davis, Mark J. Plotkin, and Tom Lockwood. The American botanist William Emboden is noted for making a creative leap to art history and has\n\npublished many important works in this area. Ethnomycology, the study of the cultural uses of fungi, was founded by the banker R. Gordon Wasson (1898-1986). In some ways, Jonathan Ott, a chemist who investigates natural substances, has become Wasson's successor. Many other discoveries in ethnomycology have been made by Paul Stamets, Gaston Guzman, and Jochen Gartz. During the past thirty years, ethnopharmacology, the study of the cultural uses of pharmacologically active substances and their cognitive interpretations, has developed into a specialized field within the disciplines of ethnobotany and ethnomedicine. It is a young field that is very interdisciplinary in nature. This encyclopedia is a work of this nature. Finally, we should also mention closet shamans. This term has come to be used for amateurs and hobbyists who experiment at home with psychoactive plants and preparations, occasionally making astonishing discoveries that are then eagerly taken up and pursued by scientists. Almost all of the research into ayahuasca analogs has been conducted by these closet shamans. Most of the important discoveries in the field of psychoactive plants, including those having to do with their chemistry and pharmaceutical uses, have been made by German-speaking scientists. Is this an expression of some need of the German \"soul\"? Why this concentration on German soil? Is the Germanic god Wotan still at work? Wotan is both the god of knowledge and the restless shaman who will do whatever he can to satisfy his immeasurable thirst for knowledge. It was he who stole the Mead of Inspiration and brought it to us humans (Metzner 1994b).\n\nPsychoactive Plants as Factors in the Development of Culture The use of—and the need for—psychoactive plants is very ancient. Some authors have suggested that the roots lie somewhere in the Paleolithic period (Ripinsky-Naxon 1989;Westermeyer 1988). It appears that the connection to shamanism was already present at an early date (La Barre 1972). Although I personally do not believe that shamanism was one of the very first religions, I do think that the altered states of consciousness and visions induced by psychoactive plants have led to significant cultural innovations. A person ingests a substance obtained from the environment and sinks into a flood of pictures, visions, and hallucinations. He is confronted by a previously unimagined quantity of images— images that seem somehow familiar, or archetypically known, we might say. Moreover, these images are complex and intricate, following one another in incredible sequences, and they have such detail that you cannot shake the feeling that\n\nIntroduction you have somehow landed on the molecular level or are somewhere far away, in the depths of infinite space. Where do these pictures come from? Do they arise in the human brain as a result of the material interaction between molecules from without and the brain stem? Can we, using these substances that come from outside of ourselves, look into realities that truly are outside and for which we normally have no perception? No matter the answer, the wonder or the mystery remains the same! Wherever the images come from, they are present, they can be perceived, they are a reality that can be experienced. Many cultures and many researchers have concerned themselves with these questions. Although no one has been able to provide a definitive answer, the hypotheses and positions that have been put forth can be divided into two camps. One assumes that all reality is merely a projection of our own consciousness; the other holds that there are numerous or even infinitely many different realities in the external world. We can take shamanism seriously only if we follow the second view, for if we assume that the shaman is only flying around within his own skull, then he would not be able to recover, liberate, and bring back stolen souls. The internal images and visions induced by psychoactive plants appear to have influenced human art since the Stone Age (Biedermann 1984; Braem 1994). African rock art has been interpreted as an expression of altered states of consciousness, most likely induced by mushrooms or similar substances (Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988, 1993). American Indian rock art has also been inspired by experiences with psychoactive plants (Wellmann 1978, 1981). The images in the world of Hieronymus Bosch have been interpreted as the product of drug experiences as well. Nineteenth-century art would have been inconceivable without psychoactive plants (Kupfer 1996a, 1996b). To the observer, many of the pictures of the surrealists, especially those of Max Ernst, Rene Magritte, and Salvador Dali, appear to be \"drug pictures\" or remind one of one's own experiences in altered states. Hashish appears to have played a role in the development of surrealism, the philosophy of which was set forth in the Surrealist Manifesto of 1924: \"Surrealism rests upon the belief in the greater reality of certain forms of associations that have been neglected until now, in the omnipotence of dreams, in the non-utilitarian play of thought\" (Breton 1968, 26f.). The founder of surrealism compared this art form with the effects of psychoactive substances:\n\nSurrealism does not permit those who follow it to abandon it whenever they will. Everything points to the fact that it affects the mind in the same way as stimulants do; like these, it produces a certain condition of need and is able to drive a person to terrible revolts. Once again, if you will, we stand before a very artificial paradise, and our penchant to enter into it falls with the same rights under the same Baudelairean criticism as all the others. Thus, the analysis of the mysterious effects and special pleasures which it can impart—in some ways, Surrealism appears to be a new vice, which is not suitable for just a few; like hashish, it is able to satisfy all those who are particular—thus, such an analysis must be undertaken within this investigation. Surrealistic images are like those pictures from opium inebriation, which a person is no longer evoking, but which are \"spontaneously and tyrannically presented to him. He is incapable of fending them off; for the will has lost its power and no longer controls his abilities.\" (Baudelaire) The question remains as to whether one ever \"evoked\" the images at all. (Breton 1968,34) It appears that experimentation with psychoactive substances provided an important impetus to the art scene surrounding fantastic realism. Only a few artists, however, have publicly admitted as much. Ernst Fuchs even denied his drug experiences in one of his early biographies (Muller-Ebeling 1992). For most artists, it appears that the use of hashish and marijuana does not necessarily affect the creative process but functions instead as a way to focus concentration, in the way that some Indians use hashish in their meditation practice (e.g., Gustav Klimt). Albert Paris Gutersloh, an admitted cannabis user, provided a realistic assessment of the situation: Every [artist] of my generation has made the acquaintance of hashish, and when I walk through the academy and sniff, I am certain: everyone in my class, at least, has as well. Does this mean that we are all hash artists? (cited in Behr1995) The discipline of anthropology provides us with many examples of cultural goods or artifacts that are the direct result of visionary experiences with psychoactive plants and products (Andritsky 1995). The yarn paintings of the Huichol are representations of their experiences with peyote, and the visions induced by ayahuasca have been the subject of numerous ayahuasca paintings.\n\nThe most important magical plants of Mexico were first described in the Aztec-language work of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun, the Florentine Codex: 515 Tlapatl (Datura spp.); 516 Nanacatl (Psilocybe spp.); 517 Peyotl (Lophophora williamsii); 518 Toloa (Datura innoxia). (Paso y Troncoso edition)\n\n21\n\nThe Psychoactive Plants \"My heart wears flowers and fruits in the midst of the n i g h t . . . I, Cinteotl [=Xochipilli], was born in paradise. I come from the land of flowers. I am the new, the glorious, the unequaled flower. Cinteotl was born of the water; as a mortal, as a young man he was born from the heavenly blue House of the Fishes. A new, victorious god. He shines like the sun. His mother lived in the House of the Twilight, as colorful as a Quetzal, a new, delightful flower.\" AZTEC HYMN IN MEXIKANISCHE MYTHOLOGIE [MEXICAN MYTHOLOGY] (NICHOLSON 1967,115 f)\n\nDepicted here in a state of ecstasy, Xochipilli, the flower prince, was the Aztec god of psychoactive plants, eroticism, spring, inspiration, and music. This pre-Columbian statue clearly illustrates the great importance that people have placed upon visions as well as the manners in which such experiences have found expression in art.\n\n12 Many psychopharmacological drugs and medicines used in psychiatry exert a palliative effect upon sick people but have no effects upon healthy individuals (cf. V. Faust 1994).\n\n24\n\nWhich plants have been included in this encyclopedia? I considered all of those plants that my own research and experience have indicated to be psychoactive as well as those plants that other researchers or the literature have reported to be psychoactive. Here, we must keep in mind that there are plants for which a majority of subjects have reported no psychoactive effects. There also are plants that have a reputation of being hallucinogenic, but which no one has yet tried. To date, many of these plants have been the object of only cursory investigation. There also are a number of plants that have not yet been botanically determined or identified. The situation is complicated by the fact that the botanical data contained in the ethnographic literature are often incorrect, or at least very imprecise. Sometimes, it was difficult to decide whether a particular plant should be included in this work or not. One such case is St. John's wort (Hypericum perforation L.), which the ancient Germans used as a sedative and in modern phytotherapy is generally regarded as a natural tranquilizer (Becker 1994). St. John's wort and the oil it yields do indeed exert a psychoactive effect, but only upon patients suffering from mental or emotional afflictions. As a rule, healthy individuals do not notice any psychotropic effects, even after ingesting large amounts.12 Such uncertain cases—to the extent that they are known— have not been included in these monographs. Reflecting our current state of knowledge, I have treated the various psychoactive plants discussed in this book in several different ways. Wellknown plants that have been investigated in some detail are examined in a very systematic fashion in the major monographs. Plants that have been little studied or about which very little is known are\n\ndiscussed in informal minor monographs. A number of very well-known and well-researched plants that are purported to produce psychoactive effects and are sometimes referred to as \"legal highs\" are considered in their own small section of informal monographs. This is followed by another section that focuses on a number of psychoactive plants whose botanical identity is unknown. Because they are not plants in the strict sense, psychoactive fungi are presented in a section of their own. The section on psychoactive fungi is followed by another that focuses on psychoactive products that are obtained through often intricate procedures and/or from combinations of plants. Finally, there is a short section that examines the psychoactive constituents of plants. This section also serves as an aid in locating the plants discussed in the monographs.\n\nOn the Structure of the Major Monographs The monographs are arranged alphabetically according to botanical names. Below the scientific name may been found the most common English name(s) or, when none is known, a common international name. Some of the monographs treat not just one species but, rather, a number of species of the same genus. This is done either because the traditional users make no distinction between the different species or because the species all contain the same active constituents and/or are sources of the same products. Family Here, information is provided about the botanical family to which the plant belongs, along with additional details about taxonomy. Forms and Subspecies Any known forms, varieties, cultivars, or subspecies of the plant are listed here. Synonyms Most plants have been described in the botanical literature under more than one name. Under this heading may be found these nonvalid botanical names (including misspellings in the literature). Folk Names Folk and popular names are given here. Often, information is also furnished about the particular language a name is taken from, and translations of many of the terms are provided. Please note that the names of indigenous tribes and tribal languages referenced in these sections will be spelled in a variety of ways, rather than uniformly. The variant spellings reflect the spellings found in the literature referenced for each plant.\n\nThe Psychoactive Plants History Here may be found the most important information about the history of the plant, including its discovery, botanical description, and historical\n\nDistribution Under this heading is provided information concerning the range as well as the natural occurrence of the plant in question. Cultivation Information about the more simple and successful methods of growing and cultivating a plant is provided under this heading. It should be noted, however, that more is required to successfully grow these plants than simply reading this information; it is also helpful to have a \"green thumb,\" experience, skill, and a deep love of the plant world. Appearance Here is provided a brief description of the plant. Other plants that might possibly be mistaken for it are mentioned, and the plant's distinguishing features are emphasized. It should be noted that the information contained under this heading does not always conform to the standardized botanical descriptions (which may be found in the botanical literature). Psychoactive Material Under this heading, information is provided about the parts of the plant that are utilized, as well as products obtained from them (where appropriate, the pharmaceutical names of the raw drugs are also given). Preparation and Dosage Here may be found information for preparing and dosing the various raw drugs. While every attempt has been made to ensure that this information is as accurate as possible, it must be explicitly stated that this information should not be regarded as definitive. Identical dosages can produce very different responses in different individuals. Ritual Use Information concerning the traditional uses of the plant in shamanic rituals, priestly ceremonies, domestic festivals, and other experiences may be found here. As in the Folk Names sections, the spelling of indigenous tribal names will reflect the variant spellings found in the literature referenced.\n\nArtifacts Where possible, reference is made to three types of artifacts associated with the plant: — Artifacts composed of the plant or manufactured from it — Artistic representations of the plant (in paintings, architecture, etc.) — Art works (paintings, poetry, music, theater pieces, etc.) whose inspiration has come from the use of the plant. Medicinal Use Many psychoactive plants are also of medicinal and therapeutic significance. Sometimes a plant's medicinal applications are much more important than its psychoactive uses. For these reasons, as much information as possible is provided about the medicinal uses of the plant under discussion. This includes ethnomedical, folk medical, biomedical, and homeopathic uses. Constituents Under this heading may be found a comprehensive listing of the known constituents of the plant. Effects Here, the effect or the pattern of effects of the plant is described. Once again, it should be kept in mind that different individuals can have very different experiences with the same plant. Commercial Forms and Regulations Many plants and/or the raw drugs obtained from them are available through commercial sources. Some plants are subject to particular regulations or laws. Pertinent information is included under this heading. Literature Here, references are provided to specialized literature on the plant under discussion. Symbol Key Those sources marked in the monographs with a* are listed in the general bibliography located at the end of this book (pages 878-907). Those marked with a ** may be found in the general literature on psychoactive fungi (pages 689-693), which follows the section devoted to them. Terms in bold print within the running text refer to other entries in this book. Where a question mark has been inserted in a table column, it indicates that the missing information poses an important question for further research.\n\n25\n\nThe Most Important Genera and Species from A to Z Major Monographs The following genera are discussed in the major monographs:\n\nMammillaria, Mandragora, Mesembryanthemum, Mimosa, Mitragyna, Mucuna, Myristica\n\nAcacia, Aconitum, Acorus, Agave, Alstonia, Anadenanthera, Areca, Argemone, Argyreia, Ariocarpus, Artemisia, Arundo, Atropa\n\nNicotiana, Nuphar, Nymphaea\n\nBanisteriopsis, Boswellia, Brugmansia, Brunfelsia Calea, Calliandra, Camellia, Cannabis, Carnegia, Catha, Cestrum, Cinnamomum, Coffea, Cola, Coleus, Convolvulus, Corynanthe, Coryphantha, Cytisus\n\nPachycereus, Papaver, Passiflora, Paullinia, Pausinystalia, Peganum, Pelecyphora, Petroselinum, Phalaris, Phragmites, Phytolacca, Piper, Psidium, Psychotria Rhynchosia Salvia, Sassafras, Sceletium, Scopolia, Solandra, Solarium, Sophora, Strychnos\n\nDatura, Desfontainia, Diplopterys, Duboisia Echinops, Ephedra, Erythrina, Erythroxylum, Escholzia\n\nTabernaemontana, Tabernanthe, Tagetes, Tanaecium, Theobroma, Trichocereus, Turbina, Turnera\n\nHeimia, Humulus, Hyoscyamus\n\nVaccinium, Veratrum, Virola, Vitis\n\nIlex, lochroma, Ipomoea\n\nWithania\n\nJuniperus, Justicia Lactuca, Latua, Ledum, Leonurus, Lolium, Lonchocarpus, Lophophora\n\nLeft: Latua pubiflom, known as the tree of the magicians, is one of the world's rarest shamanic plants. The flower of this nightshade is 3 to 4 cm in length. (Photographed near Osorno, in southern Chile) 27\n\nAcacia Spp. Acacia Species Family Leguminosae: Mimosaceae (Fabaceae) (Legume Family) Synonyms Many species of the genus Acacia were formerly assigned to the genera Mimosa, Pithecolobium, Senegalia, and Racosperma. In addition, some species previously described under the genus name Acacia have now been reclassified as Anadenanthera (see Anadenanthera colubrina) and Mimosa (see Mimosa tenuiflora, Mimosa spp.).\n\nNumerous acacias have played a role in ethnopharmacology and medical history. Some species (such as gum arabic) are used as sources for an excipient and incense, some are used as beer additives, and others provide DMT and other tryptamines. (Woodcut from Tabernaemontanus, Neu Vollkommen Krauter-Buch, 1731)\n\nLeft: Many Australian acacias contain high concentrations of N,N-DMT and are thus suitable for the production of psychedelic ayahuasca analogs. Although our studies of Australia's psychoactive flora have only just begun, they already have demonstrated great promise. (Acacia spp., photographed in southeastern Australia) Right: Catechu, the resin of the catechu tree (Acacia catechu), is one of the main ingredients in betel quids. (Photograph: Karl-Christian Lyncker) 13 Seeds of Datura stramonium are also added to dolo beer (Voltz 1981, 176).\n\n28\n\nGeneral The genus Acacia encompasses 750 to 800 species (other sources list only approximately 130) found in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world (Harnischfeger 1992). Most are mediumsized trees, the leaves of which are usually pinnate but sometimes edentate. The flowers appear in clusters and produce podlike fruits. Some species are sold as cut flowers under the name \"mimosa.\" Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd. yields an essential oil that is used as an aromatic substance in aromatherapy and in the manufacture of perfumes (Bartels 1993, 89*). Some acacias (such as gum arabic) have been used since ancient times as excipients for compound medicines and incense. Some species find use as additives in psychoactive products (betel quid, beer, balche', pituri; for pulque, cf. Agave spp.). Many species are suitable for producing ayahuasca analogs. The bark and/or leaves of numerous Australian acacia species (A. maidenii, A. phlebophylla, A. simplicifolia) contain high concentrations of N,N-DMT (Fitzgerald and Sioumis 1965; Ott 1994, 85f.*; Rovelli and Vaughan 1967). Acacia angustifolia (Mill.) Kuntze [syn. Acacia angustissima (Mill.) Kuntze, Acacia filiciana Willd.]—pulque tree, timbre The root of this Mexican acacia provides an\n\nadditive to pulque (a fermented beverage made from Agave spp.) that may have psychoactive effects. The Aztecs called this small tree ocpatl, \"pulque drug\"; in contemporary Mexican Spanish, it is known as palo de pulque, \"tree of pulque.\" Acacia albicans Kunth [syn. Pithecolobium albicans (Kunth) Benth.] was also used as a pulque additive. Acacia baileyana F. von Muell. This Australian acacia is found in New South Wales. It contains psychoactive p-phenethylamines, including tetrahydroharman, and may be suitable as an MAO-inhibiting additive in the preparation of ayahuasca analogs. Acacia campylacantha Hochst. ex A. Rich [syn. Acacia polyacantha Willd. ssp. campylacantha} The leaves of this Old World species contain N,NDMT and other tryptamines (Wahba Khalil and Elkeir 1975). In West Africa, the bark is traditionally used as a psychoactive additive to a type of beer known as dolo13 that is brewed from certain cereal grains (Sorghum spp., Pennisetum spp.), sometimes with the addition of honey. The alcohol content normally ranges between 2 and 4%, and from 8 to 10% when honey has been added (Voltz 1981, 176). Dolo is consumed as a libation during offering ceremonies and other rites as well as in daily life. Its properties are held in high regard: \"Dolo imparts strength and courage and brings a joy of living. It is customary to drink dolo when performing strenuous work. The farmer who is making a piece of wilderness cultivable, the smith who is working hard at the anvil, the warrior who is preparing himself for battle, the woman who is in labor, the dancer who will be wearing the heavy, sacred mask . . . , all of them receive strength and courage from dolo, which is offered to them by their mother, wife, or sister\" (Voltz 1981, 178).\n\nAcacia spp. Acacia catechu (L. f.) Willd.—catechu tree This acacia species, found in India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, can grow as tall as 20 meters. It is also known as cutch tree, khair, kath, katha, khadira, and ercha. Its heartwood is boiled in water for twelve hours to concentrate the extract, which is known as catechu, katechu, catechu nigrum, extractum catechu, succus catechu, terra catechu, terra japonica, pegu, black catechu, cutch, cachou, katha, khair, terra giapponica, khadira, and cato de pegu. Essentially four types are found in trade: Pegu catechu (= Bombay catechu), the most common type; Bengali catechu; Malaccan catechu; and Camou catechu (Harnischfeger 1992, 31). Catechu is an ancient Indian drug and is still officinal in Germany as well (DAB6).* In Vedic times, the bark of Acacia catechu was known as somatvak and was associated with soma. Catechu is odorless and has a bitter, astringent taste that slowly turns sweet. It is largely water soluble and can be crystallized back out again. It is composed of flavonols and glycosides (fisetin, quercetin [cf. Psidium guajava, Vaccinium uliginosum], quercitrin), as well as flavonoids (catechine, catechin tanning agents) and red pigments (Harnischfeger 1992, 31). Catechu is thus responsible for the reddish coloration of the saliva that occurs when betel quids are chewed (Atkinson 1989, 775*). In India and Nepal, catechu is used in dyeing and tanning. In the local ethnomedicine, it is employed as a tonic and for digestive ailments and skin diseases. However, the greatest economic significance of catechu is as a (coloring) additive to betel quids (Storrs 1990, 5*). In Indian medicine, catechu is an ingredient\n\nin recipes for treating ulcers on the mucous membranes of the mouth, inflamed throats, and toothaches (Harnischfeger 1992, 32). Catechu is a definite tannin drug that is suitable for treating inflammations of the mucous membranes and diarrhea (Pahlow 1993, 453*). Catechu has no psychoactive effects of its own but is simply an important component of a psychoactive product; however, it may have synergistic effects in this. Acacia confusa Merr. This acacia species contains N,N-DMT and is usable as an additive in ayahuasca analogs. Acacia cornigera (L.) Willd. [syn. Acacia spadicigera Cham, et Schlechtend.]—horned acacia The large binate thorns of this striking acacia are hollow and provide a home for ants. In Mayan, the small tree (also known as akunte') is called subin, \"dragon.\" It plays an important role in the magical preparation of the ritual drink known as balche'. It is possible that parts of the tree were formerly added to the drink. The bark may contain N,NDMT. The Maya of San Antonio (Belize) use its roots and bark to treat snakebites. The root is made into a tea that is also consumed as an aphrodisiac and as a remedy for impotence. Other preparations are used to treat asthma and headaches (Arvigo and Balick 1994, 81*).\n\nThe Acacia catechu tree, indigenous to South Asia, produces a substance known as catechu, which is an important ingredient in betel quids.
