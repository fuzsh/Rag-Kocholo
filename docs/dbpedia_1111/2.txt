We’re delighted to have singer, songwriter and actor Eve von Bibra from The Chantoozies as our special guest on the first Food Bytes podcast of 2022.

Eve talks openly and honestly about the challenges of finding our ‘new normal’ whilst living through a pandemic, the importance of looking after our health and the joys of making pizzas with the little loves of her life, her eight year old twin nephews.

Ahead of the Friday Food Poll’s return, we’re also tracking the predicted food trends of 2022 in this ep, and they might surprise you!

It’s all thanks to our wonderful friends at Cheeselinks
