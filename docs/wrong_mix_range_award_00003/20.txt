Founder of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran and Nobel Peace Prize laureate

Shirin Ebadi is an Iranian political and human rights activist, lawyer and former judge. She is the founder of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts for democracy and human rights.

She worked as a judge in Teheran and was the first women and the youngest judge to become head of Branch 26 of the Tehran City Court. After the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the firing of all female judges, she decided to retire early before establishing a private law firm to handle human rights cases in 1992. As the lawyer for many controversial political and human rights cases in Iran, her activities led to her arrest and a prison sentence.

When she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, part of the money was allocated to establish the office of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran and to support the families of political prisoners. The center became a leading human rights organization but its offices were closed by the security forces and its building confiscated in 2008. Shirin Ebadi left Iran in 2009 due to severe restrictions imposed on human rights activists but she continues her activities in forced exile.
