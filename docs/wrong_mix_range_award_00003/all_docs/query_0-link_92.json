        "text": "Book Summary\n\nThe first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, Shirin Ebadi has inspired millions around the globe through her work as a human rights lawyer defending women and children against a brutal regime in Iran. Now Ebadi tells her story of courage and defiance in the face of a government out to destroy her, her family, and her mission: to bring justice to the people and the country she loves.\n\nFor years the Islamic Republic tried to intimidate Ebadi, but after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad rose to power in 2005, the censorship and persecution intensified. The government wiretapped Ebadi's phones, bugged her law firm, sent spies to follow her, harassed her colleagues, detained her daughter, and arrested her sister on trumped-up charges. It shut down her lectures, fired up mobs to attack her home, seized her offices, and nailed a death threat to her front door. Despite finding herself living under circumstances reminiscent of a spy novel, nothing could keep Ebadi from speaking out and standing up for human dignity.\n\nBut it was not until she received a phone call from her distraught husband - and he made a shocking confession that would all but destroy her family - that she realized what the intelligence apparatus was capable of to silence its critics. The Iranian government would end up taking everything from Shirin Ebadi - her marriage, friends, and colleagues, her home, her legal career, even her Nobel Prize - but the one thing it could never steal was her spirit to fight for justice and a better future. This is the amazing, at times harrowing, simply astonishing story of a woman who would never give up, no matter the risks. Just as her words and deeds have inspired a nation, Until We Are Free will inspire you to find the courage to stand up for your beliefs.\n\nMedia Reviews\n\n\"Starred Review. A revealing portrait of the state of political oppression in Iran ... [Ebadi] is an inspiring figure, and her suspenseful, evocative story is unforgettable.\" - Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Ebadi's courage and strength of character are evident throughout this engrossing text, which illuminates the power the few have had over the many, particularly the women and children of Iran.\" - Kirkus\n\n\"Shirin Ebadi is quite simply the most vital voice for freedom and human rights in Iran.\" - Reza Aslan, author of No god but God and Zealot\n\n\"Shirin Ebadi writes of exile hauntingly and speaks of Iran, her homeland, as the poets do. Ebadi is unafraid of addressing the personal as well as the political and does both fiercely, with introspection and fire.\" - Fatima Bhutto, author of The Shadow of the Crescent Moon\n\n\"I would encourage all to read Dr. Shirin Ebadi's memoir and to understand how her struggle for human rights continued after winning the Nobel Peace Prize. It is also fascinating to see how she has been affected positively and negatively by her Nobel Prize. This is a must read for all.\" - Desmond Tutu\n\nThis information about Until We Are Free was first featured in \"The BookBrowse Review\" - BookBrowse's membership magazine, and in our weekly \"Publishing This Week\" newsletter.

In the 1990s Ebadi returned to the law as a defender of women's and children's rights, founding a human rights center that spearheaded legal reform and public debate around the Islamic Republic's discriminatory laws. She has defended many of the country's most prominent prisoners of conscience and spent nearly a month in prison in 1999 for her activities. For many years she was at the center of Iran's grassroots women's movement. In 2003 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work. Since the election uprising of June 2009 she has lived in exile.\n\nMore Author Information"
