        "meta_description": "With great emotion, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) hails the news that Narges Mohammadi – an Iranian journalist RSF has been defending for years – has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her “fight against the oppression of women in Iran,” her courage and determination. Persecuted by the Iranian authorities since the late 1990s for her work, and imprisoned again since November 2021, she must be freed at once, RSF says.",

        "text": "“Speak to save Iran” is the title of one of the letters published by Mohammadi from Evin prison, near Tehran, where she has been serving a sentence of 10 years and 9 months in prison since 16 November 2021. She has also been sentenced to hundreds of lashes. The maker of a documentary entitled “White Torture” and the author of a book of the same name, Mohammadi has never stopped denouncing the sexual violence inflicted on women prisoners in Iran.\n\nIt is this fight against the oppression of women that the Nobel Committee has just saluted by awarding the Peace Prize to this 51-year-old journalist and human rights activist, the former vice-president of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre, the Iranian human rights organisation that was created by Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian lawyer who was herself awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.\n\nIt is because of this fight that Mohammadi has been hounded by the Iranian authorities, who continue topersecute her in prison. She has been denied visits and telephone calls since 12 April 2022, cutting her off from the world. At the same time, the authorities in Evin prison have brought new charges to keep her in detention. On 4 August, her jail term was increased by a year after the publication of another of her letters about violence against fellow women detainees."
