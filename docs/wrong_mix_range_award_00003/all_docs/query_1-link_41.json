        "text": "Early life, career, and activism\n\nMohammadi was born in 1972 in Zanjān, a city northwest of Tehrān with a predominantly ethnic Azeri population. In 1978, on the eve of the Iranian Revolution (1979), the city witnessed a major confrontation with the military. Her maternal uncle was a political activist, and he was imprisoned both before and after the revolution. Her mother visited him once a week and paid frequent attention to local newscasts about prisoners, listening to hear any updates about relatives. In 1981 Mohammadi saw her mother wailing on the floor after hearing on the television that her cousin—her mother’s nephew—had been executed. Mohammadi’s uncle was executed a few years later.\n\nThose early experiences left Mohammadi preoccupied with the treatment of political prisoners. When she studied physics in the early 1990s at Imam Khomeini University in Qazvīn, she was heavily involved in civic engagement on campus, including founding a political group for students. It was at the university that she met Taghi Rahmani, an intellectual associated with the Melli Mazhabi (Nationalist-Religious) movement, which has been influenced by the works of ʿAli Shariʿati and has called for liberal reform in the vein of Mehdi Bazargan, the first postrevolutionary prime minister (February–November 1979) of the Islamic Republic. Mohammadi and Rahmani married in 1999, and in 2006 they had twins—a girl and a boy—together.\n\nMeanwhile, in addition to her job as an engineer for a building inspections company, Mohammadi began writing for publications that favored the Reformist political bloc (see Iran: Political process), focusing especially on human rights and women’s issues. At about the same time, in 1997, the election of Pres. Mohammad Khatami, a Reformist, set off a wave of euphoria among Iran’s more liberal individuals and institutions. Nonetheless, Iran’s security apparatus, which was tied more closely to the conservative rahbar (leader) Ali Khamenei than to the president, retained a hard line against activism. Rahmani was imprisoned twice for his political activity during Khatami’s presidency. The tension between the more open political environment but continued crackdown on dissent was embodied in the work of Shirin Ebadi, who was working as a human rights lawyer and helped found the Defenders of Human Rights Center in 2001. Mohammadi joined the organization in 2003.\n\nGovernment crackdown and Mohammadi’s imprisonment\n\nThe country took a decidedly authoritarian turn after the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. At the beginning of his presidency (2005–13), he stepped up enforcement of modest dress and chaste behavior with the institution of the Guidance Patrol (Gasht-e Ershad; also called the morality police) as a specialized unit within the Law Enforcement Command. Throughout his presidency the power and reach of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was greatly expanded, and Reformists and centrists were increasingly suppressed. In 2008 the Defenders of Human Rights Center was banned. Amid the crackdowns in the months before and after the 2009 election, Mohammadi was arrested for her participation in the organization, and her passport was confiscated. Ebadi went into exile soon afterward. In 2011, as Mohammadi and Rahmani faced continued legal struggles, Rahmani fled to France with their two children. Mohammadi, unable to leave the country, was arrested and charged several times in the years that followed. She was imprisoned continuously from 2016 to 2020 on charges related to her human rights activism.\n\nMohammadi was imprisoned again in 2021 after attending a memorial for Ebrahim Ketabdar, an activist killed during protests over an increase in fuel prices in 2019; she was charged with spreading propaganda against the state. Her nomination for the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2021 (which she did not win) was used as evidence in a conviction against her in January 2022. Those women imprisoned with her hailed her as a pillar of support and morale. Apart from her perseverance as an inmate and her persistent public activism, which provided them with encouragement, she led educational workshops and even dance parties. Reflecting her optimism, she told the Agence France-Presse in September 2023, “Prison has always been at the core of opposition, resistance, and struggle in my country, and for me it also embodies the essence of life in all its beauty.” On Evin prison, notorious for its harsh conditions and abuses, she said, “[Its] women’s wing is one of the most active, resistant, and joyful quarters of political prisoners in Iran.” But while noting the strength and value of her fellow inmates, she was also vocal about how they were treated in prison, detailing the abuses she witnessed and the torture she was subjected to. Her book White Torture: Interviews with Iranian Women Prisoners (2022) describes the experiences of 13 inmates.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

On October 1, 2023, a 16-year-old Iranian girl, Armita Geravand, was hospitalized in an incident similar to that involving Amini. As details became public later that week, Mohammadi released a statement condemning the government’s lack of transparency regarding the incident.\n\nOn October 6 Mohammadi was announced as the recipient of the 2023 Nobel Prize for Peace “for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and for her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all,” which the Norwegian Nobel Committee characterized as a “brave struggle [that] has come with tremendous personal costs.”"
