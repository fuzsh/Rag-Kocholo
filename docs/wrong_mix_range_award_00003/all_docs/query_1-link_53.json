Photo: Geir Anders Rybakken Ãrslie\n\nTawakkol Karman\n\nTawakkol Karman, a Yemeni journalist, was the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize from the Arab world. She shared the award with two Liberian women, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee, for their non-violent efforts to promote peace and their struggle for womenâs rights.\n\nShe led several protests against the dictatorial regime of President Saleh, calling for democracy and freedom of speech. She founded the organisation Women Journalists without Chains, and was imprisoned and persecuted on account of her active engagement.\n\nTawakkol Karman came forward as a courageous leadership figure during the Arab Spring in 2011 and was praised for her efforts to promote reconciliation between Sjia and Sunni Muslims and between Islam and other religions. Like Iranian Shirin Ebadi, Peace Prize laureate for 2003, she maintained that Islam is no obstacle to the full acceptance of women in every sphere of society.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDmitry Muratov\n\nDmitry Muratov started out as a journalist for Soviet newspapers. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, he and other journalists co-founded the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which soon became a leading advocate for democracy and freedom of expression in Russia.\n\nThe Soviet Unionâs last leader and the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Mikhail Gorbachev, supported the newspaper financially and became co-owner in 2006. Mr Muratov has been editor-in-chief for most years since 1995.\n\nUnder Mr Muratovâs leadership, Novaya Gazeta has criticised the Russian authorities for corruption, electoral fraud and human rights violations. Six of the newspaperâs journalists have been murdered because they wrote critical articles on Russian military operations in Chechnya and the Caucasus. The best known of them is Anna Politkovskaya. As editor-in-chief Mr Muratov has on several occasions criticised Russiaâs annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the governmentâs use of military force, both in and outside Russia.\n\nRead more here.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Saul Perlmutter\n\nPhoto: FolkhÃ¤lsomyndighetens presstjÃ¤nst\n\nPhoto courtesy of Saul Perlmutter\n\nPhoto: FolkhÃ¤lsomyndighetens presstjÃ¤nst\n\nSaul Perlmutter\n\nSaul Perlmutter grew up outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After studying at Harvard University, Perlmutter received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1986. He conducted his Nobel Prize-winning research at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Perlmutter is a co-founder of the Supernova Cosmology Project and a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe universeâs stars and galaxies are moving away from one another; the universe is expanding. Up until recently, the majority of astrophysicists believed that this expansion would eventually wane, due to the effect of opposing gravitational forces. Saul Perlmutter, Brian Schmidt, and Adam Riess studied exploding stars, called supernovae. Because the light emitted by stars appears weaker from a larger distance and takes on a reddish hue as it moves further from the observer, the researchers were able to determine how the supernovae moved. In 1998 they reached a surprising result: the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.\n\nRead more here.\n\nAnders Tegnell\n\nTegnell is the former State Epidemiologist in Sweden and the Deputy Director, as well as the head of the Department of Public Health Reporting, at the Public Health Agency.
