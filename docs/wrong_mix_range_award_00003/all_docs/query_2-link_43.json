        "text": "Shirin Ebadi is an Iranian lawyer and writer. She has fought for human rights, especially the rights of women and children, within Iran for many years. For this work, in 2003, she became the first Muslim woman and the first Iranian to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nEbadi was born on June 21, 1947, in Hamadan, Iran. She grew up in Tehran, Iran, where she attended school. She earned a law degree from the University of Tehran and soon became one of the first women judges in Iran. From 1975 to 1979 she was head of the city court of Tehran.\n\nIn 1979 a group of Islamic revolutionaries took over Iran. After that, women’s roles were limited. Ebadi and other women were not allowed to serve as judges. She resigned in protest. Ebadi then tried to practice law, but she was denied a license.\n\nIn 1992 Ebadi was finally given a license, and she began her own law practice. In her practice she defended women and many others who had come into conflict with the Iranian government. In 2000 she was found guilty of “disturbing public opinion.” The government accused her of spreading photos that made it look like government officials were involved in the murder of students at the University of Tehran. She was given a prison term, barred from practicing law for five years, and fined. However, her sentence was put on hold, and she did not have to carry it out.\n\nEbadi has written many books on human rights, including The Rights of the Child: A Study on Legal Aspects of Children’s Rights in Iran (1987; English translation, 1994) and History and Documentation of Human Rights in Iran (1993; English translation, 2000). Ebadi was a founder of the Association for Support of Children’s Rights in Iran."
