        "text": "The first Muslim woman to ever receive the Nobel Peace Prize, Shirin Ebadi has inspired millions around the globe through her work as a human rights lawyer defending women and children against a brutal regime in Iran. Now the film, Until We Are Free, tells her story of courage and defiance in the face of a government out to destroy her, her family, and her mission: to bring justice to the people and the country she loves. The Iranian government would end up taking everything from Shirin Ebadi – her marriage, her home, even her Nobel Prize medallion – but the one thing it could never steal was her spirit to fight for justice and a better future for the women of Iran.\n\nNOTE: This film will be followed by a personal message from Ms Ebadi offering a personal update on the fluid situation in Iran today.\n\nTHIS FILM IS ONLY AVAILABLE AT OUR IN-PERSON FRIDAY SHOWING OR AS PART OF A PASS.\n\nOpening Night in-person showing will include messages from Shirin Ebadi and director, Dawn Gifford Engle."
