        "text": "Although born in 1947 in Hamadan, Iran, jurist Shirin Ebadi moved to the capital, Tehran, with her religious middle-class family. Ebadi is one of the most famous female voices in Islamic reformism and human rights activism for women, children, and refugees in Iran. Her commitment to these issues won her the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize as the first Muslim woman and the first Iranian to ever win this award.\n\nIn 1969 Ebadi was the first woman appointed as a judge in Iran, and in 1975 she became the president of the National Association of Iranian Magistrates. She was obliged to resign from these positions following the 1978-1979 Islamic Revolution, because, according to a radical interpretation of Islam implemented by the new political leadership, women were considered âtoo sensitiveâ to hold such positions. Ebadi herself, extremely critical of the Shahâs regime, initially supported the Islamic revolution. Although Ebadi became certified to practice law in 1984, she was not permitted to exercise her profession until 1993, and that same year, she began to work on defending and promoting womenâs rights in a judicial system in which they were, and still are, greatly diminished.\n\nAbove all, Ebadi has fought for reform in the marriage laws, trying to gain rights for women to obtain fairer divorce and child custody conditions. Through this work, Ebadi became a leading player in a series of court cases that caused uproar in Iran.\n\nLater on Ebadi took the lead in sponsoring an International Womenâs Day in Iran, as well as a series of protest events against Iranian family law.\n\nIn addition to having published numerous books, among them, Iran Awakening, A Memoir of Revolution and Hope (Milan 2006), as well as The Golden Cage, Three Brothers, Three Choices, One Destiny (Milan 2008), Ebadi founded the Defenders of Human Rights Centre in Iran and the Society for Protecting the Child’s Rights. These two organizations are NGOs for the defence of human rights, which focus on strengthening the legal status of women and children in Iran.\n\nIn 1997 Ebadi played an important role in the campaign supporting reformist president Mohammad Khatami, while continuing with her constant commitment, as a lawyer and an activist, to supporting dissidents persecuted by the regime. Since 2009, the year in which officers belonging to Ahmadinejadâs government broke into her apartment, beat her husband, and seized the Nobel Prize she had won in 2003, she has lived in exile in London. There she continues to work, actively criticizing the Iranian legal system, as well as working on many campaigns for the defence of Iranian human rights."
