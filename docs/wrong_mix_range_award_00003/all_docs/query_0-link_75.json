        "text": "Narges Mohammadi, who has won the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize, has for years been a prominent human rights figure in Iran.\n\nShe was awarded the prize for her fight against the oppression of women in the country, with the head of the Nobel committee calling her a \"freedom fighter\". She has also tirelessly campaigned for the abolition of the death penalty in Iran, which has one of the highest execution rates in the world.\n\nDespite being in jail almost continuously since 2010, Ms Mohammadi has managed to publicise abuses even from inside prison.\n\nMs Mohammadi, 51, has been arrested 13 times, convicted five times, and sentenced to a total of 31 years in prison. She is currently in jail for \"spreading propaganda\".\n\nHer husband, political activist Taghi Rahmani, lives in exile in Paris with their two children and they have not seen one another for years.\n\nMr Rahmani told BBC Persian his wife was \"a representative of all those whom this prize has gone to. It belongs to Woman, Life, Freedom [the slogan adopted by protesters], which was a huge movement in Iran and still continues to exist. It makes us very happy.\"\n\nIn awarding Ms Mohammadi the prize, the head of the Nobel committee noted that she fought for women against systemic discrimination and oppression.\n\nDespite her incarceration, Ms Mohammadi has not been silenced. Last year, in a letter from Evin Prison in Tehran she detailed how women detained in the anti-government protests which were then sweeping the country were being sexually and physically abused.\n\nThe protests were triggered by the death in custody in September 2022 of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, arrested for allegedly violating strict dress codes.\n\nMs Mohammadi also wrote a book, White Torture: Interviews with Iranian Women Prisoners, documenting her own and 12 other inmates' experiences of solitary confinement.\n\n\"I declare once more that this is a cruel and inhumane punishment,\" she wrote. \"I will not rest until it is abolished.\"\n\nMs Mohammadi's achievement comes 20 years after the peace prize was awarded to another Iranian human rights activist, Shirin Ebadi. Ms Mohammadi is vice-president of the Defender of Human Rights Center in Iran, which was founded by Ms Ebadi.\n\nMs Mohammadi has won a string of human rights awards down the years, but the fact that she has received the world's most prestigious peace accolade gives her a level of international recognition which will not be welcomed by Iran."
