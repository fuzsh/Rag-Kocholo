        "text": "Dr. Shirin Ebadi, winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize, spoke to a rapt audience for this year's University of Alberta Visiting Lectureship in Human Rights. Focusing on human rights issues in her home country of Iran, Ebadi spoke on a wide variety of topics including globalization, discrimination, and international relations.\n\nA graduate from the University of Tehran, Ebadi has been in the news recently for representing the family of Zahra Kazemi, the Iranian-Canadian photojournalist who died in police custody in July 2003. The Tehran police officers accused of killing Kazemi were acquitted, provoking an international outcry. When asked about the case, Ebadi garnered applause by stating, \"As the lawyer for this case, I will not stop until justice is restored.\"\n\nEbadi praised university faculty as \"people who are proud of themselves not because of their bank accounts but because of the number of books they have authored; people who are proud of the students they have educated, and not just proud of their material possessions.\"\n\nAccording to Ebadi, it is these people who will move society in the direction of peace. Speaking Farsi through a translator, she said that people who are content to serve others function as \"pillars of eternal peace\" and form the base for knowledge and cooperation. \"It is only under peaceful and calm circumstances that knowledge can be pursued and creativity flourishes, and only under those circumstances can we move forward.\"\n\nShe went on to thank Canadians for allowing Iranians to study and teach in Canada. \"The exchange of students and professors, translating books into other languages, organizing international conferences - all these are big steps in achieving international and scientific communication,\" Ebadi said.\n\nHowever, \"after the events of September 11, studying in some advanced fields like information technology, nuclear engineering and genetic engineering (was) prohibited in the United States for students coming from developing countries,\" Ebadi said.\n\n\"If you look at the world as an international village, then all should benefit equally from all its blessings, including science,\" she said. \"We can't brag about globalization and then deprive people from another part of the world knowledge.\"\n\nIran was rated by UNESCO as the country where the largest numbers of educated people are leaving. \"This is a catastrophe for a country, and the government is to blame,\" Ebadi said. \"Finding a suitable job that would enable a person to manage his or her family is a dream for many young people.\"\n\nEbadi praised the Iranian government for adopting a global view of political, economical, and social rights. \"Unfortunately, some of the internal regulations do not correspond with the international obligations,\" she said. For example, gender discrimination still exists within law in Iran.\n\n\"A man can divorce his wife without having any legitimate reason; it's very difficult and sometimes impossible for women to ask for a divorce on their own,\" Ebadi said. The testimony of two women in court are equivalent to that of one man, and the life of a woman is worth half that of a man when calculating insurance settlements. As well, other laws have been developed that seem to lower women's worth even more. \"According to an Islamic penalty law approved in 1991, if a man finds his wife in bed with another man, he has the right to kill his wife and the other man and face no punishment,\" she said.\n\nOver the course of her career, Ebadi has been imprisoned and has had threats on her life. When asked by an audience member where she finds her personal courage, she said simply, \"I believe in the truth of my path and I also believe in God, and that gives me strength.\" Ebadi added later, \"When I look back I think my path has been correct so far, what I have done so far has been right.\"\n\nEbadi concluded her speech by exhorting the audience to pursue a path of peace and global co-operation.\n\n\"Let's be generous as sunlight, let's spread friendship like the wind. Let's be as furious and destructive as fire against ignorance and prejudice, let's allow the seed of kindness to grow within us as the earth does. Let's be kind to one another, let's be kind.\""
