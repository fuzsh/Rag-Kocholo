        "text": "Shirin Ebadi became Iran's first female judge when she was only 23. Yet this is perhaps the least remarkable aspect of a career that saw her become the first Iranian and first Muslim woman to be awarded the Nobel peace prize. Despite initially supporting the Iranian revolution, like many Iranians, Ebadi soon became its scourge. Although described as \"the worst nightmare of Iran's hardline clerics\", her fight for human rights, particularly those for women, is not anti-religion. \"I am against patriarchy, not Islam,\" she says.\n\nDemoted to a secretary in her own court by the regime, which considered women unsuitable to be judges, she set up her own pro bono law practice to focus on injustices in the legal system, acting for political dissidents and on child-abuse cases. One such case involved the rape and murder of 11-year-old Leila Fathi by three men. The girl's parents were unable to bring the men to justice as the cost of executing the male perpetrators was twice the compensation owed for the death of a girl.\n\nDespite being put on a death list by the regime, her brother-in-law being executed and enduring solitary confinement, Ebadi became the country's most high-profile human rights activist, founding the Human Rights Defenders Centre and helping to found the One Million Signatures Campaign. This grassroots campaign collected 1m signatures from women in support of changing discriminatory laws. The campaign has won numerous international prizes (including the 2009 Reach All Women in War Anna Politkovskaya award), but its members have also been harassed and even jailed."
