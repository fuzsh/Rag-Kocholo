Ben Meyers’ rating: 4.4|5.0 Starsìììì

Seabiscuit—unusually well done—teaches as well as entertains. It has an unexpected casting mix that one may expect to fail onscreen: Chris Cooper, Jeff Bridges, and Tobey McGuire. But it is a dynamite trio that completes each scene with realism and professionalism that lures its audience into sitting back and enjoying the show. The message that broken things can be mended whether they are human or animal and that one does not give up on life is particularly welcome and well presented. It’s an inspirational watch that revolves around ‘the little horse that could’. This movie deserves its addition to the family home video library.

Storyline

Inspiring story of a horse that is too small, a jockey who is too big, a horse trainer who has hit bottom, and a Buick car salesman who believes that such an impossible set of circumstances does not determine failure.
