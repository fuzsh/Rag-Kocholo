        "text": "Roderick D. Heath and Marilyn Ferdinand, two longtime participants in the Current Movies forum , got offline to see Sofia Coppola's second movie together. They then got back online to write reviews in tandem. The posters found the movie's lead actors, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, to make an emotionally rewarding couple.\n\nMr. Heath, visiting Ms. Ferdinand in Chicago from Australia, posted his review first:\n\nComing to the end of my long stay in the U.S., I think back on the first-run films I have seen in the course of my visit and see that they are a mixed and often excellent bunch. \"Seabiscuit,\" \"The Magdalene Sisters,\" \"Dirty Pretty Things,\" \"The Swimming Pool,\" \"Lawless Heart,\" \"The Holy Land,\" even the silly fun stuff, \"Identity,\" \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" have provided much entertainment and prove that current cinema is indeed far from moribund.\n\nIt’s perhaps fitting that the best was saved for last; Sofia Coppola’s \"Lost in Translation\" is a wry, haunted, deceptively plain tale of love and bewilderment. It ranks with \"Lawless Heart\" as the best film I’ve seen yet this year - perhaps better; I can only rely on how it lingers to tell - to which it has distinct similarities, especially in that film’s first \"episode.\"\n\nThe title is an excellent shorthand description for both the real and metaphoric, comic and tragic elements of the film. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an aging, washed-up movie star who has signed a lucrative $2 million advertising deal to flog Suntory Whiskey in Japan. He makes a nocturnal entrance into the over-lit neon prison of Tokyo in the back of a taxi, and finds himself confronted by massive billboards reflecting his own crumpled, vaguely pathetic visage back at himself. Of course, it’s only to himself that he’s pathetic; everyone else dotes on him as The Movie Star.\n\nSimultaneously, young bride Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and her publicity photographer husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) check into the same hotel, the Park Hyatt, a massive shining trap with towering views upon the city. Upon this masthead Bob and Charlotte are swaying in emotional and physical disconnection from the world, emphasized by the difficulties of finding one’s way around a foreign cacophonous city where few of the people who aren’t interested in your money can speak your language.\n\nBob is a veteran of 20-plus-year marriage to Lydia with whom he has brief, frustrating phone conversations, who sends him near-identical carpet samples to disseminate, and chides him by fax for forgetting their son’s birthday before departing. His problems of the day are contending with mercurial Japanese ad directors babbl[ing] incessant, enthusiastic instructions that come from the translator as brief, curt instruction, and making up suitably meaningful poses for stills. He passes through this web of inanity and fakery, staying alive by leaning on his own dry wit and downing product samples on the rocks.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
