        "text": "Twenty years after its theatrical release, Seabiscuit remains one of the best sports dramas to grace the screen.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Jul 25, 2023\n\nDirector Ross, his team of technicians, and performers (including 10 portraying the title character) made one of the greatest sports (and family friendly) films of all-time which will quite easily double for some as the light at the end of many tunnels.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Jan 13, 2022\n\nWhile not as epic as one might think given the studio build-up, Seabiscuit is nevertheless destined to become a classic.\n\nFull Review | Nov 15, 2019\n\nA high-quality telling of the inspirational true story behind America's own Phar Lap, an equine powerhouse that became a hero of the Depression era.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Oct 14, 2019\n\nSeabiscuit starts slow, finishes fast, not an eye without a tear, not a throat without a lump. It jumps out of the gate as a front-runner in the race for Hollywood's Triple Crown: best actor, best direction and best picture.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: A- | Jan 5, 2018\n\nIt's inspiring despite a sobering thesis: The future is intoxicating, but progress is a kind way of rendering someone's livelihood obsolete. Gary Ross probed the underdog principle's heart: Success outside the comfort zone is the sweetest of all.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Sep 23, 2010\n\nWriter-director Ross's true-believer American salesmanship%u2014inspired by Frank Capra and honed in Dave and Pleasantville--suits this story of American entrepreneurship, optimism, and resilience. [Blu-ray]\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Jun 19, 2009\n\nBecomes a tale about beating the odds, the triumph of competition, and how one small animal can bring a nation together to forget its miseries.\n\nFull Review | Apr 29, 2009\n\n[It] may be too airbrushed for its own good, but in the end nothing can stop this story from putting a lump in your throat.\n\nFull Review | Nov 1, 2007\n\nWe root for Seabiscuit, of course, but more out of obligation than devotion -- after all, we paid to see him.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jul 14, 2007"
