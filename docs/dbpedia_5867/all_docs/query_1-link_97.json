The owner of the horse is Charles Howard, and he hires a former partially-blind boxer with riding skills, Red Pollard, to work as his jockey. With the help of horse trainer Tom Smith, the three men train and promote Seabiscuit into becoming a house-hold name in America through the horse's racing victories. Along the way, accidents happen, but Seabiscuit and jockey prevail to instill inspiration."
