        "text": "I have a family portrait framed of the last day we were a family. It's one of those Old West yee-haw get ups. My mother dressed like a madame, my dad the sheriff, my sister a prostitute, and I was a bandit. My mother and sister have the biggest smiles, which for my sister was no small feat. She was on better picture-taking behavior, I suppose, because there was a professional behind the lense and not our mother. I would describe myself as trying to stay in character with a sly smolder. It was probably the first time my moustache was full and not thin and it gave me a little more confidence that had escaped me in life til that point. My dad is holding a rifle firmly and his eyes are stunned. I love this photo because what could be going through his mind then? Knowing that the next morning, because I'm flying back to Tennessee, he's going to tell the whole family that he's moving out to live with his secretary. And we're here taking a family portrait.\n\nI'm the only member of the family who displays this photo. It was a few months shy of 20 years ago that it was taken. There are two reasons why I display it. The first is that it's bizarre. The second is, because I lived with friends for my senior year of high school after my parents moved north, that it's the only professional photo of us we have after I'd finally hit my growth spurt and wasn't preyed on by predators. It marks me hitting adulthood with my family at the moment my dad decided to split. His splitting changed my entire dynamic with my family because it ruptured a very close relationship he had with my sister. And it brought me closer to my mother whom, truth be told, I didn't know well prior because I always sought my father's attention and because she worked nights many days of the week all my years growing up. I have always fled family like a bandit, wanting to live far flung places, and I kind of lived like an outlaw, too. But among them I was suddenly the peacekeeper. I had the unique perspective of seeing everyone's side and not thinking anyone did anything wrong — other than to take this photograph.\n\nWhenever my mom would visit me, I'd put it away. I think she and my dad are both happier as individuals now but it still strikes a nerve for her, being blindsided. Of course I'm armed with the perceptiveness of a rare memory I have from when I was very young which was watching my dad smack my mom's butt as she cleared the table and giggle to himself and I thought of how my parents interactions did not line up with romantic love that I'd seen on television or the movies. Were they even in love? was a thought that entered my eight-year old brain.\n\nShe visited last weekend and for the first time in 20 years I left it out. She stopped and looked and said \"oh my God, I thought I destroyed every copy of this!!\" I'm not sure how I had one, to be honest. I had a vague memory of my mom calling in tears saying they had to pay for the photos but she didn't want any and if anyone did to call the store and they'll ship it. I was the only one who requested it. Partially it was for the story behind it. I was studying creative writing after all. Moreover it was a tidy encapsulation of things that I knew would last longer than the oddity of the day itself.\n\nFor a split second, I felt a touch of guilt for having displayed this framed photo. My mother said what I always thought when I saw it, \"what was going through your father's mind that day? Family portraits, a dinner and a movie.\" I'd forgotten that we did anything else. I remember the next morning more clearly. My sister and my mother crying in the garage, our German shepherd crying between them, my father pulling his truck out to take me to the airport and tell me about all the thoughts that went through his head as he biked the Tour de France with some Belgians half a day behind Lance Armstrong. That's when he'd decided to do all this.\n\n\"Do you remember which movie we went to?\" I asked. My mom laughed and turned her mouth into a sour formation and her eyebrows turned crooked, \"Seabiscuit.\" We laughed for different reasons but I know that my mom laughed not because she has discerning taste in movies but because it was such a wholesome movie. Probably one that she'd love and rewatch if it weren't associated with more painful memories. I laughed because I'd recently talked about the title with Mia while we were doing research for one of our podcast episodes and it was the year that Seabiscuit was up for seven Oscars and I said, \"I don't remember a thing about the movie but I know I've seen it. It's Jeff Bridges and Tobey Maguire.\" No wonder I'd forgotten everything about it.\n\nI decided to rewatch it and it's instantly forgettable. The type of movie with saccharine narration of the world at large that essentially says government programs and federal jobs didn't lift America out of the Great Depression, hope did. And a discarded horse was what 40+ million people put all their hope into. History repeated itself because this became the most purchased drama ever on DVD. But that's not surprising due to what the movie is — an easy, simple story that still upholds American greatness; with the underdog beating the established. (A better encapsulation would be a different Jeff Bridges biopic, Tucker: The Man and His Dream but that's about how the government stifles innovation if it threatens one of the richest; push through it if you can! Fuck the little guy!) It's a bland four-course meal without any interest in pushing anything closer to the rail. But like the jockey atop a racehorse it's lightweight, harmless, sprite, and has a short shelf life.\n\nWhen Boise legend Gary Stevens appeared as a jockey needing tips from Tobey Maguire I thought to myself, it's too bad, my mom would absolutely love this. And a weird thing is, I know my dad owns it on DVD. As oblivious as he is in that picture."
