        "text": "Movies\n\nMovie: Nights in Rodanthe (2008)\n\nNicholas Sparks is a staple when it comes to NC-based romance. He’s set many of his books in various areas of North Carolina, with many of them taking place in the Outer Banks and other coastal areas like Wilmington. Nights in Rodanthe tells the dramatic story of a couple who fall in love during a hurricane on the island and spend the rest of their lives intertwined. This particular story and adaptation take place in, you guessed it, Rodanthe, and much of the movie was actually filmed there, as well.\n\nMovie: Message in a Bottle (1999)\n\nThis deeply romantic movie follows the story of a woman who finds a love letter in a bottle while on a trip to Cape Cod and traces its author back to the beaches of the Outer Banks. None of the actual filming of the movie took place on the Outer Banks, but it still seeks to capture the magic and romance of these beautiful barrier islands.\n\nMovie: Brainstorm (1983)\n\nThis science fiction film was filmed throughout North Carolina. It tells the story of a couple of scientists who invent a machine that allows people to share sensory experiences. One of the most poignant scenes in the movie (no spoilers) takes place at the Wright Brothers Memorial and was filmed in Kill Devil Hills as a homage to the brothers’ innovative contributions to science. If you’re interested in a road trip, other scenes were filmed in Raleigh, Pinehurst, and the Duke University Chapel in Durham.\n\nMovie: The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019)\n\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon was co-written and directed by OBX local Tyler Nilson and stars Shia LaBeouf, Zak Gottsagen, and Dakota Johnson. The film was shot in Savannah, Georgia and on the Outer Banks and tells the story of Zak, a 22-year-old man with Down Syndrome, who escapes his care home to pursue his dreams of becoming a professional wrestler.\n\nMovie: Send It (2019)\n\nSend It follows the story of Billy who is set to compete at a kiteboarding competition on the Outer Banks but ends up falling in love with a local girl. The film was actually shot on Hatteras Island and takes place during the Wind Voyager Triple-S Invitational, which is an actual kiteboarding tournament that takes place annually on Hatteras Island.\n\nMovie: Call Sign Romeo (2022)\n\nCall Sign Romeo was inspired by real events that took place at First Flight High School and the 2016 wrestling state championships. The story explores the life of Chris Torres who is a high school wrestler with dreams of getting into the Naval Academy. The film was primarily shot on the Outer Banks and most of the cast and crew were OBX locals.\n\nMovie: Sol (2012/Pending Re-release)\n\nFilmed almost exclusively in Jockey's Ridge State Park, Sol is a creative, indie film that premeiered at the London Science Fiction Film Festival in 2012. The film is described as Star Trek meets Lord of the Flies. The film is currently being rebranded as Sol: Invictus and you can view the updated trailer online here.\n\nTelevision Shows\n\nTV: Outer Banks\n\nAlright, you knew this one was coming. The show Outer Banks by Netflix has taken the world by storm and introduced a whole new generation of beautiful to these beautiful barrier islands. The show takes place in a fictional town on the theoretical “Outer Banks” of North Carolina in Kildare County…which sounds strangely close to Kill Devil Hills and Dare County, right? Even though the show wasn’t actually filmed in North Carolina, it still highlights many of the most important parts of living on the OBX including a deeply-rooted fishing culture, lighthouse, ferries, and, of course, shipwrecks and surfing. It’s a fun adventure that gives you a taste of a romantic Outer Banks that is exciting and definitely entertaining. Though, we do feel the need to point out that you can’t actually take a ferry from the Outer Banks to Chapel Hill.\n\nTV: AHS: Roanoke\n\nIf horror is more your genre, Ryan Murphey’s American Horror Story: Roanoke, is at least theoretically based on the mystery of the Lost Colony on Roanoke Island. Several episodes appear to take place in 1590 Roanoke, now Manteo, and show the origins of a colonial farmhouse that serves as the backdrop for a found-footage horror. During flashbacks in the original story, Murphy puts a spin on the disappearance of the Lost Colony that will feel somewhat familiar for AHS fans. And if horror isn’t your thing, you can still experience the splendor and wonder of the Lost Colony (without the scares) in America’s longest-running outdoor, Tony Award-winning drama “The Lost Colony” throughout the summer.\n\nTV: Wicked Tuna: Outer Banks\n\nThis spinoff series is about as real as it gets for fishermen off the coast. Now streaming on Disney+, Wicked Tuna: Outer Banks follows the wild and dangerous lives of fishermen as they depart from Wanchese Marina to catch prized bluefin tuna. The show explores rivalries between boats as well as important issues like overfishing and quota regulations. If you’re looking for a taste of excitement while catching a glimpse of the harsher realities of fishing for a living on the Outer Banks, this can be a great binge-worthy option.\n\nTV: The Andy Griffith Show (sort-of)\n\nAndy Griffith is arguably one of the Outer Banks’ most famous residents, having gotten his start by performing in “The Lost Colony” and retiring here until his death in 2012. When it comes to the famous Mayberry of the show, which aired from 1960 to 1968 with a total of 249 episodes, many articles will claim that it was based on Andy Griffith’s hometown of Mount Airy. However, Andy Griffith spent much of his life in Manteo, NC, and maintained his home here in the later years of his life. People who watch the show will feel bits and pieces of Griffith’s Manteo in his interpretation of Mayberry as perhaps a gentle blending of the two North Carolina towns that bore him."
