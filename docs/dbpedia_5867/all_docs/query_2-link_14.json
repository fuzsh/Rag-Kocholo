During the years of the Great Depression, this was the horse that became a hero.\n\nThe odds were incredible, the dream was impossible...and somehow, it actually happened.\n\nFrom Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Gary Ross comes the motion picture adaptation of the story that transfixed a nation from one of the most beloved and widely-read non­fiction hooks of the past decade: Seabiscuit.\n\nScreenwriter-director-producer Ross assembled an impressive list of seasoned and accomplished filmmaking talent, both in front of and behind the camera. Joining Maguire, Bridges and Cooper in the cast are Elizabeth Banks (Catch Me If You Can) as Marcela Howard, Charles Howard's wife; Hall of Fame Jockey Gary Stevens (in his motion picture debut) as George \"The Iceman\" Woolf, and William H. Macy (Jurassic Park III) as reporter \"Tick-Tock\" McGlaughlin.\n\nProducing, along with Gary Ross, are prolific and Oscar-nominated filmmakers Kathleen Kennedy (E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, A.I. Artificial Intelligence) and Frank Marshall (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Hook), and Jane Sindell. The film is based on the best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand, Gary Barber, Roger Birnbaum. Tobey Maguire, Allison Thomas and Robin Bissell serve as executive producers.\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\nThis winner of four Academy Awards including Best Picture, stars Russell Crowe as a brilliant mathematician on the brink of international acclaim who becomes entangled in a mysterious conspiracy.\n\nView\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\n\"Road to Perdition\" is a portrayal of two families whose fates are determined by the complex and often combative relationships between fathers and their sons...and sons and their fathers.\n\nView\n\nWar Horse\n\nFrom director Steven Spielberg comes \"War Horse,\" an emotional epic on a classic scale. It is the story of a miraculous horse in wartime, a stirring journey that explores a bond of friendship, loyalty and courage.\n\nView"
