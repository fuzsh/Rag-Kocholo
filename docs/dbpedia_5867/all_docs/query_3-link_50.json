As a kid, some 40 years ago, I can remember playing with them: colored plastic bricks that snapped together. Since then, the Lego empire has expanded, venturing into arenas previ...\n\nMan on a Ledge\n\nOkay, so maybe after seeing Tom Cruise scale the tallest building in the world in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, 21 stories doesn't seem that high... but it's still a long way down. And I'd be willing to bet Sam Worthington didn't do all his...\n\nMeet Dave\n\nBack in the 1980s, it wasn't uncommon to hear Eddie Murphy referred to as a \"comic genius.\" 20 years later, the man who once made a concert film called Raw has become a purveyor of PG-rated pabulum. At one point, Murphy could deliver while collec...\n\nNext Three Days, The\n\nThe Next Three Days, Paul Haggis' adaptation of the 2008 French film, Anything for Her, uses an interesting concept as a cornerstone of the foundation. Instead of employing a seasoned professional as the lead character of this heist thriller, the ...\n\nOur Idiot Brother\n\nLately, comedies seem to come in two flavors: profane raunch-fests that seek to garner laughs via shock tactics and big-screen sit-coms. Despite Zooey Deschanel's repeated utterance of the word \"fuck\" and a dud of a threesome, Our Idiot Brother fal...\n\nPitch Perfect\n\nPitch Perfect looks, sounds, and feels like pretty much every other movie that features a singing or dancing competition. With all the effort invested in the musical numbers, the dramatic elements feel like warmed-over John Hughes. And it's not eve...\n\nPitch Perfect 2\n\nSpoiler Warning! Because I reveal things about the ending of Pitch Perfect 2 in this review, I am duty-bound to warn readers in case they wish to stop now. (Of course, if you don't care, feel free to continueâ€¦) I am as far from the targ...\n\nRole Models\n\nRole Models takes a familiar PG-rated plot and adds enough profanity and nudity to earn it a family unfriendly R. Sadly, an injection of raunchiness does not equate to an increase in quality and, while Role Models can boast the occasionally funny ...\n\nSeabiscuit\n\nSeabiscuit is the great hope of the adult movie-going audience: a summer motion picture that is not designed to appeal to teenage boys. Ordinarily, one might think it would be a risk on Universal's part to release the movie in late July, but the a...\n\nSkincare\n\nSkincare takes its inspiration from the real-life case of Dawn DaLuise, a West Hollywood aesthetician whose dubious business tactics, which may have included hiring a hitman to eliminate a rival, made headlines in the L.A. era back in the mid-2010..."
