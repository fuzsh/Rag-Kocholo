        "text": "I WAS sitting with my horse trainer outside her office at Santa Anita racetrack. It was 101 degrees, and we were waiting. It was still and quiet. Most of the other trainers had already moved their horses to Del Mar for the summer meet. Between her barn and the one next door, a groom was walking a sleek mahogany bay colt. They paused at the water bucket, and the colt took a drink, then turned his narrow, elegant blaze and his large, expressive eyes toward us. ''That's the big horse,'' said Alexis. ''That's their horse.''\n\n''AtswhatImtalknbout?''\n\n''Yeah.''\n\nHe strode on, deliberate in the heat, the racehorse the ''Seabiscuit'' movie people bought a piece of just before he ran in this year's Kentucky Derby. His head was splendid, his neck curved perfectly, his walk was sinuous, his tail flowed long and silky. He was the picture of thoroughbred class. He didn't have a part in the movie.\n\nWhat we were waiting for was the party to begin, the fundraising preview last month of ''Seabiscuit'' the movie, and soon enough, it did, at the restaurant the jockey George Woolf once owned, the Derby. The restaurant was jammed. A big black bus called the Presidential had brought one party up from Del Mar, and a 36-foot black Hummer limousine had brought in another group. It looked not so much like a vehicle; more like a building. The jockey Chris McCarron, neat as you please in a champagne-colored sportshirt and shorts, greeted us at the door and handed us our favor -- a poster of the movie and a box containing three model horses, Seabiscuit, War Admiral and Pumpkin, the Biscuit's faithful companion. The food was jockey food -- smoked salmon, fruit, no bread or crackers. The crowd was an owners crowd, which means moneyed, but horsey. The men looked vaguely Republican, with a tinge of Vegas -- very smooth creased slacks and bright sportshirts, highly pressed. The women were lean and weathered, no chemical peels in evidence. No one said anything about the movie. What was there to say? It had all been said for them in the racing press, which had been hyping the movie since the spring with ads, articles and come-ons. Even The Daily Racing Form had put out a special flyer. All the hype suddenly seemed a little beneath this crowd, who were, after all, plenty sophisticated and plenty experienced, with a natural demeanor hopeful and skeptical in equal measure.\n\nWe went to the movie in buses. Those of us who had paid bottom dollar ($150) sat below the screen and gaped upward, which might have given us a jaded, or at least a dizzied view of the picture. More generous ones (and racing people are wonderfully generous) got reserved seats in the upper tiers. We filled two theaters and were told by the trainer Jenine Sahadi that we had ponied up 50,000 simoleons for laid-up jockeys, exercise riders and equine research. I was impressed.\n\nIt took 20 minutes to get to a horse, but when it did, the audience sighed audibly and settled into their seats. It was a mature audience. We remembered that there had been a Great Depression perfectly well and even recognized the picture of F.D.R. that accompanied Professor McCullough's explanation of the New Deal. I began to wonder just whom this ''Seabiscuit'' was aimed at. For a while it seemed aimed at the Bush administration and tax-cut economics.\n\nThe audience was patient. We knew horses were coming, and they did, but it wasn't until the entrance of Gary Stevens, making his acting debut as the jockey George Woolf, that we whooped and hooted and clapped in delight. After the death of the son of the rich Buick dealer Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), the abandonment of the young jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) by his parents and the crash of the stock market, Gary Stevens's vibrant grace and energy livened things up quite a bit.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
