        "text": "I never saw this film when it came out, but I remember it was a blockbuster at the time. Now I know why. I loved it and give it five stars, even though the critics on the DVD case only give it four.\n\nSeabiscuit is a race horse of good pedigree, but is too small and a bit screwed up. The jockey is well educated, but is too large and has his own dysfunctions. These two are put together by a grieving businessman and a reclusive trainer. All are transformed for the better in the process and come out winners.\n\nA worthy underdog to root for that wins, huge crowds of precisely detailed period clothing, and the fact that this was a throughly researched true story carefully reenacted in elaborate cinematography, were all appealing aspects of this movie. But what I liked the best was the message that even if there are issues, there is no reason to give up.\n\nIf you, like me, have not yet had a chance to enjoy this inspiring movie about the triumph of the human spirit, I recommend you do."
