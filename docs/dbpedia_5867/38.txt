Pay homage to the movie - Seabiscuit with this hand-signed poster by the stars.

In the midst of the Great Depression, a businessman (Jeff Bridges) coping with the tragic death of his son, a jockey with a history of brutal injuries (Tobey Maguire) and a down-and-out horse trainer (Chris Cooper) team up to help Seabiscuit, a temperamental, undersized racehorse. At first the horse struggles to win, but eventually Seabiscuit becomes one of the most successful thoroughbreds of all time, and inspires a nation at a time when it needs it most.

Complete with a serialized certificate of authenticity and verifiable numbered hologram, this piece is a secure investment that will increase in value with age.
