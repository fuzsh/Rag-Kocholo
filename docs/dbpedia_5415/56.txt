Michael Nesmith is best known as the woolen hat-wearing member of iconic television pop band the Monkees, which enjoyed massive global success during the 1960s. Outside of the Monkees, Nesmith has gained kudos as a solo artist and songwriter, particularly with his group First National Band, which recorded three albums and are considered to be one of the pioneers of country rock. In other artistic pursuits, Nesmith created a video-clip for his song ”Rio" which helped spur the creation of a television program called PopClips. That program was eventually sold to the Time Warner/Amex consortium and soon after morphed into the MTV network. Nesmith won a Grammy in 1981 for his song "Elephant Parts” in the newly created category of Video of the Year. Clearly innovation was in Nesmith’s genes as his mother was the inventor of the typewriter correction fluid, Liquid Paper. Nesmith has produced several feature films, including 1984's Repo Man and is also an author and record producer. He continues to be involved occasionally in Monkees projects and tours with his solo material. Nesmith has long been associated with Gretsch guitars.
