        "text": "The former home of the late Michael Nesmith, a member of the iconic made-for-TV band, The Monkees, is up for grabs.\n\nNesmith, who died in 2021, lived in this three-bedroom, 3.5-bath home in Carmel Valley, CA, about 20 minutes from the coast. The house is listed for $3.5 million.\n\nThe ranch-style pad is spread over 3,365 square feet, all tucked into a gated community called Sleepy Hollow.\n\nThe dwelling sits on more than 6 acres, surrounded by majestic oaks and stunning vistas.\n\nThe living room features a vaulted, beamed ceiling with large windows and a brick fireplace. This main room includes a dining area with a lovely view of the pool and backyard. Smart storage is built in, offering space for dishes, linens, and to use as a sideboard.\n\nA three-seat breakfast bar looks into the kitchen, which is well appointed with stainless steel appliances and painted cabinets. A home office and family room with a second fireplace adjoins the cook space, and hardwood floors and skylights tie the layout together.\n\nThe primary suite is a private retreat with a large bathroom and walk-in closet. There’s a pool and cabana outside, as well as a one-bedroom guest cottage with an attached studio that would be ideal for an artist.\n\nAs an original member of The Monkees, Nesmith and his three bandmates soared to stardom in the late 1960s with such hits as “I’m a Believer,” “Daydream Believer,” and “Last Train to Clarksville.”\n\nNesmith, who was known as the “quiet Monkee,” was able to tour one last time with the band in the fall of 2021, just weeks before he died."
