        "text": "Michael Nesmith, singer and guitarist of The Monkees, died Friday from natural causes. He was 78.\n\n“With Infinite Love we announce that Michael Nesmith has passed away this morning in his home, surrounded by family, peacefully and of natural causes,” the family said in a statement. “We ask that you respect our privacy at this time and we thank you for the love and light that all of you have shown him and us.”\n\nIn 1965, Nesmith was cast in the television sitcom “The Monkees,” which ran for two seasons on NBC.\n\nThey had such chart hits as “I’m a Believer,” “‘Pleasant Valley Sunday” and “Daydream Believer.”\n\nNesmith wrote several songs for the band, including “The Girl I Knew Somewhere,” “Mary, Mary” and “Listen to the Band.”\n\nFollowing The Monkees, he formed the First National Band and recorded three country rock albums.\n\nBefore he gained fame with The Monkees, Nesmith wrote “Different Drum,” which became a hit for Linda Ronstadt.\n\nHe recently toured with fellow Monkee Micky Dolenz. Their other Monkees band mates, Davy Jones and Peter Tork, died in 2012 and 2019 respectively.\n\nDolenz tweeted, “I’m heartbroken. I’ve lost a dear friend and partner. I’m so grateful that we could spend the last couple of months together doing what we loved best – singing, laughing, and doing shtick. I’ll miss it all so much. Especially the shtick.”"
