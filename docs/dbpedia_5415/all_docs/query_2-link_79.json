        "text": "Before he was a Monkee, Mike Nesmith was what, in today’s terms would be called a singer-songwriter. Make that a struggling singer-songwriter. Landing a part on the iconic TV show made him a comedic pop star, and he was allowed to contribute original songs to Monkees albums from time to time. But it wasn’t till he quit the band in 1970, after a whirlwind four years, that the Texas native got back to his own thing: a lot more writing, releasing a series of country- and folk-flavored solo and band albums, producing some films, and even some sporadic touring.\n\nBut Nesmith hasn’t played in these parts since a 1992 appearance at Nightstage in Cambridge. He returns, with a four-piece band, to the Somerville Theatre on April 13, with original material from throughout his career, including a re-imagined version of one Monkees tune, \"Papa Jean’s Blues.\"\n\nNesmith, 70, answered questions, via email, in a late-night interview from Boulder, Colo.\n\nYou hadn’t been playing music for very long when you got the Monkees gig. What were you doing musically before that?\n\nI got a guitar as a Christmas present when I was 19, just about to turn 20. I asked for it because I had been to a concert of folk music and wanted to learn to play that. I started playing old folk songs as best I could, but I wasn’t a musician, so I couldn’t figure out the chords to very many or how to play them. So I started writing. [\"Papa Jean’s Blues\" and \"Different Drum\" were among the first.] I was surprised when other people heard my songs and asked me to play them again, or even better, asked me to teach it to them.\n\nLinda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys had a hit with \"Different Drum\" in 1967. How did the song get to them?\n\nJohn Herald was a member of the Greenbriar Boys, an East Coast bluegrass band. He paid me a visit, and we sat around playing old time mountain songs we both knew. Then I played him \"Different Drum.\" He really liked it, and recorded it on the Greenbriar Boys’ next album. I was told that is where Linda heard it, although she never told me that directly.\n\nWill you be doing much material from your solo albums or First National Band albums on the current tour?\n\nI do an arrangement of \"Tomorrow & Me\" [the first track] from \"And the Hits Just Keep on Comin’,\" and there are several from the FNB albums in the concert.\n\nHow did you go about putting together the players in this band?\n\nWe have all worked together over the years, specifically Paul Leim (drums) and Joe Chemay (bass). They played on \"Infinite Rider on the Big Dogma,\" and on many musical projects with me since then. Boh Cooper (keyboards) is a friend of theirs, and when I told them what I was up to for this tour they said he would fit right in. Chris Scruggs (mandolin, steel, six-string) is a well-known multi-instrumentalist around Nashville. Chris is what I know as a \"utility man,\" meaning he plays a lot of different stringed instruments very well, so he can add all kinds of color to a live performance.\n\nYou’re always writing songs, but you’re not playing any new material on the tour. What does a song go through before you do it live?\n\nOnce a song is complete and the first recording is made, I put it up on the Videoranch.com website. Then I tweak and repair and nudge and add to the recording over time, and put each new iteration on the site, as well. I think this may be the best way for a song to mature and for an audience to engage in the process. They get to see the maturation and growth that way.\n\nDo you have any music that’s ready for release as a new album?\n\nAs I get several more new songs recorded I think I will probably sweep them together in some kind of bouquet, and find a way to bring that out on a CD or some other medium. I just don’t know what that medium is or will be. Instead of waiting to find out, I am recording and putting records on the site so people can download them now.\n\nYou used to play a beautiful Gretsch 12-string guitar, a model that only you, George Harrison and Chet Atkins had. Do you still play that?\n\nI don’t have the original. That was stolen. But Gretsch made me a replica that I play on the Monkees shows. For the solo shows I am playing a Martin J-40 12-string, and I am trying out a Yamaha L16 12-string.\n\nYou haven’t played the Boston area for many years, but there was a rumor that Boston was responsible for saving the 1984 movie \"Repo Man,\" which you executive produced.\n\nVery true. I believe it was the Nickelodeon in Boston. That theater got hold of a copy of the movie and played it for a year. The studio wasn’t going to release it, and in fact never did give it much of a shot. If it wasn’t for that lone theater, \"Repo Man\" would have been a footnote to its times. As it turned out, the movie was seminal, and spawned a great strain of moviemaking and moviemakers.\n\nMichael Nesmith\n\nWHEN: Saturday, April 13, 8 p.m.\n\nWHERE: Somerville Theatre, 55 Davis Square\n\nTICKETS: $34-$49"
