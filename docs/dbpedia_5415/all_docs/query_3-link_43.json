I was\n\n7th row center and could see the obvious excitement you had as you took the\n\nstage last night. For 3 hours, you guys knocked yourselves out and we\n\ncertainly appreciated your efforts.\n\nA few thoughts about the show:\n\nIt seemed that you were throwing many special performances at us in an effort\n\nto find out what worked and what didn‚Äôt. I applaud your efforts, however, in\n\nrelation to the last tour, it seemed to me that the ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù set in the\n\nmiddle of your show was out of place with an audience that came to see\n\n‚ÄúThe Monkees!‚Äù Although their efforts were also appreciated, and they\n\ncertainly are talented ‚Äúboys‚Äù, the show would have been better served without\n\nthem. And, sorry to say, but ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù should not have been on stage near\n\nthe end of the show. Although you do not need a warm-up act, if necessary,\n\nput them at the beginning, before you start. In the middle of the show puts\n\nthem in a difficult situation where the audience feels they‚Äôve ‚Äúescaped‚Äù the\n\ndreaded opening act.\n\nThe previous tour seemed to be more to the point, concentrating on ‚ÄúThe\n\nBest of The Monkees‚Äù. Although my wife and I enjoyed last nights show, and\n\ncertainly hope it will not be our last time to see ‚ÄúOur Monkees‚Äù, we liked\n\nthe previous tour show much better and hope you‚Äôll return to a show more like\n\nthat.\n\nThanks a ton,\n\nJonathan Apple\n\nSyndicated Oldies Radio Show Host\n\nOldies Coast-to-Coast(tm)\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFrom: Judy Larson\n\nLast Nights Concert!

We really enjoyed our selves and\n\nit brought back a lot of good memories. I keep singing your songs over in\n\nover in my head. I will have to pull out the big records and play them\n\nagain.

Judy Larson\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFrom: ‚ÄúRay Nelson‚Äù\n\nJust seen the group at the House of Blues in Orlando last night, the place\n\nwas packed. They were very funny and put on a very good show. The natural,\n\n‚Äúboy band‚Äù, had a spot, and were shoved down our throat, in the middle of\n\nthe show. Just a handful of classic songs (TV show songs) were missing from\n\nthe show, ‚ÄúShe, No Time, Cuddly Toy, Star Collector, and Words‚Äù. They\n\nperformed everything else. The group also had a solo spot in which each\n\nmember did a non-Monkee song. Mickey did a blues song and also Purple Haze,\n\nDavy a vaudeville song, Peter a classic rock song. A bunch of Mike Nesmith\n\nsongs were also performed. They also pointed out that he was not present to\n\nperform them. I was surprised at how many teenage kids were at the show,\n\nand knew the words to all the classic songs, a lot of singing along was\n\ngoing on.The show was very good as my wife, who is not a big Monkee fan,\n\nlaughed her butt off and said she would go see them again. Peter is a very\n\nimpressive musician. Looking forward to Davy at Epcot!\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFrom: Jenny\n\n(This is the grand prize winner of the Monkees.Net T-Shirt contest with the\n\n8-Button Shirt design)\n\nBrad,\n\nWe just got back from the concert in Clearwater and it was SOOOOOO GREAT!!!!!\n\nand thank you so much for picking my design for the t-shirt cause that got us\n\nback stage and we got to meet Davy and Micky!!!!

It was great!!\n\nhttp://www.sptimes.com/News/030301/Artsandentertainment/Just_plain_Monkee_bus.shtml\n\nJust plain Monkee business\n\nBy GINA VIVINETTO\n\nc St. Petersburg Times, published March 3, 2001\n\nCLEARWATER ‚Äî Watching the Monkees perform in 2001 isn‚Äôt the flashback\n\nto yesteryear you might imagine. Sure, the beloved made-for-TV pop act of\n\nthe 1960s serve up familiar pop hits such as I‚Äôm a Believer and Pleasant\n\nValley Sunday, and the same shenanigans that endeared them to a generation\n\n‚Äî and, in reruns, to that generation‚Äôs kids.\n\nBut the Monkees‚Äô three remaining original members have evolved over the\n\ndecades, and they aren‚Äôt ashamed to show it. That doesn‚Äôt simply mean\n\nMickey Dolenz‚Äôs hairline has crept back; it means Dolenz, 55, and band\n\nmates Davy Jones, 55, and Peter Tork, 57, are comfortable enough to let a\n\nbit of their ‚Äúreal‚Äù selves shine through. (Fourth member Mike Nesmith, now\n\na multimillionaire, has since removed the fuzzy winter cap, refusing to\n\nparticipate in any Monkee business.)\n\nThe Monkees was a precursor to today‚Äôs chart topping teen pop acts. The\n\nPre-Fab Four, as they were dubbed, are getting a lot of attention recently\n\nas pop‚Äôs Original Boy Band. The show was also the first to feature the\n\nwacky foibles of communal living (see MTV‚Äôs The Real World).\n\nThe Monkees showcased four characters who used their real names. What\n\nyou find, more than 30 years later, is that these four were, largely,\n\nplaying themselves.\n\nThursday at Ruth Eckerd Hall, in the first show of the 2001 Reunion\n\nTour, fans learned that Dolenz is still a wisecracker, Jones a charmer, and\n\nTork, the sweetly vulnerable one, is the same, just not as stupid as his\n\nonscreen persona.\n\nAll three, certainly, are unabashed hams.\n\nThe Monkees walked onstage, kicking their legs out to each side in that\n\nfamous Monkee walk, before launching into Last Train to Clarksville. Tork,\n\nwho got his start on the Greenwich Village folk scene, deftly played\n\nguitar, tickled the keyboards and reminded fans it was he, not alt-rocker\n\nBeck, who was the first rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roller to pluck a banjo.\n\nDolenz, too, strummed guitar, sang and hopped behind the drum kit to\n\nbash out, and sing, the funky Mary, Mary.\n\nThe Monkees were backed by a stellar eight-member band, including a\n\nhorn section. Dolenz reminded us with a powerful Randy Scouse Git that he\n\ndid have a hand in songwriting. That original protest tune found Dolenz,\n\ncenter stage, banging mallets on a large drum as he sang.\n\nTork, too, sang originals, such as the quirky Your Auntie Grizelda.\n\nEven Jones performed several self-penned tunes.\n\nThese guys can play. But, now that they don‚Äôt have to prove it, the Monkees\n\nare free to do what they do best, to entertain. They are blessed; they can\n\ndo that, still, by just being themselves.\n\n‚Äì Gina Vivinetto can be reached by e-mail at href=mailto:gina@s‚Ä¶>gina@s‚Ä¶.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFrom: ‚ÄúCaroline‚Äù\n\nArticle in St. Pete Times\n\nhttp://www.sptimes.com/News/030101/Artsandentertainment/Time_stops_when_you_r.shtml\n\nThis was in the St. Petersburg Times Thursday:\n\nCopyright Times Publishing Co. Mar 1, 2001\n\nBuilding 7566 looks like all the rest of the buildings in the maze that‚Äôs\n\nthe Offices at Southland. The signs say lawyers and e- companies rent space\n\nhere. If they can find their way in.\n\nYou open the door and there they are. Not more than 20 feet away. The\n\nMonkees. Two of them, anyway, rehearsing with their nine-member band.\n\nDavy Jones is wearing wire rim glasses and clowning with one of the crew.\n\nMickey Dolenz, who looks like he‚Äôs morphing into Jack Nicholson, strums an\n\nacoustic guitar, his eyes closed.\n\nYou start to smile, but hold it in. This is business: You‚Äôre here to find\n\nout what‚Äôs up with these guys on the eve of a national tour that starts\n\ntonight in Clearwater. Besides, you were never a huge fan of their catchy\n\nlittle ditties. That was for the girls.\n\nBut then the keyboard player hits the opening notes of Daydream Believer,\n\nand Jones and Dolenz step to the front.\n\nOh, I could hide ‚Äòneath the wings. Of the bluebird as she sings.\n\nThe six o‚Äôclock alarm would never ring.\n\nYou weren‚Äôt going to succumb.\n\nBut you do.\n\nThe band, especially the horn section, sounds terrific. Jones‚Äô voice doesn‚Äôt\n\nhave its old strength, but he doesn‚Äôt sound that much different. Hey, he‚Äôs\n\n55. Give him a break. At least a senior‚Äôs discount.\n\nAs the rehearsal moves along, Dolenz sits on a stool in front of the band,\n\ncloses his eyes again and listens for mistakes. Half an hour later, Peter\n\nTork arrives. He hugs everyone, then trades his coffee for an electric\n\nguitar.\n\nThey play A Little Bit Me and Cuddly Toy. Solid and tight. Everyone is\n\nhappy.\n\nOf the four Monkees, (Mike Nesmith isn‚Äôt joining the tour), Jones has\n\nchanged the least. His hair is long and (mostly) dark, and he‚Äôs still got\n\nthat old excitement about touring. Sort of.\n\n‚ÄúThe road is a killer,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why Mike doesn‚Äôt do it. You try to\n\nstay in shape, but when you‚Äôre on the road, it‚Äôs hard not to eat the other\n\nhalf of the sandwich.‚Äù\n\nHe‚Äôs been divorced twice and recently broke up with his girlfriend, a\n\n29-year-old actor who lives in Hollywood. Why?\n\nHe extends his arms in the tiny room where he‚Äôs being interviewed. ‚ÄúThis,‚Äù\n\nhe says. ‚ÄúThe road.‚Äù\n\nHe stops and smiles. Don‚Äôt misunderstand, he says. The Monkees enjoy\n\ntouring. And the money. They were paid $450 a week for The Monkees TV show,\n\nand they each receive royalties of less than $15,000 a year.\n\n‚ÄúI get letters from 14-year-old girls in Brazil who see the TV show and\n\nthink I‚Äôm young,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúRemember, I have daughters 12, 19, 29 and 32.‚Äù\n\nWhen he‚Äôs not touring, Jones tends to his horses and lives in a mobile home\n\nnear Stuart. He also owns a home near Harrisburg, Pa. Without prompting, he\n\nrecounts how he was up for the role of Newkirk on Hogan‚Äôs Heroes and Robin\n\non Batman when he got the chance to join the Monkees. ‚ÄúIt was rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll\n\nand birds,‚Äù he says, grinning. ‚ÄúThat appealed to me.‚Äù\n\nNow, in a sense, he‚Äôs caught in a tender trap. ‚ÄúThe public won‚Äôt let the\n\nMonkees go. The companies won‚Äôt let it go. It‚Äôs like the Mafia. Once you‚Äôre\n\nin, you can never get out.‚Äù\n\nHe wishes the Monkees could have at least evolved; be more than what they\n\nare.\n\nDolenz and Tork wander in. Just you and . . . the Monkees.\n\nBefore he leaves to pick up letters from his daughters, Jones lets you know\n\nit‚Äôs not so bad being famous for being in a band that recorded mostly other\n\npeople‚Äôs music and dissolved after only four years. He tells about a time in\n\n1985 when the only work he could get was playing Jesus in a production of\n\nGodspell.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the cross singing, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm dying . . . I‚Äôm dying.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúAnd some guy in the audience yells out, ‚ÄòGive us Daydream Believer before\n\nyou go!‚Äô ‚Äú\n\nCara\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFrom: ‚ÄúDavy Jones Forever‚Äù\n\nDavid‚Äôs Museum-PICTURES AVAILABLE!\n\nHey everyone, I just got an E-Mail from our friendly Beavertown\n\nphotographer and this time there was pictures of the museum in there!

They came out @ 8:10 and played\n\nfor an hr. and a half. There was a 15 min. intermission, then ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù, a\n\nnew boy band that‚Äôs much more talented than N‚ÄôSync or any of those other ones\n\nperformed 4 songs. Then Peter, Davy, and Micky returned for another hour of\n\nmusic, jokes, and dancing! Hot DAMN it was such a GOOD SHOW! Mar.2 my hubby\n\nand I went to House of Blues in Orlando for the next one. We got there early,\n\nsince it was standing room only, and managed to squeeze a mere 8 ft. from the\n\nstage. Once again it was a fabulous show, and this time we got to dance! Even\n\nif you only like a few songs, go and see them if they come to your town. I‚Äôve\n\nnever been to a better concert, seen so much energy radiate from guys nearing\n\n55+ yrs. old. And they sound GREAT! Micky‚Äôs voice sends chills. Davy never\n\nstops moving, and Peter is a major surprise and delight, playing 4 different\n\ninstruments for the songs. OH, and lest I forget, the backup band was FAB!\n\nAlmost every song sounded just like the LP version!

At one point while we\n\nwere in the ladies room she was saying how she wished she could just tell\n\nDavy that she had Monkee videos at home‚Äìthe attendant in the bathroom was so\n\ntouched by my daughter that she actually took all of us back stage after the\n\nshow. My daughter (and I, living vicariously) got to meet all three guys,\n\nand they each signed her shirt. They made a memory for her that will last\n\nforever. Oh, yeah, the concert was outstanding, the band was tight and the\n\nvocals sounded awsome. Hope this wasn‚Äôt the last time we get to see them.\n\nMelinda\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFrom: ‚ÄúColleen Koskinen‚Äù\n\nThe March 3rd Monkees concert at The Pompano Beach Amphitheatre was\n\noutstanding! There was a big difference between this concert and those I\n\nhave seen in years past, the guys seemed really happy and comfortable. Peter\n\nplayed some songs that made him happy, namely ones that he wrote from Head\n\nand his traditional Lucille and Your Love Keeps Lifting Me Higher. Mickey\n\ndid his jazz nightclub performance, his Hendrix performance, and a really\n\ngreat rendition of Randy Scouse Git. Davy did his dreamy-eyed fan club\n\nstandards, a great number from Oliver, and a classic from the vaults of his\n\nvery own mom‚Äôs record collection. You could tell that they were really\n\nhaving a good time, and because of that the fans were having a great time.\n\nAdvice to Monkees Fans: DO NOT MISS THIS TOUR.\n\nAs a long time fan I especially liked the set list heavily laced with groovy\n\nHead, AND Nesmith tunes. I was in heaven when they got out three bar stools,\n\ndismissed the back up band and just played really good classic Monkees\n\ntunes. It was beautiful. Every song they sang like that seemed to come\n\ndirectly from the heart like a lullaby to their fans.\n\nDavy looked ten times better than the ‚Äô97 tour. Peter is to die for (maybe\n\nthat kiss he gave me before he got on the bus made me biased) he just looks\n\nbetter every year. Mickey.well he has a tremendous voice, and is just an\n\nall-around fun guy.\n\nThe crowd was your typical Monkees concert: atypical. Screaming teens,\n\ndancing 20‚Äôs, toe-tapping 30‚Äôs, funky 40‚Äôs, wistful 50‚Äôs, nostalgic 60‚Äôs. We\n\nwere all represented. The bathroom line was like a time warp, all of us\n\nexchanging trivia from decades past, few of us with firsthand knowledge.\n\nFor those of you wondering how ‚Äúboy band‚Äù Natural fit in, well besides the\n\nMickey quip about how Natural members play their own music (I think they\n\ndid), I missed most of it. It was a great time to get snacks, buy a t-shirt,\n\nwait in a shorter bathroom line.it made for a really great intermission\n\nThis is the kind of show that makes the years of waiting in between tours\n\nworthwhile. Davy, Peter and Mickey keep it up!\n\n-Colleen Koskinen\n\nTo purchase Monkees CD‚Äôs, Videos and Collectable rare items, visit\n\nwww.monkees.net\n\nThe Monkees Alert list is moderated, meaning you cannot post directly to\n\nthe list yourself.

In the early `90s, when the rest of\n\nhis back catalogue was being issued on CD, Nez refused to allow the disc to\n\nbe included in overhaul ‚Äì citing dissatisfaction with the performance. Due\n\nto the demand of enthusiasts worldwide, consent was granted to not only\n\nreissue the disc, but also to compliment the package with nearly a\n\nhalf-hour of additional music. The material covered here is primarily\n\nderived from the half-dozen albums Nez did on RCA Records in the early `70s\n\n‚Äì the singular exception being ‚ÄúCapsule‚Äù from the cryptically titled\n\nInfinite Rider On The Big Dogma long player. A majority of the tracks are\n\nrefugees from one of Nesmith‚Äôs most fertile creative periods in the late\n\n`60s, just prior to leaving the Monkees. ‚ÄúCalico Girlfriend‚Äù,\n\n‚ÄúPropinquity‚Äù, ‚ÄúSome Of Shelly‚Äôs Blues‚Äù, ‚ÄúCrippled Lion‚Äù and ‚ÄúListen to the\n\nBand‚Äù ‚Äì are all tunes Nesmith recorded as both a Monkee and solo artist. On\n\nLive At The Palais, Nesmith‚Äôs folk-tinged originals are replaced by\n\nelectric and decidedly more emotive renderings. While much of the folksy\n\nspirit remains, songs such as ‚ÄúCalico Girlfriend‚Äù and ‚ÄúSome Of Shelly‚Äôs\n\nBlues‚Äù have matured ‚Äì featuring the essence of the Southwest Americana that\n\nNesmith‚Äôs music so aptly depicts. The bonus material is as strong as ‚Äì if\n\nnot arguably more potent than ‚Äì the Palais performance. From a 1981 show at\n\nthe Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, Texas comes another, albeit\n\nheavier, version of ‚ÄúGrand Ennui‚Äù as well as the only live version of the\n\npreviously mentioned ‚ÄúCapsule‚Äù. The other pair of bonus tracks is from a\n\nconcert sponsored by Gretsch Guitars in 1995. Incidentally, Nesmith owned\n\none of only three electric 12-string Gretsch guitars manufactured in the\n\nmid to late `60s. His affinity is obvious and translates into some\n\noutstanding music ranging from the tender ‚ÄúCrippled Lion‚Äù to the raucous\n\n‚ÄúListen To The Band.‚Äù Live At The Palais is only available through\n\nNesmith‚Äôs on-line mail order http://www.videoranch.com/ site. ‚Äì Lindsay Planer\n\n1.

This two-disc set is basically the\n\naudio track of that programme. The sound is opulent; accurately recreating\n\nthe organic acoustics on opening night of the 30th anniversary Peter Britt\n\nFestival in Jackson, Oregon. Nesmith states in his liner notes he feels\n\n‚Äúever fortunate that [he] had the good sense to record this show.‚Äù That is\n\nan understatement. Like others stops on the brief . tropical campfires .\n\ntour, this performance offers a stellar sampling of material from every\n\nphase of Nesmith‚Äôs diverse musical career ‚Äì including his first Monkees\n\nside ‚ÄúPapa Gene‚Äôs Blues‚Äù. However the vast majority of the show spotlights\n\nhis post-Monkee solo career. The timeless nature of Nesmith‚Äôs compositions\n\nhas served them well. Songs such as ‚ÄúPropinquity‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Upside Of Goodbye‚Äù\n\nand the lilting ‚ÄúTwo Different Roads‚Äù take on a matured persona ‚Äì with the\n\nfolk wisdom that only comes from experience. The . tropical campfires .\n\ntracks have a tremendous intimacy about them that is only achieved by the\n\nright group of musicians performing the right music for the right crowd.\n\nThis is certainly the right group of musicians. Desert Rose Band string-man\n\nJohn Jorgensen and percussionist Luis Conte are brilliant and their\n\nindividual talents are underscored on tracks such as ‚ÄúLaugh Kills Lonesome‚Äù\n\nand ‚ÄúSilver Moon‚Äù ‚Äì the latter being one of many highlights. Live At The\n\nBritt Festival is highly recommended for the avid enthusiast and curious\n\nalike. ‚Äì Lindsay Planer\n\n1. Two Different Roads (Nesmith) ‚Äì 3:49\n\n2.
