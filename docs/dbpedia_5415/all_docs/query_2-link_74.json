        "text": "Robert Michael Nesmith slipped the surly bonds of Earth on Friday, 10 December 2021, and joined his Monkee brothers Davy and Peter in the great beyond. Everyone in the fan community is in shock. Though Nez was 78, would’ve turned 79 on 30 December, and had been suffering with heart problems, no one expected to see that news. He hadn’t been publicly sick for a long time, and he and Micky just completed their final farewell tour.\n\nThough Davy has been my favorite Monkee since I fell in love with the band during the 1986 revival, I strongly suspect Nez might’ve been my fave rave had I discovered them as an older teen or adult. Once I moved past the childish idea of choosing a favorite bandmember based on how cute he was, I began gravitating towards the deep, serious, sensitive, complex ones.\n\nMy love, respect, and admiration for Nez have grown so much since I became an adult. At first I was really surprised to discover how popular he was among the other ladies I met on my estrogen Who lists (many of whom were also second-generation Monkeemaniacs). As a child, I thought of him as the boring, serious, adult one, not as fun as the other three. My negative opinion wasn’t helped by how my mother explained his absence on the 1986 tour, that he had a job he considered more important than The Monkees.\n\nNow I realize he was the only one with a wide-ranging, diverse career outside of The Monkees, like pioneering the country rock genre, writing songs for other artists, being a music producer under his own record label, forming the Pacific Arts Corporation, helping to create MTV, working as a film executive producer, and so much more. Obviously, the other three had working lives outside of The Monkees too, but their notoriety is tied much more strongly to the band.\n\nThough Nez didn’t always have the greatest interest in participating in reunion tours and albums, since he wanted to be remembered as more than just a Monkee and do other things with his life, he did eventually make peace with that part of his legacy and came to be proud of it. Doing that final tour pushed him to stay alive and make the fans happy, after so many years of seeing The Monkees as an inevitable, inescapable duty.\n\nAt last, he saw things from the perspective of the lifelong fans in the audience, many of them second- and even third-generation. Nez understood how beloved the band is, and that they’ve long since gained mass artistic and critical respect (even if that élitist ass Jann Wenner is still keeping The Monkees out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame). Not only that, he also genuinely grew to love their music himself. The fans’ love and joy reflected back on him so powerfully.\n\nNez was the one who fought first and hardest for The Monkees to revolt against their handlers and start writing and playing on the majority of their own material. Probably all serious fans are familiar with the story of how he punched a hole through the wall when he told Screen Gems lawyer Herb Moelis he’d quit if he didn’t get more of a say in the band’s music, and Mr. Moelis told him in a very condescending way to read his contract. Nez screamed that that could’ve been his face.\n\nMany of my favorite Monkees’ songs are now Mike’s, like “Writing Wrongs,” “You Told Me,” “Sweet Young Thing,” “You Just May Be the One,” “The Door into Summer,” “Love Is Only Sleeping,” “Tapioca Tundra,” “Listen to the Band,” and “Me and Magdalena.”\n\nMay you rest in peace, dearest Mike, and may your beautiful memory be for an eternal blessing. Another part of my childhood is gone forever, but I’ll love, respect, and admire you forever. It was a great honor and privilege to share Planet Earth with you for just shy of 42 years."
