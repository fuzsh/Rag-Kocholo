        "text": "There are some debts in life that can‚Äôt be repaid. I have a few, and I suspect you do too. They‚Äôre just so big, so random, from a source so distant, or so imbued with Grace that you just have to say thank you and then pay them forward as best you can.\n\nThis website, and my later association with the Zilch podcast, was an attempt to pay forward a debt indirectly, because of course I would never have the chance to pay it back directly. But my life since May 12, 2012 has been nothing if not synchronistic to the point of downright fucking bizarre, often in ways that somehow involve the Monkees. Hell, I‚Äôm now fairly convinced that spraining 1 ¬Ω ankles after Micky and Mark Lindsay‚Äôs show the weekend after interviewing for my soon-to-be new gig in Philly was a warning from the universe that I was trying to control too much, too fast, too anxiously, and too perfectly. (Alas, I didn‚Äôt actually *grok* that particular clue-by-four till many months later‚Ä¶). In that grand tradition of Monkees Synchronicity, when the PTFB team was preparing for Peter‚Äôs Celebration of Life, it turned out that the Shoe Suede Blues show that the team could get its hands on both audio and video for was‚Ä¶Bay City. At this point I wasn‚Äôt even surprised, because of course it was. I was happy to provide the audio, and Sherri had managed to find the video. Kevin Marhanka married the two files, and I was asked to provide an introduction. Most of what happened at Club 66 was covered in Zilch episode 146, but this bit is more appropriate here, in Fandom Lenses, where it all started. Here‚Äôs how I introduced the Bay City Show, standing center stage at Club 66 where I had seen Peter for the third to last time. As I said to our emcee John, no pressure. üòâ\n\nI‚Äôm pretty sure this is an urban legend, but I once read something to the effect that every cell in your body is replaced every seven years, which means that every seven years, you are a completely different person. As I said, I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true, but in any case, I am not the same person I was 7 years ago, in large part because of the events of September 8, 2012 in Bay City, Michigan.\n\nOnce upon a time in the late 90s, in a Yahoogroup called Long_Title, some geeky, lost monkees fans found each other, became best friends, and called their little gang the Frodis Femmes. There was Cin, who‚Äôs here today, Mich and Mattie, who are back home in Cleveland, Ohio, me, and the bubbliest and most outgoing of us all, Anissa. Cin once called her our Davy, and she died suddenly in May 2012, a few months after Davy Jones.\n\nAnissa was a huge Shoe Suede Blues fan since the early 2000s, way before it was cool. She went to shows in California and Ohio, spread the word to all and sundry, and even had a Shoe Suede Blues license plate! There‚Äôs a reason I often say I‚Äôm just substitute co-hosting Zilch in her place. Because if Anissa had still been here when Zilch started‚Äîwell, imagine Christine the Button Queen with a healthy dash of Pinkie Pie from My Little Pony. üòâ\n\nBut back to Bay City, and the show we were all going to in Anissa‚Äôs memory. That day was‚Ä¶weird. The weirdness started at the hotel breakfast buffet, when I looked up from my omelet and saw none other than Peter Tork walking in in a rumpled tee shirt and some serious bed head. I mean, intellectually I knew he was just a normal guy, but there‚Äôs nothing like seeing one of your crushes when you were 10 grab some granola and a coffee to bring that point home.\n\nThe weirdness continued at the show, when he played a song in Anissa‚Äôs memory. He didn‚Äôt have to do that, just like he certainly didn‚Äôt have to post an RIP message to facebook the day after she died, acknowledging her loss and giving us comfort. But he did. So yeah, Peter was the normal guy at the breakfast buffet, but he was also kind to his fans‚Äîoften far kinder than we deserved. I think a lot of us know that, whether or not we‚Äôre brave enough to admit it.\n\nAnd speaking of kindness to fans, I think of the meet and greet after the show, in this tiny little record store that was filled way beyond capacity with fans wanting a photo and a signature. [Sherri interjected at this point to note that the line had stretched all the way around the block at its peak]. My long suffering husband Kevin was overwhelmed by the crowd. I was overwhelmed by the crowd. That night I truly wondered how one could do that job for one hour, let alone 5 decades, without running screaming into the night. Peter was visibly tired, and I learned later his knee was in pain. But he stayed at that overstuffed, overheated, overstimulated record store until every CD was signed and every photo snapped.\n\nBut the most remarkable thing about that night in Bay City took some time to sink in. Shoe Suede Blues had helped me start healing from Anissa‚Äôs death, just as in my tween years, when the Monkees helped me start healing from learning some life lessons way younger than I would have liked. And I wanted to pay that healing forward, through sharing kindness in that same humanly heroic way I had seen Peter connect with us in Bay City. I am a better writer because of Peter Tork. I‚Äôm a better leader and definitely a better podcaster. But most importantly I‚Äôm a better person because Peter taught me by his example that you don‚Äôt have to be perfect to help build a better world. You just have to be kind to yourself and everyone you meet.\n\nSo, enjoy the concert. I hope it helps you heal as much as it did me.\n\nThe next day, I opened the gift bag that a member of the PTFB team had slipped me in a quiet moment before the celebration started. In addition to a tree ornament and some other goodies, I found this bracelet, with this explanatory note.\n\nThat bracelet has been on my wrist ever since, and will remain there for the foreseeable future. Because it will remind me that there is only one way to pay off karmic debts like the one that inspired this blog, and it‚Äôs decidedly not living a lifetime of anxious striving to be ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to ‚Äúearn your miracles‚Äù. The only way to balance the scales is to be as kind to yourself and others as you can be in the present moment. Sometimes being kind is lending a helping hand, sometimes it‚Äôs honestly sharing a painful but necessary truth to help someone heal and grow. Sometimes it‚Äôs putting another‚Äôs needs above yours, and sometimes it‚Äôs making sure you put on your own oxygen mask before helping others. Sometimes you need to pitch in to help, and sometimes you need to step back so others can shine. You‚Äôll never be perfect at it, but the most perfectly imperfect way you can pull off the paradox of true kindness is by paying attention to every moment as it happens, as best you can. Because Now is all we have. Now is all we ever have. And Now I can see that the journey of the past 7 years has been a journey to grok what it means to live that truth with my family, my friends, my work, and especially within my own tough, tender self. Some people get sports cars and fall in love with a hot young thing at midlife. Me, I got a PhD, fell back in love with a septuagenarian boy band, and wrote a blog about it all. I hope you didn‚Äôt mind all the oversharing along the way.\n\nThis post feels like an ending too, but in a good, poignant way. Kind of like driving home from Edgewood with a tummy full of just enough barbecue, chatting with Cin and Debby about the joys and struggles of our lives, debating how to best share what happened with those who weren‚Äôt there, and just enjoying the moment. But even if Fandom Lenses is done (and we‚Äôll see if it really is, some people taught me long ago never to say never üòâ ), I will remain a part of Zilch for as long as I can participate in a manner that‚Äôs kind to me, to my fellow co-hosts, and to all of you who like to take us along as you live your daily lives.\n\nThis spiral won‚Äôt ever totally end, but when I stood on that stage in that club in Edgewood, Maryland, I think I might have graciously, miraculously been given an utterly unexpected opportunity to repay the debt to Peter that inspired this cycle of growth. Or maybe there was never any debt to repay in the first place.\n\nEither way, thanks.\n\nPrologue: Philadelphia Museum of Art, about 4 hours before soundcheck.\n\nCin and I stood near Vincent Van Gogh‚Äôs Sunflowers, trying to listen to the museum guide over the chattier members of the tour group. I‚Äôve become mildly hooked on visiting the museum since moving here (if you make it past the ‚ÄúRocky Steps‚Äù you‚Äôll find a truly world-class collection), so this wasn‚Äôt my first or even third time looking at one of the museum‚Äôs crown jewels. I was just about to pull out my phone to make sure we were still going to have time to grab lunch before heading back home to get ready for sound check, when the guide‚Äôs spiel caught my ear.\n\n‚ÄúNotice the two wilted flowers in the arrangement. Van Gogh included these in each version of his Sunflowers paintings as a Memento Mori, or reminder to the viewer that all things in time must die. This version of Sunflowers was painted in Arles in 1889, and‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nAnd the tour guide‚Äôs voice faded out. I looked at the two wilting flowers, but I didn‚Äôt see them. Instead I saw Nez, eagerly but gingerly climbing on stage at the Colonial Theatre, about 3 months after joining the Zipper Club. I saw a photo of Peter that was released after his death, taken the day he recorded Angels we Have Heard On High for Christmas Party. The wattage of his smile kept me from weeping at the frailty of his body‚Äîif only barely. After his death I‚Äôd remembered that he‚Äôd seemed a little thinner than usual when I met him backstage that final time I saw him in St Louis in 2016, but after he spent two hours running around a stage like he was 23, I simply chalked it up to nearing the end of a 7 month tour.\n\nMemento Mori.\n\nI‚Äôve never had trouble with that concept. The thing I had to learn was Memento Vivere, and The Monkees were 4 of my first and most important teachers in living fearlessly and joyously in the face of death, from 1986 to now. But tonight would be the first time I would see them since Peter‚Äôs death, at the very venue where Nez had to end last year‚Äôs tour in favor of a quadruple bypass.\n\nMemento Mori.\n\nWhat would tonight be like?\n\nSoundcheck\n\n(note: while I list all songs played during soundcheck and the show proper, I don‚Äôt discuss all of them. that‚Äôs how I kept this under 3000 words. üòâ\n\nIf you ever have a chance to do VIP soundcheck for the Monkees (or any other band you love), do it. To be clear, I‚Äôm quite sure there‚Äôs a difference between a real soundcheck and VIP soundcheck (We heard Nez singing from the Keswick lobby a solid half hour before they opened the doors to let us in, which was both cool and damn reassuring for the obvious reason üòä). However, it was still neat to walk in to see Micky and Nez in a more relaxed and casual mode (Nez was in sweatpants cracking Kim Jong Un Jokes! Micky‚Äôs monitor earpiece just plays CNN!), and listen to their banter, watch the band go through its paces, and play a half-dozen songs, some we‚Äôd hear again later that night, and some that weren‚Äôt in the setlist. I‚Äôve embedded a few videos Cin shot, but a few moments stand out from the soundcheck.\n\nThe Girl I Knew Somewhere\n\nOne of several that were also featured in the show proper. I was bopping and grooving along with Cin, as you do, until the Harpsichord solo, when it hit me that it was the first time I‚Äôd heard it since its originator, Peter, died. Micky and Nez glanced at each other for the briefest of moments, and it seemed as though something might have passed across both their faces. Nothing was said, and I fully admit I could have projected it. In any case, the moment passed, the guys started singing again, and we all joined in, as you do. üòä The first of a few times in the evening I was struck by how lightly they were carrying Peter‚Äôs loss‚Äîin a good way.\n\nSome of Shelly‚Äôs Blues (Phyllis‚Äô favorite Nez song)\n\nD.W Washburn (Which Nez apparently can‚Äôt stand üòâ )\n\nWhat am I doing hanging round?\n\nFeaturing Nez talking about Boomer Castleman and Michael Murphy: ‚ÄúBoomer‚Äôs no longer with us. See ya Boomer, Say Hi to Dave and Pete!‚Äù\n\nSometime in the Morning\n\nAndrew pointed out this song probably won‚Äôt be in the setlist for any of the shows this tour, so if this is the last time I ever hear this song live, what a lovely way to go out, sharing an intimate performance with about 30 of my fellow fans. I‚Äôve mentioned how much this tune means to me in a few previous reviews for a few different reasons, so I won‚Äôt belabor the point here. After this tune Andrew called forward one of the audience members, who had brought his vintage Monkees edition Gretsch to the show. And now, I‚Äôm not 100% sure, but it looked like Wayne was actually playing that guitar most of the main show! If so, how cool is that? In any case, after the audience member showed off his guitar, Nez told the story of his original (stolen) Gretsch 12-string, which somehow devolved into a tale of getting baked with Red Rhodes‚Ä¶\n\nTapioca Tundra\n\nAnother highlight moment, with Christian and Nez bantering with each other. At first Nez demurred that he didn‚Äôt remember the tune very well, after Christian responded a little teasing and waving of the ‚ÄúI wrote this‚Äù sign behind his dad‚Äôs head, the two did a lovely version that put me in mind of the version Nez did at Pantages. Another song I thought I‚Äôd never hear live again, and another song I was so thrilled I DID hear again. And then they transitioned seamlessly into the closing tune for soundcheck,\n\nPleasant Valley Sunday\n\nAnd with that, we bid the guys farewell for a couple hours, and Cin and I went down the street for Chinese. And because this was the kind of night it was turning into, we bumped into Jodi Ritzen and Marty Ross.\n\nThe Show:\n\nGood Clean Fun The Keswick Blues\n\nAnything I could say would not approach this amazing moment, so just watch. At the end we all leapt to our feet. Nez expressed his gratitude at surviving his near miss last year, and then renamed his song ‚ÄúThe Keswick Blues‚Äù to laughter and applause.\n\nLast Train to Clarksville\n\nSunny Girlfriend\n\nMary Mary\n\nYou Told Me\n\n‚ÄúPeter Chat‚Äù and For Pete‚Äôs Sake\n\nIn a well done segue, Micky pointed out that the banjo part in You Told Me (handled masterfully by backing band newcomer Probyn Gregory) was originated, of course, by Peter. Then, Micky matter of factly led the band into For Pete‚Äôs Sake. No Elegies, no dwelling, just a forthright tribute and on with the show, which I believe is almost certainly what Peter would have wanted. 70% of my brain was focused on singing along (as much of the audience also did), but a bit of my brain was chewing on how smoothly Micky had handled what could have been an awkward or maudlin transition, especially in comparison the cascade of Feels that were flowing on-stage and off in 2012 after Davy‚Äôs passing. I was now pretty sure that Micky and Nez had known what was going on for a lot longer than even when they dropped a few ominous hints last spring and summer, and had processed the loss in ways we hadn‚Äôt had the time to do yet (something later confirmed in an article on Billboard). But beyond that, it felt like there was a lesson in Nez and Micky‚Äôs approach to the evening. However, mid-Monkees concert is a decidedly stupid time for introspection, so I put a pin in that germ of a thought for later. Maybe on the ride home.\n\nDoor Into Summer\n\nUnlike Cleveland, Nez nailed it! My definitive version is still Tulsa in 2013, but it‚Äôs good to know that all Nez needed to give a killer performance of one of my favorites was a sufficient blood flow to his brain. üòâ\n\nYou Just may be the One\n\nLittle Bit Me, Little Bit You\n\nA non-insignificant part of the audience was playing along with the hand gestures. Some things never change.\n\nGirl I knew Somewhere\n\nBirth of an Accidental Hipster\n\nBest. Live. Hipster. EVER. (that I was present for, anyway)\n\nSt. Matthew\n\nPorpoise Song\n\nCircle Sky\n\nEvery time I‚Äôve heard Nez play this one, from 2012 to now, he seems just a little bit more incredulous as he sings ‚ÄúIt looks like we made it once again!‚Äù\n\nWith good reason. üòâ\n\nPleasant Valley Sunday\n\nThe first time (I think) I‚Äôve heard them do this one so early in the set (it was the act 1 closer), and it actually works to get folks jazzed up to head into the break, buy lots of Merch, etc.\n\nIntermission\n\nIntermission was pretty straightforward. There was no projector at the Keswick, hence no Till Then Tribute or other videos. I bantered with Cin, handed out some buttons and met a few listeners, which I always simultaneously love and feel a smidge awkward about. Producing Zilch is inherently a solitary hobby in some ways. Yes, I hear Ken‚Äôs or Christine‚Äôs or Tim‚Äôs or Rosanne‚Äôs voice through my headset, and we‚Äôve all become good friends, but every hour of recording time translates to another two or three of solitary editing and sound work to create a final segment. (Well at least it takes that long for me, but of course I‚Äôm not the Podfather. üòâ ) Beyond that, even with over 7500 members of Zilch Nation FB, I‚Äôm still a little taken by surprise to meet living, breathing strangers who listen to our rambling of their own free will. Getting to know members of Zilch Nation in person is something I‚Äôm always grateful for, and a responsibility I take seriously.\n\nBack to the show!\n\nAct 2, as was the case last year, opened with an Acoustic set.\n\nPapa Genes Blues\n\nRandy Scouse Git\n\nFor all that I loved the Poncho and the Tympani and ‚ÄúTHE COLORS!!!‚Äù, every time I hear this arrangement of RSG, I love it more. Might be my favorite version.\n\nNine times Blue\n\nI‚Äôll Spend My Life With You\n\nJoanne\n\nDidn‚Äôt really expect to hear this one in a Monkees Show, but I‚Äôm glad of it. Just as he did at the Colonial a few months ago, Nez NAILED THE HIGH NOTES, with some lovely backing by Circe and Coco. (Note‚Äìfor brevity‚Äôs sake I‚Äôve glossed over my usual gushing over the backing band in this review. Tl;Dr‚Äìthey were everything they‚Äôve been in every show I‚Äôve ever seen with them, and more.)\n\nWith the Acoustic set done, we made the turn toward the last 10 songs of the evening.\n\nMe and Magdalena\n\nBeautiful. Might be my favorite version they‚Äôve done.\n\nAuntie‚Äôs Municipal Court\n\nNailed it even more impressively than in Cleveland, though I think the fact that it wasn‚Äôt 85 degrees and 85% humidity probably helped. üòä\n\nGoing Down\n\nExcellent as always, and they did the band intro here. Oh, and the gal in the front row fucking nailed her verse. Almost as impressive as when Christine did it in 2016.\n\nSweet Young Thing\n\nStepping Stone\n\nMicky, self-aware predictable performer that he is, actually treated us to some robot moves at the start of this one. We all laughed. (Somebody should try to calculate how many times he‚Äôs performed that song over the last 53 years between Monkees, solo, and other tours‚Äîit‚Äôs got to be closing in on 1000‚Ä¶)\n\nDaydream Believer\n\nNothing was said beyond what‚Äôs become the usual intro, and nothing needed to be said. But I can‚Äôt have been the only person in the hall who flashed back to the opening shots of that video as Alex Jules started in on the keyboard intro. And if such a thing was possible, the Sea of Light shone even more brightly than it ever had before. And as I gazed around the full house at the Keswick, and up at the mighty band on stage, the question I pondered in front of Van Gogh‚Äôs Sunflowers earlier in the day was answered.\n\nThe Monkees are still Memento Vivere. Even‚Äîno, especially‚Äîin March 2019.\n\nWhat am I Doing Hanging Round?\n\nI‚Äôve finally come to a decision as to who Sings this Better, after 7 years of waffling back and forth each time I heard Peter or Nez do it. Both give excellent performances, both interpretations have nuances that recommend themselves to the listener. More specifically, Nez knocked it out of the park this time. However‚Ä¶\n\nPeter sings this better. (Sorry‚Ä¶)\n\nEncore\n\nListen to the Band\n\nThat‚Äôs OK, though, because Nez and Company gave THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF LISTEN TO THE BAND I HAVE EVER HEARD.\n\nMaybe it was another one of those mini flashbacks, this time to 33 1/3rd, when Peter said ‚Äúhi‚Äù as Nez wandered up and plugged his guitar into an amp, Micky and Davy joined them, and the Monkees gave a live to camera performance that managed to simultaneously kill off one version of their band and give birth to a new version of the Monkees that has endured 50 years.\n\nNow, I‚Äôve always been ambivalent about the ‚ÄúI think I can make it alone‚Äù line. I wrote a whole diatribe about it back in 2014 if memory serves. But as I sang along to this song one more time, I got a sense of the deeper ways in which that line is true.\n\nAnd then they wrapped up with I‚Äôm a Believer.\n\nAs you do.\n\nAfterparty and Marty Ross Meet & Greet\n\nAfter saying Hi to Host Emeritus Craig Smith and Megan Stemm-Wade on the way out the door, Cin and I headed over to Jodi‚Äôs afterparty, featuring a meet and greet with Marty Ross. I got the singular honor of giving a New Monkee a Zilch Button, we chatted a little bit, and then I guarded our stuff at the table while Cin met and talked to a guy she‚Äôs been a fan of for over 30 years. As the event wound down, Marty Ross played a little mini-set of music, and ended it by telling a Peter Story!\n\nAbout 20 years ago, they were both at the same event (audition? Not sure on the details, it was after midnight at this point and I was kind of fading). Peter and Marty got to talking about the Beatles, as one does. Peter mentioned that he‚Äôd been working on a blues version of Lady Madonna, which he played with Marty. And Marty played that Bluesy Lady Madonna for us in turn. I wish I‚Äôd had my recorder going, because it was an excellent adaptation of the song, not to mention a beautiful tribute.\n\nEpilogue\n\nSo, a little over 12 hours after we were standing in front of one of Vincent Van Gogh‚Äôs masterpieces, Cin and I were trying to stay awake in our Uber home. My mind was drifting, and I found myself thinking back to the understated and lovely ways Micky and Nez paid tribute to a man they both called a brother on Facebook when the world found out the news we now know they had been anticipating for a few years. Their chill approach to performing in the shadow of Peter‚Äôs passing created a space where we could focus on celebrating, not mourning. (I was struggling to describe it to Christine earlier today, and she gave me the word ‚ÄúSteady‚Äù. That nailed it.)\n\nBut there I was, in the back of the Uber, realizing that what Micky and Nez did was actually a pretty cool gift for us. The evening wasn‚Äôt about them, or the audience, or even Peter or Davy. It was about The Monkees‚Äîthe whole weird unlikely convoluted Shades of Grey phenomenon that we‚Äôve all co-created over the last 53 years. We all came together, and they led us as we all invoked that weird, well, whatever the hell thing The Monkees is, and we discovered that the magic, evolving though it might be, was still alive and well in 2019.\n\nAnd then a song that wasn‚Äôt in the show, and most likely will never be in another Monkees show again, came to mind. And yeah, I‚Äôm fully aware Peter was writing about the Tao, but as I drowsily watched the streets of Philadelphia roll by my window, it seemed to fit both that night at the Keswick, and everything in the previous 53 years that led up to it.\n\nSomething doesn‚Äôt change\n\nThere is only one\n\nAlways changing inside\n\nWhat does it become?\n\nCan you dig it?\n\nDo you know?\n\nWould you care to let it show?\n\nThose who know it use it\n\nThose who scorn it die\n\nTo sing that you can dig it\n\nIs to make your soul to fly to heaven.\n\nCan you dig it?\n\nDo you know?\n\nWould you care to let it show?\n\nThere is only feeling\n\nIn this world of life and death\n\nI sing the praise of never change\n\nWith every single breath\n\nCan you dig it?\n\nDo you know?\n\nWould you care to let it show?\n\nNext up on Fandom Lenses, God willing and the creek don‚Äôt rise, is The Monkees‚Äô final (currently scheduled‚Ä¶) United States show, back at the Family Arena in St. Louis. Dedicated readers may remember that the first time I saw a show there, I had a strong, deeply visceral hunch that the show was the last time I would ever see the Monkees. Turns out I was 33 1/3% right. Now, I hope that premonition continues to be mostly wrong, but I shelled out for a good seat‚Äîjust in case. Can you be simultaneously extremely excited for a concert and hopeful that it takes a little longer to get here?"
