        "text": "Recently, I came across a music blog called \"Talk from the Rock Room.\" It discussed a non-existent \"album that should exist\" by Michael Nesmith of the Monkees. But the blog had no actual album to download and listen to. I think the idea was a good one, so I asked my musical friend Mike Solof if he could put something together. He's a big Monkees fan, so he agreed. This is the result. It follows the track list of the \"Rock Room\" music blog, but has some extra songs at the end.\n\nMost of these songs were recorded in 1968. Even though Nesmith was a member of the Monkees at the time, he was backed by studio musicians in Nashville, Tennessee who specialized in country music. No other members of the Monkees were involved I believe, so this should be considered a Nesmith solo album, even though most of the songs eventually came out on Monkees albums, especially archival releases.\n\nKeep in mind that \"country rock\" was just coming into being in 1968. \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo,\" an album released by the Byrds in August 1968, is widely considered the first country rock album. But all but one of the songs here were recorded before that album was released. Had these songs been released in late 1968, as they should have been, Nesmith would have rightly been considered one of the founders of country rock. Instead, most of these stayed in the vaults, though a couple came out on Monkees albums, with \"Listen to the Band\" in particular being a minor hit in 1969 after extra horns were added.\n\nAs usual, Mike has written more extensive notes in a PDF, and in this case it includes notes taken from the \"Rock Room\" essay about this imagined album. But I just want to further note that the only song here not recorded by mid-1968 is \"Down the Highway.\" We thought it was, but shortly before posting this, I found out it was actually recorded in 1969. However, it fits with the rest musical, so we've kept it. Also note that the last three songs are acoustic demos of songs earlier in the album, so one might consider them bonus tracks.\n\nThis album is 41 minutes long. If you don't include the last four songs (\"Down the Highway\" and the acoustic demos), the core of this album, all but one song recorded in Nashville, is 32 minutes long.\n\nFinally, thanks to the \"Talk from the Rock Room\" blog for allowing us to use their idea and much of their text about it.\n\n01 Listen to the Band (Michael Nesmith)\n\n02 Propinquity [I've Just Begun to Care] (Michael Nesmith)\n\n03 St. Matthew (Michael Nesmith)\n\n04 The Crippled Lion (Michael Nesmith)\n\n05 Good Clean Fun (Michael Nesmith)\n\n06 Don't Wait for Me (Michael Nesmith)\n\n07 Some of Shelley's Blues (Michael Nesmith)\n\n08 How Insensitive [Insensatez] (Michael Nesmith)\n\n09 Hollywood (Michael Nesmith)\n\n10 Carlisle Wheeling (Michael Nesmith)\n\n11 Nine Times Blue (Michael Nesmith)\n\n12 If I Ever Get to Saginaw Again (Michael Nesmith)\n\n13 Down the Highway (Michael Nesmith)\n\n14 Propinquity [I've Just Begun to Care] [Demo] (Michael Nesmith)\n\n15 St. Matthew [Demo] (Michael Nesmith)\n\n16 Nine Times Blue [Demo] (Michael Nesmith)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16072728/MchaelNsmth_1968_ListntotheBnd_atse.zip.html"
