Nesmith won a Grammy in 1981 for his song \"Elephant Parts” in the newly created category of Video of the Year. Clearly innovation was in Nesmith’s genes as his mother was the inventor of the typewriter correction fluid, Liquid Paper. Nesmith has produced several feature films, including 1984's Repo Man and is also an author and record producer. He continues to be involved occasionally in Monkees projects and tours with his solo material. Nesmith has long been associated with Gretsch guitars."
