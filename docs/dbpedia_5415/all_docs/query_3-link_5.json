        "text": "While you're waiting...\n\nWho or what was the First National Band??\n\nInevitably this question has to be asked and I will have ot answer it (sigh!)...The First National Band are now recognised as being one of the earliest pioneers of the 'country-rock' sound along with The Flying Burrito Brothers in the early seventies. Michael Nesmith was a teenybop idol called Mike Nesmith in a certain manufactured sixties group (whose name I refuse to mention) with some success. But Mike was destined for greater things as few teenyboppers were aware of his musical and songwriting abilities (which are phenomenal, by the way). He deserved credit, recognition. He deserved critical praise. He deserved to be called by his full christian name. The group he was in sank to the level they were destined for by doing 'Kool-Aid' commercials and that was when Mike knew he had to get out.\n\nFree at last he became Michael Nesmith and joined John Ware and John London (Kuehne) in the First National Band. Once Orville J. Rhodes joined them they were all set to rock the country scene. However, two years and three superb albums later the band split and recieved little or no recognition from the public. While the other three drifted back to session music, Nez went on to greater things in his life, which the public continued to ignore. His solo country work and his dealings in the video/arts market has only recently been re-discovered along with the classic 1970-71 years.\n\nThis ignorance has been made all the tragic by the fact that only Nesmith and Ware are still alive today. The First National Band never reunited and now will never play again. Magnetic South, Loose Salute and Nevada Fighter are all that we have to tell us what the First National Band sounds like. I, for one, certainly wouldn't of minded going to see them live. Yet, it's a rich legacy that's been left all the same and it's about time that they were brought into the sort of public attention they've been so long kept out of.\n\nThat's why this website was set up...\n\nARDL. October 2000."
