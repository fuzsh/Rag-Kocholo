        "text": "Michael Nesmith (Photo: Alex Battaglia)\n\nSinger/guitarist Michael Nesmith of the Monkees has passed away at the age of 78, it was announced by his family in a statement on Friday morning and reported by Rolling Stone.\n\n“With Infinite Love we announce that Michael Nesmith has passed away this morning in his home, surrounded by family, peacefully and of natural causes,” said his family. “We ask that you respect our privacy at this time and we thank you for the love and light that all of you have shown him and us.”\n\nMonkees band manager Andrew Sandoval issued a statement of his own regarding Nesmith’s passing:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/andrew.sandoval.007/posts/10223644744814423?__cft__[0]=AZX0xCL3vgFkzo5tlQf_Q08TBtq9IGAYXuI0O1wHVo2dB6jWanEpJ_R82qyZiymCuTFYYf7zb88_-nbK44M_VJJW_5vOWdF0r7ln1ISxIiqv4KU7L6Qs8DVGmuOJ3dp6Jcw&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R\n\nAs did Micky Dolenz:\n\nWith his passing, Nesmith is the third Monkee to die in the past decade; Davy Jones passed in 2012 of a heart attack and Peter Tork died in 2019 after a fight with adenoid cystic carcinoma.\n\nNews of his death comes just weeks after Nesmith and Micky Dolenz completed a Monkees Farewell Tour, which officially wrapped on Nov. 14 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nRegarding the Farewell Tour, Rock Cellar spoke with Dolenz back in June, and he explained the outing as follows:\n\n“We’re doing the tour that we originally were going to do a year and a half ago. We’d already toured this show, The Monkees Present the Mike and Micky Show, and then COVID hit.\n\nAt this point, I would say it probably is the Farewell Tour as the Monkees because we’re not the Monkees. I’m not saying that Mike and I might never sing again, but not in this kind of context. We couldn’t call it the Monkees, we didn’t. When we decided to go out and the agent said they thought they could book a tour, we said, “Well, we’re not going to go out as the Monkees.” And they said that’s fine. That’s when we came up with the idea of The Monkees Present the Mike and Micky Show.”\n\nMay Michael Nesmith rest in peace."
