This was a routine he had learned years\n\nearlier to protect himself from the verbal barbs audiences on the\n\nGreenwich Village folk music scene would sometimes hurl.\n\nBut in an interview done last week in preparation for a performance\n\nof Shoes Swede Blue band in Secaucus later this month, Tork showed\n\nhe had thought a lot about his career and the choices he had made\n\nover the last three decades.\n\nTork is scheduled to perform twice at the Super Mega Show at the\n\nCrowne Plaza in Secaucus on Sept. 20 and 21, and will also have a\n\ntalk about his career and his relatively new venture into the blues\n\nat a special Saturday night dinner concert.\n\nTork grew up in a family that emphasized folk and classical music,\n\nand became part of the second generation of the Greenwich Village\n\nfolk scene in the early 1960s that included Roger McGuinn, Richie\n\nHavens, John Sebastian, Joan Bias, Steven Stills and others.\n\n“Most of us played the same kind of music,” he said, rattling off\n\nthe names of what have become for most of us classic folk tunes.\n\nHe said folk singer Peter Seeger, a member of the Weavers, had a\n\nlarge influence on him.\n\nPerhaps a bit disillusioned with the lack of success in the Village\n\nscene, Tork sought out success on the West Coast, hooking up for a\n\nbrief time with Steven Stills in Los Angeles. It was Stills who told\n\nTork about the auditions for the TV show.\n\nAlthough capable of playing numerous instruments, including banjo\n\nand guitar, it was not his musical talent that allowed him to get\n\nthe part of the lovable, somewhat slow-witted Monkee, but the\n\ncharacter he had developed on stage.\n\nDesigned to evoke the wackiness of the Beatles’ movie “Hard Days\n\nNight,” the Monkees TV show, Tork admitted, used every corny plot\n\never created for television. Yet the program broke new ground in one\n\nparticular area, it presented a family-like group not controlled by\n\na parent-like figure. This paved the way for several other hit TV\n\nshows that made use of a similar format.\n\nThe Monkees, while billed as a band with records topping the charts,\n\nwere not initially a band, but a group of actors playing parts. Yet\n\nas time went on, the actors gelled and sought to become more\n\ninvolved with their parts by seeking to live up to some of the hype\n\nby actually playing the instruments. Of the four, however, Tork was\n\nthe only actual musician going in, and until he sought a greater\n\nmusic role, he played only a minor part in the musical production.\n\nEgos clashed as management mistook the band’s intentions.\n\n“We didn’t want creative control,” Tork recalled. “We just wanted to\n\nplay our own instruments.”\n\nAnd for a short time, the illusion created by Hollywood actually\n\ncame together as a band with the album Headquarters as their most\n\ncommercially successful effort and the soundtrack to their movie,\n\nHead, perhaps the most artistically successful.\n\nMany of the hit singles put out under the name Monkees were\n\nghostwritten for them by people like Carol King, Neil Diamond and\n\nothers.\n\n“They were great songs, but they weren’t our songs,” he said.\n\nGetting the chops to play the blues\n\nDuring a telephone interview last week, Tork talked about the past,\n\nbut also about the present, about his reluctant steps towards\n\nsinging the blues.\n\nWhile he always loved the blues, listening to some of the greats\n\nperform them, he always felt he lacked something that would allow\n\nhim to reach into that part of himself.\n\n“The Blues over took me at a time I was left without feelings,” he\n\nsaid. “Before that, I didn’t know how to do it, or didn’t feel I had\n\na right to do it, and didn’t know if I could ever do it.”\n\nPerhaps time allowed him to develop those experiences, the common\n\npain and joys that allow people to find ground upon which to agree.\n\nEverybody suffers. Everybody works through problems, indeed, even a\n\none-time superstar like Tork.\n\nIn fact, Tork went broke shortly after The Monkees broke up, and\n\nlike many people of his generation, struggled through the issue of\n\ndrug and alcohol abuse, eventually giving them up. After years of\n\nmenial jobs such as washing dishes, and even an stint as a high\n\nschool teacher, Tork found voice and comfort in singing the blues.\n\n“My experience with the blues when I do it well, is that I am\n\nrelieved of my trials and tribulations,” he said. “The blues remove\n\nyou for a moment from everyday worries.”\n\nBut more importantly, he said, the blues allow people to realize\n\nthat everyone is struggling through similar situations, building a\n\ncommon reference of understanding.\n\n“People might go out later and treat others a little better because\n\nthey’ve come to understand we’re all have the same kind of\n\nproblems,” Tork said. “Blues isn’t about being blue. It’s about\n\nsadness, women, low life up bringing, but it is not designed to\n\nbring you down. Everyone relaxes a little and maybe treats their\n\nneighbor a little better.”\n\nTork became involved with Shoe Suede Blues in 1994 as a part of what\n\nwas supposed to be a one-time fund-raiser for a charity event.\n\nPeople liked it so much, he and the other members continued on. Some\n\nmembers have come and gone over the years, but the band has always\n\nhad an impressive musical lineup.\n\nThe group coming to Secaucus on Sept. 20 through 21 includes Michael\n\nSunday, a one-time member of Blues Underground; John Palmer, who has\n\nplayed with The 5th Dimension; The Diamonds; Rosie and the\n\nOriginals; The Penguins and Sha Na Na, and Richard Mikuls, whose\n\ncredits include work with Rufus, BB King, Ike and Tina Turner, Chuck\n\nBerry, Sly Stone, Quincy Jones, Ray Charles, Little Richards, Jerry\n\nLee Lewis, the Pointer Sisters and others.\n\nTork said performances at the Crowne Plaza in Secaucus will be about\n\nan hour long, and will include a special dinner talk about music,\n\nthe Monkees, politics and overall life.\n\n“Something like this interview,” Tork said.\n\nPerformances include a variety of well-known and not so well-know\n\nblues tunes, including some bluesy Monkee tunes.\n\nThe band has two CDs that will be for sale at the event, one a\n\ncommercial release that includes a variety of cover tunes, and the\n\nother a live souvenir edition only available so far at their shows,\n\nincluding original material and obscure blues numbers\n\nAlthough a West Coast resident, Tork said most of the tours are east\n\nof the Mississippi River, including previous performances in\n\nSecaucus at the Super Mega Show.\n\nThe event, which is a kind of collectable, toy and comic fair, has a\n\nscore of other guests, former movie and television stars, and models\n\nand wrestlers on the bill. The cost is $16 per day or $30 for two\n\ndays (with admission to the concert for both days). A super VIP\n\nWeekend Pass of $150 includes all the weekend events including an\n\nexclusive Saturday night dinner and concert.

Sandy returned to The Monkees in September\n\n1996 as well as in early 1997 when all four members performed a\n\nmonth long tour of the UK. They continued through the summer in the\n\nUS without Nesmith. By the time the 2001 Monkees reunion came\n\naround, Sandy was back in the mix behind the drum set where he\n\nstayed until the end of 2002. Now no stranger to the Monkees\n\ncommunity, Sandy is currently on the road with Davy Jones where he\n\nhas performed for the past few years between Monkees reunions.\n\nIn addition to The Monkees & Davy Jones, Sandy has performed or\n\nrecorded with artists such as Joan Jett, Cyndi Lauper, Michael\n\nBolton, Johnny Winter, The Pat Travers Band, Robin Gibb and has\n\nappeared on various TV programs like the Grammy Awards, The Tonight\n\nShow, American Bandstand, Entertainment Tonight, and the MTV Video\n\nMusic Awards.\n\nIn early September 2003, Sandy was nice enough to take time out of\n\nhis schedule to answer some of Monkeesrule43 Online’s questions\n\nabout his experiences while on tour with The Monkees & Davy Jones\n\nover the past 15+ years.\n\n——-\n\n1.) What has it been like to work with The Monkees & Davy Jones\n\nsince the mid-80s?\n\n– It has been a total gas workin’ with The Monkees and Davy\n\nsince 1987. Musically, because of all the different songwriters,\n\nit’s a very interesting gig to do. We have pop, country, swing,\n\nblues, and ballads among other styles. Few gigs have such a wide\n\nvariety of material. Personally, I’ve become very close friends with\n\nDavy, Micky, and Peter.\n\n2.) Were you a fan of The Monkees before you got involved or were\n\nyou just looking for a gig?\n\n– I was a definite fan of the Monkees when the show originally\n\naired in the sixties. I used to rush home from school to watch it.\n\n3.) Is the relationship between you & your bandmates personal or\n\nstrictly professional?\n\n– My relationship is personal as well as professional.\n\n4.) What’s more enjoyable, being on tour with The Monkees as a\n\ngroup or Davy Jones solo?\n\n– It’s difficult to say which is more fun, touring with The\n\nMonkees or with Davy. They are different, yet the same.\n\n5.) Do you like a more hectic & busy tour schedule as opposed to 30\n\nor so scattered dates per year?\n\n– I like a busy schedule. The time goes by quicker and it’s\n\nless costly for management. The more days off you have, the more\n\nexpensive it gets. However, playing scattered dates allows more time\n\nhome with the family and domestic responsibilities. There’s good and\n\nnot so good aspects to both situations.\n\n6.) Has the reaction to the Monkees show from the crowds changed\n\nsince you first became involved?\n\n– The reaction to the show has been as enthusiastic as ever.\n\nThe number of people coming to the shows has lessened however since\n\nthe first reunion tour in ’86.\n\n7.) Do you find there to be a significant difference in the show’s\n\nsetup when only 2 Monkees are there as opposed 3 or 4?\n\n– The more Monkees that are involved in the show, the more\n\nstructured the show has to be. It also means the show will remain\n\nthe same night after night. When Davy tours solo it’s a lot less\n\nstructured. He can tell as many jokes as he wants and even though\n\nthere’s a set list, he can call a song “on the fly” if he wants.\n\nThere’s more spontaneity.\n\n8.) Was there any added “Monkee Magic” when Mike Nesmith joined in\n\nfor the ’97 UK tour? What was he like to work with and how severe of\n\na blow was it to the band & other Monkees when he dropped out of the\n\nUS tour?\n\n– There was definitely a buzz when we did that tour of the UK\n\nwith Mike in ’97. Personally, I didn’t get to know him very well,\n\nbut we hang out socially on occasion. Musically, he’s great to work\n\nwith. He conveys his ideas very clearly. I loved playin’ his\n\nmaterial because the tunes he chose from his solo career had a\n\nCarribbean/island kind of feel, which I don’t get the opportunity to\n\nplay that often. It was fun. We were all disappointed that he\n\ndeclined to tour that following summer in the US, but the 3\n\nremaining Monkees went out nonetheless. I wouldn’t call it a severe\n\nblow.\n\n9.) What’s your favorite song to perform?\n\n– Favorite song? It’s hard to limit it to one. “She Hangs\n\nOut,” “Is You Is (Or Is You Ain’t My Baby)”, “(I’ll) Love You\n\nForever,” and “I’m A Believer” are among my faves.\n\n10.) Does it tend to get old playing the same songs every time you\n\ngo out on stage or is it still fun?\n\n– Playing live is still fun for me even though with The\n\nMonkees I’ve been playing more or less the same tunes for a number\n\nof years.\n\n11.) Have you seen the new Monkees “Live Summer Tour” DVD? If so,\n\nwhat are your thoughts on it?\n\n– I have the “Live Summer Tour” DVD and like it very much. I\n\nthink the audio and video are excellent. We had fun doing it.\n\n12.) Are you aware that an extended & uncut version of the DVD is\n\navailable for pre-order online now?\n\n– I do know the uncut version is available, but I’ve never\n\nseen it. I would like to however.\n\n13.) When I went to Davy’s solo show in Westbury in July, he came\n\nout in his pajamas. Did the band & crew know about this beforehand?\n\n– The band did not know that Davy’s entrance at Westbury would\n\nbe in his PJs. Expect the unexpected.\n\n14.) Who came up with the band’s introduction routine at the\n\nbeginning of the show?\n\n– Davy came up with the intro routine at the beginning of the\n\nshow. The band embellishes it.\n\n15.) Do you see another Monkees reunion happening in the future\n\nafter the way the 2001 tour ended with Peter?\n\n– With The Monkees anything is possible. A reunion with\n\nDavy/Micky is more likely than Davy/Micky/Peter, in my opinion.\n\nInterview URL: http://www.monkeesrule43.com/int_gennaro.html\n\n++++++++++++++++++\n\nFrom: “Brad Waddell”\n\nHold the phone, I never knew that Don Kirshner was the genius he\n\nmust be – check out his biography listed in this recent press\n\nrelease below.\n\nNot only did Don create The Monkees (I can’t believe how naive I was\n\nto think Bert and Bob created them) but he also invented MTV!
