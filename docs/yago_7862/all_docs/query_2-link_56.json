        "text": "Starring: Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill, Heinz Bennent, Margit Carstensen\n\nDrawing elements from marital dramas, political thrillers and good old-fashioned blood-and-guts horror, Andrzej Żuławski’s Possession chronicles the dissolution of a marriage between a spy (Sam Neill) and his increasingly erratic wife (Isabelle Adjani).\n\nBack from a mission abroad, Mark comes home to discover that his wife, Anna, wants a divorce. Unable to shake his wife’s sudden change in heart, Mark begins an investigation into her downward spiral only to discover that she’s come completely unraveled, a frothing, raving, violent shell of her former self. The source of her madness seems to come from within her Berlin apartment, and boy… it ain’t pretty."
