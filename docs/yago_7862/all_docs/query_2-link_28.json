        "text": "When Evil Lurks tells the story of friends Pedro and Jaime who come upon a man possessed by an unborn demon. Known as “a Rotten,” the man must have the demon exorcised before it's born. Unfortunately, attempts to kill the demon only lead to it spreading to other people, including members of Pedro's family. With the help of a “Cleaner” named Mirta, Pedro must destroy the demon before it spreads any further.\n\nWhen Evil Lurks diverges from traditional possession films because the demon is able to splinter off and infect countless people. Pedro and Mirta's visit to the school where all the children have been possessed is especially creepy. All in all, the movie is a solid mix of horror and gore.\n\nIn the Australian psychological horror movie Talk to Me, a group of friends gather to play with a mummified hand with supernatural powers. Participants are supposed to hold the hand for no more than 90 seconds while saying the phrases “Talk to me” and “I let you in” in order to be briefly possessed. However, when the character of Mia holds onto the hand for too long, she's plagued by an evil spirit that is bent on killing Mia and those around her.\n\nTalk to Me is delightfully unsettling, filled with horror, gore, and demonic toe-sucking.\n\nPromoted as a “Christian” horror movie, Nefarious opens at a prison where serial killer Edward Wayne Brady is on the verge of being executed. Dr. James Martin is brought in to evaluate Edward's sanity; if Edward is found sane, he'll be executed for his crimes. However, Dr. Martin questions Edward's sanity when he tells the doctor he's a demon known as Nefarious who is possessing Edward's body.\n\nAlthough Martin doesn't believe Nefarious at first, the demon knows extremely personal things about Martin that make the doctor second guess himself. Martin ultimately calls upon the power of God to save himself from Nefarious.\n\nAlthough religion plays a role in most possession movies, Nefarious weaves Christianity into the plot in a more heavy-handed way than others. This choice earned the film mixed reviews.\n\nIn Evil Dead Rise, an earthquake uncovers old recordings made by a priest trying to exorcise demons known as “Deadites” in the 1920s. The recordings were hidden in the basement of an apartment complex, and the residents started experiencing demonic possession. The film's protagonist, Beth, must fight off the possessed individuals, which quickly start to include members of her family. Three family members combine into a monstrous being known as The Marauder, and it's up to Beth and her young niece to stop it before anyone else is possessed.\n\nEvil Dead Rise feels like part possession movie and part zombie flick. The combination is satisfying, and the film's ending cleverly loops back to the terrifying opening scene.\n\nThe sixth movie in the popular V/H/S franchise takes a familiar but fresh approach to documentary-style horror movies. Broken up into five stories with a series of “interludes” that document a creature known as “Rory,” the film offers a range of horror tropes.\n\nIn the second segment, “God of Death,” the 1985 Mexico City earthquake wipes out a news team at a local television station with the exception of a cameraman named Luis. When a rescue team arrives, they uncover the statue of an Aztec god hidden in a skull-lined room in the TV studio's basement. It doesn't take long until everyone becomes possessed, and the grainy, documentarian nature of the filming only adds to the disturbing scene.\n\nThe Pope's Exorcist is a classic take on demonic possession. Set in 1987, Father Gabriele Amorth is sent to a dilapidated abbey in Spain where a young boy named Henry is possessed by a demon. Amorth is the Pope's personal exorcist and is criticized by some for his unconventional methods. After arriving in Spain, Amorth seeks out local priest Father Tomas Esquibel to aid him in purging the demon from Henry. An intense battle for Henry's soul ensues, and both Amorth and Esquibel must reveal past sins in order to free themselves while also freeing Henry.\n\nWhile there's nothing edgy about The Pope's Exorcist's take on possession, it does a solid job of following traditional tropes. The ending, in which Amorth and Esquibel examine a map of evil places across the world, leaves the film wide open to a sequel."
