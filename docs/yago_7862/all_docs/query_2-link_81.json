        "text": "The packaging of the Limited Edition is gorgeous, one of the prettiest I've ever seen. The great and famous original movie poster is featured on the box, but is again framed by a thick velvet-covered outer slipcase.\n\nThe box is closed through magnets, and opening it shows two inner compartments.\n\nOpening the compartments reveals the physical extras, and the two discs. One disc is the Blu-ray, the other one is the CD soundtrack.\n\nClearing out the left compartment: there are artcards, replicas of the US lobby cards, a replica of the Japanese flyer, a certificate of authenticity, and last-but-definitely-not-least the thick booklet.\n\nA closer look at the excellent booklet. It's 84 pages and chock full of interviews, articles and photographs, several of which are exclusive to this edition. We're talking Arrow and Eureka MOC type quality here."
