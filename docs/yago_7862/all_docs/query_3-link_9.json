        "text": "The last time we saw Joan Crawford, in the Warner's \"Humoresque\"—the last time, that is, before just seeing her in that same studio's \"Possessed\"—she was walking out into the ocean with the intention of drowning herself because John Garfield didn't love her as much as he loved music—speaking fictionally, of course. Apparently she succeeded, to judge by Hollywood's new film, and apparently this is her spirit—or a transmigration thereof—which we now see.For not only does Miss Crawford resemble anything so much as a water-logged cadaver at the outset of \"Possessed\"—and, for that matter, never looks completely dehydrated at any stage of the film—but her whole attitude throughout the drama is that of a desperate woman's ghost wailing for a demon-lover beneath a waning moon. And, indeed, the basic conflict in the story is so similar to that in \"Humoresque\" that the ghost aspect of the characterization seems to be almost studiously contrived.In this picture, as in the former, Miss Crawford plays a dame who goes mad because the man of her devotion doesn't love her the way she loves him. Only this time she goes completely batty and lands in a psychopathic ward, where, under the influence of narco-hypnosis, she relates her tragic tale.It is the tale of an unbalanced woman—a schizophrenic, as they point out—who develops a persecution complex when her lover refuses to marry her. (All of this clinical data is orally noted by the doctors attending the case, and it is to them that we are indebted for keeping us posted as the story unfolds.) And, although she eventually marries another—a man whose wife has committed suicide—she can never forgive the gent who jilts her, especially when he starts romancing her step-daughter. She grows hysterical, she has hallucinations, hollow voices ring in her ears. Finally she shoots her old lover and is off to the looney-bin.As a visualized psychoanalysis, this film has its fascinating points, even though it does leave some broad areas of the lady's neurosis unexplained. Her crack-up is fairly documented, within the frame of a primarily fictional film, and the efficiency and dispassion of science are suggested in a rather credible way. Stanley Ridges, as the psychiatrist, is the one person in the film whose preoccupation with his problem can be reasonably believed.But the morbidness of the drama and particularly its one-track emphasis upon the frustrations of a female are a little too thick for free flow. It is just a bit oppressive to see so much exclusive attention and sympathy lavished upon a woman whose life has been so conveniently warped. And, despite some rather classy histrionics, Miss Crawford in this role appears more a representation of a pampered actress than of a truly jangled dame.We'd like to sense, for instance, more respect and sympathy for Van Heflin, who is eminently worth it as the lover whom Miss Crawford shoots, or for Raymond Massey, who is sketched but lightly as the poor, unlucky man who marries her. Both of these unhappy fellows are given much too short and casual shrift. And we'd like to see treated more fully the role played by Geraldine Brooks, a newcomer who Hepburns brightly and warmly as Miss Crawford's sensitive step-daughter.However, it is wholly obvious that the writers and Director Curt Bernhardt were told to concentrate on the torments of Miss Crawford, Hollywood's current Great Sufferer, Academy style.\n\nPOSSESSED, screen play by Silvia Richards and Ranald MacDougall, based on a story by Rita Weiman; directed by Curtis Bernhardt; produced by Jerry Wald for Warner Brothers.

That much we knew before seeing the story of their battling career acted out yesterday on the screen at Loew's State in \"The Fabulous Dorseys.\" The picture naturally stresses their musicianship, with the result that Tommy's trombone and Jimmy's saxophone stand out from the dialogue, which is just as well. Whether the film is a fairly accurate account of their rise from humble beginnings we don't pretend to know, but it seems they were always scrapping as kids and the passing of years did not cool their tempers any. In fact, with them both playing in the same band they found more cause for disagreement and finally split up, disliking each other intensely, to form their own bands. Oh, yes, a family tragedy reunites them for a happy ending.Whatever convinced Producer Charles R. Rogers that the Dorseys' life would make good screen material is one of those unfathomable Hollywood mysteries. Perhaps the boys do have a story worth the telling, but if that's the case then they should have found a more resourceful biographer. The brothers play themselves with ease, and Sara Allgood and Arthur Shields give sympathetic portrayals as their parents. Among guest star musicians in the film are Charlie Barnet, Henry Busse, Mike Pingatore, Ziggy Elman, Bob Eberly, Helen O'Connell, Art Tatum and Stuart Foster and Ray Bauduc.On the stage at the State are Leo Carrillo, the Berry Brothers, The Smoothies, Ross and Stone, the Chadwicks and the Three Edwards Brothers.\n\nAt Loew's StateTHE FABULOUS DORSEYS, screen play by Richard English, Art Arthur and Curtis Kenyon; directed by Alfred E.
