        "text": "Last Updated on August 5, 2024 by Angel Melanson\n\n2023 was another banner year for horror, and we’ve been quite spoiled in the last several years with this bountiful feast. As we reflect on our favorites from this year, we’re also looking forward to some major horror releasing in 2024.\n\nThe year kicked off with original horror from Blumhouse Night Swim. Spring brought us The First Omen, and we still have so much to look forward to. This year shows no signs of slowing down when it comes to upcoming new horror movies, this summer brings M. Night Shyamalan’s Trap to the big screen and in the fall we’ll get to revisit the ghost with the most in Beetlejuice 2.\n\nHere’s a complete list of all the new horror movies coming out in 2024. (At the bottom of the list, you can find TBD titles and all the horror movies that have already been released this year.)\n\nWe’ll keep adding more information as it comes in, this list has already grown quite a bit since December!\n\nTrap - August 2\n\nApril brought us the first trailer for M. Night Shyamalan's upcoming new horror movie Trap. It's hitting theaters August 9, and until that trailer drop, we didn't know much aside from the cast includes Josh Hartnett and Hayley Mills, which is exciting enough in itself.\n\nNow we know the plot of Trap involves a man attending a concert with his daughter where something sinister is set to occur. The trailer gives more than that, but you can watch the Trap trailer here if you want some more details! And although some folks say the trailer gives too much away, we know there's no way an M. Night Shyamalan movie is giving it up that easy!\n\nPreviously scheduled for August 2, M. Night Shyamalan's Trap was moved to an August 9 release date. It has since moved again, one week earlier. Trap will now be in theaters August 2. Probably. Most likely.\n\nCuckoo - August 9\n\nWe first heard about Cuckoo nearly two years ago when we brought you a first look still at Cuckoo star Hunter Schafer, with hardly any word on it since. After premiering at SXSW this year we got an initial May 3 theatrical announcement, which was then pushed to August 2, and the latest is that it will now be in theaters August 9th. But at least we finally have some plot details and the first official Cuckoo trailer.\n\n\"On a trip to the German Alps with her father and stepmother, Gretchen discovers that the resort town where they’re staying hides sinister secrets, as she’s plagued by strange noises and frightening visions of a woman pursuing her.\"\n\nWritten and directed by German filmmaker Tilman Singer (Luz), Cuckoo also stars Dan Stevens (The Guest), Jessica Henwick (Game of Thrones), Marton Csókás (Freelance), Greta Fernández (Santo) and Jan Bluthardt (Luz).\n\nThe latest is that Cuckoo will be in theaters August 9.\n\nAlien: Romulus August 16\n\nOfficially, this one is currently being referred to as \"Untitled Alien Event Movie.\" Unofficially (and on IMDB), it's been referred to as Alien: Romulus. Whatever the final title ends up being, we know for certain the star of the movie, Cailee Spaeny revealed in an interview with Variety that this installment is \"supposed to slot in between the first movie and the second movie\" from the original Alien franchise.\n\nStarring alongside Spaeny are Isabela Merced, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Spike Fearn and Aileen Wu. So far, the details of the standalone story remain tightly under wraps, but with a whole fifty-seven years of plot time to play with, it really could go anywhere.\n\nThe Crow - June 7 August 23\n\nOne month after the 30th anniversary of Alex Proyas' original The Crow adaptation, Rupert Sanders' adaptation of The Crow was originally set to make its way to theaters June 7 Lionsgate has since done a bit of shifting around, with The Crow remake now landing on the big screen August 23.\n\nBased on the iconic James O'Barr comic series of the same name, this time It and Barbarian star Bill Skarsgård will be playing the role of Eric Draven, who returns from the dead to take revenge on the evil bastards who murdered him and his girlfriend. Rupert Sanders, who previously helmed Ghost in the Shell and Snow White and the Huntsman, directs.\n\nWatch The Crow remake trailer right here.\n\nHell Hole - August 23\n\nIt's no secret we are big fans of the Adams family (Hellbender) around these parts! We are very excited to have new goodies from one of our favorite filmmaking outfits coming down the pipeline later this year. Their latest endeavor is a creature feature, making its way to the 2024 Fantasia Film Festival this summer.\n\nIn the Adams Family's celebration of the classic creature-feature, an American-led fracking crew working deep in the Serbian wilderness find themselves at odds with government assigned environmental advisors. When they get approval to drill, the workers uncover the unimaginable: a dormant parasitic monster entombed deep in the frozen rock. Now awakened, it tears through the mining facility in search of the perfect host.\n\nHell Hole will be streaming on Shudder August 23.\n\nBeetlejuice 2 — September 6\n\nAfter lots of rumors and false starts, Beetlejuice 2 wrapped in November. It's a real movie and we get to see it in 2024. We learned the official title on this one is Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and we even have a Beetlejuice Beetlejuice trailer and plot!\n\nAs Scott Wampler notes, \"We don't know much about Beetlejuice 2 (though we can say with certainty that it won't be Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, another iteration of this sequel that almost got made once upon a time), but the few things we do know are intriguing: for one thing, Beetlejuice will have a wife, played by Monica Bellucci.\n\nWe also know that Jenna Ortega will be playing the daughter of Winona Ryder's Lydia Deetz, and that Willem Dafoe is playing a former B-movie action star who's now working as a detective in the afterlife. How any of this fits together is anyone's guess, but we're admittedly very curious to find out.\n\nIn addition to the names mentioned above, Beetlejuice 2 will also star Catherine O'Hara and Justin Theroux. Here's everything we know so far about Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.\n\nSpeak No Evil - September 13\n\nUpdate: Originally slated for an August 9 release, Speak No Evil moves to Friday, September 13th. Universal also has \"Untitled Blumhouse Productions Film\" on the calendar for the same date, we'll keep them both on here for now, but they very well could be one and the same!\n\nSpeak No Evil was certainly one of the most brutal movies of 2022. As a matter of fact, it was one of the more brutal offerings in recent memory.\n\nAn American remake is on the way, starring James McAvoy and directed by Eden Lake's James Watkins from Christian and Mad Tafdrup's original screenplay. Just in case you've forgotten the synopsis of Speak No Evil (and it isn't seared into your nightmares like it is for us), in the original 2022 movie, a Danish family visits a Dutch family they met on a holiday.\n\nIn a tale of killer good manners, what was supposed to be an idyllic weekend slowly starts unraveling as the Danes try to stay polite in the face of unpleasantness.\n\nUntitled Blumhouse Productions Film – September 13\n\nWe have zero information about this one aside from a release date. September 13 just so happens to be a Friday the 13th, and we're curious to see what horrors Blumhouse will be offering up for the occasion.\n\nWe'll keep you posted as we learn more!\n\nThe Substance - September 20th\n\nI'm going to be honest. I did not expect a Cannes Best Screenplay winner to go this hard on the horror front. Folks have compared this to Death Becomes Her, it's a fair parallel. I won't tell you which movie it actually has the most in common with because I'd love for you to be as blindsided as I was. You'll have your chance when TheSubstance hits theaters on September 20th. Coralie Fargeat and the whole cast are firing on all cylinders here. What's The Substance about? Here's the official synopsis:\n\nStarring Demi Moore as Elisabeth Sparkle, a former A-lister past her prime and suddenly fired from her fitness TV show by repellent studio head Harvey (Dennis Quaid). She is then drawn to the opportunity presented by a mysterious new drug: THE SUBSTANCE. All it takes is one injection and she is reborn – temporarily – as the gorgeous, twentysomething Sue (Margaret Qualley). The only rule? Time needs to be split: exactly one week in one body, then one week in the other. No exceptions. A perfect balance. What could go wrong?\n\nA Different Man - September 20 (NY & LA), October 4 (Nationwide)\n\nThis fall, A24 brings us Sebastian Stan stars as aspiring actor Edward, who undergoes a radical medical procedure to drastically transform his appearance. But his new dream face quickly turns into a nightmare, as he loses out on the role he was born to play and becomes obsessed with reclaiming what was lost.\n\nWritten and directed by Aaron Schimberg (Chained For Life), starring alongside Stan: Renate Reinsve (The Worst Person In The World ), Adam Pearson (Under The Skin, Chained For Life). A Different Man World Premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, and won the Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance - 2024 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nA Different Man is in theaters September 20th (NY & LA), and October 4th (Nationwide).\n\nNever Let Go - September 27\n\nAlexandre Aja's new horror film has a fall release date, and we are pretty excited about it. Starring Halle Berry as a mother of twin sons trying to outrun and outlast the evil that lurks all around them. Here's the official synopsis:\n\nFrom visionary director Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes, Crawl) and the creative minds behind Stranger Things and Arrival comes NEVER LET GO. In this new psychological thriller/horror, as an Evil takes over the world beyond their front doorstep, the only protection for a mother, played by Academy Award® winner Halle Berry (Actress in a Leading Role, 2001 –Monster’s Ball), and her twin sons is their house and their family’s protective bond. Needing to stay connected at all times – even tethering themselves with ropes – they cling to one another, urging each other to never let go. But when one of the boys questions if the evil is real, the ties that bind them together are severed, triggering a terrifying fight for survival.\n\nSleep - September 27\n\nSouth Korean horror Sleep follows newlyweds Hyun-su (LEE Sun-kyun, Parasite) and Soo-jin (JUNG Yu-mi), whose domestic bliss is disrupted when Hyun-su begins speaking in his sleep, ominously stating, “Someone’s inside.”\n\nFrom that night on, whenever he falls asleep, Hyun-su transforms into someone else, with no recollection of what happened the night before. Overwhelmed with anxiety that he may hurt himself or their young family, Soo-jin can barely sleep because of this irrational fear. Despite treatment, Hyun-su’s sleepwalking only intensifies, and Soo-jin begins to feel that her unborn child may be in danger. A new thriller from director Jason Yu, who worked with Korean legends Bong Joon-ho and Lee Chang-dong before making his debut film, Sleep world-premiered in Cannes’ Critics’ Week.\n\nSleep is in theaters September 27th."
