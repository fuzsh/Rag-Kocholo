        "text": "The answer for the \"why\" is found in a scene that was cut from the original edit of the movie, transcribed here:\n\nScene 232\n\nINT. HALL OUTSIDE REGAN'S BEDROOM\n\nIn the dimness, Merrin and Karras lean against a wall, their faces numb with shock as they stare at door to Regan's room. O.S. singing continues.\n\nKARRAS: Father, what's going on in there? What is it? If that's the Devil, why this girl? It makes no sense.\n\nMERRIN: I think the point is to make us despair, Damien—to see ourselves as animal, and ugly—to reject our own humanity—to reject the possibility that God could ever love us.\n\nThat, more than anything else, is why Regan gets possessed.\n\nAccumulated evidence throughout the film makes clear that the demon inside Regan is a master of deception. Consider the \"holy water\" scene: the demon surely knows the difference between actual holy water, and the tap water that Karras is merely pretending is holy water. Yet it chooses to react as Regan would have, if she was merely a mentally ill little girl who only believed herself to be possessed, and thought she was splashed with real holy water.\n\nSo even though it may appear that Regan is the target of the demon's attacks, she is actually a weapon being employed against Karras. (That's something that I believe William Peter Blatty, the author of the book, has stated outright in interviews.) From her mouth the demon speaks in the voices of and repeats the words of both a bum who begged Karras for help but received none, and Karras' mother, whose recent death Karras feels is due at least in part to his neglect. Karras' loss of faith is less about doubting that there is a God who could save us, and more about doubting whether we deserve to be saved.\n\nCould the Ouija board have been a necessary step in Regan's possession? Perhaps. But then again, this demon is a deceiver. It pretends to Karras weaknesses and limits that it doesn't actually have, in order to further its game. If it picked a little girl who never did anything wrong to possess, then it would be obvious that the cause of the misfortune came from outside - that \"bad things happen to good people\". But by choosing a little girl who's played with a spirit board, it plants the seed \"maybe all this is happening to her because she brought it on herself\" - that maybe bad things happen to us because we're bad ourselves. Again, we've seen the demon capable of that kind of subtlety, so we have no way of knowing whether the Ouija board actually opened a door, or whether it simply wanted things to look that way. The demon wants us to believe we deserve the bad things that happen to us, but that doesn't mean it's the truth.\n\nIt seems fairly clear (at least by the end of the story) that the demon's target is Karras. The following exchange comes as close as anything to stating this explicitly (from IMDB quotes):\n\nDemon: What an excellent day for an exorcism.\n\nFather Damien Karras: You would like that?\n\nDemon: Intensely.\n\nFather Damien Karras: But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?\n\nDemon: It would bring us together.\n\nFather Damien Karras: You and Regan?\n\nDemon: You and us.\n\nRemember that at the time the demon seemed to be trying to deceive Karras by referring to itself as \"us\" (perhaps because Karras is a psychologist. He talks about having identified at least three personalities inside Reagan, it's a sort of thing an author might imagine that a psychologist would do :).\n\nAt the very end of the story, Karras explicitly invites the demon into him and it immediately does so. This suggests either that Karras was its target all along or that it wanted or required a willing or otherwise suitable host.\n\nBut this doesn't answer the question of \"Why Reagan?\" There are two major possibilities, neither of which is contradicted, as far as I remember, by either the book or the film.\n\nThe first suggestion is that the demon is an opportunist. It finds a way into the world via Reagan, perhaps because of the Ouija board, perhaps because she's lonely and a little neglected and therefore more susceptible. She has no understanding of the concept of demon possession and is apparently not freaked out by the fact that an invisible presence is talking to her. This suggests isolation from her peer group, as does her itinerant and protected lifestyle. The implication seems to be that the Ouija board got the demon's attention (otherwise why mention the board at all?) and that her isolation helped the demon to take hold of her. Reagan was also a good choice because her mother was oddly ignorant of the concept of possession too. Also, being an atheist, she made the reasonable assumption that Reagan's symptoms were caused by medical or psychological means. It's also worth noting that Reagan's mother was rich and powerful, which might be a useful tool for a demon intent on mayhem.\n\nIf the demon was simply taking an opportunity, then it would have found Reagan a good place to start. However, if Reagan were its ultimate goal, why didn't it just quietly inhabit her until it had opportunity to cause whatever mayhem it wanted? Why all the theatrics without actually achieving anything? Perhaps, as I said, it needed a willing host. The theatrics eventually caused Reagan's mother to believe in the possession. Perhaps it was looking for a particular kind of host: a priest? Someone with influence? Something more specific?\n\nHowever, if Reagan was an almost ideal initial target for the demon, Karras was a good match too. He was losing or had lost his faith. He was a psychologist, so would be drawn to Reagan's case. He was grieving and feeling guilty over his mother's death. It seems likely enough that the demon would wish to infiltrate and corrupt the church and possessing Karras – someone who worked with other priests having crises of faith – would be an excellent way to achieve this.\n\nAll of this could have been orchestrated by an opportunistic demon and a favourable set of circumstances. However, the second suggestion is that Karras was the demon's intended victim after all. There's some circumstantial evidence to suggest this, but if so it was a very convoluted plan with many points at which it could fail (which it eventually does, of course). The demon seems too cunning to rely on such a complicated set of events.\n\nNevertheless, there are some indications that it might be the case. For example, Reagan's first instance of really odd behaviour was the party scene, which happened to be attended by a priest; Father Karras' friend. Reagan's mother had already noticed and been impressed with Karras, especially by his intensity. She asks the priest about Karras and this conversation is part of the reason she eventually contacts Karras.\n\nReagan's doctor (and later team of doctors) believe at first that Reagan's symptoms are medical. When they have exhausted that possibility, psychological means are sought instead. When that proves fruitless too, the exorcism as a psychological tool possibility is raised. The demon was in a position to manipulate Reagan's symptoms to this end, but why bother? I think this is the strongest evidence that the demon might have been targeting Karras all along, presumably because of his wavering faith and his position in the church, which would have made corrupting other priests very easy.\n\nI favour the interpretation that the demon was an opportunist and a skilled tactical manipulator rather than a master strategist. It's the simplest and least convoluted explanation. But as far as I can remember, neither explanation is contradicted by either the book or the movie.\n\nSo to summarise: \"Why Reagan?\"\n\nIf the demon was an opportunist, she was an easy target.\n\nIf the demon was after Karras all along, she was the best means to get to him.\n\nThere are some suggestions in this thread that don't seem to be supported by either the movie or the book.\n\nThat the demon entered Reagan because she had started masturbating. As someone else pointed out, there is no mention of masturbation until the incident with the cross, which occurred after she was possessed. Besides, it doesn't answer the question of why Reagan because everybody masturbates unless it is physically impossible for some reason. Why isn't everyone infested by demons?\n\nThat Reagan had previously committed murder. There's no suggestion in the text or movie that this is the case. It seems likely that the demon murdered Dennings via Reagan but again, this is post-possession. The line about \"do you know what [your daughter] did?\" was delivered in Dennings' voice, after all, and clearly refers to his death.\n\nSexual abuse. Other than her mother and the nanny, Reagan didn't seem to have contact with... well... anyone, really and there's no suggestion of sexual abuse of any kind in the book or movie. The suggestion that Dennings might be abusing Reagan is not borne out. There are many reasons for Dennings being in Reagan's room. The demon could have made her scream for help. It could have called to Dennings in a voice he recognised. An adult being in a child's room is hardly a conclusive indicator of sexual abuse.\n\nWe're all speculating about a work of fiction in any case, of course.\n\nI wrote an entire essay on Blatty's supernatural/suspense novels years ago for Studies In Weird Fiction, \"So Much Mystery....\" reprinted later in the McFarland critical volume on Blatty's fiction American Exorcist. Though at this point, it could probably use a major expansion and updating! In any case, it helps to go back and study Blatty's novel, but the quick answer to this question is that, as Father Merrin states quite explicitly, that \"there is only one\" in answer to Karras's question about how many \"manifestations\" or demons/personalities are inhabiting Regan, implying that whether it's Pazuzu or whatever it calls itself, it's simply The Devil and his old foe come back to do battle once again.\n\nBut more to the point, I believe it's stated explicitly in the novel at least, that the target is NOT Regan, but rather, the figures surrounding her, or several in particular, including of course Merrin as the primary foe, and then Karras, Regan's mom, Dennings, and though off-screen, perhaps even Regan's estranged father. Regan is mainly just a vessel for Pazuzu/Satan (which doesn't really make much explicit sense since Pazuzu as we know is a pre-Christian Babylonian etc. demon and all that. It's just a manifestation of a greater evil, I think, an avatar, as Blatty seems to suggest through Merrin's former battles with Pazuzu as a primary \"face\" of Satan.)\n\nI hope this also goes some way towards answering this complicated question. Plus, she's vulnerable for various reasons, as are many of her family and friends and hangers-on of the McNeil household, given secularism, other haunted backgrounds, and some of the characters' weak or nonexistent faith (but particularly Father Karras's as regards his own doubt of faith and his guilt over his elderly mother, etc. etc.) As for someone on WBAI FM's radio show's assertion this Halloween 2016 that the face of Pazuzu in the film seen several times in quick, subliminal (nearly) shots, is supposed to be an evil creepy clown-face, is really NOT accurate. It might superficially resemble such a thing, but in reality it appears the \"face of the demon\" was in fact mainly inspired, as I read myself just recently, by the Noh demon mask of the classic Japanese horror film Onibaba, which inspired William Friedkin to have the demon face makeup designed, to some degree, in that manner."
