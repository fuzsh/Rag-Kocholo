        "text": "\"Can he be saved?\" Vertical has revealed the official trailer for a horror thriller film titled The Exorcism, starring Russell Crowe - though it's not related to his other exorcism film The Pope's Exorcist from last year. This was originally titled The Georgetown Project, but they gave it this new title that will confuse people into thinking it's related to the classic The Exorcist. Though it sort of is. This film is made by Joshua John Miller, son of actor Jason Miller, who played the doomed Father Karras in the original Exorcist film. It's inspired by his experiences growing up knowing his dad played that role. A troubled actor begins to unravel while shooting a horror film. His estranged daughter wonders if he's slipping back into his past addictions or if there's something more sinister at play. Also starring Ryan Simpkins, Sam Worthington, Chloe Bailey, Adam Goldberg, Samantha Mathis, & David Hyde Pierce. This is a pretty cool meta concept, a film-within-a-film horror about an actor being possessed. This trailer has some seriously scary moments...\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ two posters) for Joshua John Miller's The Exorcism, direct from YouTube:\n\n\"The origins of the film stem from my childhood spent watching my father, Jason Miller, playing the doomed Father Karras flinging himself out a window at the climax of The Exorcist. If that wasn’t haunting enough on its own, my dad never shied away from telling me stories of just how “cursed” the movie was: the mysterious fires that plagued the production, the strange deaths, the lifelong injuries— the list went on and on. The lore of any 'cursed film' has captivated me ever since.\n\n\"With The Exorcism, we wanted to update the possession movie formula ('Heroic man rescues woman from forces she's too weak and simple to battle herself!') for a world where no one group owns goodness and decency over another. We were gifted with an extraordinary cast & creative team to tell a story about how we’re all vulnerable to darkness, to perpetuating it, if we fail to face our demons. The devil may retaliate, but what other choice do we have?\" –Director Joshua John Miller"
