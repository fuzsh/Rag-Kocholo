        "text": "Russell Crowe (The Pope’s Exorcist) is starring in a brand new meta possession horror movie titled The Exorcism, and Vertical has unleashed the official trailer this afternoon.\n\nVertical has picked up the North American rights to The Exorcism, which they’ll be bringing to theaters on June 7. Shudder is also on board to bring the film home later this year.\n\nJoshua John Miller, who wrote 2015’s The Final Girls and also starred in films including Near Dark and And You Thought Your Parents Were Weird, directed The Exorcism.\n\nJoshua John Miller also wrote the script with M.A. Fortin (The Final Girls). This one is personal for Miller, as his late father was the star of the best possession movie ever made.\n\nMiller said in a statement this week, “The origins of the film stem from my childhood spent watching my father, Jason Miller, playing the doomed Father Karras flinging himself out a window at the climax of The Exorcist. If that wasn’t haunting enough on its own, my dad never shied away from telling me stories of just how “cursed” the movie was: the mysterious fires that plagued the production, the strange deaths, the lifelong injuries— the list went on and on. The lore of any “cursed film” has captivated me ever since.”\n\n“With The Exorcism, we wanted to update the possession movie formula (“Heroic man rescues woman from forces she’s too weak and simple to battle herself!”) for a world where no one group owns goodness and decency over another,” he adds. “We were gifted with an extraordinary cast and creative team to tell a story about how we’re all vulnerable to darkness, to perpetuating it, if we fail to face our demons. The devil may retaliate, but what other choice do we have?”\n\nThe film had previously been announced under the title The Georgetown Project.\n\n“The Exorcism follows Anthony Miller (Crowe), a troubled actor who begins to unravel while shooting a supernatural horror film. His estranged daughter (Ryan Simpkins) wonders if he’s slipping back into his past addictions or if there’s something more sinister at play.”\n\nSam Worthington (Avatar: The Way of Water), Chloe Bailey (Praise This), Adam Goldberg (The Equalizer) and David Hyde Pierce (Frasier) also star.\n\nOf particular note, Kevin Williamson (Scream, Sick) produced The Exorcism.\n\nPeacock invites you to face your fears this Halloween with more than 150 new horror titles headed to the streaming service from September 1 straight through All Hallow’s Eve.\n\nFrom Universal classics, like FRANKENSTEIN, THE RAVEN and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, and nostalgic favorites, like CHILD’S PLAY, THE CRAFT and CANDYMAN, to frightening franchises, like SAW, THE PURGE and LEPRECHAUN, and the best of Blumhouse, like GET OUT, HALLOWEEN KILLS and HAPPY DEATH DAY, Peacock aims to be “your Halloween HQ with a full spectrum of scares to enjoy.”\n\nNot to mention, two new originals – James Wan’s horror series, TEACUP, and satanic panic thriller, HYSTERIA!
