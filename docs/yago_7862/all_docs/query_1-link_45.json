        "text": "Every year as Christmas approaches, we all have movies that get us into the spirit of the holiday. Some films are about families and their holiday adventures, while others are about couples finding love during the “most wonderful time of the year.” But there are those Christmas movies that aren’t nearly as obvious. Some of us enjoy films that seemingly don’t have much to do with the actual holidays, but are more “holiday adjacent.”\n\nWe’ve all seen and heard the arguments about what makes a movie a Christmas film. Does the whole movie have to take place around Christmas? Should it be about the holiday? Was it a holiday film when it first came out, or did it somehow become one as time went on?\n\nThis week, we each chose a movie that both could and could not be considered a Christmas classic. All three mention Christmas or take place during Christmas, but could be enjoyed at any time of the year. We’re going to learn a little bit about each one and maybe we’ll be able to decide if they are Christmas movies or not!\n\nGremlins\n\nSummary\n\nNYPD cop John McClane goes on vacation to visit his estranged wife Holly in Los Angeles where she works for the Nakatomi Corporation. While they are at the headquarters for a Christmas party, a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber take control of the building and hold everyone hostage. Unable to escape and with no immediate police response, John is forced to take matters into his own hands.\n\nMaking Of\n\nDirected by John McTiernan, Die Hard actually started out as a book called Nothing Lasts Forever. It was written by former police officer Roderick Thorp as a sequel to his previous novel, The Detective. Thorp had been inspired to write Nothing Lasts Forever by a dream he had after watching the 1974 film The Towering Inferno.\n\nScreenwriter Jeb Stuart was in serious financial trouble when Lloyd Levin, the head of development at the Gordon Company, asked to work on an adaptation of the 1978 novel.\n\nBelieve it or not, Levin gave Stuart creative freedom as long as he retained the Christmas-in-Los-Angeles setting. He believed that the concept would provide an interesting aesthetic.\n\nAt the same time, Stuart began working 18-hour days at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, which left him exhausted and \"on edge\". After getting into an argument with his wife, he went for a drive. There was a point where he saw a box in his lane and was unable to avoid it, he was forced to run over it only to discover it was empty. According to Stuart, he pulled over on the side of the freeway with his heart pounding.\n\nFrom this, Stuart conceived a story of a man who should have apologized to his wife before a catastrophe. He returned home to reconcile with his wife and wrote the first 35 pages that night. Once the screenplay was written, it was pitched to studios as \"Rambo in an office building\".\n\nAnother screenwriter Steven E. de Souza ended up rewriting Stuart's script, as he had much more experience in blending action and comedy. He approached the story as if Gruber was the protagonist. He said, \"If [Gruber] had not planned the robbery and put it together, [McClane] would have just gone to the party and reconciled or not with his wife. You should sometimes think about looking at your movie through the point of view of the villain who is really driving the narrative.\"\n\nBecause Die Hard was based on the novel sequel to The Detective, the studio was contractually obligated to offer Frank Sinatra the role. Sinatra, who was 70 at the time, declined, so the role was offered to various major stars including Sylvester Stallone, Richard Gere, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Burt Reynolds, Al Pacino and many more. The prevailing action archetype of the era was a muscle-bound, invincible macho man like Arnold Schwarzenegger, (who was also offered the role). Bruce Willis was known mainly for his comedic role in the romantic comedy television series Moonlighting, starring opposite Cybill Shepherd. He initially declined the role because of Moonlighting, but when Shepherd became pregnant, the show's production was stopped for eleven weeks, giving Willis enough time to take the role. He would find acting in Die Hard difficult because it was so different from his previous experiences. Mostly that he was often alone, not having any others to act with.\n\nSeveral subplots and traits for characters other than McClane were created during the first few weeks of filming because Willis was still working on Moonlighting. He would film the show for up to ten hours and then work on Die Hard at night. These new scenes included Holly's housekeeper, Holly confronting Gruber following Takagi's death, an introductory scene for Thornburg, and more moments between Powell and his fellow police officers.\n\nFilming took place almost entirely in and around Fox Plaza in Century City LA. The building was under construction and was mostly empty, which was perfect for filming. So it was secured with two main conditions: no filming during the day and no damage from explosions.\n\nWhat makes it a Christmas movie?\n\nA Christmas movie should have Christmas music, and Die Hard has a few Christmas classics, from Let it Snow to Run DMC's Christmas in Hollis. There's also Bruce Willis whistling Jingle Bells, while the score often uses actual jingling bells to provide that seasonal vibe.\n\nAs the Let it Snow plays over the end credits, snow is falling. Well not actual snow, as this is L.A., but falling papers from the building that McClane has just spent the past 2 hrs destroying sorta counts.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons is that in 2020, Steven E de Souza, made a compelling case that not only is Die Hard a Christmas movie, Die Hard is MORE of a Christmas movie than the seasonal classic White Christmas. So if the writer says it is, then it’s hard to argue otherwise.\n\nHowever that does not stop people from making said arguments.\n\nWhen you think of traditional Christmas, the usual family-friendly stuff comes to mind. What do most Christmas staples have in common that Die Hard doesn't? For one, none of the classic specials include the intense violence depicted in Die Hard, the main reason for the film's R rating.\n\nIt also lacks any traditional Christmas motifs like Santa Claus, reindeer, elves, snowmen, and even shopping malls.\n\nRegardless of the holiday, Gruber would've gotten some hostages whether it was a Halloween or Thanksgiving party, and the president of the corporation, Joe Tagaki, would've still been present either way. Many argue that one could describe the core plot of this movie without mentioning Christmas at all.\n\nAnd to counter the writer Steven E. de Souza, Bruce Willis disagrees. During his own Comedy Central Roast, Willis ended a speech by proclaiming that \"Die Hard is not a Christmas movie! It's a god damn Bruce Willis movie!\"\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, and Home Alone, are movies that many of us watch every holiday season. They are unquestionably Christmas films, getting us all into the holiday spirit. But when January rolls around, we don’t often see these movies getting a lot of play. That’s possibly the biggest difference between these bona-fide holiday hits and the three films we talked about this week.\n\nGremlins, Bridget Jones’ Diary, and Die Hard are all movies that audiences can enjoy any time of the year, without getting seasonal confusion. But just because these classics focus on topics besides getting the perfect present or surviving yet another holiday season with your frustrating/lovable family, does that mean that they aren’t Christmas films? The truth is, the holidays are hard. Watch any movie that will make your Christmas brighter."
