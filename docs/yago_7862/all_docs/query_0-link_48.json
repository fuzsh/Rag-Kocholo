We are currently writing a book on the topic, and part of the research for this book has been to track down and catalog all of the movies that in some way depict possession and exorcism.\n\nAs of now, we have found at least 112 movies that have been released, are being produced, or are in development. These films, in some way, portray a possession that someone tries to thwart through some exorcism ritual. We also are noting further breakdowns within the exorcism cinema subgenre of films that are based on true stories, display a found footage approach, or are comedies.\n\nIf you know of a movie from some time period and some country that is not on this list, then please provide the information in the comments section. NOTE: I cannot easily edit this table, so any new additions mentions in the comments will be recorded and added to the final filmography list we are compiling. If you would like to see that list, then please contact me."
