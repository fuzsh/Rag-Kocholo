The troubled cleric goes to the archbishop, a politically ambitious man who, is reluctant to allow an exorcism, fearing American's will scorn Catholics. As the child's demonic possession worsens, the Church relents, and allows the priest to perform the arcane ritual... the only documented exorcism performed by the Catholic Church in the United States."
