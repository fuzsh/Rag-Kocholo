Then therapy finds she’s a personal nurse, involved with Van Heflin, Raymond Massey and a debuting Gerald Brooks – is this a quadrangle? 35mm. Approx. 108 min.\n\nHUMORESQUE\n\nSHOWTIMES\n2:40, 7:20\n\nURGENT TEXT\nDirected by Jean Negulesco\n\n(1946) “Bad manners… the infallible sign of talent!” snipes relentlessly “talent”-hunting, thrice-divorced socialite Joan Crawford to rough-edged, up-from-nothing violin virtuoso John Garfield. Tormented love ensues, to the tune of 23 classical works (dubbed by Isaac Stern), with a final sacrifice courtesy of Wagner. Based on the Fannie Hurst novel. 35mm. Approx. 125 min.\n\nQUOTES\n“Producing it, [Producer Jerry Wald] had tried to keep Crawford’s image ordinary — he wanted plainer clothes and fewer boxed shoulders — then somehow Joan’s eyes just made the shoulders grow.”\n– David Thomson, Warner Bros: The Making of an American Movie Studio",
