        "text": "\"Those things don't happen to wives.\"\n\nThough it begins promisingly enough with a lively tracking shot of factory laborers pouring into the street at the end of a working day, eventually Clarence Brown's Possessed reveals itself to be—like the majority of early talkies I've seen—so wooden and stationary that it would make an exemplary paperweight; as a film, however, it's nondescript and sluggish (despite its crisp seventy-seven minute run time). The film marks the third of eight pairings between established star Joan Crawford and future star Clark Gable (whose major breakthrough would come three years later in Frank Capra's It Happened One Night). Adapted for the screen by Lenore J. Coffee, Possessed has its basis in Edgar Selwyn's 1920 Broadway…\n\n“I like women who know what they want. Sometimes I can help them get it.”\n\nFrom Erie to NYC. Social climbing, clock-punching era Joanie: working at the paper box factory, pining for escape, turning down proposals, not content with “happiness on an installment plan.”\n\nMarion (Crawford) gets a taste of the high life during a chance encounter drinking champagne at the railroad tracks with a silly, queer-coded New Yorker (Richard Gallagher). Not coy about her intentions in landing a rich man, she follows him to the big city, snags Gable’s handsome savior (or does he snag her?) and we immediately get a three year time jump where Marion is now confidently ordering off the French menu, holding court at the…\n\nDid you know that Clark Gable and Joan Crawford made 8 movies together? Did you know when they filmed their first movie together Gable was an unknown and Crawford was a star....and by the time they finished their 8th movie....Gable was a superstar and Crawford was fading fast? Did you know Crawford starred in two movies named Possessed and that they have nothing to do with each other? Ok trivia time is over.\n\nPossessed is one of the better Gable/Crawford movies that I have seen. Crawford plays a country girl who heads to New York City. Once there she finds Gable.....who does not want to marry her but is willing to support her. A interesting movie...that bounces around many censored…\n\nIt's been so long since I last saw the MGM romantic drama Possessed that it feels like the very first time. Without realizing it, the film made the ideal companion piece to my last pick, Focus, as they are both stories of ambitious young women eager to hitch their wagon to a star who can teach them about the finer things in life; in this case, small-town factory worker Marian Martin (Joan Crawford) impulsively leaves everything behind to take a chance on New York City one day in 1928, where she immediately meets successful lawyer Mark Whitney (Clark Gable). Marian makes no secret of her blatant golddigging, but when (like Focus) the film zooms forward three years, we see that…"
