The governors have been directed by the Kremlin to transfer funds to the so-called ‘Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics’, facilitating the Russian occupation in attempting to wrest territory from Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian Minister of Justice Konstantin Chuychenko and Deputy Minister of Justice Oleg Sviridenko are also being sanctioned today. The pair are suppressing their own people by targeting those speaking out against the war. They are expanding their power to repress Russian citizens’ freedom of speech by signing a new law that expands the criteria for “foreign agents” to include anyone who the authorities declare to be “under foreign influence”. Those found guilty will be branded as criminals and will be barred from receiving state financing, teaching at state universities, working with minors, or providing expertise on environmental issues.\n\nAlso sanctioned today are Sarvar and Sanjar Ismailov, nephews of major Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov who has close ties to the Kremlin.

One group is responsible for recruiting Syrians to fight in Russia’s war in Ukraine, while the other is supporting the repressive Syrian regime – perpetuating and benefitting from Putin’s agenda of international turmoil.\n\nToday’s sanctions build on the UK’s hard-hitting sanctions package on Russia which includes designations on more than 1,100 individuals and more than 100 entities.
