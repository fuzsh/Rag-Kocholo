Even for foreign currency exchange transactions accepted in Japan, transactions in U.S. dollars involving \"sanctioned persons\" are subject to OFAC regulations, and in such cases, not only the transaction in question but also subsequent transactions may be hindered, such as being restricted by foreign banks.\n\nUnder some sanctions programs, such as Iran sanctions, Foreign Financial Institutions (including banks located in Japan), non-U.S. companies (Japanese companies, etc.), and individuals who have no contact with the U.S. may be prohibited from accessing the U.S. foreign currency exchange market, importing goods (into the U.S.), and trading property in the U.S. as part of secondary sanctions. As part of secondary sanctions, you may be prohibited from accessing the U.S. foreign exchange market, restricted from importing goods (into the U.S.), or prohibited from trading in goods (property) in the U.S., and may be designated as a \"sanctioned person\".
