Separatist-held territory has seen particularly high inflation as food and other supplies are at times unable to enter the area due to heavy fighting.\n\nHowever, Pushilin said that the multi-currency system is temporary, until a long-term currency for the separatist holdout can be selected.\n\n\"This is a temporary measure until it becomes clear what our future is — [to remain] within the hryvna zone, or if it becomes necessary to look for other options,\" RIA Novosti reported."
