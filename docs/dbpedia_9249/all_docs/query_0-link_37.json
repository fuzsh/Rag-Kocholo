Early civilizations include Pyu city-states and the Mon kingdoms. The Bamar people arrived in the ninth century and Burmese culture became dominant in the region. The Taungoo dynasty ruled in the sixteenth century. The British took control from the Konbaung dynasty in the nineteenth century after three Anglo-Burmese wars. It gained independence from Britain in 1948. Myanmar has suffered from a long, ongoing civil war fraught with ethnic strife."
