        "text": "Legendary Kingdoms\n\n3325 BC-1483 BC - 1st Danyawaddy Dynasty - According to ancient Arakanese chronicles, the first Arakanese kings were Indo-Aryans from the Ganges Valley. The first of these kings is believed to have been King Marayu, who was said to have founded the first Dhanyawaddy City in 3325 BC.\n\n1483 BC-580 BC - 2nd Danyawaddy Dynasty - In 1483 BC, King Kan Raza Gri was said to have founded the second Dhanyawaddy City, which served as the royal capital until 580 BC.\n\nTagaung Kingdom - 850 BC - 600 BC - Tagaung is said be the very first capital of Burma according to the adage Myanmar asa Tagaung ga (Myanmar starts from Tagaung), and it was the ancient capital of the Pyu, who were the forerunners of the Burmese people.\n\nBC 603-1050 AD Thuwunna Bonmi (Ramanya) Thaton City State The first identifiable civilization in what later became Burma is that of the Mon. The Mon probably began migrating into the area in about 300 BC, and their first kingdom Suwarnabhumi, was founded around the port of Thaton in about 300 BC, located in southern Myanmar near Beelin, at the foot of Mount Kaylartha.\n\n580 BC-326 AD - 3rd Danyawaddy Dynasty - The third Dhanyawaddy City, the ruins of which survive to this day, dates to the period between 580 BC-326 AD, making it the center one of Southeast Asia's earliest civilizations.\n\n483 BC - 95 AD - Prome Dynasty - The central kingdoms of Prome and Toungoo appear to have been, respectively, merely a very early dynasty and a comparatively recent off shoot from the kingdom of Burma, into which they were subsequently again merged. The Prome dynasty was established at Thare Kettara by Maha Thambawa, in 483 BC, and terminated with the death of Thu Pinya in 95 AD, shortly after which a new dynasty was founded at Pagan, in 108 AD, by Thamakdarit.\n\n187-1044 - Pyu Kingdom - Pyu city states were small and sparsely populous, they often faced the aggression and invasion of the peoples of the neighboring areas. The technique of rice planting had already been well established within the Pyu era of old Myanmar.\n\nAD 327-957 - Chandra Dynasty - A state, or collection of states, was established as early as the fourth century AD in what is now Ardan State (formerly Arakan State), facing the Bay of Bengal. The Ardanese were related to the Burmans of Upper Burma and had, because of their location on the cost, close maritime relation with India.\n\n573-781 - Mon Kingdom - By the ninth century AD the nations had consolidated themselves - the Burmans in the greater part of what is now Upper Burma; the Mon on the Lower Irrawaddy, the Sittang, and the Salween; while the Khmer were at the height of their power, with magnificent towns and temples in Cambodia. A number of Mon cities flourished, among them Thuwannabhumi (Suvannabhumi, \"Land of Gold\") of the Mons [825-1043].\n\n976-1404 - Arakan State - A state, or collection of states, was established as early as the fourth century AD in what is now Ardan State (formerly Arakan State), facing the Bay of Bengal. The Ardanese were related to the Burmans of Upper Burma and had, because of their location on the cost, close maritime relation with India.\n\n1431-1783 - Arakan State - In 1785, the Rakhine / Arakan kingdom whose capital was Mrauk-U, founded by Minsawmun (1430-1433) in 1430, and which had a line of 49 kings reigning from 1430 to 1785, was made part of the Konbaung kingdom.\n\n1486-1550 - TaungNgoo / Taungoo Dynasty - Survivors of the destruction of Innwa eventually established a new kingdom centered on Taungoo in central Myanmar in 1531 led by Tabinshwehti (reigned 1531-50), who once again unified much of Myanmar.\n\n1599-1752 - Nyaung Yan Dynasty - From 1599, when the Nyaung Yan Min, a younger son of Bayin Naung, ascended the throne of the \"king of kings,\" the dynasty reigned at Ava, and at Pegu, holding sway throughout the whole of the present province, with the exception of Arakan. Following the break-up of the Hanthawady Empire, Nungyan (1598-1606) established a new Myanmar kingdom, and ten kings reigned in Inwa from 1598 to 1752. The most famous of the Inwa kings, Thalun (1629-1648) built the Kaunghmudaw Pagoda near Sagaing. A rebellion which started in Pago led to the downfall of the kingdom in 1752."
