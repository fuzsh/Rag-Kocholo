        "text": "Myanmar’s population is about 54.4 million people, making it the 26th-most populous country in the world. Myanmar’s largest city is Yangon, also known as Rangoon. Yangon was Myanmar’s capital until 2006 and has about 5.15 million residents, almost 10% of Myanmar’s total population. Mandalay, with 1.3 million people, is the country’s second-most populous city and the only other city with a population above 1 million. Thirty-one other cities have populations above 20,000. Some of Myanmar’s fastest-growing cities are Hakha, Myitkyina, and Taunggyi, all of which have grown over 130% since 1993.\n\nMyanmar also has very large towns, four of which have populations over 100,000. Lashio is the country’s largest town, with about 144,000 people. About 236 Myanmar towns have populations of over 5,000 people."
