The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people,the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant.The thousand-year period,often referred to as the Pyu millennium,linked the Bronze Age to the beginning of the classical states period when the Pagan Kingdom emerged in the late 9th century.",
