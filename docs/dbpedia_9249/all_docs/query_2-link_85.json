        "text": "Pyu Ancient Cities – Heritage in Myanmar\n\nPyu Ancient Cities includes the remains of three brick, walled and protected cities of Halin, Beikthano and Sri Ksetra. They reflect the Pyu Kingdoms that flourished for over 1,000 years between 200 bc and AD 900. The three cities arepartly excavated archeologic sites. Remains include excavated palace citadels, burial grounds and manufacture sites, also as monumental brick Buddhist stupas, partially standing walls and water management features – some still in use – that underpinned the organized intensive agriculture. In 2014, listed in unesco Heritage list.\n\nThe Pyu Ancient Cities providethe earliest testimony of the introduction of Buddhism into Southeast Asianearly twothousand years ago and the attendant economic, socio-political and cultural transformations that resulted in the rise of the first, largest, and longest-lived urbanised settlements of the region up until the 9th century.\n\nThese earliest Buddhist city-states playeda seminal role in themethod of transmission the literary, architecturaland ritual traditions of Pali-based Buddhism to alternative societies within the sub-region wherever they continue tobe practiced up to the present.\n\nHalin, Beikthano and Sri Ksetra togetheras a Serial Property put togethertestify to the many aspects of the development of this new model of urban settlement for the Southeast Asian region. Along the three cities giveevidence for the whole sequence and range of Pyu urban transformation from ca. 2nd century BCE to the 9th century ce, Buddhist monastic communities, distinctive mortuary apply, skilled water management, and long distant trade.\n\nTechnological innovations in resource management, agriculture and producingof brick and iron at the Pyu Ancient Cities created the preconditions resulting inimportant advances in urban coming up with and building construction. These innovations resulted within the rise of the three earliest, largest, and most long Buddhist urban settlements altogether of geographic area. The Pyu cities’ urban morphology set a replacement templet of extended urban format characterised by large gated walls encircled by moats; a network of roads and canals linking urban house within the walls with in depth areas of outside development, containing civic amenities, monumental spiritual structures outlinedby towering stupas and sacred water bodies.\n\nThe authenticityof the Pyu Ancient Cities is to be found within thefine arts form and style of unaltered and still-standing monumental structures and urban precincts.\n\nThe best time to visit Myanmar is from November to February so what are you waiting for book your trip with Myanmar tour operator and enjoy MYANMAR!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nPublished by exploringtourism123\n\nView all posts by exploringtourism123"
