Synopsis

This latest addition to the successful Second World War Battleground Europe Series describes the fierce campaign, codenamed INFATUATE, mounted in November 1944 to clear the way through to the port of Antwerp. This was a vital task as the Allies lacked sufficient port facilities to provide for the increasing quantities of war supplies required as the advance eastwards took them closer to Germany. There was a danger of lines of communication becoming over-extended. A leading role was played by British Royal Marine commandos but all who took part in both D Day and this landing regarded the former as a picnic! As the book vividly describes, the Germans fought with extraordinary courage against overwhelming odds and refused to surrender although all must have known defeat was inevitable. The winter weather was another major problem and the terrain was extremely difficult.
