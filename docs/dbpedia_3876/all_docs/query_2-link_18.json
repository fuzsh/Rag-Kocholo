Philip is a teacher and served in the NZ and British Army Reserves. He is also the Reservist representative on the Committee of the Royal Engineers Historical Society. He has been a battlefield guide since 2003 - most of it with the British Army. Philip will be talking about the 79th Armoured division in the 1944 Scheldt Estuary Campaign and especially Operation Infatuate. His MA thesis found that a lot of the 79th's workload was actually borne by RE/RCE Field companies instead. This will be a great examination of specialised armour and engineer units working side by side in this very interesting campaign.",
