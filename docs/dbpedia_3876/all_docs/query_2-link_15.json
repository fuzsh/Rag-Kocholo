        "text": "This is the kind of work where you’re happy you’ve invested in a good-quality guillotine tool:\n\n22 triangles of 6 mm along the two right-angled sides. I cut a strip, 6 mm wide, and then used the tool to cut it at 45-degree angles from two sides. Glueing them in place was actually the hardest bit, because it’s difficult to hold them in place while trying to get the glue on them I put them just behind the frames, though I’m not 100% sure that’s correct: I still can’t tell which direction the cross-section view in the drawings actually looks in But on the real boat, these were nailed to the frames to reinforce the corners, so they were either in front or behind them.\n\nHere is what’s wrong with the bow ramp:\n\nOn the real thing, the ramp is 2 feet 11 inches, or 35 inches, high, which makes things easy for us: 1 inch, or 25.4 mm on the model. Gecko has made the opening for it 28 mm already (the top of the ramp should be where the seam is between the hull and the deck), and if you measure the kit’s ramp part (C1), it’s 28 mm as well — when the real ramp of course overlapped the hull to provide a watertight seal. From the real construction drawings, the opening should be 24 mm high in 1:35 scale.\n\nThe red line in the photo is where the bottom edge of the ramp should be, and the blue line indicates the correct location of the bottom of the opening in the hull. Now for the tricky bit, can you actually fit the forward passage floor so that it meets up with the height of this blue line?\n\nYes, you can. The red line here is the floor at its correct height, while the blue lines indicate the fully open door, which of course needs to clear the floor. (The plastic card strip on the floor represents the lower section of the armoured doors, which hinged down. This is 4 mm high in 1:35 scale, so the lower blue line is at that height above where the strip would hinge.)\n\nI think I shall be constructing yet another front floor …\n\nThanks If I’m honest, I think this is probably medium-grade scratchbuilding. Nearly all of it is flat plates and strip without difficult shapes, intricate bits or very fine parts — as opposed to the sort of work people like @scottie3158 or @Scratchbuilder habitually do, and which I don’t see myself pulling off\n\nThe next bit here was the side benches in the troop compartment. Early boats had open, slatted benches here, which Gecko provides for all three positions (there is to be a bench in the middle too). Later, the side benches were replaced by enclosed ones which were filled with buoyant material. (Some photos show boats that have such a bench in the middle too, or only the central bench like that, with slatted ones along the sides.) In 1:35 scale, all of these are about 5 mm high and 6.5 mm wide.\n\nAn enclosed bench is easy enough if you use Gecko’s floor: just cut two strips of plastic card, set one vertically on the floor where the bench is, and glue the other on the top in a Γ shape — this because you can’t see the outer side, so you don’t need to bother fitting it, except maybe a little bit for support at the front and back.\n\nHowever, my floor curves like the real one, and cutting a plastic strip to follow that curve is rather tricky. Thinking about this problem, I hit on the idea of square tube, but as I mentioned, the bench is wider than it’s tall, so that doesn’t work either. And then I happened across 6.4 by 3.2 mm rectangular tube After buying a pack and cutting a section to length for the bench, I curved it to follow the floor (just pulling it over the edge of the workbench, plus a little pushing and pulling with my fingers). Next, I cut two strips from plastic card, 0.75 mm and 1 mm thick and about 6 mm wide.\n\nTo actually fit the bench, I glued one strip to the floor, making sure its visible edge was in the right location. Then the other one on top of it, followed by the tube to get a nice, square upper side, again taking care to line up the visible side.\n\nYou can still see the lamination here, but that’s OK, some filler will take care of that:\n\nThat just needs to be sanded smooth once it’s dry.\n\nI have been following this from the cheap seats Jakko. Too warm to sit in your upstairs and watch for this old guy......\n\nWhat I really enjoyed the most, is you bought this kit with a fantastic and historical idea for it....But, let's look at the facts here......\n\nYou buy a kit, open the box, check the parts, take a good look at some references, break out the ruler, start measuring the dimensions, realize the kit is a total dud in that area, close the box after cutting the hull off the sprue and then scratch the rest of the build, using the boxtop pic and your references, as the kit parts are all wrong!!!...Respect Jakko, and you are doing one heck of a job on this Sir!!!...\n\nAnd I thought I was Mad!!!...\n\nProst\n\nAllen"
