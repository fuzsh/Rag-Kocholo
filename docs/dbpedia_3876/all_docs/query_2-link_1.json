        "text": "Operation Infatuate, Walcheren - 1 to 8 November 1944.\n\nThe landing that gave Allied shipping access to Antwerp docks\n\nBackground\n\nOperation Infatuate, the codename for the invasion of the Dutch Island of Walcheren, was a major Combined Operation's amphibious landing against entrenched German defensive positions. The fortified island stood at the mouth of the River Scheldt blocking Allied access to the captured port of Antwerp some 60 kilometres inland. It was urgently needed to supply the advancing Allied armies as they moved towards Berlin.\n\n[Map courtesy of Google Map Data 2017.]\n\nThe city of Antwerp and its port had fallen to Dempsey's 2nd British Army in early September 1944. Montgomery's attention at the time was on securing several bridge crossings, including the Rhine at Arnhem, in an operation code-named Market Garden. It held the prospect of shortening the war by opening a clear route to Germany and Berlin. There was, consequently, no priority given to securing the approaches to Antwerp, which would require the island fortress of Walcheren to be neutralised. Its formidable array of weaponry was garrisoned by the Fifteenth German Army.\n\nThe First Canadian Army, under Crerar, was ordered by Montgomery to open up the Antwerp area but Crerer also had orders to capture Boulogne and Calais. His forces did advance north-westwards from Antwerp and approached Walcheren but were held up at the entrance of the narrow isthmus, which connected south Beveland to the mainland. [See 'The Calagary Highlanders' below for more information on this action.]\n\nPlans and Preparations\n\nWith the failure of Market Garden, Montgomery issued a directive on the 9/10/1944 giving priority to opening the River Scheldt to Allied shipping. Some 10 days later the Canadians began attacking along the isthmus breaking into the Breskens pocket. By the end of the month the Germans had been cornered in Zeebrugge, surrendering on November 2. Both south and north Beveland had been virtually cleared and the time was right for the assault of Walcheren itself. Operation Infatuate was activated.\n\nA three pronged assault was planned with Commandos landing at Westkapelle in the west of the island and at Flushing in the south. The Canadians were to cross by a water channel close to the causeway in the east. However, it soon became clear that the tidal flats around the water channel were virtually impassable, leaving the Canadians with the exceedingly hazardous option of a direct assault along the well defended causeway - an exposed stretch about 30/40 yards wide and 1200/1500 yards long. The Canadians were to establish a bridgehead on the island through which the British 52nd Lowland Division would pass to continue the assault. Against much scepticism and opposition, General Simonds' plan to breach the island's dykes and flood the interior was adopted.\n\n[Photo; Landing craft tanks (LCTs) carrying Royal Marine Commandos to their landing beach on the island of Walcheren at Westkapelle, the most western point of the island.

The brigade had trained for this assault in the Ostend area during October.\n\nThe bombing of Walcheren in October, by RAF Bomber Command, had breached the dykes around the island turning it into a massive lagoon, rimmed by long stretches of intact dykes. German gun emplacements on the unaffected areas, virtually provided a continuous fortification bristling with guns of every calibre.\n\nThe Marines placed great reliance on Weasel and Buffalo LTs for transport to the landing areas. The RM Commandos were to seize the shoulders of the gap in the dyke and then to fan out north and south to roll up the remainder of the German defences by linking up with the southern thrust. The RAF provided air support and the 79th Armoured Division provided naval gunfire support, including Landing Craft Gun (Medium) and multiple-rocket launch systems. After some debate over the sea conditions, the operation was planned for November 1. No 4 Commando landed at 0545 hours and the remainder at 1000 hours.\n\nOn the day of the assault, a heavy mist over the Dutch and Belgian airfields limited RAF support for the actual landings, although the skies over Walcheren itself were clear. No 4 Commando, under Lt-Colonel Dawson DSO, had a problem in finding a suitable place to disembark. Dawson sent a small reconnaissance party (known as Keepforce) ashore in two LCPs. They were followed by Nos 1 and 2 troops, who secured the beachhead with minimal casualties and soon began to take prisoners. The main body came in at 0630 hours but, by this time, the Germans were totally alert and opened heavy fire with machine guns and 20mm cannon. Despite this, the Marines landed with only two or three casualties, although the LCA containing the heavier equipment, including 3 inch mortars, hit a stake and sank 20 yards off shore but the mortars were successfully salvaged.\n\nThe marines now fought their way through the German strong-points. Unfortunately, the need to leave rearguards against infiltration, hindered progress. However, despite losing two LCAs to heavy enemy gun fire, the leading battalion of 155 Brigade began to land at 0830 hours which immediately improved the situation.\n\nGerman prisoners were pressed into service, unloading stores and supplies. A good proportion of them were poor quality troops, many of whom suffered from stomach complaints. Curiously, however, their defence positions were well stocked with food and ammunition. By 1600 hours, the Commandos had reached most of their objectives and decided to consolidate, as the day drew to a close.\n\nBrigadier Leicester's plan, for the attack on Westkapelle, called for three troops of No 41 (RM) Commando, under Lt-Colonel E C E Palmer RM, to land on the north shoulder of the gap blown in the dyke. The objective was to clear the area between there and the village of Westkapelle. The remainder of the Commando, along with the two No 10 (IA) Commando troops, would then come ashore in Weasels and Buffalos launched from LCTs. Their mission would be to clear Westkapelle and then move north. No 48 (RM) Commando, under Lt-Colonel J L Moulton DSO, would use the same methods but come ashore south of the gap. From there, they would advance on Zoutelande, two miles to the south. Finally, No 47 (RM) Commando, under Lt-Colonel CF Phillips DSO, would land behind No 48 and to meet up with No 4 Commando near Flushing.\n\n[Photo; The occupation of Walcheren Island is going fast.

The Commandos then moved north along the dyke.\n\nNo 48 also encountered a battery of 150mm guns. The leading troop commander was killed and several men wounded in an attack on the position. In response to another assault on the gun emplacements, the enemy released an enfilade of intense mortar fire. Supporting fire from field batteries in the Breskens area, together with Typhoon attacks, considerably softened up the battery allowing another troop, under cover of smoke, to reach the centre of the battery, putting it out of action.\n\nThe next day, No 4 Commando, together with 5 King's Own Scottish Borderers, continued with the battle for Flushing. No.5 (French) Troop were involved in an action against a strongpoint nicknamed Dover. One section of the troop gained the roof of a cinema and opened fire on the strongpoint with their PIAT. The other sections moved along the street and through back gardens. As the troop was preparing for the final assault, Typhoons attacked the enemy position. That afternoon, the Troop resumed their advance and reached the corner overlooking their objective. One house remained occupied by the Germans and, as they made for the strongpoint, they suffered several casualties from the fire of No 5 Troop. No 1 Section was now by the Anti-Tank wall and firing PIAT bombs into the embrasures of the strongpoint at very short range. Corporal Lafont was on the point of breaching the strongpoint with a made-up charge at the ready, when the German defenders surrendered.\n\nNo 48 (RM) Commando pushed on at first light and took Zouteland, meeting only light opposition. No 47 took over the advance but soon came up against a strong fortified position with an anti-tank ditch and huge 'Dragon's Teeth'. The weather had closed in and no air support was available, so they attacked supported only by artillery fire. They also came under heavy mortar fire and suffered several casualties.\n\n[Photo; Royal Marine Commandos going down the ramp of a landing craft tank in an Alligator amphibious personnel carrier, whilst some more men in a Weasel amphibious carrier are about to follow.

Their approach was obstructed by pockets of resistance, which were not cleared until nightfall. The three Troops halted in front of the battery and received much-needed food and ammunition before they repulsed a German counter-attack.\n\nDefensive stakes and mines, embedded in the base of the dyke, made it difficult for supply craft to land stores. By the third and fourth days, the Commando were forced to 'endure' captured German rations. To the relief of all concerned, supplies were parachuted in on the fifth day near Zouteland.\n\nNo 41 and No 10 Commandos reached Domburg on the morning of D+1, where they encountered strong resistance. That evening, Brigadier Leicester ordered No 41, less one Troop, to assist No 47 in the south, leaving the Troops of No 10 and one of No 41 to finish mopping up Domburg. No 4 Commando was relieved by 155 Brigade and embarked on LVTs to assault two batteries, W3 and W4, situated north-west of Flushing. They had been fighting for 40 hours and needed a short break for rest and recuperation. After landing in a little known gap in the dyke, Lt-Colonel Dawson secured relief of 24 hours for his men from Brigadier Leicester, however, it was well after dark before the Commando was relieved by 155 brigade. In the event, No 47 (RM) Commando overcame the opposition south of Zouteland later that day and linked up with No 4 Commando. Meanwhile, No 10 and the Norwegians cleared Domburg, showing particular courage in the face of heavy opposition, which cost them a number of casualties.\n\n[Photos l -r: (1) Amphibians (Buffalos) coming ashore at Westkapelle; (2) Oranjemolen (Orange Mill) at Flushing (Vlissingen) where No. 4 Commando landed early on 1/11/44; (3) French Commando Officers in Flushing - Lt.

They landed in a gap left in the dyke by RAF Bombers a few months earlier. Click here.\n\nThe Outcome\n\nNos 4, 47 and 48 Commandos then regrouped at Zouteland and a two-day pause ensued while they re-supplied. The remaining enemy resistance was concentrated in the area north-west of Dombug. Nos 4 and 48 Commando set off on foot, although they used LVs to cross the gap at Westkapelle, in order to reinforce No 10 and No 41. While No 41 assaulted the last remaining battery, W19, No 4 cleared the Overduin Woods and pushed on to Vrouwenpolder opposite North Beveland. No.48 remained in reserve. This phase of the operation began on November 8.\n\n[Photo; Lt./General Wilhelm Daser, Commander of the 70th Infantry Division & Fortress Commander of Walcheren, led into captivity accompanied by Major John Knox, Brigade Major Royal Artillery of the 52nd Lowland Division.]\n\nAt 0815, four Germans approached the Allied troops to ask for a surrender of all remaining German troops in the area. After some negotiation, 40,000 Germans surrendered. No 4 SS Brigade had lost 103 killed, 325 wounded and 68 missing during eight days of fighting. By the end of November, after a massive minesweeping operation of the Scheldt, the first cargoes were being unloaded at Antwerp.\n\nOrganisation of Forces\n\nFull details of the opposing forces are provided below courtesy of Mr J N Houterman, Middelburg, Walcheren.

Rifle Platoon Leader, 9 Platoon, \"D\" Company of the Calgary Highlanders - a replacement for my predecessor, Lt. Stewart, who was killed on the Causeway right at its entrance on to the Island.\n\nIt was a battered, depleted Platoon I took over. They had been in hard fighting right from the time the push to clear the Scheldt estuary first started. I was saddled with a legacy of nine \"ghosts,\" - men who should have been with me but were absent and unaccounted for. I was ordered to find out from the survivors where and when these missing men had last been seen, and in what circumstances. I was able to report very few facts and those I could were painful. When I went up to join the Highlanders I was accompanied by two other 'new' lieutenants, also replacing casualties of the assault on Walcheren. Their names were Brown, and Doakes, as I remember. We were along the southern edge of what became known as The 'Nijmegen Salient' which the Allies established as a fall-back from the Arnhem failure. There in early December, outside Groesbeek, on the edge of the Reichswald Forest, I was wounded on patrol. Brown was killed, shot in the kidneys by a sniper, and Doakes died of Diphtheria in a hospital somewhere in Holland.\n\nSojourning at Aldershot, awaiting orders to return to the Continent, was a friend from the Highlanders who had been wounded on the Causeway before I had caught up to him. He recounted to me that his Company (\"A\") had lost all their Officers. The causeway was 30 yards wide, about 1 mile long, straight and barren. Facing the 5th Brigade were dug-in fixed-fire machine guns and Oerlikon Rapid-firing 20mm Anti- Aircraft Cannons, the belts of which carried cartridges in a fixed order of 1 armour-piercing shell, 1 high explosive shell and 1 tracer. The troops of the 5th Brigade had no advance knowledge of this lethal mix but they soon knew what they were facing! It took a high calibre of men to run the gauntlet of the withering fire in such an exposed situation. It's not surprising that the Infantryman's unofficial motto was 'It aint our business to die for our country; our job is to make the other guy die for his country!'\n\nHe, with his men, had moved about six-hundred yards off the Causeway onto the Island when they were pinned down. It had been decided that the 5th Brigade was done for and would be replaced. Accordingly, at dawn of the 1st (or 2nd?) November an artillery barrage was to be laid on, behind which their exchange with the Maisonneuves would be carried out. It is difficult for those who have not experienced the chaos and confusion of war to appreciate that in a battle the situation changes by the minute. They had no radio or telephonic communication and runners often did not make it through. The big shots directing the operation did not know how far forward the Highlanders had fought their way onto the island and the barrage came down BEHIND them! They had to retire through the \"protective\" barrage to rendezvous with their replacements. It was winter and the Highlanders were wearing their greatcoats. In the semi-darkness of the dawn, the advancing Maisonneuve mistook the retiring Highlanders as a German attack. One of the men I took into my unit later told me that as he was emerging from the smoke of the barrage, he found himself facing troops with fixed bayonets attacking him! There it was; darkness, smoke, language differences, troops in unexpected places. In a split second he had to decide: is it going to be him or me? Him! So he opened up with his Sten gun. Canadians killing Canadians!\n\nLife had to go on, and so did the war. When these men, all volunteers, were signing-up they did so for 'the duration.' There was no resigning or quitting; you were in it until you were dead, crippled, or until, in some unforeseeable future event, the war was won (or lost!) There was one slim chance of an out - if you had been wounded three times you could elect to go home to Canada for thirty days; but who could have stood the thought of coming back to Europe? Nobody!... so nobody I knew took advantage of this option.\n\nIt is painful to study the big military picture leading up to the very desperate frontal assault on Walcheren by the 2nd Division's 5th Brigade, primarily the Regiment de Maisonneuve and the Calgary Highlanders. Painful because it seems clear that its purpose was diversionary: to draw onto themselves enemy forces and fire which otherwise would have been available to the German 70th Infantry Division to oppose the landings by the British 52nd Lowland Division and various British Commando Units.\n\nAs the storming of the Sloe Causeway got stuck the diversionary operation \"Mallard\" was carried out, crossing the Sloe by wading and storm boats. Here (photo opposite) you see German POWs and wounded brought back. Storm boats can be seen in the background.\n\nTo gain access to the Port of Antwerp was essential to the further success of Shaef operations and as the Brigadier said (at an \"O\" Group meeting of all senior officers of the 5th Brigade, who were questioning General Simonds' determination to proceed with such an obviously difficult and potentially costly operation) the risk had been thoroughly evaluated, and in view of the larger military picture, had been considered acceptable. I have seen figures which show Highlander casualties as 63, of which 17 were killed.\n\nThe Dutch people recently showed their sincere gratitude for what the Canadian Army did for them. At an anniversary commemoration service, for the Walcheren action, the King (or Crown Prince) of Holland spoke these gracious words:\n\nThank you Canada! Thank you Canadians, from the bottom of our hearts!'\n\nPersonal memories of Pete\n\nI was a telegraphist or 'sparker' in the Walcheren (Westkapelle) landing as part of a Forward Observation Unit for naval gunfire. Each unit consisted of an Artillery Captain known as the FOB (forward observer bombardment), his bombardier and three naval telegraphists carrying backpack radios. When the bombarding ships opened fire the FOB and his bombadier plotted the fall of the shot and calculated corrections which we transmitted by Morse code to the ships. We trained in an area about 9 miles east of Ostend since the extensive sand dunes and scrub-land were similar to parts of Walcheren. Our unit was housed in modern buildings in what may have been a holiday area.\n\nWe were attached to the Marine Commandos and trained with them. They were very professional and disciplined. On the eve of the operation, they paraded in the morning with their webbing scrubbed, then paraded later in the day with their webbing 'blancoed' to the correct shade of khaki! To cap it all they marched the nine miles to Ostend to embark when other units were carried in vehicles.\n\nOur unit was allocated a small amphibious vehicle called a Weasel to disembark with our equipment onto the beach at Westkapelle. When we boarded our Landing Craft Tank (LCT) at Ostend we found the Weasels arranged in a line along each side of the tank deck with the much larger and heavier amphibious Buffalos in the centre line between them. The Buffalos were partially armoured and could carry several men and cargo. This particular arrangement of Weasels and Buffalos later proved to have life and death implications.\n\nWe sailed late in the day on October 31st 1944 to make the fairly short voyage to Walcheren. During the night there were rumours that we were passing enemy coastal batteries but I believe that the Canadians had put them out of action. In any event they gave us no trouble. We were due to land with a follow up wave and so were a mile or two behind the main assault craft and troops. However, any thoughts that this would make for a 'cushy' landing were soon dispelled.\n\n[Photo; Taken close to the Marine Commandos coming down from the Westkapelle beachhead. This image shows German prisoners in a Prisoner of War cage. © IWM (BU 1280).]\n\nWe watched as LCG(L)s and LCG(M)s, fitted with guns, closed in to slog it out with the German coastal batteries ensconced in massive gun emplacements. It was a David and Goliath contest of massive proportions. The bold actions of the landing craft were designed to keep the German batteries busy while the Commandos made for the shore. Even from the distance it was easy to see that these little gun-ships were being pounded but they didn't falter. Their losses were, however, very heavy.\n\nAn LCT(R) rocket craft fired a salvo but it fell short amongst allied craft in forward positions. It looked like mayhem but I believe the losses, though bad, were less severe than they appeared to us. As we watched the flashes from the German batteries we felt disappointment, and a degree of frustration, that our usual air cover was not present. It later transpired that flights were delayed by fog over the airfields. Nevertheless fighter bombers did eventually join the fray by attacking the German defences.\n\nAll this time we were making slow but steady progress towards the shore at the back of a short line of landing craft. Our attention was grabbed when the craft ahead of us was bracketed and hit by shell fire. Soon shells fell abeam of us as our position, direction and speed were plotted by the enemy gunners. I began to climb back into our Weasel for protection and had one foot on the guard rail around the LCT when we were hit. The shell fell into the Buffalo parked alongside our Weasel. Sadly Canadian engineers with packs of explosives were inside.... and we had been chatting with them just a short time earlier. The resultant explosion was contained by the Buffalo which went up in a sheet of flame and saved our Weasel from the worst of the explosion. I was blown onto the catwalk which ran around the LCT. Some men jumped overboard and were carried away on the tide but were recovered by rescue craft.\n\nI made my way to the stern of the craft where the bridge structure provided some shelter from the burning and exploding vehicle. Soon a Buffalo came alongside and took some of us ashore. We headed for the south side of the gap which had been blown in the sea walls (dykes). On shore vehicles were burning, filling the air with black smoke. Wreckage was strewn about all over the place.\n\nBomber Command had earlier breached the dykes and the interior of the island was flooded. Small areas of higher ground were sticking out of the water but Westkapelle village itself was badly inundated. The flooding on the southern side of the gap contained the fighting to a very narrow front only a few hundred yards wide. It was along this narrow strip of dry land that the Commandos faced massive gun emplacements and land mines.\n\nAround this time one of our FOBs and his sparker were wounded by a mortar bomb. The Medical Officer (M.O) was treating them in the crater when a second bomb killed them all. This disproved the old adage about two bombs not falling on the same spot.\n\nThat first night enemy star shells lit up the landing area. Shortly after a Buffalo evacuating casualties made its way across the beach and ran over a mine. It immediately blew up. I will forever remember the desperate cries for help from within. The driver and his mate jumped out burning as they ran to the sea. It was a truly hellish scene made all the worse by the bright flames glowing in the darkness.\n\nNaval supporting fire was good. Our units were able to direct the fire of heavy ships such as the Warspite and the Monitors Erebus and Roberts. The fighting is documented elsewhere but I would like to comment on the spirited manner in which the Commandos took on the massive German emplacements with comparatively light weapons.\n\nWhen we reached Zouteland, a little village down the coast from Westkapelle, we could clearly see the damage we had caused. Compared to Caen it was nothing but to the local population the devastation caused by 15 inch shells was frightening. Despite this the inhabitants were wonderfully welcoming and some of the women wore traditional dress. One Dutchman watched the landing in progress despite the obvious dangers!\n\nOur side on the south of the gap was cleared in a few days and having reached the gap before Flushing our part in the assault was over. We spent some uncomfortable days in a hollow scooped out in the sand with a roof of corrugated iron sheets to keep us dry and relatively safe. Just a few yards away the medics had piled up corpses wrapped in corrugated cardboard bound with string. They were stacked, I have to say, in criss-cross fashion like firewood. It made me think of the cheapness of human life in war conditions. Some German prisoners were nearby in a crater surrounded by barbed wire. They had little shelter and food and they were distinctly unhappy. In reality their conditions were not very different from our own.\n\nAfter eight days an LCM took us off the island. The vagaries of war had one more unpleasant surprise for us. The voyage back to Ostend passed through an exceptionally violent storm. The skipper feared for the safety of his vessel and most of the troops were violently ill. I stayed on deck and remember one soldier lying face down on the very edge of the craft gradually sliding overboard and apparently not caring. I grabbed his webbing and pulled him back inboard.\n\nAs we approached Ostend an air raid was in progress with flak sailing into the sky. The skipper and his bridge party failed to notice a destroyer signalling an Aldiss lamp challenge to 'unknown vessel.' Luckily we understood Morse code and alerted the bridge party. The destroyer might well have opened fire as our craft bore some resemblance to a high speed German motor boat.\n\nOur first night ashore was spent in a German barracks decorated with murals of Storm Troopers. They bore little resemblance to the dejected prisoners occupying the crater on Walcheren! Finally back to the training area and the large dormitory we had occupied there. It was sad to see many beds stripped down because their former occupants would not be returning. Sad also to find that many of our possessions had gone missing in our absence.\n\nI sometimes wonder why, in my recollections, D-Day seemed more exciting and important than Walcheren. Perhaps the reasons are self evident. Walcheren was a landing in bleak November on the shores of the North Sea. It was a necessary and important operation in its own right but D-Day was, in the mind of a young impressionable soldier, the battle to liberate Europe.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWebsites\n\n1.

He successfully completed their arduous training at the Commando Training Centre, Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands joining the ranks of No 4 Commando. He often reminisces about his time in the highlands, running up Ben Nevis's 4412 feet before breakfast!\n\nWe dont get much information from him about his part in the raid on Flushing except that he was in HQ troop, so I assume he provided protection for the HQ officers and their supporting staff. He was billeted in the town of Kortgene with a family and later named his house after the town. He was involved in a raid on an island north of Walcheren, which may have been North Bevelan.\n\nAs No 4 Commando was in the process of running down their numbers after Walcheren, he returned to the UK and joined No 6 commando who were destined for the Far East. The plans changed dramatically when Japan surrendered as a result of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Roy was subsequently sent to Palestine and was demobbed in 1946/47.\n\nWe attended the drumhead ceremony at Portsmouth to stand down the Commandos when he was interviewed by a 'BBC South Today' reporter. He complained bitterly that it was easier to face the enemy's machinegun fire, than speak to the BBC!!\n\nHe is a life time member of the Commando Association and has remained friends with a comrade in arms by the name of Jock. He attended the ceremony at Westminster Abbey when the Queen Mother was presented with the colours and we visited Walcheren for the 60th anniversary commemorations. We're hoping to attend the 75th anniversary commemorations in November 2019.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJerry Henderson\n\nSupport Squadron Eastern Flank (SSEF)\n\nGeoff\n\n70th Anniversary 'Thank You Canada' Liberation Parade, 2015, Toronto, Canada.\n\nHi Geoff\n\nAs Chairman of the St Patrick's Day Parade Society, I was approached by representatives of the Dutch people looking for help in arranging a 70th anniversary \"Thank you Canada\" liberation parade. Its purpose was to publicly acknowledge and commemorate Canada's vital contribution to the liberation of Holland towards the end of WW2 and to remember those who did not return home.\n\nWe were more than happy to support such a worthy cause and soon set the wheels in motion. On the day, veterans, with their families and friends, representatives of the Dutch people and the wider Canadian community, watched the parade roll down the streets of Toronto. It was amazing to see a Sherman tank and other WW2 military vehicles so evocative of the era. The parade was a tremendous success with up 400, 000 on the parade route.\n\nThe small selection of photos below give a sense of what was a most memorable day.

At the moment I have been working through some items to sort out their history for recording purposes and was looking for some images of General Daser when your site popped up so I thought you may be interested in one item I have.\n\nIn the year 2000 I obtained from an ex member of a co 7/9th Royal Scots, Walter Rowland- see his photo, ( then living in Woy Woy on the Central Coast of NSW just north of Sydney Aust), the War flag that had been flying over General Dasers headquarters. Walter wrote down some brief details concerning the flag which I include below.\n\nHope the info is of some interest,\n\nRegards\n\nMark Hansen in Oz\n\nTHE TAKING OF THE FLAG IN HOLLAND IN 1944\n\nThe allies needed a port to bring in supplies in large numbers. They had captured the Port of Antwerp but could not use it until the islands at the mouth of the Scheldt estuary were captured. This task was given to the 52nd Scottish Division under the command of General Hakkewell-Smith. It should also be noted that the division had many other units attached to it. i.e. commandos and many Dutch and Canadian units.\n\nThe 7/9th Royal Scots were given the task of taking Flushing. The headquarters in town was the Hotel Britannia, after some fierce fighting it was captured where Colonel Rheinhard the Commanding officer in Flushing surrended. 600 prisoners were taken.\n\nA Coy 7/9th Royal Scots in which I was a Cpl were given orders to take the town of Middleburg the HQ of the German Commander General Daser. He said he would only surrender to a Colonel. The Coy Commander of A Coy was Major H Johnstone so he promoted himself to a Colonel by putting another pip on his shoulder. He also took the surrender of 2000 prisoners.\n\nMyself and mate Bob Dryburgh took the flag from the two German soldiers as they were lowering it. Major Johnstone was decorated with the Dutch Silver Cross He died in South Africa a few years ago. Bob Dryburgh died tragically in 1989\n\nSigned\n\nWalter Steane Rowland, 3056413 ex Cpl A Coy 7/9th Royal Scots 1939-45\n\n10/12/00\n\nNorwegian Commandos\n\nDear Geoff,\n\nI have read several times your website regarding the Operation Infatuate with great interest. Many thanks for a great site!\n\nI graduated from the Norwegian Military Academy Krigsskolen in 1982 and are now a major (r). I \"left\" the army in 1990 for a civilian career but came back in Feb 2010 in an civilian position. I have a great interest in history as a general and military history especially. I was only a young boy when I first read about the No. 5 Norwegian Troop of 10A and their effort in this Operation Infatuate. One of the Norwegian Officers wrote a book, called \"Groenne Djevler\" (\"Green Devils\") about his service during WWII.\n\nWhen the No 5 Nor Troop came back to Norway May 9th 1945 they got the task to protect the Royal Castle and our Crown Prince Olav, together with forces from the Norwegain Independent Company No.1/SOE (NORCIC 1) the \"Kompani Linge\" (known from Operation: \" Claymore, Antrum, Arquebus, Kitbag, Archer, Anklet, Archery, Cheese, Lark, Anchor, Anvil, Cockerei, Grebe, Mallard, Penguin, Raven, Heron, Swan, Musketoon, Kesterel, Gannet, Carhampton, Chaffinch, Seagull, Martin Red, Vestige I, Company, Lapwing, Woodpecker, Swallow, Grouse, Gunnerside, Delfin, Sunshine\", etc, etc.\n\nOperation Gunnerside: UK National Archive.\n\nUntil the Kings Guard was re-established in 1945, the No 5 Troop together with other picked units guarded the King and his family. Some of the men from this unit was the basis for the new Kings Guard.\n\nOnly some days ago the Dutch Government saluted the only 4 still alive of the Norwegian Walcheren Veterans with the Dutch \"Ridder in de Orde van Oranje-Nassau\" in a ceremony held here in Oslo.\n\nKind regards,\n\nOle-Bernt Wivesoll\n\nAdviser/Team leader\n\nNorwegian Defence Staff\n\n263 Squadron. My mother's cousin, F/Lt D. J. Turner, flew his first Op with 263 Squadron flying Typhoons operating from B70 Deurne to attack the German radar installation at Walcheren on 29-10-1944. Take off was at 16:22 hrs and he landed back at base at 17:22 hrs. The attack must have been around dusk. The Squadron attacked with cannon and strikes were seen on target by the pilots. F/Lt Turner was subsequently killed in action on 26-12-1944 over Windesheim in occupied Holland whilst engaged in an interdiction on the Zwolle to Deventer railway line. I enjoyed your very useful and informative site. Hope this information is of some interest to your readers. (Chris Aspinwall).\n\nFor many decades to come travellers along the A58 will see the name and will remember what happened in WW2 or will be motivated to ask why the viaduct was so named. It is also my way to honour the Scottish victims and all the men who fought and ended the crossing so successfully. With great respect Pro Rail constructed an excellent view-point over the former Mallard area, which is now an industrial area.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nJan H. Wigard,\n\nvan Kleffenslaan 60,\n\n4334 HK Middelburg-Netherlands\n\n26 (Army Co-operation) Squadron RAF\n\nI thought you might be interested to know that 26 (Army Co-operation) Squadron has Walcheren (3-10 to 19-11-1944) as one of its Battle Honours and the word 'Walcheren' is emblazoned on the Squadron Standard. The task of the Squadron was to spot the fall of shot from the various battleships taking part and to direct fire. This required the pilots to fly at very low level for sustained periods which was of course very dangerous. Precise casualties resulting from this operation are not known but were believed to be high. (M Roberts)"
