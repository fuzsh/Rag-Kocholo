        "text": "No.4 Commando, after a daring pre-dawn landing and nearly two days of bitter street fighting, succeeded in capturing the port and most of the town before being relieved by the 52nd Infantry Division. They were thus enabled to rejoin the rest of the Brigade, who without air or artillery support, had made a daylight assault landing at Westkapelle, in the face of heavy enemy fire from the formidable gun emplacements built into the sand dune dykes.\n\nFor three days, without any room for manoeuvre due to the deliberate flooding of the island by the Germans, the RM Commandos frontally attacked and, one by one, captured the heavily defended strong points sited along the crest of the dykes, before successfully linking up with their comrades of No. 4 who had advanced from Flushing.\n\nAfter eight days of continuous action victory was achieved and the enemy surrendered. During the operation the Brigade suffered a total of almost five hundred casualties but they had the satisfaction of knowing that the port of Antwerp was opened and allied supplies were being offloaded by the end of the month.\n\n(Source: Major James Dunning's book When Shall Their Glory Fade.)"
