On the 1st November 1944, I was aboard a landing craft Headquarters, carrying the Deputy Senior Officer of our Assault Group, which was ordered to land troops and take Walcheren Island in the Scheldt Estuary. This was a bloody and costly assault loosing many lives, RM Commandos and Infantry Commandos. Operation “Infatuate” was the last and costliest Combined Operation of the Second World War. On one sector, out of 28 landing craft only FIVE survived touchdown. The grateful Dutch remember it every year, even having their Queen honouring the occasion and inspecting the guard of honour of Veterans. We British sadly ignore the memory of all those heroes who were massacred trying to reach the beaches. In 1954 my wife and I visited Flushing to visit the memorial to the commandos who attacked the guns 10 years before.
