        "text": "John (McTaggart Ellis) McTaggart was, along with F. H. Bradley and a number of other philosophers, one of the most prominent British exponents of neo-Hegelian idealism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most prominent work is The Nature of Existence (in two volumes) from which we will read an excerpt.\n\nMcTaggart’s idealism, like that of Bradley, consisted largely in the denial that what we usually take to be central features of reality are, in fact, real. Accordingly, much of his work was devoted to exposing contradictions, or difficulties, inherent in our ordinary picture of the world. Perhaps his most famous, ambitious, and influential such argument is his argument that our ordinary view that things exist in time is false. This was first systematically presented in his 1908 paper, ‘The Unreality of Time.’ We will be looking at his later (1927) exposition of the argument.\n\n1 The A series and the B series\n\nMcTaggart’s first central claim is that, as he puts it\n\nWe can think of the A and B series as consisting in a group of properties and relations associated with time. We can summarize as follows what McTaggart says about each series, or group of properties:\n\nThe A series\n\nIncludes the properties of being past, present, and future.\n\nIncludes properties which are temporary rather than permanent. If an event is present, it will not always be present.\n\nThe B series\n\nIncludes the properties of being earlier than or later than another event\n\nIncludes properties which are permanent rather than temporary. If A is earlier than B, it always will be.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to get a grip on the two classes of properties is to focus on the fact that some characterizations of temporal properties of events are temporary (A series) and that some are permanent (B series). When we say that, e.g., Tampa Bay won the Stanley Cup in 2004, we are ascribing a property to an event - Tampa’s victory - which that event always has. It will not cease to be true in the future. Thus this kind of dating of events belongs to the B series. If we say that this event had the property of coming later than Montreal’s first Stanley Cup victory, this also attributes a permanent (relational) property to the two events. It will not cease to be true in the future that Montreal’s first Stanley Cup victory came before Tampa’s. Thus the properties of being earlier or later than another event also belong to the B series. But if we say that Tampa’s first Stanley Cup victory is in the past, we do not attribute a permanent property to it. In 2000, this even did not have the property of being past. Hence the properties of being past, present, or future belong to the A series.\n\n2 Why time is contradictory\n\nWe can think of McTaggart’s argument that time is unreal as having the following structure:\n\nThe argument is clearly valid; the question then is whether the premises are true. McTaggart gives arguments for each.\n\n2.1 The A series is essential to the reality of time\n\nCould there be time if there were no properties of being past, present, or future? McTaggart notes (�307) that we never experience time without the A series; but he notes that someone might object that this does not show that time essentially involves the A series, on the grounds that “the distinction of positions in time into past, present, and future, is only a constant illusion of our minds.” (�308). To counter this view, McTaggart gives two arguments why the reality of time requires the properties included in the A series.\n\nThe argument from change\n\nMcTaggart argues that time is impossible without change, and that change essentially involves the A series.\n\nWhy time is impossible without change; the objection that “in ordinary language ...we say that something can remain unchanged through time.” (�309) Why, acccording to McTaggart, change in any object entails change in all objects.\n\nMcTaggart’s argument that change requires an A series:\n\nThe argument from the direction of time\n\nIt is essential to time that it have a direction; but it could not have a direction without the properties of being past, present, and future.\n\n2.2 The A series is contradictory\n\nAt this stage of the argument (�325), McTaggart takes it as established that time cannot be real if there is no A series, and hence no properties of being past, present, or future. The next stage of his argument is to show that these properties involve a contradiction.\n\nThis part of the argument involves two central claims:\n\n(1) “Past, present, and future are incompatible determinations. Every event must be one or the other, but no event can be more than one. If I say that any event is past, that implies that it is neither present nor future, and so with the others.” (�329)\n\n(2) “But every event has them all. If M is past, it has been present and future. If it is future, it will be present and past. If it is present, it has been future and will be past. Thus all three characteristics [of being past, present, and future] belong to each event.” (�329)\n\nThe problem, McTaggart argues, is that (1) and (2) and simply inconsistent. This is why the A series involves a contradiction. If any events are past, present, or future, then both (1) and (2) must be true. But (1) and (2) contradict each other; hence the supposition that events are past, present, or future involves a contradiction.\n\nMcTaggart has already argued that time essentially involves the A series properties of being past, present, and future; his conclusion that these properties involve a contradiction then licenses the further conclusion that the supposition that time is unreal involves a contradiction.\n\n3 Responses to the argument\n\n3.1 Will be past, is present, was future\n\nOne immediate response to the argument, which McTaggart takes up in �330 ff., is to deny claim (2). McTaggart puts the objection well:\n\nMcTaggart states his objection in ��331-332. We can summarize it as follows. (For further discussion, see Dummett, ‘A Defence of McTaggart’s Proof of the Unreality of Time.’)\n\nMcTaggart’s argument was that every event is both past, present, and future, which is a contradiction. The objector responds that some events may be (e.g.) such that they will be past, are present, and were future; but never such that they are present, are past, and are future.\n\nBut what does it mean to say that something, e.g., was present? Presumably it just means that there is some point in the past at which it was present. We can combine any two of our predicates ‘past’, ‘present’, and ‘future’ in this way, so that just as any event can have any of the three 1st-level properties\n\npast\n\npresent\n\nfuture\n\nso any event can have any of the nine 2nd-level properties\n\npast in the past\n\npresent in the past\n\nfuture in the past\n\npast in the present\n\npresent in the present\n\nfuture in the present\n\npast in the future\n\npresent in the future\n\nfuture in the future\n\nThe objector is suggesting that instead of describing events in terms of the first-level properties, we describe them in terms of the second-level properties.\n\nBut, McTaggart argues, the contradiction remains at the second level. For just as it is true of any event (again, for simplicity ignoring first and final events) that it is past, present, and future, it is true of any event that it is past in the present, present in the present, and future in the present. But these are no more compatible than our original three.\n\nTo escape this reply on McTaggart’s part, the objector might reject the claim that every event is past, is present, and is future. Instead, she might say, it is true that some event might be, e.g., such that it will be past in the present, is present in the present and was future in the present.\n\nHow should McTaggart reply?\n\n3.2 The denial that time essentially involves the A series\n\nChange without the A series.\n\nCausation, entropy, and explanations of the direction of time.\n\nReferences\n\nSee also Baldwin, Thomas (1998).
