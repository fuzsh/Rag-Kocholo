McTaggart&rsquo;s 1908 &lsquo;The Unreality of Time&rsquo; is rightly recognised as sparking the debate between philosophers who hold the &lsquo;real nature&rsquo; of time to be an A-series, and those who take it to be a B-series. Bertrand Russell has been described as the &lsquo;father&rsquo; of B-theory, but the parentage of A-theory is murky. This paper argues we should look to fellow &lsquo;new realist&rsquo; G. E. Moore, who espoused anti-realism about time until late 1898 and then became a &lsquo;common-sense&rsquo; A-theorist and presentist. I put Moore&rsquo;s shifting views in context, explore his positions, and argue he owes a great debt to &lsquo;old realist&rsquo; Henry Sidgwick.&nbsp;",
