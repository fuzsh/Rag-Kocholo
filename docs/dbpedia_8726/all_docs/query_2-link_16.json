        "text": "John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart, commonly John McTaggart or J. M. E. McTaggart (3 September 1866 – 18 January 1925) was an idealist metaphysician. For most of his life McTaggart was a fellow and lecturer in philosophy at Trinity College. He was an exponent of the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and among the most notable of the British idealists.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe really fundamental aspect of the dialectic is not the tendency of the finite category to negate itself but to complete itself.\n\nStudies in the Hegelian Dialectic (1896), p. 10.\n\nReligion has always, I think, implied a belief in some fundamental harmony, some sort of reconciliation between the claims of our own nature and the facts of the universe.\n\nSome Dogmas of Religion (1906), p. 9.\n\nOn the determinist hypothesis an omnipotent God could have prevented all sin by creating us with better natures and in more favourable surroundings. … Hence we should not be responsible for our sins to God.\n\nSome Dogmas of Religion (1906), p. 165.\n\nEncyclopedic article on J.
