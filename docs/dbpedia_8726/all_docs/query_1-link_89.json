M. E. McTaggart, a prominent figure in English philosophy during the early 20th century. Created by the talented artist Roger Fry, this oil painting beautifully captures the essence of John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart, an esteemed metaphysician and lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge. The portrait exudes a sense of intellectual depth and contemplation as McTaggart gazes into the distance with a thoughtful expression on his face. The vibrant colors used by Fry bring life to the image, highlighting both the subject's distinguished features and his connection to British history. As we delve into this piece of art, we are transported back to England in the 1920s or possibly even later in the 1940s when this print was created. It serves as a window into a different era - one where philosophical discourse thrived and great minds like McTaggart shaped our understanding of metaphysics. Preserved within these brushstrokes is not only an appreciation for British philosophers but also for social history itself. This print is part of Kenneth Matthews' book \"British Philosophers\" published by Collins in London in 1943, offering us insight into how intellectuals were celebrated during that time. With its rich historical context and artistic brilliance, this portrait reminds us of John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart's enduring legacy as a philosopher who left an indelible mark on British philosophy and beyond.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nMADE IN THE UK\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
