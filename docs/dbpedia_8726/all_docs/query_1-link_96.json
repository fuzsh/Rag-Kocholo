        "text": "Abstract My dissertation offers an analysis of the notion of temporal passage and of the argument that we can know that time passes from experience. It brings two results: (1) Temporal passage requires a non-eternalist theory of time and can only be coherently analysed in terms of absolute becoming. (2) We cannot experience temporal passage, at least not in a way that allows us to infer that time really passes. The dissertation is divided into two parts, where the first part, about the metaphysics of temporal passage, provides the basis for what is argued about the experience of temporal passage in the second part. Chapters two to four focus on McTaggart’s paradox and the question whether the notion of temporal passage is logically and metaphysically coherent. This is important for the continuation to part two of the thesis, for if passage was not a coherent notion, then any further debate as to whether or not we can know that time passes from experience would be redundant. Chapter three offers a novel reconstruction of McTaggart’s paradox as a vicious ontological regress of relational changes, providing a limited defence of McTaggart’s argument within the framework of an A-eternalist understanding of time and temporal passage. Chapter five suggests that the paradox can be avoided if passage is understood in terms of coming into existence simpliciter and going out of existence simpliciter, or ‘absolute becoming’, best accommodated within a presentist framework. In the second part of the thesis I argue against a frequently found (but rarely explicitly analysed) argument, the ‘Argument from Experience’ (AfE), which states that we can infer from the experience of temporal passage that time really passes because the fact that time passes is the best explanation for having experiences of passage. Chapter six gives a formulation and analysis of AfE and evaluates possible objections. It is suggested that the best objection is to deny that we can have experiences of passage in the first place. Chapter seven specifies that for AfE to work, the content of an experience of passage must be best explained by the fact that time passes. It is then argued that this is only the case for perceptual experiences of events undergoing absolute becoming. The chapter also introduces the notion of ‘A-change’, which is constituted by events undergoing absolute becoming such that A-change occurs if and only if there is an event E1 (Fa at t1) which ceases to exist, and a qualitatively distinct event E2 (Ga at t2), coming into existence. Chapter eight applies these results to the debate of temporal perception: among the major accounts of temporal perception, is there (at least) one account that can accommodate perceptual experiences of A-change in a way that allows us to infer that there is A-change, and thus absolute becoming, i.e. passage? The answer I give is negative. Memory based accounts do not allow for experiences of A-change because they deny that we can have, strictly speaking, perceptual experiences of change in general. Retentional theories do not allow for experiences of A-change as A-change. In other words, given the retentional theory, we could not distinguish between experiences of A-change and experiences of B-change, where B-change merely requires qualitative variation of properties over time but not passage. The problem with the extensional theory of temporal perception is that it is metaphysically incompatible with presentism and therefore with absolute becoming. Two non-standard forms of presentism are explored that are, prima facie, compatible with the extensional theory, ‘Compound Presentism’ (taken from Barry Dainton) and ‘Simple Presentism’. Compound Presentism and Simple Presentism are both views according to which the present time is temporally extended. Compound Presentism turns out to be incoherent. Whether Simple Presentism and the extensional theory of temporal perception cohere, depends on further commitments such as distributional properties. Setting these problems aside, it is argued that even if both, Simple Presentism and the extensional theory of temporal perception were true, we could not perceptually represent absolute becoming. Chapter eight finishes with a response to two objections against my argument that we cannot experience temporal passage, one involving ‘high level properties’, and one involving ‘present-as-absent’ representation in experience. AfE fails because we either cannot experience temporal passage at all, or not in a way that allows us to infer that time passes from experience.\n\nDiscursive liberal democracy might not be the best of all possible forms of government, yet in Europe it is largely accepted as such. The attractors of liberal democracy (majority rule, political equality, reasonable self-determination and an ideological framework built in a tentative manner) as well as an adequate dose of secularization (according to the doctrine of religious restraint) provide both secularist and educated religious people with the most convenient ideological framework. Unfortunately, many promoters of ideological secularization take too strong a stance against the manifestation of religiosity in the public sphere. They claim that people may discuss, debate or adopt (coercive) laws and regularities only by means of secular public reasons and secular motivation. We argue that these secular restraints on the ideological framework are unfairly biased against religion, counterproductive and unreasonable. The exaggerated secular restrictions create a strict secular public sphere that appears to be a Pickwickian world suitable just for inoffensive, dull and lethargic people. Deliberately separated from the idea of truth, secular public reasons cannot sustain a complex adaptive system like discursive liberal democracy. Liberal democracy needs citizens with a strong sense of truth and with a sufficient will-power to follow both a personal ideal and a collective ideal. Religious beliefs provide people with just such a sense of truth and with the desire to have a certain kind of character. In the secularized public sphere of liberal democracy, people can manifest just educated religious beliefs that correspond to the real world and respect the principle of peaceable conduct. In the final part of the article we support the assertion that believers could and should educate their religious belief before expressing them in the public sphere. Educated religious beliefs have a wide enough propositional content, obey the moral imperative of William Clifford, are purged from all propositional components against which there is strong evidence and are consciously cultivated by the mechanism of suggestion."
