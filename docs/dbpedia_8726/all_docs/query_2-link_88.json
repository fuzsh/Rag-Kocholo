        "text": "Abstract\n\nAbstract:\n\nMcTaggart’s thesis about the unreality of time has puzzled and still puzzles philosophers of the metaphysics of time, who defend the existence of either McTaggart’s A series or McTaggart’s B series. McTaggart himself, however, was led through his analysis to view as real what he called the “C series,” which, unlike the temporal A and B series, is atemporal. The author argues that the ancient conception of time, especially of the Neoplatonist Damascius, reveals an important gap in McTaggart’s thought, namely, his overlooking the idea of an integral present (that is, a present that does not form a series), which allows to account for the B series as being generated from the C series without the involvement of the A series, which has been shown by McTaggart to have a contradictory nature. This comparative account enables us to see not only that Damascius was the first presentist in the history of the metaphysics of time, but also that McTaggart’s analysis rests upon the unreflected assumption that time, if it is real, progresses linearly."
