McTaggart is a name for a the Gaelic name Mac an t-Sagairt, which means \"son of the priest.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the McTaggart family\n\nThe surname McTaggart was first found in Ross-shire (Gaelic: Siorrachd Rois) a former county, now part of the Council Areas of Highland and Western Isles in Northern Scotland, which emerged from the Gaelic lordship of the Earl of Ross. One of the first on record was Ferchar, son of the Red Priest of Applecross in Ross. He was knighted by King Alexander of Scotland in 1215 for his assistance in subduing the rebellious clans of Moray. He eventually became the Earl of Ross. 1\n\nThe Chronicle of Melrose noted: \"Machentagar attacked them and mightily overthrew the king's enemies; and he cut off their heads and presented them as gifts to the new king ... And because of this, the lord king appointed him a new knight.\"\n\nFearchar of Ross or Ferchar mac in tSagairt (anglicized as Farquhar MacTaggart), was the first of the Scottish Ó Beólláin (O'Beolan, Beolan) family who received by Royal Grant the lands and Title of Mormaer or Earl of Ross (1223-1251.)\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the McTaggart family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our McTaggart research.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Ratione non vi\n\nMotto Translation: By reason, not by force.\n\nCitations +\n\nBlack, George F., The Surnames of Scotland Their Origin, Meaning and History.
