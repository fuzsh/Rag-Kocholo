Many authors have attempted to defend, object, or rework McTaggart's arguments, however, in this paper I hold that McTaggart's arguments for the unreality of time do not hold. McTaggart's argument rests on an apparent contradiction in the A-series of time. Namely that the A-series is necessary for time and that the A-series necessarily produces a contradiction. In this paper, I attempt to show that this supposed contradiction is actually caused by incorrectly establishing the origin and direction of the descriptor of time needed to understand its progression.",
