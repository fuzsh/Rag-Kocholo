        "text": "Editor: William Sweet, St Francis Xavier University, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nThe Biographical Encyclopedia of British Idealism will include the principal figures writing on, and responding, to the Idealist movement in Britain. Its focus will be on the idealism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but will include major figures of earlier and later idealist schools.\n\nFrom the time of the Cambridge Platonists of the seventeenth century, idealism has had a strong presence in the philosophical traditions of Great Britain, and its impact has been felt not only throughout the English-speaking world, but also in countries where intellectual contact with Britain flourished in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Moreover, in recent years, there has been a considerable renewed interest in the British idealists, and many of the ideas once championed by them are being reintroduced and discussed in philosophy and politics.\n\nNo existing biographical encyclopedia focuses on the idealist traditions in Great Britain. While articles on several of the figures included may also be found in the Dictionary of National Biography – though sometimes only in the new Oxford DNB – or in standard philosophical encyclopedias, information on many others is not easily available. This is particularly true concerning those whose most important philosophical work, though inspired by British idealism, had its influence largely outside of the British Isles (e.g., in Canada, Australia, Southern Africa, and Asia – particularly India).\n\nIn addition to entries on the leading representatives of the idealist schools, the Encyclopedia will also include articles on a wide range of less well-known writers, not often included in philosophical encyclopedias or dictionaries. As the editors of the Dictionary of Nineteenth Century Philosophy have noted, the importance of looking at minor figures is now widely accepted by historians of philosophy. Minor figures frequently posed the problems or extended the work of the better-known figures, so that it is often the minor figures who typically represent the breadth and impact of their teachers.\n\nIdealism had a significant impact on not only philosophers, but political figures, members of the judiciary, educators, social workers, scientists, church leaders and theologians, and missionaries – many of whom were active in the furthest reaches of the British Empire. As appropriate, the Encyclopedia includes a number of these figures to the extent that they made a relevant contribution to the development of philosophy.\n\nThis Encyclopedia will be invaluable for those interested in studying idealism – a tradition often regarded as an aberrant phase in the history of British thought. In particular, late nineteenth and early twentieth-century British Idealism provoked a wide range of attacks and replies from the major figures of the time, such as Henry Sidgwick, John Dewey, F.C.S. Schiller, C.D. Broad, and Bertrand Russell. Yet this Encyclopedia will also be of particular value to those interested in individuals who, while closely connected with British philosophy, had an effect far beyond it.\n\nThe Encyclopedia understands ‘British Idealism’ broadly, and it will serve to illustrate the breadth and diversity of the idealist schools and traditions. Some of the major figures which were associated with British Idealism were Bernard Bosanquet, F.H. Bradley, Edward Caird, R.G. Collingwood, T.H. Green, L.T. Hobhouse, J.M.E. McTaggart, J.H. Muirhead, D.G. Ritchie, and J.H. Stirling. Important critics of idealism, as well as non-British thinkers who made significant contributions to the idealist traditions - such as Brand Blanshard, Benedetto Croce, William James, C.S. Peirce, Josiah Royce and George Santayana - also have entries.\n\nContributors whose entries concern ‘respondents’ or critics of idealism, will be asked to concentrate on how these authors criticized or responded to idealist thought.\n\nWhile the Encyclopedia focuses on British thought between 1860 and 1930, it will also include figures from earlier idealist traditions - such as the Cambridge Platonists (e.g., Henry More; Ralph Cudworth; Benjamin Whichcote; Peter Sterry; John Smith; Nathaniel Culverwell; John Worthington; George Rust; Anne Conway; and John Norris), George Berkeley, Arthur Collier, S.T. Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle and J.F. Ferrier – and important later contributors such as Michael Oakeshott, A.C. Ewing, J.N. Findlay, Blanshard, and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.\n\nThe time-period covered in the Encyclopedia is largely unrestricted. It will include those important figures who were engaged in – or engaged in discussion with – idealist philosophy, from the time of its earliest appearance. It will also include some living authors whose contribution to idealist philosophy has been particularly noteworthy.\n\nIn addition to some 200 biographical entries, each containing a critical assessment and bibliography, the Encyclopedia will include lengthy discussions of the background, history and development and influence of British Idealism throughout the world. This will involve treatments of related themes and subjects, including geographical surveys (e.g., “British Idealism in India,” “British Idealism in Canada,”) and analyses of how it related to certain fields or subjects (such as pragmatism and empiricism). These discussions not only set the context, but also signal where British Idealism had an influence and how related contemporary philosophical views relate to it.\n\nBiographical entries have been written in an accessible style, avoiding unnecessary scholarly terminology, and include:\n\ni) a biographical sketch of the author\n\nii) an analysis and assessment of his or her doctrines and ideas, with emphasis on the historical context and, where relevant, subsequent influences\n\niii) a bibliography listing the subject's major and minor philosophical writings and giving a short list to further reading.\n\nTentative List of Individual Entries\n\n1.
