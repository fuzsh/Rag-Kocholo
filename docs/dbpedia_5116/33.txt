WHKY-TV, virtual and UHF digital channel 14, is an independent television station licensed to Hickory, North Carolina, United States and serving the northwestern corner of the Charlotte media market, a region locally referred to as "The Unifour". Owned by Long Communications, LLC, it is sister to radio station WHKY (1290 AM and translator 102.3 FM). The two stations share studios on Main Avenue SE in Hickory. WHKY-TV's primary transmitter is located on Bakers Mountain in southwestern Catawba County, with a secondary transmitter in the unincorporated area of Newell in northeastern Mecklenburg County (just northeast of the Charlotte city limits).

On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 7 in the Hickory area and channel 18 in the Charlotte area in both standard and high definition (CW affiliate WCCB, which broadcasts over the air on virtual channel 18, is carried by Spectrum on cable channel 5 in Hickory and channel 11 in Charlotte). On the South Carolina side of the market, it is seen on Comporium channels 124 (SD) and 1124 (HD).[1] It is not presently carried by AT&T U-verse in the Charlotte market. Google Fiber carried the station until July 1, 2017. WHKY-TV is also available on cable in Mountain City, Tennessee, which is part of the Tri-Cities television market.

There is no separate website for WHKY-TV; instead, it is integrated with that of the co-owned radio station.
