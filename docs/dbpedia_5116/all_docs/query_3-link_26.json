The group is offering California executives big incentives The Greater Phoenix Economic Council says it will provide CEOs free airfare and accommodations to check out Arizona. The group sites the tax increase from Proposition 30, the cap and trade program and cost of living in California as reasons companies should relocate or expand in Arizona. Barry Broome, President of the Council, says they've had several California CEOs already express interest. BROOME: \"Our goal is get a dialogue with the CEO, bring the CEO into the Greater Phoenix market, and show them the value proposition of our market. And the conversation is going to start with the cost of doing business and tax policy.\" Broome says they originally were making the offer to the first 50 interested executives, but they're expanded the offer to the first 100. Broome says he's heard from CEOs who are beginning to question the value of operating in California. The California Chamber of Commerce did not respond to the issue.\n\ncc/2021-04/en_middle_0014.json.gz/line4\n\n__label__cc\n\n0.68327\n\n0.31673\n\nAlessia Cara - Scars To Your Beautiful Lyrics: She just wants to be beautiful She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits She craves attention, she praises an image She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor Oh, she don't see the light that's shining Deeper than the eyes can find it Maybe we have made her blind So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving You know, covergirls eat nothing She says \"beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything\" \"What's a little bit of hunger?\" \"I could go a little while longer,\" she fades away She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface So to all the girls that's hurting Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer The light that shines within There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark No better you than the you that you are No better life than the life we're living No better time for your shine, you're a star Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark Alessia Cara: Main Page\n\ncc/2021-04/en_middle_0014.json.gz/line7\n\n__label__wiki\n\n0.590428\n\n0.590428\n\nFollow @kabster728 The Digital Solution > Accessories Countertrend: H-P Says Please Print Often September 29, 2009 at 4:18 pm PT See More Reviews » If your company makes printers but general trends are leaning toward using less paper and moving digital content to e-readers and smartphones, what can you do? Hewlett-Packard’s solution is to find new ways to get people to print more. The $399 H-P Photosmart Premium All-in-One with Touch-Smart Web (hp.com/go/touchprinting) will print, copy, fax and scan like other all-in-ones. But it connects to the Internet using built-in Wi-Fi and displays customized Web applications on its 4.33-inch touch screen. These apps are designed to promote printing in any way possible, including photos from Snapfish, Sudoku puzzles, movie tickets from Fandango, coupons, maps from Google (GOOG) Maps, coloring-book pages and news articles—all without using a computer. The print apps are part of the new H-P App Studio, H-P’s (HPQ) answer to the flurry of app stores—Apple’s (AAPL) App Store, RIM’s (RIMM) BlackBerry World, Android Marketplace, Palm’s (PALM) App Catalog and Microsoft’s (MSFT) Zune Marketplace—that ease the process of downloading onto mobile devices. A “Get More” icon on the printer’s touch screen presents descriptions of available apps. There are currently 15 available for download onto your printer, and more will be added in coming months. The Photosmart All-in-One connects to Web apps that promote printing of everything from photos to tickets. This printer is designed to work with more than just the H-P App Studio. A downloadable tool called the H-P Photo Print Gadget installs on computers running Windows 7 or Vista (not Windows XP) so people can drag and drop photos to it for printing. PlayStation 3 owners can capture and print screen shots as evidence of their game success. And a long-available free app in Apple’s App Store called H-P iPrint Photo lets iPhone and iPod Touch owners send photos to this and other H-P printers. The goal of this product is obviously to get people to print more, and in my case, it worked. I used more paper in a week of testing the Photosmart Premium All-in-One than I normally print out in three weeks at my office. The printer quickly churned out dual-sided pages with photos in rich colors. But the concept of adding apps to a printer while also asking people to become more paper-reliant seems like one step forward, two steps back. I could see this concept working on a thin, stylish printer that could fit neatly on an entryway table, making it a cinch for people to grab maps, movie tickets and coupons on their way out the door. But this is a large, all-in-one machine that takes up some serious space. And if this all-in-one is truly meant to work without a PC, it should do a better job of letting you interact with pages, like zooming in on a document to preview before printing. In the current document preview screen, the text is too small to read. Likewise, the Google Calendar app printed a nice one-page calendar month view, but I couldn’t zoom in on the print preview to see specific appointments. This forced me to print the page to see its contents, using more ink and more paper. Other apps are shamelessly begging users to press Print. A Toys and Crafts app made by H-P itself includes paper dolls with cut-out clothes that can be snipped and folded to stay on the doll’s form. For the doll’s face, kids are encouraged to use a photo of themselves that–surprise, surprise—they can print using their all-in-one. Coupons.com supplies two apps—one for coupons and one for recipes. I browsed through 87 product coupons in my ZIP Code and marked those that I wanted to print using a small check-box on the touch screen. Pressing “Print” compiled three coupons on one piece of paper. Recipes from Coupons.com printed with brightly colored photos of the end result; I’m looking forward to following one for Curried Chicken Salad. For now, the Google Maps app isn’t ready for prime time: It prints only maps, not directions. H-P says it’s planning to add directions but wouldn’t say when. And a Nickelodeon app couldn’t load on my printer. Some apps took from 10 to 30 seconds to load—precious time when you’re running out the door. One of the smartest apps, Tabbloid, lets people assemble a personalized tabloid-style print-out of news from a variety of sources like Daily Kos for politics and FanHouse for sports. But this assembling must be done on a computer, thus negating this printer’s no-PC approach. I chose from a list of 10 topics including automotive, celebrity, politics and sports and created a printable Tabbloid that, with one click, was sent wirelessly to the corresponding app on my printer. I printed it out to read during my commute. I liked using the Photosmart Premium All-in-One’s generous screen for touch gestures like flicking left-to-right through a carousel of icons that represent apps. An on-screen keyboard appeared when I had to type in passwords for things like my Snapfish account. H-P says it will introduce other products with TouchSmart Web capability and access to the HP App Studio, and one hopes these products will include low-end printers rather than expensive all-in-ones. The apps on the H-P Photosmart Premium All-in-One with TouchSmart Web are user-friendly, but I’m not convinced they’ll incite people to print more things more often. Edited by Walter S. Mossberg.

Chief George -Okoli is asking the court to disqualify Ben Bruce from contesting the election on the ground of his dual citizenship. Bayelsa East Senatorial district comprises of three local governments namely Brass, Nembe, and Ogbia Local governments. Four people contested for the senatorial slot; they are Bruce, George-Ikoli, Madam Irene Digitemi and Mr Nelson Belief. The leadership of the PDP at the state had allegedly prevailed upon other candidates to step down for Bruce on account of his closeness to President Goodluck Jonathan. The originating summons filed before the court by Chief George-Ikoli seeks the court to determine the following issues: Whether having regard to the combined provisions of Sections 66(1)(a) and 28(1) of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), an aspirant for the elective office of the Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, who whilst voluntarily acquiring the citizenship of another country (that is the United States of America) and in the process of which he (the aspirant) declares on oath, the absolute and entire renunciation of citizenship of and allegiance and fidelity to Nigeria can without more be eligible and seek election to the office of Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; Read further: https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2015/03/24/senate-ben-bruce-faces-disqualification-over-dual-citizenship/ Themes: Dual Nationality, Nationality of Politicians Regions: Nigeria Nigeria: Court delivers verdict on Ben Bruce’s dual citizenship and allegiance to US 17 Dec Dual Citizenship And the Law: Is Bukola Saraki A Nigerian Citizen?

The Tribal Network member organizations having geographical representation in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Frontier Regions (FRs), Balochistan, and Afghanistan formulated this network during 2005. The core objective of TN was to build up a broad based tribal civil society coalition on both sides of the Durand Line and collectively work on the capacity building of local tribes for their lead role in peace building and integrated development activities in the conflict affected tribal border region. TN over the last seven years undertook numerous research, training, and advocacy activities on the need of the larger role of local tribes in the resolution of prevailing multifarious conflicts in the region and advocated for the acceleration of political, social, administrative reforms and development of participatory integrated development system in the entire tribal region. TN member organizations include Community Mobilization and Development Organization (CMDO) Peshawar, Society Reformers Organization (SRO) Parachinar, Waziristan Development Organization (WDO) Tank, The Coordination of Afghan Relief (COAR) Kabul, Social Aid Quetta, and Center for Research and Dialogue (CRD) Islamabad. CRD (previously known as Center for Research Communication and Dialogue) was the coordinating organization of TN from 2005 to 2010 and presently CMDO is the coordinating organization of the Tribal Network.

It is the oldest preserved “book” produced in the Low Countries, the wider area of which encompasses contemporary Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and is an exceptional testimonial to the status of the written word. www.codexeyckensis.be Codex Eyckensis online Unique glimpse behind the scenes Unique glimpse behind the scenes in the research laboratory at the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage (KIK-IRPA, Brussels) by Marina van Bos, Maaike Vandorpe and Line Raiff. The Flemish museum consultant Anne Milkers had the opportunity to have look behind the scenes at the pigment investigation of the Codex Eyckensis. She was guided by Maaike Vandorpe, technical expert at the laboratory of papers, leathers and parchments of the KIK-IRPA. Although the Codex Eyckensis is currently being investigated at the Book Heritage Lab of the KU Leuven, Dr. Marina van Bos and Maaike Vandorpe have already started with the first analyses in their KIK-IRPA lab in Brussels. Twenty five years ago, prof. Lieve Watteeuw removed the various layers of plastic foil from the parchment. The foil has been carefully kept at the KIK-IRPA ever since. The plastic sheets were used in a comparative study to the parchment folios (as shown in the picture). The plastics clearly show pigment residue left from the original parchment folios. This is a blessing in disguise! The pigments and inks on the plastic foil can now be analyzed with the µRaman spectroscopy (see photograph). This analysis is non-destructive, because it does not require to take a sample of the pigments. The plastic foil will be placed directly under the laser. It is possible to detect red and yellow earth pigments, minium lead (red) and orpiment (yellow). At a later stage, complementary but destructive analyses of the pigment residues left on the plastic sheets can give more information on the possible use of organic colors. In 2017 the old manuscript will be transported to the lab of the KIK-IRPA in Brussels. Here, further investigation with the µRaman spectroscopy and the newest non-destructive analysis by macro XRF mapping, will characterize the pigments and the inks.

It is a unique record of the years in which John Brogden, an internationally celebrated 'art goldsmith and jeweller worked first in partnership and then as owner-director of his own firm. This was a period of great diversity in fashionable jewellery, and the Brogden firm where noted for their skill in designing and creating a range of styles. The firm was founded by John Brogden the elder in about 1796. From about 1824 to 1831 it was styled 'Brogden and Garland' and thereafter until 1841 'Garland and Watherston'. The younger Brogden, the son of Thomas Brogden and presumably a relative of the founder, served an apprenticeship to J.W. garland as a goldsmith and jeweller from 1834 to 1841. Following Garland's departure, the remaining partner, J.H. Watherston, removed the firm to new premises at 16 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden and in 1848 joined forces with the younger Brogden.

What better way to do it than with an oversized issue guest starring, as the cover reveals, The Punisher and Sandman? Clay McLeod Chapman introduces us to a couple of new villains who are insidious enough to have caught the eye of not only Scream, but also The Punisher and Sandman. As any comic veteran will tell you any storylines involving multiple heroes can’t have them working together, no, at first we need to have a fight between them all. Sometimes these confrontations can feel a little forced and contrived, just to do that little bit of fan service between who would win out of Superhero X and Y. Chapman manages to give each character a slightly different set of priorities which conflict just enough to bring our heroes to blows. It’s well done, although the only thing that doesn’t quite gel is that all three heroes choose the exact same moment to go after the villain, but it’s a small gripe which can be overlooked. The only other slight complaint is that Chapman doesn’t quite get the essence of The Punisher right. He’s not a million miles away, but doesn’t quite capture the magic which makes Castle such an interesting character. He feels a little bit one dimensional here. Moving past that Chapman manages to build up suspense really well, beginning the issue by introducing us to a homeless kid, with a series of textless panels. It’s a great piece of storytelling that tells us more than a dozen lines of dialogue would and helps set the pace. And when things appear to be getting better for this poor child the reader is aware that all is not as it seems and the danger they’re in. It builds the tension fantastically and sets the stage for the rest of the issue. Having F.E.A.S.T. as the background for the series has been a nice touch, making Aunt May a regular feature and helping to firmly place Scream within the Marvel universe. A new character introduced there looks to be important to the series going forward. And the conclusion of this issue introduces another thread which connects back to the Absolute Carnage event, making the Curse of Carnage part of the title feel relevant again. Chris Mooneyham’s art has been outstanding throughout the series, and this issue is no exception. Having worked with Chapman for the first five issues they’ve now reached a point where Mooneyham’s art is as integral for telling the story as Chapmans writing, the first page is virtually textless and does a fantastic job of introducing the poor homeless kid who begins our story for us. In previous issues it’s been Mooneyhams monsters which have really stood out, but without any real monsters beyond Scream his art is still fantastic and one of the highlights of the series. Then we have Rain Beredo’s colours. No stranger to colouring symbiotes he does an excellent job whenever Scream is on the page, but for the rest of the issue his duller and more muted colours bring to life the seedier side of the Marvel universe which we don’t get to see as often. It’s a great match for Mooneyhams art. A great setup for the next big Scream storyarc, it promises great things to come. New villains for Scream to face, new characters for her to befriend, the police slowly circling closer to learning Andi’s alterego, Chapman has plenty of plates spinning with lots to look forward to. The inclusion of The Punisher and Sandman works pretty well overall and the oversized issue makes great use of the extra pages it has to pace the story well. Chris Mooneyhams art remains a highlight of this exciting horror series.\n\ncc/2021-04/en_middle_0014.json.gz/line35\n\n__label__cc\n\n0.541481\n\n0.458519\n\nCompany Man Comic A Webcomic that's much funnier than your last team meeting!

In this vivid, intimate story one of the aces of the fireworks army takes you behind the scenes to reveal, for the first time, the thrills and dangers of his roaring trade. MILLIONS of Americans thrill yearly to the glittering wheels, flaming rockets and spectacular bombs of the giant fireworks displays; but the men who fire them are the men nobody knowsâ€”the world’s most mysterious showmen. How does it feel to walk among the flaming sets and exploding mortars during a big display? What are the real dangers of this roaring trade? What is the strange, unexplainable lure of a profession that requires toying with tons of explosives to give the crowds a flaming thrill? Art Briese, for nineteen years an expert pyrotechnician for Thearle-Duffield, recently revealed the mysteries of his calling to an investigator for Modern Mechanix and Inventions. Briese has personally blown millions of dollars worth of fireworks into blazing ruins; he’s touched off enough powder and dynamite to blow Pike’s Peak into fragments; and he’s come through his exacting job with injuries no more serious than scorched hands and a current enthusiasm for his work that’s as keen as the day he-got his first stick of dynamite to bore. “One of the important things to keep in mind about fireworks,” said Briese, “is the difference between display work and the over-the-counter businessâ€”that is, the sale of firecrackers, pin wheels, rockets and the – like to the consumer. Accidents are far less frequent in display work because trained men do the firing. “The noise-makers are the most dangerous pieces. In fact, a stick of dynamite is about the most hazardous unit we employ. Of course, when this is handled properly, it’s safe. “We don’t use much dynamite in the average show. At the Century of Progress, for instance, it is forbidden because the shock would be harmful to fish in the Shedd Aquarium. In shows where dynamite is used the sticks are fired electrically. They are suspended a few feet above the ground and carefully isolated to prevent damage. These shots and the big bombs we call ‘ballyhoo.’ The bombs are fired from mortars, steel cylinders buried up to their necks in the ground. Workers are protected by a barricade consisting of a 12” x 12″‘ timber or a telephone pole to prevent danger in case a bomb is detonated in the mortar. The firing fuse lies out over the barricade where it can be ignited easily without getting too near the mortar. This fuse ignites a charge of powder at the base of the bomb, literally pushing it into the air. The explosion comes when a time fuse, already ignited, reaches the powder charge. Guarding Against Accidents “The worst accidents in the fireworks business occur at the factories but they are rare now. Only small quantities of material are Handled at a time and most of the work is done in isolated sheds, spotted over a . wide area. These sheds are of flimsy construction. If an explosion does occur, the walls and roof give way, reducing the shock to any persons inside. The big display sets with all their sparks and fire may look hazardous but they are not as dangerous as the simple sticks of dynamite and the bombs. A big display may contain a ton of material but only 300 or 400 pounds of this may be explosive powder. Chemicals make up the balance of the material; and whereas they’ll burn, of course, they won’t explode violently. How Displays Are Fired “Shooters wear no special safety equipment, not even goggles.. The firing is done with a ‘port fire’ a five-foot flare made of two rocket sticks spliced together. It burns about five minutes and gives plenty of brilliant light so the operator can see the ‘match,’ or fuse, where the piece is set off. Sometimes part of the set doesn’t go off because of a broken connection. We keep watch for this and reach up with a port fire and start it going. Any part of the set can be fired as long as the fuse can be reached. This burns rapidly. In a few seconds, it ignites the entire piece, firing the little fire pots or lances that are attached to the rattan backing with which the designs are traced on the set. “Big pieces are made up of wooden frames or sections. The rattan design is placed on at the factory and the frames with the necessary lances are shipped to the scene. The operator’s job is to assemble the sections, join the fuses together, or ‘cut them in,’ as we say, and, of course, fire the set when the proper time comes. “A big piece like the ‘Chicago Fire’ made for the Century of Progress contains 500 frames, is 700 feet long and from 20 to 65 feet high. The popular ‘Bombardment of Ft. McHenry’ set takes 1,200 feet of fast-burning fuse, 2,880 color pots or lances, 80 pounds of chemicals and powder, 1,200 feet of pliable rattan and over 1,000 square feet of frames. “Thrills?” Briese smiled. “What gives the crowd a thrill is pretty much routine to us. The shooters can’t really see the fireworks with their faces right up against ‘cm but there’s a lot of satisfaction in getting a good show together, licking all the problems that come up and then having people say it was swell. We get the news even if we don’t come down to the footlights! “Want to know what we’re most afraid of? Bain! A few little innocent raindrops trickling out of a cloud will scare a ‘shooter’ more than a whole carload of bombs. Bain may mean a big loss of fireworks, and an expensive delay. We frequently carry rain insurance to protect us against these losses. “Getting helpers on the job is one of the big problems but we have solved it pretty well by always having an expert to take charge. “There are only about 200 really professional fireworks shooters in the United States. Sometimes the green helper is more bother than he’s worth. Down in Birmingham, Ala., one year, I got two negroes to help me set up a show and hired them to stay for the shooting. Night came and the hour for the firework*. I touched off the first piece, a set of fast-burning, spark-shooting pinwheels. My trusty aids got into the spirit of the thing immediately. The last I saw of them, they were vanishing into the night at top speed. A Fireworks Flight With Ruth Law “Things are always happening to break the routine and that’s an additional reason why the work is interesting. I was on a job at Avoca, Iowa, in 1917. I had been in the business just three years. I felt I knew a lot but I got a new idea on this angle and found there was lots to learn. Ruth Law, the famous aviatrix, was there, giving a flying exhibition. She decided to make a night flight with fireworks flaring from her plane, the first time she had attempted such a stunt. “I attached the fireworks to the wings of her plane, one of those old-type pushers with the engine behind and the seat out in front. The pieces were to be fired by electric squibs connected in series to the plane’s magneto. ‘Want to go along?’ she called to me. ‘I may need some help firing this stuff.’ “I looked at the plane. There didn’t seem to be much accommodation for passengers. “‘Just hop on the wing there and you’ll be all right,’ said Ruth. She was getting impatient. The old engine was chugging away behind and the crowds were waiting. “I doubt if I would do it today, but I hopped on as fast as I could, tickled to go up with Ruth. I straddled all the wires and other supports I could drape myself around, dug my fingernails into a strut and away we went, into the black night with the lights of Avoca and its fair falling away below us. The Dangers of Flying Fireworks “I didn’t have any time to think about the flight. .The fireworks kept me busy. We fired ’em all right but I was worried about the flares. Would they fire all right or would they set the wings ablaze? I had all the confidence in the world in Ruth’s flying ability, but I didn’t know whether or not the fireworks would bother her. The glare and extra wing weight might prove disturbing. “Everything went splendidly, however. In fifteen of the most absorbing minutes I have ever spent, we were back on the field and the crowd was giving Ruth a big hand. And she deserved it. The stunt sounds rather tame now. Fireworks from a plane are an old story and we know a lot more about attaching them and firing them properly. But these were early days in aviation and flying fireworks were a distinct novelty. Ruth Law proved that night as she did many times before and since that she was a real sportswoman and not afraid of anything.” Human Fireworks (Jan, 1936) Fireworks Ads (Jun, 1940) Safety Razor (Nov, 1934) (Nov, 1934) Magnetic Rail Gun in 1934 (Sep, 1934) First Surround Sound – 1934 (Apr, 1934) Stannous says: July 5, 20062:01 pm Of course the radio tube train on the cover got much smaller after transistors were invented Blah, Blah, Blahg » How a Fireworks Magician Tames Dynamite says: July 5, 20068:28 pm […] Here’s a pretty cool old article at Modern Mechanix.
