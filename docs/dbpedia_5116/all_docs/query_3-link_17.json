To that end: Welcome to the SWLing Post’s Radio Waves, a collection of links to interesting stories making waves in the world of radio. Enjoy!\n\nWhy UNESCO Believes in Radio (Red Tech)\n\nChief, Media Development and Media and Information Literacy at UNESCO Mirta Lourenço shares insight on radio’s evolution and challenges. She explains how the international organization is working to support radio stations around the world to ensure they’re able to accomplish their crucial mission.\n\nRedTech: How do you view the role of radio in our society?\n\nMirta Lourenço: Thanks to radio, we benefit from many essential public services that we seldom reflect on. These include global positioning systems, satellite navigation, environmental monitoring, intelligent transport systems, space research, etc. Radio broadcasts offer information and the possibility for people to participate, regardless of their literacy levels and socio-economic situation.\n\nThe medium is also especially suited for multilingualism. Audiences may need to hear programs in their primary language, particularly if said language is local and endangered, or in the case of refugee radio or isolated communities. Also, when literacy levels are low, local languages are crucial to the populations’ access to information, as radio constitutes the main source for reliable journalism. History has shown us that radio is the most effective emergency communication system and in organizing disaster response.\n\nAll this does not mean that radio broadcasting is free from challenges.

To that end: Welcome to the SWLing Post’s Radio Waves, a collection of links to interesting stories making waves in the world of radio. Enjoy!\n\nMany thanks to SWLing Post contributors Alan Hughes, Michael Bird, Zack Schindler, and Dennis Dura for the following tips:\n\nRadio Marti Begins Shortwave DRM Transmissions (Radio World)\n\nRadio Marti began Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) shortwave transmissions on Feb. 4. Part of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), Radio Marti broadcasts news and other programs to Cuba. The DRM shortwave transmissions are from USAGM’s Greenville, North Carolina, site.\n\nUSAGM has transmitted in DRM before. There were some transmissions from Briech, Morocco, in the early 2000s. Greenville tested DRM in 2009 in partnership with what was then known as HCJB Global Technology. So why are they back now after an absence of over a decade?\n\n“We want to experiment a bit with different modes and services available on DRM. We also want to help push the development of low-cost receivers and the best way to do that is to put some transmissions on the air, explains Gerhard Straub, director of USAGM’s Broadcast Technologies Division.[…]\n\nPush for museum at Shepparton’s Radio Australia site (Shepparton News)\n\nAmateur radio enthusiasts are pushing for the former site of Radio Australia in Shepparton North to be upgraded and retained as a national museum of radio broadcast history.\n\nMembers of the Shepparton and District Amateur Radio Club and The Vintage Radio Club of North East Victoria are due to present a 25-page proposal to an anonymous consortium of buyers said to be interested in acquiring a 258ha block of land along Verney Rd.\n\nThe block includes two buildings and several large broadcast towers on the former site of Radio Australia. The site is currently owned by BAI Communications.\n\nThe Shepparton club’s assistant secretary, Geoff Angus, said the proposal would be presented to Greater Shepparton City Council for forwarding to the consortium.[…]\n\nAPRS usage seen on the History Channel “Secret of Skinwalker Ranch”\n\nZack Schindler writes:\n\nI have been watching a show about paranormal activity on the History Channel called The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch. In the episode this week they hired a professor to do a balloon launch with some RF sensors. In this episode they also showed the APRS.FI webpage and I was able to read his callsign from an APRS tracker, KM4MRH.\n\nThe professor used an APRS tracking device. On the right side of the page link below you can click on Other SSID’s to see other balloon launches he has done. Normally when there is a balloon launch you can see the data from it going up and down. This page shows the Skinwalker balloon launch data transposed over a map. https://aprs.fi/#!call=a%2FKM4MRH-3&timerange=3600&tail=3600\n\nSadly they are using these for measuring RF fields rather than these.\n\nIn a Crisis, Radio Should Be Bigger Than Ever — So Why Isn’t It? (Rolling Stone)\n\nTerrestrial music stations have a major cultural opportunity right now, but employees say a muddied strategy is standing in the way\n\nRadio personality Kevin Ryder was “baffled” by KROQ’s “cold, heartless attitude” when he and his morning-show team were fired at the end of March. The station has long been an alternative/rock staple in Los Angeles, the second-largest market in the country, and Ryder had been on the air for more than 30 years.\n\n“The new people in charge now weren’t here for the building of the world-famous KROQ,” Ryder, one-half of the popular Kevin & Bean Show, said on air when the station let him go, live one final time. “I don’t think it means anything to them. It’s a numbers business, and there’s no family aspect to it anymore. It’s only numbers, but this place was built without numbers. It was musicians, artists, and the special relationship between music, the station, and our fans.”\n\nAM/FM radio provides localized, round-the-clock information and entertainment via friendly neighborhood voices — so in theory, it’s the perfect platform in a global crisis that forces hundreds of millions of people to stay home. But Ryder is one of many in the radio community — including on-air hosts, music directors, program directors — who have been shocked by sudden job losses in recent weeks as COVID-19 has spread across the U.S., and news out of the industry has been one bad thing after another. Why is terrestrial radio missing the opportunity here — and how should it be fighting to get back on top?[…]\n\nDo you enjoy the SWLing Post?\n\nPlease consider supporting us via Patreon or our Coffee Fund!\n\nYour support makes articles like this one possible. Thank you!\n\nI just received word from a trusted friend who is a radio industry insider working with both manufacturers and retailers around the world. He said that in the month of March, 2020, radio sales increased “dramatically.”\n\nI’m not at all surprised, in fact, because the number of email inquiries I’ve received from first time SWLing Post readers has also increased dramatically. It’s quite difficult for me to keep up with the influx of correspondence.\n\nFolks are looking for an additional source of information to either supplement or backup their Internet news outlets.\n\nAs we mentioned in a previous post, this is local radio’s time to shine.\n\nI’ve been listening to local AM stations much more recently and find that (at least the ones that are still locally-owned) have relevant up-to-date information about community news and resources while everyone here is sheltering at home. It takes me back to my youth when AM stations were truly *the* place people turned for information during severe weather events or other natural disasters.\n\nI’ve been answering so many similar inquiries the past three or four weeks, I’m working on a post to help those who are looking for a reliable, affordable radio to receive local news, weather, and information. Of course, I’ll throw a shortwave radio option in there, too.\n\nI believe this uptick in radio purchases no doubt points to the fact that fewer and fewer families have even one AM/FM radio in their home.\n\nWhat AM/FM radio(s) would you recommend in this case? I’m trying to keep my selections limited and and the price between $10 – $90 US. I’m also highlighting radios that are currently in production, simple to operate, and have good battery life.\n\nAlso, have you noticed more engaging news via your local radio stations? Please comment!\n\nLately, I’ve been spending a lot of time with WiFi radios.\n\nYou see, I’ve been preparing a three part series about WiFi radios for The Spectrum Monitor magazine (Part 1 will appear in the April 2016 issue). Not only have I been evaluating and reviewing several radios, but also station aggregators: the curated databases of radio stations to which WiFi radios link.\n\nInternet radio = Local radio discovery\n\nInternet (or Web/WiFi) radio is a fantastic platform for discovering small, even semi-isolated, community radio stations that, until the Internet, had never broadcast signals beyond their local communities. With Internet radio, we can enjoy these stations as if we, too, are locals. Local becomes international.\n\nAs I travel, I try to note the callsigns of AM/FM radio stations I enjoy.\n\nSadly, not all of my favorite local radio stations stream online as it’s a major expense for a small broadcaster and yields very little in the way of ad revenue. After all, who in South Africa is going to buy auto parts from a store in Homer Alaska? It’s a conundrum for sure, and one shared by private shortwave broadcasters.\n\nStill, there are a number of stations that do manage to have a reliable streams online.\n\nIn no particular order, here’s a short list–a handful–of some of my favorite stations that stream (click on the callsign to listen to the station live):\n\nWTZQ Everything from Glenn Miller to Steve Miller (Hendersonville, NC)\n\nWXRC Classic Rock (Charlotte, NC)\n\nWDRV Classic Rock (Chicago, IL)\n\nWHGM Classic Hits (Havre de Grace, MD)\n\nWFED Federal News Radio (Washington, DC)\n\nCBAL French language music from (Moncton, NB, Canada)\n\nCKUT McGill University radio, (Montreal, Canada)\n\nCIAO World Music and Talk Radio (Brampton, ON, Canada)\n\n6WF ABC local talk and music (Perth, Australia)\n\nFréquence 2 (Ivory Coast, Africa)\n\nCFZM Nostalgia (Toronto, Canada)\n\nSaint-Pierre & Miquelon 1ère French music/talk (St. Pierre and Miquelon)\n\nWNMB 1950’s music (North Myrtle Beach, SC)\n\nKBON Cajun/Zydeco/Blues and variety (Louisiana, USA)\n\nWhat are your favorite stations?\n\nPlease comment and share some of your favorite streaming AM/FM radio stations! I’m all ears!"
