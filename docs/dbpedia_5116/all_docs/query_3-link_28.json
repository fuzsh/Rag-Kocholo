AM Switch David Yocis, 9412 Ferry Landing Ct., Alexandria VA 22309, NRCDXNews@gmail.com Canadian info - Compiled by Shawn Axelrod, Dan Sys, and Jon Pearkins NRC AM Log updates from Wayne Heinen, amlog@nationalradioclub.or NRC AM Log data mining provided by Shawn Axelrod and Bill Hale FCC and CRTC Decisions and Applications The FCC has two different online systems for stations to file reports — the older Consolidated DataBase System (CDBS) and the newer Licensing and Management System (LMS). Fortunately for us, all the applications we track for AM Switch (CPs and STAs) have still been filed through CDBS and all the ones we don’t track (corporate ownership notifications, EEOC reports, routine license renewals) have migrated over to LMS. Starting in mid-January, STA applications and silent station notices can no longer be filed on CDBS — but the LMS system isn’t ready for them yet, which means stations have to send e-mails to the relevant FCC staff members, who convert them to PDFs which they then upload by hand into the CDBS system. This is causing delays to STA and STA extension materials becoming available for us to see, and also causing delays for the FCC in processing them. We'll try to keep up with all of this as best we can ... CALL CHANGES 1140 WURB FL Orlando - Call change to WVVO (Dec. 31). THE GAME 1470 WLMC SC Georgetown - Call change to WPIF (Jan. 24). 1550 KGMZ CA San Francisco — Call change (back) to KZDG (Jan. 25), had these calls 2011-2018. According to press reports, the KOMO-1000 switch to KNWN is going to happen Feb. 1. STATIONS GOING DARK No stations were deleted by the FCC the last two weeks (I think this would still show up in CDBS, but one never knows, see above) but there are now four stations that appear to have been silent more than a year and are ripe for deletion - WYWY-950 Barbourville KY (Aug. 1, 2020), WLEY-1080 Cayey PR (Oct. 31, 2020), KVOG-1530 Agana, Guam (Jan. 6, 2021), and WJBX-1660 Charlotte NC (Dec. 31, 2020).

With 50 kW, KRKO-1380 Everett, Washington was the main impediment in British Columbia, Alberta and the U.S. Pacific Northwest, where South Dakota’s second station, KOTA, was routinely dominant if KRKO could be nulled at all. No Aurora Alerts were e-mailed by the University of Alberta’s monitoring station, so it appears as if the major Geomagnetic activity was South of Edmonton. Nonetheless, it was not until 2300 that anything outside Alberta, other than CBK, could be heard. Even then, Vancouver and Seattle area stations were either non-existent or very weak. San Francisco’s KNBR-680 and KGO-810 were weaker than usual, but easier to hear, since there was no interference from other regularly-heard stations like CJOB-680 Winnipeg, Manitoba. At the bottom of the band, regulars KFYR-550 Bismarck, North Dakota and KMON-560 Great Falls, Montana were starting to come in with a listenable signal. KOKD’s test began at 0100, but 1380 was still totally dead in Edmonton. Checking again just before 0300, KOKD was all alone with Sweep Tones and Morse Code, but KOTA started fading up at the top of the hour until it buried KQKD completely by 0305. Early signs of KRKO returning were also heard. As those of us who have lived in The North for any length of time know, Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) are constantly on the move, “dancing,” as some call it, often slowly changing color. North of sixty degrees 14 north latitude, watching them outdoors, you can usually hear them snap, crackle and pop. So, it should come as no surprise, that DX conditions can change over time, even fairly quickly, during Aurora conditions. The Canadian Maritimes are only a dream catch for most DXers. In fact, for many years, I thought that I had only dreamt of hearing them. I was looking through some old DX Monitor and DX News issues and happened upon an Autumn 1973 report of my own, hearing CBH-860 Halifax, Nova Scotia under CJBC-860 Toronto in the wee hours of a Monday morning from Greater Vancouver. It was, in fact, my last DX session in the Vancouver area. The Maritimes are made up of four provinces: New Brunswick (NB), Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Nova Scotia (NS), and Prince Edward Island (PE). Statistically, taken together, these provinces have lost a larger percentage of AM stations than any other region of Canada. In part, because CRTC regulations make it difficult for a station moving to FM to keep their AM transmitter as a repeater. Of course, FM is more appealing to a younger audience and an FM transmitter can more easily, than AM, share an existing tower. CBH-860, of course, is long gone, as are many of the best DX targets in The Maritimes. This DX season will be the last chance to hear CKNB-950 and, especially, CBT-540, which has a chance of making it to the west by nulling or phasing CBK. A January 12 report of several Western Canadian stations being heard on an Icom IC-R75 in Carbonear, Newfoundland, including CKST-1040 and CKWX-1130 Vancouver, and KOMO-1000 Seattle, confirm that the signal propagation path is feasible under the right DX conditions. Three days later, the KOKD-1380 Redfield, South Dakota DX Test was also heard in Newfoundland. Speaking of KOMO, it is now official: the call letters change to KNWN (“Northwest News”) on February 2. And, on air on January 28, KGO-810 San Francisco announced that Jim Bohannon will be heard nightly on the station. The KGO web site confirms this, indicating that his Jimbo Radio syndicated show will be aired from 1900-2200 PST weekday evenings. 540 CBT NL Grand Falls —- The CBC was approved by the CRTC to move this 10KW non- directional station to FM. Traditionally, this means that the AM will simulcast the FM for three months after the FM transmitter has completed its Test phase, as this is the maximum length of time that simulcasting is allowed by the CRTC when a station moves from AM to FM. A CBC Radio One station. 580 CHAH AB Edmonton - Heard quite often in the Arctic part of Europe, and in the Colorado- Utah area, thanks to a DX Trench that routinely delivers low power stations from that area to Edmonton. There have also been two recent reports of CHAH reception in Western Michigan. The South Asian programming reportedly stands out from other stations on 580 kHz. 640 CBN NL St. John’s — Except for morning drive times, all programming is simulcast by CBT-540, which will continue when CBT moves to FM. CBN broadcasts with 10,000 Watts non-directional day and night. 710 CBF-17 QC Lac-Edouard — Has been approved to move to FM. The station is a repeater of CBF-FM-8 in Trois-Rivieres, QC, formerly known as Three Rivers, Quebec, and part of the former CBC French AM network, now known as ICI Premiere. 880 CHOQT AB Edmonton - A strong Hum was noted in Edmonton when trying to Null the station to hear the recent KJJR DX Test, even though there was no Hum in other directions. And it has always been there in subsequent tests, on multiple radios. Despite the fact that no other local station has yet been found to have the same issue. Noteworthy since Bruce Portzer in Seattle received the same kind of hum on his local KOMO-1000 when using a phaser to try and receive KSOO-1000 Sioux Falls, South Dakota when they recently ran all night on day power. 950 CKNB NB Campbellton — Has ben approved to move to FM. 1140 CBJ-2 QC Chapais —- This 40-Watt LPRT of Ici Premiere CBJ-FM Saguenay, Quebec will go off if CBJ-1-FM Chibougamau, Quebec is granted a power increase from 420 to 30,682 Watts, increasing coverage to include Chapais. 1400 CBG NL Gander -The morning drive programming is simulcast by CBT-540, which will continue when CBT moves to FM. CBG broadcasts with 4,000 Watts non-directional day and night. 1400 CBMD QC Chapais - This 40-Watt LPRT of Ici Premiere CBVE-FM Quebec City will go off if CBVC-FM Chibougamau, Quebec is granted a power increase from 420 to 29,939 Watts, increasing coverage to include Chapais. —-—-—DX TESTS --- 1380 KQKD SD Redfield — 1/15 0100 - DX test not heard during two hours of monitoring. (MJ- QRO) 15 1380 KQKD SD Redfield — 1/15 0144-0146 — DX Test. Dial tone, very weak. 0222: rapid sweep 1380 920 1280 KQKD unID unID 1330.68 unID 1470 540 550 550 550 550 550 unID WASG KRAI KBOW KOAC KCRS KCRS tones briefly. (NB-WI) SD Redfield — 1/15 0257:00 -Sweep Tones began, another started at exactly 0258:00, then Morse Code at 0259:00. A short female-sung jingle at 0300:20 was too weak to understand, and may have been the first sign of another station, likely KOTA, heard soon after with CBS News ending at 0304:50 and into a lengthy ‘ED’ ad, which spelt the end of anything sounding like a DX Test from KQKD. But, as the earlier CBS News faded in and out, there was Morse Code fading in at 0301:06 and sweep tones fading in at 0302:47. All this was strongest to the SE. Although there were no Aurora conditions in Edmonton, clearly there was some geomagnetic activity to the South, as 50 kW KRKO is normally unnullable. And, on nights when I can null KRKO, it is KOTA strong to the Southeast. Earlier attempts, when the DX Test first started at 0100, had nothing on 1380 except a local RFI howl that was never heard before, and continued through what I did hear later, most notably making the jingle incomprehensible. Earlier in the evening, Seattle and Vancouver stations were most non-existent, and weak if there at all. This continued through 2300, even when San Francisco’s KNBR and KGO finally showed up, but still weaker than usual, though KFYR-550 and KMON-560 also appeared and were almost as strong as usual. Overall, it seems doubtful KOKD would have been heard at all here under normal DX conditions. (JP-AB-1) ---UNID--- -1/19 0106 — “Coast To Coast” opens the show with electro-dance music and announcement. Suddenly faded out and a sports station (maybe KBAD Las Vegas) took over. Who carries Coast To Coast on this channel? (RA — CA) -1/19 0115-0120 — Utah vs. Fresno State basketball game. Ads, area code 801 mentioned, plus ‘Larry H.

Re-log. 500 Watts nights. 674 miles. (SB-CA) MT Butte — 1/26 0856-0858 — Presumably on day power with market prices for beef, a mention of “K-B-O-W” then an ad for a local Farm Equipment dealer. Disappeared after that to instantly reveal KFYR with PSA or ad from the North Dakota government. Checking that evening, KARI was dominant with little sign of KFYR, which is unusual here. (JP-AB-2) OR Corvallis - 1/19 0058-0101 - Good, on top of the channel, with a spot that mentioned an Oregon area code (503) into their usual Top-of-Hour ID that mentions every station in the Oregon Public Broadcasting network including KOAC by male, into NPR News, followed by local Oregon state news.

Actually logged from top down. 603 is unusual, but at this late hour more likely lower-powered Spain than Romania, Cyprus, Oman. JAN 26 0342 — Not much lately with depressed conditions, mid-winter anomaly? Only detected are 684, 999 and 1107, all likely Spain. I try again at 0710 and detect only these very weakies: 837, 1017(2), 1107, 1215(2). 1017 not a common TA, intriguing, could reactivated A3Z Tonga be participating?

[Hauser-OK] PAN-AMERICAN DX 550 COLOMBIA HJHE R.Nacional, Marinilla JAN 04 0647 — \"Radio Nacional de Colombia\" ID followed by announcements. Fair signal.

All matched the station webstream. Listed at 150 watts nights at 669 miles. New! [Battaglino-CA] VENEZUELA YVKE Mundial, Caracas JAN 17 1040 - ID's as \"Mundial\" with what in my unsophisticated skill sounds like Venezuelan music. This was parallel to web audio. My mom bought an album at the 1964 World's Fair from the Venezuelan pavilion that was in the family stereo mix for years and years. That's my reference for what sounds Venezuelan! Logged as my #2 entry in the 550 frequency weekly challenge. Only WGR and Mundial - slim pickings that week. [Renfrew-NY] JAN 19 0959 — Fair, alone on the channel; live- recorded Venezuelan national anthem sung very slowly, with crowd led by male singer, verse by verse. Finally, Mundial ID and promos at 1002. [Taylor-PE] unID JAN 23 0500 - Over/under R.Rebelde and WDEV; salsa vocal through the hour without announcements.

Fair-good with R. Rebelde nulled. [Krueger-FL] MEXICO unID JAN 26 1159 — Very Mexican ranchera ballad then Spanish talk mixing with multiple domestics. Could be domestic but format doesn't match the Georgia station and Oregon seems more a stretch than Mexico. [Moore-PA] MEXICO XENK Mexico, DF JAN 28 1200 - Had first logged this as an unID for two days. This morning just jumble of gringo stations until 1200:30 when Mexican anthem starts up. Then man/woman with announcements about music programs and Radio 620 ID. Then something about some Catholic program. Into ranchera music.

[Taylor-PE] MEXICO XETAM Cd. Victoria, Tamps. JAN 29 1302 — Announcements followed by \"Romantica\" ID. Fair signal then quickly faded out. [Beu-TX] MEXICO unID JAN 28 1159 —- A woman with Spanish religious talk. Lost the signal for about a minute and then picked out a weak Mexican anthem in the jumble. The 60° BoG is doing great at picking up Mexicans off the back. [Moore-PA] COLOMBIA HJZO R.Nacional, Barranquilla JAN 23 0001 — Fading up to level with WRKO; talk by female and male announcers, short pieces of marching-type music. Then, at 0002 exactly, woman announcer with clear ID, \"Radio Nacional de Colombia.\" [Taylor-PE] NICARAGUA R.Catélica, Managua JAN 23 131 — Pastor with homily, into gospel vocal from the service, parallel station stream.

No clear ID heard but ZBVI presumed based on content. [Taylor-PE] COLOMBIA HJCY Caracol Radio, Bogota JAN 30 1055 — News talk with man and woman announcers, national anthem at 1059 UTC. Good signal. [Beu-TX] 24 830 830.12 870 900 910 910 930 930 940 970 970 970 990 1000 1070 1100 1440 1470 1510 MEXICO XEITE R.Omega, México, DF JAN 23 1158 - End of political talk then R.Omega ID. Brief vocal music bridge followed by full canned ID then into anthem. Mostly over a preacher (WTRU?). No sign of WCCO. Also in on the 28th. [Moore-PA] unID JAN 22 0816 - WCCO with JimBo playback had a low audible heterodyne. Checked 18 hours later, not heard. What could it be, MWOffsets? Nothing further up than .0653 a couple Brazilians. [Hauser-OK] MEXICO XETAR La Voz de Ia Sierra Tarahumara, Guachochi, Chih. JAN 18 1331 - Announcements and messages (\"avisos\") in Spanish, with MST time checks, frequent call letter ID's and \"La Voz de la Sierra Tarahumara\" slogans. Generally fair with some good peaks and no interference. [Wilkins-CO] MEXICO XEW Mexico, DF JAN 23 1158 —- Maybe one in jumble with instrumental music. Then three pips at top of the hour, \"W Radio\" ID, music bridge, possible second ID and into Mexican anthem. Tough copy. [Moore-PA] SAN ANDRES HJMY, RCN Radio, San Andrés, Islas San Andrés y Providencia JAN 212 - Dual men with mostly Colombia news items, national commercials from 1057, \"En casa Colombia, RCN Radio\" into choral national anthem from 1059, RCN ID. First log from this location, and first log since 2018. [Krueger-FL] VENEZUELA YVRQ Caracas JAN 19 0959 — Good; with mentions of Venezuela into operatic/symphonic national anthem. [Taylor- PE] CUBA _R.Reloj, Cienfuegos-Malecén//La Jaiba//Santiago de Cuba JAN 26 0122 — News programming with clock ticks. Fair signal. [Beu-TX] MEXICO XETLA La Voz de Ia Mixteca, Tlaxiaco, Oax. JAN 04 1200 — National anthem followed by \"XETLA La Voz de la Mixteca\" ID. Good signal peaks.[Beu-TX] MEXICO XEQ Ke Buena, México, DF JAN 23 1158 — Mexican music, announcements, anthem then more announcements with \"Ke Buena\" slogan. On top until 1200 when WCPC powered up, then underneath. [Moore-PA] MEXICO XEJ La Jota Mexicana, Cd. Juarez, Chih. JAN 25 1325 - Typical XE music, \"La Jota Mexicana\" ID's. Fair, mixing with XESW and others. [Wilkins-CO] MEXICO XESW R.Madera, Cd. Madera, Chih. JAN 25 1329 - One or two PSA's, then MST time check and full AM/FM ID and \"Radio Madera\" slogan. Fair at best, mixing with others, including XEJ. [Wilkins-CO] MEXICO XERFR Formula 970, México, DF JAN 23 1158 —- Came up with Mexican anthem then canned man/woman with ID. Mixing with WBGG. Local WBLF off air for unknown reason. Heard again on the 28th with WBLE still off. [Moore-PA] CUBA R.Guama, Pinar del Rio-Politécnico JAN 23 1100 — Spanish talk in the mix then came up on top with very nice \"Esta es Guama\" ID with some smooth instrumental music in background. [Moore-PA] MEXICO XEOY R.Mil, México, DF JAN 23 1200 — Presumed with Mexican anthem under WMVP. [Moore-PA] MEXICO XEAGS Estéreo Pop, Acapulco, Gro. JAN 17 0605 — \"Tu musica favorita esta en Estéreo Pop, 103.1 FM, 1070 AM\"; Mexico #200 of about 312 currently on air; good with KNTH,; Gro. #7. [Jeziorski-QRO] COLOMBIA HJAT Caracol Radio, Barranquilla JAN 30 1059 —- Announcements by man and woman followed by national anthem. Fair signal. [Beu-TX] NICARAGUA R.Maranatha, Managua JAN 21 1103 — Telco-ish audio Spanish man preacher up a few times over WGIG, parallel mytuner-radio,com stream. Checked for this right after logging RCN San Andrés, Colombia while the loop was in the same position. First time logged despite many tries back in the old Clearwater, FL location. [Krueger-FL] MEXICO XEAI R.Formula, México, DF JAN 23 1059 — Truncated choral anthem beginning at tune-in, probable ID but not copied with co-channel, into Spanish preacher (this on a Sunday morning), paralleled to station stream. This is the unidentified I've been trying to ID for quite awhile. [Krueger-FL] MEXICO XEQI Opus 1510/R.Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, NL JAN 25 0715 — Long classical violin and piano movement. WRTH 2022 brands as R.Nuevo Leon now (not Opus 1510). Checking the station stream, not parallel (though also with classical music, but a piano and orchestral piece), but when checking their XHQI-FM 102.1 MHz affiliate stream, a match. So at least at times, XEQI is simulcasting the FM, which also at least at times is separate programming. Always way under WLAC. But are they still Opus 1510 slogan, or R.Nuevo Leon? Both, it would seem. I stuck with the XEQI stream across the 0800 hour and finally, after the classical movement ended, several mentions of Opus, as in \"Opus, Radio Nuevo Leon\" as well as separate \"Opus 1510\" and \"Radio Nuevo Leén\" mentions, and a more formal XHQI-FM ID. 25 Respective websites still branding as Opus 1510 and R.Nuevo Leon. State government owned. [Krueger-FL] 1620 CUBA R.Rebelde, La Habana-El Sapo//Amancio//El Coco//Guantanamo-Antiguo JAN 24 0223-0240 — Poor, underneath KSMH and local unlisted emergency radio (3.5 mi. away) looping announcement; an operatic female singer in Spanish and then later a male singer in the same style. Both were parallel to the station's webstream. MW List has two Rebelde's listed on 1620 kHz. New! [Battaglino-CA] JAN 28 0758 — Fair with synchro echo; cuckoo sounder and news. [Conti-NH] 1620 MEXICO XECSCGU Creo, Guachochi, Chih. JAN 24 0126 — MST time checks and \"Yo creo\" between songs in Spanish; poor under WTAW,; Chih. #11. [Jeziorski-QRO] 1620 U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS WDHP Frederiksted JAN 28 0559 — Mostly under R. Rebelde; promo for Facebook Live and 103.5, soca music. [Conti-NH] 1670.046 MEXICO XEFCR Reynosa, Tamps. JAN 10 1253 — Tentative, as no ID heard here but undoubtedly the same station heard by others on this offset frequency. Back-to-back English songs (nostalgia and \"lite\" oldies), with no ID's or announcements whatsoever up to 1330 fadeout (which would fit Reynosa). Heard on several occasions around the same time. Maybe still testing? [Wilkins-CO] JAN 23 0700 — As reported by Terry Krueger in previous IDXD columns, this signal has been playing English-language pop oldies continuously for a couple of months, consistently off-frequency. At night they overwhelm XEANAH with their bad audio. I have no way of confirming that this is really XEFCR testing; while Mexican listeners have said that's who it is, I'm still waiting for certainty and not conjecture. On a couple of occasions this week the signal was apparently off the air. [Jeziorski-QRO] TRANS-ATLANTIC DX 1422 JAPAN JORF Yokohama JAN 17 1255 - Technically an unID here but probably the one, with 50 kW, heard often on the west coast. Snippets of audio but not enough to determine language, although the cadence seemed Japanese. One short and one long time pip heard at 1300. Been chasing this one for a long time. Unusual conditions, with many TP hets heard this day only on the upper half of the AM band. [Wilkins-CO] CONTRIBUTORS Stephanie Battaglino, Palm Desert CA; Perseus with Jaguar Pro, Wellbrook ALA1530LNP and ALA1530PE at 25-30 ft., WALION/W7IUV Phaser/Pre-Amp.

Gnureported Domestic Stations One station - KMCD-1570 — was reported to DDXD for the first time this issue since at least Volume 67 (1999-2000). We are now down to 241 full-service U.S. and Canadian stations (100 Watts or more) that have not been reported during this time. The most recent update of the list was in issue 88-18, but an updated copy is available on request from NRCDXNews@gmail.com. When we started doing this a number of years ago, we had way over 500 stations on the list, so these last few are going to be tough ... but we’re all waiting for news of hearing these stations, so if you can log one please report it next time! 26 Musings of the Members Linda Brodsky zekesgm@gmail.com Non-electronic submissions: Send to Publisher (see AM Switch for address) Next deadline: February 11, 2022 Denny Adkins, KE8KLH, Huntington, WV Digital World. It's time to face the facts. For all of its past glory, which is considerable, analog is a stiff. It was my good fortune to be introduced to the digital world by one of these advanced fellows. Wow! Things sure have changed. The NRC is a precious antique. The old men tell me the early days of AM radio was a time of endless fascination. New stations everywhere, testing uncrowded frequencies being fertile ground for distance listening. Denny, you're living in the past. Shucks, I reckon. My favorite radio fantasy is I imagine myself chief engineer at KWKH in the great days of the Louisiana Hayri"
