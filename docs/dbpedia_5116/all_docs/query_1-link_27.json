        "text": "VC INTERVIEW | VC Artist Rolston String Quartet Gives Their Expert Advice for Young Ensembles\n\nThe Violin Channel had the chance to catch up with VC Artist Rolston String Quartet, to get their perspective on what it takes to be a successful string quartet.\n\nThis summer, after concerts at Canada’s Elora Festival, they will perform a riveting program at An Appalachian Summer Festival on July 26. Tickets can be found here.\n\nWhat are your most significant words of wisdom for up-and-coming chamber groups hoping to build a thriving career?\n\n-Agree upon a vision for the future of the ensemble.\n\nBeing a musician/artist means constantly searching for what can be done better. Make sure you are all on the same page about your commitment to that search and the philosophies that drive it.\n\n-Build a social media presence as soon as possible.\n\n-When you hit a few bumps in the road, figure out how to navigate them in a constructive way. Rather than get discouraged, look at the challenges as a springboard for the group’s development. Keep a clear head and see everything as an opportunity.\n\nWhat are your favorite parts of traveling together? Any tips for groups that are embarking on their first tour?\n\nExploring different food scenes is a fun perk for us! When you first start to travel in a group, it’s easy to choose rehearsing over exploring a new place. Of course, it’s important to sound good, always. But what’s also important is creating memories other than rehearsals and concerts. The amazing meal you had together or the beautiful gallery you all saw will be the things that stick in your head. Creating experiences makes the tour feel a little more alive.\n\nHow important do you think winning competitions is in regards to a quartet’s success?We think it’s very important. Regardless of the success, you grow as a group. Entering a competition forces you to craft an identity as a group, one that is so crystal clear. You want a jury or audience member to walk away and say, “I understand what that quartet was about. I understand their unique take on music.” You also get exposed to audiences and presenters, and it’s always good to just put yourself out there.\n\nWhen you’re preparing for a competition, you’re super “in shape” musically. Your ears are at an all-time high, as you come in contact with many other groups who have also pushed themselves to the brink. It forces you to constantly evaluate yourselves.\n\nAlthough it’s not a natural situation of any sort, it’s beautiful to hear all these different people playing things they’ve prepared. They’ve gone through a similar scenario and it forces everyone to go through a state of hypergrowth.\n\nWould you say it is a similar situation at a summer festival?\n\nIt’s a similar place where you can get a lot of work done. At a summer festival, you spend quite a lot of time together and really hone what you’re about. Competitions and festivals are similar in that they are goal driven, but with festivals, there is a little less pressure and competitive spirit. You can set goals and enjoy yourself at the same time.\n\nThis will be your first time at An Appalachian Summer Festival. How do you go about choosing a program for a summer festival such as this one?\n\nFirstly, we pick music we like. We are currently working through all of Hayden’s Op. 33 String Quartets. At this concert on the 26th, we chose to play No. 2 and 4. From there, we tried to pick music that fits with those two works.\n\nOften we’ll choose pieces that are structurally similar. All of the pieces on the Appalachian program seem to sprout from a seed. Each piece has a central, unifying motif that the entire piece sprouts out of. The A. R. Thomas and Beethoven employ a really crafted, structural approach to compositions, almost architectural. We think great composers populate their music with a lot of details and a sense of realism, but they’re all in the same framework of physics. There is a sense of verisimilitude. When we work on pieces like these, it makes our rehearsal process really joyous.\n\nYou’ve included a piece by living female composer Augusta Read Thomas. Can you tell us about that piece and how you found it?\n\nAugust Read Thomas is a good friend of ours! She composed this piece for our quartet a few years ago. It is a musical depiction of the mosaics by award-winning mosaic artist Isaiah Zagar. It’s a really good distillation of what we like to do as a quartet, which is very crafted phrasing. She creates these cells and, just like a mosaic, puts them together like puzzle pieces between the different voices of the quartet. It starts out super fragmented, but by the time you get to the second movement, it becomes somewhat like a fanfare.\n\nIt was being written during the pandemic, so when we did collaborate with her on the piece, it was over Zoom. She made some adjustments based on our playing, but for the most part, her first draft didn’t need many changes.\n\nWhen we talked with her about her compositional process, she said that she used other art forms. She dances to her music, paints it, etc.\n\nHow important do you think it is for a younger quartet to be working with living composers?\n\nWe think it’s really vital. There are so many different ways that music can sound and composers really have such a wide range of possibilities right now in terms of like the type of music that they’re writing. So when you work with a lot of composers, you learn a lot of the different ways that music can exist.\n\nAlso, you learn the certain musical language of the composer and each one teaches you something different about your instrument, or about the way phases can put together, notes combined, intervals used, etc.\n\nThen, you can apply this new knowledge to your readings of Beethoven or Brahms or Haydn. You can use what you’re learning from the contemporary composers to better understand the older ones. As a musician, it can be a meaningful interaction to go between these eras, yet understanding that the music is crafted from the same basic tools.\n\nAdditionally, it is keeping the tradition alive of working with composers. Composers like Beethoven and Brahms would work with the violinists and musicians of their time. By interacting with composers of our day, we are creating the artistic language of the time we live in.\n\nIt’s the same as any great art form. The composers that are alive today are part of a tradition of composition that takes place over centuries. We’re lucky to be living in a time where we can look at very, very old and then very new music, and then find commonalities/differences.\n\nYou recently released your debut album “Souvenirs.” Any “Do’s” and “Don’ts” for up-and-coming ensembles getting ready to record their first album?\n\n-Find a good recording engineer!\n\n-Sometimes, you can get bogged down during a session, so find ways to keep things fresh.\n\n-Listen back to the recording that you just made while you’re still in the studio so you have time to make changes if you want. For example, if you hate how the mics are set up, it’s better to know and change it right then, rather than have the CD come out and realize it later.\n\n-Be very involved with the editing process. In a lot of recording studio situations, you can get self-conscious and nervous about doing everything right. But don’t worry too much, because lots can be edited.\n\n-Once again, it comes down to having a shared vision with your quartet-mates. Recording music that means a lot to you as a group is important. Just have fun with it!\n\nWhat is your social media strategy? It seems like you try to balance the serious things with more fun posts!\n\nOne of us runs the social media accounts, but it is definitely a collaborative process. Anybody can post whatever as long as everyone else is okay with it. And usually, we know what the others will and won’t be okay with posting.\n\nIn general, social media is a great way to engage with people even if they’re far away. We try to mix up the content for our followers and post stuff that we’d enjoy seeing on our own feeds.\n\nWhat’s one of your best memories together?Our recent tour to Germany was a lot of fun. It was seven concerts in about ten days. After not traveling as much due to COVID-19, it meant a lot to us to be able to spend a substantial amount of time on the road. Also, it was right after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and we were meeting some Ukrainian refugees that had made their way to Germany. We included a Ukrainian hymn in the program and it made the whole experience a lot more personal and real. Some of the refugees we met were actually living in the same hotel that we were briefly staying at.\n\nBeing able to play music amidst the atrocity of the current situation made us realize the power of music and the distillation of what music is capable of. For the refugees attending the concerts, we hope they got something positive out of it.\n\nTo check out the Rolston String Quartet’s upcoming engagements, click here.\n\nBroadway Star and Tony Award Winner Renée Elise Goldsberry to Perform in Boone\n\nJazz great Esperanza Spalding brings Grammy Award-Winning musical explorations to Boone\n\nAn Appalachian Summer Festival Announces 2022 Season\n\nMarty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives, Renée Elise Goldsberry, esperanza spalding, Postmodern Jukebox, Boz Scaggs, and more!\n\nBOONE, NC— Appalachian State University’s annual summer arts event, An Appalachian Summer Festival (AASF), proudly celebrates its 38th season July 1-30, 2022.

An Appalachian Summer Festival began in 1984 as a chamber music series, and retains strong roots in classical music, combined with a variety of other programming geared to almost every artistic taste and preference. With an audience of 28,000, the festival has been named one of the “Top Twenty Events in the Southeast” by the Southeast Tourism Society in recent years.\n\nCorporate Sponsors:\n\nBonnie and Jamie Schaefer, McDonald’s of Boone, Mast General Store, Goodnight Brothers, Boone Area Visitors Bureau, SkyBest Communications, Appalachian Home Care LLC, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Vincent Properties, PEAK Insurance, PNC Bank, Appalachian State University Bookstore, Peabody’s Wine & Beer Merchants, Creekside Electronics, Courtyard by Marriott, Chetola Resort, Hampton Inn & Suites, Holiday Inn Express-Boone, and The Horton Hotel.\n\nMedia Sponsors:\n\nWBTV, WCYB, PBS North Carolina, Our State Magazine, Creative Loafing Charlotte, Yes!

In July of 2019, festival patrons Nancy and Neil Schaffel announced a $1 million dollar gift to the fund, framing the commitment as a challenge to other festival supporters by requiring that their gift be “matched” dollar-for-dollar by other donors, over the course of a five-year period.\n\nThe festival is currently nearing the $1 million target for the Schaffels’ gift, with approximately $88,000 to go. If the target is reached, a total of $2 million will be added to the fund, bringing it to the $4 million level. The effort received a significant boost in October 2020, when festival donor Christine Petti stepped forward with a multiyear pledge of $500,000 to be applied toward the challenge target. The gift from Petti, combined with other generous gifts from festival supporters, has allowed the festival to approach the finish line. Festival organizers hope to reach the challenge goal this summer.\n\nAn Appalachian Summer Festival, an annual celebration of the performing and visual arts presented by Appalachian State University every summer, is acclaimed for presenting the “best of both worlds”: world-class music, dance, theatre, film and visual arts programming typically found in larger metropolitan areas, but at affordable prices. The festival is set in the beautiful High Country of North Carolina, on and around the campus of App State.\n\n“Donors such as Nancy, Neil and Chris are passionate about ensuring access to quality arts programming for all,” notes Denise Ringler, Director of Arts Engagement and Cultural Resources at Appalachian State. “Their commitment will make it possible the festival to continue in perpetuity, enriching lives of residents across our region for generations to come.”\n\nThe 2022 festival features Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives, Boz Scaggs: Out of the Blues Tour 2022, Tony winner Renée Elise Goldsberry (Hamilton), Postmodern Jukebox: The Grand Reopening Tour, esperanza spalding in Concert, MOMIX: Alice, and the Eastern Festival Orchestra, as well as chamber music, theatre, lectures, international films, a young artist competition, outdoor sculpture walk and a variety of visual arts exhibitions.\n\nAbout An Appalachian Summer Festival\n\nPresented by Appalachian State University’s Office of Arts & Cultural Programs, this annual celebration of the performing and visual arts is held every July in venues across the university campus, and features an eclectic, diverse mix of music, dance, theatre, visual arts and film programming.

King St., Boone.\n\nYou can experience diverse artwork by nationally and internationally renowned artists and listen to music by The Mercury Dames.\n\nThe event is free, but registration is required here . Covid-19 protocols and procedures will be in place.\n\nComedian Paula Poundstone will perform live and online Saturday.\n\nThen on Saturday, July 3, at 5 and 8 p.m., you can laugh your elbow off with humorist, author, and comedian Paula Poundstone at the Schaefer Center for the Performing Arts, 733 Rivers St., Boone, and online.\n\nPoundstone is known for her clever, observational humor and spontaneous wit. Poundstone continues as a panelist on NPR’s “Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me!,” and is recognized in innumerable lists, documentaries, and literary compendiums noting influential stand-up comedians of our time.\n\nShe can be heard weekly as the host of the comedy podcast “Nobody Listens to Paula Poundstone.” She has voiced several animated characters, including “Forgetter Paula” in the Academy Award-winning feature film “Inside Out,” has appeared on numerous TV shows, including The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and has filed commentaries for CBS Sunday Morning.\n\nPoundstone’s July 3 performance marks the first live and in-person App Summ Fest event since the Punch Brothers took the Schaefer Center stage on Aug. 1, 2019. And she is looking forward to sloughing off the existential Zoom-induced pains that have tormented citizens of the world since March of 2020.\n\nWhen Artzenstuff caught up with Poundstone by phone at her home in Santa Monica, California, she was surrounded, as usual, by cats.\n\n“They come over to get petted more when I sit on the floor,” she said. “I have 10. I just got two more kittens.” So it was no joke when Time magazine listed her HBO special, “Cats, Cops and Stuff,” as one of The 5 Funniest Stand-Up Specials Ever.\n\nPoundstone said that she learned to adapt to new ways of delivering comedy during the pandemic.\n\n“I wasn’t able to make ends meet, but I’ve been able to get them closer together,” she said. “Normally, I work in theaters on weekends,”\n\nWhen that kind of work came to a screeching halt, she still felt grateful.\n\n“In the darkest days, I remained one of the most fortunately people in the country,” she said. “Before the pandemic, I didn’t notice the price of cat food or gas, but that changed.\n\n“The good news is I had a podcast in place – podcasting is like panning for gold; it can take a long time to even get in the black – and we did reach that point during the pandemic,” she said. “For a number of months, I did a mini-podcast – ‘The French Trump Presidential Press Conference.’ I had friends who played reporters. It was part of my healing process. It was painful to have to watch him. I had a four-year stomach ache.”\n\nNow, she said, barring the COVID variants knocking us off our horses, “I’m trying to go back out. I’ll continue my podcast, ‘Nobody Listens to Paula Poundstone.’ It’s the funniest, most healing show that I can possibly do. I do believe that laughter is part of that healing that we have to do.\n\n“I had a woman on to talk about vermiculture. So I started a worm bin, and I’m planning on selling the castings. After all these years of taking care of emptying litter boxes of animal wastes, I finally have some that will profit me.”\n\nPoundstone said that while growing up she went through phases of wanting to be this and that, and that her comedy influences included Carol Burnett, Mary Tyler Moore, Lucille Ball, and women on “Saturday Night Live” like Gilda Radner, and, of course, Lily Tomlin, who performed at App Summ Fest in 2019.\n\n“I’m nothing like any of them except that I like the response of laughter,” she said.\n\nBeing funny has taken Poundstone both to the depths of people’s hearts and to the heights of society.\n\n“For many years, I’d do meet-and-greets after a show – hug, handshake, photo – and on many occasions – people will say things like ‘My son died a year ago, and this is the first time I have left the house, and I laughed for hours.'”\n\nThe heights include validation from her comic heroes.\n\n“I did fundraiser and a tribute to Lily Tomlin,” she said. “At some point, I was on stage at a mic, and Lily was sitting on a stool behind me. I was tributing her – in jokes of course, and Lily was roaring with laughter.”\n\nPoundstone was the first person to do backstage coverage at the Emmys.\n\n“The idea came from my manager. … It was just joyous. I didn’t do anything scripted. I went to a rehearsal – but it was really to figure out where to stand – I can’t tell time on stage so they had a stagehand who would crawl across the stage and tug on my pant leg.”\n\nThat night, she said, everybody was having so much fun that they called off the stagehand, and the producer said, “Let her go!”\n\n“Every night something fun happens,” she said.\n\nAnd she’s better informed that one might think from listening to her hilariously baffled performances on “Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me!”\n\n“I’ve been watching the news hour every night for 40 years,” she said.\n\nShe has some advice for artists, too.\n\n“Do what’s in your heart. It’s the key to the whole thing. There’s more than one reason to do any kind of art. You feel so great when you hit that right note. You feel it through your whole body,” she said. “In negative times, you’ve got to split the difference, but I believe if you do what in your heart, it will take you a long way.”\n\nTickets for Poundstone – $40 in person and $15 livestream (8 p.m. only) – are at 800-841-2787, 828-262-4046, or AppSummer.org .\n\nAll events this season, with the exception of Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit, will be performed without an intermission.
