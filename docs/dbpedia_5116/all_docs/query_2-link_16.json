FCC expected to ap- prove agreement, allowing Boston-Philadelphia station swap (p. 1). MEANING OF FTC-RATING CONSENTS is, so far, fairly simple: there'll be no sweeping changes made in rating methodology or reporting, but there'll be lots of new explanatory material for buyers (p. 2). LEE IRKED BY MST UHF CRITIQUE, disagrees with latter's con- clusion that uhf is markedly inferior to vhf (p. 2.) REGULATORY AGENCY STREAMLINING PROPOSED by top-level U.S. Administrative Conference in report to President. Fewer FCC hearings among major recommendations (p. 3). Consumer Electronics PUBLIC VIEWS ELECTRONICS VIA BROKERS' EYES: Endless stream of analyses by stock brokerages represent principal source of information about electronics industry & companies for general public (p. 6). RCA-PHILCO PACT heralds new 'era of good feeling,' ending last major anti-trust litigation against RCA; agreement expected to aid color development (p. 7). FM SALES CLIMB continues: More than 3 million receiving de- vices of all kinds sold in U.S. last year; this year's total may reach 4 million (p. 8). MORE WINTER DROP-INS — New sets by Magnavox, Emerson, GE, Philco & Symphonic (p. 8). RECORD PHONO YEAR likely in 1962 as result of big Nov. gain; factory sales may reach peak of 4.8 million, distributor sales 4.5 million (p. 9). MORE TINYVISION & COLOR among imports being shown in Chicago; 2 battery portables from Sharp, 4V'2-in. flashlight-battery set and 14- & 17-in. color from Delmonico (p. 9). RCA-NBC & PHILCO FINALLY SHAKE HANDS: Though there's lots of sticky & time-consuming legalities to go through, ancient battle between RCA-NBC & Philco is ended. With agreements announced last week to end patent litigation and with Philco stopping fight for NBC's Ch. 3 Philadelphia (WRCV-TV), it's just a matter of time before WRCV-TV's license is renewed by FCC and station is swapped with RKO's WNAC-TV Boston. Windup could come in 3-4 months. (For significance of patent agreement, see report in Consumer Electronics section, p. 7.) FCC will have questions to settle before affair is finally wrapped up — but few people believe it will refuse to approve end of fight. Philco agrees to withdraw its application for Ch. 3, NBC paying Philco legal expenses incurred in prosecuting it; sum hasn't been mentioned yet, but $500,000 is considered good guess. Both agree to accept whatever figure FCC decides is \"reasonable.\" This withdrawal is unusual, first time a contestant seeks to pull out of fight for license renewal, getting paid for expenses. All other withdrawals have been where new CP is involved. Heretofore, theory behind FCC's approval of payment for withdrawal is that it hastens start of new station. Case isn't concluded when FCC approves Philco pullout. It must consider testimony to date on Philco charges that NBC isn't fit licensee because of past anti-trust behavior (pressuring Westinghouse into station swap, etc.). However, no one visualizes Commission holding NBC unfit — which would mean loss of all its 0-&-0 stations. It's up to Review Board to pass on Philco withdrawal first. Then, Chief Examiner Cunningham will 2— TELEVISION DIGEST JANUARY 7, 1963 issue initial decision, or turn everything over to full Commission for its decision. It isn't known which will be done. There may still be some testimony to come, regarding NBC qualifications, from William Bauer, retired FCC patent counsel who spent many years attacking RCA patent policies. Papers will be filed by Philco & NBC this week, and it's expected they'll urge these public-interest reasons for calling off fight: (1) NBC can more quickly comply with court decree ordering it to dispose of Philadelphia stations. (2) Philco can devote more corporate energy to building company, increasing employ- ment, etc. FCC can't wrap up whole affair with lick & promise. Court of Appeals had ordered Commission to conduct hearing on Philco's allegations against NBC, asserting charges were too serious to ignore — after FCC had twice thrown out Philco's protest. WHAT FTC-RATING CONSENT DEAL MEANS: Buyers and users of ratings, both national and local, went into Madison Ave. tizzy late lost week when news of consent orders signed between FTC and 3 leading research firms — Pulse, C-E-I-R (ARB) and Nielsen — began circulating. Research companies admitted bom- bardment of calls from agencies, station reps, advertisers, film distributors and networks. What callers generally learned was that there'll be no immediate, sweeping changes caused by settlement of FTC's probe of head-counting in TV & radio. This was situation-at-a-glonce : (1) Present research techniques of all three firms will continue, largely unchanged, as regards sam- pling methods, final reports, etc. (2) There'll be \"fuller disclosure\" of how reports were arrived at, that figures are \"estimates\" and not precise numbers, and what degree of error may be involved. There'll be more complete cover text (as in case of ARB) and added footnote-type detail (as in case of Nielsen & Pulse). (3) Burden of honesty has been transferred, to large extent, from research firms to actual buyers. In effect, research firms will tell customers : \"Here's your report and here's what it really means. How you use figures is up to you.\" This is old industry problem, veteran researchers told us, with nothing new added. Research vp of one TV network told us : \"We've always known exactly what we were buying from research companies, so FTC is hardly protecting us. Abuse of ratings is not in computation but in application.\" Added the research head of a station-group-owned rep firm : \"Most TV people usually just want to see a number, preferably one bigger than the competition's.\" Research firms were glad to be rid of FTC complaints which, as ARB put it, \"appear unnecessarily strict in their requirement for minute detail.\" (More informally, a Nielsen official told us: \"What FTC said would hold against any sampling operation — including those of Dept, of Commerce.\") All 3 research firms, however, were quick to cite that \"consent does not constitute admission of wrongdoing.\" Whether consents will harm individual research firms, or will cause basic changes in research meth- ods under pressure from buyers who have studied FTC complaints, remains to be seen. Some N.Y. talk was generated, for example, by FTC charge that Pulse \"adjusts 'Sets-in-Use' figures upward by 20% for morning programs and 40% for afternoon and evening programs without research to justify such adjustment,\" and that Nielsen and ARB didn't disclose \"number or percentage of a sample that refuses or fails to respond or co- operate.\" Generally, rating users were waiting to see full details of consent agreements signed by rating firms with which they do business, and to study them before altering present plans. LEE IRKED BY MST UHF CRITIQUE: Uhf's staunchest advocate, FCC Comr. Lee, last week made it clear he believes Maximum Service Telecasters has badly mauled Commission's report on uhf receiver performance of N.Y. Commission had come up with a right bright summary of uhf results (Vol. 2:57 p3), but MST Exec. Dir. Lester Lindow said uhf is considerably less effective than FCC made it appear. FCC had found uhf as good as vhf, with indoor antennas, except in 10% of cases. MST said figure should be 50% — basing conclusion on householders' evaluation of picture, whereas FCC had used NEW SERIES VOL. 3, No. 1 TELEVISION DIGEST— 3 technicians' judgment to get the 10%. Said Lee: \"The FCC report attaches little or no relative significance (to householders' reports vis-a-vis those of the trained technician for the stated reason that it was found very difficult to educate the family circle as to the purpose of the test, to properly operate the receiver, to adjust indoor antennas and to understand the difference between program quality & picture quality.\" Then Lee digs in: \"But ignoring this aspect for the moment, it is apparent that householders did not record this marked superiority for vhf when one considers that 428 householders rated both Ch. 2 & Ch. 7 pictures to be Grade 3 or better, while 406 householders rated Ch. 31 pictures to be Grade 3 or better. If this supports your contention that householders rate vhf to be 50% superior to uhf, I should have failed 6th grade arithmetic.\" , As for fact FCC had 78% of sets within 10 miles of transmitter, instead of scattering them uniformly ! out to 25 miles, Lee said purpose of test was to measure reception in highly congested area. In light of fact MST helped FCC plan tests, Lee said: \"I am greatly surprised that you now raise substantial questions as to the procedures used and of the analysis of results. This is particularly disturbing to me in view of your organization's participation in an advisory capacity and in view of our staff's conscien- tious endeavor to conduct the experiment objectively and as efficiently as possible.\" Lee doesn't let it go there: \"In the conclusion of your analysis you state that uhf service is not a substitute for vhf but rather that our report shows the need for vhf & uhf to exist side by side with each other in the same communities. I fail to perceive the manner in which our data would infer any such conclusion. Our tests were designed to obtain information and little else. We had no thought of installing a super uhf station in New York with the primary purpose of making direct comparisons with vhf. It was expected that less than perfect service would be found on uhf but since we have no absolute measure of what is or is not satisfactory, comparisons were required to be made with vhf to find out what the relation might be.\" REGULATORY AGENCY STREAMLING PROPOSED: Long-awaited recommendations of blue- ribbon U.S. Administrative Conference have gone to President Kennedy, are available for industry's analy- sis. Group was established by executive order in April 1961, to scrutinize procedures of govt, regulatory bodies, devise program for improving efficiency. First recommendation by Conference was that it be established as permanent body by law, with authority to study any agency's procedures, submit findings to President, Congress, etc., as it sees fit. Until law could be passed, group called on President to continue present Conference for 2 years. Major FCC problem, according to Conference, is too many hearings. Among leading suggestions: (1) Reduce number of comparative hearings by establishing system of priorities under which same appli- cants would be automatically preferred over others. With 2 or more equally qualified applicants, devise new method of determining winner — e.g., by time of filing. (2) Amend Communications Act to give FCC authority to assure that proposed purchaser of a station will have qualifications equal to those of original grantee. (3) Give hearing examiners maximum authority to decide interlocutory issues in hearing cases, permitting no reviews of such ruling unless agreed to by examiner handling case, chief examiner, or FCC. (4) Commission should publicize & allow some form of public discussion in its formulation of programming criteria. Ex parte communications received considerable discussion. Conference concluded single code of behavior covering all agencies isn't feasible, suggested each formulate own code. Delegation of decision-making authority also was urged. Conference recommended initial deci- sions be considered final without agency review, unless party involved could show decision contained error or prejudice. Witnesses' right to counsel should be broadened, group suggested. In hearings or other agency proceedings, counsel should be allowed more participation in representation of clients. Persons appearing by request or permission should be granted same right to counsel as subpoened witnesses. Conference recommended. Copies of report & accompanying letter to President will be available this week from Exec. Secy. Webster P. Moxson, Dir., Office of Administrative Procedure, Dept, of Justice, Washington 25. 4— TELEVISION DIGEST JANUARY 7, 1963 CURRENT CAPSULES There were 2 operating TV satellites in orbit for first time last week, after defects in both NASA's RCA-built Relay and AT&T's Telstor were corrected and successful TV transmissions conducted — both on Jan. 3. Relay, whose power supply had not been functioning sufficiently for wide-bond transmission, cor- rected itself as expected, and 24-min. test pattern was sent & received in U.S., followed by \"very clear\" reception in France Jan. 4. Telstar's command-decoder was successfully diagnosed and treated from ground with \"trick\" signal which triggered it into working again. Test was followed by live appearance Jan. 4 of Bell Labs' scientists explaining situation. Discussion was picked up by ground stations in England, France & Italy, and was followed by pictures of French & British communications officials, received in U.S. Operation of Telstar was reported \"as good as ever.\" CBS has gone to Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit (N.Y.) to contest FCC's decision that original affiliate compensation plan violates Sec. 3.658(a) of Commission rules (Vol. 2:45 p4). Appeal is not on FCC's \"tenta- tive\" ruling that CBS's amended plan is still illegal, violating Sec. 3.658(e). CBS contends that FCC is trying to regulate rates, something it isn't empowered to do: that even if Sec. 3.658(a) were applicable, plan didn't \"penalize\" affiliates for carrying other networks' programs; that \"in the guise of interpreting an existing rule, the Commission in substance promulgated a new rule when it held that the CBS TV Network compensation plan was unlawful\" without going through proper rule-making procedure. Order for 15 color-TV Eidophor large-screen projection systems has been received by Theatre Network TV Inc., U.S. distributor for the Swiss-made instruments, in what TNT described as biggest single order for large-screen projection TV in history. Units will be used at U.S. Air Force bases in visual flight simulators being built by Link div. of GPI. The units sold operate on field-sequential color system and will be used in connection with new field- sequential camera developed by Compagnie Francaise Thomson-Houston. TNT has also developed lab models of Eidophor equipment designed to accommodate compatible NTSC color system, but these were not involved in Air Force contract. Pres.

Commission denied request by Clyde Community TV for waiver to allow it to accept $500 donation from WIBW-TV, whose programs it planned to rebroadcast. Extension of a station’s service into new area by translator, whether licensed dii’ectly or financially supported, would result in increased coverage at relatively little cost and with no responsibility for meet- ing needs of new community, FCC said. Chmn. Minow & Comr. Hyde dissented. Revocation of license of radio WBMT Black Mountain, N.C. is proposed by FCC. Commission charged o^vners with misrepresenting financial qualifications & legal status, concealing fact that partnership had been dissolved, con- struction & operation of station by persons other than dissolved partnership, false affidavits & statements.

FINANCE PUBLIC VIEWS ELECTRONICS VIA BROKERS' EYES: For large segment of public, principal source of information about electronics industry — and evaluation of individual companies — is endless stream of sur- veys & analyses offered by major stock brokers. For outside look at electronics industry, as seen through eyes of financial specialists, we culled Nov.-Dee. offerings in our weekly \"reports & comments\" listings, came up with these observations: \"Consumer electronics industry is having one of its most profitable years in more than a decade,\" re- ported Thomson & McKinnon, \"Consumer buying, stimulated by the acceptance of color TV, could reach $2.2 billion in 1962, compared with $2.08 billion in 1961. We project a further although modest gain in consumer electronics volume in 1963. Entertainment communications systems will probably account for the bulk of vol- ume, but other electronically-controlled equipment, such as appliances, will command a rising percentage of consumer spending.\" Broker noted that color TVs \"are being aggressively pushed,\" concluded 1962 sales \"could reach 400,000 vs. 175,000 last year, and the figure might reach 800,000 in 1963.\" Electronics buying by govt., Thomson & McKinnon said, has \"been estimated at approximately $8.2 billion for 1962, some 17% over 1961.\" With \"huge growth of the space effort\" total \"govt, demand could rise by 50% in the next 3 years.\" RCA, analyzed Shields & Co., \"will consider 1962 as a year of progress — mainly in the improvement of its profit margins.\" RCA sales in 1951-61 period increased 144%, but \"net earnings have shown only a 10% rise.\" However, Shields emphasized, \"after years of steadily rising volume but imchanged or declining earn- ings, RCA reversed this trend in the first 9 months of 1962,\" when net income per share rose 46% on a 16% sales gain. Explaining reasons \"behind this improvement & why we feel this will continue,\" Shields noted \"color TV is now in a money-making stage, era of extraordinary development expenditures seems to be com- ing to an end,\" data-processing costs have been reduced. \"It is estimated that RCA lost 60^ a share on data- processing in 1960 and 80?; in 1961.\" Losses in 1962 \"will be under 40^ and a breakeven point should be reached in 1963.\" Looking ahead. Shields noted \"good possibility\" of per-share earnings of \"$3.15 or better\" in 1963 (vs. estimated $2.75 in 1962) & \"possibly $4 per share by 1964.\" Sylvonig, noted Dean Witter & Co., has been a drag on GT&E earnings, but better times ore coming. \"While considerable time will be required, the GT&E management is intent on improving Sylvania's profit- ability and has set 4.5-5% of sales as a minimum profit margin goal,\" broker said. Sylvania's profit margin slipped to 1.1% in 1961 from 2.9% in 1960. Dean Witter emphasized that GT&E \"has just projected 1962 net for Sylvania will be up some 40-45% — to around $8 million from $5.6 million in 1961, which included a $1 million surplus adjustment.\" Sylvania accounts for some 60% of GT&E's manufacturing group sales and divides its volume roughly 70% commercial & 30% defense. Concluded Dean Witter: \"GT&E is in good financial condi- tion. At the end of 1961, the current ratio of assets to liabilities was 1.39:1. . . . Sylvania had a current ratio of 2.7:1.\" Sylvania, \"for the future, offers a twofold opportunity — above average growth in the dynamic electronics markets & improved profits through potentially higher margins.\" Zenith, \"aided by its emphasis on high quality products, is the largest maker of TV sets,\" reported Thomson & McKinnon. \"Despite keen competition Zenith accounts for some 20% of industry volume.\" Broker noted experimental operation of \"Phonevision,\" termed prospects \"imcertain,\" said \"profits might not accrue to Zenith for several years.\" Conclusion: \"Zenith's record of outperforming the industry & its bright long range outlook makes it attractive for purchase. Finances are strong. Capitalization is simple, no funded debt, no preferred stock, only 9,038,177 shares of capital stock.\" Motorola \"restricted results in 1961\" through entry into new fields but increased its \"potential for the NEW SERIES VOL. 3, No. 1 TELEVISION DIGEST— 7 long pull,\" Thomson & McKinnon noted, adding: \"For example. Motorola has become one of the 4 principal companies in semiconductor physics & these lines may account for more than $50 million in sales in 1962.\" Consumer electronics at one time comprised bulk of Motorola sales but \"now account for about half of vol- ume.\" Conclusion: \"Share net for 1962 is estimated at $3 vs. $2.36 last year. Finances are strong.\" Magnavox \"has on excellent growth record stemming from its success in concentrating on quality products & a marketing system which requires direct dealing between the company S a group of . . . care- fully selected retailers,\" same broker reported, adding : \"Magnavox's sharply increased military & industrial electronic sales in recent years now account for some 40% of sales but consumer lines still provide approxi- mately 75% of the company's profits.\" Magnavox's \"share net for 1962 is officially estimated at $1.75, up from $1.26 in 1961.\" International Resistance \"is a major, if not leading, factor in all types & grades of resistors,\" empha- sized W. E. Hutton & Co. IRC sales \"go roughly 20% to consumer markets, 30% to industry, 25% to govt, con- tractors & 25% for replacement. All product lines are profitable, including the high volume items that sell for less than 2^ each.\" Continued accolade: \"Within the past 4 years, IRC has doubled its sales, quadrupled its profits and increased its dividend payments annually. At the same time, capital spending has moved up substantially & company sponsored R&D has been established at about 15% of sales.\" Conclusion: \"Starting with a strong profit position as the leading factor in its industry, and possessing the technology to maintain & improve its over-all position in electrical /electronic components, IRC should continue to record gains in future years in expanding markets.\" \"Elimination of losses from its electronics division [sold in mid-1961], plus continued rapid growth of its broadcasting & records divisions, has paved the way for a dramatic increase in earnings this year for CBS,\" noted Abraham & Co. Per-share earnings in 1962 ore expected to reach $3.20 vs. $2.47 in 1961 and \"rise to around $3.70 in 1963.\" Broker said \"sale of electronics division has had the additional benefit of improving the company's financial position. It is estimated that CBS has about $30 million in excess working capital available for acquisitions, which course is being actively pursued.\" These comments reflect industry image being painted for public by stock brokers. We will continue our analysis of their analyses in future issues. RCA-PHILCO PACT — NEW 'ERA OF GOOD FEELING': Agreement ending Philco's 6-year-old patent license suit against RCA stills the last echoes of an age when RCA, through its immense patent pool, was landlord of entire TV-radio industry. Terms appear to benefit both parties. (For discussion of settlement of dispute over NBC's Philadelphia Ch. 3, see p. 1.) Agreement seems to mark beginning of new \"era of good feeling\" toward RCA by rest of industry. For first time in many years, RCA has no major anti-trust litigation pending against it. Under terms of pact, Philco's $150 million suit against RCA, and RCA's $174 million patent infringe- ment suit against Philco and Ford are withdrawn, neither party paying damages. RCA pays Philco $9 million for non-exclusive licenses to all present Philco & Ford patents relating to radio, TV (including color), tran- sistors & data-processing equipment, and is free to use future Philco color TV patent for next 5 years. Philco & Ford receive similar rights to RCA patents in same fields, except that color patents cover principally those issued before Oct. 28, 1958, date of govt, anti-trust consent decree which broke up RCA patent pool practices. Ford & Philco must pay same as anyone else to use later RCA color TV patents. Philco's Jon. 1957 anti-trust suit was aimed primarily at RCA patent pool practices (Vol. 13:3 p2), which were largely abandoned after RCA's settlement of Zenith's 11-year old suit in Sept, of same year (Vol. 13:37 pi) and were formally ended the next year when RCA & Justice Dept, signed consent decree (Vol. 14:44 pi). Ford Motor Co. inherited suit when it purchased Philco last year, switched emphasis to alleged RCA color monopoly. Philco has based many of its charges in pre-trial testimony & briefs on RCA color practices — and color figures prominently in settlement. One major difference in the patent exchanges agreed upon last week by the 2 parties involves color patents; RCA gets all of Philco's present patents and some future ones, where- as Philco's rights to RCA color patents are limited. 8— TELEVISION DIGEST JANUARY 7, 1963 Implications for color are large. Settlement seems to establish a patent position in color TV for Philco. Philco has always claimed it had some basic color patents. Also among its patents ore those on \"Apple\" receiver & tube which now become available to RCA. Agreement clears air in color patent dispute, may fos- ter new technical developments. Philco is certain to step up color activity now. Possibly because of pendency of suit, it had not been making own color receivers — but, paradoxically, was buying complete color sets from RCA. Now, with RCA color patents available to it, and with its own patent position recognized, Philco is free to go into whole- hearted manufacture and sale of color sets — and it's a good guess it will do so with minimum of delay. En- tire medium of color should benefit — and what helps color helps RCA (including RCA tube div. & NBC). Philco's original suit also named GE and AT&T as defendants and is still pending against them. It's logical to assume that this dispute will also be settled. TM SALES CLIMB CONTINUES STEADILY: More than 3 million FM radios — of all types — were sold in U.S. last year. This year should set another new record, adding 4 million more to FM sets-in-use. Slow & steady momentum which began in 1958 is continuing, aided by FM stereo and other such relatively new developments as clock & auto FM radios. FM stereo, as expected, is making its biggest im- pact in phono field, where 50% of consoles with FM are now being sold stereo FM-equipped. Few definitive figures on FM receiving device sales are available, and many estimates merely verge on guesses. Nevertheless, we've prepared table tracing growth of retail FM radio sales by type of end-equip- ment. We believe these figures to be conservative: Type 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 (est.)

Only areas where FM stereo has made major impact so for are phono, TV combination & component tuner field. MORE WINTER DROP-INS: Additional new sets — some notable, some promotable — were being shown this week at distributor open-houses and at Chicago’s International Home Furnishings Market. Among new announcements : Magnavox indicated it would unveil a score of new TVs & stereos in Chicago this week, but at week’s end few details were available. It was known that 11 stereo models would be premiered in Early American & Colonial styling with cherry & maple finishes, starting at $159 and topped by 24-in. combo at $650. Group will include 2 transistorized Astro-Sonic consoles, at $495 (30 watts MPO) & $595 (100 watts).

TELEVISION DIGEST— 9 f NEW SERIES VOL. 3, No. 1 I NOV. SALES POINT TO RECORD PHONO YEAR: Reports of really great Nov, sales now have phono- f graph industry pointed straight at an all-time record in 1962. Preliminary & unofficial sales estimates indicate that Nov. 1962 was biggest single month for distrib- utor-to-dealer sales in at least 3 years, and that 1 1-month factory sales were high enough to forecast their r total for 1962 may reach all-time peak of 4.8 million. I Factory sales for Nov, were understood to total about 667,000, up more than 33% from the 500,000 of i Nov. 1961, and bringing 11-month total to approximately 4,363,000. Distributor sales totaled around 633,000, (' more than 31% higher than Nov. 1961 figure, for 11-month total of 3,977,000, bringing 4.5-million total well within range for full-year 1962. I For first 11 months of 1962, incidentally, almost 50% of all consoles with radio were equipped with FM stereo. Of total of about 1.1 million phono-radio combinations, 534,000 had multiplex tuners. : IMPORTS-TINYVISION, COLOR; Interesting array I of new tiny vision imports — including 14-in. color and first TV to operate from flashlight batteries — 1 is greeting visitors to Chicago for International I Home Furnishings Show this week. ' First Sharp (Hayakawa) battery portables are being ‘ displayed — a 6-in. at $199.95 and 8y2-in. at $229.95, battery , costing $24.95 extra in both cases. Conventional sets shown j by Sharp at Conrad Hilton Hotel are 12-in. (no price I announced), 16-in. sets at $109.95 & $119.95, and 19-in. table models at $129.95 & $139.95. Sharp sets are beginning [ to arrive in U.S. in quantity, and it’s believed about 5-6,000 are now on hand and ready for distribution. The flashlight-battery set is Delmonico’s IVa-in. re- ceiver made by Victor of Japan, with $149.95 list. It op- erates from 9 flashlight batteries or house current. Another Delmonico set, being shown at Merchandise Mart, is 5V^- in. at $179.95 plus $20 for rechargeable battery. Both tiny I sets are scheduled for March delivery. Delmonico will also j show 16-in. sets, starting at promotable $99.95. It will I demonstrate 14-in. color set at $399 list and 17-in. color I (no list). ■ I I October factory sales of TV picture tubes slipped sharply in units & dollars from Oct. 1961. EIA also re- I ported unit volume of receiving tubes down, but dollar !l value gained. TV picture tubes declined in unit sales to 879,588 from 912,281 in Oct. 1961. Dollar value fell to 1 $16,678,099 from $18,000,957. Cumulatively, unit & dollar i| sales lagged behind 1961’s Jan.-Oct. totals by some 100,000 b units & $7.9 million. Receiving tube unit sales slipped in \\ Oct. to 32,257,000 from 32,480,000, but dollar value in- I creased to $26,440,000 from $26,155,000.

Philco’s defunct “Instant Dividend” program (Vol. 2:9 p7) made news in Pittsburgh again when federal judge John L. Miller enjoined Appliance Associates Inc. & Mel- vin S. Landow from infringing Philco Finance Corp.’s copyright. Philco filed infringement suit when defendants published plan entitled “Appliance Bonus Membership Form.” Uniform labeling of TV & FM sets, to show they com- ply with FCC radiation limitations, won’t be required by Commission. It decided to call off its proposed rule-making. However, it again said it “admonishes purchasers against buying FM & TV receivers which have not been certifi- cated.” 10— TELEVISION DIGEST JANUARY 7, 1963 AT&T posted record earnings of $1,384,252,000 on peak sales of $8,941,594,000 in 12 months to Nov. 30. In year earlier period, AT&T earned $1,271,086,000 on $8,368,- 960.000 sales. Sharp sales & profit gains were recorded in quarter to Nov. 30. Sales climbed to $2,269,349,000 from $2,150,421,000 in Sept.-Nov. 1961. Earnings rose to $347,- 352.000 from $329,657,000. Chmn. Frederick R. Kappel said earnings were not increased by tax credits on equipment purchases as authorized by Revenue Act of 1962. “In our opinion, this credit should be accounted for as a reduction of the cost of the construction that gives rise to it,” he said, “and not as an increase in profit in the year when the new equipment is acquired.” GTE showed record sales & earnings in 1962, Chmn. Donald C. Power notified stockholders, adding: “Despite the somewhat unsettled nature of economic conditions, we believe that our revenue, sales & earnings will continue moving ahead to new records” in 1963. Sales & revenues climbed some 8% to more than $1.3 billion from 1961’s $1,227 billion. Profits, he estimated, rose about 15% to more than $85 million from $73.8 million. Manufacturing sales also set record. Assets increased to more than $2.5 billion from $2.4 billion at 1961’s end. ITT netted record income in 1962 as sales rose 15% and topped $1 billion for first time. Pres. Harold S. Geneen predicted profit’s “upward trend” would continue in 1963. He estimated 1962 sales at $1,066 billion — up from 1961’s record $930.5 million. Backlog at year’s end was 6% ahead of year-earlier’s $731 million. Geneen said ITT’s 1963 R&D spending will top $157 million, noted company will continue “its active program of acquisitions.” Transitron Electronic will establish $5 million fund to settle lawsuits filed by several mutual funds & other stockholders if U.S. District Court in Boston approves at Jan. 28 hearing. Suits charge Transitron with “false & misleading” statements filed with SEC in connection with public stock offerings in 1959 & 1960. Chmn. Leo Bakalar & Pres. David Bakalar will furnish $5 million for dis- tribution to qualified claimants, but “deny any liability.” They said “our prospectuses were honestly & carefully prepared, but we want to dispose of the lawsuits so that we can build up the company in the future without being distracted by litigation.” GE has made gift of its $1.9 million Anniston, Ala. plant & 116-acre tract to Anniston City Commission. GE announced plans in Nov. to close vacuum tube production plant (Vol. 2:47 p9), has been unable to sell or rent it. Requirement that Anniston use plant for “a public pur- pose” & not sell it for 5 years may indicate GE plan to deduct book value of property as charitable contribution for tax purposes. Citroen Electronics, Los Angeles tape recorder man- ufacturer, has been re-named Freeman Electronics, re- ported Chmn.-Pres. Eugene Freeman. Company will con- tinue Citroen brand. EIA has defined 134 terms used in design & manufac- ture of closed-circuit TV. Copies of bulletin are available at $2 each from EIA Engineering Dept., 11 W. 42nd St., N.Y. 36. Commercial nuvistor tube — RCA’s 12th — has been added for use as RF amplifier tube in multiple antenna systems & antenna-system booster-amplifiers. New antenna designed for color, the “Color Guard,” has been introduced by TACO at $17.95 list. Factory transistor sales in Oct. & year to date con- tinued familiar pattern: ahead in units from year earlier, down in dollar value. EIA reported Oct. gain in unit sales to 20,905,793 from Oct.-1961’s 18,232,530. Dollar value sagged to $24,001,640 from $24,018,037. Jan.-Oct. sales soared to 200,303,304 units vs. 154,407,230 in 1961’s first 10 months. Dollar value slumped to $242,573,551 from $250,620,519.

Ampex expects fiscal-1963 sales to jump more than 10% over $84.1 million volume of fiscal 1962, ended April 30. Pres. William E. Roberts also forecast “substantially greater increase” in profits. “All divisions are showing ex- cellent increases in sales & earnings,” he said. Ampex has introduced 15 new products since start of new fiscal year, will add 10 more by April. More than $9 million have been earmarked for R&D activities in fiscal 1963. Texas Instruments has slated special stockholders meeting Jan. 21 to seek authorization to grant new stock options for those outstanding. Internal Revenue Code permits new options on current market prices if monthly stock price over 12-month period averaged less than 80% of option’s initial price. Pre-Publication Orders for Factbook No. 33 Orders are now being taken for the 1962-63 Tele- vision Factbook. Beginning with this new upcom- ing issue, based on last year’s greatly expanded format, the book will be published once a year only — not Spring and Fall as in past years.

On the same page for the station will be published American Research Bureau’s: (1) Total net weekly circulation. (2) County-by-county total households, TV households and percentages of TV-set penetration. These figures, presented in tabular form, will also be shown graphi- cally in tone on each map. In addition, extensive space will be devoted to the other regular features that have made this comprehensive book since 1945 the industry’s leading marketing and reference work. Pre-publication copy price is $12.50; 5 or more, $10.50. Regular price after publication, $15.00; 5 or more $12.50.

Consent agreements between FTC and Nielsen, ARB & Pulse was direct result of hearings by Senate Commerce Committee, which sent findings to FTC, with instructions to do something (Vol. 14:26 p2).

Sen. Monroney (D-Okla.), one of most insistent critics of rat- ings, expressed hope that sponsors, agencies & networks now would come forward with \"demands for better testing methods.\" He called Commission's action \"a step forward\" in campaign to alert public to the \"tiny samplings and doubtful yardsticks used on Madison Avenue to decide what TV shows Americans shall watch.\" Committee members McGee (D-Wyo.) & Hartke (D-Ind.) expressed similar sentiments. Latter, how- 2— TELEVISION DIGEST JANUARY 14, 1963 ever, conceded that \"small percentage of inaccuracies\" is inevitable because of large number of factors involved in making surveys.

Though National Commvmity TV Assn, still mC'intains \"no-law\" position, somfi prominent operators have been feeling FCC out. Objective of CATV forces is to get law they can live with — and get FCC \"umbrella\" to protect them from possible onerous state & local regulation. In lawyers' language, they want federal govt, \"to preempt the field\" as it does in broadcasting. Our impression is that Commission isn't inclined that way, at the moment, and that FCC also wants to give station operators greater protection against duplication of their network-originated programs than CATV seems willing to go for. For example. Commission, in proposing rules regarding microwaves to serve CATVs, wonts to prohibit duplication by CATV 30 days before or after local station carries program. CATV interests keep plumping for prohibition of simultaneous duplication — only. FCC has made CATV legislation its prime request of Congress. At this writing, there's simply no judging what kind of compromise, if any, will emerge. FCC is fairly adamant, believes it has strong hand because of CATV's growing concern over state & local moves to regulate. CATV forces, on other hand, feel they have the \"absolute weapon\" in Rep. Harris (D-Ark.), chmn. of Commerce Committee, whose public oppo- sition to CATV legislation is stronger than any position he has ever taken in TV-radio. Here ore excerpts from his speech at NCTA convention last year (Vol. 2:26 p2) : \"FCC cannot regulate CATV as a common carrier. ... No action has been taken [on a CATV bill] and none is contemplated. . . . The problem con no longer be regarded as acute. . . . Some cities or counties seem to be attempting to regulate through insistence upon non-duplication agreements [but] I would expect that CATV operators will not permit a host of divergent & conflicting local regulations to spring up. The per- tinent court decisions in these matters should be brought to the attention of the local authorities and their jurisdiction should be challenged in the courts, if necessary.\" (You might ask him for full text.) • • • • Another decision adverse to CATV was handed down by FCC late last week when it granted 4 vhf translators in Claremont, N.H., over objections of CATV operator Bellows Falls Coble Corp. Translator appli- cant Claremont TV Inc. had asserted that chances of interference to CATV's pickups were negligible — and that CATV could use translator signals if interference proved greater than expected and ineradicable. Commission went along with translator applicant's argument — and went further. It asserted that its translator rules were meant to protect individual set owner's reception — not CATV's. Commission said CATV operator has \"remedies available to him to avoid or reduce interference which are imavailable to the indi- vidual\"— such os moving receiving antenna or using microwave to pipe signals in from long distances. \"This does not mean, of course,\" Commission said, \"that the Commission will close its eyes to any and all instances in which the establishment of a translator would cause interference to the reception of broadcast signals by a CATV system.\" Commission said it wouldn't be happy if translators deliberately interfered with CATV. \"We recognize, of course,\" FCC went on, \"that if the CATV system suffers interference from the vhf translators, the direct reception by CATV subscribers will also suffer. However, this does not necessarily mean that the subscribers to the system will lose all service, inasmuch as the CATV system can also pick up the vhf translator broadcast signals. In addition, the CATV subscribers will be able to receive the direct broadcast signals from the translators like any other viewers if they wish.\" Comrs. Lee & Ford dissented, latter issuing statement asserting that majority is discriminating against CATV. He'd hove a hearing or order translators to protect CATV against interference. He said majority's thinking wasn't \"entirely without merit,\" however. But, he added, if there's distinction to be made between interference to individuals and to CATV, it should be achieved after regular rule-making process. NEW SERIES VOL. 3, No. 2 TELEVISION DIGEST— 3 'UHF UNDERVELOPMENT' CONFERENCE IN WORKS: To help promote uhf, in light of all-channel set law, FCC may soon call for an all-interested-party conference to consider ways & means. Conference is brain-child of prolific L. M. Sandwick, EIA's consumer products staff dir. His constant worry is that public will be paying for sets — for a facility it can't use, because uhf signals won't be there. Sandwick noted FCC Chmn. Minow's recent suggestion that Commission ask industry for ideas on promoting uhf (Vol. 2:50 p4). Sandwick promptly took him up, suggesting conference include representatives of: Congress's Commerce Committees, FCC, Commerce Dept., HEW Dept., set makers, stations, NAB, Assn, for Competitive TV, telecasting equipment makers, AMST, NAEB, NET, NARDA, et ol. Sandwick's concept is that everyone should promote uhf's success stories, not dwell on the stations that went off the air. He's also much concerned about development of easily-tuned uhf tuners. Prospects for calling conference are strong. Session may be scheduled within month or so. TIGHTER REIN ON NEW AMs LIKELY: FCC's AM \"radio overpopulation\" conference last week was success, in opinion of most participants. There seems little doubt that FCC will come up with tighter en- gineering standards and will require applicants to have more than financial shoestring when they apply. To industry's relief, there seems little indication Commission will delve so deeply into station economics as to tinker with rates or other business aspects heretofore untouched by FCC. NAB's series of witnesses demonstrated, in analyses of coverage, that FCC's objective of multiple service to nation has been achieved in large part. Said one commissioner later : \"They showed that we really haven't loused up AM service, as some people have long claimed.\" There's no question Commission will take sharper look in future at applications for areas already heavily served. NAB's witnesses made it clear they want no \"arbitrary\" restrictions on authorization of new stations, but, as George Hatch, KALL Salt Lake City, chmn. of Radio Development Committee, put it : \"The establish- ment of a truly competitive, national radio service has been remarkably well achieved. For the future, the emphasis should be the improvement of existing facilities and the provision of interference free services that will keep pace with our changing population patterns.\" Frozen applicants for new stations, argued traditional position of more-competition-the-merrier. FCC is anxious to end freeze, is expected to move quickly on technical rule-making. There's some talk that Commission may also propose to lump AM & FM stations when considering need for additional serv- ice to a market; this would make it tougher for an AM applicant to argue that he'd reach imderserved areas. NAB spokesmen were careful to emphasize that Conference wasn't called because radio is sick. Scdd Hatch : \"We do not come here to bury the radio free enterprise system but to praise it — and to praise those who conceived it, those who hove built it, and those who have supervised its operation in the public interest.\" NAB Pres. Collins, who started whole thing by asserting that overpopulation is deteriorating radio programming quality, was pleased by Conference, felt it will produce results. TV SPENDING KEEPS GROWING: It looks like another banner year for TV time-&-talent revenues, if present trends continue. Based on year-start estimates by TvB, 1962 spending in 3 basic levels of TV — net- work, national spot & local — represented 14.6% of ad spending in all measured media, as against 13.6% of total in 1961. This was major gain for TV, since all-media-spending estimate (time or space, plus production costs) jumped from level of $11,845 billion in 1961 to $12,365 billion in 1962. Whopping total poured into various forms of TV advertising grew at faster rate (12%) than did total advertising spending (4%). Within still-growing TV medium, spot TV is making most rapid strides. Time-&-talent spending in national spot jumped 15% between 1961 and 1962, from $530 million to $610 million. Network spending — which still leads over-all TV field in totals — moved up 11%, from $810 million to $900 million. Local TV grew 8%, from $275 million to $297 million. Networks are bellwethers of TV spending, and all 3 networks are confident that 1963 will be strong year, with gross billings running at least 10% higher for 1963 than in 1962. CBS is particularly bullish; net- 4— TELEVISION DIGEST JANUARY 14, 1963 work s"
