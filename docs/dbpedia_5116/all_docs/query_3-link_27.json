He studied in Waldthurn and at the Vohenstrauss Lateinschule, where he received instruction in music from Kilian Hammer and acquired proficiency in violin and keyboard playing. After further studies in Weiden (1654-59), he became a theological student at the University of Altdorf; also continued musical training. He became a Lutheran minister in 1661, but soon turned decisively to music and served as a tenor at the Heidelberg court chapel; then entered the service of a Dutch nobleman, whom he accompanied to Italy; there he devoted himself to the study of music theory. Returning to Germany, he served as court composer and music director to Count Leopold of Promnitz in Sorau until 1664; then was Kantor in Triebel (1664-65) before taking up that position in Sorau (1665); was also made music director to Count Balthasar Erdmann of Promnitz (1682). Printz's writings on music theory and history provide a valuable source for the study of 17th-century music; they greatly influenced Mattheson and Walther. He was also a composer, but his large output seems to be entirely lost. His valuable music library was destroyed in the devastating Sorau fire of 1684. – Died at Sorau, Lower Lusatia, Oct. 13, 1717.\n\nin 1669 - Johann Nicolaus Bach, eldest son of Johann Christoph, is born at Eisenach.\n\nHe was educated at the University of Jena.

He served as organist and preceptor in Geisslingen (1763-69); was made court organist in Ludwigsburg in 1769, and also was harpsichordist at the opera and a music teacher before being banished for dissolute conduct in 1773.\n\nHe then went to Augsburg, where he brought out the periodical Deutsche Chronik in 1774, continuing its publication in Ulm until 1777.

During his imprisonment, he wrote extensively and also composed. He won particular distinction as a keyboardist and writer. As a composer, he was most successful with songs, most of which he set to his own texts. They are historically important for their contribution to the creation of the German lied of the folk type. A number of composers set his poems to music: Schubert's settings of his Die Forelle and An mein Klavier became famous. – Born at Obersontheim, Swabia, March 24, 1739.\n\nin 1809 - Joseph Schwarz, German baritone, is born at Riga.

In 1947 he emigrated to the U.S. and settled in Los Angeles. He earned a living by composing background music for documentary films in Hollywood, supplementing his income by copying music (he had a calligraphic handwriting).

As theatrical composer Vernon Duke, however, he enjoyed his greatest success with such songs as \"April in Paris,\" \"I Can't Get Started,\" and \"Taking a Chance on Love,\" as well as the musical Cabin in the Sky. Duke's parents were Alexander and Anna Kopyloff Dukelsky; his father was a civil engineer. Duke began to study music at seven and wrote a ballet score at eight. Admitted to the Kiev Conservatory of Music at 13, he studied composition with Reinhold Gliere and piano with Marian Dombrovsky. In 1920 his family was forced to flee Russia in the wake of the revolution; they lived in Turkey for two years, then moved to Paris. Duke visited the U.S. in 1921, where he met Gershwin, who encouraged him to write popular music and suggested his pseudonym.\n\nHe returned to Paris where in 1924 he wrote a piano concerto that led Ballet Russe director Sergei Diaghilev to commission him to write music for the ballet Zephyr et Flore (Paris, Jan. 31, 1925). His first work for the musical theater was to write interpolations for an Austrian musical, Katja, the Dancer, which opened in London in 1925 and in N.Y. the following year. Yvonne (1926), for which he wrote half the score, was another Austrian import to the U.K.; it ran 280 performances. He wrote his first complete score for The Yellow Mask (1928),which ran 218 performances. In 1929, Duke wrote a final British show, Open Your Eyes, which closed during tryouts but finally opened in London for 24 performances the following year.\n\nHe moved to the U.S. permanently in June, later becoming an American citizen. Initially he worked for Paramount Pictures, and his music was used in the 1930 features The Sap from Syracuse, Follow Thru, Laughter, and Follow the Leader. His first work for the American musical theater came with several song interpolations to the third edition of the revue The Garrick Gaieties (N.Y.,June 4, 1930), among them \"I Am Only Human After All\" (lyrics by Ira Gershwin and E. Y. Harburg), which became a hit for the Colonial Club Orchestra in July 1930. The revue Walk a Little Faster (1932) marked Duke's first complete American score. It ran 121 performances and is remembered for \"April in Paris\" (lyrics by Harburg), which became a hit for Freddy Martin and His Orchestra in December 1933, long after the show closed. Meanwhile, Ben Bernie and His Orchestra scored a hit with Duke's independently published song \"This Is Romance\" (lyrics by Edward Heyman) in October 1933.\n\nDuke was hired to write the songs for a new edition of the Ziegfeld Follies, mounted by the Shuberts after Florenz Ziegfeld's death, which opened at the start of 1934. It ran 182 performances and produced a song hit in \"What Is There to Say?\" (lyrics by Harburg) for Emil Coleman and His Orchestra. Duke wrote his own lyrics for a follow-up to \"April in Paris,\" \"Autumn in New York,\" which was featured in Thumbs Up! (N.Y., Dec. 27, 1934) and became a standard without ever becoming a hit. Duke teamed with Ira Gershwin to write the songs for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936; the show ran 115 performances, and its most memorable song was \"I Can't Get Started,\" which became associated with Bunny Berigan and His Orchestra. Berigan's second recording of the song in 1937 was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1975.\n\nDuke wrote most of the score for the revue The Show Is On (N.Y., Dec. 25, 1936), though much of it was cut and replaced by interpolations before its Broadway opening. After the death of George Gershwin on July 11, 1937,Duke was brought in to complete the music for the film The Goldwyn Follies, which was released in February 1938.\n\nDuke scored his greatest success with a book musical with Cabin in the Sky, starring Ethel Waters, in 1940.The show ran 156 performances; it was made into a successful film released in April 1943 that retained only three of Duke's songs, one of which was \"Taking a Chance on Love\" (lyrics by John Latouche and Ted Fetter). The appearance of the film sparked a revival of a 1940 recording of the song by Benny Goodman and His Orchestra that went to #1 in June 1943, becoming one of the biggest hits of the year.\n\nIn 1941, Duke wrote the songs for Banjo Eyes, a stage vehicle for Eddie Cantor, which ran 126 performances. With the onset of World War II, Duke enlisted in the Coast Guard in August 1942 and led a service band. In 1943 he teamed with Howard Dietz to write songs for the musical Dancing in the Streets, starring Mary Martin, which closed out of town, but two more shows with Dietz, Jackpot and Sadie Thompson, reached Broadway for brief runs in 1944. During that year Duke also wrote a service musical, Tars and Spars, which played on Broadway and then toured the war zones.\n\nDuke returned to live in Paris for two years, 1947-48, and upon returning to the U.S. had trouble getting productions for his stage musicals. He wrote songs for two movie musicals released in 1952: April in Paris, starring Doris Day, and She's Working Her Way through College, both with lyrics by Sammy Cahn. He then managed to get a revue, Two's Company, on Broadway with Bette Davis as star. The show ran 91 performances. Count Basie and His Orchestra revived \"April in Paris\" in early 1956 with a recording that made the R&B Top Ten and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1985. In the spring of 1956, Duke had an Off-Broadway show, The Littlest Revue, which ran 32 performances. Duke married singer Kay McCracken on Oct. 30, 1957. His final appearance on Broadway came less than two weeks later with the two songs and incidental music he wrote for the play Time Remembered, which ran 247 performances. He continued to try to mount Broadway musicals during the last decade of his life, including two shows that closed during tryouts and one that went unproduced. He died of lung cancer at 65 in 1969 at Santa Monica, Calif., Jan. 16.\n\nin 1905 - Nat Towles, early jazz band leader, bassist, is born at New Orleans. He gigged in the early 1920s with Buddie Petit, Henry \"Red\" Allen, and others before touring the South and Southwest with his own bands intermittently from 1923-33. In 1934 he briefly led his own band in Dallas; in 1935 took over the Wiley College. Students' Band in Austin, Tex.,and resumed leading in Dallas; the following year the band took up residency at the Dreamland Ballroom, Omaha, Nebr. Throughout the late 1930s and 1940s this band toured regularly; in 1943 they played several residencies in and around N.Y. including bookings at the Apollo Theatre in December 1943. Towles continued to lead his own band until moving to Calif. in 1959; he ran his own tavern until suffering a fatal heart attack. – Died at Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 1962.\n\nin 1906 - Paul Creston, [Giuseppe Guttoveggio], American composer, organist, and teacher, is born at N.Y. He received training in piano from Randegger and Dethier and in organ from Yon, but lacked formal instruction in theory or composition. Although he composed tentatively in his youth, he did not embark upon a serious career as a composer until he was 26 when he wrote his Five Dances for Piano. From 1934 to 1967 he was organist at St. Malachy's Church in N.Y. In 1938 he held a Guggenheim fellowship.\n\nIn 1941 his first symphony won the N.Y.Music Critics' Circle Award, and thereafter he received various awards and commissions. He taught at the N.Y.College of Music (1963-67), and then was a professpr of music and composer-in-residence at Central Washington State College in Ellensburg (1968-75). Among his writings were Principles of Rhythm (1964), Creative Harmony (1970), and Rational Metric Notation (1979). Creston's large output was marked by a harmonic and rhythmic idiom of considerable complexity, principally in his instrumental writing. He avoided illogical binary meters and proposed such time signatures as 6/12 or 3/9 in several of his works. – Died at San Diego, Aug. 24, 1985.\n\n10 October\n\npage 1 of 4[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]10 October[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 2 of 4\n\nin 1906 - Freddie Jenkins, jazz trumpeter, is born at N.Y. Freddie Jenkins switched to playing left-handed while in his early teens. He was taught by Lt. Eugene Mikell and played regularly in the 369th Regiment Cadet Band. He went to Wilberforce University in the early 1920s, played briefly with Edgar Hayes's Blue Grass Buddies, then regularly with Horace Henderson's Collegians from 1924-28. Jenkins joined Duke Ellington in 1928 and remained with him until he came down with a severe illness in late 1934 (he occasionally doubled on E-flat comet during 1934). He began playing again in 1935 at Adrian's Tap Room. Beginning in January 1936, Jenkins spent a brief time conducting the Luis Russell Band at Connie's Inn (in between Louis Armstrong's featured numbers), then became partowner of the Brittwood Club, N.Y. By March 1937 he had recovered sufficiently to play in The Cotton Club Floor Show with Duke Ellington. Late in 1938 he suffered a recurrence of severe lung ailment and spent many months in hospital, never returning to professional playing, although he was active as a songwriter, press agent, and musical adviser in Wash., N.Y., and Calif. throughout the 1940s. During the 1960s he worked in Tex. as a disc jockey and press correspondent. – Died at Texas, 1978.\n\nin 1908 - John Waldo Green, American pianist, composer (Body and Soul, Guy Lombardo's arranger) is born at N.Y. He studied economics at Harvard University (B.A., 1928), where he also received instruction in theory from W.R. Spalding; later studied piano with Hilsberg, orchestration with Deutsch, and conducting with Tours. Working as an arranger for Guy Lombardo, he produced his first hit song, Coquette (1928); while working as accompanist to Gertrude Lawrence, he wrote the popular Bodyand Soul (1930).\n\nHe became an arranger for Paramount Pictures in Hollywood (1930); made recordings with his own dance band and performed on the radio. He settled in Hollywood as a member of the music staff of MGM Studios (1942), serving as head of its music dept. (1949-58). He prepared award-winning adaptations of the original scores for film versions of Easter Parade (1948), An American in Paris (1951), West Side Story (1961),and Oliver!(1968); he also wrote the score for the film Raintree County (1957). He was assoc. conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic (1959-61); also appeared as a guest conductor with several of the major U.S. orchestras. – Died at Beverly Hills, May 15, 1989.\n\nin 1908 - Alan (Clifford) Frank, English music scholar, is born at London. He studied the clarinet, conducting, and composition. At the age of 17, he joined the staff of the Oxford University Press; during World War II, he was in the Royal Air Force. In 1947 he was appointed music editor of the Oxford University Press; in 1954 he became head of its music dept.; retired in 1975. In 1935 he married Phyllis Tate. He published The Playing of Chamber Music (with G. Stratton; London, 1935;2nd ed., 1951) and Modern British Composers (London, 1953); he was also co-author (with F. Thurston) of A Comprehensive Tutor for the Boehm Clarinet (London, 1939). – Died July 9, 1994.\n\nin 1912 - Helmut Wirth, (Richard Adolf Friedrich Karl), German musicologist and composer, is born at Kiel. He studied composition with R. Oppel, then took courses in musicology with Fritz Stein and Blume at the University of Kiel (Ph.D., 1937, with the dissertation Joseph Haydn als Dramatiker; published in Wolfenbiittel and Berlin, 1940). From 1936 he was active with the Hamburg Radio; also was lecturer at the Schleswig-Holstein Academy of Music in Lubeck (1952-72). He was a founder-member of the Haydn Institute of Cologne, and edited works for the complete edition of Haydn's works. He published the study Max Reger (Hamburg, 1973). Among his compositions are orchestra pieces, chamber music, piano pieces, and songs.\n\nin 1914 - Ivory Joe Hunter (US R&B singer, songwriter, pianist) is born.\n\nin 1915 - Harry \"Sweets\" Edison (US trumpeter; Count Basie Orchestra/others) is born at Columbus, Ohio. His intensely bluesy muted work is a trademark. He was nicknamed \"Sweets\" by Lester Young while they were working with Count Basie between 1938-50. He began playing trumpet at age 12. As a teenager, he gigged with local bands, then toured with Alphonse Irent's Band (at that time temporarily led by guitarist Anderson Lacy), and also worked with Eddie Johnson's Crackerjacks. In the summer of 1933, he joined JeterPillars' Band in Cleveland and for the next three years toured major Midwest towns with this band.\n\nIn February 1937, he joined Lucky Millinder, and then from June 1938 until February 1950 worked with Count Basie, except for a stint in an Army band. He provided the vocals on Basie's #1 pop hit, the R&B novelty \"Open the Door, Richard\" in 1947. After leaving Basie, Edison played in a small group led by Jimmy Rushing before regular tours with J.AT.P, from September 1950. He joined Buddy Rich's Band early in 1951 and for the next two years worked on and off with Rich including work in Calif. accompanying the Josephine Baker Revuein 1953. Remaining on the West Coast, Edison did studio work through most of the 1950s including many sessions with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, starting with Frank Sinatra's WeeHours album. He also did club work in the area with his own small ensemble.\n\nIn September 1958, he moved back to N.Y. where he led his own group during the late 1950s and early 1960s working the jazz club scene, while continuing freelance session work. He worked with George Auld's Band in spring 1964, and later that year toured Europe with J.AT.P. From the mid- 1960s through Basie's death, he again worked with the Count, occasionally rejoining the band for brief spells (including a 1970 European tour). During the late 1960s, Edison returned to Calif., mainly leading his own small group at Memory Lane, Los Angeles, from 1966-70, while also continuing to freelance with various big bands. He was featured in the film Jammin'the Blues. He visited Europe with Count Basie (1970),and undertook several tours of Europe in the late 1970s, some with Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis. Beginning in the 1980s, Edison began to lose some of his facility on the trumpet, leading him to pare back his solo work; still he continued to record and perform through the 1990s. - Died July 27,1999.\n\nin 1916 - (Thomas) Scott Huston (Jr.), American composer and pedagogue, is born at Tacoma, Wash. After attending the University of Puget Sound (1934-35), he studied with Phillips, Rogers, and Hanson at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y. (B.M., 1941; M.M., 1942; PhD., 1952). He taught at several schools of higher learning before joining the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music in 1952; after it merged with the College of Music in 1955, he was dean until 1956; he then taught there until 1988. His output was marked by a fine command of tonal and atonal writing. – Died at Cincinnati, March 1, 1991.\n\nin 1916 - Erik (Werner) Tawaststjerna, eminent Finnish musicologist, is born at Mikkeli. He studied piano with Hannikainen and Bernhard at the Helsinki Conservatory (1934-44), with Leygraf in Stockholm, with Neuhaus in Moscow (1946), and with Cortot and Gentil in Paris (1947); later pursued musicological studies at the University of Helsinki (Mag. Phil., 1958;PhD., 1960). After a brief career as a concert pianist, he devoted himself to musicology; was a professor at the University of Helsinki (1960-83). – Died at Helsinki, Jan. 22, 1993.\n\nin 1918 - Bobby Byrne, Columbus Ohio, orch leader (Club Seven) is born.\n\nin 1918 - Thelonious Monk, brilliant jazz pianist and bold and witty composer, father of T.S. Monk, is born at Rocky Mount, N.C. His first name is often misspelled \"Thelonius\"; the birth certificate says \"Thelious Junior Monk\" but this is probably an error for \"Thelonious Monk Jr.\" His family moved to N.Y. when he was four, living on W. 63rd St.; later he attended the selective public Stuyvesant H.S., an indication that he must have been a good student. He began playing piano at age of 11; he accompanied his mother's singing at the local Baptist church. In the late 1930s, he performed with a travelling evangelist's show and also gigged in and around N.Y., working with Keg Purnell's quartet (c. 1939) prior to becoming house pianist at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem.\n\nHe was first recorded playing at Minton's in 1941 with Charlie Christian and Kenny Clarke. Monk also played with Don Byas, Roy Eldridge, and Helen Humes at Minton's; Cootie Williams recorded his composition \"Round Midnight\" that same year. After working with Kenny Clarke's small band at Kelly's Stable, N.Y. (late 1942), he played briefly with Lucky Millinder and Kermit \"Scotty\" Scott at Minton's (early 1943) and with Cootie Williams and Coleman Hawkins (1944, including his studio recording debut). Monk played with the Gillespie big band at the Spotlite (March-April 1946) and recorded for Blue Note under his own name beginning in 1947; he also led a quartet with Idrees Sulieman of which one broadcast survives, from 1948; the group also played at Minton's. The first recordings of many of his originals were the critical documents that began to make people aware of him.\n\nMonk also recorded with Charlie Parker (1950) and Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins (both 1954). Because of the \"cabaret card\" law then in force, Monk was not able to undertake club engagements in N.Y. from 1951-57, after he was busted for drug possession. However, he kept active playing at small clubs around N.Y., at the Blue Note (Phil.) in October 1952, the Bee Hive in Chicago in 1955, at the Hi-Hat in Boston on a few occasions between 1949 and 1955, and reportedly in Baltimore, and visited Paris in 1954 where he recorded a solo album. On July 1957, he began an engagement at the Five Spot that lasted, with a few breaks, until the end of the year.\n\nOn July 18 or 19, he added John Coltrane to his trio and this quartet created a sensation that boosted the careers of both men. Monk toured from then on, usually with his own quartet. He used Johnny Griffin during 1958; in October 1958 at the Five Spot, he commenced a long association with Charlie Rouse. He appeared with big bands in special concerts in 1959 at Town Hall and at Randall's Island of N.Y.; in December 1963 he appeared at Philharmonic Hall and 1964 at Carnegie Hall, with arrangements from Hall Overton because Monk did not orchestrate for big band. Steve Lacy was added for gigs in 1960, including three weeks opposite Coltrane at the Jazz Gallery in Manhattan in June-July.\n\nBy this time Monk was one of the best known and best selling artists in jazz. His name was invoked on TV in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis to signify hipness. He toured Europe several times and visited Japan and Mexico, with television appearances in Japan (1963), Norway (1966), and France (1969). The latter includes a short interview that illustrates why he was considered impossible in such situations—he appears distracted, perhaps passively hostile to the whole enterprise and gives the shortest of answers. Columbia recorded him beginning in 1962, and he was a Time magazine cover subject in 1964. He toured Europe with an octet (his quartet plus Griffin, Phil Woods, Ray Copeland, and Jimmy Cleveland) as part of a George Wein package tour in 1967. In 1971 and 1972, he toured world with The Giants of Jazz with Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Stitt, Kai Winding, Al McKibbon, and Blakey. Around this time, he also appeared with Blakey in Brooklyn.\n\nMonk suffered from poor health and lived in seclusion from 1972, emerging only for special events. He was receiving Lithium treatment for manic depression at Gracie Square Hospital, a condition that was likely worsened by years of drug use that included heroin, amphetamines, and alcohol. In 1974, he performed with the N.Y. Jazz Repertory Company at Carnegie Hall, substituting for Barry Harris by making a surprise appearance just before the concert started. He appeared with a quartet at Newport, N.Y. in 1975 and at Carnegie Hall in 1976, his last public appearance. His activities were restricted in the late 1970s by immobility due apparently to increasing mental illness. He died at Englewood Hospital, where he spent the last 12 days of his life after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nHis work was recorded by others before he became accepted as a leader and pianist in his own right. Seemingly influenced by Ellington, James P. Johnson, and perhaps Earl Hines, he in turn influenced Randy Weston, Elmo Hope, Mai Waldron, Herbie Nichols, McCoy Tyner, Chick Corea, and many others, as well as non-pianists and composers such as Rollins, Coltrane, and Steve Lacy. Thelonious Monk's compositions are among the most played in jazz and have been the subject of an ever increasing number of tribute albums and concerts; his best known piece is probably the ballad \"Round Midnight.\" He played piano with a hard attack and penchant for short, punchy phrases, with voicings that were sometimes disarmingly basic and spare and at others incorporated jangling dissonant notes. As a pianist he is sometimes underestimated because he doesn't play quick flowing lines in the mainstream tradition.\n\nHis compositions and playing shared a concern with developing and building motive ideas while swinging irresistibly. \"Well You Needn't\" and \"I Mean You\" are even named in \"vocalese\" fashion after the sound of their main motives. His solos on the same tunes, live in Paris in 1961, are playful, expressive, and powerfully swinging. When he comps behind the soloist (often he chooses not to) he creates distinctive and driving riffs, something none of the tributes have picked up on. As a composer he sometimes worked with existing chord progressions (\"Just You, Just Me\" \"Evidence,\" \"Sweet Georgia Brown,\" \"Bright Mississippi,\" many blues pieces), and his performances of standards were unforgettable, but he often came up with unique and challenging original sequences. He also created highly unusual forms in such pieces as \"Boo Boo's Birthday,\" and explored virtuosity in such dazzling lines as \"Trinkle, Tinkle,\" \"Gallop's Gallop,\" and \"Four in One.\" Some pieces are named for family and friends; \"Crepuscule with Nellie\" (his wife), \"Jackie-ing\" (for his oldest niece, the first young person in the family to hang out in the clubs), \"In Walked Bud\" (for Powell), \"Pannonica\" (for the Nica Rothschild de Koenigswarter, a steady friend and supporter since the early 1950s).\n\nAs early as 1963, Steve Lacy ran a quartet whose main mission was to perform Monk's tunes. Thelonious was a group that Buell Neidlinger ran. The group Sphere, with Rouse, played many Monk tunes as well as others, and was active from 1981 or 1982, and in 1984 an all-star lineup of jazz and rock players cut \"That's The Way I Feel Now\"; numerous tributes have followed. The Beethoven Society became interested in Monk and with T.S. Jr. founded the Thelonious Monk Inst. which in the early 1990s began the first international jazz competition; it has helped launch the careers of Joshua Redman, Jackie Terrason, and others. The cul-de-sac on 63rd St. has been renamed \"Thelonious Sphere Monk Circle.\" He was the subject of the documentaries \"Straight No Chaser\" (with much performance footage), \"It's Monk's Time\" (concert tribute), and \"Thelonious Monk, American Composer.\" – Died at Englewood, N.J., Feb. 17, 1982.\n\nin 1921 - Julius, Watkins, jazz French hom player, composer, is born at Detroit. A pioneering musician, his solos had a brilliance that would have shown on any instrument, but were especially suited to his chosen one. He took up the hom in school at age eight and later studied with Francis Hellstein of the Detroit Symphony. He wanted to be a soloist and decided he would have more opportunities in jazz than in classical music. He played trumpet with the Erne Fields band 1943-46, recorded with Babs Gonzales on Jan. 20, 1949, and played trumpet and hom with Milt Buckner around 1949. In 1950, he settled in N.Y.where he studied theory and composition for three years at the Manhattan School of Music and studied hom with Robert Schultze of the N.Y. Philharmonic.\n\nIn 1953 he recorded with Monk, toured with Pete Rugolo, and soon worked live or on record with Johnny Griffin, Kenny Clarke, Milt Jackson, and Oscar Pettiford. In 1955 he formed the Jazz Modes with Charlie Rouse, a colleague from Pettiford's sextet; they first recorded in 1956 and disbanded for lack of work in 1959, which led Watkins to join George Shearing. He was in the Quincy Jones big band which was stranded when the show Free and Easy failed in Europe in early 1960. From that point on he mostly supported himself playing in Broadway shows and recording sessions, including numerous big band dates with Jones and with Gil Evans (1958-64 and 1969), and specific sessions with Coltrane (1961), Tadd Dameron (1962), Freddie Hubbard (1963), and Jazz Composer's Orchestra (1969). He worked with Charles Mingus at the Monterey festival in 1965and in 1972 was a co-leader of the Jazz Contemporaries, which recorded live at the Village Vanguard with George Coleman, Clifford Jordan, and Harold Mabern. In 1994, an annual Jazz French Horn Festival was begun in N.Y. named in his honor. – Died at Short Hills, N.J., April 4,1977.\n\nin 1923 - Louis Gottlieb, musician is born.\n\nin 1924 - Huey \"Piano\" Smith, rocker (Rockin' Pneumonia and Boogie Woogie Flu) is born.\n\nin 1924 - Ludmilla Tcherina, French actress/ballet dancer (Sins of Rome) is born.\n\nin 1924 - Leyla Gencer, Turkish soprano, is born at Constantinople. She studied at the Ankara Conservatory with Elvira de Hidalgo; she also studied with Arangi Lombardi in Istanbul. After making her operatic debut as Santuzza in Ankara in 1950, she completed her training in Italy with Apollo Granforte. In 1953 she sang in Naples, and then joined Milan's La Scala in 1956; she also appeared at the San Francisco Opera (1956-58). Her career was mainly concentrated in Europe, where she first sang at the Spoleto Festival (1959), the Salzburg Festival (1961), London's Covent Garden (1962), the Glyndebourne Festival (1962), and the Edinburgh Festival (1969). Among her admired roles were Donna Anna, Countess Almaviva, Anna Bolena, Norma, Elisabeth de Valois, and Maria Stuarda.\n\nin 1927 - Thomas Brendon Wilson, composer is born.\n\nin 1935 - Big Bopper (JILES PERRY RICHARDSON, JR.) is born. A Texas disc jockey turned rock'n'roll singer who had the misfortune of being immortalised by his death in the same plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, \"J.P.\" Richardson was the son of a Texas oil worker. Given a guitar by his father, the musically inclined youth taught himself by playing along with country and gospel songs on the radio. After attending technical school and earning a degree in radio and television, he landed a deejay position at KTRM in Beaumont, Texas in 1953. Adopting the radio persona of The Big Bopper, and calling his programme Club 990, he spoke in a black dialect with his deep bass voice.\n\nDrafted a year later, he began to compose music while in the service. Returning to KTRM in 1957, his popularity soared. Entering a recording studio in 1958, The Big Bopper recorded a mediocre parody song, 'The Purple People Eater Meets The Witch Doctor' for \"D\" Records, in an effort to capitalise on a pair of recent novelty hits. With the song a flop, deejays instead played the B-side, 'Chantilly Lace'. Picked up by Mercury Records, the single went on to sell over six million copies and catapulted the Texas deejay to stardom. The Big Bopper landed one more hit, 'Big Bopper's Wedding' (1958) and wrote Johnny Preston's hit 'Running Bear' on which he can be heard making Indian calls in the background. CAUSE: In January, 1959, The Big Bopper joined the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour during which he would sing 'Chantilly Lace' into a prop telephone.\n\nAlso featuring Holly and Ritchie Valens, the tour began on January 23, 1959, at George Devine's Ballroom in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was scheduled to end at the Illinois State Armory in Springfield on February 15, 1960. The admission to the sold-out show at Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa, was $1.25. With a blistering winter freeze outside, a sell-out was not expected. In spite of night-time temperatures which plummeted to well below-zero, the entire caravan, including Dion & The Belmonts, were forced to tour in a dilapidated former school bus with a broken heater. Refusing to freeze on the trip to the next concert, a frustrated Buddy Holly decided instead to charter a plane, and was joined by Ritchie Valens.\n\nShortly before the plane's departure, The Big Bopper convinced Waylon Jennings, Holly's then-unknown bass player, to give up his seat on the chartered craft. Taking off in a blinding snowstorm, the private plane departed from an airfield in Mason City, Iowa, and was destined for Fargo, North Dakota. With newlywed, local resident Roger Peterson at the controls, the craft went down minutes after takeoff, at 1:50 a.m. An investigative team ruled that pilot error caused the crash. After a successful take-off, Peterson experienced vertigo and flew directly into the ground. Instead of being a footnote in rock music history as the artist who scored one major rock hit, The Big Bopper was thus immortalised as a rock'n'roll casualty. - Died February 3, 1959.\n\nin 1935 - Paolo Renosto, composer is born.\n\nin 1935 - Paul Humphrey (US jazz session drummer) is born.\n\nin 1938 - Premier of Dmitri Shostakovitch's 1st String Quartet.\n\nin 1938 - Gloria Coates, compelling American composer, is born at Wausau, Wise. She was educated at La. State University (B.Mus. in composition and voice; M.Mus. in composition and musicology), and pursued postgraduate studies at Columbia University. She also attended the Cooper Union Art School. Her principal mentors in composition were Otto Luening and Alexander Tcherepnin. In 1969 she went to Munich, and in 1971 she founded the German-American Contemporary Music Series in both Munich and Cologne, serving as its director until 1983. From 1975 to 1984 she taught music for the University of Wise. International Programs in Munich, and also in London in 1976. Coates gained wide recognition with the premiere of her Music on Open Strings (Symphony No. 1) at the Warsaw Autumn Festival on Sept. 20, 1978. While she has composed a number of distinguished scores in several genres, it is as a symphonist that she has made her most significant contribution to the late 20th century repertoire. Her symphonies often display a remarkable originality, assured technique, dramatic sweep, and luminous expressivity. A number of CD recordings of her works have been adorned with her original paintings.\n\nin 1939 - O.V. Wright (OVERTON VERTIS WRIGHT) is born. A gospel-trained soul artist who scored a long string of minor Southern-style, R&B hits, Tennessee-native O.V. Wright emerged out of the gospel tradition. A deeply soulful singer in the tradition of Otis Redding, Wright joined a series of leading gospel groups, Spirit Of Memphis, The Highway QCs, and the legendary Soul Stirrers. Switching to secular material, Wright débuted on Goldwax Records in 1964 with the sizzling 'That's How Strong My Love Is'. Landing at the Duke subsidiary Back Beat Records, Wright hit his stride with producer Willie Mitchell on soulful gems such as 'You're Gonna Make Me Cry' (1965), 'Eight Men, Four Women' (1967), and 'Ace Of Spades' (1970). Jailed on a drug conviction, Wright's career was interrupted in the Seventies. Wright subsequently signed with Hi Records in 1975 and was befriended by labelmate Otis Clay. (Stricken while on stage at Joe Moore's Lakeside Lounge in Grand Bay, Alabama, he was rushed to Providence Hospital in nearby Mobile the following morning where he died shortly thereafter. Heart failure). He had a history of heart problems. - Died November 16, 1980.\n\nin 1939 - The real Eleanor Rigby died in her sleep of unknown causes at the age of 44. The 1966 Beatles' song that featured her name wasn't written about her, as Paul McCartney's first draft of the song named the character Miss Daisy Hawkins. Eleanor Rigby's tombstone was noticed in the 1980s in the graveyard of St. Peter's Parish Church in Woolton, Liverpool, a few feet from where McCartney and Lennon had met for the first time in 1957.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Itt02QOO0\"]Beatles- Eleanor Rigby - YouTube[/ame][/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot]10 October[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 2 of 4[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]10 October[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 3 of 4\n\nin 1943 - David (Michael) Cummings, intrepid English music lexicographer, is born at London, Oct. 10, 1942. After taking his B.Ed. degree at Sidney Webb College in London (1975), he entered the mundane profession of British schoolteacher. His passion for music and its elucidation led him to wade perilously in the backwaters of musicography with the ineluctable mission to correct the errors of his predecessors and contemporaries. From 1980 he served as an advisor and contributor to various standard music reference works, and also wrote articles and reviews for music journals.

College in Colorado Springs, where he founded the Pearson Electronic Sound Studio (1969), the New Music Ensemble (1972), and, after developing a unique bowed piano technique, the Bowed Piano Ensemble (1977). Scott's most significant works are scored for bowed piano strings, which, as Ingram Marshall aptly wrote, \"...must be included with the prepared piano work of John Cage in the '40s and '50s, as well as the player piano machinations Conlon Nancarrow in the '60s and '70s as examples of startlingly unique artistic vision.\" Among his awards are the New England Conservatory/Rockefeller Foundation Chamber Music Prize (1980) and an NEA Composer's Fellowship (1985-86).

Signed to Warner Brothers by producer/A&R man Ted Templeman, the Doobies fared poorly with their predominantly acoustic, self-titled début album. Leaving the group in 1971, Shogren operated a recording studio for many years. In the mid Nineties, he teamed with Brad Feager to form Parrot Audio Books, publishing 12 cassette books in all, including biographies of John Denver and Burt Reynolds. In 1996, Shogren teamed with two other short-term Doobie Brother members, Chet McCracken and Cornelius Bumpus, to record a dubious album of new versions of the group's hits.

A London native, Kirsty MacColl signed with Stiff Records at age 19, recording the self-composed 'They Don't Know' (which became a hit for Tracey Ullman in 1983). A talented and sharp-witted lyricist, MacColl enjoyed a sporadic string of UK hits, including 'There's A Guy Works Down The Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis' (1981), a cover of Billy Bragg's 'A New England' (1985), the cherished Christmas duet with Pogues leader Shane MacGowan, 'Fairytale Of New York' (1987), a cover of The Kinks' 'Days' (1989) and 'Walking Down Madison' (1991).\n\nFollowing her divorce from Lillywhite, MacColl took an extended break from recording and immersed herself in Latin music. Her final album, Tropical Brainstorm (2000), combined rock with Latin rhythms, and she later hosted a BBC radio series on Cuban music. As an in-demand backing vocalist, MacColl worked with Talking Heads, Frida, The Rolling Stones, Van Morrison and Simple Minds.\n\nWhile scuba diving with her two sons near the Yucatan Peninsula in Cozumel, Mexico, she was struck on the head by a speedboat. Seconds before the impact, she managed to push one of her sons out of the direct path of the oncoming vessel which had wandered into an area reserved for swimmers. While MacColl was killed instantly, both of her sons received minor injuries. Despite conflicting witness accounts over who was steering the boat, a 28-year-old deckhand received a 34-month prison term – which he never served.

He was one of the stars of the Ziegfeld Follies of 1918 (N.Y., June 16, 1918) and the Ziegfeld Follies of 1919 (N.Y., June 16, 1919), the latter of which found him singing Irving Berlin's \"You'd Be Surprised/' which became a popular record for him.\n\nHe had a hit with \"Makin' Whoopee,\" but his biggest record came in August 1925 with \"If You Knew Susie.\" His parents, Russian immigrants, died by the time he was three, and he was raised by his grandmother, Esther Kantrowitz, a peddler, later deriving his stage name from hers. He began working in vaudeville in 1907; in 1912 he joined Gus Edwards's Kid Kabaret, staying for two years. Part of his performance was an impression of blackface entertainer Eddie Leonard, singing Leonard's signature song \"Ida, Sweet As Apple Cider.\" The song became a Cantor favorite when he married Ida Tobias on June 9,1914. (They had five daughters and remained married until her death in 1962.)\n\nWhile on his honeymoon in London, he appeared in the revue Not Likely. Cantor was in the musical Canary Cottage in L.A. in 1916 when he was tapped by impresario Florenz Ziegfeld to appear in the Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic. He attracted attention with his presentation of \"Oh, How She Could Yacki, Hacki, Wicki, Wacki, Woo,\" which led Ziegfeld to put him in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1917 (N.Y., June 12,1917), where he sang \"That's the Kind of a Baby for Me,\" which became his first recording for Victor.\n\nHe appeared in the revue Broadway Brevities of 1920 (N.Y., Sept. 29, 1920), followed by The Midnight Rounders of 1921 (N.Y., Feb. 7,1921) and Make It Snappy (N.Y., April 13,1922), meanwhile continuing to record and scoring a best-seller with \"Margie\" in March 1921. Returning to Ziegfeld, he appeared in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1923 (N.Y., Oct. 20,1923) and in the Ziegfeld-produced book musical Kid Boots (N.Y., Dec. 13, 1923), which ran 479 performances. The month it opened he had the doublesided record hit \"No, No, Nora\"/\"I've Got the Yes! We Have No Bananas Blues.\" Cantor made his feature film debut in a silent version of Kid Boots in 1926, followed by Special Delivery (for which he also wrote the story) in 1927, the year he made his final Follies appearance, the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927 (N.Y., Aug. 16, 1927).\n\nWhoopee (N.Y., Dec. 4, 1928) was nearly as successful onstage as Kid Boots and gave him one of his biggest record hits in \"Makin' Whoopee.\" He co-wrote the libretto for Earl Carroll's Sketch Book (N.Y, July 1, 1929), though he did not appear in the revue; it ran 392 performances. After losing a fortune in the 1929 stock market crash, Cantor made at least some of the money back by writing a book, Caught Short, about the experience. (A movie based on the book came out in 1930.) He then went to Hollywood and made a series of musical comedy films: Glorifying the American .... (1929); Whoopee! (1930); Palmy Days (1931); The Kid from Spain (1932) (featuring the record hit \"What a Perfect Combination\"); Roman Scandals (1933); Kid Millions (1934) (featuring the record hit \"Okay, Toots\"); Strike Me Pink (1936); and All Baba Goes to Town (1937).\n\nCantor had a popular radio show starting in 1931, but he was blacklisted by radio in 1939 after giving a speech at the N.Y. World's Fair in which he denounced fascism. When world events vindicated his position, he returned to the air. After another film, Forty Little Mothers, in 1940, he made his last appearance in a Broadway musical with Banjo Eyes (N.Y, Dec. 21,1941). His other films of the 1940s were Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943), Show Business (1944, which he produced), Hollywood Canteen (1944), and // You Knew Susie (1948, which he produced). In September 1952, Cantor began hosting The Colgate Comedy Hour on television. The show lasted until 1954, when he hosted the Eddie Cantor Comedy Theatre for an additional year. He played himself in the film The Story of Will Rogers (1952). He dubbed the voice of Keefe Braselle in the film The Eddie Cantor Story (1953). The last decade of his life he was largely inactive due to a heart condition.

He then toured Europe with Spivakov and the Moscow Virtuosi in 1988.

Known as the \"Ghazal King\", he gained acclaim together with his wife, another renowned Indian ghazal singer Chitra Singh in the 1970s and 1980s. Their combination album comprising music from the films, Arth and Saath Saath is the HMV's largest selling combination album of all time.[citation needed] Sajda (An Offering, 1991), Jagjit Singh's magnum opus double album with Lata Mangeshkar holds the same record in non-film category.[citation needed] He sang in numerous languages. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the government of India in 2003. In February 2014, Government of India released a postal stamp in his honour.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Singh is credited for the revival and popularity of ghazal, an Indian classical art form, by choosing poetry that was relevant to the masses and composing them in a way that laid more emphasis on the meaning of words and melody evoked by them. In terms of Indian Classical music, his style of composing and Gayaki (singing) is considered as Bol-pradhan, one that lays emphasis on words. He highlighted this in his music for films such as Prem Geet (1981), Arth and Saath Saath (1982), and TV serials Mirza Ghalib (1988) and Kahkashan (1991). Jagjit Singh is considered to be the most successful ghazal singer and composer of all time in terms of critical acclaim and commercial success. With a career spanning five decades and a repertoire comprising over 80 albums, the range and breadth of his work has been regarded as genre-defining. He is the only composer and singer to have composed and recorded songs written by former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee – also a poet – in two albums, Nayi Disha (1999) and Samvedna (2002).\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Singh's 1987 album, Beyond Time, was the first digitally recorded release in India. He was regarded as one of India's most influential artists. With sitar legend Ravi Shankar and other leading figures of Indian classical music and literature, Singh voiced his concerns over politicisation of arts and culture in India and lack of support experienced by the practitioners of India's traditional art forms, particularly folk artists and musicians. He lent active support to several philanthropic endeavours such as the library at St. Mary's School, Mumbai, Bombay Hospital, CRY, Save the Children and ALMA.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Jagjit Singh was born in Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan, India (then Bikaner State) in a Punjabi Sikh family. His father was Amar Singh and his mother was Bachan Kaur.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Educated initially at Khalsa High School and Government College in Sri Ganganagar, Singh obtained an arts degree from DAV College in Jalandhar. There he began his professional career in 1961 by undertaking singing and composing assignments at All India Radio's (AIR) Jalandhar station. Later, he studied to obtain a post-graduate degree in history from Kurukshetra University in Haryana. Throughout this time, and as a consequence of a natural talent that was spotted by his father, Singh learned music initially from a visually impaired master of Indian classical music, Pandit Chaganlal Sharma and later from Ustad Jamaal Khan of Senia Gharana, who taught and trained him in all the prominent styles of Hindustani Classical vocal tradition such as Khayal, Dhrupad, Thumri and others. Throughout his teenage years, he performed on stage and composed music. Although his father, who was a government employee, had hoped that he would become an engineer, Singh pursued his passion for music relentlessly. Like all parents in Indian middle class families, his father aspired for him to become a bureaucrat. However, he also encouraged Singh and his siblings to learn music.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In March 1965, and without the knowledge of his family, Singh moved to Bombay, where there were many opportunities for music artists because of the Bollywood film industry. He obtained work initially as a singer of advertising jingles and later progressed to playback singing.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Singh was still struggling to make a living in 1967 when he met the Bengali-born Chitra Dutta. She divorced her husband and married Singh in December 1969.[5] Following the birth of their son, Vivek, the couple performed as a singing duo but it was not until the 1976 release of the album The Unforgettable that they found significant, and surprising, success. In the interval, the primary difficulty for them had been that the ghazal music genre was dominated by Muslim artists[6] and especially those from Pakistan.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]The Unforgettable, which was the couple's first LP, was an unconventional recording and it turned them into stars. The song \"Baat Niklegi\" from the album achieved great popularity for the Singhs. The Independent described it in 2011 as \"ground-breaking ... it became a transformative, before-and-after milestone in the history of Indian popular and ghazals music. It remains that.\" Using modern arrangements, it consists of ten tracks that include two on which they sang as a duo and the remainder equally split between Jagjit and Chitra singing the lead. The Independent further noted that \"This format of solo and duet performances from the first commercially successful husband-and-wife team in Indian popular music proved astonishingly successful.\" Jagjit explained that \"I was determined to polish up the genre and make it more acceptable to modern tastes, so chose simple poems and set them to simple tunes. I also introduced western instrumentation to make them livelier.\" Thereafter, the couple worked both on solo and joint musical projects and performed concerts worldwide. There was success from involvement with the film industry and they amassed considerable wealth,[6] while Jagjit became known as \"the Ghazal king\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Among their subsequent duo recordings of the 1970s were Shiv Kumar Batalvi – Birha da Sultan (1978), Live in Concert at Wembley (1979) and Come Alive (1979). Of those released in the 1980s, \"The Latest\" by Sudarshan Faakir was the best selling album with his life time hit \"Woh Kagaz ki Kashti...Woh Baarish ka Paani\". It was the first album by the duo with poetry of only one Poet. Ecstasies (1984) has also been described as \"one of their finest\". The joint projects ceased in 1990 when their 18-year-old son, Vivek, was killed in a road accident. Chitra felt unable to sing following these events. Monica, Chitra's daughter from her first marriage, committed suicide in 2009.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Although Jagjit continued to work and to have success after Chitra withdrew from public life he, too, was affected by the death of Vivek. The Guardian notes that he \"suffered from deep depression and his anguish was often evident in his live performances.\" Aside from occupying himself with solo projects, which he performed in several languages,[8] he collaborated with Lata Mangeshkar on an album titled Sajda, an Urdu word meaning \"prostration\".\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Singh's work in film encompassed playback singing for productions such as Arth, Saath Saath and Premgeet. He composed all of the songs for the latter, as well as for the TV serial Mirza Ghalib that was based on the life of the eponymous poet, Mirza Ghalib.[citation needed][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On 10 May 2007, in the presence of numerous political and diplomatic luminaries at an event held in the Central Hall of the Parliament of India, Jagjit Singh rendered Bahadur Shah Zafar's famous ghazal Lagta nahin hai dil mera to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Singh toured the UK in 2011 and was due to perform with Ghulam Ali in Mumbai[6] but suffered a brain haemorrhage on 23 September 2011. He was in a coma for over two weeks and died on 10 October at Lilavati Hospital, in Mumbai. He was cremated the following day at Chandanwadi Crematorium near Marine Lines in Mumbai.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]A number of tributes have been paid to Singh after his death, and some tried to cash in on his popularity, which was criticised by his wife.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A biography of Singh, entitled Beyond Time based on about 40 hours of interviews with him, was released in 2012. It was transcribed and edited by Ashrani Mathur.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – Calvin Grand Shofner -- known professionally as Cal Smith, and famed for top-charting hits Country Bumpkin, The Lord Knows I'm Drinking and It's Time To Pay the Fiddler -- died in Branson, Mo., at age 81.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born in Gans, Okla., Smith grew up in the San Jose, Calif., area, and became a popular disc jockey prior to joining Ernest Tubb's Texas Troubadours as a rhythm guitarist in 1962. Smith worked with Tubb until 1968, when he became a solo performer.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In 1972, he recorded Bill Anderson's The Lord Knows I'm Drinking , which became a No. 1 country hit for Decca Records. In 1974, Smith scored with Country Bumpkin, which became the Country Music Association's song and single of the year and the Academy of Country Music's song of the year.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Don Wayne wrote Country Bumpkin, after being critiqued by a publishing industry professional as being too country: Nobody wants to hear about that frost on the pumpkin, was the criticism. Wayne wrote of a man who met a woman who teased him, \"Hello, country bumpkin/ How's the frost out on the pumpkin?\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]\"And then the story just unfolded,\" Wayne told author Philip Self in Guitar Pull: Conversations With Country's Legendary Songwriters. \"I thought to myself, 'Man, I've stumbled on to a hit song here.' But after thinking about it further, I thought, 'This could be more than a hit song. This could be a great song, if I write what I'm seeing.'\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Wayne wrote what he was seeing, and Smith's vocal on the song was relaxed and authentic.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Country Music Hall of Famer Garth Brooks sang Country Bumpkin for years in his sound checks, and he has called Smith's recording of Country Bumpkin his favorite country single. In 1994, Smith presented Brooks with his Academy of Country Music Award for Country Bumpkin, and Brooks displayed that trophy in his home. Country Bumpkin was a huge country hit, as was 1975's It's Time to Pay the Fiddler. Smith also scored Top 20 hits with 1972's I've Found Someone of My Own, 1974's Between Lust and Watching TV, 1975's She Talked a Lot About Texas and Jason's Farm, and 1977's I Just Came Home to Count the Memories.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Smith also figured into Loretta Lynn's Grammy-grabbing new-century career revival. Lynn's album returned her to mainstream prominence, and single Portland, Oregon was a duet between Lynn and rocker/producer Jack White. That song was spurred by a Portland night where she and Smith ordered drinks at a Holiday Inn. According to Lynn's memoir, Still Woman Enough, the evening ended innocently, but Smith's drink suggestion was enough to inspire the song's opening couplet: \"Well, Portland, Oregon, and sloe gin fizz/ If that ain't love than tell me what is.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Smith's last charting single came in 1986 with King Lear.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]His later years were spent with his wife, Darlene. He is survived by his wife, five children and 15 great-grandchildren.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – Jim Shumate, fiddler that played with Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys from 1943–1945, dies at age 91. Shumate's main influences were Fiddlin' Arthur Smith, Curly Fox, and his uncle who played the fiddle while he was growing up. Shumate joined the band after Bill Monroe heard him playing on the radio station WHKY from downtown Hickory, North Carolina, and asked him to join the Blue Grass Boys. Howdy Forrester, who was Bill Monroe's fiddle player at the time, gave his notice and was going into the Navy. At age 20, Shumate became the fiddler for the Blue Grass Boys, and he sang bass on gospel songs. During this time, the Blue Grass Boys were also a baseball team, so they would arrive early to towns they were playing at and challenge the local baseball team. Unfortunately, there were no recordings made while Shumate was in the Blue Grass Boys.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]During a visit to Nashville, Shumate met Earl Scruggs, who he knew because they were both from Hickory, North Carolina, and encouraged Scruggs to audition for Bill Monroe. During the time that Scruggs auditioned for Monroe, the band members were Jim Shumate, Lester Flatt, Sally Ann Forrester, Jim Andrews. By the next week, Howdy Forrester had returned from the Navy. He came back to play fiddle for the Blue Grass Boys and Jim Shumate left to work in the furniture business in North Carolina. Although Shumate convinced Earl Scruggs to audition for Monroe's band, he did not end up playing when Scruggs joined. In 1948, the band members of the Blue Grass Boys changed again. Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs started their own band, The Foggy Mountain Boys, with Cedric Rainwater and Jim Eanes. Soon after, Jim Shumate joined them and played the fiddle on their first recording session. That same year, he competed against some of the best fiddlers in the United States and won the National Fiddler's Convention in Richlands, Virginia. He was known for his innovative, bluesy fiddle style and his mastery of syncopation and speed.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In 1995, Jim Shumate received a North Carolina Folk Heritage Award. He performed as a solo artist, composed sacred songs, and also played with his band, Sons of the Carolinas. In his final years, Jim had been battling kidney failure and dementia.
