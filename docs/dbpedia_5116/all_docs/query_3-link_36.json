It is also dependent upon the transmitter’s channel loading, its resultant RF input level and the FRRA/FRDA RF output capability. In order not to overload the ampli- fier section input, an internal attenuator must be installed. To find the recommended attenuator value, first determine the receivers opti- cal input level as noted in the \"Input Optical Power”.

Determine the number of degrees of temperature change. T = T 2 - T 1 = (-40°F) - 70°F = (-110° F) Find the percent change in cable loss. % change = 1% per 10°F x (-110°F) = (1%/10°F) x (-110°F) = - 11% Find the dB change in the span’s loss. Change in cable loss (in dB) = -11% x 22 dB = -2.42 dB So, if the span’s loss was 22 dB at 70°F it becomes 22 dB + (-2.42 dB) = 19.58 dB at -40°F. Changes in cable loss accumulate over multiple cable spans and can cause performance degradation if not controlled by AGC/ASC units.\n\nPage 183: Typical Cable Attenuation Chart\n\nTypical Cable Attenuation Chart in dB/100 Feet @ 68°F (20°C)\n\nPage 184: Miscellaneous Data & Constants\n\nMiscellaneous Data & Constants 75 Ohm Attenuator Table & Equation Loss T-Attenuator Pi-Attenuator (dB) Resistor (Ohm) Resistor (Ohm) 0.5 2.16 1302.16 2606.49 4.32 1.0 4.31 650.00 1304.32 8.65 1.5 6.46 432.14 870.75 13.02 2.0 8.60 322.86 654.32 17.42 2.5 10.72 257.01 524.75 21.89...\n\nPage 185 75 Ohm Attenuator Table & Equations The equations necessary to calculate the resistance values in ohms for T and Pi pad Attenuators are as follows: where: n = loss in dB z = impedance value in Ohm To obtain resistance values at various impedances, simply multiply the resistances by the impedance value.

Ghosts displaced to the left are generally due to ingress, for example, direct pick up. Assuming ghosts are not present in the signals at the headend, ghosts displaced to the right are generally indicative of impedance mismatches in the system, for example, devices with poor return loss.

The cable resistance is included in the manufacturers specification sheet. Resistance is usually stated as center conductor, shield, and loop. Loop resistance is the sum of the center conductor and shield resistance. The amplifier current drain and voltage requirements are also part of the manufacturers specifications. The ideal location of the power supply is such that the current supplied flows equally both, away from, and towards the headend.

The heat generated by the headend is one of the major contributors to the total amount of BTU’s required for heating and cooling. The specified AC wattage dissipation of a headend component directly correlates to the amount of heat it generates.\n\nPage 221 System Planning Headend & Distribution System Construction The System Contractor must adhere to both national and local building codes when constructing a Broadband CATV System. This includes, but is not limited to the NEC, NFPA Codes and local building ordinances.\n\nPage 222: Digital Signal Analysis\n\nDigital Signal Analysis Digital signals such as QPSK & QAM use many different factors to determine the quality and performance of the signal. The following section will describe some of the most common factors used in digital signal analysis. QAM Signal to Noise Ratio vs. BER The theoretical bit-error rate of the QAM signal as a function of the SNR is provided for reference.\n\nPage 223 Digital Signal Analysis QAM Signal to Noise Ratio The following table depicts the theoretical maximum values for various orders of QAM: Order of QAM SNR max 46.0 dB 46.0 dB 43.0 dB 46.0 dB 43.0 dB 46.0 dB QAM MER — Modulation Error Ratio The modulation error is a calculated quantity indicating the mean or the maximum deviation of the I/Q values from ideal signal states and thus provides a measure of signal quality.\n\nPage 224 Digital Signal Analysis The modulation error is specified as rms and as peak value. To calculate the modulation error, all decisions fields are investigated on after the other: To obtain peak modulation error, the maximum magnitude of the difference vector (error vector) formed by the vector of the ideal and the actual signal status is determined for each decision field.\n\nPage 225 Digital Signal Analysis For quantized I/Q values, the peak value is output in discrete form only since no averaging is performed in the calculation. The rms modulation error can be calculated within the limit values specified in the following table. The limit values are obtained for quantized I/Q values: Order of QAM...\n\nPage 226 Digital Signal Analysis What is a QAM Signal Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) uses many different phases known as states: 16, 32, 64, and 256. Each state is defined by a specific amplitude and phase. This means the generation and detection of symbols is more complex than a simple phase or amplitude device.\n\nPage 227 Digital Signal Analysis The constellation diagram examples shown are based on 64 QAM modulation and use the following basic settings: maximum possible DVB data transmission rate of 6.92 Msps or 41.73 Mbit/s (64 QAM); Cosine roll-off filtering with roll-off factor r = 0.15 and PRBS (pseudo random binary sequence) data stream, no coding.\n\nPage 228 Digital Signal Analysis Interferers are understood to be sinusoidal spurious signals occurring in the transmission frequency range and superimposed on the QAM signal at some point in the transmission path. After demodulation, the interferer is contained in the baseband form of low-frequency sinusoidal spurious signals.\n\nPage 229 Digital Signal Analysis Carrier suppression or leakage is a special type of interference in which it’s frequency equals the carrier frequency in the RF channel. Carrier leakage can be superimposed on the QAM signal in the I/Q modulator. In the constellation diagram, carrier leakage shows up as a shifting of the signal states corresponding to the DC components of the I and Q components.\n\nPage 230 Digital Signal Analysis Phase Jitter or phase noise in the QAM signal is caused by transponders in the transmission path or by the I/Q modulator. It may be produced in carrier recovery, a possibility that is to be excluded here. In contrast to the phase error described above, phase jitter is a statistical quantity that affects the I and Q path equally.\n\nPage 231: Station List\n\nStation List Prior to the digital transition date of February 17, 2009 the FCC assigned interim \"Companion DTV\" channel assignments to all eligible full power TV stations.
