It is operated by the University of North Carolina system, which holds the licenses for all but one of the thirteen PBS member television stations licensed in the state--WTVI (channel 42) in Charlotte is owned by Central Piedmont Community College. The broadcast signals of the twelve television stations cover almost all of the state, as well as parts of Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The network's operations are located at the UNC Center for Public Television at Research Triangle Park between Raleigh and Durham.\n\nHistory\n\nWUNC-TV in Chapel Hill, the state network's flagship station, first signed on the air on January 8, 1955 as the second non-commercial educational television station located south of Washington, D.C.--one day after Cheaha, Alabama-licensed WCIQ-TV. Over the next twelve years, four more satellite stations signed on. WUND-TV in Edenton was the first of these satellites to debut in September 1965, followed by the launches of WUNE-TV in Linville in September 1967, WUNF-TV in Asheville in September 11, 1967, WUNG-TV in Concord in September 11, 1967 and WUNJ-TV in Wilmington in June 4, 1971. This was supplemented with a network of translator stations in the Appalachian Mountains that also allowed the network's programming to reach across the entire state.\n\nFive additional satellites debuted afterward: WUNK-TV in Greenville in May 1972, WUNL-TV in Winston-Salem in February 1973, WUNM-TV in Jacksonville in November 1982, WUNP-TV in Roanoke Rapids in 1986, and WUNU-TV in Lumberton in September 1996. The state network's youngest station, WUNW in Canton, signed on in July 2010 to replace a translator that had served the area since the 1980s. The state network was branded on-air as \"North Carolina Public Television\" (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as \"CPT\", an abbreviated form of \"University of North Carolina Center for Public Television\") from 1979 to the mid-1990s, when it rebranded itself as \"University of North Carolina Television\". It simplified the brand name to \"UNC-TV\" later in the 1990s; it had previously used that brand for most of the 1970s.\n\nProgramming\n\nThe state network produces many programs of local interest, including the weeknightly public affairs program North Carolina Now, Our State, Carolina Outdoor Journal, Exploring North Carolina, North Carolina Bookwatch with D.G. Martin, and special programs about the state's history and culture. It also produces The Woodwright's Shop for national distribution. In addition to PBS and American Public Television programs and local productions, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday evenings and the BBC soap opera EastEnders on Sunday evenings.\n\nStations\n\nUNC-TV operates twelve stations that relay its programming across the entire state as well as into portions of Virginia, Tennessee and South Carolina.\n\nEach station's callsign consists of \"UN\" for University of North Carolina, followed by a letter assigned sequentially in the order in which it was activated, except for the first station.\n\nStation City of license/\n\n(other cities served) Channels\n\n(TV / RF) First air date ERP\n\nHAAT\n\nTransmitter coordinates Facility ID Public license\n\ninformation WUNC-TV Chapel Hill\n\n(Raleigh/Durham) 4 (PSIP)\n\n25 (UHF) January 8, 1955 1000 kW 464 m 35Â°51â²58.7â³N 79Â°10â²0.3â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69080 Profile\n\nCDBS WUND-TV1 Edenton2\n\n(Elizabeth City) 2 (PSIP)\n\n20 (UHF) September 10, 1965 543 kW 489 m 35Â°53â²58.3â³N 76Â°20â²47.5â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69292 Profile\n\nCDBS WUNE-TV Linville\n\n(Boone/Hickory) 17 (PSIP)\n\n17 (UHF) September 11, 1967 137.8 kW 531 m 36Â°3â²47.8â³N 81Â°50â²30.7â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69114 Profile\n\nCDBS WUNF-TV Asheville 33 (PSIP)\n\n25 (UHF) September 11, 1967 185 kW 797 m 35Â°25â²33.2â³N 82Â°45â²23.8â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69300 Profile\n\nCDBS WUNG-TV Concord\n\n(Charlotte) 58 (PSIP)\n\n44 (UHF) September 11, 1967 150 kW 404 m 35Â°21â²30.8â³N 80Â°36â²36.5â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69124 Profile\n\nCDBS WUNJ-TV3 Wilmington 39 (PSIP)\n\n29 (UHF) June 4, 1971 700 kW 297 m 34Â°19â²16.7â³N 78Â°13â²41.7â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69332 Profile\n\nCDBS WUNK-TV Greenville 25 (PSIP)\n\n23 (UHF) May 7, 1972 1000 kW 351 m 35Â°33â²10.9â³N 77Â°36â²6.00â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69149 Profile\n\nCDBS WUNL-TV Winston-Salem\n\n(Greensboro/High Point) 26 (PSIP)\n\n32 (UHF) February 22, 1973 197.5 kW 479 m 36Â°22â²32.6â³N 80Â°22â²17.2â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69360 Profile\n\nCDBS WUNM-TV Jacksonville\n\n(New Bern) 19 (PSIP)\n\n19 (UHF) November 16, 1982 65 kW 561 m 35Â°6â²15.6â³N 77Â°20â²11.4â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69444 Profile\n\nCDBS WUNP-TV Roanoke Rapids 36 (PSIP)\n\n36 (UHF) October 16, 1986 125 kW 368 m 36Â°17â²29.3â³N 77Â°50â²9.3â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69397 Profile\n\nCDBS WUNU Lumberton\n\n(Fayetteville) 31 (PSIP)\n\n31 (UHF) September 23, 1996 113 kW 294 m 34Â°47â²51.1â³N 79Â°2â²41.4â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 69416 Profile\n\nCDBS WUNW Canton\n\n(Waynesville) 27 (PSIP)\n\n27 (UHF) July 21, 2010 7 kW 474 m 35Â°34â²6â³N 82Â°54â²25â³Wï»¿ / ï»¿ 83822 Profile\n\nCDBS\n\nNotes:\n\n1. WUND-TV formerly used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on to 1967.\n\n2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to Columbia; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005, effectively gaining must-carry cable carriage in the Norfolk-Newport News-Portsmouth Television Market, which includes several northeastern North Carolina counties. ( )\n\n3. Five stations in the Wilmington media market began transmitting solely in digital on September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national digital television transition on June 12, 2009.\n\nDigital television\n\nDigital channels\n\nUNC-TV's current over-the-air digital configuration, which is multiplexed among three subchannels, was introduced on September 25, 2008. On that date, UNC-TV revised its subchannel lineup on its stations, reducing the number of channels to three: UNC-TV (the main channel of each station, which now carries high definition programming), and the standard definition-only services UNC-KD and UNC-EX (\"The Explorer Channel\"). UNC-TV HD and UNC-EX are also available to DirecTV customers with MPEG4-compatible receivers. Proir to February 1, 2016, Time Warner Cable customers also received UNC-MX (described as \"an eclectic mix of programming for adults\") in standard definition; the North Carolina Channel has since replaced UNC-MX on Time Warner Cable systems.[1] Prior to November 1, 2009, the third subchannel was named UNC-NC.[2]\n\nThis configuration is used for WUNC, WUND, WUNF, WUNG, WUNJ, WUNK, WUNL, and WUNU:\n\nChannel Video Aspect PSIP Short Name Programming[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] xx.1 1080i 16:9 UNC-TV Main UNC-TV programming / PBS xx.2 480i ROOTLE PBS Kids xx.3 UNC-EX The Explorer Channel[11] xx.4 NCCHL The North Carolina Channel\n\nAn alternate configuration is used for WUNE, WUNM, WUNP, and WUNW. The original purpose for this was to obtain must-carry status for UNC-KD since those are secondary stations in their respective markets.[12] On June 15, 2010, UNC-KD switched subchannels with UNC-EX on the four stations previously mentioned, which transferred UNC-KD's must-carry status to UNC-EX.[13]\n\nChannel Video Aspect PSIP Short Name Programming[14] xx.1 480i 16:9 UNC-EX The Explorer Channel xx.2 1080i UNC-TV Main UNC-TV programming / PBS xx.3 480i ROOTLE PBS Kids xx.4 NCCHL The North Carolina Channel\n\nSubscribers of Time Warner Cable, the major cable provider in the state, can receive each of the UNC-TV digital subchannels; Time Warner Cable maintains a direct-fiber optic connection to UNC-TV's studios in Raleigh. Cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV (including Time Warner Cable) also carry UNC-MX (formerly UNC-ED) on their digital tiers. UNC-MX features a mix of how-to and public affairs programs, along with encore presentations of programs originally broadcast on the primary UNC-TV channel. Cable providers which rely on off-air reception for broadcast stations are limited to the three-channel lineup. On February 1, 2016, UNC-MX was renamed UNC-NC \"The North Carolina Channel\" and was added over-the-air on subchannel 4 on both channel configurations.[15] On July 2, 2016, UNC-KD was renamed ROOTLE, offering 24-hour programming for children ages 3-8.[16]\n\nPrior to September 25, 2008, UNC-TV formerly operated four digital channels: in addition to the main signal on the primary channel, the second digital subchannel of each station carried UNC-HD (which carried PBS and regional programming in high-definition), the third subchannel carried UNC-KD (which carried children's programs), the fourth subchannel carried UNC-ED (an educational television service) and the fifth subchannel carried UNC-NC (centering on North Carolina public affairs and original local productions). Due to bandwidth limitations at the time, the over-the-air feed of UNC-HD was only available between 8-11 p.m., during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC ceased transmission in the interim. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24-hour schedule.\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion\n\nUNC-TV's stations shut down their analog signals on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital channel allocations post-transition are as follows:[17]\n\nWUNC-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 4; the station's digital signal moved from its pre-transition UHF channel 59, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to channel 25. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 4.\n\nWUND-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2; the station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 20. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 2.\n\nWUNE-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 17; the station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 54, which was among the high band UHF channel (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 17.\n\nWUNF-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 33; the station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 25. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 33.\n\nWUNG-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 58; the station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 44. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 58.\n\nWUNK-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 25; the station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 23. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 25.\n\nWUNL-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 26; the station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 32. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 26.\n\nWUNM-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 19; the station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 18 to channel 19.\n\nWUNP-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 36; the station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 39 to channel 36.\n\nWUNU-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 31; the station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 25 to channel 31.\n\nUNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in an early switch to digital-only broadcasts on September 8, 2008, nine months ahead of the national transition deadline.[18] Following that date, WUNJ-TV became only full-power station in Wilmington that continued to broadcast an analog signal until the national digital transition on June 12, 2009.\n\nTranslators\n\nUNC-TV operates 22 translators across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area repeaters that bring the network's signal to towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain. Five of the translators are repeaters of WUNE, 11 repeaters of WUNF, three repeaters of WUNG and three repeaters of WUNL; though all of UNC-TV's full-power stations are straight simulcasts of the network signal.\n\nDirectly repeating WUNE:\n\nW49DB-D Andrews\n\nW42AX-D Bakersville\n\nW31DH-D Franklin (Wine Springs)\n\nW31AN-D Murphy\n\nW31DI-D Spruce Pine\n\nDirectly repeating WUNF:\n\nW19HK-D Black Mountain\n\nW19DD-D Brevard\n\nW46AX-D Bryson City\n\nW35CO-D Burnsville\n\nW28EE-D Canton (North Asheville)\n\nW42DF-D Cashiers\n\nW47DM-D Cullowhee\n\nW19DB-D Franklin (Cowee Bald)\n\nW29DE-D Hayesville\n\nW35CK-D Highlands\n\nW19CR-D Tryon\n\nDirectly repeating WUNG:\n\nW41DI-D Bat Cave\n\nW51EE-D Marion\n\nW30CS-D Zionville\n\nDirectly repeating WUNL:\n\nW41DL-D Boone\n\nW25AY-D Jefferson\n\nW50DV-D Sparta\n\nWUNC-TV also maintains digital fill-in translators, which broadcast on UHF channel 30 in Raleigh[19] and UHF channel 46 in Oxford.[20]\n\nCable and satellite carriage\n\nUNC-TV is carried on all cable television providers in North Carolina. Additionally, WUND in Edenton is carried by Cox Communications' systems in the southern portion of the Hampton Roads market in Virginia, a market of which Edenton is located within. It has also been carried on some cable systems in the Roanoke market in Virginia and the Tri-Cities market in Tennessee.\n\nOn DirecTV and Dish Network, WUNC-TV, WUNG, WUNL, WUND, WUNF, WUNJ and WUNU are carried on the respective local feeds for the Research Triangle, Charlotte, the Piedmont Triad, Greenville/Spartanburg/Asheville, Hampton Roads, Wilmington and Florence/Myrtle Beach. In previous years, WUNL has also been carried on the Roanoke DirecTV feed;[21] the Piedmont Triad market includes portions of western Virginia.\n\nSee also\n\nNorth Carolina Public Radio\n\nReferences"
