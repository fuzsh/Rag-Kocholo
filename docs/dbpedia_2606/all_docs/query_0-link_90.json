        "text": "Sadie Willis-Falkiner July 22nd, 2020 - 10:52 PM\n\nPost-punk legacies The Cure have shocked fans and divulged details today (22nd July 2020) surrounding their hugely anticipated new album. Keyboardist Roger O’Donnell spoke about the upcoming project, saying“it’s going to be an amazing record.”\n\nThe Cure’s most recent record is the haunting 4:13 Dream, their 13th studio album that was released back in 2008. With eleven years since their last record, The Cure delayed their latest release until they had a body of work that exceeded their own impeccable standards. Containing songs like Freakshow, Siren Song and Underneath the Stars, naturally, The Cure was hesitant to put out the follow up to the largely successful 4:13 Dream.\n\nChatting to Classic Pop magazine, O’Donnell disclosed some sought-after details surrounding the band’s decade-long hiatus. O’Donnell stated: “Four years ago, I said to Robert ‘We have to make one more record, and it has to be the most intense, saddest, most dramatic and most emotional record we’ve ever made, and then we can just walk away from it. Listening to the demos, it is that record. I think everybody will be happy with it.”\n\nO’Donnell also meditated upon how having a break from music actually heightened the pressure to produce the otherwordly record they wanted. O’Donnell stated thoughtfully: “The problem is, it’s 12 years since the last album so it becomes precious.” There is an internal competition alongside their classic discography also: “When you’ve got a back catalogue like The Cure, it’s a lot to live up to. Robert has said, ‘If The Cure says any more, it had better be important and it better be good!”\n\nFantastically, The Cure’s upcoming record is not the only confirmed project fans can look forward to hearing. Chatting backstage at the NME Awards earlier this year, Robert Smith confirmed that “there are only really two new albums”, referring to the reported third album as “just an hour of noise.” Speaking on the mysterious upcoming project, Robert Smit said: “The first one will definitely be out. We’re just wrapping it up now, it’s going to be mixed. Until it’s out, no one would believe me. I look forward to it coming out, more than anybody else – trust me.”\n\nFormed in 1978 after meeting in school, the original members of the era-defining band formed in Crawley, West Sussex. Robert Smith, guitarist and vocalist, has been the only constant member of the band. Integral to the new wave of post-punk that circulated Britain in the 1980s, The Cure carved a niche sound that echoes through the generations. Penning hits like Just Like Heaven, Close to Me and Boys Don’t Cry, The Cure has an expansive catalogue, producing both eerie lullaby tracks and commercial feel-good hits. With 13 albums, 2 EPs, and 30 standalone singles, to say that The Cure’s discography is impressive would be a gross understatement. An emblem of British music and an inspiration for musicians even to this day, The Cure will go down in history for their distinct sound – sometimes tormented, sometimes angty, or catchy, but always hauntingly beautiful.\n\nPhoto Credit: Raymond Flotat"
