        "text": "SWAN, Circuit Judge.\n\nAt various dates between December 22, 1924, and June 10, 1925, the plaintiff steamship company brought to the port of New York six aliens, each of whom was excluded by the immigration officials because of some physical defect which might affect his ability to earn a living. Aliens who are found to possess such defects and are so certified by the examining surgeon are excluded from admission to the United States by section 3 of the Immigration Act of 1917 (8 USCA § 136). Section 21, however, permits the Secretary of Labor to admit them in his discretion upon the giving of a suitable bond (8 USCA § 158); but it is not alleged that any of the six aliens in question was so admitted. With respect to each of them a fine was imposed upon the plaintiff under section 9 as amended (8 USCA § 145), which plaintiff paid under protest to the defendant collector of the port of New York. This suit was brought to recover the sums so paid, aggregating some $2,100.\n\nThe complaint contains six counts, each of which sets up a distinct cause of action based upon one of the several fines. Each count alleged transportation by plaintiff from Germany to the United States of an alien who exhibited a proper German passport and a quota immigration visa issued by an American consul; the exclusion and order to deport the alien because of a physical defect certified by the examining surgeon to be such as might affect his earning ability; the imposition of a fine upon plaintiff despite its submission of evidence to the Secretary of Labor in opposition to the proposed fine; plaintiff's payment of the fine under protest, and defendant's covering of part of the fine into the Treasury of the United States and delivery of the rest (the passage money) to the alien. These allegations the defendant's answer admits. Each count further alleged that the act of the Secretary of Labor in imposing the fine was without lawful authority and arbitrary; that in transporting the alien plaintiff acted on the visa of the American consul and the fact that the alien was a proper subject for admission under section 21 of the Immigration Act of 1917; that the alleged inadmissibility of the alien could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence by plaintiff prior to the alien's departure from the port of embarkation; and that demand for payment had been made by plaintiff and refused by defendant. These allegations the answer denied. Upon these pleadings, judgment was entered for the plaintiff, and a certificate of probable cause was granted pursuant to section 989 of the Revised Statutes (28 USCA § 842).\n\nBy the terms of section 9 of the Immigration Act of 1917 as amended (8 USCA § 145), under which the Secretary of Labor assumed to act in imposing the fines upon plaintiff, no fine can be assessed unless \"it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Labor\" that the physical defect of the alien \"might have been detected by means of a competent medical examination\" at the time of his foreign embarkation. This fact would seem to be put in issue by the plaintiff's allegation that the inadmissibility of the alien was not then ascertainable by the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the defendant's denial thereof. Hence a judgment on the pleadings can be sustained only if the issue raised can be said to be immaterial. Plaintiff so argues, and this view was accepted by the court below.\n\nIt is contended that since section 21 (8 USCA § 158) gives the Secretary of Labor discretion to admit upon bond aliens liable to be excluded because of physical defects which may impair their earning ability, such aliens must be privileged to come to the United States to invoke exercise by the Secretary of his discretion to admit them, and hence section 9 cannot reasonably be construed to impose a fine upon the transportation company which brings them here for that purpose. However persuasive this argument might appear if addressed to Congress, it cannot justify a court in overriding express statutory provisions to the contrary. Section 9 (8 USCA § 145) declares that \"it shall also be unlawful for any person to bring to any port of the United States\" physically defective aliens, and it expressly imposes a fine for so doing, if the Secretary of Labor be satisfied that the defect existed at the time of foreign embarkation and might then have been detected by a competent medical examination. The validity of similar provisions in the Act of March 3, 1903 (32 Stat. 1215) was adjudged in Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U. S. 320, 29 S. Ct. 671, 53 L. Ed. 1013. By this language Congress expressly prohibited the bringing in of defective aliens. Of section 9 (8 USCA § 145) no less than of section 19 (8 USCA § 155) it may be said that it \"is not aimed at the aliens of the excluded class, but at the owners of vessels unlawfully bringing them into this country.\" United States v. Nord Deutscher Lloyd, 223 U. S. 512, 517, 32 S. Ct. 244, 245, 56 L. Ed. 531. Section 21 (8 USCA § 158) on the other hand, deals with aliens liable to be excluded because likely to become a public charge or because of physical disability (excepting certain named diseases), and says nothing concerning the owners of vessels who bring such aliens to this country. To hold that the latter section in effect repealed the former would run counter to accepted canons of statutory construction. There is no necessary conflict between them. Moreover, the last sentence of section 9 (as amended by 43 Stat. 167 8 USCA § 145) forbids the construction contended for. That sentence reads:\n\n\"Provided further, That nothing contained in this section shall be construed to subject transportation companies to a fine for bringing to ports of the United States aliens who are by any of the provisos or exceptions to section 3 of this Act exempted from the excluding provisions of said section.\""
