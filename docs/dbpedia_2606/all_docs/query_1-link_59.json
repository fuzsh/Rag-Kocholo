        "text": "Gloomy skies, rain and unseasonable chill are seldom complementary elements for an outdoor concert.\n\nBut have you met the Cure?\n\nThe fabled British group’s performance Tuesday night, June 13, at the Pine Knob Music Theatre — its first metro area stop since 2004 — took place under those bad weather conditions, a fitting setting for a body of musical work dominated by angst and melancholy (albeit with some notable exceptions). The group even rolled thunder and rain sound effects over the PA rather than the usual warm-up music, and the name of the opening band was, appropriately the Twilight Sad (from Scotland) — whose frontman, James Graham, was kind enough to apologize for the weather.\n\nBut the Cure warmed things up in short order, making up for nearly two decades of absence with a 28-song, two-hour-and-40-minute concert show that, given no new album in 15 years, celebrated past glories but did offer glimpses of what’s to come.\n\nFollowing the Twilight Sad’s solid opening set, the Cure came on stage to a rapturous welcome from the sold-out Pine Knob crowd. Frontman Robert Smith — sporting an Eraserhead T-shirt and his trademark mane of high-piled hair now salt-and-pepper — took a full three minutes to bask in the applause before leading the band into “Alone,” one of several new songs on the set list that began ironically, with the lyric “This is the end of every song we sing.”\n\nThere were more where that came from, too. With a new album, “Songs of a Lost World,” promised — but not yet released, though it gave this tour its name — Smith and company also introduced the Detroit metro audience to the dense groove of “A Fragile Thing,” the textured, hypnotic “Endsong,” the emotive “I Can Never Say Goodbye” and the gauzy and hypnotic “And Nothing is Forever.” All fit nicely within the Cure’s particular brand of sturm und drang, with Reeves Gabrels’ avant guitar heroics featured on most.\n\nThe bulk of the night, however, focused on the Cure’s 80s material, and who wasn’t there for that? Playing in front of a multi-section video screen and curating the show to build in intensity as the skies darkened, the Cure dug in deep for the likes of “Burn,” “Cold,” “At Night,” “39,” the rocking “Shake Dog Shake,” “A Strange Day” and a particularly epic “One Hundred Years,” lightening the proceedings by dotting in occasional favorites such as “Pictures of You” and “Lovesong.” Bassist Simon Gallup was, as usual, the physical foil on stage, while drummer Jason Cooper was both steady and explosive and Smith, Gabrels and Perry Bamonte crafted a murky soundscape with their guitars, accented by Roger O’Donnell’s keyboards.\n\nThe show’s second encore, meanwhile, was the “payoff” for those who wanted the hits, a breezy and breathless half-hour blast through “Lullaby,” “The Walk,” “Friday I’m in Love,” “Close to Me,” “Why Can’t I Be You?,” “In Between Days,” “Just Like Heaven” and the concluding “Boys Don’t Cry.” There were far more smiles than tears by that point, and without question a hope among the 15,000 or so that it won’t be another 19 years before we see the Cure in these parts again."
