        "text": "The Elkinton Photo collection includes hundreds of photos of early Monterey buildings, city vistas, major city events, people, and more.\n\nThese have been organized to help researchers focus on targets of interest, but we have included a \"catch-all\" page for photos of unknown buildings, small groups of photos of a known building, and other artifacts where a dedicated page was not deemed necessary.\n\nThe collection also includes a large number of local and California history books, pamphlets, magazines, and other items. Also, the collection includes a large number of archive boxes containing documents, photos, and historic artifacts collected by Amelie. A brief description of the contents of the archive boxes is provided below."
