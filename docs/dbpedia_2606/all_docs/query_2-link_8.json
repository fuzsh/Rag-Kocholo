        "text": "Roger O\\'Donnell (born 29 October 1955) is an English keyboardist best known for his work with The Cure. O\\'Donnell has also performed in The Psychedelic Furs, Thompson Twins and Berlin, as well as having an active solo career.\\n', '\n\nO\\'Donnell was born in East London into a musical family, next to the piano in his parents\\' London home. O\\'Donnell attended art school but left to pursue a career as a professional musician, with his first paying gig coming in 1976, at Oxford Town Hall backing legendary British pop icon Arthur Brown.\\n', '\n\nO\\'Donnell joined the Thompson Twins as a live keyboardist in July 1983, playing alongside future Cure bandmate and drummer Boris Williams. Both completed the Side Kicks Tour in 1983 and also played with the band on the Into the Gap/Out of the Gap tours in 1984. In the early 1980s, while with the Thompson Twins, Berlin, and the Psychedelic Furs, O\\'Donnell was a big fan of synthesisers produced by Sequential Circuits, which produced such classics as the Prophet 5, Prophet T8, and Prophet VS. While on tour with the Psychedelic Furs, O\\'Donnell set the record for having the most Sequential models onstage at one time.\\n', '"
