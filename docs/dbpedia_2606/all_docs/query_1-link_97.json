        "text": "Is Mary the new Samantha?\n\nThe Sex and the City pals are making room for one more at the table.\n\nRosie O’Donnell announced via Instagram that she’s joining And Just Like That… for its upcoming third season. The actress and former The View moderator posted a photo showing off her script for the season’s first episode and a nameplate that says her character’s name is Mary.\n\nO’Donnell also shared a photo of herself with shoulder-length gray hair and no glasses. “here comes mary #andjustlikethat,” she wrote in her caption.\n\nO'Donnell's post also confirmed that showrunner Michael Patrick King will write and direct the first episode of the season, which is titled \"Outlook Good.\"\n\nO’Donnell’s joining And Just Like That comes in the wake of two prominent cast members departing the show. Sara Ramirez, whose stand-up comedian character Che Diaz served as the primary love interest for Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), will not return for the third season. Additionally, Karen Pittman, who played Miranda’s professor-turned-roommate Nya Wallace, will also be absent from the third season due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nMax confirmed O’Donnell’s casting in the series and declined to comment further. However, given that Nixon’s two primary scene partners (outside of Sarah Jessica Parker’s Carrie and Kristin Davis’ Charlotte, of course) have departed the series, it may be safe to assume that O’Donnell’s character might play a significant role in Miranda’s storyline this season.\n\nO’Donnell has recently appeared in a number of other buzzy TV series, including American Gigolo, A League of Their Own, I Know This Much is True, and The L Word: Generation Q.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nRelated content:\n\nAnd Just Like That star Karen Pittman won't be back for season 3\n\nSara Ramirez exits And Just Like That as Che Diaz ahead of season 3\n\nBreaking news: Carrie Bradshaw can make eggs"
