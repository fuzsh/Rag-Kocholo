It was released on 19 March 1990 by Fiction Records as the fourth and final single from the band's eighth studio album, Disintegration (1989). The song has a single version which is a shorter edit of the album version. The single reached No. 24 on the UK Singles Charts.[5]\n\nThere are also two different remixes on two UK 12-inch singles, and other singles released around the world, one of which later appeared on Mixed Up as the Extended Dub Mix and differs significantly from the album version in arrangement in that incorporates wholly original drum and bass arrangements. The other is an extended remix of the original album version which, at 7:59, runs slightly longer than the album version. There is also an edit which was released on 12-inch in the US, titled \"extended remix\" as in the European and Australasian releases, but which runs for 6:40 rather than 7:59.\n\nIn 2011, the song was voted number 283 on Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list.[6] In 2019, Billboard ranked the song number nine on their list of the 40 greatest Cure songs,[7] and in 2023, Mojo ranked the song number 11 on their list of the 30 greatest Cure songs.[8]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to interviews, the inspiration of the song came when a fire broke loose in Robert Smith's home. After that day, Smith was going through the remains and came across his wallet which had pictures of his wife, Mary. The cover of the single is one of the pictures. The same picture was used as the cover of the \"Charlotte Sometimes\" single, but that image was heavily warped and distorted.\n\nThe song is composed in the key of A major.[9]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Tim Pope–directed video was shot using three Super-8 cameras in Ballachulish, Scotland, during the February 1990 \"week of the big snow\", with Robert Smith mentioning that he had never been colder before.[10]\n\nCovers\n\n[edit]\n\nAngie Hart's version was used for a TAC (Transport Accident Commission) ad campaign to combat speeding drivers.[11][12]\n\nLit covered the song for their 2004 eponymous album Lit.\n\nBlankenberge made a version of the song and released it as their debut single in 2016.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\n7-inch single (1)\n\n\"Pictures of You\" (Single edit) – 4:46\n\n\"Last Dance\" (live) – 4:42[13]\n\n7-inch single (2)\n\n\"Pictures of You\" (Single edit) – 4:46\n\n\"Prayers for Rain\" (live) – 4:48\n\n12-inch single (1)\n\n\"Pictures of You\" (Extended version) – 8:07[14]\n\n\"Last Dance\" (live) – 4:41\n\n\"Fascination Street\" (live) – 5:23\n\n12-inch single (2)\n\n\"Pictures of You\" (Strange mix) – 6:45[15]\n\n\"Prayers for Rain\" (live) – 4:48\n\n\"Disintegration\" (live) – 7:54\n\nCD single\n\n\"Pictures of You\" (Single edit) – 4:46\n\n\"Last Dance\" (live) – 4:45\n\n\"Fascination Street\" (live) – 5:19\n\n\"Prayers for Rain\" (live) – 4:48\n\n\"Disintegration\" (live) – 7:54\n\nCD single (2)\n\n\"Pictures of You\" (Single edit) – 4:46\n\n\"Last Dance\" (live) – 4:45\n\n\"Fascination Street\" (live) – 5:19\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1990) Peak\n\nposition Australia (ARIA)[16] 89 Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)[17] 51 Germany (Official German Charts)[18] 18 Ireland (IRMA)[19] 9 Netherlands (Single Top 100)[20] 77 UK Singles (OCC)[21] 24 US Billboard Hot 100[22] 71 US Alternative Airplay (Billboard)[23] 19\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales United Kingdom (BPI)[24] Silver 200,000‡\n\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nRobert Smith – vocals, Bass VI, keyboards, producer\n\nPorl Thompson – guitar\n\nSimon Gallup – bass\n\nBoris Williams – drums\n\nRoger O'Donnell – keyboards\n\nLol Tolhurst – credited with \"other instrument\"; does not actually play on this track\n\nBryan 'Chuck' New – remix"
