        "text": "Hmmm. It's been a long time since I listened to Disintegration. And going into this, I was thinking \"Pictures of You\" a good song rendered way too long....but I'll be damned if listening to it a few times this morning hasn't totally changed my mind. It is a masterpiece, Robert's circular composition (I think this is Robert's song, mainly -- Roger O'Donnell's blog that somoene linked to yesterday has some info about that, though not particularly clearly written...) supports the lyric, which is actually one of Robert's most interesting. No mouths, squashed guts, dreams, angels or deep water here! But a cold white lover who smiles, which seems to be a developing Cure cliche...\n\nThe lyric which nostalgically depicts the memory of a lover who is (again) lost, cold, white and freezing cold but whose smile pierces the heart, is one of sad break up, with the picture in the narrator's mind no longer matching the physical photo.\n\nThis is an awesome, romantic song of loss.\n\n5/5\n\nPictures Of You\n\nSo much from so little. Weeks ago, I lambasted Primary for being a boring two chord trudge, and yet here we are with a mid-paced, two chord song that is utterly, utterly perfect.\n\nThe arrangement and the sonic pallette are just brilliant, somehow maintaining interest across almost eight minutes. The changes are few, but when they come (that ascending chord progression, \"there was nothing in the world...\") are all the more monumental for being so scarce. Lyrically, this is as gothically poetic as anything they ever did. It brings to mind the likes of Byron or Shelley. It's a beautiful set of words, delivered in one of RS's most believable vocal performances.\n\nIt had never occurred to me until now, but between this and The Same Deep Water As You, I wonder whether Pre-Raphaelite art like Millais' 'Ophelia' was a direct influence on the album artwork. I might be reaching, but it wouldn't surprise me at all. It all fits.\n\nIs this my favourite Cure song? No, but does it summarise everything great about The Cure in song? Well, no it doesn't quite do that either.... But somehow I feel like this has bragging rights as the most elementally perfect thing RS ever did and the essence of The Cure is definitely in there.\n\nI love the album version that milks the emotion out of every last second, and I also love the 7\" edit - I love that pause in the drumming that they have incorporated live ever since.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the beautiful Fender VI lead part...\n\n5/5\n\nPictures Of You...\n\nWhat a long way this came from the Cocteau Twins soundalike that the initial demo presented.\n\nEverything about this song is a plus point, the arrangement, instruments, the playing, the production, fantastic.\n\nThe use of a real electric sitar finally gives The Cure a true organic feel, gone is the synth sitar of the previous album.\n\nRobert's Bass VI is just incredible on this, one of the finest examples of his uses of it, although the remainder of the album throws up some other excellent instances.\n\nThe descending bells in the intro is another iconic part of this song, although should I being saying 'was iconic'....? Given they've since used the same trick on about 56 other songs.\n\nThe bassline is just incredible too, very simple but like the engine of a huge truck powering everything along.\n\nDefinitely one of Robert's lyrical highpoints, on this album in particular he sounds the most convincing that he ever did.\n\nYeah love it, to like The Cure and not like this song basically means you actually just think you like The Cure.\n\nIncredible.\n\n\"Pictures of You\"\n\nDuring the last few albums there were some criticisms of Robert's vocals - sometimes going too histrionic, reaching too far etc. No such issues here - this may be his greatest vocal of all, pitched just at the right level of passionate and yearning. Coupled with an irresistible groove of intertwined bass guitars, it makes this track into a winner. Does it need to be seven and a half minutes long? No, but it doesn't particularly drag at any stage, and it carries you along with a slight variation to the tune at just the right time. There is better still to come on this album, but we are already off to an impressive start. 5/5.\n\n\"Pictures of You\"\n\nThere's nothing more nostalgic than rifling through old photographs and \"Pictures of You\" is soaked in that longing and wistful feel that The Cure do so brilliantly. But there's so much more to enjoy here - a ton of melody, chord changes to die for and it just flows so ̶m̶a̶j̶e̶s̶t̶i̶c̶a̶l̶l̶y̶ elegantly. Simon's excellent bass provides a crucial backbone and I love the wonky sitar-like guitar once the verse gets going. The chord progressions in particular are gorgeous and beautifully applied especially the way it soars into the bridge which forever gets me just as Robert sings \"There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more\". It absolutely soars!!!\n\nIt's funny how the mythology of the house fire has developed (apparently the lyrics were saved) but it makes a great story, one that I'm sure Robert revelled in exploiting. One thing that puzzled me was why the long wait to release a single after \"Lovesong\" in August. The album was clearly taking a life of its own in the summer of '89 but they waited another six months until \"Pictures...\" was released (in a brutally edited mix). Releasing \"Fascination Street\" in the autumn (in the UK at least) would have made perfect sense.\n\n5/5\n\nPictures of You\n\nThis song has cost me so much money. Not because of the 15 available single formats (though it didn't help) but because it was where I realised that he used a different kind of guitar. I first noticed during the concert because it sounded wrong from where on the neck he plays, and it had such a long neck. So began a bit of an obsession with this instrument.\n\nAnyway. Pictures of You. A leisurely tempo, but we run through hook after hook after hook after hook. And then towards the end the thing soars again into the there was nothing in the world bit. Probably my most played song. Impossible to tire of. I only wish they would play it live more often.\n\n5/5\n\nI think. more than any other of their songs, Pictures Of You could be described as quintessential Cure. Whether it be in the full or shorter format, this song encapsulates everything which makes them so great; not just to long-term, hard-bitten aficionados like us, but to the more casual listeners who became seduced by its, yes, majesty. I recall many people I knew at the time who weren't Cure fans or even particularly big music fans, picking up on this one due to its radio play and feeling the penny drop.\n\nIt's an absolutely gorgeous song in which every facet combines to create as near to a perfect whole as almost anything else I can think of. The chiming bells are a wonderful entry point and the brilliantly understated guitar motif meanders its way to the lovely little keyboard flourish which lifts us into the main riff. The modulation (?) at around 4:30 turns another blissful corner in which the guitar and the sitar like sound interweave and then we have the reprise of the vocals to lead us into the final section. The ending is one of my favourite endings of any song; it's like a plane making a faultless touchdown after a blissful flight.\n\nHis vocals capture the wistful melancholy of the song and deliver one his finest the lyrics with heartfelt veracity. As Lance points out, there's no dark, pseudo-gothic imagery here to put off the squeamish and I think the quality of the writing and its artful description of universal feelings is another factor which drew in the previously uncommitted. There are so many great lines at play here and the opening verse alone is a classic. I've always loved the vision of her being \"bigger and brighter and wider than snow\", how the lovers\" kissed as the sky fell in\" and the sad, final resignation of \"and you finally found all your courage to let it all go\". That last is one a par with Bob Dylan's \"I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free\" from If You See Her Say Hello, which is possibly the greatest break-up song of all time.\n\nQuite simply, Pictures Of You is a masterpiece.\n\nIs it not a fixture? I believe it has been consistently played on the Songs of a Lost World shows at least.\n\nThat got me thinking: Cure singles are often a bit atypical of the band. Not that the pop stuff isn't as much a legitimate part of what they do than anything else, but they do maybe give a misleading idea of what the albums are like. Songs like \"Pictures of You\", \"Just Like Heaven\" and \"A Letter to Elise\" are rare glimpses on mainstream radio of the more 'serious' side of the Cure."
