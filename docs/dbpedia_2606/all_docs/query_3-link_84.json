        "text": "The Cure's International Information Service published Cure News - a free newsletter sent to fans who supplied a postage paid self-addressed envelope. It ran from 1986-2000.\n\nEach issue was compiled and distributed by Janie Webber and then by Chris White.\n\nCure News provided everything from information about music releases and concerts, to trivia and the band's answers to questions sent in by fans. A number of limited edition postcards and signed photos were distributed to many lucky fans. Exclusive competition prizes were made available to readers, and access was given to specially produced limited edition releases included the Lost Wishes cassette tape, Five Swing Live CD, and Galore VHS.\n\nWhen Cure News introduced the Cure Friends section, it became a lifeline for many, allowing fans to communicate with each other from all over the world, long before the advent of the internet and social media. In later issues Stop Press announced special events that fans could attend such as TV shows, premieres, and Cure Drinks; London-based fan meet ups.\n\nThe service came to an end in 2000 when it became clear that the internet was only going to make communication between fans and the band easier and faster, and the need for a printed newsletter immediately became obsolete.\n\nThis site contains the entire Cure News archive from The International Information Service for you to enjoy again or delve into for the first time.\n\nWe hope you enjoy reading it as much as we've enjoyed putting it all together. Do keep checking back, as we are planning to share some of our special personal Treasures in the coming months; plus we have plans to further develop the website by including lots of other Cure related material which we think and hope you'll find interesting!\n\nPlease also follow us on Facebook, Twitter & Instagram.\n\nJanie & Chris"
