And 100 films, she has “earned” her “me time”.\n\nManisha took to Instagram, where she shared a slew of pictures, which she captioned: “A lot of people ask me what I'm doing these days...some genuinely asking but sometimes it's like asking at 53 you couldn't be doing much...true !!”\n\nShe added: “But happy too for I'm tasting different flavours of life, doing only those things I love and that means, at times doing absolutely nothing and relaxing with my cats and dogs or with books, music and perusing spiritual learnings, learning to sing and dance, walk in the nature, gymming, globe-trotting..”\n\n“After 30 years and 100 films I think I have earned my me time...l work when I know I would love the process of work!!”\n\nAlso Read: Rajkumar Rao pens b'day note for 'love' Patralekha: You complete me\n\nManisha said: “I soak in their love and care...having lived alone most of my life in a buzzing city with the most demanding profession that I adore yet filled with uncertainty not to forget being a celebrity, one has to face too many ups and downs, good and bad people...good media and harmful fake news...without security of supportive circle of people and all alone !!”\n\n“I guess being younger one had the zeal to take the world head-on...besides I think in your most loneliest times god sends angels and I had very handful of true friends !!! My memories are timeless treasures of my heart... like life, good and bad, happy and sad…”\n\nManisha concluded: “You see now I prefer much quieter, slower, fewer shocks, less drama, no more impulsive decisions but a thorough thought out long term thing... co-creating peaceful, happy, healthy wholesome life !!”\n\nAlso Read: Babita Phogat visits Suhani Bhatnagar’s home to pay tribute to the late artiste\n\nManisha stepped into the world of acting with the Nepali film Pheri Bhetaula in 1989.
