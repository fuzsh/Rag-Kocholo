        "text": "The Tribeca Film Festival for 2021 has unveiled its full lineup of features on Tuesday, and among them are two documentaries in the Spotlight section on musician Rick James and TV personality Anthony Bourdain.\n\nThose two films are just some of the highlights on a lineup that includes 66 films from 81 filmmakers from 23 different countries and 56 world premieres. It also features a lineup that’s 60% female, BIPOC and LGBTQ+ filmmakers.\n\nThis year’s Tribeca Festival is the 20th anniversary edition after last year’s event could not be in-person. And this year’s festival will return to live, in-person events at outdoor venues across all New York City boroughs. And many of the films will also be available for U.S. audiences to view online the day after they premiere in person through the Tribeca at Home virtual hub. The festival runs June 9-20.\n\nThe documentary about James is “BITCHIN’: The Sound and Fury of Rick James,” as directed by Sacha Jenkins. The film captures the funk and R&B icon’s many peaks and valleys and long, storied career, and the film is a Showtime Documentary Films release. There’s also “Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain” that’s directed by Morgan Neville (“20 Feet From Stardom”) and will be released by CNN Films, HBO Max and Focus Features as it examines the humanity, energy and curiosity that made Bourdain a bad boy chef and superstar who had an impact on so many. Both films are playing in the Spotlight Documentary section.\n\nSome of the other highlights of this year’s Tribeca include the film “Italian Studies” starring Oscar-nominee Vanessa Kirby and “No Man of God” starring Elijah Wood, and “False Positive” starring Ilana Glazer, all three of which are in the Spotlight Narrative section. There’s also documentaries playing in competition including a film called “The Kids” about the making of the ’90s indie cult classic “Kids,” as well as “Like a Rolling Stone: The Life & Times of Ben Fong-Torres,” a profile on the famed journalist and editor at Rolling Stone magazine.\n\n“Despite the challenges our industry faced this past year, it did not stop filmmakers, artists, and storytellers from creating compelling, entertaining, and thought-provoking content,” Paula Weinstein, chief content officer of Tribeca Enterprises, said in a statement. “The selections for each of these categories represent the tenacity and commitment of our creative community and we are so proud to include them as part of this year’s Festival and share them with our returning in-person audiences.”\n\n“After a year of closed cinemas, canceled gatherings, and virtual everything, it is with joy and hope that we finally invite New Yorkers out of their homes and back to the movies. Immersed in the city itself, Tribeca 2021 will bring once-in-a-lifetime big-screen experiences to filmmakers and audiences alike as we reconnect, re-imagine, and reopen through the shared experience of film,” Cara Cusumano, festival director and vice president of programming for the Tribeca Festival, said in a statement.\n\n“In celebration of the reopening of New York’s cultural life, Tribeca’s 20th anniversary International Competition will introduce a new generation of storytellers from around the world who will premiere their films at a time when the preciousness of big screens has never been more appreciated or missed. Inventive, thrilling and compelling, the films are, at their essence, about human connections. This simple theme can take infinite paths, and in the hands of these engaging storytellers, the emotion in these stories transcend countries, languages, and cultures with an intimacy that is ultimately human,” Frédéric Boyer, artistic director, said.\n\nThis year’s Tribeca will also include special curated programming for Juneteenth, including the Rick James film, and will celebrate voices from the African Diaspora with an emphasis on African-American artists, performers, filmmakers, and interdisciplinary creators.\n\nJon M. Chu’s adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical “In the Heights” will be the opening night film of the 2021 Tribeca Festival, as was previously announced.\n\nThe Tribeca Festival is curated by festival director and VP of programming Cara Cusumano; artistic director Frédéric Boyer, VP of filmmaker relations & shorts programming Sharon Badal; senior programmer and VP of Immersive Loren Hammonds; senior programmers Liza Domnitz (features, TV, and NOW), and Lucy Mukerjee (features); programmers Ben Thompson (shorts), José F. Rodriguez (features); Karen McMullen (features), Leah Sarbib (podcasts); and program advisor Paula Weinstein, along with a team of associate programmers.\n\nAdditional programming, including the festival’s shorts lineup, will be announced in the coming weeks.
