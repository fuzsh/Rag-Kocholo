He has won six National Film Awards, four Filmfares, and six Filmfare South awards. In 2002, the Indian government awarded him the Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian awards. \n\nRatnam was born to a film family in #Madras but originally didn’t want to go into the industry, getting an MBA instead and becoming a consultant. Bored with his job and after reconnecting with an old friend, he reconsidered and has delivered some of the biggest commercial and critical hits. \n\nRatnam is best known for his terrorism trilogy: #Roja (1992), #Bombay (1995), and #DilSe.. (1998) as well as his love trilogy, #MounaRagam (1986), #AlaiPayuthey (2000, and #OKhadhaiKanmani (2005). \n\n#DilSe was his Hindi film debut and starred #ShahRukhKhan (@iamsrk), #ManishaKoirala, and #PreityZinta in her debut. The film saw average success in India, but became a huge hit among diaspora audiences, who appreciated the love story and the legendary @arrahman soundtrack, which included #ChaiyyaChaiyya, #JiyaJale, and #DilSeRe. \n\nAs soon as long-time collaborator @arrahman showed him “Chaiyya Chaiyya,” Ratnam knew he wanted to shoot it on a train. #SRK called it a scary experience because there was no CGI or special effects — all the dancers indeed performed on a slow moving train. \n\nRatnam’s most recent releases include Tamil epic dramas #PonniyinSelvanI (2022) and its sequel, #PonniyinSelvanII (2023). \n\nWhat’s your favorite #ManiRatnam film? 👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾\n\nRead more about Ratnam’s work at the link in bio, then click this image 🔗\".",
