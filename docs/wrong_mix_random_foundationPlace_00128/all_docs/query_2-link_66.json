        "text": "Heeramandi actress Manisha Koirala has revealed having missed a major opportunity to work with Yash Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan. In an interview, Koirala noted that she was offered the role of Nisha in Dil To Pagal Hai, which eventually went to Karisma Kapoor.\n\nShe also stated the reason for rejecting the role. According to her, she couldn't agree on the plot that Madhuri's character Pooja was pitted against Nisha. However, she also said that rejecting the movie was one of her biggest regrets.\n\nThe Dil Se star further added that she was scared of starring against Madhuri Dixit, who was a big star by then. However, the two of them worked together later for the movie Lajja."
