        "text": "Manisha Koirala’s soul-stirring performance in Heeramandi as Mallikajaan comes as no surprise given her past work. From 1942: A Love Story to Dil Se.. and Bombay, Manisha Koirala has time and again shown her prowess as a performer. But did you know that throughout her long-spanning career, Koirala has rejected several blockbuster films that eventually fell into the lap of Karisma Kapoor?\n\nHere are 4 blockbuster movies Manisha Koirala rejected that went on to star Karisma Kapoor:\n\n1. Dil To Pagal Hai\n\nWhile Karisma Kapoor gave us major second lead syndrome as Nisha in Dil To Pagal Hai, the role was originally meant for Manisha Koirala. The talented actress, in an interview with Zoom, shared the reason why she rejected the role: “It was my insecurity, foolishness, childishness. One of the biggest dreams of an actress is to shoot with Yash Chopra so when he offered me Dil To Pagal Hai, I should have grabbed it. I should have taken on the challenge. Madhuri [Dixit] ji bahut hi khubsoorat adakara hai aur mujhe unse inspire hona chahiye tha lekin uss time akal nahi thi. [Madhuri is a very beautiful performer and I should have been inspired by her, but I didn’t have any sense back then.] So many reasons [behind her insecurity]. She was very beautiful and talented. I got insecure,” according to News18.\n\nDil To Pagal has Karisma Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit and Shah Rukh Khan in the lead roles. Kapoor also won the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for the film. Manisha Koirala and Dixit eventually collaborated on Lajja.\n\n2. Raja Hindustani\n\nKarisma Kapoor’s performance in Raja Hindustan opposite Aamir Khan became so popular that the audience wanted the film to be renamed Rani Hindustani. According to The Indian Express and Hindustan Times, Dharmesh Darshan had approached many actresses to play the female lead in Raja Hindustani before Kapoor made it her own. The actresses who rejected the film included names like Juhi Chawla, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Pooja Bhatt, and Manisha Koirala.\n\n3. Biwi No. 1\n\nThe script of Biwi No. 1 was sent to multiple leading ladies of Bollywood including Juhi Chawla, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Raveena Tandon, Pooja Bhatt, and even Manisha Koirala. Eventually, the role went to Karisma Kapoor who starred opposite Salman Khan in David Dhawan’s comedy classic.\n\n4. Zubeidaa\n\nIf there is one (of the many) gripping role Karisma Kapoor is truly known for, it’s Zubeidaa. According to India Today, before Karisma was finalised in and as Zubeidaa opposite Manoj Bajpayee, Shyam Benegal’s first choice was Manisha Koirala. However, the actress passed on the role and the rest is history."
