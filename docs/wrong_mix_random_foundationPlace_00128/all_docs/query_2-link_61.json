        "text": "Manisha Koirala, who will soon be seen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, spoke about the biggest regret of her Bollywood career.\n\nKoirala, who made her Bollywood debut in 1991 with Saudagar, is best known for starring in popular movies like 1942: A Love Story, Bombay, Akele Hum Akele Tum, Khamoshi: The Musical, Dil Se.., and Company.\n\nDespite all her success, Koirala has one big regret in her Bollywood career, which is rejecting the Yash Chopra directed blockbuster Dil To Pagal Hai.\n\nYash Chopra approached numerous actresses to star opposite Madhuri Dixit in Dil To Pagal Hai. Before the role was finally accepted by Karishma Kapoor, the role was offered to top actresses like Urmila Matondkar, Kajol, Raveena Tandon, and Juhi Chawla, all of whom backed out of the film.\n\nSpeaking about her regret of rejecting Dil To Pagal Hai, Koirala said, “One of the regrets that I have in my career is that I didn't do Yash Chopra's film. I was pitted against Madhuri Dixit, and I got scared. I backed out of that project.”\n\nYears later, in 2001, Koirala did star opposite Madhuri Dixit, and also Rekha and Mahima Chaudhry, in Rajkumar Santoshi’s Lajja.\n\nSpeaking about her experience of working with Madhuri Dixit in Lajja, Koirala said, “Madhuri Ji is such a good person and actress. There was no need for me to be insecure. I think when you have a strong actor in front of you, you only perform better. They encourage you to perform better. That comes from age and experience. I loved working with Madhuri Ji in that movie. I loved working with Rekha Ji as well.”\n\nHeeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, which also stars Sonakshi Sinha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Richa Chadha, Sanjeeda Sheikh, and Sharmin Segal, will be streaming on Netflix starting 1st May."
