        "text": "The trailer for 'Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar' has been released, captivating everyone with its impactful dialogues and stunning set design. Regarded as Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s passion project, the series promises to elevate storytelling to new heights. But before gaining fame for his grandiose films, Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed 'Khamoshi: The Musical,' featuring Nana Patekar, Salman Khan, Manisha Koirala, and Seema Biswas. Despite its initial failure at the box office, the film found audience over the years. Now, after two decades, Bhansali and Koirala have reunited for 'Heeramandi' where the actress will portray the powerful tawaif Mallikajaan.\n\nDuring the trailer launch event, the actress expressed her happiness on reuniting with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, stating, \"I waited 28 years for Sanjay to call me and it’s been a pleasure. It’s an honour to be working with that genius. A lot of hard work and pyaar mohabbat has gone into making Heermandi. We have made the show with so much love, and we expect you all to love it.”\n\nDiscussing her role in Heeramandi, Koirala emphasised that Mallikajaan is distinct from any character she has portrayed before. She attributes the perfection of the portrayal on screen to Bhansali. \"It was possible only because of a genius like Sanjay Leela Bhansali who was behind the camera. He directed each of us so minutely and with a lot of detail that we looked so good. We don’t know what we have done. He extracts it from you. I have always been a director’s actor, and cinema is a director’s medium, but when you’re on a Bhansali set, you have to give your extra.\"\n\nAbout Heeramandi\n\nThe historical drama series immerses viewers in an era where courtesans held sway akin to monarchs. Starring Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Richa Chaddha, Sanjeeda Shaikh and Sharmin Segal, the series portrays tawaifs who transition from holding influence over Nawabs to confronting English oppression.\n\nFardeen Khan, Taha Shah Badussha, Shekhar Suman, and Adhyayan Suman are set to portray the Nawabs in the series. Taha Shah Badussha embodies Tajdar Baloch, a charismatic individual who effortlessly captivates others with his magnetic charm. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's web series 'Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar' is set to premiere on Netflix on May 1.\n\nALSO READ: Fardeen Khan Gets Emotional As He Talks About Comeback With Heeramandi After 14 Years, Says 'Grateful For The Opportunity...'"
