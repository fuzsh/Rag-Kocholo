        "text": "'I have come full circle'\n\nWith a pivotal role in Rajkumar Santoshi's Lajja, and a special appearance in the Kamal Haasan psycho-thriller -- Abhay, Manisha has made a comeback of sorts.\n\nOn the pipeline includes the long in the making Moksha co-starring Arjun Rampal and Ram Gopal Verma's Company.\n\nLatika Sidana spoke to Manisha Koirala:\n\nHow was it working with Kamal Haasan for the second time after Hindustani? Also what difference do you see in the process of film making in the South and here?\n\nIt was wonderful. He is a thorough professional and a wonderful actor.\n\nTo answer your second question, the Southern film industry is very professional and well organized. But things are changing here too.\n\nActors have become more professional and punctual since large amounts of money are riding on their projects.\n\nIn Moksha Arjun Rampal was a rank newcomer, even then you agreed to do the role knowing that the story belongs to the hero. Why did you do that? What are the criteria's that you choose before signing a film?\n\nI have worked with the best of directors the best of actors. I have come full circle.\n\nToday I try to go in for a good script and see how can I contribute to a film. As far as Moksha is concerned, I did the film mainly because of Ashok Mehta. I have high regard for him.\n\nA lot of people have asked me this question. I don't mind if it is a male dominated story.\n\nI am not a greedy person. Such things don't matter to me.\n\nYou are doing a film called Escape to Afganistan. Tell us about your role.\n\nI am playing a girl who escapes from the Taliban. It is a true story based on Sushmita Banerjee's life.\n\nIt is a controversial role I can't talk about it.\n\nHow was it working in Lajja and be surrounded with so much talent?\n\nIt was a memorable experience. Madhuri, Rekha, Mahima and I hardly get to meet each other. It was a good experience.\n\nAre you happy with the way your career has shaped up?\n\nI couldn't have asked for more. Today producers directors distributors are ready to produce films with me.\n\nI don't have to be seen with X, Y, or Z to be successful, I get to call the shots, isn't that great?\n\nHuman beings are basically progressive by nature, they try to grow explore new horizons.\n\nGoing by that I think I have achieved a lot."
