        "text": "Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s lavishly mounted OTT series Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar takes us into the decked-up courts of Lahore’s Heeramandi ruled by tawaifs. Starring Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Richa Chadha, Sharmin Segal, Sanjeeda Sheikh, Taha Shah Badussha, Fardeen Khan and more, the show revolves around passion, power and politics that came into play in a nation that was on the brink of a revolution against the British rule.\n\nAhead of the show’s release, Filmfare spoke to the cast about what goes into the making of a Sanjay Leela Bhansali-helmed period drama.\n\nThere's a grandeur in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s sets down to the finer details. Was going onto set just like you always imagined or was there anything unexpected?\n\nManisha: I think it was much more than what I ever expected. I was in awe on my first day on set. Each room, each corner of Shahi Mahal was beautifully done.\n\nSharmin Sehgal: I have assisted on his sets before. The only difference this time was that I was in the frame. I was there as an actor and not a technician. The pressure on me as an actor was far more. But all of his worlds are beautiful. I wish you would've seen the Padmaavat set. Till date that's my favourite. Heeramandi is much bigger but the details of that last shot where Deepika Padukone runs into the fire. I was dumbfounded by it. Being an actor came with a different perspective. Anticipation is the worst thing you can do to yourself so it's best to just give in.\n\nRicha: On the sets of Ram-Leela, I remember that it wasn't just beautiful but since Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a Gujarati man and that was a story set in Kutch between the Rajadi and Saneda communities. They had beautiful artwork. There were so many references they used that perhaps nobody will pick up. But if you look at the frame it's just beautiful. It takes someone who is an aesthete to come up with that.\n\nHow much has the portrayal of a tawaif changed over the years from the old Bollywood?\n\nManisha: I think with Sanjay, there's a thorough research. The whole misconception that the tawaifs were sex workers isn't there anymore. They weren't. It's not like Kamatipura. Those days, this was the epitome of art and culture and tehzeeb. People used to come to them to get trained in the arts. They knew literature, classical dancing, nazakat, everything. It was a centre of art. In Heeramandi you see that. It isn't that cheap or misconstrued idea that they were sex workers.\n\nRicha: When you do research you realise there were categories. There were tawaifs - someone who was allowed to hold court, and do a thumri or kathak. Beneath them were women who were mirasis. They were also allowed to sing but they didn't have a kotha. And then there were women who did commercial sex work. This confusion where the term tawaif is loosely used isn't there anymore. Geographically where the tawaifs stayed all the artists and jewellery makers used to gravitate. Heeramandi was a thriving bazaar. Men from good families were sent there to learn tehzeeb. These women were the harbingers of etiquette. I hope through our portrayals there is some degree of respect for these women.\n\nWhat was it like working on a female-led show and just being surrounded by talented women?\n\nSharmin: As an actor, any opportunity to work, you jump towards it. It activates parts of my brain that I want to juice which is my creativity. When I have people that help support that, my co-stars and there's a give and take, it's a good day at work. For so many actors work isn't work, it's something you want to give out. And when you have such talented and supportive people to do it with. It works out so well. While there is a lot of women empowerment, we also have to acknowledge that it's one man's vision. He understands how complex and layered a woman can be.\n\nRicha: I think Sanjay Leela Bhansali loves women and that comes through in the writing. Whatever he makes, the women are never props. They are always instrumental to the story and take the story forward. He could've started with anything but he started his career with Khamoshi which is a story of one girl and her parents. I really think that the dignity and the love he shows to women overflows onto the set as well.\n\nManisha: The way he shows women with so much character and depth. At the same time, they're so beautiful. I think it's marvellous to be an actor in his projects. It is a dream come true for all of us.\n\nSanjeeda: Sanjay sir possesses the authenticity and integrity with which he showcases women on camera. There's so much awareness and respect. Also, I think he writes such soulful characters. And that's why you can resonate with the character.\n\nWhat went into the grand dance sequences?\n\nRicha: My dance was very weepy. And for Sakal Ban none of us knew we were going to dance that day. Sanjay sir is a choreographer himself. He has an ear for beats that you and I don't have. He's hearing things that we can't hear.\n\nSharmin: Ya, to stand there is challenging. It's great to be a Sanjay Leela Bhansali heroine but to do a mujra in his show is difficult. It's a privilege. But your lehenga is so heavy and you have a hairdo and jewellery and your steps are constantly changing. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Till date one of his actresses I have the most respect for is Madhu Dixit. What she has done in Kahe Ched is jaw-dropping. When you understand what she has done you realise how much it takes.\n\nManisha, the last time you worked with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, you won a Filmfare award. Did you expect to reunite with him for such a grand project?\n\nManisha: I wasn't expecting it at all. Sanjay has been my friend over the years. We've shared a warmth but we never thought we'd work again after Khamoshi. As an actor, I've always wanted to be a part of his cinema. Especially now, when I was back home in Nepal. I was least expecting it when it came. It was a huge surprise.\n\nHow do you relate to the complicated characters you're playing?\n\nManisha: For my journey with Mallikajaan, I had to understand what Sanjay had to say and how he envisioned Mallikajaan to be. I had to read the script a couple of times and have conversations with him and figure out a road map in my own mind. Her reality, her trauma, why is she so insecure, why does she want to rule? In spite of the preparation, I have been discovering her scene by scene. There are new things that Sanjay brings in while we're shooting that aren't in the script. So we are navigating the characters while filming. In the scene she's drunk and he made me do some crazy stuff that wasn't in the script. I suggested it and it turned out to be so eerie and haunting. That's Mallikajaan and that's part of her that I didn't know before. One is always surprised on a set like that.\n\nSharmin: When I was in acting school I asked my teacher - Why is she doing this? And he said start by not judging your character. The only way you can empathise with your character is by not judging them. And that's what allows you to explore different facets. Alam is very situationally driven. Things happen to her and she makes a decision. My sister used to make fun of Alam and call her Delulu. And to commit to that was so hard because why is she doing all this? But afterwards, I realised I was judging her intentions instead of finding her reasons. After the first two weeks, I stopped questioning it. If you deliver it with confidence it'll fly. Now what the audience sees is her succumbing and overcoming situations.\n\nSpeaking of Delulu, Richa, what's the key to drunk/heartbroken acting that you deliver as Lajjo?\n\nRicha: You have to go into the mindset of a woman in the ‘40s. While everyone wants different things for themselves like freedom and revenge, there's this girl who just wants to have a husband. She wants that dignity and to settle down to lead a normal life. She lied to herself a million times to get that too comfortable in her mind. The discomfort with her reality makes her drink the way she does. When you get into that space and think what if my life was so complicated that I constantly needed to be high? That is pretty much the key to this tragic portrayal. I'm known for doing characters that are very different from this. I would never drink for any man. But this woman does and how do I remove myself from the equation was to not have any ego about it and then get into the skin of this completely Delulu woman.\n\nRicha, Ali Fazal reacted to your Heeramandi look and said you remind him of Meena Kumari…\n\nRicha: He's actually an old-world kind of guy and he's just the sweetest.\n\nSanjeeda, how did you delve into Waheeda’s world?\n\nSanjeeda: I also discovered my character more every day. Just by listening to the narrative and understanding what Sanjay Leela Bhansali wants from Waheeda. I started enjoying the dark side of the character. It was very interesting for me to portray that as an actor because that's not me in any facet of my life. After working for many years when you get to do something challenging as an actor you just want to be very good at it. When you have a master like SLB, you know he's there to bring out the best from you. So it's all there in everything that man says. I've groomed myself as an actor but also the technicalities of filmmaking. I understand camera and art direction. I think I'm a better technician too after working on Heeramandi’s set.\n\nHeeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar is currently streaming."
