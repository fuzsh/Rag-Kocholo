        "text": "Filmography article\n\nManisha Koirala is a Nepalese actress known for her work in Hindi and Tamil films.[1] Koirala's acting debut was in the Nepali film Pheri Bhetaula (1989).[2] Two years later, she made her Bollywood debut in Subhash Ghai's Saudagar, which was a commercial success.[3][4] However, she followed this by appearing in a series of films which performed poorly at the box office, including First Love Letter (1991), Anmol (1993), and Dhanwan (1993).[3] Koirala's career had a turnaround when she starred as the daughter of a freedom fighter in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's 1942: A Love Story (1994).[3][5][6][7] Her performance was critically acclaimed and she earned a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.[3][5][8] The following year, Koirala received the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil for playing a Muslim married to a Hindu during the 1992–1993 Bombay riots in the Mani Ratnam-directed Tamil drama Bombay (1995).[3][8][9][10]\n\nFor playing the daughter of a mute and deaf couple in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Khamoshi: The Musical (1996), Koirala garnered a second consecutive Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress.[3][9][11] She followed this with leading roles in Agni Sakshi (1996) and Gupt: The Hidden Truth (1997), which were among the highest-grossing Indian films of their respective years.[12][13] She played a terrorist opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Dil Se.. (1998), the first Indian film to reach the top ten in the United Kingdom box office.[14] However, Koirala's roles in films which performed poorly at the box office, such as Dil Ke Jharokhe Mein (1997), and Achanak (1998), led to a decline in her film career.[3][11] She made her television debut in 2000 as the co-host of the game show Sawaal Dus Crore Ka with Anupam Kher. The show's poor ratings led to both Kher and Koirala being fired.[15] For her role as a gangster's girlfriend in Ram Gopal Varma's 2002 crime drama Company, she received her third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress.[16][17][a] Koirala also appeared in the controversial film Ek Chhotisi Love Story in which she played a woman secretly spied upon by a teenage voyeur.[18] The following year, her portrayal of Bengali writer Sushmita Banerjee in the drama Escape from Taliban garnered her the Bengal Film Journalists' Association Award for Best Actress (Hindi).[19][20][21]\n\nKoirala's career continued to decline during mid 2000s, as she appeared in less mainstream films.[22] In 2004, she made her debut as a producer with the film Paisa Vasool,[23] which performed poorly at the box office.[24] The following year, she portrayed Mughal princess Jahan Ara in the historical drama Taj Mahal: An Eternal Love Story.[25] In 2008, Koirala starred in Rituparno Ghosh's Khela, where she played a woman in a troubled marriage.[26] Two years later, she appeared as an adulterous wife in the Malayalam drama Elektra.[27] The following year, she played a Kashmiri Muslim attempting to restore a childhood friendship in Onir's anthology film I Am (2011).[28] In 2012, she appeared in Ram Gopal Varma's horror sequel Bhoot Returns as the mother of a possessed daughter.[29] Later that year, she took a break from acting after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. After six months of treatment, Koirala recovered from the condition.[30][31] Three years later, she returned to acting with the psychological thriller Chehere: A Modern Day Classic (2015).[32]\n\nFilm[edit]\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nYear Title Role(s) Language(s) Notes Ref(s) 1989 Pheri Bhetaula Un­known Nepali [2] [33] 1991 Saudagar Radha Singh Thakur Hindi [2] [34] First Love Letter Hindi [35] 1992 Yalgaar Hindi [36] 1993 Insaaniyat Ke Devta Nisha Hindi [37] Anmol Anmol Hindi [38] Dhanwan Imli Hindi [39] 1994 Yuhi Kabhi Pooja Hindi [40] Milan Priya Hindi [41] 1942: A Love Story Hindi Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress [42] Criminal Swetha Telugu\n\nHindi [43] Sangdil Sanam Sanam Hindi [44] 1995 Criminal Swetha Hindi [43] Bombay Tamil Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress\n\nFilmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil [3] [8] Anokha Andaz Reema Hindi [45] Guddu Hindi [46] Ram Shastra Hindi [47] Akele Hum Akele Tum Hindi Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress [48] [49] Dushmani: A Violent Love Story Hindi [50] 1996 Agni Sakshi Shubhangi / Madhu[b] Hindi [51] Majhdhaar Hindi [54] Indian Aishwarya Tamil [55] [56][57] Khamoshi: The Musical Annie Hindi Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress\n\nNominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress [58]\n\n[9] 1997 Sanam Sanam Hindi [59] Gupt: The Hidden Truth Hindi [60] Dil Ke Jharokhe Mein Suman Hindi [61] Loha Cameo Hindi Special appearance [62] 1998 Yugpurush Sunita Hindi [63] Salaakhen Cameo Hindi Special appearance in song \"Pichhu Pade Hai\" [64] [65] Achanak Pooja Hindi [66] Dil Se..
