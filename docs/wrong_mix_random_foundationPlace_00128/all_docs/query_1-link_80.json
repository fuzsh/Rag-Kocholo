        "text": "Actor Manisha Koirala, who will portray the role of Mallika Jaan in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s web series, ‘Heeramandi,’ was not bothered by the multiple delays in the release of the Netflix series. In an exclusive chat with India Today, Manisha said, “As artists, we are greedy to work on good scripts. We know the value of a good role, script, and a good filmmaker.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Everything else, like impatience, is way too small compared to the joy of being a part of a beautiful project. Somewhere, we were secure because we knew that Sanjay [Leela Bhansali] would never compromise on quality,\" added Manisha.\n\nThe ‘Khamoshi’ actor was certain that no matter how much time it takes, Bhansali would never compromise on the quality of 'Heeramandi'.\n\nWATCH: MANISHA KOIRALA AS MALLIKA JAAN IN 'HEERAMANDI'\n\n\"When you know you have a committed filmmaker, how much time it takes doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter whether it takes a year or two or four because you know whenever it is out, it will be something that you are going to be proud of. I have reached a stage in my career and life where more than time, quality matters,\" Manisha opined.\n\nManisha Koirala has previously worked with Sanjay Leela Bhansali on ‘Khamoshi,’ co-starring Salman Khan.\n\nGoing forward, Manisha Koirala would like to associate herself with valuable projects. She said, “I want to work with somebody who has a lot of patience. It might take extra days and hours, but as long as the result is marvelous, I am focused on that.”\n\n'Heeramandi' marks Bhansali's debut on the streaming platforms. The series features an ensemble cast including actors Aditi Rao Hydari, Richa Chaddha, Sonakshi Sinha, Sanjeeda Shaikh, among others.\n\nThe show was announced almost two and a half years back by Netflix. After many delays, the six-episode series will release on May 1."
