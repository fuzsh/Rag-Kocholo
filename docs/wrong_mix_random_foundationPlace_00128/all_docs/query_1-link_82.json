        "text": "Manisha Koirala has been showered with praise for her most recent acting performance in Sanjay Leela Bhasali’s Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar. In Heeraandi, Manisha Koirala played the role of Mallikajaan, the chief courtesan of Shahi Mahal.\n\nHeeramandi is Manisha Koirala’s first web series. Directed and created by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Koirala starred in the lead of the Netflix India original series alongside Sonakshi Sinha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Richa Chadha, Sanjeeda Sheikh, and Sharmin Segal Mehta.\n\nRecently, Manisha Koirala had opened up about being a cancer survivor and battling the feeling of depression while shooting for Heeramandi. While she wanted to give her best performance, the actor also had to constantly fight off feeling depressed.\n\nKoirala had said, “Being impacted by cancer, I know how important your body, mind, and health are. How intertwined they are. How dependable they are. Sometimes when I'm in a deep depression… Even now sometimes I go into depression. When I was doing Heeramandi, it consumed me… My mood swings were constantly fluctuating. And I just knew, ‘Sail through this phase and once this is out, focus on your health.’”\n\nNow, in a new Instagram post, Koirala opened up about her latest career high that has come after surviving cancer and turning 50. Koirala posted pictures of her character Mallikajaan and gave two reasons for her latest success.\n\nIn the caption of the photo, she wrote, “As a 53-year-old actor who has bagged an important role in a high-profile web series, I am overjoyed that I’m not stuck playing insignificant peripheral roles, thanks to OTT platforms and changing audience profiles. Finally, female actors, technicians, and other professionals have started getting the long overdue and well-deserved good quality of work and respect in a professional environment. I am fortunate to be a part of this evolving era.”\n\nFor reason number two, she continued, “Today, when I am receiving so many accolades, I can’t help but remember the doubts and anxiety that plagued me when I was about to start shooting. Still recovering from the dreaded C, would my body be strong enough to deal with the intense shooting schedules, heavy costumes, and jewelry, and perform a role requiring so much nuance and effortless effort?”\n\nShe further wrote about the ‘fountain sequence in Heeramandi,’ calling it the most intense sequence of the entire show. The concluded her caption with words of encouragement to those who are struggling with any form of setback, physical or mental, advising them to be optimistic.\n\nYou can check out Manisha Koirala’s entire post below.\n\nMany of Manisha’s co-stars and friends commented on the post, like Mahima Chaudhry and Preity Zinta. Mahima Chaughry wrote, “Mallikajaan, the joy, thrill of watching you in Heeramandi. Wow! So, so beautiful, and so well done… I have a hangover… can’t get over you and the series. You’re outstanding! Everything about you is just wow… enjoyed your performance so, so much.”\n\nPreity Zinta also commented saying, “I love you Manisha. I saw the show for you and you killed it. You are such a powerhouse of talent and an even better human being. I will never forget how lovely, welcoming, and generous you were to me in Dil Se. Thanks to you, I started my film journey on such a positive note. You never made me feel I was working with a superstar and nurtured me on the shoot – always smiling, accommodating, and ready for rehearsal and suggestions. You will always be a hero, on and off camera. More power to you always.”\n\nMore celebrities, like Freida Pinto and Manish Malhotra, also commented on the same Instagram post by Manisha Koirala.\n\nHeeramandi, which also stars Taha Shah Badussha, Farida Jalal, Shekhar Suman, Fardeen Khan, Shruti Sharma, and Adhyayan Suman in supporting roles, has been streaming on Netflix since 1 May, 2024."
