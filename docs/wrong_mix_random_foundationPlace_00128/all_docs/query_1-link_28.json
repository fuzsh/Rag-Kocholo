Limited quantities are available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nBollywood actor Manisha Koirala is a staunch supporter of Share & Care’s Women Empowerment and Healthcare Programs and has been a compassionate champion of our cause.\n\nIn her book Healed, Manisha shares the highs and lows of her life, career, and relationships, including her battle with ovarian cancer. In conversation with Sanjoy K. Roy, Managing Director of Teamwork Arts, she speaks of the pressures of her film career, the life choices she was compelled to make, and how she redefined her priorities and regained a sense of balance and well-being. The book includes a no-holds-barred session about the emotional roller-coaster ride of Koirala’s life post-diagnosis, her learnings and inspirations, and the process of healing.\n\nKoirala made her acting debut with the Nepali film Pheri Bhetaula (1989) while studying in school. Initially aspiring to become a doctor, she had a brief stint in modeling, and went on to make her Bollywood debut with Saudagar (1991). Following a series of commercial failures, Koirala established herself as a leading actress with 1942: A Love Story (1994) and the Tamil-language Bombay (1995), subsequently starring in a series of commercial successes, including Agni Sakshi (1996), Indian (1996), Gupt: The Hidden Truth (1997), Kachche Dhaage (1999), Company (2002), and Ek Chhotisi Love Story (2002). She received critical recognition for her portrayal of the daughter of deaf-mute parents in Khamoshi: The Musical (1996), a terrorist in Dil Se.. (1998), a mistreated woman in Lajja (2001), and Sushmita Banerjee in Escape from Taliban (2003).\n\nWe invite you to attend our gala on September 21 to get your own signed copy of Koirala’s book Healed!"
