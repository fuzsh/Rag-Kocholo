        "text": "Mumbai: Actress Manisha Koirala, who was last seen onscreen in the Netflix film Lust Stories, said she is super thrilled to work with Sanjay Dutt after a decade in the remake of Telugu drama Prasthaanam.\n\nManisha Koirala was interacting with media to promote her forthcoming film Sanju on 26 June in Mumbai.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManisha and Sanjay have starred together in films like Yalgaar, Kartoos, Baaghi and others. Last they were seen together in 2008 release Mehbooba. After almost 10 years, both of them are collaborating with each other for the remake of Telugu drama Prasthaanam.\n\nSharing her feeling on the latest collaboration, Manisha said, “I am super-thrilled that I got the opportunity to work with him again. It’s his home production and the remake of a South Indian film. Original film’s director is directing Hindi version of it as well. It’s a political action-packed family drama so, I am very excited and looking forward to work in that film.”\n\nWhen asked what’s her first impression of Sanjay Dutt, she said, “I have been a fan of Sanjay Dutt. I was in school when Rocky was released and after few years, I got an opportunity to work with him&mldr; I was always in awe of him. He is somebody who is a huge star whom you see from distance and admire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Basically Baba (Sanjay Dutt) is all heart. He is a person who has heart of gold. The most endearing quality about him is that from a spot boy, light man to the director and his co-actors, he treats everyone on the set equally and he is full of love and affection.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManisha Koirala and Sanjay Dutt’s mother Nargis Dutt, both suffered from cancer. But only Manisha Koirala survived through.\n\nAlso Read: Manisha Koirala on playing Nargis Dutt in Sanju, and Lust Stories: ‘Want to do one or two meaningful films in a year’\n\nWhen asked about her role in Sanju as Nargis Dutt, Manisha Koirala said, “I was actually more apprehensive to play the character of Nargis Dutt&mldr; as I didn’t want to relive those memories&mldr; I also had no idea whether I will be able to relive that or not.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a biopic is made on her life then who will be an ideal actress from Bollywood to play her onscreen?\n\n“I don’t think any film will be made on my life, but if it’s made, I think Alia (Bhatt) or Kangana (Ranaut) should play my character onscreen.”\n\nIn Prasthaanam, Manisha will be seen as Dutt’s wife and Always Kabhi Kabhi fame Satyajeet Dubey will play the role of his son. Apart from Manisha, Sanjay and Satyajeet, the film also stars Ali Fazal and Amyra Dastur in pivotal roles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film is originally written and directed by Deva Katta who will also direct the Hindi version of the film."
