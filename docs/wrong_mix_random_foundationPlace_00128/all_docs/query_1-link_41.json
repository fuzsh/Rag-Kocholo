        "text": "Actress Manisha Koirala, who will soon be seen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Netflix series Heeramandi, took to Instagram to pen a heartfelt note. She posted a series of pictures alongside a caption about her cancer recovery, her parents and her experience working for the series.\n\n“I have a lot to be grateful for in life... a career that saw a lot of high moments, significant roles, best directors and friendships that have stood the test of time... and it is with God’s grace that I have been given a second life after battling cancer,” she wrote.\n\nThe actress, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012, underwent treatments and recovered a few years back. In the note, she revealed that she was no longer chasing the best movies or city life. Instead, she prefers spending time with her ageing parents, tending to her gardens and fur babies and indulging in spiritual practices.\n\nHowever, a call from Sanjay Leela Bhansali was an offer she could not refuse. She felt that it was worth taking a short break from her serene life and returning to the sets to reunite with the director after 28 years. Manisha starred alongside Salman Khan and Seema Biswas in Sanjay’s directorial debut Khamoshi.\n\nAppreciating the director, she wrote, “He was so talented from day one, and how he has grown as a filmmaker... but his eye for detail and larger-than-life vision retain the same rigor.” She also noted it was an enriching experience to work with her young and talented co-stars for Heeramandi.\n\nHeeramandi, which also stars Sonakshi Sinha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Richa Chadha, Sanjeeda Sheikh and Sharmin Segal in key roles, is all set to premiere on Netflix on May 1."
