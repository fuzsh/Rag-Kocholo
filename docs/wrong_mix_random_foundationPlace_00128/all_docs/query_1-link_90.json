        "text": "Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s debut web series, Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar has been generating rave reviews. Manisha Koirala, who plays the role of Mallikajaan, is being praised for her stellar performance, which has surely made it one of her most memorable works. Recently, the actress shared about her experience working on the project and the impact it had on her life as an actor. While fans can’t stop appreciating her talent, Preity Zinta, who started her career co-starring with Manisha, showered praise on her. Preity Zinta also recalled how the Heeramandi actress helped her as she shot for her first film.\n\nThe post shared by Manisha Koirala featured some stills of her in the look of Mallkajaan and a screen grab from a major scene in the series. Commenting on her post, Preity Zinta expressed. “I love you Manisha. I saw the show for you & you killed it. You are such a powerhouse of talent & an even better human being. I will never forget how lovely, welcoming & generous you were to me in Dil Se. Thanks to you I started my film journey on such a positive note. You never made me feel I was working with a superstar & nurtured me on the shoot – always smiling, accommodating & ready for rehearsal & suggestions. You will always be a Hero on & off camera. More power to you always.” Manisha Koirala and Preity Zinta worked together in the 1998 film Dil Se which also starred Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nMeanwhile, Manisha expressed the struggles she had while filming Heeramandi and how grateful she is to be a part of the show. She stated that Heeramandi has been an important milestone. Manisha added that she was pleased to no longer be trapped playing minor supporting characters, thanks to OTT platforms and shifting audience demographics. She recalled a specific scene in which she had to stay in a water fountain for over 12 hours. The actress stated, “That tested my resilience! Even though Sanjay had thoughtfully ensured that the water was warm and clean, over the hours, the water turned muddy…Every single pore in my body was soaked in that muddy water. Even though I was beyond exhaustion by the end of the shoot, I felt a deep happiness within my heart.”\n\nHeeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar started streaming on Netflix on May 1. The cast also includes Sonakshi Sinha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Richa Chadha, Sanjeeda Sheikh, Sharmin Segal, Fardeen Khan, Taha Shah, Shekhar Suman, and Adhyayan Suman."
