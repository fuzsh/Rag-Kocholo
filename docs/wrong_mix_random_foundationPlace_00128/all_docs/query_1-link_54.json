        "text": "Manisha Koirala was one of the most sought-after actresses in Bollywood in the 90s. She made hearts flutter with her notable performances. After debuting in Bollywood, she had three movies that didn’t do well. Critics also said she looked like Madhuri Dixit. But despite all this, Manisha Koirala appeared in super hit movies. She cemented her place in the industry, and the rest is history. She is not much active in film at present, but can be seen making appearances in chosen projects. Recently, her childhood photos made a huge noise on the internet. In one of the pictures, Manisha Koirala is seen posing alongside her mother. In another photo, she poses in a school uniform. Baby Manisha Koirala looked adorable, to say the least. Her childhood photos are now doing the rounds on social media.\n\nIn 1994, Manisha Koirala landed a significant role alongside Anil Kapoor in the film 1942: A Love Story, which proved to be a pivotal moment in her career. The movie achieved substantial commercial success, particularly remembered for its popular song Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. She has delivered a string of hits, including the Tamil film Bombay in 1995. Some of her other notable films during this period include Agni Sakshi in 1996, Indian in 1996, Gupt: The Hidden Truth in 1997, Kachche Dhaage in 1999, Mudhalvan in 1999, Company in 2002, and Ek Chhotisi Love Story in 2002.\n\nAfter receiving praise for her roles in films like Akele Hum Akele Tum, Khamoshi: The Musical, and Lajja, she took a break from acting in 2012 due to a cancer diagnosis. She fought against cancer and returned to acting after five years with the coming-of-age drama Dear Maya in 2017. She also appeared in Netflix’s Lust Stories in 2018. Making a significant comeback to the big screen, she starred in one of the highest-grossing films of 2018, Sanju, a biographical movie where she portrayed the role of Sanjay Dutt’s mother, Nargis Dutt.\n\nManisha Koirala has delivered many noteworthy performances throughout her career, earning multiple Best Actress awards. Besides acting, she actively engages in social work, notably collaborating with organisations dedicated to advocating for women’s rights, preventing violence against women, and combating the trafficking of Nepali girls for prostitution.\n\nShe was last seen in Shehzada. Soon, she is going to star in a slew of upcoming projects such as Emergency, Freedom, and Heera Mandi: The Diamond Bazaar."
