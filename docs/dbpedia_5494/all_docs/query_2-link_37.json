        "text": "Actress Jane Fonda will be the recipient of the 2021 Cecil B. DeMille Award at this year's Golden Globe Awards.\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced Tuesday that Fonda, 83, would be the recipient of its award, named for film pioneer DeMille and given annually to a \"talented individual who has made a lasting impact on the film industry.\"\n\n“For more than five decades, Jane’s breadth of work has been anchored in her unrelenting activism, using her platform to address some of the most important social issues of our time,\" said HFPA President Ali Sar in a statement. \"Her undeniable talent has gained her the highest level of recognition, and while her professional life has taken many turns, her unwavering commitment to evoking change has remained.\"\n\nThe Golden Globes will air live Feb. 28 from 8-11 p.m. ET on NBC. Past recipients of the award include Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Barbra Streisand, Denzel Washington, Martin Scorsese and Audrey Hepburn.\n\nA member of one of America’s most distinguished acting families, Fonda has captivated and inspired fans along with critics in such films as “Klute” and “Coming Home.”\n\nFonda, the daughter of Oscar winner Henry Fonda and sister of Peter Fonda, made an impact off-screen by creating organizations to support women’s equality and prevent teen pregnancy and improve adolescent health. She released a workout video in 1982 and was active on behalf of liberal political causes.\n\nShe has been nominated for five Academy Awards and won two for the thriller “Klute” and the compassionate anti-war drama “Coming Home.” She had other prominent films including “The China Syndrome,” “The Electric Horseman” with Robert Redford, and “9 to 5” with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. She stars in the Netflix television series “Grace & Frankie.”\n\nFonda gained notoriety in the the 1970s when she traveled to North Vietnam during the height of the anti-Vietnam War protests and posed for photos next to an anti-aircraft gun. She fell under hefty criticism for her decision — one she repeatedly apologized for — to pose in the photo that gave her the nickname “Hanoi Jane.”\n\nIn 2014, Fonda was given a lifetime achievement award by the American Film Institute. She launched IndieCollect’s Jane Fonda Fund for Women Directors, an organization aimed to support the restoration of films helmed by women from around the world.\n\nMore: Jane Fonda rings in 82nd birthday with 5th arrest at climate change protest\n\nFonda was arrested at the U.S. Capitol while peacefully protesting climate change in 2019, an action dubbed Fire Drill Fridays.\n\nFor her 80th birthday, Fonda raised $1 million for each her nonprofits, the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential and the Women’s Media Center. She also serves on the board of directors and made $1 million donation to Donor Direct Action, an organization that supports front-line women’s organizations to promote women’s equality.\n\nFonda’s book, “What Can I Do? My Path from Climate Despair to Action,” released last year, details her personal journey with Fire Drill Fridays.\n\nContributing: Associated Press"
