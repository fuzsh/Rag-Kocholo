        "text": "Ancient History in the Movies | Medieval Movies | Modern History in the Movies\n\nCourse: Myth, Epic Romance: Medieval History in Film (archived version)\n\nInternet Medieval Sourcebook\n\nMedieval History in the Movies\n\nVersion 6.1 [2023]\n\nCompiler: Paul Halsall\n\n(Archived older version of this page here)\n\nThis updated list now includes films up until c. 2023.\n\nWhat follows is a list of dramatic movies on medieval themes compiled with the help of Wikipedia, Microsoft's Cinemania, The Internet Movie Database [The IMdb is a splendid resource: consult it for more detailed information (complete cast, crew and technical information), plot summaries, and links to reviews for many of the films below], and various contributors to the Mediev-l discussion list, and with the help in 2023 of the members of various Facebook discussion groups.\n\nThis list is comprehensive but not exhaustive. Some films occur more than once under different subject headings. Under each subsection heading films are organised in the rough chronological order of the period they cover, not the year they were made. They are arranged thematically following the general plan of the Internet Medieval Sourcebook. \"Medieval\" has been taken very widely - from the first-century (CE) Roman Empire until the 17th-century - that is so that it might fit in with the kinds of history survey courses that begin with the rise of Christianity and end in 1648. As of 24 May 2023 there are c 454 separate items on this list. Some of them are listed under several sub headings.\n\nAlthough \"medieval\" and \"movies\" might not seem to be a good fit -- and a lot of bad films have been made -- it is perhaps worth noting that they have gone together since the earliest surviving American feature film - AndrÃ© Calmettes and James Keane Richard III of 1912.\n\nMy essay Thinking about Historical Film (PDF) or here (HTML) may be of interest for readers of this web page.\n\nMy old course outline Myth, Epic and Romance: Medival History in the Movies may also be of interest\n\nThe following data, when available, are given for each film [Title] [Alternative title] [Year] [Country of Production] [Genre] [Duration in minutes] [MPAA Rating if available] [Color?] [Lang] [Director] [Cast] -[Comments]\n\nContents\n\nPagan Late Antiquity\n\nChristian Late Antiquity\n\nBarbarian/German Impact\n\nByzantium\n\nByzantine Commonwealth - Rus' and Russia\n\nByzantine Commonwealth - Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria\n\nIslam\n\nThe Celtic World\n\nVikings/Nordic\n\nFeudalism/Knighthood\n\nLaw\n\nCrusades\n\nMedieval European Literature on Film\n\nEngland\n\nEngland - Arthuriana\n\nEngland - Robin Hood\n\nScotland\n\nFrance\n\nFrance - Joan of Arc\n\nSpain and Portugal\n\nItaly\n\nEastern Europe\n\nScholars and Scholasticism\n\nHeresy and Mendicancy\n\nUrban/Rural Life\n\nChristian Spirituality\n\nMedieval Women\n\nHomosexual/LGBT/Transgendered Characters\n\nRenaissance\n\nReformation/Catholic Reformation\n\nExpansion Overseas\n\nMongols\n\nMedieval China, Japan, India\n\nMedieval Fantasy\n\nModern Periods/ Medieval Themes\n\nDocumentary Series\n\nLists\n\nA: Worst Medieval Movies -by readers of Mediev-l list\n\nB: Best Medieval Movies - for accuracy\n\nC: Best Medieval Movies - as films\n\nD: Medieval Movie Misconceptions (also known as \"myths\")\n\nFurther Reading on Medieval History and Film\n\nSee the separate file on History of Sainthood in the Movies (2006) [Was at UNF, now Internet Archive]\n\nNotes\n\nBy \"clicking\" on the title of the movie, you will be taken to the Internet Movie Database record on that movie. As of 2023 there is also a link to the Wikipedia page for each item.\n\nFilms are in English unless otherwise noted.\n\nAt some time in the future, I expect, it will be possible to link list like this to the actual films, which will be immediately (for a fee) playable on your computer/TV/digital appliance. In 1970, c.26 years before I compiled the initial list it was extremely difficult to see old films, unless there was a repetory cinema showing a season or a film club. Even when you could see old films, it was not possible to exactly specify a time in the film because the copies that were circulated from film libraries would all be slightly different - it was a usual requirement for a projectionist to be able to repair and glue film together when filmstrips broke. By 1996 VHS meant that some in cities with cinephile/cinÃ©aste subcultures there were libraries and commercial outlets where you could access thousands of tapes. The quality of those tapes was often awful. And I suspect there were fairly few cities which such opportunities. As of 2023, witha few online subscriptions, and access to YouTube, it is possible to access far more films than in 1996, but there are still some barriers.\n\nOther Lists like this\n\nWikipedia: List of historical films set in Near Eastern and Western civilization\n\nWikipedia: List of historical films set in Asia\n\nIMDb: List of movies concerning history and literature of the Middle ages through Elizabethian times (500-1600AD)\n\nPagan Late Antiquity\n\nBarbarians [Alt Barbaren] (2020) [Wikipedia]\n\nGermany: Historical drama, Color. 2 Seasons, 12 episodes\n\nDir.

Kevin Macdonald; Cast includes Channing Tatum, Jamie Bell\n\n-Set in the the 2nd century AD, and based on Rosemary Sutcliffe's novel The Eagle of the Ninth. Critics were not impressed by I thought it was very enjoyable.\n\nFellini Satyricon (1969) [Wikipedia]\n\nItaly, Historical, 129, Rated R, Color\n\nDir. Federico Fellini; Cast includes\" Martin Potter (Encolpio)\n\n-Not exactly a filming of Petronius Arbiter's novel. The tag ran \"Rome. Before Christ. After Fellini\". Potter is Encolpio a beautiful youth, whose young lover and slave, Gitone, has been stolen from him and sold to an older man. He vows to get him back.\n\nThe Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) [Wikipedia]\n\nUS, Historical, 153, No rating, Color\n\nDir. Anthony Mann; Cast includes: Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Alec Guinness (Marcus Aurelius), James Mason, Christopher Plummer (Commodus), Anthony Quayle\n\n-By no means as bad as it might have been. The later film Gladiator (2000) is in some sense a remake.\n\nThe Viking Queen (1967) [Wikipedia]\n\nUK, Historical/Adventure, 91, No rating, Color\n\nDir. Don Chaffey; Cast includes Don Murry\n\n-Despite its title, this film is about a Boudica-like character during the Roman occupation of Britain. The first few minutes are so historically inaccurate that this is a real classic of bad Hollywood history.\n\n-Leonard Maltin summarizes it as \"Empty-headed costumer of early England under Roman rule, with plenty of gore as anarchists incite a violent uprising among the people.\" \"England\"! Rome! Viking Queens! Ouch.\"\n\nRevenge of the Gladiators (1965) [aka La Vendetta di Spartacus] [Wikipedia]\n\nItaly, Historical/Adventure, 100, No rating, Color\n\nDir. Michel Lupo\n\n-The Western Roman Empire in the 450s AD. The city of Rome itself is besieged by the Vandals.\n\nGladiator (2000) [Wikipedia]\n\nUS, 154, Action, Color\n\nDir. Ridley Scott; Cast includes Russell Crowe.\n\nA movie which may represent the rebirth of the sandals and sand epic. It was widely praised in the press but panned by ancient historians (with the Harvard faculty member who was listed as \"historical\" consultant sending out a mass apologia to colleagues). Ridley Scott made full use of modern technology to create a \"real\" ancient Rome, but the result looks more like the French Second Empire. The arena sequences are OK, but do not match those with Charlton Heston in Ben Hur.\n\nSheba and the Gladiator (1959) [Wikipedia]\n\nItaly, Historical, 98, No rating, Color\n\nDir. Guido Brignone and Michelangelo Antonioni; Cast includes: Anita Ekberg\n\n-A gladiator captured by the Queen of Palmyra and the re-annexation of Palmyra by Rome in the 3rd century AD.\n\nThe Last Legion (2007) [Wikipedia]\n\nUS, Historical action, 102, Color\n\nDir.

Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar: Cast includes Rachel Weisz, Max Minghella, Oscar Isaac\n\n-Set in the late 4th century Alexandria and focused on the Phillosopher Hypatia and her Christian opponents. It recieved a lot of criticism but as far as this list goes it is among the most interesting efforts at a historical film\n\nBack to Index\n\nChristian Late Antiquity\n\nPonzio Pilato (1962) [Wikipedia]\n\nFrance/Italy, drama/religious, 100 1962 Color, In Italian\n\nDir.

William Wyler: Cast includes: Charleton Heston, Stephen Boyd\n\n-Based on Lew Wallace's book. The story of Judah Ben-Hur and his boyhood friend Messala. Ben Hur is a love story between two men: Heston was not let into the secret (he has made a career of unacknowledged homoeroticism -- see The Agony and the Ecstasy or Planet of the Apes], but Boyd knew what role he was to play. The Arena sequences are among the best put on film.\n\nQuo Vadis? (1951) [Wikipedia]\n\nUS, Historical, 171, No rating, Color\n\nDir. Mervyn LeRoy; Cast includes: Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr, Peter Ustinov\n\n-Story of St. Peter.

Henry Koster; Cast includes: Richard Burton, Victor Mature, Jean Simmons\n\n-Based on Lloyd C. Douglas' novel about Roman centurion who presides over Christ's crucifixion. The first movie in CinemaScope.\n\nDemetrius and the Gladiators (1954) [Wikipedia]\n\nUS, Religious, 101, No rating, Color\n\nDir. Delmer Davies: Cast includes: Victor Mature, Susan Hayward\n\n-Sequel to the Robe. Caligula looks for it now.\n\nThe Sign of the Cross (1932) [Wikipedia]\n\nUS, Historical, 118, No rating B&W\n\nDir. Cecil B. DeMiller: Cast includes: Fredric March, Claudette Colbert (Empress Poppaea), Charles Laughton (Emperor Nero)\n\nNero burns Rome. This was made before the Hayes code, and represents an high point id De Mille's skill of getting in as much sin as possible under a pious justification. Laughton as Nero is every bit as decadent as one could hope, but the last third of the movie is spectacular. Frederic March tries to \"warm up\" the Christian girl (Landi) he is pursuing by taking her to an orgy where she is caressed by a half-dressed lesbian -- in the background, martyrs sing on their way to the arena. The arena scenes are massively violent and erotic -- with naked women being attacked by crocodiles, and, at one point, an Amazon spearing a pygmy and lifting the still wriggling guy up in the air. The movie was cut to shreds after the Hays code, and it is important to get hold of the uncut version.\n\nAndrocles and the Lion (1952) [Wikipedia]\n\nUS, Comedy, 98, No rating, B&W\n\nDir. Chester Erskine; Cast includes: Jean Simmons, Alan Young, Victor Mature\n\n-Based on GB Shaw play.\n\n-There was also a TV version in 1965 with Norman Wisdom and Noel Coward.\n\nSebastiane (1976) [Wikipedia]\n\nUK, religious, 82, Color, In Latin\n\nDir. Derek Jarman\n\n-[PBH Comment] Story of the early Christian martyr St. Sebastian set as a homoerotic fantasy around 303 CE.. Mostly filmed with all characters naked, and the dialogue is all in Latin. Jarman explicitly exploits the image of Sebastian as a gay icon, and although set in late antiquity is not a historical film in any useful way. It is interesting to see Latin used as a daily language, and for gay classicists the movie will have an especial appeal. It would be difficult in most institutions to show this to any other class than a history of sexuality class.\n\nFabiola (1917) [Wikipedia]\n\nItaly, 85, B&W\n\nDir. Enrico Guzzanoi\n\nFabiola (1949) [Alt: Fabiola and The Fighting Gladiator / Fabulous Fabiola] [Wikipedia]\n\nFrance-Italy, Historical, 96, No rating B&W\n\nDir.

Based on a 19th century novel by Felix Dahn it presents the struggle of the daughters of the Gothic king Theodoric for power after his death. and then the conquest of their kingdom in Italy by the Byzantine general Belisarius.

When the list began it included some of Shakespeare's history plays that had been filmed, but no effort was made to include all of them. It is worth considering a point made by Robert Tombs in The English and Their History: The First Thirteen Centuries (2014).\n\n\"When subsequent generations have envisaged England in the later Middle Ages, Shakespeare’s characters and language have shaped their visionâfrom the audiences of 2,000 or 3,000 in his own theatres to the many millions who have seen film and television productions, or studied the plays at school and university. No other country has had a slice of its past so dramatized, or exposed to such a large audienceâexcept perhaps the United States through the Hollywood Western.\"\n\nIf you take Tombs' point seriously, then Shakespeare's history plays are indeed plays about the Middle Ages, and should be so considered.
