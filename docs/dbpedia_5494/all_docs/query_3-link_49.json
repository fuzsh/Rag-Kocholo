        "text": "Jane Fonda cemented herself into Hollywood allure as a chameleonlike actor and social activist, and now the Golden Globes will honour her illustrious career with its highest honour.\n\nFonda will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award during the 78th annual awards ceremony on Feb. 28, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced Tuesday. A member of one of America's most distinguished acting families, Fonda has captivated and inspired fans along with critics in such films as Klute and Coming Home.\n\nFonda, the daughter of Oscar winner Henry Fonda and sister of Peter Fonda, made an impact off-screen by creating organizations to support women's equality and prevent teen pregnancy and improve adolescent health. She released a workout video in 1982 and was active on behalf of liberal political causes.\n\nIn a statement, HFPA President Ali Sar applauded the Golden Globe winner's decorated career and her \"unrelenting activism.\"\n\n\"Her undeniable talent has gained her the highest level of recognition,\" Sar said of Fonda. \"While her professional life has taken many turns, her unwavering commitment to evoking change has remained.\"\n\nThe DeMille Award is given annually to an \"individual who has made an incredible impact on the world of entertainment.\"\n\nPast recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Meryl Streep, Barbra Streisand, Sidney Poitier and Lucille Ball.\n\nNominations for the upcoming Globes show are scheduled to be announced Feb. 3.\n\nFonda, 83, has been nominated for five Academy Awards and won two for the thriller Klute and the compassionate anti-war drama Coming Home. She had other prominent films including The China Syndrome, The Electric Horseman with Robert Redford, and 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. She stars in the Netflix television series Grace & Frankie.\n\nFonda gained notoriety in the the 1970s when she traveled to North Vietnam during the height of the anti-Vietnam War protests and posed for photos next to an anti-aircraft gun. She fell under hefty criticism for her decision — one she repeatedly apologized for — to pose in the photo that gave her the nickname \"Hanoi Jane.\"\n\nIn 2014, Fonda was given a lifetime achievement award by the American Film Institute. She launched IndieCollect's Jane Fonda Fund for Women Directors, an organization aimed to support the restoration of films helmed by women from around the world.\n\nFonda was arrested at the U.S. Capitol while peacefully protesting climate change in 2019, an action dubbed Fire Drill Fridays.\n\nFor her 80th birthday, Fonda raised $1 million US for each of her nonprofits, the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential and the Women's Media Center. She also serves on the board of directors and made $1 million US donation to Donor Direct Action, an organization that supports front-line women's organizations to promote women's equality."
