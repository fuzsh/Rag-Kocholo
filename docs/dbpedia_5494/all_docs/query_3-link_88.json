        "text": "At the Golden Globes sunday. Tributes:\n\nLucas: \"Steven, I've always said you're a filmmaking genius, and for decades audiences around the world have agreed. Now that you're included in the company of Cecil B. DeMille, I guess it's official. Congratulations on this great honor. It's richly deserved.\"\n\nFord: \"It was a real pleasure to work with Steven again after all the years, after all the mileage. A 'showman,' yes, he is. But he is distinguished by a rare and noble heart, a spirit, which shapes his life ? and his films. Nobody knows more about how to make movies work. And he is a generous and inspiring boss. I loved going to work every day.\"\n\nShia: \"To be around Steven Spielberg is to be in the company of an immortal. He is a genius. Some men see things as they are and ask 'Why?' Steven will dream of things that have never existed and ask 'Why not?' To know him is a gift.\"\n\nDo they think of those lines themselves or do they have ...people to do that job?\n\nI'm not sure yet if I'll really tune in tonight. I haven't seen one nominated movie. And it's a traditionally frustrating mix of the usual suspects and snubs in the tv-category. Also the sight of the yearly anorexic and semi-nude Miss Golden Globe actor spawn always gives me the creeps.\n\nThe potential of Hugh Laurie's sheer sight on stage* and the Spielberg appearance (and anything Wrestler-related) are teasing me.\n\n(I'll only endure that bacchanal with my own dose of alcohol and entertaining live blogging, though.)\n\n*I just realized that he won last year and the year before that. I guess he won't be on stage tonight.\n\ntorao said:\n\nDo they think of those lines themselves or do they have ...people to do that job?\n\n\"Some men see things as they are and ask 'Why?' Steven will dream of things that have never existed and ask 'Why not?'\"\n\n- Shia LaBeouf​\n\n\"Some men dream things that are and ask why. I dream things that aren't and ask why not.\"\n\n- John F. Kennedy​\n\nScrew Barack - Shia for President!\n\nWhat a great tribute that was! I really liked the movie montage reel they had, but I would have preferred to see all his films done chronologically instead of skipping over some and condensing others(The Adventures of Indiana Jones). I know it was for the sake of time, but it's Steven Spielberg after all, and an extra minute or two would have been worth it in my opinion. It was very cool to see Scorsese deliver the award and not Lucas for a change, especially considering how much of an impact he has had on the history of cinema.\n\nThe Man said:\n\nMarty is the greatest filmic speaker out there...\n\nI don't like to throw the word around lightly like some do, but Scorsese is a genius! The man's knowledge of film history alone is incredibly impressive! I don't know if you've ever seen the documnetary Scorsese on Scorsese, but it gives a great window into both his life and his contributions to the history of cinema!\n\ntorao said:\n\nSpielberg tends to be a great storyteller with and without his Camera.\n\nThis speech was no exception. I felt especially strong about what he said on being a mentor, inspiration and the \"audience of individuals\".\n\nHe's one of the good guys.\n\nThat's true, he definitely seems like a good person! I've always got the impression from him that he's a nice guy, unlike a lot of Hollywood megastars that are really nasty and cutthroat! There's a genuine quality to Spielberg that is very endearing. I don't know if you had the same perception, but when he was up there talking about his train set, it was like he was a little kid in a grown ups body. I think that's one of the biggest reasons his films have touched so many people, he's never lost touch of what's it like to be a kid, even if we all do at some point or another.\n\nFor a second I thought the montage reel would end with Munich, and no Indy there ... but there it was, condensed, as the last one between his movies as director.\n\nGreat body of work when you can see it all together in a couple of minutes! Great speech, so far away from the hollywood business.\n\nAnd nice too to know he said he is keen to revisit Indiana Jones character without being directly asked about it.\n\nI'm surprised no debate has been made that a clip from KOTCS was used, while no clip from TOD was used, indicating KOTCS is the better Indiana Jones movie.\n\nIn all seriousness, thanks The Man for those clips. Both Scorsese and Spielberg gave great speeches. The tribute was great too. I know a lot of film elites hate Spielberg because he is too mainstream with an alleged lack of style in his films, watching that clip was a great reminder of his many great works(even beyond those of that he directed such as Back To The Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit ) and great influence to the industry.\n\nReally, there are few people still living who deserve this award as much as he does."
