        "text": "Silent film homage The Artist leads the field at the 2012 Golden Globes, scoring six nominations in all.\n\nThe film, out in the UK on 30 December, is up for best musical and comedy and gets additional nods for its stars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo.\n\nKenneth Branagh, Tilda Swinton and Kate Winslet are among the British actors up for honours.\n\nThe annual gala, which takes place on 15 January, is the first major event of the Hollywood awards season.\n\nRicky Gervais is returning to host this year's event, having acted as master of ceremonies in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe Office and Extras star caused controversy earlier this year with his sharp-tongued presenting style.\n\nHot on the heels of The Artist comes 1960s drama The Help and George Clooney film The Descendants, up for five prizes apiece.\n\nBoth are up for best film drama, alongside Martin Scorsese's Hugo, Moneyball, Steven Spielberg's War Horse and Clooney's other 2011 release, The Ides of March.\n\nIn the best comedy or musical category, The Artist faces competition from 50/50, Bridesmaids, Midnight in Paris and My Week with Marilyn.\n\nIt is for the latter that Branagh gets a best supporting actor nod, for playing Laurence Olivier opposite Michelle Williams' Marilyn Monroe.\n\nWilliams is up for best comedy actress, as is Winslet for the Roman Polanski film Carnage - an honour she shares with her co-star Jodie Foster.\n\nSwinton - cited for her role in We Need to Talk About Kevin - features in the best dramatic actress category, as does Oscar favourite Meryl Streep for The Iron Lady. Glenn Close, Viola Davis and Rooney Mara - for the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - complete the shortlist.\n\nClooney is up for best dramatic actor for The Descendants, where his competition includes Shame's Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt for Moneyball and Leonardo DiCaprio for J Edgar.\n\nRyan Gosling, also included here for The Ides of March, gets a second best actor nod for the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love.\n\nOther nominees for the best actor in a comedy or musical prize include Dujardin and Ireland's Brendan Gleeson, cited for his role in The Guard.\n\nIn the best animated film category, meanwhile, Bristol-based studio Aardman is shortlisted for their festive hit Arthur Christmas. Rivals to the prize include Cars 2 and The Adventures of Tintin.\n\nGlitzy and irreverent\n\nBoth films and TV shows are recognised by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organisers of the glitzy and often irreverent Los Angeles ceremony.\n\nIn both camps, awards are divided between dramas and comedies, with additional prizes thrown in for mini-series or motion pictures made for television.\n\nIn the television side of the nominations, ITV's Downton Abbey and HBO's Mildred Pierce lead the way with four nods each.\n\nWinslet gets a second citation for her eponymous role in the latter, while Hugh Bonneville is recognised in the best actor in a mini-series category for Downtown Abbey.\n\nBritish talent features prominently in Bonneville's field, which also sees nominations for Bill Nighy, Dominic West and Idris Elba.\n\nJeremy Irons, Damian Lewis, Romola Garai and Emily Watson are among the other British stars to be cited for their small-screen work."
