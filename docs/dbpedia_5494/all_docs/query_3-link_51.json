        "text": "Meryl Streep will be presented with the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 74th Annual Golden Globe Awards, which will be hosted by Jimmy Fallon January 8, 2017. The 2017 Golden Globe Awards will air live coast-to-coast on NBC beginning at 8 PM ET from the Beverly Hilton Hotel.\n\nStage and screen star Streep is the recipient of eight Golden Globes and 29 nominations.\n\nLorenzo Soria, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), said in a statement, ”It’s no surprise that the HFPA has chosen Meryl Streep as the recipient of the 2017 Cecil B. DeMille Award. Meryl’s enthralling body of work across a diverse set of genres has made her a role model over the past 40 years, and she will continue to do so for generations to come. She has always taken roles with strong female leads, creating art by showing vulnerability and portraying truth on the big screen. Simply put, she is a trailblazer, having paved the way for women in television, film and stage. For shattering gender and age barriers, all with finesse and grace, the HFPA is humbled to bestow this honor upon her.”"
