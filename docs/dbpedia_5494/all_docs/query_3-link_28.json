        "text": "The Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award named after its first recipient and renowned director and father of American cinema Cecil B. DeMille, has been a fixture at the Golden Globes ceremonies ever since its first appearance at the 9th Golden Globe Awards in 1951. So, viewers have been curious about its surprising absence at the 2024 Golden Globe Awards ceremony. Here is everything you need to know.\n\nWhy was there no Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes 2024?\n\nThe Cecil B. DeMille Award was absent at the Golden Globes 2024 event due to time constraints as per the official preview of the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nHowever, the Cecil B. DeMille Award was not the only award category to be absent from the 2024 Golden Globes event as the Carol Burnett Award first introduced in 2019 was also absent this year. Both of these awards were scrapped owing to time constraints and also because two new categories were added:\n\nCinematic and Box Office Excellence\n\nBest Performance by a Stand-Up Comic\n\nThe last five recipients of the Cecil B. DeMille Award were:\n\nEddie Murphy (2023)\n\nJane Fonda (2021)\n\nTom Hanks (2020)\n\nJeff Bridges (2019)\n\nOprah Winfrey (2018)\n\nThe Cecil B. DeMille Award was presented at every Golden Globes Award ceremony except for the ceremonies in 1976, 2008, and 2022.\n\nWill the Cecil B. DeMille Award return in 2025?\n\nThe Cecil B. DeMille Award will likely return in 2025.\n\nThis is because the Golden Globes themselves stated in their preview of the 2024 event that the absence of the award was only temporary and that there was a chance of it being given in the future.\n\nIn entertainment elsewhere, James Gunn offers an update on Peacemaker Season 2’s pre-production. Also, here are the first look images of CBS’ Ghosts Season 3."
