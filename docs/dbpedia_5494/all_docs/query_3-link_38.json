        "text": "Tom Hanks will be honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award at next year’s Golden Globe Awards ceremony, USA Today reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Cecil B. DeMille Award is given each year to a “talented individual who has made a lasting impact on the film industry,” according to USA Today.\n\n“For more than three decades, he’s captivated audiences with rich and playful characters that we’ve grown to love and admire,” President Lorenzo Soria of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association said in a statement, according to CNN. “As compelling as he is on the silver screen, he’s equally so behind the camera as a writer, producer and director.”\n\nHanks has starred in more than 80 films over the course of his career, according to NBC News, and won back-to-back Oscars and Golden Globes for his work in the films “Philadelphia” and “Forrest Gump” — only one of two actors in Oscars history to do so, CNN reports.\n\nThere is already buzz about more awards nominations for the actor, for his role in the upcoming film “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” (a biopic about Mister Rogers), according to CNN."
