        "text": "Oscar and Golden Globe-winning actor Denzel Washington is slated to receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 2016 Golden Globes, the Hollywood Foreign Press announced Monday.\n\n“Washington’s long and storied career is earmarked by his countless roles in front and behind the camera. It is the HFPA’s privilege to honor his contributions to the entertainment industry with the Cecil B. DeMille Award,” said Lorenzo Soria, president of the association.\n\nWashington has been nominated by the HFPA seven times, winning twice; Best Supporting Actor for Glory, for which he also took home the Oscar and The Hurricane, for which he was Oscar-nominated. Recent previous recipients of the award have included George Clooney (last year) and Jodie Foster, who gave a famously oddball pseudo coming out speech on stage.\n\nThe 73rd Annual Golden Globe Awards will be held on January 10th, 2016 and hosted for the third time by Ricky Gervais."
