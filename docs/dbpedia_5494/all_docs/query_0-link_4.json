Jimmy Fallon hosted the show.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn 1943, a group of writers banded together to form the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and by creating a generously distributed award called the Golden Globe Award, they now play a significant role in film marketing.[2] The 1st Golden Globe Awards, honoring the best achievements in 1943 filmmaking, was held in January 1944, at the 20th Century-Fox studios. Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including the Beverly Hills Hotel, and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.[3]\n\nIn 1950, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association made the decision to establish a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry. Recognizing its subject as an international figure within the entertainment industry, the first award was presented to director and producer, Cecil B. DeMille. The official name of the award thus became the Cecil B. DeMille Award.[4]\n\nIn 1963, the Miss Golden Globe concept was introduced. In its inaugural year, two Miss Golden Globes were named, one for film and one for television. The two Miss Golden Globes named that year were Eva Six (of the films Operation Bikini and Beach Party) and Donna Douglas (of television's The Beverly Hillbillies), respectively.[5]\n\nIn 2009, the Golden Globe statuette was redesigned (but not for the first time in its history). The New York firm Society Awards collaborated for a year with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to produce a statuette that included a unique marble and enhanced the statuette’s quality and gold content. It was unveiled at a press conference at the Beverly Hilton prior to the show.[6]\n\nRevenues generated from the annual ceremony have enabled the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to donate millions of dollars to entertainment-related charities, as well as funding scholarships and other programs for future film and television professionals. The most prominent beneficiary being the Young Artist Awards, presented annually by the Young Artist Foundation, established in 1978 by late Hollywood Foreign Press member, Maureen Dragone to recognize and award excellence of young Hollywood performers under the age of 21, and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically and/or financially challenged.[7][8][9]\n\nCeremony[]\n\nThe broadcast of the Golden Globe Awards, telecast to 167 countries worldwide, generally ranks as the third most-watched awards show each year, behind only the Oscars and the Grammy Awards. Until Ricky Gervais hosted the 67th annual Golden Globe Awards Ceremony in 2010, the award ceremony was one of two major Hollywood award ceremonies (the other being the Screen Actors Guild Awards) that did not have a regular host; every year a different presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast. Gervais returned to host the 68th and 69th Golden Globe Awards the next two years.[10] Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted the 70th, 71st and 72nd Golden Globe Awards in 2015. The Golden Globe Awards' theme song, which debuted in 2012, was written by Japanese musician and songwriter Yoshiki Hayashi.[citation needed]\n\n2008 disruption[]\n\nOn January 7, 2008, it was announced that due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, the 65th Golden Globe Awards would not be telecast live. The ceremony was faced with a threat by striking writers to picket the event and by actors threatening to boycott the ceremony rather than cross picket lines. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association was forced to adopt another approach for the broadcast.[citation needed]\n\nNBC originally had exclusive broadcast rights to the ceremonies, but on January 11, HFPA President Jorge Camara announced there would be no restrictions placed on media outlets covering the January 13 press conference, announcing the winners at 6:00pm PST.[11] As a result, E!, CNN, the TV Guide Network and KNBC-TV, the network's Los Angeles owned-and-operated affiliate, aired the 31-minute event, emanating from the Grand Ballroom of the Beverly Hilton Hotel live, leaving NBC to fill the hour from 9:00–10:00pm ET with announcements, made after-the-fact by Access Hollywood hosts Billy Bush and Nancy O'Dell.[12] The remaining hours of programming, set aside for the ceremonies by the network, were filled with a special two-hour edition of Dateline, hosted by Matt Lauer, that included film clips, interviews with some of the nominees and commentary from comedian Kathy Griffin and the panelists from Football Night in America.[citation needed]\n\nCategories[]\n\nMotion picture awards[]\n\nBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\nBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nBest Director\n\nBest Actor – Motion Picture Drama\n\nBest Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\n\nBest Actress – Motion Picture Drama\n\nBest Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\n\nBest Supporting Actor – Motion Picture\n\nBest Supporting Actress – Motion Picture\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nBest Original Score\n\nBest Original Song\n\nBest Foreign Language Film\n\nBest Animated Feature Film (since 2006)\n\nCecil B.

However, including honorary awards, such as the Henrietta Award, World Film Favorite Actor/Actress Award, or Cecil B. DeMille Award, Barbra Streisand tied this record with nine. Additionally, Streisand won for composing the song Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born), producing the Best Picture (Comedy/Musical) (A Star Is Born in the ceremony held in 1977), and directing Yentl in 1984. Jack Nicholson, Angela Lansbury, Alan Alda and Shirley MacLaine have six awards each. Behind them are Ed Asner, Rosalind Russell and Jessica Lange with five wins. Meryl Streep also holds the record for most nominations with thirty (as of the 2016 nominations) and John Williams is second with twenty-five.

However, in 1968, the Federal Communications Commission claimed the show “misled the public as to how the winners were determined” (allegations included that winners were determined by lobby; to motivate winners to show up to the awards ceremony winners were informed if they did not attend another winner would be named). The FCC admonished NBC for participating in the scandal. Subsequently, NBC refused to broadcast the ceremony from 1968 until after 1974.[16][17]\n\nPia Zadora awarded “New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture” in 1982[]\n\nIn 1982, Pia Zadora won a Golden Globe in the category \"New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture – Female\" for her performance in Butterfly, over such competition as Elizabeth McGovern (Ragtime) and Kathleen Turner (Body Heat).[18] Accusations were made that the Foreign Press Association members had been bought off.[19] Zadora's husband, multimillionaire Meshulam Riklis, flew voting members to his casino, the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, which gave the appearance that they voted for Zadora to repay this. Riklis also invited voting members to his house for a lavish lunch and a showing of the film. He also spent a great deal on advertising.[20] Furthermore, Zadora had made her film debut some 17 years earlier as a child performer in Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.[21]\n\nThe Tourist for Best Musical/Comedy nominations in 2011[]\n\nThe nominations for the 2011 Globes drew initial skepticism, as the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated The Tourist in its Best Musical/Comedy category, although it was originally advertised as a spy thriller, and also one of the most panned films of the season with host Ricky Gervais even joking to main star of the film Johnny Depp if he had seen the movie.
