        "text": "Denzel Washington already has a place in Hollywood history, but at the next Golden Globe Awards, he'll get the statue to prove it. The veteran actor has been named the 2016 recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award, given to those who have “made an incredible impact on the world of entertainment.” He will receive his honor at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards in January.\n\n“Washington’s long and storied career is earmarked by his countless roles in front and behind the camera,” said Hollywood Foreign Press Association President Lorenzo Soria in a statement.\n\nWashington already has two Oscars, two Golden Globes and a Tony Award under his belt, along with a string of box-office hits including last year's The Equalizer. Next year, Washington re-teams with The Equalizer and Training Day director Antoine Fuqua for the remake of The Magnificent Seven, due in September 2016.\n\nThe actor will be only the third Black man in history to be recognized with the DeMille Award. Morgan Freeman and Sidney Poitier were past recipients. Last year’s honoree was George Clooney, and previous ones include Woody Allen, Jodie Foster, Robert De Niro and others.\n\nThe 2016 Golden Globes will be hosted by Ricky Gervais on January 10.
