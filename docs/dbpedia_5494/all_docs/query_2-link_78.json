        "text": "Tom Hanks has a cold.\n\nThat didn’t stop him from being at the Golden Globes on Sunday to accept the Cecil B. DeMille Award for achievement in film.\n\nThe actor said that he had been made jittery by all the “savagely orange drinks” he had to consume in order to fight his cold.\n\nHanks, 63, took more than one beat in his acceptance speech to fight back tears. He blamed his emotional state on the illness, but clearly seemed touched by the honor.\n\nCharlize Theron presented the veteran actor with the DeMille Award, one of two career awards given that night. The other was the Carol Burnett Award, which went to Ellen DeGeneres for her work in TV.\n\nHanks, a two-time Oscar winner, has won four Golden Globes in his career, his first for “Big” in 1989, and his most recent for “Cast Away” in 2001. He was also nominated this year for best supporting actor in a film for playing Mister Rogers in “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.”\n\nThe actor reacted with glee and amazement to a career retrospective video that started with his role in TV series “The Love Boat.\" But his voice began to crack when he addressed his family in the audience, including his wife, Rita Wilson.\n\nHanks began his remarks by paying tribute to talents he’s worked with throughout his career, from highly experienced actors to those just starting out.\n\n“You know, you’re a dope if you don’t steal from everybody you’ve ever worked with,” he said. “And I have stolen from the likes of the people that only need one name, you know? Like Meryl. Like Denzel. Like Antonio. Like Meg. Like Julia. Like Sally Field. Even though that’s two names, it’s still one.”\n\nHanks went on to name-check directors and screenwriters by using their first names, too — Nora, Penny, Bob, Paul, Clint.\n\nHe described his work, and all of acting, as a process by which collaborators of every type have a hand in helping him hit his mark and “go there\" as a performer.\n\nHanks recalled being an intern in 1977, at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival, where he and others working there got reamed out by the director, who told them they had to show up on time, know the material and come armed with a “head full of ideas.”\n\n“That was the greatest lesson a young actor could possibly ever get,” Hanks said.\n\nHave a tip?
