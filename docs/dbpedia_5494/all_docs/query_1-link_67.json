        "text": "A Century of Film\n\nThe Golden Globes\n\nI should probably start with the obvious: the Golden Globe Awards are a registered trademark of the HFPA (which is also trademarked). I don’t have their permission to write any of this (and I don’t need it) and I don’t own any of the photos. They are also a major part of the film industry, whether anyone likes it or not (and many people don’t for very good reasons). They have been around for a long time and there is a lot that is odd but also some that is very good about them. So I’ve compiled a post of various info, trivia and assorted little tidbits about the awards, organized by category.\n\nThis is part of my Century of Film series which focuses on the first century of feature length filmmaking (1912-2011) but I’ve gone ahead and included the full history of the awards, right down to today (August of 2020, so including the awards this past January).\n\nThe Golden Globes were started by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in 1943, a new organization of reporters for various foreign papers that were stationed in Hollywood. So, first, this was a group of reporters, not critics and second, it was a very small group. So it was very different from the New York Film Critics Awards (critics) and the Academy (film industry people). But it often gave out awards that were very similar.\n\nAs I note down in the Picture – Drama section, for the first several years, the awards were handed out after the Oscar nominations but before the Oscars. Since they also didn’t have nominees, it basically meant they could pick and choose from the Oscar nominees. They were paid so little attention that the book Inside Oscar doesn’t mention them until 1946 and even then only in passing. But in 1950, they got an interesting idea and kind of changed the course of film history.\n\nThat idea was to split the major awards (acting at first, Picture starting the next year) into Drama and Comedy / Musical. They could give out more awards and get more people to show up. Since the Globes have, in all of my memory, had a reputation for being starfuckers, that fits into their personalities.\n\nBut, really, it’s a great idea that doesn’t go far enough. In the 90s, the Golden Satellites would expand on that by also splitting the supporting awards and my own awards split all the major categories (though after doing the primary nominations first). It also meant that great actors who worked a lot in Comedy, which is often treated like a lesser genre by the Academy, would get their just rewards.\n\nI won’t give a whole history of the Globes but their power has existed because they are willing to be one of the first groups (I remember in 1997 when Titanic lead the way with nominations just in time for it to have ads running the day it opened with its haul of nominations) and they have the split categories. But both of those things can backfire as well, like when things have big pre-opening buzz and get lots of nominations and then turn out to be duds (Nine) or when you have a year that’s weak in Comedy (like 2009 when Nine opened).\n\nWhat’s more the HFPA has often shot itself in the foot with embarrassments like wining and dining and getting big wins for Scent of a Woman or major nominations for The Tourist. But that’s also countered by allowing the stars to drink during the ceremony and having more gutsy hosts (all-time favorite moment – when Tina said “After two movies in Boston, Ben Affleck made Argo, a film set in Tehran, because he wanted to work in a city that was more welcoming to outsiders.” followed by Amy, in her Medford accent, going “You think you’re better than me?”) which can make for a more entertaining ceremony. I guarantee you the Oscars would never have a moment like Ricky Gervais saying “I like a drink as much as the next man. Unless the next man is Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson, ladies and gentlemen.”\n\nSo, here are the Globes and their odd and somewhat scattered history. They are the group that nominated The Tourist and gave Best Picture to Love Story. But they also nominated Do the Right Thing and gave Best Picture to Brokeback Mountain.\n\nBecause I have written pieces already on most of the categories listed below, the links with the category name go to those posts which have more detail on the Globe history and the all-time points leaders.\n\nRandom Trivia\n\nNominated For Best Picture But Nothing Else:\n\nDrama: 13\n\nComedy: 51\n\nNominated for Best Picture But Nothing Else Since 1992:\n\nDrama: The Great Debaters\n\nComedy: 17\n\nnote: Woody Allen is the only director to have three films nominated for Picture but nothing else (Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Everyone Says I Love You).\n\n# of Films Nominated for Actor and Actress but Not Picture:\n\nDrama: 13\n\nComedy: 27\n\n# of Films Nominated for Actor and Actress but Not Picture Since 1963:\n\nDrama: 6\n\nComedy: 25\n\nnote: The only two films to win Actor and Actress without a Picture nomination were A Star is Born (no nominations in 1954, just winners) and Educating Rita (eligible only as Foreign Film).\n\nThe Only Film to Win Actor and Actress without a Picture nom:\n\nA Star is Born (1954)\n\nGlobe / Oscar Agreement\n\nnote: In all of these years, the eventual Oscar winner for Picture, Director, Actor and Actress all won the Globe first.\n\n1954\n\n1957\n\n1958\n\n1964\n\n1971\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1984\n\n1987\n\n1990\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1997\n\n2003\n\n2013\n\nGlobe – Drama / Oscar Disagreement\n\nnote: These are the years when all three Drama winners (Picture, Actor, Actress) failed to win the Oscar\n\n1951\n\n1964\n\n1965\n\n1968\n\n1973\n\n1974\n\n1977\n\n1989\n\n1998\n\nnote: In 1973, the Oscar winning Picture wasn’t nominated at the Globes.

With the Oscar winner for 1943 in Picture and Director possibly not eligible (it was from 1942), it didn’t set much of a precedent. It was followed over the next several years by several directors that won the Oscar and the occasional one that didn’t. In 1950, the category expanded to four nominees, all of whom were Oscar nominated. Then in 1951 there were three nominees and the winner wasn’t an Oscar nominee (the first of just seven in almost 80 years). In 1952 there were again three nominees and the winner didn’t win the Oscar (though it won Best Picture at the Oscars). For the next three years there was just a winner with the first two winning the Oscar and the third getting a nomination. Then the Globes settled down (like with almost all their categories) and went to five nominees. There would be the odd years of 1962 and 1963 (11 and 8 nominees) and eight different times there have been six nominees but five is still the standard.\n\nFor the most part, Director nominees get nominated for something else. Only nine films have managed just a Director nomination including just once from 1964 to 1991. Indeed, 85% of the films nominated for Director are nominated for Picture and that number goes up to just shy of 90% if you throw in Foreign Film in place of Picture.\n\nThe winner of Best Director usually wins something else but in general twice a decade (just once in the 40s and 70s) a film wins Director with no other wins. Of note, of the last nine films to do that, five also won the Oscar for Best Director (three for Picture as well).\n\nFive Best Directorial Efforts Nominated by the Globes but not the Oscars\n\nEd Zwick (Glory)\n\nSteven Spielberg (Jaws)\n\nAng Lee (Sense and Sensibility)\n\nPeter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers)\n\nTodd Haynes (Carol)\n\nWon Director but No other Nominations:\n\nFrank Capra (It’s a Wonderful Life)\n\nJoshua Logan (Picnic)\n\nnote: These are both from a period where most categories didn’t have nominees but only winners.\n\nTop 5 Most Points – No Director Nom\n\nThe Goodbye Girl – 350\n\nA Star is Born – 310\n\nThe Sunshine Boys – 305\n\nArthur – 285\n\nScent of a Woman – 280\n\nnote: The first four of these are easily explained – Comedy winners for Picture and Actor and at least one other award and all from the same era as it turns out. The fifth is also easy – it won Picture – Drama and Screenplay in kind of a scandal and it had no business being nominated for either in the first place which is why it wasn’t nominated for Director. Sixth on the list is High Noon which is very odd since it absolutely should have both been nominated and won Director (and it should have won Picture but it didn’t).\n\nWon the Globe But Wasn’t Oscar Nominated:\n\n1951: Laszlo Benedek (Death of a Salesman)\n\n1956: Elia Kazan (Baby Doll)\n\n1968: Paul Newman (Rachel Rachel)\n\n1969: Charlos Jarrott (Anne of the Thousand Days) *\n\n1983: Barbra Steisand (Yentl) *\n\n1988: Clint Eastwood (Bird)\n\n2012: Ben Affleck (Argo)\n\nnote: The starred films weren’t nominated by any group except the Globes.\n\nWon the Globe and Oscar but not the Consensus\n\n1959: William Wyler (Ben Hur)\n\n1971: William Friedkin (The French Connection)\n\n1982: Richard Attenborough (Gandhi)\n\n1990: Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves)\n\n1994: Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump)\n\n1997: James Cameron (Titanic)\n\n2015: Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu (The Revenant)\n\nWon the Globe and Consensus but not the Oscar\n\n1949: Robert Rossen (All the King’s Men)\n\n1985: John Huston (Prizzi’s Honor)\n\n2010: David Fincher (The Social Network)\n\n2014: Richard Linklater (Boyhood)\n\nPicture\n\nNominated for Director but not Picture: 37\n\nNominated for Director and nothing else: 9\n\nEarned Oscar nomination for Picture: 4\n\nnote: Of those 37 films, 17 were nominated for a lead acting award. None were in Comedy.\n\nTop Director in Points by Decade:\n\n40s: seven directors – 90\n\n50s: Elia Kazan / Vincente Minnelli / Fred Zinnemann – 180\n\nironic since Zinnemann wasn’t nominated for High Noon\n\n60s: David Lean / Stanley Kramer / Robert Wise – 180\n\n70s: Francis Ford Coppola – 270\n\n80s: Richard Attenborough / Oliver Stone – 180\n\n90s: Steven Spielberg – 225\n\n00s: Clint Eastwood – 270\n\n10s: Alfonso Cuaron – 180\n\nProgressive #1 All-Time\n\n1943: Henry King – 90\n\n1944: Henry King / Leo McCarey – 90\n\n1945: Henry King / Leo McCarey / Billy Wilder – 90\n\n1946: four directors – 90\n\n1947: five directors – 90\n\n1948: six directors – 90\n\n1949: seven directors – 90\n\n1950-1953: Billy Wilder – 180\n\n1953-1955: Billy Wilder / Elia Kazan – 180\n\n1956-1959: Elia Kazan – 270\n\n1960-1962: Elia Kazan / Billy Wilder – 270\n\n1963-1972: Elia Kazan – 360\n\n1973-1976: Elia Kazan / Fred Zinnemann – 360\n\n1977-1997: Fred Zinnemann – 405\n\n1998-2000: Steven Spielberg – 450\n\n2001-2004: Steven Spielberg – 495\n\n2005-2011: Steven Spielberg – 540\n\n2012-2016: Steven Spielberg – 585\n\n2017-2019: Steven Spielberg – 630\n\nTop 10 Points All-Time:\n\nSteven Spielberg – 630 (12 noms, 2 wins)\n\nMartin Scorsese – 540 (9 noms, 3 wins)\n\nClint Eastwood – 450 (7 noms, 3 wins)\n\nFred Zinnemann – 405 (7 noms, 2 wins)\n\nElia Kazan – 360 (4 noms, 4 wins)\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola – 360 (6 noms, 2 wins)\n\nBilly Wilder – 315 (5 noms, 2 wins)\n\nDavid Lean – 315 (4 noms, 3 wins)\n\nJohn Huston – 315 (5 noms, 2 wins)\n\nSidney Lumet – 315 (6 noms, 1 win)\n\nOliver Stone – 315 (4 noms, 3 wins)\n\nMilos Forman – 315 (4 noms, 3 wins)\n\nnote: Eastwood and Coppola are among the few directors to earn two noms in a single year (2006 and 1974).\n\nnote: Robert Wise (2 Oscars) and Woody Allen (Oscar) ironically are tied for the Globe record with 5 noms and no wins.\n\nMost Nominated Films:\n\nWoody Allen – 20\n\nSteven Spielberg – 19\n\nMartin Scorsese – 18\n\nBlake Edwards – 16\n\nGeorge Cukor – 15\n\nClint Eastwood – 14\n\nBilly Wilder – 13\n\nNorman Jewison – 13\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola / Arthur Hiller – 12\n\nRon Howard / Sidney Lumet / Sydney Pollock – 12\n\nMost Total Nominations\n\nSteven Spielberg – 60\n\nMartin Scorsese – 60\n\nWoody Allen – 46\n\nMike Nichols – 44\n\nBilly Wilder – 41\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola – 41\n\nBlake Edwards – 39\n\nNorman Jewison – 37\n\nStanley Kramer – 35\n\nSidney Lumet – 36\n\nHerbert Ross – 34\n\nMost Total Wins\n\nBilly Wilder – 18\n\nHerbert Ross – 13\n\nFred Zinnemann – 12\n\nNorman Jewison – 12\n\nGeorge Cukor – 11\n\nElia Kazan – 11\n\nMike Nichols – 11\n\nMartin Scorsese – 11\n\nSteven Spielberg – 11\n\nOliver Stone – 10\n\nnote: Herbert Ross, in 1977, won both Best Picture awards.\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nThe Globes began their Best Screenplay Award in 1947, simply giving an award to Miracle on 34th Street. They were then inconsistent, giving awards in 1948, 51, 53 and 54 but having a slate of two nominees in 1949 and three each in 1950 and 1952. The first three to win the award were all Original but the next five were all Adapted. Then the Globes dropped the category just as they were re-opening their other categories to full slates of nominees again. It wouldn’t be revived until 1965 at which point it would become regular (5 nominees with a handful of exceptions with six nominees).\n\nFive Best Screenplays Nominated by the Globes but Not Nominated for Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars\n\nBeing There\n\nGlory\n\nCloser\n\nGone Girl\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nFive Best Screenplays Nominated by the Globes but Not Nominated for Original Screenplay at the Oscars\n\nThe Hateful Eight\n\nMona Lisa\n\nThe Post\n\nThe Man Who Wasn’t There\n\nHouse of Games\n\nFive Best Films Nominated for Screenplay but Nothing Else\n\nLone Star\n\nMemento\n\nSabrina\n\nThe Sting\n\nGrand Canyon\n\nWon Screenplay but No other Nominations:\n\nThe Search\n\nFive Fingers\n\nLili\n\nSabrina\n\nnote: These are all from a period where most categories didn’t have nominees but only winners.\n\nTop 5 Most Points – Not Nominated for Screenplay (post-1965):\n\nA Star is Born (1976) – 310\n\nMoulin Rouge – 310\n\nYentl – 295\n\nArthur – 285\n\nThe Revenant – 285\n\nWon the Globe But Wasn’t Oscar Nominated:\n\n1951: Bright Victory\n\n1968: Charly *\n\n1980: The Ninth Configuration *\n\n1986: The Mission\n\n1996: The People vs. Larry Flynt *\n\n2002: About Schmidt\n\n2015: Steve Jobs\n\nnote: The starred films weren’t nominated by any group except the Globes.\n\nThe Biggest Directors:\n\nSteven Spielberg: 8 noms, 1 win\n\nWoody Allen: 6 noms, 2 wins\n\nMartin Scorsese: 6 noms\n\nQuentin Tarantino: 5 noms, 3 wins\n\nFred Zinnemann: 5 noms, 2 wins\n\nRobert Altman: 5 noms\n\nMike Nichols: 5 noms\n\nnote: Allen and Tarantino are in bold because they actually were the screenwriters as well as the directors.\n\nYears in Which the Globe Nominees for Best Screenplay Were the Oscar Nominees for Best Picture (1965-2008 only)\n\n1966: A Man for All Seasons, Alfie, The Russians are Coming the Russians are Coming, The Sand Pebbles, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf\n\n1982: Gandhi, E.T., Missing, Tootsie, The Verdict\n\n1984: Amadeus, The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart, A Soldier’s Story\n\n1994: Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Quiz Show, The Shawshank Redemption\n\nnote: In the first three, the Globe Screenplay winner also won the Oscar for Picture.\n\nScreenplay But Not Picture or Director\n\nNominated: 48\n\nWon: 8\n\nEarned Oscar Nomination for Picture: 11\n\nWon Oscar: 2\n\nThe Sting\n\nCrash\n\nTrivia:\n\n33 films have won Screenplay and Picture.

Of the 23 Drama winners, 17 also won Director.\n\nTwo films have won Director and Screenplay without winning Picture. Gandhi won Foreign Film (and thus wasn’t eligible for Picture) while People vs Larry Flynt lost Picture to The English Patient.\n\nThrough 2002, 16 films had won Screenplay and Actor and 15 of them were Dramas (The Goodbye Girl was the exception). Since 2002 only three films have won Screenplay and Actor and none of them were Dramas (Lost in Translation, Birdman, La La Land).\n\nSince the category began in full in 1965 only two eligible films have won Screenplay without a Picture nomination: The Hospital and Steve Jobs.\n\nIt took until 2007 for a Foreign language film to earn a Screenplay nomination (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly).\n\nBest Picture – Drama\n\nThe category began a bit oddly, without any real distinction, though it is often categorized as if it were Best Picture – Drama right from the beginning. In 1943, the Globes gave Best Picture. It went to The Song of Bernadette rather than the Oscar winner Casablanca but given that Casablanca was actually originally released in 1942, the Globes might not have considered it. For the next four years, the Globes gave the award to the Oscar winner, which was interesting since they announced the awards after the Oscar nominations but before the Oscars. In 1948, the Oscars went with Hamlet, which may or may not have been considered by the Globes (in later years it would not have been) and the Globes went with a tie between Johnny Belinda and Treasure of the Sierra Madre. The next year was the first to have nominees (just two) although the Oscar winner again won the Globe.\n\nThe 1950s\n\nIn 1950, the Globes split along genre lines for acting but not for Picture which may not have mattered since Harvey was considered a Drama and Judy Holliday was nominated in both categories for Born Yesterday. It was the first year of a five nominee slate and while they agreed with the Oscars on three of them, the last two (Harvey, Cyrano de Bergerac) were far, far better than the other Oscar nominees (King Solomon’s Mines, Father of the Bride). The next year, the Oscar winner was a Musical but the Globes went with A Place in the Sun, perhaps a prelude to its major Oscar success. This was also the first year that the Globes announced their nominees ahead of the Oscars, a tradition that continues to today. In 1952, there was more Oscar agreement (Greatest Show on Earth) but it was perhaps the worst Globe slate in history with only High Noon standing out. But in 1953, it was back to winners only for three years, with a film that didn’t win the Oscar (The Robe), a film that did (On the Waterfront) and one of just three films to not even earn an Oscar nomination (East of Eden). Starting in 1956, when the nominees went back to five (usually), the only time until 1969 that the eventual Oscar winner didn’t win was because it won Comedy (or Musical).\n\nThe 1960s\n\nIn a decade filled with Comedies and Musicals at the Oscars only three eventual Oscar winners won the Globe (Lawrence of Arabia, Man for All Seasons, In the Heat of the Night). Two films didn’t even earn Best Picture nominations at the Oscars (Spartacus, The Cardinal). In 1962 and 1963 they nominated 10 and 9 films respectively including such crap as David and Lisa and Cleopatra but also films like The Great Escape and Hud. In 1969, however, Midnight Cowboy became just the second Oscar winner (along with All About Eve) to actually lose the Globe. In all, 26 films in the decade were nominated for the Globe and the Oscar. But another 8 films that were nominated for Director but not Picture at the Oscars are nominated.\n\nThe 1970s\n\nThe decade begins with one of the most mind-boggling decisions in Globe history when Love Story wins over Patton and Five Easy Pieces. Patton is later joined by Godfather Part II and Deer Hunter as Oscar winners that lose the Globe but they lost to Chinatown and Midnight Express. Turning Point is another odd winner, over both Star Wars and Close Encounters. Most years have at least three Oscar nominees, several have four and 1975 has all five though 1973 only has one in spite of six nominees. 32 of the 50 Oscars nominees are nominated. What’s more, the Globes pass over two of the weakest Oscar nominees of the decade (Nicholas and Alexandra, Towering Inferno).\n\nThe 1980s\n\nThe Globes match the Oscars 7/7 with the other three winning in the categories they are eligible in. The only eligible Oscar nominee passed over by the Globes is Dangerous Liaisons. There is the head-scratching nomination of Ninth Configuration and the odd expansion to six nominees in 1986 and 1987 and then eight in 1988 but the worst choices are generally agreed upon by the Oscars. What’s more, films like Sophie’s Choice, Mona Lisa, Running on Empty, Unbearable Lightness of Being, Do the Right Thing and Glory are Globe noms but not Oscar noms. In every year, at least two Globe nominees are Oscar nominees and usually three or four.\n\nThe 1990s\n\nAfter starting the awards tide towards Dances with Wolves in 1990 (they would do the same in 1994 with Gump and 1997 with Titanic), Silence of the Lambs becomes the first Oscar winner to lose the category since 1978. It’s followed up by the scandal of the shitty Scent of a Woman winning after it becomes known that the producers wined and dined the HFPA. But the Globes redeem themselves by picking Sense and Sensibility rather than Braveheart. Until 98, every year has at least three Oscar nominees, including all five in 1992, but the last two year it’s just two each. The Globes embarrass themselves by nominating Legends of the Fall and Nell instead of Shawshank but they redeem themselves by nominating Talented Mr. Ripley and End of the Affair instead of Green Mile.\n\nThe 2000s\n\nAfter standard Oscar fare for four years, the Globes begin their longest stretch of disagreement. Oscar winners Million Dollar Baby, Crash, Departed, No Country for Old Men and Hurt Locker are passed over for Aviator, Brokeback, Babel, Atonement and Avatar, which makes for a really mixed bag of being considerably better and considerably worse. Most nominations are the same – until the Oscar expand in 2009 the only Oscar nominees without Globe nominations are Crash, Capote and Milk. The Globes also occasionally with six nominees in 2000 and 2004 and seven in 2007. But there are films the Oscars overlooked like Wonder Boys, Mulholland Drive, Closer, Constant Gardener, History of Violence, Eastern Promises and Revolutionary Road. After strong agreement among nominees (only one year less than three, most with four) before 2009, the expansion of the Oscars meant there would be more agreement with all five 2009 films earning Oscar noms (though, ironically, none of the Comedy slate).\n\nThe 2010s\n\nAfter failing to convince the Oscars of the Dances / Gump / Titanic trick with Avatar, the Globes went the other way, embracing critics favorite Social Network only for the Oscars to go with the more populist King’s Speech. That would be joined by Spotlight and Shape of Water in losing the Globe. Along with Comedies winning, it meant that only Argo, 12 Years a Slave and Moonlight won both the Globe and Oscar in the decade. The expanded Oscars would mean strong agreement. In the decade only Ides of March, Rush, Foxcatcher, Carol, If Beale Street Could Talk and Two Popes would fail to earn Oscar noms. The main oddity would be 2018 where the Globes would allow Bohemian Rhapsody and A Star is Born to compete as Dramas and then the former would win the award over four far superior films.\n\nTen Best Films Nominated by the Globes but not the Oscars\n\nGlory\n\nThe Age of Innocence\n\nCarol\n\nMulholland Drive\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nSpartacus\n\nThe Great Escape\n\nRevolutionary Road\n\nSophie’s Choice\n\nA History of Violence\n\nFive Best Films Nominated for Picture but Nothing Else\n\nThe Crying Game\n\nThe Great Escape\n\nManhattan\n\nCrimes and Misdemeanors\n\nThe Right Stuff\n\nnote: Only 13 films have earned Picture – Drama noms and nothing else.

One won Picture and Actress (The Hours).\n\nSince nominations came back in 1956, only five Picture winners have won every award they were nominated for: Bohemian Rhapsody (2/2), Return of the King and Slumdog Millionaire (each 4/4) and Doctor Zhivago and Cuckoo (each 5/5).\n\nPicture matches up with Actor far more than anything else: 193 films have been nominated for both (as opposed to Supporting Actor with only 45 overlapping).\n\nNo Picture nominee has ever been nominated for just Picture and Screenplay.\n\nScent of a Woman is the only film to win Picture and Screenplay without a Director nom.\n\nFrom 1965 (when Screenplay began) to 2002, every Picture and Director winner (21 films) at least earned a Screenplay nom.

In spite of acting categories split in 1950, it wasn’t until the next year that the Globes first awarded Best Picture – Comedy. The early history was bizarre (as it was for a lot of the Globes categories at the time). It started with just a winner in 1951 (An American in Paris), then had five nominees in 1952, then no category at all in 1953 and just winners in 1954 and 1955, then full slates of five nominees again in 56 and 57.\n\nThen, in 1958, the Globe split the award, giving a separate Best Picture – Musical award. It was clear from the start there really wasn’t enough to justify that award. There were four nominees in 1958, five in 59 and 60, down to three in 61, back up to five in 62 and by 63 it was gone. During that whole time, Comedy stayed at five nominees. With three exceptions of six nominees (1963, 1986, 1998), it’s been five ever since.\n\nThe 1950s\n\nAt first, the Globes focused on popular films even if they weren’t that great. Of the 38 films nominated in the two categories in the 50’s, only two (Singin’ in the Rain, Some Like It Hot) were great and the first of them didn’t even win losing to With a Song in My Heart. The films nominated averaged just a 68 (not bad but not good for Best Picture nominees). The winners were a bit better, but still only 71.7 and only three of the ten winners (no winner in 1950 or 1953, two each in 1958 and 1959) even reach the ***.5 level I require to have a film be considered (The King and I, Some Like It Hot, Porgy and Bess).\n\nThe 1960s\n\nIronically, things improved rather than deteriorated when the categories were split with the 1960 Comedy nominees being not only the best of the bunch, but, except for one year, the best group of nominees until 1977. What’s more, the 1961 Comedy nominees were that year, with an average of 79.6, finally nominating two great films (One Two Three, Breakfast at Tiffany’s), though again, giving the winner to a mid-*** film (A Majority of One). The 1961 nominees wouldn’t be bested until 1982. The rest of the decade, after the categories were re-combined, wasn’t as good. The average nominee was 70.1 and four of the last five years of the decade actually had a bad film among the nominees (Cat Ballou, Not With My Wife You Don’t, Doctor Dolittle, Paint Your Wagon). Doctor Dolittle would remain the worst nominee in the category’s history until 1998. The winners did get considerably better though with an 81.9 average and six of the winners were the best choice. But 1967 had the lowest average for the nominees until 2010 (62.0) but at least had one great film which also won the award (The Graduate) while 1969 was almost as bad (63.0) and had no film higher than a 73.\n\nThe 1970s\n\nThe decade would start strong and end strong but would get pretty bad in-between. In the first four years, there were three truly great winners (M*A*S*H, Cabaret, American Graffiti) and three years averaging above 70. The last three years would have strong winners (Goodbye Girl, Heaven Can Wait, Breaking Away) although Annie Hall wouldn’t win and All That Jazz wouldn’t even be nominated. But the average for the three years was 76.5, much better than any stretch before it. But from 74 to 76, there would be only two nominees over a 77 (in the same year even so they couldn’t both win), two terrible nominees (Little Prince, Tommy) and an overall average of 65.7. It should be remembered that in this decade, two Comedies won Best Picture at the Oscars (The Sting, Annie Hall) and the latter didn’t win the Globe and the former wasn’t even nominated.\n\nThe 1980s\n\nThings really take a step up here, at least in one way. The average nominee in 1981 is 73.0, which is good enough for 10th out of 32 years to that point. But that’s the lowest of the decade by several points. The nominees for the decade average a 79.3, finally reaching the level they should be at. What’s more, there are only two nominees in the whole decade below *** (Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, Flashdance). Unfortunately, the winners aren’t better. The winners average just a 79.6, barely better than the average nominee and as many winners are the worst of the nominees (Arthur, Working Girl, Driving Miss Daisy) as the best (Tootsie, Hannah and Her Sisters, Hope and Glory). Working Girl is a new low, with a rating 15 points below the average nominee of the year and winning over Who Framed Roger Rabbit and A Fish Called Wanda. The 1985 nominees (Prizzi’s Honor, Purple Rose of Cairo, Back to the Future, Cocoon, A Chorus Line) are the first to average over 80.\n\nThe 1990s\n\nThe decade starts poorly with the worst year for nominees since 1976 (Ghost, Green Card, Pretty Woman, Dick Tracy, Home Alone). After that, the nominees for the other years average a 79.1 or an 80.4 if you try to ignore that the Globes added a sixth nominee in 1998 and gave it to Patch Adams, the worst nomination in the category’s history. Three times the award would go to the best nominee (Beauty and the Beast, The Player, Shakespeare in Love) but twice it would go to the worst (Mrs. Doubtfire, Evita). That last one is mitigated in that it’s barely the weakest of the nominees and it’s the 17th best nominee of the decade but it’s the best year to this point. 1996 also has Fargo, Jerry Maguire, Everyone Says I Love You and The Birdcage, making it the first year to have a full slate of nominees at ***.5 or better and the best average until 2007 and still the fourth best ever. The winners as whole in the decade average an 82.6. Two of the best years (1992, 1994) are mitigated by having the other two bad films nominated in the decade (Sister Act, Pret-a-Porter).\n\nThe 2000s\n\nThe first half of the decade is incredible. The nominees average an 85.1. The winners average a 95.8 and it’s the longest streak of the Globes picking the best of the nominees (all five years). The worst nominee of the stretch is still a high **.5 (Legally Blonde). But then comes the second half of the decade. In 2005, there’s only one great film and it’s not the winner. In 2006, there are no great films and two mediocre films. 2007 has some recovery (an 89.0 average – the highest to-date and second highest ever) but the next year has no great film and an actual bad film (Mamma Mia) while 2009 dives down with no great film, only one very good film (500 Days of Summer, which doesn’t win) and three mediocre films and the worst average since 1990 and tied for the worst since 1976. The average for the second half of the decade is 77.0 for the nominees and 83.8 for the winners.\n\nThe 2010s\n\nThe decade starts with a bomb, the lowest average nominee in history (55.2) by a long way. It has the second (The Tourist) and third (Burlesque) worst nominees in the category’s history. But that’s the outlier year, especially since the one great film (The Kids are All Right) wins. It’s the start of a decade where seven out of ten times the best film wins the award and the winners average a fantastic 92.4 (or 94.9 if not for Green Book). The nominees average a very strong 85.3 after 2010 (82.3 with it). Plus, in 2013 we have the first year ever where all the nominees are great films, a whopping 94.4 average, by far the best in the category’s history. Then came 2019 with an almost as good 93.0 average, easily the second best in history.\n\nTen Best Films Nominated by the Globes but not the Oscars\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\nEd Wood\n\nSome Like It Hot\n\nAcross the Universe\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nInside Llewyn Davis\n\nAlmost Famous\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally…\n\nThe Fisher King\n\nFive Best Films Nominated for Picture but Nothing Else\n\nAcross the Universe\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing\n\nThe Commitments\n\nThe Incredibles\n\nFinding Nemo\n\nWon Picture but No other Nominations:\n\nCarmen Jones (1954)\n\nBabe (1995)\n\nThe Hangover (2009)\n\nTop 5 Most Points – Comedy / Musical Film Not Nominated for Picture:\n\nnote: This list is made up of films that we know were considered Comedy or Musical (earned noms in Actor or Actress) and were eligible for Picture (not for Foreign Film).\n\nA Star is Born – 140\n\nCome Blow Your Horn – 135\n\nLittle Voice – 135\n\nThe Mirror Has Two Faces – 130\n\nGoodbye Mr. Chips – 125\n\nnote: As mentioned above, A Star is Born is the only film to win Actor and Actress without a Picture nomination.\n\nYears in Which None of the Globe Nominees Earned any other Consensus Points:\n\n1957 (Les Girls, Don’t Go Near the Water, Love in the Afternoon, Pal Joey, Silk Stockings)\n\n1960 – Musical (Song Without End, Bells are Ringing, Can-Can, Let’s Make Love, Pepe)\n\n1961 (A Majority of One, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, One Two Three, Parent Trap, Pocketful of Miracles)\n\n1962 (That Touch of Mink, Best of Enemies, Boys Night, If a Man Answers, Period of Adjustment)\n\n1975 (The Sunshine Boys, Funny Lady, Return of the Pink Panther, Shampoo, Tommy)\n\n1981 (Arthur, Four Seasons, Pennies from Heaven, S.O.B., Zoot Suit)\n\n1984 (Romancing the Stone, Beverly Hills Cop, Ghostbusters, Micki + Maude, Splash)\n\n2008 (Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Happy-Go-Lucky, In Bruges, Burn After Reading, Mamma Mia)\n\nWon the Globe, Oscar and Consensus:\n\n1960: The Apartment\n\n1961: West Side Story\n\n1963: Tom Jones\n\n1964: My Fair Lady\n\n1968: Oliver!\n\n1989: Driving Miss Daisy\n\n2011: The Artist\n\nWon the Globe and Oscar but not the Consensus:\n\n1951: An American in Paris\n\n1958: Gigi\n\n1965: The Sound of Music\n\n1998: Shakespeare in Love\n\n2018: Green Book\n\nWon the Globe and Consensus but not the Oscar:\n\n1970: M*A*S*H\n\n1972: Cabaret\n\n1985: Prizzi’s Honor\n\n1986: Hannah and Her Sisters\n\n1987: Hope and Glory\n\n2004: Sideways\n\n2016: La La Land\n\n2017: Lady Bird\n\nnote: In the case of six of these years (all except 1970 and 2017), the film that won the Drama Globe won the Oscar.\n\nThe Globe Winner Wasn’t Oscar Nominated But One of the Nominees Was:\n\n1969: The Secret of Santa Vittoria / Hello Dolly\n\n1983: Yentl / The Big Chill\n\n1990: Green Card / Ghost\n\n1994: The Lion King / Four Weddings and a Funeral\n\n1996: Evita / Fargo\n\n2000: Almost Famous / Chocolat\n\n2006: Dreamgirls / Little Miss Sunshine\n\n2007: Sweeney Todd / Juno\n\nThe Globe Winner Didn’t Win the Oscar But One of the Nominees Did:\n\n1977: The Goodbye Girl / Annie Hall\n\n2014: The Grand Budapest Hotel / Birdman\n\nBy Year, Picture – Comedy Nominees Nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars:\n\n1951: 0\n\n1952: 0\n\n1954: 0\n\n1955: 0\n\n1956: 1\n\n1957: 1\n\n1958: 1 (+1 Musical)\n\n1959: 0\n\n1960: 1\n\n1961: 0 (+1 Musical)\n\n1962: 0 (+1 Musical)\n\n1963: 1\n\n1964: 2\n\n1965: 2\n\n1966: 1\n\n1967: 2\n\n1968: 2\n\n1969: 1\n\n1970: 1\n\n1971: 1\n\n1972: 1\n\n1973: 2\n\n1974: 0\n\n1975: 0\n\n1976: 0\n\n1977: 2\n\n1978: 1\n\n1979: 1\n\n1980: 1\n\n1981: 0\n\n1982: 1\n\n1983: 1\n\n1984: 0\n\n1985: 1\n\n1986: 1\n\n1987: 3\n\n1988: 1\n\n1989: 1\n\n1990: 1\n\n1991: 1\n\n1992: 0\n\n1993: 0\n\n1994: 1\n\n1995: 1\n\n1996: 2\n\n1997: 2\n\n1998: 1\n\n1999: 0\n\n2000: 1\n\n2001: 2\n\n2002: 1\n\n2003: 1\n\n2004: 2\n\n2005: 0\n\n2006: 1\n\n2007: 1\n\n2008: 0\n\n2009: 0\n\n2010: 1\n\n2011: 2\n\n2012: 2\n\n2013: 4\n\n2014: 2\n\n2015: 2\n\n2016: 1\n\n2017: 2\n\n2018: 3\n\n2019: 2\n\nThe Biggest Directors:\n\nBilly Wilder: 7 noms, 2 wins\n\nWoody Allen: 7 noms, 2 wins\n\nRobert Altman: 5 noms, 2 wins\n\nHerbert Ross: 5 noms, 2 wins\n\nBlake Edwards: 11 noms\n\nStanley Donen: 6 noms\n\nGeorge Sidney: 5 noms\n\nnote: Of these seven directors, five of them had at least one film nominated for Picture – Drama.

Ten films have won all three, though only La La Land since 2005.\n\nFourteen Picture winners won every award they were nominated four. Three only won Picture (1/1), four won Picture and Actress (2/2), Mrs. Doubtfire won Picture and Actor, four films went 3/3 (three of which, Some Like It Hot, Driving Miss Daisy and Walk the Line, won Picture, Actor and Actress), A Star is Born went 5/5 and La La Land went 7/7.\n\nPicture matches up with Actor far more than anything else: 193 films have been nominated for both (as opposed to Supporting Actor with only 45 overlapping).\n\n52 films have been nominated for Picture and nothing else. The four in the 10s (Red, Moonrise Kingdom, Pride, Sing Street) is the fewest in a decade since the three in the 70s.\n\nA Chorus Line is the only film nominated for just Picture and Director\n\nThe only films nominated for just Picture and Screenplay are The Big Chill and Love Actually.\n\nFoul Play is the only Picture nominee to go 0 for 6.\n\nBest Actor – Drama\n\nThe category was separated out in 1950 with three nominees. It continued with three nominees through 1952 and then was just a winner until 1955 (actually a tie between two winners). Since then it has mostly stayed at five nominees with three small exceptions (six in 1967 and 1986, seven in 1983) and two large exceptions (10 nominees in 1962 followed by eight the next year).\n\nThis category is much less connected with Picture than the Comedy awards are. Only once has there been a streak of ten straight winners from a Picture nominee or winner and usually the streak stops before it gets to six or seven. At one point, from 2005 to 2009, only one winner came from a Picture nominee. Best Picture winners used to always at least get nominations: 24 of the Picture winners in a 28 year stretch from 1954 to 1981 earned at least an Actor nomination. But in the 38 years since there have been only another 23 films.\n\nThere is a strong connection with other awards. Of the 78 Globe winners (including the seven before the award split), 54 have gone on to win the Oscar and only four have failed to earn an Oscar nomination and only one since 1965. In total, 44 Actor winners have won the Consensus.\n\nFive Best Performances Nominated by the Globes but not the Oscars\n\nMichael Douglas (Wonder Boys)\n\nKirk Douglas (Detective Story)\n\nIan McKellen (Richard III)\n\nGene Hackman (The Conversation)\n\nHenry Fonda (12 Angry Men)\n\nFive Best Films Nominated for Actor but Nothing Else\n\nThe Pawnbroker\n\nRichard III\n\nDarkest Hour\n\nThe Quiet American\n\nCatch Me if You Can\n\nBest Picture – Drama and Best Actor Drama:\n\nWon Both: 26\n\nWon Both, also won Actress: 1\n\nWon Both, no Actress nomination: 22\n\nWon Picture, Actor nomination: 23\n\nWon Picture, no Actress nomination: 13\n\nWon Actor but No other Nominations:\n\nWatch on the Rhine (1943) *\n\nWilson (1944) *\n\nThe Yearling (1946) *\n\nA Double Life (1947)\n\nThe Actress (1953)\n\nMarty (1955) *\n\nCareer (1959)\n\nWall Street (1987)\n\nUlee’s Gold (1997)\n\nCast Away (2000)\n\nCapote (2005) *\n\nThe Last King of Scotland (2006)\n\nDarkest Hour (2017) *\n\nnote: The films with an asterisk, in spite of receiving no other Globe nominations, were all nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.\n\nWon the Globe and Oscar but not the Consensus:\n\n1952: Gary Cooper (High Noon)\n\n1963: Sidney Poitier (Lilies of the Field)\n\n1969: John Wayne (True Grit)\n\n1972: Marlon Brando (The Godfather)\n\n1976: Peter Finch (Network)\n\n1981: Henry Fonda (On Golden Pond)\n\n1992: Al Pacino (Scent of a Woman)\n\n1993: Tom Hanks (Philadelphia)\n\n2003: Sean Penn (Mystic River)\n\n2013: Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyers Club)\n\n2014: Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything)\n\n2017: Gary Oldman (Darkest Hour)\n\nWon the Globe and Consensus but not the Oscar:\n\n1956: Kirk Douglas (Lust for Life)\n\n1974: Jack Nicholson (Chinatown)\n\n1986: Bob Hoskins (Mona Lisa)\n\n2000: Tom Hanks (Cast Away)\n\n2001: Russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind)\n\nThe Biggest Directors:\n\nSidney Lumet: 8 noms, 3 wins\n\nMartin Scorsese: 7 noms, 2 wins\n\nStanley Kramer: 5 films, 6 noms, 1 win\n\nSteven Spielberg: 6 noms, 1 win\n\nElia Kazan: 5 noms, 2 wins\n\nNorman Jewison: 4 films, 5 noms, 2 wins\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola: 4 films, 5 noms, 1 win\n\nPeter Weir: 5 noms, 1 win\n\nMultiple Nominations:\n\nThe Defiant Ones (1958)\n\nSons and Lovers (1960)\n\nLawrence of Arabia (1962)\n\nIn the Heat of the Night (1967) (won)\n\nMidnight Cowboy (1969)\n\nThe Godfather (1972) (won)\n\nThe Dresser (1983) (won)\n\nAmadeus (1984) (won)\n\nKiss of the Spider Woman (1985)\n\nTrivia:\n\nNashville, the only film ever with 9 nominations, failed to earn an Actor nomination.\n\nBabel is the only film aside from Nashville with at least 7 nominations to fail to be nominated in either Actor or Actress.\n\nThere have been several back-to-back years with the Picture winner failing to earn an Actor nomination but there has never been a three year stretch.\n\nFour foreign language performances have earned nominations and none of them won: Marcello Mastroianni in 1977, Javier Bardem in 2000 and 2004 and Antonio Banderas in 2019.\n\nMore films won Picture, Director, Screenplay and Actor in the first two years of the Screenplay category (Doctor Zhivago, A Man for All Seasons) than have ever won Picture – Comedy, Director, Screenplay and Actor – Comedy.\n\nIn the first 25 years of the Screenplay category, seven films won those four major awards. Since 1989, no film has done it.\n\nWhile an astounding 13 Comedy films have won Actor and Actress including three by 1960 and two this century, only three Drama films have won Actor and Actress and, not only did they do it in the space of just three years, but all three films then repeated the wins at the Oscars: One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Network, Coming Home.\n\nIt took until 1993 for a film to win Actor and Song (Philadelphia).\n\nBest Actor – Comedy / Musical\n\nLike with Actor – Drama, the category was separated out in 1950 with three nominees and continued with three nominees through 1952 and then was just a winner until 1955. Since then, with two exceptions when it expanded to 8 nominees (1962 and 1963) and the occasional foray into six nominees (1978, 1987, 2005) it has stayed with five nominees.\n\nThere have been 343 nominees but only 332 films. The Picture relationship is interesting. It took until 1952 for the Actor winner to come from a Picture nominee even. It wasn’t until 1956 that the Actor winner came from the Picture winner (and there’s an oddity about that listed below). However, after that, they were inseparable. From 1956 to 1997, the only Actor winners not to come from Picture nominees were from films eligible in Foreign Film and not in Picture. Since then, there have been just a few occasions when the Actor winner didn’t come from a Picture nominee (1998, 2001, 2009, 2010). But the two are mostly inseparable now. But that doesn’t mean the winners line-up. Only once have the two winners had a streak of more than two years (1975-78).\n\nThe Comedy award doesn’t do well at the Consensus Awards. There have been multiple streaks of four straight Globe winners failing to earn Oscar nominations and from 1992 to 2010 only six Globe winners earned an Oscar nom and only two won the Oscar. This began early on with only one of the first nine Globe winners earning an Oscar nom. Only eight Globe winners in history have managed to go on to win the Consensus Award.\n\nFive Best Performances Nominated by the Globes but not the Oscars\n\nJohnny Depp (Ed Wood)\n\nRobert Preston (The Music Man)\n\nJim Carrey (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)\n\nJohn Cusack (High Fidelity)\n\nTim Robbins (The Player)\n\nFive Best Films Nominated for Actor but Nothing Else\n\nAll That Jazz\n\nA Serious Man\n\nInherent Vice\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums\n\nHigh Fidelity\n\nBest Picture – Comedy / Musical and Best Actor Comedy / Musical:\n\nWon Both: 27\n\nWon Both, also won Actress: 10\n\nWon Both, no Actress nomination: 12\n\nWon Picture, Actor nomination: 24\n\nWon Picture, no Actress nomination: 23\n\nYears in Which All the Actor – Comedy Nominees Came from Picture Nominees:\n\n1959\n\n1960\n\n1973\n\n1975\n\n1977\n\n2013\n\n2019\n\nWon Actor but No other Nominations:\n\nThree Little Words (1950)\n\nOn the Riviera (1951)\n\nThe Moon is Blue (1953)\n\nThe Seven Year Itch (1955)\n\nGood Morning Vietnam (1987)\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums (2001)\n\nSherlock Holmes (2009)\n\nBarney’s Version (2010)\n\nOddities\n\n1954: In the fifth year of the category, James Mason (A Star is Born) becomes the first Actor to win (or even be nominated for) the Globe to earn Consensus points from any other group.\n\n1956: Yul Brynner (The King and I) becomes the first Actor to lose the Globe and go on to win the Oscar. He is also the first Globe winner to win a critics award (the NBR). He loses the Globe to Cantinflas (Around the World in 80 Days) who earns no other Consensus points.\n\n1959: In the tenth year of the category, Jack Lemmon (Some Like It Hot) becomes just the third Globe winner (or nominee) to earn any other Consensus points. He also is the first to win the Globe and the BAFTA.\n\n1960: Jack Lemmon (The Apartment) becomes the first back-to-back winner.\n\n1963: In the fourteenth year of the category, Albert Finney (Tom Jones) becomes just the second nominee to earn any other Consensus points. He loses the Globe to Alberto Sordi (Il Diavolo) who has no other Consensus points but wins the Consensus.\n\n1964: Rex Harrison (My Fair Lady) becomes the first Globe winner to go on to win the Oscar.\n\n1966: Michael Caine becomes the first Actor nominated in Drama (Alfie) and Comedy (Gambit) in the same year.\n\n1967: Richard Harris (Camelot) wins the Globe but fails to earn any other Consensus points while Dustin Hoffman (The Graduate) earns an Oscar nom and Richard Burton (The Taming of the Shrew) earns a BAFTA nom.\n\n1969: Dustin Hoffman becomes the second Actor nominated in Drama (Midnight Cowboy) and Comedy (John and Mary).\n\n1972: Jack Lemmon (Avanti) wins the Globe without any other Consensus points, beating out NBR winner and Oscar nominee Peter O’Toole (The Ruling Class) and BAFTA winner Walter Matthau (Pete n Tillie).\n\n1984: Dudley Moore (Mikki and Maude) wins the Globe over Steve Martin (All of Me) even though Martin wins two critics awards.\n\n1993: Tom Hanks becomes the only Actor to win Drama (Philadelphia) and earn a Comedy nom (Sleepless in Seattle).\n\n2001: Billy Bob Thornton becomes the latest to earn Drama (The Man Who Wasn’t There) and Comedy (Bandits) noms.\n\n2011: Ryan Gosling becomes the most recent to-date to earn Drama (The Ides of March) and Comedy (Crazy Stupid Love).\n\nYears in Which None of the Globe Nominees Earned any other Consensus Points:\n\n1950\n\n1951\n\n1952\n\n1953\n\n1955\n\n1957\n\n1958\n\n1961\n\n1970\n\n1973\n\n1976\n\n1980\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nWon the Globe, Oscar and Consensus:\n\n1964: Rex Harrison (My Fair Lady)\n\n1965: Lee Marvin (Cat Ballou)\n\n1977: Richard Dreyfuss (The Goodbye Girl)\n\n1997: Jack Nicholson (As Good as It Gets)\n\n2004: Jamie Foxx (Ray)\n\nWon the Globe and Oscar but not the Consensus:\n\n1974: Art Carney (Harry and Tonto)\n\n2011: Jean Dujardin (The Artist)\n\nWon the Globe and Consensus but not the Oscar:\n\n1959: Jack Lemmon (Some Like It Hot)\n\n2003: Bill Murray (Lost in Translation)\n\n2014: Michael Keaton (Birdman)\n\nThe Biggest Directors:\n\nBilly Wilder: 8 films, 9 noms, 4 wins\n\nBlake Edwards: 9 noms, 1 win\n\nTim Burton: 7 noms, 1 win\n\nHerbert Ross: 5 films, 6 noms, 3 wins\n\nWoody Allen: 6 noms (three of which were him)\n\nNorman Jewison: 4 films, 5 noms, 2 wins\n\nnote: Five of the nine noms and three of the four wins in Wilder’s films were for Jack Lemmon.\n\nnote: Five of the seven noms (including the win) in Burton’s films were for Johnny Depp.\n\nnote: Woody Allen directed four Comedies which were nominated for Actress and nothing else. All six of the Comedies he directed that were nominated for Actor received at least one other nomination and five of them were nominated for Picture.\n\nMultiple Nominations:\n\nThe Teahouse of the August Moon (1956)\n\nGigi (1958)\n\nBillie Rose’s Jumbo (1962)\n\nThe Odd Couple (1968)\n\nM*A*S*H (1970)\n\nJesus Christ Superstar (1973)\n\nThe Front Page (1974)\n\nThe Sunshine Boys (1975) (won)\n\nThe Fisher King (1991) (won)\n\nIn Bruges (2008) (won)\n\nThe Big Short (2015)\n\nnote: Two of these films (The Odd Couple, The Front Page) the nominees were Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. Matthau was also nominated for The Sunshine Boys.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThere are three main Comedy films that failed to earn an Actor nomination – the only three with more than 5 nominations and the only three with more than 265 points: Cabaret, Working Girl, Shakespeare in Love.\n\nIn 1956, Cantinflas would win Actor for a film (Around the World in 80 Days) that would win Best Picture in Drama.\n\nEight of the last nine films to win Best Picture at the Globes were nominated for Actor.\n\nSurprisingly, only three films have won Picture, Director and Actor (My Fair Lady, Prizzi’s Honor, La La Land) and only the last also won Screenplay (it also won Actress).\n\nTwo foreign language performances have won the Globe and they were in back to back years: Marcello Mastroianni in Divorce Italian Style in 1962 and Alberto Sordi in Il Diavolo in 1963. The only other two nominations for foreign language performances were in 1964 and 1967.\n\nOnly three films have won Actor and Supporting Actor and they were in a six year span from 1975 to 1981 (The Sunshine Boys, Being There, Arthur).\n\nOf the five actors nominated for Drama and Comedy in the same year, Michael Caine and Dustin Hoffman earned Oscar noms for their Drama film, Tom Hanks won the Oscar for his Drama film and Billy Bob Thornton and Ryan Gosling failed to earn an Oscar nom at all.\n\nBest Actress – Drama\n\nThe Actress category was split in 1950. It had three nominees for three years, then just a winner for three years, then settled into the five nominee regularity with a few exceptions (six each in 1972 and 2003, 10 in 1962, 8 in 1963).\n\nThere have been 341 nominees from 332 films including five films that won the award and earned a second nomination. There were also three winners in 1988.\n\nThe first winner also won Best Picture (Sunset Blvd.) but then it would be 19 years before that happened again and only four of the winners in the meantime even came from Picture nominees. After back-to-back Picture / Actress winners in 69 and 70, there were two more years of the winners not even coming from nominees. Then came a new era and from 1973 to 1986 every Actress winner came from a Picture nominee (three of which won Picture). From then on, it’s been less consistent (although from 2002 to 2012, the even winners were from nominees and the odd winners weren’t). What’s more, only two Actress winners have come from Picture winners since 1983 (Hours, Three Billboards). A whopping 18 winners came from films with no other nominations, almost twice as many as in Comedy (20 if you count the two films where the only other nomination was also in Actress).\n\nThis category is much more respected than Comedy. Over half the Oscar winners since the Drama / Comedy split won the Globe – Drama first and even more than that have won the Consensus. What’s more, only one performance to win the Globe failed to earn an Oscar nomination and that was Shirley MacLaine in 1988 for Madame Sousatzka in a year where the Globes had three winners. There was a seven year streak of agreement in the 50s and a five year streak in the 90s.

However, the only three that didn’t win Actor all won Actress (Love Story, Anne of the Thousand Days, Ordinary People).\n\nThere have been 119 films nominated for Actress but nothing else as opposed to only 72 films nominated for Actor but nothing else.\n\nSeven films nominated for Actress but nothing else went on to earn Best Picture nominations at the Oscars: Roman Holiday, The Country Girl, Sounder, An Education, The Blind Side, Winter’s Bone, Brooklyn.\n\nFive films have won Picture, Director and Actress (Sunset Blvd., Anne of the Thousand Days, Love Story, One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Ordinary People). The middle three also won Screenplay. Cuckoo also won Actor.\n\nThree Foreign language performances have won the Globe: Anouk Aimee (A Man and a Woman), Liv Ullmann (The Emigrants) and Elizabeth Huppert (Elle). All of them also won Foreign Film.\n\nSince 1972, every Foreign performance nominated for Actress has also been nominated for Foreign Film (ten films).\n\nNo film has ever won Picture, Actress and Supporting Actress.\n\nSeventeen films have been nominated for Actress and Song but only two have won Actress and neither of those won Song.\n\nBest Actress – Comedy / Musical\n\nThe category was separated out in 1950 with three nominees. It dropped to just a winner in 1951, went back to three nominees in 1952 and then was just a winner again through 1955. In 1963 and 1969 the category expanded to eight nominees. Other than that, with two exceptions when it had six nominees, it has been five nominees since 1956.\n\nThere have been 338 nominees but only 328 films. The winners have been interesting in relation to their Globe nominees. From 1955 to 1961 every Actress winner was from a Picture winner. Then from 1962 to 1992 there were more Actress winners from Picture nominees (18) than Picture winners (10) and non-Picture noms (5) combined. Then from 1993 to 2005 every Actress winner either came from a Picture winner (6) or a non-Picture nominee (7). Then it went back to the old ways, with as many Actress winners from Picture nominees since 2005 (7) as Picture winners (4) and non-Picture nominees (3) combined.\n\nThis is not a category that is well respected among the other awards groups. A whopping 23 winners in this category failed to even earn an Oscar nomination and 15 of those performances failed to earn any other Consensus points (most recently Renee Zellweger in 2000). Only 14 winners have gone on to win the Oscar (usually two a decade). Even worse, only 8 winning performances went on to win the Consensus Award and only two since 1986 (Reese Witherspoon in 2005, Meryl Streep in 2009).\n\nFive Best Performances Nominated by the Globes but not the Oscars\n\nSally Hawkins (Happy-Go-Lucky)\n\nRenee Zellweger (Nurse Betty)\n\nNicole Kidman (To Die For)\n\nJamie Lee Curtis (A Fish Called Wanda)\n\nMeg Ryan (When Harry Met Sally…)\n\nFive Best Films Nominated for Actress but Nothing Else\n\nTo Die For\n\nChasing Amy\n\nNurse Betty\n\nBroadway Danny Rose\n\nLa Vie en Rose\n\nBest Picture – Comedy / Musical and Best Actress Comedy / Musical:\n\nWon Both: 28\n\nWon Both, also won Actor: 10\n\nWon Both, no Actor nomination: 12\n\nWon Picture, Actress nomination: 13\n\nWon Picture, no Actress nomination: 33\n\nWon Actress but No other Nominations:\n\nToo Young to Kiss (1951)\n\nCall Me Madam (1953)\n\nMe Natalie (1969)\n\nWhat’s Love Got to Do With It (1993)\n\nTrue Lies (1994)\n\nTo Die For (1995)\n\nTumbleweeds (1999)\n\nNurse Betty (2000)\n\nBeing Julia (2004)\n\nLa Vie en Rose (2007)\n\nnote: Only Marion Cotillard (La Vie en Rose) went on to win the Oscar.\n\nYears in Which All the Actress – Comedy Nominees Came from Picture Nominees:\n\n1960\n\n1961\n\n1962\n\nnote: Know what those years have in common? They had Comedy and Musical split into two Picture awards but one acting award which gave more films the chance to earn Picture noms.\n\nNominees I Haven’t Seen\n\n1969: Kim Darby (Generation)\n\nnote: This kills me. The only other films I am missing are three Foreign Film nominees that have just a combined 56 votes on the IMDb. This one is also rarely seen (less than 100 votes on the IMDb) but it is the only English language Golden Globe nominee I have never seen.\n\nOddities\n\n1950: Judy Holliday wins the Comedy award and loses the Drama award for the same performance (Born Yesterday)\n\n1957: For the first time, none of the Globe nominees earn any other Consensus points.\n\n1960: Shirley MacLaine (The Apartment) becomes the first Globe winner to win the BAFTA.\n\n1961: Rosalind Russell (A Majority of One) wins the Globe but earns no other Consensus points while two losers, Audrey Hepburn (Breakfast at Tiffany’s) and Hayley Mills (The Parent Trap) earn other nominations.\n\n1966: Lynn Redgrave (Georgy Girl) becomes the first Globe winner to win any critics award (NYFC).\n\n1969: Patty Duke (Me Natalie) wins the Globe but earns no other Consensus points while two losers, Mia Farrow (John and Mary) and Barbra Streisand (Hello Dolly) earn BAFTA noms.\n\n1972: Liza Minnelli (Cabaret) becomes the first Globe winner to win the Oscar and the BAFTA.\n\n1973: Liv Ullmann loses the Globe but win the Consensus because her Globe performance is for 40 Carats while her other points are for Cries and Whispers.\n\n1977: Diane Keaton not only shatters all records for noms (7), wins (6) and points (395) for a Globe winner (Annie Hall) but also earns a Drama nom (Looking for Mr. Goodbar).\n\n1987: Holly Hunter (Broadcast News) loses to Cher (Moonstruck) and loses to Cher again at the Oscars but actually wins the Consensus Award.\n\n1995: Nicole Kidman sets the Consensus points high for a Globe winner to fail to earn an Oscar nom (To Die For).\n\n1996: Frances McDormand (Fargo) loses to Madonna (Evita). Fran wins the Oscar and the Consensus while Madonna fails to earn any other Consensus points.\n\n2008: Sally Hawkins breaks Kidman’s record (Happy-Go-Lucky).\n\n2009: Meryl Streep wins the Globe (Julie and Julia) and earns a second nom (It’s Complicated) helping seal her Consensus win. She wins the Globe over Sandra Bullock (The Proposal) while Bullock wins the Drama award and the Oscar for The Blind Side.\n\n2014: Julianne Moore repeats the 1973 oddity by earning a Globe loss (Maps to the Stars) while winning the Oscar and the Consensus for Still Alice.\n\nYears in Which None of the Globe Nominees Earned any other Consensus Points:\n\n1957\n\n1962\n\n1971\n\n1981\n\nThe Biggest Directors:\n\nWoody Allen: 7 noms, 1 win\n\nGeorge Cukor: 5 films, 6 noms, 2 wins\n\nBlake Edwards: 6 noms, 1 win\n\nHerbert Ross: 5 noms, 3 wins\n\nBilly Wilder: 5 noms, 3 wins\n\nRob Marshall: 4 films, 5 noms, 1 win\n\nnote: Four of the performances directed by Allen were from films not nominated for any other award (Broadway Danny Rose, Alice, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Small Time Crooks).\n\nMultiple Nominations:\n\nLes Girls (1957) (won)\n\nGypsy (1962) (won)\n\nCome Blow Your Horn (1963)\n\nShampoo (1975)\n\nFreaky Friday (1976)\n\nChicago (2002) (won)\n\nThe Kids are All Right (2010) (won)\n\nCarnage (2011)\n\nTrivia:\n\nOf the Top 9 Comedy films (in terms of Points), all were nominated for Actress and all but Gigi won the award while two of them weren’t nominated for Actor (Cabaret, Shakespeare in Love). The top film for Points without a nomination for Actress is Sideways.\n\nSince 1969, only seven films have won Picture with an Actress nomination (three of which were in a row: 2006-2008). Either the Picture winner wins Actress (18 times) or isn’t even nominated for Actress (25 times). In the 70’s, 90’s and 10’s, at least six Picture winners didn’t have an Actress nomination at all.\n\nOnly three films have won Picture, Director and Actress (The Graduate, Prizzi’s Honor, La La Land) and only one of those (the last) won Screenplay.\n\nThere have been two ties and they were in consecutive years: 1977 (Goodbye Girl, Annie Hall) and 1978 (California Suite, Same Time Next Year).\n\nTwo foreign language performances have won the award though three films have won the award and been nominated for Foreign Film. That’s because while La Vie en Rose wasn’t nominated for Foreign Film, Georgy Girl and Educating Rita, as English language films, were. The Farewell is the only Foreign language film to win Actress and earn a Foreign Film nomination. The only other Foreign language performance is Sophia Loren in Marriage Italian Style (which wins Foreign Film but loses Actress).\n\nTwo films have won Picture, Actress and Supporting Actress. The first, Working Girl, wasn’t nominated in either male acting category. The second, American Hustle, was nominated in both.\n\nThere have been 13 actresses who were nominated in both Drama and Comedy in the same year. Judy Holliday was nominated for both for the same film. Of the other 12, nine went on to earn Oscar nominations. Of those, only four (Diane Keaton – Annie Hall; Marsha Mason – Chapter Two; Jill Clayburgh – Starting Over; Nicole Kidman – Moulin Rouge) earned their Oscar nominations for the Comedy and Mason and Clayburgh were actually in the same year.\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nStarted in 1943 along with everything else. Was just a winner until 1949 but had some inconsistent nominations through 1952 before being just a winner again until 1955. Since then, with the exception of 1962 (10 noms) and 1963 (7 noms), has mostly been five nominees (8 times it had six noms). There has been one tie (1979 – Melvyn Douglas in Being There and Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now).\n\nThere have been 353 nominees but only 339 films. Six films have won the Globe and earned a second nom, five from 1966 to 1982 and then Django Unchained.\n\nFive Best Performances Nominated by the Globes but not the Oscars\n\nDennis Hopper (Blue Velvet)\n\nBill Murray (Rushmore)\n\nSteve Buscemi (Ghost World)\n\nDonald Sutherland (Without Limits)\n\nPeter Sellers (Lolita)\n\nFive Best Films Nominated for Supporting Actor but Nothing Else\n\nThe Usual Suspects\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nBridge of Spies\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nFull Metal Jacket\n\nBest Picture Winners that Won Best Supporting Actor\n\nDrama: 12\n\nComedy: 7\n\nWon Supporting Actor but No other Nominations:\n\nA Medal for Benny (1945)\n\nMister 880 (1950)\n\nMy Six Convicts (1952)\n\nThe Barefoot Contessa (1954)\n\nTrial (1955)\n\nThe Big Country (1958)\n\nExodus (1960)\n\nThe Spy Who Came in From the Cold (1965)\n\nThe Paper Chase (1973)\n\nTucker: The Man and His Dream (1988)\n\nLongtime Companion (1990)\n\n12 Monkeys (1995)\n\nPrimal Fear (1996)\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\n\nBeginners (2011)\n\nWhiplash (2014)\n\nCreed (2015)\n\nnote: Of these 17 performances only six of them (54, 58, 73, 08, 11, 14) went on to win the Oscar.\n\nThe Biggest Directors:\n\nQuentin Tarantino: 5 films, 6 noms, 3 wins\n\nSidney Lumet: 6 films, 7 noms, 1 win\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola: 5 films, 5 noms, 2 wins\n\nMike Nichols: 5 films, 5 noms, 1 win\n\nSteven Spielberg: 6 films, 6 noms\n\nMartin Scorsese: 4 films, 6 noms\n\nClint Eastwood: 4 films, 4 noms, 2 wins\n\nnote: All 5 of those Nichols films were also nominated for Supporting Actress.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe Picture-Supporting Actor winner combos are strange. It has gone in waves: four times in Drama from 59 to 63, five times from 78 to 86, each of the last three years (one Drama then two Comedy).\n\nFive films have won Picture, Director and Supporting Actor. Five films have won Picture, Screenplay and Supporting Actor (including each of the last three years). Nine films have won Picture, Director and Screenplay with a Supporting Actor nomination. No film has won all four.\n\nAfter a gap of 25 years (1977 to 2002), three films won both supporting awards in the space of just five years (Adaptation, Closer, Dreamgirls).\n\nCabaret is the only film to win Supporting Actor and Actress – Comedy.\n\nNo foreign language performance has ever been nominated in this category. The only overlap with Best Foreign Film is with English language performances.\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nStarted in 1943 along with everything else. Was just a winner until 1949 (two nominees), expanded in 1950 (three nominees), contracted back to just being a winner from 1953 to 1955 and then went to the standard five nominees in 1956. Except for 1962 (10 nominees) and 1963 (8 nominees), it has generally been five nominees with the occasional sixth nominee (9 times, most recently in 2001) with it going all the way to 7 nominees once (1984). There has been one tie (1970 – Helen Hayes for Airport and Karen Black for Five Easy Pieces).\n\nThere have been 359 nominees (more than Supporting Actor) but only 337 films (fewer than Supporting Actor). That includes Nashville (four nominations but no win) and eight films that have won the Globe and earned an additional nomination (Bad Seed, Imitation of Life, Voyage of the Damned, Kramer vs Kramer, Only When I Laugh, Almost Famous, Fighter, Help).\n\nFive Best Performances Nominated by the Globes but not the Oscars\n\nSigourney Weaver (The Ice Storm)\n\nShirley MacLaine (Being There)\n\nCameron Diaz (Vanilla Sky)\n\nCourtney Love (The People vs. Larry Flynt)\n\nCameron Diaz (Being John Malkovich)\n\nFive Best Films Nominated for Supporting Actress but Nothing Else\n\nThe Ice Storm\n\nPsycho\n\nBullets over Broadway\n\nGone Baby Gone\n\nAmerican Splendor\n\nBest Picture Winners that Won Best Supporting Actress\n\nDrama: 7\n\nComedy: 9\n\nWon Supporting Actress but No other Nominations:\n\nMrs. Parkington (1944)\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray (1945)\n\nI Remember Mama (1948)\n\nMogambo (1953)\n\nThe High and the Mighty (1954)\n\nThe Bad Seed (1956) *\n\nImitation of Life (1959) *\n\nPsycho (1960)\n\nThe V.I.P.s (1963)\n\nHush Hush Sweet Charlotte (1964)\n\nOnce is Not Enough (1975)\n\nBullets over Broadway (1994)\n\nMighty Aphrodite (1995)\n\nGirl Interrupted (1999)\n\nI’m Not There (2007)\n\nnote: The two films with an asterisk actually earned a second nomination but it was also for Supporting Actress.\n\nnote: Oddly, a lot of these films earned multiple nominations in this category at the Oscars (six of them in fact).\n\nnote: Of these 15 performances only four of them (63, 94, 95, 99) went on to win the Oscar.\n\nThe Biggest Directors:\n\nMike Nichols: 8 films, 8 noms, 4 wins\n\nWoody Allen: 9 films, 9 noms, 2 wins\n\nRobert Altman: 6 films, 10 noms\n\nMartin Scorsese: 9 films, 9 noms, 1 win\n\nElia Kazan: 5 films, 5 noms, 2 wins\n\nNorman Jewison: 4 films, 5 noms, 2 wins\n\nAlexander Payne: 5 films, 5 noms\n\nTrivia:\n\nIn the space of four years, Woody Allen had three films nominated for Supporting Actress and nothing else (Husbands and Wives, Bullets over Broadway, Mighty Aphrodite) and the last two won the award.\n\nNashville had a whopping four nominations in 1975 (Ronee Blakley, Geraldine Chaplin, Barbara Harris, Lily Tomlin).\n\nThe Exorcist is the only Picture-Director-Screenplay winner to also win Supporting Actress. It only won one of those at the Oscars (Screenplay).\n\nSince 1979 only two films have won Picture – Drama and Supporting Actress: A Beautiful Mind and Boyhood. In that time six Comedies have done that.\n\nOnly five films have won Supporting Actress and Director and only one (Boyhood) since 1973.\n\nAfter a gap of 25 years (1977 to 2002), three films won both supporting awards in the space of just five years (Adaptation, Closer, Dreamgirls).\n\nNo film has won both Supporting Actress and Score since 1984.\n\nWorking Girl is the only film to win both Supporting Actress and Song.\n\nDay for Night is the only actual foreign language film to earn a Supporting Actress nomination. The other four films to earn noms in both categories were all English language films.\n\nBest Score\n\nStarted in 1947, added nominees in 1949, stopped after 1952, revived with just a winner from 1959 to 1962, brought back as a full category in 1964. For a long time (through 1989), the Score winner often lost Picture. Of those first 35 winners, 10 won Best Picture and 10 weren’t nominated while the remaining 15 lost Picture. However, that trend ended in 1989. From 1990 to 2011, of the 22 winners, only two lost Picture (Aladdin, Truman Show). Of the other 20, 8 weren’t nominated and the other 12 all won Picture. That trend has gone back to the old ways lately (of the last eight winners, four lost Picture, one won Picture (La La Land) and the other three weren’t nominated).\n\nFive Best Scores Nominated by the Globes but not the Oscars\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans (Randy Edelman / Trevor Jones)\n\nGlory (James Horner)\n\nThe Da Vinci Code (Hans Zimmer)\n\nThe Last Temptation of Christ (Peter Gabriel)\n\nTop Gun (Harold Faltermeyer)\n\nFive Best Films Nominated for Score but Nothing Else:\n\nAlien\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\nEyes Wide Shut\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans\n\nAnna Karenina\n\nBest Picture Winners that Won Best Score\n\nDrama: 17\n\nComedy: 6\n\nWon Score but No other Nominations:\n\nLife with Father (1947)\n\nThe Red Shoes (1948)\n\nThe Inspector General (1949)\n\nSeptember Affair (1951)\n\nThe Alamo (1960)\n\nThe Fall of the Roman Empire (1961)\n\nHeaven and Earth (1993)\n\nA Walk in the Clouds (1995)\n\nThe Legend of 1900 (1999)\n\nThe Painted Veil (2006)\n\nnote: It’s interesting to note that three of those last four films didn’t have any other nominations for Score from any other group.\n\nScore and Song\n\nNominated for Both: 60\n\nWon Score only: 5\n\nWon Song only: 10\n\nWon both: 10\n\nnote: Oddly, the only three films to win Score and Song and not win another award all earned a second Song nomination (Flashdance, Little Mermaid, Aladdin).\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe only foreign language film to win Score is The Legend of 1900.\n\nThe only film to win Score and Foreign Film was an English language film: A Passage to India.\n\nThe only film to win Score and Animated Film is Up though Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and Lion King all won Score before the Animated Film category existed.\n\nThe only films with more than two nominations to win all of their nominations including Score are Doctor Zhivago, A Star is Born, Return of the King, Slumdog Millionaire and La La Land.\n\nSeven directors have had two films win Score. No director has had three.\n\nSpielberg leads with 11 films nominated for Score.\n\nBest Song\n\nStarted in 1961 and made permanent in 1964. More info can be found here. It was dominated by Musicals early on (winners in 1967, 1970, 1975-1980, 1983, 1987). But, starting with The Little Mermaid, this became the Disney Animated award (1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1999) though Musicals now dominate again (2016-2019).\n\nFive Best Songs Nominated by the Globes but not the Oscars\n\n“Thief of Your Heart” (In the Name of the Father, 1993)\n\n“Stay (Faraway, So Close)” (Faraway, So Close, 1993)\n\n“The Flame Still Burns” (Still Crazy, 1998)\n\n“The Rose” (The Rose, 1979)\n\n“Uninvited” (City of Angels, 1998)\n\nBest Picture Winners that Won Best Song:\n\nDrama: 3\n\nComedy: 7\n\nFilms Just Nominated For Best Song:\n\n113 Films\n\n15 winners\n\n7 Bond films\n\n4 Disney Animated films\n\n3 Hunger Games films\n\n1 film nominated twice but didn’t win (Anastasia)\n\nFive Best Films Nominated for Song but Nothing Else:\n\nSkyfall\n\nThe Muppet Movie\n\nShrek 2\n\nFrom Russia with Love\n\nSPECTRE\n\nTrivia:\n\nSam Mendes: the only director to twice have a film win Best Song with no other nominations (Skyfall, SPECTRE)\n\nAladdin: most points for Best Song (win, two other nominations)\n\nAvatar: the only Best Picture (Drama) winner to lose Best Song\n\nFlashdance, Burlesque: the only live action films to win Song and earn a second nomination\n\nCabaret: the only Best Picture winner to have two nominations for Best Song and lose them both\n\nKids Films in Best Song\n\nWins: 9\n\nNominations: 45\n\nFilms with Multiple Nominations: 5\n\nnon-Disney Wins: 3\n\nnon-Disney Nominations: 20\n\nNon-Disney Films with Multiple Nominations: 1 (Anastasia)\n\nFilms that won Song and Animated Film: 1 (Happy Feet)\n\nBest Animated Film\n\nCreated in 2006 around the same time that other groups (PGA, BAFTA) were also creating a separate Animated Film award though several years after the Oscars. Dominated by Disney which won, either through its own films (2) or Pixar (8) won 10 of the first 12 awards in the category. Also dominated by Kids films.\n\nAverage Domestic Gross of Winner:\n\nDisney Films: $292,782,303\n\nnon-Disney Films: $115,371,401\n\nnote: This is what really makes Missing Link an oddity for the Globes. It made $16.64 million at the box office. The previous low winner was Tintin with $77 mil and that was the only other winner below $175 mil.\n\nnote: No Disney winner has made less than $200 million.

In 1949 it went to Bicycle Thieves with a nomination for Fallen Idol. Then it was dropped until 1954. Starting in 1954, it came back with a vengeance.\n\nThat year, there were four films that shared a win for the category and the same happened in 1955. The next year it expanded with five films sharing the win and a separate film (Richard III) winning the “English Language Foreign Film” award. Through 1960, the Globes would continue to give awards to multiple films while occasionally giving an English Language award. That changed in 1961 (just one winner) but was back in 1962 (two winners). In 1963, things settled down with full nominees for both Foreign categories and just one winner each. In 1964 there was a blip (just two Foreign nominee, one winner in EL) but from 1965 to 1972, there were full roles of nominees in both categories.\n\nFinally, in 1973, the Globes dropped this nightmare and went to a single category. But that didn’t mean they dropped British films (or Australian) as being “Foreign”. From 1980 to 1982 every winner was British (Tess, Chariots of Fire, Gandhi) which also meant that all of them were ineligible for the Best Picture – Drama award. That wouldn’t change until 1987 when they changed the name from Best Foreign Film to Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nOn the other hand, at least the Globes aren’t fenced in by the eligibility and submission requirements of the Academy. So films like Scenes from a Marriage, La Cage Aux Folles and Europa Europa have won the award. What’s more, in a year like 2019, they could nominate both A Portrait of a Lady on Fire and Les Miserables. They also embrace all films regardless of country now if they aren’t in English so Letters from Iwo Jima managed to win the award in spite of being an American film.\n\nMost Nominations by Director:\n\nIngmar Bergman – 9\n\nPedro Almodovar – 8\n\nFederico Fellini – 5\n\nAkira Kurosawa – 5\n\nFrancois Truffaut – 5\n\nZhang Yimou – 5\n\nMost Wins by Director:\n\nIngmar Bergman – 6\n\nVittorio de Sica – 3\n\nRichard Attenborough – 3\n\nClaude Lelouch – 3\n\nNominated for Foreign Film and Director: 19\n\nWon Foreign Film and Director: 4\n\nMost Wins by Studio:\n\nSony Pictures Classics – 15\n\nUnited Artists – 7\n\nWarner Bros – 7\n\nAVCO Embassy / Embassy Pictures – 6\n\nColumbia – 6\n\nMiramax – 5\n\nnote: Of Columbia’s six wins, five were English Language.\n\nnote: SPC’s wins were in two dominating waves: 7 wins from 1992 to 2002 including four in a row from 97-00 and 8 wins from 2008 to 2016: five in a row from 08-12 and three in a row from 14-16.\n\nSPC has had at least one nominee every year since 2002 and at 41 nominations has close to twice as many as any other studio.\n\nNominated for Director but lost Foreign Film\n\nAtlantic City\n\nThe Dresser\n\nnote: Both films lost Foreign Film to another film nominated for Director (Chariots of Fire, Fanny & Alexander).\n\nEnglish Language Foreign Films that won Best Picture at the Oscars:\n\nHamlet\n\nTom Jones\n\nChariots of Fire\n\nGandhi\n\nNominees I Haven’t Seen:\n\nEyes of Children (1955)\n\nImpossible on Saturday (1966)\n\nTraveller (1970)\n\nnote: It’s not just me who hasn’t seen these three films.
