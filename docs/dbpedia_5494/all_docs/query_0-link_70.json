After attracting attention for his likable role as Jennifer Garner's reporter friend on \"Alias\" (ABC, 2001-06), Cooper fearlessly made his first major big screen impression as the unlikable groom in \"Wedding Crashers\" (2005). He regained audience's affection in lesser fare like \"Failure to Launch\" (2006) and, in testament to his charisma, emerged unscathed from Sandra Bullock's notorious bomb \"All About Steve\" (2008). Cooper ensured his own launch with the lead in the critical and box office juggernaut \"The Hangover\" (2009) and proved an invaluable member of the romantic, dramatic ensemble \"He's Just Not That Into You\" (2009) and \"Valentine's Day\" (2010) casts. Graduating to full-fledged stardom with a flashy role in \"The A-Team\" (2010), Cooper continued to rise as a bankable, talented and very much in-demand movie star, which was confirmed with a return to box-office prominence with \"The Hangover Part II\" (2011) and his star turn in David O. Russell's \"Silver Linings Playbook\" (2012) opposite Jennifer Lawrence. That trio reunited twice more for \"American Hustle\" (2013) and \"Joy\" (2015), while Cooper continued starring in films ranging from Clint Eastwood's drama \"American Sniper\" (2014) to James Gunn's blockbuster action-comedy \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (2014) and its 2017 sequel, in which he provided the voice of Rocket, a raccoon-like mutant with serious anger management issues. Whether starring in comedies, thrillers or romantic dramas - as well as making a tabloid splash in the wake of rumored romances with some of Hollywood's loveliest leading ladies - Cooper propelled himself into becoming one of Hollywood's most bankable stars.\n\nCOLMAN DOMINGO in Rustin Colman Jason Domingo (born November 28, 1969) is an American actor. Prominent on both screen and stage, he has received various accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award and nominations for an Academy Award and two Tony Awards. Domingo's early Broadway roles include the 2005 play Well and the 2008 musical Passing Strange. He gained acclaim for his role as Mr. Bones in the Broadway musical The Scottsboro Boys (2011), for which he received a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical nomination. He reprised the role in the 2014 West End production, receiving a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical nomination. In 2018, he wrote the book for the Broadway musical Summer: The Donna Summer Musical. After early roles in various incarnations of the Law & Order series and as part of the main cast for The Big Gay Sketch Show, he had his breakthrough playing Victor Strand in the AMC series Fear the Walking Dead (2015–2023). In 2022, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as the recovering drug addict Ali on the HBO series Euphoria. Domingo's film appearances include supporting roles in Lincoln (2012), Selma (2014), If Beale Street Could Talk (2018), and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020). For his role as a ruthless pimp in Janicza Bravo's Zola (2021), he received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male nomination. His portrayal of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in the Netflix film Rustin (2023) earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nPAUL GIAMATTI in The HoldoversPrior to becoming one of the more unlikely leading men in Hollywood, actor Paul Giamatti made a career out of playing comic foils and repressed loners constantly on the verge of exploding with rage. Giamatti first grabbed the public's attention with his vitriolic performance as Kenny - a.k.a. Pig Vomit - Howard Stern's nemesis in \"Private Parts\" (1997), before quickly developing into the go-to guy for a director looking for an everyman-type actor who could convincingly project simmering intensity. His sour yet endearing performance as bitter comic book writer Harvey Pekar in the offbeat biopic, \"American Splendor\" (2003) did much to put him on the mainstream moviegoer's radar. But it was with his highly-lauded performance in the surprise hit \"Sideways\" (2004), that Giamatti vaulted to the A-list as a kind of unlikely leading man, a leap that made the comfortable character actor a bit unsettled. With award-worthy performances in \"John Adams\" (HBO, 2008) and \"Barney's Version\" (2010), Giamatti became one of those rare actors capable of excelling in both leading and supporting roles, allowing him the freedom to oscillate between big budget fare and small indie films, while developing a reputation as one of the most mesmerizing performers of his time.Content expanded.\n\nCILLIAN MURPHY in OppenheimerAfter cutting his teeth creatively as an amateur musician and later dropping out of law school, Irish-born Cillian Murphy segued into acting with an attention-grabbing performance in the stark, two-character stage drama \"Disco Pigs.\" The surprise hit transformed Murphy's life, leading him on an almost two-year tour across Europe, Canada and Australia. He eventually landed his first film roles, mainly in British-made independents, before finally achieving international stardom with director Danny Boyle's post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, \"28 Days Later\" (2002), which soon opened the doors to Hollywood. Following a small role in the Oscar-nominated \"Cold Mountain\" (2003), Murphy proved an able villain as the menacing Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan's \"Batman Begins\" (2005) and a terrifying flight companion in the thriller \"Red Eye\" (2005). Though he drifted back into more independent-minded movies like Neil Jordan's \"Breakfast on Pluto\" (2005), Boyle's small-scale sci-fi adventure \"Sunshine\" (2007) and Sally Potter's comedy \"The Party\" (2017), Murphy was equally comfortable appearing in high-profile Hollywood films like Ron Howard's whaling drama \"In the Heart of the Sea\" (2015) and Nolan's World War II drama \"Dunkirk\" (2017).\n\nJEFFREY WRIGHT in American FictionAfter developing a prolific and acclaimed career on the stage, actor Jeffrey Wright quietly worked his way into the public consciousness in chameleon-like fashion, playing a wide range of roles in features and on television. Though he spent several years honing his craft off-Broadway and in regional theater, Wright staked his reputation with a Tony Award-winning performance in the widely acclaimed play, \"Angels in America: Perestroika,\" which he later reprised almost a decade later in the highly lauded HBO miniseries. In between the play and the six-part movie, Wright built a resume that included deft performances as such divergent historical figures as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Jean-Michel Basquiat, as well as an array of strong supporting roles in Woody Allen's \"Celebrity\" (1998) and \"Shaft\" (2000). After earning an Emmy for \"Angels in America,\" Wright had finally broken through to the mainstream, earning meatier parts in \"Syriana\" (2005), \"Casino Royale\" (2006) and \"W\" (2008). The versatile actor continued to genre hop, jumping from the musical biopic \"Cadillac Records\" (2008) to the sci-fi thriller \"Source Code\" (2011) to the prescient political drama \"The Ides of March\" (2011) with impressive ease. During this period, he also gained mainstream success in the blockbuster \"The Hunger Games\" franchise, Pixar hit \"The Good Dinosaur\" (2015) and science-fiction cable drama \"Westworld\" (HBO 2016- ). While not the marquee draw of some of his contemporaries, Wright could always be counted upon to deliver a performance on par with the very best.

Early in her movie career, she made an impression as a wise-beyond-her-years sex kitten in \"The Grifters\" (1990) before exploding onto the scene as sultry mob moll, Virginia Hill, in the biopic, \"Bugsy\" (1991). And though she never lost that sly, brainy, sex appeal, she became more often associated with complex, professional women on the verge of self-destruction in darkly humorous dramas like \"American Beauty\" (1999), \"Being Julia\" (2004) and \"Running with Scissors\" (2006). The A-list leading actress managed to maintain a solid output of well-received films by limiting herself to just one carefully chosen project per year, and retreating for extended periods into her very private family life with actor and director Warren Beatty and the couple's four children. The formula would prove to be successful, with critically lauded performances in select films like \"The Kids Are All Right\" (2010) and Beatty's longtime passion project \"Rules Don't Apply\" (2016), reminding critics and audiences alike that the supremely talented Ms. Bening was an actor still very much in demand and at the top of her game.\n\nLILY GLADSTONE in Killers of the Flower Moon Lily Gladstone (born August 2, 1986) is an American actress. Raised on the Blackfeet Reservation in Browning, Montana and Seattle, Gladstone is of Piegan Blackfeet, Nez Perce, and European heritage. She[a] earned critical acclaim for portraying Mollie Kyle, an Osage woman who survived the Osage Indian murders, in Martin Scorsese's crime drama film Killers of the Flower Moon (2023), receiving several accolades. She became the first Native American to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She made her film debut in Jimmy P: Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian (2012), and collaborated with filmmaker Kelly Reichardt on the independent films Certain Women (2016) and First Cow (2019). She also appeared in episodes of HBO's Room 104 (2017–2020), Showtime's Billions (2016–2023), and FX's Reservation Dogs (2021–2023).\n\nSANDRA HÜLLER in Anatomy of a Fall Sandra Hüller (born 30 April 1978) is a German actress. She has appeared in German, Austrian, American, British and French films. She gained international recognition in 2023 for her starring roles in Jonathan Glazer's Holocaust drama The Zone of Interest and Justine Triet's legal drama Anatomy of a Fall. Her performances in them earned her two BAFTA Film Award nominations, while the latter won her a European Film Award for Best Actress and a César Award for Best Actress, in addition to nominations for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Hüller has played Anneliese Michel in Hans-Christian Schmid's 2006 drama Requiem, for which she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress, and a troubled daughter in Maren Ade's 2016 comedy Toni Erdmann, for which she won her first European Film Award for Best Actress. She portrayed Irma Sztáray in Frauke Finsterwalder's 2023 historical black comedy Sisi & I.\n\nCAREY MULLIGAN in Maestro As a relative newcomer, British actress Carey Mulligan took Hollywood by storm as the sublimely exuberant Jenny in the feature film, \"An Education\" (2009). The incandescent actress gave a seemingly effortless portrayal of a young girl who falls for a charming, more experienced man in the film that made her a bona fide movie star and, according to critics, a strong contender for an Oscar nomination. The fresh-faced ingénue was suddenly flooded with plum movie roles that billed her opposite established actors like Ryan Gosling in \"Drive\" (2011) and Keira Knightley in \"Never Let Me Go\" (2010). Soon she was headlining compelling films such as Steve McQueen's penetrating \"Shame\" (2011), Baz Luhrmann's lavish \"The Great Gatsby\" (2013) and the Thomas Hardy adaptation \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" (2015). While it was a coming-of-age film that kicked Mulligan's career into high gear, it was the actress' penetrating performances both on the big screen and on Broadway that cemented her place as a serious actress worthy of being called \"the next Audrey Hepburn.\"\n\nEMMA STONE in Poor ThingsAmerican actress Emma Stone broke out of her early teen comedy roles to become one of the most celebrated actors of her generation. A native of Scottsdale, Arizona, she began acting as a child in local theater productions around Phoenix. She moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to pursue acting full time and was cast as Laurie Partridge in \"The New Partridge Family\" (VH1, 2004), a failed reboot of the popular 1970s show. Guest roles in TV series such as \"Malcolm in the Middle\" (Fox, 2000-06) and \"Medium\" (NBC, 2005-11) followed before a supporting role in a raunchy comedy put her on the map. Playing cool girl Jules opposite Michael Cera and Jonah Hill in \"Superbad\" (2007), the actress made a strong impression with the relatively small role. She was soon cast as one of the leads in the short-lived action series \"Drive\" (Fox, 2007). The film roles started becoming bigger, including starring opposite Anna Faris in \"The House Bunny\" (2008) and joining Woody Harrelson, Abigail Breslin, and Jesse Eisenberg in the surprise hit \"Zombieland\" (2009) as post-apocalyptic con artist Wichita. The actress stepped up to carrying a film when she starred in Will Gluck's teen comedy \"Easy A\" (2010), playing a high school girl caught up in a series of rumors run rampant. After supporting roles in \"Crazy, Stupid Love\" (2011) and \"Friends With Benefits\" (2011), she jumped into prestige fare with a starring role in \"The Help\" (2011) as aspiring writer Skeeter Phelan. The film was a critical and commercial success and put Stone on a new, more adult, trajectory. The actress joined a long list of Woody Allen muses when she starred in the director's \"Magic in the Moonlight\" (2014) and \"Irrational Man\" (2015). She also became part of the popular superhero genre with her role as Gwen Stacy in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" (2012) and \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" (2014) with Andrew Garfield playing the web-slinger. The actress earned her first Academy Award nomination with her role as Michael Keaton's disaffected daughter in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Oscar-winner \"Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" (2014). Her role opposite Ryan Gosling, her costar in \"Crazy, Stupid Love,\" in Damien Chazelle's acclaimed musical \"La La Land\" (2016) cemented her status as an A-list actress. Displaying her musical talents as aspiring actress Mia, she won the Oscar for Best Actress. She continued her strong run, earning critical acclaim for playing real-life tennis star and LGBTQ icon Billie Jean King in \"Battle of the Sexes\" (2017) with Steve Carell. She next joined Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz in the period drama \"The Favourite\" (2018). Her role as scheming lady-in-waiting Abigail Masham scored the actress another Oscar nomination. Despite the critical acclaim, Stone gained a reputation for not taking herself too seriously, making self-effacing appearances on talk shows and the sketch comedy mainstay \"Saturday Night Live\" (NBC, 1975- ). In between film roles, she joined former co-star Jonah Hill for the drama series \"Maniac\" (Netflix, 2018), playing a troubled young woman participating in an experimental drug trial. She returned to one of her earliest successes when she reteamed with Eisenberg, Breslin, and Harrelson for the sequel \"Zombieland: Double Tap\" (2019). That same year, it was announced that Stone would star in \"Cruella\" (2021), a live action continuation of the story of Disney villain Cruella de Vil.Content expanded.\n\nBRENDAN GLEESON\n\nROBERT DE NIRO\n\nROBERT DOWNEY JR.\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nIN A SUPPORTING ROLE\n\nRYAN GOSLING\n\nMARK RUFFALO\n\nAMERICAN FICTION\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nOppenheimer\n\nBarbie\n\nPoor Things\n\nFind out more: Click on picture\n\nSTERLING K. BROWN in American Fiction Though Sterling K. Brown was known to audiences everywhere for his acclaimed role on the TV series \"This is Us\" (NBC, 2016-), his path toward acting as a career was not always clear. Born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1976, Brown was primarily interested in sports like basketball and football, but after appearing in a school production of the musical \"Godspell,\" Brown discovered that he harbored a deep love of acting. Even still, he first enrolled at Stanford University as an economics major, performing in college plays on the side purely as a hobby-but only until he was forced to admit that performing was his true passion. While studying there his freshman year, Brown also met and began a relationship with fellow actor Ryan Michelle Bathe, whom he would later marry in 2007. Brown went on to earn an MFA from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, and began acting in regional theater productions to hone his skills. In 2002, he made his film debut with a small role in the romantic comedy \"Brown Sugar\" (2002). He played a recurring role on the drama \"Third Watch\" (NBC, 1999-2005) and continued to book small roles in films like \"Trust the Man\" (2005) and \"Stay\" (2005) before he landed a starring role on the drama series \"Army Wives\" (Lifetime, 2007-2013) in 2007. The show has a loyal fanbase, and Brown stuck with it for all of its seven seasons. When the series eventually wrapped in 2013, Brown's next big break was looming on the horizon, and it would prove to be a double-whammy. It came in 2016 when he was cast as Christopher Darden on the first season of the hotly anticipated anthology series \"American Crime Story\" (FX, 2016-), \"The People Vs. O.J. Simpson,\" in addition to landing his role as Randall Pearson on \"This is Us.\" The popularity of both shows raised Brown's profile exponentially. Though \"American Crime Story\" moved on to a new story with a new cast for its ensuing seasons, \"This is Us\" became a cultural phenomenon. Brown proved a pivotal an extremely popular presence on the show, but he nonetheless continued to appear in steadily bigger movie productions as well, joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the role of N'Jobu in \"Black Panther\" (2018), co-starring in the futuristic neo-noir \"Hotel Artemis\" (2018), and playing Traeger in the sci-fi action reboot \"The Predator\" (2018).\n\nROBERT DE NIRO in Killers of the Flower Moon One of the most accomplished and respected actors of the 20th century and beyond, Oscar winner Robert De Niro is widely known as an intense and formidable presence, starring in a string of acclaimed films directed by Martin Scorsese, including \"Raging Bull\" (1980) and \"Goodfellas\" (1990), as well as such features as \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974), \"1900\" (1976), \"Heat\" (1995), \"Meet the Parents\" (2000) and \"Silver Linings Playbook\" (2012). Robert Anthony De Niro, Jr. was born on August 17, 1943 in New York's Manhattan borough to artists Robert De Niro, Sr., and Virginia Admiral, who divorced when their son was two years of age. He developed an interest in performing through visits to local movie houses with his father, and soon began acting in school productions while also receiving his earliest training at Maria Picator's Dramatic Workshop, where his mother worked as a typist and copyeditor. De Niro briefly attended the High School of Music and Art but left in the ninth grade, citing a high level of competition and his own shyness. But after a cross-country trip to visit relatives in 1960, the 16-year-old De Niro decided to leave high school altogether and enroll at the Stella Adler Conservatory. After additional training with Lee Strasberg at the Actor's Studio, he began auditioning for film roles. Though he would make his screen acting debut in Brian De Palma's low-budget comedy \"The Wedding Party,\" the film would not be released until 1969, so his uncredited turn the French comedy \"Three Rooms in Manhattan\" (1965) would mark his actual film debut. Three years later, he reunited with De Palma for the bawdy freeform comedy \"Greetings\" (1968), which earned a Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. He bounced between arthouse and drive-in fare for his next few projects, teaming again with De Palma for \"Hi, Mom!\" (1970), a comedy about amateur pornographers, and playing a drug-addicted Depression Era gangster in Roger Corman's \"Bloody Mama\" (1970) before earning critical praise as a terminally ill baseball player in \"Bang the Drum Slowly\" (1973). That same year, he also starred as a dangerously off-kilter hood in \"Mean Streets\" (1973), which marked the beginning of his long and celebrated collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. The film would serve as a launching pad for a remarkable string of projects in the 1970s, beginning in 1974 with \"The Godfather Part II,\" which earned him an Oscar for his performance - entirely in Sicilian - as the young Vito Corleone. Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), which brought a second Oscar nomination for his turn as a psychotic who believed himself to be a criminal avenger, and Bernardo Bertolucci's \"1900\" (1976) soon followed, as did his thinly veiled portrait of studio head Irving Thalberg in Elia Kazan's \"The Last Tycoon\" (1976) and a third Oscar nod for Michael Cimino's harrowing Vietnam War drama \"The Deer Hunter\" (1979). After teaming with Scorsese for the period drama \"New York, New York\" (1977), the duo reunited again for \"Raging Bull\" (1980), a elegiac portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta; De Niro, who gained 60 pounds to portray LaMotta in his twilight years, earned a second Oscar for his intensely committed and rigorously physical performance. The dawn of the 1980s saw De Niro working with some of the most acclaimed filmmakers in the world, including the scabrous \"King of Comedy\" (1982) with Scorsese, the epic gangster film \"Once Upon a Time in America\" for Sergio Leone, the fantasy \"Brazil\" (1984) for Terry Gilliam, and the sweeping period drama \"The Mission\" (1985) for Roland Joffe. He then reunited with De Palma to play a malevolent Al Capone in the director's big-screen take of \"The Untouchables\" (1987) before dipping into mainstream waters as a foul-mouthed skip tracer in Martin Brest's popular action-comedy \"Midnight Run\" (1988). In the '90s, De Niro settled into a breathless schedule of acting roles in both studio and arthouse features. The most notable of these was his turn as an Irish mobster in an Italian crime family in Scorsese's celebrated \"Goodfellas\" (1990), as well as back-to-back Oscar nominations for Penny Marshall's \"Awakenings\" (1991), which cast him as a comatose patient revived by Dr. Oliver Sacks' experimental therapy, and Scorsese's remake of \"Cape Fear\" (1992), with De Niro as a feral criminal pursuing lawyer Nick Nolte's family. Between these efforts were collaborations with Martin Ritt and Jane Fonda in \"Stanley & Iris\" (1990), Ron Howard on the firefighter drama \"Backdraft\" (1991), Bill Murray in John McNaughton's \"Mad Dog and Glory\" (1993), and Kenneth Branagh, who cast him as the Monster in \"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\" (1994). De Niro also found time during this period to make his directorial debut with \"A Bronx Tale\" (1993), a sentimental period piece based on co-star Chazz Palminteri's nostalgic one-man show, and a reunion with Scorsese and frequent co-star Joe Pesci for \"Casino\" (1995), a story of organized crime in Las Vegas. He would cap the decade with several high-quality projects, including a supporting turn for Quentin Tarantino in \"Jackie Brown\" (1997) and a lead in two superlative caper films, John Frankenheimer's \"Ronin\" (1998) and Michael Mann's \"Heat\" (1995). But with the turn of the new millennium, De Niro's screen output appeared to take a decidedly downward turn. Critics and fans of his early work were dismayed to see appear in lackluster comedies like \"Showtime\" (2002) with Eddie Murphy and wan thrillers like \"Godsend\" (2004) and \"Righteous Kill\" (2008) with Al Pacino, and bemoaned the broad comedy \"Meet the Parents\" (2000), which cast him as a spymaster and strict father determined to undermine new son-in-law Ben Stiller, and its sequels \"Meet the Fockers\" (2004) and \"Little Fockers\" (2010). In truth, De Niro's prodigious output during this period also included a number of well-received and popular films, including the thriller \"City by the Sea\" (2002) and a second directorial effort with the espionage drama \"The Good Shepherd\" (2006), as a producer, oversaw the \"Fockers\" films, \"About a Boy\" (2002) and \"Rent\" (2005) through his TriBeCa Productions. But the sheer number of forgettable films in his c.v. during the 2000s undermined - at least in the eyes of some fans and reviewers - his more celebrated titles. For this demographic, De Niro rebounded with solid character turns in three films for David O. Russell: the quirky \"Silver Linings Playbook\" (2012), which earned him a fifth Oscar nomination, his '70s New York drama \"American Hustle\" (2013) and the rags-to-riches comedy \"Joy\" (2015). After a spate of largely unremarkable features, De Niro capped 2019 with major roles in two high-profile features: the Cannes hit \"Joker\" (2019), with Joaquin Phoenix as the DC villain and De Niro as a merciless talk show host, and \"The Irishman\" (2019), a reunion with Scorsese, Pacino and Pesci based on the real-life story of Frank Sheeran, who was allegedly responsible for the disappearance of labor chief Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nROBERT DOWNEY JR. in Oppenheimer Despite Oscar and Golden Globe nominations and the unshakeable respect of film critics and his acting peers, Robert Downey, Jr. insisted that he was not really an actor, just a good hustler who had found a way to make a living. If he did not believe he was acting, it was certainly reflected in his seamless skills, which were full of natural, physical expressiveness. After making himself known as the drug-addicted antihero of \"Less Than Zero\" (1987), Downey delivered an uncanny portrayal of beloved silent film star \"Chaplin\" (1992), which earned him some of the highest praise of his career. But his gift had always been to transform a regular person into a creatively-detailed and thoroughly engrossing star of the show, often complete with memorable quirks. Even in his early roles in teen comedies, Downey stood out above his Brat Pack peers for his spontaneous energy and apparent fearlessness in exposing his very fragile inner workings. Though he made headlines for his manic portrayal of a tabloid TV journalist in \"Natural Born Killers\" (1994) and a gay book editor in \"Wonder Boys\" (2000), Downey unfortunately became more famous for his longtime drug addictions and numerous run-ins with the law. He eventually emerged from almost certain tragedy by attaining sobriety and re-launching his flagging career with a blockbuster starring turn in the hit \"Iron Man\" (2008), while earning laughs as a chameleon-like actor in \"Tropic Thunder\" (2008), which only confirmed that the public loved a good comeback story as well as appreciated Downey's incredibly likeable presence on the big screen. Continuing his role as Iron Man throughout the series of Marvel Cinematic Universe films, including the blockbuster hit \"The Avengers\" (2012) and its sequels, Downey also starred in films ranging from \"Sherlock Holmes\" (2009) to familial legal drama \"The Judge\" (2014). In 2019, he would appear again as Tony Stark in \"Avengers: Endgame,\" reported to be the conclusion to the story of the original Avengers team. He also filmed a starring role in \"The Voyage of Dr. Dolittle\" (2020), and, through his banner Team Downey, was producing a remake of \"Perry Mason\" for HBO.\n\nRYAN GOSLING in Barbie Before becoming one of the most bankable romantic leads of his generation, Ryan Gosling established himself with misfit outsider roles in award-winning independent films like \"The Believer\" (2001), \"Half Nelson\" (2006) and \"Lars and the Real Girl\" (2007), with a believability that could only come from someone who had struggled with unease and dissatisfaction in their own life. Perhaps his awkward professional start in ill-suited endeavors like a stint as a cast member on the \"Mickey Mouse Club\" (Disney Channel, 1988-1995) and the short-lived fantasy series \"Young Hercules\" (Fox, 1998-99) also provided fodder for the disaffected roles the young actor would later craft with such voracity. Turns in higher-profile romantic dramas such as \"The Notebook\" (2004), combined with much publicized relationships with co-stars like Rachel McAdams brought Gosling a certain amount of heartthrob celebrity, although the actor doggedly avoided the \"Hollywood Star\" persona. After a brief absence from the screen in the late 2000s, Gosling reappeared at decade's end with two hard to classify performances - first, in the fact-based murder mystery \"All Good Things\" (2010), then in the romantic drama \"Blue Valentine\" (2010), the latter of which was a small, independent labor of love that earned him critical raves. With his stoic performance as an unnamed antihero in the neo-noir \"Drive\" (2011), Gosling had firmly established himself as one Hollywood's most interesting and unpredictable rising actors. Moving with ease from moody dramas like \"The Place Beyond the Pines\" (2012) and the knockabout comedy of '70s-set action flick \"The Nice Guys\" (2016) to the old-school Hollywood glamour of romantic musical \"La La Land\" (2016) and gritty, philosophical science fiction with \"Blade Runner 2049\" (2017), Ryan Gosling seemingly could do anything and do it brilliantly. Content expanded.\n\nMARK RUFFALO in Poor ThingsLike many other actors who were tagged \"best of a generation,\" Mark Ruffalo's roots were in theater and independent film where his honest, open character approach was applauded. His breakout stage role in Kenneth Lonergan's acclaimed \"This Is Our Youth\" led Lonergan to give Ruffalo the lead in his film directorial debut \"You Can Count on Me\" (2000), which earned countless festival awards and had critics buzzing about the little-known actor's subtle, compelling performance as a cerebral but aimless young adult with an arrest record and a pregnant teenage girlfriend. Hollywood came courting, but struggled with a tidy niche in which to put the darkly handsome actor; first offering him small but effective character roles as \"conflicted\" types in big budget thrillers like \"Collateral\" (2004) before unsuccessfully making the understated actor into a bland leading man in romantic comedies like \"Just Like Heaven\" (2005). Ruffalo eventually found an appropriate arena somewhere between the multiplex and the art house, favored by character-driven directors like Jane Campion, David Fincher, Steven Zaillian and eventually Martin Scorsese - all of whom capitalized on the actor's talent for believably disappearing into complex, empathetic characters.\n\nEMILY BLUNT\n\nDANIELLE BROOKS\n\nAMERICA FERRERA\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nIN A SUPPORTING ROLE\n\nJODIE FOSTER\n\nOppenheimer\n\nTHE COLOR PURPLE\n\nBARBIE\n\nNyad\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nDA'VINE JOY RANDOLPH\n\nFind out more: Click on picture\n\nEMILY BLUNT in Oppenheimer Though virtually unknown to U.S. audiences during the first part of her career, British actress Emily Blunt managed to steal virtually every scene from the likes of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci in her American breakthrough, \"The Devil Wears Prada\" (2006). Blunt's over-the-top performance as Streep's high-strung assistant catapulted her into the international spotlight, steering her career away from prior British period television pieces and towards memorable supporting roles in \"The Jane Austen Book Club\" (2007) and the Steve Carell comedy, \"Dan in Real Life\" (2007). The breadth of her versatility coupled with her love of unusual, unhinged characters was solidified with starring roles in as varied projects as \"Sunshine Cleaning\" (2009), \"Young Victoria\" (2009), \"The Wolfman\" (2010) and \"The Adjustment Bureau\" (2011). Adding to her share of the spotlight, Blunt married \"The Office\" star John Krasinski in 2010, while maintaining a busy schedule in films like the twisty science fiction of \"Looper\" (2012), Stephen Sondheim adaptation \"Into the Woods\" (2014), and crime thriller \"Sicario\" (2015). Thanks to her fearless ability to tackle both comedy and drama with poise and ease, Blunt easily became one of the better talents to have crossed the pond in quite some time.\n\nDANIELLE BROOKS in The Color Purple Danielle Brooks landed a role most acting graduates only dream of when she took on the part of Tasha \"Taystee\" Jefferson in the hit series \"Orange is the New Black\" (Netflix 2013-) just two years after graduating from Juilliard. Taystee was a bubbly, foul-mouthed inmate at a women's correctional facility who quickly became the show's breakout character. Brooks was born on September 17, 1989 in Greenville, South Carolina. As the daughter of a minister and a deacon, she discovered her love of music and drama in the church, which helped to shape her future ambitions and moral center. She started acting in church plays at the age of six and was inspired to try out for Juilliard School after seeing a powerful performance of \"The Color Purple\" on Broadway. To her surprise, she nailed the audition and graduated from the prestigious drama school in 2011. After graduating, she found herself juggling two roles: one in the Shakespeare Theater Company production of \"The Servant of Two Masters\" (2012) and the other in \"Blacken the Bubble\" (2012). While her stage work suited her formal training at school, she ended up having to leave both productions for the opportunity to appear on the Netflix dramedy. Initially slated to only appear in a few episodes, her interpretation of the character impressed the show's creator, Jenji Kohan (previously responsible for creating the series \"Weeds\" (Showtime 2005-2012)) and was announced as a series regular. Based on Piper Kerman's memoir about her time spent in prison for money laundering and the subsequent relationships she forged with her fellow inmates, \"Orange Is The New Black\" struck a chord with audiences and critics alike. Brooks prepared for the role by studying Kerman's book and watching countless hours of the show \"Beyond Scared Straight\" (A&E 2011-). The show also reunited her with her friend of six years and fellow Julliard alum Samira Wiley, who played Taystee's enemy turned soulmate Poussey. Bringing a vivacious energy to the role, Brooks described her character as the light inside the prison. Brooks also became the first African-American female character on the show \"Girls\" (HBO 2012-17), making a guest star appearance in the show's third season. Brooks also appeared in an episode of Aziz Ansari's sitcom \"Master of None\" (Netflix 2015- ) and took on a voice role in the animated hit \"The Angry Birds Movie\" (2016) while continuing her work on \"Orange is the New Black.\"\n\nAMERICA FERRERA in Barbie Ever since her dynamic film debut in \"Real Women Have Curves\" (2002), actress America Ferrera earned considerable acclaim for playing complex roles despite her young age. Exuding grace, intelligence and maturity in her first leading role, which earned her an Independent Spirit Award nomination, Ferrera found herself suddenly in demand, landing both film and television roles in rapid succession. After memorable performances on an episode of \"Touched By an Angel\" (CBS, 1994-2003) and in the television movie \"Plainsong\" (CBS, 2004), she returned to the big screen in \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" (2005), stealing the show in an ensemble drama about four friends who share a very special summer together. Already a rapidly rising star, Ferrera delivered a charming and endearing portrayal of a young woman who struggles to fit into the high-pressure world of fashion on \"Ugly Betty\" (ABC, 2006-10), which earned the young actress a surprising Emmy Award and international fame. She built on that success with a starring role and production duties on the subtly socially-conscious sitcom \"Superstore\" (NBC 2015- ).\n\nJODIE FOSTER in Nyad Jodie Foster was an American actress, producer, and director who successfully embodied several contradictions throughout her long and storied career: a child star who grew up in public yet fiercely maintained privacy for herself and her family, a box office draw who brought sheer artistry to every role, winning two Best Actress Academy Awards in the process, and a woman who refused to play by Hollywood's standards, yet still enjoys a rewarding and lucrative career to this very day. She was born Alicia Christian Foster on November 19, 1962 in Los Angeles, CA. The youngest of four siblings, Foster's parents divorced shortly before her birth, and she never quite established a bond with her father, a successful real estate broker and decorated Air Force officer from a wealthy Chicago family. Foster's mother, Brandy, worked as a publicist for film producer Arthur P. Jacobs before she became a full-time manager for Foster and her older brother, Buddy. At an early age, Foster's older siblings gave her the nickname \"Jodie,\" and it stuck. When Foster was three, her mother brought her along to one of Buddy's auditions, for a Coppertone ad. However, when the casting agents noticed Foster, they put her in the ad instead, branding her as the Coppertone girl for life. This spot lead to more advertising work, and in 1968, at the age of six, Foster made her TV debut on an episode of \"Mayberry R.F.D.\" (CBS, 1968-1971). It was apparent from an early age that Foster was a gifted child: she learned to read when she was three years old, and attended a prestigious French-language prep school, the Lyceé Français de Los Angeles (to this day, Foster is fluent in French, and often dubs herself in the French-language versions of her English-language films.) When not preoccupied with school, Foster continued to act in TV shows, mainly short-lived ones based on popular films, including appearances on \"The Courtship of Eddie's Father\" (ABC, 1969-1972), \"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice\" (ABC, 1973), and \"Paper Moon\" (ABC, 1974). Foster made her film debut in \"Napoleon and Samantha\" (1972), before going on to enjoy small roles in \"Kansas City Bomber\" (1972), \"One Little Indian\" (1973), \"Tom Sawyer\" (1973), and \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" (1974). That film's director, Martin Scorsese, was impressed with how she handled the small role he gave her, and decided that he wanted to cast her in his next project, \"Taxi Driver\" (1976). In the film, Foster would play a child prostitute who finds an unlikely guardian angel in Robert De Niro's psychotic cabbie, Travis Bickle. Although Foster's mother encouraged her to take the part, the Los Angeles Welfare Board would not allow it, due to the film's violent content, until governor Pat Brown intervened, and she was assessed by a UCLA psychiatrist. Even then, a social worker was required to be on set during her scenes, and Foster's older sister Connie acted as a stand-in during some of the more sexually explicit scenes. \"Taxi Driver\" was an instant classic upon release, winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and earning Foster her first Academy Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actress. On the other end of the spectrum, Foster also co-starred that year in \"Freaky Friday\" (1976), a family body-swap comedy that cemented her status as a teen idol. After starring in two more acclaimed films, \"Foxes\" (1980) and \"Carny\" (1980), Foster decided to take a break from acting, and enroll full time at Yale University. Though she would later describe her time at Yale as \"a wonderful time of self-discovery,\" it proved to be a trying period for Foster. The few films she starred in during these years, including \"O'Hara's Wife\" (1982), \"The Hotel New Hampshire\" (1984), and \"The Blood of Others\" (1984), were all critical and commercial flops. Even worse was the situation that unfolded when an unhinged fan, John W. Hinckley Jr, began stalking her during her freshman year. Hinckley had become obsessed with Foster after seeing \"Taxi Driver,\" and began harassing her via letters and phone calls, even going so far as to move to New Haven to be near her. Foster did her best to ignore his harassment, but that would be impossible after the events of March 30, 1981, when Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, wounding him and three others. When authorities apprehended him, Hinckley said his motivation for the crime was to impress Foster. The deeply private star soon found herself hounded by the media, and had to be accompanied by bodyguards while on Yale's campus. After providing video testimony in Hinckley's criminal trial, Foster did all she could to put the incident behind her. To this day, she rarely comments on the ordeal publicly. After she graduated (magna cum laude, with a degree in literature), Foster had a rocky time trying to get her career back on track. Her first few post-graduation films, \"Siesta\" (1987), \"Five Corners\" (1987), and \"Stealing Home\" (1988) were all bombs. At first, Foster didn't have much hope for her next project, \"The Accused\" (1988), in which she played a waitress looking for justice after being horrifically gang raped. Producers were weary to cast her, and she only got the part after several other actors turned it down. The shoot was difficult due to the film's heavy subject matter (the scene in which Foster's character is gang raped took five days to complete), and when Foster saw the completed film, she was unhappy with her performance. However, critics disagreed, and gave her and the film rave reviews. At the 1989 Academy Awards, Foster took home the Oscar for Best Actress. For her follow-up, Foster turned in another iconic performance, playing FBI trainee Clarice Starling, a tough Southern belle haunted by a dark childhood, who gets caught up in a mental game of cat and mouse with incarcerated serial killer Dr.Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) while trying to apprehend another serial killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), in Jonathan Demme's horror classic \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991). Released in February of 1991, \"Lambs\" was a legitimate cultural phenomenon, earning rave reviews, doing big business at the box office for almost the entire year, and becoming one of the few films to win the Big Five at the Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (Demme), Best Adapted Screenplay (Ted Tally), Best Actor (Hopkins), and Foster took home her second Best Actress Oscar. However, despite all of the acclaim, the film did stir up controversy: some critics argued that \"Lambs\" was misogynistic due to the brutal murders committed against women by Buffalo Bill in the film, and some in the LGBT+ community condemned the film as homophobic since the villainous Buffalo Bill is portrayed as bisexual and transgender. This outcry lead to public speculation about Foster's sexuality, as certain activists told the press that the actress was a closeted lesbian. The questions about her orientation would follow Foster around for the next two and a half decades. Foster, for her part, kept her head down and continued to work. In October of 1991, she released her directorial debut, \"Little Man Tate\" (1991), about a child prodigy coming of age. The following year, she founded her own production company, Egg Pictures, which would go on to produce six independent features overall. Foster also continued to be a box office draw, wowing both critics and audiences in the Civil War romance \"Sommersby\" (1993), the Western comedy \"Maverick\" (1994), and the prestigious drama \"Nell\" (1994), in which she played a woman who grew up isolated in Appalachia and speaks her own invented language. The film earned Foster her fourth Oscar nomination. Foster's luck began to run out when her second directorial effort, \"Home for the Holidays\" (1995) was a critical and commercial flop, and she was forced to drop out of David Fincher's thriller \"The Game\" (1997) due to creative differences, but she bounced back by playing a scientist who discovers extraterrestrial life in Robert Zemeckis's sci-fi drama \"Contact\" (1997). As the 90s turned into the 2000s, Foster decided to slow down and focus on family. She had two sons during this time: Charles \"Charlie\" Foster, and Christopher \"Kit\" Foster. Meanwhile, her career hit another rough patch: the period drama \"Anna and the King\" (1999), a dour, stuffy take on the musical \"The King and I,\" was panned by critics and mostly ignored by audiences. She disappointed fans by declinging to reprise the role of Clarice Starling in \"Hannibal\" (2001), reportedly objecting to the film's violent content. She instead focused on her next directorial effort, \"Flora Plum,\" a drama set around a 1930s circus that was set to star Claire Danes and Russell Crowe. Unfortunately, Crowe was injured while performing a trapeze stunt on set, and the film was shut down shortly afterwards. However, Foster found a way to bounce back: she reinvented herself as a star of pulse-pounding, crowd-pleasing thrillers. She reunited with David Fincher for \"Panic Room\" (2003), playing a woman who hides in a high tech panic room with her daughter during a home invasion that goes awry, subbing in at the last minute when original star Nicole Kidman had to leave the film following an injury on set. The film was a box office hit, and soon Foster was on a roll: after a quick detour spent putting her French to use in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's period romance \"A Very Long Engagement\" (2004), over the next few years she appeared in a number of like-minded thrillers, including \"Flightplan\" (2005), playing a woman whose daughter mysteriously vanishes during an overnight flight, Spike Lee's \"Inside Man\" (2006), a bank heist caper set on Wall Street, and \"The Brave One\" (2007), in which Foster becomes a vigilante after the murder of her fiancé. That same year, during a speech at The Hollywood Reporter's \"Women in Entertainment\" breakfast, Foster publicly acknowledged her relationship with Cydney Bernard for the first time. The pair had met and began dating on the set of \"Sommersby\" in 1993. They split after 15 years together the next year. Foster would also make some conflicting allusions to her sexual orientation in 2011, during her Cecil B. DeMille Award acceptance speech at the 70th Golden Globes, while never actually using the words \"lesbian\" or \"gay.\" Galvanized by the success of her run of thrillers, Foster decided to return to directing, this time taking on the bizarre black comedy \"The Beaver.\" The tale of a depressed suburban dad (Mel Gibson) who finds a new lease on life when he begins talking through the titular hand puppet, the concept of the film, and the handling of the material, rubbed some people the wrong way, and that was before tapes of Gibson making anti-semitic, racist, and sexist comments surfaced. Though Foster stood by her star and close friend, \"The Beaver\" was received with confusion by critics and totally ignored by audiences. Following that fiasco, and the failure of her next film, the high concept sci-fi drama \"Elysium\" (2013), Foster decided to focus on directing television for the first time. She would spend the next few years helming episodes of such programs as \"Orange Is the New Black\" (Netflix, 2013-19), \"House of Cards\" (Netflix, 2013-19), and \"Black Mirror\" (Channel 4/Netflix, 2011-). In 2014, Foster got married to actress and photographer Alexandra Hedison. Two years later, her fourth feature film, the financial world thriller \"Money Monster\" (2016), starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts, was released. Foster was next seen playing Jean \"The Nurse\" Thomas in the futuristic action thriller \"Hotel Artemis\" (2018).

She was born on May 21, 1986 and grew up in Pennsylvania. Initially interested in becoming a singer, she attended Temple University to study vocal performance, but later switched her concentration to musical theater. She went on to study theater at the Yale School of Drama, where she received her Master's in 2011. Shortly after, she auditioned for an understudy role in \"Ghost the Musical,\" based on the popular 1990 romantic film. Instead, Randolph was cast in the role of the mysterious medium Oda Mae Brown in London's West End. Randolph continued the role on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. Moving on to cinema, she appeared in \"Mother Of George\" (2013), an independent film centering around Nigerians struggling to live and reproduce in Brooklyn. Her first regular TV role was a lead in the short-lived \"Selfie\" (ABC 2014), in which Randolph played Charmonique Whitaker, a friendly receptionist. The show was cancelled after only a handful of episodes aired. She was next cast as the lead in \"Vice Principals\" (HBO 2015- ), a show about the quirks and dramas of high school administration starring Danny McBride. Randolph played Dr. Belinda Brown, a confident new principal at Lincoln High.\n\nANATOMY OF A FALL, Justine Triet\n\nKILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON, Martin Scorsese\n\nPOOR THINGS, Yorgos Lanthimos\n\nDirecting\n\nOPPENHEIMER, Christopher Nolan\n\nTHE ZONE OF INTEREST, Jonathan Glazer\n\nJustine Triet (born 17 July 1978) is a French film director, screenwriter and editor. In 2023, Triet won the Palme d'Or at the 76th Cannes Film Festival for the courtroom thriller Anatomy of a Fall, becoming the third female director to win the award. In 2024, Triet became the first female French filmmaker to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Triet is a graduate of the Beaux-Arts de Paris. Her directorial debut feature film, Age of Panic, was presented as part of the ACID programme at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and was ranked number 10 on Cahiers du Cinéma's Top 10 List in 2013, after being highlighted by critic Stéphane Delorme in the April 2013 editorial among a generation of young, emerging French filmmakers. In 2016, she wrote and directed the romantic comedy-drama In Bed with Victoria, which was nominated for the César Awards for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay. In 2019, her comedy-drama film Sibyl premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or. In 2023, her courtroom thriller Anatomy of a Fall was presented at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d'Or, making Triet the third female director to win the award. She also won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay and Best Foreign Language Film. In 2024, Triet became the first female French filmmaker and the eighth female director to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for Anatomy of a Fall,[13] also earning a nomination for Best Original Screenplay, with the film receiving a total of 5 nominations, including Best Picture. Triet also won a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for Best Director and Best Film Not in the English Language for Anatomy of a Fall, which received 7 nominations in total, including Best Film. Triet also won three César Awards for Best Film, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Anatomy of a Fall, which won a total of 6 awards at the 2024 César Awards.\n\nArguably one of the greatest directors of all time, Martin Scorsese made some of the most daring films in cinema history. His impressive body of work is a meditation on the visceral nature of violence and male relationships that often reflected his own personal angst growing up in the violent streets of Manhattan's Lower East Side. Starting with \"Mean Streets\" (1973), a gritty look at life in Little Italy, Scorsese made his mark on Hollywood while simultaneously discarding many of its conventions. With his seminal films \"Taxi Driver\" (1976) and \"Raging Bull\" (1980), Scorsese firmly established himself as a top director of his generation. Though he hit a brief creative lull in the 1980s, films like \"After Hours\" (1985), \"The Color of Money\" (1986) and \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988) would have been welcome additions on any director's résumé. He returned to top form with the hyperkinetic mob tale, \"Goodfellas\" (1990), widely considered by fans to be among his best films. With each passing film - \"Casino\" (1995), \"Gangs of New York\" (2002), \"The Aviator\" (2004) - Scorsese cemented his legendary status, but failed to win the recognition of his peers. Five times nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards, he finally won in 2007 for his exceptional Irish gangster thriller, \"The Departed\" (2006), which gave him the recognition he had long deserved.\n\nJonathan Glazer (born 26 March 1965) is an English film director and screenwriter. He began his career in theatre before transitioning into film, directing the features Sexy Beast (2000), Birth (2004), Under the Skin (2013), and The Zone of Interest (2023). His work is often characterized by depictions of flawed and desperate characters, explorations of themes such as alienation and loneliness, a bold visual style that utilizes an omniscient perspective, and dramatic use of music. Glazer has been nominated for six BAFTA Awards and two Academy Awards. For the historical drama The Zone of Interest, he won both the Grand Prix and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, and has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. Glazer has also directed numerous music videos for Radiohead, Massive Attack, Richard Ashcroft, and others. For his work, he received nominations for the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction twice, consecutively for his work on Jamiroquai's \"Virtual Insanity\" and Radiohead's \"Karma Police\". He has also directed commercials for Kodak, Sony, Nike, Barclays, and Alexander McQueen, among others.\n\nRuben Östlund, a Swedish filmmaker, has been nominated for his 2022 satirical black comedy film \"Triangle of Sadness.\" Östlund was nominated for the 95th Oscar for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for the film \"Triangle of Sadness.\" Östlund's Oscar nomination came in 2018 for his film \"The Square,\" which he wrote and directed. The film is a satirical look at the art world and the dynamics of power and privilege, and won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival before going on to receive an Oscar nomination. In addition to his Oscar nomination, Östlund has received many other accolades for his work, including numerous awards at film festivals around the world. He has also been nominated for and won several Swedish film awards, including the Guldbagge Award for Best Director, which he has won four times.\n\nThanks to his stylized, time-bending renovation of film noir conventions, director Christopher Nolan established himself as a creator of psychologically demanding films that defied classification. Though he made his feature debut with the ultra-low budget indie, \"Following\" (1998), Nolan put himself on the map with \"Memento\" (2000), a classic revenge story with the unique twist of being told backwards. Hailed by many critics and - by indie standards - made successful by a rabid audience, \"Memento\" quickly turned Nolan's fortunes, establishing him as a highly sought-after talent. He soon followed with the thriller \"Insomnia\" (2002), starring heavy-hitters Al Pacino, Hilary Swank and Robin Williams. But it was the blockbuster \"Batman Begins\" (2005) - a reimagined take on a long-defunct film franchise - that propelled Nolan to the upper tier of Hollywood directors. His dark, brooding take on the avenging crusader was much more aligned with its original intention than any other subsequent incarnation had been, earning critical praise, audience admiration and a large chunk of box office dollars. With \"The Prestige\" (2006), \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) and \"Inception\" (2010), his reputation as an auteur working in a blockbuster world was firmly cemented. Later works \"Interstellar\" (2014) and \"Dunkirk\" (2017) showed that his mastery of form extended to philosophical science fiction and gripping war drama as well.\n\nBorn in Athens, Greece in 1973, Yorgos Lanthimos briefly studied business and played professional basketball before he turned to study film in his hometown. Although there were very few Greek films being made, Lanthimos managed to find work behind the camera as a commercial director. He co-directed his first feature, a comedy called \"My Best Friend\" (2001), but the mainstream sensibility didn't suit his style. \"Kinetta\" (2005) was his first solo directing effort, and his unique style and framing earned the film entry into international festivals in Berlin and Toronto. His aesthetic was on full display in \"Dogtooth\" (2009), a drama about a family that has withdrawn from the outside world. The film earned the Un Certain Regard Award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Lanthimos' next film \"Alps\" (2011) wasn't met with the same regard, but his first English language film, \"The Lobster\" (2015), cemented his reputation as a wholly unique auteur. The film won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and Lanthimos was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. His follow up, the thoughtful psychological thriller \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\" (2017) starring Nicole Kidman didn't have as much success, but again Lanthimos bounced back with his most high profile project to date. \"The Favourite\" (2018) won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nIO CAPITANO (Italy)\n\nSOCIETY OF THE SNOW (Spain)\n\nTHE TEACHERS' LOUNGE (Germany)\n\nPERFECT DAYS (Japan)\n\nTHE ZONE OF INTEREST (United Kingdom)\n\nBEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE FILM\n\nand enjoy the magic of the big screen.\n\nWIN CINEMA TICKETS\n\n+INFOterms and conditions\n\nWin Cinema Tickets!
