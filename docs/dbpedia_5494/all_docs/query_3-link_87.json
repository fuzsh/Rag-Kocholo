        "text": "What is Golden Globe Awards?\n\nThe Golden Globe Awards is conferred by Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) to personalities in the film and television industry for their outstanding work.\n\nIt is usually held every January and is a major part of the film industry's awards season, which ends with the Academy Awards. The 78th Golden Globe Awards were held on February 28, 2021.\n\nGolden Globe Awards History\n\nEarlier, the award was conferred to a person for excellence in filmmaking. In 1950, the foundation created a special honourary award for outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry as well and was presented to director Cecil B. DeMille. Since then, the official name for the award became the Cecil B. DeMille Award.\n\nThe revenues generated from the ceremony are donated to entertainment-related charities and help fund creative scholarships for artists.\n\nAfter the Oscars and the Grammy Awards, it is the third most-watched show, telecast in 167 countries.\n\nIn 2008, the 65th Golden Globes ceremony was cancelled due to the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike, and replaced by a press conference to announce the winners.\n\nUnder the Best Director category, Elia Kazan holds the most with four wins, followed by Clint Eastwood, Oliver Stone, Milos Forman, David Lean, and Martin Scorsese, whereas Steven Spielberg holds the record for most nominations with twelve as of 2017.\n\nIn acting, Meryl Streep holds the record for the most wins with eight along with the most nominations with 31.\n\nGolden Globe Awards eligibility and rules\n\nThe movie must be at least 70 minutes long and released for a seven-day run in the Greater Los Angeles area, while a TV programme must air in the US between the prime time hours of 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. The reality and non-scripted shows are not eligible.\n\nThe actors in a TV series must appear in at least six episodes and actors in a TV film or mini-series must appear in at least five per cent of the time in that.\n\nAccording to the rules, HFPA members need to be invited to an official screening of each eligible film directly. For TV shows, they must be available to be seen by the members.\n\nThe qualifying period for all nominations is from January 1 through December 31.\n\nGolden Globe Awards Categories\n\nFILM\n\nBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\nBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nBest Motion Picture – Foreign Language\n\nBest Motion Picture – Animated\n\nBest Director – Motion Picture\n\nBest Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama\n\nBest Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nBest Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama\n\nBest Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nBest Supporting Actor – Motion Picture\n\nBest Supporting Actress – Motion Picture\n\nBest Screenplay – Motion Picture\n\nBest Original Score – Motion Picture\n\nBest Original Song – Motion Picture\n\nCecil B.
