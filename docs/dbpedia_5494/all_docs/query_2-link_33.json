        "text": "(NBC via AP)In the opening moments of a Golden Globes night even more chaotic and confounding than usual, co-host Tina Fey raised a theoretical question: “Could this whole night have been an email?” Only the next three hours would tell. Or Chloé Zhao, making history as the first woman of Asian descent to win best director (and the first woman since 1984.) AdOf course, there were the usual confounding results and baffling snubs, compounded here by some epic Zoom fails. ZHAO MAKES HISTORYWhen Zhao won best director for her haunting and elegant “Nomadland,” she was the first woman of Asian descent to win that award. It was updated on March 3, 2021, to correct the nationality of director of “Nomadland.” Chloe Zhao is Chinese, not Asian American.\n\nIn this video grab issued Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021, by NBC, Jane Fonda accepts the Cecil B. deMille Award at the Golden Globe Awards. (NBC via AP)LOS ANGELES – Just like in her career, Jane Fonda used the Golden Globes’ platform to speak on deeper issues calling for greater diversity in Hollywood while praising the “community of storytellers” as she accepted the Cecil B. DeMille Award. While wearing an all-white suit, Fonda raised the Globes’ highest honor above her head Sunday before commending storytellers for their vital role in troubled times. She is the daughter of Oscar winner Henry Fonda, who died in 1982, and sister of Peter Fonda, who died in 2019. She launched IndieCollect’s Jane Fonda Fund for Women Directors, an organization aimed to support the restoration of films helmed by women from around the world.\n\nShe’s only the second woman in the history of the Globes to win, and the first since Barbra Streisand won for “Yentl” in 1984. Its star, guerilla comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, also won best actor in a comedy. “The Queen's Gambit” won best limited series, and best actress in the category for Anya Taylor-Joy. “Schitt's Creek,” the Pop TV series that found a wider audience on Netflix, won best comedy series for its final season. Catherine O'Hara also took best actress in a comedy series.\n\nThis combination photo shows, from left, Awkwafina, Cynthia Erivo, Joaquin Phoenix, Kristen Wiig and Renee Zellweger, who are among the first presenters announced for the Golden Globes awards ceremony. (AP Photo)LOS ANGELES – “Barb and Star” are headed to the Golden Globes — actors Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo will be among the presenters at the upcoming ceremony. Wiig and Mumolo's latest film, “Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar,” was released last week and some are already calling the campy film a cult classic. She’s won Golden Globes for her acting “Klute,” “Julia” and “Coming Home.”Norman Lear will be honored with the Carol Burnett Award, a counterpart to the DeMille Award that focuses on life achievement in television. Netflix dominated the nominations earlier this month, with its film “Mank” and its television series “The Crown” the leading nominees.\n\nFlowers are placed in front of a temporary headstone for the late actor Burt Reynolds in the Garden of Legends section of Hollywood Forever cemetery, Thursday, Feb. 11, 2021, in Los Angeles. Reynolds' cremated remains were moved from Florida to Hollywood Forever, where a small ceremony was held Thursday. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)LOS ANGELES – Burt Reynolds finally reached his final resting place Thursday at a storied Hollywood cemetery. A small, private ceremony, with relatives taking part remotely via Zoom, was held Thursday morning at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where Reynolds' cremated remains were placed in a grave next to a lake nearly 2 1/2 years after his death. Reynolds’ grave is across the lake from rockers Johnny Ramone and Chris Cornell.\n\nThe Golden Globes will bestow the Carol Burnett Award to Lear during the 78th annual awards ceremony next month. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, File)LOS ANGELES – Norman Lear made his mark as a television producer who strived to explore race relation issues through his famed sitcoms “All in the Family” and “Good Times.” And now, the Golden Globes will honor Lear with its TV special achievement trophy. Nominations for the upcoming Golden Globes are scheduled to be announced Feb. 3. As a social activist, Lear founded advocacy organization People for the American Way. He also founded several other non-profits to promote thoughtful citizenship, including the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication.\n\nFILE - Actress Jane Fonda appears at the 71st international film festival in Cannes, southern France, on May 12, 2018.

Fonda will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award during the 78th annual awards ceremony on Feb. 28, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced Tuesday. She launched IndieCollect’s Jane Fonda Fund for Women Directors, an organization aimed to support the restoration of films helmed by women from around the world."
