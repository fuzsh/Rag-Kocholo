        "text": "Two staples of the Golden Globes will be sitting out the upcoming 2024 edition of the awards show, which airs on CBS this Sunday, Jan. 7 — the honorary Cecil B. DeMille and Carol Burnett trophies.\n\nThe two life-achievement awards, given to Eddie Murphy and Ryan Murphy, respectively, last year, will not be presented this year but expected to return in the future.\n\nThe development comes as the Globes over the past 12 months changed ownership and status, becoming a for-profit organization owned by Deadline parent PMC along with show producer Dick Clark Prods. in a joint venture with Eldridge; their voting body, expanding to 300 members representing 76 countries; and network, moving to CBS (streaming on Paramount+) after decades on NBC.\n\nThe ceremony added two new categories this year, for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement and for Best Performance By a Stand-Up Comic On Television, the former featuring eight nominees.\n\n“The awards also grew with 25 of the competitive categories expanding from five nominees to six, but with that increase comes a reduction for this year with no presentation of the Cecil B. DeMille and Carol Burnett Awards,” Globes’ Tim Gray wrote in a post on the show’s Web site last month. “This is not a permanent change, with future awards slated to be given.”\n\nThe film-focused Cecil B. DeMille Award has been presented every year, starting with DeMille in 1952, except for 1976; 2008, when there was no ceremony because of the WGA strike, with winners being announced at a press conference; and in 2022, when the ceremony was not televised following HFPA voting body diversity and other controversies.\n\nThe TV-themed Carol Burnett Award was established in 2019 with Burnett as the first recipient. It has been given out yearly since then, except for 2022."
