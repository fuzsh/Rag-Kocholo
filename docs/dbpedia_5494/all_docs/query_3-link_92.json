        "text": "Tom Hanks, decorated actor, Mr. Rogers lookalike and America's dad, is set to be honored at next year's Golden Globe Awards.\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced Tuesday morning that Hanks, 63, will be the next recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award, an annual honor given to a \"talented individual who has made a lasting impact on the film industry.\" The award show is set to air live Jan. 5, 2020.\n\n“For more than three decades, he’s captivated audiences with rich and playful characters that we’ve grown to love and admire,\" HFPA President Lorenzo Soria said in a press release. \"As compelling as he is on the silver screen, he’s equally so behind the camera as a writer, producer and director.\"\n\nPast recipients of the award include Meryl Streep, George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Barbra Streisand, Denzel Washington, Martin Scorsese and Audrey Hepburn.\n\nHanks, a 2-time Oscar winner, 7-time Emmy winner and 4-time Golden Globe winner, is known and celebrated for a myriad of comedic and dramatic roles since the 1980s, including \"Big,\" \"Sleepless in Seattle,\" \"Cast Away,\" \"A League of Their Own,\" \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Toy Story.\" He is also a 2009 American Film Institute lifetime achievement award recipient, 2014 Kennedy Center Honoree and 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient.\n\n“Everybody who has ever put something on film has a countenance that is carried through forever,” Hanks told USA TODAY this summer. “It's unmistakably them, but at the same time, you are willing to follow them to wherever they lead you. I get that and I'm not about to pretend it doesn't exist. It’s powerful and it's another type of connection you have that is very individual to every audience member.”\n\nAnd he takes that into account when choosing his projects: \"I've said no to some things because I said, 'Guys, I'd be faking it.' Every time you make a movie, there is somebody out there who is seeing you for the very first time. Therefore, you better be connected to what is expected of you.\"\n\nBefore the Globes air, fans can catch Hanks starring in the Mr. Rogers biopic \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\" His other upcoming projects include the WWII drama “Greyhound,” which he wrote; the post-apocalyptic “BIOS”; and the post-Civil War film “News of the World.”\n\nContributing: Brian Truitt, USA TODAY and The Associated Press\n\nTom Hanks feels so right as Mr. Rogers giving a lesson in forgiveness in 'A Beautiful Day'"
