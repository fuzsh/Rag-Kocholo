        "text": "We often recommend business stories in presentations and meetings because they are vivid and easier to relate to than lists of facts. Getting others to tell good stories first involves understand what is a story, what is not a story, and looking for elements of stories.\n\nA couple years ago, I took some notes on Oprah's 2018 Golden Globes acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille award. In addition to being a master speaker and influencer, Oprah used many story elements in her speech. Want to watch the speech and see when she is using stories and story elements, and when she isn't? Here's the link followed by the answers: read long with the timestamps, or wait to read my notes after taking your own.\n\nContent warning: there are some heavy historical topics in this speech, and while Oprah's speech is masterful, some graphic imagery is in the 2nd half.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jucu6zb8-bM\n\n1. Story at 0:48\n\n“In 1964, I was a little girl sitting on a linoleum floor at my mother’s house watching awards…”\n\n“The winner is, Sidney Poitier.”\n\n“...never seen a black man being celebrated like that. I tried many times to explain what that means to a little girl...whose mom came home tired after cleaning other people’s houses.”\n\nOprah directly relates to this audience at an awards show.\n\n2. Story at 2:05\n\n“In 1982, Sidney received the Cecil B. DeMille Award right here at the Golden Globes.”\n\n“It was not lost on me that there are some little girls watching the first black woman given the same award.”\n\n3. Not a story at 3:40\n\nOprah uses the metaphor of the press navigating these trying times. Not a full story but certainly creates imagery of the audience, media, and celebrities navigating together.\n\n4. Not a story at 4:10\n\nWomen who told their stories (about sexual harassment in Hollywood and beyond). This turns into “this year became the story, one that transcends cultures, politics, workplace, etc.”\n\nThanks the women who told the stories: domestic workers, farm workers, academia, science, athletes, etc.. Again, not a full spoken story but sets up characters that the audience can envision.\n\n5. Story at 5:20\n\n“Recy Taylor. In 1944, young wife, mother, walking home from church service in Alabama. Abducted, raped, blindfolded by white men. They threatened to kill her if she told anyone. Her story was reported to NAACP worker Rosa Parks, who became the lead investigator of their case. The men who tried to destroy her were never prosecuted. Recy died 10 days ago just shy of her 90th birthday.”\n\n6. Not a story at 7:20\n\n“Rosa Parks decided to stay seated on that bus.” Not a full story, but refers to a story the audience knows."
