        "text": "\"For more than three decades, he's captivated audiences with rich and playful characters that we've grown to love and admire. As compelling as he is on the silver screen, he's equally so behind the camera as a writer, producer and director. We're honoured to include Mr. Hanks with such luminaries as Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Martin Scorsese, and Barbra Streisand to name a few,\" Soria added.\n\nChosen by the HFPA Board of Directors, the Cecil B deMille Award is given annually to a talented individual who has made a lasting impact on the film industry.
