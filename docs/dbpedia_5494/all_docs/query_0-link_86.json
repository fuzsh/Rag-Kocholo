        "text": "Last Updated on March 30, 2024\n\nIn my childhood home, there was never time to watch television in the days leading up to Easter – we dyed eggs, brought our baskets down from the attic, and went with our grandma to the speciality markets.\n\nTo help keep this site running: Willow and Thatch may receive a commission when you click on any of the links on our site and make a purchase after doing so.\n\nWe helped her prepare the traditional Slovak Easter meal: the little butter lamb needed to molded, and the kuchen, beet horseradish, deviled eggs and bread with a braid across the top were made in advance. We cut the pussy willows in our yard to bring to church, along with a basket filled with some of our Easter foods, to be blessed.\n\nOn Easter morning there was the excitement of finding our carefully hidden baskets, and the rush to get dressed for church wearing our fresh gardenia corsages, trying not to crush them under the heavy coats we wore because it was cold and rainy again that Easter.\n\nThere was a long lunch with family, which was followed by eating the chocolate bunnies from our baskets, maybe an egg hunt, playing with our friends and falling asleep early, worn out from the day.\n\nAt this time of year I hope to dye eggs, make chocolate bunnies from my vintage molds and put together baskets, but there is some room around the Easter holiday to watch a period drama. Being new to watching movies at Easter, I found myself wondering, what are the best period dramas for the spirit of the week?\n\nSo, I did some research to find out what period films are Easter themed.\n\nThe period movies and costume dramas that are in the BUNNY section are set around Easter or are connected to Easter in a general way, though they may also have a spiritual component.\n\nThe period films and historical dramas that are in the Icthus FISH section are based on the bible, Christ, and / or the resurrection, mostly set in the Classical Period. Some are Hollywood epics, some are quite old movies, and others are recent theatrical releases.\n\nWhen available, there are links to where you can stream the period drama online: click on “Add to your WATCHLIST.” Happy Easter!\n\nA Walton Easter (1997)\n\nThere is a circle-of-life satisfaction to the television movie special, “A Walton Easter,” in which John and Olivia celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary, and John-Boy contemplates returning to Walton’s Mountain for good.\n\nThis is the sixth “Waltons” reunion movie, featuring John-Boy as the TV news anchorperson in New York as he is in the throes of writing a new book. He and a very pregnant Janet are making plans to return to Walton’s Mountain for the celebration of John and Olivia’s 40th wedding anniversary. Accompanying them to see the place John-Boy lived as a child is Aurora, a Time Magazine photographer, who is doing a story on John-Boy. Meanwhile, Elizabeth arrives back from her travels and announces to Drew, who is still working at the mill with Ben, that she is back to stay.\n\nSet in 1969 in the post-war era.\n\nStarring Michael Learned, Ralph Waite, John-Boy, Ellen Corby, Jon Walmsley, Judy Norton, Mary McDonough, Eric Scott, David Harper, Kami Cotler.\n\nNot rated\n\nCheck streaming availability\n\nGet it HERE\n\nChocolat (2000)\n\nA free-thinking single mother and her daughter open a chocolate shop in a morally rigid French village during Lent. She further becomes the target of the mayor’s ire by embracing a group of gypsy boat travelers who arrive in the town. Meanwhile, her chocolates have magical effects on the town’s residents. The period drama ends at Easter.\n\nVianne Rocher, an expert chocolatier, drifts across Europe with her daughter Anouk, following the north wind. In the beginning of the Lenten season in 1959, “fifteen years after the War,” they travel to a quiet French village that closely adheres to tradition, as led by the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud. Just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent leading up to Easter, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, much to Reynaud’s displeasure.\n\nSet in the post-war era.\n\nStarring Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, Alfred Molina, Carrie-Ann Moss, and Judi Dench with a cameo by Leslie Caron.\n\nWatch the TRAILER\n\nRated PG-13\n\nAdd to your WATCHLIST\n\nEaster Parade (1948)\n\nIf you can’t join ’em, beat ’em! When his long-time dance partner abandons him for the Ziegfeld Follies, Don Hewes decides to show who’s who what’s what by choosing any girl out of a chorus line and transforming her into a star. So he makes his choice and takes his chances.\n\nThe musical is set around the time of Easter: Broadway star Don Hewes is buying Easter presents for his sweetheart, starting with a hat and some flowers (“Happy Easter”). He goes into a toy shop and buys a cuddly Easter rabbit, after persuading a young boy to part with it and buy a set of drums instead (“Drum Crazy”)…and later there is a date at the Easter Parade.\n\nSet in 1912 in the Edwardian era.\n\nStarring Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, Peter Lawford, Ann Miller, Jules Munshin.\n\nWatch the TRAILER\n\nNot rated\n\nAdd to your WATCHLIST\n\nLilies of the Field (1963)\n\n“Lilies of the Field” is a film about faith. This classic film tells the story of an African-American itinerant worker who encounters a group of East German nuns, who believe he has been sent to them by God to build them a new chapel.\n\nIn this film, a traveling laborer meets five nuns in the Arizona desert. The appearance of Homer Smith convinces the Mother Superior he is an answer to her prayers. He wins the hearts of the nuns and the thanks of the town, as initial reluctance turns into public acceptance. Nominated for 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and winner of the Best Actor Oscar. Ralph Nelson wonderfully directed this gem of a motion picture featuring stunning black-and-white cinematography by the great Ernest Haller (Gone with the Wind, Mildred Pierce). The title comes from Matthew 6:27-33, a portion of the Sermon on the Mount, and its parallel scripture from Luke 12:27-30.\n\nNot strictly a period drama, as it is set in the post-war era close to when it was made, but it is a great classic older film perfect for Easter, and Easter is in the song “Amen” in the final scene.\n\nStarring Sidney Poitier, Lilia Skala, Lisa Mann, Isa Crino, Stanley Adams.\n\nWatch the TRAILER\n\nNot rated\n\nAdd to your WATCHLIST\n\nLittle House on the Prairie: The Last Farewell (1984)\n\nThis final adventure finds Walnut Grove being purchased by an evil miner. Rather than being thrown off their land, the townsfolk exact a more spectacular method of leaving their beloved town. A two-hour movie special that ended the long running television mini-series.\n\nDuring Charles and Caroline’s visit to Walnut Grove, in 1901, the residents of Walnut Grove learn that a railroad tycoon, Nathan Lassiter, actually holds deed to Hero Township. Apparently, when they claimed the land, it had not been legal since it was not deemed as homesteading land. Though Mr. Lassiter demands the residents’ instant evacuation, the soldiers allow the residents to remain until Easter Sunday.\n\nSet in 1901 in the Edwardian era.\n\nStarring Michael Landon, Melissa Gilbert, Dean Butler, Richard Bull.\n\nNot rated\n\nAdd to your WATCHLIST\n\nMiss Potter (2006)\n\nWritten by Richard Maltby, Jr., “Miss Potter” explores the life of Potter, the author of beloved and best-selling children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, her struggle to overcome a domineering and unsupportive mother and the chauvinism of Victorian England to become a published author.\n\nNot strictly Easter, but it’s a period drama filled with bunnies! (The costume drama is really aimed more at adults than kids and deals with some mature themes, including the death of a loved one.)\n\nSet in the Victorian era.\n\nStarring Renée Zellweger, Ewan McGregor, Emily Watson, Barbara Flynn, Bill Paterson.\n\nWatch the TRAILER\n\nRated PG\n\nAdd to your WATCHLIST\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia (1988) BBC\n\nC.S. Lewis’s enchanting tale comes to life in this classic family-friendly BBC adaptation. When young Second World War evacuee Lucy Pevensie hides in an old wardrobe during a game of hide and seek, she finds herself transported to the magical land of Narnia, locked in eternal winter by the evil White Witch. Her siblings do not believe her when she tells them of this strange new world, but they are soon in Narnia themselves, fighting alongside the noble lion Aslan to defeat the witch and her mighty army.\n\nIn the allegory of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, the lion Aslan represents Christ. Aslan’s death to save Edmund’s life and his subsequent resurrection are clear references to the life of Christ. The made for television mini-series was nominated for a total of 14 awards, including a nomination for an Emmy in the category of “Outstanding Children’s Program.”\n\nSet in the Second World war era.\n\nStarring Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Jonathan R. Scott, Sophie Wilcox.\n\nNot rated\n\nGet it HERE\n\nThe Chronicles Of Narnia (2005)\n\nIn “The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe,” four siblings play a game of hide and seek and wind up entering a magical land. Once there, they discover a world inhabited by beasts, dwarfs, and giants and find themselves in a battle to defeat a witch.\n\nIn the allegory, the lion Aslan represents Christ. Aslan’s death to save Edmund’s life and his subsequent resurrection are clear references to the life of Christ.\n\n“Narnia is, of course, a Christian allegory and the symbology is definitely there (as it should be, otherwise it wouldn’t be the story Lewis wrote), but audiences aren’t knocked over the head with it, and in the hands of another director it could easily have become pedantic. –Dan Vancini\n\nSet in the Second World War era.\n\nStarring Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Mosley, Anna Popplewell, Tilda Swinton.\n\nWatch the TRAILER\n\nRated PG\n\nAdd to your WATCHLIST\n\nThe Easter Promise (1975)\n\nIn a small Nebraska town in the late 1940s, Addie Mills and her young friends are excited over the visit of a celebrity, a local woman who became a successful Broadway actress and has returned home for a short time following the death of her mother. Addie brings the woman home for the family Easter celebration, and the little girl’s concern and kindness help the woman see the promise of better days ahead.\n\nThis is the third installment of A House Without a Christmas Tree. With each heartwarming adventure in this Dove Family-Approved collection, Addie, James, and Grandma Mills remind us of the importance of kindness, community, and family.\n\nSet in the 1940s.\n\nStarring Jason Robards, Lisa Lucas, Mildred Natwick, Jean Simmons, Frannie Michel.\n\nNot rated\n\nGet it HERE\n\nThe Vanishing of Pato (2010):\n\nIf you think Detective Montalbano’s hometown of Vigata can get a little nutty sometimes, you should see it in 1890! Based on the historical mystery novel by Andrea Camilleri, “The Vanishing of Patò” is set in the same seaside town that Detective Montalbano fans know and love. It’s a story of the desperate search for one of Vigata’s most upstanding citizens – a man who vanishes right after his appearance in the annual Passion Play.\n\nSouth collides with North as a local Sicilian carabiniere teams up with a Neapolitan police officer to unlock the mystery of his disappearance. Despite their cultural, linguistic and personal differences the two men have enough in common to forge an alliance which is as comic as it is productive. Together, they wade through local politics, personal agendas and the general wackiness that is Vigata to find out what really happened to the banker and father of two who mysteriously disappeared. And perhaps most surprising of all, the policeman and the carabiniere find that they can trust each other more than they can trust anyone else in Vigata. Detective Montalbano fans will recognize it all: Sicilian characters, Italian culture at its highest (and lowest) and the breathtaking countryside of southern Italy.\n\nSet in the Victorian era.\n\nIn Italian with English subtitles.\n\nStarring Nino Frassica, Neri Marcore, Flavio Bucci, Maurizio Casagrande, Simona Marchini.\n\nAdd to your WATCHLIST\n\nThe Waltons, An Easter Story (1973)\n\nWhen Olivia is stricken with polio, John-Boy refuses to accept the doctor’s prognosis that she may never walk again.\n\nOne Sunday in February was the beginning of a very long and frightening leadup towards Easter. Olivia became ill after church and it was determined that she had polio. She, and her family refused to believe that she would never walk again and although the whole family were scared by the knowledge that Livvy might never fully recover, they provided her with much-needed support…and wait for a miracle.\n\nSet during the Great Depression.\n\nStarring Michael Learned, Ralph Waite, John-Boy, Ellen Corby, Jon Walmsley, Judy Norton, Mary McDonough, Eric Scott, David Harper, Kami Cotler.\n\nAdd to your WATCHLIST (S1, episode 24)\n\nApostle Peter and the Last Supper (2012)\n\nTwo jailers at the ancient Marmertine Prison take custody of a famous criminal. He is Simon Peter of Galilee-apostle, disciple, and personal friend of Jesus, also called The Christ. Condemned to death, the elderly Peter recounts his life as a simple fisherman who became one of the boldest figures in all of Christianity. As Peter prepares to depart this earthly life, he will make an unforgettable impression on his jailers through the saving power of the Gospel.\n\nStarring Bruce Marchiano, Robert Loggia, Bill Oberst Jr., Leon Melas, Laurence Fuller.\n\nNot rated\n\nGet it HERE\n\nBarabbas (1961)\n\nBarabbas, the criminal that Pontius Pilate induced the populace to vote to set free, so that Christ could be crucified, is haunted by the image of Jesus for the rest of his life.\n\n“Starring Anthony Quinn in the title role, “Barabbas” was released in 1961 in the midst of a wave of widescreen epics based on biblical characters. The screenplay, by playwright Christopher Fry (who also contributed to Ben-Hur), is an unusually intelligent one. Further assets are the imaginative, sparingly orchestrated score by Mario Nascimbene and a handsome production design by art director Mario Chiari that is so rewarding to the eye in Aldo Tonti’s often dazzling cinematography.

The performances of the entire cast are stirring, but special recognition is deserved by Diogo Morgado for his performance as Jesus. The best thing about this miniseries is that it functions so well on three very disparate levels: it serves as an affirmation of faith and a bringing to life of a beloved story for the devout, a reminder and re-igniter of faith for those raised in faith who may have strayed from religion, and an overview of the Bible’s stories and a catalyst for faith for those who may never have been exposed to the Bible.” –Tami Horiuchi\n\nStarring Keith David, Darwin Shaw, Diogo Morgado, Roma Downey, Andrew Scarborough.\n\nRated TV-14\n\nAdd to your WATCHLIST\n\nThe Final Inquiry (2006)\n\nA Roman tribune is sent to Palestine to investigate the death and possible resurrection of a certain Jesus from Nazareth.\n\nWhen a solar eclipse and earthquakes simultaneously occur throughout the Roman Empire, Emperor Tiberius calls upon Tito Valerio Tauro, a prominent Roman investigator, to seek out the proposed cause… an alleged resurrection of a Jewish rabbi… a powerful mystery that could bring down an empire.\n\nStarring Daniele Liotti, Dolph Lundgren, Mónica Cruz, Hristo Shopov, Christo Jivkov.\n\nRated PG-13\n\nWATCH for FREE with ADS\n\nThe Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964)\n\nPier Paolo Pasolini’s Biblical drama follows the life of Jesus Christ as depicted in the Gospel of Matthew from the New Testament.

As Jesus travels along the coast of the Sea of Galilee, he gradually gathers more followers, leading him into direct conflict with the authorities.\n\n“Pasolini’s is one of the most effective films on a religious theme I have ever seen, perhaps because it was made by a nonbeliever who did not preach, glorify, underline, sentimentalize or romanticize his famous story, but tried his best to simply record it.” – Roger Ebert\n\nIn Italian with English subtitles.\n\nStarring Enrique Irazoqui, Susanna Pasolini, Mario Socrate.\n\nNot rated\n\nWATCH for FREE with ADS\n\nThe Gospel of John (2014)\n\nThe life and toils of Jesus Christ, depicted as written in the gospel of John.

With this silent-era spectacle, Cecil B. DeMille cemented his reputation as the master of the biblical epic. DeMille tells the story of Christ’s life and Passion with great attention to historical accuracy, along the way paying homage to the religious illustrations of Da Vinci and Doré, and, in a modern flourish, restaging Christ’s resurrection in luminous Technicolor.\n\n“The King of Kings” is the Greatest Story Ever Told as only Cecil B. DeMille could tell it. In 1927, working with one of the biggest budgets in Hollywood history, DeMille spun the life and Passion of Christ into a silent-era blockbuster. Featuring text drawn directly from the Bible, a cast of thousands, and the great showman’s singular cinematic bag of tricks, “The King of Kings” is at once spectacular and deeply reverent—part Gospel, part Technicolor epic.\n\nStarring H.B.

In the next few days thousands of pilgrims will pour into Jerusalem to celebrate the most important festival in their religious calendar. For their Roman masters, led by Pontius Pilate, it is the most difficult time of the year. For the High Priest Caiaphas and his Temple priests the workload will be heavy and the pressure to maintain civil order will be intense. Then news is brought that Jesus the Galilean is approaching the city on a donkey’s colt, and will be entering Jerusalem through the East Gate – thus fulfilling two of the most powerful religious prophecies of the coming of the Messiah. The one who many believe will lead them to military victory or spiritual salvation. On the streets a crowd is beginning to gather. And the week has only just begun…\n\nStarring Joseph Mawle, James Nesbitt, Paul Nicholls, Ben Daniels, Penelope Wilton, Denis Lawson, David Oyelowo.\n\nNot rated\n\nGet it HERE\n\nThe Passion of the Christ (2004)\n\nThe film focuses on the last 12 hours of Jesus’ life and begins in the Garden of Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Betrayed by Judas, He is then arrested and taken within the walls of Jerusalem where the leaders confront Jesus and his trial results in condemnation to death.\n\n“If ever there was a film with the correct title, that film is Mel Gibson’s “The Passion of the Christ.” Although the word passion has become mixed up with romance, its Latin origins refer to suffering and pain; later Christian theology broadened that to include Christ’s love for mankind, which made him willing to suffer and die for us. The movie is 126 minutes long, and I would guess that at least 100 of those minutes, maybe more, are concerned specifically and graphically with the details of the torture and death of Jesus. This is the most violent film I have ever seen. This is not a criticism but an observation; the film is unsuitable for younger viewers, but works powerfully for those who can endure it.” – Roger Ebert\n\nStarring Jim Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, Maia Morgenstern, Christo Jivkov, Francesco De Vito.\n\nWatch the TRAILER\n\nRated R\n\nAdd to your WATCHLIST\n\nThe Song of Bernadette (1943)\n\nBased on the popular novel by Franz Werfel, this drama focuses on Bernadette Soubirous, a young French woman who experiences vivid visions of the Virgin Mary.
