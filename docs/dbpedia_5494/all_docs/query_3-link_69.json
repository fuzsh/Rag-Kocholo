        "text": "We already suspected Tom Hanks would receive some award season love thanks to his buzzy role as Fred Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, but now we know for sure that he'll walk away from 2020 with an important trophy thanks to the Golden Globe Awards. On Tuesday, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) announced that Hanks — who's previously won eight Golden Globes and been nominated 15 times — will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award when the 77th annual event airs on Sunday, Jan. 5.\n\n\"The Hollywood Foreign Press Association is proud to bestow the 2020 Cecil B. deMille Award to Tom Hanks,\" HFPA President Lorenzo Soria said in a press statement. \"For more than three decades, he's captivated audiences with rich and playful characters that we've grown to love and admire. As compelling as he is on the silver screen, he's equally so behind the camera as a writer, producer and director.\"\n\nHanks joins other Hollywood heavyweights who've received the honor like Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Martin Scorsese, and Barbra Streisand. Since its inception in 1952, the Cecil B. DeMille Award is given to someone who's made \"outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.\" It's named after its first-ever recipient, filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, who is considered a founding father of American cinema.\n\nHanks has starred in highly acclaimed films like Saving Private Ryan, Big, Forrest Gump, Cast Away, and the Toy Story franchise. His most recent role is in the aforementioned A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, which gives us a peek into the real-life friendship that bloomed between Mister Rogers and journalist Tom Junod (The Americans star Matthew Rhys)."
