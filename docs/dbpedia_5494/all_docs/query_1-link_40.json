        "text": "Brian Cox has said that being part of one of TV's biggest hit shows has taken away a cherished part of him.\n\nThe veteran actor is nominated in the leading actor category for a Bafta TV Award for the Sky Atlantic juggernaut Succession.\n\nThe programme has won numerous gongs, including a Golden Globe.\n\nBut while he is grateful for the recognition, he told BBC Scotland News it has come at a price.\n\n\"One thing I have lost is my anonymity, which I prized,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a double-edged sword. The success, I am not going to knock it, but at the same time everybody knows who I am now.\n\n\"People would say you're...? I loved the fact people didn't know what to say because I had done so much variation.\n\n\"But now Logan Roy is it, as far as the general public is concerned.\"\n\nThe 77-year-old Dundonian has enjoyed an illustrious career on stage and screen, with accolades including two Laurence Olivier Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Golden Globe Award to show for it.\n\nBut it is his latest high-profile role as the head of the Roy family that has made him a worldwide household name.\n\nHe said: \"I have done more than 200 films altogether so it was just another role, but it was a great one.\n\n\"He always made his punch. There was nothing elaborate about Logan - what you saw was what you got - whether you liked it or not.\"\n\nCox speaks fondly of his time on Succession.\n\n\"It was [a] great time, one of the best jobs, ever - no question - particularly because of the ensemble. It was a great cast to work with.\n\n\"We are close as a family and it was one of the happiest jobs ever.\"\n\nSo happy, in fact, that members of the cast recently flew to London to watch him on stage in Long Day's Journey Into Night.\n\nHe has also been spotted watching Succession daughter Sarah Snook in her London stage production of The Picture Of Dorian Gray.\n\n'It's about doing the work'\n\nThe nomination at Sunday's Bafta TV Awards was a pleasant surprise.\n\n\"I thought that's gone and I'd moved on. But Logan keeps popping back up whether I like it or not,\" he said.\n\n\"I have won so many awards connected to the show but it would be great to win something on one's home turf as it were. But I treat these things with a dash of salt - I don't take them too seriously.\n\n\"It's nice to get awards but it's not about that, it's about doing the work.\"\n\nCox is nominated alongside several Scots.\n\nDavid Tennant is in the male comedy performance category for his Amazon Prime show Good Omens and Jack Lowden is up for supporting actor in Apple TV's Slow Horses .\n\nCox said: \"David has proved this with his Shakespeare work and great TV work. Jack is an amazing young actor who I think will go far.\""
