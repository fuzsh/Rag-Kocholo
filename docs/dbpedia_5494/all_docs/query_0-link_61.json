        "text": "1950 was one of those frustrating years where a number of classic films were released, any one of which would have been Best Picture had it been released the year before. Born Yesterday, The Gunfighter, Father of the Bride, The Asphalt Jungle, and the British-made The Third Man were all superior to anything Hollywood came out with in 1949. But in 1950, the race went down to two enduring masterpieces: All About Eve and Sunset Boulevard. The Academy awarded Eve a record 14 nominations and 6 Oscars, but Sunset Boulevard was close behind with 10 and 3. Both films boasted brilliant casts (especially in the Best Supporting Actor category, where George Sanders' Oscar winning turn as an urbane drama critic and Erich von Stroheim's classic performance as a mysterious butler create unforgettable characterizations) and wonderfully inventive screenplays that make having to select a \"best\" between these two wonderfully entertaining and enduring films a painful chore.\n\nBut the staff of the Hindsight Awards doesn't shy away from such dirty work, and the film that passes test of time far more successfully is Sunset Boulevard. This may be in part because All About Eve seems more dated because it gives a contemporary view of a Broadway that is now a bygone era, whereas Sunset Boulevard is looking back on a world that was already dead when the film was made. Over time the self-consciously witty dialogue of All About Eve's self-absorbed characters become more and more annoying, whereas the timeless Sunset Boulevard becomes fresher with each new viewing. Wilder brilliantly cast Gloria Swanson as the fallen idol Norma Desmond (after Mary Pickford, Pola Negri and Mae West turned it down) because he knew that more current actresses couldn't capture the style of the silent era with the authenticity of someone who had been active in it. Swanson responded with an extraordinary, unique performance that is really unlike any other in the history of film (it is unfortunate that she did her greatest work in such a competitive year for female performances).\n\nWorst Award\n\nThe Best Foreign Film Oscar was still an honorary award in 1950, and the Academy Board of Governors chose René Clément's The Walls of Malapaga for the honor, a forgotten film about a murderer on the run seeking treatment for a toothache. 1950 was a weak year for foreign films released in the United States, with Ways of Love receiving the New York Film Critics citation and the Oscar-winning documentary The Titan - The Story of Michelangelo being named Best Foreign Film by the National Board of Review. In the end, the most remembered foreign film released in the US in 1950 was Jean Renoir's overrated The Rules of the Game, which probably deserved on the basis of Renoir's direction if nothing else. With memories of The Bicycle Thief behind us and the anticipation of the brilliant Rashomon coming up in 1951, it's probably best just to forget about the 1950 Best Foreign Film Oscar and move on to more interesting subjects.\n\nBiggest Oversight\n\nOrson Welles was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director and won the Best Screenplay Oscar for his his film debut Citizen Kane, received a surprise Best Picture nomination for The Magnificent Ambersons the following year, and then was completely ignored by the Academy until they trotted him out to present him a lifetime achievement award in 1970. It's surprising that he wasn't nominated for his most popular role by far as the mysterious Harry Lime in The Third Man, a film the Academy thought so highly of that they nominated it for Best Director, Best Film Editing and awarded it the Best Black & White Cinematography award. It's a gripping suspense yarn until Welles finally appears late in the game and completely takes the movie over. The character was so successful for him that he starred in a spin-off radio series The Lives of Harry Lime in 1951/52 and while the Academy's final five of Von Stroheim, Sanders, Edmund Gwenn in Mr. 880, Sam Jaffe in The Asphault Jungle and Jeff Chandler in Broken Arrow were all worthy choices, we can't help but think that the race would have been more exciting if Harry Lime had been in their midst. Welles might not have agreed since he was said to resent the role, bitter that his most popular part was in a film that he didn't direct.\n\nOur memories of the 1950s are best displayed in TV sitcoms of the period like Leave It to Beaver, Make Room for Daddy and Father Knows Best. They represented a well-ordered world of easy answers and self-assured authority figures who had everything under control. In reality, the US of the 1950s was at one of its most intensive pressure points, with the paranoia of McCarthyism and the constant threat of nuclear war looming over everyone's head. In such troubled times, people wanted to believe in easy answers and welcomed the seeming simplicity of a repressed life. In such a world, the torrid sexuality of A Streetcar Named Desire was a disquieting revelation. Dismissed by many as smut (critic George Jean Nathan dubbed it Glands Menagerie after playwright Tennessee Williams' earlier play The Glass Menagerie), most discerning audiences immediately recognized it as the intense work of art that it was. Even the oppressive Hollywood censors of 1951 couldn't rob it of its white-hot effectiveness. And with the groundbreaking work of the brilliant Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski, everyone knew that A Streetcar Named Desire was not only the best film of the year, but it opened the door to a new honesty about sexuality that could only be hinted at in the past.\n\nAll that is immaterial when selecting the Academy Awards. Like Citizen Kane before it, Streetcar couldn't be named Best Picture because of things that had nothing to do with its qualities as a motion picture. In such troubled times, a conservative institution like the Academy could no more give an agitator like Tennessee Williams the Oscar than a Hollywood studio could give a blacklisted writer screen credit. And in a decade when films like Rebel Without a Cause, The Blackboard Jungle and Salt of the Earth were forcing us to reconsider the individual's place in society, the Academy was giving Oscars to escapist drivel like Around the World in 80 Days and Gigi.\n\nIts easy to understand why a film like An American in Paris was selected as Best Picture in 1951. Considered a major upset when it won the award (which was expected to go to George Stevens' flawed and depressing tragedy A Place in the Sun), An American in Paris was actually very much in the Academy Award vein: an impressive though ultimately unchallenging big budget film made by high pedigree talent that the main thing anyone remembers for is winning the Academy Award. An American in Paris manages to be both pretentious (through its overly stylized ballets that are far less entertaining than what Kelly did in the `40s) and trivial (through its almost nonexistent story, where Kelly and Leslie Caron display no chemistry at all and one doesn't care in the slightest if they get together at the end or not) at the same time. Nobody really thought An American in Paris was the best film made in 1951, but at least no one was made to feel uncomfortable at its selection.\n\nThe biggest box office hit of 1952 was This is Cinerama, a travelogue that showed off the new widescreen, three-camera process of Cinerama. Its phenomenal success sent a clear message to Hollywood; that in order to combat the coming of television, the greatest weapon at its disposal was size. Films didn't have to be good in order to succeed. They had to be big. The Academy chose not to honor the best film of 1952, but the biggest: Cecil B. DeMille's gargantuan tribute to life under the big top, The Greatest Show on Earth. Frequently derided as the worst film to win the Best Picture award, DeMille's Oscar winner is a tired soap opera that rises above its hackneyed material only by virtue of its size. But in 1952, size is exactly what movie audiences wanted, so it is difficult to fault the Academy for selecting it any more than it is difficult to fault them for voting for The Broadway Melody in 1928/29. Had a more objective panel been voting for the award, the Oscar probably would have gone to High Noon. But there was a backlash against that film because its Oscar nominated screenwriter Carl Foreman was under investigation by the McCarthy committee; so right-thinking Academy members naturally assumed that it had some underlying Red sentimentalities even though it starred All American Gary Cooper. Fortunately for the security of the United States, Foreman was eventually blacklisted; although he (and fellow blacklistee Michael Wilson) did later win an Oscar for The Bridge on the River Kwai, using the novel's original author, Pierre Boulle, as a front.\n\nWith all this going on, it is a shame that the film universally regarded as the year's best slipped through the cracks. Singin' in the Rain was selected by the American Film Institute as the 10th best film ever made and is frequently named as the definitive movie musical. It was appreciated in its own time as well, winning the award from the Writers Guild as Best Written American Musical and a nomination from the Directors Guild for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures for Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly. But it didn't get much respect from the Academy in the year that it came out, receiving a paltry two Oscar nominations (for Best Supporting Actress for Jean Hagen and Best Scoring of a Musical Picture). The most likely explanation of the snub is that the Academy didn't want to honor another Gene Kelly musical so soon after giving An American in Paris the top prize. Another example of a film not being named Best Picture for reasons that had nothing to do with its artistic quality.\n\nFred Zinnemann's film of James Jones' best-selling novel From Here to Eternity was the perfect film to select for Best Picture in 1953: A well-acted drama that created controversy for its steamy sex scenes (without being too controversial or too sexy). It is an enjoyably elaborate soap opera, with wonderfully memorable performances by Burt Lancaster, Deborah Kerr, Donna Reed, Frank Sinatra and particularly Montgomery Clift as the tortured Private Robert E. Lee Pruitt, that tied the record for the most Oscar wins with eight and won many of the other year-end awards as well, including those from the New York Film Critics and the BAFTAs. But there is no question that movie standards of the day toned down the torrid sexuality and brutality of the novel considerably, and there are lapses in the logic of the story (Clift's devotion to the army after being horribly mistreated during his service makes no sense at all). It's a fantastic movie that we never tire of watching, and we think of it with respectful appreciation.\n\nUnfortunately for From Here to Eternity, it came out the same year as a movie we adore more every time we watch it. William Wyler's delightful Roman Holiday, which introduced a fresh new talent named Audrey Hepburn to the screen (not counting the few minor parts she had already played in some European films, including a nonspeaking role the Ealing Studios 1952 classic The Lavender Hill Mob), who won the role only after original director Frank Capra (who would have made it with Elizabeth Taylor and Cary Grant) allowed his option to pass on it. Fresh is exactly the word for Roman Holiday: a breathtaking romantic comedy that makes one believe in love. It's a rare thing when the Academy gives its top prize to a romantic comedy, and with Serious Drama like From Here to Eternity, Shane and The Robe in the running, it never had a chance. But Roman Holiday has a singular evergreen quality about it: despite spawning more derivitive imitations than perhaps any film ever made, it is as affecting, charming and amusing now as the day it premiered. The next time it's playing on television on a rainy afternoon, check it out and see if you don't wind up falling a little in love yourself.\n\nOn the Waterfront placed number 8 on the AFI's list of the hundred greatest American films on the twentieth century. No other films from this year made the list, although the omission of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers does seem like a peculiar oversight. But even with this nitpicking, it is clear that Elia Kazan's drama about corruption on the docks was far-and-away the finest film of the year, and it's a relief that even the Academy recognized it, giving On the Waterfront a then-record eight Oscars (tying it with Gone With the Wind and From Here to Eternity for the most statuettes to date). Not all of those awards were no-brainers (Seven Brides certainly should have given it a run for its money for the editing award), but Elia Kazan's direction and the performances of Marlon Brando and Eva Marie Saint were without peer. And while Edmond O'Brien undeservedly won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his tiresome performance as a press agent in The Barefoot Contessa, it didn't hurt his cause that three nominated performances from On the Waterfront canceled each other out. (A film receiving three acting nominations in one category had only been accomplished once before, for Mutiny on the Bounty, and would only be equaled thrice more, for Tom Jones and the first two installments of The Godfather).\n\nAt first glance, the Academy's selection of the modest, low-budget Marty seemed to be their way of continuing to apologize for naming the behemoth The Greatest Show on Earth as Best Picture in 1952. But Marty was a revelation in 1955, winning all of the major film awards handed out that year and universal acclaim for the performance of Ernest Borgnine in the title role of a butcher who spends his free time hanging around with his buddies asking the eternal question \"Whattayoo wanna do tonight?\" Prior to Marty, Borgnine was best known as a villain in films like From Here to Eternity and Bad Day at Black Rock, but his sensitive performance won him a brief period of stardom in somber dramas like The Catered Affair and The Rabbit Trap before returning to his true calling in supporting roles in blockbusters like The Dirty Dozen and The Poseidon Adventure. But for all the sensation Borgnine created as Marty Piletti and as moving as the film undeniably is, it's not always easy to understand what the fuss was about. Based on Paddy Chaevsky's 1952 teleplay, the film frankly looks like a TV show and Ernest Borgnine's bland performance as a bland butcher sometimes comes off as, well, bland. But there is an undeniable poetry to the blandness and poetry is a commodity that is often in short supply on motion picture screens.\n\nAlthough generally regarded as a weak movie year, there were numerous films released in 1955 that some quarters prefer to the gentle hopefulness of Marty. A Rebel Without a Cause is usually pointed to as the most influential film of the year, but its influence seems to come more from James Dean's landmark performance than from the film as a whole. And Charles Laughton's superb directorial debut Night of the Hunter has enjoyed an enormous rise in its reputation since being written off as a box office flop when it first came out. But it lacks the emotional impact of Marty. As for the Academy's final four, Love is a Many Spendored Thing, Mister Roberts, Picnic and The Rose Tattoo, they're all second-string entries which wouldn't have stood a chance of a nomination in the far-stronger 1954. But we're still not entirely sold on Marty and look hopefully to other deserving possibilities: Bad Day at Black Rock, East of Eden and Blackboard Jungle, to name a few. While we're not altogether thrilled to admit it, when we consider these films and then ask ourselves \"Whattayoo wanna do tonight?\", the answer inevitably comes back as watch Marty. It's not a selection we're terribly excited about but when considering the other options, we have to grudgingly acquiesce that it was the best the movies had to offer that year.\n\nWorst Award\n\nAfter grudgingly going along with the selection of Marty as Best Picture (whose success is almost entirely due to Paddy Chaevsky's touching screenplay), we're drawing the line at giving Ernest Borgnine the Best Actor Oscar prize. Borgnine was honored for a performance which straddled a fine line between being earnest and being merely maudlin, and while it certainly had its engaging aspects does not have the impact of the now-legendary performance of James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause. Dean unquestionbly had the \"it\" factor in his few screen appearances before his untimely death, but his iconic presence doubtless made the lasting impact it did because of a cult that grew from his passing and romanticized him into far more than he really was, which was an undisciplined young colt who had the good fortune of working with strong directors who reigned in his self-indulgences with mixed results (Dean was strangely nomineted not for Rebel Without a Cause, but for his less remembered work in East Of Eden, in which his lack of experience is more apparent). If Dean had lived, he might have developed into a talent that rivaled Marlon Brando. But he could have just as easily declined into another Anthony Franciosa or Robert Blake. Sadly, we'll never know.\n\nPerhaps just as sadly, we know eactly where Borgnine's abilities leveled out. He gave a moving performance as Marty but after his Oscar win, he settled into a busy, though unremarkable career as a character actor best known for the sitcom McHale's Navy; his place in the pantheon of Oscar winners is an undeniable aberration. He was nominated alongside Hollywood heavyweights like Frank Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm and James Cagney in Love Me or Leave Me, but we can still see Borgnine riding the popularity of Marty's coat tails to Oscar gold. Even adding non-nominated actors like Henry Fonda in Mister Roberts, Robert Mitchum in Night of the Hunter, Glenn Ford in Blackboard Jungle and Tom Ewell in The Seven Year Itch into the field, Borgnine seems like a reasonable choice among some tough competition. But his David can't stand up to the Goliath of Spencer Tracy, considered by many to be the screen's greatest actor (at least until the coming of Marlon Brando). Tracy's performance in Bad Day at Black Rock as a one-armed man out to discover a small town's closely-guarded secret has proved to be one of his most enduring roles and a master class in film acting. Ironically, Borgnine also appeared in Bad Day at Black Rock, but you can be forgiven if you didn't remember that. Compared to Tracy, Borgnine was like a boxer competing way out of his weight class.\n\nAfter selecting two small-scale films for the Best Picture Oscar in 1954 and 1955, the Academy went back to the \"bigger is better\" line of thinking, selecting the widescreen extravaganza Around the World in 80 Days. It was a popular choice that received most of the other year-end awards as well, although now the film seems like little more than an overlong travelogue without any real entertainment value or dramatic resonance. Phineas Fogg & Company's episodic adventures fail to build on each other to create anything like a story and Fogg resolves every obstacle that confronts him in the same unimaginative way: by throwing money at it. The film's convention of featuring well-known actors in \"cameo\" roles (a clever gimmick of famous faces appearing in walk-on parts) is a fun innovation, but hardly enough to give it Best Picture consideration over other nominees that included the epic soap opera Giant, the enjoyably outlandish Biblical super-production The Ten Commandments, the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical The King and I, and William Wyler's gentle drama about a Quaker family, Friendly Persuasion. The latter blew the lid off the award when blacklisted writer Michael Wilson was nominated, violating the new Academy rule that prevented accused Reds of receiving nominations so that the official Academy roles listed the film as being nominated, but decreeing that \"writer Michael Wilson was ineligible under Academy bylaws.\" Wilson didn't receive credit on another motion picture screenplay for ten years, although he did win an Oscar for the script of The Bridge on the River Kwai (with co-writer Carl Foreman) in 1957 using Pierre Boulle, the writer of the original novel, as a front.\n\nThe Academy might have saved themselves some trouble by nominating some vastly superior films that weren't so steeped in controversy. Akira Kurasawa's The Seven Samurai was the finest film released in the US, but it never had a chance for the Best Picture Oscar (it would still be another thirteen years before the Academy broke the precedent it had set with a nomination for a foreign film with La Grande Illusion), although it did receive nominations for black and white art direction and costume design. The other great masterpiece of 1956 was John Ford's The Searchers, which strangely did not receive a single nomination despite its spectacular cinematography and the greatest performance of John Wayne's career. Overlooked in its own time, The Searchers is now considered one of the greatest films in the history of the cinema.\n\nWorst Award\n\nProducer Mike Todd tried to give humorist S.J. Perelman the sole credit for writing the screenplay to Around the World in 80 Days, feeling that it would give the enterprise more prestige. The Writer's Guild intervened, and co-writers James Poe and John Farrow were not only given screen credit, but the three shared the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. In fact, Around the World in 80 Days' tedious screenplay is the worst thing about it; an endless series of dull episodes that don't make up any real dramatic structure. Far superior adaptations were supplied by Michael Wilson for Friendly Persuasion, but he was ruled ineligible for the award because of a new Oscar bylaw that ruled anyone who \"had admitted Communist Party membership and has not renounced that membership, if he has refused to testify before a Congressional Committee or if he has refused to respond to a subpoena from such committee\" ineligible; and from Frank S. Nugent for The Searchers, Ray Bradbury and John Huston for Moby Dick, Philip Yordan for The Harder They Fall, Abe Burrows for The Solid Gold Cadillac, and Æneas MacKenzie, Jesse L. Lasky Jr., Jack Gariss and Fredric M. Frank for The Ten Commandments; none of which was even nominated. The final winner probably should have been The Searchers, although it would have been a source of guilty pleasure to see The Ten Commandments take the award home. Any screenwriter with the guts to write a line like \"Oh, Moses, Moses, why of all men did I fall in love with a prince of fools?\" deserves some recognition.\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai was so overwhelmingly the selection as best film of the year in 1957 by the people who handed out year-end awards that films would proudly advertise when they came in as runner-up in the voting, and it is a clear winner in the Hindsight Awards as well. David Lean's drama based on Pierre Boulle's novel featured a brilliant cast and a marvelous screenplay by Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman (who used Boulle as a front after being blacklisted by Joseph McCarthy) and remains today as the definitive prisoner of war film ever made. It also had a marvelous cast in William Holden, Jack Hawkins, and a star-making turn by Alec Guinness as the leader of the prisoners who becomes more obsessed with completing the bridge than his Japanese captors, which won every year-end film award despite the fact that he was only the third choice for the role after Noël Coward and Charles Laughton. The Bridge on the River Kwai was named Best Picture by the National Board of Review, the BAFTAs, the Golden Globes, the New York Film Critics, and won seven Oscars, including Best Pictures.\n\nWith such an open-and-shut case for the Best Picture, it seems appropriate to analyze the other nominees, which were Peyton Place, Sayonara, 12 Angry Men, and Witness for the Prosecution. Of these four, only the powerful 12 Angry Men (although dated by virtue of its all-white all-male jury) and Billy Wilder's delightful adaptation of Agatha Christie's Witness for the Prosecution still pack enough punch to warrant a nomination. Were the finalists announced today, the final two spots would be taken by Elia Kazan's indictment of the entertainment industry A Face in the Crowd (featuring an anti-Mayberry characterization from the underrated Andy Griffith) and Alexander Mackendrick's exposé of the public relations industry, The Sweet Smell of Success.\n\nMGM commissioned the lavish film musical Gigi from the creative team that crafted the most popular stage musical of the 1950s, My Fair Lady. The result was another sumptuous Pygmalion story of a young woman who balks at being forced to fit into a mold in order to make her way in polite society. The film was a smash hit and won a record number of Academy Awards in 1958 (9 - a record that would stand for exactly one year), and its easy to see why. Elaborately produced with high pedigree talent, it excelled in all the areas that the Oscars recognize. But as skillfully made as it is, viewing the film does leave one with a somewhat empty feeling; sort of like receiving an impeccably wrapped gift that contains a present you don't find terribly interesting (the perennial \"Thank Heavens for Little Girls\" comes off as nothing short of creepy now). A better choice for Best Picture among the nominees would have been Stanley Kramer's powerful though heavy-handed plea for racial equality The Defiant Ones or Richard Brooks' sanitized film of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, featuring a brilliant supporting performance by Burl Ives as Big Daddy that was mistakenly classified in the Best Actor category so that it didn't get the recognition it deserved (the Academy made it up to Ives by naming him Best Supporting Actor for playing a similar role in The Big Country).\n\nBut the most enduring film of 1958 came from the Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock: Vertigo. Hitchcock was never taken seriously enough to win the Best Director Oscar (his Rebecca was named Best Picture of 1940, but the Best Director Oscar went to John Ford for The Grapes of Wrath), but his films of the 1950s (Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, North by Northwest) are among the most memorable of the decade. Vertigo, the mind-numbing tale of a San Francisco detective suffering from acrophobia who becomes obsessed with the object of his investigation, topped them all, featuring one of James Stewart's finest performances and the best work of Kim Novak's career. It was, regrettably, the final collaboration of Hitchcock and Stewart when the director unfairly blamed his star for the film's poor box office showing and refused to work with him again. Its reputation has skyrocketed in the ensuing decades, and Site & Sound Magazine crowned it as the greatest film ever made in its most recent once-a-decade listing of the top cinematic achievement, taking the top spot that had been previously held by Citizen Kane.\n\nBiggest Oversight\n\nAlfred Hitchcock was nominated for the Best Director Oscar five times (Rebecca, Lifeboat, Spellbound, Rear Window, and Psycho), never winning in spite of his singular style that makes many classify him as one of the great directors in history. Overlooked in its initial release (it received a solitary nomination for Best Sound),Vertigo is now regarded as one of the most complex and suspenseful films in the Hitchcock canon. Hitchcock blamed the financial failure of Vertigo on the waning box office pull of star James Stewart (who offers what may be the most mulifaceted performance of his career), but the film was really ahead of its time and challenged audiences with many of its surreal elements and intricate plot twists which now seem far more compelling than the well-dressed fluff of Gigi or Separate Tables. Hitchcock stayed at the top of his game for a couple of more years, turning out the classics North by Northwest and Psycho, but it wouldn't be long before he started to believe all the nonsense the auteurists started saying about him and his work took a downward turn that he would never return from. But with Vertigo he was still at his unpretentious best, and deserved the Best Director Oscar that had always been denied him.\n\nBen Hur won more Academy Awards than any other film and although its record total has since been equaled by Titanic and The Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King, its stranglehold on the movie prizes in 1959 is understandable - it's so big a presentation that it just seems like the best the year had to offer. With its cast of thousands and epic production values, it is as dazzling now as when it first premiered despite such curious casting choices as Welshman Hugh Griffith as an Arab and ulta-WASP Charlton Heston as Judah Ben Hur (whose most famous roles as Ben Hur and Moses depict the two most non-Jewish Jews in cinema history), both of whom won Academy Awards for performances that can be charitably described as self-indulgently theatrical. But what Ben Hur lacks in subtle humanity, it makes up for in spectacle, with its celebrated chariot race being justifiably canonized as one of the most exciting action sequences ever filmed. It can be argued that The Diary of Anne Frank or Anatomy of a Murder carry more dramatic punch or that Some Like It Hot or the unnominated North by Northwest are more entertaining, but few films are as impressive for the shear spectacle of their presentation as Ben Hur. Anyone who has seen the film only on television might yawn at the choice; but seen on the big screen, Ben Hur continues to impress."
