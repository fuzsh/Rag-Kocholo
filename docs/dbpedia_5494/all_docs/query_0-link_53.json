        "text": "5. Henry Fonda in The Grapes of Wrath (1940)\n\nHis competition...\n\nCharlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator\n\nRaymond Massey, Abe Lincoln in Illinois\n\nLaurence Olivier, Rebecca\n\nJames Stewart, The Philadelphia Story (WINNER)\n\nFonda portrays Tom Joad, a parolee who ventures home, only to find his family's farm has been seized by the bank. Determined to find a better life, the Joads load up their truck and head west to California. On the road, they come across countless other families chasing the elusive dream of prosperity but, upon arriving in the Golden State, find the promised land doesn't exactly hold the riches they anticipated. The Joads' quest for success is made all the more challenging when Tom gets into trouble at one of the migrant camps they briefly settle in. This performance marked Fonda's first Oscar nomination.\n\nYou know what I sometimes forget and am always flabbergasted to rediscover? Fonda, despite one of the all-time great careers on the silver screen, was merely a two-time Oscar nominee for his acting (in addition to a nomination for producing 12 Angry Men and earning an honorary prize at the 1980 ceremony). He would of course go on to triumph on that second nomination, in Best Actor for On Golden Pond, but victory surely should have arrived four decades earlier, on his first Oscar appearance, for The Grapes of Wrath.\n\nFonda as Tom Joad, like so many performances on this list, is hardly the most extravagant of portrayals, with one tantalizing \"Oscar scene\" after another. That is hardly to say, however, it's not a completely pitch-perfect, lived-in and sublime turn, which also has the great fortune of gracing one of the finest of all American pictures - so significant, it was among the first batch of films selected for preservation by the the Library of Congress.\n\nBrooding, yet headstrong, Fonda is a powerful presence throughout the picture, at once impossible to take your eyes off of, yet also allowing for his co-stars, namely the brilliant (and deservedly Oscar-winning) Jane Darwell, to shimmer alongside him. The picture sports one of the most splendid film ensembles from this era, with each masterful actor having a chance to shine. Even so, leading man Fonda is of course MVP.\n\nIf Tom is exasperated over his family's exhausting ordeal, he buries such vexation and charges forward, desperate to at last land the Joads in a stable environment, with reliable work and pay. There is one daunting obstacle after another in these camps and, while the most strenuous of struggles, these experiences also instill in Tom a worldliness that will forever change his mission in life.\n\nFonda has countless affecting moments in The Grapes of Wrath, the best tending to come opposite Darwell, like their heavenly final dance together and her unsuccessful pleading for him to stay with the family. He most soars, however, in his big monologue toward the picture's conclusion, as Tom tells his fellow Joads he will be leaving to join the social justice movement and support the limitless families, just like the Joads, who have been floundering in these impossible times. It is truly among the most inspiring scenes ever captured on film.\n\nAs noted in my write-up of Chaplin, of the 1940 Best Actor nominees, critics were most fond of him and Fonda, with the former all but taking himself out of competition by protesting the ceremony. The winner, however, would be Stewart, no doubt helped by headlining not one, not two but four motion pictures that year.\n\nThis was one heck of a line-up, with Stewart a delight, Chaplin phenomenal and Olivier in expert form too (Massey, while amusing, seems to think he's still playing to the last row of the balcony). None of those fine actors, however, can quite touch Fonda, one of the silver screen's most marvelous leading men, at the very, very top of his game. The performance and the picture are timeless.\n\n4. Juanita Moore in Imitation of Life (1959)\n\nHer competition...\n\nHermione Baddeley, Room at the Top\n\nSusan Kohner, Imitation of Life\n\nThelma Ritter, Pillow Talk\n\nShelley Winters, The Diary of Anne Frank (WINNER)\n\nMoore portrays Annie Johnson, an African-American single mother who befriends Lora Meredith (Lana Turner), a white single mom and aspiring Broadway actress. Both of their daughters, Annie's Sarah Jane (Susan Kohner) and Lora's Susie (Sandra Dee), are a handful. While Susie pines for Lora's dashing boyfriend Steve (John Gavin), Sarah Jane loathes being black and, given her light skin, is determined to pass for white. Her behavior leaves Annie consumed with shame and sorrow. This performance marked Moore's first and only Oscar nomination.\n\nOver the 20 years prior to her gut-wrenching breakthrough in Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life, Moore largely languished in film obscurity, on four occasions portraying a maid, three times a 'nightclub patron' and more than a dozen times roles so minuscule, she went uncredited. For Sirk's final Hollywood production, he took a chance on Moore, who to date hadn't been blessed with a role much flexing her acting muscles, for the pivotal role of Annie Johnson.\n\nThe result? The greatest performance ever nominated in Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThe sad thing is, at the time, Moore didn't have much of a prayer for victory. Sure, there was some vote-splitting potential with co-star Kohner but more damaging, Imitation of Life wasn't terribly well-received by critics upon its theatrical release, with many writing it off as a saccharine soap opera. What probably got Moore and Kohner over the finish line for their nominations, in addition to Best Supporting Actress otherwise being a rather ho-hum affair in 1959, was the immense commercial success of the picture, which managed to outpace the likes of Anatomy of a Murder and North by Northwest at the box office.\n\nThe Winters victory was scant surprise. Still looked upon as a blonde bombshell, she was lauded by critics and stunned audiences with her deglamming in Best Picture nominee The Diary of Anne Frank. Baddeley graced a Best Picture contender as well but was never going to win for a three-minute performance, nor was Ritter about to triumph for a fluffy romcom like Pillow Talk. Ritter, at this point on her fifth nomination, may have been plenty due for victory but Pillow Talk was not the vehicle seen as delivering that elusive win.\n\nLike other Sirk productions, Imitation of Life would not be deemed the masterpiece it's seen as today until much later in the 20th century, as contemporary critics reevaluated the picture and lavished praise upon its sumptuous look and feel and devastating performances. While marketed upon its release as a Turner film, nearly everyone today agrees Kohner and especially Moore completely steal the picture from under her, the Turner-Dee dynamic not a tenth as riveting as Moore and Kohner.\n\nOn the page, Annie Johnson is written in a tenuous, mawkish way that, you would think, could translate to disaster on the screen - let's face it, the strongest parts of Sirk productions are never the screenplays. Yet, under his expert direction and with the overwhelming compassion and heartache Moore instills in the role, Annie emerges one of the most tragic sights ever seen on film. Moore shatters your heart in the most nuanced of fashions. It also sure doesn't hurt that she graces the screen for nearly half the picture and at times feels like a co-lead.\n\nMoore's Annie makes it her mission in life to please those around her. Such is an easy task with Turner's Lora, who comes to see Annie as an essential presence in her life. Less simple is satisfying Sarah Jane, an insufferable daughter who makes Ann Blyth in Mildred Pierce look like a walk in the park.\n\nAnnie has the biggest of hearts, so it's downright traumatic watching her gradually whittle away, persistently sacrificing everything for her daughter and getting no love back in return. Her unconditional endearment for Sarah Jane evolves into a sea of emotions, from rage over her daughter's choices to concern she may forever lose her This culminates in their painful final scene together, in which Annie reiterates she will do nothing that gets in the way of Sarah Jane's happiness - she'll even pretend she's not her mother, if need be.\n\nThank heavens for this performance. It's the quintessential example of an actor and director taking the wispiest of roles and turning it into gold. That Moore had spent her entire career to this point relegated to bit roles makes her accomplishment all the more astounding.\n\n3. Montgomery Clift in A Place in the Sun (1951)\n\nHis competition...\n\nHumphrey Bogart, The African Queen (WINNER)\n\nMarlon Brando, A Streetcar Named Desire\n\nArthur Kennedy, Bright Victory\n\nFredric March, Death of a Salesman\n\nClift portrays George Eastman, the outcast nephew of wealthy industrialist Charles (Herbert Heyes) who abandons his destitute existence in Chicago to work for his uncle in California. There, he climbs up the company's ranks and becomes romantically involved with co-worker Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters). At a lavish party thrown by his uncle, George falls heads over heels for the enchanting socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor), who introduces him to the area's high society. George is enraptured by his opulent new lifestyle and companion - a development thrown for a loop by Alice's revelation that she is pregnant with George's child. This performance marked Clift's second Oscar nomination.\n\nToday, A Place in the Sun, director George Stevens' masterpiece and the career-best vehicle for stars Clift and Winters, is mostly, tragically a forgotten picture. Generally overshadowed by another big Oscar winner from 1951 (A Streetcar Named Desire), the film was dropped by the American Film Institute in its 2007 update of its list of the 100 greatest American motion pictures of all-time. No surprise, it is absent from IMDb's list of the 250 top-rated films. More stunningly, it inexplicably sports a mere 75 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWhat is wrong with people?!\n\nUpon its theatrical release, A Place in the Sun was in fact a mammoth critical and commercial success. Charlie Chaplin spoke for countless movie buffs when he proclaimed the film \"the greatest movie ever made about America.\" While it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the decidedly splashier An American in Paris, it tied the Vincente Minnelli film in wins (six) and outpaced Streetcar's showing (four victories) on the big night.\n\nCatapulted into movie super stardom was Clift, who five years earlier moved out to Hollywood and secured one splendid project after another - the likes of Red River, The Search and The Heiress. He had dashing matinee idol looks with awe-inspiring acting chops to set him apart from the ordinary silver screen pretty boy. While Clift proved himself an exemplary screen presence in The Search, which earned him his first Best Actor nomination, it was A Place in the Sun that provided him the grandest opportunity to flex those muscles as an actor. The result would be the greatest male performance ever recognized by the Academy.\n\nClift sends you into a heavenly trance from the moment he graces the screen, his physical appearance striking as can be but with immense depth clearly present under the handsome surface. With Stevens' camera madly in love with the star, Clift's face shimmers and sparkles, oozing so much beauty that it's all too easy to overlook George's faults. And when Clift shares the spotlight with Taylor, who also has never looked more fetching, it's almost too much perfection to handle.\n\nFor such an alluring man, Clift also exudes so much vulnerability as George, a lost soul who's ditched his poor life back home for a chance at prosperity many, many miles away. His lack of confidence makes the predicament he finds himself in all the more distressing. And though George may sometimes act in the most detestable of ways, Clift fills the character with ample warmth and heart. His sweetness stays with you, even as George skids off the tracks into oblivion.\n\nAs Clift did with countless directors over his career, he had the occasional quarrel with Stevens, who sometimes craved from the actor showier displays of emotion. To Clift, however, that was all wrong - his portrayal of George needed to be restrained and natural. Instead, for instance, of chewing scenery at the 11-'o-clock-hour as George walks to his death in the electric chair, Clift looks all too convincing, solemn and vividly anguished with regret.\n\nOscar night attendees, including ultimate winner Bogart, were said to have been convinced Brando had it in the bag. Even Clift said he cast his vote for the Streetcar star. Alas, the champion would be the sentimental favorite.\n\nPerhaps Brando and Clift, the method actor newcomers, split the vote in some way. No doubt, Brando also wasn't helped by his refusal to campaign the picture for awards consideration and wariness of actors competing with one another for prizes. Three years later, Brando would campaign and emerge victorious for On the Waterfront.\n\nThis was one hell of a category, with March in prime form too. But no one, in my humble opinion at least, comes close to Clift, not even Brando. He's the most mesmerizing of sights from start to finish, exuding boundless charisma while carefully crafting an absorbing character who, in lesser hands, could have been a far less compelling figure. Clift would go on to deliver several more great performances but none quite at the same unconquerable level as A Place in the Sun.\n\n2. Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter (1946)\n\nHer competition...\n\nOlivia de Havilland, To Each His Own (WINNER)\n\nJennifer Jones, Duel in the Sun\n\nRosalind Russell, Sister Kenny\n\nJane Wyman, The Yearling\n\nJohnson portrays Laura Jesson, a restless suburban housewife whose marriage to Fred (Cyril Raymond), while amiable, has left her emotionally unfulfilled. Amidst her routine of spending one day a week in a nearby town to shop and take in a movie, she meets Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard), a kind and handsome doctor who, like Laura, is married and has children. Enchanted with each other's company, their casual friendship gradually develops into something much more as Laura and Alec realize they've fallen in love. The closer they get, the more agonizing their union becomes, knowing they'll surely never actually leave their respective spouses. This performance marked Johnson's first and only Oscar nomination.\n\nOver the two decades prior to her awe-inspiring silver screen turn in David Lean's Brief Encounter, Johnson was the toast of the London theatre scene, appearing in a plethora of productions, including headlining the likes of Pride and Prejudice and Rebecca. She even briefly appeared on Broadway, taking on the role of Ophelia in a revival of Hamlet.\n\nThen came World War II. During this time, Johnson lived with her widowed sister and sister-in-law, assisting them in the care of their combined seven children. Now unable to devote time to eight shows a week, Johnson turned to radio and film. Taking a liking to the stage star was Lean who, at this early stage in his career, was known exclusively as a film editor. Lean cast Johnson in his directorial debut, In Which We Serve, which earned an Oscar nomination in Best Picture.\n\nLean and Johnson would collaborate twice more during their lives, first on This Happy Breed and finally, most memorably, on Brief Encounter.\n\nBy this point, Johnson was completely swamped at home and more hesitant than ever to take on additional work. The script, however, adapted from Noel Coward's play Still Life, was just too sublime to pass up. And thank heavens she didn't. (Though, following Brief Encounter, moviegoers would need to wait five years to see Johnson again grace the screen.)\n\nA far cry from the comedies Coward was so renowned for, Brief Encounter is the most devastating of affairs, sensitively directed by Lean (much in the same careful fashion he later approached Summertime) and exquisitely performed by Howard and especially the picture's leading lady.\n\nEven in moments devoid of dialogue, Johnson is able to say so much through those big, captivating eyes, keeping us attune to the roller coaster ride of emotions Laura is going through - it's like watching lightning strike the moment we see her realization that she's fallen for Alec. This is one of those rare, magical performances that could have succeeded just as splendidly in a silent film as a talking picture.\n\nJohnson paints Laura as a woman who, in a different environment, could be wholeheartedly thriving. Alas, she clearly loathes the spiteful women who socially surround her and isn't terribly keen on middle-class suburbia in general. Laura hardly hates Fred - he's a good-natured, honest man - but recognizes, tragically too late in their marriage, that there's no real romance there.\n\nLaura has no doubt spent ages in this painful state of longing and only with the entrance of Alec, with whom she does share an intense sensual feeling, do those repressed emotions at last erupt to the surface. Like Hepburn in Summertime, the restrained nature of Johnson's performance makes it all the more powerful and heartbreaking.\n\nWith that said, what were Johnson's odds on Oscar night? Not bad, considering the category was without a real front-runner. With the exceptions of Jones, whose picture was lambasted by the critics (her recent divorce, the result of an affair with producer David O. Selznick, probably didn't help matters either), and Wyman, whose recognition rang of a coattail nomination, a plausible case could have been made for any of de Havilland, Johnson or Russell.\n\nUltimately, the winner would be de Havilland who, by age 30, was already seen as an old pro in the business, at this point on her third nomination. De Havilland's in fine form, so you won't see me bashing her victory, other than to say Johnson is of course much better.\n\nPerhaps the quiet, small-scale nature of Brief Encounter did her in, or maybe her paltry name recognition in Hollywood, or a combo of both. Whatever the contributions to her loss, it's a damn shame Johnson did not emerge victorious on Oscar night. It's the most breathtaking of performances recognized by the Academy, second only to the greatest of them all...\n\n1. Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974)\n\nHer competition...\n\nEllen Burstyn, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (WINNER)\n\nDiahann Carroll, Claudine\n\nFaye Dunaway, Chinatown\n\nValerie Perrine, Lenny\n\nRowlands portrays Mabel Longhetti, a lonesome Los Angeles housewife who is desperate to please husband Nick (Peter Falk) and their three children. Nick loves Mabel but is concerned about her increasingly outlandish and unpredictable behavior. Convinced she poses a threat to both herself and the family, Nick reluctantly institutionalizes her. After a six-month treatment, Mabel returns home but is hardly prepared, emotionally or mentally, for a seamless reintegration. This performance marked Rowlands' first Oscar nomination.\n\nWell, at last, here it is - for my money, the most extraordinary turn to ever earn an Oscar nomination. To know it was a miracle A Woman Under the Influence came to fruition at all makes Rowlands' tour de force one to even more treasure.\n\nThe picture, after all, was initially designed by John Cassavetes as a play. The material, as challenging and intense as what would ultimately be seen on film, was deemed by Rowlands as just too much to pull off, without herself suffering a nervous breakdown, eight shows a week. So, Cassavetes tailored his tale of Mabel Longhetti to the screen.\n\nDespite the critical success he and wife Rowlands earned on their prior collaborations - A Child Is Waiting, Faces and Minnie and Moskowitz - no studio was willing to bite on A Woman Under the Influence and its exploration of an unstable, middle-aged housewife. In part rescuing the project was none other than Falk, who loved Cassavetes' screenplay so much that he invested half a million into the production - and would, of course, go on to land the crucial role of Nick.\n\nWithout a distributor, it was up to Cassavetes to call theatre owners and art houses to get A Woman Under the Influence before an audience. Word about Rowlands' master class in acting spread rapidly and, by the end of Oscar season, even as she failed to win the Best Actress prize, the film made back more than six times its budget.\n\nWhile Cassavetes worked wonders in generating box office success for the film, the lack of an awards season campaign by a major studio perhaps played some role in Rowlands' Oscar loss (as, no doubt, did the traumatic nature of the film). Burstyn and her picture had Warner Bros. behind them, Dunaway had Paramount, Carroll was in a 20th Century Fox film and Perrine (who insisted on a Lead campaign when she surely could've won in Supporting) had United Artists.\n\nInstead of standing tall as category front-runner, which should've been the case, Rowlands was seen as being in a tight three-way race with Burstyn and Dunaway. Likely putting Burstyn over the top, in addition to being on her third Oscar nomination, were the raves she simultaneously received for her Broadway turn in Same Time, Next Year, the production which prevented her from attending the ceremony. It's conceivable New York voters came in strong for Burstyn, who would go on to also score the Tony that year.\n\nThis may have been a fabulous line-up (Carroll is terrific too) but Rowlands is truly in a league of her own. If Burstyn wasn't in such fine form, I wouldn't hesitate in the slightest to classify this as among the all-time worst Oscar decisions.\n\nTo merely label A Woman Under the Influence as depressing would be an understatement. It's perhaps the most taxing and devastating of cinematic experiences, a portrait of a woman and her family in pandemonium that rings both bizarre and all too true. Never before or after has mental illness been portrayed so vividly on the screen, its horror and ugliness on evocative display.\n\nRowlands, in a role that to the average actor, on paper, would seem all but impossible to effectively portray, is absolutely fearless as Mabel. Never is there a false note as Rowlands chaotically veers from terror to rage to revulsion to wholehearted love and devotion. At once, she can be both horrifying and irresistible. She's an erratic force of nature, with one surprise after another up her sleeve. For every moment she's thunderous and unhinged, there's another in which she is subdued to the point of speechlessness.\n\nA performance for the ages that continues to stun nearly 50 years since first gracing the screen, Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence is the crème de la crème, perhaps the most magnificent piece of acting ever captured on film and, at the very least, the finest turn recognized at the Oscars.\n\nThe Oscar 100:\n\n1.

Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) (WINNER)\n\nHis competition...\n\nWalter Matthau, The Sunshine Boys\n\nAl Pacino, Dog Day Afternoon\n\nMaximilian Schell, The Man in the Glass Booth\n\nJames Whitmore, Give 'em Hell, Harry!\n\nNicholson portrays Randle Patrick McMurphy, a free-spirited criminal who, once again in trouble with the law, pleads insanity to avoid prison and is instead sent to a mental institution for evaluation. There, he befriends the hospital's motley crew of patients, winning them over with an unconstrained spirit sorely lacking in the facility. Not so fond of McMurphy's behavior is the frosty Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), wary of the new resident shaking up the stability she's established on her ward. This performance marked Nicholson's fifth Oscar nomination and first win.\n\nBy 1975, with a quartet of Oscar nominations and losses under his belt, Nicholson unbelievably found himself on the same track as the likes of Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole - without a win soon, he could very well end up among the all-time Oscar losers.\n\nSo, no doubt determined to at large emerge victorious, Nicholson signed on to not one, not two but four ambitious projects for '75. One, the screwball comedy The Fortune, was, despite the presence of director Mike Nichols and co-star Warren Beatty, an embarrassing flop. Another, Tommy, was a commercial success but merely found Nicholson in a cameo role, as \"The Specialist.\" The Passenger was met to immense critical acclaim but failed to resonate with American moviegoers like it so splendidly did with attendees at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nLast, but most certainly not least, was One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture that spent years struggling to get off the ground.\n\nFor nearly a decade, Kirk Douglas, who originated the role of McMurphy on Broadway and owned the film rights to the story, tried, to no avail, to get a movie adaptation going. There came a point when Kirk opted to pass the rights along to son Michael, who, unlike his father, was able to secure financing for the picture. By this point, however, Kirk was too old to reprise his role, so the search began for a new McMurphy.\n\nUltimately, the suggestion of Nicholson came from Hal Ashby, who'd earlier directed him to an Oscar nomination for The Last Detail and, with the success of Shampoo in 1975, was hot and influential as ever. Nicholson jumped on board and the rest is history.\n\nNot only would Nicholson deliver a career-best performance, at last taking home that elusive Oscar, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ended up steamrolling on the big night, staging the first clean sweep of the big five categories (Best Picture/Director/Lead Actor/Lead Actress/Screenplay) since It Happened One Night in 1934.\n\nOver the decades to follow, Nicholson would turn in a plethora of memorable performances but none at the same sky-high level as Cuckoo's Nest.\n\nThe mere thought of Nicholson as McMurphy puts a big smile on my face...before sending a lump down my throat. It's a force of nature turn full of effervescent vitality, his jubilation and humanity making McMurphy's ultimate demise all the more devastating. Nicholson has one knockout scene after another with his remarkable cast, from Will Sampson as the daunting, perplexing Chief to the Oscar-nominated Brad Dourif as the sweet, fragile Billy. It's one of the all-time great ensembles of the big screen.\n\nOf course, there is also Nicholson's stirring sparring with Fletcher, blood-curling as the inimitable Nurse Ratched, hellbent on sucking the life out of her new patient and bringing an end to the euphoria McMurphy suddenly instilled in the ward. Both actors wisely underplay their resentment toward each other, until it finally bursts to the surface in their savage showdown near the film's conclusion.\n\nI have to imagine audiences in the 1970s responded to Nicholson's work much in the same way moviegoers did Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift in the 1950s. It's as if he invented a whole new level of magnetism, never before seen on the screen. And much like Brando and Clift at their best, Nicholson at his finest, in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, continues to feel fresh and revolutionary to this day.\n\n9. Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard (1950)\n\nHer competition...\n\nAnne Baxter, All About Eve\n\nBette Davis, All About Eve\n\nJudy Holliday, Born Yesterday (WINNER)\n\nEleanor Parker, Caged\n\nSwanson portrays Norma Desmond, once a superstar of silent film but now isolated from the outside world, residing in her decaying mansion on Sunset Boulevard alongside protective butler and driver Max Von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Though she hasn't worked in ages, Norma is convinced she will someday make a grand return to the silver screen. So, when struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) enters her life and agrees to be script doctor on her dream comeback vehicle about Salome, Norma sees stardom on the horizon. It isn't long before Norma falls in love with her handsome visitor - an infatuation soon tested by Joe's affection for fellow young scribe Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson). This performance marked Swanson's third and final Oscar nomination.\n\n\"The greatest star of them all,\" indeed.\n\n1950 Best Actress is a legendary affair for Oscar aficionados, the presumed Davis vs. Swanson barn burner instead upset by Holliday, gracing the one comedy of the quintet. It's tough to much bash Holliday's victory, given what a delight she is in Born Yesterday, but it's even harder to stomach Swanson not winning the prize for such a monumental performance.\n\nOn the big night, Holliday and Swanson were in fact together in New York, listening to the broadcast over the radio. Suffice to say, while she didn't go on a Norma Desmondesque tirade, Swanson was not very happy. Where a win would have propelled Swanson back on the Hollywood A-list for years to come, with no shortage of parts coming her way, a mere nomination resulted in negligible future success. She would have one more, final leading role in an American production - portraying, once again, a fading film star, in 3 for Bedroom C - before turning her attention to guest spots on the small screen. An attempt to get a Sunset Boulevard musical off the ground for Broadway never came to fruition for Swanson, though would of course much later see the light of day through Andrew Lloyd Webber.\n\nSunset Boulevard may not have paid the dividends for Swanson as she may have hoped but such hardly diminishes the fact that this is one of the most electrifying performances ever captured on film, a riveting, all too convincing portrayal of a woman who is both deranged and irresistible.\n\nIncredibly, Swanson was not writer/director Billy Wilder's first or even second choice for Norma. Wilder first approached Polish film star Pola Negri for the role and later Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer. When they didn't pan out, Wilder sought the counsel of director George Cukor, who suggested Swanson for the part - she was, after all, like Norma, a once-beloved star of silent film who struggled to make the transition into talking pictures.\n\nSwanson was hardly a demented lunatic like Norma but, over her countless appearances on the screen, had more than showcased her acting chops (and earned a pair of Oscar nominations in the process). Much to her chagrin, Swanson was forced to do a screen test for Paramount. No surprise, however, it went splendidly. She was everything Wilder, producer/co-writer Charles Brackett and the studio dreamed of for Norma.\n\nUnlike Davis' Margo Channing in All About Eve, a woman who fears facing reality, Swanson's Norma is altogether incapable of seeing it. She's wrapped up in her own world of make-believe, convinced she's still worshiped by countless fans, who supposedly write her one adoring letter after another (all of which, in actuality, are penned by Max). Secluded from the world and living out her days watching old movies headlined by herself, Norma has driven herself into delusional madness.\n\nSwanson's approach to Norma couldn't be more perfect. She wholeheartedly gets what Wilder is going for, that blend of Hollywood satire and jaw-dropping drama that, in other, lesser hands, could have played as overwrought and unconvincing. Swanson towers over the proceedings with a performance that, while elaborate and larger than life, always feels just enough grounded in reality. One moment, Swanson commands the screen with an awe-inspiring fierceness that feels unconquerable. The next, however, she can instill Norma with a sad fragility that makes her look anything but immortal. Her experience in silent cinema works wonders here, with those big, bulging eyes and batty facial expressions making Norma all the more captivating and bizarre a sight to behold. Wilder also provides Swanson no shortage of opportunity to show off both her comic and romantic sides, her chemistry with fellow Oscar 100 inductee Holden potent as ever.\n\nWhen Norma returns to Paramount for the first time in years, convinced she'll be meeting with Cecil B. DeMille about her Salome project, she is swarmed by cast and crew, particularly the older studio employees, delighted to see her back where she belongs. As a viewer, you're liable to try jumping into the screen to join them, not to fawn over Norma but rather worship Swanson, who as Norma delivers one of the most outrageously brilliant performances to ever grace the screen.\n\n8. Shirley Booth in Come Back, Little Sheba (1952) (WINNER)\n\nHer competition...\n\nJoan Crawford, Sudden Fear\n\nBette Davis, The Star\n\nJulie Harris, The Member of the Wedding\n\nSusan Hayward, With a Song in My Heart\n\nBooth portrays Lola Delaney, a woman who masks her intense misery with the most cheerful of demeanors. She's in an increasingly passionless marriage to Doc (Burt Lancaster), who's resented Lola ever since she got pregnant and he dropped out of medical school, only for her to suffer a miscarriage. Not only has Lola never fully recovered, she's also anguished with grief over the recent loss of her beloved dog, Sheba. The entrance of young new tenant Marie (Terry Moore) and her dashing boy toy Turk (Richard Jaeckel) brings the couple's long-suppressed emotions bursting to the surface. This performance marked Booth's first and only Oscar nomination and win.\n\nFrom the moment Daniel Mann's film adaptation of William Inge's acclaimed play Come Back, Little Sheba was announced, Booth was the heavy favorite to triumph in Best Actress at the Oscars. She had, after all, scored the Tony for originating the role of Lola and, though a novice to the big screen, was a titan in New York acting circles.\n\nBy the big night, Booth was not the mere front-runner but a legit shoo-in for the win. Crawford wasn't about to score a second Best Actress prize for the titillating thriller Sudden Fear, while it was a miracle Davis somehow made the cut for the critically lambasted The Star. Like Booth, Harris was making her film debut, reprising a role she began on Broadway, but The Member of the Wedding did not enjoy the commercial or critical success of Come Back, Little Sheba. Hayward, on her third nomination, was likely runner-up, albeit not a terribly close second.\n\nWhat makes Booth's triumph on the screen all the more remarkable is the lackluster nature of the proceedings around her. A master in theatre but rarely one who excelled on the screen, Mann, in his feature film debut, keeps the picture looking and feeling perpetually stagebound. In a way, such claustrophobia makes Lola's suffocating all the more palpable but otherwise, Come Back, Little Sheba just never much pops beyond Booth's harrowing turn.\n\nLikewise, given the inferiority of her co-stars, Booth all the more towers over the picture. But this also means we're stuck watching a miscast Lancaster (nearly 20 years younger than Sidney Blackmer, who played the role on Broadway and also won the Tony) and the insufferable, somehow Oscar-nominated Moore. As for Jaeckel, he provides no shortage of eye candy but otherwise has the acting prowess of a brick wall.\n\nSuch qualms aside, Booth is magnificent in this film. Rarely has a middling picture been made such an absolute must-see by a single performance.\n\nLola is a tricky character to ace and Booth finds precisely the right way to bring her to life. This is the most despondent of people, ravaged by sorrow over the loss of her precious Sheba, her miscarriage and the disintegration of her marriage. Yet, Lola refuses to let any of this anguish show, instead covering up her agony with the most merry of manners. Her attitude is aggressively ebullient to the point of lunacy and she's desperate to form a connection with anyone who crosses her path and willing to pay her the attention Doc no longer awards her. Lola has managed to make herself entirely oblivious to the heartache eating away at her from the inside.\n\nWhere Booth no doubt filled the entire Booth Theatre during the Broadway run of Come Back, Little Sheba, she masterfully tailors her portrayal for the screen, conveying Lola's mania without resorting to bombastic histrionics. With the camera zoomed in on Booth's gloriously expressive face, we see in Lola all of the anxieties and suffering that she refuses to let others recognize from afar. She's the most heartbreaking of sights, a compassionate woman who was abandoned by her own family and is now consumed with fear that the one remaining love of her life (Doc) is en route to giving up on her too.\n\nFor a woman so lost in desolation, Booth's Lola is also full of vitality - just watch her dance in that beautiful scene with Doc in the living room. For a moment, an all too fleeting one at that, life is grand again, and there are glimmers of bliss like this scattered throughout the picture that serve as proof of the love Lola and Doc, deep down, still feel for each other. Even if Lancaster never seems quite right in this role, Booth's performance is more than affecting enough to make the Lola-Doc dynamic work.\n\nFollowing her Oscar victory, Booth dabbled a bit more in film, perhaps most memorably as Dolly Gallagher Levi in The Matchmaker (which later, of course, became Hello, Dolly!), but otherwise found greater success back on Broadway, winning another Tony (this time for The Time of the Cuckoo, which later became Summertime for Katharine Hepburn on the big screen), and later in television, where she scored a pair of Emmys for her iconic turn as Hazel.\n\nTalk about one hell of a career but even so, nothing she did afterward came close to touching the brilliance on display in Come Back, Little Sheba. It's a legit master class in acting and, for my money, the greatest performance to ever take home the Best Actress Oscar.\n\n7. Anthony Hopkins in The Remains of the Day (1993)\n\nHis competition...\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis, In the Name of the Father\n\nLaurence Fishburne, What's Love Got to Do with It?\n\nTom Hanks, Philadelphia (WINNER)\n\nLiam Neeson, Schindler's List\n\nHopkins portrays James Stevens, a dedicated English butler who, in the years preceding World War II, serves the Nazi-sympathizing Lord Darlington (James Fox). Stevens' intense focus on the duties of his position is tested by the arrival of new housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson) who, while just as efficient as Stevens in tending to the household, exudes the compassion and humanity he has long repressed. Over time, Kenton develops feelings for the detached Stevens, who tragically cannot bring himself to reciprocate. This performance marked Hopkins' second Oscar nomination.\n\nWhen Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day landed on book shelves over the summer of 1989 to widespread acclaim, a film adaptation was imminent.\n\nInitially, however, it wasn't to be a Merchant Ivory production. Director Mike Nichols, then on a hot streak with lighter fare (Working Girl and Postcards from the Edge), and the much-celebrated playwright and screenwriter Harold Pinter were first attached. Nichols ultimately left the project as director, remaining on as producer, while Pinter, despite having finished the screenplay (some of which would be retained for the final product), completely disassociated himself from the production.\n\nIn came that divine trio of director James Ivory, producer Ismail Merchant and writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala - the pitch-perfect fit for this material - and the rest is history. The result, for my money at least, is the greatest of all Merchant Ivory productions, which also happens to sport a career-topping performance from the exquisite Hopkins.\n\nA far cry from the mouthwatering camera mugging of The Silence of the Lambs, Hopkins in The Remains of the Day is among the most powerfully subdued portrayals to ever grace the screen. Never has there been a more devastating sight of emotional suppression than Stevens, the all-too-loyal butler who abandons his own father on his deathbed in the name of serving a buffoonish man who is decidedly on the wrong side of history (and Stevens knows it).\n\nThe introduction of Thompson's Miss Kenton turns Stevens' world upside down - not that he'd allow those around him, especially Kenton, to know of his feelings. The most startling scene in the picture comes when Kenton catches Stevens reading a romance novel in his office. Stevens claims he's merely reading it to improve his vocabulary, understandable given the onslaught of politicians and aristocrats visiting Darlington Hall but, looking at his face and those sad eyes, it's all too clear to us what's really going on in his head.\n\nAbout 20 years later, with Darlington dead in disgrace and Stevens now serving the kind U.S. Congressman Jack Lewis (Christopher Reeve), the butler seeks out his beloved Miss Kenton, who at this point in her life is a divorced woman, with a daughter. Stevens requests that she return to Darlington Hall with him - supposedly, to serve the Congressman but, in reality, we know he desperately longs for his old companion. Kenton declines, wishing to remain close to her daughter, and one final time they share that gut-wrenching moment where she is anything but unemotional and he, despite the passion so clearly burning within him, just cannot bring himself to express his affection back.\n\n1993 marked a gangbusters year for Hopkins, who turned in not one but two Oscar-caliber leading performances, in this and in Shadowlands (both of his leading ladies, Thompson and Debra Winger, were nominated in Best Actress). Had he not just triumphed two years prior for The Silence of the Lambs, odds are he could have taken home the trophy as an honor for both of these tremendous turns. (When the critics' awards honored Hopkins, as most of them did this year, it was for both performances.)\n\nAlas, despite his raves and the healthy eight nominations for The Remains of the Day, he was a bit of an underdog going into the big night. While Philadelphia itself didn't earn the critical notices of the Ivory picture, it was far more commercially successful (and sitting atop the box office as ballots came in) and Hanks' dramatic turn was lauded, especially coming on the heels of one frothy comedy after another. While hardly a shoo-in, Hanks was well-positioned to prevail, which indeed came to fruition.\n\nMoving as Hanks is (I'm also awfully fond of Fishburne), Hopkins is for me the crystal clear winner here, a quiet tour de force, at the absolute top of his game. Watching this and The Silence of the Lambs (a delicious, if inferior performance) back-to-back would serve as an awe-inspiring testament to Hopkins as one of the finest, most multifaceted actors of the past half-century.\n\n6. Rod Steiger in The Pawnbroker (1964)\n\nHis competition...\n\nRichard Burton, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\n\nLee Marvin, Cat Ballou (WINNER)\n\nLaurence Olivier, Othello\n\nOskar Werner, Ship of Fools\n\nSteiger portrays Sol Nazerman, a morose and lonesome Jewish pawnbroker, haunted by his past. Though he survived Auschwitz, Sol witnessed his family's murder at the hands of the Nazis and ever since, has lost all faith in God and humanity. Consumed by horrifying daydreams and exclusively focused on making money, he refuses to let anyone get close to him, not even his enthusiastic assistant Jesus (Jaime Sanchez) or the friendly social worker Marilyn (Geraldine Fitzgerald). This performance marked Steiger's second Oscar nomination.\n\nIf Steiger and director Sidney Lumet were not already on the Hollywood A-list by 1964, their collaboration on The Pawnbroker firmly cemented that status.\n\nBoth first burst onto the scene around the same time, in the mid-1950s. Steiger earned himself a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for On the Waterfront and graced several other successful pictures too, among them The Big Knife and Oklahoma! Also garnering some Oscar love around this time was Lumet, who received a Best Director nomination for 12 Angry Men and subsequently went on to earn additional positive notices for the likes of The Fugitive Kind and Long Day's Journey Into Night.\n\nTheir paths had once crossed before, on the small scene, yet Lumet wasn't initially keen on Steiger for the anguished role of Sol Nazerman. The director wanted James Mason, hot as ever on the heels of Lolita. Mason never quite panned out, however, and, after additional discussions with the actor, Steiger, who was willing to take a significant pay cut for the role, was in.\n\nThe result marked the first American production to focus on the Holocaust, from the viewpoint of a survivor. Reviews for Steiger were unanimously glowing, even from Pauline Kael, who gave The Pawnbroker one of its few (only?) negative notices. Over the years to follow, despite having later won his Oscar for In the Heat of the Night, Steiger would always cite The Pawnbroker as the strongest work of his storied career.\n\nAnd he was right - not only is his turn as Sol a more compelling performance than his other Oscar-nominated/winning efforts, it's one of the very best turns ever recognized by the Academy, in any category. It's a stunningly committed portrayal of the most tormented of figures, a man who may have physically survived the horrors of the Holocaust but has lost everything that meant anything to him, including his confidence in mankind.\n\nIf the burying of feelings has Hopkins' Stevens of The Remains of the Day drowning in sadness deep down, it leaves Steiger's Sol consumed with bitterness, which he has no qualms about spreading around to those around him, even the friendliest of faces.\n\nFitzgerald's Marilyn, for instance, visits the pawn shop not for business but because she recognizes Sol's sorrow. By rejecting her outreach, he is alienating himself from the few people who see in him the benevolence that once existed (and is plenty on display, all too briefly, in the picture's opening scene). Alas, Sol is an irreparably broken man, no longer capable of such human connection. Steiger is made all the more glum in appearance by Boris Kaufman's evocative black and white photography.\n\nInexplicably, despite the universal acclaim for his performance, Steiger was not triumphant at the Oscars, nor was the brilliant Burton (who, for what it's worth, clocked in at #111 on my Oscar 100 shortlist). Instead victorious was Marvin, doing a goofy dual role in Cat Ballou.\n\nNo doubt, two things helped Marvin - one, he was the sole comic performance of the quintet and two, he also had a prominent role in Best Picture nominee Ship of Fools. No disrespect to Marvin, who had no shortage of memorable turns on the big screen, but there's just no comparing his buffoonish work in Cat Ballou to the genius of Steiger in The Pawnbroker.\n\nI guess we can at least take some solace in Olivier not winning?\n\nThe Oscar 100 (thus far)...\n\n6.

Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator (1940)\n\nHis competition...\n\nHenry Fonda, The Grapes of Wrath\n\nRaymond Massey, Abe Lincoln in Illinois\n\nLaurence Olivier, Rebecca\n\nJames Stewart, The Philadelphia Story (WINNER)\n\nChaplin portrays a Jewish barber who, in the two decades following World War I, has spent his life in an army hospital, plagued by memory loss incurred from battle wounds. Long isolated from the outside world, he has been unaware of the rise of fascist dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also Chaplin) and the anti-Semitic policies ravaging his old neighborhood. Upon leaving the hospital, he is appalled by these developments and, alongside a neighbor (Paulette Goddard) and old friend from the first war (Reginald Gardiner), determined to rebel against the power-hungry tyrant. This performance marked Chaplin's first Oscar nomination (he was also up in Best Original Screenplay).\n\nTwo years prior to the release of Ernst Lubitsch's legendary To Be or Not To Be and nearly three decades before Mel Brooks' The Producers saw the light of the day, Chaplin wrote, directed, produced and headlined the anti-Nazi satire that would forever tower over all anti-Nazi satires (and nearly all political satires, for that matter). That Chaplin delivered The Great Dictator at a time when the United States was still on formally peaceful terms with Nazi Germany makes his effort all the more astounding.\n\nChaplin's picture was nearly the first Hollywood parody of the Third Reich, beaten to theaters only by the Three Stooges' short film You Natzy Spy!, which actually went into production two months after The Great Dictator began filming. The film was a box office smash, the second-highest grossing picture of 1940 (behind Rebecca), and also resonated overseas. Besides the Lubitsch picture, however, there would hardly be an onslaught of Nazi-themed comedies over the coming years. Once the horrors of the Holocaust came to light, the industry shied away from the subject until the likes of Brooks and Stanley Kubrick (with Dr. Strangelove) had the chutzpah to bite.\n\nWhile Dr. Strangelove and The Producers are among the greatest comedies to ever grace the screen, The Great Dictator is, for my money at least, an even more awe-inspiring accomplishment, an expert, immensely influential blend of comedy and drama that finds its star at the top of his game, both in front of and behind the camera.\n\nFor film buffs seeking slapstick at its finest, The Great Dictator, no surprise, delivers all of the goods. Chaplin is devastatingly funny as Hynkel, portraying him in a fashion that is buffoonish, yet also uneasily grounded in reality. Hynkel's ballet with the globe balloon is an unimpeachable master class in comedy.\n\nIt's with the barber, however, that Chaplin really provides himself the opportunity to display his chops as an actor. As this quiet man, who yearns for a serene existence back home after years of recovery in the hospital, Chaplin is absolutely enchanting. He's often quite funny in this role too but it's a far more restrained brand of comedy. Chaplin gets to play a romantic too and has lovely chemistry with Goddard, playing the beautiful neighbor and apple of the barber's eye.\n\nThe real gut-punch of The Great Dictator comes in its conclusion, in which the barber, disguised as the dictator, delivers a public speech proclaiming that Hynkel has had a change of heart and urges kindness. It's an intensely affecting moment, beautifully written and performed, that ends the proceedings on a wholly satisfying note.\n\nNow, did Chaplin have a prayer of winning the Best Actor prize in 1940? Not really.\n\nWhile Chaplin would, more than 30 years later, attend the Oscars to accept an honorary prize, he protested the entire 1940 awards season, lamenting the concept of actors competing with one another for prizes. Critics were partial to him and Fonda but it's scant surprise Stewart prevailed in the end. Not only did he have The Philadelphia Story, he also headlined three other pictures in 1940, including the beloved The Shop Around the Corner.\n\nIn a dynamite year for leading men (Fonda and Olivier are so fabulous too), Chaplin would have made a richly deserving winner.\n\n14 and 13. Timothy Hutton and Mary Tyler Moore in Ordinary People (1980) (WINNER - Hutton)\n\nTheir competition...\n\nJudd Hirsch, Ordinary People\n\nMichael O'Keefe, The Great Santini\n\nJoe Pesci, Raging Bull\n\nJason Robards, Melvin and Howard\n\nEllen Burstyn, Resurrection\n\nGoldie Hawn, Private Benjamin\n\nGena Rowlands, Gloria\n\nSissy Spacek, Coal Miner's Daughter (WINNER)\n\nHutton and Moore portray Conrad and Beth Jarrett, a son and mother reeling from the loss of the family's eldest son Buck in a sailing accident. While Conrad remains ravaged with anguish and guilt over Buck's death, and has just returned home from the hospital following a suicide attempt, Beth is focused on maintaining perfect composure and unable to connect with her despondent son. In the middle is Calvin (Donald Sutherland), also drowning in grief and desperate to hold his strained family together. These performances marked Hutton's first and only Oscar nomination and win and Moore's first and only Oscar nomination.\n\nSorry, Raging Bull fans, but Ordinary People (my favorite of all Best Picture winners) wholeheartedly deserved to steamroll on Oscar night 1980 - and even more so than it ultimately did.\n\nTerrific as Spacek is taking on Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner's Daughter, I don't hesitate for a second in throwing my support behind Moore (and, for what it's worth, Burstyn would be my runner-up). No doubt, under a different campaign strategy, Moore would have triumphed down in the anemic Best Supporting Actress field (crazy as it sounds, her screen time only clocks in at about half an hour) but I happen to think all three of the Jarretts, Best Supporting Actor winner Hutton included, warranted pushes up in Lead.\n\nAfter all, how on earth is Hutton on the same level as Hirsch - and likewise, how could Moore compete for a Supporting nomination with the picture's Elizabeth McGovern? Of course, Paramount, Ordinary People's distributor, didn't want to see Hutton face the most uphill of battles against the juggernaut that was Raging Bull's Robert De Niro. (Not that Sutherland even mustered a nomination in Best Actor - one of the all-time most egregious Oscar snubs.)\n\nIn the end, Hutton had scant awards season trouble down in Best Supporting Actor, though critics were awfully fond of Pesci too. Moore, on the other hand, didn't muster much traction against Spacek but was surely runner-up.\n\nFor my money, Ordinary People is among the most affecting pictures to ever grace the big screen, an masterfully acted, written and directed film that marks the finest work of its stars, screenwriter (Alvin Sargent, adapting from the Judith Guest novel) and filmmaker (Robert Redford, in a remarkable directorial debut). Stunningly grounded in reality and packed with one gut-punching moment after another, the picture continues to intensely resonate, nearly four decades since its release.\n\nAt the heart of the film is Hutton's Conrad, the fragile, grief-stricken brother who struggles to get on with business at usual, at home and at school. He is on fine terms with his kind and understanding father but can never get through to Beth, who shared with Buck a special bond she never quite had with Conrad. The entrance of Hirsch's Dr. Berger, Conrad's new psychiatrist, is welcomed by Calvin but hardly embraced by Beth, who doesn't care for her son discussing family matters with a stranger.\n\nThe scenes opposite Hirsch provide Hutton the license to flex his acting muscles as Conrad is sent on an emotional roller coaster ride that only heightens in potency as he digs deeper into how the events of that tragic day with Buck have affected him. Hutton also has the chance to show off a lighter, sweeter side in his moments with McGovern, who portrays Jeannine, the apple of Conrad's eye.\n\nHutton's most startling scenes, however, come opposite Moore, who takes emotional suppression to sky-high heights as family matriarch Beth.\n\nBy having the most frigid and uneasy of chemistry, Hutton and Moore have an absolutely pitch-perfect rapport (or lack thereof) that is unmatched. The nervousness of their early scenes together - at breakfast and dinner, out in the backyard reflecting on Buck, setting the kitchen table - eventually turns explosive when Conrad makes changes in his life, like leaving the swimming team. Where Conrad believes he's helping himself, on the advice of Dr. Berger, Beth finds his behavior inexplicable.\n\nMoore is at once robotic and indisputably human as Beth. While Beth goes through the motions of her life, hitting up the mall, attending swanky functions with Calvin and so on, there is scant doubt about the pain eating away at her deep down.\n\nBeth may be cold and often exasperating, and our hearts are certainly with Conrad and Calvin from start to finish, but Moore instills her with a palpable, if masked humanity that makes it difficult to view Beth as some one-note, irredeemable ice queen. Instead, as Moore herself described the character during the production and in interviews over the years, Beth is a victim. Moore slays in one scene after another, perhaps most notably Beth's big breakdown on the golf course, where she lashes out at Calvin for merely suggesting the idea of checking in on Conrad while they're away. And that sight of Conrad's attempt at a hug with his mother late in the picture...yikes.\n\nRedford was said to have had Moore in mind to portray Beth from the get-go - an incredible feat, given the star's reputation as America's sweetheart and a queen of comedy on the small screen. Ultimately, however, Redford was spot-on and Moore turned in the performance of her career.\n\nIt's really a shame then, looking back, that more film roles of this incredible caliber didn't follow. When her subsequent picture, the drama Six Weeks with Dudley Moore, flopped, that was pretty much it. Likewise, while the occasional sparkling script would cross his path, albeit none on the level of Ordinary People, Hutton too didn't have the most illustrious of runs on the big screen.\n\nPerhaps Ordinary People didn't send Hutton and Moore soaring to big screen super stardom like it should have but that hardly diminishes the fact that these are two of the most devastating performances ever recognized at the Oscars, with Hutton the greatest of all Best Supporting Actor winners. I have watched this sublime film annually for so many years and undoubtedly will continue to do so 'til the end of time.\n\n12. Ida Kaminska in The Shop on Main Street (1965)\n\nHer competition...\n\nAnouk Aimee, A Man and a Woman\n\nLynn Redgrave, Georgy Girl\n\nVanessa Redgrave, Morgan!\n\nElizabeth Taylor, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (WINNER)\n\nKaminska portrays Mrs. Rozalie Lautmann, the Jewish owner of a button shop in Nazi-occupied Slovakia. Old and hard of hearing, Mrs. Lautmann is disconnected from the ever-changing world outside. So, when carpenter Tono Brtko (Jozef Kroner) is recruited by authorities to be \"Aryan comptroller\" of her store, Mrs. Lautmann, convinced the friendly Tono is a nephew interested in helping the shop, welcomes him with open arms. Over time, Mrs. Lautmann and Tono strike up a friendly rapport, which leaves him guilt-ridden and later faced with the worst of moral dilemmas when all Jews in town are ordered to be turned in. This performance marked Kaminska's first and only Oscar nomination.\n\nA titan of the stage in Poland - the Jewish Theatre in Warsaw is named in her honor - Kaminska found her 15 minutes of fame before American audiences with this breathtaking performance in The Shop on Main Street, which deservedly took home the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.\n\nSerious kudos to the Academy for recognizing a Ukrainian-born stage actress in a Czechoslovakian picture hardly seen by a vast domestic audience. Voters easily could have gone for a safer, inferior selection, like Julie Andrews in Hawaii or Natalie Wood in This Property Is Condemned. Instead, they produced one of the all-time great nominations in Best Actress.\n\nThe Shop on Main Street is among the finest pictures about the Holocaust, refreshingly devoid of the mawkishness that plagues the likes of more contemporary fare like Life Is Beautiful and The Reader. Sensitively directed by Jan Kadar and Elmar Klos and beautifully photographed by Vladimir Novotny, it also happens to sport two magnificent performances, from Kaminska and leading man Kroner, whose distressed Tono is every bit as absorbing as her disoriented Mrs. Lautmann.\n\nMrs. Lautmann, gradually losing her grip on reality, lives in her own little world. She's oblivious to the revolutionary events going down around her, instead clinging to her old memories and traditions. Pitiful as Mrs. Lautmann is, Kaminska also makes her a wholly endearing and irresistible old lady - it's no wonder Tono takes such a strong liking to her and is so consumed with grief when the inevitable rears its tragic head. She makes Mrs. Lautmann a sweet, grandmotherly figure but also a painfully honest one - she hardly hesitates to bring Tono down a few notches when he deserves it. Also, for a picture that ends on such a heart-wrenching note, Kaminska has moments where she is outrageously funny.\n\nAt age 65 during production, and still full of the energy necessary to do eight one-woman stage shows a week, Kaminska is completely convincing as the frail, 78-year-old Mrs. Lautmann. She portrays senility more vividly than any other performance I can think of and, though she in actuality only graces the screen for about a fifth of the proceedings, is never not on your mind once Mrs. Lautmann makes her entrance (which isn't until about half an hour in).\n\nSublime as Kaminska's performance is, she really didn't have a prayer against Taylor, the overwhelming favorite in Best Actress. Kaminska and Kroner shared honors at the Cannes Film Festival for their turns but otherwise, Kaminska failed to earn a single mention from the critics' awards, which would've been essential to her having a prayer on Oscar night.\n\nUltimately, she may have come up short but the raves for her performance propelled her all the way to Broadway for the first time, where she headlined and directed a well-received revival of Mother Courage and Her Children. Kaminska remained in New York for the remainder of her life and got under her belt one American film, The Angel Levine, opposite Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte. Such would prove her final motion picture.\n\nKaminska in The Shop on Main Street is a jaw-dropping performance sorely in need of rediscovery.\n\n11. Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) (WINNER)\n\nHis competition...\n\nBurt Lancaster, Birdman of Alcatraz\n\nJack Lemmon, Days of Wine and Roses\n\nMarcello Mastroianni, Divorce Italian Style\n\nPeter O'Toole, Lawrence of Arabia\n\nPeck portrays Atticus Finch, a revered attorney in small town Alabama, circa 1932. A widower, Atticus is raising two young children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Phillip Alford), who spend their days playing games and spying on their mysterious neighbor Arthur \"Boo\" Radley (Robert Duvall). When Atticus is appointed to defend an African-American man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), against fabricated rape charges, Scout and Jem are exposed to the vile racism plaguing their beloved Maycomb. This performance marked Peck's fifth and final Oscar nomination and first and only win.\n\nWhen Peck earned his Best Actor nomination in 1962, despite formidable competition, he was a sure bet for victory. Not only was To Kill a Mockingbird a commercial and critical smash, Peck was at this point on his fifth appearance in the category and, unlike O'Toole (whose Lawrence of Arabia won Best Picture and was the highest-grossing film of the year), viewed as overwhelmingly due for victory. Having another terrific performance under his belt this year (Cape Fear) certainly didn't hurt.\n\nDespite his storied career, packed with one fantastic turn after another, Peck will rightfully, always be most associated with this picture. Not that the actor ever tired of this recognition - he wanted the role the moment Alan J. Pakula (the film's producer) approached him about it and, over the years to follow, would reflect on the picture with the utmost positivity. Critically offering her ringing endorsement was author Harper Lee, who viewed Peck as the pitch-perfect choice for her Atticus Finch.\n\nPeck is Atticus, through and through, exuding immense warmth and kindness while also towering as an imposing figure in the eyes of his children. When, in the courtroom, the Reverend Sykes (William Walker) says to Scout, \"Miss Jean Louise, stand up, your father's passing,\" we're liable to join her on our feet. Peck's presence is so powerful and strapping, it demands respect, and every moment he graces the screen, we feel as though we are beholding a genuine superhero. He avoids the mawkishness that could have easily ravaged an adaptation done in the wrong hands, yet delivers a performance so packed with heart and tenderness. Peck also instills in Atticus a palpable sense of vulnerability, both professionally and personally. Though we as an audience may feel to the contrary, this Atticus hardly views himself as a hero or a perfect father.\n\nThe trial of Tom Robinson of course provides Peck with the grandest opportunity to have a field day in the role and feast on Horton Foote's dialogue. And indeed, in his final summation to members of the jury near the conclusion of the trial, Peck is downright spellbinding. Yet, I'm even fonder of Peck's quieter scenes opposite Badham, who's a natural pro on the screen. They have a warm, lived-in chemistry that is essential to the picture's success.\n\nIs it possible to be quietly larger than life? Well, if so, Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird is the definition of this.\n\nThe Oscar 100 (thus far)...\n\n11. Gregory Peck, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\n12. Ida Kaminska, The Shop on Main Street\n\n13.

With the best of the best lurking around the corner in just two weeks, we'll first take a look at the highest-ranking winners in Best Actor and Best Actress; two quietly devastating turns from actors perhaps better known for more animated work; and at last, \"the greatest star of them all.\"\n\n20. Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) (WINNER)\n\nHer competition...\n\nGeena Davis, Thelma & Louise\n\nLaura Dern, Rambling Rose\n\nBette Midler, For the Boys\n\nSusan Sarandon, Thelma & Louise\n\nFoster portrays Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. She is recruited by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Unit to interview the notorious psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who Crawford suspects may have insights into Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), another serial killer pursued by the Bureau. As Clarice strives to gain Lecter's confidence, she finds herself increasingly manipulated by the imposing inmate, who demands a quid pro quo - he'll only provide information on Buffalo Bill in exchange for details from Clarice's personal life. This performance marked Foster's third Oscar nomination and second win.\n\nThe tale of the pre-production on The Silence of the Lambs is nearly as compelling and dizzying as the masterpiece that ultimately emerged after years of negotiations and financing issues. This post isn't about that, of course, but let's just say the film was initially slated to feature Gene Hackman...as its director (and possibly in the role of Crawford to boot).\n\nBy the time Hackman was out (he reportedly wasn't enamored with Ted Tally's brutal screenplay) and Jonathan Demme in, it was Michelle Pfeiffer out in front for the role of Clarice Starling. Demme had just directed her in Married to the Mob and, no doubt, Pfeiffer would've been aces in such a reunion. Alas, like Hackman, Pfeiffer had reservations about the gruesome nature of the picture and ultimately passed.\n\nDemme's subsequent preferences either rejected the offer (Meg Ryan) or were turned down by Orion Pictures (Laura Dern). To the great hesitation of Demme, who wasn't thrilled with her Oscar winning turn in The Accused, Orion wanted Foster all along and, unlike Pfeiffer and Ryan, she loved the part. In the end, with his top three out of contention, Demme caved, Foster was in and the rest is movie history.\n\nFabulous as Hopkins is, sinking his teeth into his delicious role with giddy vigor (Levine is incredible too), Foster is absolutely the heart and soul of this picture. She has us under her spell from the moment she graces the screen, starting with that brilliant shot of Clarice hopping aboard the elevator with her male colleagues, and is an absorbing, enchanting and exciting sight throughout her blood-curdling journey.\n\nOnce a poor orphan from the backwoods of West Virginia, Clarice has worked so valiantly to reach this fulfilling point in her life, both personally and professionally. Only Lecter seems to recognize the vulnerability and trembling self-confidence that in fact lies deep beneath the surface. As Lecter chips away at Clarice's armor, forcing her to recall one tragedy after another, Foster is a heartbreaking sight, yet never loses that sense of determination that is necessary to survive and win at Lecter's mind games. The actors' stirring rapport generates goosebumps in practically all of their scenes, even when it's a mere phone conversation. Foster thrives in their scenes apart too, including in the picture's petrifying cat-and-mouse conclusion.\n\nOn Oscar night, The Silence of the Lambs was well-positioned for an impressive showing, yet not quite a shoo-in in Best Picture or Best Director, where the likes of Bugsy and JFK were ready to put up a fight. Such wasn't the case down in Best Actress, where Foster, despite having just triumphed three years earlier, was the shoo-in of shoo-ins. Voters were never going to decide between Davis and Sarandon and for Dern and Midler, the nominations themselves were the prizes.\n\nEvery year, I revisit The Silence of the Lambs around Halloween time. As time passes, Foster's fabulous performance just seems to get better and better.\n\n19. Martin Landau in Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989)\n\nHis competition...\n\nDanny Aiello, Do the Right Thing\n\nDan Aykroyd, Driving Miss Daisy\n\nMarlon Brando, A Dry White Season\n\nDenzel Washington, Glory (WINNER)\n\nLandau portrays Judah Rosenthal, a man with a seemingly perfect life. One of the top ophthalmologists in New York, he is a preeminent member of the community and adored by his family. Only one problem - he's been having an affair with flight attendant Dolores (Anjelica Huston) and, convinced Judah will never leave wife Miriam (Claire Bloom), she is determined to reveal their liaison to his family. Desperate to prevent this, Judah turns to his gangster brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) to hire a hitman to take out Dolores. When the deed is done, Judah finds himself consumed with grief and becomes convinced God is watching him. This performance marked Landau's second Oscar nomination.\n\nIn 1988, director Francis Ford Coppola rescued Landau out of direct-to-video hell for an Oscar-nominated supporting turn in Tucker: The Man and His Dream. Landau's performance was a lovely one, albeit somewhat lost in the otherwise bloated picture, one of Coppola's many productions that floundered at the box office.\n\nThe following year found Landau in even better form, in a decidedly superior film. Not only does Crimes and Misdemeanors mark the finest work of the actor's career, it is also one of the very best Woody Allen films, an exquisitely crafted blend of drama and comedy that especially comes to life in the Landau half of the proceedings. (The Allen half, opposite Mia Farrow and Alan Alda, is more familiar, amiable territory for the filmmaker, albeit still plenty enjoyable.)\n\nJudah is a contemptible figure, no doubt, concerned exclusively with himself and his standing with his family and colleagues, but Landau manages to elicit surprising empathy for the man as he suffocates under his sorrow, anguished with the decision he's made to knock off the woman he fell in love with. There are little glimpses of flashbacks to the Judah-Dolores romance that are sweet and all too convincing and ultimately make her demise all the more heartbreaking.\n\nLandau and Huston have a remarkable chemistry as they make Judah and Dolores a wholly winning pair during earlier times and then bitterly at odds in the present as she makes her tell-all plans clear. Dolores of course wins all of our sympathy in the scenes leading to her death but it's tough to not get emotionally caught up in Judah's tribulation too, as he faces his moral dilemma and is drawn back into the religious teachings he rejected into adulthood.\n\nThere are moments in Crimes and Misdemeanors in which Landau graces the screen in silence and yet says so much through his eyes and face, his Judah vividly consumed with torment over the tragic events he has set in motion - just look at him, dazed and distressed, as Judah returns to Dolores' apartment after learning she has been killed. Landau also works wonders with Allen's sublime dialogue, like in the haunting scene in with Judah has a trembling conversation with an imaginary rabbi and of course in the final scene opposite Allen, whose Clifford Stern has also been having a tough go at life, albeit at a far less grueling level.\n\nWith another, lesser actor, Judah could have emerged a one-note embodiment of evil. Instead, Landau, the most gifted of character actors, adds layer upon layer to this complicated man, at once reprehensible and altogether human.\n\nDespite the brilliance of his performance, Landau was never considered a threat for the Best Supporting Actor win, nor even a clear contender for a nomination, as critics proved partial to Alda, who portrays the pompous playboy in the Allen half of the picture. Landau, Brando and Aykroyd had to sit on the sidelines as Washington towered over the field as front-runner, with Aiello seen as the greatest threat.\n\nLandau, of course, would at last emerge victorious just a few years down the road, back in Best Supporting Actor as he steamrolled the awards season with Ed Wood - a fabulous turn, albeit a slightly inferior one to his career-topper in Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\n18. Jessica Lange in Frances (1982)\n\nHer competition...\n\nJulie Andrews, Victor/Victoria\n\nSissy Spacek, Missing\n\nMeryl Streep, Sophie's Choice (WINNER)\n\nDebra Winger, An Officer and a Gentleman\n\nLange portrays Frances Farmer, the brilliant, beautiful and famously rebellious actress whose modest stardom on the stage and screen in the 1930s was gradually derailed by substance abuse, a reputation as impossible to work with and the quintessential Mother from Hell (Kim Stanley), who cruelly institutionalized her daughter following a nervous breakdown. This performance, alongside Tootsie (in Best Supporting Actress), marked Lange's first Oscar appearance.\n\nTalk about terrible timing.\n\nHad Universal Pictures released Frances in nearly any other year, Lange surely would have triumphed for her tour de force as the tragic star of the silver screen. Alas, in 1982, she was forced to face the most undeniable of Oscar contenders, the legendary Streep, tearing it up in Sophie's Choice, a film that proved a far greater commercial success than Frances. Hardly helping Lange's cause was Universal being the distributor for Sophie as well (ditto Missing), so, when Streep started to steamroll with awards and Frances faded at the box office while Sophie soared, Universal was understandably more focused on getting Streep across the finish line.\n\nThe compromise was predictable and not entirely satisfying - voters would throw Lange a bone down in Best Supporting Actress, a consolation prize not only for the loss up in Best Actress but for Tootsie itself, which would fall short in every other category.\n\nBeyond the powerhouse that is Lange, Frances is a rather sloppy, haphazard picture, all but devoid of subtlety and riddled with inaccuracies. Yet, as a showcase for two dynamite actresses, Lange and the horrifying Stanley, it emerges an absolute must-see.\n\nWhen these two titans of the screen go at it, it's about as riveting as cinema can get. Moreover, Sam Shepard, as Frances' on-and-off lover Harry, may be portraying more of an enigma than an actual character, but his chemistry with Lange is smoldering and the final scene of the picture, in which Harry crosses paths with Frances for the first time since an involuntary lobotomy turned her into something out of The Stepford Wives, is positively devastating.\n\nLange remarkably portrays Frances over a nearly 30-year span as the up-and-comer evolves from an apprehensive, unworldly girl from Seattle, to a larger than life, drop dead gorgeous starlet of the stage and screen and ultimately to an disorderly, disillusioned woman whose declining mental health is only exasperated by an industry and a mother who have scant compassion for her. When Frances is sent to the asylum, Lange descends into deranged madness that rings of Liz Taylor in Suddenly, Last Summer and, like Taylor, expertly walks that fine line between bombast and all too convincing tragedy.\n\nAmong the stormiest, most startling performances to ever grace the screen, Lange in Frances continues to mesmerize, even if the film around her is vastly inferior to its headliner. It's the turn that forever put her on the map as one of the great American actresses, washing away all animosity critics back in the day may have felt toward Lange for the clunky King Kong remake that first sent her soaring into super stardom.\n\n17 and 16. Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft in The Miracle Worker (1962) (WINNERS)\n\nTheir competition...\n\nMary Badham, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nShirley Knight, Sweet Bird of Youth\n\nAngela Lansbury, The Manchurian Candidate\n\nThelma Ritter, Birdman of Alcatraz\n\nBette Davis, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\n\nKatharine Hepburn, Long Day's Journey Into Night\n\nGeraldine Page, Sweet Bird of Youth\n\nLee Remick, Days of Wine and Roses\n\nDuke and Bancroft portray Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan, a blind, deaf and mute girl and the half-blind tutor hired, in a last ditch effort before Helen's parents institutionalize her, to help the child. Helen, exasperated by her inability to communicate and prone to violent outbursts, is initially resistant to Annie's efforts but, through determination and tough love, the tutor is gradually able to connect with her and show Helen ways of reaching others. These performances marked both Duke's and Bancroft's first Oscar nominations and wins.\n\nGood heavens, imaging being an awards season prognosticator in these races!\n\nThere was no clear front-runner in either of these categories, nor Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor for that matter. The case was the same up in Best Picture and Best Director, with Lawrence of Arabia and To Kill a Mockingbird battling it out in dead heats.\n\nIf there was a favorite in Best Supporting Actress, albeit a soft favorite at that, it was Lansbury, who earned raves for her chilling turn in The Manchurian Candidate. No doubt, however, the star, now on her third Oscar nomination in the category, wasn't helped by the otherwise lackluster reception from voters for her picture. The Miracle Worker, while absent in Best Picture, was up in both Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay and certainly a less anxiety-inducing endeavor than the Lansbury film.\n\nEvents were more intriguing up in Best Actress.\n\nBancroft had won a Tony for the original Broadway production of The Miracle Worker, so she was of course in serious contention from the get-go - well, that is, after director Arthur Penn shot down United Artists' proposal to cast Liz Taylor of all people as Annie Sullivan.\n\nAmong Bancroft's opponents in Best Actress in a Play at the 1960 Tonys was none other than Page for Sweet Bird of Youth - despite her loss, however, Page was also seen as a viable winner. She won the Golden Globe and, now on her third Oscar nomination, was perhaps the most \"due\" of the contenders. Hepburn triumphed at Cannes for her turn but wasn't seen as a real threat, nor was newcomer Remick.\n\nThe heavy sentimental favorite was Davis, who hadn't won an Oscar since Jezebel in 1938 and whose comeback with Whatever Happened to Baby Jane was a sizable commercial success. Fellow leading lady Joan Crawford, who had a frigid production experience with her Baby Jane co-star, took it upon herself to wage a behind-the-scenes whisper campaign to damage Davis' Oscar bid.\n\nPart of this strategy was calling up Davis' opponents to offer herself up to anyone who couldn't make the ceremony and needed someone to accept the prize on her behalf. Both Bancroft and Page were no-shows, so, when the former ultimately won, Crawford gleefully waltzed upon the Oscar stage, taking grand delight in both being front and center at the ceremony (which wasn't the case the night she won for Mildred Pierce) and rubbing salt in Davis' wound.\n\nNow! Onto the performances themselves...\n\nBoth Duke and Bancroft are absolutely pitch-perfect in two exceedingly difficult roles. Helen Keller, the infuriated girl suffocating in a world of silence, is a rather one-note role, providing its actress scant opportunity to convey any sort of evolution. Yet, Duke completely, flawlessly disappears into this role - it's the definitive portrayal, conveying the child's ferocious temper and untamed voice and facial expressions, while also making Helen a wholly sympathetic figure.\n\nThat Duke makes Helen both so disorderly and also so full of heart makes Annie's own exasperation and desperation to reach the girl all the more convincing. Duke and Bancroft have an intense rapport during their quarrels but there's also a deeply affecting sensitivity to other moments, like the legendary water pump scene.\n\nBoth actresses expertly reign in their portrayals from the stage to screen - Bancroft especially is impressive, given the histrionics that would so often emerge in later performances. She instills precisely the right amounts of toughness, compassion and vulnerability into Annie, a headstrong figure on the outside who in reality has no shortage of doubts.\n\nIn different hands, The Miracle Worker could have been a mawkish TV Movie of the Week. Instead, under Penn's expert direction and headlined by these two performance, it's a fiery, wholly absorbing endeavor, full of moments both heartwarming and frightening.\n\nThe Oscar 100 (thus far)...\n\n16.
