        "text": "Jeff Bridges shouted out one of his most iconic characters while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 2019 Golden Globes.\n\n“If I’m lucky I’ll be associated with The Dude for the rest of my life,” he said, referencing his character from 1998’s The Big Lebowski after thanking the film’s writer-directors Joel and Ethan Cohen for creating the role.\n\nThe Cecil B. DeMille award, first presented in 1952, honors “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.” Last yeah, Oprah Winfrey became the first black woman to receive the award.\n\nDuring a light-hearted and meandering speech, Bridges compared his life and career to that of a trim tab — a small feature on boats and airplanes that assists in controlling the direction of the vessel. “I like to think of myself as trim tab, and all of us trim tabs,” Bridges said. “We may not seem like we’re up to the task, but we are. We’re alive! We can make a difference. We can turn this ship in the way we want to go, toward love, toward creating a healthy planet for all of us.”\n\nChris Pine presented Bridges with the award. “His remarkable career spans six decades. From his first appearance on screen to his latest performance, Jeff has set a standard of excellence,” Pine said. “He’s made eccentric characters truly iconic — and yes I am talking about El Duderino — and ordinary characters extraordinary and noble.” Later, Pine added: “You are not only a master craftsman but also a truly kind and wonderful gentleman.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nBridges most recently starred in this year’s Bad Times at the El Royale. He also produced, narrated and appeared in this year’s documentary Living in the Future’s Past.\n\nThe Golden Globes are produced by Dick Clark Productions, a subsidiary of Valence Media, which also owns Billboard."
