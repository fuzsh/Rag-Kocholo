The Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award named after its first recipient and renowned director and father of American cinema Cecil B. DeMille, has been a fixture at the Golden Globes ceremonies ever since its first appearance at the 9th Golden Globe Awards in 1951. So, viewers have been curious about its surprising absence at the 2024 Golden Globe Awards ceremony. Here is everything you need to know.

Why was there no Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes 2024?

The Cecil B. DeMille Award was absent at the Golden Globes 2024 event due to time constraints as per the official preview of the Golden Globe Awards.

However, the Cecil B. DeMille Award was not the only award category to be absent from the 2024 Golden Globes event as the Carol Burnett Award first introduced in 2019 was also absent this year. Both of these awards were scrapped owing to time constraints and also because two new categories were added:

Cinematic and Box Office Excellence

Best Performance by a Stand-Up Comic

The last five recipients of the Cecil B. DeMille Award were:

Eddie Murphy (2023)

Jane Fonda (2021)

Tom Hanks (2020)

Jeff Bridges (2019)

Oprah Winfrey (2018)

The Cecil B. DeMille Award was presented at every Golden Globes Award ceremony except for the ceremonies in 1976, 2008, and 2022.

Will the Cecil B. DeMille Award return in 2025?

The Cecil B. DeMille Award will likely return in 2025.

This is because the Golden Globes themselves stated in their preview of the 2024 event that the absence of the award was only temporary and that there was a chance of it being given in the future.
