There, that engineer has sat down to rest again—lazy. (Machinery stopped.) Two men talking. It is the nature of women to ask trivial irrelavant & pursuing questions. Yes, & to think they have logical, analytical minds & argumentative ability. You see 'em whet up when they smell argument in the air. [#]\n\n18\n\nNotebook 13\n\n6 A.M. Sunday.—Making land. Unreasonable fury to think a ship could ship a sea in next to a dead calm. Presently another. (The men were washing decks & my port was open.) < La > Whaling yarns last night. Boston student's Governor Gardiner 1 2 fine clothes & spectaclesman that wanted lantern & umbrella to go aloft. Man wouldn't go above foretop—no ladder—wanted him go to fore-to-galan Xtrees. \" Y o u might heave her down & keep her hove down 6 months & she wouldn't shed a tear.\" That a New Bedford built vessel—but \"down East\" (Bath, &c) they don't build 'em so well. < [*J]S> Send 'em to sea & they wet their oakum first trip. \"Think it was to-day week ago\"—everybody waiting—the date entirely trivial. Pilot—What's price onions. Citizens^-What's price onions. Narrow channel, between 2 points of rock. Sea-sick resurrection. Man with ancient plug hat came aboard—effusive meeting with friends long absent. \"Don't you know me?\" \" W e l l there is something about you that looks familiar, but then I haven't been here for 15 years—O, it's your hat!\" Mighty well dressed people of both sexes & colors & all ages.—Men all put one foot up on a barrel. Many use little dandy canes. 12 Clemens identifies the \"Boston student,\" here and in \"Some Rambling Notes,\" as \"Governor Gardiner,\" probably meaning Henry J. Gardner, governor of Massachusetts from 1 8 5 5 to 1858. This anecdote about his youthful experiences is considerably expanded in the published piece.\n\nMay-July 1877\n\n19\n\nFine colored complexions & handsome faces & easy carriage. Corrugated iron roof over a great freight of onions in boxes. 3d to take us four yards in boat—charged us i s a piece. Beautiful English girl at Agent's, very tastefully dressed. Hotel closed. N o vehicle to take us or baggage to Mrs. Kirkham's. Hired little darkey boy to show us. H e had seat of pants like a township map < d o n e in c o > chromolithographed. H e wound in & out & here & there—once through very narrow lane. Charged < i s > double. Houses painfully white—town & houses & verandahs all Spanish style. They cut this porous stone out in blocks of any shape < & it h > w i t h a saw & it hardens afterward. T h e n they p u t on a blinding coat of whitewash. English naval officers & fine ladies returning from a fine large church on the hill. Roses, morning glories, papaias, < & a > lemons, figs, bananas, & a sort of spreading palm & India rubber tree. G o t a darkey to < c > h a n d - c a r t our baggage up. Charged us double ($1) b u t he sweated the worth of it, for it is very hot. G o t two large cool, well lighted rooms, & now the calm Sabbath is being profaned by the crowing & clucking of chickens, the wauling of cats & the clanging of a metallic neighboring piano & people singing \"Only an Armor Bearer\" &c with power. \" W h a t ' s the war news? \"And the price of onions? Pop. 12000, half of them colored. Couldn't sleep—got to feeling low & far from home—went into next room to find a cheerful book—got one in the dark—\"Meditations\n\n20 on Death & Eternity.\" to my mood.\n\nNotebook 13 13\n\nLooked again & found books better suited\n\nFine calla lilies in the gardens. Beautiful rose & splendid red foliage plant climbing rock wall near Gov's. Every man has a quarry behind his house—can take long chisel & cut out the beautiful white blocks of coral (full of < a periwi> a larger shell.) The roofs are terraced or tiled with apparently the same stuff & are snow white. They catch the rain in < c i s > cisterns. Few or no good wells. No springs, no streams. Everywhere these snow-white houses peeping from the dull green vegetation—everywhere the hard gleaming white road—cut through < [- -] > t h e 6-inch soil, smooth off & you have a hard paved road. < s o > This glare of whiteness pained our eyes. Presently a soothing blessed twilight < l a i > spread its balm around; looked up & saw it proceeded from an intensely black negro. W e answered his < b o w > military salute gratefully in the cool shade of his near presence & passed on into the pitiless white glare again. Flags in the swamp ten feet high. Everywhere the pleasant pink of the oleander ten to 15 ft high & with stem like a tree. Beautiful red bird with a crest—didn't know him. Graceful cat bird—songs of unknown bird. All the birds tame—not afraid of us. Bewitching view of the sea—pale blue in shoal—brown over rocks. Handsome red blossom of the pomegranate Orange in back yard Bridal, Annunciation Day lily Magnolia (but saw none) A ragged palm is one of the picturesquest of trees. To church—fine. y 2 darks, % whites—house full (\"turn d people way from the door).\" [#] 13 The English edition of these essays by Heinrich Zschokke, translated from German by Frederica Rowan, was published in London in 1 8 6 2 and reprinted in Boston in 1 8 6 3 .\n\nMay-July\n\ni8yy\n\n21\n\nT h e bride & bridegroom. T h e organ-blowing boys. The universal good dressin—the exceedingly tasteful dresses of the young women—must be plenty tailors & milliners here. Fool 1 4 Walked to < g > s h i p , got a bot. of beer, drew cork, but couldn't succeed in carrying it home. It kept foaming up & had to keep stopping to drink off surplus. Finished & threw bottle away. Read self to sleep with The Lady's Book of 44 yrs ago—such pieces as The Broken V o w (Mrs. Norton) The Lone Indian &c.15 They were a sad & sentimental lot in those days. Then I woke Joe up snoring & he came in & after a world of row & trouble got me awake. I apologized. Monday W a s awaked at 6 A M Monday by our ambitious young rooster—looked out saw him swelling around a yellow cat asleep on ground. Birds, a bugle, & various noises. Then a piano over the way which\n\n1 4 Clemens wrote \"Fool\" in purple ink to identify the subject of this entry. He added the word sometime after writing the entry, probably as he worked on \"Some Rambling Notes\" in Hartford. 1 5 Caroline Norton's \"The Broken V o w \" as well as the anonymous \"The Last Indian\" appeared in the February 1834 issue of Godey's Lady's Book.\n\n22\n\nNotebook 13\n\nGlare reflected from white < ground > road makes you want to sneeze. Bought white shoes & pipe-clay. Walked till hurt heel. After noonday dinner Drove along shore—one horse & intelligent young colored man. The sea-view always enchanting—light green water striped here & there with brown where rocks lie near surface. Sail boats flying over the rippled water. Distant glimpses16 of brilliant green water through narrow gaps between the many little islands. Close to shore on shallow water where light colored bottom, that marvellous transparency that crystal brilliancy & diamond like play which the wavelets cast—& the brilliant distinctness of the rocks on bottom. That fool with us sees \"Onions Wanted\" & innocently gets out to tell man plenty along the road. Geranium (scarlet) is simply almost a weed here. So is the lantana (yellow & brownish red)—in S. I.17 it is purple. Indian corn, potatoes onions—people gathering the two latter (May 21) in every field. The corn & the arrow root just beginning to grow. Y I A Bermuda bamboo—lemon, fig, papaia, mangrove V / V/ (with the twisted roots in water) —date palm, cocoa a > JJ/ P l m (fruit green yet) palmetto & the Mountain J( cabbage palm the stateliest of all.\n\n1 6 The placement of two pages of pencil drawings which, in the notebook, interrupt this entry suggests that they predate Clemens' Bermuda notes. The scrawled signature on the drawings is possibly that of John O'Brien Inman, a still-life and genre painter and son of fashionable portrait painter Henry Inman. There is, however, no evidence of Clemens' association with Inman. The drawings, which are unrelated to the surrounding text, have not been reproduced here. 1 7 Sandwich Islands.\n\nMay-July\n\n23\n\ni8yj\n\n60 ft high, gray, smooth shaft without a flaw for 50 f t then joins on to bright green like green corn stalk—< then > 6 ft of this & then the spraying plumes of the palm.\n\nbase like a pillar\n\nCentury plant—dead. Splendid tamarind tree. T h e whitest, loveliest chimneys, with soft shade on shady side. They < a r e n > don't look like marble < o r s n o w > , but something whiter, daintier, richer, < s > — w h i t e sugar is the nearest to it. No sign of < j o i n > mortar-joints or any joints of any kind in house or\n\n24\n\nNotebook 13\n\nchimney—just solid seamless white sugar carved out of a single cake, —then the windows sawed out & the green Venetian blinds put on. There is < n o t > a painful & constant sense of a great undefinable lack here—at last it burst upon us what is was—Tramps! Living is very cheap & there's potatoes & onions for all. Nobody can starve. Plenty of schools —everybody can read. Rent a cottage for $5 a month; heavy farm work wages 5s per day —lighter work 4s per day—pretty high wages. Don't see how living can be so cheap. Yet we were shown a lovely new house white as the driven snow, situated on a lovely rocky point running out into the sea—said the house & ground only cost $900—which was probably a lie.—< In Hartford or nearly > In New England or New York that house would cost $10,000 < t o i5,ooo> to 15,000 without the ground —that is if the inside work is at all in keeping with the outside. Two new cottages, neat as pins $480 apiece —another lie. They must have cost 2500 apiece. That $900 house was another sight finer & handsomer than our stable.—There are not twelve houses in Hartford as picturesque & as beautiful & captivating to the eye as this $900 affair. Hamilton is the place for pretty outsides. Saw one outcrop of hard limestone—all the rest of the island is coral. By the queer & abrupt dip it has in a thousand places, suppose it was hove up from below surface by earthquake. The blocks at quarry are 2 ft long, 1 ft < thick & > wide & 6 in thick—worth 28 shillings per 100 there— say $7 per 100— costs 24s or $6 per 100 to lay them up in a beautiful fence by the job. Digs out blocks with long chisel.\n\nMay-July 1877\n\n25\n\nEarly rose is the early crop. G a r n e t < s > potatoes the second crop. Our darkey said that here everybody knows everybody. Presently (away on a country road) T said \"There's a little dog seems lost & is worn out.\" \"He belongs to an old man named Yokes\"—so the driver is acquainted with all the dogs, too. Well, he doesn't need to know many, for < t h e y > dogs are very scarce. However, they make it up in cats. Plenty red coats & English faces. Cedar is a pretty enough tree except when i t < s > is the prevailing tree, then it is not so pleasant. In fact the cedar is so < t h i c k > everywhere that you almost get the impression that it is the only tree here. Pretty little bird on wall—had to stir him up with whip handle to make him stir—so he stirred, a foot & grumbled about it—so we left him there. With all this luxuriance of vegetation, < s > n o vines seem to ever climb these white houses—perhaps they can't get hold of the smooth hard coat of whitewash. A country cottage here with its cosy comfort bedded in among a wealth of brilliant scarlet geraniums & other flowers & the pink oleander is < o r > a mighty pretty thing. In other countries you'd know the cottage was worm-eaten & rotten—here you know it is as sound as if bran new. Pigs, chickens, cows, horses, goats, donkeys, all anchored out on hillsides grazing—mighty poor grazing too. The tidiness the marvellous cleanliness & neatness of this town & people. No hog wallows, no puddles, no stinks. The whitest & tidiest town in N. E. is shabby compared to this. Capt. Angrove ( < [ - ] > 35) has had 7 children & never saw but 3 < - > of them. Wife lonely & a shadow, got agent's permission & took her to Bermuda. The Co reprimanded him & fined him $50. [#]\n\n26\n\nNotebook 13\n\nThe old couple who made fortune with a dairy farm in Australia & talked all the way home to England (95 days) how they were going to live & die in peace in comfort in their native village. Ship sailed 6 weeks later & here they were, going back. England changed! The Captain of the condemned ship (53 years) went to sea at 15 —been 18 times to Mediterranean, several times to India, &c & was at raising of Bear Flag at Monterey under Fremont in 1846 (or 7?) For last 12 years has quieted down & \"staid at home\"—quit roving— that is, has traded from Boston to Surinam all that time! Old Capt West hunting for his ship.18 Most colored folks of all ages & sexes bow—the men often give the military salute—from seeing so much of it here among the soldiers. Pleasantly assailed by young darkeys with missionary cards— especialy one night in a dark avenue—Come on Annie Never occurred to us to ask anybody if it was dangerous to go these dark alleys at night—the aspect of the people & their homes was a sufficient guaranty. Private roads & walks about houses too clean to expectorate in— have to step aside. Tuesday. That same old tune & that same rooster this morn. The bugle was a pedlar's. Mosquito bars—T sits slapping mosquitoes which I think are imaginary. Rat & delirium tremens experiment. [#] 18 The three captains mentioned in these entries appear in somewhat altered form in \"Some Rambling Notes.\" A letter from Clemens to Howells identifies two of his Bermuda acquaintances as \"Capt. West the whaler, & Capt. Hope . . . wanderer in all the oceans for 43 years\" (MTHL, pp. 1 7 8 - 1 7 9 ) . These two men became the captains Tom Bowling and Ned Brace in \"Some Rambling Notes.\" The history of Captain Brace incorporates that of the S.S. Bermuda's Captain Angrove.\n\nMay-July\n\ni8yy\n\n27\n\nTuesday Day-dreaming for Patti19—Generals & finally Princes saving life of sweetheart. No bugs here to speak of, & comparatively few buggers. Started with basket of lunch to go yachting—turned back to get soft hats—took a back street to avoid passing a second time the negro man who is building the fence & to whom we talked yesterday. What might he think—though he said nothing. W e were not brave enough to brave his secret & depreciatory thoughts about us. Got the hats & took another back street. Couldn't get a yacht, so returned home with that basket, & this time boldly passed the negro—arguing inwardly, \"There has been time enough now for him to imagine we have done the thing we set out to do.\" That is it. You are a coward when you even seem to have backed down from a thing you openly set out to do. Seemingly none but blue or purple morning glories—very large—a fine effect where one had climbed through a very thick green tree & merely dotted it with an occasional blossom. Morning glory blossoms remain open all day. The scarlet geranium that grows everywhere is the double variety. Calla's & day or bridal lilies grow everywhere too. Saw a fine sweet pea. And a tree wholly naked of leaves but with brilliant red flowers < s h a p > < l i k e > of a shape that\n\n19 Adelina Patti had appeared in a number of operas in Covent Garden when Clemens and Livy were visiting London in 1873. At the time of Clemens' Bermuda trip, Mme Patti had just opened a new season at Covent Garden (New York Times, 17 May 1 8 7 7 ) . Clemens' entry is cryptic. It is possible that the reference is to Patti's relations with her husband, the Marquis de Caux, who had been ordered out of Russia by the emperor in February 1877 for subjecting the popular opera star to \"all the grosser offences against propriety that husbands commonly commit\" (New York Herald, 24 and 28 February 1 8 7 7 ) .\n\n28\n\nNotebook 13\n\nrather more suggested a star than anything else— the flowers were wide apart—so the tree was a sort of constellation. Very large locust trees. India rubber tree. Sent for horse to be brought immediately to go to St George's— < r > t h a t was an hour ago—horse not here yet. Happy land, where that word means little or nothing. Abstemious in dogs. Devil's Hole—angel fish, blue & yellow.— Bays with water like rolling blue smoke. Palatial front fence of Vice Consul. Bamboos 40 ft high. 1 Mahogany tree. Wild grape tree. Beautiful road, substantially walled. The custom of wearing canes comes from the prevalence of the British soldier with his little cane. The same with the half military salute of the negro men. 2 or 3 patches of forest clothed, draped, festooned with blue morning glories—fine eifect. Turn to left as in England when meet carriage. Cat-poisoning case, where chickens got some of the poison—(after warning) & woman whose cat got some, egged on the negro woman to bring suit. Slander of magistrate who gets < $ i 5 o > £150 & half the < f e e s > fine—so decides against the client who is ablest to pay the fine. That's the dimensions of the country! Wretched wooden houses in edge of St George's—villanous constrast to the tidy coral ones. One can't imagine where the poor live—in these bewitching cottages? [#]\n\nMay-July 1877\n\n29\n\nSensible Venetian shutter—not double & hung at sides of window, like ours, but single & hung at top—push it out from bottom & prop with stick. Everywhere the solid substantial suggestion of England & English prosperity & good order. Globe Hotel, St. George's—explained that they had but one boarder & were unprepared for an inundation of two strangers. No fish for sale to-day. Wanted to decline our custom, but we insisted & they yielded, taking an hour's grace to get dinner. Iron clad chicken. Globe Hotel piano same aged pattern. Must have been a musical epidemic here some 30 years ago, which died early. The pianos & the songs are all of that date. 3 prize onions shown us—man patted the onion with pathetic affection and praised it. The onion standard for all things—\"Strive to become an Early Rose, my boy\"—in youth & you may become a Garnet in maturity. Cat had been delivered of her Early rose (first crop) & was big with her Garnet crop. Enlarge on the onion. Most captured the only flea in the islands, but failed. Saw him but didn't get him. \"Drive ahead of him.\" < \" H e only goes> \"He'll turn out in a minute.\" I wondered how the driver knew.—But he did know. Because he knew the man & where he lived. He knows everybody. The man did turn out. The houses & roofs are like the white frosting or icing on a cake. The different parishes (8) are jealous of & blackguard each other— playfully & otherwise. [#]\n\n30\n\nNotebook 13\n\nMan was lame from having got a jigger in his foot. Dreadful Went to St George's in Irish linen suit & returned at 4 in 2 overcoats. Quail wouldn't fly. The ship can't carry all the onions & potatoes that offer. These potatoes (Early crop) sell at $2.50 a bushel < ($3-> ($7.50 a bbl) in New York, now. The sword tree. The tamarisk. Lemon, lime & orange trees—handsome fresh green foliage a contrast to the prevailing dull foliage & parched grass. Hedge of oleanders 20 ft high & in lavish bloom. Bewitching place on a lovely inlet where the consul lives. Dose of No. 15—the old whaler was out of No 15 so gave the man half a dose of No. 8 & 7 & was surprised that it killed him. W e chased a huge spider all over the room to-night & killed him— Joe said \"My! here's a spider as big as a rat!—gone under your bed!\" (Mem—There are vermin here.) The soup at George's (says the fool) had hellfire in it or something that tasted like it.

There I found a rude pencil sketch of a disabled vessel, and this note concerning it:—\"Friday, 25.—Jonas Smith, ten days out from Bermuda, 250 miles. Signal of distress flying (flag in the main rigging with the Union down.) Went out of our course to see her. Heavy ground swell on the sea, but no wind. They launched their boat, stern first, from the deck amidships (of course it filled with water at once), and then a man took hold of a rope that was rove through a block at the starboard end of the foreyard arm, and swung himself off over the sea like a spider at the end of his thread. The vessel's deck stood up as high as a house, she was so empty. Naturally, she rolled fearfully in the ground swell. That man would swing far out over the waves and then go rushing back again like a pendulum and slam against the ship's side. The boat never was there when he arrived. However, he made his trip at last, and began to bail out. Two others followed him in the same precarious spider fashion. They pulled off to our ship, and proved to be two colored men and a Portuguese, who was blacker than both of them put together. They said they had sailed from Bermuda for New York ten days before, with five days' provisions! They were about out of everything n o w had a little bread left and a cask and a half of water. The vessel had an absurdly large crew—we could see as many as a dozen colored men lying around taking it easy on her deck. W e loaded four barrels of potatoes into their boat, together with some 300 pounds of salt junk and a great quantity of sea-biscuit, but no water, for it was stowed where we could not well get at it.

Wakeman's memoirs contain his version of this story and the story of Daniel and the lions (Edgar Wakeman, The Log of an Ancient Mariner [San Francisco: A . L. Bancroft & Co., 1878], pp. 253-254). 2 8 Clemens modified and expanded the following paragraph for the closing of \"Some Rambling Notes.\" 2 9 Clemens' next trip to Bermuda, once again accompanied by Twichell, was not until January 1907. He made several subsequent short visits to the island from 1907 to 1910.\n\nMay-July 1877\n\n37\n\nThe Deity filled with humor. Kingsley.

King & Co., 1877). In a letter to Mollie Clemens on 29 July 1877 Livy mentioned that she and Sue Crane were currently reading \"The Life and Letters of Charles Kingsley.\" 31 The remaining entries are memoranda concerning Clemens' stay in New York from 15 July until after the opening of Ah Sin on 31 July. They are written from the front toward the back of the notebook, reversing the notebook's prevailing order. The entries begin on the front endpaper and continue on both sides of the front flyleaf and on the recto of each of the next two remaining leaves. 32 Susy and Clara were each sent a doll with a toy bathtub by their father along with letters (19 July 1877) giving the names and medical histories of both dolls whose ailments required a good deal of bathing. 33 Clemens visited with Dion Boucicault while in New York. He described the meeting in a letter to Howells on 29 August: \"I read passages from my play [Cap'n Simon Wheeler], & a full synopsis, to Boucicault, who was re-writing a play which he wrote & laid aside 3 or 4 years ago. . . . Then he read a passage from his play, where a real detective does some things that are as idiotic as some of my old Wheeler's performances\" (MTHL, p. 200). 34 H. W. Bergen acted as Clemens' agent for the production of Colonel Sellers for a share in the profits. The play, which was frequently revived, had been performed in the New York area from 30 April to 16 June 1877 (Bryant M. French, Mark Twain and \"The Gilded Age\" [Dallas: Southern Methodist University Press, »9 6 5],P-334.n-5)-\n\n38\n\nNotebook 1 3\n\nMrs. M . J. Shoot & Mollie. 35 Take Boarding House.

Lester and Clemens were both directors of the Hartford Accident Insurance Company. Clemens had put money into the company on the assurance that his investment would be secured against loss in return for the prestige his name would give the board of directors. The company failed, and Lester maintained that he was attempting to recover Clemens' twenty-three thousand dollars from its former president, Senator John P. Jones, Lester's brother-in-law (AD, 24 May 1906). Senator Jones finally returned Clemens' investment in March 1878. 39 On 22 August 1877 William C. Hutchings, agent for the Aetna Life Insurance Company of Hartford, wrote to Clemens requesting approval of his plan to dispose of \"the entire lot of 'Sketches' pamphlets to the Aetna Life Ins. Co.\" which had offered to pay $300 for the right to use them as a medium for company advertisements. The second state of the first edition of Mark Twain's Sketches, No. 1, a pamphlet collection of short pieces published in 1874 by the American News Company, had the advertisement for the insurance company on its back cover (Merle Johnson, A Bibliography of the Works of Mark Twain, rev. ed. [New York: Harper & Brothers, 1935], p. 23). 40 Clemens wanted Russell, a well-known comic actor, to play the part of the old detective in the play he had just written, Cap'n Simon Wheeler, The Amateur Detective, and was trying, unsuccessfully, to arrange a meeting with him. 41 Clemens purchased a copy of the three-volume first edition of Edward Lane's The Thousand and One Nigjits (London: Charles Knight & Co., 1839) in 1877 (\"Books from the Library of Mark Twain . . . ,\" Zeitlin & Ver Brugge catalogue no. 132, May 1951, item 29).\n\nMay-July\n\n39\n\nI877\n\nCapt Angrove A .

Outerbridge and Company, the agents for the ship, are written at the top of the endpaper. They are upside-down in relation to the other entries on the endpaper and flyleaf and were almost certainly written earlier. 43 It was not until 1889 that Abby Sage Richardson adapted The Prince and the Pauper successfully for the stage. 44 In a letter to Mrs. Fairbanks written on 5 February 1878, Clemens mentioned his current work on the manuscript of The Prince and the Pauper and added: \"I have been studying for it, off & on, for a year & a half\" (MTMF, p. 218). James Anthony Froude's History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada, 10 vols. (New York: Scribner & Co., 1 8 6 5 - 1 8 7 1 ) was evidently part of his background reading for the novel (\"Mark Twain Library Auction,\" Hollywood, Calif., 10 April 1951, item D76). Clemens' reminder to \"get Froude & notes,\" and the similar notes about \"Methuselah\" and Hume's History of England which follow, suggest that Clemens wrote these entries about material in his home library just before he made a short visit to the Hartford house on 16 and 17 July. Reports of a burglar in the house brought Clemens hurrying from New York just a day after he had arrived in the city from Quarry Farm. 45 During this period Clemens was working on a burlesque diary of Methuselah which was first published as part of the \"Papers of the Adam Family\" in Letters from the Earth. 46 Clemens owned a six-volume set of David Hume's History of England ( A 1 9 1 1 , item 255) which contained several chapters on Henry V I I and Henry VIII. Many of Clemens' notes for The Prince and the Pauper (DV 1 1 5 ) are keyed to page numbers in Hume's History.\n\n40\n\nNotebook 13\n\nGum-drop Ash-cat Leather head T h e fairy gives young Johnny Smith the patent duster, it being the turning point of his life—he gets the girl.

Chas must get deaf & dumb signs48 47 \"Uncle Billy\" Plunkett was one of the main characters in Ah Sin which Clemens was readying for its New York debut on 31 July at Augustin Daly's Fifth Avenue Theatre. The reading of Plunkett's letter occurs in the first act of the play, and is limited to a one-line quotation (\"Ah Sin,\" ed. Frederick Anderson [San Francisco: Book Club of California, 1961], p. 1 1 ) . Clemens' emphatic note to \"hunt\" out the long passages in the play probably refers to those written by Bret Harte. Clemens wrote to Howells on 3 August: \"I have been putting in a deal of hard work on that play in New York, & have left hardly a foot-print of Harte in it anywhere\" (MTHL,p. 192). 48 The comic sequence in which Charles Dexter, one of the characters in Cap'n Simon Wheeler, The Amateur Detective, attempts to interpret some bogus deaf and dumb sign language occurs in the third act of the play (Mark Twain's Satires they do so because they think he is the new gamekeeper (who, by mistake, < [ - - ] > is < i n > now in charge of the maniacs in the other house & < [ - - ] > vastly perplexed, too.) < D i o n Bouccicault> Dion Boucicault the dramatist gave me this idea & told me to use it-9 [#] Age in 1873 (see Notebook 19, note 196), after which Clemens referred to Reid as a \"contemptible cur\" (MTLP, p. 76) who was \"capable of stealing pea-nuts from a blind pedlar\" (MTHL, p. 92). 5 Abraham Oakey Hall was mayor of New York City from 1869 to 1872. In 1872 he was indicted and tried for collusion with \"Boss\" Tweed but won acquittal by conducting his own defense. \"Elegant Oakey\" Hall was many times caricatured by Thomas Nast in his Tweed Ring cartoons. In his biography of Nast, Albert Bigelow Paine characterizes Hall as \"a frequenter of clubs, a beau of fashion, a wit, a writer of clever tales, a punster, a versatile mountebank, a lover of social distinction and applause. . . . the dashing bandit\" of the Tweed Ring (Th. Nast: His Period and His Pictures [New York: Harper & Brothers, 1904], p. 143). Hall was president of the Lotos Club from 1870 to 1873; undoubtedly Clemens became acquainted with him there. Among Hall's \"failures\" was his 1875 debut as actor and playwright in The Crucible, which despite favorable reception closed after three months. 6 In 1877, Clemens wrote a chapter of his autobiography (MTA, 1 : 7 - 1 0 ) , a project which he worked on intermittently until his death. 7 DeVoto dated the two existing extracts from Methuselah's diary between 1876 and 1878 (LE, pp. 59-75). 8 Probably a reference to Mark Twain's unpublished story \"The Undertaker's Tale\" which he was revising about this time. He had written to Howells in October asking his advice about the story ¿ViTHL, p. 206). 9 Clemens consulted with Boucicault in the summer of 1877 about his play Cap'n Simon Wheeler, The Amateur Detective and probably got this idea for a play from the dramatist at that time.\n\nNovember i8yy-July\n\n1878\n\n51\n\nPublish scraps from my Autobiography occasionally.

J. dam [cent] T h e two Dromios. 12 Tie up in Siena, 13 Italy, in summer. 10 Mark Twain came back to this idea many times without ever bringing it to fruition. His plan for a series of \"Blindfold Novelettes\" by major authors to be based on a plot outline which he would supply is described in his letter to Howells of 12 October 1876 (MTHL, p. 160). In April 1876 Mark Twain wrote one version following the skeleton-plan entitled A Murder, A Mystery, and A Marriage (privately printed, 1945 [copy in MTP]). He hoped to enlist Charles Dudley Warner, Howells, Harte, Henry James, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell to write other versions. Notes in the Mark Twain Papers dated 1893 (DV 128) indicate that Clemens was still considering the idea at that date. 11 In 1875 Jesse M. Leathers, a distant cousin of Clemens, wrote to him in hopes of enlisting his sympathy and aid for a claim on the Lambton estate in England. Leathers believed himself to be the rightful heir to the Lambton fortune and earldom. Clemens had no interest in furthering Leathers' claim, but he considered the eccentric Kentuckian prime literary material and later used Leathers' story as a basis for The American Claimant. 12 The twin servants in Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors, Dromio of Ephesus and Dromio of Syracuse, who served twin masters, are examples of the double identity theme which persistently intrigued Clemens. A number of the preceding notes contain variants of the theme: the exchange of clothes and identities in The Prince and the Pauper, the mix-up of gamekeeper and mad-house superintendent in Boucicault's story, Leathers' claim of being the rightful heir, and the crucial mistake in telephone voices in \"The Loves of Alonzo Fitz Clarence and Rosannah Ethelton.\" 13 The itinerary for the Clemens family's trip abroad was never firmly established in advance. In a letter to Mrs. Howells in February 1878 Clemens maintained that even the vague itinerary which existed at that point was drafted by Livy (MTHL, p. 220), for he never had \"anything quite so definite as a plan.\" Despite his disclaimer, it seems clear from his notes here and on pages 59 through 61 that Clemens was taking a very active interest in the planning of the trip.\n\nNotebook 14\n\n52 Also Nuremberg 60 or 70 m from Munich. < J [ - - ] > S o l Smith R u s s e l l \" care Lee & Shepard Boston or Dorchester, Mass.

Russell wrote on 30 September 1877 to inform Clemens that he would be in New England in February 1878 and \"I shall run up and see you so soon as possible.\" Although he had supplied Clemens with a mailing address in Jacksonville, Illinois, Russell's mail now evidently reached him through the Boston book publishers Clemens noted here. 15 This and the next two entries are probably the names of pensions that had been recommended to Clemens. He had questioned Howells about accommodations in Germany; Howells replied on 24 February 1878: \"I never was in Berlin and don't know any family hotel there. I shd be glad I didn't, if it would keep you from going\" (MTHL, p. 218). 16 Livy's letter to Charles Langdon of 21 July 1878 probably refers to Weise: \"Mr Clemens is going to write your Courier in London to see if he is disengaged and can come to us for from three to four months—I don't entirely approve of having a courier but since your letter I feel as if we might be able to afford it\" (MTM). The Clemenses eventually did engage a courier, deciding against Weise in favor of George Burk, who was the portier at the Schloss-Hotel in Heidelberg. Clemens discharged Burk, whom he called a \"worthless idiot\" (SLC to Twichell, 20 November 1878, Yale), at Venice with much bad feeling on both sides.\n\nNovember i8yy-July\n\n1878\n\n53\n\n£11 per month & railway fares—he grubs & lodges himself.

Twichell correctly dates the first successful experiment as 1844. It seems likely that Clemens borrowed the anecdote and information from Twichell and in making this note misremembered the date. A few years later, in \"Happy Memories of the Dental Chair,\" Clemens retold the story of the anesthesia experiments (again mistaking the date) and included an amusing description of \"tooth-scraping\" at the hands of Dr. Riggs as a treatment for pyorrhea alveolaris—also called Riggs's disease. In the fragmentary \"Discovery of Anesthetics\" he wrote at length of Riggs and Wells, properly dating their achievement. 19 The dinner honoring the newly appointed minister to Germany, Bayard Taylor, was on 4 April 1878 at Delmonico's in New York City. Clemens and Taylor would be fellow passengers on the Holsatia.\n\n54\n\nNotebook 14\n\n40 thieves—charged $1—greeny paid it but declined to enter—said he didn't care to see the other 39.

Lester was supposedly acting as intermediary between Clemens and Senator John P. Jones, president of the company, and continually assured Clemens that repayment was imminent. J. D. Slee of the Langdon coal company agreed to act as Clemens' agent in the matter and through his intervention a meeting was arranged with Senator Jones in New York on 26 March 1878. It was apparently at that time that Jones made complete restitution to Clemens. It is not clear whether Clemens was present at the New York meeting with Jones or whether Slee attended for him. 24 The Reverends George L. Pentecost and George C . Stebbins held gospel meetings at the Hartford Skating Rink from 10 February through 19 March 1878 with immense success (Geer's Hartford City Directory and Hartford Illustrated [Hartford: Elihu Geer, 1882], p. 425). 25 Clemens was once again revising \"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven,\" the story based on one of Edgar Wakeman's anecdotes which he had worked on intermittently since 1868 (see the headnote to Notebook 7 in volume 1 for a discussion of the evolution of this piece).

Jones, were to undergo a complete reversal within a few days when Jones, upon being approached by Clemens' agent J. D. Slee, immediately wrote a check for the amount owed Clemens. Clemens' recollections of Jones in an Autobiographical Dictation of 24 May 1906 cast a more kindly light on the senator's character and on his treatment of his relatives. There Jones figures as a \"big-hearted man with ninety-nine parts of him pure generosity\" who had filled his hotel, the St. James in New York, with poor relations who were \"waiting for Jones to find lucrative occupations for them.\" ^Richard Henry Dana, Jr., author of Two Years Before the Mast, was appointed minister to England by President Grant in March 1876. Dana was to replace General Robert Schenck, who was implicated in a mining stock fraud. Dana's nomination was rejected by the Senate in April 1876 despite public approval of the choice both at home and abroad. The only real charge the Senate made against Dana was the groundless one of literary piracy.\n\nNovember i8jj-July\n\n1878\n\n57\n\nLook at the list: Polk, Tyler, Pierce, &c &c, & almost Tilden, with a suit pending for swindling the revenue.

His attack on the office of senator was never written, possibly because he had changed his opinion of Senator Jones. 29 Scribner's Monthly was internationally known for its illustrations and for the excellence of its innovative wood-engraving techniques. 30 Clemens evidently intended to develop a humorous chapter on undertakers for A Tramp Abroad from this list of anecdotes. The only story which he wrote out in full for inclusion in the book was his \"Limberger cheese story about box of guns\" (p. 59), which he eventually decided, on Howells' advice, to leave out. Howells had apparently been instrumental in an earlier suppression of this story, for Mark Twain later claimed that it had been omitted from the Atlantic Monthly version of \"Some Rambling Notes of an Idle Excursion.\" He restored the story before including his Bermuda sketch in The Stolen White Elephant ( 1 8 8 2 ) . 31 Probably Cyrus Frederick Knight ( 1 8 3 1 - 1 8 9 1 ) , a member of the Hartford Monday Evening Club and later bisliop of Milwaukee.

Clemens seems to have briefly considered reviving the Grumbler in A Tramp Abroad as a vehicle for critical observations on the American and European scene. Here Clemens added the name lengthwise beside the previous entry, indicating that he intended to attribute the Rudesheim and Bingen activities to this character. In several later entries the Grumbler is simply referred to as \" G r \" and a few Grumbler-style remarks are ascribed to the character John.

So, to go abroad is the true rest—you cease wholly to keep house, then, both national & domestic. [#] 39 Clemens copied the report almost verbatim from the New York Times of 25 March 1878. The case involved the murder of John M. Armstrong in Camden, New Jersey, for his insurance money. The crime was committed by Thomas Graham and Benjamin Hunter, Armstrong's former business partner, who hired Graham and also participated in the fatal assault. The \"lady\" is identified as both Mrs. Spellissy and Mrs. Spellesy in the newspaper accounts. 40 The controversies over the remonetization of silver and the $5.5 million Halifax fishery award were raging in Congress before Clemens' departure for Europe and for some months thereafter.\n\nNovember 1877-July\n\n1878\n\n63\n\n!-75 5_ 8.75\n\n3° 262.50 How insignificant a creature a Senator or M C is, in New York—& how great a personage he is in Washington!— We should have a much better sort of legislation if we had these swollen country jakes in New York as their capital.

A number of leaves, perhaps as many as five, are missing from this gathering of the notebook. 43 Clemens' list of characters spans the periods of his experiences in the West, on the Quaker City, and in Hartford. However, the relationship among these persons cannot now be established. 44 Clemens probably made this note on the rail trip to Fredonia in western New York State.

Albert Bigelow Paine [New York: Harper & Brothers, 1910], pp. 258-261). The incident in which Clemens was mistaken for \"Jenuel McClellan\" and given preferential treatment by the black train porter probably occurred in January 1870 when Clemens was en route to Hornellsville, New York, on a lecture tour. 46 Captain C. L. Brandt commanded the S.S. Holsatia on which the Clemenses sailed for Hamburg on 1 1 April 1878, paying \"$450 Gold\" for \"4 Adults including 2 Children\" (Dan Slote to SLC, 25 February 1878). This and the following notes (through p. 71.2) were undoubtedly written on board ship. 47 South Shields, the seaport near the mouth of the Tyne river in northern England. 48 Clemens wrote to Howells from Heidelberg on 26 May 1878: \"It occurs to me that I made a great mistake in not thinking to deliver a very bad German speech (every other sentence pieced out with English,) at the Bayard Taylor banquet in New York; I think I could have made it one of the features of the occasion\" (MTHL, p. 2 3 1 ) . Clemens had been invited to speak at the Taylor banquet but was too \"jaded and worn\" to deliver his speech (MTL, p. 327).

It is pleasant here, but 73\n\nClemens bitterly recalled his experiences with the German freight system in A Tramp Abroad (chapter 20): \"If you tell a German to send your trunk to you by 'slow freight,' he takes you at your word; he sends it by 'slow freight,' and you cannot imagine how long you will go on enlarging your admiration of the expressiveness of that phrase in the German tongue, before you get that trunk.\"\n\nNovember 1877-July 1878\n\n79\n\nwould be an offense at home. This morning a gentleman in reading room bowed to me, & later to the ladies when they entered. Every servant bows & chambermaid says good-night. I find it difficult to learn to expect these pleasant bows & be ready to return them without too sudden awkwardness. Ordered red pepper in German—waiter acted happy & intelligent, but returned no more. Rang up head waiter & ordered red pepper in English—he sent the portier up with 1 sheet paper. He understood & sent up the pepper. \"The mother-dog is the father-dog's brother.\" The Heidelberg view by night—& day.74 Indignant.

Church bells are usually hateful things—these of Heidelberg are also, no doubt, but are softened by distance. Eavesdropping at table d'hote, in eagerness to learn the language. A great business is growing up in bringing sugar-cured hams to Germany—they are much better & greatly cheaper than they can make in Germany.

Some of the words are so long that they have a perspective. W h e n one casts his glance along down one of these, it gradually tapers to a point like the receding lines of a railway track. So much elegant swearing over dinner tables &c is explained: it crept in, originally to stay & support the pupil while learning the language. [#] 7 6 Clemens was exasperated—and amused—by the multiple and contradictory meanings of certain German words, like the verbs dauern and halten. In Appendix D, \"The Awful German Language,\" of A Tramp Abroad Clemens shows the usefulness of such words, giving Schlag and Zug as examples. He concludes that \"when you load your conversational gun it is always best to throw in a Schlag or two and a Zug or two; because it doesn't make any difference how much the rest of the charge may scatter, you are bound to bag something with them.\"\n\nNotebook\n\n82 One knows a college bred man by his scars.\n\nClara reading in the sun in Castle grounds—fine old gentleman hesitated, passed on, came back & said he must tell her she was injuring her eyes.

Avoid the company of that man. In Appendix D, \"The Awful German Language,\" of A Tramp Abroad Clemens remarks: \"There is a word . . . which signifies to associate with a man, or to avoid him, according to where you put the emphasis,—and you can generally depend on putting it in the wrong place and getting into trouble.\"\n\n84\n\nNotebook 14\n\nDreamed all bad\n\nforeigners went to German Heaven—couldn't talk & wished they had gone to the other place.

As the blaze beat up around the storks' nest on the burning house, the storks flew up. But when the nest itself caught fire, the little mother threw herself into the flames and died, her wings stretched out over her young. 82 Mannheim and its famous theater were only a half hour by rail from Heidelberg.
