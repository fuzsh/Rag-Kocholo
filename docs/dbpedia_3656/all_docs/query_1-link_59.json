        "text": "Marie Murphy is a character in Not For Broadcast.\n\n“ I don't care about money. I want what I deserve, Graham! „\n\nDescription[ | ]\n\nMarie Murphy was the writer behind a television script concept called Dying Is Another Man's Job. When Graham Bannon, the script's co-writer, used his publicity to fund the Bannon Soundstage, she served as project's producer and the stage's costume designer. After the project's rocky production, her defamation by Graham, and her subsequent death in the soundstage, she emerged as an enraged spirit who haunted the building until being put to rest.\n\nPersonality[ | ]\n\nHistory[ | ]\n\nBefore The Game[ | ]\n\nLittle is known about Marie's life prior to her work with the Bannon Soundstage. She was born between the late 1920s to early 1930s, being in her late 20s as of 1956. At some point in time, she'd also meet Graham Bannon, and the two would become friends.\n\nIn 1956, she produced a television script for a show concept she conceived called Dying Is Another Man's Job. Serving as her co-writer, Graham Bannon aided her in making the script. As thanks for his help, Marie wrote Graham in the script as the show's main character, Percival Peril.\n\nUpon her completion of the script, Dying Is Another Man's Job received major acclaim by studio executives. In 1957, Graham used his publicity to order construction on the Bannon Soundstage, a 'state-of-the-art studio and production facility', to fulfill the project.\n\nWithin the same year, construction on the Bannon Soundstage was completed, and production on the show began. Marie was brought on-board as the show's writer and producer, and to design the show's costumes. Meanwhile, Graham hired several other crew for the production: Miranda was an actress and starred as 'Mary', Percival's love interest; Brent Backflip was a stunt double and performed more of the riskier stunts for Graham, and Cedric Sloane made the show's props.\n\nDuring the project's initial production, Marie helped out where she could, addressing the workplace's safety conditions (which had been made worse due to the building's poor designs and Graham continuously ignoring safety concerns) and befriending the other crew members. Since she served as the show's costume designer, Marie spent most of her time alongside the crew working with Miranda, making her costumes and discussing the show's script.\n\nProduction did not go smoothly, as Graham Bannon tended to get into altercations with his staff, and would frequently cut corners in order to save money. Marie wrote several letters to him, urging against his ignoring of safety concerns and repeated cutting of the budget she had to make the harness costume for one of Brent Backflip's stunts. Graham disregarded her concerns, and the relationship between the two soured. Shortly after, as a result of his actions, Brent plunged to the floor of the Sound Stage during the aforementioned stunt, breaking both of his legs.\n\nFollowing Brent's failed stunt, production continued amidst rising tensions, and Marie and Graham got into more altercations over his handling of the project. With their relationship shattered, Graham then took full credit for the conception of Dying Is Another Man's Job. He ordered staff to gather all original manuscripts and footage (which only Marie and he had viewed, since nobody except writers and directors were authorized to view the original footage until a later date) in the Projector Room, setting them on fire with his own brand of petroleum.\n\nAfter the footage was burnt, and her credit stolen from her, Marie was outraged. Graham periodically paid Marie money to keep her quiet about the truth regarding the show's production, and spread rumors that she started the fire. Any footage made afterwards wouldn't mention her as a writer and producer behind the script, only as the show's costume designer.\n\nEventually, the money Graham gave to Marie wouldn't be enough to silence her. Through letters written back-and-forth between the two, Marie demanded her role as the show's writer and producer be given back to her. The two met in the Dressing Room, where Marie threatened to reveal that she wrote the script. Graham doubted that anyone would believe her because she was a woman, and slapped her face.\n\nMarie would later encounter Graham while he was bundling rope in the Sound Stage. She expressed disgust at the revisions Graham made to the script, believing it ruined her show. Marie taunted Graham, who seemingly destroyed all of the footage that credited Marie as the show's writer, by revealing a copy still existed. This angered Graham, who repeatedly demanded to know where the copy was, stating that she would destroy everything. Marie replied that she didn't care, and backed up as Graham slowly approached her, rope in hand.\n\nWhile backing away, Marie either tripped or was pushed by Graham, and fell through the trapdoor to the Vault, dying upon impact or fatally injuring herself. Graham watched as she fell, before dropping his rope and walking away, leaving her to her fate. Several hours later, he returned to the Vault and moved Marie's dead body, hanging her up with rope and framing her death as a suicide.\n\nAfter Marie's body was discovered, production was cancelled shortly after, and the Vault was sealed. Marie would be posthumously blamed for both Brent Backflip's fall and the building's fire.\n\nAdditional Content[ | ]\n\nDay 85: Live & Spooky[ | ]\n\nMain article: Day 85: Live & Spooky\n\nAds[ | ]\n\nMarie Murphy has starred in one advertisement.\n\nNation's Nightfall Report\n\nGallery[ | ]\n\nTrivia[ | ]"
