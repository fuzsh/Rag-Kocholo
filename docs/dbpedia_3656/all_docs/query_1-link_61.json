It only arrived on my TBR last year because I took pity on it and another book by the same author at the annual Dutch BookCrossing meeting last year as it was left at the end. Both might have languished unread…",

        "text": "Sunset House is rather like a 1930s prequel to Peter Mayle’s 1989 A Year in Provence, with fewer problems with builders. To be honest, I was expecting to be disappointed, but that meant it was an unexpected delight. In Sunset House, the author has been widowed and cannot afford to stay in the beautiful house and garden she had created with her husband. Staying with a good friend, an American she names only as ‘Mademoiselle’, she spots and falls in love with a tiny cottage and terraced olive groves, just down the hill from her friend’s castle. She immediately envisages the garden she could plant. First she has to negotiate with the locals, characterised by her as ‘peasants’.\n\nThanks to Peter Mayle, the story is a familiar one, oft repeated since, with variations depending on the arrogance of the foreign arrivals, their willingness to speak French and to get to know the locals. The added interest in Lady Fortescue’s account is when it was written, in 1937. War was only two years away, expats roamed the Riviera, but for many of the French and Italian people who lived in the villages and farms, little had changed for generations.\n\nThe simple life for expats\n\nIn September she spends time with her friend, ‘Mademoiselle’, at coastguard cottages on a cliff above what they called the Bay of Good Hope. There are no mod cons, unless you count the servant who comes every day to cook and clean and build an ‘outside inconvenience’ for them behind the cottages. The only thing they need to do is relax, go swimming and rambling, go beachcombing for driftwood for their fires and supplement their rations by scavenging limpets, baby octopuses (pulpi), and catching sea urchins with improvised harpoons. Local fishermen come daily to bring their catch, along with gossip from St Tropez, where Mademoiselle has a studio.\n\nBook serendipity: sardines\n\nIn St Tropez at Mademoiselle’s studio, the owner grills them fresh sardines for breakfast, though the author cannot stomach them. In The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, the main character mentions eating a sardine salad, which I have to say doesn’t appeal.\n\nBook serendipity: healers\n\nWhen her friend hurts her foot, they pay a visit to Nicolas, a fisherman with an extraordinary gift of healing by touch and manual manipulation. Local people come from far and wide, many unable to pay, and more wealthy patrons send their cars to summon him. He has even been known to cure animals and has the remarkable ability to sense when someone needs him, returning home to help without being called. What is more, her friend tells her that there are many such healers in Provence. In another book I am currently reading, the ARC of The Sun Singer by Coti De Laine, there is another miraculous healer who senses other people’s misery. In that case, however, the healer has even more miraculous powers as he appears to be Jesus himself, returned to Earth in a near-future world.\n\nSigns of the times\n\n“We had arrived at the apéritif hour, when semi-nude modernity in all its forms invaded the place to drink cocktails. Its arrival was heralded by a chorus of shrieking klaxons, as great cars came snorting into the town, covered with these curious creatures (seen only in the south of France, and they must be seen to be believed). They overflowed the seats inside, squatted on the bonnets, and balanced themselves on the running-boards. They assaulted the quiet town with their arrogant possessiveness. They perched upon the restaurant tables and shouted for their favourite drinks.”\n\nAs the book was published in 1937, I was on the lookout for rumblings of war and thought I had found them when the author was greeted by the sound of a strident German voice. However, it was not at all what I was expecting; it is the sound of “a Teutonic voice bawling advertisements for tooth-powder, boots, motor-oil, and other commodities.”\n\nChristmas in Provence\n\nThere is a lovely description of Christmas shopping in the Monoprix store “(so-called because nothing in it is of the same price).” The hustle and bustle is the same as in Britain, but the music playing is jazz rather than Christmas carols. The more expensive shops are deserted as there are no British or American tourists due to rumours of war and the collapse of the pound (74 francs to the pound). There are not enough people to justify keeping open the English Church, so their Christmas service is held in a room at the Grand Hotel.\n\nThe author tells several amusing and touching anecdotes about Christmas at the chateau and the still uncompleted Sunset House. I especially liked the surprise the servants had prepared for the two ladies, “a little Christmas tree decorated with oyster shells and snail shells slung on the branches, filled with oil and tiny wicks, and then lit—a lovely form of illumination. They had made stars and hearts and tiny boxes of split palm leaves cleverly twisted and plaited; and had hung chocolates, wrapped in glittering tinted paper, and gilded walnuts on every branch to give colour and light.” Underneath this was a crib with plaster animals lying down “so that their breath might warm the Holy Child in His low wooden manger”, a Provençal tradition. Baby Jesus was made of wax, lying in a chocolate sabot, adored by Mary and Joseph and kneeling peasants bringing gifts of bread and jars of oil and wine.\n\nAnother Provençal tradition is for each family member to place a candle on the outside windowsill and make a wish or prayer. The light of the candle guides the wishes to the right destination. In addition to various Christmas cards, they also receive beautiful painted cardboard crêches, or cribs. By cutting holes and sticking transparent coloured paper in the gaps, “when placed before a candle or electric light the star in the east with its shaft of light pointing to the stable, the stable window with its view star-spangled sky, the halos of the madonna and of the surrounding angels, glow with mysterious light.”\n\nBeing rather hazy on the history of the royal family in the last 125 years, I was surprised at Lady Fortescue’s nostalgia about listening to the radio broadcast of the King’s Christmas message. I imagined George VI, but it was his father George V, who had been king during the First World War. “I thought of all I loved in England, of the King who, because of his life of service for his Empire, could never know this peace. I heard the voice of ‘Monsieur’ [her late husband] say: ‘The King is the hardest-worked man in his Dominions.’ I remembered those days at Windsor, during the war, when a continuous stream of telegraph boys flowed to the Castle, bringing the King despatches from the Front, and messages from all over the world, so that even at dinner he was obliged to keep a pad of telegraph forms by his side in order that he might write immediate replies. How, when he had dismissed his Household for the night at 10 P.M., he went into his study with his private secretary and started work again.“ After the recent royal conspiracy theories, it’s hard not to question how much of this was royal propaganda.\n\nLocal colour\n\nI love this sort of book for the small details that could so easily have been lost to history. For instance, local men visit a coiffeur for a weekly shave. The mobility we take for granted was a luxury for the poorer people. The Italian owner of the cottage had arrived with his parents aged six and had never left the village since, though his wife took the bus into the town.\n\nBook serendipity: spitoons!\n\nThis is the fourth book I have read recently that mentioned spitoons. An heirloom spitoon plays an important role in Midnight’s Children by Salman Rushdie. In South Riding by contemporary Winifred Holtby, a man fitting out a country pub in the 1930s provides a large number of spitoons. In Sunset House, a man is wondering what to do with the end of his cheroot. “His desperate eye roved about in search of the convenient spitoon provided by all French estaminets and cafés.” Now I’m wondering when the ashtray superseded the spitoon, or if they are the same thing, but rebranded when it became socially unacceptable to spit. They are also known as cuspidors. Incidentally, at the outdoor historical museum in Arnhem, there are notices in the trams announcing fines for spitting.\n\nBook serendipity: a tame mouse\n\nAn important character in Stephen King’s The Green Mile is Mr Jingles the trained mouse. So I was astounded to discover another one in Sunset House. Or rather, in Mademoiselle’s chateau, where a Russian she employed had made friends with a mouse, and it shared his meals every day.\n\nConstant companions\n\nAnother particularly delightful chapter is about a camping trip high in the mountains to escape a heatwave at lower altitudes. Camping on a high plateau to take advantage of the coolness created by no less than three glaciers, I was rather horrified to read that they not only diverted a glacial stream to run closer to their tents but also created a pool so they could cool off. They can’t have been too far off the beaten track though, because locals and visitors visited them to take photos as if they were a tourist attraction.\n\nThe ladies were obviously well embedded in the local villages and were competent at speaking French and understanding local dialects. But Winifred would not have made a very good translator, unless she transcribed conversations to sound like deliberate Franglais. In the quote below, poser is the French verb for installing and deranger for to disturb.\n\n“I retired to my studio, there to write in seclusion (as I hoped), whilst Monsieur C. posed that service-lift. He must on no account be deranged during his important work.”\n\nWinifred, Lady Fortescue\n\nThe author was an actress who married a much older military man who was later awarded a lifetime peerage, hence the title of Lady. Born in 1888, the vicar’s daughter Winifred Beech was initially educated at home, later sent away to school on the advice of her doctor. She trained for the stage at F.R. Benson’s Dramatic School, joining Herbert Tree’s theatrical group, and with one of the leading actors of the time, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, she co-starred in Jerome K. Jerome’s The Passing of the Third Floor Back, with which was a rather sombre and religious play. It was a great commercial success, but was panned by critics, with Max Beerbohm writing that it was “vilely stupid” and by a “tenth-rate writer”.\n\nAfter her marriage, she retired from the stage and set up an interior decorating and dress design business until health problems forced her to give those up too. Undaunted, she started writing for Punch, the Daily Chronicle and The Evening News, then started the women’s page at the Morning Post. When her husband Sir John Fortescue retired as Royal Librarian and Archivist at Windsor, they moved to Provence as they could live better there than in England for the same money. This was to bring Lady Fortescue the inspiration for her book writing career. Her first book was based around their experiences setting up their home and garden in France, the 1935 Perfume from Provence (a book I didn’t pick up, sadly). Sunset House is the sequel, published of course in 1937.\n\nMy copy of Sunset House was published in 1993 by Black Swan, with a frontispiece by E.H. Shepard, with the author named only Lady Fortescue. Her first name was Winifred and her friend Mademoiselle was in fact Elisabeth Starr, whose chateau was known as the Castello. Sunset House was in reality called Domaine de Fort Escu, both in Opio near Grasse. As she points out in the book for the less observant amongst us, Fort Escu is a play on words, i.e. it’s her surname. Winifred Fortescue had an extraordinary life, including nursing wounded soldiers in WWI. As a result of this she had a recurring mysterious illness she referred to as ‘the poison’. She mentions that her friend was struck down by something similar, and I wonder if she didn’t transfer that detail from herself to Mademoiselle in her books, just as she renamed places and people so they were not directly identifiable. You can read much more about Winifred Fortescue, including photographs, on this page dedicated to her.\n\nMore photos here, including one taken in 1936 in the courtyard of Sunset House. The text is the same as the site above, slightly abbreviated.\n\nThere is also an excellent summary of Elisabeth Starr’s life on Elisa Rolle’s blog about LGBT relationships.\n\nYou can see a photo of Sunset House on this page about Opio, the village where the house and chateau are both located, though nowadays there are far more houses than back then."
