The four girls had compatible personalities and became automatic friends.

Several students heavily criticized Mary at school, while several Slytherins felt that the event was a joke and merely laughed at the incident.

Due to Fabian rescuing Mary the pair formed a tight bond and later on developed romantic feelings for each other.\n\nAfter Hogwarts\n\nPhysical Appearance\n\nMary is an attractive girl with very feminine features. Mary has high cheek bones, bright blue eyes, a thin nose, flawless skin, and pouty lips that make her desirable to many male students.\n\nMany say that Mary had a nose job done during the summer before sixth year. Her nose was always thin and pointed but had a small bump on the bridge. Returning the new school year with a fresh hairdo and a slope nose instead of a bump.\n\nMary doesn't have a very curvy figure for she is mostly just thin. However, Mary wears push-ups and low cut tops to attract attention to her average sized breasts.\n\nPersonality and Traits\n\nMary is a lover of soap operas, fashion, boys, and girly things. She is very protective of her close friends.\n\nMary has a sassy attitude\n\nRelationships\n\nFamily\n\nMary was adopted by muggles Kenneth and Denise Macdonald when she was only 18 months old.\n\nRomantic\n\nFriends\n\nHestia Jones and Mary met in first year in\n\nMagical Abilities and Skills\n\nMary is very talented in herbology, having taken a liking to the subject in first year."
