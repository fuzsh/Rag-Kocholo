        "text": "Diana Simmonds and Suzi Whitehead had us on their fabulous arts show on Eastside Radio 89.7FM this morning, to talk about our new book, Wendy Sharpe: Many Lives. Thanks to these wonderful women for a great discussion on art and writing. It was great fun. Here's a link to the episode.\n\nHere's my obituary on Terry Ingram, who wrote the Saleroom column in the The Australian Financial Review for an incredible 44 years. I met Terry just once. I went to his home 18 months ago. It was just before taking up the Saleroom reins from Gabriella Coslovich who was undertaking other projects. Terry hadn't written Saleroom for many years, but I just wanted to acknowledge his work and the fact that Saleroom would never have existed without him. It has contributed so much to the Australian art world, by recording the weekly comings and goings on the art market. I'm so glad I did visit Terry, because now he is gone. Vale Terry Ingram."
