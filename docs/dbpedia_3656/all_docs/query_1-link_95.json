        "text": "The Call The Midwife cast has been a veritable revolving door during its past 10 series.\n\nOur favourite period drama has been a breeding ground for fantastic acting talent, and over the years it has produced some notable performances by much-loved actresses who have gone on to bigger and better things.\n\nBut where are all the former members of the cast and what are they up to now?\n\nWhere are all the old favourites from the Call The Midwife cast?\n\nEmerald Fennell\n\nNurse Patience Mount\n\n2013-2017\n\nEmerald left Call The Midwife after series six, and since then she’s been in demand.\n\nStarring as Camilla Parker Bowles in The Crown brought her global fame.\n\nBut Emerald, 35, has been busy behind the camera, too.\n\nIn 2018, she wrote series two of BBC thriller, Killing Eve, and only last week bagged an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Promising Young Woman.\n\nElsewhere, she gave birth to a son in 2019 and announced at the Oscars that she was pregnant with her second child.\n\nMiranda Hart\n\nMatron Camilla ‘Chummy’ Fortescue-Cholmondeley-Browne\n\n2012-2015\n\nComedian Miranda became a fan favourite with her first serious acting role in Call The Midwife.\n\nWhen she left after series four, she went back to her comedic roots with tours, and TV specials Miranda: Morecambe & Wise and Me, Comic Relief and Miranda’s Games with Showbiz Names.\n\nShe also wrote a children’s book in 2017.\n\nJennifer Kirby\n\nNurse Valerie Dyer\n\n2017-2020\n\nDespite being a popular character in Call The Midwife from series six to nine, Jennifer decided to call it a day in 2020.\n\nAnd, ever since the pandemic, it’s all quiet on the Kirby front. However, her career on the stage and her appearance in Call The Midwife surely sets her up for a glittering career.\n\nJessica Raine\n\nJenny Lee\n\n2012-2014\n\nThe lynchpin of the show for the first three series, 38-year-old Jessica left the show in 2014.\n\nShe made a memorable appearance in series two of Line of Duty in 2014, and since then she has appeared in BBC thrillers Informer and Baptiste.\n\nIn 2015, Jessica married fellow actor Tom Goodman-Hill, and in 2019 she gave birth to a baby boy.\n\nPam Ferris\n\nSister Evangelina\n\n2012-2016\n\nAnother of the original cast, Pam was already a well-known face on television thanks to roles in The Darling Buds Of May and Rosemary & Thyme.\n\nBut her appearance as the no-nonsense Sister Evangelina reignited her career.\n\nSeventy-two-year-old Pam has been quiet recently – the last thing viewers saw of her was the movie Tolkein and the Sky Arts comedy series, Urban Myths.\n\nBryony Hannah\n\nSister Mary Cynthia\n\n2012-2017\n\nCompassionate and softly-spoken, Cynthia appeared in the first six series.\n\nSince leaving the show, mum-of-one Bryony played Cath in Unforgotten in 2017, and earlier this year appeared in this year’s series of Death In Paradise.\n\nShe played Rebecca Morley."
