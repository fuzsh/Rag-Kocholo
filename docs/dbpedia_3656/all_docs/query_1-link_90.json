        "text": "Wednesday 8th October saw loyal customers, celebrities, press and dedicated followers of fashion flock to the Queens Park boutique for a party to celebrate ten years of Iris – the chain of fashion stores established by local mothers Annie Pollet and Sarah Claassen. Catering to the needs of local women wishing to look stylish and shop locally, Iris sells a cleverly-edited array of easy to wear fashion & accessories by desirable off-duty labels including Acne, Isabel Marant and Jerome Dreyfuss and has become the go-to destination for savvy shoppers in Battersea, Chiswick, Amersham and Queens Park, where the store is conveniently (and dangerously…) a stone’s throw from the MLPR HQ. With DJ Lisa Moorish on the decks and canapes served from local eaterie The Salusbury guests including Made in Chelsea star and fashion blogger Rosie Fortescue, actress Jemma Powell and girl about town Kelly Eastwood mingled with InStyle’s fashion director Arabella Greenhill, ES Magazine’s Orsolya Szabo and Victoria Woodall from You magazine. Guests were delighted with their goodie bags including gifts from Iris, Swanky lash and nail bar, Hanky Panky, Nail Station and Iris-stocked label American Vintage as they took in the latest edit of covetable womenswear, childrens clothes and accessories on the rails. A wonderful night to celebrate a decade of style – and check out the newly launched online store for those not in the Iris postcodes:\n\nhttp://www.irisfashion.co.uk/"
