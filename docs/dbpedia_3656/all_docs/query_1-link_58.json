        "text": "GREG FORTESCUE\n\nBOYD'S STATION | Founding Board OF DIRECTOR\n\nGreg Fortescue is a senior staff attorney at the California Supreme Court, but man, did he cover some ground before he got there! He grew up in Detroit, which explains his passion for anything on wheels. He is also a recovering actor, having studied theater at the University of Michigan and American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. After bouncing between Los Angeles and New York for a few years chasing gigs in the limelight, he decided he’d better hang up the pumpkin pants and rapier to search for steadier work.\n\nFor a time he installed large scale art installations at Dia Center for the Arts in New York City. Then he taught at an all-girls Catholic school in New York, probably the smartest decision of his life because it was there he met another teacher who later became his wife. Greg also worked for several years in medical publishing and was a founding employee of one of the earliest web sites in the history called Medscape, a site that still exists twenty years later. Greg has worked for a number of other large-scale Internet companies, such as Quokka Sports (NBCOlympics.com, FinalFour.net, motogp.com) and Clearstation (an E*TRADE company).\n\nWhen his restless brain grew antsy once again, he enrolled in UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. After graduating, Greg spent several years as a civil litigator in the Bay Area before finding what he hopes is his last professional home as a staff attorney at California’s highest court."
