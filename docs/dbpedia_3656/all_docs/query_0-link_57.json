This book introduces the analysis of language structure, combining both description and theory within a single, practical text. It begins by examining words and parts of words, and then looks at how words work together to form sentences that communicate meaning. Sentence patterns across languages are also studied, looking at the similarities and the differences we find in how languages communicate meaning. The book also discusses how context can affect how we structure our sentences: the context of a particular language and its structures, the context of old and new information for us and our addressee(s), and the context of our culture. e m m a l . p a v e y is Assistant Professor of Linguistics at the Canada Institute of Linguistics at Trinity Western University.\n\nThe Structure of Language An Introduction to Grammatical Analysis\n\nEMMA L.

Remaining mistakes are of course mine.\n\nxiii\n\nNotes for instructors and readers\n\nThis book is intended to be read in order, from chapter 1 to chapter 9, as each chapter builds on the content of previous chapters. It contains a large number of exercises, over one hundred in total; chapters 2 to 8 contain two sets of exercises, one set based on English and another set based on other languages. The degree of difficulty of each exercise is indicated with asterisks: exercises with two asterisks present more of a challenge than those with one asterisk. Several chapters include text-based exercises both to provide variety and to guide the reader towards a more realistic experience of linguistic fieldwork. There are also ‘mini-exercises’ in the text of each chapter, and additional exercises and resources are available on the web via Cambridge University Press. In addition, this book offers an extensive glossary (glossary items appear in the text in bold, small capitals at their first occurrence) and a list of the 200+ languages referred to in this book; the language list includes references where more information on each language may be found. A native or advanced level of English is assumed of the reader, but only basic linguistic terminology is presupposed. As such, this book is ideally suited to a second-level undergraduate class. It is also appropriate for an introductory graduate-level class, particularly where the student is migrating from studying formal approaches to syntax to a more functional approach (chapters 3 to 9 in particular). Much of the syntactic framework used in this book comes from Role and Reference Grammar Theory. For more comprehensive detail concerning this theory, the reader is directed to consult Van Valin (2005) or Van Valin and LaPolla (1997).\n\nxiv\n\nAbbreviations\n\n1 2 3 i ii iii a aaj abil abl abs absol acc adj adn adv advr aff afx agr agt all an ant antip aor appl art asp asrt assoc assum attr atv aug\n\n1st person 2nd person 3rd person class/type 1 class/type 2 class/type 3 (etc.) actor argument-adjunct adpositional phrase abilitative case ablative absolutive absolute accusative adjective adnominal modifier adverb/adverbial adversative affirmative affix agreement agentive case allative animate anterior antipassive aorist applicative article aspect assertive/assertative associative assumed evidential attributive active voice augmented number xv\n\nxvi\n\nAbbreviations\n\naux av bel ben bv caus cl clf clm cm cn coll com comp compl conj consec cont contr cop cst cvb dat dcop decl def deic dem der des det detr dex dfut dim dir dir.ev dirc disj dist dlmt dm d-s dstr\n\nauxiliary agentive voice belonging or association benefactive borrowed verb causative clitic classifier / class marker clause linkage marker causee marker common noun collective comitative complementizer completive conjunct consecutive marker continuative aspect contrastive focus particle copula contrast converb dative deictic copula declarative definite deictic demonstrative derivational affix desiderative determiner detransitivizer indexer distant future diminutive directional direct evidence evidential direct case disjunct distal delimitative dependency marker derived single argument distributive\n\nAbbreviations\n\ndu dub dur emph ep erg evid excl exist ext f fin foc frust fut fv gen giv h hab hort hsy id if imp inan incl ind indf inf infl infr ingr ins int intr ipfv irr iter ix lat ldp lim lnk\n\ndual dubitative durative emphatic emphatic pronoun ergative evidential exclusive existential extension particle feminine finite verb focus frustrative future final vowel genitive given human habitual hortative hearsay evidential identifiable illocutionary force imperative inanimate inclusive indicative indefinite infinitive inflectional affix inferred evidential ingressive instrumental interrogative intransitive imperfective irrealis iterative use of the index finger to point lative left-detached position limitative linker\n\nxvii\n\nxviii\n\nAbbreviations\n\nloc m min mkr ml mod n nasp ndu neg neut nf nfut nh nm nmlz nom np npfp npip nprs npst nrl nsg nuc num nvis obj objv obl oblig obs onom ov p pass pat pau pbl pc pfv pl pn pocs\n\nlocative masculine minimal number marker male modality neuter nominal aspect non-dual negation neutral non-final marker non-future tense non-human non-masculine nominalizer nominative noun phrase noun phrase final position noun phrase initial position non-present non-past tense non-relational prefix non-singular nucleus number non-visual evidential object objective oblique obligation observational onomatopoeia objective voice preposition passive patient paucal possibility perfect converb perfective plural proper noun post-core slot\n\nAbbreviations\n\npol poss post pot pp prcs prdr pred prep pret prf pro prob proc prog prop pros prox prp prs psa pst ptcl ptcp purp q qnt qual rc rdp rec recp red ref refl reflposs rel rem remf rep res rl rp rpro\n\npolite possessive posterior potential mood adpositional phrase pre-core slot predicator predicate preposition preterite tense perfect aspect pronoun probability process progressive proper name prospective aspect proximal present active participle present tense privileged syntactic argument past tense particle participle purposive question marker/particle quantification qualitative relative clause right-detached position recent past reciprocal reduplication referential reflexive reflexive possessive relative marker remote past remote future reported evidential resultative realis reference phrase relative pronoun\n\nxix\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nKEY TOPICS r r\n\nLanguage for communication The structure of this book\n\nMost of the time, if not all of the time, we communicate with each other using language without considering the complex activity we are undertaking, forming complex words and sentences in a split second. We know immediately when someone uses language structures that are inappropriate or incorrect because we have learned the rules that govern the language(s) we use. In this book, we will look at the structures we use in more detail, in order to help us to understand the structures we find in languages that may be arranged in ways quite different from English. There are many approaches to the study of language. Some linguists are more interested in discovering the basic, innate structures that we all have in our brains, regardless of which language(s) we speak. Linguists working in what is known as the generative tradition seek to understand universal grammar, the structures that human languages have in common and that we may be born with the capacity to use. The generative approach focuses on the formal characteristics of language structure, seeking to uncover the rules that ‘generate’ well-formed sentences. Other linguists take a more functional approach, studying language use in context; in other words, what actually comes out of our mouths rather than what may be stored in our heads. Functional approaches seek to incorporate the meaning and broader context of language in order to fully understand language structure. In this book I present a practical, functional approach to describing and explaining language structure. In chapter 2, I present a step-by-step approach to analysing the structure of words: the study of morphology. Chapters 3 to 8 draw specifically on Role and Reference Grammar theory (RRG) to help us understand the structure of sentences by looking at form (syntax), meaning (semantics) and function (pragmatics) (Van Valin and LaPolla 1997, Van Valin 2005). As well as being a functional theory interested in language as a means of communication, RRG theory seeks to be typologically adequate, to present a level playing field for the analysis of all languages. This book does not cover every aspect of RRG theory; for that, the reader is directed to the references. Rather, this book is an 1\n\n2\n\nintroduction\n\nintroduction to the analysis of language structure, and I will make use of aspects of RRG theory as a useful tool for that purpose. In order to study language you need to look both at the big picture and the small component parts of language. To take an analogy, consider psychologists and neurosurgeons. Both are ‘head doctors’, examining the way the brain works. However, while a neurosurgeon might cut you open and look at different parts of your brain, a psychologist is more likely to examine your behaviour and how you actually use your brain. Both are essential (as well as lots of other types of ‘head doctors’) for a complete understanding of the brain, and both do different things well to that end: however, the psychologist cannot help you much with a tumour, and a neurosurgeon cannot cure you of compulsively eating chocolate cake. In this book, I will ‘cut language up’ into component parts in each chapter in order to ultimately have a better understanding of how it functions as a whole, integrated thing in the minds, mouths and hands of speakers. In the next section I will introduce some general features of language, and then move on to a description of the contents of the book.\n\n1.\n\nLanguage for communication\n\n1.1\n\nA symbolic gesture 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nOnomatopoeia describes words that sound like their meaning, such as buzz, click and meow. Onomatopoeia is one type of iconicity; something is iconic in this sense if it resembles its meaning in some way. This: . . . . . . is an iconic sign because it resembles the thing it is representing. There is a direct relationship between the form of the word and the thing it represents. However, for the vast majority of words in any language the relationship is arbitrary. The sound of a word bears no direct relationship to the meaning it represents. Thus bird, oiseau, p´ajaro and ndege are arbitrary sequences of sounds used to represent the idea of a bird (in English, French, Spanish and Swahili respectively). Our ability to deal with arbitrary symbols means we can use language as an abstract system; we can talk about things that are not physically present because we can associate the word with the referent even though there is only an arbitrary connection between the form and the meaning. When we manipulate such arbitrary symbols, it is more than a Pavlovian response (Deacon 1997: 68). As an abstract system, we can also use language to talk about events in the past, events within events (e.g. the man I saw last week is waving at me) or even events in the imagination. In terms of language structure, we also find some arbitrariness: some languages put the verb last in a sentence, while others put it at the beginning. At the same\n\n1. Language for communication\n\ntime, as we will see in chapters 7 to 9 in particular, we do find some iconicity in the connection between certain sentence structures and the meanings they express. 1.2\n\nDo you know what I mean? 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nIf you hear someone speak, or watch someone sign, in a language that you do not know, what thoughts cross your mind? Can you tell where the words begin and end? Do you consider it borderline miraculous that another person could take any kind of meaning from that stream of sound or signs? The reality is that practically every human being gleans a great deal of meaning from such streams of communication in at least one language, and without a great deal of conscious thought about the structure of the words and sentences they are using. One of the most central factors that governs all language structures and communication is the tension between understandability and economy. Essentially, this tension refers to the fact that we would like to get our message across as clearly as possible with as little effort as possible. In addition, language speakers are constantly creating new language forms, primarily words but also structures. We can process and produce sentences we have never heard or spoken before, because we know how to interpret the words and structures we hear. We will examine in the next section how this is possible. 1.3\n\nWhat it is and what it’s for 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nWhen we study the component parts of a language, we are interested, then, in two things: what the parts do and what they look like; in other words, the function and the form. Think of a pencil. We can describe the basic formal features of a pencil: it is a long, thin, pointed implement with a non-ink based marker enclosed in wood. Its basic function, on the other hand, is as an instrument for writing and drawing. So it is with language. The form of a word (or sign), for example, is its phonological shape. Its function is what we do with the word; in other words, how we use it to communicate. We will see that it is important to be aware that we can use other things, things with a different form, to perform the same function. Instead of a pencil, for example, you could write with a pen or a piece of chalk or with paint. In addition, you could use your pencil for other functions, such as pointing to something or scratching your back. Once again, we can draw an analogy with language: in the examples in (1), we see the same ‘form’ a tall student being used in two different functions. (1) (a) (b)\n\nA tall student stole my stapler. Norman is a tall student.\n\nIn (1a), the sequence of words a tall student has the function of picking out a particular referent; in other words, it is used to tell us something about the\n\n3\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\nidentity of the one who stole the stapler. In (1b), on the other hand, a tall student does not pick out a particular referent; instead, it gives us more descriptive information about the referent picked out by Norman. Do not worry if this distinction is not totally clear at this point; we will be returning to this difference in chapter 3. In the sentences in (2), on the other hand, we see different forms performing the same function. (2) (a) (b) (c)\n\nThat Norman stole my stapler saddens me. Stealing saddens me. Norman saddens me.\n\nIn every case, the function of the underlined element is to pick out the thing that saddens me, even though the form of the underlined element is different: we have a clause in (a), a verb in (b) and a noun in (c). We need to make sure we look not only at the shape or form of an element but also at the function(s) it can have in the sentence.

The concepts we will encounter are supported and illustrated by data from over 225 signed and spoken languages. In addition, at the end of each chapter there are two sets of exercises, one set based on English and one with data from a wide variety of other languages. These are graded for their level of difficulty: one asterisk ∗ indicates an easier exercise, while those with two asterisks ∗∗ are more challenging. When we seek to analyse a language, particularly a little-known language, we do not always have access to lists of pre-selected data in nice, neat lists, as we see in most of the exercises in this book. In fact, it is advisable, in seeking to elicit ‘natural’ data, to record various types of texts rather than isolated sentences. In learning about language structures, it is best to begin by practising with neat sets of data, but I have also included text-based exercises so that you can practise both types of analysis.\n\n2 The structure of language – a preview\n\n2.1\n\nThe chapters 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nIn this book I begin with the smallest meaningful units of language structure and move all the way through to examining complex sentences. In terms of the study of linguistics as a whole, we begin our linguistic journey on the outskirts of phonology (the study of sound patterns) and march right up to the borders of discourse (the study of how whole texts are structured). In this section, I will briefly introduce the topics of each chapter. 2.1.1 Chapter 2: the structure of words In the next chapter, we will examine morphology, which is the study of parts of words. Many words can be divided into pieces (morphemes), each of which conveys a different part of the meaning of the whole. For example, if you were to chop up the word underfunded you would probably end up with under-fund-ed, and you would no doubt also be able to describe the meaning of each part of the word as it contributes to the whole. In this chapter we will learn how to ‘find’ various types of morphemes and how to describe the ways in which they fit together to form words in different languages. 2.1.2 Chapter 3: the structure of sentences In chapter 3, we build on our knowledge of morphology to study syntax, which is the study of sentence structure. We will see how the meaning of a sentence and the way it is expressed are closely connected and that there are certain core components that all languages have in common. We will also learn a way to represent the syntactic structures that we find. We will look at the basic elements of the sentence that tell us about what happened and who was involved, and examine different ways that languages express these parts of meaning. In addition, we will look at the modifying elements that give more detail of various kinds, such as when it happened (tense) or indeed whether it happened or not (negation). 2.1.3 Chapter 4: the structure of meaning If syntactic structure is one half of a coin, the meaning of a sentence is the other. This is the study of semantics, and we shall examine it further in chapter 4. We will look at a way to describe the various types of events and situations that sentences describe, and a method for representing those types that can be used for any language. We will see that there is a close connection between the type of event and the roles of the participants in that event. 2.1.4 Chapter 5: integrating language structure The background that we establish in chapters 3 and 4 will enable us to examine grammatical relations in chapter 5. We will look at how languages express\n\n5\n\n6\n\nintroduction\n\nwho did what to whom in their morphology and syntax, and how this ties in with the meaning of the sentence and the roles of the participants. We will find several general patterns across languages and will learn ways to describe and account for the patterns we find. We will also look at ways that languages play with their basic pattern, using voice constructions, for example, to focus on different participants in an event. 2.1.5 Chapter 6: the structure of phrases In chapter 6, we focus particularly on the structure of two types of elements in language, noun phrases like the blue balloon and adpositional phrases like on the roof and after many attempts. We will look at the different elements that can occur in noun phrases and the ways that languages express these. We will also look at the different semantic roles that adpositional phrases can have and the ways these too are expressed. This chapter also features a look at other types of phrases that modify the main event in some way. 2.1.6 Chapter 7: complex structures With an understanding of basic sentences under our belts, in chapter 7 we turn to more complex structures, sentences that describe more than one event. We will examine the different parts of sentences that can be combined, and the different relationships between those connected parts. We then take a closer look at two common types of complex constructions. We look at serial verb constructions, where a sequence of more than one verb is used to describe a single event, and also at types of relative clauses, which tell us more about a noun, such as who made this sweater in the child who made this sweater. 2.1.7 Chapter 8: the structure of information In chapter 8 we add a third string to our bow, a string that works alongside syntax and semantics in determining how we formulate our sentences: the study of pragmatics, or information structure. The ‘new’ and ‘old’ information in what we want to communicate affects how we choose to express what we want to say. For example, it makes the difference between choosing to say I spray-painted your cat and It was me who spray-painted your cat. We will see how the structure of information affects how we describe participants (e.g. he, that guy, Bob, etc.) and how sentences are structured in all languages. In addition, we take a closer look at how languages form different types of questions and how they form commands. 2.1.8 Chapter 9: language structure in context In the final chapter, we broaden the scope of our study to look at language in context, in the context of how we think and process, the context of the culture in which it is spoken, and the context of what we know about languages in general.\n\n2 The structure of language – a preview\n\nWe look at ways of categorizing languages based on certain features that they have or do not have and how this leads us to place them into ‘families’. We also take a look at some examples of influences between the structure of a language and the culture in which it is spoken. Finally we touch on aspects of language change, both processes internal to language and those prompted by contact with other languages.\n\n7\n\n2\n\nThe structure of words\n\nKEY TOPICS r\n\nr\n\nParts of words Analysing morphology Derivation and inflection Non-linear morphology Clitics\n\n1\n\nWhat is a word?\n\nr r r\n\nIn this chapter we will look at the parts that words are made from: morphemes. We will learn to recognize them and will introduce some terms to describe them. In this section we discuss what we mean by a word, and how we might find words. As members of a literate language community, we might think that defining a word is easy, but when we speak, of course, we do not mark word breaks. In a language that we do not know, we need a strategy for locating the boundaries between words. In general terms, when we talk about a word we mean a separate, independent phonological unit.1 However, when we talk we run our words together and, despite what written conventions suggest, there usually are not audible pauses between our words. So how can we determine where words begin and end? One feature of words is that they can be said on their own, in isolation. A speaker of English would be happy to pronounce the sequence /hapi/ happy on its own and call it a word, but would almost certainly not feel the same about /v/ ve or /ə/ (as in could’ve or coulda). Secondly, when we do pause during natural speech, that pause always occurs between words, not in the middle of phonological words, as illustrated in (1). (1) (a) (b)\n\nYou’re just being . . . um . . . pedantic. ??You’re just be . . . um . . . ing pedantic.\n\nThirdly, phonological words have to consist of at least one syllable each, so when you learn the permissible syllable structures in a language, you can 8\n\n2 Parts of words\n\ndetermine where those boundaries lie. There will also be other phonological rules that only apply within words, so examining where they occur in sequences of sounds can help to determine where word boundaries are. In this book I focus on morphology and syntax but, as you can see, phonology and morphology are not separate, mutually exclusive areas of study. There is a great deal of overlap, just as morphology also overlaps with syntax, and the more study we can do in all these areas, the more thorough our analysis will be.\n\n2\n\nParts of words\n\n2.1\n\nMorphemes 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nFill in the gaps in the sentences in (2) and (3). Use the correct form of the underlined word in the (a) examples. (2) (a) (b)\n\nHenry only has one bleek. Sally, on the other hand, has two\n\n(3) (a) (b)\n\nToday, Maria is happily pleeping. Yesterday, Maria happily\n\n. .\n\nWhat is a bleek? Is it better to have one or two? And what is pleeping? Is it legal? And, more importantly here, how do you know how the word should look in the gaps? By changing the form of the word you are using your knowledge of English morphology. As a proficient speaker of English you know how the word needs to change to fit both its place in the sentence and its meaning; you know which parts of the word to chop off and which to add. You probably had bleeks in (2b) and pleeped in (3b). You knew that bleek was a noun and needed a plural -s and that pleep was a verb and probably needed -ed in the past tense.2 These smaller parts of words that we chop words into are called morphemes. Morphemes are defined as the minimal units of grammatical or lexical meaning in a sentence. Minimal does not necessarily mean small; it means that the unit cannot be broken down further into meaningful pieces (in the sense described below). Many morphemes are small, but some can have several syllables, such as caterpillar. Meaningful: Morphemes give us grammatical or lexical information. They might, for example, tell us the name of a thing or action (lexical meaning). Alternatively, they might tell us how many of something there were or when something happened, like the s in bleeks or the ed in pleeped (grammatical meaning). In this chapter we will look at both these areas of morphology in more detail.\n\n9\n\n10\n\nthe structure of words\n\n2.2\n\nBasic types of morphemes 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nLook at the English words in (4), which have been cut up into morphemes. (4) (a) (b) (c)\n\nkicked kick -ed dogs dog -s unkindly un- kind -ly\n\nThe ‘core’ of the word, the morpheme with the main lexical meaning, is called the root. In each example above, the root of each word is underlined. Roots have a lexical meaning: we might expect to find these words (typically nouns, verbs and adjectives) by themselves in a dictionary. Lexical morphemes also form open sets, which means we expect to be able to invent new members, new items of this type.3 Finally, roots are usually free morphemes; they can occur by themselves, without other morphemes attached (but see the examples below in (7) and (8)). The other morphemes in (4), on the other hand, cannot occur on their own: they have to be attached, or ‘fixed’ to another morpheme. For this reason they are called affixes. An affix that occurs before the main lexical morpheme is a prefix while an affix that occurs after it is a suffix; we see both in example (4c). The hyphen occurs on the side of the morpheme where it is attached to the root, as we see in (5). Notice too that free morphemes, such as kind in (5), are written without hyphens. (5)\n\nunkind -ly prefix root suffix\n\nMorphemes such as affixes that cannot stand on their own are bound morphemes. Affixes are also examples of grammatical morphemes: rather than naming a thing or an action, grammatical morphemes may provide information about features like the time an event occurred (-ed) or number (-s) or they might change the meaning of a word (un-). Grammatical morphemes form closed sets: it is very rare that languages invent new ways of marking the past tense or plurals or other grammatical meanings. All these distinctions are illustrated with the English example in (6). (6)\n\nplayed consists of play + -ed root affix (suffix) lexical grammatical free bound open set closed set\n\nThis may seem like a lot of labels for a small thing, but they are all useful at different times. It is important to note that not all roots are free. Even in English, some roots cannot appear in isolation: one can be unkempt but can one be kempt? Other\n\n2 Parts of words\n\nEnglish bound roots include bapt (baptize, baptism) mit (submit, commit, admit) and ceive (deceive, receive, conceive, etc.), none of which can appear without additional morphemes added. In some languages, such as Kwaza (unclassified, Brazil), all verb roots are bound morphemes. These verb roots are lexical but they cannot stand without inflectional affixes, as independent words: they are illustrated in (7) and (8) with the Kwaza verb roots wady- ‘give’ and w˜a\"w˜y‘sleep’ (van der Voort 2004: 246, 253). An asterisk ‘∗’ indicates that the word is impossible. You will also see an asterisk used to indicate that a sentence is ungrammatical. (See section 2.3 below for an explanation of the gloss line under the Kwaza data.) (7) (a) (b)\n\n∗\n\n(8) (a) (b)\n\n∗\n\nwady (give) wady-\"n˜a-hata-ki. ‘He/they is/are going to give (it) to you.’ give-fut-3sbj.2obj-decl\n\nw˜a\"w˜y (sleep) w˜a\"w˜y-Ø-ki. ‘He is/they are sleeping.’ sleep-3-decl\n\nOn the other hand, grammatical morphemes, which are often bound morphemes, may occur as free morphemes. In particular, prepositions (e.g. on, under, at, before, etc. in English) are a closed set of grammatical morphemes but they are free; they can (and do) stand alone as words. 2.3\n\nHow to present language data 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nThis seems like a good time to mention a few points about how data is presented. When we write out data from languages other than English, the meaning, or gloss, is written directly underneath each morpheme, with the left edges of each morpheme aligned. If a morpheme has a grammatical meaning we write an abbreviation of the gloss in small capitals. There is a list of the abbreviations used at the front of the book. If, on the other hand, the morpheme has lexical meaning, we write it in lower case letters. We may have to space the words out to fit the glosses in. You can use the tab key or insert a table to widen the gap between words. Finally, the free translation is written underneath the gloss. These conventions are illustrated by the Tongan example in (9) (Oceanic, Tonga; Hopper and Thompson 1980: 257).4 (9)\n\nNa’e kai ‘e Sione ‘a e ika. pst eat sbj John obj det fish ‘John ate the fish.’\n\nIn the examples in (4), the main lexical morpheme stands alone, while the grammatical morphemes that have been added on are marked with ‘-’ (a hyphen) before or afterwards, depending on whether they are attached to the beginning or end of the lexical morpheme. If a morpheme carries more than one meaning (or\n\n11\n\n12\n\nthe structure of words\n\nthe meaning is glossed by more than one word) those meanings are separated by a full stop ‘.’. This convention is illustrated in (10) with examples from Gawri (Indo-Aryan, Pakistan), where the suffix -an carries both the imperfective aspect (see chapter 3) and indicates that the person shaking is masculine and singular (Baart 1999: 95). (10) (a)\n\n(b)\n\n¨am¯al k¨am-an-t. Jamal shake-ipfv.m.sg-prs ‘Jamal is shaking.’ ¨am¯al k¨am -an -t. Jamal shake -ipfv.m.sg -prs ‘Jamal is shaking.’\n\nSometimes the morphemes of a word are not separated out in order that the word breaks are clear, as in (10a). Elsewhere in the literature you may find that the morphemes in a word are spaced apart and each morpheme gloss is aligned under the morpheme itself, as shown in (10b).5 In this book I will use each of these methods at different times.\n\nSection summary 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nIn this section you have learned: r\n\nr\n\nto describe a morpheme, to understand the basic terms for describing morphemes, to present language data. key terms: morpheme, lexical/grammatical, open/closed set, affix, prefix/suffix, root, free/bound, gloss exercise: A1, A2\n\n3\n\nHow to find morphemes\n\nr r r\n\nWe have seen that we can use our intuition to cut up nonsense English words into morphemes, making breaks where we think the morphemes begin and end. However, in identifying morphemes in a new language we need a systematic way of dealing with language data. Each decision we make about the identity of a morpheme is a best guess, or hypothesis, about the language. We want to make sure our hypotheses are tested and produce consistent results, and to be prepared to adjust them as new information comes along. In this section we will look at some helpful and practical steps that we will be able to apply in general to all our linguistic analyses.6\n\n3 How to find morphemes\n\n3.1\n\nIdentifying morphemes 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nHere is a simple six-step method for identifying morphemes in a set of data, and below we will go through an example. It assumes we have before us a list of forms to be analysed that share some similarities in meaning and form. 1. 2. 3. 4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\nNumber the data items. Look for similar forms in the data which have some part of their meaning in common. Mark off what is similar, using different colours perhaps, different styles of underlining, or drawing vertical lines to divide the words. Start to make a list or table that includes columns for the item, the gloss, the word or morpheme type and the data number(s) where it occurs. Group together forms that have similar meanings or morpheme types. Good organization of data is half the battle in doing linguistic analysis. In the data, mark all the other occurrences of the identified morpheme and also that part of the total meaning to which it corresponds. (The second part of this step might be tricky if there isn’t a one-to-one correspondence between the data and the translation.) Repeat steps (2–5) until nothing is left unmarked in the data.\n\nLet us look at an example of this procedure. We will use a data set from Kham (Tibeto-Burman, Nepal) given in (11) (Watters 2002). (11) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i)\n\numi:rə umi: mi:rə nəha:rə NaNəihrə yahmrə Nazihm nəzihm uzihm\n\n‘his eyes’ ‘his eye’ ‘(the) eyes’ ‘your(sg) teeth’ ‘my heads’ ‘(the) doors’ ‘my house’ ‘your(sg) house’ ‘his house’\n\nThe data items are already itemized (step 1). Steps 2 and 3 ask us to look for similar forms with similar meanings and to mark these. It is important at this stage to look at all the data so that we can ‘chop’ the words into morphemes in the right places. Starting with (a), (b) and (c) we can see that they all include the meaning ‘eye’ and share the form mi: somewhere in the word. We can mark this in the data (step 3) wherever we see the form mi: and the meaning ‘eye’ (step 5). We will separate the form from the rest of the word with hyphens and assume that this lexical meaning forms the root to which the other elements attach. We will also begin our table as Table 2.1 (step 4).\n\n13\n\n14\n\nthe structure of words\n\nTable 2.1 Kham data, version 1 Form\n\nGloss\n\nWord type\n\nExamples\n\nmi:\n\n‘eye’\n\nnoun\n\n(a), (b), (c)\n\nTable 2.2 Kham data, version 2\n\n(12) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i)\n\nForm\n\nGloss\n\nWord type\n\nExamples\n\nmi: u-\n\n‘eye’ ‘his’\n\nnoun noun prefix\n\n(a), (b), (c) (a), (b), (i)\n\nu-mi:-rə u-mi: mi:-rə nəha:rə NaNəihrə yahmrə Nazihm nəzihm uzihm\n\n‘his eyes’ ‘his eye’ ‘(the) eyes’ ‘your(sg) teeth’ ‘my heads’ ‘(the) doors’ ‘my house’ ‘your(sg) house’ ‘his house’\n\nLooking again at (a) and (b), we can see that, as well as ‘eye’, these data also share the meaning ‘his’ and share the additional form u at the beginning of the word, which appears to be a prefix. We will mark this form in (a) and (b) and also in (i) where we see the same form and meaning pair, using double underlining to distinguish it from mi:. We will also add it to the table, being careful to include a hyphen after u- to show it is a prefix.

The form u- ‘his’ has a (third person singular) possessive meaning. We have other possessive meanings in the data so we can hypothesize that these forms also occur as prefixes. We will keep this in mind, but for the moment we cannot say where the prefixes end and the roots begin. In the meantime, let us turn back to (a) and (c) one more time. The remaining part of (a) and (c) that is unmarked is -rə and the remaining part of the meaning that is shared is the plural. So we will hypothesize that -rə is a\n\n3 How to find morphemes\n\nTable 2.3 Kham data, version 3 Form\n\nGloss\n\nWord type\n\nExamples\n\nmi: -rə u-\n\n‘eye’ plural ‘his’\n\nnoun noun suffix noun prefix\n\n(a), (b), (c) (a), (c), (d), (e), (f) (a), (b), (i)\n\nTable 2.4 Kham data, version 4 Form\n\nGloss\n\nWord type\n\nExamples\n\nmi:\n\n‘eye’\n\nnoun\n\n(a), (b), (c)\n\n-rə u-\n\nplural ‘his’\n\nnoun suffix noun prefix\n\n(a), (c), (d), (e), (f) (a), (b), (i)\n\nsuffix that carries a plural meaning. Looking at the rest of the data, our hypothesis is supported by the fact that (d), (e) and (f) have the form -rə and are also plural. We will mark it with bold underlining.

Complete the row in Table 2.4 for that information; notice that we are starting to group together similar morphemes in the table. We will mark it the same way as ‘eye’ in the data since it is also a root.

We can see ‘my’ in (g) and ‘your(sg)’ in (h).

(17) (a) (b) (c) (d)\n\nu-mi:-rə u-mi: mi:-rə nə-ha:-rə\n\n‘his eyes’ ‘his eye’ ‘(the) eyes’ ‘your(sg) teeth(pl)’\n\n3 How to find morphemes\n\n(e) (f) (g) (h) (i)\n\nNa-Nəih-rə yahm-rə Na-zihm nə-zihm u-zihm\n\n‘my heads’ ‘(the) doors’ ‘my house’ ‘your(sg) house’ ‘his house’\n\nAt this point all the Kham data is marked and accounted for. Notice that there is an unmarked ‘(the)’ in the translation of (c) and (f). This part of the meaning is implied by the forms but it is not morphologically marked in Kham. It is important to remember to focus on, and account for, the language data, not on the English translation (although that can help, of course). 3.2\n\nIdentifying the order of morphemes 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nIn most cases, affixes have a fixed order relative to the root. Another useful outcome of a morphological analysis is that we can start to see the order of the affixes emerge. In our Kham data we dealt with one prefix set and one suffix set. However, when roots can have more than one prefix or suffix we need a way of determining the order of those affixes relative to the root. In order to provide an example we will look at a new set of data from Hungarian (Uralic, Hungary) given in (18) (Spencer 1991: 58). The morpheme breakdown has been provided, so we can focus on the ordering of the morphemes. (18) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j) (k) (l)\n\nf¨urd´o f¨urd´o-k f¨urd´o-k-ben f¨urd´o-ben f¨urd´o-m f¨urd´o-i-m f¨urd´o-nk f¨urd´o-i-nk f¨urd´o-i-nk-ben f¨urd´o-d szob´a-k szob´a-i-m\n\n‘bath’ ‘baths’ ‘in baths’ ‘in (a) bath’ ‘my bath’ ‘my baths’ ‘our bath’ ‘our baths’ ‘in our baths’ ‘your(sg) bath’ ‘rooms’ ‘my rooms’\n\nWe can represent what we find in a position class chart. We need to start with the longest words we have – the one with the most affixes – to determine affix ordering relative to the root so we will put (18i) into Table 2.7 first and label the columns according to the meaning of each suffix. Table 2.7 Hungarian position class chart, version 1 root (i) f¨urd´o\n\n(-plural)\n\n(-possessive)\n\n(-location)\n\n-i\n\n-nk\n\n-ben\n\n17\n\n18\n\nthe structure of words\n\nTable 2.8 Hungarian position class chart, final version\n\n(i) (c) (f) (h) (l) (b) (d) (e) (g) (j) (k)\n\nroot\n\n(-plural)\n\n(-possessive)\n\n(-location)\n\nf¨urd´o f¨urd´o f¨urd´o f¨urd´o szob´a f¨urd´o f¨urd´o f¨urd´o f¨urd´o f¨urd´o szob´a\n\n-i -k -i -i -i -k\n\n-nk (1pl)\n\n-ben -ben\n\n-m (1sg) -nk -m -ben -m -nk -d (2sg)\n\n-k\n\nThe brackets show that, as far as we can tell from the data, all the suffixes are optional. We will assume at first that all affixes with similar meanings occur in the same position; in other words, we do not expect them to co-occur (∗ my your canoe). It is a fair assumption to make, but it is an assumption and so would have to be checked. We can now add in the four words that have two suffixes, and then those with one. Once we add in the other data, from the longest words to the shortest, we have the complete picture, as shown in Table 2.8. There appear to be two forms of the plural suffix, -i and -k, the latter appearing in possessive noun phrases. We would need more data to examine this further. Not only do these two steps give us an understanding of the data we have, but we can use them in analysing further data (amending our hypotheses again if need be), and we can make educated guesses about how other words are structured which can help us in learning the language.7 For example, what would you hypothesize to be the Hungarian translation for the noun phrases in (19)? (19) (a) (b) (c)\n\nin my baths your room our rooms\n\nOf course, this is a simple set of data with clear-cut boundaries between the morphemes, all of which carry only one meaning. It would not be fair to pretend that it is always this easy to analyse morphology. There are a number of complications when identifying morphemes that we should be aware of. Some of these are explained in the following sections.\n\n4 The function of added morphemes\n\n19\n\nSection summary 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nIn this section you have learned: r\n\nr\n\ntechniques for identifying and describing morphemes, a procedure for identifying the order of affixes. key terms: morpheme break, position class chart exercises: B1, B2, B3\n\n4\n\nThe function of added morphemes\n\nr r\n\nWe have learned how to analyse words into morphemes and how to describe those morphemes. In this section we will look more closely at the different functions or purposes the added morphemes can have. Firstly, take a look at the data in (20) and (21). (20) (a) (b)\n\nwalk + -s walk + -ed\n\n(21) (a) (b)\n\nwalk-er noun He doesn’t cycle, he’s a walker. un-walk-able adjective This path is too steep; it’s totally unwalkable.\n\nverb verb\n\nHe walks to work on Wednesdays. He walked to work last Wednesday.\n\nThrough looking at both the form of the words and their meanings, we can say that all the words in (20) and (21) are ‘related’ to each other and all based on the root walk. However, the affixes in (20) do a different Describe the difference between kind of job from those in (21). the function of the Essentially, the morphemes in (20) add grammatical information affixes in (20) and (in this case, tense and an indication of the person who performed those in (21). the action) required by their context, and are called inflectional morphemes. In other words, in (20a), we want to communicate that the event currently happens on a regular basis and that the lone walker is third person; that is, not me (first person) or you (second person), but somebody else. All this information is carried by the inflectional suffix -s. The affixes in (21), on the other hand, change the word ‘walk’ into a new word. These are called derivational morphemes, because a new word is ‘derived’ that we would expect to have its own entry in a dictionary. The derived word may also be of a different word type. So, while walk is a verb, walker is a noun and unwalkable is an adjective, and all three are different words with different meanings, thanks to the derivational affixes added to the root walk. To take an analogy, imagine a small engine. That is our ‘root’. If you attach that engine to two wheels, you ‘derive’ a motorbike. If you attach it to four wheels, you ‘derive’ a car. You can ‘derive’ two different vehicles that are nonetheless both engine driven. On the other hand, depending on the terrain over which you drive your vehicle, you may be required to add chains to the tyres for snow, fog\n\n20\n\nthe structure of words\n\nTable 2.9 Yatˆe personal prefix paradigm 1st person sg 2nd person sg 3rd person sg 1st person pl 2nd person pl 3rd person pl\n\ni-tfe a-tfe e-tfe ja-tfe wa-tfe th a-tfe\n\n‘my father’ ‘your(sg) father’ ‘her/his father’ ‘our father’ ‘your(pl) father’ ‘their father’\n\nlights for bad weather, or mud flaps for mud – these ‘inflectional’ variations are determined by the driving context. 4.1\n\nInflection 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nForms created by adding inflectional affixes have the same basic meaning as the bare root. It is commonly nouns and verbs that take inflectional affixes, most often to show who did what, and when. Verbs may take affixes that show agreement with the person, number and gender of the ‘who’ (the participant(s) in the event), and others that pin down the ‘when’. Nouns can also carry inflectional affixes which mark whether the referent depicted by the noun is doing the action, undergoing the action or performing some other role (such as instrument), as well as other affixes that mark the number, gender or class of the noun’s referent.8 In the example from Russian (Slavic, Russia) in (22), the nouns are marked with an inflectional suffix that indicates the grammatical gender (f), number (sg) and role (sbj, obj) of the noun. The verb is marked with perfective aspect and past tense, as well as with an additional suffix indicating feminine and singular, in agreement with the subject, the doer of the action. (22)\n\nUˇcitel’nic-a pro-ˇcita-l-a knig-u. teacher-f.sg.sbj pfv-read-pst-f.sg book-f.sg.obj ‘The teacher read the book.’\n\nInflectional affixes often occur in organized sets or paradigms. In Table 2.9 we see an example of an inflectional paradigm from Yatˆe (Amazonian, Brazil) showing possessive prefixes that vary in person and number attached to the root tfe ‘father’ (Rodrigues 1999: 182). When we have paradigms of affixes with similar meanings or functions, we expect that only one from each set can appear on a particular word in that particular affix slot. For example, if something is marked as possessed by me, it cannot also be separately marked as possessed by you (∗ my your father). Note too that, for various reasons, you might come across incomplete (or defective) inflectional paradigms where some cells in the table are left unfilled. For example, the English verbs hit and put do not get marked with past tense morphology (∗ hitted, ∗ putted). In Halkomelem (Salishan, Canada), intransitive\n\n4 The function of added morphemes\n\n21\n\nTable 2.10 Halkomelem person particles with intransitive predicates\n\n1st 2nd 3rd\n\nsingular\n\nplural\n\ncən cˇ xw\n\nct ce.p\n\npredicates occur with first and second person particles but third person is not marked, leading to an incomplete paradigm (Suttles 2004: 322).9 In addition, inflectional morphemes tend to be more productive than derivational morphemes, meaning that they apply to a large portion of the words in the appropriate word category. For example, virtually every countable noun in English can be marked for plural with a form of the morpheme -s. Derivational morphemes tend to have more restrictions on the types of stems and roots they affix to. Inflectional affixes are obligatory in certain syntactic contexts while derivational affixes are not. We can see this illustrated in the English examples in (23a) and (b) which show noun and verb inflection respectively. In these two sentences, the word has to be in the right form to fit with the other items in the sentence otherwise the sentence is ungrammatical. (23) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)\n\nTwo of the ∗ dog/dogs ran off. Mavis ∗ grow/grows sunflowers in her bathroom. ∗ Three of her child have blue eye. ∗ Yesterday, Joe kick both of his cat. Boris likes/dislikes wine.\n\nLooking at (23e), on the other hand, we can see that the derivational morpheme dis is optional in the sense that with or without the derivational morpheme, the sentence is grammatical. Of course, the derived form still has to be the right word type for its function in the sentence for this to work; if you turn a verb into a noun you cannot use it as a verb anymore. 4.2\n\nAdd the inflectional morphemes missing from (23c) and (d) that are required to make the sentences grammatical.\n\nDerivation 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nIn the examples in (21) we saw that the addition of certain affixes may change the word type. We would expect each of the words in (21) to have their own entry in a dictionary, while those in (20) are just different forms of the verb walk. Therefore, derivational morphology is lexical because it changes one ‘lexical entry’ into another, changing its meaning, and often (but not always) changing its word category. In (24), we have further examples from English of derivational morphology at work.\n\n22\n\nthe structure of words\n\n(24) (a)\n\nwalk + -er = walker verb noun -en changes an adjective into a verb: soft + -en = soften adjective verb -ive changes a verb into an adjective: impress + -ive = impressive verb adjective un- adds a negative meaning: un- + impressive = unimpressive adjective adjective -ly changes an adjective into an adverb: unimpressive + -ly = unimpressively\n\n(b) (c) (d) (e)\n\n-er changes a verb into a noun:\n\nIn Dagbani (Atlantic-Congo, Ghana), the derivational suffix -lana attaches to nouns and some adjectives to form nouns, as illustrated in (25): in (b), for example, it is suffixed to the noun fara ‘poverty’ to form faralana ‘pauper, poor person’ (Olawsky 2004: 140).10 (25) (a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\ngbaN + -lana = gbaNlana skin -owner ‘eldest son’ noun noun fara + -lana = faralana poverty -owner ‘poor person’ noun noun baalim + -lana = baalimlana slow -owner ‘slow person’ adjective noun\n\nA final difference between derivational and inflectional morphemes is that while derivational morphemes almost always do only one job, inflectional morphemes may do more than one job; for example, the English inflectional verb suffix -s marks both third person and singular. 4.2.1 Roots and stems Separate the words in (26) into morphemes (remembering to put hyphens on the affixes). See if you can determine which of the affixes are derivational and which are inflectional, and take note of the position of the types of affix in relation to the root. (26) (a) (b) (c)\n\nwalkers untied (he) underpays\n\nWe can see that in English some derivational affixes are prefixes and some are suffixes, while all the inflectional affixes are suffixes. This is a feature of English that we may or may not find in other languages. We generally expect affixes to have a fixed order in relation to each other and the root. In addition, you may have spotted that the derivational affixes appear closer to the root than inflectional affixes. This is an order we expect to find in all languages, because it is an iconic (visual) reflection of the fact that derivational affixes change the basic meaning of the word while inflectional affixes merely\n\n4 The function of added morphemes\n\nadd grammatical information. We see the same ordering of derivational and inflectional morphemes in the Turkish (Turkic, Turkey) data in (27) (G¨oksel and Kerslake 2005: 47). The third line shows that the derivational suffixes appear closer to the root than inflectional suffixes, which in turn appear closer to the root than clitics (see section 6). (27) (a)\n\n(b)\n\nsuc¸-lu-luk-la=mı crime-der-der-ins=int root-der-der-infl=cl ‘in a guilty manner?’ yap-ı-las¸-tır-ıl-ma-mıs¸ build-der-der-caus-pass-neg-evid/pfv root-der-der-infl -infl -infl-infl ‘has not been built up’\n\nIn the sections above, I described the root of a word as its ‘core’, the morpheme with the central lexical meaning. In (20) and (21), the root is walk. The root is always a single morpheme, and remember that it may or may not be a free morpheme (see example (7)). A stem, on the other hand, consists of a root plus any derivational morphemes. In other words, the stem is the form of the word before any inflectional affixes are added. In a word that contains both inflectional and derivational affixes, the root, the stem and the word will be three different things, as in (28a). In a word with no affixes, all three will be the same, as shown in (28b). In (28c), example (27a) from Turkish is repeated to illustrate the process in another language.

We will take an example of a complex English word – international – and break it down into its root and derivational affixes in (29).\n\n23\n\n24\n\nthe structure of words\n\nTable 2.11 Derivational affix examples\n\nAffix\n\nRoot or stem category\n\nResulting word category\n\n-er -en\n\nverb adjective\n\nnoun verb\n\nMeaning or function\n\nExample\n\none who does X to make something have the quality described by the root adjective\n\nwalk-er soft-en\n\nTable 2.12 Summary of differences between inflection and derivation Property of morpheme\n\nInflection\n\nDerivation\n\nChanges a word into a new word Changes the word type (e.g. verb to noun) Can be organized into paradigms Determined by syntax (obligatory) Meaning of the whole is predictable from the parts Closeness of the added element to the root morpheme Type of meaning Productive (applies to all roots of that type)\n\nno no yes yes usually yes farther grammatical very\n\nyes often no no often not12 nearer lexical not very\n\n(29)\n\ninternational nation + -al = national (∗ internation) + inter- = inter-national root stem word noun adjective adjective\n\nLooking at the word international we can see that the -al suffix is added first to create an adjective. We know this because ∗ internation is not a word. After -al, the prefix inter- is added to create international. We saw another example of this in (24c–e) above with the formation of the word unimpressively. Notice that the derivational suffixes -ive and -ly are positioned according to the order in which they are attached (∗ unimpresslyive). 4.2.3 Analysing and listing Since derivational affixes often change the word type of a word as well as its meaning it is helpful to show the effect of using a derivational affix in a table (Table 2.11). In the empty rows, add entries for the derivational affixes illustrated in (29). 4.3\n\nSummary of derivation and inflection 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nTable 2.12 presents a summary of the main differences between derivational and inflectional affixes.

Each morpheme tagged onto either the beginning or end of a root or stem. However, there are quite a few other morphological processes that are not quite as clear cut. We will take a look at some of these non-linear morphological processes in this section.13 5.1\n\nCircumfixes and infixes 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nSo far we have only looked at prefixes and suffixes. These are by far the most common types of affixes but these are not the only morphological fruit. Take a look at the data in (30) from Georgian (Kartvelian, Georgia) and at how nouns on the right are derived from those on the left (Boeder 2005: 43). (30) (a) (b)\n\npul ‘money’ sapule ‘purse’ satvale ‘spectacles’ tval ‘eye’\n\n(31) (a) (b)\n\ncol ‘wife’ nacolar ‘former wife’ sopel ‘village’ nasoplar ‘site of a former village’\n\nIn order to form the words on the right circumfixes are used. A circumfix is an affix with two parts that adds an element to both the beginning and the end of the root. It ‘hugs’ the stem, if you will. Describe the effect on the meaning of The opposites of circumfixes, in a sense, are infixes, which are the words caused inserted into the middle of a root. We can do this with expletives by the addition of in English in phrases such as abso-bloody-lutely. In Mori Bawah sa e and na ar. (Malayo-Polynesian, Indonesia) the infix -in- indicates the passive voice as illustrated in the contrast between the verb forms in (32a) pepate and (b) pinepate (Mead 2005: 698).\n\n26\n\nthe structure of words\n\n(32) (a)\n\n. . . ka=i pepate=’ira ana-no. . . . and=3sg.nom kill=3pl.abs child-3sg.poss ‘ . . . and she killed her children.’ Ta p⬍in⬎epate. 3sg.fut ⬍pass⬎kill ‘He will/shall/must be killed.’\n\n(b)\n\nIn Semelai (Mon-Khmer, Malaysia) the affix raʔ produces a comparative adjective of dimension, turning ‘be thin’ into ‘be thinner’ in (33a), for example.

In (34), on the other hand, the roots have two syllables. The affix raʔ is realized as an infix, appearing between the two syllables of the root (Kruspe 2004: 69). Examples (32b) and (34b) show how infixes are indicated in the text and gloss, between angled brackets ‘⬍ ⬎’. In the examples from Georgian in (30) and (31) the circumfix is derivational and in that case we would not generally gloss the circumfix morpheme. However, when circumfixes (or any two-part affixes) are inflectional, one way we can write the glosses is as illustrated in (35), putting the meaning twice under each part of the morpheme.

We will examine that phenomenon in this section. In English there are several ways to signal plural and /-s/ is the most common, as illustrated in (36b). However, with a few words there is no audible distinction between singular and plural: the pronunciation is identical for both forms, as for sheep in (37b). (36) (a) (b)\n\ngoat goat + -s = plural\n\nThere was one goat in the field. There were twenty goats in the field.\n\n(37) (a) (b)\n\nsheep There was one sheep in the field. sheep + -Ø = plural There were twenty sheep in the field.\n\nOn the one hand, we have a regular pattern for most nouns in English where /-s/ (or some other less common form such as -en) is added as a suffix to a noun to mark the plural. On the other hand, we have exceptions to this pattern like sheep.\n\n5 Morphological processes\n\nBecause we usually do have an audible plural morpheme, the form in (37b) is an exception and it is labelled a null (or zero) morpheme. We only use these terms where there is clear evidence that other words have a regular morpheme and that there is a gap in the distribution of that morpheme. The form of the plural morpheme with sheep is described as -Ø ‘plural’ (where ‘Ø’ means null); both -Ø and /-s/ are variants, allomorphs, of the plural morpheme. If a meaning is consistently conveyed without the addition of a morpheme, we say it is unmarked, but we only use this term when the lack of morpheme is the rule rather than the exception. For example, in the simple present tense in English, only the third person singular is marked on the verb (regardless of which verb it is), as we can see in (38). (38) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f)\n\nI walk You walk He walk-s We walk You walk They walk\n\nI lie You lie He lie-s We lie You lie They lie\n\nI wobble You wobble He wobble-s We wobble You wobble They wobble\n\nAs the data show, the lack of marking is a consistent pattern, so we would say that all the other persons are unmarked. 5.2.1 Conversion or zero derivation Derivational change can also occur without the adding of morphemes. An example of this from English is the word fish, shown in (39a). This word is a noun but it can also be used as a verb meaning ‘to catch fish’ without any derivational morpheme added. Another example is the word break which is a verb describing the action of damaging or destroying something (39b). From this we derive the noun break, again without adding any extra morphology. (39) (a) (b)\n\nfish → fish noun verb break → break verb noun\n\nThis type of derivation is called zero derivation (or conversion). In (40) we have further examples from Mualang (Malayo-Polynesian, Indonesia) that show zero derivation from a noun to a verb stem without the addition of any morphemes (Tjia 2007: 138–9).

In the set of English words in (41), for example, the difference between the word types is marked by a change in voicing. (41) (a) (b) (c) (d)\n\nverb use [z] house [z] prove [v] breathe [ð]\n\nnoun use [s] house [s] proof [f] breath [␪]\n\n5.3.2 Change in the vowel system In Semitic languages (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic), a lot of both inflectional and derivational information is conveyed through changes in the vowels of the root. In fact, the roots are generally considered to consist of just the consonants and the appropriate vowels are added for the meaning required. In the Hebrew (Semitic, Israel) examples in (42), the connection between the words is the set of consonants g-d-l and meanings to do with the concept ‘grow’ (Shimron 2006: 10, 12). (42) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g)\n\ng´odel gdula gadlut migdal gadal gidel gidul\n\n‘size’ ‘greatness’ ‘grandeur’ ‘tower’ ‘to grow’ (with one argument, e.g The tree is growing) ‘to grow, raise’ (with two arguments, e.g. We are raising a genius) ‘growth, tumour’\n\nThe variations in meaning are conveyed through changes in the vowel patterns that accompany the consonants g-d-l (as well as a few extra affixes).14 Sign languages also frequently use what are known as base sequences which can be varied in different ways to convey meaning distinctions. For example, in American Sign Language, we see the patterns given in (43), based on the meaning ‘sick’ (Sandler and Lillo-Martin 2006: 52–4). (43)\n\nsick L M L I I I x y z\n\nsick Intensive LL M LL V I V x y z\n\nsick Durational L M L (reduplicated) I I I x [arc] z\n\nThe basic template begins at a L(ocation) near the forehead, then a straight M(ovement) and at another (L)ocation in contact with the forehead. To get the intensive form, the hand is held in each location for a longer time (shown with a double ‘L’), and for the durational form an arc is added to the movement (instead of the straight movement) with the option of reduplication (repetition, see section 5.3.4).\n\n5 Morphological processes\n\n5.3.3 Suppletion – changing the root form Sometimes meanings are expressed through a complete change in the root form instead of an affix. This is called suppletion; a whole new form is ‘supplied’. In Georgian (Kartvelian, Georgia), suppletion occurs with some verbs depending on whether they have singular or plural arguments. In (44), for example, we see the verb root k’l when there is a singular victim, and the root form xoc when there is more than one victim (Boeder 2005: 29). (44) (a) (b)\n\nvk’lav. ‘I kill him/her/it.’ vxocav. ‘I kill them.’\n\nAn example of suppletion from English is the variation in tense forms of the verb to be, which changes its whole root form for each past tense form. Compare it in (45) with the regular verb wash which obediently adds the suffix -ed, as we see in (46). (45) (a) (b) (c)\n\nHe is a mess. He was (∗ is-ed) a mess. He has been (∗ is-ed) a mess.\n\n(46) (a) (b) (c)\n\nI wash regularly. I wash-ed my car yesterday. I have wash-ed my hands.\n\nThe forms in (45) are portmanteau morphemes, morphemes that have more than one function: here they represent the meaning of the root and also carry tense. The data in (45) are examples of ‘total’ suppletion, but ‘partial’ suppletion also exists, where only the main vowel is changed. English also uses this strategy: sing / sang / sung; drink / drank / drunk (a process somewhat similar to the change in vowels described in section 5.3.2). 5.3.4 Reduplication – repeating part of the root reduplication is a strategy whereby part of the root gets repeated (reduplicated). The amount of the root that gets reduplicated can vary. In Kuk´u (Eastern Sudanic, Sudan and Uganda), the first consonant and vowel of the root is reduplicated as part of the formation of past continuous and future tenses/aspects, as shown in (47b) and (c) (Cohen 2000: 76).15 (47) (a)\n\n(b)\n\nnˆ d´ε r. 1sg cook ‘I cooked / I cook.’ n´ d´ε -d´ε r-´a. 1sg red-cook-qual ‘I was cooking.’\n\n29\n\n30\n\nthe structure of words\n\n(c)\n\nn´ dε-d´ε r. 1sg red-cook ‘I will cook.’\n\nIn many cases, reduplication indicates either ongoing action, or repeated action (either repeated by one person, or one action by lots of people). On nouns and quantifiers it can also convey or emphasize plurality or intensity. These uses appear to be somewhat iconic, since their shape visually reflects their meaning; in this case, depicting an increase in frequency or intensity. The examples in (48) and (49) come from Mualang (Malayo-Polynesian, Indonesia) and illustrate just some of the uses of reduplication in that language.16 In (48b), the whole root is reduplicated; this sentence depicts one complex movement (Tjia 2007: 187).17 (48) (a)\n\n(b)\n\nKacung N-lumpat. frog atv-jump ‘The frog jumped (once).’ Kacung N-lumpat-lumpat. frog atv-jump-red ‘The frog jumped around (i.e. up and down aimlessly).’\n\nIn (49a), we see reduplication indicating duration of the action and in (b), plurality or the large size of the patient. In (49c), we see a reduplicated root used as a modifier of intensity. Finally, in (d) we see a reciprocal (‘each other’) meaning expressed and in this case the voice marker ba- occurs between the reduplicated forms (Tjia 2007: 190–1). (49) (a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nMiak ia’ ba-sabak-sabak. child that antip-cry-red ‘The child keeps crying.’ Babas da-tebas-tebas sampay luah. forest pass-cut-red until large ‘A wide area of forest is cleared (by cutting grass and bushes/trees).’ Am’i’ mimit-mimit! take little-red ‘Take little by little!’ Burung sawut-ba-sawut. birds reply-antip-red ‘Birds are replying to one another.’\n\nThe amount of the stem that is reduplicated may depend on its shape. In G`urd`ung (Chadic, Nigeria), monosyllabic stems are reduplicated in their entirety, as we see in the pairs of verbs in (50). (50) (a) (b) (c)\n\ngy u` ‘fill’ d`ı ‘step’ vw aa ‘pour’\n\ngy u` -gy u` ‘fill repeatedly’ d`ı-d`ı ‘step (on) repeatedly’ vw aa-vw aa ‘pour repeatedly’\n\n5 Morphological processes\n\n31\n\nStems with a C1 V1 C2 V2 pattern, on the other hand, involve a sequence of two processes: firstly the stems are partially reduplicated (specifically the C1 V1 C2 portion). Secondly, the second consonant of the reduplicated portion takes the same form as (assimilates to) the following consonant and long vowels are shortened. We see these processes illustrated in the examples in (51) (Haruna 2003: 80–1). (51) (a) (b) (c)\n\np`an`ı ‘take’ → (p`an-p`ani) → p`app`an`ı ‘take repeatedly’ n`aasi ‘ask’ → (n`aas-n`aasi) → n`ann`aasi ‘ask repeatedly’ limbi ‘sew’ → (lim-limbi) → lillimbi ‘sew repeatedly’\n\n5.4\n\nSuprasegmental variation 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nThe name may be intimidating, but suprasegmental variation simply refers to inflectional or derivational meaning changes carried out by changing some ‘higher level’ feature of the root, such as stress placement or in just one feature of the sound. This variation is called suprasegmental because it is above (‘supra-’) the level of the sounds themselves, only changing one feature.18 5.4.1 Change in stress pattern In the set of English data in (52), the placement of stress determines whether the word is a noun or verb (and also affects vowel qualities). Decide whether the (52) (a) (b) (c) (d)\n\nverb pro\"test con\"vict im\"port re\"bel\n\nnoun \"protest \"convict \"import \"rebel\n\ndifference illustrated in (52) is an inflectional or a derivational change.\n\n5.4.2 Change in tone Tone patterns can do the job of carrying meaning differences. In the examples in (53) from Ngiti (Central Sudanic, DR Congo), only the tone change indicates the difference between singular and plural pronouns (Kutsch Lojenga 1994: 115). In (53a) and (b), for example, the tones on both syllables go from mid to low tone (indicated with accents) to indicate plurality. (53) (a) (b) (c)\n\nma ‘I/me’ `m`a ‘we/us’ ny ‘you(sg)’ `ny` ‘you(pl)’ a` badhi ‘he/him/it’ ab´adh´ı ‘they/them’\n\n5.5\n\nAllomorphs: one morpheme with different phonological forms 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nMorphemes may have a variety of allomorphs: different forms depending on their phonological context. If you have studied phonology, you\n\n32\n\nthe structure of words\n\nwill recognize the parallel with allophones of a phoneme, which are also varieties of a sound, determined by phonetic context. Imagine your hand is an affix. If you pick up a large object your hand will adjust in shape to grip it; if you pick up a very small object your hand will be in a different shape entirely. It is still your hand and it is carrying out the same purpose, but the object to be picked up affects the hand shape. The same applies when sounds meet: they often adjust their ‘shape’, their voicing and place of articulation.19 In English, for example, the grammatical morpheme in- ‘not’ has different forms depending on the consonant of the stem it attaches to, as we can see in (54). In (54b), for example, the prefix is pronounced im, with a bilabial nasal, because it precedes a bilabial plosive /p/. (54) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f)\n\ninaccurate impervious indecisive illogical incoherent irreverent\n\nin + vowel im + p (both bilabial) in + t, d (both alveolar) il + l (both lateral) iN + k (both velar) ir + r (both alveolar approximants)\n\nFor the purposes of explaining morphology, we will usually choose a basic form as a representative of the morpheme. In this case, we would choose in- ‘not’ since it occurs before a vowel which is considered to be a neutral environment; it also occurs in the widest variety of environments. The other forms occur in environments which can be explained phonologically: in this case, they assimilate to the place of articulation of the following consonant. In the Basque (Isolate, Spain) examples in (55), we see the perfective participle form of the verbs, which end in either -tu or -du (Hualde and Ortiz de Urbina 2003: 196–7). (55) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)\n\ngeratu hartu sartu kendu saldu\n\n‘remain’ ‘take’ ‘enter’ ‘take away’ ‘sell’\n\nWhat we find is that the -du allomorph occurs after nasals and lateral (55d, e), and the -tu form occurs elsewhere (55a–c).\n\n5.6\n\nSame sequences with different meanings 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nThe list of English words in (56) all end in the sequence er. However, there are two issues to consider when we find similar sequences. The first is whether the sequence forms a morpheme or is part of a larger morpheme. The second is whether a morpheme that looks or sounds the same has the same meaning.\n\n5 Morphological processes\n\n(56) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h)\n\nbrother painter hammer fuller water toaster spider slaughter\n\nWhen we think about the meaning as well as the form we can see which have -er as a suffix, namely (56b) paint-er ‘someone who paints’, (56d) full-er ‘more full’ (comparative) and (56f) toast-er ‘thing that toasts’. We can also see that the meaning of that -er suffix is slightly different in all three cases. All the other words contain only one morpheme. Other derivational strategies 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\n5.7\n\nIn section 4.2 we saw how derivational affixes can be used to form new words. In this section we will look at a number of other strategies languages use to form new words. 5.7.1 Compounds: words with more than one root Examine the words in (57) and break them into morphemes. (57) (a) (b) (c) (d)\n\nteapot boyfriend headphones hotdog\n\nThese words all contain two lexical roots side by side, and are called compounds. It can be difficult to tell the difference between a compound and a phrase of two words, but there are a few tell-tale signs, all of which are evidence that the two roots together are being treated as one unit.20 (i)\n\nA compound word usually contains only one main stress, while in a phrase each word has its own stress.\n\nAs we see in (58), the compound words on the left contain only one stressed syllable, while the phrases on the right contain two, one on each word in the phrase. In these examples the accent mark ´ indicates stress. (58) (a) (b) (c)\n\n(ii)\n\ncompound word a´ pplesauce (US) l´ambchops (US) a bl´ackboard\n\nphrase a´ pple s´auce (UK) l´amb ch´ops (UK) bl´ack b´oard\n\nInflectional morphemes only occur on the final root in the compound, and in fact nothing can appear between the two roots.\n\n33\n\n34\n\nthe structure of words\n\nThe examples in (59) illustrate that the plural marker -s can only occur at the end of the whole compound noun, and that modifiers cannot occur between the two roots. (59) (a) (b)\n\n∗ ∗\n\ngirl-sfriend ∗ girlbestfriend girlfriend-s bab-iessitter ∗ babyfreesitters babysitter-s\n\nWe can also see this second characteristic in data from Mualang (MalayoPolynesian, Indonesia), where the compound meaning of a compound noun ‘longhouse’ is lost when the second root is modified (as in 60b) or when elements appear between the two roots (as in (60c); Tjia 2007: 92). (60) (a) (b) (c)\n\n(iii)\n\nrumah-panyay ‘(traditional) longhouse’ house-long rumah panyay-panyay ‘houses that on average are long’ rumah besar panyay ‘a long big house’\n\nThe roots in a compound might lose their original meaning, as in hotdog, or be extended to a more metaphorical sense.\n\nWe can see this third distinction illustrated by the data in (61–63) from Hup (Nadahup, Brazil).21 (61) (a) (b)\n\nt´oj mɔy ´ ‘house’ (nose hole/house) mɔm b’ɔk hic˘uʔ ‘pot lid’ (iron pot/cover)\n\n(62) (a) (b)\n\nb’ɔk m’´ac ‘pot clay, clay for making pots’ (pot/clay) j’ak j’ɔ´ y´ag ‘hammock made from buriti palm fibres’ (buriti palm flower/ hammock)\n\n(63) (a) (b)\n\nnɔ-c´ug ‘moustache/beard’ (mouth/hummingbird) p˘uh mɔyɔ´ ‘glass window’ (water foam/house opening)\n\nIn (61) and (62), we see a fairly direct relationship between the parts of the compound and its meaning: in (61) there is a relationship of (a) possessor/possessed and (b) part/whole. In (62) there is an object and its inherent or defining property. In (63), on the other hand, we see a more metaphorical connection between the meaning of the parts and the meaning of the whole (Epps 2007: 108). As all the examples in this section show, different word classes can combine into compounds. In these final compound examples in (64) from Leti (MalayoPolynesian, Indonesia), the root aana ‘child’ is added to another root to form the diminutive while a verb root lavna ‘become big’ is added to form the augmentative noun (which may indicate greater physical size, age or power) (van Engelenhoven 2004: 127). (64) (a) (b) (c)\n\np¨uata ‘woman’ is¨uo` na ‘witch’ p`oka ‘rifle’\n\np¨uat-aana ‘girl’ is¨uo` n-aana ‘tiny witch’ p`ok-aana ‘pistol’\n\np¨uat-lavna ‘mature woman’ is¨uo` l-lavna ‘supreme witch’ p`ok-lavna ‘cannon’\n\n5 Morphological processes\n\n(d) (e)\n\ntoonu ‘lake’ nusa ‘island’\n\ntoon¨u-aana ‘puddle’ nus-aana ‘islet’\n\ntoul-lavna ‘lake’ nus-lavna ‘major island’\n\nIn sign languages, communication takes place using several parameters simultaneously, including the hands, the face and the body position, and each of these elements can be adjusted to derive different aspects of meaning (Sandler and Lillo-Martin 2006: 61). For example, in Netherlands Sign Language, the mouthed word (or mouthing) brood ‘bread’, borrowed from spoken Dutch, can act as an independent morpheme in combination with the manual sign eten ‘to eat’ to form brood eten ‘to eat bread’ (Crasborn, van der Kooij, Waters, Woll and Mesch 2008: 48). 5.7.2 Clipping, acronyms, blends and back formation There are a number of other ways that language speakers form new words (neologisms), and I will describe some of them briefly here, using examples from French (Romance, France) and English. Examples (65a) and (66a) are from French, and the English translations also illustrate the same processes. (65) (a) (b) (c)\n\nLes publicit´es the advertisements weblog taxicab\n\n→ → → →\n\nLes pubs the ads / the adverts blog taxi or cab\n\nAll the examples in (65) illustrate clipping which, as the name suggests, involves chopping off part of the original word. Acronyms are formed when the initial letters of a series of words are used to form new word which is pronounced as a word (rather than a string of letter names). Examples are given in (66). In the example in (66a), an extra letter is taken from the beginning of the second morpheme in immunod´eficitaire and immunodeficiency. (66) (a) (b) (c)\n\nSyndrome Immunod´eficitaire Acquis Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome National American Space Agency Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\n\n→ → → →\n\nSIDA (pronounced /sida/) AIDS NASA laser\n\nIn (67) we have examples of blends in English, ‘blending’ elements from two words to create a new word. There is a current trend in entertainment journalism to create blends from the names of celebrity couples; perhaps you can think of some examples. (67) (a) (b)\n\nsmoke + fog → smog grape + apple → grapple (an apple with grape flavour injected)\n\nBack formations occur when speakers go ‘back’ and analyse where they think the morpheme breaks in a word are, a process commonly motivated by comparing it with similar words (a process of analogy). Then they form a new word based on that morpheme break that is actually incorrect for the word\n\n35\n\n36\n\nthe structure of words\n\nin question. We saw an example of this in (65b), where web+log has been reanalyzed as we+blog, leading to the related words blogger and blogging. As another example, consider the English word alcoholic, where the root alcohol plus the suffix -ic indicates someone addicted to alcohol. A process of reanalysis leads to new words such as workaholic or shopaholic, where the roots work and shop have been added to the perceived suffix -aholic. These do have a nicer ring to them than workic or shopic and perhaps retaining part of the root form alcohol strengthens the sense of addiction. Notice that there also appears to be a tendency to keep subsequent new words to the same syllable pattern (68d). (68) (a) (b) (c) (d)\n\nalcohol + -ic → alcoholic ‘someone addicted to alcohol’ reanalysis: alcohol-ic → alc-oholic back formation: work-aholic, shop-aholic ∗ chocolaholic, chocaholic\n\nFinally, it is worth adding that these processes above involve manipulating words that exist in the language. Speakers may also borrow words from other languages (like karaoke, fajita, caf´e into English) or use personal or brand names as the general name for a thing or action (like Braille, (to) google, Kleenex). Section summary 䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲䡲\n\nIn this section you have learned: r\n\nr\n\nto identify and label some more unusual types of morpheme, to recognize the main types of non-linear morphological processes. key terms: infix, circumfix, non-linear morphology, null morpheme, conversion, zero derivation, suppletion, portmanteau, reduplication, allomorph, compound, clipping, blend, acronym, back formation, analogy, reanalysis exercises: A5, A6, A7, B5, B6, B7, B8\n\n6\n\nClitics\n\nr r\n\nIn section 1, I outlined several properties of phonological words. In this section I will add the concept of syntactic words. We will see that there can be a grey area between an element that is a separate word and one that is an affix, and the distinction between phonological and syntactic words will come in handy to describe these ‘in between’ elements, or clitics. Clitics that occur before the root are proclitics and those that occur after the root are called enclitics. In this section, we will look at some features of clitics. We can see the difference between affixes and clitics by looking at the sound ‘s’ with the examples in (69) and (70).\n\n6 Clitics\n\n(69) (a) (b)\n\nthe alien’s tiny spaceship clitic ‘=s’ the alien that I trod on’s tiny spaceship / ∗ the alien’s I trod on tiny spaceship\n\n(70) (a) (b)\n\n∗\n\nthe aliens affix ‘-s’ the alien that I trod ons / the aliens that I trod on\n\nIn (69) we see the clitic =s. (Clitics are often indicated in data and glosses with an equals sign ‘=’.) We can see that it can attach to the main noun, as in (69a), but it can also attach to other elements in the noun phrase that happen to occur right before the possessed noun; a preposition, in the case of (69b). In this way it is syntactically free: it is not picky about the word class of the word it attaches to. This behaviour contrasts with the plural suffix in (70), which only attaches to nouns, as (70b) shows. On the other hand, the form of the clitic does still vary according to the features of the word it attaches to, as illustrated for the plural /s/ in (71). In that sense it is phonologically bound. So we can see that the term free can have two senses. (71) (a) (b) (c)\n\nthe alien’s spaceship [z] [s] the book’s cover the witch’s hat [z]\n\nIn addition, because they are more loosely connected, clitics will appear further from the root or word they are attaching to than affixes. For example, if we have possession and plural in the same noun phrase the pattern shown in (72) emerges. This pattern is blurred somewhat by English spelling conventions, so an example with a different plural morpheme form is included too, in (72b).22 (72) (a) (b)\n\nthe aliens’ spaceship (∗ the alien’ss spaceship) the children’s toys (∗ the child’sren toys)\n\nOther examples of clitics in English include those in (73) and (74). Note that the (i)s and (woul)d can appear either in ‘contracted’ clitic form, as phonologically bound to the preceding word, or as separate (free) words. Hence they appear to be in between independent words and affixes, and in these cases variant forms of free words (as the alternative sentences show). (73) (a) (b) (74) (a) (b)\n\nHe’s quite the surfer. / He is quite the surfer. I’d be careful with that if I were you. / I would be careful with that if I were you. I could’ve warned them. Could’ve I warned them? / Could I have warned them?\n\n∗\n\nIn (74b) we see an illustration of the syntactic freedom of the clitic ’ve: when the element it attaches to appears at the front of the clause, the clitic does not also appear there; it needs to stay in its own syntactic position in the sentence. In other words, it is not syntactically bound as a unit with its host. Compare this\n\n37\n\n38\n\nthe structure of words\n\nTable 2.13 Summary of differences between affixes and clitics Property\n\nAffix\n\nClitic\n\nPhonologically free Syntactically free – can appear with different types of words – does not form syntactic unit with word Appears closer to root Variant forms of free words Written as separate words\n\nno no\n\nno yes\n\nyes no no\n\nno sometimes sometimes\n\nbehaviour with the affix -s in (75) which appears attached to the root noun day wherever that noun appears.
