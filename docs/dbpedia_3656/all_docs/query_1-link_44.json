        "text": "For history enthusiasts, historical fiction serves as a cornerstone that vividly resurrects the ways of life from bygone eras. The genre, often characterized by its immersive storytelling and attention to detail, has produced some best-selling literary works that span decades. While this genre has historically been dismissed as trite, there is now a surge in its popularity, and whether their storylines explore the World War II era or other important historical epochs, readers have remained intrigued.\n\nTop Historical Fiction Novels\n\nTo celebrate this genre, here is a curated list of some of the most remarkable historical fiction novels ever.\n\n25. Gone with the Wind By Margaret Mitchell\n\nMargaret Mitchell created a cultural masterpiece when she penned Gone with the Wind. The historical fictional novel was published in 1936 and set against the backdrop of Clayton County and Atlanta, Georgia amid the tumultuous American Civil War. The book is not only a popular part of American literature, it was one of the leading novels to comfortably acknowledge the heaviness of complex issues like social class, race, war, gender and slavery in a way that stuck in the minds of consumers. To achieve this, Mitchell introduced readers to Scarlett O'Hara, whose character evolves as she navigates multiple changes and difficulties within the story. Scarlett is considered one of literature's most memorable and complex heroines, and Gone with the Wind is a monumental piece of literary art in American history. The work earned Mitchell a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937. Lovers of history, culture and classics can find this book on Simon & Schuster’s website.\n\n24. Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi\n\nYaa Gyasi’s Homegoing is a thematic masterpiece published in 2016 that explores difficult topics like slavery, freedom and strength. Gyasi blurs the boundaries of time and space by adapting a multigenerational narrative into the dark and burdensome legacy of slavery. The many characters in Gyasi’s Homegoing are multi-dimensional, making the story even more intriguing. Although Homegoing is Gyasi's debut book, it immediately cemented her role among her peers as a writer with the chops to approach intersecting characters, plots and places with seamless expertise. This book is a good read for anyone who is curious about slavery and the historical implications of it. The novel earned Gyasi an Audie Award for Literary Fiction & Classics and a PEN/Hemingway Award at the PEN Awards. The book is available for purchase at Penguin Random House.\n\n23. Beloved By Toni Morrison\n\nToni Morrison is revered as one of the 21st century's most respected writers and intellectuals, and Beloved is one of her most decorated pieces of work. In Beloved, Morrison tells the gut-wrenching story of Sethe, a freed woman who escapes her haunting days as a slave in Kentucky to live in Cincinnati, Ohio with her children. Although Sethe and her children are free, she is still haunted by the memories of her time as a slave. Her worst fears come true when her former slave master seeks her out, finds her and attempts to place her back into slavery. In a fit of panic, Sethe kills one of her children in the hopes of saving them from going back into the agony of slavery. Beloved touches on painful cultural touchstones that have helped to shape conversations on race, trauma and grit. Beloved was published in 1987, and won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988. It can be purchased at Penguin Random House.\n\n22. Things Fall Apart By Chinua Achebe\n\nNigeria’s Chinua Achebe has a distinct style of writing that is poetic yet profoundly impactful. In his 1958 novel Things Fall Apart, Achebe delves into the intricate nature of Nigerian society in the pre-colonial era, employing Okonkwo, the protagonist, as a guide. Achebe is not only a master at his craft, he is able to explain emblems of Nigerian traditions in ways that are both fascinating and compelling. The book explores the dichotomy of Okonkwo’s two worlds and his journey from being one of his village’s most respected men, to being exiled for accidentally murdering someone. Achebe takes readers on a journey from Nigeria in the pre-colonial era, through how the way of life in Nigeria’s Igboland undertook a seismic shift after colonialism took off in the late 19th century. Achebe manages the duality of both eras well without losing the reader. This book is a go-to for curious minds of other cultures and traditions. Things Fall Apart is available at Penguin Random House.\n\n21. A Midwife’s Tale By Laurel Thatcher Ulrich\n\nPulitzer Prize winner A Midwife's Tale strays away from the typical depiction of historical books. Instead, the book, released in 1990, immerses readers in a compelling true story drawn directly from the diary of an extraordinary woman, Martha Ballard. Martha, who is an eighteenth-century Maine midwife, gives readers cryptic details of her daily life and the scandals in her neighborhood, most of which would be befitting headlines for juicy gossip tabloids in modern times. The diary, which spans 27 years, was reimagined by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, who carefully re-packaged the story without sacrificing its core essence. The book also won a Bancroft Prize, and the Joan Kelly Memorial Prize in Women's History, among others. This book is a good fit for people who are intrigued by true stories that have been re-imagined. It can be purchased at Penguin Random House.\n\n20. Les Misérables By Victor Hugo\n\nVictor Hugo's magnum opus, Les Misérables, is considered a literary titan, and was so monumental that it was later adapted into a stage musical and a film. Hugo’s core objective with Les Misérables was to show the timeless and multifaceted elements of the human experience. Published in 1862, the epic novel delves into the complex web of themes, including social class, wealth, poeverty morality and injustice. Set against the tumultuous backdrop of post-revolutionary France in the early 19th century, Les Misérables follows troubled protagonist Jean Valjean, a former convict who seeks redemption after serving an extended prison sentence for a desperate minor theft. Through Jean, Hugo validates the marginalized members of society forced into lives of petty crime, not because they are morally incompetent, but because they are in dire circumstances. The powerful French classic can be purchased on Simon & Schuster’s website.\n\nThe Best Historical Fiction Romance Novels\n\nThere are several widely acclaimed historical fiction romance novels that have garnered a lot of praise for their aptness, well-researched historical settings and rich romantic storylines. Many of these books have gone on to be timeless classics in literature. Here are some of the best historical fiction romance novels of all time.\n\n19. Pride and Prejudice By Jane Austen\n\nSet in rural England at the turn of the 19th century, Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice is an iconic English classic, celebrated for its wit, social commentary and exploration of love and social class in the Regency era. Austen introduces readers to a spirited set of characters in the Bennet family, which consists of five fascinating sisters with a range of interests and personalities. Austen hones in on Elizabeth, the novel's heroine, a quick-witted and independent young woman who meets Fitzwilliam Darcy, a wealthy yet initially aloof gentleman who eventually strikes a romantic relationship with Elizabeth. Like its name denotes, the book explores societal expectations and the intersection of personal prejudices, which can show up in romantic relationships regardless of the era. Pride and Prejudice is currently available for purchase at Dover Publications.\n\n18. Outlander By Diana Gabaldon\n\nDiana Gabaldon's 1991 book series, Outlander, offers the mysterious story of Claire Beauchamp, a 20th-century British combat nurse who becomes an accidental time traveler when she finds herself transported back to 18th-century Scotland. Claire’s journey soon becomes an odyssey of romance, mystery and adventure when she crosses paths with a charming Scottsman, Jamie Fraser. Gabaldon’s effective storytelling prowess, characterized by meticulous historical attention to detail and engaging narrative, worked like a charm on readers, and the book has now sold over 50 million copies worldwide. The Outlander series is available to purchase on Penguin Random House.\n\n17. Persuasion By Jane Austen\n\nJane Austen’s Persuasion marks the pinnacle of her legacy as a writer who is acutely aware of prose and has the skills to direct a story. The book was released posthumously in 1817 alongside Northanger Abbey in a four-volume set. The storyline hinges on Anne Elliot's love affair with Captain Frederick Wentworth, with whom she rekindles a relationship eight years after her family convinced her not to marry him. After Captain Wentworth achieves significant social status, he is deemed an acceptable suitor for Anne. As only Austen knows how to do best, she underscores the themes of social class, love, jealousy and how all of these realities can exist within society’s rigid expectations. The vintage classic is available on the Penguin Random House website.\n\n16. The Grand Sophy By Georgette Heyer\n\nGeorgette Heyer created The Grand Sophy by tapping into the English Regency era, where society had very stiff expectations. Like most of Heyer’s work, The Grand Sophy has a riveting component to it: the ability to whisk readers away to a different world, where manners were as rigid as corsets and societal norms dictated every move. Heyer’s skillful storytelling follows the story of Sophy Stanton-Lacy, a strong-willed and unconventional young woman, and Charles Rivenhall, a wealthy heir. The two have different worldviews, but fall in love eventually. The Grand Sophy, which was published in 1950, is a classic tale of love's rebellion against societal expectations. It is available on its official publisher website, Sourcebooks.\n\n15. The Verdun Affair By Nick Dybek\n\nSome of the most powerful war stories also have interweaving themes of romance and human sorrow. In The Verdun Affair, Dybek ushers his readers into the aftermath of Europe’s World War I by following the story of Chicago natives Tom and Sarah Hagen, two Americans struggling to wrap their minds around the devastation of the war, but gradually developing an illicit affair. Dybek’s directorial approach to the book uncovers overarching topics of morality, love, loss and the haunting impact of war on humanity. For fans of historical fiction, this 2018-published book is undoubtedly a page-turner. Simon & Schuster currently carries the book.\n\n14. Seduce Me at Sunrise By Lisa Kleypas\n\nSet in the evocative landscape of 19th-century England, Lisa Kleypa’s Seduce Me at Sunrise is a fictional commentary on forbidden love, passion, longing and emotional depth.

Win, a wealthy heiress, and Kev, a Romani man with a checkered past, have diametrically opposed lives which influence the love they are trying to navigate against the conventions of their time. Seduce Me at Sunrise was published in the fall of 2008 and is available on Macmillan Publishers.\n\n13. The Nightingale By Kristin Hannah\n\nKristin Hannah’s The Nightingale is a historical exploration of northwestern France during World War II. The popular book dives into the story of Vianne Mauriac and Isabelle Rossignol, two daring sisters who take divergent paths in response to German’s invasion of France. Determined to fight for a just cause, the two sisters actively joined the French Resistance, embodying the spirit of defiance against the Nazi regime. This powerful move helped them to protect Jewish children and lead a revolution. The book was published in 2017 and is currently available to buy on the Macmillan Publishers website.\n\n12. Beneath a Scarlet Sky By Mark T T . Sullivan\n\nBased on the remarkable true story of an unsung hero, Beneath a Scarlet Sky is a powerful epic that showcases the extraordinary courage and resilience of Pino Lella, a spirited Italian young man trying to navigate life as a teenager. His life takes a sharp turn when his family home in Milan is blown up by Nazis. This sets him on a trajectory to take the war more seriously and do something meaningful about it. As the plot unfolds, he falls in love with Anna, a woman six years older than him. This complicates things a bit. Beneath a Scarlet Sky was inspired by a true story and highlights themes of courage, love and grit. It was published in 2017 by Lake Union Publishing, where it is currently being sold.\n\n11. City of Thieves By David Benioff\n\nIn City of Thieves, David Benioff offers readers a gripping coming-of-age story set against the backdrop of the Nazis’ siege of Leningrad. Benioff zeros in on Lev Beniov, the book’s main character and an ordinary guy whose life swiftly becomes extraordinary overnight when he gets arrested for stealing. While behind bars, he meets Kolya, who adds an unexpected twist to their fates, and instead of facing the firing squad, they're hit with a seemingly mundane, yet significant challenge — getting a dozen eggs for a high-ranking Soviet colonel’s daughter’s wedding cake. Due to siege-driven food shortages, their quest for eggs turns into a dangerous escapade through chaotic streets and enemy territory. The book was published in 2008 by Penguin Radom House where it is currently available for sale.\n\nThe Best Young Adult Historical Fiction Novels\n\nAuthors of young adult historical fiction novels are tasked with the responsibility offering a diverse range themes that are both engaging and compelling.

Through 16-year-old Ned Begay's perspective, readers get a front-row seat into the resilience and determination of the Navajo people during this precarious period in history. The book lauds Ned’s bravery well, but also highlights the challenges that Native Americans who were serving in the U.S. military encountered. Bruchac approaches these issues with sensitivity, addressing themes of identity, patriotism and the clash between tradition and the demands of war. Code Talker is currently available on Penguin Random House.\n\n8.

Rose Under Fire By Elizabeth Wein\n\nElizabeth Wein’s book Rose Under Fire follows the story of Rose, an American pilot whose fate takes an swift turn when she becomes a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany's arduous Ravensbrück concentration camp. Wein’s words guide young readers through the harsh realities of life within the confines of the concentration camp, showing the abject conditions that Rose and her fellow prisoners face.

If anyone is equal to this task, it is Ruta Sepetys, who makes this list for the second time with her 2022 release I Must Betray You. Like other notable pieces of work she has created, Sepetys guides readers through a harrowing 1980s of Communist Romania, ruled by Nicolae Ceaușescu; an era defined by intimidation, fear and secrecy. The protagonist, 17-year-old Cristian Florescu, is an ambitious young man who has big plans for his future — plans that are stifled by the mounting hostility in his country. Determined to stand up to oppression and demand change for other citizens, Florescu weighs the odds and comes to a gut-wrenching, yet brave conclusion in this incredible story. The book is available at Penguin Random House.\n\n1.

Bradley guides readers through the story with Ada, a young girl with a deformed foot whose mother keeps her confined to their one-bedroom home all her life. Eventually, when little brother Jamie is sent to London to escape the war, Ada uses the opportunity to escape too, only to find herself in the English countryside.

Bradley's portrayal of the impact of war on the lives of children adds a touching layer to this emotionally charged story. The War That Saved My Life is also available at Penguin Random House.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGripping storylines require a careful analysis of history in a way that makes readers care.
