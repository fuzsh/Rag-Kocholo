        "text": "School: Betends Unity High School, Idanre, Ondo State\n\n17 Years, Female\n\nMacmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners defined Patriot as someone who has a strong feeling of love, respect, and duty towards his country. From this definition we can see that the mind of a patriot is that of love which manifests in respect and duty towards his country.\n\nPatriotism has being displayed by many Nigerians and some are still displaying it at present within and outside Nigeria and it is hoped that patriotism will manifest in the future generations.\n\nA patriot is not just a nationalist, as a patriot loves his country and wants the best for his fellow citizens. He also has the mind of other nations and displays it in truth, justice and compassion. For instance, any Nigerian that participated in the rescue operation when plane crashed into the twin towers, displayed the mind of a patriot, therefore, a patriot could be a driver, teacher, student, nurse etc, the mid f a patriot is a noble mind, a mind that strives for excellence in whatever one does. For example, Professor Wole Soyinka’s writing many of which reflect the Nigerian cultural values won him a Nobel Prize in literature and brought prestige to Nigerians. He has been a model to may young ones, also his hard work and achievements has produced many scholars that are also distinguishing themselves in their various fields. A patriot must possess a brave mind and be committed to their duty; this can be seen in the Nigerian soldiers who defended the country in another nation and on peace keeping assignments. Many died in the process and the soldiers left alive are still committed to their duty post not minding the risk to their personal safety. In order to bring respect and dignity to his country, a patriot will seek freedom for their fellow citizens from any form of slavery and oppression. This was displayed by late Herbert Macaulay, late Chief Obafemi Awolowo and late Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe who fought for Nigeria independence. Nelson Mandela of South Africa also liberated the black South Africans from apartheid policy by the white South Africans.\n\nThe mind of a patriot is against any form of bad governance and violation of fundamental human rights. A patriot does not allow any government that wants to subjugate the policies and people of the countyr. Late Chief Gani Fawehinmi was called the senior advocate of the masses because of his fight against those who were in government for selfish interest and not to serve. He was also a philanthropist who helped many less privileged people.\n\nA patriot seeks to discover the things that would bring development to his country. Pa Taiwo Akinkunmi who designed the Nigerian national flag brought development to Nigeria and the flag is used to recognize Nigeria outside the country. Philip Emeagwali also used his super computer machine to bring about petroleum. He also won the Gordon Bell Prize and petrol, we all know, has been the backbone of Nigeria.\n\nEither as a leader or as a follower, a patriot must be a model to other citizens in both his private and public life. As a public office holder, a patriot uses the public resources at his disposal to develop the country instead of using it for his own selfish interest. Now that many of the law makers are law breakers, a patriot determines to be law abiding. The mind of a patriot is not at rest whenever there is no peace unity in his country, a patriot will try all his best to unite the nation. The Radio Nigeria slogan ‘Uplifting the people and uniting the nation’ should be a patriot’s watch word so he joins hands with interested citizens to make peace and unite his country. The mind of a patriot is a visionary mind, the mind that sees the future. For example, the organizers of this essay competition are seen as patriots because of the opportunity given to the young ones to show their potentials so that the mind of a patriot will develop in them.\n\nIn conclusion, the mind of a patriot is a mind of sacrifice; a patriot is not an honorary title. It is earned through selfless services of a sacrificial mind."
