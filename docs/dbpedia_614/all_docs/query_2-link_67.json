Without the amazing work of all of the Safer Internet Day supporters we wouldn’t be able to reach and inspire such a fantastic number of young people across the UK.\n\nDownload and use the UK Safer Internet Centre’s education resources and top tips\n\nFor Safer Internet Day the UKSIC have tailor made resources for 3-7s, 7-11s, 11-14s, 14-18s and parents and carers, along with some guidance for educators. Available in English and Welsh these free packs include lesson plans, posters, presentations, activities, top tips, films and more!\n\nWe know that across the UK many young people are learning remotely. To help support both educators and the young people they work with, we are currently making adaptations to the resources so that they work in the best possible way for both home learners and those still in educational settings. These adapted resources should be available in the next week.\n\nGet involved on social media\n\nWhy not share your support of Safer Internet Day by posting a message on your social media accounts? We have created a pack of possible posts and other key information which you can download here.\n\nSchedule this for 8am on Safer Internet Day\n\nThis year we need your help to start the conversation on Twitter! Please help us to start Safer Internet Day by scheduling the below Tweet to go out from your account at 8am on the 9th February:\n\nToday is Safer Internet Day! Join us and @UK_SIC this #SaferInternetDay to create a better internet – RT to show your support! saferinternetday.org.uk\n\nThis blog post was originally posted on the Childnet blog.\n\nDigital Leaders’ plans for the year ahead- the Digital Champions share their exciting plans to impact their school communities and support the programme\n\nPosted on\n\nWe have an exciting opportunity for qualified Secondary Digital Leaders to join our team of Digital Champions! Digital Champions are a group of Digital Leaders from across the UK who act as ambassadors for the programme.\n\nThe Digital Champions support the Childnet team, ensuring that the programme is youth led, and they also represent Digital Leaders at events and in consultations. Our current Digital Champions have been involved in many aspects of the programme, from presenting the Young People’s Charter for Safer Internet Day 2020 to MPs to testing new Digital Leader training modules.\n\nIf you are a Secondary Digital Leader who would like more responsibility in your role and to contribute towards the development of the programme, then don’t hesitate to apply to be a Digital Champion for 2020-21!\n\nThe information and application form to apply can be found here. If you have any questions about applying to be a Digital Champion then please email [email protected]. Note that the deadline for applications is Friday 20th November.\n\nWhat do the Digital Champions have planned for this year? How will they impact their school communities?\n\nWe can’t wait to see what all of our Digital Leaders achieve in their school communities this year. We asked our current Digital Champions about their plans for the year ahead and they shared some exciting ideas. Take a look at their answers below.\n\nWhat would you like to achieve in your school as a Digital Leader this year?\n\nMaryam: This year, at my school, we’re focussing on the reliability of the internet – more importantly, the dangers of fake news. After covering that module in the Digital Leaders Programme, some of us noticed that others were seemingly more gullible to internet facades. Although we depend on the internet for trustworthy advice, sometimes, more than others, are we faced with false information, which could impact us negatively. For example, thinking that a graze on the knee could be a potential fatal injury because the internet said so, does not necessarily mean that it’s true. Therefore, this year, the Digital Leader team at my school is trying to focus on educating the younger years and reminding the older years of what information is reliable and what isn’t so much (as due to the current COVID misinformation, it’s hard to tell what’s there to trust!).\n\nAs a Digital Champion, what aspects of the programme do you hope to be/will you be involved in this year?\n\nCosima: This year as a Digital Champion, I would really like to get involved in the educational side of the Digital Leaders Programme. I think now more than ever, with everyone still being isolated (or partially), we are all online so much more. The internet can be a really positive and happy place to communicate, learn and just have a fun time. But as we know there are so many risks if you don’t know what to look for going into it. With this heightened amount of online use globally, there are just so many more opportunities for something to go wrong. Over the summer, I saw and experienced a lot of them. And so now, going into this year – I would like to put that experience and knowledge into use.\n\nWhat activities would you suggest to new Digital Leaders this year? In what ways could they impact their school community?\n\nAimee: I would say that it is important to be open and approachable in a school community because it makes people more open to the idea of asking for help when they are stuck so any new Digital Leaders, and existing ones too, can try and set up small competitions to get people actively involved in learning about how to protect themselves and stay safe. You could also try to set up a small in-school forum where everyone can have discussion about online safety and hear other people’s opinions on the matter, it allows the entire school to bond and have fun, all while learning at the same time. Finally, I would recommend constantly having conversations with your Digital Leader team and getting to know each other because it makes it a lot easier to make an impact when you have a team supporting you. Make sure to enjoy yourself during the process!!!!\n\nWhat online safety topics will you be focussing on this year? What topics would you like to raise awareness and understanding of among young people?\n\nJess: As a Digital Champion, I would love to raise more awareness about Online Activism and the impact we, as young people, can make online. We all have a voice and we all have a platform, and I am really looking forward to being able to inspire others to use that voice to help express themselves and stand up for what they believe in. The online world can be an awesome place to share our beliefs and help spread awareness of things we care about, and I want to inspire others to do just that. I’m really looking forward to seeing what this next year as a Digital Champion entails, and I’m super excited to be able to help educate and inform others on what it means to be an Online Activist and how we can all use our voice to stand up for our beliefs.\n\nBlack inventors and pioneers who have influenced the way we use the internet and technology today\n\nPosted on\n\nOctober is UK Black History Month. As part of Childnet’s recognition of Black History Month, we wanted to recognise some of the Black individuals who have contributed to the way that we use technology and the internet today. In this blog post we will highlight some of the Black inventors, developers and pioneers who have played an important role in technological developments over the years, but are too often overlooked. Take a look below at a selection of some of these trailblazing and inspiring individuals:\n\nBlack pioneer in the development of the internet\n\nImage source: https://www.thoughtco.com/philip-emeagwali-4689182\n\nDr Philip Emeagwali is a computer scientist who was born in the 1950s in Nigeria and moved to the US to study Mathematics and marine engineering. Philip designed the programme for the fastest computer on earth which was made up of over 60,000 widely distributed microprocessors and ran more than 3.1 billion calculations per second!\n\nEmeagwali has said that his inspiration for this development came from watching bees working together in nature, and realised that he could build computer systems that can work and internally communicate like a beehive. This achievement led to him earning the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize from the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers, and this computing breakthrough of a practical way for computers to communicate with each other helped lead in the direction of the development of the internet. The technology that Philip designed is used today in the system of computers that are used by all search engines. So every time you do a Google search you can thank Dr Philip Emeagwali!\n\nBlack people who have led the way in technological developments\n\nImage Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granville_Woods\n\nThe inventor Granville T. Woods (1856–1910) was sadly often overlooked in comparison to others who were also developing new technologies at the time, particularly Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell.\n\nGranville T. Wood’s most important invention was the ‘induction telegraph’ in 1887. This allowed people to communicate by voice over telegraph wires, which until then was limited to only those who could communicate in morse code.\n\nThe patent for Woods’ invention was bought by Alexander Graham Bell, who is most commonly credited as the inventor of the telephone, but really Woods was integral to its development. Woods was also challenged by Thomas Edison (the inventor credited with the invention of the lightbulb) who took legal action against Woods to claim that the patent should belong to him. Woods is also responsible for many developments in transportation including the electric rollercoaster.\n\nImage source: https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/science-and-medicine/otis-bobby-boykin/\n\nOtis Boykin (1920-1982) was an inventor whose most important development was the improvement of electrical resistors in the 1960s, making many electrical devices much more reliable. Otis’ electrical resistor technology is used in televisions, radios, computers and many more electrical devices today!\n\nImage source: https://lessknownfacts.com/10-facts-about-marie-van-brittan-brown/\n\nMarie Van Brittan Brown (1922-1999) was a nurse who became the first person to develop a prototype for closed circuit television security, or as we more commonly call it, CCTV. Marie developed a system that would alert a homeowner and contact the authorities quickly. Her invention became the basis for the modern CCTV system that is widely used today.\n\nImage source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Ann_Jackson\n\nDr. Shirley Jackson is a physicist whose research and experiments have enabled others to work on many impressive telecommunications developments. These include the touch-tone telephone, the portable fax, caller ID, and the fiber-optic cable.\n\nImage source: https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/gladys-mae-west-1930/\n\nGladys West is a mathematician whose work contributed to the development of GPS (Global positioning system). GPS technology is now the basis of online map services like Google Maps that so many people and industries around the world rely on every day!\n\nImage source: https://www.caribbeannationalweekly.com/black-history-month-feature/black-history-month-spotlight-mark-dean/\n\nMark Dean is a computer scientist who has played a key part in the development of many computer technologies, including the colour computer monitor and the first gigahertz chip. He was also in the team who invented the system which allows for computer plug-ins such as disk drives and printers.\n\nImage source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Edward_Maceo_West\n\nJames E. West is an inventor and professor who developed the technology which is now used in modern microphones, including the microphones found in phones, camcorders, hearing aids and more.\n\nA forward-thinking Black leader in the tech industry\n\nImage source: http://physics4thecool.blogspot.com/2019/02/dr-marian-r-croak.html\n\nMarian R. Croak is the inventor of Voice over Internet Protocol, which enables us to use our internet network for voice and multimedia communications. Many of us have been using this technology more frequently over the last few month in the form of video conferencing software, such as Zoom or Skype calls. Marian has had an impressive career in the technology industry and has over 200 patents in her name, many of which are integral to the internet technologies we use daily. Marian was an early advocate in switching from wired telephone technology to internet services and has been a pioneer and forward thinker throughout her career. Marian also pioneered the use of phone network services to enable the public to easily donate to humanitarian causes. Marian currently works in research and development at Google.\n\nThis short blog post features only a few Black people who have been key in technological developments of the things we use regularly, but there are so many incredible Black inventors and scientists who have been integral to impressive and important inventions and developments! Take a look at the links below for some information on other Black inventors who are responsible for developing many of the things we use or see every day, from traffic lights to the imaging X-ray spectrometer!\n\nLinks to useful resources:\n\nhttps://www.black-inventor.com/\n\nhttps://thinkgrowth.org/14-black-inventors-you-probably-didnt-know-about-3c0702cc63d2\n\nhttps://www.cbcfinc.org/thevillage/2015/02/27/top-ten-black-inventors-you-didnt-know-about/\n\nhttps://www.history.com/news/8-black-inventors-african-american\n\nResources used in this article:\n\nhttps://www.black-inventor.com/dr-shirley-jackson\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/inventor/mark-dean\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/inventor/granville-t-woods#death-and-legacy\n\nhttps://www.thoughtco.com/philip-emeagwali-4689182\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/inventor/james-west#:~:text=James%20West%20Biography&text=James%20West%20is%20a%20U.S.,90%20percent%20of%20contemporary%20microphones.\n\nhttps://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/technology-biographies/granville-t-woods\n\nhttp://www.diversityhouse.org.uk/top-ten-black-inventors-may-not-heard/\n\nhttps://www.invent.org/inductees/otis-boykin\n\nhttps://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/croak-marian-r-1955/\n\nhttps://www.vipvoip.co.uk/international-womens-day-focus-on-marian-croak/\n\nThis blog post was originally posted on the Childnet website.\n\nAN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A DIGITAL CHAMPION!\n\nPosted on\n\nDo you have a passion for promoting online safety? Do you have a desire to help other young people? Do you have knowledge of the Childnet Digital Leaders online platform? Then this exciting new role is the one for you!\n\nThe Childnet Digital Leaders Programme is proud to be a youth-led and youth focused programme. However, we are continually striving to make it even better – this is where our Digital Champions come in!\n\nOur Digital Champions represent the entire Digital Leader community from across the UK. They meet and collaborate with other Digital Leaders outside of their school and they are Childnet’s ‘go-to’ group for new and exciting developments on the platform and the programme. If you have great ideas about developing new modules and activities on the platform and would like first-hand access to fun and engaging opportunities, then being a Digital Champion is the role for you!\n\nIn addition to all of these awesome perks, Digital Champions may have the opportunity to be involved in regional and national events as well as speak with and give advice to big tech companies and schools on how to keep other young people safe online – wow!\n\nYou may be thinking this is a little daunting? But have no fear, as you will receive top class support from the Childnet Digital Leaders team and other Digital Champions too throughout.\n\nWe currently have four Digital Champions and you can find out more about them here and how they have found their role within the Digital Leaders Programme so far here.\n\nAll we ask from you is that you commit for 1 year from December 2020-November 2021. During this year, we would require a minimum commitment of one video call per month as well as additional participation work – this shouldn’t take any more than 6 hours per month. For more information on this, please check out the information pack.\n\nIf you answered yes to all of the questions at the start, and believe you have what it takes to become a Digital Champion, then please fill out the application form included in the information pack and fill out the online form at www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/LW22982 (you may need to copy and paste link) and return all your signed consent forms by Friday 20th November.\n\nWe are super excited to hear from you and receive your applications. Good luck!\n\nLaunching Childnet and Nominet Digital Leaders Plus, Childnet’s new initiative in partnership with Nominet\n\nPosted on\n\nToday Childnet have launched a new online safety education partnership with Nominet, which will amplify and increase the reach of Childnet’s existing Digital Leaders Programme, allowing more young people across the UK to learn about online safety and take leadership roles in educating their peers.\n\nChildnet’s existing Digital Leaders Programme empowers children and young people to champion digital citizenship and digital creativity within their settings and to educate their peers, parents and teachers about staying safe online. The programme aims to make online safety learning fun and effective and helps settings work towards an outstanding whole school community approach to online safety. Childnet are working in partnership with Nominet to develop Childnet and Nominet Digital Leaders Plus, taking the programme further than ever before and reach settings across the breadth of the UK by offering at a significantly reduced rate.\n\n70% of the schools or organisations that have tried Childnet’s guest login have not gone on to subscribe to the programme, saying that whilst that they think it would be a fantastic addition to their curriculum, cost is a barrier. In response, Nominet is providing £125,000 of funding for a new bursary scheme, to expand the reach of the programme and support programme-wide updates of core materials.\n\nWill Gardner, CEO, Childnet says: “Young people tell us that they want to be actively involved in online safety education, and that it is more effective when they can learn from each other. The Childnet Digital Leaders Programme is all about peer education, and we are thrilled that Nominet shares this vision and is getting behind this pupil-powered initiative to help it reach new parts of the country, and help those who haven’t yet experienced it. Building on our successes to create Childnet and Nominet Digital Leaders Plus we’ll be able to reach thousands more children across the UK and ensure our resources are working as hard as they can be. We know Childnet Digital Leaders keeps kids safer online, and we are excited about the impact this partnership will have.”\n\nEllie Bradley, MD Registry & Public Benefit at Nominet says: “We strongly believe that finances should never be a barrier to learning about online safety. 59% of 11 to 12 year-olds are on social media, and over one in three internet users is a child. High levels of usage do not necessarily translate to high levels of skill or capability in using online platforms safely though, and that’s where our support can help established and credible programmes to amplify and broaden their reach with existing, high-quality resources with proven social impact. What’s key is that our partnerships in this space avoid further crowding of the online safety environment with new resources, and that we enable more children to access high quality guidance from trusted sources.”\n\nTake a look at the new Childnet and Nominet Digital Leaders Plus programme website to download an information pack and submit an application to join the programme.\n\nWe asked our Digital Champions about their highlights of being peer leaders over the last year\n\nPosted on\n\nThe Digital Champions are the youth ambassadors of the Childnet Digital Leaders Programme. Childnet work closely with them to ensure that the programme is youth-led, they have opportunities to represent the Digital Leader community in many ways, including at events and in consultations. You can find out more about the Digital Champions here.\n\nIn this blog we ask some of the Digital Champions about their experience in the role this year, including highlights and how they have found taking part in the group throughout the COVID-19 school closures. Thank you to Cosima, Jess and Aimee for their insightful and thoughtful responses, which you can read below.\n\nWhat has been your highlight of your Digital Champion role this year? ‌\n\nCosima: For me my biggest highlight was either presenting our charter at Westminster to the MPs or talking to Baroness Nicky Morgan at the BT centre event on Safer Internet Day!\n\nIt was such a unique experience that not many people my age would get to do!\n\nAt first talking to the MPs was a little daunting but as the day progressed I became a lot more fluent in what I was saying, I guess practice makes perfect! In addition, once Aimee went on to go and do her speech, and I had to do everything solo, I felt kind of proud of myself for being able to do that!\n\nAs it I was talking about something I was passionate about when it came to doing our stand at the event, I found it quite rewarding in a way to get the message across to so many different representatives of different companies. Oh and a bonus was that I was on the news hehe!\n\nHow have you found your Digital Champion role throughout the COVID-19 pandemic? ‌\n\nJess: During the COVID-19 pandemic, our lives have had to adapt in many ways, including the way we work and communicate. Although we haven’t been able to meet up in person a huge amount this year, by communicating online, the Digital Champions team has been able to keep in touch and continue to make a change. Personally, I feel as though being able to communicate more online has brought me closer to the team and made me feel like I am making a bigger impact with what I do. With more people using the online world as a way to chat with friends and work from home, we have been working hard to support our peers and other young people who are spending more time online and make sure they are safe and well. I feel like my role during this time has made me a more well-rounded person, and has helped me develop my communication and teamwork skills, despite only communicating through a screen. The rest of the team have done an awesome job of keeping us all informed and updated throughout this time, and I have felt more confident in my role than ever before. Although this has been an uncertain time for us all, I have felt more connected with not only my friends, but the rest of the Digital Champions and Childnet team and through more online communication, I have felt a bigger part of the team and a more confident person.\n\nWhat would you say to someone thinking about applying to be a Digital Champion next year? ‌\n\nAimee: If I could say one thing to someone who is thinking of applying to be a digital champion, I would say don’t allow any feelings of doubt, worry or anything else put you off it because it has been my best experience! It feels like a close family and you get to take part in a range of new and enjoyable opportunities that teach you so many skills as well as putting you in really influential positions with the ability to help and teach many people from all over. I’ve loved it so much and I would recommend it to everyone so, to everyone reading this, definitely try it!! 🙂\n\nThank you to our Digital Champions for sharing their thoughts on how they have found their role over the year. If you are interested in becoming a Digital Champion next year, then keep your eyes peeled for the next round of applications due to open in September.\n\nThe impact of the Digital Leaders Programme\n\nPosted on\n\nThe impact of the Digital Leaders Programme on young people’s online behaviours, confidence, knowledge and wellbeing as well as whole school impact.\n\nThe Digital Leaders Programme is Childnet’s peer to peer online safety training and leadership programme, available to UK educational settings. The programme empowers young people to be ‘Digital Leaders’, leading their peers and whole school community in online safety education. We regularly hear about the brilliant ways that Digital Leaders are impacting their communities, from leading assemblies for other year groups, to writing articles in school newsletters, and leading sessions for parents on how to support their children online.\n\nIn order to evaluate the impact of the programme, we conduct an annual survey for participants of the programme, including young people and their teachers. The results of this survey inform our annual Impact Report and we are happy to now present our Digital Leaders Programme Impact Report 2020! We are excited to share this report with the wider online safety community as we’re thrilled with the results. They are a testament to the incredible young people we have on the programme, who are working so hard to teach others about online safety.\n\nThe report shows how the programme impacts young people’s online behaviours, confidence, knowledge, and wellbeing, and prepares them to be peer educators. It found that:\n\n93% of Digital Leaders said the training made them feel more confident about educating pupils in their school\n\n81% of teachers have noticed safer online behaviours from young people as a result of the programme\n\n81% of teachers said the programme has helped their school staff fulfil their safeguarding duties.\n\nTake a look at the Digital Leaders Programme Impact Report webpage or two-page Impact Report document.\n\nTo learn more about how the Digital Leaders Programme could fit in to your school, visit the ‘How it Works’ page on the programme’s website. For further information and access to a free trial of the training platform, register your interest in the programme here: digital-leaders.childnet.com/join/.\n\nProgramme highlights and Digital Leader achievements over the academic year 2019/2020 – Part 2\n\nPosted on\n\nAs the school year has come to an end and summer holidays have begun, it is a great time for us to look back over the year at the Digital Leaders Programme. Take a look through this second part of a two-part roundup of the year including programme highlights and impact, as well as some of the brilliant achievements of Digital Leaders! Click here to look at part one.\n\nDigital Champions\n\nThis year we had 7 Digital Champions on the project, and you can read more about them here. The Digital Champions act as ambassadors for the programme and were involved in various additional activities throughout the year. Within their role, they supported the programme in many ways, including representing the Digital Leader community at events (see below), as well as providing feedback on new modules.\n\nTake a look at the upcoming guest blog post by this year’s Digital Champions where they reflect on their role within the programme. If you would like to apply to become a Digital Champion next year then keep your eyes on our blog and newsletter for information on applications opening next term!\n\nWe have kept in touch regularly with the Digital Champions as they have continued in their role throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you to the Champions for continuing to be active in their role and not letting school closures get in the way of their Digital Champion responsibilities! The screenshot below is from our most recent video call with the Champions, when we had a Zoom party to celebrate the end of the year. We also said farewell and best wishes to Bella and Niah who are leaving their Digital Champion roles!\n\nDigital Leader represented the UK at SIF Brussels 2019\n\nOne of our brilliant Digital Champions, Jess, was selected to represent the UK at the Safer Internet Forum in Brussels in November. Jess was selected to join the Better Internet for Kids (BIK) Youth Panel, made up of around 25 young people from different countries across Europe. In the lead up to the event, the group collaborated on a campaign to spread their message around the forum’s theme of ‘From Online Violence to Digital Respect’. At the forum they held discussions on online safety topics, led a youth session and facilitated roundtables of attendees. Read more about Jess’ experience attending the forum here.\n\nSafer Internet Day 2020\n\nYoung people from across the UK came together to celebrate positive use of the internet on Safer Internet Day 2020. The theme for this year was exploring identity online and young people celebrated the theme in incredible and creative ways. Many Digital Leaders took a lead in activities in their school; running assemblies, creating informative videos to share with peers and running surveys are just a few examples of the wonderful ways that Digital Leaders raised awareness of online safety. Take a look at the tweets below for some more examples of how Digital Leaders celebrated the day across the country.\n\nDigital Leaders met government and internet industry for Safer Internet Day 2020\n\nThe UK Safer Internet Centre hosted the annual Safer Internet Day event in London which was attended by representatives from the internet industry as well as services which support young people, government and policy. Groups of Digital Leaders from five schools attended the event and ran activities to get the guests thinking about the topic of exploring identity online. The pupils also asked questions to a live panel of representatives from organisations which support young people. The Digital Leaders played a crucial role in the day and ensured that young people’s online lives were the focus of the day. The youth host and key-note speaker were also Digital Leaders, Homyrah and Aimee, who both engaged the audience brilliantly and spoke with passion about the theme. Take a look at our roundup of the Safer Internet Day London event here.\n\nYoung People’s Charter for Safer Internet Day 2020\n\nThe UK Safer Internet Centre, in consultation with Digital Leaders across the UK, created the Young People’s Charter for Safer Internet Day 2020. The charter outlines four clear demands for the government to protect young people online, and support them to express their online identities. Digital Champions, Aimee and Cosima, presented the charter to MPs at Westminster on Safer Internet Day and spoke to them about the importance of the key demands for young people. Read more about Digital Leaders involvement in the Young People’s Charter here.\n\nProgramme Impact\n\nEarlier this year the Digital Leaders Programme reached some new milestones! The programme has now had over 1,000 subscriptions and over 4,000 young people have qualified as Digital Leaders! Read more about the journey to reaching these milestones here.\n\nThis month we released our 2020 Impact Report. It is really important for us to evaluate the impact of the programme each year so that we can measure it’s efficacy, strive to keep improving and share how vital youth-led online safety education is. Take a look at our annual Impact Report 2020 webpage here or the two-page Impact Report document here.\n\nDigital Leader tweets of the year\n\nWe love to see Digital Leaders featuring on their schools’ Twitter. Take a look below at some of our favourite Digital Leader tweets from this year.\n\nThere have been lots of programme highlights over the year and many more Digital Leader achievements! Thank you to all of the Digital Leaders who have taken part in the programme this year and to all of the supportive teachers running the programme at their schools. We look forward to continuing to develop the programme over the next academic year and hearing about the fantastic ways that Digital Leaders are impacting their communities!\n\nIf you have any questions about running the Childnet Digital Leaders Programme in your school, please do get in touch at [email protected].\n\nProgramme highlights and Digital Leader achievements over the academic year 2019/2020- Part 1\n\nPosted on\n\nAs the school year has come to an end and summer holidays have begun, it is a great time for us to look back at the activities that have happened as part of the Digital Leaders Programme over the last year. Take a read through this two-part roundup of the year including the programme’s highlights and impact, as well as some of the brilliant achievements of Digital Leaders!\n\nAdapting the programme through COVID-19 school closures\n\nThe end of this school year has been very different to other years due to the COVID–19 school closures. Back in March when the closures were announced, we adapted the programme to ensure that the young people were able to continue their online safety education and feel part of the Digital Leader community whilst learning from home. We have also extended all current subscriptions to cover the period of time that schools were closed and will review this extension again when the new school term begins. Take a look at our blog post about how the programme has continued to run over the last few months, ensuring that online safety stayed fresh in Digital Leaders’ minds while spending more time at home.\n\nEnd of Term Leaderboard\n\nCongratulations to the Digital Leader teams from Barnfield Primary School and Bellerbys College Cambridge who finished the school year top of the primary and secondary Leaderboards! Well done for your hard work earning points on the training platform this term and making you way to the top of the Leaderboard! We are excited to see which teams make it to the top next term.\n\nNew training modules\n\nThis year we released nine new training modules across our online platforms! Six of these modules were related to specific events such as Safer Internet Day and Anti Bullying Week, so were available on the platform exclusively for a limited period of time in the lead up to these events. These modules are designed to encourage Digital Leaders to engage with these campaigns. The other three modules are bonus training modules, two of which are for primary aged pupils and one is for secondary pupils and are on the topics of Safer Gaming and Data and Privacy respectively. These modules were developed in response to feedback from Digital Leaders, around what they what like to learn about on the programme. Thank you to JFS, Forest School and Sellincourt Primary, who were involved in creating these modules. The ‘Safer Gaming’ module was developed in collaboration with Roblox.\n\nWe’ve got some really exciting developments next year regarding our training modules so do keep your eyes peeled on our newsletter for more information!\n\nCardiff Regional Event\n\nIn November we had our fourth Digital Leaders Regional Event! This time the Childnet team travelled to St John’s College Junior School in Cardiff to host a Digital Leaders Regional Event for pupils from across the area. More than 50 young people were in attendance from several local schools. The event was an opportunity for young people to discuss online safety topics and collaborate on peer learning activities to take back to their own schools. The topic of the day was reporting, and pupils received training from Childnet’s expert team on how and what to report. To read more about the Regional Event look at our Regional Event blog post.\n\nIndustry Q&A\n\nThis year we released our first ever Industry Insider Q&A! The first edition of the series featured Laura Higgins, Director of Community Safety and Digital Civility at Roblox. Laura kindly answered some really fantastic questions that Digital Leaders had submitted. The questions covered many topics from reporting and safety in gaming to careers in tech. So many questions were submitted that we had to make the video into three parts! Thank you to all the Digital Leaders who submitted questions for the Q&A and thank you to Laura for taking the time to answer the brilliant questions. Take a look at Laura’s Q&A videos here.\n\nCommunity Prize Posts\n\nThe Community part of our training platforms are an open and monitored space for Digital Leaders to discuss important online safety topics, as well as share peer-learning ideas and experiences. At the beginning of this year we introduced Community Prize Posts for secondary Digital Leaders. By engaging in these Prize Post conversations, secondary pupils are in with the chance of winning a monthly prize. Winning posts are selected from the most thoughtful, relevant and insightful of all of the responses to Prize Posts within that month. Congratulations to all of the winners throughout the year and thank you to all of the Secondary Digital Leaders who have engaged with these posts. We look forward to more thought-provoking online safety conversations on the Community next year!\n\nTake a look at part two of this blog post for more highlights of the year!\n\nKeeping online safety at the forefront of young people’s minds during COVID-19 school closures\n\nPosted on\n\nAs part of the Digital Leaders Programme, young people receive online safety training via gamified online training platforms. We have two standalone platforms; one for primary pupils and one for secondary pupils. These platforms differ both in learning content and some functionality. The platforms also provide access to the Digital Leader Community (on the primary platform, teachers have the option whether to activate this feature or not) which allows young people to discuss important online safety topics and collaborate with peers.\n\nSecondary Digital Leaders\n\nThe secondary platform can be accessed by pupils remotely, and so during the COVID-19 school closures, we have encouraged Secondary Digital Leader teams to continue working through the training modules. Secondary Digital Leaders can engage with the other aspects of the programme and training platform, from engaging in discussions on the Community to watching our Industry Q&A videos. We have also encouraged Secondary Digital Leaders to take the opportunity to engage with the leadership element of the programme, starting conversations at home about online safety topics.\n\nPrimary Digital Leaders\n\nPrimary pupils are only able to access the training platform with a teacher present and so to keep online safety on Primary Digital Leader’s minds during the COVID-19 school closures, we introduced a new aspect to the programme – weekly primary activities. At the start of the school closures, we began sharing activities for teachers to in turn share with their Primary Digital Leaders, all of which can be completed independently by the students at home. A new online safety activity has been sent every week and activities have ranged from word searches to writing and drawing tasks, all designed to keep online safety on young people’s minds and to encourage conversations on the subject at home within the family. Take a look below at Oskar from Groveland Primary School’s fantastic poster in response to one of the weekly primary activities.\n\nChildnet Film Competition\n\nThis year the Childnet Film Competition was adapted to make entering from home easier than ever before and proved to be a great home learning project for young people. We were delighted to see Digital Leaders enter the competition which consisted of Solo, Group and Storyboard categories. One of our Digital Leaders went on to win the Secondary solo category! Take a look at the finalists films here."
