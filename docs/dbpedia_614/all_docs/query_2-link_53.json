        "text": "Some refer to him as Africa’s Bill Gates, but I don’t think that gives the supercomputer scientist the credit he deserves.\n\nThe internet in it’s entirety owes itself to many brilliant minds. There were many mathematicians and scientists who contributed to its development; computers were sending signals to each other as early as the 1950s. But the Web owes much of its existence to Philip Emeagwali, a math whiz who came up with the formula for allowing a large number of computers to communicate at once. This great mind had to leave school because his parents couldn’t afford the fees. He lived in a refugee camp during a civil war. He won a scholarship to university and went on to invent a formula that lead to computers being able to perform 3.1billion calculations per second.(a moment of silence is required to come to grips with this great feat)\n\n(damn)\n\nThe internet is the repository of all of man’s knowledge, that can be accessed by any anyone on the planet with a connection. Which is incredible.\n\nThe discovery earned him the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers’ Gordon Bell Prize in 1989, considered the Nobel Prize of computing, and he was later hailed as one of the fathers of the Internet. Since then, he has won more than 100 prizes for his work and Apple computer has used his microprocessor technology in their Power Mac G4 model. Today he lives in Washington with his wife and son.\n\nHe was interviewd by TIME and this is what he had to say. “The Internet as we know it today did not cross my mind,” Emeagwali told TIME. “I was hypothesizing a planetary-sized supercomputer and, broadly speaking, my focus was on how the present creates the future and how our image of the future inspires the present.”\n\nHere’s a video by BBC News where Philip talks about the internet and Africa’s future role in the world due to it’s influence.\n\n-The cat."
