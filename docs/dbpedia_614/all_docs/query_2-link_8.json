        "text": "Emeagwali Voted Historys\n\n35th Greatest African\n\nLONDON - Philip Emeagwali was voted the 35th greatest African of all time in a survey for New African magazine, it was announced on August 26, 2004. Emeagwali also ranked as the greatest African scientist ever.\n\nThe technology category was topped by Imhotep, the multi-genius that designed Egypt's first pyramid. The science category was topped by Emeagwali famed for helping give birth to the supercomputer, the technology that gave rise to the Internet.\n\nEmeagwali's discovery of a formula that enables supercomputers powered by 65,000 electronic brains called \"processors\" to perform the worlds fastest calculations inspired the reinvention of supercomputers - from the size and shape of a loveseat to a thousand-fold faster machine that occupies the space of four tennis courts, costs 400 million dollars a piece, powered by 65,000 processors and that can perform a billion billion calculations per second.\n\nEmeagwali reformulated Newtons Second Law of Motion as 18 equations and algorithms; then as 24 million algebraic equations; and finally he programmed and executed those equations on 65,000 processors at a speed of 3.1 billion calculations per second.\n\nEmeagwali's 65,000 processors, 24 million equations and 3.1 billion calculations were three world records that garnered international headlines.\n\nThe list was topped by South Africa's Nelson Mandela and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah.\n\nThe London-based magazine said responses flooded in after the survey was launched last December to nominate the top 100 most influential Africans or people of African descent.\n\nHeroes of independence movements in Africa and African-American figures in the United States figure prominently on the list.\n\nPatrice Lumumba, Congo's first post-colonial prime minister, ranks sixth, followed by US civil rights leader Martin Luther King.\n\nPele, the legendary Brazilian soccer star, comes in 17th, followed by Jamaican reggae singer Bob Marley, numbering among those called \"Diasporans\" by New African.\n\nRadical civil rights leader Malcolm X, at ninth, is a rank above United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, from Ghana, who comes just ahead of US boxer Muhammad Ali.\n\nFew women made the cut. The highest-ranked female, at 12th, is Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, former wife of the South African president. Others include the dynamic duo of tennis, American sisters Venus and Serena Williams (together ranked 73rd), and ancient Egyptian queen Nefertiti at number 81.\n\nThe magazine noted that most of the top 100 are from Africa's post-colonial period.\n\nHave people forgotten Africa's history? Must this worry us, as a people? it asked.\n\nThe list appears in the August-September issue of New African, which has a circulation of roughly 30, 000 across dozens of countries. It said this is the first such survey it has carried out in a decade. -- South African Press Association & Agence France-Presse, Sapa-AFP (with contributions from other sources).\n\nChronology of Emeagwalis Life\n\n1921. James Nnaemeka Emeagwali (father of Philip) born in May in Onitsha, Nigeria.\n\n1938. Agatha Emeagwali, née Balonwu, (mother of Philip) born on August 7 in Onitsha.\n\n1954 Chukwurah Emeagwali born on August 23 in Akure, Nigeria.\n\n1955 Baptized as Philip\n\n1960 Enrolls in 1st grade in January. Nigeria gains independence from Britain on October 1.\n\n1962 Philip (far right) in family photo taken on December 24 in Uromi, Nigeria.\n\n1966 Nigerian military overthrows elected government. Civil uprising with 30,000 dead.\n\n1967 Nigerian-Biafran war begins in May. One million died in 30-month war.\n\n1968Emeagwali family fled Onitsha for the fourth and final time.\n\n1969Emeagwali conscripted into the Biafran army in August, sent to Oguta war front.\n\n1970Biafran army defeated in January. Emeagwali is discharged from the Biafran army.\n\n1973Emeagwali wins a mathematics scholarship to study in the U.S.\n\n1981 Marries Dale Brown on August 15 in Baltimore, Maryland. Continues scientific research at National Weather Service.\n\n1983 Obtains U.S. permanent residency Green Card visas for his 35 closest relatives.\n\n1987 Programs 65,536 electronic brains, called processors to perform the worlds fastest calculation.\n\n1989 Wins the Gordon Bell Prize alone, the equivalent in the supercomputer industry of the Nobel Prize.\n\n2000 Bill Clinton extols Emeagwali as one of the great minds of the Information Age.\n\n2004New African magazine poll ranks Emeagwali as historys greatest scientist of African descent.\n\nIs Emeagwali the Next Imhotep?\n\nThe science and technology categories of 100 Greatest Africans were topped by Emeagwali (left below) and Imhotep (right below), respectively.\n\nImhotep was deified nearly 5,000 years ago and worshipped by early Christians as one with Christ. Imhotep has been called the father of medicine, the world's first recorded scientist, and patron ofancient scribes. James Henry Breasted wrote that Imhotep was the patron spirit of the later scribes, to whom they regularly poured out a libation from the water-jug of their writing outfit before beginning their work.\n\nHow the Poll Was Conducted\n\nBelow are explanations excerpted from 2003 issues of New African magazine:\n\nNew African will be running over the next few months a survey in which you, our readers, are asked to nominate who you think are the greatest Africans  past or present, continental or Diasporan, male or female.\n\nThe last time we published such a poll was in 1990 ... This time we have broadened the choice, to include personalities from all walks of life  Politics, Sport, Media, Music, Entertainment, Science and Technology ...\n\nFill out the form below with your nominations with a brief justification as to why you think your choice should be among the top 100 Greatest Africans of all time.\n\nWe will publish the winning top 100 over the course of next year.\n\nOther Polls Conducted\n\nEmeagwali & Nobel laureate Maathai are co-winners of African of the Year.\n\nAfricaHot100\n\nTop 100 Hot List 2006\n\nEvery year, internet users vote for the 100 hottest Africans without even being aware of it. Each search for a celebrity is recorded by Yahoo and it counts as one vote. We took a snapshot from Yahoo to see who made the list of the top 100 most searched-for African heroes, for 2006. It is also a list of the most talked about, those that captured your attention and imagination the most.\n\nPut differently: Which celebrity of African descent will receive the most invitations for an evening of conversation or a meet-and-greet? If Internet users were the only voters, Michael Jackson would run away with the gong, getting twelve times more searches than the venerable Nelson Mandela.\n\nMartin Luther King and Bob Marley were runner-ups. Nelson Mandela was #10, Kofi Annan was #19, Philip Emeagwali was #32, and Olusegun Obasanjo was #52.\n\nAn interesting information that emerged is that an American celebrity is 100 times more likely to be searched than an African one. The reason is that while all Americans can look up someone on the Internet only one percent of Africans can do so.\n\nExcept for Bob Marley and Nelson Mandela, all the top ten searches were for African-Americans. Kofi Annan and Haile Selassie barely squeezed into the top 20.\n\nWe used the list of 100 greatest Africans from a New African magazine poll and entered them into a yahoo marketing tool to obtain search entries entered during 30-day period. These rankings reflect search entries compiled between April 5-10, 2006.\n\nA celebritys buzz score is the number of times he or she was searched in a 30-day period.\n\nA-List Celebrities or Pin Ups\n\nRank Buzz Index Celebrity\n\n1 540006michael jackson\n\n2 338582 martin luther king jr\n\n3 329681 bob marley\n\n4 289358rosa parks\n\n5 198281maya angelou\n\n6 162155malcolm x\n\n7 124717muhammad ali\n\n8 80191 bill cosby\n\n9 75655serena williams\n\n10 45223 nelson mandela\n\n11 28226marcus garvey\n\n12 27003eddie murphy\n\n13 26056jesse owens\n\n14 20440venus williams\n\n15 17508thierry henry\n\n16 14583hannibal\n\n17 14532pele\n\n18 10208louis farrakhan\n\n19 6570kofi annan\n\n20 6198haile selassie\n\n21 6013w.e.b du bois\n\n22 5084shaka zulu\n\n23 4943zinedine zidane\n\n24 4844imhotep\n\n25 4127 queen of sheba\n\nB-List Celebrities (or Superstars)\n\nRank Buzz Index Celebrity\n\n26 3530chinua achebe\n\n27 3452 queen nefertiti\n\n28 3310desmond tutu\n\n29 3280toussaint louverture\n\n30 3045mansa musa\n\n31 2952akhenaten\n\n32 2634philip emeagwali\n\n33 2573robert mugabe\n\n34 2571youssou ndour\n\n35 2129salif keita\n\n36 1950fela kuti\n\n37 1922kwame nkrumah\n\n38 1662jomo kenyatta\n\n39 1626 john henrik clarke\n\n40 1566anwar sadat\n\n41 1512winnie mandela\n\n42 1487miriam makeba\n\n43 1433wole soyinka\n\n44 1151gamal abdel nasser\n\n45 1102brenda fassie\n\n46 1094 bunny wailer\n\n47 1068patrice lumumba\n\n48 945hugh masekela\n\n49 945thabo mbeki\n\n50 768steve biko\n\nC-List Celebrities\n\nRank Buzz Index Celebrity\n\n51 619cheikh anta diop\n\n52 561olusegun obasanjo\n\n53 548oliver mtukudzi\n\n54 545 jay jay okocha\n\n55 483george weah\n\n56 477julius nyerere\n\n57 469 queen nzinga\n\n58 406walter rodney\n\n59 397leopold senghor\n\n60 388manu dibango\n\n61 343 ken saro wiwa\n\n62 329museveni yoweri\n\n63 291amilcar cabral\n\n64 256thomas sankara\n\n65 250azikiwe nnamdi\n\n66 246 peter abrahams\n\n67 246yaa asantewaa\n\n68 189 f w de klerk\n\n69 185oliver tambo\n\n70 178franz fanon\n\n71 166walter sisulu\n\n72 163ali mazrui\n\n73 159samora machel\n\n74 153kenneth kaunda\n\n75 153zumbi\n\nD-List Celebrities\n\nRank Buzz Index Celebrity\n\n76 150 marc vivien foe\n\n77 142abdelaziz bouteflika\n\n78 139obafemi awolowo\n\n79 135 roger milla\n\n80 126milton obote\n\n81 119 cardinal arinze\n\n82 113abedi pele\n\n83 111hamilton naki\n\n84 104maria mutola\n\n85 103joshua nkomo\n\n86 102abdoulaye wade\n\n87 97houphouet boigny\n\n88 91eduardo mondlane\n\n89 86 tom mboya\n\n90 83helen suzman\n\n91 69dedan kimathi\n\n92 68sam nujoma\n\n93 68 sir seretse khama\n\n94 68george padmore\n\n95 61muammar qadafi\n\n96 55 john chilembwe\n\n97 54hendrik witbooi\n\n98 47janani luwum\n\n99 44tubman william\n\n100 40ahmed sekou toure\n\nE-List Non-Celebrities\n\nRank Buzz Index Celebrity\n\n101 37ahmed baba\n\n102 30mko abiola\n\n103 25joaquim chissano\n\n104 0hosea kutako\n\n105 0tafewa balewa\n\n106 0 alpha oumar konare\n\n107 0felix konotey-ahulu\n\n108 0 victor anomah ngu\n\nTop Twenty African Celebrities\n\n1 45223 nelson mandela\n\n2 14583hannibal\n\n3 6570kofi annan\n\n4 6198haile selassie\n\n5 5084shaka zulu\n\n6 4943zinedine zidane\n\n7 4844imhotep\n\n8 4127 queen of sheba\n\n9 3530chinua achebe\n\n10 3452 queen nefertiti\n\n11 3310desmond tutu\n\n12 3045 mansa musa\n\n13 2952akhenaten\n\n14 2634philip emeagwali\n\n15 2573robert mugabe\n\n16 2571youssou ndour\n\n17 2129salif keita\n\n18 1950fela kuti\n\n19 1922kwame nkrumah\n\n20 1662jomo kenyatta\n\nTop Ten Nigerian Celebrities\n\nRank Buzz Index Celebrity\n\n1 26 3530chinua achebe\n\n2 32 2634philip emeagwali\n\n3 36 1950fela kuti\n\n4 43 1433wole soyinka\n\n5 52 561olusegun obasanjo\n\n6 54 545 jay jay okocha\n\n7 61 343 ken saro wiwa\n\n8 65 250azikiwe nnamdi\n\n9 78 139obafemi awolowo\n\n10 81 119 cardinal arinze\n\nWe used the most common spellings and each individual had related associated searches that were excluded.
