        "text": "Nigerian Scientist, Philip Emeagwali, Named Among Ten Most Intelligent People In The World\n\nPhilip Emeagwali has been listed as amongst the top 10 most intelligent people in the world, having the acclaimed IQ of 190.\n\nPhilip Emeagwali, of course, is a renowned and world-acclaimed engineer, mathematician, computer scientist and geologist who was one of two winners of the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize, a prize from the IEEE, for his use of a Connection Machine supercomputer to help detect petroleum fields.\n\nHe has the 9th slot directly below Marilyn vos Savant, 8th with verified IQ of 190 and directly above 10th placed Garry Kasparov who is alleged to have an IQ of 190.\n\nThe Igbo-born Nigerian is credited for inventing a formula that allows supercomputers powered by thousands of processors to perform billions of calculations per second, a discovery that made international headlines and inspired the reinvention of supercomputers.\n\nThe supercomputer comprises of thousands of networked computers and the Internet also comprises of millions of networked computers. The supercomputer spawned the Internet.\n\nEmeagwali’s 1970s hypothesis on 64,000 networked computers around the Earth led to his programming of 64,000 processors inside a big box to perform 3.1 billion calculations per second, a world record in 1989. For the latter achievement, he won the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize, which is the “Nobel prize of supercomputing.”\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nFacts: 25 Facts About Cats That Are Totally Unbelievable(Must See)\n\nCats are often shaded in a bad light for hating humans but a new study says they actually likes people more than we think. In a research conducted on the cute creature, it is discovered their snobbish and aloof behaviour may simply be misunderstood.\n\nThe trio, Kristyn Vitale Shreve, Lindsay Mehrkam and Monique Udell who conducted the experiment with Oregon State University and Monmouth University noted that Felis catus have complex socio-cognitive problem-solving abilities.\n\nEvidence that Cats Likes their owners\n\nIn order to assess the degree to which cats like (or are stimulated by) certain things, the researchers tested reactions from two groups of 19 cats each—those living with people and those living in a shelter. The pets were kept separated for two and a half hours and were then watched as they were presented with three items from one of four category types: food, scent, toy and human interaction.\n\nThe researchers mixed up the stimuli for the different cats to get a better read on which they found the most stimulating. The degree of preference for any one stimulus was judged by which stimulus the cat went for first and how and for how long it interacted with it.\n\nResearchers found that overall social interaction with humans was the stimulus most preferred. That is, half of the cats chose interacting with a human above anything else offered, which included food—they spent on average 65% of their time interacting with a person.\n\nHilarious Facts About Cats\n\n1. One legend claims cats were created when a lion on Noah’s Ark sneezed and two kittens came out.\n\n2. When they leave their poop uncovered, it is a sign of aggression to let you know they don’t fear you.\n\n3. Hearing is the strongest of cat’s senses: They can hear sounds as high as 64 kHz — compared with humans, who can hear only as high as 20 kHz.\n\n4. Contrary to what we believe, cats don’t eat raw fish.\n\n5. The world’s richest cat is worth $13 million after his human owner passed away and left her fortune to him.\n\n6. The world’s largest cat measured 48.5 inches long.\n\n7. Cats sleep 70% of their lives.\n\n8. A cat has been mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska, for 15 years. His name is Stubbs, and one ran for mayor of Mexico City in 2013.\n\n9. They can survive falls from over 32 stories (320 meters) onto concrete.\n\n10. A group of cats is called a clowder and they have 20 muscles that control their ears.\n\n11. Evidence suggests that domesticated cats have been around since 3600 B.C., 2,000 years before Egypt’s pharaohs.\n\n12. In ancient Egypt, killing a cat is forbidden partly because they provided the great service of controlling the rat population. They were also mythic symbols of divinity in ancient Egypt.\n\n13. The animal was pronounced demonic in the 15th century by Pope Innocent VIII and gave orders to began killing of cats – It’s no wonder why the animal is widely hated in Nigeria.\n\n14. Cats can’t taste sweetness. When they grimace, they are usually “taste-scenting,” – using an extra organ that, with some breathing control, allows them to taste-sense the air.\n\n15. A cat’s cerebral cortex (the part of the brain in charge of cognitive information processing) has 300 million neurons, compared with a dog’s 160 million.\n\n16. They have a lower social IQ than dogs but can solve more difficult cognitive problems when they feel like it, as well as a longer-term memory than dogs, especially when they learn by actually doing rather than simply seeing.\n\n17. A cat’s brain is 90% similar to a human’s — more similar than to a dog’s, which explains why cats and humans have nearly identical sections of the brain that control emotion.\n\n18. Adult cats only meow to communicate with humans. They also recognise their owner’s voice but just acts too majestic to care (probably because they are).\n\n19. A study claims cats make more than 100 different sounds whereas dogs make around 10. They can change their meow to manipulate a human and often imitate a human baby when they need food.\n\n20. Abraham Lincoln is said to have kept four cats in the US White House, and when asked if her husband had any hobbies, Mary Todd Lincoln reportedly replied “cats.”\n\n21. The first cat in space was French named Felicette, or “Astrocat.” She also survived the trip.\n\n22. The reason why they are able to squeeze through very small spaces is because they have free-floating clavicle bones that attach their shoulders to their forelimbs.\n\n23. Most cats don’t like water because their cool and soft coat do not insulate them well.\n\n24. They can be domestic or wild animals.\n\n25. They are the most popular pet in the United States: There are 88 million pet cats and 74 million dogs in the US.\n\n↧\n\n4 Easy Ways On How To Report Any Form Of Police Abuse/Brutality In Nigeria\n\nSo today we plan to encourage you not to fear the police for no reason, stop being cheated and act like a civilized citizen.\n\nFellow Nigerians, you can now report any form of police brutality to the Nigeria Police Force Public Complaint Rapid Response Unit via:\n\n– TT: @PoliceNG_PCRRU\n\n– Whatsapp/SMS – 08057000003\n\n– Call – 08057000001 or 08057000002\n\n– The BBM Pin is 58A2B5DE.\n\nTheir quick response will put a smile on your face.\n\n↧\n\nNew: Five Sexual Acts That May Cause Cancer\n\nS3x as an act does not cause cancers but the viruses and infections transmitted from an infected partner during unprotected sexual activity can lead to cancer. As individuals, we are aware of sexual transmitted diseases transmitted during sexual intercourse but little or no awareness has been done to enlighten the population on certain cancers that can occur as a result of sexual activities. In this article, we will discuss on 5 sexual acts that may cause cancer.\n\n1. Oral sex\n\nOral s3x is the act of stimulating the genitals of one’s partner during sexual activity with the use of the mouth including the tongue and lips. This act can be enjoyed by most partners and it is termed as ‘fellatio’ when it is performed on the male by the female partner and ‘cunnilingus’ when performed by the male on the female partner. Oral s3x also includes the use of the mouth to stimulate the anal region.\n\nIt is now widely acceptable as a form of sexual pleasure by most people and it is no longer seen as a taboo. As harmless as it may look, oral s3x can pose great health risk to both sexual partners. The risk of STI is, however, lower when compared to other forms of sexual activity. During oral s3x, the risk of transmission of Human papilloma virus (HPV) increases and this can lead to cancer of the mouth and the throat.\n\nHPV transmitted during oral se-x gets into the cells of the mouth and throat leading to the mutation in the genes of the cells hence causing cancer of the mouth and the throat. The risk of developing throat cancer is higher in patients with HIV co-infection.\n\n2. Unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse\n\nMuch awareness via the media has been done to enlighten the public on the risk of contracting HIV by having unprotected sexual intercourse with a casual partner. However, little has been done to enlighten the public on cancers that can occur as a result of unprotected sexual intercourse. During unprotected sexual intercourse, there is contact with body fluids (semen, saliva, vaginal secretions) which acts as media for transmission of viruses e.g. HIV, HCV, HBV and HPV (present in the cells of the skin around the genital regions). This can lead to cervical cancer from HPV; HIV can lead to Kaposi’s sarcoma and liver cancer from HBV and HCV.\n\n3. Anal sex\n\nEngaging in unprotected anal sex increases the risk of HIV and HPV transmission with anal s-ex leading to cancers. This is because of the higher risk of bruises of the delicate anal mucosa. Several studies carried out in homos-exual men revealed that they have a higher chance of HIV, HPV, HBV and HCV transmission than in heteros-exual couples and this can lead to anal warts, cancers of the anal region, colorectal cancer and even liver cancer from the transmission of HBV and HCV.\n\n4. Fingering\n\nIn fingering, the hands of the male partner are used to stimulate the vagina and the genital regions of the female partner. This is a very common sexual practice that is termed to be harmless. Although the risk of transmission of HIV and other STIs is very low with fingering, it still poses some health risk. Sores or slight bruises of the fingers can act as an entry point for viruses to gain access into the body and establish an infection. Cancers of the skin of the hands and fingers have been reported in men who frequently engage in fingering with partners infected with HPV. The virus gain access into the cells of the skin of the fingers via the cut. It then enters into the cells and alters the genetic makeup of the cells causing an uncontrolled growth of the cancerous cells.\n\n5. Kissing\n\nThis is the most common form of se-xual activity and it is usually the first act that develops into se-xual intercourse. During passionate kissing, there is exchange of saliva which is termed to be a body fluid and it may act as a medium for the exchange of viruses like Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) which cause infectious mononucleosis commonly referred to as “the kissing disease”. EBV has been implicated a risk factor for Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cancer of the lymph nodes) and nasopharyngeal cancer. Also, HPV can be transmitted via the mouth of an infected person during kissing to a susceptible partner\n\n↧\n\n2019 Presidential Elections Requirements: See How Much Presidential Nomination Forms Would Cost\n\nThe Senate on March 30, passed the Electoral Act No 6 2010 (Amendment) Bill 2017 and one of the things it will do when signed into law, is abolish arbitrary fees for nomination forms fixed by political parties.\n\nBefore now, the parties demanded high fees for nomination forms from aspirants, fixing a price as it deemed fit.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari famously claimed he borrowed money to pay for his nomination form which cost N25 Million, in the build up to the 2015 general elections.\n\nHowever, the Bill has now put a N10 Million limit on the forms.\n\nThe Bill is also aimed at instituting reforms in the electoral process by making it more free, fair and credible.\n\nHERE ARE 17 HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BILL\n\n– It stipulates that “there shall now be full biometric accreditation of voters with smart card readers and/or other technological devices, as INEC may introduce for elections from time to time”.\n\n– It provides that “presiding officers must now instantly transmit accreditation data and results from polling units to various collation centres. Presiding officer who contravene this shall be imprisoned for at least five years (no option of fine)”.\n\n– It states that “all presiding officer must now first record accreditation data and polling results on INEC’s prescribed forms before transmitting them. The data/result recorded must be the same with what they transmitted”.\n\n– INEC now has unfettered powers to conduct elections by electronic voting.\n\nBesides manual registers, INEC is now mandated to keep electronic registers of voters.\n\n– INEC is now mandated to publish voters’ registers on its official website(s) for public scrutiny at least 30 days before a general election and any INEC staff that is responsible for this but fails to act as prescribed shall be liable on conviction to six months’ imprisonment.\n\n– INEC is now mandated to keep a national electronic register of election results as a distinct database or repository of polling unit by polling unit results for all elections conducted by INEC.\n\nCollation of election result is now mainly electronic, as transmitted unit results will help to determine final results on real time basis.\n\n– INEC is now mandated to record details of electoral materials – quantities, serial numbers used to conduct elections (for proper tracking).\n\n– A political party whose candidate dies after commencement of an election and before the declaration of the result of that election now has a 14-day window to conduct a fresh primary in order for INEC to conduct a fresh election within 21 days of the death of the party’s candidate.\n\nPolitical parties’ polling agents are now entitled to inspect originals of electoral materials before commencement of election and any presiding officer who violates this provision of the law shall be imprisoned for at least one year.\n\n– No political party can impose qualification/disqualification criteria, measures or conditions on any Nigerian for the purpose of nomination for elective offices, except as provided in the 1999 constitution.\n\n– The election of a winner of an election can no longer be challenged on grounds of qualification, if he, the (winner) satisfied the applicable requirements of sections 65, 106, 131 or 177 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), and he is not, as may be applicable, in breach of sections 66, 107, 137 or 182 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. (For example, a person’s election cannot be challenged on the grounds that he did not pay tax, as this is not a qualifying condition under the constitution.)\n\n– All members of political parties are now eligible to determine the ad-hoc delegates to elect candidates of parties in indirect primaries. The capacity of party executives to unduly influence or rig party primaries has been reasonably curtailed, if not totally removed.\n\nParties can no longer impose arbitrary nomination fees on political aspirants. The bill passed prescribes limits for each elective office as follows:\n\n(a) N150, 000 for a ward councillorship aspirant in the FCT;\n\n(b) N250, 000 for an area council chairmanship aspirant in the FCT;\n\n(c) N500, 000 for a house of assembly aspirant;\n\n(d) N1, 000, 000 for a house of representatives aspirant;\n\n(e) N2, 000, 000 for a senatorial aspirant;\n\n(f) N5, 000, 000) for a governorship aspirant; and\n\n(g) N10, 000, 000) for a presidential aspirant.\n\n– Relying on the powers of the national assembly in Paragraph 11 of Part II (Concurrent Legislative List) of the Second Schedule (Legislative Powers) to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), the senate also passed measures reforming procedures regulating local government elections. State independent electoral commissions can no longer conduct elections that do not meet minimum standards of credibility.\n\nAlso, any INEC official who disobeys a tribunal order for inspection of electoral materials shall be imprisoned for two years, without an option of a fine.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nActress Eucharia Anunobi Full Biography\n\nBIRTH NAME: Eucharia Anunobi\n\nDATE OF BIRTH: born 25 May 1965\n\nOCCUPATION: Actress, Movie Producer, Pastor\n\nMARITAL STATUS: Not Married\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEucharia Anunobi is a popular veteran Nigerian actress, producer, and pastor. She is best known for her roles in the movies like Abuja Connection, Glamour Girls and more.\n\nEARLY LIFE AND BACKGROUND\n\nEucharia was born in Owerri, Imo State and went on to complete her primary and secondary school education there before she proceeded to the Institute of Management Technology, Enugu where she graduated with a National Diploma in Mass Communication. She also holds a Bachelor of Arts award after studying English Language at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\n\nCAREER AND LIFE\n\nEucharia came into limelight for her role in the movie series Glamour Girls in 1994 and has gone on to star in over 90 movies including Abuja Connection and Letters to a Stranger. She is currently serving as an evangelist at a church in Egbeda, Lagos State.\n\nThe Nollywood veteran was ordained as a pastor at Fresh Oil Ministry International, Egbeda, Lagos in 2012.\n\nP.M. NEWS reliably gathered that Eucharia was officially ordained on Sunday, 5 February, 2012.\n\nThe ordination of Eucharia, who recently divorced her husband, was performed by Pastor Psalm Okpe, accompanied by other men of God present.\n\nSusan Peters, Clarion Chukwuka were among Euchariaâ€™s colleagues that graced the occasion.\n\nBefore her ordination UK Gold, as Eucharia is popularly called by fans, intimated her facebook friends about the occasion. Writing on her facebook page, she said: â€œDearly beloved, having been anointed last year, am now being officially ordained with ministerial licence and collar.\n\nGiving me the right to carry out episcopal duties as a minister of God under the fold of the ministry as an evangelist.

God is awesome\n\nSpeaking with New Telegraph, the Nollywood actress cum evangelist opened up on being a single mum and her greatest regrets. Anunobi said being a single mother was not a deliberate choice.\n\nShe said: “It was not a deliberate choice that I have made. It came by chance, it came by mistake. God does not kill His children who have made mistakes. He would rather sustain them and tell them that He is the owner of all things. The Lord has been sustaining me as a single parent. I don’t think about it, all I know is, ‘God, you are the one that created me and the child that you gave to me’. So whatever that is needed of me, it was a wrong choice that I made.” On whether she has made any attempt to reconcile with the father of her son, she said: “When somebody says that I do not want to be a responsible father, what do you do? You don’t take a horse to the river and force it to drink.”\n\nShe denied ever saying men were intimidated by her but noted that she was not in a relationship. I Regret Having A Son - Eucharia Anunobi She said: “I can’t remember ever saying such a thing. I don’t know about men being scared of me. Well, I will take it that what you are saying is that I’m not in a relationship. Of course, you know I would not want to discuss my private life. But I have to tell you what I am doing and what is not happening, I believe in things that are incubating; if it’s meant to come out, it will come out. A lot of people do not know of my commitment to my Christian life too.”\n\nOn her ideal man, she said every woman wishes to get married to a tall black and handsome man and she desires that as well. She added that her ideal man must be somebody who has the spirit of God.\n\nEucharia praying in church\n\nSOURCES: wikipedia.org,niaj.com,newtelegraph,takemetonaija.com\n\n↧\n\nFG Begins Online Registration Of Unemployed Nigerian Youths\n\nThe Federal government will today open a portal for the registration of unemployed Nigerians.\n\nThis disclosure was made by the Deputy Director, Information & Public Relations, National Directorate of Employment, NDE, Edmund Onwuliri, in Abuja.\n\nHe said the portal, www.jobsforall.ng will serve as a job exchange platform that will link job seekers and employers.\n\nHe added that the portal is in fulfillment of this administrations promise to reduce unemployment in the country.\n\nThe statement said, “The online portal which goes live today Wednesday April 5, 2017, is designed to capture the relevant details of any unemployed person.\n\n“It will equally serve as a job exchange portal that will link job seekers and employers.

This assurance was given by the National President, RIFAN, Aminu Goronyo, while speaking on the current development in the rice industry, which Goronyo disclosed that rice farmers under the association now have direct access to fertiliser. He said: “Fertiliser was a very big challenge, but today it has become a history. We have signed MoU where the fertiliser is sold N5, 500 per bag of fertiliser, and is now a government policy.\n\nWe have more fertiliser in the country and go direct to the hands of the farmers and is everywhere in the country. “We have already achieved rice sufficiency in the last two years because all the rice we eat is grown here in the country.\n\nWith the government through the Nigeria Customs Service on the land borders, including the high exchange rate no importer can go to other countries and import rice for profit. I assure you in the next three months a 50kg bag of rice will come down to N10, 000. “The Anchor Borrowers Scheme was conceived through collective effort by the Central Bank of Nigeria, RIFAN and other relevant key stakeholders, and we are everyday meeting with the CBN reviewing the process.” However, the rice farmers’ boss lamented inadequate rice seeds for his over 4.2 million registered members, which according to him said past governments, have failed to provide certified and quality seeds for over 30 years. “Seed is the most essential component of any commodity that is going to be produced. We do not have rice seeds in Nigeria.\n\nThe few companies we have in the country do not have the capacity to supply the quality and certified seeds we need. What we have is grossly inadequate and not up to one percent of the need by Nigerian farmers. “I blame the previous governments because for the 30 years we don’t have enough certified seeds.\n\nThe government has played vital role in creating this problem for the farmers. “The research centres are there and they are being paid but they are not doing what they are supposed to because government rely on them to come up with certified seeds, and we the end users, the farmers, we know that we are not getting then real certified seed. “Even the current Anchor Borrowers Scheme that is going on we are just managing seeds from few companies that rarely have certified seeds.\n\nMost of the seeds that are being supplied are from the companies that do not have all it takes, and we do not have other options than to use what they are giving to us. The seeds released are not up to five percent of our total requirement”, he stated.\n\n↧\n\n17-Year-Old Boy Builds Nigeria's First Locally made Drone (Photos)\n\nA talented 17-year-old identified as David Opateyibo has built up a locally-made drone which authorities in Lagos hope to deploy for security surveillance.\n\nThe drone, a high breed mix of existing drone components and locally fabricated material, seems to fly normally but David says there is a lot more room for improvement.\n\n“Aside from using drones for aerial surveillance, you can also use them for aerial photography and videography, or for broadcasting, incidence control or pipeline and power line inspection.

She is an alumna of the University of Port Harcourt where she earned her Bachelor and Master's degrees in Theatre Arts.\n\nShe started acting when she was seven years old.\"The journey has been fantastic, I’ve lost count of the number of movies I have done\" she says. Ironically, she was not one of those who faced challenges because she started acting when she was very young. By the time she was an adult, she was already a professional actor because she had gone to school to study Theatre Arts. \"It just came naturally. The challenges I face these days are based on the roles I play because each role comes differently. It has just been a beautiful journey. Even though there are bumps everywhere, you just have to go past them.\"she said.\n\nSHE SPEAKS ABOUT HER BACKGROUND BELOW:\n\n“I was born with a silver spoon, but death turned me poverty-stricken after my father died when I was just nine. I turned away from God at that point, because I felt disappointed that despite how much my father loved and served God, he still died.” She continued, “After my dad died, my mother completely lost her mind. If she were living in the US, I’m sure she would have been diagnosed as a mental case. You know, in Nigeria, we don’t consider people mad until they have started eating from dustbins. I rebelled against God at that point, and I stopped going to church at the age of nine. Hilda Dokubo Hilda Dokubo “However, I was a very brilliant girl, and I got admission into the university at the age of 16. I became rascally and did what girls like that do. I slept with a man, and I became pregnant. It wasn’t the Holy-Spirit that impregnated me. My mom was devastated and disappointed in me because of that. I was also angry with her because ‘her God’ killed my father, and we stopped speaking to each other. One day, a man came to me and said he needed a barge. I didn’t know what it was, and he told me it was used to store oil. I then recalled that I had once seen a barge in the compound opposite ours. I went to the neighbour and told him I needed the barge. He asked me what I needed it for, but I told him not to worry. I told them to put the barge in front of my mother’s house. At that point, the man who told me he needed the barge came back, and dropped sacks of money containing N2m with my mom because I was in school at that time. Two weeks later, he returned with N500,000, and I was dumbfounded. Before then, I had never seen N100,000 together, but there I was as a millionaire at 17, not knowing what to do with the money.\"\n\nCAREER AND LIFE\n\nDokubo made her screen debut during her youth service in a 1992 film titled Evil Passion. She has since been featured and has produced several Nigerian films. Upon starring in a supporting role in a 2015 film titled Stigma, Dokubo won Best Actress in a Supporting Role at the 11th Africa Movie Academy Awards\n\nPopular actress, Hilda Dokubo hasn’t been in the public glare for a while now. Even before she served as a Special Adviser on Youth Affairs to former Rivers State Governor, Peter Odili, she had rarely been seen in movies. But that does not diminish her status as a widely-loved Nollywood actress.\n\nShe has featured in several block-buster movies over the years that have won her millions of fans. Of particular fascination is the emotional way she plays her role. She cries easily on camera, and she can be said to be a method-actor, as her portrayal is graphic and distinct.\n\nDokubo was one of the principal organisers of the thanksgiving service of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), for the victory of Governor Nyesom Wike, at the Supreme Court, which affirmed him as validly elected governor of the oil-rich state?\n\nHilda seemed quite at home and enjoying what she was doing.\n\nWell, has Hilda kissed the screen bye for good? “No,” she said, “I’m back. Though as a pro­ducer for now, I will soon return\n\nSHE SPEAKS ABOUT HER CAREER AND RETURNING TO THE SCREEN:\n\nWhat have you been up to recently?\n\nI just finished a movie by Kunle Afolayan, and I’m working on another. I’m also writing a children’s book, and running a school. I’m just staying happy and excited. Kunle Afolayan’s The CEO is a beautiful work making waves at the moment. I worked with an awesome team, and the storyline was so simple but beautiful. I played the role of a superintendent of police who investigated some crimes. It was fantastic working with Kunle Afolayan.\n\nAre you working on a film of your own?\n\nYes, it is titled Asawana. It is a story of the strength of the young, and the experience of the old. It is a work that talks about collaboration and strength of women in communities.\n\nWhy did you take a break from Nollywood?\n\nActing is like my second life. If you say I left acting , it is like saying that I died. What happened was I felt like giving back to the society that has loved me so much. I chose to go back to work with communities, see and feel like real people. I’m not done doing community work, but this is my time to come back and share those experiences in my work. I never left Nollywood, it was just a small break which was worthwhile.\n\nYou went into politics at some point…\n\nI wanted to do something different and I wanted to give back to the society. I felt like my life was too monotonous. I was never in politics, I just held a political office. There is a huge difference between being a politician and holding a political office.\n\nCan you relate a bit of your experience as a special adviser?\n\nI am pleased with the little contribution I made. I did my thing as it came. Working with Governor Peter Odili, gave me a better understanding of government-related issues. It was a good training. I learnt a lot about administration and it gave me a platform to contribute to the development of young people.\n\nDo you intend going back to politics anytime soon?\n\nI really don’t know. If politics is what I see now, I have no interest. Nevertheless, if politics becomes a tool to contribute to the development of my people, then my answer is yes. I’m not sure I like what I see now.\n\nHilda and Son\n\nSOURCES: punchng.com, wikipedia.org,takemetonaija.com\n\n↧\n\nHow To Earn A Lot Online By Becoming a Successful Freelancer\n\nFreelancing has a romantic look about it for people who would rather be their own boss, but it also has its challenges- unless the freelancer knows how to land gigs and keep them coming, he or she could wind up being frustrated with the whole thing. It’s vital for anyone who wishes to go down the freelancing path to get their act together and plan for what could be a rollercoaster ride of the ebb and flow of business that this way entails.\n\nIf you intend to become a freelancer or are already launching into the sphere, you should start off by taking the following steps.\n\n1. Acquire relevant skills.\n\nOf course, you’re not going to be freelancing if you don’t have the expertise to do so. If you’re going to become a freelance programmer, you should know how to write code- it goes without saying. Depending on what you want to do, having a background in a formal establishment might be an advantage.\n\n2. Tell everyone you know.\n\nTell everyone you know- yes, everyone–that you’re planning to get into the freelancing business. Let them know what services you will be offering, and when you intend to begin doing so. What this does for you is open up fronts through which you can get valuable contacts and references. Your first clients might come from your contact list, or be someone who is led to you by someone you’ve told about your plans.\n\n3. Research the freelance turf for your area of expertise.\n\nIs there a market for your services? Be sure to research the availability of a market for what you have to offer. If you want to become a freelance writer, are there people and businesses where you are (or in the area you operate in) that need your content? If you run a business consulting service, are there companies that can do with your assistance in this respect? The viability of your freelance pursuits depends on whether there is a demand for your services.\n\n4. Have a plan detailing your charges, and other important things.\n\nHow much will you be charging your clients, and on what basis? How do you intend to land gigs? These questions should be answered before starting off on the freelance journey. You might also need a business plan which will serve as a financial resource blueprint for your work, something you’ll be able to refer to as a yardstick for measuring your progress as a freelancer.\n\n5. Build your personal brand.\n\nBusinesses need a brand to make them stand out. Because you’ll be setting out on your own, you will be your own brand. Let your online profile reflect the work you do, especially on social media. You can learn more about how to build your personal brand by reading the article Six Steps To Building Your Personal Brand.\n\n6. Display your work.\n\nTalk about the work you do on social media, and display samples (if it’s the kind that allows for this). Have a portfolio that includes the sort of service you specialize in delivering, so you can refer to it when you are trying to get a potential client on board. If you’re a writer or designer for instance, you can have a personal blog that showcases these things. It’ll serve as a convenient means for people to have a look at what you do.\n\n7. Keep tabs on your figures.\n\nWhatever you do, just be certain that you know what your business figures are. Take more than a cursory look at your revenue figures; examine them in detail to see where your revenue is coming from, so you have an idea of what the trend really is, and what aspects of your business you should be building or improving. If you run a website, find out where the traffic comes from, and think about how you can use the information you obtain from the analytics to better what you do.\n\nFinally, don’t neglect the need to be plain and honest in your dealings with your clients- your reputation can be built on your transparency, or marred by your untrustworthiness.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nFacts You Should Know: Are You Helping or Hurting Your Heart? Check This\n\nThe heart is the body’s most important organ. When the heart stops… it’s over.\n\nAn extremely hard worker, the heart pumps about 23,000 liters of blood around the body, and beats an estimated 100,000 times each day- no breaks or vacations!\n\nAs such, we should be doing everything in our power to help our hearts do their job, instead of making it more difficult with poor habits and lifestyles.\n\nHere are a few things you should know about your heart:\n\n1. Eating too much salt raises your blood pressure, putting extra strain on the arteries leading to the heart and damaging them over time. Reducing the sodium in your diet is best for your heart. Adults should consume no more than 6g of salt per day. Most of the sodium we consume comes from processed foods, so always check labels.\n\n2. Eating just two bananas in a day can lower your blood pressure by 10%. This is thanks to the potassium in bananas, which helps your body reduce its sodium levels.\n\n3. Women become more susceptible to heart disease in menopause and are four times more likely to die from heart disease than from breast cancer.\n\n4. If you’re overweight, reducing your weight by just 10% percent will lower your risk of dying from heart disease by a whopping 20%!\n\n5. Excess weight around your waist puts you at greater risk of heart disease than bum or thigh fat. As a man, your waist should measure no more than 1m. For women, any measurement beyond 89cm is dangerous.\n\n6. There’s a very important reason cigarette ads include warnings from the Federal Ministry of Health like “Tobacco smoking is dangerous to health” and “Smokers are liable to die young”. Death resulting from coronary heart disease is 50% higher in smokers than in those who do not smoke.\n\n7. Living with a smoker can increase your risk of heart disease by 23%, even when you’re a nonsmoker.\n\n8. The importance of exercise to heart health cannot be overemphasized. Just 30 minutes of moderate exercise 5 times a week can help keep your heart strong and reduce your risk of heart disease by 20%.\n\n9. Omega-3 fatty acids are great for heart health as they reduce excess levels of blood fats, prevent clots in the arteries, and help keep your heartbeat regular. Our bodies don’t produce Omega-3, so you need to include them in your diet by incorporating lots of oily fish like mackerel, salmon, and Titus fish. You can also buy Omega-3 supplements.\n\n10. Eating 5 portions of fruit and vegetables daily reduces your risk of heart disease by 30%. Now that’s huge!\n\nRemember, one heart attack can permanently damage a heart, so once you hit 40 you should see a doctor for a heart health assessment. If you have any risk factors like diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol, don’t wait till then. The same goes for people with a strong family history of heart disease. Have your heart checked right away, and be sure to adhere to your doctor’s instructions.\n\n↧\n\n5 Popular Traditional Dances From Eastern Nigeria\n\nWhether it’s celebratory, energizing, cathartic, funny, or just plain embarrassing, dance is one of the best art forms for expression. People gyrate in order to celebrate, commemorate or even to prepare for some ritual.\n\nHistoric and traditional dance goes back hundreds and even thousands of years. Nigeria has the treasure of a variety of folk and tribal dances in regions across the country. The eastern region, which consist mostly of the Igbo tribe, have a list of traditional dances performed as a form of emotional expression, social interaction, or exercise, in a spiritual or performance setting, and these dances are sometimes used to express ideas or tell a story.\n\nWhen visiting the Eastern parts of Nigeria, check out Jovago’s list of top 5 local dances for some inspiration!\n\nIkpirikpi-ogu (War dance)\n\nCommonly associated with the people of Abam in Arochukwu LGA, Abia State, Nigeria,Ikpirikpi-ogu is a dance of warriors. Originally performed to welcome soldiers back from tribal wars, it exudes an air of valor and is strictly performed by men. Today it’s purely symbolical to show the strength of a community and its conquest over collective challenges. It is performed at key festivals and community events.\n\nAtilogwu (Acrobatic Dance)\n\nThis is very similar to performances by cheerleaders in today’s western world. It is known as the ‘Acrobatic Dance” as it requires a lot of quick movements and calisthenics. It is mainly performed by the youth for entertainment at ceremonies or other events.\n\nNkwa umu-Agbogho (the Maiden dance)\n\nIn a bid to attract suitors, this dance which involves rhythmic movements of the chest and waist, was performed by maidens who had come of age and were set to marry. It was a key aspect of the Igbo culture and was used to foster abstinence from sexual activities before marriage. In recent times, it is performed as a form of entertainment by young ladies with supple bodies.\n\nOmuru-onwa and Agbacha-ekuru-nwa\n\nThis dance strictly performed by married women, generally involves responsive movement of the body, in a rhythmic fashion to hip-swinging music. Married women and new mothers used such entertaining opportunities to exercise, lose weight, shed baby-fats and stay healthy through weekly rehearsals.\n\nMmanwu (masquerades)\n\nPossibly the most popular dance in the Igbo culture, Mmanwu is celebrated across the entire Igbo landscape. In the ancient times, masquerades were seen as sacred as they either represented deities or were messengers sent by deities to deliver judgments or penalties on otherwise powerful people.

Anyone who has grown in Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana and other parts of central and West Africa has come across palm wine. Palm wine is good for our health, if only we drink pure palm wine. This is because preservatives and sweeteners are added to it in order to extend its shelf life, which makes it not good for our health.\n\nWhen palm wine is tapped, it is fresh and sweet but in 24 hours, it can become sharp and sour, and contain more alcohol than some of our alcoholic drinks. This is because the palm wine undergoes fermentation. Palm wine has benefits when consumed fresh or fermented, but the most benefits are gotten when it is consumed fresh.\n\nIn Cameroon and Nigeria, the process of tapping palm wine from palm trees is called palm wine tapping. A palm wine tapper climbs the palm tree with a rope that is locally designed for that purpose. He also climbs the palm tree with a cutlass, a knife and a gallon or calabash. When the tapper climbs the tree to the top, he will cut some palm branches to expose the tissue and use the knife to create a hole in the tree. A hollow bamboo or empty pipe is used to direct the sap into a gallon which is tied around the tree.\n\nContents of palm wine\n\nThe following are found in palm wine\n\nSugar\n\nProtein\n\nCarbohydrate,\n\nAmino acid\n\nVitamin C\n\nYeast\n\nBacteria\n\nPotassium\n\nZinc\n\nMagnesium\n\nIron\n\nVitamin B1,B2 B3 and B6\n\nHealth benefits of Palm wine\n\n1 Palm wine improves eyesight\n\nPalm wine helps in maintaining good eye health. This is because it contains the antioxidant Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) which is also found in other fruits and vegetables. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) also helps in improving our vision. This is why some school of thought argue that our grandparents in the village have better eyesight than us because palm wine is their beverage.\n\n2 Reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases\n\nResearch has showed that drinking moderate amounts of palm wine has been associated with a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure. This study was conducted by Lingberg and Ezra in 2008. Palm wine contains potassium which has been proven by research to improve heart health and bring down hypertension. However drinking it in excess has adverse effects like destroying the liver.\n\n3 Palm wine can help fight against cancer\n\nPalm wine contains vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin. Riboflavin is an antioxidant which helps in the fight against some cancer causing agents called free radicals.\n\n4 Palm wine helps in maintaining a healthy hair, skin and nails\n\nThe Iron and vitamin B complex found in palm wine are needed for a healthy skin, hair and nail. Iron is very essential for the development, growth and functioning of some cells in our body. This property of palm wine makes it helpful in promoting wound healing by repairing our tissues and promoting the growth of healthy cells.\n\n5 Palm wine promotes lactation\n\nPalm wine is being used by many natural healers in Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana and other parts of Africa to help a lactating mother when she has limited breast milk production. Research is needed to investigate the property of palm wine that makes it stimulate the production of breast milk.\n\nPrecautions\n\nDo not drink fermented palm wine in excess. Fermented palm wine in excess is detrimental to our health. Fermented palm wine is locally referred to as “strong white mimbo” Fermented palm wine contains a high percentage of alcohol, which is probably higher than that found in some of the alcoholic beverages we drink. This fermented palm wine destroys our kidney, liver and other systems in our body. Drinking alcohol in excess is a risk factor for hypertension.\n\n↧\n\nWomen: 7 Things To Avoid During Your Menstrual Cycle\n\nEvery woman that has attained the age of puberty is bound to experience monthly discharge of blood from the female reproductive organ, lasting through a period of 3-7 days, depending on the individual.\n\nWhile this lasts, the body requires special care and attention, as this period is usually accompanied with mood swings and discomfort. To enjoy maximum comfort during your cycle, below are seven things you must avoid.\n\nConsuming dairy products\n\nDairy products like milk, yoghurt and cheese are good sources of calcium and you need calcium during your cycle. However, you should take minimal or completely avoid dairy products during your cycle because they contain an acid called arachidonic acid that can cause more cramping and bloating in the lower abdomen. Green vegetables, fish and bone meals are good alternative sources of calcium.\n\nGoing to bed without a tampon or sanitary pads\n\nDo not risk going to bed without protection, with the assumption that your flow would be light. You might end up making a mess of your night wear, sheets and bed.\n\nLess or no protection towards end of cycle\n\nThe menstrual flow is relatively lighter as the cycle draws to close. However, you should avoid going out without wearing protection as it could be unpredictable. If you feel uncomfortable wearing tampons or pads, you could use a panty liner towards the end of your cycle.\n\nUsing dark coloured or rubbery underwear\n\nDark colours are good conductors of heat. Your pubic area should be free of moisture and heat during your cycle. Light coloured cotton underwears are advisable as they provide more comfort.\n\nWearing white pants\n\nWhile bright coloured underwear is advised, it could land you in an embarrassing situation. This is particularly for ladies with heavy flow. A dark coloured pant would relatively conceal stains on pants compared to a white underpant.\n\nGoing out without a spare pad and underwear\n\nLife is all about risks but you don’t want to risk the world seeing a pool or stain of menstrual red on your body. Always go out with a spare pad, tampon and underwear in case you need to change.\n\nUsing the same sanitary piece for an extensive period\n\nDo not use your sanitary pad for more than six hours even if the boxes of pads or tampons say you could go eight hours straight.\n\nProlonged use of sanitary pads or tampons can lead to bacterial infection, cause bad odour and impair comfort.\n\n↧\n\nBBNaija Revelations: Bisola Is Not A Graduate, Bally’s Girlfriend Was Upset He Kissed Housemates, more....\n\nBisola, one of the last five housemates of the BBNaija show has disclosed that she is not a university graduate while canvassing for votes to win the ultimate prize.\n\nOn Thursday night, the remaining five housemates currently fighting for the ultimate prize were given an opportunity to campaign for votes in preparation for the grand finale on Sunday.\n\nOn the sidelines of that, while begging Nigerians to vote for her, Bisola the multi-talented entertainer surprisingly revealed her educational status disclosing that she has not attended a higher institution. Hear her:\n\n“My name Bisola is ‘born into wealth’ but I have not enjoyed wealth. Because I remember since I was seven years old I usually had a complex life but I try as much as possible not to allow the complex life take over the situations I am in.\n\n“I have never been in University before. I’m not a graduate. So sometimes I’m somehow envious when I hear fellow housemate talk stuff like ‘ when I did this in school or when I did that in school’.\n\n“Not because I wasn’t intelligent enough to be in but because I never had the funds to do so. So when every exam is passed I never made it through because I didn’t have the money to send myself to school.”\n\nMeanwhile, former housemate Bally, who was evicted last Sunday during the final eviction show has also revealed that his girlfriend was upset with him for kissing in the house.\n\nAdmitting that he was the least housemate expected to progress in the show, Bally claims he was Bisola’s victim after Thin Tall Tony left the reality TV show.\n\nIn a video interview with Ikeji Linda, Bally said his relationship with Bisola was not a romantic one, adding that the show had some friendship plays and nothing more. Hear him:\n\n“I had a cordial and friendly relationship with Bisola, not a romantic one. There were no real romantic relationships involved. It was just friendly play, and you know Bisola, she’s just a playful person, trouble maker basically.\n\n“Before Thin Tall left the house, he was that person she was always going to disturb. She was always with Tony and I had no problem with that. After he left, she decided to make me her victim of troublemaking.”\n\n“Yes I have. She was actually the first person I spoke to when I left the house, Obviously. We’re cool, she’s cool, she’s very well.”\n\n“Obviously, she knows what the show is about. At the end of the day, it’s for the greater good. I’m in the entertainment business and this is an extremely great platform to go with. To be honest, I didn’t anticipate all the things that happened in the house.\n\n“It just happened and she probably didn’t also. She was a bit upset about one or two things in the house… like the kissing was quite a lot, I’m not going to lie. Obviously, that would tend to get you.\n\n“Watching your boyfriend do things like that but at the end of the day, she’s a very understanding person. We’ve spoken through it and we are in that phase of getting back to be very cool with each other.”\n\n↧"
