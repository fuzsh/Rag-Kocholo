        "text": "ARGONNE NATIONAL LAB.\n\nIn 1988, the news that Emeagwali had performed the world's fastest computation had spread over the Internet. Although some people were skeptical, participants at this institute discussed his work and believed his results and even predicted that he should win the Gordon Bell Prize.\n\nDETAILS...\n\nTOP COMPUTING PRIZE\n\nThe predictions came true and Emeagwali won the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize. Dale and Philip at the award ceremony and banquet. February 28, 1990 at San Francisco, California.\n\n\"Philip Emeagwali, who took on an enormously difficult problem and, like most students working on Ph.D. dissertations, solved it alone, has won computation's top prize, captured in the past only by seasoned research teams.\" Reported by Judith Axler Turner for the June 27, 1990 issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nDETAILS...\n\nTOP SUPERCOMPUTER AWARD\n\n\"U-M grad student Philip Emeagwali has won the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize Competition, which is considered the annual high point of supercomputer research. With his petroleum reservoir simulation, Emeagwali became the first sole investigator to win the prize.\"\n\nFrom the Computing News, (a University of Michigan publication) April 16, 1990\n\nDETAILS...\n\nGORDON BELL PRIZE\n\n\"Philip Emeagwali wins 1989 Gordon Bell Supercomputing Prize.\" By Lisa Mooney for Michigan Engineer, (a University of Michigan publication) Spring 1990\n\nDETAILS...\n\nCOMPUTING OFFICE\n\n\"Quietly working in a U-M lab, grad student Philip Emeagwali has pulled off a prize-winning feat in supercomputing.\" Steve Eisenberg reports for the April 26, 1990 issue of the Ann Arbor News (Michigan, USA).\n\n...\n\nCOMPUTER LAB\n\n\"Philip Emeagwali, a doctoral student in the U-M College of Engineering, was awarded the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for supercomputing research.\"\n\nDETAILS...\n\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\n\n\"When Philip Emeagwali was a child in Nigeria, his classmates thought he was a genius. Today, much of the academic and computer science community would agree.\n\nIn February, he won the prestigious 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for programming supercomputers to work faster than ever before and for helping to solve one of the nation's toughest oil recovery problems. Even more impressive, in a field in which most breakthroughs are a collaborative effort, the 35-year-old University of Michigan doctoral candidate did it on his own.\"\n\nSharon Walker Rose reports for the May 29, 1990 issue of the Detroit Free Press.\n\nDETAILS...\n\nTHE CHICKEN AND OX\n\n\"There's a supercomputing race between --- The Chickens and the Ox. The cart pulled by the ox represents a conventional supercomputer. Intuition might lead one to think that the bull can outperform the cart pulled by a multitude of well-trained, harnessed chickens. But the coordination of many smaller units results in better performance. Similarly, a massively parallel computer is faster and more powerful than a conventional supercomputer.\"\n\nThe U-M invited Philip Emeagwali to share the highlights of his doctoral dissertation in three essays that were mailed to 400,000 alumni of the University of Michigan. This is the first time (in 160 years) that a graduate student was so honored by having a special issue of the university's flagship publication devoted to his research.\n\nDETAILS...\n\nCAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS\n\nPhilip Emeagwali with the Connection Machine in the background.

Computing twice as fast would be impressive; ten times faster would be even more impressive.\n\nPhilip Emeagwali, a doctoral candidate in scientific computing in the College of Engineering and the 1989 recipient of the Gordon Bell Prize for his supercomputing research, has increased the speed of a massively parallel supercomputer to as much as 1,000 times faster than a mainframe computer and 1,000,000 times faster than a personal computer.\"\n\nExcerpted from the February 1991 issue of Michigan Today, the flagship quarterly publication of the University of Michigan (mailed to 400,000 alumni).\n\nDETAILS...\n\nUNIV. OF MINNESOTA\n\nIn August 1991, Emeagwali gave an invited lecture at the University of Minnesota. Discussing his work with mathematicians from the University of Minnesota (center) and University of Southern California (right).\n\nDETAILS...\n\nUNIV. OF MINNESOTA\n\nIn 1991, Emeagwali moved from Michigan to Minnesota. Students that attended his lecture on supercomputing at the University of Minnesota visit him at his home in Saint Paul (July 1992). These students were selected from a nationwide competition.
