        "text": "WORLD RENOWNED SCIENTIST INVENTOR\n\nNigeria 1954\n\nPhilip Emeagwali’s is the First African to get a Ph.D. in Mathematics. His determination to succeed grew out of a life born into poverty and little formal education. His passion for mathematics cause him to become a master of the laws of phsics and astronomy. Dr. Emeagwali won the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers’ Gordon Bell Prize in 1989 for an experiment that used 65,000 processors to perform the world’s fastest computation of 3.1 billion calculations per second.\n\nDr. Philip Emeagwali designed the program and formula for the fastest computer on earth, the Connection Machine. He designed the system of parallel computers that are used by all search engines. The parallel computer idea was also worked on by individuals such as Burton Smith and Daniel Hillis.\n\nThe Connection Machine with a program developed by Philip Emeagwali solved a 350 year old packing problem that was considered to be one of the great unsolved mathematics problems. The Connection Machine and Mr. Emeagwali also designed equations to explain how sperm swim, how polluted groundwater flows, how the Earth’s interior moves and causes volcanic eruptions, and the procedure for quick recovery of petroleum safer and in larger quantities.\n\nFinally Philip Emeagwali designed the Hyperball computer which is able to forecast long-term global warming patter\n\n1 comment"
