        "text": "Black History Month Profile (Day 25)(1 of 3):Philip Emeagwali (August 23,1954) is a Nigerian computer scientist. He has been living in the United States for many years. An Igbo, he won the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize ($1,000) for price-performance in high-performance computing applications, in an oil reservoir modeling calculation using a novel mathematical formulation and implementation. He is known to possess an IQ of 190.His early schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study.He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a correspondence course at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He won in the \"price/performance\" category, with a performance figure of about 400 Mflops/$1M. The winner in the \"performance\" category, Mobil Research and Thinking Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500 Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.His method involved each microprocessor communicating with six neighbours.Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir modeling."
