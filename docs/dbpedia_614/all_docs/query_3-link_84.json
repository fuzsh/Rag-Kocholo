        "text": "Phillip Emeagwali, one of the greatest African and Nigerian singled for special mention by former president Bill Clinton of the United States of America has been described a \"fraud\" and creation of the media.\n\nThe tackle on Emeagwali who has since become a powerful role model for young people is not coming from outside, it is from his countrymen who have set up two blogsites http://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/inventions/emeag.html and http://www.nairaland.com/nigeria/topic-19285.0.html to debunk claims by the computer genius.\n\ninvestigation revealed that critics have described some Emeagwali’s myths as mere showmanship and since the questions on his achievements in 2005, there has been no further details from the super whizkid.\n\nOne Chioma Ezeilo went as far as describing the whizkid achievements as \"outright lies, half-truths, and numerous unsubstantiated claims\"\n\nEmeagwali, a rare gem but not to the critics who wants to know who named him as one of the fathers of the Internet.\n\nThe criticisms notwithstanding, he made the Time, respected international magazine’s list of some of the hidden contributions to society by African-Americans in 2007 and he is well sought after speaker in many international conferences.\n\nhttp://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/inventions/emeag.html do not agree that Emeagwali made the \"world’s fastest computation\" in 1989\n\nAccording to it \"despite what you may have read on the Internet, the 1989 prize for the fastest performance was awarded not to Emeagwali, but to another entrant\"\n\n\"In spite of efforts by Emeagwali and his admirers to hype up his $1000 Gordon Bell award as the \"Nobel Prize\" of computing, the rest of the computing world continues to associate that lofty label with the Turing Award, which Emeagwali has never won. The Gordon Bell prize, however, is just one of many other annual computing awards, respectable but not at all comparable to either the Nobel Prize or the Turing Award in prestige or prize money. Nor are the selection criteria analogous: Emeagwali was awarded for his performance in an annual competition, not in recognition of lasting contributions to his field\"\n\nThey also questioned Emeagwali’s paternity claims to the Internet adding that he has not shown any evidence that he was involved with ARPA or any other research organization or company connected with the genesis of the Internet, nor did he express his ideas in technical journals or any other channel through which he could have influenced the development of the Internet during its formative stages.\n\n\"A few Web sources expand the fallacy that Emeagwali created the fastest computer programme, insisting that he was also responsible for the massively parallel supercomputer on which the program ran. However, the 65,000-processor \"Connection Machine\" that allowed such speedy computations was actually the brainchild of Danny Hillis and was built by Thinking Machines Corporation, the company Hillis co-founded. The fact is extensively documented on the web and is so well established that I won’t devote more attention to it\" the blogsite also alleged\n\nIt said that Emeagwali who is frequently referred to on his own and other websites as \"Dr. Philip Emeagwali\" or simply \"Dr. Emeagwali\" did not get the degree after failing his qualification examinations twice and having his thesis rejected by a committee of faculty members.\n\nIt went to say that Emeagwali subsequently sued the university, alleging civil rights violations and racial discrimination. His case was dismissed without trial. When Emeagwali appealed to a higher court, a three-judge panel rejected his discrimination claims unanimously.\n\nNigeria CommunicationsWeek\n\nALX Nigeria, a tech and career accelerator for young people, has secured a series of outstanding achievements over the past six months. These milestones show ALX’s commitment to youths nationwide through cutting-edge tech and career development programmes.\n\nFrom January to June of 2024, ALX Nigeria received an unprecedented 233,310 applications, reflecting the growing demand for quality tech learning and career advancement opportunities in Nigeria. Applicants trust ALX Nigeria’s programmes and the impact of its mission to democratise access to world-class tech learning.\n\nAlso during this six month period, over an estimate of 12,000 learners across the states in Nigeria completed ALX Nigeria’s programs; equipping them with the tech skills and knowledge needed to thrive in today’s competitive job market.\n\nIn recognition of its exceptional contributions to tech learning, ALX Nigeria received the Edtech Company of the Year award from the prestigious GAGE Awards. ALX Nigeria also emerged winner of the Tech Unite Africa Award for Excellence, given by Tech Unite Africa as the Online Learning Platform of the Year.\n\nALX Nigeria was also recently recognized at the Titans of Tech Awards as the Most Innovative EdTech Company of the Year, making the fourth award in nine months.\n\nRuby Igwe, General Manager, Sand Technologies and ALX Nigeria stated, “As we celebrate these remarkable milestones, ALX remains steadfast in its commitment to innovation, excellence, and inclusivity. We are poised to continue the growth trajectory, expanding our reach and impact in the coming months.\n\n“With our focus on emerging technologies, industry partnerships, and learner-centric approaches, we do not doubt that we are well-positioned to shape the future of tech and workforce development across Nigeria.”\n\nSeun Babajide-Duroshola further emphasized, “We are incredibly proud of our achievements over the past six months. We are committed to continuing our mission of providing world-class tech and career programs and empowering individuals to achieve their dreams.\n\n“We also have a strong emphasis on inclusion, community engagement and social responsibility through partnerships with different NGOs, schools, universities and community groups to provide resources and support to underserved populations.”\n\nLeo Stan Ekeh Foundation (LSEF) Centre at Imo State University Owerri, inaugurated four months ago with state-of-the-art technology infrastructure by Africa’s leading tech icon (Forbes) Mr. Leo Stan Ekeh, recently empowered its first batch of 200 aspiring entrepreneurs.\n\nThe centre distributed free cutting edge Zinox Tablet PCs and provided cash incentives to each participant, fostering their entrepreneurial journey. Upon completing the training, the top-performing students will receive interest-free loans of at least N1,000,000 to launch their own businesses, and some shall secure quality employment at structured corporates.\n\nAccording to the Director of the Centre, Dr. Gloria Chimeziem Ernest Samuel, “The 200 students have enjoyed and are still enjoying the privilege of being taught by different successful entrepreneurs, both locally and from the United States of America, on 21st century practical strategies and tacts to succeed in today’s highly competitive world.\n\n“We have the best satellite technology to receive lectures from various parts of the world. As the Chairman of Zinox would always say, knowledge is influence in the 21st century, and that is the core of the foundation and the centre.\n\n“We are tooling a new breed of aspiring entrepreneurs who will confront the business world with confidence.”\n\nSpeaking further on the Entrepreneurship Boost Program of the Centre, Dr. Gloria observes that “it has been exciting times for these aspiring Entrepreneurs as they are learning from the best in different sectors and we expect them to become great pride to the centre, be they employers or employees. In today’s world, quality employees are also Entrepreneurs and that is why they are able to deliver great dividends.\n\nThey enjoyed intensive training on Modern Etiquette, Entrepreneurship, Business Law, Career Planning, Accounting for non-accountants, E-commerce and Artificial intelligence, and God and Wealth in the 21st century, among other topics.\n\nShe revealed that some of the guest lecturers include George Emetuche (The Selling Champion), Profs Mike Ndugbu, Vincent Onodugo, Oby Nnamocha, Drs Chioma Anuebunwa (US), Leonard Amaefula, Peters Ihejirika, and Chris Anukam. Some top corporate executives, like Lady Chioma Nwoke, Dave Omorogie, Mezie Emelonye, and Chief Jerry Chukwueke, among others, are on the list to further train them as the program enters the final month before graduation."
