        "text": "Phillip Emeagwali, one of the greatest African and Nigerian singled for special mention by former president Bill Clinton of the United States of America has been described a \"fraud\" and creation of the media.\n\nThe tackle on Emeagwali who has since become a powerful role model for young people is not coming from outside, it is from his countrymen who have set up two blogsites http://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/inventions/emeag.html and http://www.nairaland.com/nigeria/topic-19285.0.html to debunk claims by the computer genius.\n\ninvestigation revealed that critics have described some Emeagwali’s myths as mere showmanship and since the questions on his achievements in 2005, there has been no further details from the super whizkid.\n\nOne Chioma Ezeilo went as far as describing the whizkid achievements as \"outright lies, half-truths, and numerous unsubstantiated claims\"\n\nEmeagwali, a rare gem but not to the critics who wants to know who named him as one of the fathers of the Internet.\n\nThe criticisms notwithstanding, he made the Time, respected international magazine’s list of some of the hidden contributions to society by African-Americans in 2007 and he is well sought after speaker in many international conferences.\n\nhttp://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/inventions/emeag.html do not agree that Emeagwali made the \"world’s fastest computation\" in 1989\n\nAccording to it \"despite what you may have read on the Internet, the 1989 prize for the fastest performance was awarded not to Emeagwali, but to another entrant\"\n\n\"In spite of efforts by Emeagwali and his admirers to hype up his $1000 Gordon Bell award as the \"Nobel Prize\" of computing, the rest of the computing world continues to associate that lofty label with the Turing Award, which Emeagwali has never won. The Gordon Bell prize, however, is just one of many other annual computing awards, respectable but not at all comparable to either the Nobel Prize or the Turing Award in prestige or prize money. Nor are the selection criteria analogous: Emeagwali was awarded for his performance in an annual competition, not in recognition of lasting contributions to his field\"\n\nThey also questioned Emeagwali’s paternity claims to the Internet adding that he has not shown any evidence that he was involved with ARPA or any other research organization or company connected with the genesis of the Internet, nor did he express his ideas in technical journals or any other channel through which he could have influenced the development of the Internet during its formative stages.\n\n\"A few Web sources expand the fallacy that Emeagwali created the fastest computer programme, insisting that he was also responsible for the massively parallel supercomputer on which the program ran. However, the 65,000-processor \"Connection Machine\" that allowed such speedy computations was actually the brainchild of Danny Hillis and was built by Thinking Machines Corporation, the company Hillis co-founded. The fact is extensively documented on the web and is so well established that I won’t devote more attention to it\" the blogsite also alleged\n\nIt said that Emeagwali who is frequently referred to on his own and other websites as \"Dr. Philip Emeagwali\" or simply \"Dr. Emeagwali\" did not get the degree after failing his qualification examinations twice and having his thesis rejected by a committee of faculty members.\n\nIt went to say that Emeagwali subsequently sued the university, alleging civil rights violations and racial discrimination. His case was dismissed without trial. When Emeagwali appealed to a higher court, a three-judge panel rejected his discrimination claims unanimously.\n\nNigeria CommunicationsWeek\n\nGuild of Corporate Online Publishers (GOCOP) has condemned, in very strong terms, the serial attacks on journalists covering the #EndBadGovernance nationwide protest, describing the act as undemocratic and repressive.\n\nGOCOP noted that journalists are partners in national development as well as critical stakeholders in the advancement of democracy and civil liberties and therefore deserve to be protected, and not suppressed as the security agents tried to do during the protest.\n\nThe body of online publishers specifically called on relevant authorities in Nigeria, especially security agencies, to see journalists as partners and voices of the voiceless rather than treat them as meddlesome interlopers and enemies of the people.\n\nCiting growing harassment of journalists including the denial of their fundamental right to life in the course of discharging their duties, GOCOP appealed to Nigerian security agencies to ensure the safety of all journalists especially during protests, riots and elections.\n\nGOCOP said the media has the capacity to support peace and reconciliation processes among political actors, between leaders and their followers and among the various ethnic nationalities in the country, hence should be allowed to play its constitutional role.\n\nAggregating statistics from various media reports, GOCOP said over 30 journalists had been attacked across the country during the protest which commenced on August 1.\n\nMedia houses which have had their staffers attacked with their tools (phones and cameras either seized or destroyed) include Premium Times, Daily Independent, Punch, TVC News, Guardian, Pointer newspaper, among others.\n\nGOCOP acknowledged the right of citizens to protest but cautions that on no account should any protest go beyond the bounds of peace and turn violent thereby creating opportunity for looters and hoodlums to hijack what was intended to be a peaceful show of anger against bad governance.\n\nWhile GOCOP condemned the violence that attended the protests in some parts of the country, it urges the security agencies to investigate, arrest and prosecute those found culpable in visiting mayhem and destruction on the nation and the citizenry.\n\nGOCOP also strongly condemned the subversive actions of some disgruntled Nigerians in cahoots with foreigners who during the protest sewed, distributed and flew Russian flags in some states and called for unconstitutional change of government.\n\nGOCOP sees such act as not only subversive but a direct affront on the sovereignty of the nation.\n\nIt called on the Federal Government to ensure the diligent prosecution of those involved in such act that impugns the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Nigeria.\n\nGOCOP appealed to President Bola Tinubu who for most part of his life championed the cause of democracy and independence of the media to prevail on the Service Chiefs and the Inspector General of Police to stop forthwith any form of harassment, intimidation, attack and arrest of journalists legitimately discharging their constitutionally assigned duties.\n\nMedia suppression does not only project Nigeria in bad light, it portrays the Tinubu government as a dictatorship in a democracy.\n\nGOCOP urged journalists to remain steadfast in the discharge of their duties by operating within the ambit of professionalism, fairness and factuality.\n\nShell Companies in Nigeria (SCiN) won the coveted Best Exhibitor award at the 2024 Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) held in Lagos recently, in addition to seven trophies won by employees.\n\nThe Shell exhibition combined educative posters with learning sessions for engineering students as well as free medical services where hundreds of conference participants received check-up and drugs.\n\nTerry Palisch, SPE International President and Salahudeen Tahir, Chairman of the Nigeria Council who jointly presented the award described Shell as a leading light in the oil and gas industry, providing valuable support particularly to indigenous companies.\n\nOladipo Ashafa, Asset Development and Subsurface Manager for the Shell Petroleum Development Company, and the Shell team received the award on behalf of SCiN.\n\nAshafa said the award was “a reward for professional & technical excellence.” He added: “We recognise that, being an industry leader, puts on us enormous responsibility and we have continued to rethink and reshape our strategies in a manner that brings optimal value to Nigeria, our partners and the local service industry.”\n\nFor the individual categories, Ngozi Okonkwo won the Bernard Oboarekpe Drilling & Completions Award and Best New Member Recruiter; Olalekan Balogun won the Prof. Michael Onyekonwu Reservoir Description and Dynamics Award; Femi Obakhena won the ‘Prof. Chi Ikoku Production and Operations Award; Oladipo Ashafa won the 2024 Industry Young Executive Award and Chairman’s Medallion and Magdalene Umoh who was the 2024 Conference Chairman also got the Chairman’s Medallion.\n\nElohor Aiboni , SNEPCo Managing Director, congratulated the Shell team for the successful participation, and thanked SPE for “providing a platform for companies to showcase their contributions to the industry and for professionals to exchange ideas.”\n\nEarlier this year, Shell companies in Nigeria emerged Best Exhibitor at the 7th edition of the Nigeria International Energy Summit in Abuja, and also took home the International Oil Company of the Year 2024 Award at the 8th Sub-Saharan Africa International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (SAIPEC) in Lagos organised by the Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria (PETAN)."
