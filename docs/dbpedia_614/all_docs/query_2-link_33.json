        "text": "The most disturbing thing to me is that Philip Emeagwali had the audacity to place my photo\n\nnext to his- by cut ‘n paste wizardry- to make the fraudulent claim that I was his wife. I stumbled on a newspaper that\n\ninnocently bought into the lie and was able to get an apology from the editors.\n\nFor the last few years I have had a disclaimer on my website at:\n\nwww.africahistory.net\n\nWhat a jerk! What a fraudster! He should be stopped.\n\nProfessor Gloria T. Emeagwali\n\nProf of History and African Studies\n\nMoses,\n\nLong ago, I bought a drug after seeing what I thought then was a convincing interview of a medical practitioner on 1000 secrets that medical doctors do not want you to know. I got sick from using the drug and shared my story with a friend at Wisconsin, Madison, who told me he also bought the same drug I was describing and went on to explain that those guys, although they perpetrate their crimes in broad day light on TV, are actually charlatans!!! We cannot stop commenting on the tabloids each time we are at a store, and the blatant lies they peddle about the high-ups. Emeagwali belongs to a broader culture of self promotion and aggrandizement...; (remember Hillary Clinton’s story about coming under fire during her trip to the Czech Republic, or something?) My question is why this society has allowed that culture to thrive as if it is a normal part of society? The usual explanation is that law enforcement have better things to do than go after these folks but I increasingly begin to think that there is a genius in allowing these incredulous claims a space…. What do you think?\n\nBode\n\nIf I might add, isn’t all the stories we grew up with about the tortoise both a simultaneous denunciation and celebration of fraud? In fact, the celebratory aspect of some of these stories far outweigh the so-called disapproval. In essence, you are right that “[societies] sometimes do not seem to know when to draw a line between outright fraud and fraudulent enterprise.” It may very well be that they have discovered that there is no line to be drawn between genius and fraud, and that itself is genius!!!\n\n“Did Philip Emeagwali claim someone as his wife? Where is the evidence.”\n\n- Franklyne Ogbunwezeh\n\nFranklyne:\n\nDid you actually read Gloria Emeagwali’s email below, which says in-part the following?\n\n“…Philip Emeagwali had the audacity to place my photo next to his- by cut ‘n paste wizardry- to make the fraudulent claim that I was his wife.”\n\nWhile reasonable people can argue about some aspects of Phlip Emagwali’s (bogus) claims, “water don pass garri” in this case. I beg, make you no defend the indefensible –oh.\n\nRegards,\n\nOkey Ukaga\n\nDefinitive and verifiable evidence that Phillip Emeagwali falsely claimed a woman as his wife when in fact the woman is not his wife, cannot be a disclaimer by the woman claimed as wife.\n\nThis is not to say that Phillip did not make a false claim.\n\nThe point being made here is that Franklyne Ogbunwezeh is well within his rights to request evidence of the false claim that informed or necessitated the disclaimer.\n\noa\n\nFrom: usaafric...@googlegroups.com [mailto:usaafric...@googlegroups.com] On Behalf Of Okey Ukaga"
