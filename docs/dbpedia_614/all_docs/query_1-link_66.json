        "text": "Flipping through stackedly-packed pages of a chequered history, one would readily posit that Nigeria, like almost any other country of the world, has had her own fair share of post-independent ups and downs .If the wave of internal issues rocking the nation at the moment are anything to go by, saying the stakes are below par would amount to saying the obvious. However, It’s worthy of note that an integral part of the Nigerian nation has been the dynamics of her people. A Rational thirst for success, resilience, and a great deal of optimism sum up the symptomatic hallmark of the Nigerian people.\n\nThis page mirrors a handful of prominent Nigerians, who have excelled in their different specters of interest, leaving behind indelible tales of their successful exploits. With the cream of renowned world Writers talking the Soyinkas, the school of effluent Journalists thinking the Okes, the academia of broad-minded Engineers celebrating the internet breakthrough of the Emeagwalis, the crop of distinguished Medical Personnel puzzled by the success story of the Kutis and world fashion super stars ruminating over the exploits of the Daregos, there is no gainsaying in the fact that, a ‘Nigeria’ that works hard enough, making success a hallmark, clenches in her fist the keys to becoming the focal point in a world of growing economies! That working, pragmatic Nigeria, devoid of all forms of ‘malactions’, starts right here, with us. The Nigerians featured on this page are/were the quintessence of a working, successful Nigeria.
