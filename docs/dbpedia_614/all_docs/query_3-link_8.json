        "text": "the US, the government has a list of the 20 most difficult problems in science and engineering called the 20 Grand Challenges. One of them is petroleum reservior simulation. Emeagwali wanted to crack this.\n\nHe explains: \"Oil is usually found underground, trapped in rocks. Until my experiment, en-gineers were able to recover only about 10% of the oil in any reservior by using supercomputers to simulate oil fields and track the oil flow.\n\nI chose this problem because in this field, in order to have the most impact, you have to work on the most serious problems.\" Coming from Nigeria, he knew that an oil field was not just a huge underground cave.\n\n\"Oil is found in pores within rocks,\" he continues, \"and oil companies must pump gas or water into fields to force the oil to nearby wells.\n\n\"But if the oil is sucked out too quickly at one well, then oil elsewhere may not flow naturally to the same well and is virtually trapped. The company must then drill another well at considerable expense to extract the trapped oil.\n\n\"The money involved is staggering. That's why I set myself to understand the flow within oil fields and how many barrels can be removed at any one well\".\n\nTo help him overcome the problem, Emeagwali looked elsewhere. He knew that in the early 1930s, the German mathematician Paul Fillunger had formulated a theory on partial differential equations.\n\nBut Fillunger was not \"successful.\" A sceptical panel of experts publicly announced in March 1937 that the German had failed to solve the equations. Fillunger felt so humiliated that he and his wife committed suicide. After their deaths, the Russian mathematician B. K Risenkampf seized on Fillunger's idea, but he too was only able to partially solve the equations. But Philip Emeagwali showed in 1989 that Fillunger's original equations were correct.\n\nHe modified Fillunger's equations on his computer and then divided the simulated oil field into eight million points, assigning 128 points to each of the 65,536 processors linked to the Connection Machine.\n\nEmeagwali in front of the partial differential equations that won him the Gordon Bell in 1989\n\nHe had written his programme to instruct each point in the 65,536-chain to talk with six neighbours simultaneously. The results were phenomenal!\n\nThe Breakthrough\n\nif he were Archimedes, the great Greek mathematician, he would have run out of his bath shouting \"eureka, eureka\" (I've found it, I've found it).\n\nBut Emeagwali was Nigerian. When the Connection Machine popped up the results, his eyes went wild! He screamed and punched the air. He had achieved 3.1 billion calculations per second! And not only that: His calculations had determined the amount of oil in the simulated oil field, its direction of flow and speed at each point.\n\nFor the entire oil field, (all eight million points), his calculations had taken one-sixth of a second, which mimicked a few hours of actual oil flow. one of America's 20 Grand Challenges had been solved - by a Nigerian who dropped out of school at age 14!\n\n\"When he told me the results, I thought he had made a mistake,\" says William Martin, Director of the University of Michigan's Laboratory for Scientific Computation where Emeagwali spent 13 hours a day for eight months working on the project.\n\nIt was enough to win him the Gordon Bell Prize.\n\nSaid the Gordon Bell Committee: \"The amount of money at stake is staggering. For example, you can typically expect to recover 10% of a field's oil. If you can improve your production schedule to get just 1% more oil, you will increase your yield by $400m (at $20 per barrel in a 20-billion-barrel field)\".\n\nEmeagwali's breakthrough made this possible. It changed the view of a sceptical petroleum industry that massively parallel computers could be used to recover more oil. Today, seven years on, 10% of all massively parallel computers are purchased by the oil industry alone. And the speed of Emeagwali's calculations are helping the OPEC nations to extract more oil and increase their oil revenue.\n\nSince the breakthrough, Emeagwali has gone from strength to strength. In March this year, he was adjudged the Pioneer of the Year by the National Society of Black Engineers in the US. The award was presented to him at a ceremony in Nashville, Tennesse, attended by 6,000 international scientists and engineers. It is the most prestigious recognition bestowed by the Society on individuals whose \"intellectual contributions have benefitted all mankind.\"\n\nEmeagwali was cited for his \"discoveries and inventions that led to the acceptance of massively parallel computing technology, and in particular their use in the petroleum industry to recover more oil.\" The award greatly pleased Emeagwali as he got it ahead of other eminent scientists and engineers like the US-based Ghanaian Dr Thomas Mensah who is currently leading the design of advanced laser-guided weapons (also known as Smart Weapons) such as the US Patriot missiles which became famous during the Gulf War.\n\nDr Mensah holds seven patents in fiber optics - three in fiber optics guided missile technolgy, and four in manufacturing fiber optics inexpensively which, experts say, will impact hugely on the use of fax machines, electronic banking and other communications gadgetry.\n\nDespite the fame, Philip Emeagwali is not resting on his oars. This April, he presented a 819-page description of a revolutionary hyperball computer to the US Office of Patents and Trademarks. His new computer will enable scientists to better understand the long-term effects of greenhouse gases and global warming.\n\nRevolutionary Invention\n\nHis tessellation of the Earth's surface\n\nHe based the new computer on the \"theory of tessellated models\" which he formulated himself. This theory demonstrates that tessellations (sphere packings) and fast parallel computations are related fields.\n\nParallel computers in use today are based on the hypercube or hypertree networks which do not map efficiently over the Earth's surface. Emeagwali's hyperball is different. It was inspired by the complex geometries and patterns he observed in nature - the arrangements of molecules in crystals and the structure of bee's honeycombs.\n\nEmeagwali's new revolutionary hyperball computer network was based on the theory of tesselated models. Each red dot represents a processor and each red line represents the path used in sending and receiving information between the processors.\n\nHis invention divides the Earth's atmosphere into sections that simulate a bee's honeycomb. Bees, he says, use the most efficient method to construct their honeycombs, so a computer network which emulated the honeycomb will be more efficient and powerful in forecasting the world's weather patterns a century or more ahead of time.\n\n\"At the moment, there is no computer that can do this. My hyperball will make this possible,\" he says.\n\nHot Stuff\n\nMarried to an African-American microbiologist, Dale Brown, who has borne him a 6-year-old son, Emeagwali is enjoying his days in St Paul, Minnesota. He is an Internet freak - his personal Website (http://emeagwali.com) is so hot that it is accessed by 800 people a day from all over the world."
