        "text": "In every ma­jor field of sci­ence, from hu­man bi­ol­o­gy to out­er space ex­plo­ration, Africans from Africa and its Di­as­po­ra are on the front­lines. Many African Amer­i­cans are on the cut­ting edge of tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion in the NASA space pro­gram. An­na Mc­Gowan, to cite one ex­am­ple, is lead­ing a team of sci­en­tists at NASA's Lan­g­ley Re­search Cen­ter in Vir­ginia, which is work­ing on de­vel­op­ing, among oth­er things, self-re­pair­ing air­plane wings and space shut­tle skin. If the wing of an air­plane with this tech­nol­o­gy is dam­aged in flight, it will re­pair it­self. When this tech­nol­o­gy is ful­ly op­er­a­tional it will pre­vent ac­ci­dents such as the one that de­stroyed the Chal­lenger space shut­tle a few years ago.\n\nCarl Black­wood, a Ja­maican ho­n­oured by the ESC in 2008 with the Hen­ry Sylvester Williams Award, is one of the world's fore­most in­ven­tors in the area of satel­lite tech­nol­o­gy. He al­so holds patents for in­ven­tions that have im­proved air­plane se­cu­ri­ty in­clud­ing sys­tems for de-ic­ing planes and wind shear de­tec­tion. He has pub­licly of­fered his ser­vices to African and Caribbean coun­tries. In the field of med­i­cine, Ben Car­son was the first doc­tor to sep­a­rate twins con­joined at the head and he is still con­sult­ed to­day by doc­tors in any part of the world un­der­tak­ing such an op­er­a­tion.\n\nIn the field of com­put­ers our peo­ple have made many break­throughs.\n\nOne of them, Mark Dean, is a mem­ber of the Unit­ed States Na­tion­al In­ven­tors Hall of Fame for the ma­jor role he played in trans­form­ing the com­put­er world. Work­ing with IBM since 1980 Dr Dean holds three (3) of the orig­i­nal nine (9) patents on the com­put­er that all PC's are based up­on, and he has in­tro­duced many more sig­nif­i­cant in­no­va­tions. Philip Emeag­wali, who opened the 2008 Kwame Ture Memo­r­i­al Lec­ture Se­ries, is a Niger­ian sci­en­tist who rose from be­ing a child sol­dier in the Bi­afran War to be­come a win­ner of the pres­tigous Gor­don Bell Prize for com­put­ing in 1989. In 2001 he was named by CNN as one of the Fa­thers of the In­er­net.\n\nIn Trinidad and To­ba­go we crossed new fron­tiers in mu­si­cal tech­nol­o­gy with our in­ven­tion of the steel pan in the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry. Un­for­tu­nate­ly when we see satel­lites pro­vid­ing our telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and shut­tles hurtling in­to out­er space, when we use our com­put­ers and the in­ter­net, we are com­plete­ly un­aware of the vi­tal roles our peo­ple have played in the cre­ation of such tech­nolo­gies, rob­bing us of the im­ages and in­for­ma­tion which could rekin­dle our con­fi­dence in our own ca­pa­bil­i­ty."
