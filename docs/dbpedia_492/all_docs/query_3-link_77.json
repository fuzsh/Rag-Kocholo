        "text": "Digested read: got lucky with a lift to Fountains Abbey parkrun. O.M.G reet nice out! Orsum. Fabbeylous actually. Really, it was! 🙂\n\nUndigested read:\n\nthis could take a while, maybe get yourself a tankard of mead or something – failing that gin would do, unless you are reading this over breakfast before going to work, maybe not then, maybe then coffee would be best. And if you are going for neat gin, maybe not a whole tankard, but you know what, each to their own. I won’t judge, whatever it takes to get you through the read ahead.\n\nRolls up sleeves. Here goes:\n\n“Idleness is the enemy of the soul. For this reason the brethren should be occupied at certain times in manual labour and at other times in sacred reading.”\n\n– From St Benedict’s Rule\n\nAs St Benedict quite literally set the rules for conduct at Fountains Abbey right at the outset, it seems only fair that anyone rocking up to the place on, oh I don’t know, let’s say a sunny Saturday morning 1,500 years later in 2019 for arguments sake, should at least pay a nod of respect to that legacy. This can be achieved by avoiding idleness through being actively involved in parkrun, and then spending hours poring over social media posts all about it afterwards, in the spirit of ‘sacred reading’. I reckon that has mind and body nicely covered. And people do get most evangelical about parkrun, and rightly so, me too to be fair. I am not alone in getting drunkenly emotional about it sometimes, how it brings people together. All sorts of people, in all sorts of ways. Check out this octogenarian meet up at Bushy parkrun this weekend for starters. Looks amazing, as does their celebratory cake. Hurrah!\n\nI know. Amazing! Anyway, where was I, oh yes, Fountains Abbey, and filling you in on St Benedict, or ‘Big Ben’ as I shall think of him from now on.\n\nHere he is below, writing his rules apparently, in Latin, which isn’t massively inclusive to be fair, but I daresay he was a product of his time. I’m sure nowadays he’d be more explicit about doing parkrun and then be pictured writing the run report afterwards (not in Latin), but here he is anyway.\n\nI’m glad I don’t have to write this blog post standing up, and by quill pen, that would be a bit of a palaver to be honest, but I daresay he had more self-discipline and less access to the interweb and a blogging platform, so we are all but products of our time. Though times needn’t be what defines us as parkrunners. No indeedy, not at all, you see, it’s not about the times necessarily at parkrun, it’s about the taking part, a run not a race and all that. Head for a PB if you wish, or enjoy a social romp round at a more leisurely pace. Anyways, it’s extremely hard to concentrate on running round at Fountains Abbey because the setting is distractingly spectacular and if you are me, you therefore have to stop every 20 yards or so to take a blurry photo or interact with a marshal. These things take time. Documenting a parkrun location like this just can’t be hurried.\n\nI mean just look at it – this isn’t my photo to be fair, it’s one from the NT website, but you get the gist, mine are more, erm, blurred authentically atmospheric.\n\nOh, am I making no sense? That’s not a first for me. The thing is, apparently, accordingtoWikipediasoitmustbetrue, The Rule of Saint Benedict (Latin: Regula Benedicti) is a book of precepts written in 516 by Benedict of Nursia (c. AD 480–550) for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot. Fountains Abbey is a National Trust site – not only that, but Studley Royal park, which includes the ruins of Fountains Abbey was one of the first sites in the UK to be inscribed into the UNESCO World Heritage Site listings in 1986. That’s really, really impressive. No wonder they have a stone to that effect, even if it does say 1987 on it, and I got confused when I first saw it thinking as foundation stones go, that didn’t seem all that old for an abbey… If I’d understood the stone correctly, that would mean the abbey was founded the same year that top film releases included Cry Freedom, The Fly and Dirty Dancing. Now even allowing for a lack of general maintenance of the site since then, it shouldn’t really have crumbled into quite such of a ruin in the intervening years. …. it was helpful therefore to establish indeed it hadn’t. It had just got confirmation of its World Heritage Site status which is jolly good, and entirely different. Chronology clarified. Phew.\n\nIn fact, the abbey was founded in 1132 by 13 Benedictine monks from St Mary’s in York. They’d grown fed up of the extravagant and rowdy way that the monks lived in York and so they escaped seeking to live a devout and simple lifestyle elsewhere. This was how they came to Fountains. That’s what the NT website says anyway, so I’m guessing St Benedict didn’t deliver his rule book in person. Not if he wrote it in 516, surely?\n\nIncidentally, I think it a pleasing coincidence that right now, Unesco’s World Heritage Committee has been meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan to decide which sites deserve special status and protection. How exciting. There will be new kids on the block, but just so you know, this means, Fountains Abbey ranks alongside these offerings, however, it exceeds them in respect of providing a parkrun, those other locations don’t …. yet. It may of course only be a matter of time, but for now, Fountains Abbey is preferable as a destination of choice for a Saturday morning. How fortuitous to me that is reachable from Sheffield if facilitated by an early start and a driver for the morning. Yay!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nbelieve the hype!\n\nIt’s little wonder I’ve been wanting to do the parkrun here for ages, because whenever you see people’s photos of it it just looks stunning. However, now I’ve been, I can report than not only is indeed stunning – stunning to such a degree that even the stunning photos you see don’t do it justice – but also it has a fascinating and extensive history. You’ll have to google yourself but I will say this, according to historic uk . com Fountains Abbey:\n\nlies along the valley of the River Skell about two miles west of Ripon. The Abbey, Britain’s largest monastic ruin, was founded in 1132 by thirteen Benedictine monks from St Mary’s Abbey in York seeking a simpler life, who later became Cistercian monks. The abbey was named Fountains Abbey because of the springs of water that existed in the area\n\nand I have no reason to doubt any of this. Upshot is, it provides the perfect overlap of parkrun and culture, all capped off with a particularly excellent cafe. What’s not to like?\n\nSo back to basics, I’m ahead of myself..\n\nMy vague idea of ‘I’d really love to go to Fountains Abbey parkrun one day‘ became a more concrete plan after last week’s Round Sheffield Run. In the post run chit chat, I bumped into some fellow Sheffield Hallam parkrunners, who are also very committed parkrun tourists who’ve ticked off a pretty phenomenal number of destinations, but crucially not as yet Fountains. Let’s go together! Hurrah. It shall be so, how exciting! Particularly for me as I’d got it into my head that Fountains Abbey is a million miles away from Sheffield, and you’d basically need to head off the Sunday before to get there in time for it the following Saturday – incidentally, that might in fact be true if you are reliant on public transport, as it doesn’t look as if there ish even a bus every day. In fact, my fellow parkrunners were more optimistic thinking it was ‘about an hour’. Turns out we were both wrong, as it’s more like 90 mins if the roads are clear, and you aren’t as cautious as me about putting your foot down on the motorway, but you have to factor in YOU MUST NOT BE LATE. There is a bit of a hike down to the start of this parkrun, and to avoid abusing the hospitality of the National Trust, if you ain’t within the boundary walls by 8.45, you ain’t getting in. This may sound harsh, but having been to the event I can see why. Also, they had a serious medical incident a while back, where paramedics were needed, and it brought home to everyone the importance of the run briefing and everyone being clued up on what to do. Also, no late arrivals starting behind the tail walker. Fountains Abbey parkrun have quite a good Facebook post explaining some of their course specific logistics as a pinned post. I think it’s helpful. Worth a gander.\n\nAnyway, upshot was, date fixed, this was really happening BRING IT ON!\n\nAs with many parkrun adventures, this one began with an early morning start, and a trot down to my local corner supermarket, which is very fine spot indeed from which to embark on any new expedition or happening. So it was, here I was 6.35 a.m. bright eyed and bushy tailed, all expectant and excited and on the look out for my conveyance for the morning. Love Pops! No wonder my eyes were popping out with excitement of it all!\n\nIt was drizzling a bit, but to be honest, I was quite relived about that, I’ve been struggling in the heat.\n\nAfter a bit, good news, that’s it, that’s my conveyance coming up the road, with two cheery parkrunners within. Soooooooooooooooooo exciting! Even if in my excitement, I struggled to locate the door handle for the car. Not my fault, it was all aerodynamically set in on the body work so disguised. To gain access took a fair bit of initiative and problem solving skills on a par with completing a Rubik’s cube, which to be fair I’ve never actually achieved so let’s be a bit more realistic…. almost on a par with completing a Rubik’s cube.\n\nI was fully committed to getting to Fountains though, so it would take more than a hidden door handle to stop me getting in that car! I was in, and we were on our way!\n\nIt was indeed an ok drive to get there, especially as I didn’t have the angst of actually driving. The roads were clear, satnav took us to our destination, waving at Temple Newsam parkrun vaguely over the horizon as we passed it (sort of) en route.\n\nAnd we arrived, at the deserted car park, around 8.15 I think. The only problem was, because we were indeed pretty early – which is still waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay preferable to being even an eeny teeny bit late – there was no other sign of parkrun life. Also, the car parking area is sort of tastefully landscaped, which meant it was unexpectedly confusing about where you should park, it had lots of side parks, and the signage was tasteful and discrete so it took a little while to decide where to pull up and fathom what direction to head in. The car park looks like this by the way, in winter – picture is from the handy Fountains Abbey parkrun pictorial guide. In fact, I might nick some of their other pics, as they fill in the gaps in my own record very nicely. 🙂\n\nAfter a couple of strategic circuits, trying to find other life forms and the best place to park, we pulled up near to someone else who was heaving on trainers, and then followed signs to the visitors’ centre. It wasn’t very far, nor was it too much of a navigational challenge on account of the fact the visitors centre is ENORMOUS!\n\nIt was all VERY exciting. Such amazing facilities, a huge cafe, loos, indoor and outdoor seating areas, fab views, a gift shop and…. most importantly of all loos. I say loos, but honestly, what loos were these? Pretty much a destination in their own right I’d say. Never seen anything like it, and I’ve seen the loos at Osterley parkrun, which have their own topiary lining the path on the way in:\n\nNow my regular reader will know that I do like to be able to avail myself of a precautionary pee pre parkrun, never more so than when undertaking parkrun tourism, when you arrive full-bladdered after a long journey. Well, what can I say about the Fountains Abbey loos? Not only were they present – always a boon – but they were hi-tech to such a degree that the sinks had instructions on them so the user would know how to operate them. I know! I’m not even exaggerating for comedic effect. These were space age, sleek, immaculately clean and ‘touch free’ steel and white porcelain designs. I mean just look on in wonder:\n\nAnd it wasn’t just me who was amazed and impressed in equal measure. Emerging from our respective ablutions, newly arrived runners remarked to one another with wonderment about what they had just seen. Who knew that posh toiletry fittings could be such an ice breaker, way more user friendly than the Monty Python’s Big Red Book chocolate box selections which it is true would break the ice at parties, but was not to everyone’s taste. Take for example ‘Spring Surprise’, chocolate wrapped around two stainless steel bolts that “spring out and plunge straight through both [of the victim’s] cheeks”. Would certainly get people talking, but also create an awkward health and safety issue which would have to be resolved before parkrun got under way.\n\nAs if the delights of the toilets wasn’t enough, there were more big reveals still to come. Specifically, after the devastating discovery that there was a disappointing lack of perennials available for purchase at last weekend’s otherwise excellent Round Sheffield Run, I am pleased to report dear reader, that here the Fountains Abbey parkrun venue offered up an excellent selection of plants – not only for borders, but for complete garden redesign. Hurrah. Told you it would be a good move to have this offer at the RSR next year. I mean just look, and this was just our fly-by observations en route to the start!\n\nThis kept us entertained for a bit, just browsing… for now but anyone from Sheffield could tell you that those Monday Mobsters know their onions. She’ll be back if there’s a bargain to be bagged!\n\nand then we saw a sign pointing towards the start area, and espied a teasing glimpse of the horizon in the distance, through a gentle swishing screen of tall grasses. O.M.G it was just so picturesque, if you haven’t been there yet, you’ll have no idea. Just go!\n\nNow there was a dilemma. We were still a good half hour early, but it takes 15 mins to get to start (ish) but I was thinking I might need a second pee before taking to the trail. Well, the early start necessitated extra caffeine, and I hadn’t fully thought through the consequences of that. But as we hadn’t been before didn’t want to cut it too fine trying to locate the start. What to do? Well dear reader, I can report that as if by magic a cheery hi-vis hero appeared to save the day. Not only did he give instructions to the start – which were quite complicated to be fair, but actually just follow the signs/ everyone else, but also he informed us there were more loos at the start! This is the parkrun that just keeps on giving. Stress alleviated, we could march on with confidence and without tena ladies. Hurrah! What a nice man. You can just make out the abbey in the middle, but it sort of blends into the tree line. Think of my photos as being about giving the gist of the occasion, a teaser to make you go find out for yourself, that way you will have managed your expectations and I can cease being embarrassed about my ineptitude with a camera and concentrate on being embarrassed about my ineptitude as a runner which frankly is quite time consuming enough!\n\nThank you nice marshal. He even took a team photo for us. I think this is the only one that captures us all together, looking individually and collectively gorgeous I’m sure you’ll agree.\n\nso next mission, was to walk down to the start. Even this was lovely. It was like a little treasure trail of discoveries. Fantastic views, educational displays, interactions with other massing parkrunners, lots of wool – the only disappointment is that parkrunners were explicitly warned off the adventure playground prior to 10 a.m. which was a shame, as it looked extremely enticing! Enjoy the smorgasbord of photos documenting our walk below:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIt isn’t massively far, but you do need a good 15 minutes because if you are newcomer you will definitely be distracted by the sights and delights on the way down. You have to inspect the wicker monk for example, and spot the real hen alongside the model ones. These things take time.\n\nWhen you arrive though, wow. I thought nothing was going to top the loos, but I was wrong. It’s gorgeous, and we’d only seen a glimpse of what was to unfold.\n\nOnce you reach the path at the abbey, you can spot the assembling volunteers, and a steady stream of runners coming to the start area. I went for a mini explore, and can confirm there are indeed more toilets in this area, but also ruins, and views and places to go and people to see and also a random ladder on a path – in situ for the RD briefing, but I still couldn’t see that, but minor point. Amongst the parkrunners was one adorned with a bespoke sash to mark the occasion of a both a birthday and a fiftieth run. Nice planning there, well done. I asked about a bag drop, and basically there is a handy ruin where you can stash things. Excellent.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAfter a bit of milling and chilling, there was a call to move towards the start, and 400+ of us duly did. The paths are pretty good, but they do ask you to line up in approximate finish times and have signs to help with that. Dogs and buggies – along with accompanying responsible adults – are at the back. There were a fair few tourists, and you could feel the frisson of excitement as we skipped to the starting pens! I was a bit confused by the sweatshop running club, I thought sweatshop went into administration, so not sure if that is a hangover from one of their running shops, or something else entirely…\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAstonishingly, people were pretty silent for the run briefing, huge relief. It does my head in when people talk through that. Volunteers were thanked, milestones celebrated and the course was explained. Usual things. Thanks for some donated tops worn by the volunteers, but I didn’t catch quite what they were, maybe I’ll work it out retrospectively from the pics.\n\nOh you want to know the course, fair do-s. The Fountains Abbey parkrun website blah de blah describes the course thus:\n\nCourse Description\n\nSheltered in a secluded valley only around 3 miles south west of Ripon lies Fountains Abbey & Studley Royal Water Garden; a World Heritage site and one of the most historic and beautiful places in Europe. Starting from Huby’s Tower at the Abbey, this is a 2 lap gently undulating, clockwise course run entirely on National Trust land on firm footpaths, designed to ensure no runner will be lapped. The route is marked with high vis signs. All runners should wear road shoes in all weathers; there are no muddy sections.\n\nThe first shorter lap heads past the East Lawn, around the Rustic Bridge & Half Moon pond, following the River Skell back past the Abbey, the West Lawn and Abbey tea rooms.\n\nThe second lap passes the Abbey heading left of the Rustic Bridge around the stunning Studley Royal Water Garden crossing the narrow wooden footbridge in front of the Lake and following a stunning course back towards the finish line at Robin Hood’s Well, in sight of the Abbey.\n\nThe start and finish is a 10 minute walk from the Fountains Abbey visitor car park, cafe and toilet facilities.\n\nand it looks like this:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nWhich personally, I think looks a bit like a child’s scooter, but that is probably just me. Not necessarily a pink one, but definitely that silhouette…\n\nSo that’s the theory, all well and good, but what about in practice eh?\n\nWell, when the call for ‘off’ went out, there was the familiar ripple of movements as runners started rolling forwards. I was positioned pretty much at the back, so it took a little while to get going, but what really delayed me was having to dive to the side every few seconds to capture yet another shot of yet another view, that and to thank all the marshals, which I do endeavour to do wherever possible. I found the marshals really friendly and encouraging, by which I mean most were game for posing for a shot in between clapping enthusiastically and expert directional pointing. They were pros for sure.\n\nThe first part of the route takes you directly alongside the ruins\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe path seemed to me to be pretty wide, and runners courteous. The team do warn of congestion at certain points on the course namely the rustic bridge corner for lap one and the narrow – single track only – wooden bridge that you encounter on lap two. Where I was, it was fine, I suppose faster runners might have to be more aware of one another where the corner is sharp and the paths suddenly narrow, but it’s a run not a race after all, so I like to think common sense would prevail.\n\nAfter the abbey, the route opens up and it’s lovely grassland, with an artificial waterway separating you from the speedier runners heading back on the loop the other way. I did try for some arty distance shots, but my camera isn’t really up to it, but maybe if you squint, you’ll get the idea, and remember people, it’s the thought that counts.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nLovely marshals, some in pairs, they looked like they were having a lot of fun. The nice thing about a two lap course, is that you get to meet them all again. Yay!\n\nCouple of things you should look out for in the photo montage below. Firstly, note the exquisitely even spone casing, sorry cone spacing skills of one marshal. Nice work. Don’t be fooled by the jauntily jolly smiley marshal shooing you round the lake, he pulls a bit of a trick on lap two. Nearly caught me out, but I’ve spotted marshals teleporting round courses before, didn’t fool me. Also note the fabulous reflection shots that show so much promise and deliver so much disappointment. Reference earlier comment about it being the thought that counts. Also, note how the sun has come out, just to sparkle more vividly on the water and pick out the stone ruins and green trees in all their detailed loveliness. Told you it was a nice one.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI was dropping further and further back down the field on account of my stop start approach. I might have been able to pass it off as interval training to the untrained eye, but most eyes were trained and not to be fooled. My favourite marshals today though – I know you shouldn’t really have them, but well, I couldn’t help it – pointed out that as course photographer I had a busy and important role to fulfil so it was inevitable my times would be compromised. I mean, really, I was martyring myself by so sacrificing my run! Well, she may not of actually said that in so many words, but I’m pretty sure that was the gist of it.\n\nAs I looped round the back, I found myself leapfrogging the same few runners. Specifically, this awesome twosome. As they passed marshals, and indeed a few other runners, people were asking ‘where’s the carrot?’ Hmm, puzzling. Less puzzling once I’d used my Sherlockesque detective skills and found an earlier photo on the Fountains Abbey Facebook page. I can’t entirely account for the choice or reason for this particular companion vegetable being carried en route, but I think a bit of mystery makes the world a better and more interesting place. Great running though, and great company too! Well it was for me anyway, I daresay you may have preferred a cuddly root vegetable, but glad you made the best of the situation in which you found yourselves!\n\nAs I was coming towards the end of the first lap, I could now see the runners looping round on the opposite side of the waterway again. It was again a lovely sight, but oh so hard to capture on film.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI have a renewed respect for those wildlife photographers who get stunning action shots of wildebeest on migration taken from a fair distance away. Honestly, it’s way harder than you might imagine. Mind you, if you were a ‘proper’ photographer, and got yourself down to this course you’d have an absolute field day, so much to see and so many brilliant spots to position yourself in. Never mind feeling spoilt by an ambassador breaking open the Ferrero Rocher for a photographer, here you would rewrite the rule book about what it means to feel truly indulged! Well probably, I’m not a photographer, I wouldn’t know, maybe you’d rather a challenge. In which case, many congratulations for securing the gig for The M1 Appreciation Course.\n\nAlso as you reach the end of the first lap, well if you are towards the rear of the field anyway, you get to see the marshals repositioning themselves for the finish tunnel and token scanning roles. This is an event that has a lot of marshals, but they all seemed to be having a good time together, I get the impression if it was your local event you could join the volunteer team and get a warm welcome and feel part of it all quite quickly. Oh, and hello, here is our friendly marshal from the gateway at the top earlier, also teleported down. Hurrah. I particularly enjoyed the guard of honour applauding in unison as I passed, but fine use of bright yellow flexi tubs being brought into operation. As to for what purpose, all would be revealed later.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSo you loopity loop round and back to where you started from, and round you go again – now I could STILL see the faster runners, this time queuing up in the finish tunnel. I reckon that cheery looking marshal was actually quite feisty, her smiling demeanour a cover for how she might turn were you to break ranks and sprint in a straight line to the finish, splashing through the gently trickling water feature as you did so. She’d outrun you for sure. Not to be under-estimated these marshals.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nYou need to note that that the second loop is different, you go beyond the rustic bridge, finding the marshal has cunningly repositioned himself, almost brazen about it he was:\n\nSo onward you go, no rushing across the rustic bridge this time, and lo! You start to espy all these amazing – if slightly risque statues in amongst the water gardens.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIt was like being in a novel or on a film set or something. Actually, you probably are in a film set, I can’t imagine this hasn’t been the backdrop for plenty of costume dramas in its time, it’s begging for it. What exactly are that naked couple doing, trying to recreate the scene in Dirty Dancing where they were practising in the water perhaps, but caught before they’d actually perfected the lift? Yep, that does seem the most likely explanation to be fair. I mean look closely –\n\nI have a point do I not? Rhetorical question, I totally do! I rest my case.\n\nDid you know there is actually a Dirty Dancing Festival where they recreate the lifts amongst other pointless activities. I never really got that film to be honest, I was more a Fly person. Not actually a fly person as in part fly part person, but as in liking that film The Fly better. It was partly a Jeff Goldblum thing if I’m completely honest. This is a famous fly person though, George Brossard sticking up for insects everywhere.\n\nso you romp on round, knowing, that at any minute you’ll finally get to run on to the MUCH EXCITEMENT little wooden bridge, that definitely has trolls underneath it. It must do, otherwise why would they marshal it so thoroughly and get you to keep in single file. It’s because that minimises the number of people on the bridge at all times, so if the trolls should strike, you limit the numbers affected. A bit of collateral damage perhaps, a few parkrunners lost en route, but a risk well worth taking for such a fun and iconic pathway. It couldn’t have been lovelier, bright sunshine reflecting on the water, low flying swans gliding over head. Marvellous.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI wanted to get some arty shots of some other runners behind me crossing the bridge – obviously, I had mixed feelings about what I’d do if a troll came out to grab them whilst I was shooting – exactly the complex sea of emotions a wildlife photographer has to navigate when his migrating wildebeest negotiate a river crossing and some will get snatched by crocodiles, awful shame obvs, but great photo. No trolls emerged this time though. Took a while for the runners to cross. I spoke to them later. They weren’t hesitating because of troll watch, but because they’d seen me lining up my shot and didn’t want to spoil my landscape picture. Very thoughtful!\n\nNot too far to the finish now, but you have to drag yourself away from an astonishing statue of Neptune, I presume. And check out the adornments on the folly – if it is a folly, it might be a building with a purpose, I have no idea.\n\nthose marshals can’t be expected to wave and high-five themselves now can they? Hang on, haven’t I seen that teleporting marshal somewhere before?\n\nand that most excellent view is calling you round, whilst behind you are photogenic runners giving their all. Incidentally, I have the photos in higher resolution if anyone wants them, get in touch. Or if you don’t want them in this post let me know and I can remove them. We will still have our memories.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nand then ‘suddenly’ there they all at the finish, to cheer you in!\n\nIt’s a great welcome through the finish funnel, but slightly odd in that because it’s a narrow spot, they encourage other runners to move on through and place the barscanners a hundred metres or so ahead. Then you are on track to get back to the cafe, and parkrunners are, for the most part, to just keep on going once they can smell the coffee. This means it’s a warm welcome from the core team, but not a place where you’d be encouraged to wait to cheer in your friends as I suppose it has the potential to get crowded.\n\nNo matter, have token, will scan:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nand then a lovely scenic wander back round to the start, where, if like me you have running buddies with you, there can be a grand reunion, before plodding back up the hill and to the cafe. One of our group, see if you can guess who he it was, strode on a considerable distance ahead. It’s just his their thing apparently. Good to know. Maybe it’s like the royal family, you know, apparently they never risking travelling on the same plane together, you know, just in case. Best not to be in the vicinity of your other half when on manoeuvres, you know, just in case! 🙂\n\nHilarious.\n\nI thought so.\n\nMind you, it’s been said before, I can be all too easily entertained. There are worse qualities to own in life surely.\n\nI’d taken so long to get round, my buddies were having a lie down and a power nap by the time I got back to them, but they were roused on my return. Our walk up the hill was interrupted by having to pose with wicker sculptures, you’ll do the same when your time comes. It’s actually compulsory I think, for first timers anyway.\n\nThere is also a picture of me, having a cuddle with a pig, because they are my favourite animal. Well warthogs more specifically, but I’ll settle for a pig. However, I have exercised editorial control over that snap for now. Did you know that if you scratch a warthog on its chest, it makes the hairs on its back stand on end. A tame one that is, I’m not sure a wild one would be quite so impressed. Love a warthog. Sigh. Happy days. Here is an actual warthog giving a proper cuddle, way better than a wicker pig.\n\nStill no point in being nostalgic for pig encounters, time to focus on the cafe. En route we passed a wedding party with huge hats and morning suits coming down the other way. I suddenly felt very under dressed! Apparently last week, a bride and entourage did parkrun pre their wedding at Fountains. Hang on, let me see if I can find a pic.\n\nThere you go – taken from Fountains Abbey parkrun Facebook page photos. I’m sure they won’t mind. Looks like they both picked nice days for a white wedding.\n\nInto the cafe. Now, I thought the loos were good, but the cafe was grand too. Spacious, not too noisy, and with ‘usual’ National Trust fare. I was a bit discombobulated by finding not one but two queues, one very much longer than the other, but the short queue didn’t seem to have any cheese scones left, which every National Trust cafe user must appreciate is the food of choice. Amusingly for me – but we’ve already established that doesn’t take much – the couple behind me in the queue were having exactly the same dilemma. We all went to the long queue, but then joked – with slight tension – about what we’d do if we all got to the front and found only one left. OH NO!\n\nFortunately dear reader, that eventuality did not come to pass, so all’s well that ends well. There follow mandatory cafe shots:\n\nWe debated about where the cafe sat in our top ten of post parkrun eateries, and it’s definitely a contender for first place. Spacious, clean, surprisingly not too expensive, and, not noisy either. Also huge outdoor space for post parkrun lingering and putting the world to rights in the summer. For general ambience, one of the best, for me, I’d have liked to have seen some more imaginative veggie breakfast options. Pom in Sheffield a veggie/vegan cafe is the best for actual food, though not for comfort. This place was excellent though\n\nOnly when we left, saying farewell to the token sorters, did we realise we’d missed out on the nibble and scribble option. Never mind, next time eh, next time? Hang on a parkrun minute – I’m sure I’ve seen that token sorter somewhere before…\n\nWe didn’t miss out on the shop stop though. Browsing blooms and books with enthusiasm. Wish I’d bought some basil now, bargain at £1 a pot.\n\nand then, that was it, time to go. Bye bye Fountains Abbey parkrun, it’s been a blast, thanks for the warm welcome and the wondrous memories, watch out though, we’ll be back! parkrun Wonder of the North indeed.\n\nFor all my parkrun related posts click here. Or don’t. It’s up to you.\n\nMind and body though, need to keep your sacred reading up alongside your parkrunning remember though, just sayin.\n\nYou’re welcome.\n\n🙂\n\nDigested read: parkrun tourism took me to Osterley parkrun. I went in search of an ‘O’ and discovered an ooooooooooh!\n\nUndigested read:\n\nWell, that was unexpected.\n\nEvents have again taken me away from Sheffield and down south again. I was seeking a different parkrun to take in some tourism at a new venue, done Kingston and Bushy parkrun already. Bushy parkrun is obviously especially epic, but you know, seen the unicorns and rainbows there a fair few times and felt like I ought to check out some of the other local options this time round. I was initially contemplating heading out to the Old Dear Deer Park parkrun, because that sounded lovely and is relatively near to where I am staying. However, and I hope this doesn’t sound too ungracious, when I read the blurb for it on their parkrun page I was put off by fear of having to drive through Kingston on a Saturday morning to get there. I’m a scaredy cat what with the sheer volume of traffic and the mysterious hieroglyphics of its one-way systems – though I do have a particular soft spot for the falling phone boxes sculpture. Always loved that. You know the one I mean? You don’t? That’s terrible, you’ve missed out, let me google that for your…. here you are:\n\nLove it! I’d rather have functional phone boxes, but if we can’t any more I’m glad they’ve been preserved thus. In the olden days when we used slide rules at school, had to endure the test card waiting for the TV to come on I always used to carry a 2d coin with me in case you needed to phone for help, and dear reader, it doesn’t seem all that long ago I had to use the red phone box on the corner to phone the fire brigade when my next door neighbour’s flat caught fire! I know, I’m a living, breathing oral history project just waiting to be discovered… anyway, you’ve distracted me, begging to know about the telephone boxes, where was I? Oh yes, debating parkrun options.\n\nThe other off-putting aspect of the Old Deer Park parkrun was that further investigation of the route left me horrified to find it is basically three loops on grass that looks suspiciously like playing fields. I’m still traumatised by having to run round a field at the start of Penistone parkrun last weekend, and it feels a bit too soon to subject myself to the twin trauma of humiliating flashbacks to both school sports days and my more recent misguided foray into cross country running. (Ask yourself not ‘how hard can it be?’ but ‘honestly, why would you?’). I’m sure the Old Deer Park parkrun is delightful, and I will do it, but not for me this time round, too close in time to other XC type running scenarios. Hmm, what to do? The thing is, when I stumbled on it on the events list, I was swayed a bit by the handiness of it starting with the letter ‘O’. I’ve got the game-changing running challenges chrome extension thingymajig, and so I know I lack this for my parkrun alphabet. Actually, I lack loads of letters, I’ve got hardly any, but I do know that the O s are hard to come by. Hence, whilst I’m only half-halfheartedly pursuing that particular challenge – to complete a parkrun beginning with each letter of the alphabet apart from X because that isn’t currently an option – the prospect of securing an ‘O’ was definitely appealing. Hmm, so how to weigh up the pro of getting an ‘O’ against the con of reliving the humiliation of a cross country run?\n\nThe solution was to find another ‘O’ parkrun in striking distance, and so it was I came across Osterley parkrun. Never heard of it, but it was only about 12 miles away from where I am staying, didn’t require going through Kingston traffic so why not. My decision was made. Some classy photos too on their Facebook page too hmm, looking grand.\n\nOh hang on, you probably want to know about the course blah de blah. According to the Osterley parkrun website the course is described thus:\n\nThis is a 2 lap course on firm paths which starts and finishes in front of the mansion house.\n\nOh. Concise certainly. Somewhat minimalist, but not sounding too much like a cross country course. Accurate too, now I’ve done it, but it really doesn’t quite convey the totality of the Osterley parkrun immersion experience. Nor do the maps of the route, though they offer up a few teasers I suppose. Proximity to the M4 isn’t an obvious selling point perhaps, but there’s a fair bit of green and blue boding well…\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI’d find out soon enough.\n\nAfter the heat wave of last weekend, it was distinctly chilly, blustery and wet on rising this Saturday. I left ridiculously early in case of hitting London traffic, and driving down cherry tree lined roads had my windscreen ferociously battered by blossom brought down by the winds. I’ve never previously thought of cherry blossom as potentially endangering life, but it was unrelenting, a veritable pink-out of petals impeding my vision. I’ve not had such an unexpected alarming blossom related experience since the eighties, when I was helping a friend move house and accidentally moved her set of five foot paper hyacinths into the wrong house. I so wish I had a photo of them, they were magnificent, but this was the olden days when to take a photo you had to use film that came in a roll of 12 pictures and you had to take it to the chemist to be developed so really, just never took any. It was an honest mistake, could have happened to anyone after all, what household doesn’t have to transport five foot paper hyacinths that are a prop from an Ibsen* play every time they move house? The thing is, seeing as how you are asking. I’d gone on ahead so I could stuff my car (an 850cc mini called the Jolly Titanic – not got a photo of her either) as much as possible, and she was going to walk on round behind me.\n\nWhen I got to the house, the front door was open, and I could hear the other tenants moving about so I just moved everything into the hallway whilst I was waiting for her, imagining how pleased she’d be at how I’d cracked on. … then she arrived. It was the wrong house. Her new house was next door. Now, consider if you will what etiquette is required here. It’s one thing to be caught accidentally moving stuff into a house, but more problematic exiting a house carrying boxes. Should we alert the residents to what had happened? Well, the answer to that is probably yes, but obviously we were too mortified to do this, so just carried everything out as quickly and silently as possible, leaving them none the wiser. I still would have liked to have left one of the giant hyacinths behind just to imagine their reaction when they discovered it, mysteriously appeared in their hallway. The weird thing is (yes, there was only one weird thing about this anecdote in fact) was that I must have been pretty noisy bringing stuff in, and nobody in the house came to investigate. Strange but true. The lesson in this story is that even blossoms can cause trauma in particular circumstances, which is perhaps why a phobia of flowers isn’t as irrational as you might at first think. There’s a word for that by the way, in case you are putting together a pub quiz or anything – anthophobia. You’re welcome. See if you can drop that into a conversation at some point today. By the way, since googling this, my laptop has been over run with pop ups of where to buy flowers in full blossom RIGHT NOW – that’s not great if you were googling because you really were phobic is it. Stressful sort of phobia, hard to avoid methinks…\n\nAnyway, if you keep distracting me, I’ll never get to tell you all about Osterley parkrun. Suffice to say, I made it through though, we Sheffielders are tough! Besides, lots of unexpected delights accompanied my journey. Generally, radio 4, this always delights me (apart from just a minute, religious broadcasting, and, usually, the cloying smugness of ‘thought for the day’ but you know what,? Learn from me dear reader and cast aside your prejudices, because today en route to utterly o-stonishing Osterley parkrun I listened to Thought for the day, and – get this – parkrun got a mention! Martin Wroe – writer and journalist contextualised his ponderings speculating on those getting ready for the London Marathon on Sunday by mentioning the 170 thousand people across Britain getting ready to take part in parkrun right now, of which I was one! He too ‘came out’ as a parkrunner, describing the sense of achievement on completing his first one, quietly proud and slightly bewildered – how did this happen? A sentiment I can most certainly relate to. How exciting. parkrun is mainstream now, and I think this is for the greater good. I may be chugging solo to a new parkrun, but I’m one in a 170,000 all doing the same thing. Isn’t that amazing!\n\nSatnav TW7 4RD, Jersey Road, took me through urban territory, and below alarmingly low flight paths as mahoosive planes came in to land at Heathrow. Well, I like to think these were all planned landings at the nearest airport, and not wayward joy-piloted Boeing 747s attempting to avoid detection by flying low enough to go under the radar. They looked close enough to touch. I was alarmed. Eventually, I arrived at a relatively grand entrance, surrounded by an old red brick wall. Nice.\n\nFYI, the satnav wanted me to turn right here, but I threw caution to the wind and went straight on through. It’s impressive, not quite as impressive as the entrance to Lyme Park parkrun, but pretty good. I do like a drive way with acres of horse-filled paddocks on either side, and with mature trees a-plenty to provide an avenue of shade. I was so early, there wasn’t any evidence of other parkrunners, but the venue was epic and plenty of time to locate the start.\n\nOoooh, this is looking really very nice, very nice indeed.\n\nThe drive also had savage inverted speed bumps. See those innocent looking cobble stripes? They are in fact sunken pits that will rattle you car to its core. Treat with disrespect at your peril. Don’t look down. One wannabe parkrunner did just that a few weeks back, and he’s still trying to make his way back up by the look of things…\n\nI arrived super early, of course, and parked up in the National Trust car park. Oooh, National Trust, that’s good. Even more surprised this parkrun had previously evaded my parkrun radar. You don’t have to pay for parking if you display your barcode apparently, but to be fair, there was no-one at the car park booth to take payment, so I think you’d possibly be OK without, but I didn’t risk it. I always have a squillion spare barcodes about my person and conveyance to parkrun too, for just such eventualities.\n\nIt was cold, but I was early enough to head off to explore. Found a handy sign:\n\nHeaded off towards the house, bravely side-stepping the posse of pigeons. I like birds, but these seemed vaguely sinister, they had an air of entitlement, which I wasn’t about to test. They weren’t giving ground to anyone. Later I saw the bird that had perhaps inspired them to hold their territory, and I concede freely, they’d learned from the best. Indistinguishable from one another those avian cousins. It’s all about attitude at the end of the day. Believe you are indomitable and a winner, and command all you survey, and it shall be so! Well, so the theory goes and the photographic evidence suggests it can help you up to a point.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIt was exciting approaching the start of the run. It was good going to an unknown venue with zero expectations, as everything was like a grand reveal. First off, the lake, blooming epic!\n\nThere was a teasing glimpse of the house the other side. Huge mature trees of gorgeous spreading branches graced the beautifully landscaped space. Even the ducks were upmarket, some stunning mandolin Mandorin ducks were strutting their funky stuff.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIn amongst the lilies were the first ducklings I’ve seen this year. Super cute. Now generally, as I don’t have children myself, I try to never pass comment on the parenting skills of others, but the mallard mum had got out onto the edge of the lake, leaving her youngsters squawking a foot beneath the vertical edge on which she was standing. I was a bit worried, they had no way of getting out, and I remember seeing ducklings drown in similar circumstances. I’ll spare you that story as we really do need to crack on… I decided against intervention, they’d have to work it out, as I presume they eventually did. Disappointing though, I do love a duck, and they have strong protective instincts with respect to their young, but unfortunately, seem not to be blessed with great spatial awareness or problem solving skills. I empathise. Cute though.\n\nSo on and on I went, round the lake, it was distinctly nippy, also wet. Wasn’t expecting wet. Eventually, the house came into view and let me tell you this for nothing – Osterley park and house is pretty goddarned amazing! No wonder it gets used as a film location. Impressive doesn’t quite do it justice, it was like stumbling across the Bradenburg Gate – never seen so many pillars and steps! Compare and contrast if you will. See, practically indistinguishable!\n\nI remembered vaguely that the run starts and finishes by the house, and it is quite a rendezvous point. There wasn’t much sign of parkrun life, but a give away wheelie bin was in evidence, and one or too early birds in high viz commencing the set up. I felt a bit self-conscious, I was so early I felt I ought to offer to help set up, but it’s awkward as a tourist because obviously you don’t know the route and there is the potential that you will be more hindrance than help if you rock up unannounced. Good work though hi-viz heroes!\n\nInstead I just asked for directions to the loo. Well, ultimately my need for a precautionary pee took precedence.\n\nMy regular reader will know I put considerable store by pre-parkrun toilet facilities. You will therefore be mightily relieved (as was I, literally and metaphorically) to hear that I declare the Osterley parkrun precautionary pee facilities to be outstanding. They didn’t just exist and were open, and had toilet paper and all of that, but check out this as an entrance view:\n\nand this as an exit view:\n\nSeriously classy, it is far more landscaped than the entrance to my own front door, and considerably raises the bar for toileting facilities at parkruns elsewhere. In future, I expect all my ablution areas to be contained with perfectly shaped topiary. I had no idea what I’d been missing out on up until this point. It may be true that you don’t miss what you’ve never had, but it is also true that there’s no putting the proverbial cat back in the bag once it’s out. Mandatory topiary for public toilet blocks has to be the way forward.\n\nThe interior looked like this:\n\nNo, I wasn’t ever going to go for quite that much of an interior in-situ shot, I’m not completely dis-inhibited, not yet anyway. Don’t you think every home should have a solid gold toilet, no wonder they have recently installed one at Blenheim. No more bizarre than having five foot hyacinths, in fact the features would complement each other rather well now I come to think about it.\n\nImpressed and relieved, I decided to head back to the car in search of a running jacket. As I passed the steps a huge gust of wind sent the parkrun kit flying everywhere, it was like a re-enactment of that famous Odessa Steps sequence. I made an attempt to help with the retrieve, but the high viz heroes were already on it, I’m guessing this may have happened before – not with a pram, but maybe with the instruction folder and parkrun signage…\n\nI headed back to the car in search of some extra clothes and money for post run refreshments. It was nice to have a bit of an explore, find a pony to gaze at and discover a marshal now on car park duty, pointing cars to another lesser used, but equally convenient car park. I asked if I was ok where I was, at the main one, and that was fine apparently. Oh good.\n\nI was back to the house again in time to see the finish funnel being set up – that looked like quite a work out, bending down to put out each and every cone at lightning speed.\n\nSoon other parkrunners were beginning to arrive. The atmosphere was building, parkrun would soon be go! The steps up to the house provided a great vantage point from which to survey the action. It was fun people watching, though those steps are pretty vertiginous. And the hi-viz heroes did look exceptionally busy and important. I always thought that was a consequence of the high viz (entry level importance) enhanced by the addition of a clip board and peaking when in possession of a loudspeaker. In fact, it seems the gold standard is met by standing on the top of a humungous flight of steps, that confers absolute authority, it’s why that big bird pictured earlier was clearly not to be messed with.\n\nAfter a bit, there was a gathering for the first timers briefing. There were a few first time ever at parkrun people. Wow, their Saturdays will never be the same again, how exciting to be on the cusp of absolute change. Also some fellow tourists, some donning the cow cowls. I didn’t wear mine. Not an absolute oversight, but possibly an over-reaction to last time I wore one down here at Kingston parkrun some weeks back. A friendly fellow tourist came over to say hello but I’d had a stressful and traumatic few days, and a night entirely devoid of sleep. Consequently, I was sitting shivering on a bench, mid snot-producing sob due to emotional overload and exhaustion, and could hardly speak. Consequently, I probably came across as quite unfriendly which is not the cow cowl way. I thought I’d let myself go under the radar more here, just in case, although, with the benefit of hindsight, taking loads of photos is a bit of a giveaway that you are a newbie at a venue, though that stimulated lots of friendly interaction without me becoming inappropriately tearful so that’s good.\n\nHere we are at the first timers’ briefing. They train up their marshals from youngsters at Osterley – excellent work!\n\nthen we were all calmly back down the steps in readiness for the start\n\nSome ambling and milling in anticipation of the Run Director’s briefing:\n\nRunners in position, a set of steps appeared for the RD, and the briefing was miked. Excellent. I found it hard to judge the numbers, but around 300 were there in fact. It was all very orderly. Cheers for milestone runners, good luck wishes to marathon runners for tomorrow, this parkrun has a lovely vibe. If it was your local, I’m sure you’d get to know people really quickly, it felt friendly, well organised, and sported a good cross section of participants too. It felt a lot more diverse and inclusive than some of the others I’ve been too. I don’t know if that’s to do with the catchment area, probably, but it has to be also to do with it having a welcoming ethos I’m sure.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI met a couple of ebullient tourists, who were up for being photographed, so that was nice (wave) this was but a preparatory introduction preceding properly getting acquainted later on. I can’t talk and run, so rarely befriend new people during a parkrun, though it’s not entirely unprecedented either. Even so, good to swap friendly greetings and chit chat at the start line, it makes for a more companionable experience all round.\n\nThe start seemed to come suddenly. We were awf.\n\nIt’s two laps, well marshalled, and it is indeed on tarmac paths, but oh my, the route is lovely! I’m afraid my photos just don’t do it justice, well, it was quite an overcast day and taking photographs isn’t really my forte, nor is running, nor are most things, I’m hoping I’m a late developer and will stumble on my forte eventually, though time is running out for me to be able to make the most of it should any as yet untapped talent finally make itself known to me…\n\nYou pass by mature hedges, get glimpses of impressive cows, through a little bit of woodland, past lake, and pastures, all sorts really! Inevitably, the first lap was something of a blur as you encounter things for the first time. It didn’t feel crowded, the running surface was good. There was a weird moment when you could hear traffic from the motorway on the left hand side, but see rural loveliness if you kept your eyes right – and the backs of departing parkrunners ahead of course, as always. It does feel like a patch of green rural idyll oasis in the midst of what is basically urban sprawl. Friendly marshals pointed and clapped and other spectators stood and cheered enthusiastic encouragement too, which was rather fine. You know what, unusually for me, I’m going to let the pictures do the talking… There are a lot of pictures, and if each is worth a thousand words, that’s quite a lot of chit chat going on below.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI tried to take a snapshot of every marshal I passed, mixed success perhaps, but let’s try to remember it’s the thought that counts!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nInevitably faster runners lapped me towards the end of the first lap. Some were super speedy indeed,\n\nYou pass the finish funnel at the end of the first lap, so I paused to get some pics of the early finishers. It really is such a spectacular location, it raises the tone of the entire gathering. It felt more like a pop-up running festival than a conventional parkrun!\n\nThe second lap, it all thinned out, and I took time to admire the cows – no idea what sort they were, but they looked splendid:\n\nI was flagging a bit, I’m just not running regularly at the moment and it does make a difference. Surely the second lap couldn’t be longer than the first? They hadn’t had time to add anything. Could have been worse though, might have been running on a treadmill with a dubious distance registering GPS. That was on the news on Saturday as well. Fitness trackers can add miles to your marathon – up to 10.8 miles apparently, if you are running on a treadmill. That is astonishing, but then who wants to run on a treadmill anyway? You’d have to be desperate surely. For me, the entire point of running is to get to new places, the thought of running on the spot, makes me shudder, and can you imagine that, doing, an extra inadvertent and unacknowledged 10.8 miles! That’s three and a bit extra parkruns – and you wouldn’t even get to brag about it on Strava afterwards presumably. That’s a whole new level of pointlessness.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIn a break with my usual conventions, I did get chatting with another super friendly runner and Osterley parkrun regular towards the end of the second lap. She was really knowledgeable about the history of the house, which I now can’t remember, but was impressive at the time. Somewhat embarrassingly I would suggest, the history of Osterley Park House seems to be covered rather better on Wikipedia than on the National Trust’s own site about Osterley House – maybe I was looking in the wrong place. Neither account was as informative, personalised and entertaining as this parkrunner’s though, plus she could say which films it has appeared in – interior shots for one of the more recent batman films being but one, because Osterley House has its own batcave entrance. Hurrah! The upshot is, if you really want to know the history of this place, look out for this runner and stick with her.\n\nWe even ended up crossing the line together, what with us now being new best friends and everything. Thank you lovely fellow parkrunner. Unfortunately, despite saying I’d join her for coffee I lost her, becoming distracted by chatting to other parkrunners and confused by the tearoom logistics, but more of this later.\n\nStill plenty of support for the second lap – including a parkrun tourist who’d already finished coming back to cheer his other half home.\n\nI lingered round the finish funnel to cheer in the fun factory at the back, child labour was still in evidence here, dishing out chocolates to finishers in this extra role. I’m not sure what it comes under on the volunteer rota ‘other’ probably, though surely it’s only a matter of time before all parkruns include ‘sweetmeats dispenser’ as a core role on their rotas. Always room for innovation as parkrun evolves. It’ll soon be like having a photographer volunteer role, future parkrunners will be astonished it wasn’t a given from the outset. Granted, it takes a special sort of parkrunner to take on such a role, so it can’t always be guaranteed, but it is there as a vacuum abhorred by nature and seeking to be filled if someone is sufficiently gifted, willing and able to step forward for the task. I wonder what the chrome extension running challenges badge for that would be. Extra splendid and much coveted I’m sure.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI then trotted up the steps again, partly to retrieve my bag – left under the cover of the colonnade whilst running – and partly to try and get some atmospheric, beautifully framed finish shots. Unfortunately, my dreams were a bit beyond my capabilities. You get the gist though… maybe it will inspire some ‘proper’ photographers to drop by and show us how it’s done! Honestly, I’m embarrassed by how poorly my photos have come out, it is such a gorgeous location, one of my favourites so far. Granted, it doesn’t have the wild feel of my preferred locations, but the unexpected country estate splendour of this place cannot be over stated.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nBack down the steps and to the finish line, in time to see this amazing couple finish.\n\nThey are Osterley parkrun regulars and we had a good chat, they shared their considerable running wisdom, and how running with the wheelchair at parkrun lets them share quality time together each week. We talked about lots of things, what parkrun means to us, and I explained about my mum and Elisabeth’s corner at Bushy parkrun and how emotional I feel about what parkrun does for individuals and communities which goes way, way beyond providing an opportunity to go for a run with your mates. However, the point I remember most clearly, and indeed cling to, is that the gent sporting the 500 milestone tee and pushing his sporting wife, shared with me that he got his last pb at the age of 72. I’m a mere stripling at 54, a veritable youngster with almost two decades in hand before I need to worry about never again getting a pb. This was really encouraging, I’ve barely started, and everyone knows you don’t want to peak too soon. Much better to build slowly and steadily. After all, did you know that the oldest female runner in the London marathon, Eileen Noble didn’t start running til her fifties , so I’m well on target for improving my performance and it’s perfectly possible I too will peak with a new and final pb aged 72. Hurrah! Good to know, she’s 84 now, and London this year was her 19th marathon. I’ve done London once, so got years in hand before I knock out my next 18 between now and when I’m 84. Once again I learn, it is indeed all about attitude! I can do this. My future running successes all lie ahead of me, and they may be unexpectedly epic! Tautology or not, good to know. First though, coffee and cake.\n\nLovely as the location was, and exciting as my parkrun progress had been, I was lured away from the chill of the outside by the prospect of coffee. Now, this was a further conundrum, and explains how I so rudely lost sight of my running buddy. You see, the thing about this place is that it is a two cafe venue. Yep. You read that right, there are not one, but two coffee places, right next to each other. With the benefit of hindsight, I think that one does more cooked breakfasts and ‘proper’ food, whereas the other specialises in quick coffee and cake. I went to the latter, because the queue was shorter, and I’d been reunited with the cow cowl wearing tourists from early on so we decided to sup caffeine together. I couldn’t see my new best friend, so maybe she was in the other place, or maybe she’d been and gone by the time I’d done all my faffing. Sorry about that though, the conversation that might have been, didn’t mean to be rude…\n\nInside the coffee place, was a counter of delights in which the truly disinhibited might cheerfully have face planted. I settled for a photo.\n\nI say I settled for a photo, but actually I had a latte and a cheese scone.\n\nI joined my new friends for parkrun debrief. They were experienced tourists with many a tale to tell, so it was most educational and enlightening. Always good to meet a tourist, especially when I discovered they set up their own parkrun Tourism Journey Facebook page which is another cheery space to swap parkrun tales. They also took the obligatory parkrun selfie of the three of us, so that’s good. Not seen it yet, but one day maybe.\n\n*STOP PRESS* – here it is, the selfie pic:\n\nI know, pretty special aren’t we? Individually as well as collectively gorgeous and sharing the parkrun lurve!\n\nWe swapped parkrun claims to fame – I milked being related to my mum (obvs) but I think they won for having used the same toilet cubicle at Mr S-H himself during a parkrun ambassadors conference at Warwick. Not at the same time I hasten to add, and no documentary evidence was provided, but you wouldn’t lie about a thing like that would you? Surely not. But think about that for a moment, it means his buttocks have been caressed by the same plastic toilet seat that previously caressed those of parkrun royalty! I know. Amazing the doors parkrun has opened to us.\n\nWe also shared enthusiasm for the National Trust. I never dreamed in my youth there would come a day when I’d aspire to membership of the National Trust, but now I do. It just goes to show that life doesn’t always take you in the direction you expect, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Recently I discovered a friend of mind got given life time membership of the national trust for her fortieth birthday from a very generous relative, and I actually felt a flicker of jealousy flash before me! How times change. One day I’ll get around to joining!\n\nInevitably, the time came when we had to say our goodbyes and go our separate ways. It was hard to tear ourselves away but not as hard as it was for this runner to cross the line of the London marathon. I don’t think it’s an absolute that you shouldn’t laugh at the misfortune of others, surely it’s OK to have a little chortle at this as it ended well and he got extra sponsorship money too. Well, I say it ended well, but it depends where the story ends. He crossed the finish, and then someone stole his costume later. That isn’t funny. Time called on Big Ben costume – mind you, someone is trying to fleece Piers Morgan as a condition of returning it, so that’s a dilemma I don’t generally approve of blackmail, but moral positions aren’t always that clear cut. Anyways, let’s not dwell on that, let’s enjoy this again instead:\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-48084878\n\nand that was that, quietly proud and slightly bewildered at another parkrun done and dusted, it was but a leisurely walk back to the carparks and a parting of our ways… ’til next time only. There’s always a next time!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIn summary then, it was Oooh, Osterley was ostonishingly good. Thank you lovely parkrunners, organisers, tourists, supporters and all for a lovely welcome at a gorgeous venue. Very impressive.\n\nAny cons at all then you ask? Erm, not really, not that I can think of – only that if you have anthophobia, you should probably avoid Osterley parkrun at this time of year and beyond as there was a lot of wisteria in full flower, and I think if it’s well cared for – as was this – you can get more than one flowering a year. that’s a lot of blossom lurking. Just so you know 🙂\n\nWherever you are heading for your next running fix, have fun, remember all running is awesome, it’s all in the attitude and mindset, not in the actual speed.\n\n🙂\n\nIncidentally, parkrun uk did a profile of Osterley parkrun back in March 2018, looks like they had a slightly different finish then and also that on at least one occasion there were dinosaurs on the course. Splendid and good to know.\n\nFor all my parkrun related posts click here. Or don’t. It’s up to you. You’ll need to scroll down for older entries though.\n\n*may not have been Ibsen – it was a very long time ago, be fair.\n\nDigested read: went to Lyme park parkrun, it was delightful, thank you for asking.\n\nUndigested read:\n\nYes, you do get dizzy with delight at the beauty of it all, but you might also feel a bit dizzy with less than delight if you set off too fast up that hill at the start. More of this later. Let’s start at the very beginning, as that’s well-known as being a very good place to start.\n\nLyme Park parkrun has been on my parkrun ‘to do’ list for ages and ages. I did toy with the idea of doing it for my 200th run, but didn’t in the end, for reasons I can’t be bothered to elaborate on. I felt like it ought to be saved for a special occasion, given the rave reports that echo outwards from its epicentre of parkrun gloriousness. It’s beauty is legendary, the steepness of its start a marvel even to those of us who hail from Sheffield and think we know all about hilly parkruns, and the post run coffee options classy – it’s hosted at the National Trust property Lyme Park after all. Also, a one-lapper, my favourite type of run, and they are few and far between. What’s not to like? The only down side is that it’s also quite a long way for me, and not really a route to drive in winter, well not for the lily-livered likes of me at least, so you have to pick the right day to go. You can do this by ripping the innards out of a chicken and consulting The Oracle – not the premier Berkshire shopping destination, but the one at Delphi, which I understand has a more reliable track record in predicting the future depending on what you make of the ancient classics. If like me, you don’t live in Greece and are vegetarian anyway, as an alternative you can just check the weather forecast on the BBC website. Whatever, for me the weather forecast runes looked good. Even so, heading off to Lyme Park parkrun this morning was a bit of a last-minute call. My running is so lamentable at the moment I feel more comfortable heading off to new parkruns where I can run (I use the term loosely) without any pressure by being anonymous. I did consider going to Penistone parkrun, which had its inaugural today, but then felt they may prefer a low profile start – they don’t seem to have a Facebook page as yet, so I took that to mean they might be trying to stay under the radar – also, no loos at Penistone, maybe I should work on my pelvic floor for a bit before making the pilgrimage to that one, so all in all, I’ll save that for another time. Last night, I just decided, ‘why not Lyme Park parkrun?’ and why not indeed? (rhetorical question, there is no reason why not at all that could keep me from it!) I charged up my sat nav and laid out my cow cowl in eager anticipation. I would make it so.\n\nI had a terrible night’s sleep. I have completely lost the ability to slumber it seems. If I could choose a super power it would be to be able to sleep at will. Oh well, on the plus side, at least I was wide awake from about 4.00 a.m. so no worries about running late in the morning, only about actually potentially being expected to run, though parkrun is for all of course, walk, run, jog or – as in my case – walk/run/gaze about taking photos – all welcome.\n\nUp, porridge, tea, arm out of the upstairs window revealed it was blooming cold, and blinking out there was actual frost on the grass and even ice on the car’s rear windscreen! Well, I didn’t order that. There was also the most glorious pink sunrise and a sky full of promise for a bright sunshiney day. Hurrah!\n\nThe drive out to Lyme Park was beyond stunning. I’ve been away from the Peaks for a while lately, and it’s ages since I’ve headed out through Hathersage, Hope and beyond to Winnats Pass. Before I even got that far I thought my head would explode with the fabulousness of the views. It was just stunning, completely perfect in morning sunshine. I couldn’t capture it on film, but that didn’t stop me pulling over and having a bash\n\nyou had to be there really. The light was perfect. It was hard not to be distracted by the scenery, it made me long to get back out and explore these fantastic open spaces we are so lucky to have on our doorstep from Sheffield. Not today though, today I was passing on through. When I got to Winnats Pass I thought my heart would burst. I remember the first time I discovered this place, after relocating to Sheffield and I could hardly process what an extraordinary landscape was unfolding in front of me, it’s beyond comprehension really, when you see it without any advance warning, but even now I know what’s coming it remains amazing. When I was driving back home later on this morning along the same route, there was a car coming up the other way and whilst the driver was resolutely focused on the road ahead, the passengers were lent out of the car windows at waist height, brandishing their mobile phones like tourists on safari, compelled to remain in their vehicle but desperate to capture on film the astonishing and unbelievable vision of the landscape in front of them. Africa may have its lions, but the Peak District has geography to make your eyes pop just as much. Go see for yourself.\n\nIt was a bit heart thumping going up it in my little automatic car though. I always worry it won’t quite make it up the hill, to be fair, this wasn’t the only time today I worried my carcass would never reach the summit of a steep incline. Worth it though, on all occasions. And I did make it too.\n\nI drove past the heading off point for Mam Tor – not been there since the Mend Our Mountains sojourn, must get out and do that romp again in daylight this time. Not my picture, but if you want a taster, this is what it looked like in the setting sun – not too shabby eh? Not my photo, obvs. Embarrassingly, I’m not sure who took it, think it was an ‘official’ one. Thanks lovely photographer for sharing, whoever you were.\n\nIt was a bit over an hour to get to Lyme Park, and it was very straightforward, apart from me being a scaredy-cat on the steep hills. I wouldn’t attempt driving there in icy conditions. There is a sharp, but well-signed turning off the A6, and you go through some incredibly grand gates that will either make you feel you were – or should have been – born for this, or that you are trespassing. I felt like I was trespassing.\n\nand that pic isn’t even the proper gate, but the extra mini one after you’ve turned off. The drive to the actual house goes on for miles and miles, literally, not just metaphorically. Top tip, if you are being dropped off for this parkrun, don’t wave away your ride cheerily at the gatehouse saying ‘it’s fine, I’ll walk from here‘ unless you are either a speedy and experienced ultra runner, or don’t mind delaying your Lyme Park parkrun until the following Saturday, you’d never make it to the start line in time.\n\nI chugged down the driveway, and then there’s a little hut, where, once the park is officially open, you’d presumably have to stop and pay for parking. I’m not sure from when to be fair, but I was there about 8.30 ish and just cruised on by. Looked like if you were paying, it was cash only and right money preferred.\n\nOnwards, the park is jaw-droppingly lovely. I did pick the most gorgeous weather imaginable to attend though, the light backlit the trees and landscape spectacularly. I kept having to pause and wave my camera hopefully through the car windows to try and get some shots. Poor substitute for being there I know, but will give you a flavour of it perhaps?\n\nThere were hidden treasures lurking, mysterious towers on the horizon, tempting paths, weaving up through trees and over hills. Yep, so far the reports of the loveliness of Lyme would seem not to have been exaggerated.\n\nFinally, there is the house on the left, a kiosk, a scattering of hi-vis, and a pleasingly empty car park – though of course that meant I had to do the ‘where is the best place to park dance’ which is quite complicated and references my indecisiveness a bit too authentically. It’s factoring in how to get out later on when it’s full, as well as which is the best space to secure when empty. A complex equation I find. You will either relate to this or not. If you do, then your heart will bleed for me, too much choice, too challenging to decide, if you do not, then you will have to learn to live on with that sense of genuine bewilderment and incomprehension. I guess it’s like those puzzles which say can you see the elephant or whatever in this image and you either can or can’t and if you can’t it’s just beyond belief anyone sees otherwise. This isn’t an elephant though:\n\nActually, strictly speaking, it isn’t a duck or a rabbit either. You do know your art history I take it? This is not a pipe either….\n\nGlad we’ve cleared that up. Anyway, need to crack on, you’ll be wanting to know about the parkrun and I’m nowhere near describing that yet. Once parked, I went over to where the Run Director and team were gathered, adjacent to a closed refreshment kiosk and some parkrun arrows yet to be put into place to check out what was what.\n\nI established the star and finish were in different places, and that you could – depending on the RD – potentially leave a coat to be taken to the finish, though I decided to leave mine in the car in the end. Most importantly of all, I was directed to the loos. Just as I had thought my heart would burst from the beauty of the landscape en route to the event, now I’d arrived I thought my bladder would burst from the litres of tea I’d quaffed pre-departure. Fortunately, the National Trust have lots of loos. Hurrah!\n\nThey also had helpful signage about alternative names for dandelions, who knew? And a lake. And a tea rooms, and a National Trust gift shop, yet to open.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nPhew, much relief. Slight panic when I thought I’d picked a cubicle without loo paper, but worry not, it actually had not one, but two toilet roll dispensers, presumably to cater for exactly this eventuality – I do love National Trust hosted running events! I saw there was a Trust 10k sign up by the lake, so presume there is a Lyme Park Trust10, that would be epic!\n\nPrecautionary pee satisfactorily executed, I was able to have a bit of an amble about and check out my surroundings. Great selection of warning signs here – is it reassuring or alarming to know the tail walker has radio contact with HQ in case of emergency? Just not sure… and don’t get me started on the BE CAREFUL OUT THERE! It is bad for the nerves! I nearly had to go back for a second precautionary pee because of all the anticipatory excitement! Didn’t though. Need to practise running with my legs crossed in case I make it to Penistone.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThere were enthusiastic – or possibly lost – runners doing warm up loops, and marshals were heading out to their designated clapping and directional pointing spots, the event team were milling and coordinating and going about the busy and important tasks that keep the parkrun show on the proverbial road. It wouldn’t surprise me at all to hear one of them at least was in possession of a clipboard, that’s how busy and important they looked! Friendly and welcoming too though, you’ll be glad but unsurprised to hear, it is the parkrun way 🙂 .\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAs 9.00 a.m. drew near, people started to migrate towards the starting gate, which was at the bottom of a rather upward flat section. Gulp. The gathering commenced.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nNow would probably be a good time to describe the course to you, as it’s a well known fact I can’t talk and run at the same time, so it’ll be hard for me to properly tell you about it once I get going. The Lyme Park parkrun website blah de blah describes the course thus:\n\nCourse Description – Breathtaking. Literally!\n\nLyme Park parkrun begins towards the back of the main car park – the open gate marking the start line. The first uphill section (almost exactly 800m) is tough, narrow and loose under foot, however your perseverance will immediately be rewarded as you pass through a second open gate into the woods, which is rich in colour, but more importantly, flat! As you pass under the trees and along this next section, you will reach a second open gate where you should turn 90 degrees to your left. This narrow trail runs parallel with the park wall and is gently undulated and highlighted with small crossing streams. Glance to your right and you may be treated to your first deer sighting. At the end of this section, turn left again, through a third open gate and run straight ahead, passing the archery field on your right and through the final open gate. Please take extra care at this short part of the run, as you pass the staff car park on your left. Bear round to the right and follow the road until you spot the first large stone, turning left as you reach it, and head towards Lyme Park’s Cage. This huge open space with spectacular panoramic views of Manchester and beyond, will almost certainly give you perspective, and take your mind away from any aches or pains. Pass to the right of the Cage and head downwards over a rocky path, taking care to lift your feet on this loose (and unforgiving) terrain. As the path blends into the grass, it becomes very slippery and ends with a sharp turn to the left. Marshals will be ready to catch you at the bottom! Dig deep for this last section, a gradual incline awaits up to the finish line, a few hundred feet in front of the house, and in perfect situ to head off for a well-earned breakfast at the Timber Yard Coffee Shop\n\nand it looks like this:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nand Strava tells me that there is 496 feet of elevation, which doesn’t sound too bad to be fair, but in the doing of this parkrun, I did think I might bleed from my eyes at some point, so be warned.\n\nAssembled, next thing was the run briefing. Milestones various were acknowledged, this seemed a friendly parkrun with regular runners cheering each others various achievements. There was just the one celebrity runner, the Incredible Hulk, something must have made him mad as he was in his green, bulked up form, but fair does to him, whatever else he might have to contend with, the Hulk doesn’t skip leg days when working out. Good work.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIt was a brief briefing, and a refreshingly quiet and attentive parkrun crowd – though maybe they were saving their breath for that upward flat section starting out… and then it was awf, and awf we went, some with more enthusiasm than others!\n\nYou can’t really tell from the pictures, but the start is a bit of a shock. It’s a steep climb upwards for about 800 metres. You would get super fit if this was your regular parkrun. Spoiler alert, I failed to run all the way up the hill. I like to think this was because I was wanting to pause for photos en route, but I am well-known for harbouring self-serving delusions. Don’t mock me, it is this delusional thinking that allows me to return to parkrun week after week. A fair few people did opt to power walk as well, perhaps this is a known and legitimate run craft strategy and not a cop-out at all? Yes. I like to think it is, therefore henceforth, that is what it shall be. Strategy in action. Go us, but slowly, to save ourselves for the more forgiving inclines and genuinely flat bits!\n\nThere weren’t a massive amount of marshals on the course, it doesn’t really need that many, you can’t get lost, but the cheery support was welcome. I’d swear some of those marshals had the super-power of teleportation though, as they seemed to Pop up more than once along the way. Canny lot the Lyme Park parkrun crew…. Here are some, in all their glorious loveliness:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSo you go up a gravely roady bit, and through a foresty bit, and emerge onto a moorland bit and it undulates up and down and the views are a.maz.ing. FACT. I was, as ever, in the fun factory that is the rear of the pack. There were a fair few juniors embracing the event, which was quite motivating, as if they can do it on their little legs, I can do it on my little legs too. Granted, they aren’t carrying the same tonnage, but equally, they have less idea of what they have signed up to. Maybe ignorance is indeed bliss sometimes, it’s so hard to be sure…\n\nThis is definitely one of the toughest parkruns I’ve done to date, but also one of the most beautiful. It would probably be quite brutal in snow and ice, but it was blooming lovely today, despite it being pretty nippy out. After a bit, you are directed off to cake!\n\nOh hang on, no, not cake, cage. Rookie error. I have no idea why the folly, or castle or cage or whatever it is. A hunting lodge according to google…. it does look a bit like the Tower or London, and to be honest, it wouldn’t have surprised me at all to learn we’d run that far as it was hard going up that hill, as well as being pretty breezy up top! Still, you are rewarded with the most amazing views, and it’s amazing what you can put up with given an incentive like that to keep on going.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nPast the cage, and there was a lovely down hill where you could be an aeroplane if you wished on the way down. More marshals were in position by trees and with a succession of rather cute canine companions. There was also a high vis clad horse rider, I’m thinking that was just a coincidence, rather than a crowd control measure unique to Lyme whereby they have a mounted marshal/police presence just to be on the safe side.\n\nThe downhill bit continues, and then you have to curve round towards the left towards the final finish stretch (don’t get too excited, it goes up again before going down). Here, I induced panic in the marshal at his station, as I veered to the right to get a shot of him in situ leading him to think there was a navigational emergency unfolding before his very eyes. He shouted and waved at me with not a little desperation. It’s good to know marshals take their directional pointing responsibilities so seriously, thank you my hi-vis friends for your vigilance as well as diligence on course today! Also, in my humble opinion, best bobble hat of the morning too, although that award brings with it only kudos, no other acknowledgement as such, you’ll have to make do with the warm glow of recognition I’m afraid.\n\nOnce I’d cornered successfully, it was past the plastic cone mine (or possibly resting place, I’m not sure).\n\nOn the summit behind, you could just make out the tail walkers and marshals standing down from their posts:\n\nahead, parkrunners ran on, the finish funnel within their reach…\n\nand just when your morale was beginning to sap, a further sign of encouragement, literal as well as metaphorical – I do love it when parkruns have their own personalised signs, it’s cheering!\n\nand even better, it was actually true! You are nearly there, just a few metres round the corner, the finish funnel came into view, and you run into the warm embrace of a flurry of timers and funnel managers and finish token giver outers and barcode scanners. Hurrah!\n\nand so it ends.\n\nI lingered to watch the tail come in – didn’t have to linger very long to be fair…\n\nand you know what was especially heartwarming, to see the hi vis heroes jumping for joy. And why not, volunteering at parkrun is fab fun. Didn’t quite get him airborne, but this picture potentially has more comedic value, so every cloud eh? Just realised, do those plastic cones match the bobble hat stripes? Methinks they might.\n\nand that was that.\n\nLyme Park parkrun done.\n\nI ambled back to the car, trying to get some atmospheric pics en route, along with the obligatory slightly awkward selfie. Where is Smiley Selfie Queen when I need her?\n\nWe definitely had the best part of the day for the run, as it was getting decidedly nippy by this point. As it was a long drive back, I stopped off at the cafe for a veggie egg and sausage sandwich and a latte. Service was friendly but slow, presumably because they had to go and get a hen to lay an egg for me before they could cook it. However, that was fine, as queuing is an impromptu opportunity for parkrun socialising. I met a fell devil runner who is also doing Round Sheffield Run in a few weeks time – note to self, I should train for that probably, and also was able to see the RD again, and marvel about the wonders of the Lyme Park venue, which I could confirm in person, most definitely had lived up to its most excellent reputation. It is definitely ‘undulating’ though, and I run in Sheffield. Just saying.\n\nMind you, it’s not as tough as the Marathon des Sables, and a dog just finished that, so perhaps we can all do more than we realise if we are but motivated enough, and we runners are mightily easily led by the prospect of a fine bit of bling… This is most certainly a dog that’s finally had its day!\n\nIt really is exceedingly fine. You should try it sometime. Best try to manage your expectations about the stately home actually levitating on the lake though, I mean it is very spectacular indeed, but there are limits.\n\nSo once again, thank you parkrunners and parkfunners all in general and Lyme Park parkrunners in particular. It was reet nice oot. I’d love to come back some time soon.\n\nFor all my parkrun related posts click here. Or don’t. It’s up to you. You’ll need to scroll down for older entries though. Bit of a time vampire, if you do, you might be stuck on the sofa for a while, ‘just researching options’. Hmm.\n\nHappy running in general and parkrunning in particular until next time. I wonder what parkrun delights next Saturday will bring.\n\n🙂\n\nDigested read: back to the Longshaw Trust 10k (Trust10). Misty start, sunny finish. Very nice to be back.\n\nUndigested read:\n\nEverybody loves Longshaw. Well they should do. Just look at it, it’s spectacular, whatever the season.\n\nWe all need to reboot our systems now and again don’t we? Don’t we? Please don’t let on it really is just me? Oh you were kidding, it isn’t just me who gets a bit ground down now and again and needs to be reminded to look up and out and breath in the air. That’s good, otherwise you’ll have no idea what I’m banging on about and that will make for a very confusing mismatch in our conversation, and nobody wants that.\n\nSo, Sunday morning. Now normally Sunday is junior parkrun day, and I do really love junior parkrun, supercharged fun however you look at it, especially at my local Graves junior parkrun where you get to run through the animal farm and by the lake and everything.\n\nHowever, fun as it is, I realised last year that I’d got out of the habit of going to the Longshaw Trust 10k. This is ridiculous, because I blooming love the Trust10, it’s always super friendly and welcoming and mostly ‘proper’ off road. I mean not completely hard-core, but enough to get your feet muddy and feel alive and a very long way from the grind of running on pavements or tarmac.\n\nAnyway, longshaw story short, I’ve decided to try to prioritise the Longshaw 10k a bit more this year, after all I can still do junior parkrun the other three weeks of the month (the Longshaw 10k takes place on the fourth Sunday of each month- check website just in case, but that’s worked so far, snow and ice permitting). This morning, it being the fourth Sunday of the month, Longshaw it would be.\n\nThe website says succinctly:\n\nEnjoy a 10k run in the special surroundings of the Longshaw Estate. Free, informal and for everyone\n\nadding\n\nJoin us on the fourth Sunday of the month for our free 10k run. Registration is on the day 8.15 in the café, and the run starts at 9 am. A number will be issued to you at your first run.\n\nThe route is two laps, and takes in some wide paths and some more technical off-road sections on grass, rocks and sometimes muddy ground. It is suitable for runners of all abilities.\n\nTiming will be via paper and stopwatches, so if your time is important to you please use your own system.\n\nso that’s all you really need to know, you could just finish here, I wont know, I haven’t a clue if anyone ever reads my posts or not, so no offence taken. Also, you might have a life to lead, places to go, people to see, whatever. I don’t do concise though, so I’m not prepared to leave this account at that, read on at your own risk. Maybe have a precautionary pee first, and pour yourself a mug of tea or glass of wine in readiness. You’ll need something with which to fortify yourself if you intend to stick with me for the long run. Not that Longshaw is especially long by everyone’s standards, but I’ll make it feel long for you. It’s a 10k route, but two 5k laps, so if you are unsure you could always do one loop and then bail finish at that point. You’ll be at the front of the cafe queue and have seen the route. But you won’t get a time and you won’t know the fun you’ve missed out on by doing so. Your call though, nobody will judge you. Really they wont. In a good way, nobody cares what you do, as long as you are having a good time and stay safe. Think parkrun, it’s that sort of ethos. Good natured, celebrating what you do, and although there are definitely speedy runners pegging round at the front, there is nothing to stop you taking a more sedate romp round at the rear – as did I today.\n\nDespite everything, I did feel a little disloyal to be heading Longshaw way instead of to Graves. Also, it was freezing when I woke. Really misty, and was that even a bit of ice on the car? Possibly. It was like that at Graves parkrun yesterday, so misty you could hardly see your hand in front of your face on arrival, but then it did clear enough later on the second lap for an en route selfie with highland coo. Such selfies ought to be mandatory anyway at Graves parkrun, what’s the point of a parkrun going to all that effort of supplying highland coos if nobody bothers to do so, but it was made easier yesterday by dint of me being busy and important as tail walker for the day, no pressure to rush on by. Oh and also having a smart phone carrying selfie wannabee to accompany me, result. Hurrah! Fab walk and talk yesterday. I thank you. 🙂\n\nWhere was I? You’ve distracted me. Oh yeah, not at Graves, but heading to Longshaw. It was misty enough that I contemplated putting on my headlights, and cold enough that I considered wearing one of my deeply unflattering beanies. I thought the better of it, though on reflection, my pink Trust10 bobble hat would have been OK, it’s more forgiving than my cow bob and TpoT offerings. Too late, didn’t take one, wondered if I might regret it, blooming cold.\n\nI won’t lie, I’ve not been feeling the running lurve lately. My mojo has not so much temporarily departed as actually abandoned me leaving no forwarding address and only memories and dreams of what might have been. Despite this, I do sort of miss what we had, and it is slowly dawning on me, that astonishingly, the only way to get back my running form is to actually go out and do some running. Harsh, but true. Perhaps today would be the day.\n\nI arrived crazily early at Longshaw, got my self parked up in ‘my’ parking spot. Yes, I do have a favourite parking spot at Longshaw, doesn’t everyone? It was £3.50 for non National Trust members for up to four hours – was hoping that I wouldn’t take that long to get around, even allowing time for a fairly substantial cheese scone afterwards. You can park for free along the road outside the Fox House, but I suppose I feel paying for parking is a way of supporting the otherwise free event. Also, less far to retreat back to the car on days when it is so cold your legs won’t work. That might just be me though. You are probably so hard-core you’ll be incorporating the Longshaw Trust10 into your long run and jog out, run the 10k and run home again. Go you! Not me though, that wasn’t my plan, though I do have a bit of a fantasy that I might do that one day. Maybe when the weather is a bit warmer so I don’t have to worry about getting cold in between running legs.\n\nThe air was still, the car park already beginning to fill up, and the views, as always, just breathtaking. Of course my photos don’t do it justice, why would they? You’ll have to go check it out for yourself.\n\nKeenie volunteers had already put the little pink flags up to mark the way. I had my first precautionary pee of the morning. The bolt on the toilet door wasn’t working, but that didn’t matter as the queue for the loo is always so extensive, someone will look out for you. The gents of course just breezed past us, waving as they went to make free with their own more ample facilities. Structural injustice strikes again. I read a whole article about exactly this issue of why there are never enough female toilets (as in toilets for use by women, not for bathroom sanitation ware that identifies as female – I’m pretty sure most would be non-binary anyway), but now I can’t find it. Bet you are gutted. Worry not, I’ll add it in later if I do. Hang on, you’re OK, I’ve found it, great article on the deadly truth about a world built for men You’re welcome. Found this one on the American Potty Parity movement too, who knew? Having said that, compared to other running events, the provision at Longshaw is pretty darned good. Warm registration area, toilets- not just toilets, but ample toilet paper and hot running water too. Thrown in an informal bag drop, parking, and post run coffee and carb options and that covers everything really.\n\nHeaded in to the cafe area to register, my camera can’t cope with interior shots, but you’ll get the gist. First timers have to complete a registration form, returners, wearing their own reused numbers have a quicker process.\n\nIt’s all very self-explanatory and pretty slick, though the volume of participants these days does make for some good-natured queuing. That’s OK though, it’s a chance to catch up with everyone you’ve ever met in the running community of Sheffield. This event brings loads out of the woodwork. I went on my own, but bumped into many familiar faces. Grand.\n\nThe high vis heroes were discussing tactics, being efficient and heading off to their posts, some of which are a fair old hike away from the cafe area:\n\nHere they are en masse at the end. What a fine and photogenic lot they are. Hurrah for them. That’s not even all of them. It takes a lot of effort to keep the event running smoothly. (Pun intended, I’m super quick-witted like that – less quick on my feet unfortunately. Oh well, we can’t all be good at anything everything).\n\nRunners arrived and milled and chilled, some did some voluntary extra running, by way of warm up. Respect. Others did some voluntary extra running by way of sustainable transport options. Also respect:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe sun was beginning to peak through, and I started to see familiar faces from woodrun and even a few other break away-ers from Graves junior. It was like big reunion!\n\nIt was definitely still misty, but the day seemed full of promise. An air of eager anticipation started to build. It seemed busy to me, but then again, apart from the Christmas Tinsel Trust 10 I’ve hardly been to Longshaw Trust10 of late. I decided NOT to wear my coat, which is quite a big deal for me, as normally I have to have it forcibly wrestled away from me pre run. Now though, the air was still, and the runes seemed good. It was one of those days where you really get why ancient peoples worshipped the sun, it seemed miraculous how it began to appear and burned through the fog to reveal a glorious landscape of wonder and promise. In a bit though, not straight away.\n\nAfter a bit, there was a sort of collective move towards the start, as if drawn by a silent beacon, like in Close Encounters, only a lot jollier and with more visible Lycra. Honestly, I don’t know if Lycra was even a thing when the film Close Encounters came out in 1977, the Wikipedia entry inexplicably completely fails to mention it. This is the problem with becoming over reliant on search engines on the interweb, the entirety of human knowledge becomes reduced to dust.\n\nThe Devil’s Tower is pretty much indistinguishable from Carl Wark in my view, and you can only differentiate the assembling of runners from the assembly of the alien seekers by the presence of tarmac beneath the feet of the non runners. Spooky isn’t it?\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nOnce we were all assembled, more or less, bit of fraternising went on, I noticed the runderwear ambassador ingratiating herself to the tail walkers. Well, she was trying to communicate something important anyway. Also a few ill-advised selfies were taken alongside other reunions. You know, it occurs to me, maybe it isn’t the hats that make me spectacularly unphotogenic, maybe I actually look like this hatted or otherwise. Horrible thought. Oh well, this selfie is significant because the two of us have been Facebook stalking each others for some months but until this weekend never met, now two-day on the trot, yesterday Graves, today Longshaw. We’re properly best friends now! Clearly Smiley Selfie Queen has more experience in these matters, or maybe a more forgiving filter. I’ll never know… I was slightly disappointed to see she was no longer wearing her sash from yesterday, when she celebrated her 100th parkrun with cakeage+, bunnage+ and a sash proclaiming her achievement. Oh well. At least I saw her on the day.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nthere was the run briefing.\n\nTake care, be sensible, usual information about following marshals direction"
