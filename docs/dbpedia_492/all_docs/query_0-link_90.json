We also share the deep concerns of our community about the current treatment of migrants and asylum seekers, especially minors, at the U.S. – Mexico border, and deplore the use of family separation as a tool of immigration policy aimed at deterring people seeking safety. In supporting the social and emotional well-being of all our students, we commit to respect the human rights and civil liberties of all people, and condemn all hateful speech and violent action directed at any student or individual, including immigrants and people of color.\n\nResolution for the Protection of Children"
