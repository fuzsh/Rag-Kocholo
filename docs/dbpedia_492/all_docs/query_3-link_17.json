        "text": "Advertisements\n\nI hope j got to the \"Day of Fun\" today!\n\nCorvallis Ave is indeed within the garden district. For reasons never made known to me, Corvallis and Beaverton (small cities in Oregon) had streets in Cincinnati named for them. Then Lakeland is of course in Florida, and Shenandoah is a mountain range and not a town. Why ask why, though! Maybe somebody out there would also know who Robin and Scott, memorialized by streets with the suffix \"wood,\" were too.\n\nEvanston and Roselawn are worlds apart when it comes to nefarious activity, which brings me to my thumbnail sketches of the latter community's other two areas.\n\nSouth of Section Rd and east of Reading Rd lies one of the historically more middle-class portions of the neighborhood. Its anchors are the Roselawn Center Building (Reading/Section/Brookcrest block) and the recently closed Catholic church at Eastlawn Dr and Losantiville Ave. Brookcrest and Eastlawn run parallel to Reading Rd and are lined with brick-box and duplex apartment houses alternating with some single-families. The north/south sequence of streets goes like this: Blackwood (cul-de-sac), Glendon then Greenbriar then Larchwood (connecting Eastlawn and Brookcrest), then Bluefield (cul-de-sac at the former churchyard.) Most of the homes here were built between the waning of the Great Depression and soon after WWII. They're mainly perfectly nice, but unremarkable, Colonials (some split-level) and brick Cape Cods. Every residence on the market in this enclave is also dementedly priced, but reading between the lines one soon finds out that quite a few are fixer-uppers. What sometimes has been happening is that the longtime (if not original) owner of a house dies without having ever done updates, then the heirs want to unload the place. (I've seen real-estate ad photos of extinct appliances like gas-jet stoves and pull-chain toilets! ) A few of these properties have been on the market for years, evidenced by the pics of tall weeds growing out of spiderweb-cracked driveways. None of them are vandalized, but it'd take a heap o' cash to modernize them, and I find no fault with handypeople who decide to forsake a generic-looking house in favor of a Tudor or bungalow or Victorian. These empty homes may not be the sh--hole on Huron, but neither do they help the blocks they're situated on. In either (and any) vicinity it's never good to have a place like that on your street.\n\nThe sector which REALLY brings out the \"Woes Lawn\" is that which lies north of Summit Rd and west of Reading Rd. What were once \"respectable\" if not high-class (i.e. the Carrousel Inn) hotels/motels on Reading Rd have declined into dens of iniquity. The perpetrators of robbery, B & E's, and \"vice\" have long since expanded their territory into the brick boxes and faded apartment complexes lining Newbedford Ave, Stillwell Rd, and Crest Hills Ave. In the wee hours of a spring morning this year, a vacant brick box on Crest Hills and an abandoned complex on Newbedford were set ablaze. There've been several drug-trade-related homicides in a single apartment community known as the Sparkle (evidently now tarnished) Apartments. All of this has made the 1950's-60's-era neighborhood beyond these streets a place where one does NOT want to be. As is the case throughout Roselawn, the houses are well-kept if \"dated,\" but plenty of their inhabitants are itching to sell even at a loss. Like on Huron Ave, there are some blocks with multiple MLS listings that all carry unseemly price tags. (Yet another goyguy anecdote: A longtime friend of Mrs Goyguy Sr was determined to stay in her home in this neck of the woods, on Debonair Court, come h3ll or high water. The community had \"changed,\" but \"I have nice neighbors who look out for me\" and she longed to remain where she and her late husband had reared their children. Many deep discussions didn't sway her. Then one evening, she was being driven home when the ladies turned off Summit and soon happened upon a large loud street fight. After flooring it past the scene and arriving at her friend's driveway, Mrs GG Sr gave her friend one of her famous piercing no-nonsense looks in the eye and said, \"You've got to get out of here.\" She moved away within the year.)\n\nBut in the paradoxical way of every city, what happens north of Summit stays north of Summit. Word hits the street quickly as to where the easy targets for evildoing are, and areas where folks care for their property and each other aren't. Roselawn has begun to take part in CPOP, and also has a block watch program which boasts near-100% participation in the garden district. A new \"franchise\" of Good Guy Loiterning was launched this summer, wherein a self-selected group of citizens purposely hangs on a street corner for several hours. (In doing so they compel those on the other side of the law to take their business elsewhere.) None of this goes on in Evanston.\n\nInstead of my monopolizing this thread tangent, why not make direct contact with - for starters - the community council? There's phone and e-mail info on their Website, Roselawn Community Council.\n\nMr OP, you're welcome to bring up the other streets you're eyeing potential homes on - if you dare!\n\nPersonally, I don't think so from a safety standpoint. But the neighborhood elementary school (Roselawn/Condon on Summit) fares poorly in the rankings, as do the several charter schools serving the area. What dedicated urban pioneers/dwellers do is push to get their kids into the \"select\" magnet schools in town, namely North Avondale Montessori or Fairview in Clifton. That provides the better quality of formal education needed to pass the all-important Walnut Hills entrance exam.\n\nIt's also difficult for a five-year-old of any race to be greatly outnumbered by peers who don't \"look like them,\" and that only gets worse from year to year. Kids of course don't know prejudice, but their parents do. The social steering by my folks that I had to counteract when I reached adulthood had its roots in kindergarten. I didn't see anything wrong with befriending the handful of Black children in my class, or vice-versa, but the rest of the class did. And so did the teacher, who reported this to my then-uptight Southern-born mom and dad. The law was laid down - it would not be permitted for me to have any \"colored\" girls or boys over to play. Bewildering as this was to me, that stage of life isn't the one where your parents are questioned much less defied. Sad to say, similar such confrontations probably went on in many a household on both sides of the proverbial divide. And likely as not they still do. If jl winds up choosing an AA woman to be the mother of his children, that opens a whole 'nother can of worms in terms of peer pressures. Biracial kids have struggles of their own to face, though it has to be said that they'd have less of a hard time in a Black community.\n\nA goodly contingent of Caucasian city residents everywhere in the States opt out of so much as trying to connect the bright dots in their public education systems. They pursue the parochial/private school option instead. Oftentimes the price of the family home AND the cost of tuitions are still outweighed by what they would've paid for a similar or even inferior domicile in a suburb or \"better\" neighborhood. This has stopped being exclusive to the paler tribes, now, with AA professionals (some of them in Roselawn to be sure) holding the identical mindset. Low-caliber schools such as Roselawn/Condon aren't only stayed away from in droves by White people, they're also avoided by folks of any type who can afford to. A look at the stats for that and many other similar schools will reveal not only ethnic percentages out of kilter with the nearby community, but also a lopsided proportion of pupils on meal subsidies relative to the actual poverty level as a whole.\n\nUnequal education has prevented more communities from (re)gaining stability in Cincinnati and everywhere than crime has IMHO. jl is far from the first person even in C-D to \"fall in love with\" a house and its environment, and realize that the actual comfort level of the area is way higher than the media and \"popular opinion\" make it out to be - only to still walk away from relocating there upon finding out that the schools suck big time and 95-100% of the enrollment is \"minority\" (not to mention heavily \"disadvantaged\" economically.) With that run-on sentence I think I've at long last summed up the whole story of why a big brick Tudor house off Observatory Ave can command $450k or more while a near clone off Reading Rd goes begging at $150k or less.\n\nWoes Lawn is still a daaaamn sight better than Evanston, with all said and done.\n\nThat's why I befriended GG a long time ago. He is straight up. It has been interesting reading these posts in this thread.\n\nI find it simply amazing GG what you mentioned about how your folks warned you about black people. I myself, was raised different. My mom never gave us warning about to stay away from white kids or to avoid friendships with them.\n\nMy first 13 ys of life resided in different areas of Cincy. Walnut Hills,Bond Hills, 7th ave across from the old shilitoes (macy's ) building downtown, Garden Hills, North Fairmont. Springdale and Forest Park.\n\nLol as I look back man was there were up and downs at times. Funny thing we were always surround by white people at the times in those \"hoods or city\".\n\nSpringdale stuck out too me as I recall my first week of school there and how the little white boys were not to keen on this quiet black kid coming to their school. I was challenged at times. Made to feel like I was not to be there. Even though I had no say so in what school my Dad told me to attend.\n\nHeck I remember the lone black kids in the class was only 5 total with me. One particular girl made it her business to make sure I could never be made to feel part of the class. She was always cold to me as much as the little boys were too. And she just so happened to be black.\n\nI guess since I did not come up with the from k-6 I was not a part of them. One young girl claimed she hated I came there but things turned around by the end of the year kind of and she then turned around and wrote a nice saying in my year book. Took the sting off a bit.\n\nTrouble was not far also from growing up in so called black areas too. It makes me wonder though GG. Did that same sort of rearing of people's children still get taught even in my times in school int eh 70s and 80s.\n\nI remember when we \"integrated\" St.Boniface on the northside . Lol man was the residesnt and the kids in an uproar. The names we were called and the fighting was something to be seen then. Nothing like the mess that happened in Boston with the busing , but still uneasy.\n\nOh well just some random thoughts..."
