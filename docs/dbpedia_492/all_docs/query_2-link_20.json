        "text": "Family and friends gathered under a tent at Eastlawn Memorial Cemetery on Feb. 16, 2019 to grieve Lawrence Douglas \"Doby\" Williams. All too soon, they were shooed out of the Wichita County cemetery to make way for another funeral procession.\n\nHis mourners never saw a grave opened or the 65-year-old's casket lowered into it. To this day, they don't know the final resting place of the man renowned locally as the first African American quarterback at Wichita Falls High School.\n\nDoby helped propel the Coyotes to a 1969 state championship and went on to a college and NFL career before returning to his hometown.\n\n\"All I want to know is where my brother is buried so we can put a temporary cross on his grave until we get a permanent marker,\" Williams' sister, Wanda Mergerson, of Wichita Falls, said.\n\nBut no amount of telephone calls and messages from the family to those who've said they own the cemetery has yielded the information.\n\nTime and again, they've been put off or ignored, leaving friends and family to wander the graveyard over the course of the last year.\n\n\"We looked. We looked. We looked. Nothing,\" Mergerson said.\n\nShe stood in Eastlawn on a chilly February day recently, talking of promises made and broken to show her where the grave is or to put a small marker on it so she can find it.\n\n\"I am aware that was just a shell in a box, and he's not in there,\" Mergerson said. \"But still, you would like to have a place where you can go if you want to talk to him or if you want to put flowers on his grave.\"\n\nGraveyard worker: 'It's not my fault'\n\nAnother sister of Doby's, Diane Williams Walker of Arlington, said she waited two months for a phone call from a Wichita Falls couple, Tonya and Ronny Carew, who indicated to her they own the cemetery.\n\n\"We're getting the runaround,\" Walker said.\n\nDoes Tonya own Eastlawn?\n\n\"Not anymore. I mean, we bury people out there,\" she said when reached by cell phone in February. \"We're the ones that dig the graves. ... We take care of everything.\"\n\nMore: 1969 Coyotes are Wichita Falls' version of 'Remember the Titans'\n\nTonya said she had already talked to Doby's family and told them she'd be back in town Feb. 28 to show them his burial place.\n\nTonya said if his family members had put a headstone on his grave, they could find it.\n\n\"I can tell you exactly where my mom and dad are buried,\" she said.\n\nThey're not interred in Eastlawn, she said.\n\n\"I have nine people right now that are waiting on me to get back into town to mark their graves,\" Tonya said. \"This is a constant thing. It's not my fault.\"\n\nShe said she could understand it if 20 years later a family doesn't know where a loved one is buried â€” but a year later?\n\nTonya hung up the phone in response to a query as to who owns the graveyard now.\n\nConditions at Eastlawn Memorial Cemetery\n\nOver the decades, African American families have buried their kin in the small country cemetery near Iowa Park.\n\nSome bought plots decades ago, carefully making payments when the late Roger and Barbara Crampton owned it. Wichita County deed records show the Cramptons bought land for the cemetery in 1964.\n\nThe graveyard at the corner of Farm-to-Market Road 369 and Bacon Switch Road has also been a burial place for those unable to afford a more expensive plot.\n\nIn one section of the cemetery called \"the singles,\" graves seem almost jammed together. Behind this section are piles of dirt and swatches of high grass.\n\nDecorations placed to honor loved ones have ended up here and there, perhaps blown by the wind.\n\nDoby's family: 'It's just a big mess'\n\nDoby's niece, Dominica Christian, is disturbed about what she has heard about the cemetery's condition from Mergerson, her mother.\n\n\"It's just a big mess. He was my favorite uncle. He thought very highly of me because I spent 34 years in the Army,\" said Christian, a retired Army sergeant major living in Tucson, Ariz.\n\nShe believes the family might want a change.\n\n\"I think the family's intention is that once we locate him, we want to exhume him and put him somewhere else,\" she said.\n\nOn that recent February day, Mergerson stood at the entrance to the cemetery and looked doubtfully behind her.\n\n\"I'm not even sure he's buried out here,\" she said."
