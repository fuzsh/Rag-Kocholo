        "text": "Muslim Public Affairs Council condemns calls for National Guard to be deployed against protesters\n\nAmid arrests of pro-Palestine protesters across universities, the Muslim Public Affairs Council condemned calls for the deployment of the National Guard, saying the “crackdown on students with an overwhelming militaristic force has set a dangerous precedent for university administrations nationwide.”\n\nMPAC urged for a reevaluation of strategies used to handle protests on campuses across the country and says it advocates for “approaches that emphasize de-escalation and address students’ concerns through constructive means rather than force and intimidation.”\n\nIn a previous statement on Tuesday, MPAC accused the White House of having double standards for issuing a response condemning violence and physical intimidation against Jewish students at Columbia University, but says the administration “consistently fails to extend the same sentiments to students who face repeated violence, intimidation, doxing, and harassment for their pro-Palestinian advocacy.”\n\nUSC closes its main campus due to ongoing protests\n\nThe University Park Campus, the University of Southern California’s main campus, has been closed due to the ongoing protests, the university said in a statement.\n\nThe campus closure comes as Los Angeles Police Department officers started arresting protesters at the university.\n\nUniversity of Texas police send \"Notice of Dispersal Order\" to Austin students\n\nThe University of Texas Austin recently sent students an email alerting them that there was a “Notice of Dispersal Order” following a day of clashes and arrests on the campus.\n\nTexas Department of Public Safety said earlier that more than 20 people were arrested after the Palestine Solidarity Committee organized a walkout and occupation of the school’s South Lawn.\n\nThe demonstrations led to confrontations between police officers, state troopers and students.\n\nCAIR chapter in Austin condemns \"unnecessary and excessive force\" by officers arresting protesters\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations chapter in Austin, Texas, condemned “unnecessary and excessive force” used by police officers Wednesday to arrest students protesting the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nFayyaz Shah, board chair of CAIR Austin, said law enforcement should “exercise restraint and respect the rights of protesters.”\n\n“In a democratic society, the right to peacefully protest and express dissenting opinions is fundamental. The use of large numbers of heavily armed law enforcement officers to arrest student activists advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza represents a troubling suppression of these rights,” Shah said in a statement.\n\nShaimaa Zayan, operations manager of CAIR Austin, stressed that law enforcement should prioritize de-escalation and dialogue when handling peaceful protests.\n\n“Sending in a massive armed police force to arrest students advocating for peace sends the wrong message and only exacerbates tensions further,” Zayan said in a statement.\n\nTexas state troopers in riot gear broke up a group of protesters at the University of Texas at Austin after a demonstration Wednesday. The Austin Police Department told CNN they are assisting the University of Texas Police Department with transporting arrested protesters.\n\nTensions rise as protests over Israel-Hamas war on college campuses continue. Here's what to know\n\nPro-Palestinian protests are taking place at major American universities Wednesday.\n\nThe protesters and their supporters, including faculty in some cases, are condemning crackdowns on demonstrations and free speech. Some students, parents, donors and lawmakers are pleading with administrators to take new steps to restore order.\n\nDemonstrations are ongoing at Columbia University, Brown University and other campuses.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\nColumbia University extended negotiations with student activists over the dismantling of their pro-Palestinian encampment, a spokesperson for the school said. It came after Columbia’s president said the university had given protesters a midnight deadline to reach an agreement or it would consider “alternative options” to clear the encampment. The university announced it is moving to mostly hybrid classes on its main campus until the end of the semester, April 29.\n\nAt Brown University, about 90 students were seen setting up an encampment and protest Wednesday morning, according to a university spokesperson, which is a “violation of University policy.”\n\nTwo people were arrested during a protest at Ohio State University, according to a university spokesperson. Asked if OSU would consider the students’ demands for divestment from Israel, spokesperson Benjamin Johnson said state law prohibits it.\n\nAt the University of Texas at Austin, Texas State Police were seen pushing back pro-Palestinian protesters, as witnessed by CNN affiliate KEYE. Texas state troopers were in riot gear, including some on horseback. The Palestine Solidarity Committee in Austin organized the walkout and occupation on the school’s South Lawn.\n\nA demonstration is also happening at the University of Southern California. There is “significant activity” happening around the University Park Campus, according to an alert sent by the school.\n\nReaction: The Biden administration said it is monitoring campus protests closely, according to White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates. He underscored that President Joe Biden supports the right to protest peacefully but condemned what he called “alarming rhetoric” at some student demonstrations. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called the protests “antisemitic,” according to a post on social media.\n\nLawmakers weigh in: House Speaker Mike Johnson and some New York Republicans will visit with Jewish students at Columbia University on Wednesday, his office said. He will call on Columbia president Minouche Shafik to resign after failing to crack down on the protests, he said on a radio show. Some Republican lawmakers have also called for the National Guard to respond to protests at the school.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez weighs in on campus protests\n\nAs pro-Palestinian protests spread throughout college campuses nationwide, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York condemned the way administrators like Columbia University President Minouche Shafik have handled the issue on behalf of the student protesters.\n\n“Calling in police enforcement on nonviolent demonstrations of young students on campus is an escalatory, reckless, and dangerous act,” wrote Rep. Ocasio-Cortez in a post on X Tuesday. “It represents a heinous failure of leadership that puts people’s lives at risk. I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.”\n\nHer comment came a day after a fellow New York Democrat, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, accused Columbia of caving to “right wing pressure.”"
