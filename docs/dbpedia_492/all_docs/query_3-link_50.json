        "text": "A wedding brought my family to Mobile, Alabama, for the weekend. While time did not permit many baseball adventures, we did carve out just enough of a Saturday morning to check out two landmarks of Hank Aaron’s Mobile.\n\nFirst up on our tour was the Hammer’s childhood home, which for several years doubled as a museum. Though the Baseball Map had this landmark located at Hank Aaron Stadium, Mobile’s minor league ballpark, I was glad to have queried SABR local Patrick Bone in advance.\n\nIn fact, the Aaron house no longer resides at the park but instead in the Aaron family’s old Toulminville neighborhood, outside the Mobile Police Department’s Third Precinct where it sits indefinitely closed and inaccessible to the public.\n\nI don’t think this is the city’s permanent plan for the landmark. At the moment I think there is simply no plan. Personally I have no idea what it would cost in terms of dollars and time to give the museum a more permanent home and open it to the public. Still, I have to imagine some combination of private and public support would be out there the second the city asked.\n\nAnyone wondering why the house left its ballpark location in the first place would quickly find the answer upon pulling up to 755 Bolling Brothers Blvd.\n\nThe ballpark, like its former tenants, the Bay Bears, are no more. Instead we have the Rocket City Trash Pandas up in Madison, Alabama, and a whole lotta land for sale.\n\nFortunately, there are still some signs of the Hammer, for however short a time they’ll survive vandals, scavengers, or a next owner’s future plans. Though inaccessible by car, a short walk takes you to the front of the stadium where an Aaron stand-up and ground site marker are quickly found situated on a well manicured patch of grass.\n\nHere is a close-up of the marker itself, which honors the five Hall of Famers born in Mobile: Satchel Paige, Hank Aaron, Willie McCovey, Billy Williams, and Ozzie Smith.\n\nOn the other side of the circular patch of grass are individual plaques for these same five Mobile legends. (Though of interest to nobody but me, I can’t help but remark here that the first plaque honors Leroy Robert Paige, and the wedding that brought us here was that of Robert and Paige.)\n\nThe landscaping of this patch of grass along with the excellent condition of the plaques definitely belies what becomes apparent upon approaching the stadium entrance. So much for the once grand Hank Aaron poster that greeted visitors!\n\nAnd what of the “Hank Aaron Stadium” marquee once perched above the entrance? My wife’s keen eyes spotted it unceremoniously ditched behind a gazebo.\n\nHere are the poster and marquee in better days.\n\nLandmark czars Racanelli and Kamka will have to let us know if the ballpark’s Hall of Fame keeps its status given that one can no longer enter but can peep some plaques through the fence. Here are the plaques for Ben Davis and Kevin Towers, for example. About eight such plaques are visible in all.\n\nContinuing past the entrance, you are able to see the back of the stadium’s scoreboard, which I’ll regard generously as the last of the site’s highlights, before returning to the main road.\n\nMore or less going 0 for 2 on my pilgrimage to the birthplace of a baseball demigod, I couldn’t help but grapple with a single thought.\n\nHow do you put the Hammer’s name on something and let it die?\n\nThat evening we took our seats in the pew as Robert and Paige prepared to wed. Father Jones, in fairness just doing his job, reminded us we were all sinners. As Henry Aaron’s Mobile landmarks stood somewhere between dormant and dying, the truth of these words, for the very first time, hit me and left a mark.\n\n2022 year marked the 30th anniversary of the highest grossing baseball film of all time, A League of Their Own. Countless screenings were held and other events were scheduled to celebrate this landmark film in the weeks before the release of the new Amazon television series of the same name. For me, a trip to Indiana that summer was both a figurative and literal homecoming to embrace the movie that has had a significant impact on my life for the past three decades.\n\nI have been to Evansville’s Bosse Field and Huntingburg’s League Stadium many times. Both are about a 40-minute drive in different directions from my hometown in western Kentucky. I was 12 years old when filming began in the summer of 1991 and could still recognize what a big deal it was to have a Hollywood production come to southern Indiana. My brother and dad actually drove over to be extras late in the filming schedule for what would end up being the World Series scenes. The end result had a huge impact on me. Already fascinated (and still am) with World War II, I started reading anything I could find on baseball during the war, the home front, and this All-American Girls Professional Baseball League that I had never heard of (before seeing the movie five times in the theater). Decades later, I’m working with the International Women’s Baseball Center, creating Women in Baseball Week, and presenting at conferences on my research into women in the game. It’s safe to say I’m hooked, so imagine my excitement when heading home for a family visit, I saw both stadiums had games scheduled for the week I would be in town. What better way to relive all that film has given me than to pay them back-to-back visits?\n\nLeading off was a trip to Bosse Field in Evansville. Located at 23 Don Mattingly Way, Bosse Field (pronounced “bossy” for those who might not know) opened in 1915 and is believed to be the third oldest professional ballpark still in use behind only Fenway Park and Wrigley Field. Though situated on the edge of Garvin Park, the stadium is nestled in a neighborhood of homes, factories, and warehouses, many dating back to the World War II era when Evansville was a leading armaments manufacturer for the war effort.\n\nLocation scouts for the film would have been hard pressed to find a more suitable ballpark for the production’s needs. The stadium is encompassed by a red brick wall, presenting a classic look, with lighting situated inside this outer wall but beyond the outfield fence and on top of the grandstand roof. Approaching the stadium, visitors are met by an impressive three-story tall main gate of brick, stone, and windows. For movie fans, this is where Jimmy meets Dottie’s husband post-World Series and they all exchange pleasantries before boarding the bus back to the hotel.\n\nThe area wrapping around the outside of the stadium in either direction of the main gate constitutes the concourse where most concessions and merchandise are sold. At both ends are additional entrances to the stadium and stepping through these North and South Gates, visitors will find more fun holdovers from the film. Just above these gates are old fashioned advertising for shoes and coffee used in filming and further up from each gate toward the back of the grandstand are two large, identical signs reading Support the Racine Belles. They look great and I am glad to see the stadium still embraces their role in its history 30 years later. The stadium seats just over 5,100 in green metal and wooden chair backs, situated in a smooth half circle and mostly under roof coverage. As always, I find myself moving to a new location every inning just to get a different look at the field.\n\nBosse Field has been home to the Frontier League Evansville Otters since 1995 and I’m lucky to still have trading cards, programs, and ticket stubs from that first season. On my visit, however, the Otters were on the road and the Women’s Professional Fastpitch tour was in town. A couple thousand people turned out to watch the USSSA Pride take on the Smash It Sports Vipers and the atmosphere was absolutely electric. Having been a softball fan for the past 30 years as well, I was experiencing a most unique opportunity to watch Shelby Pendley play live (for me, the first time in six years) and see Olympic gold medalist Kelly Krestchman coaching. Reigning NCAA home run queen Jocelyn Alo, on the heels of graduating from another national championship season at the University of Oklahoma, went yard on the first pitch of her first at bat. The crowd went wild and so did I.\n\nOn top of A League of Their Own filming, I know the AAGPBL played an exhibition game or two here in the late 1940s. How cool to see women pro ball players in Bosse where all of that had happened before. A small gift shop caught my eye on the way out where I bought a large book on the history of Bosse Field. Seemingly half the photos were contributed by Justin Sheller, who played Stilwell Angel in the film, which is fine by me.\n\nThe following day’s plans were extra special in that I brought my mom along to League Stadium for that evening’s game and my brother and niece would be driving down from Indianapolis to join us. My first trip to League Stadium would have been 1993 when, also with my mom, we stopped to see where the movie was filmed on our way to Bloomington, Indiana. We had a brief tour with a local volunteer, took a lot of pictures, and even bought a folding chair used in the film, which still sits in my office. New chair backs were obtained from the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and installed in the late 1990s in time for the Dubois County Dragons of the Frontier League to take up residence. On this night, we would be watching the current tenants, the Dubois County Bombers of the summer collegiate Ohio Valley League play my hometown Owensboro RiverDawgs.\n\nSimilar to Bosse Field, League Stadium is situated in a city park, but surrounded by tennis and basketball courts, a playground, pool, and youth baseball and softball fields. A replica Rockford Peaches bus greets visitors at the park’s entrance. The ballpark does not have quite as grandiose of a main gate as Bosse, although this is understandable. The original rectangular grandstand dates back to the 1890s and it wasn’t until the location was chosen in 1991 for A League of Their Own that it was renovated to its current, more traditional ballpark shape. Movie fans will note that no scenes in the film feature the outside of this park.\n\nThe inside, however, is a nostalgic marvel. The aforementioned seats from Atlanta fill the lower area at field level, but the upper level near the press box remains the same bench seating from the film. At nearly 2,800 seats, League Stadium’s capacity is just over half that of Bosse Field. There is still a sign for Harvey Bars on the outfield fence and both the press box and left field scoreboard feature the same “Rockford Peaches” in script. A newer electronic scoreboard used for games sits just behind the right field fence. Like Bosse, food and merchandise are located outside of the stands. There is a small exhibit area with plaques, props and costumes from A League of Their Own and HBO’s Soul of the Game, also partially filmed here and released in 1996. Our tickets for the game had us about eight rows behind home plate, but from the looks of the stadium, there is not a bad seat in the house.\n\nMany of the “amenities” found in current minor league stadiums are absent at both Bosse Field and League Stadium. You won’t find chain restaurant outlets, bar seating along the outfield wall, or a splash park for the kids. What League Stadium expertly delivers is a trip back through time, which I am sure appeals to a lot of us. The team’s nickname is derived from a World War II bomber and the players wear 1940s style uniforms. Female staff follow suit in replica Peaches uniforms and hand write seat assignments on ticket stubs. Flags and banners hang from the columns supporting the roof and most of the music played between innings is either Big Band or from the A League of Their Own soundtrack. Fans of both baseball and the film almost need multiple visits to take it all in and fully appreciate the total experience curated by both stadiums. First, there’s exploring the history and architecture of the spaces and witnessing the game in such a classic environment.\n\nNext, you have the games themselves. Evenly matched summer collegiate baseball or professional softball will do it for me every time. Finally, there’s the movie aspect. Literally everywhere you look can be a reference to a favorite part of the film whether it’s the final collision at home in the World Series, Stilwell Angel getting nailed in the face with a glove, or the legendary “There’s no crying in baseball” scene.\n\nMy family’s visit to League Stadium was fun, although a bit sad. My dad passed away in October of 2019, leaving this mini-family reunion feeling incomplete. On the way home, I realized something that now has cemented A League of Their Own as a film, baseball or otherwise, that will always hit close to home. My absolute favorite shot of the entire film is during Kit’s at bat in the World Series. After driving a high one into right field, we see her rounding first heading straight toward the camera for a turn at second. Her skirt is flying, her cleats are kicking up dirt in the base path, and there is a wall of excited people in the stands behind her, punctuated by the giant Support the Racine Belles sign. It is a beautiful, classic shot. And then I made a new connection – my dad is there. Maybe not exactly in the shot as it’s difficult to pick out anyone specifically and I only know he was in the back of the first base / right field end of the stands. He had watched the whole scene being filmed and was a part of it, and now he’s forever a part of my favorite shot in a favorite movie about a sport and history that I love. It’s a bittersweet, but welcomed feeling every time I have watched the movie since.\n\nA few months ago, I had the unique opportunity to watch the USA Baseball Women’s National Team play back-to-back games at former AAGPBL ballparks in Rockford and Kenosha, both of which are also on the SABR Landmarks Baseball Map. Watching these games, alongside AAGPBL players no less, was a unique experience that I never anticipated. I never thought I would write blogs for SABR or have dinner with actors, writers, and directors connected to A League of Their Own, both the film and the series. There is a beauty to never having specific expectations toward an interest or hobby and just letting it flow. I never anticipated A League of Their Own affecting me so profoundly, but thanks a visit home in 2022, I realize I’ve been living my best baseball life for 30 years.\n\nIf you’re reading about SABR Landmarks research projects, you undoubtedly love seeing historical roadside markers. The more specific and local, the better. George Washington slept here. Teddy Roosevelt lived there. First Roman Catholic Church in the area. You get it. We see them when we’re least expecting and are probably driving too fast half the time to read every word, but we immediately appreciate that someone took the time to research and get that marker placed so that patrons of future generations know why that exact spot is special.\n\nBefore we get to baseball history on Long Island, it’s worth mentioning my origin story with historical markers. Without the work we did through the Press Club of Long Island (PCLI), no sports history markers would exist. PCLI is the local pro chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), the oldest organization representing journalists in the United States. As the longest-serving president of PCLI from 2014-2018, I constantly sought interesting ways to put the organization on the map and have it stand out from hundreds of other chapters nationwide. Our projects had to relate to our core values of education, advocacy, and ethics.\n\nI noticed that SPJ had an application to apply for a chance to get a historical marker related to local journalism history for your region. I applied, and we didn’t get selected. In speaking with a longtime board member, local historian, and journalist, Bill Bleyer, I suggested we put up our own historical marker. He had experience doing it, the board agreed, and we sought our first location, which happened to be in Hempstead, NY, where Newsday was first printed in 1940. What better way to start than the spot where the island’s most recognizable news source came to life? We erected four markers during my tenure as PCLI president.\n\nThe journalism marker project began in 2015. I became President of the Suffolk County Sports Hall of Fame in 2017. The Hall originated in 1990 and has honored people of significance related to sports, from coaches and pro players to journalists and athletic administrators. From Craig Biggio, Carl Yastrzemski, and Henry Chadwick to Frank Catalanotto and Sal Agostinelli, there is no shortage of baseball people from Suffolk County who have reached the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nAfter rebranding the Hall, creating a digital archive of all Hall artifacts and documents, reimagining the induction ceremony and process, and evolving several satellite exhibits in the county, I wanted to make a splash with another purpose by enhancing our mission. Since then, the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame has developed a marker project honoring places of historical significance.\n\nSo much history has happened on our 118-mile-long stretch of land. If it were a state, Long Island would be the 13th most populated in the country. It’s common to see markers designating where George Washington visited during the Revolutionary War, especially since he ran a spy ring in the area, and the Battle of Long Island was the first conflict following the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. But did you know Satchel Paige pitched here in 1950? Imagine seeing Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in a barnstorming game on the south shore in 1930, just three years after the 1927 New York Yankees built a reputation as one of the greatest teams in history. Ever think about where Yasztremski played his high school ball?\n\nThere is no shortage of sports history, so I set out to spread the love and educate with one marker at a time.\n\nIndependent Baseball on Long Island\n\nThe Long Island Ducks, who play in the Atlantic League, have been synonymous with the area for over 20 years. Families and kids have made it a right of passage to attend Ducks games in Central Islip, NY, since 2000. In 2019, during the 20th season of Ducks baseball, we put up our first marker to commemorate the longest-running pro sports organization in the county. It felt right as the Ducks were celebrating their anniversary to mark it with this placard next to Fairfield Properties Ballpark.\n\n“When Frank Boulton began this journey, many did not think a minor league ballpark in Suffolk County would work,” said Ducks President/GM Michael Pfaff. “Then, with the initial great success of the Ducks, others predicted it would not last. This marker celebrates the success and longevity of Long Island’s hometown team, a tradition we look forward to continuing.”\n\nThe Ducks baseball team got its name from the Long Island Ducks hockey club that played at Long Island Arena from 1959 through 1973. The Ducks have had some good talent, including big leaguers Rich Hill, Carl Everett, Edgardo Alfonzo, Danny Graves, Lew Ford, and Daniel Murphy.\n\nCelebrating Yaz’s High School Stomping Grounds\n\nWe were delayed in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic but picked up with our second marker at Bridgehampton High School on Tuesday, April 5, 2022. The historical marker to honor where Baseball Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski played prep ball was timed with the resurrection of the baseball program in Bridgehampton, which returned after a 43-year hiatus.\n\nYastrzemski was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame in 1990, grew up in Bridgehampton, graduated in 1957, and hit .512 during high school. Yaz, unfortunately, did not come down from Massachusetts for the event.\n\nYaz’s longtime friend Dan Shedrick of Sag Harbor read a statement during the ceremony written by the local icon: “I truly regret that I am unable to join you today for this special honor. My thanks to my coaches and teammates, and members of the Bridgehampton community for their support. Most importantly, my congrats to the ‘Bridges’ new varsity team — learn from your coaches, play hard and have fun.”\n\nSatchel Paige Barnstorming Moment Immortalized\n\nBaseball Hall of Famer Satchel Paige pitched in Riverhead, NY, during a barnstorming game on July 21, 1950. Thanks to Fabio Montella, an assistant professor of library services and history for Suffolk County Community College’s Eastern Campus in Riverhead, this research was brought to my attention, and we circled this spot as the third location deserving a marker, which was erected on May 5, 2022.\n\nThe marker was placed on Riverhead Schools’ property on Osborn Avenue, where Wivchar Stadium once stood. Paige pitched for the Philadelphia Stars, a semipro barnstorming team. Also at the game that day was Carl Yastrzemski Jr., a 10-year-old bat boy for the Riverhead Falcons, a team his dad, Carl Sr., played on.\n\nRuth and Gehrig Come to Lindenhurst\n\nI placed the Hall of Fame’s fourth historical marker at the location where Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig played a barnstorming game in Lindenhurst, NY, in 1930. We dedicated the marker on October 18, 2023.\n\nNinety-three years to the day, the marker was placed to designate the location on South Second Street, where the Baseball Hall of Famers played against Addie Klein’s Lindenhurst Nine.\n\nThere were more than 4,000 fans in attendance at the game. Ruth hit a monster home run that is believed to have gone at least 500 feet. Gehrig had three hits. After the game, they had a drink at the Plaza, a hotel, restaurant, and bar on Montauk Highway.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe process is different for each location. It depends on who owns the property and who can grant permission to put the marker in the ground. It might be a private owner, a school district, or a village government. I also rely on a maintenance, facilities, or public works team to help do the installation. Finally, none of this is possible without the beautiful craftsmanship from Catskill Castkings, who makes the markers and ships the heavy piece to me directly on Long Island.\n\nYou might be asking why we’ve only had baseball markers to date. It’s purely a coincidence, but I’m happy with the theme it presents to support our national pastime. We have a working list of markers for various sports worth considering in the future. Shinnecock Hills (Golf), Bridgehampton Raceway (Racing), Long Island Arena (Hockey), and the Canoe Place Inn (Boxing), where John Sullivan trained before his heavyweight title fight in 1892, to name a few. On the baseball front, we’ve explored the location where an all-woman baseball team, similar to the ones in “A League of Their Own” played, two more spots where Babe Ruth played in Riverhead and Kings Park, the field in Sag Harbor where Henry Chadwick watched games, and, my favorite, the location where the first all-Black baseball team played in 1885. The New York Cuban Giants were inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame in 2019, and there is a large rock at the location of the old Argyle Hotel in Babylon, NY, to commemorate the location. The year 2025 marks the 140th anniversary of the team’s formation, a nice round number to honor with a historical marker.\n\nHere’s to preserving history, honoring the past, and inspiring the future …\n\nMy wife and I are cruising along the rolling hills of eastern Ohio, some 50 miles south of Canton and a hundred miles east of Columbus. This is Amish country, the farmhouses close to the winding roadway, laundry drying on clotheslines, yellow signs reminding drivers to share the road with horses and buggies.\n\nOhio Route 258 dips into a grove of trees, then rises again. As it bends to the right, the trees give way to a small brick church on a hilltop. “Peoli Cemetery / p.m.c. 1870-2018” is painted above the front door. A sign on the lawn next to the flagpole reads, “Peoli Church. Resting Place of Cy Young,” with a hand-painted baseball and glove.\n\nThey’re still quite proud of Denton True “Cy” Young out here, nearly 68 years after his death.\n\nWe slow down and park in a turnout at the bottom of the 1.8-acre cemetery next to a field of grazing cattle. It’s a warm, 70-degree day with a pleasant breeze as we walk beneath a wrought-iron archway reading “PEOLI CEMETERY” in white letters. Two gravel ruts bisect the church yard in a straight line and it’s not long before we spot the headstone on the right, up the hill:\n\n⚾YOUNG⚾\n\nCy Young’s grave isn’t quite at the peak of the rise, but it’s not far off. The view to the south opens up to more rolling, green hills, the only other building in sight about half a mile away. It’s such a serene resting place.\n\nThe other side of the headstone features a winged baseball centered at the top – a fly ball? – the names of Cy and his wife, Roba, and their dates of birth and death below. The logo of the Order of the Eastern Star is etched next to Roba’s name, the Freemasons’ Scottish Rite emblem next to Cy’s; they were both members. An epitaph reads: “From 1890 to 1911, ‘Cy’ Young pitched 874 Major League base ball games. He won 511 games, three no-hit, and one perfect game in which no man reached first base.” Baseballs, caps and a bag of sunflower seeds have been left by other pilgrims who have ventured to this spot.\n\nWhat brought baseball’s winningest pitcher to this tiny hamlet 10 miles east of his hometown, Newcomerstown? The answer is etched on the left side of the gravestone: Roba was born and raised in Peoli. Her family – parents Robert and Sue, brother Fred – are buried in the Miller family plot just a few steps away. All were members of this church, and their funerals were held here. About half a mile back up the road stands a battered red farmhouse, the last place Cy Young lived before his death on Nov. 4, 1955. He had moved there after Roba’s passing, staying with the Benedum family for the last 22 years of his life.\n\nCasey and I made this trip the first week of June, just days before the Landmarks Committee added Hall of Famers’ gravesites to the map – not that this cemetery was hard to find; Cy Young’s grave is on Google. But before heading out to the country, we did use the map to find Cy Young Memorial Park in Newcomerstown.\n\nNestled between a neighborhood and U.S. 36, the park contains a state historical marker as well as an elaborate Cy Young memorial next to a baseball field. There are also basketball courts, a beach volleyball pit, picnic tables and a community pool.\n\nThe elaborate memorial is centered on the pitcher’s mound of a small infield replica. Images of Young are engraved into the center pillar, with slabs on either side highlighting his career achievements. “BASEBALL’S IMMORTAL PITCHER” is chiseled on the left half. “In his youth on a nearby farm, ‘Cy’ played baseball for love of the game, a quality that remained with him throughout his long life. He began his Major League career in 1890 with Cleveland and continued as an active pitcher in the big leagues until he retired at the end of the 1911 season.”\n\nThe right-side header reads, “MEMBER OF BASEBALL’S HALL OF FAME,” and the text below echoes the wording on plaques in Cooperstown: “Pitching for Cleveland, St. Louis, and Boston, his record of 511 victories in 912 games will never be surpassed. His total of 3508 strikeouts in 22 years and 751 complete games including three no-hitters, one of which was a perfect game in which no man reached first base, may also stand forever.”\n\nTo be sure, his plaque is a bit simpler. And the gravestone and memorial have different career totals from what Young was known to have accomplished: 815 games (not 874 or 912), 2,803 strikeouts (not 3,508) and 749 complete games (not 751). The discrepancies and inaccuracies are understandable, though – the memorial was installed in 1964, five years before The Baseball Encyclopedia debuted and nine years before Nolan Ryan threw his first no-hitter. As we drive out of the parking lot, I notice a lawn sign promoting the 2023 Cy Young Days Festival, a three-day celebration of baseball and the hometown hero held the fourth weekend in June. We’re about two weeks too early, but it gives us a reason to come back.\n\nI was fortunate enough to spend the start of July in one of the world’s great cities, Montreal, home to the Expos from 1969 to 2004. Of course the baseball history (and baseball card history!) of Montreal stretches back much further than that.\n\nThe Montreal Royals joined the International League in 1897 and went on to win seven league titles, all between 1941 and 1958. A Montreal Royal, James “Doc” Casey, is even represented in the 1909-11 American Tobacco Company “White Borders” (T206) set affectionately dubbed “The Monster.”\n\nOf course, the most famous Royal of them all played for the 1946 Montreal squad, recognized as one of the top 100 minor league teams of all-time. A pleasant half hour walk through some fun and artsy neighborhoods brought me to his colorful mural at 3907 St. Laurent Blvd.\n\nFrom there, I had two choices. Walk back to my hotel or walk another 30-40 minutes to hit another Jackie Robinson landmark. I chose the latter.\n\nThe Montreal Royals of Jackie’s time played their games at Stade De Lorimier (pronounced duh-lor-eem-yay). The ballpark is long gone, but the city has commemorated the “place of the Royals” with a…dingy metal sign?!\n\nOkay, so that’s only half true. Yes, the marker could use an upgrade, but there is also an excellent tribute to Jackie Robinson just below it.\n\nLoosely translated to English, the words on the sign read—\n\nThis commemorative plaque honors Jackie Robinson’s stay with the Royal team and marks the former location of De Lorimier Stadium.\n\nBy playing with the Royals, Jackie Robinson became the first player of color to play in professional leagues.\n\nJackie Robinson bequeathed his glory to his family and all baseball and earned an important place among the immortals of this sport.\n\nIn the minds of Montrealers, Jackie Robinson will always remain a symbol of excellence, courage and perseverance\n\nCity of Montreal, 1989\n\nYou may have noticed the plaque takes the form of home plate, and this is no coincidence. In fact, it is part of a larger mini-ballpark, complete with outfield grass and bleachers.\n\nThough there were other landmarks I might have made by foot, I already had plans to tour them the next day with Montreal baseball artist Josée Tellier, whose wonderful Jackie Robinson artwork adorns the entrance to our guest room.\n\nAs this second day of landmarks was more distant from my hotel, we caught a cab to their general vicinity before setting out on foot. Our first stop was Jackie’s second mural in Montreal. If you look closely you’ll notice one of the locals totally not thinking what I’m doing is super dorky.\n\nWe were definitely in Mr. Robinson’s neighborhood now, or more correctly Mr. and Mrs. Robinson’s neighborhood. As proof, here is the house just a few blocks away that Jackie and Rachel called home in 1946.\n\nHere is a closer look at the plaque by the door. (Note the bottom half presents the English translation.)\n\nOur final landmark for the evening was nearby Jarry Park, home of the Montreal Expos from 1969-76. A small portion of the original stadium structure still remains as part of a newer tennis facility.\n\nThe street name equally serves to remind visitors that a beloved major league team once played here.\n\nAs we wrapped up this round of landmarks, Josée made sure I knew there was one more Jackie Robinson landmark we didn’t cover because it was too far away: the Jackie statue at Olympic Stadium. Lucky for readers of the Hardball Voyager, I got up the next day at 5 AM and decided a 7-mile walk wouldn’t be completely insane.\n\nHere is a view of the statue without some guy blocking it.\n\nAnd here is a close-up of the plaque.\n\nFinally, here is the statue from further away. Olympic Stadium is the giant flying saucer-looking thing behind it.\n\nOlympic Stadium was of course home to the Expos from 1977 until 2004, after which MLB relocated the team to Washington, DC. (Boo! Bud stole the Expos!) Amid all today’s talk of expansion and relocation, there are high hopes in Las Vegas, Nashville, Salt Lake City, and Portland but only the dimmest of forecasts for a return to Montreal.\n\nStill, right in front of this stadium without a team stands Jackie—in what now may be recast as an act of defiance—handing the ball to the next generation, refusing to let the game die. I guess time will tell, at least here in Montreal."
