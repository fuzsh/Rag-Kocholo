        "text": "\"Intimidator Rose\" performance, 2024\n\nI participated in the MircoWIP performance series in the Historic Asolo Theater at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art this past January. I had been developing this series over the past eight years. Prior to the pandemic, I had experimented with soft sound sculptures, so it was fun to extend my curiosities of sound through the use of Playtronica’s arduino. I experiemented with rose prepping and the process of conductivity. Full circle for me was being able to perform my Mable Ringling Roses on actual live roses.\n\nMable Ringling Rose Garden Soundstitching by Cassia Kite\n\nBased on Mable Ringling’s Rose Garden, this work began with documenting the roses in 2016, then evolved to hand-stitching and translating several of the flowers into music compositions. This series of works is intended to translate the roses into a collaborative, site-based performance involving multiple instrumentation and interpretive dancers. For this performance, I explored my own curiosities in musical instrumentation to allow for the roses to perform in an innovative way.\n\n#soundstitching#cassiakiteart#microwip#theringling#historicasolotheater#performance#performanceart#mableringlingrosegarden#roses#experimentalcomposition#experimentalmusic\n\n\"Home\"\n\nA piano piece that transforms the primary Soundstitching pitches (G, B, B-flat, A, C) into two basic scales giving the piece a nostalgic feel. The beginning and end add charming pluckings on strings inside the piano. A piece that moves forward but would be playable by intermediate and advanced players!~ Dr. Stacey Barelos\n\nStacey Barelos is a performer, composer, and educator. As a performer, she specializes in the music of the 20th and 21st centuries, particularly the music of living composers.

In 2019, her piece Starfish was featured at toy piano festivals in Como, Italy, and Seoul, South Korea. In 2020, Barelos’s work as a composer, performer, and educator was featured on Nebraska Public Media’s “What If,” a statewide program celebrating innovation and creativity in Nebraska. She received her DMA degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
