        "text": "To take on the works of Duke Ellington in 2024, one must be quite bold and, above all, have a group of truly talented musicians to bring us back to that atmosphere. This, combined with modernized arrangements, makes this music more vibrant than ever and benefits from particularly luxurious production, which is the case with this album… I started by reading the press release intended for journalists: Echoes of Harlem: A Salute to Duke Ellington Vol 2 is a sincere tribute to the legendary Duke Ellington and follows the resounding success of the previous album by Planet D Nonet, Blues to Be There: A Salute to Duke Ellington. The previous album was perfection, so quickly! Quickly, we open the CD player to let it swallow the new disc. Barely time to catch our breath and we arrive at track 3, “Rocks In My Bed,” which seems tailor-made for the soundtrack of Spielberg’s “The Color Purple,” one of the few films that managed to bring me to tears and deeply resonate with my humanistic fiber…\n\nYes, this album is an artistic masterpiece. Although the tracks have been known for ages, the joy is there on this CD, whose cover design is also particularly successful. An organic evolution of Volume 2. During the tour for the previous CD, Planet D Nonet continued to add new pieces to their repertoire, realizing last summer that they had enough material for Volume 2. The project evolved organically, with some songs drawn from the film “Anatomy of a Murder,” performed during a special tour of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, where Duke himself once played. The performances by James O’Donnell with the East Side Rhythm Rascals inspired the inclusion of “Echoes of Harlem” and “Azalea,” arranged by Jeff Cuny. Collaborations with Andrew Homzy and Jeff Cuny brought “Rocks in my Bed” from the Ellington collection at the Smithsonian, featuring the voices of Camille Price.\n\nThis is music imbued with as much poetry as nostalgia, on which all jazz specialists can ponder for a while on the effectiveness of this production, which is evidently a labor of love. Here, they do not merely interpret Duke’s hits; these are more like inspirations, a vision of a bygone era, a modern rewrite, a way of handling the brass that probably wouldn’t have been done that way back then. And this is what makes the genius of this album, which we embrace from the first listen. Even the instrumental solos are legendary moments, and certainly, this is one of our finest albums labeled “Indispensable!”\n\nThierry De Clemensat\n\nUSA correspondent – Paris-Move and ABS magazine\n\nEditor in chief Bayou Blue Radio, Bayou Blue News\n\nPARIS-MOVE, July 7th 2024\n\nFollow PARIS-MOVE on X\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nPlayers:\n\nJames O’Donnell trumpet, flugelhorn, vocals & maracas, coleader\n\nCharlie Miller, trumpet, flugelhorn\n\nJohn “Tbone” Paxton, trombone, vocals\n\nAlex Colista, alto sax, clarinet\n\nChristopher Tabaczynski, tenor sax & clarinet\n\nGoode Wyche III, bari, alto saxes\n\nMichael Zaporski, piano\n\nTrevor Lamb, string bass (except 1 & 3)\n\nSean Perlmutter, drum set, cowbell\n\nRJ Spangler, congas, small percussion instruments, bandleader\n\nSpecial guests:\n\nCamille Price, vocal\n\nKurt Krahnke string bass tracks 1 & 3\n\nCredits:\n\nRJ Spangler, Executive Producer\n\nRJ Spangler, co-producer\n\nRyan Strawbridge, co-producer\n\nJosef Deas, engineer\n\nJohn “Tbone” Paxton associate producer\n\nS.
