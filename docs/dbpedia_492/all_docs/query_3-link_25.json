        "text": "It’s National Photography Month! I love, love, love looking at old photos – especially photos of people. I like to be able to put faces to name as I research, and feel such a rush when I discover the likeness of a research subject after I’ve learned their stories.\n\nSometimes, though, I find the photo first. Last summer, while doing research at the Maryland State Archives for Marietta House Museum, I found a photograph that has intrigued me ever since: an 1889 portrait of a woman named Augusta Caroline DuVal. The great great granddaughter of Gabriel Duvall, the first and most famous resident of Marietta, she grew up at the estate in the 1850s and 1860s. Her name comes up often in family letters and legal documents, but I’ve only recently begun to notice that there’s something odd about the way her family discusses her. Like they’re tiptoeing around some important aspect of her life and experiences. I have the sneaking suspicion that, in some form, Augusta was an invalid.\n\nNow, this is just my hunch. I could be completely wrong. I can’t even posit a potential condition or illness Augusta might have suffered from! But let me walk you through the reasons why I find my suspicion growing every time I see her name in a document.\n\nAugusta Caroline DuVal was born at Marietta on September 6, 1850. She was the third child and second daughter of Edmund Bryce DuVal II (who inherited Marietta from his grandfather) and Caroline Lansdale. She seems to have been close with all of her ten (!) siblings, who gave her the nickname “Tips.” She was especially close with her older sister, Kate, with whom she shared a bedroom in their early childhood.\n\nYou may remember Kate DuVal from a previous blog post. She was the author of “the Mother letter,” which describes (in great detail) her memories of childhood at Marietta in the 1850s and 1860s. Most of the letter concerns the physical layout of the house and estate, making it invaluable to interpretation here at the museum. But we also get a couple of references to Kate’s family, especially her siblings. Here, I found my first fishy reference to Augusta.\n\nKate describes the attic of the house, which includes a room with windows overlooking the east lawn. “Aunt Tips called [it] the sky parlor,” Kate wrote, “and claimed it as her own.” Right away, my eyebrow is raised. With eleven children in the house, there was no space for one of them to have her very own room, especially a sitting room! Why does Augusta? There may be a clue in the next line of the letter. Kate writes that Augusta “furnished it up and had a couch looking out to where she could see us all on the lawn.” The east lawn was the location of the children’s croquet court, so Augusta wanted to watch her siblings at play. It suggests to me that there was something stopping her from joining them, and something that necessitated a quiet space for her to relax.\n\nWills and legal records tell us that Augusta’s family certainly believed that she needed to be protected. Unlike the rest of her siblings, Augusta never married, so their language and actions could reflect the necessity to provide for a single woman. But I think there’s something more going on.\n\nWhen Edmund died in 1878, he only mentioned one of his daughters by name in his will: you guessed it, “my dear Augusta.” All of his as-yet-unmarried daughters were to receive $500 from the estate upon the death of their mother, but only Augusta received a $30 annual allowance beginning immediately after Edmund’s death. Plus, the amount she inherits upon Caroline’s death is a whopping $1000 – a small fortune! Edmund must have believed that Augusta would never marry and be provided for, despite the fact that she was only in her late twenties when he died.\n\nCaroline died in 1890 and carved up the estate into so many pieces, all of the children argued about it for the next decade. In her mother’s will, Augusta gets the same chunk of cash as the rest of her as-yet-unmarried sisters, while her brothers inherit Marietta and the other properties. An odd occurrence two years later hints at the fact that one of her brothers, Gabriel, was entrusted with her welfare after their parents’ deaths. In 1892, the same year that his young family moved into the family home at Marietta, Gabriel set aside a small section of his inherited land and deeded it to Augusta. Almost no money was exchanged in the process. With the money she inherited, Augusta built herself a lovely Victorian home that still stands today. Of course, it’s possible that Gabriel just wanted a kind excuse to kick out his unmarried sister from the family home, creating more space for his wife and children. But he went above and beyond to make it happen, suggesting to me that he felt some obligation to provide for her.\n\nAugusta died in 1896, only a couple of years after her new house was built, from an unspecified illness. Gabriel was the executor of her will – his letters discussing her estate survive in the Maryland State Archives. They don’t reveal much about Augusta as a person, but the language is extremely infantilizing. Gabriel and the other siblings, as well as their lawyers, think of “Tips” as someone relatively helpless, who didn’t manage her finances well.\n\nFishy, right? Unfortunately, no other documents give us a personal insight into what Augusta’s possible condition might be. Perhaps some childhood illness left her weak, like Beth March in Little Women? An outbreak of scarlet fever did kill her next-youngest sibling, Philip, in 1857. Or perhaps Augusta suffered from a disability, whether physical or mental. Or, I’m completely wrong, and Augusta was just suffering through societal prejudice towards unmarried women. Maybe both? We just don’t know.\n\nThe mystery of Augusta Caroline continues for now. I wish I could know more about her, because her story could tell us so much about the experiences of women in nineteenth-century America: how they handled chronic illness or disability, or how they were treated by their families if they decided not to marry. I keep staring at Augusta’s photo, as if she will tell me any of this, but alas: something tells me that this mystery will never be solved."
