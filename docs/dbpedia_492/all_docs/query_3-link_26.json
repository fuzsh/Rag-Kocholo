I didn't fill that in. It has been too long, but I remember a great deal about Wilmington. I may be one of only a few who started at Mt.Pleasant(1st grade) and ended there (12th grade) in the same building on Duncan Rd. My 1st grade room eventually was my typing class room in (I think) 11th grade. Is the Blue Ball still thee out on 202? Is the glass still along the top of the wall around the Alfred I duPont Institution across from the ol' duPont CC? When I was 14-15, I was a beekeeper in and around Wilm. Kept hives along Hillcrest Ave. and a sign advertising fresh honey (late 40's). Also, can't forget the trolleys. How could I have gotten to the downtown library wo/a trolley? i still remember being proud that Rosemary Clooney was from Wilm., but I never thought much of Joe Pyne. maybe I was too young to appreciate his homey humor. Enough for now.\n\nTom (then, Bill) Orlando <twoorlandos@aol.com>\n\nAltoona, Pa USA - Friday, November 14, 2003 at 12:27:54 (EST) Some 60's--70's stuff.

My family moved to Brack-eX when I was around 13. Have wonderful memories of my old neighborhood and the kids I grew up with. The Olin boys, I think there was 6 or seven of them. There was a lot of kids in the neighborhood, if any one on here remembers me please email me at sbuchanan1127@comcast.net I see that no one mentioned the dances on Friday nights at Elsmere Fire Hall. They were good times I will never forget!!!

But, the Wildcat was the better of the two: faster, steeper hills, etc. http://apnostalgia.crosswinds.net/riverview.html\n\nBruce <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, USA - Sunday, October 26, 2003 at 19:29:56 (EST) And....what was the name of that roller coaster at Lenape?

And, the other?\n\nBruce <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, USA - Sunday, October 26, 2003 at 19:21:15 (EST) Took my son to Lenape when he was 2 maybe 3. I couldn't believe they still had the wooden frame roller coaster at the time. He's 31 now. Seems like yesterday.\n\nRichard Meck <richardameck@cs.com>\n\nMontverde, FL USA - Saturday, October 25, 2003 at 20:39:24 (EDT) It's interesting to see where folks from Wilmington have migrated. In going through just this last volume of the guest book (not the archives), I note that seventeen states are represented: CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, IL, KY, MD, NC, NE, NJ, OH, PA, SD, TN, UT AND VA.

Pollitt <kt3tv@arrl.net>\n\nPunta Gorda, FL USA - Monday, October 20, 2003 at 20:57:53 (EDT) Just spent the weekend in Wilmington attending a reunion. The old town looks pretty good, and a lot of home restoration seems to be going on, both to the east and the west of Market St between Front and 14th Streets. The old ritzy Alapocas, Kentmere and Rockford Park neighborhoods are holding up especially well, and the \"new\" Riverfront Walk area is superb. Lincoln Street looks to be in good shape. The drive out Kennett Pike and on Rte 100 (the Montchanin road)to Chadds Ford is still beautiful. Even got up close and personal with Old Swede's Church for the first time in 50 years. Market Street is getting a bit seedy again, but it was good to see that the WSFS building at 9th and Market is still doing the same old business and looking good and well-preserved. Drove by desolate 30th and Gov. Printz Blvd and was reminded of the Frank Sinatra song.\n\nBob <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nStamford, CT USA - Sunday, October 19, 2003 at 19:58:36 (EDT) Does anyone remember \"Herbie\" the paper guy. I went to Sallies and my old man worked for Hercules. He's the first homeless guy / hobo I ever saw. What was his story ? I heard that when he died they found like 20 grand in his little room... the old man told me he read it in the paper. I guess the news journal people might know...\n\nAugust West <w_addison_1060@hotmail.com>\n\nLeadville, CO USA - Sunday, October 19, 2003 at 15:39:12 (EDT) Born and raised in Wilmington, lots of good memories, sleding down Hercules country club, monkey hill & having kitchen sink after foot ball games, going to Sallies Dance, St lIZZIE, HOW CAN WE FORGET FR BURNS!!

I know there are a couple of troops in Wilmington that are older. TROOP 99 is 63 years old. I started on a quest to obtain stories, pictures and meet with other prior members of the troop. I know some of you guys out there are probably prior members. Fess-up. I need some stories. I have actually met two of the original scouts on the first 1940 charter. Two of my sons are Eagles from Troop 99.\n\nD. Haley <djvernon99@msn.com>\n\nHockessin, DE USA - Sunday, October 12, 2003 at 16:47:39 (EDT) Looking for photograph of Bayard school pre WWII.

To those of you who remember it, this is just to let you know that, evidently, it was a victim of Hurricane Isabel. That great Oak tree has fallen recently, I guess during that storm, and has died. I'm sending a picture of the fallen tree to the webmaster, and it will be up to him if he wishes to publish it or archive it for posterity.\n\nBruce <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE - Thursday, October 02, 2003 at 21:46:21 (EDT) Hi Joe I for one sure do remember your show from WDEL. It was well done. Wondered what had happened to you. Sounds as though you've done yourself proud. An \"old\" friend - Bud Poole\n\nBud <bu49@poolesite.com>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Thursday, October 02, 2003 at 08:25:02 (EDT) It seems like a long time ago, but I grew up in Wilmington in the '30s, '40s and 50s. As a kid I used to hang around the old WDEL studios in the Odd Fellows Building at 10th and King when Gorman Walsh and Harvey Smith were the main guys there. After college at Lafayette and several broadcasting jobs, I returned to Wilmington in 1961 to become the news director at WDEL, after the station had moved to the old WDEL-TV building on Shipley Road. In addition to news, I did a call-in program called \"Voice of the People,\" one of the early call-in radio shows. I left Wilmington in 1967 to join NBC radio and TV in Cleveland where I have been ever since. I retired from NBC a few years ago, but continue to do a weekly jazz history radio show on Cleveland's NPR station, and just recently wrote a book on Cleveland Jazz History. I returned to Wilmington last year for the 50th anniversary of our high school graduation at Tower Hill, and frankly, hardly recognized the place. It looked like Concord Pike has become Delaware's largest city.\n\nJoe Mosbrook <joe.mosbrook@multiverse.com>\n\nCleveland, OH USA - Wednesday, October 01, 2003 at 23:23:42 (EDT) Hey, Fellas, I don't think anyone advertises in this forum. I think people just come on and add their ads. (No pun intended). I, myself, am truly grateful for the people who run this forum. Thanks for providing it. Pat (Stillwell) LeVan\n\nPat LeVan <LeVan1706@aol.com>\n\nPort St. Lucie, FL USA - Wednesday, October 01, 2003 at 20:02:24 (EDT) Right on !

Baynard Stadium, a combo field, football/baseball/and track belongs to the City Of Wilmington, and was used by Wilmington High, Brown Voc., & Sallies, as their home field, and by other local schools that didn't have their own fields. Baynard Stadium is still there, still in excellent repair, and still in use by many local venues. I hope I have clarified some, and not further confused the issue.\n\nBruce <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, USA - Tuesday, September 30, 2003 at 09:20:30 (EDT) Ok, Joe- that would explain the name \"Pennsy\"... I was kinda young back in the 40's, and don't remember it real well. Heck, I don't remember a whole lot that happened last week, come to think of it! Thanks for the clarification.\n\nBill Fisher <whfisher@earthlink.net>\n\nWest Sumner, CA USA - Monday, September 29, 2003 at 19:42:49 (EDT) Thanks for the quick response Bill but the field you're referring to belonged to Wilmington HS. There was a track there that was used for CYO meets in the early 60's and also a baseball field. Pennsy Field was somewhere near the train station but I can't place it exactly.\n\nJoe\n\nUSA - Monday, September 29, 2003 at 19:26:23 (EDT) Joe: If the \"football field\" is the one I've seen mentioned previously here, it was also the site of a stone-walled pond that appeared to be abandoned, at least in the late 40's. It was located approximately where the US202 exit leaves the northbound I-95, southeast of Alapocas. Someone said that high school football games took place there, but when I used to go there, there was no evidence of any kind of stadium or athletic field. I'm pretty sure that's the location you're thinking of... anyone else remember that area?\n\nBill Fisher <whfisher@earthlink.net>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Monday, September 29, 2003 at 17:33:24 (EDT) I just found this site recently and I really enjoy it. In going back through the archives someone asked if anybody remembered Pennsy Field where many big high school football games were played in the 30's. I've been trying to figure out exactly where this Field was for a long time so any help would be appreciated. As long as I'm here who remembers building forts from discarded christmas trees? ...playing step ball ...trading comic books .... flipping baseball cards (but only your \"doubles\") .... A great site.\n\nJoe <xcjoe@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, de USA - Sunday, September 28, 2003 at 20:03:43 (EDT) My personal memories of Willie Gaylord are when he was on WTUX (studios on Market Street near 12th) in the early morning hours of the Fall of 1952. The name of his show was \"Wake Up With Willie\" and it came in perfectly down in Newark into the 4th floor of Harter Hall at the U of D. Not many local radio stations were then able to penetrate the band of radio interference sent up by the ore in Iron Hill, down between Newark and Glasgow. It's funny, but the big New York stations like WOR and WNEW never had any trouble getting their signal into Newark.\n\nBob <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nUSA - Friday, September 26, 2003 at 19:29:04 (EDT) Geez- I'm feeling mighty old.

I am originally from Wilm., on of those Catholic school girls from St. Lizzies. Does anyone remember curb service at Greenhill Dairy and the Chuck Wagon. Hot summers swimming at Canby Pool, block parties in the Knights of Columbus Parking Lot. Dances at St Lizzies, Newport Fire Hall, Sallies where the priests would serparate you if you were dancing too close, dancing at Zion Methodist church in Newport and Greenhill Church on Lancaster. Ice skating at twin lakes and sledding at Hercules Country Club. For anyone in my group that remembers playing cards on bleachers at the baseball diamond down near the woods at Canby Park where the broken down house was and all that was left were parts of the wall to the house but the stone fireplace still stood. Remember the cops chasing us down the alleys of the homes in Cleland Heights. Memories, oh what memories. If any of my old friends read this, I would love to hear from you so we could catch up. I almost forgot the best subs in DE at Filomena's Sub shop on I believe 2nd street and when they closed the next best was I believe Katie's sub shop on Lincoln St. I just love this site and can't wait to pass it on to all my friends that I still keep in touch with.\n\nMaria Aiello Green <dadonnamg@aol.com>\n\nLewes, DE USA - Monday, September 22, 2003 at 22:13:43 (EDT) To Leonard Ploener: Any relation to Burt Ploener, who went to P.

It was the only thing at that intersection back in the late 40's and early 50's. Besides the gas pumps and the garage, there was a large square building where they served food, I guess, I only remember the ice cream - they had the best black raspberry ice cream around. Even better than Lynnthwaites - which came along later. I know a lady that used to work there, pumping gas, and she later went to work at Lynnthwaites, when Lynnthwaites was in the ground floor of the barn on the southbound side of Concord Pike (before they moved into the new building on the northbound lanes).\n\nBruce <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, USA - Tuesday, September 16, 2003 at 23:14:39 (EDT) In reply to Bruce's query about the name of the riding stables out on Limestone Road, this was the site of Carousel Farms.

There was another dance hall in N.J. and all I remember about that was Oscar that DuMont broadcast from there. There were lots of big bands that came to the DuPont CC and also to the University of Delaware fraternity dances.

I remember now that, when we rode the Edgemoor bus in the winter, we used to sit in the back seat, as that's where the most heat was, from the engine. I didn't ride that bus much, living in Hillcrest, I mostly rode the Bellefonte trackless trolley. My sister-in-law used to live on Denny Road in the Terrace, so it was only when I was with my older brother and her that I rode the Edgemoor bus - going downtown to the movies, or whatever. One of my homes in Hillcrest was a block from Petrillo's quarry, so I remember that area well. In the evening, after the workers went home, we used to climb the rock face of the quarry - it's a wonder none of us got killed. I went to MTP (Duncan Rd.) from 1st through 9th grade, then switched to Brown Voc. I was in the senior class of 1960 and 1961. Don't know what class you were in, but don't remember Joanne Garvey, or what our favorite food was at the Spic & Span. I'll get sis to refresh my memory when she gets home.\n\nBruce Dunlap <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, USA - Friday, September 05, 2003 at 14:53:17 (EDT) You're right, Bruce- the #20 Edgemoor bus was a diesel bus. My pal Alex Pondok and I lived on Salisbury Drive in Edgemoor Terrace, and had moved out of the P. S. duPont School District, but still went there for about six months. We used to take the #20 bus in to 10th & Market and transfer to the 12 Boulevard out to P. S. at 34th Street. After school, we'd walk down Monroe St to Lea Blvd, to Sears at Market St, up thru Shellpot to Edgemoor Road, past the quarry (it's now filled in; we always hoped that they'd hit water there so we could have a great swimming hole) and home to Edgemoor. That got to be quite a hassle, so we both transferred to Mount Pleasant (the old school on Duncan Rd.) Back to the Spic & Span: when we frequented that great spot, the thing to order was a grilled cheese sandwich with barbecue sauce. Was that a hot item when you went there? And did you know Joanne Garvey, who lived in the Gate House on the Bellevue estate? She was in my class at Mount Pleasant.\n\nBill Fisher <whfisher@earthlink.net>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Friday, September 05, 2003 at 12:08:28 (EDT) Further thought on the bus aubject: I don't think the Edgemoor route was a trackless trolley, I think it was always a bus route. That would explain why there were no overhead wires going on the bridge over the Gov. Printz. Sound plausible?\n\nBruce Dunlap <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Friday, September 05, 2003 at 11:36:07 (EDT) Bill, that area by the duPont plant, and all along Hay Road was also great for geese hunting, and rabbits, too. Also, in the marshy areas, there were BIG snapping turtles, too. That area is where I learned how to hunt, I grew up just up the hill in Hillcrest. Do you remember when there were a few houses in front of the duPont plant, and the Edgemoor bus route used to got to the plant? I remember that, but wonder now, how the bus went there, because that was a trackless trolley route, and I don't remember the wires going over the Edgemoor Road bridge to that area - but they must have, or was it a special bus that went over to that area? Hmmmm....\n\nBruce Dunlap <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Friday, September 05, 2003 at 11:33:05 (EDT) The hunting we did that particular day was in a heavily wooded area which is now the communities of Northwood, Green Acres and Webster Farm... on the east side of Marsh Road, just south of what's now the Graylyn Crest Shopping Center. We also used to go for ducks down near the Delaware River near duPont's Edgemoor plant (go over the Governor Printz Blvd on Edgemoor Road toward the river). There were lots of marshy, reedy swamplands there that the ducks used to like. I didn't know you could hunt on Willie duPont's Bellevue estate... or was that a \"special privilege\"?\n\nBill Fisher <whfisher@earthlink.net>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Thursday, September 04, 2003 at 23:04:02 (EDT) Bill Fisher ... Where did you hunt in the Penny Hill Spic & Span area? I grew up on one of the duPont estates on the Phila. Pike just north of the Spic. Did a little hunting and trapping in that area, also. Visited the Spic many times to \"cap\" off an evening. If I remember correctly, Smitty was the night manager.\n\nDelmer Nicholson <barnicho@aol.com>\n\nCincinnati, USA - Thursday, September 04, 2003 at 19:45:02 (EDT) I remember ice skating from my house on 36th and Washington all the way up to PS.

We were able to capture one of them, and left it as a tip underneath an overturned milk shake container on the drive-in tray when we stopped there after our big hunting adventure. (The field mouse was the only thing we bagged that day.) We didn't stick around to hear the shrieks when the container was thrown away. Chances are your sister wasn't the victim, but she might have heard about the little joke. (Seems to me we DID leave a monetary tip as well, though; we weren't THAT cruel!)\n\nBill Fisher <WHFisher>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Wednesday, September 03, 2003 at 23:35:54 (EDT) I may be able to answer your question about the cost of milkshakes in a week, Bud. My sister-in-law used to \"car-hop\" at the Spic & Span on Penny Hill in the '50's. She's away on vacation right now, but when she gets home, I'll ask her. Just guessing, myself, I'd say probably 25 cents - as a fountain coke used to cost a nickle then.\n\nBruce Dunlap <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Wednesday, September 03, 2003 at 22:52:45 (EDT) I don't ever think I've had a better shake than the ones that used to hang in the trays on the door of the car at either Wilmington's or Newport's Greenhill Dairy places.\n\nBob <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nUSA - Wednesday, September 03, 2003 at 21:33:01 (EDT) Anyone remember how much a milkshake cost back in the 40's and 50's ?\n\nBud <bu49@poolesite.com>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Wednesday, September 03, 2003 at 18:52:09 (EDT) IF I REMEMBER RIGHT THE HOP HAD THE BEST CHOCOLATE MILK SHAKES\n\nmary roush sealing <gramma5@aol.com>\n\nlaurel, md USA - Wednesday, September 03, 2003 at 17:25:55 (EDT) Sadly, The Hop is gone now, too.

We went to the Ivystone and I had Fried Shrimp and he had Fried Chicken -- it was where the Hop is now -- on the corner of Limestone Road and Kirkwood Highway.\n\nCarla Payne <cmarbrey@prodigy.net>\n\nGarner, NC USA - Tuesday, September 02, 2003 at 17:07:24 (EDT) A question: two diners, one was between S. King St. and S. Market St., on the river side of the PRR tracks (I guess that's called Water St.), and one was at Maryland Avenue and Front St./Lancaster Avenue. What were their names? I think one of them was the Country Girl Diner, but can't remember which it was; and what was the name of the other one? What do other people think about splitting the classification up between restaurants and diners - in the list? I would like to see them separated, I think it would make it easier to find one or the other. Just a thought.\n\nBruce Dunlap <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Sunday, August 31, 2003 at 13:23:32 (EDT) Jann's Steak House was spelled with two \"n\"s. Remember cruising from the DanDee and the B&G (affectionately known as the \"Blood & Guts\"), and Jann's to downtown, down Market St., out 4th St. to Union, then out Union to the Chuck Wagon and back? It used to be a ritual every weekend. In re: Mike Rowe (7/15), the article he mentions, about Philly Cheese Steaks was in a recent Philadelphia Magazine insert in the Philly Inquirer. It said that a real Philly cheese steak had to have real Cheez Whiz - what a misnomer, there's nothing real about Cheez Whiz, it's all fake. If that's how they like 'em in Philly, let them have them. We'll keep our Wilmington cheese steaks, made with real steak and topped with real cheese. Being from north of the city, my favorite cheese steak places were Jann's and Penny Hill Sub & Steak Shop. I hear the original owner of Penny Hill (Pete) is still doing well, and is retired in Fla., good for him. Mike also mentioned getting the rejected 7 Up's from the 7 Up plant on Phila. Pike, how about the Mundorff plant that was on 31nd St., I believe, (next to Harding Sign Co.) which backed-up to the Food Fair (32nd & Market) parking lot. If you went to the window of the bottling plant when it was running, someone would always hand you an \"Upper Ten\" or whatever was being run on the line at the time. In re: Bob Wilson (7/7), Screamin' Jay Hawkins had a lot of songs, I think his most popular one was \"I Put A Spell On You\". And, Bob Whare (7/20), I remember the Western Union boy on the bike; the Western Union office was on 9th St., near, or next to, Hubers. And, someone else mentioned the Spic & Span on Penny Hill, I have a sister-in-law who was a car-hop there in the mid-50's. Ok, enough from me for one day (I've got more, for sure - how about the headless horseman out in Beaver Valley) Remember him? Parking along the Brandywine, all the places to pull off, that are filled with large boulders now?\n\nBruce Dunlap <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Sunday, August 31, 2003 at 13:01:22 (EDT) Again, a vote for the best subs in Northern Delaware (back in the 1950's anyway), for Angie's, off Cleveland Avenue in Newark, washed down with a pint of chocolate milk/drink. And who could forget the late-night snack of Tastykakes and Orange Drink from \"Pop's\", next to Harter Hall on West Main Street? As Pop used to say to every customer, male or female, \"Put it in a bag for you, honey?\"\n\nWilso <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nStamford, CT USA - Sunday, August 31, 2003 at 11:12:21 (EDT) Don't know about spaghetti, but the best pizza in Wilmington was at Remedio's on Lancaster Ave. and I think Scott.\n\nPat LeVan <LeVan1706@aol.com>\n\nPort St. Lucie, FL USA - Sunday, August 31, 2003 at 09:54:54 (EDT) I would say the best spagetti and other Italian dishes were at Marconi's wich was a small place on Lancaster Ave near 4th street. Thye were very reasonable and made delicious meals that were of the true Southern Italian style. It was actually a corner row home that had been converted into an eating establishment. I can still remember the delicious dishes and the deserts.\n\nMario Le Pera <melepera@aol.com>\n\nHarrisonburg, VA USA - Sunday, August 31, 2003 at 08:32:40 (EDT) I agree that the ORIGINAL Katies at 6th & Scott had the best spagetti, but not the following owners - they weren't a shadow of the original.\n\nBruce Dunlap <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Saturday, August 30, 2003 at 12:30:23 (EDT) Best spaghetti in town?

Anyone have more candidates?\n\nBill Fisher <whfisher@earthlink.net>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Saturday, August 30, 2003 at 11:27:07 (EDT) I grew up in Richardson Park and remember all the stores and hangouts along Maryland Avenue. Chef's Diner and the Tastee Freeze as well as Park Pharmacy and movies at the Crest theater. We showed off our cars at Greenhill right before Newport then went out to the Chuck Wagon. It was just like the movie American Grafetti.\n\nMike Oller <mgotrans@yahoo.com>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Thursday, August 28, 2003 at 22:15:19 (EDT) I remember filling green stamp books and spending them at the green stamp catalog place which was next to Penn Fruit.

Jen Hanna's Esso was diectly across the street. Ernie Hahn's Sunoco was on the Concord Ave./24th Street triangle (remember the outside lift for cars? There was no inside bay)Concord Liquors was on the other corner and the business was owned by Herman Decktor (the apartment building was owned by a Mr. White)A little past Concord Liquors was a dry cleaners (don't know the name of it, but Mildred Dumphy worked there)Across and down toward Madison St.from the cleaners was Samuel DiLapo paper hangers and next to DiLapo's, on the corner in a big white house, was Dr. Rovitti.\n\nMarty Schueler Jones <MJJJJ78@aol.com>\n\nRehoboth Beach, DE USA - Thursday, August 28, 2003 at 14:29:46 (EDT) I just found this site, and have barely scratched the surface of it so far. I hope to be able to contribute some memories, and many more names and places from my rememberances that I don't see listed, as yet. I also see some spelling that needs to be corrected, and addresses that need some fine-tuning, etc.; I hope to be able to help with that. I don't want to mess up the good work that has been done so far, so will hold my comments until I have had a chance to more fully check out the site. This is a wonderful project, and I hope more people learn of it soon, and can contribute more memories often. I will pose one question today: In regards to radio personalities, I don't ever remember \"Dancin'\" Dan Casey ever being on WILM, I remember him being on WAMS and, until not too long ago, sometimes filling in on WNRK in Newark. Is it my memory playing tricks, or can someone else confirm this. Dan Casey should still be in the area, probably retired now, maybe he watches this site? Would be good to hear fom him. Best wishes to this site, and I hope to be a good contributor. Oh, I was in the Class of 1960 & 1961 of Brown Vocational.\n\nBruce Dunlap <spyderxl@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Thursday, August 28, 2003 at 11:01:05 (EDT) Bill, the store on the corner across Concord from the Sun station was a liquor store, and next to it was the dry cleaner. The first complete glass of beer that I ever drank was from a quart of Diamond State purchased at that liquor store by the elder sister of one of my PS classmates. It was consumed by four of us in the living room of a house on McCabe Place while we watched an afternoon Hopalong Cassidy movie on Channel 6. The actor William Boyd (\"Hoppy\") made a fortune from the TV reruns of these old Hoppy movies because he had purchased them outright from Monogram Pictures or whoever, after their initial release and rerelease some five years before they showed up on TV.\n\nBob Wilson <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nUSA - Thursday, August 28, 2003 at 07:09:31 (EDT) Yes, I remember the SunOCo station very well. I seem to remember the store on the other corner at Concord & Monroe as being a Laundry/Dry Cleaner at one time, and at another it was a delicatessen-type shop, run by an Arabic family. But maybe it was the store next door to the corner (it's a bit hazy now)... anyone remember? And the appearance of the floppy disk signed the death warrant for IBM cards. If you've ever keypunched about 500 cards and submitted them for your job to run (overnight!) and just as you got to the computer room, dropped the deck of cards (500 pickup!),you can appreciate the advantages of the floppy. The early floppies were 8 inches square... BIG suckers, and they held a whopping 256K of data (or something on that order. That's pretty hazy too. Some of you old-timers please fill me in...!!\n\nBill Fisher <whfisher@earthlink.net>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Thursday, August 28, 2003 at 02:27:25 (EDT) Robin, Bill, the Hines family, et al - I remember that there was also a Sun Oil gas station on the southern vee between 24th and Concord (or at least that's what it was in 1949 thru 1951). I remember this distinctly because, although Sun didn't have credit cards then, they had books of punched IBM cards called \"Sunchex,\" which were mailed to you. When he bought gas for his sharp new 1950 Buick, my dad used to fill out the amount on the card and hand it to the attendant. They then punched in the code for the amount and sent it on to Sun. A month later, you'd get the bill. Whatever happened to IBM punch cards anyway? They disappeared from the scene back in about 1980.\n\nBob Wilson <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nUSA - Wednesday, August 27, 2003 at 22:54:04 (EDT) To Marty Schueler: I lived at 2200 Monroe St, at the corner of 22nd and Monroe, behind McCabe Church from about 1944 to 1947. That was my grandmother's house, and my mom and I lived with her when WWII and my parents' divorce were in their final stages. We were about 3 squares (right, Bob Wilson?) from Fell's Drug store. I remember your dad, Walter Schueler very well. Did you live above the store, or in the house next door on Concord Avenue? I assume you lived above, since you say that your dad \"came downstairs to open the store\"... I guess I never really knew where you lived; you were all just \"part of the store\". I can't seem to find it in the archives, but I related to Bob Wilson some time ago how your dad used to dip out the Breyer's Ice Cream into little flat-bottomed cardboard dishes lined with wax tissue to protect the ice cream... I bought many a quart of Breyer's Peach Ice Cream there! Does anyone recall another ice cream parlor called \"Robin's\", on the corner of 14th and Washington, across 14th street from the hospital? It was owned by Robin Lindsey, who lived very near Fell's Drugs. He lived about two or three houses from 24th Street on Monroe. There was an ESSO station at 24th & Concord, right across from Fell's. Robin lived across Monroe from the station... but I digress-- Robin's claim to fame was a mastery of dipping ice cream and tossing a round scoop of it from the dipper in one hand, over his shoulders and head, catching it in the metal milk shake container (or even a cone) in the other hand! He had all the kids watching with their eyes like saucers, waiting for him to miss one of them, but I never saw that, even once... His shop was the quintessential \"ice cream parlor\" with the ceiling fans, tiny tables with wireback chairs (2 to a table), and all the other things that used to define the classic \"soda shop\". Great times.\n\nBill Fisher <whfisher@earthlink.net>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Wednesday, August 27, 2003 at 18:27:37 (EDT) Hooray for the last three posts! And thanks to Bill, Marty and Bud for posting them. They said it for all of us who are now looking back more than half a century, from three different and unique persepctives. To quote Cronkite, \"..and that's the way it was...\" Indeed.\n\nBob Wilson <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nUSA - Tuesday, August 26, 2003 at 22:38:51 (EDT) I remember that Sunday morning when the US was attacked by Japan. How that changed things. My father had a gas sticker that allowed him so much gas. We had coupon books for meat. My mother was a block warden and we had practice air raid alerts and all our lights had to be out and curtains drawn. I became a voulnteer aircraft spotter watching for and reporting all planes that flew over our booth at the Porter Reservour. (I was 13 at the time but felt I was doing my part)I remember hearing on the radio when the first atomic bomb was dropped. Then later the celebration in downtown Wilmington when the war was over. Then the boys that my sisters knew started coming home - kids when they left and men when they came home. We had so little compared to what we can have now but yet we had so much.\n\nBud <bu49@poolesite.com>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Tuesday, August 26, 2003 at 12:55:32 (EDT) My parents owned Schueler's Pharmacy at Concord Ave. and Monroe Street. My father was the pharmacist. He opened the store every morning at 8AM and closed at 10PM, staying there all day. In the late 50's, he got radical and changed the hours to 9-9 and only stayed open until 1 on Sunday. People in the neighborhood called him Doc Schueler and he knew everyone by name. He often filled prescriptions by putting the compounds in a motar, crushing and mixing them with a pestle, and then filling the clear capsules by hand. All prescriptions would be put in a small box or bottle and wrapped in white paper. They would often be delivered to a customer's home by one of \"the boys\" who worked in the store and rode the store's bike for the delivery. Up until about 1959, the store had a fountain with stools that spun around. Big glass jars on the counter held pretzels (2 for a penny)Lance Crackers and Mr. Peanut peanut bags. Breyer's ice cream was hand dipped, Coke was dispensed from a machine and Sundaes were piled high with all kinds of gooey goodies. The \"paper\" was 5 cents and later went to an astonishing 7 cents. The Sunday paper was 35 cents. It was delivered to the store early in the morning and if a customer got to the store before it opened, they would take a paper and leave their money in a ciger box that was left on the step. Cigarettes were 27 cents for regulars and 29 cents for king size. Peppermint Patties, Hershey Bars, Life Savers, packs of gum and all the other candy bars were 5 cents. Luden's cherry cough drops were a pricey 10 cents. When a gentleman came in and said, \"I'd like to see the pharmacist\", one always knew to discreetly retire to the Rx room while my father retrieved a box from the only unlabled drawer. The mystery drawer, which I was not allowed to open, contained condoms. When I was 12, I (the pharmacist's daughter)became the first girl to be one of \"the boys\". I worked 15 hours a week and every other weekend and got paid 35 cents an hour (and all the free ice cream I could eat) Those were wonderful times of front porch sitting, neighborhood friends, bike riding (who ever heard of a helmet then! how did we survive?) The biggest event would be when 2 cars crashed at Concord and Monroe and the fire engines would roar up 24th Street. My father died in June 1963 at the age of 55. He went downstairs on a Saturday morning to open the store, had a massive heart attack and died in the very spot he stood to fill all the prescriptions over the years. My life changed forever after that Saturday morning. My mother sold the business, I married in 1966 and moved to Maine, my mother sold the entire house in the early 80's and moved. By then the neighborhood had gotten rough around the edges, and now, I would not even venture there to show my grandchildren the old homestead. Aren't we all lucky to have such memories though? I often wonder what memories my children and grandchildren will fondly keep in their hearts. I hope they are as good!\n\nMarty Schueler Jones <MJJJJ78@aol.com>\n\nRehoboth Beach, DE USA - Tuesday, August 26, 2003 at 10:47:55 (EDT) A little house with three bedrooms and one car on the street; A mower that you had to push to make the grass look neat. In the kitchen on the wall we only had one phone, And no need for recording things - someone was always home. We only had a living room where we would congregate, Unless it was at meal time in the kitchen where we ate. We had no need for family rooms or extra rooms to dine; When meeting as a family, those two rooms would work out fine. We only had one TV set, and channels? Maybe two, But always there was one of them with something worth the view. For snacks we had potato chips that tasted like a chip, And if you wanted flavor, there was Lawson's onion dip. Store-bought snacks were rare because my mother liked to cook, And nothing can compare to snacks in Betty Crocker's book. The snacks were even healthy, with the best ingredients; There was no label with a hundred things that absolutely made no sense. Weekends were for family trips or staying home to play. We all did things together, even going to church to pray. When we did our weekend trips, depending on the weather, No one stayed at home because we liked to be together. Sometimes we would separate to do things on our own, But we knew where the others were without our own cell phone. Then there were the movies with our favorite movie star, And nothing can compare to watching movies in the car. There were the picnics at the peak of summer season - Pack a lunch and find some trees and never need a reason. Get a baseball game together with the friends you know - Have real action playing ball and no game video. Remember when the doctor used to be the family friend And didn't need insurance or a lawyer to defend The way that he took care of you or what he had to do, Because he took an oath and strived to do the best for you? Remember when the country was united under God And prayer in schools and public places was not deemed as odd? Remember when the church was used for worshipping the Lord And not used for commercial use or for some business board? Remember going to the store and shopping casually, And when you went to pay for it, you used your own money? Nothing that you had to swipe or punch in some amount - Remember when the cashier person really had to count? Remember when we breathed the air it smelled so fresh and clean And chemicals were not used on the grass to keep it green? The milk man and the bread man used to go from door to door - It was just a few cents more than going to the store. There was a time when mailed letters came right to your door, Without a lot of junk mail ads sent out by every store. The mailman knew each house by name and knew where it was sent; There were not loads of mail addressed to \"Present Occupant.\" Remember when the words \"I do\" meant that you really did, And not just temporarily until someone blew their lid? There was no such thing as no one's fault; we just made a mistake - There was a time when married life was built on give and take. There was a time when just one glance was all that it would take And you would know the kind of car, the model, and the make. They didn't look like turtles trying to squeeze every mile - They were streamlined, white walls, and fins and really had some style. One time the music that you played whenever you would jive Was from a vinyl, big-holed record called a forty-five; The record player had a post to keep them all in line, And then the records would drop down and play one at a time. Oh, sure, we had our problems then just like we do today, And always we were striving, trying for a better way. And every year that passed us by brought new and greater things - We now can even program phones with music or with rings. Oh, the simple life we lived still seems like so much fun. How can you explain a game where you just kick the can and run? And why would boys put baseball cards between bicycle spokes? And for a nickel, red machines had little bottles Cokes. This life seemed so much easier and slower in some ways; I love the new technology, but I sure miss those days. So time moves on and so do we, and nothing stays the same, But I sure love to reminisce and walk down memory lane!\n\nBill Fisher <whfisher@earthlink.net>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Tuesday, August 26, 2003 at 10:16:55 (EDT) To Bob: The Kozy Korner restaurant is now on Union Street.

Most of our team was made up of graduates from A.I. dupont. We won the tri-county championship one year. The drive-in on Greenhill Ave was Geeenhill Dairies drive-in. Good Food.

I worked the summer between my junior and senior years in high school at Eckerd's in the 500 block of Market St. Sam Ireland was the manager and I worked in the pharamacy with Doc Reiter, Doc Hambright and Huey Wolfe. I counted capsules and pills and typed the labels on prescription bottles besides answering the phone and waiting on customers. I hated it when people came in for Insulin because I had to go down to a dark, scary basement to a refrigerator to get the medicine. During my senior year, I also worked weekends and at Christmas and Easter vacations. It was a fun job and paid better than the 5and10's. Between that job and babysitting, I financed fun times in Rehoboth. A dorm room with the girls at the \"White House\" cost $2.50 a night. Fun times.\n\nPat LeVan <LeVan1706@aol.com>\n\nPort St. Lucie, FL USA - Friday, July 25, 2003 at 11:37:15 (EDT) I went to St Paul's Elementary School in Wilmington. Attended Wilmington High School, both old and new. I remember Stellini's Bakery very well, we lived three houses up from the bakery on 2nd Street and it was a wonderful smell to wake up to ( fresh Baked Rolls and Sweet donuts). The Firehouse at 2nd & Jackson Streets was a gret place to hang around as a kid in the Summer Days, Fannie's Store on 2nd & Van Buren ( boy was she tough), Goldberg's Grocery store acroos the street and the store Katty corner to Fannie's that sold frozen chocolate covered bananas. During the summers everyone would sit out FRONT on the steps to catch a cool breeze, if there was one. Market Street was where everyone went on Friday night or on Saturday afternoon to shop. The Christmas Parade was held at night when I was a child and it was a sight to behold. The bands the Christmas lights on Market Street and avereyone seemed so happy. The stores on Market Street were also beautiful, Braunstein's with it's Manned Elevator and quiet elegance took your breath away. West End Park at Maple & Franklin with the King & Queen chairs in the rocks, that we were not supposed to climb. Canby Pool, the Ace Theater, Maida's Drugstore, Banjo's Sub Shop, Watson's Grocery Store at Read & Jackson, all great memories.

Representatives from Wilmington HS, PS DuPont, Mount Pleasant, Salesianum, HC Conrad, and two, count 'em two, from Newark HS, gathered on a second floor porch hard by the old B&O tracks on Newark's West Main Street, and we had travelled from as far away Washington State, Virginia, Maryland, Connecticut and Greater Wilmington.

After a brief stint in the Menswear Department on the second floor, I settled in servicing the stockroom needs of the Housewares, China and Glassware, Giftware, and Lamp Departments on the main level. One of my tasks was to unpack chinaware from shipping crates as they arrived off the truck out in the loading dock area. Inevitably, the pieces were packed in dampened fine wood shavings called \"excelsior\" to protect the pieces from breakage during shipping. The dampness of the packing often caused the shavings to ferment somewhat, and the aroma was exceedingly unpleasant. The drill was to load the unpacked pieces onto a sturdy heavy metal cart, then roll the loaded cart to the other end of the store where the stockroom was located. At about the center of the store, near the escalators, there was a large, but invisible structural expansion seam under the carpet, which widened during the day to accommodate rising temperatures. One day, pushing a newly unloaded selection of open-stock fancy drinking glasses through the store at an unsafe rate of speed, the cart hit the seam and half of the stock fell from the cart onto the floor, resulting in a considerable amount of breakage. I immediately thought to myself, \"Well, there goes THIS job\"...and was surprised to find out that this accident was merely considered as routine breakage. I WAS warned not to \"cowboy it\" over this speed bump in the future. I lucked out. Some of the people I remember working for there included lanky Bill Klabe, head of the housewares department; his boss, Irv Klose, who looked like Thomas E. Dewey; and the austere Mr. Conklin, who was Klose's boss and the store manager. Henry Skamarucha later took over for Klabe. The other stock clerks I worked with at Wanamaker's included Don \"Doak\" Walker, Don Rodenhiser, George Johnson, and Jimmy Hamilton. Most of us lived in the Ninth Ward. I saw Johnson and Hamilton at our 50th high school reunion in Wilmington last June. Walker now lives in a suburb of Vancouver, Canada, and Rodenhiser lives in Dover. I lasted the summer at Wanamaker's, then came back the following year to work for three weeks, filling in for those on summer vacation. All in all, it was a great job and expanded my horizons to the real world, considerably. Anyone else here want to tell their \"high school job experience stories\" here?\n\nBob <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nStamford, CT USA - Thursday, July 17, 2003 at 07:03:03 (EDT) 4th of July Fireworks in Caeser Rodney Square\n\nMike Tarvin <jmtarvin@hotmail.com>\n\nPapillion, NE USA - Thursday, July 17, 2003 at 00:13:37 (EDT) I NEVER HAD A PHILLY CHEESE STEAK WITH CHEESE WHIZ AND NEVER WILL !!

I forget his name, but the Sports Page had a great cartoonist whose style I always admired, too. The way I heard it, there were once two afternoon newspapers in Wilmington...\"The Wilmington Evening Journal\" and the Wilmington \"Every Evening\". They merged many many moons ago. And how about the Martin family's \"Sunday Star\"? My HS yearbook class prophecy from 1952 said that, in 20 years, I would have a comic strip running in the \"Star.\" Bad prophecy...the \"Star\" died in April, 1954. You could look it up.\n\nBob <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nUSA - Wednesday, July 09, 2003 at 22:05:06 (EDT) Bill - you are right about where Roebelen's was. I've got some names mized up here. Roebelen's also did a big trade in sheet music and pianos as well as 'classical' discs. What the heck was the name of that record store down on Market, almost next to Loew's Aldine, circa 1950. And there was another record store on the south side of West 4th Street, just west of Market Street, that also carried 'race' and/or 'rhythm and blues' records, which none of the 'uptown stores' did. That place had an integrated cutomer base, back in the time that that was a rarity in Wilmington. But I seem to remember that it was destroyed in a big fire. ?\n\nBob <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nUSA - Wednesday, July 09, 2003 at 21:55:10 (EDT) Hmmmmm... I seem to remember Robelen's Music right next to or very near Huber's Sporting Goods, on the south side of 9th St between Orange and Tatnall. Am I wrong? The memories are getting dimmer and dimmer... And does anyone remember a little store called the \"Old Dutch Shop\" on 7th St (maybe 8th) between Market and King? They sold all sorts of sewing, knitting and crocheting items: buttons, zippers, yarn, thread... you name it, they probably had it. And how about the Buster Brown Shoe Store down around 4th and Market, where you put on a new pair of shoes and stuck your feet inside a big box with a viewer on top. You could see right through both your shoes and your feet, on a bright green screen, to see how they fit! If we only knew then how dangerous those fluoroscopes were...\n\nBill Fisher <whfisher@earthlink.net>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Wednesday, July 09, 2003 at 16:15:08 (EDT) Don't remember the name of the music store around 8th and Orange. I do remember Huber's Sporting Goods and Hanby Stationers being near there. Speaking of the News-Journal Building, do you all remember when the evening paper was called the \"Journal-Every-Evening\". Remember the great comic page with Major Hoople, Out Our Way with Freckles and his friends (Lard was one of them) and Boots and Her Buddies with Cora and the Professor and Pug, Lil' Abner and Mutt and Jeff. Anybody remember any other favorites?\n\nPat LeVan <LeVan1706@aol.com>\n\nPort St. Lucie, FL USA - Wednesday, July 09, 2003 at 13:38:19 (EDT) Yep, Ed Ames was one of the Ames Brothers of \"Ragg Mopp\" fame. Back in '72 I was working at UCLA in the Graduate School of Management building, and used to see him often in the snack bar. And Pat Le Van, you're right-- he did play an Indian (\"Mingo\") on the TV show \"Daniel Boone\" from '64 to '68, but was never associated with the Four Aces. He is/was an accomplished actor as well as a singer. As for MacAbee's, I remember it as being on 7th St between Market and King. And Mullin's? I worked there while in college over Christmas vacation in '58. I worked in Men's Haberdashery and kept asking myself, \"Are you SURE Harry Truman started this way???\" The song (It's No) Sin? Here's the lyrics; I just listened to my copy in .MP3 format: Take away the breath of flowers It would surely be a sin Take the rain from April showers It's a sin... Take away the violins, dear From a lovely symphony And the music deep within Would cease to be. Is it a sin To love you so To hold you close and know You are leaving Though you take away my heart, dear Still the beating there within I'll keep loving you forever For it's no sin.\n\nBill Fisher <whfisher@earthlink.net>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Tuesday, July 08, 2003 at 01:02:45 (EDT) Best act ever at the Olde Mill was \"Screamin' Jay\" Hawkins, but I couldn't tell you the name of one thing he ever sang. Well done, Pat LeVan, for the lyrics to \"Ir's No Sin.\" I remember Roebelen's well, and the listening booths. I first heard Johnnie Ray there, and one of my show-biz-hip buddies tried to tell me that Johnnie was a young black girl, but I knew better. I actually saw him perform in a dinky little night club in Greenwich Village in NYC back in the early 1960's. Phyllis Diller was in the audience. I can't place MacAbee's at any of the locations so far. It must be selective memory lapse. What was the name of the classy music store up near the old News Journal building near 8th and Orange? That's where you went if you wanted to find the latest RCA Red Seal or Columbia Masterworks 45rpm disks. Arthur Fieldler and the Boston Pops recorded for RCA.\n\nBob Wilson <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nStamford,"
