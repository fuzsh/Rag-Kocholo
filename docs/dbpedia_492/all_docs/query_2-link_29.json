        "text": "https://www.viewlogies.net/east-lawn-east-sac/znlX_ArLu?pin=820747\n\nJack Sanders, Jr. was a lifelong resident of California - except for studying at Oregon State University - born in San Francisco and died in Sacramento. Oregon was the major turning point in his life because it’s where he met his partner of 59 years, Lorna Harman. They were married in Portland and settled initially in San Francisco. They moved to Chico, CA after that, and landed in Sacramento in 1976.\n\nTheir sons Jack III and Stetson rounded out a happy family that lived in College Glen for 46 years.\n\nPeople who really knew Jack Sanders, Jr. witnessed what it’s like to be filled with limitless optimism and enthusiasm. He loved this world and the people in it. He set an example of cheerful countenance every day and wanted everyone to share in his joy for life.\n\nJack died peacefully on Sunday 9/24/2023 with his wife and sons around him. As heavy as it was to watch him pass and as hard as it is not to have him here, the family draws strength from a deep well of gratitude for getting to share this life with him. The original cancer diagnosis was in 2007, and miracles of science, good vibes, prayer, and Jack’s incredible fighting spirit gave him 16 more years of laughs and travel with his wife, visits with friends, bike trips, cribbage games, dog walks, and talks with his grandsons.\n\nJack’s celebration of life and his impact on those who knew him will be at the Chapel at East Lawn Memorial Park, 4300 Folsom Blvd, Sacramento at 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday 10/17/23. A reception will follow in the greenhouse with light refreshments and visiting."
