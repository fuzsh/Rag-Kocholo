        "text": "As if being a Grammy Award-winning producer and record company president (Blue Note) wasn’t enough, Don Was has rededicated himself to live performance during the past couple of years — including membership in Grateful Dead co-founder Bob Weir’s Wolf Bros and touring with Ryan Adams’ Cardinals.\n\nSo something like the Pan-Detroit Ensemble was probably inevitable.\n\nThe group, which began its first tour earlier this week, including former Was (Not Was) bandmates Luis Resto on keyboards and Dave McMurray on saxophone along with vocalist Steffanie Christi’an, guitarist Wayne Gerard, drummer Jeff Canaday, percussionist Mahindi Masai, Vincent Chandler on trombone and John Douglas on trumpet. The repertoire is diverse — a Was (Not Was)-like blend of jazz, R&B, funk and rock similar to “The Don Was Motor City Playlist” Friday nights on WDET-FM — but Was promises that the delivery will leave no doubt about the band’s musical roots.\n\n“There’s a Detroit ethos in that band,” explains Was (nee Fagenson), 71, who was raised and began his musical career in Oak Park. His long list of credits includes work with Bonnie Raitt, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Bob Seger, the B-52’s, Barenaked Ladies and many more. “There’s a sound to Detroit music that’s embodied by this particular group of people playing together.\n\n“It’s got a real flavor to it. It’s like a less rigid kind of Was (Not Was) almost. It’s got a groove, but people are stretching out more and hopefully we’re building enough freedom in the arrangements so that every show will have its own character.”\n\nThe Pan-Detroit Ensemble grew out of Was booking with the Detroit Symphony’s Paradise Jazz Series that was made some time back, and as he assembled the band Was was so happy with the chemistry that “we booked a whole bunch of dates.” The ensemble will play nine shows through June 2 and is already lining up a fall itinerary. And Was anticipates it will be a going concern amidst his other endeavors.\n\n“I’m gonna do this for a long time, man,” promises Was, who will be returning during July for his annual All-Starr Revue at the Concert of Colors and a fundraising bowling event for WDET. “I love this band. There’s a great energy around it, which is surprising considering no one’s seen a show yet. But tells you how good these players are, y’know?”\n\nDon Was and the Pan-Detroit Ensemble performs at 8 p.m. Friday, May 24 at Orchestra Hall, 3711 Woodward Ave., Detroit. 313-576-5111 or dso.org.\n\nOther music events of note this weekend (all subject to change) include …\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 24\n\n• Veronika Eberle performs Brahms’ Violin Concerto in D Major with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra through Sunday, May 26 at Orchestra Hall, 3711 Woodward Ave., Detroit.
