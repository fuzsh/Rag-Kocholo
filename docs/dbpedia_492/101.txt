The seven-track collection was released on American label Eastlawn Records, and comes hot on the heels of their 2021 album Theme for a New Nation, which pays tribute to South African jazz veteran Abdullah Ibrahim.

Uqgozi, which means ‘inspiration’ in Zulu, boasts a collection of songs featuring music from renowned South African musicians, including trumpeter Mongezi Feza and pianist Nduduzo Makhathini, as well as Nigerian Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti. It was arranged by Jeff Cuny and guest saxophonist Salim Washington.

The songs comprise a collection of powerful horn solos, virtuosic jazz improvisation and new renditions of classic African jazz songs, including ‘Part of a Whole’ and ‘Pata Pata’ by South African musicians Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba respectively, and ‘Water No Get Enemy’ by Fela Kuti.

The album continues the Detroit-based bandleaders’ journey of the African music scene. The two musicians are long-time friends and collaborators who have dedicated decades to studying, performing and celebrating the sounds of South Africa. Their debut Africa-facing album The Sun Messengers was released in 1980 and won the two musicians several awards.
