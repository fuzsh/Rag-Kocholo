        "text": "A scene from this novel was the inspiration for the bull sculpture by Theophilus A. Brouwer’s Pine-Wold Park at Westhampton.\n\nQuo Vadis? is an historical novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz, published in Polish under its Latin title in 1896. Sienkiewicz studied the Roman Empire extensively and won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1905 for his book, which was translated into more than forty languages.\n\nThe title means “where are you going?” and alludes to a New Testament verse John 13:36 – “Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.” Set in ancient Rome during the reign of the emperor Nero, Quo Vadis? tells the story of the love that develops between a young Christian woman and a Roman officer who, after meeting her fellow Christians, converts to Christianity. Underlying their relationship is the contrast between the worldly opulence of the Roman aristocracy and the poverty, simplicity, and spiritual power of the Christians. The novel has as a subtext of the persecution and political subjugation of Poland by Russia. [1], [2]\n\nFrom Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quo_Vadis_(1951_film\n\nThe characters and events depicted in MGM’s 1951 American epic film by the same name, are a mixture of actual historical figures and situations and fictionalized ones. The film tells the story of a Roman military commander, Marcus Vinicius (Robert Taylor), who is also the legate of the XIV Gemina, returning from the wars, who falls in love with a devout Christian, Lygia (Deborah Kerr), and slowly becomes intrigued by her religion. Their love story is told against the broader historical background of early Christianity and its persecution by Nero (Peter Ustinov). Though she grew up Roman as the adopted daughter of a retired general, Aulus Plautius (Felix Aylmer), Lygia is technically a hostage of Rome. Marcus persuades Nero to give her to him for services rendered. Lygia resents this, but still falls in love with Marcus.\n\nMeanwhile, Nero’s atrocities become increasingly more outrageous and his acts more insane. When he burns Rome and blames the Christians, Marcus goes off to save Lygia and her family. Nero captures them and all the Christians, and condemns them to be killed in the arena. However, Marcus’ uncle, Petronius (Leo Genn), Nero’s most trusted advisor, warns that the Christians will be made martyrs and, tired of Nero’s insanity and suspecting that he might become a victim of his antics too, commits suicide by cutting his veins, sending Nero a farewell letter in which he finally communicates his derisive opinions he had never been able to tell the emperor in fear of his own life. Marcus is arrested for trying to save Lygia. In prison, Peter (Finlay Currie), who has also been arrested after returning to Rome upon a sign of the Lord, marries the couple; eventually, he is crucified upside-down as an ironic twist at the whim of Nero’s guard.\n\nPoppaea (Patricia Laffan), Nero’s wife, who lusts after Marcus, devises a diabolical revenge for his rejection of her. Lygia is tied to a wooden stake in the arena. A wild bull is also placed there, and Lygia’s bodyguard giant, Ursus (Buddy Baer) must try to kill it with his bare hands, otherwise Lygia will be gored to death. Marcus is tied to the spectator’s box and forced to watch, much to the horror of his officers, who also attend the spectacle. When all seems hopeless, Ursus is able to break the bull’s neck. Hugely impressed by Ursus’ courage, the crowd exhorts Nero to spare them, which the emperor is not willing to do. However, Nero’s four other retainers Seneca (Nicholas Hannen), architect Phaon (D. A. Clarke-Smith), Lucan (Alfredo Varelli), and Terpnos (Geoffrey Dunn) vouch for the mob’s demands by putting their thumbs up as well. Marcus then breaks free of his bonds, leaps into the arena, frees Lygia with the help of his loyal troops from his legion, and announces that General Galba is at that moment marching on Rome, intent on replacing Nero.\n\nThe crowd, now firmly believing that Nero, and not the Christians, is responsible for the burning of Rome, revolts. Nero flees to his palace, where he strangles Poppaea to death, blaming her for attempting to scapegoat the Christians. Then Acte (Rosalie Crutchley), a palace slave who was once in unrequited love with Nero, appears and offers to aid him in ending his own life before the mob storms the palace. The cowardly Nero cannot bring himself to do it, so Acte drives the dagger into his chest, weeping over his demise.\n\nMarcus, Lygia and Ursus are now free and leave Rome. By the roadside, Peter’s crook, which he had left behind when he returned to Rome, has miraculously sprouted flowers. The radiant light intones, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.”\n\n[1] The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature"
