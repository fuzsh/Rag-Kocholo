The first, and longest, is Sienkiewicz's Christian fantasy story, \"The Judgment of Peter and Paul on Olympus\". In it the reader finds the two Apostles at Olympus, faced with the ancient Greek gods, Zeus, of course, being foremost, with the muses in attendance. They enter into a debate in which they critique the world of the gods in light of Christian belief and faith, effecting various demonstrations of the strength of their Faith. One could call this short piece an Olympic pastoral idyll. // The second story, \"Be Thou Blessed\" is a brief fantasy about the Hindu god Krishna. ****************************** The text is printed only on the recto of each leaf, in purple ink . Each page of text is bordered with an ornate design. There are two handsome illustrations in monochrome, with tissue guards. One of these is the frontispiece. ************************* Intensely passionate about Polish sovereignty Henryk Sienkiewicz is considered the greatest of Polish authors . His fictional trilogy \"With Fire and Sword\" (\"Ogniem i mieczem\"), \"The Deluge\" (\"Potop\") and \"Pan Michael\" (\"Pan Wolodyjowski\"), is collectively considered his towering national epics.
