        "text": "(1846–1916). The Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz won the Nobel prize for literature in 1905 for his popular epic novels. His most famous work is Quo Vadis?, a historical novel set in Rome under Nero.\n\nHenryk Adam Alexander Pius Sienkiewicz was born on May 5, 1846, in Wola Okrzejska, Poland. He studied literature, history, and philology at Warsaw University but left in 1871 without taking a degree. He had begun to publish critical articles in 1869 that showed the influence of positivism, a system of philosophy emphasizing in particular the achievements of science.\n\nSienkiewicz’s first novel, In Vain, appeared in 1872, and his first short story, “The Old Servant”, in 1875. In 1876–78 he traveled in the United States as special correspondent of the Gazeta polska (Polish Gazette). After his return to Poland, via Italy and France, he published a number of successful short stories, among them “Yanko the Musician” (1879), “The Lighthouse-Keeper of Aspinwall” (1882), and “Bartek the Conqueror” (1882). From 1882 to 1887 he was coeditor of the daily Słowo. During World War I he promoted the cause of Polish independence and organized relief for Polish war victims. He died on Nov. 15, 1916, in Vevey, Switzerland.\n\nSienkiewicz’s great trilogy of historical novels began to appear in Słowo in 1883. It is composed of With Fire and Sword (1884), The Deluge (1886), and Pan Michael (1887–88). Set in the late 17th century, the trilogy describes Poland’s struggles against Cossacks, Tatars, Swedes, and Turks, stressing Polish heroism in a vivid style of epic clarity and simplicity. The widely translated Quo Vadis? (1896) established Sienkiewicz’s international reputation. Although his novels have been criticized for their theatricality and lack of historical accuracy, they display great narrative power and contain vivid characterizations."
