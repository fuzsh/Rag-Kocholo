        "text": "Sometimes two seemingly unrelated matters are juxtaposed in a way that causes us to recall the significance of historical events in our community. For example, on Sept. 28, 2023 this newspaper published an article about the final meeting of the Niagara Polish Cultural and Historical Society. Then on the following Monday, news outlets began to report announcements about winners of this year’s Nobel Prizes. Together, these stories reminded me of when Niagara Falls served as the destination for the first visit to Western New York by a Nobel laureate of Polish descent.\n\nWhen Henryk Sienkiewicz won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905, he was already one of the world’s most popular and widely read authors. This popularity extended to America generally and into Western New York. In its edition for Jan. 1, 1899, The Buffalo Sunday Morning News observed that “few persons in the literary world of today are better known than Henry Sienkiewicz. . . . ‘Quo Vadis,’ his most popular book, gave the readers no end of pleasure, and hundreds of thousands of copies were sold in the United States and Great Britain.”\n\nSienkiewicz was born on May 5, 1846, in Siedice, Poland. After studying at the University of Warsaw, he began work as a journalist. At the time, Poland was a divided nation under military occupation by the armies of Russia, Prussia and Austria. In the winter of 1875, a small group of patriots met in Warsaw at the home of a talented actress who would perform under the name of Helena Modjeska. Concerned about restraints on liberty in Europe, the group decided to explore the establishment of a Polish settlement in California. Sienkiewicz agreed to visit America first for the purpose of scouting possible locations. To help finance his journey, Sienkiewicz arranged to write a series of articles about his experiences for publication in a Polish newspaper called Gazeta Polska.\n\nOn Feb. 19, 1876, Sienkiewicz sailed for New York. After a short stay in that city, he traveled west through Syracuse and Rochester to Niagara Falls, where he stopped to explore its famous cataract. In an article submitted to his publisher in Warsaw, Sienkiewicz wrote extensively about the waterfall. As translated by Charles Morley, this description includes the following:\n\n“Truly, the very recollection of this sight stuns my mind and causes my pen to fall from my hand. Lake Erie’s tremendous volume of water, flowing through a mighty throat into Lake Ontario, is suddenly deprived of its riverbed and falls in two places into the abyss. At first glance it seems that the earth will be unable to withstand the weight and impact of the wild, raging waters which themselves appear terror-stricken. . . . The roar of the water is deafening. The sharp wind stings your face with spray. Sometimes a mist suddenly bursts from the foot of the falls and hides everything from view. Then again it disappears and you see a mass of foam and the entire falls as clearly as an object in the palm of your hand.”\n\nSienkiewicz also described a walk on wooden steps that led to a spot under the falls itself. “Nothing is more beautiful than this inside view of the waterfall.”\n\nAlthough one of the most famous Poles to visit Niagara Falls, Sienkiewicz was certainly not the first. Before leaving, Sienkiewicz toured a museum dedicated to the history of the city’s natural wonder. In the article that he forwarded for publication in Warsaw, Sienkiewicz reported that the building’s walls were “covered with thousands of inscriptions in English, French, Italian, and other languages. I saw also Polish and Russian inscriptions, for everyone regards it as a duty to leave his signature here, as well as the date of his visit.”\n\nFrom Niagara Falls, Sienkiewicz crossed into Canada. His train proceeded to Hamilton, to Detroit, to Omaha and then to California, where he chose Anaheim as the site for a Polish colony. There, he was eventually joined by Helena Modjeska, her husband and a small group of Polish intellectuals. Their plans for a permanent settlement were unsuccessful, but in the process, Helena Modjeska perfected her mastery of English and Sienkiewicz continued his role as a correspondent for newspapers in Poland.\n\nOn Aug. 20, 1877, Madame Modjeska resumed her acting career in San Francisco. With favorable reviews, she quickly became a leading star of the American theater. Meanwhile, Sienkiewicz decided to return to Europe. Before leaving from New York at the end of March in 1878, however, Sienkiewicz traveled with Modjeska on her performing tour in major cities in the Eastern United States. The Buffalo Courier reported that the actress visited Buffalo on March 18, 1878. It is possible that Sienkiewicz may have stopped in New York State’s second largest city at that time.\n\nSienkiewicz died on Nov. 15, 1916. In a lengthy editorial, The Buffalo Express stated that the news of his passing “will bring genuine mourning to every Polish colony in America, which will be reflected by the literary world generally.” The newspaper observed that “it is an interesting fact that one of the greatest novelists of our time . . . should have reached world-wide fame by writing stories for small periodicals.” One such story was the description of his visit to Niagara Falls.\n\nI can speculate that Sienkiewicz may have stopped in Buffalo, but we know with certainty about his adventures in the adjoining county to the north. Other Nobel laureates from Poland have visited Western New York over the years. However, the first such visit inspired a young journalist to inform his readership in Poland about the majestic beauty of Niagara Falls. Sienkiewicz’s brief tour serves as an example of the type of historical event that has captured the interest of Polish cultural organizations for so many years."
