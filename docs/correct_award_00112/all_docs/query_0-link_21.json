        "text": "The past is never dead. It's not even past. -William Faulkner, 1951\n\nWhile Faulkner could sometimes be cryptic, this quote seems easy enough to grasp. After all, if the past were really past, why would we read so much historical fiction? Hardly the sole purview of trashy paperback enthusiasts and Civil War reenactors, historical fiction has held a distinguished place in literary history for centuries. It stretches back to the famed 16th Century poet Sir Walter Raleigh and continues through to contemporary authors like Hilary Mantel. Between these two, the legacy of historical fiction makes another notable stop with Nobel Prize-winning author Henryk Sienkiewicz.\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz was born in Poland in 1856 to a poor but well-bred family. While he was never an exceptional student, he excelled in Polish language and history, even undertaking an extensive study of the Old Polish language. Following a few thwarted attempts to go into more prestigious fields like law or medicine, Sienkiewicz began his career as a journalist, writing a series of travel essays for the Polish Gazette in exchange for travel expenses. It is, perhaps, by dint of having become so well traveled (his work took him to Brussels, Paris, Nevada, London and elsewhere) that he began to undertake his transition from short writings to long, historical novels. For if, as they say, the past is a foreign country, who but a world traveler might be best suited to tackling historical fiction? Whatever the reason, Sienkiewicz proved more than equal to the task, quickly becoming one of Polandâ€™s most popular authors.\n\nAfter a lengthy period of sustained commercial and critical success, Sienkiewicz eventually came to write and publish his most enduring work, Quo Vadis (1895). A story of star-crossed lovers set in the Roman Empire, Quo Vadis depicts the great pains Sienkiewicz went to in order to craft a historic portrait of Christian resistance under Roman emperor Nero. Though it endeavors to draw a parallel between the persecution of the early Christians and the plight of the Poles (Poland was conquered and re-conquered at an alarming rate during Sienkiewicz' lifetime), its most forceful thematic maneuver may be its rebuke of materialism. Ultimately, its portrayal of the triumph of the Christian, and by extension Polish, spirit, proved sufficient, not just to earn wide readership and critical acclaim, but to attract the attention of a then-just forming Nobel committee. In fact, so obvious did Quo Vadis make Sienkiewicz's Nobel-victory, that the committee's only words of explanation were: \"because of his outstanding merits as an epic writer.\""
