        "text": "Warsaw, Poland – If Poland boasts its fair share of Nobel Prize in Literature winners, one of them, for his literary, historical and national aura, stands out: the first Polish writer to receive, in 1905, the coveted award, and one of the most renowned Central European authors in history, Henryk Sienkiewicz.\n\nA trip to Sienkiewicz’s childhood home in eastern Poland\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz was born in Wola Okrzejska, eastern Poland. The main attraction of this small village, today, is his childhood house, where a Henryk Sienkiewicz museum has been set up. For a museum dedicated to one of the most prominent writers of the Polish language, this is a rather unusual one, with very few belongings of Sienkiewicz displayed.\n\nThe exhibition is rather diverse and surprising: you can try on Sienkiewicz’ travel cloak, weigh his suitcase or put on costumes inspired by his main novels. You may also find multiple translations of his books, from The Deluge to Quo Vadis, and read them by yourself. All of this in a traditional Polish house with its flowered garden.\n\nThis place strangely mirrors the character of the man himself, and plays like an odd reminder of who he was. If Sienkiewicz has been awarded the Nobel Prize in the early 20th century, it’s probably as much for his literary style as for his popularity – in the two meanings of “popular”: he was a hugely successful writer and a man close to the people.\n\nThe closeness he had with and affinity he felt towards his Polish compatriots strongly impregnated and influenced his literary work. Every single one of his books and novels have been inspired by his fervent love for his country – a country, let us not forget, that wasn’t even on the map of Europe when he wrote them.\n\nTrilogy and Quo Vadis\n\nSienkiewicz’s most famous works include his Trilogy and the stand-alone Quo Vadis. Both of them share this same vision of Poland, and if this feature is more noticeable in the Trilogy, three volumes set in 17th century Poland, the topic of the Polish nation and its people’s suffering are keenly expressed, though in a more metaphorical way, in Quo Vadis.\n\nQuo Vadis tells the story of Marcus Vinicius and his lover, the barbarian hostage Lygia, in the greatest context of the persecution of Christians under Nero. The plot revolves around Lygia being herself a Christian. But what’s the link between 19th century Poland, when Sienkiewicz wrote the novel, and the reign of Nero? If these two periods appear not to have any connection for the modern reader at first sight, Sienkiewicz shaped and constructed Quo Vadis as a reflection of the times he lived in.\n\nSince the three partitions at the end of the 18th century, Poland did not exist as a country. When Sienkiewicz wrote his novel, the country was still divided between Prussia, Austria-Hungary and Russia – the author’s native city, Wola Okrzejska, being located in the Russian-controlled territory.\n\nPoland’s Nobel Prize in Literature laureates in history\n\nA nation without a country\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz translated the pain of living in a country that wasn’t really his own, as well as the oppression Poles endured, into the story of Vinicius and Lygia. Who is Lygia, if not Poland, and the Polish people as a whole?\n\nPersecuted for her Christian faith, she suffers as Poles did under a foreign rule. Furthermore, although her true name is Calina, she’s called Lygia throughout the entire novel.\n\nAnd this name is strongly symbolic: it comes from the name of her tribe, Lygian – a tribe that lived on a territory that matches modern-day Silesia, Mazovia, Little and Greater Poland.\n\nGreater Poland is tellingly the voivodeship where Gniezno, the first capital of Poland, was located. Quintessentially, the Lygian lived in what can be viewed as the crib of the Polish nation, and Lygia embodies and echoes this invisible but highly allusive legacy.\n\nFictional characters heralded as national heroes\n\nSienkiewicz’ work provides some catharsis for Polish people. Even more so than Quo Vadis, the Trilogy looks thoroughly at the destiny of the Polish nation. Composed of three books – With Fire and Sword, The Deluge and Fire in the Steppe – the story is set during the 17th century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe first volume, With Fire and Sword, examines more precisely the period of the Khmelnitsky Uprising, a revolt of Ukrainian Cossacks against the authority of the Commonwealth. The second, The Deluge, takes place during the so-nicknamed invasion of Sweden. The last one, Fire in the Steppe, looks at the struggle between Ottomans and Poland.\n\nThe Trilogy gave birth to characters who became iconic in Polish culture, like Jan Skrzetuski, the main character of the first novel, Helena Kurcewiczówna, Zagłoba, Michał Wołodyjowski, Andrzej Kmicic, Aleksandra Billewiczówna, Podbipięta, and many others.\n\nTo such an extent that, for example, seeing Podbipięta as a true national hero, the inhabitants of Zbaraj, the city in which he is supposed to have been born, opposed the restoration of their local church, fearing Podbipięta’s grave might be damaged.\n\nA land without a country: Literary myths of rural Poland\n\nA beacon of hope in Poland’s darkest hours\n\nAt a time where Polish identity was denied and persecuted, Sienkiewicz’ novel represented a beacon of hope for many Poles. Throughout the 19th century, the three countries that had partitioned Poland tried to break the Polish national pride and spirit. In the part annexed by Prussia, the Kulturkampf took place to annihilate all traces and remnants of Polish culture.\n\nIn the Russian-held territory, Poles (unsuccessfully) stood up to their occupier a number of times, including during the 1830 November Uprising. Polish intelligentsia emigrated en masse, including to France, like Adam Mickiewicz. Cyprian Kamil Norwid wrote the poem “Fortepian Szopena” – a testament to the Polish nation’s yearning for freedom and symbol of the relentless repression.\n\nIn a striking imagery, Norwid describes how Russian troops threw Chopin’s piano out the window, destroying by a single throw iconic symbols of Polish culture and the very concept of nation more than any slaughter or physical repression would have. This is precisely what Henryk Sienkiewicz opposed in his novels.\n\nHe wanted, as he wrote in the last sentence of the Trilogy, his longing compatriots to keep alive the hope of an independent and strong Poland. As he said in the speech he gave in Stockholm upon receiving the Nobel Prize: “This homage has been rendered not to me – for the Polish soil is fertile and does not lack better writers than me – but to the Polish achievement, the Polish genius”.\n\nUpholding Sienkiewicz’s legacy: to what end?\n\nTrue to Sienkiewicz’s legacy, modern Poland has kept and upheld this longing for freedom, through its culture, novels and works of art. Sienkiewicz, along with other prominent Polish artists like Mickiewicz and his Pan Tadeusz, created the imagery and crafted the modern mythology of their country.\n\nA good part of Poland’s most classic and powerful novels was written when Poland was divided, ruled by foreign countries and technically didn’t exist as such.\n\nTheir yearning for independence, strength and freedom survived centuries of hardship and remains alive to this day. But let’s not forget one crucial fact: times have changed.\n\nTheir often-bellicose tone may not be needed anymore, nor should it be necessary to praise this kind of rhetoric which could, in today’s context, easily become superfluous and dangerous. It’s a call to arms at a time when Poland may not necessarily need one anymore.\n\nBy Louise Ostermann Twardowski"
