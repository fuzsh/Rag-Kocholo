        "text": "Author Henryk Sienkiewicz\n\ntranslated by H. E. Kennedy, Z. Uminska, Monica M. Gardner, S.C. DE Soissons, J. Curtin, E. Blackett\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz ( 5 May 1846 – 15 November 1916) was a Polish author, novelist and the Nobel Prize laureate. He is best remembered for his historical novels, especially for his internationally known best-seller Quo Vadis (1896).\n\nBorn into an impoverished Polish noble family in Russian-ruled Congress Poland, in the late 1860s he began publishing journalistic and literary pieces. In the late 1870s he traveled to the United States, sending back travel essays that won him popularity with Polish readers. In the 1880s he began serializing novels that further increased his popularity. He soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and numerous translations gained him international renown, culminating in his receipt of the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature for his “outstanding merits as an epic writer.”\n\nMany of his novels remain in print. In Poland he is best known for his “Trilogy” of historical novels – With Fire and Sword, The Deluge, and Fire in the Steppe – set in the 17th-century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth; internationally he is best known for Quo Vadis, set in Nero’s Rome. The Trilogy and Quo Vadis have been filmed, the latter several times, with Hollywood’s 1951 version receiving the most international recognition."
