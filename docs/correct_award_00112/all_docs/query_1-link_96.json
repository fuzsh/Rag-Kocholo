        "text": "by Paweł Wernicki\n\nPart 2\n\nThe Nobel Prize\n\nOn Nov. 7, 1911, Maria Skłodowska-Curie received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of polonium and radium, isolation of pure radium and research on the chemical properties of radioactive elements. It was the first time the Nobel Prize was awarded to the same person for a second time, and in a different field of knowledge. To this day, no other woman has achieved this. Only a handful of people have received the Nobel Prize more than once, only two of them in different disciplines - the other was Linus Pauling, in chemistry and a peace prize. John Bardeen had two Nobel Prizes in physics, Frederick Sanger and Karl Barry Sharpless – two each in chemistry.\n\nThe two-time Nobel Prize winner managed to convince the French government to allocate funds for the construction of the Radium Institute (now Institut Curie). It was established in 1914 to conduct basic research in chemistry, physics and medicine regarding radioactivity and radioisotopes, including cancer treatment. This work resulted in four further Nobel Prizes – including those for Maria Skłodowska-Curie's daughter, Irène, and son-in-law, Frederic Joliot-Curie.\n\nWhen World War I broke out in 1914, Maria Skłodowska-Curie evacuated the Radium Institute's stockpiles of radium from Paris to Bordeaux and decided to contribute to the war effort by organizing special cars with diagnostic X-ray equipment, known as 'little Curies'. To be able to drive such cars, she was one of the first women to obtain a truck driving license in July 1916. In addition to military doctors, Irene's older daughter was also involved in the project and helped train radiology technicians. Correct diagnoses made possible thanks to X-rays saved the lives and health of many soldiers. In addition, Maria Skłodowska-Curie was a member of the Swiss General Committee for Aid to Victims of War in Poland (the president of this organization was Henryk Sienkiewicz, and the vice-president - Ignacy Paderewski).\n\nThanks to the American journalist Maria Meloney, in 1921 Maria and her daughters travelled to the USA. There, thanks to the collection of money from the Polish community and local millionaires, she was able to buy 1 gram of radium for the Radium Institute and equip the laboratory. She met with U.S. President Warren Harding. The second U.S. trip took place in 1929 - another gram of radium for the Radium Institute in Warsaw (now the Institute of Oncology) thanks to the collection. This time it was presented by President Herbert Hoover. The ceremonial opening of the Institute with the participation of the Nobel Prize winner and her sister Bronisława took place in May 1932.\n\nLong-term work with radioactive materials took a toll on Maria's health. She was losing her sight and hearing. She died on July 4, 1934 in Passy, France at the age of 67 due to bone marrow aplasia. She was the first woman buried in the French Pantheon (the bodies of Maria and her husband Peter were moved there on April 20, 1995 from the cemetery in Sceaux). Her remains, sealed in a lead-protected coffin, are still radioactive, as are her research notes stored in lead containers in the National Library of Paris.\n\nHer private life\n\nMaria Skłodowska-Curie's private life was also interesting. While still in Poland, when she worked as a governess for the Żorawski family (while also teaching rural children to read, write and arithmetic), she became engaged to Kazimierz Żorawski, a mathematics student. However, due to the parents' disagreement, the marriage did not take place. It was only in France that she met a suitable candidate for a husband – Pierre Curie.\n\nShe gave birth to her first daughter, Irene, on Sept. 12, 1897 (Irene Curie was the second woman to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry). The second daughter, born in August 1903, died shortly after birth. On Dec. 6, 1904, the third daughter, Eve, was born, a future pianist, peace activist, journalist and author of the biography Madame Curie (published in Poland as 'Maria Curie').\n\nOn April 19, 1906, Pierre Curie, then 47, died after being hit by a horse-drawn cart. Although in mourning, Maria took over her husband's chair of physics in May 1906, becoming the first woman professor in the history of the Sorbonne in Paris.\n\nShe worked intensively. She obtained radium in the metallic state, improved methods for isolating new substances, and provided the definition of the international radium standard. She attended the famous Solvay Conference in Brussels in 1911, where she became friends with Albert Einstein. \"\"Considering that Einstein is still very young, it is reasonable to put great hopes in him and see him as one of the leading theoreticians of the future,\"\" Maria wrote, recommending him for the position of professor at the ETH Zurich.\n\nShe had very strong views on the education of children: \"\"It is barbaric to condemn these very young beings to spend many hours in poorly equipped classrooms\"\"; \"\"it is a crime to deprive them of air and exercise right now, at the age when they need it most\"\"; \"\"sometimes it seems to me that the work of children in today's schools is so excessive that it is better to drown the children than to teach in these schools.\"\"\n\nTherefore, together with her friends, she founded the 'Cooperative', where 10 children (including Irene) had daily home lessons with outstanding specialists. Students also often visited museums and theatres. After two years, however, the 'Cooperative' had to be dissolved - preparation for state exams required knowledge of textbooks. However, several of the class participants successfully pursued science, especially Irene.\n\nBeing a Nobel Prize winner, a three-time winner of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, having honorary doctorates from many universities - including Edinburgh, Geneva, Manchester, being a member of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, Bologna, Prague and the Academy of Sciences in Kraków, in 1911 Maria Skłodowska Curie submitted her candidacy for the French Academy of Sciences. However, she was rejected – as a woman and a foreigner. It was only in 1962 that Marguerite Perey, Maria's doctoral student, was admitted to the Academy.\n\nShortly afterwards, the Nobel laureate's year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, who had left his wife and children for her, was revealed. Tabloids attacked her for immorality, impiety and considered her a Jew (her middle name Salomea was associated with Jewish origins in France). As she wrote: \"\"We expose ourselves to many disappointments if we make all our life interests dependent on turbulent feelings, such as love.…\"\"\n\nWhat could she say today? Probably the same as before. \"\"Science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering.\"\" \"\"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood.\"\"\n\n\"\"You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end, each of us must work for his own improvement and, at the same time, share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful.\"\" (PAP)"
