Against the backdrop of historical events that forever changed the face of Western civilization, Sienkiewicz tells the tragic love story of a Roman aristocrat for a Christian persecuted by the authorities.\n\nFor the first time in Russia, the novel Kamo Gryadeshi comes out with drawings by the remarkable Czech artist Ventseslav Cerny.\n\nTranslation: Evgenia Lysenko\n\nPages: 608 (offset). Hard cover\n\nDimensions: 140x210 mm\n\nSeries: Foreign Literature. big books"
