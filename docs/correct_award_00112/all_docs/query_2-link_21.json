Sienkiewicz became a journalist and author during the 1860s, and he travelled to the United States during the 1870s and wrote popular travel essays. During the 1880s, he wrote several historical fiction novels (set during the Khmelnytsky Uprising and The Deluge) that further increased his popularity, and he published his best-selling Christian novel Quo Vadis in 1896; for this and other novels, he was awarded the 1905 Nobel Prize for Literature."
