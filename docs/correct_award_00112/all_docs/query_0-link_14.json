        "text": "Anaheim, Calif.\n\nDedicated June 29, 2008\n\nThe Mother Colony House is the oldest frame building in Anaheim. It was here that Henryk Sienkiewicz resided with Madame Helena Modejeska in 1876. He is one of the most popular Polish writers and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1905 for his outstanding merits as an epic writer. He is best known as the author of Quo Vadis. While in Anaheim he wrote Lity z podrozy (“Letters form a Journey”) and was inspired to write two short stories about Orange County: “A Comedy of Errors” and “Orso: An American Hercules” (set in Anaheim).\n\nResources:\n\nMother Colony House (website)"
