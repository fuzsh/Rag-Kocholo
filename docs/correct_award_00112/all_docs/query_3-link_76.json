        "text": "BOOK CLUB RETROSPECTIVE #2\n\nJanuary 7, 2015\n\nIt’s time to look back at last year’s book selections and get your feedback as to which ones you liked best, why, and suggestions as to upcoming twelve 2015 book selections. In essence, this is your opportunity to give the professor a grade for the 2014 book selections.\n\nAs I look back, judging by your responses, the #1 book selection of the year has to be the October entry: Ralph Moody’s Little Britches. A number of you were introduced to the Moody family read-aloud series ago, and welcomed the opportunity to revisit. Do let me know which other selections you especially enjoyed.\n\nAnd for all of you who may be interested in climbing aboard for this year’s selections, permit me to bring you up to date. Dr. Joe’s Book of the Month Series was born On Oct. 19, 2010, as a result of former students urging me to come back into their lives in a special way: “Dr. Wheeler, years ago, I was in your classes, and you introduced us to books you’ve loved personally—and got me to do the same. I miss those sessions with you! Please, please, do it again. There are millions of books out there, which makes it ever so difficult for me to choose the ones that are really worth reading—especially for people like me who, like you, strongly believe in God and country, and values worth living by.” [a synthesis of responses].\n\nBut now, since I couldn’t give anyone a grade and wasn’t ordering books, I have had little control over who bothered to buy the books and read them and who did not. A year ago, a bit discouraged because I didn’t hear back from “members” very often, I asked for feedback. So positive were your responses, and so many told me you were finding copies, reading them, and adding them to your personal libraries, that I decided to keep the series going. A number of you have gone further and told me how meaningful many of the selections have been to you personally.\n\nSuch responses really help, for it is time-consuming to keep searching for new books worth including, older books that are worth considering, and books I’ve loved but must re-read before I grant them my personal blessing by choosing them.\n\nUndoubtedly, the world-wide-web has made it easy for any of us to track down copies of even some of the scarcer titles.\n\nIt has evolved into a most eclectic mix of genres: non-fiction, contemporary, books children and teens have loved for generations, timeless classics, romantic fiction, westerns, Christmas classics, and so on. It is my hope and prayer that, if you keep my feet to the fire long enough, we’ll end up with a family library that generations yet to come will cherish.\n\nTo make it easier for current members to respond, and for non-members to join us, I am including a list of all the book-selections so far with dates the blogs appeared, to make it easier for new members to begin catching up on books they’d like to add to their libraries. Here they are:\n\nOUR FIRST 36 BOOKS\n\nBergreen, Lawrence, Over the Edge of the World (May 28, 2014)\n\nBrown, Abbie Farwell, The Christmas Angel (Nov. 23, 2011)\n\nBurnett, Frances Hodgson, Little Lord Fauntleroy (Feb. 29, 2012)\n\nConan Doyle, Arthur, The White Company (April 30, 2014)\n\nDana, Richard Henry, Two Years Before the Mast (March 26, 2014)\n\nDickens, Charles, The Christmas Carol (Nov. 23, 2011)\n\nDouglas, Lloyd C., Home for Christmas (Nov. 28, 2012)\n\nDuncan, Dayton, and Ken Burns, (The National Parks: America’s Best Idea (June 27, 2012)\n\nGoudge, Elizabeth, City of Bells (Sept. 26, 2012)\n\nGrey, Zane (1) Heritage of the Desert (Dec. 28, 2011)\n\n(2) Riders of the Purple Sage (June 5, 2013)\n\n(3) The Vanishing American (June 30, 2014)\n\n(4) Wanderer of the Wasteland (March 28, 2012)\n\nHale, Edward Everett, Sr., The Man Without a Country (Feb. 6, 2013)\n\nHill, Grace Livingston, Happiness Hill (Aug. 21, 2013)\n\nHugo, Victor, Les Miserables (Sept. 25, 2013)\n\nHuxley, Aldous, Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited (May 8, 2013)\n\nKnight, Eric, Lassie Come Home (Nov. 6, 2013)\n\nLorenzini, Carlos, Pinocchio (Sept. 24, 2014)\n\nLowry, Lois, The Giver (Aug. 27, 2014)\n\nMoody, Ralph, Little Britches (Oct. 29, 2014)\n\nPorter, Gene Stratton, Freckles (July 17, 2013)\n\nReed, Myrtle, The Master’s Violin (April 3, 2013)\n\nRichmond, Grace, (1) Foursquare (Jan. 2, 2013)\n\n(2) The Twenty-Fourth of June (May 23, 2012)\n\nSabatini, Ralph, Scaramouche (Feb. 26, 2014)\n\nSheldon, Charles, In His Steps (Aug. 22, 2012) (Nov. 26, 2014)\n\nSienkiewicz, Henryk, Quo Vadis (Jan. 28, 2014)\n\nSpyri, Johanna, Heidi (July 30, 2014)\n\nTarkington, Booth, Penrod (Oct. 31, 2012)\n\nTennyson, Alfred, Lord, Enoch Arden (May 2, 2012)\n\nThoreau, Henry David, Walden (Jan. 25, 2012)\n\nVan Dyke, Henry, The Other Wise Man (Dec. 4, 2013)\n\nWiggin, Kate Douglas, The Birds’ Christmas Carol (Nov. 26, 2014)\n\nWilliamson, C.

JOE\n\nDR. JOE’S BOOK OF THE MONTH CLUB #26\n\nHENRYK SIENKIEWICZ’S QUO VADIS\n\nJanuary 29, 2014\n\nSome time ago, our daughter Michelle suggested we pose one question to our Book Club members each month. By responding (on Facebook), they could thereby get book discussions in motion that we have lacked up to now. With this in mind, here is Question #1: Generally speaking, or specifically, of what value are our book selections so far? In other words, how do they enrich your life? Change it?\n\n* * *\n\nOne of the requests from those who love books that came in during the last month was this one: Feature more of those classic books you edited for Focus on the Family and Tyndale House. Altogether, there were twelve. Four have already been Book Club selections: Charles Dickens’ The Christmas Carol (Nov. 23, 2011); Abbie Farwell Brown’s The Christmas Angel (Nov. 23, 2011); Grace Richmond’s The Twenty-Fourth of June (May 23, 2012); and Gene Stratton Porter’s Freckles (July 17, 2013). Some of you may wish to go back in time and retrieve those four if you haven’t done so already. The other eight are: Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women and Little Men; Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe and The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe; Charles Dickens’ David Copperfield; Lucy Maud Montgomery’s Anne of Green Gables; Lew Wallace’s Ben-Hur; and this month’s selection: Quo Vadis.\n\nWheeler edition (2000) 663 pages\n\nPocket Book movie abridged version (1952) 181 oages\n\nI would welcome your e-mailing or writing me with your suggestions: which of these would you like me to feature in this year’s Book of the Month selections?\n\nFor each of the twelve books, I wrote an introduction to the book, a modest biography of the author (averaging about 40 – 60 pages); and discussion questions for teachers, parents, homeschoolers, individuals of all ages, at the back. And I did my best to feature the earliest illustrations used for that book, a list of that author’s writings, and movie history. Needless to say, all this was extremely time-consuming (some books taking a year to complete). Also each book was unabridged. It might surprise you to learn that a good share of the classic books sold today are abridged, but don’t so indicate! I consider that a betrayal!\n\nSo, with that preamble, let’s move on to 2014’s first Book of the Month.\n\nStreet and Smith paperback. (1900) 246 pages – abridged\n\nHippocrene trade paper (1992) – 494 pages, Stanley F. Conrad translation\n\nMy own introduction begins with these words:\n\nMost books that we read barely register in our memory bank–they are there, but only dimly. Rarely does a book dig in its heels and demand that it be taken seriously and that it not be forgotten after you finish it and put it down. Quo Vadis is that kind of book.\n\nI first read it many years ago when I was young, and loved it for its excitement and panoramic windows into that long-ago world of the Praetorian Guard; the pomp and opulence of the Roman imperial court; the ludicrous yet malevolent Nero; the fascinating arbiter of elegance, Petronius; the opportunistic and amoral Chilo; the vindictive Tigellilnus; the slave girl with a secret love, Eunice; the forgiving physician, Glaucus; the Christian mother-mentor, Pomponia; the evil virago of an empress, Poppaea; the faithful courtesan, Acte; the apostle of love, Paul; the quo vadis apostle, Peter; the disillusioned old general, Aulus; the faithful Hercules, Ursus; the ruthless young tribune, Vinitius, and the great love of his life, the beautiful princess, Lygia–this incredibly real cast of characters comes to life as you read, and it never leaves you. In addition there is the kaleidoscopic imagery of racing chariots; decadent imperial banquets; the burning of Rome; torchlight processions into old graveyards; candlelit glimpses into foul, plague-ridden prison cells; Christians burning as living torches in Caesar’s gardens, crucified on crosses like their Master, beheaded like Paul, speared by gladiators, pulled apart by horses, gored by bulls and bisons, or savagely attacked by wild dogs, lions, panthers, tigers, and bears. It’s almost mind-boggling that Sienkiewicz managed to cram all this between two covers!\n\nIt is not a book for small children, for it is powerful fare filled with violence. But for the rest of us, it serves as a reality check. Our society has so sanitized events like the bloody lashing of Christ. His falling to the ground under the weight of the cross, His humiliating stripping and public nakedness; the agony resulting from having a crown of thorns driven into His scalp, the nailing of His hands and feet to the cross, the ripping of His muscles as the cross is dropped into the hole, the public taunting, the terrible thirst, the brokenhearted death–yes, we have so sanitized all this that we completely miss the agonizing reality of Christ’s sacrifice for mankind.\n\nThe same is true of the terrible period of Christian persecution unleashed by Nero, which we quaintly reduce to “the Christians and the lions.” Only as we read a realistic book like Quo Vadis can we genuinely conceptualize what it was like to be a Christian during those days when death was the probable price you would pay for your convictions. It is a sobering book. It is also about as historically accurate as Sienkiewicz could make it (exceptions noted in the Discussion Questions).\n\nSo powerful was this 1896 book that in 1900, Sienkiewicz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Today, he is considered to be Poland’s greatest author.\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz (1846-1916) was born near Lukow in what was then Russian-occupied Poland. Few nations have had a more tragic history than Poland, plagued by having no natural borders. After studying philosophy at Warsaw University, he began his illustrious literary career. He dedicated his life to the celebration of the history of the Polish people. Greatest of these fictional novels was his trilogy: With Fire and Sword (1890, 1892, 1895), The Deluge (1891), and Pan Michael (1893). As for Quo Vadis? it has been translated into over 40 languages, and, according to Stanley F. Conrad, is “the greatest best-selling novel in the history of literature.”\n\nAccording to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “The message of Quo Vadis? is universal. Contrasting as it does the early Christian message of love and reconciliation with the debauchery of a corrupt Roman empire that caused its own demise, it speaks to the present as it once did to the tumultuous years that opened the 20th century.”\n\nThe title comes from a famous moment in the Apostle Peter’s life, when, as he was fleeing Rome and the wrath of Nero, God stopped him (at a still-pointed-out location in the then outskirts of Rome) with this question, “Quo Vadis?” [“Where are you going?”] After communing with his Lord, Peter returned to Rome, knowing that by so doing, he would die there a martyr to his faith."
