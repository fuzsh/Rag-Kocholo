        "text": "Since 1901, the Nobel Prize has recognized outstanding scientists, writers and humanitarians. The 2020 awards in five categories were announced last week. While reviewing the accomplishments of this year’s recipients, my thoughts turned also to Marie Skladowska Curie and Henryk Sienkiewicz, the first two Poles to become Nobel laureates.\n\nSkladowska Curie was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1867. A brilliant student in science and mathematics, she pursued advanced studies in Paris, where she met Pierre Curie, her husband and collaborator in the research of radioactive substances.\n\nTogether, Pierre and Marie Curie shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with another French scientist, Antoine Henri Bacquerel. In the process, Madame Curie became the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize.\n\nAfter Pierre died from an automobile accident in 1906, his wife continued research that would earn her a Nobel Prize in the field of chemistry in 1911. In her work, Madame Curie expressed a love for Poland by assigning the name “Polonium” to the 84th element on the Periodic Table.\n\nOne hundred fifteen years ago, in 1905, the Swedish Academy awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature to Henryk Sienkiewicz. Perhaps best known as the author of the novel “Quo Vadis?”, Sienkiewicz also used events in Polish history as the basis of several works of historical fiction.\n\nAt the time of the award, Poland was an occupied nation longing to regain its independence. In bestowing the Nobel Prize, the Swedish Academy aimed both to honor its recipient and to recognize the aspirations of the Polish people. The Academy’s Permanent Secretary, C. D. Af Wirsen, identified these interrelated themes in his presentation address:\n\n“But in every nation there are some rare geniuses who concentrate in themselves the spirit of the nation; they represent the national character to the world. Although they cherish the memories of the past of that people, they do so only to strengthen its hope for the future.”\n\nBy referring to Poland as a “nation,” Wirsen captured the message that Sienkiewicz himself had wanted to express. In an interview with the Associated Press on the day of the award presentation, Sienkiewicz confirmed this thought:\n\n“Naturally I feel extremely gratified at the honor that Sweden has conferred in recognizing me as worthy of the Nobel Prize. I am gratified all the more because the honor is a recognition of Polish literature and thereby disproves the assertion that we are a nation belonging to the past. This Nobel Prize, which I do not take as a personal tribute, shows us to be among the foremost nations in the world of thought.”\n\nThe paths of Madame Curie and Henryk Sienkiewicz crossed in May of 1912. At that time, Sienkiewicz headed a delegation of Polish professors who met with Curie to propose that she move her laboratory to Warsaw. In response, Curie did return briefly to Warsaw in 1913.\n\nAlthough her presentations related mostly to science, she also acknowledged the difficult circumstances that still prevailed in Poland. In a letter to a colleague, she wrote: “This poor country, massacred by an absurd and barbarous domination, really does a great deal to defend its moral and intellectual life.” Unfortunately, hopes for academic involvement in Warsaw were disrupted by the start of the First World War in 1914.\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz died in 1916 in Switzerland, where he was working to organize a program for war relief. Madame Curie returned to France, where she assisted the Allied cause as director of the Red Cross Radiology Service.\n\nAfter the war, Madame Curie continued her scientific research until her death in 1934. Although she remained in France, Curie nonetheless rejoiced in the independence of Poland.\n\nIn a letter written in December 1920, she quoted Adam Mickiewicz, the great patriotic poet: “So now we, ‘born in servitude and chained since birth,’ have seen that resurrection of our country which has been our dream. . . . Like you, I have faith in the future.”\n\nBoth Sienkiewicz and Curie maintained a connection to the Polish community of Western New York. In a book published in 1923 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of St. Stanislaus Parish in Buffalo, the historian Mieczyslaw Haiman writes that Sienkiewicz had corresponded with the editors of Polak w Ameryce, a daily newspaper affiliated with that parish.\n\nMadame Curie visited Buffalo in 1921, as part of a tour of the United States. She was accompanied by her daughter Irene, who herself would win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935. Plans had been made for a public dinner in honor of Marie Skladowska Curie. After a tour of Niagara Falls, however, she became ill and was forced to spend most of her time recuperating at the home of Dr. Harvey Gaylord in Eggertsville.\n\nNonetheless, the Nobel Laureate appreciated the graciousness of the community. In its edition for June 25, 1921, The New York Times quoted Curie: “In Buffalo I was not well enough to enjoy all that charming city had to offer. I was deeply touched by their consideration of my comfort and I hope some day to be able to visit Buffalo again.”\n\nMarie Skladowska Curie and Henryk Sienkiewicz became Nobel laureates before any American had received that honor. Throughout their professional lives, both demonstrated an ongoing concern for the welfare of their homeland and its people. By reason of this empathy, they showed that scientific and literary achievement are fully consistent with the advancement of principled beliefs."
