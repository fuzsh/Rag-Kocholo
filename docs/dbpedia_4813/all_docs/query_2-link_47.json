        "text": "Bittersweet update: You may have heard about the recent layoffs at Mozilla. I was impacted by this, along with some other amazing, talented peers. I am so proud and thankful for the past 5 years at Mozilla, both for the larger mission of the org and the people I worked with. However, Iâ€™m beyond excited to explore new opportunities and bring all my experience in front-end/UI engineering, user experience, product development, and mentoring chops to a new team. Please send me any and all opportunities you have or share my info with any team/company where I might be a great fit. Iâ€™m so thankful for my community at times like these.\n\nSilicon Valley is a ghost town! ðŸ‘» After I read it I thought to myself that the Bay area is dead. Yet, the opposite was true and it proves the story that being crazy pays off. During my recent stay in Silicon Valley, I had the opportunity to visit Google, Twitch, Microsoft, Asana and other outstanding companies. However, I only came to an understanding of the magic that the entrepreneurial culture holds while listening to Bart Decrem. As he was speaking about his previous projects, such as creating the game Temple Run, I found myself having goosebumps from the amount of passion that the speech held. Do you know what was the best part? He did not give a damn, he broke all the rules of public speaking and conventions, and at some point, he even seemed crazy (in a good way :)). I never felt so inspired to take action. Lesson learnt: I told myself that I would never try to change who I am in order to fit in, as my personality and actions, in places not conventional, make me who I am. Maybe one day, thanks to this lesson, I will inspire and energize others to take action ðŸš€ Do you know about other exceptional environments that foster one to flourish?
