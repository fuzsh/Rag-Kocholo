        "text": "“An iPod, a Phone, and an Internet communicator.” — Steve Jobs\n\nToday marks the 9th anniversary of the release of the original iPhone. Every year, I re-watch what is arguably on of the best keynote talks of all time that happened 6 months prior. I get a bit reflective and introspective on the anniversary of the iPhone. This might sound strange to some people, but I think the reason I do is because it changed the course of my career in so many levels.\n\nA little context of what the landscape was like in the mobile space…at the time I was contemplating between buying an iPhone or Samsung Blackjack.\n\nLittle did many of us know that the launch of a device would change the career path for so many of us. When the first iPhone launched in 2007, I was an art school graduate working random jobs as I was applying for graduate schools to pursue my MFA in Painting. I was doing random production design jobs and web design.\n\nOn July 10, 2008, Apple then opened the App Store; a new distribution channel for people to build apps and share them with the world. The concept wasn’t revolutionary, but it gave the opportunity for some of us to start fresh. I started at a time when nobody really knew how to design for the iPhone or understood the limitations and possibility of it.\n\nWavepiloting these uncharted waters gave many of us to be foolish, play around, and see what works. From the fart apps, to the “I’m Rich” app, to many of the early Tapulous applications…the App Store was a new place to play and share our work.\n\nAt the time, I was working at ExactTarget (later acquired by Salesforce) and felt the itch. Though I liked my job and the people I worked with, I felt intruiged about the space of mobile design. When I was done with work I would make time to explore iPhone concepts, simply for the joy of it. Below is a concept I created of the Nikestore (one of our clients at the time) to play around with the possibilities. I believe this is the first mobile design I ever did.\n\nPlaying and exploring got addictive. I ended up leaving ExactTarget February of 2011 to start a company with my friend Adam. We were traveling Europe and working on a variety of projects, spanning from Rails apps, Android, and some iOS.\n\nOn October 5, 2011, the pioneer for the iPhone, Steve Jobs, passed away after battling pancreatic cancer. I recall sitting at the Uptown Espresso in Seattle’s Belltown neighborhood. My friend Melissa was the one who told me at the news. I called Adam, still a bit emotional about the news.\n\nLet’s Go All in With iPhone\n\nJust build iPhone apps. It’s what we wanted to do. I wanted to design for mobile and Adam loved (and still loves) Objective-C. Let’s do something to honor Steve by shipping our first app.\n\nThe first app we worked on shipping was Paper’d, an app that Jamie and Nicole had the idea for. This was the first time something we ever did was in the app store. It was so exciting, and it became addicting.\n\nShipping became an expectation. We continued to work on many client apps at Xhatch (the company Adam and I co-founded) and took on another project, RentalGuard. This was the first app we did as a full client services project, and we hired two of Adam’s former co-workers, Jake and Jason, who are now my close friends.\n\nToday and Beyond\n\nI don’t know where my career (or life) would be if it was not for the launch of the iPhone. I often wonder if I would be paying off student loans for my MFA and unsure of what I would be doing as a career.\n\nOver 20 apps shipped, three of which were featured by Apple, and one accepted to the 2012 Launch Festival. That’s mind-blowing to think about. Sometimes I forget what we’ve been able to do because we’re so focused on the future, but there are days where looking back is worth celebration.\n\nMore important than that is the community I found throughout this; the Seattle Xcoders community in particular. It was the tribe I was looking for and continue to be a part of today.\n\nToday I find myself doing similar things. I don’t work just on iOS anymore (though it’s still my one true love) and there is now Apple TV and Apple Watch to design for. I had the opportunity to work with a friend and mentor (one of Apple’s original iPhone developers) this past summer who transformed and re-energized my approach to playing around and going deep in exploration on ideas. It reminded me of the early days of iPhone design and I take that with me at One Medical, where Matilda and I are designing together again.\n\nFor those who worked on it and made it possible, I thank you for the iPhone, and keeping me hungry and foolish."
