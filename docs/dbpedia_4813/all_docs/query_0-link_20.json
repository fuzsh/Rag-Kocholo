The Palo Alto-based startup, which raised under $2 million in angel funding, started six months ago and launched on July 11th on the Apple Store, has soared beyond 1.3 million installs in less than a month. Now that's impressive. Bart, who stopped by the Vator studio for an in-depth interview with me, also said that due to the popularity of Tap Tap Revenge - which has 1 million installs alone - Tapulous is set to breakeven by the end of the year.\n\nSo popular are the apps that Tapulous plans on rolling out advertising on its games as early as this week. It is advertising that Bart expects to drive the company to cover its monthly expenses of about $100,000 for its eight-person team.\n\nThese are just small tidbits of breaking news that Bart shared with me."
