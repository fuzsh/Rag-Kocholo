        "text": "Today is a great day. We are joining Zynga and, in a way, going back to our game developer roots.\n\nToday more than ever, I feel extremely proud of our team and thankful for the incredible effort and teamwork it took to get here. So many people have been part of this journey: early employees defined our personality and values and how we show up in the industry. The core leadership team, through almost a decade of creation, growth, expansion, reinvention and turnaround have earned our current success. Early game developers gave us their trust when our vision was stronger than our product and, through feedback and feature requests, helped define the roots of our platform. I’m thinking of Fluik, Kiloo, Supercell, Tinyco, Outfit7, Pocket Gems and so many more. Investors believed in unproven first-time founders and helped us think big. Our current team has fought through our latest transformation and found new ways of continuing to support the growth of our partners to new heights. Thank you everyone. Chartboost would not be the same without you.\n\nAlso today, I’m reflecting on our partnership with Sean and the journey we’ve been through for the last 12 years since we started designing the core business engine inside Tapulous, later Disney mobile, and into abstracting that for all game developers we knew would be coming to mobile. We started Chartboost without real awareness of what we were getting into. We’ve grown and learned. We’ve survived hard times. Even in the good times it has been hard to celebrate since there is always something in danger when you experience growth. Sean had vision when I felt blocked, was calm when I was stressed, and has worked incredibly hard to solve crises, reinvent our platform and keep building our team in our several iterations. Sean, there are no words, thank you for being an amazing partner.\n\nLast but not least, I’m thankful to Pepe without whose contribution, leadership, openness, authenticity and initiative, neither our developer partnerships, nor our team or company culture would be where we are today. Pepe is in the blood of Chartboost and is, in my mind, an honorary co-founder. As a life partner, he has also been my rock and key ingredient for happiness and balance. I’m happy we found each other, and survived 10 years of working together.\n\nI’m excited for the future, for the opportunities for the current team, and for the materialization of success for so many of the owners of Chartboost who have earned this great milestone. Thank you Chartboosters for being part of this journey."
