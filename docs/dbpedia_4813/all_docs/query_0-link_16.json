        "text": "And the new game could be a nice revenue generator for the small startup, which is already profitable.\n\nIn addition to advertising, sponsorship, and affiliate revenue, \"Tap Tap\" players will be able to purchase in-game avatars and a growing library of songs from actually famous artists, as labels and artists grow closer to the \"Tap Tap\" series and the iPhone in general. Revenue from song sales -- two tracks for $0.99, or six tracks for $2.99 -- is split between Apple, Tapulous, and the labels.\n\nFurther, because Tapulous must charge a nominal, $0.99 fee for the app -- Apple requires it for apps using in-app commerce -- we estimate that alone could eventually generate $1 million or more in revenue for Tapulous.\n\nOverall, we estimate Tapulous could do $2-3 million in sales this year. Decrem declined to comment on revenues. But he confirmed that the company is profitable.\n\nAnd what's next?\n\nEarlier this month, Decrem demonstrated a new music game the company is working on at Apple's iPod event. It's called \"Riddim Ribbon,\" combining music and racing, produced in conjunction with \"The Black Eyed Peas\" front man Will.I.Am. It's still in development, but looks cool. We imagine it should be ready by the holidays.\n\nIn about a year, Tapulous should have enough of a social gaming platform built that it could expand beyond music games, if it wanted to. And Decrem says the company will eventually explore other mobile platforms, as well, potentially starting with Google's Android. (First, Android needs to make improvements to its commerce platform, which is not as simple and convenient as Apple's.)"
