        "text": "LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Co. has acquired Tapulous, the maker of the popular iPhone play-along music game “Tap Tap Revenge,” to bolster its ability to create mobile games and gain another toehold in Silicon Valley.\n\n“It definitely is a strategic move and it highlights the importance we put on mobile,” Steve Wadsworth, president of Disney Interactive Media Group, said Thursday. The initial focus will be on making games for Apple’s iPhone, iPad and other emerging mobile platforms, he said.\n\nTapulous already has 30 million users on Apple platforms with games such as “Tap Tap Revenge,” for which it has put out versions with artists such as Metallica, Coldplay, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber. A new game called “Riddim Ribbon” features The Black Eyed Peas.\n\nTapulous’ small staff will remain at the company’s headquarters in Palo Alto. Disney also owns Pixar Animation Studios in nearby Emeryville.\n\nHe did not disclose the terms of the acquisition.\n\nTapulous founder and CEO Bart Decrem and Chief Operating Officer Andrew Lacy will take on mobile business development roles at Disney as part of the deal, Wadsworth said."
