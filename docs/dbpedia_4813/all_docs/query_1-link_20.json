        "text": "An Australian tech whiz who has just made millions after Disney bought his Silicon Valley start-up says that, just a few years ago, he was \"homeless and sleeping on the couch of another entrepreneur\".\n\nNow, Andrew Lacy is taking his entire team on a trip to Las Vegas with his own cash and probably won't have to worry about money again.\n\nHis company, Tapulous, the leading game app maker for the iPhone and iPad, struck gold with the Tap Tap Revenge series of mobile music games. Last week it was acquired by Disney for an undisclosed sum, and Lacy will now join the company as a senior vice-president.\n\nThe acquisition is life-changing for Lacy, 34, who founded the company in 2008 with Bart Decrem. But he's not about to retire - in fact, in a phone interview Lacy said he hadn't even planned to buy a flash new sports car, mansion or travel to an exotic resort.\n\n\"I grew up in a pretty ordinary suburb on the outskirts of Melbourne and I spent a lot of time backpacking around the world so I feel like I've got a little bit of perspective,\" he said, adding he didn't move to Silicon Valley to become rich.\n\n\"For me at least the satisfaction in doing these things is about seeing something grow ... we've been able to create something that's valuable and given employment to so many people in this era categorised by the biggest destruction in shareholder value in the last 30 years.\n\n\"I don't imagine life is going to change that much to be honest.\"\n\nLike many tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, Lacy is a workaholic who loves the start-up world, and says he has no intention of retiring any time soon.\n\n\"When we first started Tapulous I was homeless and sleeping on the couch of another entrepreneur ... now I have my own apartment, and occasionally have entrepreneurs sleeping on my couch,\" he said.\n\nTo thank their team of about 30 people for their hard work, Lacy and Decrem plan to take all staff on a trip to Las Vegas within the next month or so, using their own money. All staff will keep their jobs after the acquisition and the headquarters will remain in Silicon Valley.\n\nLacy was reluctant to talk about his personal life, relationships, the acquisition price or even what car he drove, but it's likely he is now a very rich man. Tapulous announced it was earning revenues of $US1 million a month last December and Lacy said the company had continued to grow strongly since.\n\nDisney bought another internet company, the virtual world Club Penguin, for $US350 million in 2007. Electronic Arts recently acquired Playfish, a competitor to Tapulous, for $US275 million in cash.\n\nBut Lacy didn't get to where he is by accident. He obtained law and commerce degrees from the University of Melbourne before heading to Stanford University to complete an MBA.\n\nStanford is a breeding ground for successful Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page.\n\nLacy previously worked for five years at McKinsey and Company in Australia, Asia and Europe, building internet businesses for several large corporations and advising telecommunication and media companies on digital distribution and content.\n\n\"I have a certain personality that I don't think I'm ever going to slow down,\" Lacy said.\n\nHe said he was excited to be part of the Disney juggernaut and create more apps using Disney's broad intellectual property.\n\n\"The only limits on expansion right now are finding great people to join the team ... I would love to have more Aussies working for me - I've advertised jobs in universities in Australia and I've found it very hard to attract people,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a pretty rich and thriving community of Aussie entrepreneurs over here, but it's hard to get engineers or designers and other folk to take the plunge and join a company over in Silicon Valley.\"\n\nLacy said he didn't believe he would have been as successful if he started the company in Australia, as it is difficult to get access to start-up funding, a large market to sell products into or a collaborative environment where like-minded entrepreneurs share ideas and resources.\n\n\"Silicon Valley is a very unique environment where you're sitting in a coffee shop and the conversation you hear next to you is a couple of entrepreneurs talking about the next start-up they want to start ... when you have this rich exchange of ideas, stuff happens,\" he said.\n\nBut Lacy said he was \"most interested\" in meeting and advising Australian start-ups, particularly those wanting to enter the US market.\n\nOther successful Australian entrepreneurs in the Valley include Leigh Jasper, founder of Aconex, the \"Amazon of construction materials\". Another, Ryan Junee, sold his web video company, Omnisio, to Google last year."
