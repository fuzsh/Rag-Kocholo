        "text": "Post by funfacterdroid on\n\nHello! I was going through Weezer's discography recently, found this EP called \"Christmas with Weezer\", according to Wikipedia it was one of 23 different games in the \"Tap-tap\" series. Created by Tapulous, which was owned by Disney before it dissolved in 2014. But regardless, it seems that most, if not all of these games, are lost since their deletion from the app stores. I imagine that they were deleted because of inactivity. I don't really think that saving these games is possible or even a worthwhile feat, just wanted to see how other people think about it."
