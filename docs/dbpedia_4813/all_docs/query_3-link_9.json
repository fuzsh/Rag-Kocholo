        "text": "Want to know about the mobile app company Disney just swooped up?\n\nCongratulations to Tapulous, the mobile app company founded by Bart Decrem and Andrew Lacy.\n\nThis week, Disney announced that it was buying the popular iPhone game app maker for an undisclosed sum to become a central part of Disney Interactive Media Group, as the group pushes into the mobile entertainment space.\n\nWe've followed the Tapulous story for some time now. We conducted several interviews with Bart, who was CEO of the popular startup, soon after the company raised $1.8 million from notable investors, including Jeff Clavier, Khosla Ventures, X-G Group, Andy Bechtolsheim, Marc Benioff, Katrina Garnett, Alex Lloyd, Jeff Markowitz, Rajeev Motwani, Dan Rosensweig, Aydin Senkut, Ben Smith, Tim Stevens and Rob Theis, to name a few of a total of 30 angels.\n\nHere's a look at some of our past stories to get a good idea of how they won over Disney. Additionally, you'll note that we made a good call on the acquisition. To make it easy for you, we wanted to present our reports in what we'll call the VatorNews brief on this great little company that's achieved a nice exit.\n\nHere's our coverage:\n\nDisney buys Tapulous to enter mobile space\n\nTapulous, the uber-successful developer of iPhone games like Tap Tap Revenge, has been acquired by Disney to become a central part of Disney Interactive Media Group, as the group aggressively pushes into the mobile entertainment space. Terms have not been disclosed. The iPhone developer is especially famous for the Tap Tap Revenge series, which in total racked up over 35 million downloads and a billion songs played. Tapulous' rhythm-based music games are particularly targeted at younger audiences, with some Tap Tap Revenge editions spotlighting specific artists, like Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, and Nine Inch Nails.\n\nTapulous hits 1.3 million installs in less than a month\n\nThe makers of Tap Tap revenge, Tapulous, have become a bigger hit than even Bart Decrem, co-founder and CEO, probably thought. The Palo Alto-based startup, which raised under $2 million in angel funding, launched on July 11th on the Apple Store, and has soared beyond 1.3 million installs in less than a month. Bart, who stopped by the Vator studio for an in-depth interview with me, also said that due to the popularity of Tap Tap Revenge - which has 1 million installs alone - Tapulous is set to break even by the end of the year.\n\nTapulous eyes profitability\n\nTap Tap Revenge, the game Bart and I played head on in this interview, is the hit game released by Tapulous, which was founded by Bart and two other founders, Andrew Lacy and Mike Lee.\n\nAs someone who follows startups closely, the Tapulous story is a gem. This young startup surged to past one million users in one month and operates on a monthly budget under $100,000, the company, which employs eight full-timers, projects to break even within six months of officially launching. \"By the end of the year, we'll be self-sufficient,\" said Bart, in this interview."
