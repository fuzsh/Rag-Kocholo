        "text": "Those deeply involved with the Mac development community have known for a while now that ex-Delicious-Monsterer Mike Lee has been up to something. But what? He has been keeping his activities largely secret since leaving Wil Shipley and gang to pursue his own ventures in the sunny pastures of Silicon Valley. Those secrets (or at least most of them) are no longer, however, as Lee revealed to us the ins and outs of his iPhone startup that he believes will not only show off Apple's mobile platform, but set an example as being the type of grassroots company that the Mac community has come to know and love.\n\nThe company is called Tapulous, which has recruited talent from the likes of Thomas Muldowney (formerly of Jabber), Sean Heber (iApp-a-Day), and Tristan O'Tierney (best known for his work at Yahoo!). Together, the Tapulous team already has what Lee says is \"a whole family of apps\" in the pipeline, including Tap Tap Revenge (\"the sequel to the much ballyhooed Tap Tap Revolution\"), Twinkle (a Twitter client), and Collage (a realtime collaborative art/photo sharing app). \"The focus is on small, beautiful apps, with a focus on bringing people together,\" Lee said.\n\nThat's not all, though. In addition to some other still-secretive plans, Tapulous hopes to show the upcoming swaths of iPhone developers that you don't have to work for a huge company with a huge budget in order to be successful and create kickass products. \"I wouldn't say we're hoping to lead the community per se, but we definitely want to help build it and shape it into the kind of friendly, respectful, and cooperative environment that the Mac has enjoyed,\" Lee told us. \"The Mac has been really grassroots since the beginning, and I hope the iPhone shapes up the same way.\"\n\nLee also hopes to turn Tapulous into the kind of mentoring situation that allowed him to excel in development when he first joined Delicious Monster. The company is always open to speaking with would-be interns and plans to take on a few in order to help them grow. (Hint hint, students and upcoming developers!)\n\nAnd, let's not forget about Lee's drive to save the lemurs in Madagascar, which he started in December. Although his charity efforts are not directly tied into the company, he says that everyone within Tapulous is helping out his United Lemur fund in a big way. \"We actually, as a company, got to go to the St. Louis Zoo, where the Madagascar Fauna Group is based, and get the VIP tour,\" he said. \"All the engineers are feeding lemurs and learning about the cause and such. You don't get that kind of thing from other companies.\""
