        "text": "PALO ALTO, Calif. (PRWEB) February 23, 2018 -- AFX - SPEAK YOUR MIND, the post-partisan, post-cable political news discussion platform, is now SOAPBOX.\n\nIn just 9 months, SOAPBOX has become one of the largest places online where people from all across the political spectrum discuss the day's political news. SOAPBOX routinely sees social media engagement (comments, likes, shares) that is larger than many established news brands, with an audience that is 50% Trump supporters, 50% liberals.\n\nWhile the name has changed, the vision and approach (first person, inclusive, post-partisan) will remain the same.\n\n\"SOAPBOX is all about getting people out of their information echo chamber,\" commented SOAPBOX founder Bart Decrem. \"In an increasingly polarized country, we badly need places where people can be exposed and engage in thoughtful conversation with people they disagree with.\"\n\nSOAPBOX is based in Palo Alto, CA. Founders include Bart Decrem (Firefox, Tapulous, Disney) and Shannon Broderick (Playdom, Disney). Investors include WNDRCO.\n\nSOAPBOX is on Facebook at fb.com/SOAPBOXusa and on the web at TheSoapbox.live. Stay tuned for new Twitter info (currently @AFXpolitics). The SOAPBOX smartphone app will launch in just a few weeks!"
