The family moved to Rome in 1963 and later to Nonnenhorn on Lake Constance in Germany in 1968.\n\nAt the age of 16, he designed an industrial controller based on the Intel 8008, supporting much of his education through royalties.\n\nHe studied computer engineering at the Technical University of Munich and earned a Master's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1976. Subsequently, he pursued a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Stanford University.\n\nDespite spending most of his life in the US, Bechtolsheim retained his German nationality and did not seek US citizenship.\n\nCareer\n\nAt Stanford, Bechtolsheim designed the SUN workstation, a powerful computer with built-in networking, inspired by the Xerox Alto computer developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.\n\nIn 1982, he co-founded Sun Microsystems with Scott McNealy, Vinod Khosla, and Bill Joy, becoming employee number one.\n\nSun Microsystems went public in 1986 and reached $1 billion in sales by 1988.\n\nBechtolsheim left Sun in 1995 to found Granite Systems, a Gigabit Ethernet startup, which was later acquired by Cisco Systems for $220 million in 1996.\n\nIn 2001, he co-founded Kealia, Inc. with Stanford Professor David Cheriton, focusing on advanced server technologies. Sun Microsystems acquired Kealia in 2004.\n\nBechtolsheim, along with Cheriton, founded Arastra in 2005, later renamed Arista Networks. He left Sun Microsystems to become the Chairman and Chief Development Officer of Arista in 2008.\n\nInvestments\n\nBechtolsheim, along with David Cheriton, invested $100,000 each in Google in September 1998, becoming early investors in the company.\n\nHe made successful investments in electronic design automation (EDA) companies, including Magma Design Automation and Co-Design Automation.\n\nInvested in Tapulous, a music game maker for Apple iPhone, which was later acquired by the Walt Disney Company in 2010.\n\nJoined George T. Haber to invest in wireless chip company CrestaTech in 2006 and 2008.\n\nInvested in Claria Corporation and PerimeterX, an automated attack mitigation SaaS, among other ventures.\n\nHow long would it take you to become as rich as Andy Bechtolsheim ?\n\nIf you started with $10,000 and invested an additional $500 each month at a 43.85% CAGR, it would take you 5 years to reach Andy Bechtolsheim 's net worth of $18.0B.\n\nIs this realistic?

As summarized in our five fundamental rules to wealth building, becoming wealthy in a modern capitalist economy is not complicated. There's actually only three variables:\n\nYour starting capital\n\nYour earnings after expenses\n\nThe compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of your savings\n\nMost people start with zero or very little, so if you weren't born into wealth, don't fret! The majority of the fortunate folks listed in our Grizzly Bullsâ€™ Billionaires Index came from middle class or lower backgrounds. The most distinguishing characteristic of the group is their ability to consistently earn a high CAGR on their savings.\n\nEvery billionaire has a unique strategy to achieve high CAGR. For Andy Bechtolsheim , Google is the primary source . Whether you choose to invest your savings in your own businesses or the businesses of others is not as important. The salient piece of the puzzle is ensuring that your hard-earned savings are generating sufficient CAGR to reach your long term goals.\n\nMost people simply invest their money in index funds and call it a day. There's nothing wrong with this approach, but it guarantees relative mediocrity. To achieve greatness, you need to invest your money to earn higher than average returns. In the long run, better investors will always finish ahead of better earners.\n\nSource: Grizzly Bulls reporting\n\nMethodology: Grizzly Bulls' Billionaires Index is a daily ranking of the world's billionaires and richest people.
