Its productions included Tap Tap Revenge, a launch title for the App Store and one of the most popular titles for iOS. On July 1, 2010, Tapulous was acquired by The Walt Disney Company. In January 2014, CEO Bart Decrem resigned, and a few days later, the company announced they would shut down and take off all their games from app stores.\n\nLogo (2008-2014)\n\nVisuals: There is a fingerprint mark that has splats of rainbow colors around it. Below it, there is the arena-styled white text \"Tapulous\". The logo appeared differently depending on the game.\n\nTechnique: A still, digital graphic.\n\nAudio: None."
