TechCrunch reports that Palo Alto-based iOS development firm Tapulous has been acquired by Disney. Tapulous, the company beyond the popular Tap Tap Revenge series of rhythm tapping applications, was reported last December to have a staff of 20 employees and be bringing in nearly a million dollars per month in sales.

Tapulous has been acquired by Disney. The iPhone gaming startup with several hits on its hands was founded by Bart Decrem, who will join Disney as a VP. COO Andrew Lacy is also joining Disney as a VP. Disney is very interested in social and mobile gaming, having recently invested in Playdom's $33 million round.

Long an App Store staple on the iPhone, Tapulous moved onto the iPad earlier this year with the release of Tap Tap Radiation.

The acquisition is notable not only as an example of small development firms being able to see significant enough success to appeal to major media players, but also for Disney's connection to Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who is the company's largest individual shareholder.
