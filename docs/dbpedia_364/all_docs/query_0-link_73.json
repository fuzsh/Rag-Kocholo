Add in insurance, collision wavers, cleaning charges and the “you’re a foreigner; open your wallet and repeat after me “help yourself”” and the bargain becomes less of a bargain.\n\nIf you’re thinking of a one way pick up and drop it’ll probably be cheaper to buy a car in Porto and sell it in Santiago.

Be aware there are very expensive drop-off charges for a rental car when you return it to a country different than the one you rented it in. Check with your auto insurance company to make sure you are fully covered for all hazards by your policy when driving in a foreign country, the added cost of insurance sold by the rental companies can be a deal killer.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

On the first page, in small print and at the bottom, it says \"Fees and taxes are not included in the car rates displayed above\". On this version of the website you will see the one-way fee and a surcharge only at the very end when you are about to pay. Be ready for a very big surprise because pick-up and drop-off location are not identical and they are in two different countries.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances ' 22, Madrid '24, Frances '24\n\nDec 17, 2023\n\n#8\n\nHello ALL\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year\n\nI want to rent a car In Porto and drive to Santiago de Compostela.\n\nDo you need an International Drivers License ?\n\nAlso the prices I see online to rent a car are so cheap I can't believe they are correct.\n\nThanks JLV\n\nI rented a car in 2022 in Spain. Also for me, car rental prices were much cheaper in Spain then in North America or many other places. But just make sure that you read all the fine print and extra charges so you don’t get any surprises. A foreign country drop fee could be high.\n\nYou don’t need an international drivers license to actually rent a car (in Spain at least, they only asked to see my resident country drivers license) . I don’t know if they’ll check in Portugal. However, you do need one if you are stopped by the police. And you’ll get a really nasty ticket, at least a few hundred euros. This happened to someone I know. So get it.\n\nAlso, I did use my credit card as the insurance.\n\nAnd I did damage the car to the tune of €1200 by accidentally parking on the side of the road where there was a ditch! They charged me this when I dropped off the car, but eventually, six months later, the credit card insurance company paid me back(after a lot of back-and-forth with paperwork).\n\nLast edited: Dec 17, 2023\n\nJ Willhaus\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2016, 2022, 2023, 2024, planned 2025\n\nDec 17, 2023\n\n#9\n\nIn 2017 it was cheaper for us to rent a car for a couple of weeks to volunteer than it was to take the train or bus from Madrid to Zamora. Also due to lack of trains and buses on the Jan 1 holiday, we couldn't get back to catch our early flight on Jan 2. It was very reasonable then costing less than a couple hundred dollars.\n\nLast summer rented and returned a car in Pamplona as we needed one for shopping in our remote volunteer site. It was almost 5 times that much.

I was in santiago trying to rent a car for a month and it was usually at least €2000. But I started checking other cities and saved €1000 by taking a train to Leon and picking up a car there. So I think there’s some demand algorithm? Some places are cheaper.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

That's for a one day rental and a tiny car (Peugeot 208) for a trip from Porto to Santiago !\n\nIf it is one way inside Spain, the fee is much smaller and depends on the distance between the two locations, for example Madrid-Santiago €150 or Leon-Santiago €25.\n\nMany people are not aware of these steep fees for a one-way car rental between two locations in two different countries because they never rent a car for such trips.\n\nLast edited: Dec 17, 2023\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2021\n\nDec 17, 2023\n\n#12\n\nThank You For the info, We would be returning it to Porto and flying back home to USA.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

So I guess it’s a question of how important following the rules is to you and what your risk tolerance level is.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\ncycled from Pamplona Sep 2015;Frances, walked from St Jean May/June 2017.

You will also need a physical copy of your regular licence which includes a photograph. As I understand it, electronic copies of your licence (those saved to your mobile phone or tablet) are usually not accepted. Also tell the car rental agency that you will be leaving Portugal.

Finding another company involved time, stress and money because the other company were more expensive. You can get one from your national motorists' association very easily. Car hire in Spain is cheap, I suspect this is because companies have a very high turnover, it is also very competitive. This may explain why picking up a car from the airport is often cheaper, sometimes a lot cheaper, than downtown. If you collect a car from company X at Santiago airport and drop it off at Madrid airport, they will keep it there until a new customer comes along and hires it - not very long. But if you drop the same car off in Porto, they can´t hire it because it is not registered in Portugal so they will probably charge a hefty drop off fee. ´Upselling´ extra services such as insurance is something car hire companies do all over the world, Spain is no different. The other thing to mention is that road tolls in Portugal are quite expensive. Good luck.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

They recognize US drivers licenses. So you don't need one. That said it's super easy to get one in the US if you want one. Just go to triple A. The prices are cheap but they don't usually include the insurance that is mandatory for foreigners. I highly recommend using a car company that is also in the US. Like Enterprise or whomever. That way when there is a problem (and there will be a problem) you can handle it when u get home. Also you absolutely can take flixbus to Santiago and save yourself the headaches.

These charges could easily exceed the cost of rental.\n\nI recommend you take the full insurance cover offered by the renting agency at the time of renting. Yes, it costs more. But, you basically only have to return the parts to the rental agency. I had this happen to me in Belgium about seven years ago. I had the near-totalled car towed back to the airport rental location. They simply gave me a new car. A dump truck side swiped me and tore off the partially open driver's door while I was properly parallel-parked. THAT was an interesting explanation.\n\nI had another instance in Spain about five years ago where I backed into a parking bollard and damaged the rear bumper cover. In that instance, my credit card company picked it up, but I had to pay a large flat fee on the credit card to return the car. It all worked out, but it is a hassle.\n\nRemember that you will need a different set of driving skills in old Europe (non limited access highways) than in the US. The roads are far narrower, with more blind corners, and drop offs. In most places, once you leave downtown, there is not a lot of night street lighting, except on limited access roads.\n\nI always rent the smallest possible car consistent with my needs, to increase my separation for other vehicles and immovable objects. Finally, do drive slower and more deliberately than you would at home.

Is the process of buying/selling significant? You did it twice, so I assume it must have been worth it for some situations. Your thoughts would be appreciated.\n\nBoth times we were living in the country for a year, so it was kind of a no-brainer. The process wasn't terribly complicated, but I confess my husband did most of it. In Madrid in 1994 we bought a 1979 Peugeot, best car we ever had, for about $1000 US (no euro yet). We put about 35,000 kms on it, just on the Iberian peninsula on out of town trips. Never drove it in the city. At the end of the year, we couldn't find anyone to give it to, much less sell it. The manager of our apartment building took it to a scrap yard. That made me very sad, because it was such a great car, except for the fact that you had to turn on the heat and open the windows to take some of the heat off the motor when driving in the Picos or Pyrenees. The other time was in Portugal and it was also very straightforward. We were able to sell that car for a little more than what we paid for it, which was a treat, that was in 2004. It was a small VW.\n\nI surely wouldn't do it if I were going to be there for less than a year because there is a fair amount of bureaucracy involved with the title transfer, getting insurance, etc.\n\nMarus99\n\nWalking Camino Norte Q1 2024\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrancés ‘14, Portugués ‘17, Francés ‘22\n\nDec 18, 2023\n\n#32\n\nThe prices you see online are unbelievable and should not be believed. Add in insurance, collision wavers, cleaning charges and the “you’re a foreigner; open your wallet and repeat after me “help yourself”” and the bargain becomes less of a bargain.\n\nIf you’re thinking of a one way pick up and drop it’ll probably be cheaper to buy a car in Porto and sell it in Santiago. Or you could just catch the bus\n\nDon’t entirely agree. The prices you see online (for Spain at least) are accurate so long as you have a credit card that provides insurance coverage. I have used my Amex Platinum card for decades and have rarely paid more than $30 a day. The car rental companies will always try to upsell you on car size and insurance and imply that you need to pay for more coverage. Make sure you understand your credit card coverage properly and ignore the upsell. Avoid the companies you have never heard of who will try and charge you for non-existent damage.

It took about six months but eventually they paid.\n\nBut what you want is to use a credit card that lists it as “primary“ car rental insurance, as opposed to secondary. If it’s secondary, they’re going to want you to run it past your home insurance Before they will pay. It’ll probably still work, but it’ll be an extra layer of paperwork and time consuming.\n\nI suspect an AMEX platinum has a very good car rental coverage. I had a united business card. But for others, it might be worthwhile researching and applying for a new credit card just for peace of mind.\n\nAnd I agree with you, @Marus99 , If you have a credit card for the insurance and you don’t accept any extras usually it’s pretty cheap. Might have to try a bunch of companies, usually cars at airports ( there are often locations in the downtown of major cities) are more expensive because of an extra tax, etc.\n\nLast edited: Dec 20, 2023\n\nnaplesdon\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMultiple Caminos 2010 to 2019\n\nDec 20, 2023\n\n#35\n\nUnless you limit your driving to the back roads, you will find out that the road tolls are equal to a bus or train fare.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nUs:Camino Frances, 2015 Me:Catalan/Aragonese, 2019\n\nDec 20, 2023\n\n#36\n\nUnless you limit your driving to the back roads, you will find out that the road tolls are equal to a bus or train fare.\n\nI remember one toll road we took in '88.
