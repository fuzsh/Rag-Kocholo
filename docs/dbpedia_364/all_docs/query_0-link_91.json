        "text": "Spain is famous for its pleasant weather - the warm and mild climate is one of the main reasons why millions of travelers visit every year. It's important to keep in mind, though, that Spain is a rather large country, so different parts of it are best enjoyed at different times of the year.\n\nThe famous Mediterranean resorts of Spain have a nice climate year-round, but most travelers choose to visit them in mid-to-late spring or early autumn. While summer months are also popular among tourists, temperatures in July and August often reach and even exceed 35 °C (95 °F), thus becoming prohibitively scorching for travelers not used to this kind of heat. It's important to note that the weather in the Mediterranean region, especially in Andalusia, is mild and pleasant year-round, so while it might be too cold to swim in January, it can also be a good time to visit for those who want to escape large crowds. The average high temperature in Malaga is 24.3 °C (75.7 °F) in May, 30.8 °C (87.4 °F) in August, and 17.5 °C (63.5 °F) in December.\n\nBarcelona is located on the Mediterranean Sea and thus its weather is the nicest in late spring and early summer or early autumn. The average high temperature is 19.3 °C (66.7 °F) in May and 26.1 °C (79 °F) in August. The same goes for the capital, Madrid, which, while located at the center of the country, is at a rather high altitude (the average high temperature there is 16.7 °C (62.1 °F) in May and 25.1 °C (77.2 °F) in August).\n\nInsider's tip: If the weather is not your number one priority, both cities are great to visit at any month and some travelers even choose to come in late autumn or winter as the amount of cultural events is higher, the crowds are smaller and the prices for things like accommodation and car rentals are lower.\n\nMost visitors to Spain prefer to pick up a rental car at the airport. 24 different Spanish airports handled at least one million travelers in 2023 , and the likes of Madrid-Barajas and Barcelona El-Prat are among the busiest in Europe. Most regions of Spain have at least one international airport and some have multiple — you'll find five in Andalusia and four in Catalonia.\n\nThe larger Spanish airports, namely Madrid-Barajas and Barcelona-El Prat, offer flights to and from most parts of the world. Many low-cost companies like Ryanair, easyJet, Vueling, and Transavia, fly to and from Spain offering cheap connections with other European countries.\n\nInsider's tip: Not only is it very convenient to pick up and drop off a rental car at the airport, it will almost always be significantly cheaper than doing so in the same car rental provider's office in the city center.\n\nMany car rental companies in Spain offer one-way rentals. While it usually requires a small extra fee, many travelers use this opportunity as it gives them the freedom to explore as much of the country as they want without the hassle of returning to their point of entry. One-way rentals between countries are also possible, and it's quite popular to travel by car between Barcelona and Nice, Vigo and Porto, or San Sebastian and Bordeaux. The fee for international one-way rentals is usually higher than for domestic ones. You can see the exact prices by using our website to search for travel dates and pick-up and drop-off locations of your choice.\n\nIt is also possible to pick up and drop off a car in many other locations such as international hotels, car rental company offices, and large shopping malls.\n\nThe official, and by far most used language, in Spain is, of course, Spanish (sometimes also called Castilian). Spain is also home to a number of other languages and dialects.\n\nCatalan is the local language in Barcelona and the rest of Catalonia, as well as in the Balearic Islands and parts of the Valencian Community. Like Spanish, it is also a Romance language and the two are closely related, but not exactly mutually intelligible. Galician, spoken in Galicia and small pockets of Asturia, is more similar to Portuguese. Basque, spoken in the Basque Country and parts of Navarre, is a language isolate and has no similarities with Spanish or any other living language. Although the regional identities in Spain are strong and you're only going to make friends by learning some phrases in the local tongue, it's important to keep in mind that virtually all speakers of Catalan, Basque and Galician, as well as other smaller languages and dialects, are fluent in standard Spanish.\n\nKnowledge of English varies quite considerably across Spain. Many people speak it in the big cities of Barcelona, Madrid, and Bilbao, as well as in areas that get a lot of tourists like Costa del Sol and the Valencian coast; however, you might be hard-pressed to find a speaker of English in the rural areas of Aragon or Extremadura, or even in the non-touristy quarters of cities. Learning at least some basic Spanish will go a long way as Spaniards are generally known to be friendly and patient with foreigners trying to speak their tongue. The level of knowledge of English is, of course, higher among people working in the tourism industry.\n\nIn some coastal regions of the country, German and Dutch are often heard due to the very large number of visitors from Germany and the Netherlands, as well as pensioners from those countries who have retired in Spain. French is also spoken by a considerable number of Spaniards, especially in the Spanish regions that border France.\n\nSpain has a large number of very popular travel destinations that get thousands of visitors every year. This section focuses on travel destinations of mainland Spain. For more information on the two Spanish archipelagos and travel meccas, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, see their respective sections.\n\nThe most visited cities in Spain are the capital, Madrid, as well as Barcelona, the capital and largest city of the region of Catalonia. Both offer an absolute wealth of world-class landmarks, fun experiences, and things to see and do. As huge world cities, they both have a lot of car traffic, but getting a rental car can still be a great way to see them as it will give you the opportunity to see both the main tourist attractions and hidden gems on your own terms and even travel beyond the city limits. As a tourist, you'll also have the freedom to avoid driving during peak hours.\n\nBesides the big two, there are a lot of other amazing Spanish cities. These include Granada with its Arabic history and the Alhambra, Bilbao which is known for its sophistication and modern architecture, and Valencia, home of the City of Arts and Science and the capital of paella.\n\nSpain is famous for its idyllic Mediterranean beaches. Some of the most famous seaside stretches include the Costa del Sol (or the Sun Coast) in Andalusia, the Costa Blanca (or the White Coast) in the Valencian Community, and the Costa Brava (or the Wild Coast) in Catalonia. Getting a rental car is the best way to experience all that one of these coasts has to offer as you'll be able to visit different spots and find lesser-known spots on your own.\n\nSpain is so diverse and fascinating that you could easily spend months visiting its impressive cathedrals, climbing the mountains, enjoying different beaches, and sampling regional varieties of delicious cuisine. However, given that most travelers have at least some sort of time limitation for their trip, these are the approximate number of days that you'd need for visiting different famous Spanish destinations.\n\nTo get an exhilarating first taste of Madrid and Barcelona, two or three days may suffice. Many travelers visit these cities on such short weekend breaks, and with an abundance of cheap international flights from Europe and beyond, they are more accessible than ever. Two or three days will give you the opportunity to see some of the most famous sites (such as the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona or Prado in Madrid) and perhaps have a short dive into the famous Spanish nightlife. However, this only scratches the surface of what these amazing cities have to offer; a visit of at least 5 to 7 days would be optimal — it would give you the time to explore them at your own pace, visit the famous landmarks at less busy times, make your own small discoveries and drive outside the city at least once or twice (to Costa Brava or the Catalan countryside from Barcelona or to Toledo from Madrid).\n\nIt's probably fair to say that you also need close to a week to really explore smaller Spanish cities like San Sebastian, Granada, or Vigo. While, thanks to low-cost airlines, they can absolutely be visited on a weekend trip, there are still plenty of landmarks to see and things to do. Many experienced travelers agree that Spain is a country that is best enjoyed at a leisurely pace."
