        "text": "An International Driving Permit (IDP), often referred to as an international driving license, is a translation of a domestic driving license that allows the holder to drive a private motor vehicle in any country or jurisdiction that recognises the document. The term International Driving Permit was first mentioned in the document prescribed in the International Convention relative to Motor Traffic that was signed at Paris in 1926, and is a translation of the French 'permis de conduire international', or 'international driving license'. The Paris treaty, and all subsequent, use the word 'permit' exclusively in relation to all kinds of driving license.\n\nInternational Driving Permits are governed by three international conventions: the 1926 Paris International Convention relative to Motor Traffic, the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, and the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. When a state is contracted to more than one convention, the newest one terminates and replaces previous ones.\n\nThe IDP, whose A6 size (148 × 105 mm) is slightly larger than a passport, has a grey cover and white inside pages. The outside and inside of the front cover shall be printed in (at least one of) the national language(s) of the issuing State. The last two inside pages shall be printed in French, and pages preceding those two pages shall repeat the first of them in several languages, which must include English, Russian and Spanish.\n\nIDPs are issued by a national government directly, or through a network of AIT/FIA organizations or by any association duly empowered thereto by such other Contracting Party.[1] For the latter case those issuing organizations are mostly automobile associations,[2] such as American Automobile Association[3] in the United States, Norwegian Automobile Federation[4] in Norway and Riksförbundet M Sverige[5] in Sweden. As there are many unofficial sellers on the internet, the AIT/FIA has created an approved directory to all IDP issuing organizations in the world.[6]\n\nTo be valid, the IDP must be accompanied by a valid Driver's license issued in the applicant's country of residence. An IDP is not required if the driver's domestic licence meets the requirements of the 1949 or 1968 convention; the domestic licence can be used directly in a foreign jurisdiction that is a party to that convention.[7] In addition, other arrangements eliminates the need of an IDP in some countries, such as the European driving licence valid within the European Economic Area (EEA) as well as member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with each other.[8]\n\nThe convention has been ratified by 83 countries/jurisdictions.[9] Examples of countries/jurisdictions that have not ratified the Convention include Australia, Canada, China, Cyprus, Iceland, Ireland, Malaysia, Malta, New Zealand, and the United States.\n\nThe main regulations about driving licences are in Annex 6 (domestic driving permit) and Annex 7 (International Driving Permit). The currently active version of those is in force in each contracting party since no later than 29 March 2011 (Article 43). According to the 1968 Vienna Convention, an IDP must have an expiration date of no more than three years from its issue date or until the expiration date of national driving permit, whichever is earlier, and it is valid for a period of one year upon the arrival in the foreign country.\n\nArticle 41 of the convention describes requirements for driving licences. Key of those are:\n\nevery driver of a motor vehicle must hold a driving licence;\n\ndriving permits can be issued only after passing theoretical and practical exams, which are regulated by each country or jurisdiction;\n\nContracting parties shall recognize as valid for driving in their territories:\n\ndomestic driving permit conforming to the provisions of annex 6 to the convention;\n\nInternational Driving Permit conforms to the provisions of annex 7 to the convention, on condition that it is presented with the corresponding domestic driving permit;\n\ndriving permits issued by a contracting party shall be recognised in the territory of another contracting party until this territory becomes the place of normal residence of their holder;\n\nall of the above does not apply to learner-driver licences;\n\nthe period of validity of an international driving permit shall be either no more than three years after the date of issue or until the date of expiry of the domestic driving licence, whichever is earlier;\n\nContracting parties may refuse to recognise the validity of driving licences for persons under eighteen or, for categories C, D, CE and DE, under twenty-one;\n\nan international driving permit shall only be issued by the contracting party in whose territory the holder has their normal residence and that issued the domestic driving permit or that recognised the driving permit issued by another contracting party; it shall not be valid for use in that territory.\n\nLicence categories according to the 1968 convention applicable from 29 March 2011[10] Category Description Category Description\n\nA\n\nMotorcycles\n\nA1\n\nMotorcycles with a cubic capacity not exceeding 125 cm3 and a power not exceeding 11 kW (light motorcycles)\n\nB\n\nMotor vehicles, other than those in category A, having a permissible maximum mass not exceeding 3,500 kg and not more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat; or motor vehicles of category В coupled to a trailer the permissible maximum mass of which does not exceed 750 kg; or motor vehicles of category В coupled to a trailer the permissible maximum mass of which exceeds 750 kg but does not exceed the unladen mass of the motor vehicle, where the combined permissible maximum mass of the vehicles so coupled does not exceed 3,500 kg\n\nB1\n\nMotor tricycles and quadricycles\n\nC\n\nMotor vehicles, other than those in category D, having a permissible maximum mass exceeding 3,500 kg; or motor vehicles of category С coupled to a trailer the permissible maximum mass of which does not exceed 750 kg\n\nC1\n\nMotor vehicles, with the exception of those in category D, the permissible maximum mass of which exceeds 3,500 kg but does not exceed 7,500 kg; or motor vehicles of subcategory C1 coupled to a trailer, the permissible maximum mass of which does not exceed 750 kg\n\nD\n\nMotor vehicles used for the carriage of passengers and having more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat; or motor vehicles of category D coupled to a trailer the permissible maximum mass of which does not exceed 750 kg\n\nD1\n\nMotor vehicles used for the carriage of passengers and having more than 8 seats in addition to the driver's seat but not more than 16 seats in addition to the driver's seat; or motor vehicles of subcategory D1 coupled to a trailer, the permissible maximum mass of which does not exceed 750 kg\n\nBE\n\nMotor vehicles of category В coupled to a trailer the permissible maximum mass of which exceeds 750 kg and exceeds the unladen mass of the motor vehicle; or motor vehicles of category В coupled to a trailer the permissible maximum mass of which exceeds 750 kg, where the combined permissible maximum mass of the vehicles so coupled exceeds 3,500 kg\n\nCE\n\nMotor vehicles of category С coupled to a trailer whose permissible maximum mass exceeds 750 kg\n\nC1E\n\nMotor vehicles of subcategory C1 coupled to a trailer the permissible maximum mass of which exceeds 750 kg but does not exceed the unladen mass of the motor vehicle, where the combined permissible maximum mass of the vehicles so coupled does not exceed 12,000 kg\n\nDE\n\nMotor vehicles of category D coupled to a trailer whose permissible maximum mass exceeds 750 kg\n\nD1E\n\nMotor vehicles of subcategory D1 coupled to a trailer, not used for the carriage of persons, the permissible maximum mass of which exceeds 750 kg but does not exceed the unladen mass of the motor vehicle, where the combined permissible maximum mass of the vehicles so coupled does not exceed 12,000 kg\n\nThe convention had amendments on 3 September 1993 and 28 March 2006. There is a European Agreement supplementing the Convention on Road Traffic (1968), which was concluded in Geneva, on 1 May 1971.\n\nNote that before 29 March 2011 the convention demanded contracting parties to recognise as valid for driving in their territories:\n\nany domestic driver's permit drawn up in their national language or in one of their national languages, or, if not drawn up in such a language, accompanied by a certified translation;\n\nany domestic driver's permit conforming to the provisions of annex 6 to the convention; and\n\nany international driver permit conforming to the provisions of annex 7 to the convention.\n\nPrior to 29 March 2011, annex 6 and annex 7 defined forms of driver's licences that are different from those defined after that date. Driving licences issued before 29 March 2011 that match older edition of the annexes are valid until their expiration dates (article 43).\n\nLicence classes according to the 1968 convention[10] Class Description\n\nA\n\nMotorcycles\n\nB\n\nMotor vehicles, other than those in category A, having a permissible maximum mass not exceeding 3,500 kg and not more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat.\n\nC\n\nMotor vehicles, other than those in category D, whose permissible maximum mass exceeds 3,500 kg.\n\nD\n\nMotor vehicles used for the carriage of passengers and having more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat.\n\nE\n\nCombination of vehicles of which the driving vehicle is in a category or categories for which the driver is licensed (B, and/or C and/or D), but which are not themselves in that category or those categories.\n\nThe 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic has been ratified by 101 states. The 1949 Convention's description of a driving permit and international driving permit are located in Annexes 9 and 10. Switzerland signed but did not ratify the convention. The 1949 Geneva Convention states that an IDP remains valid for one year from the date of issue, with a grace period of six months.\n\nThere is a European Agreement supplementing the 1949 Convention on Road Traffic, in addition to the 1949 Protocol on Road Signs and Signals, concluded in Geneva on 16 September 1950.\n\nLicence classes according to the 1949 convention[11] Class Description\n\nA\n\nMotor cycles, with or without a side-car, invalid carriages and three-wheeled motor vehicles with an unladen weight not exceeding 400 kg (900 lbs).\n\nB\n\nMotor vehicles used for the transport of passengers and comprising, in addition to the driver's seat, at most eight seats, or those used for the transport of goods and having a permissible maximum weight not exceeding 3,500 kg (7,700 lbs). Vehicles in this category may be coupled with a light trailer.\n\nC\n\nMotor vehicles used for the transport of goods and of which the permissible maximum weight exceeds 3,500 kg (7,700 lbs). Vehicles in this category may be coupled with a light trailer.\n\nD\n\nMotor vehicles used for the transport of passengers and comprising, in addition to the driver's seat, more than eight seats.

It is only required in Somalia. International Driving Permits according to the 1926 Convention on Motor Traffic might also still be valid in Liechtenstein and Mexico.[12] However, both are parties of the above-mentioned later conventions, thus the most recent signed convention is the valid one.[13][14] Mexico also recognizes the Inter-American Driving Permit according to the convention on the Regulation of Inter-American Automotive Traffic 1943.\n\nLicence classes according to the 1926 convention[15] Class Description\n\nA\n\nMotor vehicles of which the laden weight does not exceed 3,500 kg.\n\nB\n\nMotor vehicles of which the laden weight exceeds 3,500 kg.\n\nC\n\nMotor-cycles, with or without side-car.\n\nAccording to the 1968 Vienna Convention, an IDP must have an expiration date of no more than three years from its issue date or until the expiration date of national driving permit, whichever is earlier, and it is valid for a period of one year upon the arrival in the foreign country.[16] The previous convention (1949 Geneva Convention) stated that an IDP remains valid for one year from the date of issue.\n\nThe IDP is not valid for driving in the country or jurisdiction where it was issued, it can only be used in foreign countries, and it must be shown with the carrier's original driver's license.\n\nParticipant 1968\n\nVienna[17]\n\n3-year IDP 1949\n\nGeneva[18]\n\n1-year IDP 1926\n\nParis[19]\n\n1-year IDP Albania Yes Yes Algeria Yes Argentina Yes Yes Armenia Yes Australia Yes Austria Yes Yes Yes Azerbaijan Yes Bahamas Yes Bahrain Yes Bangladesh Yes Barbados Yes Belarus Yes Belgium Yes Yes Benin Yes Yes Bosnia and Herzegovina Yes Botswana Yes Brazil Yes Brunei Yes Bulgaria Yes Yes Yes Burkina Faso Yes Cabo Verde Yes Cambodia** Yes Canada Yes Central African Republic Yes Yes Chile Yes Yes Yes Congo Yes Costa Rica Yes Côte d'Ivoire Yes Yes Croatia Yes Yes Cuba Yes Yes Yes Cyprus Yes Czech Republic Yes Yes Congo, Democratic Republic Yes Yes Denmark Yes Yes Dominican Republic Yes Ecuador Yes Yes Egypt Yes Yes Estonia Yes Yes Ethiopia Yes Fiji Yes Finland Yes Yes France Yes Yes Yes Georgia Yes Yes Germany Yes Yes Yes Ghana Yes Yes Greece Yes Yes Guatemala Yes Yes Guyana Yes Haiti Yes Holy See Yes Yes Honduras Yes Hong Kong Yes Hungary Yes Yes Yes Iceland Yes India Yes Indonesia Yes Iran (Islamic Republic of) Yes Yes Iraq Yes Ireland Yes Israel Yes Yes Italy Yes Yes Yes Jamaica Yes Japan Yes Jordan Yes Kazakhstan Yes Kenya Yes Kuwait Yes Kyrgyzstan Yes Yes Laos Yes Latvia Yes Lebanon Yes Lesotho Yes Liberia Yes Liechtenstein Yes Yes Lithuania Yes Yes Luxembourg Yes Yes Yes Macau Yes Madagascar Yes Malawi Yes Malaysia Yes Mali Yes Malta Yes Mexico Yes Yes Monaco Yes Yes Yes Mongolia Yes Montenegro Yes Yes Morocco Yes Yes Yes Myanmar Yes Namibia Yes Nepal Yes Yes Netherlands Yes Yes New Zealand Yes Niger Yes Yes Nigeria Yes Yes North Macedonia Yes Norway Yes Yes Oman Yes Pakistan Yes Papua New Guinea Yes Paraguay Yes Peru Yes Yes Yes Philippines Yes Yes Poland Yes Yes Yes Portugal Yes Yes Yes Qatar Yes China, Republic of (Taiwan) Yes Yes Korea, Republic of Yes Yes Moldova, Republic of Yes Romania Yes Yes Yes Russian Federation Yes Yes Rwanda Yes San Marino Yes Yes Saudi Arabia Yes Senegal Yes Yes Serbia Yes Yes Seychelles Yes Sierra Leone Yes Singapore Yes Slovakia Yes Yes Slovenia Yes Yes South Africa Yes Yes Spain Yes Yes Sri Lanka Yes Sweden Yes Yes Switzerland Yes Yes Yes Syrian Arab Republic Yes Tajikistan Yes Thailand Yes Yes Togo Yes Trinidad and Tobago Yes Tunisia Yes Yes Yes Turkey Yes Yes Turkmenistan Yes Uganda Yes Ukraine Yes United Arab Emirates Yes Yes United Kingdom Yes Yes United States of America Yes Uruguay Yes Yes Uzbekistan Yes Venezuela Yes Yes Vietnam Yes Zimbabwe Yes Yes\n\n** IDP must be exchanged for a local driving licence.\n\nIn relations between the Contracting States, the 1949 Geneva Convention terminated and replaced the International Convention relative to Motor Traffic and the International Convention relative to Road Traffic signed at Paris on 24 April 1926, and the convention on the Regulation of Inter- American Automotive Traffic opened for signature at Washington on 15 December 1943.\n\nIn relations between the Contracting States, the 1968 Vienna Convention terminated and replaced the International Convention relative to Motor Traffic and the International Convention relative to Road Traffic, signed at Paris on 24 April 1926, the convention on the Regulation of Inter-American Automotive Traffic, opened for signature at Washington on 15 December 1943, and the Convention on Road Traffic, opened for signature at Geneva on 19 September 1949.\n\nISO/IEC 18013 establishes guidelines for the design format and data content of an ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL). The design approach is to establish a secure domestic driving permit (DDP) and accompanying booklet for international use, instead of the international driving permit (IDP) paper document.[20][21] The ISO standard specifies requirements for a card that is aligned with the UN Conventions on Road Traffic.[22]\n\nThis standard however, it should be noted, has no official mandate or recognition from the WP.1 of UNECE as a replacement for the current IDP standards as described in the 1949 and 1968 Conventions.\n\nThe requirements with regards to content and layout of the data elements is contained in Annex A of ISO/IEC 18013-1:2018. While the main ideology is a minimum acceptable set of requirements, sufficient freedom is afforded to the issuing authorities of driving licences to meet domestic needs such as existing standards, data contents and security elements.\n\nThe specifications of the layout of the booklet is defined in Annex G of ISO/IEC 18013-1:2018. There are two options; a booklet with some personalisation or a booklet with no personalisation.\n\nThe booklet shall be marginally larger than an ID-1 size driving license card, with an insert pocket for storage of the card, and for convenient carrying of the booklet. The front cover should include the logo of the UN or the issuing country and the words “Translation of Driving Licence” and \"Traduction du Permis de Conduire \".\n\nThe American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators' provides a standard for the design of driving permits and identification cards issued by its member jurisdictions, which include all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and Canadian territories and provinces. The newest standard released is the 2020 AAMVA DL/ID Card Design Standard (CDS) which generally follows part 1 and part 2 of ISO/IEC 18013-1 (ISO compliant driving license).[23]\n\nInformation about scams\n\nInternational Driver's License at Snopes — more information about IDP scams or so-called \"International Driver's License\" scams\n\nWilliam Scott Dion, et al. — U.S. Federal Trade Commission press release about legal action against PT Resource Center for selling bogus IDP's and related identification documents\n\nCopies of treaties"
