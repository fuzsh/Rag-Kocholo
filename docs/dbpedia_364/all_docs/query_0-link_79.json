        "text": "With a sunny climate, historic towns and the freedom of the open road to enjoy, driving in Spain has a lot going for it. But if you’re planning a trip, it’s essential you’re fully prepared ahead of time as driving there is different to the UK.\n\nTo make your trip to the Continent as safe and effortless as possible, we’ve put together a guide to everything you need to know before you go, from required documents to rules of the road.\n\nRAC European Breakdown Cover (Basic and Comprehensive) provides a wide range of benefits should you breakdown in Spain to ensure you stay safe.\n\nNeed cover for the UK leg of your trip? Get complete peace of mind at home or at the roadside with RAC breakdown cover.\n\nTo supplement this, RAC also offers travel insurance. Cover will include medical expenses, baggage, personal money and belongings, among many other benefits.\n\nNeed insurance for your road trip? Our temporary car insurance product is perfect if you're looking for flexible and comprehensive cover for between 1 hour and 30 days\n\nVehicles from the UK can be temporarily imported into Spain for up to six months in any period of 12 months. In order to stay on the right side of the law, the following documents should always be carried:\n\nFull, valid UK driving licence\n\nProof of ID (passport)\n\nMotor insurance certificate\n\nV5 registration document\n\nDo I need a GB or UK sticker for driving in Spain?\n\nFrom 28th September 2021, the distinguishing mark (or national identifier) displayed on vehicles registered in the United Kingdom that are driven abroad has changed from GB to UK.\n\nThis means that vehicles registered in the UK must display the letters “UK” when driven in Spain.\n\nIn Spain, the sticker must be visible no matter what is on your number plate.\n\nDo I need an insurance green card?\n\nFollowing 2nd August 2021, drivers no longer require an insurance green card for taking their vehicles to Spain.\n\nDriving licence laws\n\nVisitors must be aged 18 or over and hold a full, valid driving licence to legally drive in Spain. Riders of motorcycles up to 125cc must be aged 16 or over.\n\nSpanish low emission zones – do I need a sticker?\n\nSpanish motoring authorities in Madrid and Barcelona require nationals to have an official sticker on the rear window of a vehicle indicating its emission levels.\n\nHowever, foreign vehicles do not need Spanish Low Emission Zone Stickers.\n\nETIAS – 2025\n\nETIAS stands for the European Travel Information and Authorisation System. It is a visa program for visitors who don’t need a Schengen visa, who want to travel to the European Union and a few other European countries.\n\nVisitors who purchase an ETIAS will be able to enter the 26 member states of the Schengen Zone as well as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania.\n\nThis will be launching in 2025. Learn more about ETIAS here.\n\nOvertaking and passing: In Spain, motorists drive on the right and overtake on the left. Vehicles exceeding 10 metres in length and exceeding 3.5 tonnes must keep a distance of at least 50m with the vehicle in front. The exception to the rule is in built-up areas, on roads where overtaking is prohibited and when there are several lanes in the same direction, or when the traffic is so heavy that it is not possible to overtake another vehicle.\n\nWho has priority?: As a general rule, drivers approaching an intersection must give way to all vehicles coming from the right. At a roundabout, drivers already on the roundabout have priority over drivers approaching the roundabout. Drivers on secondary roads must give way to vehicles coming from either direction when entering a main road. Emergency vehicles and vehicles on rails have priority over other road users.\n\nWarning of approach: Unnecessary use of horns is forbidden. In urban areas, sounding the horn is not allowed at any time, except in an emergency. If you need to give a warning, flash your lights instead.\n\nSeat belts\n\nIt’s compulsory to wear seat belts in the front and rear seats of cars equipped with belts.\n\nThe fine for failing to wear a seat belt is set at €200.\n\nTraffic lights\n\nThe international three-colour traffic light system is used in Spain.\n\nGreen, amber and red arrows are used at some intersections.\n\nThe Cross-Border Enforcement Directive\n\nAn EU cross-border directive came into effect in the UK in May 2017. This is aimed at tracking down people who commit traffic offences in cars that are registered in an EU member state different to where the offence was committed.\n\nThis means if you commit a driving offence abroad, the crime will effectively follow you back home to the UK where you can still be prosecuted.\n\nSpeeding fines in Spain range from €100 to €500 depending on the speed at which offenders are caught, or the road on which they’re driving.\n\nSomeone caught exceeding the limit by 60km/h or more could have their licence suspended for up to four years.\n\nSpeed camera detectors\n\nIn Spain, you’re still allowed to use a GPS navigation system that shows you where fixed speed cameras are. However, it's illegal to carry or use any radar jammer equipment when driving.\n\nThe driver of the vehicle is responsible for ensuring that all passengers under 18 are wearing a seat belt or appropriate restraint.\n\nCar seats\n\nChildren up to the age of 12 and measuring less than 135cm travelling on the front seat of a car must be seated in a child restraint system adapted to their size and weight. Children measuring more than 135cm may use an adult seat belt.\n\nChildren measuring less than 135cm travelling on the rear seat must also be placed in a child restraint system adapted to their size and weight.\n\nIn vehicles with more than nine seats, passengers over three years old (except those measuring less than 135 cm) must use seat belts if they are installed.\n\nBike helmet law\n\nIt is compulsory for cyclists under the age of 16 to wear a helmet.\n\nIt’s also mandatory for all cyclists, whatever their age, to wear a safety helmet on all roads outside built-up areas, except on a long steep hill or in very hot weather.\n\nCamper vans and cars with caravans are not allowed to exceed 18.75 metres in length, 4 metres in height and 2.55 metres in width.\n\nOn camper vans or cars with caravans exceeding 12 metres in length, there must be one long or two short reflectors at the rear.\n\nLoads mustn’t exceed 10 tonnes at a single axle but may exceed the length of the vehicle at the rear by up to 10% of its length. This should be indicated by a panel with diagonal red and white stripes.\n\nPlease note: The Department for Transport advises that A-frames are not legal for use by UK campers and caravanners abroad. In practice, this could mean towing your car while it’s fixed to a trailer.*\n\nTowing\n\nOn camper vans or cars with caravans exceeding 12 metres in length, there must be one long or two short reflectors at the rear. This applies to vehicles registered abroad as well as those in Spain. The reflectors can be obtained from car accessory shops.\n\nOn-the-spot fines\n\nPolice can impose fines on the spot. Fines may be reduced by 50% if paid within 20 days. A fine can be contested within 15 days.\n\nVisiting motorists must pay their fines immediately unless they give the name of a person or corporation in Spain willing to guarantee payment of the fine. Otherwise the vehicle will be confiscated until the fine is paid. They can then contest the fine through the legal system.\n\nMinimum and maximum fines\n\nFines range from €100 for a minor speeding offence to €6,000 for driving a vehicle with a radar jammer.\n\nSome motoring offences are considered criminal offences and can lead to much higher fines, as well as vehicle confiscation and a possible prison sentence.\n\nConfiscation of vehicles\n\nA vehicle can be confiscated for the following reasons:\n\nMechanical defects\n\nExcess noise or pollution\n\nLack of insurance\n\nThe driver refuses to pay a fine\n\nThe driver is under the influence of alcohol\n\nLike other central European countries, Spain has motorways with tolls. You can pay for them with cash or a credit card.\n\nMost motorways also have an electronic system of payment known as Telepeaje or Via T, which allows you to travel without stopping at toll booths.\n\nSpanish service areas\n\nThere are many service areas along the Spanish motorways.\n\nAvailability of fuel in Spain\n\nDifferent types of clean fuel are available in Spain. LPG is available under the name ‘Autogas’.\n\nAutomatic petrol pumps are found in some large towns.\n\nFuel prices in Spain can be found in our up-to-date European fuel prices page.\n\nIf you are planning on driving to Spain, be sure to pick up a European Driving Kit from the RAC Shop, containing everything you need to keep safe on your travels,\n\nNot all of the information in the guide above will be relevant to those looking to rent a hire car in Spain. Though it might be a good idea to read through everything anyway, here are the most important things to know for drivers of rental vehicles:\n\nRental information\n\nThe minimum age to hire a car is 21, although this may vary depending on the vehicle type\n\nYou need a full, valid UK driving licence and usually a second proof of ID (passport)\n\nCar rental companies ask that you have held your licence for a minimum term of 1 year\n\nSome companies may require you to use a credit card for deposit\n\nYou may not be able to drive outside of Spain unless planned in advance - check with your hire company first\n\nMake sure you get car hire excess insurance before your trip to protect yourself from unexpected costs. It's almost always cheaper to do this with a separate insurer and in advance\n\nHire car driving tips\n\nThe Spanish drive on the right - the opposite to the UK\n\nThe national speed limit on motorways in Spain, unless otherwise indicated on local signage, is between 100km/h (62mph) and 120km/h (80 mph). On a main road outside a built-up area it's 90 km/h. For built-up areas it’s 50km/h.\n\nDial 112 in an emergency\n\nIf seat belts are fitted to your car, they must be worn by both drivers and passengers.\n\nThe blood alcohol content limit for drivers of private vehicles is 0.05%. That's lower than the 0.08% in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but the same as Scotland."
