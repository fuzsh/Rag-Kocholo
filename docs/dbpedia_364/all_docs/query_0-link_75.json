        "text": "Are you planning a road trip to Valencia? Nestled along the east coast of Spain, the captivating region is full of excitement, culture, history, golden beaches, and beautiful architecture. From the famous Xàtiva Castle to Malvarrosa Beach, there’s so much to explore. The best way to get a sense of Valencian life, experience the rich culture, and see the fascinating sites, is to hit the road. There are few feelings more freeing than winding through mountainous regions and cruising down coastal roads. Not only will Holiday Cars provide you with the perfect vehicle for your journey, but we’ll also give you the rundown on driving in Valencia. Here is your guide to everything you need to know before you hit the road: from the rules of the road to required documents\n\nHow to Plan Your Route and Avoid Traffic in Valencia\n\nDriving Rules and Regulations in Spain\n\nDriving in Spain is a joy, with gorgeous vistas aplenty, but there are some things to look out for. It’s important that you are fully prepared for driving in Spain and are aware of the local rules and regulations.\n\nGeneral rules and regulations:\n\nThe minimum age to hire a car in Spain is 21.\n\nIf in an emergency, dial 112.\n\nYou can hire a car in Spain with a driving licence issued in the UK, EU, and EEA countries.\n\nYou must have had your driving licence for over one year to hire a car in Spain.\n\nAlways carry your full, valid UK driving licence and passport when driving a hire car in Spain.\n\nIn Spain, drive on the right and overtake on the left.\n\nAvoid the unnecessary use of the car horn. If you need to give a warning, flicker your headlights instead.\n\nVehicles weighing over 3.5 tonnes and higher than 10 metres must stay at least 50 metres from the vehicle in the front. This doesn’t apply if you’re in traffic, though.\n\nWearing seat belts is compulsory and the fine for not wearing a seat belt is €200.\n\nChildren under the age of 12 should not sit in the front seat.\n\nIt’s commonplace in Spain for the car hire company to hand over the vehicle with a full tank of petrol. However, they will take €80 - €90 from your credit card to account for that. If you return the vehicle with a full tank, then they’ll refund you. If it’s partially full, then they’ll issue a partial refund depending on how much is left.\n\nSpeed limits in Spain:\n\nSpain’s speed limits and other road signs are presented in kilometres and metres.\n\nResidential areas: 20km/h\n\nBuilt-up areas: 50km/h\n\nOutside built-up areas: 90km/h - 100km/h\n\nMotorways: 120km/h\n\nYou can exceed the limit by 20km/h in outside built-up areas to overtake a slower vehicle, but not on motorways or dual carriageways. As always, use your judgement before speeding up to overtake.\n\nIf you exceed the speeding limit, you will be fined between €100 and €500. The amount depends on the speed.\n\nHow to navigate toll roads in Spain:\n\nThere is a huge motorway network in Spain, and 30% of those motorways are also toll roads. Autopistas are the motorways that often have tolls, while autovistas are untolled. You’ll see a blue motorway sign labelled ‘AP’ when you approach the motorway, so you know you can expect a toll. You can try and avoid the toll roads, but it’ll take longer to reach your destination. And with the amount of extra petrol you will end up using, you might end up spending more money.\n\nThe price of the toll will depend on the type of vehicle you’re driving and the distance you’re travelling. Not all toll stations are operated by the same company, so the prices will differ. However, it is usually around €9.50 per 100 km. You will see a sign indicating the toll costs for the type of vehicle you are driving.\n\nMost toll stations have manned booths where you can pay with cash and speak to an employee. You can also pay by card at some toll booths. However, most toll roads have an electronic payment system —Via T or Telepeaje. Sign up for these applications before you begin your journey and register your credit card to your account. When you approach a toll barrier, your vehicle will be recognised, the light will go green, and you can drive ahead.\n\nThere are lots of historical sights, mountainous towns, and coastal cities to discover in the Valencia region. When you leave the city, keep an eye out for the AP-7 toll road. You will have to pay to drive on it, but it’s a fast way of reaching your destination.\n\nTips for driving in Valencia:\n\nNavigation: Valencia is a beautiful, historical city, with old cobblestone streets. While this makes exploring on foot wonderful, it can be tricky when driving. The road network is intricately made up of one-way streets, narrow streets, and pedestrianised streets. The roads are also not well signposted. Avoid getting a fine, adding time onto your journey, or getting lost by using a GPS maps application on your smartphone or a satnav.\n\nRush hours: While most places around the world will have two rush hours – before and after work – Valencia has four. The lunchtime break, or fiesta, adds two more rush hours. It also extends the final rush hour, as the work day can end longer for people who take a long lunchtime break. The first rush hour is between 8am and 9.30am, the second is between 12.30pm and 1.30pm, the third is between 2.30pm and 4pm, and the fourth is between 6pm and 8.30pm. While this takes up most of the day, the quietest time on the roads is usually between 3pm and 5pm.\n\nAlcohol driving limit: There are many beautiful vineyards around Valencia, but make sure you have a designated driver if you want a tipple. The Spanish legal alcohol limit is 0.03% for drivers who have been on the road for less than two years and 0.05% for experienced drivers. It’s much lower than the UK alcohol driving limit, so don’t risk it and ensure that someone in your group is safe to drive.\n\nVehicle type: Some Valencia road trippers swear by small cars to zip around the cities, towns, and wide-stretching highways. However, the type of vehicle you hire will depend on the type of trip you’re taking. If you’re planning on exploring the wider Valencia region and driving to Granada or Malaga, a big car would be a better fit for the winding mountain roads.\n\nParking Options and Tips in Valencia\n\nParking in Spain:\n\nIf parking on a two-way street, vehicles must be parked on the right-hand side.\n\nLook out for road signs that indicate whether parking must be paid for or is completely restricted. There will be automatic machines or parking metres nearby to pay for your parking spot.\n\nIllegally parked vehicles may be towed away. If your vehicle is towed, you will need to go to the nearest police station to pay the fine. You might also have to pay for towing costs to get the vehicle back.\n\nParking in Valencia:\n\nWhile cities tend to be tough places to find parking, Valencia is the opposite. The city has an incredible underground infrastructure specifically for parking. There are few things more frustrating than driving around one-way streets trying to find parking, so parking in one of the city’s underground spaces is the best option. Most underground car parks will charge around €2.50 per hour. Alternatively, you can book a weekend or monthly slot – not only does this save you money, but it also guarantees your space for the designated amount of time. There is a high concentration of underground car parks near Valencia Joaquín Sorolla (the main train station) and alongside the Turia River Bed Park.\n\nCar Hire Services and Prices in Valencia\n\nIf you’re arriving at Valencia Airport, you’ll find a wide range of car hire services. Alternatively, you can pick up your hire car from the city centre. There is a handful of car hire agencies dotted around the city, with a high concentration near Valencia Joaquín Sorolla Station. You’ll find big-name brands here, including Enterprise and Sixt. Compare prices online and pre-book your chosen car for the best prices.\n\nCar hire in Valencia might be more affordable than you think, especially when you know where to look. An economy car, like a Fiat 500, will zip you around the region with ease – prices start at just £5.50 per day with Holiday Cars. If you want a more spacious car to accommodate the family, like a Volkswagen T-Cross, you can search for SUVs on Holiday Cars – prices start at £6.70 per day.\n\nValencia Airport and Car Hire Facilities\n\nValencia Airport is around 5 miles from Valencia City Centre, in Manises. It’s a relatively straightforward route, taking an average of 15 minutes. There is regular public transport that takes you into the city, but there are fewer car hire facilities. If you’re planning a road trip in Valencia, the best place to pick up your car is at Valencia Airport. There’s a wide range of car hire vendors, from local companies to international brands – compare prices on HolidayCars.com and pre-book your vehicle for fantastic deals."
