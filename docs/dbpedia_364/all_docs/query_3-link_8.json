        "text": "I happened across this interesting article at The Economist, of all places, which speaks of this exact phenomenon, and notes that adverbs in adjective form have been around in English forever.\n\nThat article notes that there may be a subtle difference in meaning between \"safe\" and \"safely,\" and I tend to agree. \"Drive safely\" more specifically refers to driving in a safe manner. \"Drive safe\" emphasizes the end result, being unharmed when you stop driving.\n\nI'm often critical of poor grammatical constructions, but in this case, I think this is an acceptable phrase and does have a slightly different meaning or tone than \"drive safely.\"\n\n\"Do good\" has the unspoken meaning \"Do good (things)\" and generally refers to acting in a benevolent manner. If you mean to complete a task or test acceptably, you should say \"Do well.\"\n\nIn British English the correct usage is to use the adverbial form to modify a verb.\n\nIf someone wrote “we drove safe from London to Edinburgh” I would edit it to “safely”, first making sure that they had not stolen a safe and mistakenly omitted the definite article. No doubt there are those who would argue hotly (argue hot? Don't make me laugh!) that this is a silly old anachronism, but the use of the adjective as an adverb in the UK is likely to be lazy, sloppily informal or just plain wrong. But be careful! Some words act equally well as adverb and adjective, as in: “I am thinking straight”. And do not be misled by “we arrived safe” because safe in that sentence describes our state (safe, adjective) on arrival, not the manner (safely, adverb) of our arriving.\n\nThere is a Merriam-Webster Dictionary video from the editor about this exact topic. In it \"safe\" in \"drive safe\" is classed as a \"flat adverb\". The editor's opinion is they used to be more common in the past, but that prescriptivist grammarians from the 18th century considered them to be a mistake, which is the possible reason for their decline. The video gives examples of some that are still to a greater or lesser extent acceptably used today:\n\nslow (go slow)\n\nbright (shines bright)\n\nfast (time passes so fast)\n\n(notice that we nearly never say time passes so fastly)\n\nHere is a link to the video.\n\nAccordingly, Merriam-Webster licenses the adverbial usage of 'safe':\n\nsafe [adverb]: variant of safely\n\nAnd in a corresponding article:\n\nWhat to Know\n\nBoth 'drive safe' and 'drive safely' are fine to use. Flat adverbs – adverbs without -ly – are common in English....\n\nBut should they [be]? In fact, the adverb 'safe' is what's called a flat adverb. That is, it's an adverb that has the same form as its related adjective – like 'safe' in 'drive safe', 'slow' in 'go slow', or 'easy' in 'take it easy'.\n\nFlat Adverbs\n\nFlat adverbs used to be much more common than they are now. In Robinson Crusoe, Daniel Defoe described weather that was 'violent hot'. In his famous diary, the English writer Samuel Pepys wrote that he was 'horrid angry'. But most of these adverbs have long since been abandoned. In Middle English, adverbs like these had case endings that distinguished them from their related adjectives, but those gradually disappeared. Eighteenth-century grammarians didn't even identify flat adverbs as adverbs; they considered them adjectives and the adverbial use to be a mistake.\n\nIt's these eighteenth-century grammarians that we have to thank for the still-repeated injunction that adverbs end in -ly – and for the sad lack of flat adverbs today. We still have some, but most of them compete with an -ly form: there's 'slow' and 'slowly', 'safe' and 'safely', 'bright' and 'brightly'. But then we have 'tight' and 'tightly', with 'tight' used in a few places 'tightly' is not: 'sit tight', 'sleep tight'....\n\nThis argument about what is grammatically correct about \"drive safe\" and \"drive safely\" seems to run on and on. Some people quote native speakers say \"drive safe\". To me it depends on which country you are native of.\n\nI learned my English at the knee of my parents both of which were of British heritage and consequently the use of the adverb as \"drive safely\" is clearly the grammatically correct usage. The English language has been influenced in many countries by people who learned the language as a second language, and consequently do not necessarily get the grammar totally correct. \"Drive safe\" may have become acceptable in common usage, but that does not make it grammatically correct.\n\nMany hockey players say \"he played awesome.\" Is the song titled awesome or did the speaker mean he played in a way that was awesome?\n\nSpeaking of the word awesome, the meaning has clearly changed over the years. That's why you don't hear many older people using the word awesome. Does the event really cause you to go into a state of awe?\n\nSimilarly younger people use the word amazed in a new and different way than what it used to be used. Everything is amazing these days. It was an amazing sunrise! It was an amazing steak. How many sunrises do you have to see before they become less than amazing? Really are most of us amazed by a sunrise? It happens many mornings.\n\nSimilarly I find it difficult to be amazed by a steak. There are excellent steaks, and poor steaks, and tough steaks and burnt steaks, but are there really amazing steaks.\n\nThe new words that keep appearing in the English dictionary are there because the language is changing through usage. Quite often incorrect usage, but if used enough it become acceptable."
