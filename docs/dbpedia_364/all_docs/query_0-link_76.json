        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhether you are thinking of moving to Spain or you are already resident in the country this guide will help you understand the basic requirements of driving in Spain.\n\nGetting started – helpful background information\n\nWhich Spanish government department is responsible for matters related to driving in Spain?\n\nThe Direción General de Tráfico, known as the DGT, is the responsible body. Its website describes the full range of its remit and is available in English: here\n\nThe DGT covers everything from driving tests to licences, vehicle registration and fines for traffic offences.\n\nWhat do I do if I need to learn to drive or prepare for the Spanish driving test?\n\nThe role of driving schools in Spain\n\nIn Spain you must use a properly registered driving school. The school can teach you to drive if you have never driven, or introduce you to driving on Spanish roads if you are already a driver, and will prepare you for the theory and practical tests. Whilst it is possible to arrange the theory test yourself this is not an easy process and since you must use the dual control car of the driving school for the practical test, it is simpler to have the school arrange the complete driving test. See here\n\nHow long can I drive in Spain with my existing licence issued in another country?\n\nI have an EU licence\n\nIf you have an EU licence you may use it to drive in Spain for as long as it is current although you may choose to exchange it for a Spanish licence. If you are resident in Spain and you lose your licence or it is stolen or defaced you need to get a renewal/replacement Spanish licence. You do not need to take a test. If the driving licence has an indefinite period of validity (no expiry date), or is valid more than 15 years for group 1 (AM, A1, A2, A, B and BE), or more than five years for group 2 (C1, C1E, C, CE, D1, D1E, D and DE), you must renew it two years after being granted residence in Spain.See: here\n\nMy licence is not an EU licenceIf your licence is not an EU licence - including those from the USA, Canada and Australia you may legally drive in Spain with that licence for up to six months, so long as it is valid. Thereafter, you have to have acquired a new Spanish driving licence by taking the Spanish driving test (theory and practical) - unless there is an exchange agreement such as exists between Spain and some South American countries and (since March 16 2023) the UK:\n\nSee: here\n\nMy licence is from the UK\n\nHolders of a current UK licence (that has not expired) are now able to exchange their UK licence for a Spanish one without having to take a Spanish driving test. And, for six months, UK licence holders can legally drive again on their valid UK licence whilst they complete the exchange process.\n\nThe Dirección General de Tráfico has updated its website with detailed information on the exchange process: here\n\nand you can also find information on gov.uk/livinginspain. Make sure you have the correct documentation with you when you go to your appointment, so do read that section carefully.\n\nWhen you enter the system to book your appointment, you should choose the option \"Tramites de Oficina\" (not Canjes) and then \"Conductores\".\n\nPlease note - the rule of people aged over 65 not needing a prior appointment does not apply to Driving License exchanges.\n\nIf your original licence is not from the UK, and you exchanged it for a UK licence, you will only be able to exchange your current UK licence if there is an exchange agreement between your original country and Spain. For example, if you took your test in Australia and then exchanged your Australian licence for a UK licence, you will not be able to exchange your UK licence for a Spanish one. You will have to take the full Spanish driving test. See here\n\nDuplicate Spanish License\n\nIf you need to request a duplicate of your Spanish Driving License due to loss, deterioration or change of data you can find details of the procedures on the DGT website here.\n\nYou can apply online if you have a Digital Certificate, or in person at the DGT offices.\n\nIf your license was valid then you can request a duplicate. If it had expired then you will need to request a renewal. You will be issued with a temporary permit whilst waiting for the duplicate so you can continue to drive in Spain. Please be aware that the temporary permits are not always acceptable to drive in other countries so ensure you time the replacement if your are travelling abroad. It can take up to a month for the procedure to be complete.\n\nWhat if I want to buy, hire or borrow a car in Spain? - The driving licence requirement.\n\nIf you are from a non-EU country, living in Spain, you may drive a Spanish car on the licence issued in your home country for up to 6 months from the date your TIE (Foreigners Identity Card) states your residency starts. You must then exchange this for a Spanish licence or, if you are not eligible to do this, you must sit a Spanish driving test. This applies whether you buy, hire, or borrow a car.\n\nIf you are driving on an EU licence issued in another country, you may drive a Spanish car on your licence for as long as it is valid.\n\nCan I bring my car to Spain when I move?\n\nDifferent rules apply depending on whether you intend to bring a car registered in an EU country or a non-EU country. However, vehicles in both categories brought into Spain must be registered with the Spanish authorities within six months of entry into the country, when they will be issued with Spanish plates. It is illegal to drive a vehicle without Spanish plates after six months.\n\nBringing a car from an EU country into Spain is relatively straightforward. However, the vehicle still has to be proved roadworthy, be registered and be fitted with Spanish plates within the time limit.\n\nBringing a car from a country outside the EU is more complex. If contemplating doing this you should check the position regarding the import duty and taxes which may be payable.\n\nIf you do import a car to Spain and it is four years old or more, it will require an\n\nInspecciòn Tècnica de Vehiculos or ITV test See here\n\nThis is a test to ensure that your vehicle is roadworthy and is compulsory for vehicles over four years old.\n\nThe test must be carried out at an authorised ITV testing station and for this test you will need to produce the following documents:\n\nProof of vehicle ownership\n\nProof of payment of fees and taxes\n\nDriving license of the owner\n\nVehicle insurance policy\n\nVehicle data record\n\nTo find an ITV testing station see here\n\nRegistering your vehicle and changing the number plates\n\nOnce your vehicle has passed the ITV test, if this was needed, it must be registered, and the number plates changed to Spanish ones.\n\nIf the vehicle is from a country within the EU: here\n\nIf the vehicle is from a country outside the EU: here\n\nIn order to register your car, you need to make an appointment at your local DGT office (Directorate-General for Traffic). Find your local office: here\n\nHere you will need to:\n\nFill out Modelo or Form 567 and pay registration tax on foreign vehicles\n\nPay the Impuesto de Circulación or circulation tax, which is set by your local Town Hall\n\nThe documents you need for the process are:\n\nA completed application form to change the plates.\n\nYour NIE number, TIE and proof of address.\n\nAn original and a photocopy of the proof of payment of the registration tax and circulation tax.\n\nAn invoice for the purchase of the vehicle.\n\nProof of payment of VAT in the country of origin of the vehicle.\n\nThe Certificate of Conformity – issued by the car manufacturer, see section 3 in the story which follows.\n\nAfter all this has been done, and you have paid for car insurance, your car has been legally imported, registered in Spain, and is ready to drive.\n\nUsing a professional adviser to assist with the process\n\nMany people ask a lawyer or gestor to help with these processes. See here\n\nIt is possible to manage the process yourself, without engaging a professional. Read this personal story from Al Herrera who lives in Barcelona,to find out how he did it step by step:\n\nI’m moving to Spain and I want to drive - what do I do now?\n\nResidency\n\nYou need to be aware of all residency requirements before you come to Spain. You can find everything you need to get you started here\n\nPlease note that unless you are an EU national or you have the right to residency under the the UK/Spain Withdrawal Agreement (i.e. you were legally living in Spain before 2021 and you still live in Spain), if you are planning to live in Spain for longer than 90 days in any 180 day period you MUST apply for a visa before you arrive in Spain. You MUST do this at the Spanish Consulate in your home country.\n\nIf you are an EU national and you have a valid EU driving licence, you can drive in Spain.\n\nIf your licence is from a country that has an exchange agreement with Spain (this now includes the UK), you can drive on your licence for up to 6 months, then you have to have exchanged your licence for a Spanish one in order to continue to drive legally after 6 months.\n\nFor everyone else, you need to:\n\n1. Acquire the TIE card – the Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero – Identity Card for Foreigners\n\nThis card is essential if you wish to drive in Spain or to sit the Spanish driving test. You must apply for this identity card within one month of arriving in Spain: see the Age in Spain guide on getting a TIE\n\n2. Take the Spanish driving test (if your licence is not from the EU or you are not eligible to exchange your current licence)\n\nThe Spanish Driving Test\n\nWhat does it consist of?\n\nThere are three steps, taken in this order:\n\nA medical examination\n\nA theory test\n\nA practical driving test\n\nHow do I prepare for the Spanish Driving Test?\n\nEnrol with a driving school in your area and arrange to have the medical examination with your family doctor.\n\nCan I take lessons and the test in English?\n\nMany driving schools offer lessons in English. The theory test, which is a multiple choice format, can be done in English or Spanish and resources are available in both languages – see below.\n\nThe practical Driving Test will be conducted in Spanish.\n\nHow do I prepare for the Theory Test?\n\nThe driving school will guide you and provide some resources for you to study. You may also do ‘practice exams’ online in English: See here\n\nWhen should I take the Theory Test?\n\nAgree with the school when you are ‘ready’ to take the real exam. The school will arrange dates, fees, and advise you on how to prepare for the test - for example mobile phones are not permitted and you should take two pens.\n\nWhen do I find out the result of the Theory Test?\n\nTest results are available next working day on the DGT website – you must achieve a mark of at least 27 out of 30 to pass.\n\nWhat happens if I fail the Theory Test?\n\nYou may resit it until you achieve a pass!\n\nHow do I prepare for the Practical Driving Test?\n\nArrange an initial lesson with the school so they can assess how your driving fits with Spanish requirements.\n\nTake driving lessons as appropriate, including learning a dozen or so Spanish instructions for the Practical Test.\n\nPlease note that your lessons may include having other students in the car and you may take it in turns to drive.\n\nAgree with the instructor when you are ‘ready’ to take the real test and the school will arrange this and advise you on how to prepare for the test.\n\nWhat happens on the day of the Driving Test?\n\nIn the car as well as yourself will be the driving examiner and your instructor. You will take the test in the school’s dual control car.\n\nThe result is usually given on the same day.\n\nYou will be advised of the website where you can access your temporary licence, which covers you until the plastic licence arrives by post. This will show the date you passed class B and the date to which it is valid.\n\nL plate\n\nAfter passing your Spanish practical test you will be given an L plate (white on a green background) which must be clearly displayed on the left rear side of any vehicle you are driving for 12 months from the date of your new licence. It is a fineable offence not to display it when driving during this period. It is also an offence if you do not remove it after 12 months, and/or when any other driver uses the vehicle (unless they too are a new driver and are required to display it)\n\nWhat are the penalties for driving infringements in Spain?\n\nIn Spain points are deducted, not added!\n\nNew drivers have 8 points on their licence which rises to a maximum of 12 after three years. Points are deducted depending on the seriousness of the infringement.\n\nThe DGT website describes the different categories of infringement and the penalties which may be imposed: See here\n\nThe teacher becomes the pupil - A personal story from Ruth Collins\n\nRuth Collins was a driving instructor in the UK. Newly arrived in Spain, she is preparing to take the Spanish driving test. Here, she shares some insights into the process and describes some of the differences between driving in the UK and driving in Spain.\n\nWith many thanks to Ruth Baldasera for her assistance in preparing this Guide.\n\nBefore you go!
