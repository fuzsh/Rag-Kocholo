        "text": "To pass the road test portion of the CDL driving performance evaluation (DPE), you must make no more than 30 errors and no critical driving errors, which will result in an automatic failure. Interpreters are prohibited. The entire road test must be conducted in the English language, pursuant to CFR, Title 49 §§391.11(b)(2) and 383.133(c)(5). Technology, such as backup cameras and self-parking, cannot solely be used on a road test.\n\nIf you communicate in a language other than English, or fail to comprehend instructions given to you in English, during the skills tests (vehicle inspection, basic control skills, and road test), you will receive a verbal warning for the first 2 offenses committed on the same test date. Upon the third offense committed on the same test date, the test will end as an automatic failure.\n\nYou will drive over a test route that has a variety of traffic situations. At all times during the test, you must drive in a safe and responsible manner and:\n\nWear your safety belt.\n\nObey all traffic signs, signals, and laws.\n\nComplete the test without an accident or moving violation.\n\nDuring the driving test, the examiner will be scoring you on specific driving maneuvers as well as on your gen-eral driving behavior. You will follow the directions of the examiner. Directions will be given to you so you will have plenty of time to do what the examiner has asked. You will not be asked to drive in an unsafe manner.\n\nIf your test route does not have certain traffic situations, you may be asked to simulate a traffic situation. You will do this by telling the examiner what you are or would be doing if you were in that traffic situation.\n\nRemember: You are allowed a total of 3 attempts to pass the vehicle inspection test, basic control skills test, and road test.\n\nA driver must be tested in a truck or bus (as those terms are defined in CFR, Title 49 §390.5), or other single unit vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 or more, to satisfy the skills testing requirements for a Class B CDL.\n\n13.1 – How You Will Be Tested\n\n13.1.1 – Turns\n\nYou have been asked to make a turn:\n\nCheck for traffic in all directions.\n\nUse turn signals and safely get into the lane needed for the turn.\n\nAs you approach the turn:\n\nUse turn signals to warn others of your turn.\n\nSlow down smoothly, change gears as needed to keep power, but do not coast unsafely. Unsafe coasting occurs when your vehicle is out of gear (clutch depressed or gearshift in Neutral) for more than the length of your vehicle.\n\nIf you must stop before making the turn:\n\nCome to a smooth stop without skidding.\n\nCome to a complete stop behind the stop line, crosswalk, or stop sign.\n\nIf stopping behind another vehicle, stop where you can see the rear tires on the vehicle ahead of you (safe gap).\n\nDo not let your vehicle roll.\n\nKeep the front wheels aimed straight ahead.\n\nWhen ready to turn:\n\nCheck for traffic in all directions.\n\nKeep both hands on the steering wheel during the turn.\n\nKeep checking your mirror to make sure the vehicle does not hit anything on the inside of the turn.\n\nThe vehicle should not move into oncoming traffic.\n\nThe vehicle should finish the turn in the correct lane.\n\nAfter the turn:\n\nMake sure your turn signal is off.\n\nGet up to the speed of traffic, use your turn signal, and move into the right-most lane when safe to do so (if not already there).\n\nCheck your mirrors for traffic.\n\n13.1.2 – Intersections\n\nAs you approach an intersection:\n\nCheck for traffic thoroughly in all directions.\n\nDecelerate gently.\n\nBrake smoothly and, if necessary, change gears.\n\nIf necessary, come to a complete stop (no coasting) behind any stop signs, signals, sidewalks, or stop lines, and maintain a safe gap behind any vehicle in front of you.\n\nYour vehicle must not roll forward or backward.\n\nDo not enter the intersection if there is insufficient space to clear it.\n\nWhen driving through an intersection:\n\nCheck for traffic thoroughly in all directions.\n\nDecelerate and yield to any pedestrians and traffic in the intersection.\n\nDo not change lanes while proceeding through the intersection.\n\nKeep your hands on the wheel.\n\nOnce through the intersection:\n\nContinue checking your mirrors for traffic.\n\nAccelerate smoothly and change gears as necessary.\n\n13.1.3 – Urban Business\n\nDuring this part of the test, you are expected to make regular traffic checks and maintain a safe following dis-tance. Your vehicle should be centered in the proper lane (right-most lane) and you should keep up with the flow of traffic but not exceed the posted speed limit.\n\n13.1.4 – Lane Changes\n\nDuring multiple lane portions of the test, you will be asked to change lanes to the left, and then back to the right. You should make the necessary traffic checks first, use proper signals, wait for a safe gap before moving into a lane, and maintain a safe following distance.\n\n13.1.5 – Expressway/Highway\n\nBefore entering the expressway:\n\nCheck for traffic.\n\nUse the proper signals.\n\nMerge smoothly into the proper lane of traffic.\n\nOnce on the expressway:\n\nMaintain the proper lane positioning, vehicle spacing, and vehicle speed.\n\nContinue to check for traffic thoroughly in all directions.\n\nWhen exiting the expressway:\n\nMake the necessary traffic checks.\n\nUse the proper signals.\n\nDecelerate smoothly in the exit lane.\n\nOnce on the exit ramp, continue to decelerate within the lane markings, and maintain adequate spacing between your vehicle and other vehicles.\n\n13.1.6 – Stop/Start\n\nFor this maneuver, you will be asked to pull your vehicle over to the side of the road and stop as if you were going to get out and check something on your vehicle. You must check for traffic thoroughly in all directions and move to the right-most lane or shoulder of the road.\n\nAs you prepare for the stop:\n\nCheck for traffic.\n\nActivate your right turn signal.\n\nDecelerate smoothly, brake evenly, and change gears as necessary.\n\nBring your vehicle to a full stop without coasting.\n\nOnce stopped:\n\nThe vehicle must be parallel to the curb or shoulder of the road and safely out of the traffic flow.\n\nThe vehicle should not be blocking driveways, fire hydrants, intersections, signs, etc.\n\nCancel your turn signal.\n\nActivate your 4-way emergency flashers.\n\nApply the parking brake.\n\nMove the gear shift to Neutral or Park.\n\nRemove your feet from the brake and clutch pedals.\n\nWhen instructed to resume:\n\nCheck your mirrors thoroughly in all directions for traffic.\n\nTurn off your 4-way emergency flashers.\n\nActivate the left turn signal.\n\nWhen traffic permits, you should release the parking brake and pull straight ahead.\n\nDo not turn the wheel before your vehicle moves.\n\nCheck traffic from all directions, especially to the left.\n\nSteer and accelerate smoothly into the proper lane when safe to do so.\n\nOnce your vehicle is back into the flow of traffic, cancel your left turn signal.\n\n13.1.7 – Curve\n\nWhen approaching a curve:\n\nCheck for traffic thoroughly in all directions.\n\nBefore entering the curve, reduce your speed so further braking or shifting is not required in the curve.\n\nKeep your vehicle in the lane.\n\nContinue checking for traffic in all directions.\n\n13.1.8 – Railroad Crossing\n\nBefore reaching the crossing, all commercial drivers should:\n\nDecelerate, brake smoothly, and shift gears as necessary.\n\nLook and listen for the presence of trains.\n\nCheck for traffic in all directions.\n\nIf multiple lanes, keep vehicle in right most lane.\n\nNot stop, change gears, pass another vehicle, or change lanes while any part of your vehicle is in the crossing.\n\nIf you are driving a bus, school bus, or vehicle displaying placards, you should be prepared to observe the following procedures at every railroad crossing (unless the crossing is exempt):\n\nAs the vehicle approaches a railroad crossing, activate the 4-way emergency flashers.\n\nStop the vehicle within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail.\n\nListen and look in both directions along the track for an approaching train and for signals indicating the approach of a train. If operating a bus, you may also be required to open the window and door prior to crossing tracks.\n\nKeep both hands on the steering wheel as the vehicle crosses the tracks.\n\nDo not stop, change gears, or change lanes while any part of your vehicle is proceeding across the tracks.\n\n4-way emergency flashers should be deactivated after the vehicle crosses the tracks.\n\nContinue to check your mirrors for traffic.\n\nNot all driving road test routes will have a railroad crossing. You may be asked to explain and demonstrate the proper railroad crossing procedures to the examiner at a simulated location.\n\n13.1.9 – Bridge/Overpass/Sign\n\nAfter driving under an overpass, you may be asked to tell the examiner what the posted clearance or height was. After going over a bridge, you may be asked to tell the examiner what the posted weight limit was. If your test route does not have a bridge or overpass, you may be asked about another traffic sign. When asked, be prepared to identify and explain to the examiner any traffic sign that may appear on the route.\n\n13.1.10 – Student Discharge (School Bus)\n\nIf you are applying for a school bus endorsement, you will be required to demonstrate loading and unloading students. Please refer to Section 10 of this manual for procedures on loading and unloading school students.\n\n13.1.11 – General Driving Behaviors\n\nYou will be scored on your overall performance in the following general driving behavior categories:\n\nClutch Usage (for Manual Transmission)\n\n• Always use the clutch to shift.\n\n• If equipped with an unsynchronized manual transmission, you must double-clutch when shifting. Do not rev or lug the engine.\n\n• Do not ride the clutch to control speed, coast with the clutch depressed, or “pop” the clutch.\n\nGear Usage (for Manual Transmission)\n\n• Do not grind or clash the gears.\n\n• Select a gear that does not rev or lug engine.\n\n• Do not shift in turns and intersections.\n\nBrake Usage\n\n• Do not ride or pump the brake.\n\n• Do not brake harshly. Brake smoothly using steady pressure.\n\nLane Usage\n\n• Do not drive the vehicle over curbs, sidewalks, or lane markings.\n\n• Stop behind stop lines, crosswalks, or stop signs.\n\n• Complete a turn in the proper lane on a multiple lane road (the vehicle should finish a left turn in the lane directly to the right of the center line).\n\n• Finish a right turn in the right-most (curb) lane.\n\n• Move to or remain in the right-most lane unless the lane is blocked.\n\n13.1.12 – Steering\n\nDo not over or under steer the vehicle.\n\nKeep both hands on the steering wheel at all times unless shifting. Once you have completed shift, return both hands to the steering wheel.\n\n13.1.13 – Regular Traffic Checks\n\nCheck for traffic regularly.\n\nCheck your mirrors regularly.\n\nCheck your mirrors and for traffic before, while in, and after an intersection.\n\nScan and check for traffic in high volume areas and areas where pedestrians are expected to be present.\n\n13.1.14 – Use of Turn Signals"
