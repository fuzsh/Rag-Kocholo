        "text": "To legally drive a car in Canada, you’ll need a driver’s licence issued by the government of your province or territory. You must have it with you whenever you’re driving. With it, you can drive anywhere in Canada.\n\nIf you have a valid licence from your home country, you’ll probably be able to use this to drive in Canada for a short time after you arrive. Check with the government of your province or territory for details.\n\nIf you plan to use a foreign driver’s licence in Canada, you should get an International Driving Permit (IDP) in your home country. An IDP will give you a translation of your licence into French and English.\n\nThe process to get a driver’s licence in Canada depends on the province or territory where you live and on your driving background. It may include:\n\na written exam on the rules of the road (you can get a study guide to help with this)\n\none or two driving tests\n\nYou may choose to pay for driving lessons to get ready for the driving tests. Search online for lessons.\n\nOnce you have a licence, you will have to renew it every so often. The expiry date will be printed on your licence.\n\nSee the transportation department in your province or territory to find out more about driver’s licences, exams and driving lessons.\n\nAlberta\n\nBritish Columbia\n\nManitoba\n\nNew Brunswick\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador\n\nNorthwest Territories\n\nNova Scotia\n\nNunavut\n\nOntario\n\nPrince Edward Island\n\nQuebec\n\nSaskatchewan\n\nYukon\n\nYou can search the Internet or call the local transportation ministry in your city to find out about car dealers or car rental agencies.\n\nIf you only need a car for short periods, you can rent a car from a car rental agency. Make sure car insurance is included in your car rental agreement if you need it.\n\nIn some cities, there are car-sharing programs that let you use a car without buying, leasing or renting one. You may want to research this option to see if it meets your needs."
