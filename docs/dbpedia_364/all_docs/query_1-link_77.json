        "text": "The NVIDIA DRIVE Orin™ SoC (system-on-a-chip) delivers 254 TOPS (trillion operations per second) and is the central computer for intelligent vehicles. It’s the ideal solution for powering autonomous driving capabilities, confidence views, digital clusters, and AI cockpits. The DRIVE Orin product family lets developers build, scale, and leverage one development investment across an entire fleet, from Level 2+ systems all the way to Level 5 fully autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion™ reference architecture accelerates development, testing, and validation by integrating DRIVE Orin-based AI compute with a complete sensor suite. It includes 12 exterior cameras, three interior cameras, nine radars, one interior radar, 12 ultrasonics, one front-facing lidar, and one lidar for ground-truth data collection.\n\nThe foundation of the DRIVE software stack, DRIVE OS is the first safe operating system for in-vehicle accelerated computing. It includes NVIDIA® CUDA® libraries for efficient parallel computing implementations, NVIDIA TensorRT™ for real-time AI inference, and NvMedia for sensor input processing.\n\nNVIDIA DRIVE Chauffeur is an AI-assisted driving platform that can handle both highway and urban traffic with the utmost safety. It can use the high-performance compute and sensor set of NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion to drive from address to address. For those who want to drive, the system also provides active safety features and the ability to intervene in dangerous scenarios."
