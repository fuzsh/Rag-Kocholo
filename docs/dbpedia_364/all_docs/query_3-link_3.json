        "text": "I love that it’s so positive. It's just that sense of freshness, and discovering what treasures I’m going to find within the pages. I love that about opening the magazine and thinking ‘What am I going to learn? What am I going to take away from this? What's going to entertain me?’ It inspires me. That's what I love about Prima.\n\nSusanna Reid, Good Morning Britain Presenter\n\nI like to brush up on fashion. I'm known for my jackets and sometimes clothing that's a bit different, so I'll always look out for Esquire to see what's going to be hot around town. I'm not sure striped blazers are really designed for what I put them through when crowd-surfing, but that's rock 'n' roll. Esquire is a top read - not too snotty, yet big on style and nicely written in a way that makes you smile. Like an 'in gag'.\n\nRicky Wilson, Lead singer of Kaiser Chiefs\n\nWhen you're a designer you have to compartmentalise yourself ever so slightly into creating things in a certain way. They say you should never restrict how you go about things too much, but I think you need to give your work focus and make sure it goes in a certain direction, and that should be much the same in terms of the magazine you choose to read as well. For me, Elle Decoration takes design as being serene, classy, complete, warm and feminine. It's a beautiful magazine that works so hard to offer new ideas to readers, and I really appreciate that in a title.\n\nCath Kidston, Renowned designer\n\nI was a slave to the gym for so many months leading up to the filming of Southpaw. I basically lived and worked like a boxer – every single day. And to stay motivated I needed to read how the experts did it, so Men’s Health really kept me pumped and energetic, even at times when I felt I couldn’t go any further.\n\nJake Gyllenhall, Hollywood Actor\n\nRed has always been the go-to fashion, style and current affairs title for me. It's brave, uplifting and tackles some of the key things that matter to the modern woman. Really though, more than anything else, it's about being inspired by what's in front of you. The influences in Red come from the UK and overseas, but are presented in a way that make you want to go out and try new looks, sample new colours and fashions, and really explore fashion and style, no matter what the season.\n\nLouise Redknapp, Singer"
