        "text": "Publication 463 - Introductory Material\n\nFuture Developments\n\nFor the latest information about developments related to Pub. 463, such as legislation enacted after it was published, go to IRS.gov/Pub463.\n\nWhat's New\n\nStandard mileage rate. For 2023, the standard mileage rate for the cost of operating your car for business use is 65.5 cents ($0.655) per mile. Car expenses and use of the standard mileage rate are explained in chapter 4.\n\nDepreciation limits on cars, trucks, and vans. The first-year limit on the depreciation deduction, special depreciation allowance, and section 179 deduction for vehicles acquired before September 28, 2017, and placed in service during 2023, is $12,200. The first-year limit on depreciation, special depreciation allowance, and section 179 deduction for vehicles acquired after September 27, 2017, and placed in service during 2023 increases to $20,200. If you elect not to claim a special depreciation allowance for a vehicle placed in service in 2023, the amount increases to $12,200. Depreciation limits are explained in chapter 4.\n\nSection 179 deduction. The maximum amount you can elect to deduct for section 179 property (including cars, trucks, and vans) you placed in service in tax years beginning in 2023 is $1,160,000. This limit is reduced by the amount by which the cost of section 179 property placed in service during the tax year exceeds $2,890,000. Section 179 deduction is explained in chapter 4.Also, the maximum section 179 expense deduction for sport utility vehicles placed in service in tax years beginning in 2023 is $28,900.\n\nTemporary deduction of 100% business meals. The 100% deduction on certain business meals expenses as amended under the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020, and enacted by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, has expired. Generally, the cost of business meals remains deductible, subject to the 50% limitation. See 50% Limit in chapter 2 for more information.\n\nPhotographs of missing children. The IRS is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in this publication on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 800-THE-LOST (800-843-5678) if you recognize a child.\n\nPer diem rates. Current and prior per diem rates may be found on the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) website at GSA.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates.\n\nIntroduction\n\nYou may be able to deduct the ordinary and necessary business-related expenses you have for:\n\nTravel,\n\nNon-entertainment-related meals,\n\nGifts, or\n\nTransportation.\n\nAn ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your trade or business. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your business. An expense doesn’t have to be required to be considered necessary.\n\nThis publication explains:\n\nWhat expenses are deductible,\n\nHow to report them on your return,\n\nWhat records you need to prove your expenses, and\n\nHow to treat any expense reimbursements you may receive.\n\nWho should use this publication.\n\nYou should read this publication if you are an employee or a sole proprietor who has business-related travel, non-entertainment-related meals, gift, or transportation expenses.\n\nUsers of employer-provided vehicles.\n\nIf an employer-provided vehicle was available for your use, you received a fringe benefit. Generally, your employer must include the value of the use or availability of the vehicle in your income. However, there are exceptions if the use of the vehicle qualifies as a working condition fringe benefit (such as the use of a qualified nonpersonal use vehicle).\n\nA working condition fringe benefit is any property or service provided to you by your employer, the cost of which would be allowable as an employee business expense deduction if you had paid for it.\n\nA qualified nonpersonal use vehicle is one that isn’t likely to be used more than minimally for personal purposes because of its design. See Qualified nonpersonal use vehicles under Actual Car Expenses in chapter 4.\n\nFor information on how to report your car expenses that your employer didn’t provide or reimburse you for (such as when you pay for gas and maintenance for a car your employer provides), see Vehicle Provided by Your Employer in chapter 6.\n\nWho doesn’t need to use this publication.\n\nPartnerships, corporations, trusts, and employers who reimburse their employees for business expenses should refer to the instructions for their required tax forms, for information on deducting travel, meals, and entertainment expenses.\n\nIf you are an employee, you won’t need to read this publication if all of the following are true.\n\nYou fully accounted to your employer for your work-related expenses.\n\nYou received full reimbursement for your expenses.\n\nYour employer required you to return any excess reimbursement and you did so.\n\nThere is no amount shown with a code L in box 12 of your Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement.\n\nIf you meet all of these conditions, there is no need to show the expenses or the reimbursements on your return. If you would like more information on reimbursements and accounting to your employer, see chapter 6.\n\n. If you meet these conditions and your employer included reimbursements on your Form W-2 in error, ask your employer for a corrected Form W-2..\n\nVolunteers.\n\nIf you perform services as a volunteer worker for a qualified charity, you may be able to deduct some of your costs as a charitable contribution. See Out-of-Pocket Expenses in Giving Services in Pub. 526, Charitable Contributions, for information on the expenses you can deduct.\n\nComments and suggestions.\n\nWe welcome your comments about this publication and suggestions for future editions.\n\nYou can send us comments through IRS.gov/FormComments.

Travel\n\nIf you temporarily travel away from your tax home, you can use this chapter to determine if you have deductible travel expenses.\n\nThis chapter discusses:\n\nTraveling away from home,\n\nTemporary assignment or job, and\n\nWhat travel expenses are deductible.\n\nIt also discusses the standard meal allowance, rules for travel inside and outside the United States, luxury water travel, and deductible convention expenses.\n\nTravel expenses defined.\n\nFor tax purposes, travel expenses are the ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home for your business, profession, or job.\n\nAn ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your trade or business. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your business. An expense doesn’t have to be required to be considered necessary.\n\nYou will find examples of deductible travel expenses in Table 1-1 .\n\nTraveling Away From Home\n\nYou are traveling away from home if:\n\nYour duties require you to be away from the general area of your tax home (defined later) substantially longer than an ordinary day's work, and\n\nYou need to sleep or rest to meet the demands of your work while away from home.\n\nThis rest requirement isn’t satisfied by merely napping in your car. You don’t have to be away from your tax home for a whole day or from dusk to dawn as long as your relief from duty is long enough to get necessary sleep or rest.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou are a railroad conductor. You leave your home terminal on a regularly scheduled round-trip run between two cities and return home 16 hours later. During the run, you have 6 hours off at your turnaround point where you eat two meals and rent a hotel room to get necessary sleep before starting the return trip. You are considered to be away from home.\n\nExample 2.\n\nYou are a truck driver. You leave your terminal and return to it later the same day. You get an hour off at your turnaround point to eat. Because you aren’t off to get necessary sleep and the brief time off isn’t an adequate rest period, you aren’t traveling away from home.\n\nMembers of the Armed Forces.\n\nIf you are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces on a permanent duty assignment overseas, you aren’t traveling away from home. You can’t deduct your expenses for meals and lodging. You can’t deduct these expenses even if you have to maintain a home in the United States for your family members who aren’t allowed to accompany you overseas. If you are transferred from one permanent duty station to another, you may have deductible moving expenses, which are explained in Pub. 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide.\n\nA naval officer assigned to permanent duty aboard a ship that has regular eating and living facilities has a tax home (explained next) aboard the ship for travel expense purposes.\n\nTax Home\n\nTo determine whether you are traveling away from home, you must first determine the location of your tax home.\n\nGenerally, your tax home is your regular place of business or post of duty, regardless of where you maintain your family home. It includes the entire city or general area in which your business or work is located.\n\nIf you have more than one regular place of business, your tax home is your main place of business. See Main place of business or work, later.\n\nIf you don’t have a regular or a main place of business because of the nature of your work, then your tax home may be the place where you regularly live. See No main place of business or work, later.\n\nIf you don’t have a regular or main place of business or post of duty and there is no place where you regularly live, you are considered an itinerant (a transient) and your tax home is wherever you work. As an itinerant, you can’t claim a travel expense deduction because you are never considered to be traveling away from home.\n\nMain place of business or work.\n\nIf you have more than one place of work, consider the following when determining which one is your main place of business or work.\n\nThe total time you ordinarily spend in each place.\n\nThe level of your business activity in each place.\n\nWhether your income from each place is significant or insignificant.\n\nExample.\n\nYou live in Cincinnati where you have a seasonal job for 8 months each year and earn $40,000. You work the other 4 months in Miami, also at a seasonal job, and earn $15,000. Cincinnati is your main place of work because you spend most of your time there and earn most of your income there.\n\nNo main place of business or work.\n\nYou may have a tax home even if you don’t have a regular or main place of work. Your tax home may be the home where you regularly live.\n\nFactors used to determine tax home.\n\nIf you don’t have a regular or main place of business or work, use the following three factors to determine where your tax home is.\n\nYou perform part of your business in the area of your main home and use that home for lodging while doing business in the area.\n\nYou have living expenses at your main home that you duplicate because your business requires you to be away from that home.\n\nYou haven’t abandoned the area in which both your historical place of lodging and your claimed main home are located; you have a member or members of your family living at your main home; or you often use that home for lodging.\n\nIf you satisfy all three factors, your tax home is the home where you regularly live. If you satisfy only two factors, you may have a tax home depending on all the facts and circumstances. If you satisfy only one factor, you are an itinerant; your tax home is wherever you work and you can’t deduct travel expenses.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou are single and live in Boston in an apartment you rent. You have worked for your employer in Boston for a number of years. Your employer enrolls you in a 12-month executive training program. You don’t expect to return to work in Boston after you complete your training.\n\nDuring your training, you don’t do any work in Boston. Instead, you receive classroom and on-the-job training throughout the United States. You keep your apartment in Boston and return to it frequently. You use your apartment to conduct your personal business. You also keep up your community contacts in Boston. When you complete your training, you are transferred to Los Angeles.\n\nYou don’t satisfy factor (1) because you didn’t work in Boston. You satisfy factor (2) because you had duplicate living expenses. You also satisfy factor (3) because you didn’t abandon your apartment in Boston as your main home, you kept your community contacts, and you frequently returned to live in your apartment. Therefore, you have a tax home in Boston.\n\nExample 2.\n\nYou are an outside salesperson with a sales territory covering several states. Your employer's main office is in Newark, but you don’t conduct any business there. Your work assignments are temporary, and you have no way of knowing where your future assignments will be located. You have a room in your married sister's house in Dayton. You stay there for one or two weekends a year, but you do no work in the area. You don’t pay your sister for the use of the room.\n\nYou don’t satisfy any of the three factors listed earlier. You are an itinerant and have no tax home.\n\nTax Home Different From Family Home\n\nIf you (and your family) don’t live at your tax home (defined earlier), you can’t deduct the cost of traveling between your tax home and your family home. You also can’t deduct the cost of meals and lodging while at your tax home. See Example 1, later.\n\nIf you are working temporarily in the same city where you and your family live, you may be considered as traveling away from home. See Example 2, later.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou are a truck driver and you and your family live in Tucson. You are employed by a trucking firm that has its terminal in Phoenix. At the end of your long runs, you return to your home terminal in Phoenix and spend one night there before returning home. You can’t deduct any expenses you have for meals and lodging in Phoenix or the cost of traveling from Phoenix to Tucson. This is because Phoenix is your tax home.\n\nExample 2.\n\nYour family home is in Pittsburgh, where you work 12 weeks a year. The rest of the year you work for the same employer in Baltimore. In Baltimore, you eat in restaurants and sleep in a rooming house. Your salary is the same whether you are in Pittsburgh or Baltimore.\n\nBecause you spend most of your working time and earn most of your salary in Baltimore, that city is your tax home. You can’t deduct any expenses you have for meals and lodging there. However, when you return to work in Pittsburgh, you are away from your tax home even though you stay at your family home. You can deduct the cost of your round trip between Baltimore and Pittsburgh. You can also deduct your part of your family's living expenses for non-entertainment-related meals and lodging while you are living and working in Pittsburgh.\n\nTemporary Assignment or Job\n\nYou may regularly work at your tax home and also work at another location. It may not be practical to return to your tax home from this other location at the end of each workday.\n\nTemporary assignment vs. indefinite assignment.\n\nIf your assignment or job away from your main place of work is temporary, your tax home doesn’t change. You are considered to be away from home for the whole period you are away from your main place of work. You can deduct your travel expenses if they otherwise qualify for deduction. Generally, a temporary assignment in a single location is one that is realistically expected to last (and does in fact last) for 1 year or less.\n\nHowever, if your assignment or job is indefinite, the location of the assignment or job becomes your new tax home and you can’t deduct your travel expenses while there. An assignment or job in a single location is considered indefinite if it is realistically expected to last for more than 1 year, whether or not it actually lasts for more than 1 year.\n\nIf your assignment is indefinite, you must include in your income any amounts you receive from your employer for living expenses, even if they are called “travel allowances” and you account to your employer for them. You may be able to deduct the cost of relocating to your new tax home as a moving expense. See Pub. 3 for more information.\n\n. For tax years beginning after December 2017 and before January 2026, the deduction of certain moving expenses is suspended for nonmilitary taxpayers. In order to deduct certain moving expenses, you must be an active member of the military and moving due to a permanent change of duty station..\n\nException for federal crime investigations or prosecutions.\n\nIf you are a federal employee participating in a federal crime investigation or prosecution, you aren’t subject to the 1-year rule. This means you may be able to deduct travel expenses even if you are away from your tax home for more than 1 year provided you meet the other requirements for deductibility.\n\nFor you to qualify, the Attorney General (or their designee) must certify that you are traveling:\n\nFor the federal government;\n\nIn a temporary duty status; and\n\nTo investigate, prosecute, or provide support services for the investigation or prosecution of a federal crime.\n\nDetermining temporary or indefinite.\n\nYou must determine whether your assignment is temporary or indefinite when you start work. If you expect an assignment or job to last for 1 year or less, it is temporary unless there are facts and circumstances that indicate otherwise. An assignment or job that is initially temporary may become indefinite due to changed circumstances. A series of assignments to the same location, all for short periods but that together cover a long period, may be considered an indefinite assignment.\n\nThe following examples illustrate whether an assignment or job is temporary or indefinite.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou are a construction worker. You live and regularly work in Los Angeles. You are a member of a trade union in Los Angeles that helps you get work in the Los Angeles area. Your tax home is Los Angeles. Because of a shortage of work, you took a job on a construction project in Fresno. Your job was scheduled to end in 8 months. The job actually lasted 10 months.\n\nYou realistically expected the job in Fresno to last 8 months. The job actually did last less than 1 year. The job is temporary and your tax home is still in Los Angeles.\n\nExample 2.\n\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you realistically expected the work in Fresno to last 18 months. The job was actually completed in 10 months.\n\nYour job in Fresno is indefinite because you realistically expected the work to last longer than 1 year, even though it actually lasted less than 1 year. You can’t deduct any travel expenses you had in Fresno because Fresno became your tax home.\n\nExample 3.\n\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you realistically expected the work in Fresno to last 9 months. After 8 months, however, you were asked to remain for 7 more months (for a total actual stay of 15 months).\n\nInitially, you realistically expected the job in Fresno to last for only 9 months. However, due to changed circumstances occurring after 8 months, it was no longer realistic for you to expect that the job in Fresno would last for 1 year or less. You can deduct only your travel expenses for the first 8 months. You can’t deduct any travel expenses you had after that time because Fresno became your tax home when the job became indefinite.\n\nGoing home on days off.\n\nIf you go back to your tax home from a temporary assignment on your days off, you aren’t considered away from home while you are in your hometown. You can’t deduct the cost of your meals and lodging there. However, you can deduct your travel expenses, including meals and lodging, while traveling between your temporary place of work and your tax home. You can claim these expenses up to the amount it would have cost you to stay at your temporary place of work.\n\nIf you keep your hotel room during your visit home, you can deduct the cost of your hotel room. In addition, you can deduct your expenses of returning home up to the amount you would have spent for meals had you stayed at your temporary place of work.\n\nProbationary work period.\n\nIf you take a job that requires you to move, with the understanding that you will keep the job if your work is satisfactory during a probationary period, the job is indefinite. You can’t deduct any of your expenses for meals and lodging during the probationary period.\n\nWhat Travel Expenses Are Deductible?\n\nOnce you have determined that you are traveling away from your tax home, you can determine what travel expenses are deductible.\n\nYou can deduct ordinary and necessary expenses you have when you travel away from home on business. The type of expense you can deduct depends on the facts and your circumstances.\n\nTable 1-1 summarizes travel expenses you may be able to deduct. You may have other deductible travel expenses that aren’t covered there, depending on the facts and your circumstances.\n\n. When you travel away from home on business, you must keep records of all the expenses you have and any advances you receive from your employer. You can use a log, diary, notebook, or any other written record to keep track of your expenses. The types of expenses you need to record, along with supporting documentation, are described in Table 5-1 (see chapter 5)..\n\nSeparating costs.\n\nIf you have one expense that includes the costs of non-entertainment-related meals, entertainment, and other services (such as lodging or transportation), you must allocate that expense between the cost of non-entertainment-related meals, and entertainment and the cost of other services. You must have a reasonable basis for making this allocation. For example, you must allocate your expenses if a hotel includes one or more meals in its room charge.\n\nTravel expenses for another individual.\n\nIf a spouse, dependent, or other individual goes with you (or your employee) on a business trip or to a business convention, you generally can’t deduct their travel expenses.\n\nEmployee.\n\nYou can deduct the travel expenses of someone who goes with you if that person:\n\nIs your employee,\n\nHas a bona fide business purpose for the travel, and\n\nWould otherwise be allowed to deduct the travel expenses.\n\nBusiness associate.\n\nIf a business associate travels with you and meets the conditions in (2) and (3) above, you can deduct the travel expenses you have for that person. A business associate is someone with whom you could reasonably expect to actively conduct business. A business associate can be a current or prospective (likely to become) customer, client, supplier, employee, agent, partner, or professional advisor.\n\nTable 1-1. Travel Expenses You Can Deduct\n\nThis chart summarizes expenses you can deduct when you travel away from home for business purposes\n\nIF you have expenses for... THEN you can deduct the cost of... transportation travel by airplane, train, bus, or car between your home and your business destination. If you were provided with a free ticket or you are riding free as a result of a frequent traveler or similar program, your cost is zero. If you travel by ship, see Luxury Water Travel and Cruise Ships under Conventions, later, for additional rules and limits. taxi, commuter bus, and airport limousine fares for these and other types of transportation that take you between:\n\nThe airport or station and your hotel; and\n\nThe hotel and the work location of your customers or clients, your business meeting place, or your temporary work location.\n\nbaggage and shipping sending baggage and sample or display material between your regular and temporary work locations. car operating and maintaining your car when traveling away from home on business. You can deduct actual expenses or the standard mileage rate, as well as business-related tolls and parking. If you rent a car while away from home on business, you can deduct only the business-use portion of the expenses. lodging and meals your lodging and non-entertainment-related meals if your business trip is overnight or long enough that you need to stop for sleep or rest to properly perform your duties. Meals include amounts spent for food, beverages, taxes, and related tips. See Meals, later, for additional rules and limits. cleaning dry cleaning and laundry. telephone business calls while on your business trip. This includes business communication by fax machine or other communication devices. tips tips you pay for any expenses in this chart. other other similar ordinary and necessary expenses related to your business travel. These expenses might include transportation to or from a business meal, public stenographer's fees, computer rental fees, and operating and maintaining a house trailer.\n\nBona fide business purpose.\n\nA bona fide business purpose exists if you can prove a real business purpose for the individual's presence. Incidental services, such as typing notes or assisting in entertaining customers, aren’t enough to make the expenses deductible.\n\nExample.\n\nYou drive to Chicago on business and take your spouse with you. Your spouse isn’t your employee. Your spouse occasionally types notes, performs similar services, and accompanies you to luncheons and dinners. The performance of these services doesn’t establish that your spouse’s presence on the trip is necessary to the conduct of your business. Your spouse’s expenses aren’t deductible.\n\nYou pay $199 a day for a double room. A single room costs $149 a day. You can deduct the total cost of driving your car to and from Chicago, but only $149 a day for your hotel room. If both you and your spouse use public transportation, you can only deduct your fare.\n\nMeals\n\nYou can deduct a portion of the cost of meals if it is necessary for you to stop for substantial sleep or rest to properly perform your duties while traveling away from home on business. Meal and entertainment expenses are discussed in chapter 2.\n\nLavish or extravagant.\n\nYou can't deduct expenses for meals that are lavish or extravagant. An expense isn't considered lavish or extravagant if it is reasonable based on the facts and circumstances. Meal expenses won't be disallowed merely because they are more than a fixed dollar amount or because the meals take place at deluxe restaurants, hotels, or resorts.\n\n50% limit on meals.\n\nYou can figure your meal expenses using either of the following methods.\n\nActual cost.\n\nThe standard meal allowance.\n\nBoth of these methods are explained below. But, regardless of the method you use, you can generally deduct only 50% of the unreimbursed cost of your meals.\n\nIf you are reimbursed for the cost of your meals, how you apply the 50% limit depends on whether your employer's reimbursement plan was accountable or nonaccountable. If you aren’t reimbursed, the 50% limit applies even if the unreimbursed meal expense is for business travel. Chapter 2 discusses the 50% Limit in more detail, and chapter 6 discusses accountable and nonaccountable plans.\n\nActual Cost\n\nYou can use the actual cost of your meals to figure the amount of your expense before reimbursement and application of the 50% deduction limit. If you use this method, you must keep records of your actual cost.\n\nStandard Meal Allowance\n\nGenerally, you can use the “standard meal allowance” method as an alternative to the actual cost method. It allows you to use a set amount for your daily meals and incidental expenses (M&IE), instead of keeping records of your actual costs. The set amount varies depending on where and when you travel. In this publication, “standard meal allowance” refers to the federal rate for M&IE, discussed later under Amount of standard meal allowance. If you use the standard meal allowance, you must still keep records to prove the time, place, and business purpose of your travel. See the recordkeeping rules for travel in chapter 5.\n\nIncidental expenses.\n\nThe term “incidental expenses” means fees and tips given to porters, baggage carriers, hotel staff, and staff on ships.\n\nIncidental expenses don’t include expenses for laundry, cleaning and pressing of clothing, lodging taxes, costs of telegrams or telephone calls, transportation between places of lodging or business and places where meals are taken, or the mailing cost of filing travel vouchers and paying employer-sponsored charge card billings.\n\nIncidental-expenses-only method.\n\nYou can use an optional method (instead of actual cost) for deducting incidental expenses only. The amount of the deduction is $5 a day. You can use this method only if you didn’t pay or incur any meal expenses. You can’t use this method on any day that you use the standard meal allowance. This method is subject to the proration rules for partial days. See Travel for days you depart and return, later, in this chapter.\n\nNote.\n\nThe incidental-expenses-only method isn’t subject to the 50% limit discussed below.\n\n. Federal employees should refer to the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) at eCFR.gov for changes affecting claims for reimbursement..\n\n50% limit may apply.\n\nIf you use the standard meal allowance method for non-entertainment-related meal expenses and you aren’t reimbursed or you are reimbursed under a nonaccountable plan, you can generally deduct only 50% of the standard meal allowance. If you are reimbursed under an accountable plan and you are deducting amounts that are more than your reimbursements, you can deduct only 50% of the excess amount. The 50% Limit is discussed in more detail in chapter 2, and accountable and nonaccountable plans are discussed in chapter 6.\n\n. There is no optional standard lodging amount similar to the standard meal allowance. Your allowable lodging expense deduction is your actual cost..\n\nWho can use the standard meal allowance.\n\nYou can use the standard meal allowance whether you are an employee or self-employed, and whether or not you are reimbursed for your traveling expenses.\n\nUse of the standard meal allowance for other travel.\n\nYou can use the standard meal allowance to figure your meal expenses when you travel in connection with investment and other income-producing property. You can also use it to figure your meal expenses when you travel for qualifying educational purposes. You can’t use the standard meal allowance to figure the cost of your meals when you travel for medical or charitable purposes.\n\nAmount of standard meal allowance.\n\nThe standard meal allowance is the federal M&IE rate. For travel in 2023, the rate for most small localities in the United States is $59 per day.\n\nMost major cities and many other localities in the United States are designated as high-cost areas, qualifying for higher standard meal allowances.\n\n. You can find this information (organized by state) at GSA.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates. Enter a zip code or select a city and state for the per diem rates for the current fiscal year. Per diem rates for prior fiscal years are available by using the drop-down menu..\n\nIf you travel to more than one location in one day, use the rate in effect for the area where you stop for sleep or rest. If you work in the transportation industry, however, see Special rate for transportation workers, later.\n\nFederal government's fiscal year.\n\nPer diem rates are listed by the federal government's fiscal year, which runs from October 1 to September 30. You can choose to use the rates from the 2022 fiscal year per diem tables or the rates from the 2023 fiscal year tables, but you must consistently use the same tables for all travel you are reporting on your income tax return for the year. See Transition Rules, later.\n\nStandard meal allowance for areas outside the continental United States.\n\nThe standard meal allowance rates above don’t apply to travel in Alaska, Hawaii, or any other location outside the continental United States. The Department of Defense establishes per diem rates for Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Midway, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Wake Island, and other non-foreign areas outside the continental United States. The Department of State establishes per diem rates for all other foreign areas.\n\n. You can access per diem rates for non-foreign areas outside the continental United States at Travel.dod.mil/Travel-Transportation-Rates/Per-Diem/Per-Diem-Rate-Lookup/. You can access all other foreign per diem rates at aoprals.state.gov/web920/per_diem.asp..\n\nSpecial rate for transportation workers.\n\nYou can use a special standard meal allowance if you work in the transportation industry. You are in the transportation industry if your work:\n\nDirectly involves moving people or goods by airplane, barge, bus, ship, train, or truck; and\n\nRegularly requires you to travel away from home and, during any single trip, usually involves travel to areas eligible for different standard meal allowance rates.\n\nIf this applies, you can claim a standard meal allowance of $69 a day ($74 for travel outside the continental United States) for travel in 2023.\n\nUsing the special rate for transportation workers eliminates the need for you to determine the standard meal allowance for every area where you stop for sleep or rest. If you choose to use the special rate for any trip, you must use the special rate (and not use the regular standard meal allowance rates) for all trips you take that year.\n\nTravel for days you depart and return.\n\nFor both the day you depart for and the day you return from a business trip, you must prorate the standard meal allowance (figure a reduced amount for each day). You can do so by one of two methods.\n\nMethod 1: You can claim 3/4 of the standard meal allowance.\n\nMethod 2: You can prorate using any method that you consistently apply and that is in accordance with reasonable business practice.\n\nExample.\n\nYou are employed in New Orleans as a convention planner. In March, your employer sent you on a 3-day trip to Washington, DC, to attend a planning seminar. You left your home in New Orleans at 10 a.m. on Wednesday and arrived in Washington, DC, at 5:30 p.m. After spending 2 nights there, you flew back to New Orleans on Friday and arrived back home at 8 p.m. Your employer gave you a flat amount to cover your expenses and included it with your wages.\n\nUnder Method 1, you can claim 2½ days of the standard meal allowance for Washington, DC: 3/4 of the daily rate for Wednesday and Friday (the days you departed and returned), and the full daily rate for Thursday.\n\nUnder Method 2, you could also use any method that you apply consistently and that is in accordance with reasonable business practice. For example, you could claim 3 days of the standard meal allowance even though a federal employee would have to use Method 1 and be limited to only 2½ days.\n\nTravel in the United States\n\nThe following discussion applies to travel in the United States. For this purpose, the United States includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The treatment of your travel expenses depends on how much of your trip was business related and on how much of your trip occurred within the United States. See Part of Trip Outside the United States, later.\n\nTrip Primarily for Business\n\nYou can deduct all of your travel expenses if your trip was entirely business related. If your trip was primarily for business and, while at your business destination, you extended your stay for a vacation, made a personal side trip, or had other personal activities, you can deduct only your business-related travel expenses. These expenses include the travel costs of getting to and from your business destination and any business-related expenses at your business destination.\n\nExample.\n\nYou work in Atlanta and take a business trip to New Orleans in May. Your business travel totals 900 miles round trip. On your way home, you stop in Mobile to visit your parents. You spend $2,165 for the 9 days you are away from home for travel, non-entertainment-related meals, lodging, and other travel expenses. If you hadn’t stopped in Mobile, you would have been gone only 6 days, and your total cost would have been $1,633.50. You can deduct $1,633.50 for your trip, including the cost of round-trip transportation to and from New Orleans. The deduction for your non-entertainment-related meals is subject to the 50% limit on meals mentioned earlier.\n\nTrip Primarily for Personal Reasons\n\nIf your trip was primarily for personal reasons, such as a vacation, the entire cost of the trip is a nondeductible personal expense. However, you can deduct any expenses you have while at your destination that are directly related to your business.\n\nA trip to a resort or on a cruise ship may be a vacation even if the promoter advertises that it is primarily for business. The scheduling of incidental business activities during a trip, such as viewing videotapes or attending lectures dealing with general subjects, won’t change what is really a vacation into a business trip.\n\nPart of Trip Outside the United States\n\nIf part of your trip is outside the United States, use the rules described later in this chapter under Travel Outside the United States for that part of the trip. For the part of your trip that is inside the United States, use the rules for travel in the United States. Travel outside the United States doesn’t include travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States. The following discussion can help you determine whether your trip was entirely within the United States.\n\nPublic transportation.\n\nIf you travel by public transportation, any place in the United States where that vehicle makes a scheduled stop is a point in the United States. Once the vehicle leaves the last scheduled stop in the United States on its way to a point outside the United States, you apply the rules under Travel Outside the United States, later.\n\nExample.\n\nYou fly from New York to Puerto Rico with a scheduled stop in Miami. Puerto Rico isn’t considered part of the United States for purposes of travel. You return to New York nonstop. The flight from New York to Miami is in the United States, so only the flight from Miami to Puerto Rico is outside the United States. Because there are no scheduled stops between Puerto Rico and New York, all of the return trip is outside the United States.\n\nPrivate car.\n\nTravel by private car in the United States is travel between points in the United States, even though you are on your way to a destination outside the United States.\n\nExample.\n\nYou travel by car from Denver to Mexico City and return. Your travel from Denver to the border and from the border back to Denver is travel in the United States, and the rules in this section apply. The rules below under Travel Outside the United States apply to your trip from the border to Mexico City and back to the border.\n\nTravel Outside the United States\n\nIf any part of your business travel is outside the United States, some of your deductions for the cost of getting to and from your destination may be limited. For this purpose, the United States includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nHow much of your travel expenses you can deduct depends in part upon how much of your trip outside the United States was business related.\n\nTravel Entirely for Business or Considered Entirely for Business\n\nYou can deduct all your travel expenses of getting to and from your business destination if your trip is entirely for business or considered entirely for business.\n\nTravel entirely for business.\n\nIf you travel outside the United States and you spend the entire time on business activities, you can deduct all of your travel expenses.\n\nTravel considered entirely for business.\n\nEven if you didn’t spend your entire time on business activities, your trip is considered entirely for business if you meet at least one of the following four exceptions.\n\nException 1—No substantial control.\n\nYour trip is considered entirely for business if you didn’t have substantial control over arranging the trip. The fact that you control the timing of your trip doesn’t, by itself, mean that you have substantial control over arranging your trip.\n\nYou don’t have substantial control over your trip if you:\n\nAre an employee who was reimbursed or paid a travel expense allowance, and\n\nAren’t related to your employer, or\n\nAren’t a managing executive.\n\n“Related to your employer” is defined later in chapter 6 under Per Diem and Car Allowances.\n\nA “managing executive” is an employee who has the authority and responsibility, without being subject to the veto of another, to decide on the need for the business travel.\n\nA self-employed person generally has substantial control over arranging business trips.\n\nException 2—Outside United States no more than a week.\n\nYour trip is considered entirely for business if you were outside the United States for a week or less, combining business and nonbusiness activities. One week means 7 consecutive days. In counting the days, don’t count the day you leave the United States, but do count the day you return to the United States.\n\nExample.\n\nYou traveled to Brussels primarily for business. You left Denver on Tuesday and flew to New York. On Wednesday, you flew from New York to Brussels, arriving the next morning. On Thursday and Friday, you had business discussions, and from Saturday until Tuesday, you were sightseeing. You flew back to New York, arriving Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday, you flew back to Denver.\n\nAlthough you were away from your home in Denver for more than a week, you weren’t outside the United States for more than a week. This is because the day you depart doesn’t count as a day outside the United States.\n\nYou can deduct your cost of the round-trip flight between Denver and Brussels. You can also deduct the cost of your stay in Brussels for Thursday and Friday while you conducted business. However, you can’t deduct the cost of your stay in Brussels from Saturday through Tuesday because those days were spent on nonbusiness activities.\n\nException 3—Less than 25% of time on personal activities.\n\nYour trip is considered entirely for business if:\n\nYou were outside the United States for more than a week, and\n\nYou spent less than 25% of the total time you were outside the United States on nonbusiness activities.\n\nFor this purpose, count both the day your trip began and the day it ended.\n\nExample.\n\nYou flew from Seattle to Tokyo, where you spent 14 days on business and 5 days on personal matters. You then flew back to Seattle. You spent 1 day flying in each direction.\n\nBecause only 5/21 (less than 25%) of your total time abroad was for nonbusiness activities, you can deduct as travel expenses what it would have cost you to make the trip if you hadn’t engaged in any nonbusiness activity. The amount you can deduct is the cost of the round-trip plane fare and 16 days of non-entertainment-related meals (subject to the 50% Limit), lodging, and other related expenses.\n\nException 4—Vacation not a major consideration.\n\nYour trip is considered entirely for business if you can establish that a personal vacation wasn’t a major consideration, even if you have substantial control over arranging the trip.\n\nTravel Primarily for Business\n\nIf you travel outside the United States primarily for business but spend some of your time on other activities, you generally can’t deduct all of your travel expenses. You can only deduct the business portion of your cost of getting to and from your destination. You must allocate the costs between your business and other activities to determine your deductible amount. See Travel allocation rules, later.\n\n. You don’t have to allocate your travel expenses if you meet one of the four exceptions listed earlier under Travel considered entirely for business. In those cases, you can deduct the total cost of getting to and from your destination..\n\nTravel allocation rules.\n\nIf your trip outside the United States was primarily for business, you must allocate your travel time on a day-to-day basis between business days and nonbusiness days. The days you depart from and return to the United States are both counted as days outside the United States.\n\nTo figure the deductible amount of your round-trip travel expenses, use the following fraction. The numerator (top number) is the total number of business days outside the United States. The denominator (bottom number) is the total number of business and nonbusiness days of travel.\n\nCounting business days.\n\nYour business days include transportation days, days your presence was required, days you spent on business, and certain weekends and holidays.\n\nTransportation day.\n\nCount as a business day any day you spend traveling to or from a business destination. However, if because of a nonbusiness activity you don’t travel by a direct route, your business days are the days it would take you to travel a reasonably direct route to your business destination. Extra days for side trips or nonbusiness activities can’t be counted as business days.\n\nPresence required.\n\nCount as a business day any day your presence is required at a particular place for a specific business purpose. Count it as a business day even if you spend most of the day on nonbusiness activities.\n\nDay spent on business.\n\nIf your principal activity during working hours is the pursuit of your trade or business, count the day as a business day. Also, count as a business day any day you are prevented from working because of circumstances beyond your control.\n\nCertain weekends and holidays.\n\nCount weekends, holidays, and other necessary standby days as business days if they fall between business days. But if they follow your business meetings or activity and you remain at your business destination for nonbusiness or personal reasons, don’t count them as business days.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYour tax home is New York City. You travel to Quebec, where you have a business meeting on Friday. You have another meeting on the following Monday. Because your presence was required on both Friday and Monday, they are business days. Because the weekend is between business days, Saturday and Sunday are counted as business days. This is true even though you use the weekend for sightseeing, visiting friends, or other nonbusiness activity.\n\nExample 2.\n\nIf, in Example 1, you had no business in Quebec after Friday, but stayed until Monday before starting home, Saturday and Sunday would be nonbusiness days.\n\nNonbusiness activity on the way to or from your business destination.\n\nIf you stopped for a vacation or other nonbusiness activity either on the way from the United States to your business destination, or on the way back to the United States from your business destination, you must allocate part of your travel expenses to the nonbusiness activity.\n\nThe part you must allocate is the amount it would have cost you to travel between the point where travel outside the United States begins and your nonbusiness destination and a return to the point where travel outside the United States ends.\n\nYou determine the nonbusiness portion of that expense by multiplying it by a fraction. The numerator (top number) of the fraction is the number of nonbusiness days during your travel outside the United States, and the denominator (bottom number) is the total number of days you spend outside the United States.\n\nExample.\n\nYou live in New York. On May 4, you flew to Paris to attend a business conference that began on May 5. The conference ended at noon on May 14. That evening, you flew to Dublin where you visited with friends until the afternoon of May 21, when you flew directly home to New York. The primary purpose for the trip was to attend the conference.\n\nIf you hadn’t stopped in Dublin, you would have arrived home the evening of May 14. You don’t meet any of the exceptions that would allow you to consider your travel entirely for business. May 4 through May 14 (11 days) are business days and May 15 through May 21 (7 days) are nonbusiness days.\n\nYou can deduct the cost of your non-entertainment-related meals (subject to the 50% Limit), lodging, and other business-related travel expenses while in Paris.\n\nYou can’t deduct your expenses while in Dublin. You also can’t deduct 7/18 of what it would have cost you to travel round trip between New York and Dublin.\n\nYou paid $750 to fly from New York to Paris, $400 to fly from Paris to Dublin, and $700 to fly from Dublin back to New York. Round-trip airfare from New York to Dublin would have been $1,250.\n\nYou figure the deductible part of your air travel expenses by subtracting 7/18 of the round-trip airfare and other expenses you would have had in traveling directly between New York and Dublin ($1,250 × 7/18 = $486) from your total expenses in traveling from New York to Paris to Dublin and back to New York ($750 + $400 + $700 = $1,850).\n\nYour deductible air travel expense is $1,364 ($1,850 − $486).\n\nNonbusiness activity at, near, or beyond business destination.\n\nIf you had a vacation or other nonbusiness activity at, near, or beyond your business destination, you must allocate part of your travel expenses to the nonbusiness activity.\n\nThe part you must allocate is the amount it would have cost you to travel between the point where travel outside the United States begins and your business destination and a return to the point where travel outside the United States ends.\n\nYou determine the nonbusiness portion of that expense by multiplying it by a fraction. The numerator (top number) of the fraction is the number of nonbusiness days during your travel outside the United States, and the denominator (bottom number) is the total number of days you spend outside the United States.\n\nNone of your travel expenses for nonbusiness activities at, near, or beyond your business destination are deductible.\n\nExample.\n\nAssume that the dates are the same as in the previous example but that instead of going to Dublin for your vacation, you fly to Venice, Italy, for a vacation.\n\nYou can’t deduct any part of the cost of your trip from Paris to Venice and return to Paris. In addition, you can’t deduct 7/18 of the airfare and other expenses from New York to Paris and back to New York.\n\nYou can deduct 11/18 of the round-trip plane fare and other travel expenses from New York to Paris, plus your non-entertainment-related meals (subject to the 50% Limit), lodging, and any other business expenses you had in Paris. (Assume these expenses total $4,939.) If the round-trip plane fare and other travel-related expenses (such as food during the trip) are $1,750, you can deduct travel costs of $1,069 (11/18 × $1,750), plus the full $4,939 for the expenses you had in Paris.\n\nOther methods.\n\nYou can use another method of counting business days if you establish that it more clearly reflects the time spent on other than business activities outside the United States.\n\nTravel Primarily for Personal Reasons\n\nIf you travel outside the United States primarily for vacation or for investment purposes, the entire cost of the trip is a nondeductible personal expense. However, if you spend some time attending brief professional seminars or a continuing education program, you can deduct your registration fees and other expenses you have that are directly related to your business.\n\nExample.\n\nThe university from which you graduated has a continuing education program for members of its alumni association. This program consists of trips to various foreign countries where academic exercises and conferences are set up to acquaint individuals in most occupations with selected facilities in several regions of the world. However, none of the conferences are directed toward specific occupations or professions. It is up to each participant to seek out specialists and organizational settings appropriate to their occupational interests.\n\nThree-hour sessions are held each day over a 5-day period at each of the selected overseas facilities where participants can meet with individual practitioners. These sessions are composed of a variety of activities including workshops, mini-lectures, roleplaying, skill development, and exercises. Professional conference directors schedule and conduct the sessions. Participants can choose those sessions they wish to attend.\n\nYou can participate in this program because you are a member of the alumni association. You and your family take one of the trips. You spend about 2 hours at each of the planned sessions. The rest of the time you go touring and sightseeing with your family. The trip lasts less than 1 week.\n\nYour travel expenses for the trip aren’t deductible since the trip was primarily a vacation. However, registration fees and any other incidental expenses you have for the five planned sessions you attended that are directly related and beneficial to your business are deductible business expenses. These expenses should be specifically stated in your records to ensure proper allocation of your deductible business expenses.\n\nLuxury Water Travel\n\nIf you travel by ocean liner, cruise ship, or other form of luxury water transportation for business purposes, there is a daily limit on the amount you can deduct. The limit is twice the highest federal per diem rate allowable at the time of your travel. (Generally, the federal per diem is the amount paid to federal government employees for daily living expenses when they travel away from home within the United States for business purposes.)\n\nDaily limit on luxury water travel.\n\nThe highest federal per diem rate allowed and the daily limit for luxury water travel in 2023 are shown in the following table.\n\n2023 Dates Highest Federal Per Diem Daily Limit on Luxury Water Travel January 1 – March 31 $564 $1,128 April 1 – April 30 498 996 May 1– May 31 398 796 June 1 – September 30 538 1,076 October 1 – October 31 401 802 November 1 – November 30 394 788 December 1 – December 31 564 1,128\n\nExample.\n\nYou are a travel agent and traveled by ocean liner from New York to London, England, on business in May. Your expense for the 6-day cruise was $6,200. Your deduction for the cruise can’t exceed $4,776 (6 days × $796 daily limit).\n\nMeals and entertainment.\n\nIf your expenses for luxury water travel include separately stated amounts for meals or entertainment, those amounts are subject to the 50% limit on non-entertainment-related meals and entertainment before you apply the daily limit. For a discussion of the 50% Limit, see chapter 2.\n\nExample.\n\nIn the previous example, your luxury water travel had a total cost of $6,200. Of that amount, $3,700 was separately stated as non-entertainment-related meals and $1,000 was separately stated as entertainment. Considering that you are self-employed, you aren’t reimbursed for any of your travel expenses. You figure your deductible travel expenses as follows.\n\nEntertainment $1,000 0% limit x 0.00 Allowable entertainment $0.00 Non-entertainment-related meals $3,700 50% limit × 0.50 Allowable non-entertainment meals & entertainment $1,850 Other travel expenses + 1,500 Allowable cost before the daily limit $3,350 Daily limit for May 2023 $ 796 Times number of days × 6 Maximum luxury water travel deduction $4,776 Amount of allowable deduction $3,350\n\nYour deduction for your cruise is limited to $3,350, even though the limit on luxury water travel is higher.\n\nNot separately stated.\n\nIf your meal or entertainment charges aren’t separately stated or aren’t clearly identifiable, you don’t have to allocate any portion of the total charge to meals or entertainment.\n\nThe daily limit on luxury water travel (discussed earlier) doesn’t apply to expenses you have to attend a convention, seminar, or meeting on board a cruise ship. See Cruise Ships, later, under Conventions.\n\nConventions\n\nYou can deduct your travel expenses when you attend a convention if you can show that your attendance benefits your trade or business. You can’t deduct the travel expenses for your family.\n\nIf the convention is for investment, political, social, or other purposes unrelated to your trade or business, you can’t deduct the expenses.\n\n. Your appointment or election as a delegate doesn’t, in itself, determine whether you can deduct travel expenses. You can deduct your travel expenses only if your attendance is connected to your own trade or business. .\n\nConvention agenda.\n\nThe convention agenda or program generally shows the purpose of the convention. You can show your attendance at the convention benefits your trade or business by comparing the agenda with the official duties and responsibilities of your position. The agenda doesn’t have to deal specifically with your official duties and responsibilities; it will be enough if the agenda is so related to your position that it shows your attendance was for business purposes.\n\nConventions Held Outside the North American Area\n\nYou can’t deduct expenses for attending a convention, seminar, or similar meeting held outside the North American area unless:\n\nThe meeting is directly related to the active conduct of your trade or business, and\n\nIt is as reasonable to hold the meeting outside the North American area as within the North American area. See Reasonableness test, later.\n\nIf the meeting meets these requirements, you must also satisfy the rules for deducting expenses for business trips in general, discussed earlier under Travel Outside the United States.\n\nNorth American area.\n\nThe North American area includes the following locations.\n\nAmerican Samoa Jarvis Island Antigua and Barbuda Johnston Island Aruba Kingman Reef Bahamas Marshall Islands Baker Island Mexico Barbados Micronesia Bermuda Midway Islands Canada Northern Mariana Costa Rica Islands Curaçao Palau Dominica Palmyra Atoll Dominican Republic Panama Grenada Puerto Rico Guam Saint Lucia Guyana Trinidad and Tobago Honduras USA Howland Island U.S. Virgin Islands Jamaica Wake Island\n\nThe North American area also includes U.S. islands, cays, and reefs that are territories of the United States and not part of the 50 states or the District of Columbia. See Revenue Ruling 2016-16, available at IRS.gov/irb/2016-26_IRB#RR-2016-16, for more information.\n\nReasonableness test.\n\nThe following factors are taken into account to determine if it was as reasonable to hold the meeting outside the North American area as within the North American area.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting and the activities taking place at the meeting.\n\nThe purposes and activities of the sponsoring organizations or groups.\n\nThe homes of the active members of the sponsoring organizations and the places at which other meetings of the sponsoring organizations or groups have been or will be held.\n\nOther relevant factors you may present.\n\nCruise Ships\n\nYou can deduct up to $2,000 per year of your expenses of attending conventions, seminars, or similar meetings held on cruise ships. All ships that sail are considered cruise ships.\n\nYou can deduct these expenses only if all of the following requirements are met.\n\nThe convention, seminar, or meeting is directly related to the active conduct of your trade or business.\n\nThe cruise ship is a vessel registered in the United States.\n\nAll of the cruise ship's ports of call are in the United States or in territories of the United States.\n\nYou attach to your return a written statement signed by you that includes information about:\n\nThe total days of the trip (not including the days of transportation to and from the cruise ship port),\n\nThe number of hours each day that you devoted to scheduled business activities, and\n\nA program of the scheduled business activities of the meeting.\n\nYou attach to your return a written statement signed by an officer of the organization or group sponsoring the meeting that includes:\n\nA schedule of the business activities of each day of the meeting, and\n\nThe number of hours you attended the scheduled business activities.\n\n2. Meals and Entertainment\n\nYou can no longer take a deduction for any expense related to activities generally considered entertainment, amusement, or recreation. You can continue to deduct 50% of the cost of business meals if you (or your employee) are present and the food or beverages aren't considered lavish or extravagant.\n\n. If food or beverages are provided during or at an entertainment event, and the food and beverages were purchased separately from the entertainment or the cost of the food and beverages was stated separately from the cost of the entertainment on one or more bills, invoices, or receipts, you may be able to deduct the separately stated costs as a meal expense. For more information, see Regulations section 1.274-11(d)(2), Example 2..\n\nEntertainment\n\nEntertainment—Defined\n\nEntertainment includes any activity generally considered to provide entertainment, amusement, or recreation. Examples include entertaining guests at nightclubs; at social, athletic, and sporting clubs; at theaters; at sporting events; on yachts; or on hunting, fishing, vacation, and similar trips. Entertainment may also include meeting personal, living, or family needs of individuals, such as providing meals, a hotel suite, or a car to customers or their families.\n\nDeduction may depend on your type of business.\n\nYour kind of business may determine if a particular activity is considered entertainment. For example, if you are a dress designer and have a fashion show to introduce your new designs to store buyers, the show generally isn’t considered entertainment. This is because fashion shows are typical in your business. But, if you are an appliance distributor and hold a fashion show for the spouses of your retailers, the show is generally considered entertainment.\n\nSeparating costs.\n\nIf you have one expense that includes the costs of entertainment and other services (such as lodging or transportation), you must allocate that expense between the cost of entertainment and the cost of other services. You must have a reasonable basis for making this allocation. For example, you must allocate your expenses if a hotel includes entertainment in its lounge on the same bill with your room charge.\n\nExceptions to the Rules\n\nIn general, entertainment expenses are nondeductible. However, there are a few exceptions to the general rule, including:\n\nEntertainment treated as compensation on your originally filed tax returns (and treated as wages to your employees);\n\nRecreational expenses for employees such as a holiday party or a summer picnic;\n\nExpenses related to attending business meetings or conventions of certain exempt organizations such as business leagues, chambers of commerce, professional associations, etc.; and\n\nEntertainment sold to customers. For example, if you run a nightclub, your expenses for the entertainment you furnish to your customers, such as a floor show, aren’t subject to the nondeductible rules.\n\nExamples of Nondeductible Entertainment\n\nEntertainment events.\n\nGenerally, you can't deduct any expense for an entertainment event. This includes expenses for entertaining guests at nightclubs; at social, athletic, and sporting clubs; at theaters; at sporting events; on yachts; or on hunting, fishing, vacation, and similar trips.\n\nEntertainment facilities.\n\nGenerally, you can’t deduct any expense for the use of an entertainment facility. This includes expenses for depreciation and operating costs such as rent, utilities, maintenance, and protection.\n\nAn entertainment facility is any property you own, rent, or use for entertainment. Examples include a yacht, hunting lodge, fishing camp, swimming pool, tennis court, bowling alley, car, airplane, apartment, hotel suite, or home in a vacation resort.\n\nClub dues and membership fees.\n\nYou can’t deduct dues (including initiation fees) for membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purposes.\n\nThis rule applies to any membership organization if one of its principal purposes is either:\n\nTo conduct entertainment activities for members or their guests; or\n\nTo provide members or their guests with access to entertainment facilities, discussed later.\n\nThe purposes and activities of a club, not its name, will determine whether or not you can deduct the dues. You can’t deduct dues paid to:\n\nCountry clubs,\n\nGolf and athletic clubs,\n\nAirline clubs,\n\nHotel clubs, and\n\nClubs operated to provide meals under circumstances generally considered to be conducive to business discussions.\n\nGift or entertainment.\n\nAny item that might be considered either a gift or entertainment will generally be considered entertainment. However, if you give a customer packaged food or beverages that you intend the customer to use at a later date, treat it as a gift.\n\nMeals\n\nAs discussed above, entertainment expenses are generally nondeductible. However, you may continue to deduct 50% of the cost of business meals if you (or an employee) is present and the food or beverages are not considered lavish or extravagant. The meals may be provided to a current or potential business customer, client, consultant, or similar business contact.\n\nFood and beverages that are provided during entertainment events are not considered entertainment if purchased separately from the entertainment, or if the cost of the food and beverages is stated separately from the cost of the entertainment on one or more bills, invoices, or receipts. However, the entertainment disallowance rule may not be circumvented through inflating the amount charged for food and beverages.\n\nOther rules for meals and entertainment expenses.\n\nAny allowed expense must be ordinary and necessary. An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your trade or business. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your business. An expense doesn't have to be required to be considered necessary. Expenses must not be lavish or extravagant. An expense isn't considered lavish or extravagant if it is reasonable based on the facts and circumstances.\n\nExamples.\n\nFor each example, assume that the food and beverage expenses are ordinary and necessary expenses under section 162(a) paid or incurred during the tax year in carrying on a trade or business and are not lavish or extravagant under the circumstances. Also assume that the taxpayer and the business contact are not engaged in a trade or business that has any relation to the entertainment activity.\n\nExample 1.\n\nTaxpayer A invites B, a business contact, to a baseball game. A purchases tickets for A and B to attend the game. While at the game, A buys hot dogs and drinks for A and B. The baseball game is entertainment as defined in Regulations section 1.274-11(b)(1)(i) and, thus, the cost of the game tickets is an entertainment expense and is not deductible by A. The cost of the hot dogs and drinks, which are purchased separately from the game tickets, is not an entertainment expense and is not subject to the section 274(a)(1) disallowance. Therefore, A may deduct 50% of the expenses associated with the hot dogs and drinks purchased at the game.\n\nExample 2.\n\nTaxpayer C invites D, a business contact, to a basketball game. C purchases tickets for C and D to attend the game in a suite, where they have access to food and beverages. The cost of the basketball game tickets, as stated on the invoice, includes the food and beverages. The basketball game is entertainment as defined in Regulations section 1.274-11(b)(1)(i) and, thus, the cost of the game tickets is an entertainment expense and is not deductible by C. The cost of the food and beverages, which are not purchased separately from the game tickets, is not stated separately on the invoice. Thus, the cost of the food and beverages is also an entertainment expense that is subject to the section 274(a)(1) disallowance. Therefore, C may not deduct any of the expenses associated with the basketball game.\n\nExample 3.\n\nAssume the same facts as in Example 2, except that the invoice for the basketball game tickets separately states the cost of the food and beverages. As in Example 2, the basketball game is entertainment as defined in Regulations section 1.274-2(b)(1)(i) and, thus, the cost of the game tickets, other than the cost of the food and beverages, is an entertainment expense and is not deductible by C. However, the cost of the food and beverages, which is stated separately on the invoice for the game tickets, is not an entertainment expense and is not subject to the section 274(a)(1) disallowance. Therefore, C may deduct 50% of the expenses associated with the food and beverages provided at the game.\n\n50% Limit\n\nIn general, you can deduct only 50% of your business-related meal expenses, unless an exception applies. (If you are subject to the Department of Transportation's “hours of service” limits, you can deduct 80% of your business-related meal expenses. See Individuals subject to hours of service limits, later.)\n\nThe 50% limit applies to employees or their employers, and to self-employed persons (including independent contractors) or their clients, depending on whether the expenses are reimbursed.\n\nExamples of meals might include:\n\nMeals while traveling away from home (whether eating alone or with others) on business, or\n\nMeal at a business convention or business league meeting.\n\nFigure A. Does the 50% Limit Apply to Your Expenses?\n\nThere are exceptions to these rules. See Exceptions to the 50% Limit for Meals, later.\n\nFigure A. Does the 50% Limit Apply to Your Expenses?\n\nFigure A. Does the 50% Limit Apply to Your Expenses?\n\nSummary: This is a flowchart used to determine if employees and self-employed persons need to put a 50% limit on their business expense deductions.\n\nStart\n\nThis is the starting of the flowchart.\n\nDecision (1)\n\nWere your meal and entertainment expenses reimbursed? (Count only reimbursements your employer didn’t include in box 1 of your Form W-2. If self-employed, count only reimbursements from clients or customers that aren’t included on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income.)\n\nIF Yes Continue To Decision (2) IF No Continue To Process (a)\n\nDecision (2)\n\nIf an employee, did you adequately account to your employer under an accountable plan? If self-employed, did you provide the payer with adequate records? (See Chapter 6.)\n\nIF Yes Continue To Decision (3) IF No Continue To Process (a)\n\nDecision (3)\n\nDid your expenses exceed the reimbursement?\n\nIF Yes Continue To Decision (4) IF No Continue To Process (b)\n\nDecision (4)\n\nFOR the amount reimbursed... Continue To Process (b) FOR the excess amount... Continue To Process (a)\n\nProcess (a)\n\nYour meal and entertainment expenses are NOT subject to the limitations. However, since the reimbursement wasn’t treated as wages or as other taxable income, you can’t deduct the expenses.\n\nContinue To End\n\nProcess (b)\n\nYour nonentertainment meal expenses ARE subject to the 50% limit. Your entertainment expenses are nondeductible.\n\nContinue To End\n\nEnd\n\nThis is the ending of the flowchart.\n\nPlease click here for the text description of the image.\n\nCosts to include or exclude.\n\nTaxes and tips relating to a business meal are included as a cost of the meal and are subject to the 50% limit. However, the cost of transportation to and from the meal is not treated as part of the cost and would not be subject to the limit.\n\nApplication of 50% limit.\n\nThe 50% limit on meal expenses applies if the expense is otherwise deductible and isn’t covered by one of the exceptions discussed later. Figure A can help you determine if the 50% limit applies to you.\n\nThe 50% limit also applies to certain meal expenses that aren’t business related. It applies to meal expenses you have for the production of income, including rental or royalty income. It also applies to the cost of meals included in deductible educational expenses.\n\nWhen to apply the 50% limit.\n\nThe 50% limit will apply after determining the amount that would otherwise qualify for a deduction. You first have to determine the amount of meal expenses that would be deductible under the other rules discussed in this publication.\n\nTaking turns paying for meals.\n\nIf a group of business acquaintances takes turns picking up each others' meal checks primarily for personal reasons, without regard to whether any business purposes are served, no member of the group can deduct any part of the expense.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou spend $200 (including tax and tip) for a business meal. If $110 of that amount isn’t allowable because it is lavish and extravagant, the remaining $90 is subject to the 50% limit. Your deduction can’t be more than $45 (50% (0.50) × $90).\n\nExample 2.\n\nYou purchase two tickets to a concert for $200 for you and your client. Your deduction is zero because no deduction is allowed for entertainment expenses.\n\nException to the 50% Limit for Meals\n\nYour meal expense isn’t subject to the 50% limit if the expense meets one of the following exceptions.\n\n1—Expenses treated as compensation.\n\nIn general, expenses for goods, services, and facilities, to the extent the expenses are treated by the taxpayer, with respect to entertainment, amusement, or recreation, as compensation to an employee and as wages to the employee for tax purposes.\n\n2—Employee's reimbursed expenses.\n\nIf you are an employee, you aren’t subject to the 50% limit on expenses for which your employer reimburses you under an accountable plan. Accountable plans are discussed in chapter 6.\n\n3—Self-employed reimbursed expenses.\n\nIf you are self-employed, your deductible meal expenses aren’t subject to the 50% limit if all of the following requirements are met.\n\nYou have these expenses as an independent contractor.\n\nYour customer or client reimburses you or gives you an allowance for these expenses in connection with services you perform.\n\nYou provide adequate records of these expenses to your customer or client. (See chapter 5.)\n\nIn this case, your client or customer is subject to the 50% limit on the expenses.\n\nExample.\n\nYou are a self-employed attorney who adequately accounts for meal expenses to a client who reimburses you for these expenses. You aren’t subject to the limitation on meal expenses. If the client can deduct the expenses, the client is subject to the 50% limit.\n\nIf you (as an independent contractor) have expenses for meals related to providing services for a client but don’t adequately account for and seek reimbursement from the client for those expenses, you are subject to the 50% limit on non-entertainment-related meals and the entertainment-related meal expenses are nondeductible to you.\n\n4—Recreational expenses for employees.\n\nYou aren't subject to the 50% limit for expenses for recreational, social, or similar activities (including facilities) such as a holiday party or a summer picnic.\n\n5—Advertising expenses.\n\nYou aren’t subject to the 50% limit if you provide meals to the general public as a means of advertising or promoting goodwill in the community. For example, neither the expense of sponsoring a television or radio show nor the expense of distributing free food and beverages to the general public is subject to the 50% limit.\n\n6—Sale of meals.\n\nYou aren’t subject to the 50% limit if you actually sell meals to the public. For example, if you run a restaurant, your expense for the food you furnish to your customers isn’t subject to the 50% limit.\n\nIndividuals subject to “hours of service” limits.\n\nYou can deduct a higher percentage of your meal expenses while traveling away from your tax home if the meals take place during or incident to any period subject to the Department of Transportation's “hours of service” limits. The percentage is 80%.\n\nIndividuals subject to the Department of Transportation's “hours of service” limits include the following persons.\n\nCertain air transportation workers (such as pilots, crew, dispatchers, mechanics, and control tower operators) who are under Federal Aviation Administration regulations.\n\nInterstate truck operators and bus drivers who are under Department of Transportation regulations.\n\nCertain railroad employees (such as engineers, conductors, train crews, dispatchers, and control operations personnel) who are under Federal Railroad Administration regulations.\n\nCertain merchant mariners who are under Coast Guard regulations.\n\n. The temporary 100-percent deduction for expenses that were paid or incurred after December 31, 2020, and before January 1, 2023, for food or beverages provided by a restaurant has expired. Generally, the 50% deduction continues to apply. See 50% Limit, earlier..\n\n3. Gifts\n\nIf you give gifts in the course of your trade or business, you may be able to deduct all or part of the cost. This chapter explains the limits and rules for deducting the costs of gifts.\n\n$25 limit.\n\nYou can deduct no more than $25 for business gifts you give directly or indirectly to each person during your tax year. A gift to a company that is intended for the eventual personal use or benefit of a particular person or a limited class of people will be considered an indirect gift to that particular person or to the individuals within that class of people who receive the gift.\n\nIf you give a gift to a member of a customer's family, the gift is generally considered to be an indirect gift to the customer. This rule doesn’t apply if you have a bona fide, independent business connection with that family member and the gift isn’t intended for the customer's eventual use.\n\nIf you and your spouse both give gifts, both of you are treated as one taxpayer. It doesn’t matter whether you have separate businesses, are separately employed, or whether each of you has an independent connection with the recipient. If a partnership gives gifts, the partnership and the partners are treated as one taxpayer.\n\nExample.\n\nYou sell products to a local company. You and your spouse gave the local company three gourmet gift baskets to thank them for their business. You and your spouse paid $80 for each gift basket, or $240 total. Three of the local company's executives took the gift baskets home for their families' use. You and your spouse have no independent business relationship with any of the executives' other family members. You and your spouse can deduct a total of $75 ($25 limit × 3) for the gift baskets.\n\nIncidental costs.\n\nIncidental costs, such as engraving on jewelry, or packaging, insuring, and mailing, are generally not included in determining the cost of a gift for purposes of the $25 limit.\n\nA cost is incidental only if it doesn’t add substantial value to the gift. For example, the cost of gift wrapping is an incidental cost. However, the purchase of an ornamental basket for packaging fruit isn’t an incidental cost if the value of the basket is substantial compared to the value of the fruit.\n\nExceptions.\n\nThe following items aren’t considered gifts for purposes of the $25 limit.\n\nAn item that costs $4 or less and:\n\nHas your name clearly and permanently imprinted on the gift, and\n\nIs one of a number of identical items you widely distribute. Examples include pens, desk sets, and plastic bags and cases.\n\nSigns, display racks, or other promotional material to be used on the business premises of the recipient.\n\nFigure B. When Are Transportation Expenses Deductible?\n\nMost employees and self-employed persons can use this chart. (Don’t use this chart if your home is your principal place of business. See Office in the home, later.)\n\nFigure B. When Are Transportation Expenses Deductible?\n\nFigure B. When Are Transportation Expenses Deductible?\n\nSummary: This illustration depicts the rules used to determine if transportation expenses are deductible.\n\nBetween home and regular or main job, Never deductible. Between home and temporary work location, Deductible if you have a regular or main job at another location. Between home and second job, Never deductible on a day off from regular or main job. Between regular or main job and temporary work location, Always deductible. Between regular or main job and second job, Always deductible. Between temporary work location and second job, Always deductible.\n\nThe image then lists definitions for words used in the graphic:\n\nHome: The place where you reside. Transportation expenses between your home and your main or regular place of work are personal commuting expenses. Regular or main job: Your principal place of business. If you have more than one job, you must determine which one is your regular or main job. Consider the time you spend at each, the activity you have at each, and the income you earn at each. Temporary work location: A place where your work assignment is realistically expected to last (and does in fact last) one year or less. Unless you have a regular place of business, you can only deduct your transportation expenses to a temporary work location outside your metropolitan area. Second job: If you regularly work at two or more places in one day, whether or not for the same employer, you can deduct your transportation expenses of getting from one workplace to another. If you don’t go directly from your first job to your second job, you can only deduct the transportation expenses of going directly from your first job to your second job. You can’t deduct your transportation costs between your home and a second job on a day off from your main job.\n\nPlease click here for the text description of the image.\n\nGift or entertainment.\n\nAny item that might be considered either a gift or entertainment will generally be considered entertainment. However, if you give a customer packaged food or beverages you intend the customer to use at a later date, treat it as a gift.\n\n. If you are entitled to a reimbursement from your employer but you don’t claim it, you can’t claim a deduction for the expenses to which that unclaimed reimbursement applies. This type of deduction is considered a miscellaneous deduction that is no longer allowable due to the suspension of miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor under section 67(a)..\n\n4. Transportation\n\nThis chapter discusses expenses you can deduct for business transportation when you aren’t traveling away from home, as defined in chapter 1. These expenses include the cost of transportation by air, rail, bus, taxi, etc., and the cost of driving and maintaining your car.\n\nTransportation expenses include the ordinary and necessary costs of all of the following.\n\nGetting from one workplace to another in the course of your business or profession when you are traveling within the city or general area that is your tax home. Tax home is defined in chapter 1.\n\nVisiting clients or customers.\n\nGoing to a business meeting away from your regular workplace.\n\nGetting from your home to a temporary workplace when you have one or more regular places of work. These temporary workplaces can be either within the area of your tax home or outside that area.\n\nTransportation expenses don’t include expenses you have while traveling away from home overnight. Those expenses are travel expenses discussed in chapter 1. However, if you use your car while traveling away from home overnight, use the rules in this chapter to figure your car expense deduction. See Car Expenses, later.\n\nDaily transportation expenses you incur while traveling from home to one or more regular places of business are generally nondeductible commuting expenses. However, there may be exceptions to this general rule. You can deduct daily transportation expenses incurred going between your residence and a temporary work station outside the metropolitan area where you live. Also, daily transportation expenses can be deducted if (1) you have one or more regular work locations away from your residence; or (2) your residence is your principal place of business and you incur expenses going between the residence and another work location in the same trade or business, regardless of whether the work is temporary or permanent and regardless of the distance.\n\n. If you are entitled to a reimbursement from your employer but you don’t claim it, you can’t claim a deduction for the expenses to which that unclaimed reimbursement applies. This type of deduction is considered a miscellaneous deduction that is no longer allowable due to the suspension of miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor under section 67(a)..\n\nIllustration of transportation expenses.\n\nFigure B above illustrates the rules that apply for deducting transportation expenses when you have a regular or main job away from your home. You may want to refer to it when deciding whether you can deduct your transportation expenses.\n\nTemporary work location.\n\nIf you have one or more regular work locations away from your home and you commute to a temporary work location in the same trade or business, you can deduct the expenses of the daily round-trip transportation between your home and the temporary location, regardless of distance.\n\nIf your employment at a work location is realistically expected to last (and does in fact last) for 1 year or less, the employment is temporary unless there are facts and circumstances that would indicate otherwise.\n\nIf your employment at a work location is realistically expected to last for more than 1 year or if there is no realistic expectation that the employment will last for 1 year or less, the employment isn’t temporary, regardless of whether it actually lasts for more than 1 year.\n\nIf employment at a work location initially is realistically expected to last for 1 year or less, but at some later date the employment is realistically expected to last more than 1 year, that employment will be treated as temporary (unless there are facts and circumstances that would indicate otherwise) until your expectation changes. It won’t be treated as temporary after the date you determine it will last more than 1 year.\n\nIf the temporary work location is beyond the general area of your regular place of work and you stay overnight, you are traveling away from home. You may have deductible travel expenses, as discussed in chapter 1.\n\nNo regular place of work.\n\nIf you have no regular place of work but ordinarily work in the metropolitan area where you live, you can deduct daily transportation costs between home and a temporary work site outside that metropolitan area.\n\nGenerally, a metropolitan area includes the area within the city limits and the suburbs that are considered part of that metropolitan area.\n\nYou can’t deduct daily transportation costs between your home and temporary work sites within your metropolitan area. These are nondeductible commuting expenses.\n\nTwo places of work.\n\nIf you work at two places in 1 day, whether or not for the same employer, you can deduct the expense of getting from one workplace to the other. However, if for some personal reason you don’t go directly from one location to the other, you can’t deduct more than the amount it would have cost you to go directly from the first location to the second.\n\nTransportation expenses you have in going between home and a part-time job on a day off from your main job are commuting expenses. You can’t deduct them.\n\nArmed Forces reservists.\n\nA meeting of an Armed Forces reserve unit is a second place of business if the meeting is held on a day on which you work at your regular job. You can deduct the expense of getting from one workplace to the other as just discussed under Two places of work.\n\nYou usually can’t deduct the expense if the reserve meeting is held on a day on which you don’t work at your regular job. In this case, your transportation is generally a nondeductible commuting expense. However, you can deduct your transportation expenses if the location of the meeting is temporary and you have one or more regular places of work.\n\nIf you ordinarily work in a particular metropolitan area but not at any specific location and the reserve meeting is held at a temporary location outside that metropolitan area, you can deduct your transportation expenses.\n\nIf you travel away from home overnight to attend a guard or reserve meeting, you can deduct your travel expenses. These expenses are discussed in chapter 1.\n\nIf you travel more than 100 miles away from home in connection with your performance of services as a member of the reserves, you may be able to deduct some of your reserve-related travel costs as an adjustment to gross income rather than as an itemized deduction. For more information, see Armed Forces Reservists Traveling More Than 100 Miles From Home under Special Rules in chapter 6.\n\nCommuting expenses.\n\nYou can’t deduct the costs of taking a bus, trolley, subway, or taxi, or of driving a car between your home and your main or regular place of work. These costs are personal commuting expenses. You can’t deduct commuting expenses no matter how far your home is from your regular place of work. You can’t deduct commuting expenses even if you work during the commuting trip.\n\nExample.\n\nYou sometimes use your cell phone to make business calls while commuting to and from work. Sometimes business associates ride with you to and from work, and you have a business discussion in the car. These activities don’t change the trip from personal to business. You can’t deduct your commuting expenses.\n\nParking fees.\n\nFees you pay to park your car at your place of business are nondeductible commuting expenses. You can, however, deduct business-related parking fees when visiting a customer or client.\n\nAdvertising display on car.\n\nPutting display material that advertises your business on your car doesn’t change the use of your car from personal use to business use. If you use this car for commuting or other personal uses, you still can’t deduct your expenses for those uses.\n\nCar pools.\n\nYou can’t deduct the cost of using your car in a nonprofit car pool. Don’t include payments you receive from the passengers in your income. These payments are considered reimbursements of your expenses. However, if you operate a car pool for a profit, you must include payments from passengers in your income. You can then deduct your car expenses (using the rules in this publication).\n\nHauling tools or instruments.\n\nHauling tools or instruments in your car while commuting to and from work doesn’t make your car expenses deductible. However, you can deduct any additional costs you have for hauling tools or instruments (such as for renting a trailer you tow with your car).\n\nUnion members' trips from a union hall.\n\nIf you get your work assignments at a union hall and then go to your place of work, the costs of getting from the union hall to your place of work are nondeductible commuting expenses. Although you need the union to get your work assignments, you are employed where you work, not where the union hall is located.\n\nOffice in the home.\n\nIf you have an office in your home that qualifies as a principal place of business, you can deduct your daily transportation costs between your home and another work location in the same trade or business. (See Pub. 587, Business Use of Your Home, for information on determining if your home office qualifies as a principal place of business.)\n\nExamples of deductible transportation.\n\nThe following examples show when you can deduct transportation expenses based on the location of your work and your home.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou regularly work in an office in the city where you live. Your employer sends you to a 1-week training session at a different office in the same city. You travel directly from your home to the training location and return each day. You can deduct the cost of your daily round-trip transportation between your home and the training location.\n\nExample 2.\n\nYour principal place of business is in your home. You can deduct the cost of round-trip transportation between your qualifying home office and your client's or customer's place of business.\n\nExample 3.\n\nYou have no regular office, and you don’t have an office in your home. In this case, the location of your first business contact inside the metropolitan area is considered your office. Transportation expenses between your home and this first contact are nondeductible commuting expenses. Transportation expenses between your last business contact and your home are also nondeductible commuting expenses. While you can’t deduct the costs of these trips, you can deduct the costs of going from one client or customer to another.\n\nCar Expenses\n\nIf you use your car for business purposes, you may be able to deduct car expenses. You can generally use one of the two following methods to figure your deductible expenses.\n\nStandard mileage rate.\n\nActual car expenses.\n\n. If you qualify to use both methods, you may want to figure your deduction both ways to see which gives you a larger deduction..\n\nThe cost of using your car as an employee, whether measured using actual expenses or the standard mileage rate, will no longer be allowed to be claimed as an unreimbursed employee travel expense as a miscellaneous itemized deduction due to the suspension of miscellaneous itemized deductions that are subject to the 2% floor under section 67(a). The suspension applies to tax years beginning after December 2017 and before January 2026. Deductions for expenses that are deductible in determining adjusted gross income are not suspended. For example, Armed Forces reservists, qualified performing artists, and fee-basis state or local government officials are allowed to deduct unreimbursed employee travel expenses as an adjustment to total income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 12.\n\nIf you use actual expenses to figure your deduction for a car you lease, there are rules that affect the amount of your lease payments you can deduct. See Leasing a Car, later.\n\nIn this publication, “car” includes a van, pickup, or panel truck. For the definition of “car” for depreciation purposes, see Car defined under Actual Car Expenses, later.\n\nStandard Mileage Rate\n\nFor 2023, the standard mileage rate for the cost of operating your car for business use is 65.5 cents ($0.655) per mile.\n\n. If you use the standard mileage rate for a year, you can’t deduct your actual car expenses for that year. You can’t deduct depreciation, lease payments, maintenance and repairs, gasoline (including gasoline taxes), oil, insurance, or vehicle registration fees. See Choosing the standard mileage rate and Standard mileage rate not allowed, later. .\n\nYou can generally use the standard mileage rate whether or not you are reimbursed and whether or not any reimbursement is more or less than the amount figured using the standard mileage rate. See chapter 6 for more information on reimbursements.\n\nChoosing the standard mileage rate.\n\nIf you want to use the standard mileage rate for a car you own, you must choose to use it in the first year the car is available for use in your business. Then, in later years, you can choose to use either the standard mileage rate or actual expenses.\n\nIf you want to use the standard mileage rate for a car you lease, you must use it for the entire lease period. For leases that began on or before December 31, 1997, the standard mileage rate must be used for the entire portion of the lease period (including renewals) that is after 1997.\n\nYou must make the choice to use the standard mileage rate by the due date (including extensions) of your return. You can’t revoke the choice. However, in later years, you can switch from the standard mileage rate to the actual expenses method. If you change to the actual expenses method in a later year, but before your car is fully depreciated, you have to estimate the remaining useful life of the car and use straight line depreciation for the car’s remaining estimated useful life, subject to depreciation limits (discussed later).\n\nFor more information about depreciation included in the standard mileage rate, see Exception under Methods of depreciation, later.\n\nStandard mileage rate not allowed.\n\nYou can’t use the standard mileage rate if you:\n\nUse five or more cars at the same time (such as in fleet operations);\n\nClaimed a depreciation deduction for the car using any method other than straight line for the car’s estimated useful life;\n\nUsed the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) (as discussed later under Depreciation Deduction);\n\nClaimed a section 179 deduction (discussed later) on the car;\n\nClaimed the special depreciation allowance on the car; or\n\nClaimed actual car expenses after 1997 for a car you leased.\n\nNote.\n\nYou can elect to use the standard mileage rate if you used a car for hire (such as a taxi) unless the standard mileage rate is otherwise not allowed, as discussed above.\n\nFive or more cars.\n\nIf you own or lease five or more cars that are used for business at the same time, you can’t use the standard mileage rate for the business use of any car. However, you may be able to deduct your actual expenses for operating each of the cars in your business. See Actual Car Expenses, later, for information on how to figure your deduction.\n\nYou aren’t using five or more cars for business at the same time if you alternate using (use at different times) the cars for business.\n\nThe following examples illustrate the rules for when you can and can’t use the standard mileage rate for five or more cars.\n\nExample 1.\n\nA salesperson owns three cars and two vans that they alternate using for calling on their customers. The salesperson can use the standard mileage rate for the business mileage of the three cars and the two vans because they don’t use them at the same time.\n\nExample 2.\n\nYou and your employees use your four pickup trucks in your landscaping business. During the year, you traded in two of your old trucks for two newer ones. You can use the standard mileage rate for the business mileage of all six of the trucks you owned during the year.\n\nExample 3.\n\nYou own a repair shop and an insurance business. You and your employees use your two pickup trucks and van for the repair shop. You alternate using your two cars for the insurance business. No one else uses the cars for business purposes. You can use the standard mileage rate for the business use of the pickup trucks, the van, and the cars because you never have more than four vehicles used for business at the same time.\n\nExample 4.\n\nYou own a car and four vans that are used in your housecleaning business.
