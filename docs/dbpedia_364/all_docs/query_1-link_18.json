        "text": "What to bring to your appointment\n\nOn the day of your appointment, please make sure you bring:\n\nYour learner permit card or full evidence-of-identity documents (External link)\n\nYour overseas licence card (if applicable)\n\nYour completed log book or have completed your hours in the myLearners app (if you’re under 21).\n\nUsing your own car\n\nYou can use your vehicle at a drive test if it meets all the below conditions:\n\nis clean, registered and in roadworthy condition\n\nhas a working primary speedometer that can be seen from the passenger seat (see below for more info on supplementary display)\n\nhas both driver and passenger side mirrors\n\nhas a functioning windscreen and rear window demister (where fitted)\n\nhas a seatbelt for all occupants\n\nis able to maintain a comfortable temperature\n\ndisplays ‘L’ plates\n\nhas working headlights\n\nhas a handbrake that the licence testing officer can operate if required. Vehicles fitted with electronic or foot operated park brakes cannot be used for solo tests\n\nhas working doors\n\nhas a normal manual transmission if you want a manual driver licence issued.\n\nIf your vehicle is not suitable, you will need to find another vehicle that meets all of these requirements. You may be able to use your instructor's vehicle.\n\nNote: VicRoads does not supply vehicles for a drive test.\n\nUnacceptable drive test vehicles\n\nThe following vehicles cannot be used in a drive test for legal, safety and practical reasons:\n\na taxi or tow truck which is licensed so that it can be only used by a Drivers Certificate (DC) or Tow Truck Driver Authority (DA) holder\n\nvehicles registered as primary producer vehicles\n\nleft hand drive vehicles (this includes heavy vehicles where the vehicle has dual controls - the driver must use the right hand side controls)\n\nvehicles carrying dangerous goods\n\nunregistered vehicles displaying 'trade plates'\n\narmoured security vehicles\n\nvehicles without a reverse gear\n\nvehicles issued with a Club Permit or Street Rod Permit\n\nvehicles fitted with Takata ‘alpha’ airbags which have not been replaced (see below).\n\nTakata airbags and drive test vehicles\n\nSome airbags made by Takata Corporation are being recalled in Australia. One type of airbag, the Takata ‘alpha’ airbag, poses a significant risk to people inside the vehicle.\n\nFrom 27 March 2019, any vehicle fitted with a Takata alpha airbag cannot be used for a VicRoads drive test.\n\nTo check if the vehicle you want to use for your drive test has a Takata alpha airbag installed, visit is my airbag safe (External link) or text Takata on 0487 AIRBAG (247224).\n\nIf you have already booked an appointment in a vehicle fitted with a Takata Alpha airbag, you can:\n\nuse different vehicle for the drive test after confirming that this vehicle is not also affected by the Takata airbag recall\n\nOR\n\nreschedule your drive test in the same vehicle after you have had the faulty Takata airbag replaced.\n\nNote: There will be no additional charges for drive tests which are rescheduled because of the Takata airbag issue.\n\nBefore you begin the on-road component of the drive test with your vehicle (or your instructor's vehicle), the licence testing officer will instruct you to:\n\nIdentify and operate the following vehicle controls:\n\nindicators\n\nwindscreen washer and wipers\n\nhorn (required to identify and operate in your own vehicle. Only required to identify in a driving instructor's vehicle)\n\nheadlights (high and low beam)\n\nhazard lights\n\nbrake lights.\n\nIdentify the handbrake.\n\nIdentify but not operate the following vehicle controls:\n\nwindscreen demister\n\nrear window demister (where fitted)\n\nhorn (required to identify and operate in your own vehicle. Only required to identify in a driving instructor's vehicle)\n\nStart the engine.\n\nIf you are unable to complete items 1 and 2, or if any of the controls are not operating correctly, you will not be permitted to take the drive test.\n\nIf you can't identify a control in item 3, you will be shown the control. If you need to use one of the controls during the test and you need help to identify it again, the drive test will end and you will be unsuccessful.\n\nStage one is designed to assess your safety as a driver in less challenging conditions. The testing officer will give you simple, clear instructions during the test (eg. at the next street, turn right). You must follow their instructions and show that you can drive safely and efficiently. If you’re unsure of an instruction, ask for it to be repeated.\n\nStage one will take about 10 minutes to complete. The testing officer will then instruct you to stop safely at the kerb while they calculate your score.\n\nIf during stage one you do anything unsafe or illegal, the drive test will end and you will be unsuccessful.\n\nStage one may include:\n\nstarting and stopping the vehicle\n\nleft and right turns at intersections\n\nchanging lanes.\n\nStage one also includes a low speed parking manoeuvre. The testing officer will instruct you to complete one of the following:\n\nreverse parallel park\n\nthree point-turn.\n\nSpeak to your driving instructor or supervising driver if you're unsure about how to do this task.\n\nIf you pass stage one of the on-road driving test, you will progress to stage two. Stage two is conducted in busier traffic and is designed to assess your ability to safely execute normal driving tasks. The testing officer will give you simple, clear instructions during the test (eg. at the next street, turn right). You must follow their instructions and show that you can drive safely and efficiently. If you’re unsure of an instruction, ask for it to be repeated.\n\nStage two will take about 20 minutes to complete.\n\nIf during stage two you do anything unsafe or illegal, the drive test will end and you will be unsuccessful.\n\nStage two may include:\n\ndriving in busy traffic\n\nchanging lanes\n\nmerging with other traffic\n\ndriving on straight and curved roads.\n\nFeedback about your results\n\nAfter you have completed the drive test, the licence testing officer will give you feedback and advise whether you are successful or unsuccessful. You will also find out if there are areas of your driving that need improvement.\n\nIf you are successful, this feedback will help you to become a safer driver. In your first year of solo driving, there is a higher risk of crashing. Use the feedback you receive after your drive test to develop safer driving skills.\n\nIf you are unsuccessful\n\nThis feedback could help you in your next attempt and suggests that you need more practice. People develop safe driving skills at different rates. Some learners need more practice than others before they are ready for the drive test.\n\nCauses of an unsuccessful result could include:\n\ncreating a dangerous situation\n\nmaking serious errors during the test\n\nshowing a pattern of risky behaviour.\n\nThere are two distinct types of serious errors:\n\nimmediate termination error\n\ncritical error.\n\nImmediate termination error\n\nYour test will end and you will be immediately unsuccessful if you do something that puts you or other road users at risk.\n\nAn immediate termination error will be recorded if you:\n\ncollide with another vehicle or fail to give way, signal, or check for other road users and someone else has to avoid a collision\n\nmount the kerb while driving\n\nexceed the speed limit by 5 km/h or more at any time\n\nexceed the speed limit by any amount for five seconds or more\n\nexceed the speed limit by any amount in a 'school' speed limit area\n\nfail to give way, signal or check for other road users, and someone else has to avoid a collision\n\nstop the car in a dangerous position\n\ndrive through a stop sign or red traffic light\n\ndisobey a direction from your testing officer or a member of the Victoria Police, or if your instructor or testing officer provides any kind of verbal or physical assistance\n\ndo anything else that creates an unsafe situation.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Drive test criteria [PDF 1.8 Mb].\n\nCritical error\n\nThis penalty is given if you do something during the drive test that could create an unsafe situation but is not an immediate danger.\n\nA critical error will be recorded if you:\n\ndrive too slowly for the conditions\n\nfail to look or signal but no evasive action is required from other road users\n\nblock a pedestrian crossing but no pedestrians are affected\n\nallow one wheel of your car to mount the kerb when parking or leaving a parking space\n\nstall your car\n\nslow and pause, but do not stop your car completely at a stop sign and other road users or pedestrians are not endangered\n\ndo something else that is potentially unsafe but that does not result in an immediate risk of collision or injury.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Drive test criteria [PDF 1.8 Mb].\n\nA supplementary display unit (an add-on speedometer or camera), excluding one that is GPS based, can be used in your drive test if it can be seen from the passenger seat.\n\nYou will need to provide verification in writing (by letter) from either the manufacturer, distributor or installer that the supplementary speedometer replicates the exact speed of the primary speedometer at all times. You must supply the tester with this information prior to the drive test.\n\nNote: Check your car manual for evidence that it replicates the exact speed if the supplementary display unit was fitted by the vehicle manufacturer.\n\nIf you pass your probationary drive test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, you can only drive vehicles with an automatic transmission during your probationary period. This condition is displayed as an ‘A’ condition on the driver licence card.\n\nAt the end of your probationary period, you can drive vehicles with a manual transmission without having to do another driving test provided the condition is not required due to a medical condition or impairment.\n\nIf you are required to drive a vehicle with an automatic transmission due to a specific medical condition, the condition will apply regardless of whether you are a probationary driver or not. This condition will be displayed as a ‘V’ condition on your driver licence and/or learner permit card.\n\nRemoving the A – Automatic transmission condition\n\nIf you have a probationary licence with an ‘A’ automatic transmission condition, the only way you can have this condition removed is to pass the drive test in a vehicle with a manual transmission.\n\nWhen you have passed the drive test and paid the licence variation fee (External link) you will be issued with a replacement driver licence card that has the ‘A’ automatic condition removed.\n\nTo book an appointment to take a drive test, call 13 11 71 or visit a VicRoads Customer Service Centre. Note: This drive test can’t be booked online.\n\nGo to driver licence and learner permit fees for more information about fees.\n\nWhen learning to drive in a manual vehicle, you must have someone with a full manual licence sitting beside you and display 'Driver Under Instruction' plates as well as your 'P' plates on the front and back of your vehicle. Driver Under Instruction plates must be 150mm x 150mm with black lettering on a yellow background."
