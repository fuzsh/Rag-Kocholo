Print-outs of online residency documents listed on Obtaining a Driver Privilege Card or Identification Privilege Card are acceptable as proof of residency.\n\nTemporary documents and photocopies of documents will not be accepted. DMV will not accept a document as proof of identity, legal presence, residency or Social Security number when there is reason to believe it is not legitimate.\n\nDocuments accepted by DMV as proof of identity, Virginia residency, and Social Security number may change without prior notice. DMV may also require additional documents. If you have official documentation not yet listed that you believe meets DMV requirements, please present it to your local DMV office for review.\n\nUpon issuance of a driver privilege card in the Commonwealth of Virginia, any driver's license, driver privilege card, commercial driver's license or identification card previously issued by another state must be surrendered and will be canceled by the issuing state.\n\nAdditional Requirements\n\nIf you are under age 18 and completing a driver education program, your parent, guardian or foster parent must list their driver's license, driver privilege card or state-issued identification card number and sign the driver education certificate of completion to certify that you have driven at least 45 hours, 15 of which occurred after sunset, and that the statements made and the information submitted on the certificate are true and correct. Certifying false statements can result in prosecution.\n\nIf you previously have been found not innocent of any offense by a juvenile and domestic relations court in Virginia or any other state, you must get approval to be licensed from that court, or a court in the city or county where you live, to be eligible for a driver privilege card.\n\nIf you or your spouse are in the military and live in on-post housing, you must provide a valid U.S. Postal Service (USPS) mailing address.

Some on-post housing, such as military barracks, may not be recognized by the USPS. If you are unsure, please check with your Unit Official Mail Manager.\n\nDuration and Fees\n\nYour first driver privilege card will expire on your birthday in the second year of the card’s validity.\n\nIf you renew your card before the expiration date, it will stay valid for another two years from the date of issuance.\n\nIf you don’t renew your card before your expiration date, you’ll have to start the application process over to get a new card.\n\nAll cards issued after your first card will be valid for two years from the date of issuance. This includes replacement cards.\n\nIt is $50 for your first driver privilege card and $50 for each renewal. A combined driver privilege card and permit is $53. See our Fee Chart for additional fees and details.\n\nReceiving Your Driver Privilege Card\n\nOnce you pass your required testing and your application is approved, you will receive a TEMPORARY driving permit and your driver privilege card will be mailed to you.\n\nIf you have moved, notify DMV right away, as USPS does not forward driver privilege cards. Mail delivery times vary. Please allow up to 15 days to receive your new card.\n\nIf you are under age 18 when your your driver privilege card is issued, you may be required to attend a court licensing ceremony with your parent or guardian to receive your license. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court in your jurisdiction will mail you a notice if you are required to attend. If the court does not require the ceremony, your privilege card will be mailed to you. See list of courts/jurisdictions requiring juvenile licensing ceremonies for more information.\n\nIf you are under age 18 when the driver privilege card is issued and are required to attend a court licensing ceremony, and you turn 18 before your ceremony you must still attend the ceremony, but your parent or guardian does not need to accompany you.\n\nDMV can deny or suspend driving privileges for persons UNDER age 18 if the juvenile meets one or more of the conditions below.\n\nThe juvenile is found delinquent by a court\n\nThe juvenile is in need of supervision\n\nThe juvenile is involved in an alcohol or drug-related offense\n\nThe juvenile needs court-assigned services or programs such as counseling\n\nAdditional Information\n\nMedical Requirements\n\nIf you are under age 18, you, a parent, or a legal guardian can submit a signed physician statement requesting indicators be placed on your driver privilege card as a means of identifying a condition/impairment to law enforcement personnel. A \"9\" will display in the restriction field on the face of the license and will be decoded on the back as follows:\n\nInsulin-dependent diabetic\n\nSpeech impairment\n\nHearing impairment\n\nIntellectual disability (IntD will display)\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD will display)\n\nTraumatic brain injury\n\nFor questions about driver fitness, see Medical and Mental Requirements.\n\nBlood Type Designation\n\nConsider displaying your blood type on your driver privilege card.\n\nDriver Privilege Card Classification\n\nYour driver privilege card will display \"D\" under the \"Class\" heading and \"9\" under \"Restrictions.\" The back of your driver privilege card will decode the classification of \"D\" as an \"Operator DL\" and \"9\" as \"Limited duration (See expiration date on front).\" A Class \"D\" driver's license allows you to operate passenger vehicles.\n\nFAQs\n\nI have a driver's license or driver privilege card from another U.S. state or jurisdiction. What testing do I need to complete to exchange it for a Virginia driver privilege card?\n\nIf you are at least AGE 16 and THREE months but UNDER age 18 and you hold a valid driver's license or driver privilege card issued by a U.S. state or territory, you must pass a vision screening test and complete an approved driver education program in Virginia or while residing in another state. The driver's education program must include a minimum of 30 classroom hours and six in-car instruction hours.\n\nIf you are age 18 or OLDER and you hold a valid driver's license issued by a U.S. state or territory, since you have already successfully tested to get a driving credential, you will only have to pass a vision screening.\n\nYou can schedule a driver's license appointment online by selecting an appointment for an “Original driver's license (no retesting).”\n\nI previously held a license in Virginia that is now expired. Can I apply for a driver privilege card?\n\nYes, you may apply for a driver privilege card if you have an expired Virginia driver's license. To get a driving credential in Virginia, you will have to pass a vision screening. If your driver's license has been expired for more than one year, you will be required to complete the knowledge and road skills tests. If you are presenting the license as proof of identity, it may not be expired for more than five years.\n\nYou may schedule a driver's license appointment online by selecting an appointment for “Driver and ID Card Services - No Testing Required.”\n\nCan I apply for a driver privilege card if I have not paid taxes in Virginia yet?\n\nNo. The requirement to have reported income from Virginia sources or be claimed as a dependent on a tax return filed in Virginia is specific language in the law authorizing the driver privilege card. DMV does not have the authority to alter requirements established by the Virginia General Assembly. To be eligible for a driver privilege card, you must either show you have reported income from Virginia sources in the past 12 months or were claimed as a dependent of someone who has.\n\nHow do DMV and the Virginia Department of Taxation work together to verify my taxes were paid?\n\nThe tax verification is completed through a secure electronic process developed by DMV and the Virginia Department of Taxation. The verification is a 'real-time' transaction and will occur immediately when you apply for a driver privilege card at a customer service center.\n\nDuring the verification process, the Department of Taxation will provide the date when your last return was accepted by the Department of Taxation. This date must be within one year of the date you are applying for a driver privilege card. For example, if you are applying for a driver privilege card on January 2, 2025, your most recent tax return must have been accepted by the Department of Taxation on or after January 2, 2024.\n\nIf I have a past traffic violation, can I still apply for a driver privilege card?\n\nYes, as long as your driving privileges are not currently suspended or revoked. Before approving any application for any driving credential, DMV confirms your driving privileges are not currently suspended or revoked in Virginia or any other U.S. jurisdiction. This includes insurance-related infractions.\n\nIf I attend a driving school, do I have to take the road skills test at DMV?\n\nNo. If you are a Virginia resident age 18 or older and have never held a license issued by any state, U.S. territory or foreign country, you may show completion of a state-approved driver education program which will include the road skills test. Doing so will waive the requirement to hold a learner's permit for at least 60 days and you will not be required to retake the road skills test at DMV. You can find more information about driver training schools, including a list of approved schools by visiting Training Schools.\n\nIf you are under the age of 18, you will be required to complete an approved driver education program. If taken in Virginia, it will include the road skills test so you will not be required to test again at DMV. However, you will be required to hold a learner’s permit for nine months.\n\nDo I need to register with the Selective Service in order to get a driver privilege card?\n\nIf you are required by federal law to register with the Selective Service and have not already done so, you must authorize DMV to send your information to the Selective Service. If you refuse, we cannot issue you a driver privilege card.\n\nGenerally, males under age 26 must register with the Selective Service.\n\nIf you are under age 18, your parent or guardian must sign your application authorizing the Selective Service to register you when you turn age 18.\n\nIf you have questions about Selective Service registration, visit the Selective Service website at sss.gov or call 847-688-6888 (TTY: 847-688-2567).\n\nHow do I make an appointment?\n\nYou may make an appointment online Monday - Friday or stop by a DMV customer service center at your convenience any day we're open."
