It translates your identification information into 10 languages â so it speaks the language even if you don't. Most countries highly recommend an International Driving Permit.\n\nAnother country cannot issue an IDP to be used in conjunction with a US driverâs license. An IDP accompaning a US driverâs license can only be issued in the USA.\n\nSee ALREADY OVERSEAS\n\nMany countries require an IDP to drive legally. Fines for driving without an IDP can be quite costly. Check countries requirements before travel.\n\nAn IDP gives you peace of mind while you're out exploring the world - even if you're not planning to drive!"
