        "text": "WHAT CAR SHOULD I DRIVE?\n\nIt all depends on your experience, but there is no wrong choice in selecting a car. For your first visit a Porsche GT3 may be overkill and you won’t use it’s full potential – but if that’s your dream we can help put together a program so you can make that come true. However – we won’t push you into a car that we think is beyond your level – we are experts in picking the perfect car for your experience level.\n\nMore often than not, your choice will be dictated by your budget, but in short, it’s hard to go wrong with a hot hatch like a Hyundai i30N or VW Golf R, especially if it’s your first time here.\n\nFWD or RWD? We recommend front wheel drive cars for your first visit, as they are more forgiving if you accidentally come in “too hot”, or give too much acceleration at the wrong time. If you have a lot of experience with rear wheel drive cars (especially on track) then this may be a more appropriate for you.\n\nManual or Automatic? Because the track is so demanding to drive coupled with managing the other cars on track, we recommend an automatic car for your first visit. This way you’re not at risk of getting the wrong gear in the middle of the corner, potentially damaging the car. If you have a lot of experience with a manual car (daily driving and especially on track), then you’re welcome to book a manual car.\n\nStandard or modified (RSR Edition)? We recommend a standard car for your first visit. Our more track-focused “RSR Edition” car options could also be eligible for real racing. They have bucket seats, harnesses (4 or 6 point belts) and a rollover cage on the inside. They include KW Clubsport suspension and Michelin Semi-Slick tires on the outside to name the most important ‘performance-related’ modifications. This means they are more capable on track, but are less progressive and less forgiving with mistakes. Again, if you have experience with driving modified cars on track, then you can gladly book one!\n\nIS THERE AN INSTRUCTOR WITH ME DURING TF?\n\nYes, it is possible for a guide to be with you in the car for your laps of the track (this is optional for entry level cars and mandatory for mid range and high end). The goal here is to familiarise you with the track, the car and the system of driving during TF. Important to note is that it is not for making you faster, it’s not driver training. During Touristenfahrten the guide/instructor is not there to slow you down but to achieve the goal of keeping you safe at all times and to blend in with sometimes very fast but also very slow traffic.\n\nFor full track training and RSRNurburg driving academy programs, this needs to be done on an exclusive private trackday.\n\nWHAT IS THE MINIMUM AGE TO RENT A CAR?\n\nOur car rentals start from 18 years of age and over. Generally, the renters age is not key but a drivers license and the right attitude is! It also depends on the sort of day (weather, traffic levels, trackday, road tour or touristenfahrten) and experience. What we need to be assured of first however is that you are up to the job. We can do this by organising some private instruction or by starting you off driving in the lower powered cars first.\n\nPassengers need to be a minimum of 16 years of age. Younger passengers will not be allowed to ride along in the cars. On trackdays, the minimum ages can vary, and each will need to be checked with the organiser, but generally it is also a minimum age of 16.\n\nTaxi Laps have a minimum age of 18 years old.\n\nFor Road Tours there is no minimum age, but those small enough to require car booster seats will need to use them. RSR does not have any child or booster seats available, so you will need to bring your own. Keep in mind that not all cars are compatible with these systems. Please ask!\n\nDO I HAVE TO PAY A DEPOSIT?\n\nMost of our cars do not require a deposit up front. A deposit is a sum of money paid before the rental, that is returned to the client upon a safe return of the car. While many of the companies who hire out cars at the Nürburgring ask for a deposit while hiring a car, for most of our cars under normal circumstances we do not require this. Exceptions to this rule may apply in certain cases:\n\nDriver age / driver behaviour or attitude\n\nCustomers that have difficulty with any of the languages we speak\n\nCustomers from non-European countries\n\nIf you book a top end supercar (required)\n\nThe deposits we ask for can range from 1.000€ to 15.000€.\n\nWhen we take a deposit, it is normally in the form of a hold on your credit card, which is released after the car is returned safely at the end of driving. We also accept cash or bank transfers as other options. Please make sure to have ability to provide a deposit if we request it.\n\nYou can drive the track in one of two ways:\n\nA. On a Touristenfahrten (Public Driving) session (TF)\n\nB. On a Trackday (TD).\n\nMost people (90% of our clients) drive the track during TF. The reason is mainly because there’s only a handful (about 20 to 25) of TD’s available each year. Then many of these TD’s sell out within 1 month after release. Also TD’s are more expensive and not everyone wants to drive a full day.\n\nTF has the reputation of a dangerous environment which is a bit unfair. There are great TF sessions and horrible TD’s and vice versa. On TF there’s no buses and few motorbikes these days (already since 2019). The level of driving has gone up every year since a few years. Here at RSR we can tell you what the good TF days and periods are. There’s never a guarantee but we can advise you the best we can because of 25 years of local knowledge.\n\nTouristenfahrten (Public Driving Sessions ) Trackdays\n\nOpen almost every day in season. (Check this link for the calendar: https://nuerburgring.de/open-hours#event-inline-12).\n\nAvailable only on specific days during the year (Maybe only 20 days in total per year!).\n\nThe circuit is never fully booked. You can always get on to the track.\n\nRestricted to people who have pre-registered. Most spaces sell out at the start of the year.\n\nFor a more casual experience (Good for just trying a few laps). A good option for when you want to do just a few laps up to a full day of driving.\n\nBetter for getting to know the circuit properly. This is the better option if you want to learn the track properly, with less traffic on the circuit.\n\nCan be empty on track (a rainy isolated Wednesday) or very busy (popular Sundays or a cluster of days). Unlimited number of people are allowed on track at the same time (350 cars and more on track on busy days!).\n\nUsually a maximum of between 150 to 250 cars, depending on the organiser.\n\nCan be done last moment (assuming we have car rentals available!).\n\nRSRNurburg can arrange entries for most of these TD’s if you book early in the year (in Jan or Feb of the going season).\n\nThe better option if you’re on a limited budget (Starting from 200€). For the track costs you pay an entry ticket per lap (Up to €35 / lap) – this can be as a part of our rental packages.\n\nEntry costs normally start from around 1000€ per day, then rental car costs are on top. You pay one entry fee for the whole day access to the track (Not paying per lap).\n\nOften, people just turn up and drive, not everyone knows the rules.\n\nDrivers have strict safety briefings, everyone must wear safety helmets.\n\nAnyone can drive (16 year olds, uncle bob, inexperienced drivers).\n\nGenerally there are more like minded drivers, people more experienced driving on track.\n\nAny road registered car is accepted (vans and station wagons too), motorbikes allowed on track at the same time (but there’s rarely any around anymore).\n\nPeople use more track focused cars, only cars are allowed (and sometimes even race cars are permitted).\n\nClosures happen, and can take up to an hour to clean up, depending on the number of accidents.\n\nClosures still happen, but rarely due to more experienced drivers and less cars on track in total. Because of this, clean up can happen quicker and more efficiently.\n\nYou have to pay for car recovery (towing) costs per km (For crashes, breakdowns).\n\nCar recovery (towing) is often included in the entry price.\n\nThese session are classed as a public road. Driving Academy Programs are not allowed, nor is training for lap times or increasing your speed on track.\n\nQuite a few of these TD’s consist of educational programs with section training or guided (lead follow) laps. Full RSRNurburg driving academy training programs are also allowed. This makes you both faster and safer at the same time.\n\nGuidance from instructors is possible with the goal being to keep you safe, and optimise the flow and manage traffic for an optimal adaption / blending in with sometimes very fast or very slow traffic.\n\nInstructors can work with you to achieve your own personal driving goals.\n\nNo continuous lapping possible. The main straight is used for lap ticket control via a gate.\n\nYou can keep lapping, no need to stop on the main straight.\n\nYou can’t use the whole Döttinger Höhe Straight, you have to stop in the middle to go through the gates again.\n\nFull use of the 2.8km long straight!\n\nOvertaking officially only on the left side (In reality: not everyone know the rules).\n\nOvertaking rules clearly defined and much more respectful on track. (Can be either side or only on one side, depending on the organiser).\n\nThis part of Germany has very distinctive seasons. This means in winter it snows, and in summer it gets reasonably warm (up to 40 degrees c / 104 degrees F). The driving season is from the middle of March until the middle of November, and the track is closed for driving outside of this.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: NÜRBURGRING DATES ARE TYPICALLY RELEASED IN FEBRUARY. You can book with an open/TBC date in our online booking system, but specific dates and times cannot be confirmed until after the schedule is released.\n\nMarch – April: Shoulder season\n\nMay – September: Main season\n\nOctober – November: Shoulder season\n\nDecember – February: Off season (No, the track doesn’t open for driving in the snow!)\n\nThe other thing to consider is: as the weather gets warmer during the main season, more people visit the ring. It can get very busy during the main season, and it’s not unusual to have a line of traffic on the track itself!\n\nInsider secret #1 is to join our newsletter and social media pages, so you can get info about the opening times for next year. You can also check our online booking system for the latest dates.\n\nInsider secret #2 is to schedule your visit for the shoulder seasons, as the weather can still be very good, with a lot less cars on the track.\n\nInsider secret #3 is to come and drive during the evening sessions on the weekdays (Monday – Thursday) as the track is quieter since most people work during the week.\n\nInsider secret #4 is to visit for multiple days in a row – that way, if the weather is a bit undesirable, or the track closes early due to an accident, you can continue driving on the next day.\n\nHOW IS THE WEATHER?\n\nThe hint is in the name: The Green Hell is green, because it rains quite often here. The track is in the middle of the Eifel mountain range, and has it’s own micro-climate, so it is possible to get all 4 seasons in one day!\n\nDuring the main season the weather is more consistently warm, but you will still get rainy days, in the main season, and nice, dry days in the shoulder and off seasons.\n\nThe track still opens when it rains. It closes when it’s too foggy to see, or if the track is icy or slippery from snow.\n\nDriving the circuit in the rain can be a good thing too! It means that there is much less traffic on the circuit, there are no motorcycles and the experienced guys won’t pass you at insane speeds. It’s a great way to learn the circuit better.\n\nAccidents happen. We’re not here to sugar coat it. The Nürburgring is considered to be the most difficult track in the world, and motorsport is inherently risky by nature. Even though there are crashes every day on the track, accidents with our rental cars happen very infrequently, since we have a very strict safety procedure and do everything we can to best prepare you for driving on the track. If you have the right attitude and approach to driving, with support from RSR you do not need to be scared!\n\nIn short, in the case of an accident – if you cause damage to the car, you pay to repair only the damage you caused. However, in the (very rare) case where a car is written off you are normally not required to pay for the whole value of the car. Instead, up to a fixed excess level that is generally set at around half of the cars replacement value (different from the current market value).\n\nIf there is any damage to the track (Barriers) or towing costs, you will need to pay these directly to the Nürburgring. If there is damage to another car, we may require a deposit for damages until fault can be established.\n\nFor a full run down of the processes and steps you can take if you want to reduce the risk, please visit the following page of our website:\n\nTrack insurance and accidents overview\n\nCAN I DRIVE MY =WEIRD OBSCURE VEHICLE= ON THE NÜRBURGRING?\n\nIf you vehicle isn’t capable of highway speeds (130kmh / 80mph), then it will most likely be refused to go on the track. So your mini scooter, modified lawnmower or Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw will not be allowed. Same with overly large vehicles like campervans or buses will be refused. Vehicles towing trailers will also be refused entry.\n\nHardcore race cars or anything not road registered will also not be allowed during the public Touristenfahrten sessions. However, they may be allowed on select Trackdays where race cars are allowed. The noise limit of the circuit needs to be observed, which is set normally at around 130dB.\n\nIn short, you will need to contact the Nürburgring directly if you want to ask about the validity of using your car on the track. They will not close the track for you to drive by yourself, or open it specially for you.\n\nThe best way to get to the Nürburgring is to fly into either Frankfurt Airport, or Cologne/Bonn airport, hire a rental car and drive across. It takes between 2 and 3 hours to drive, depending on conditions. Alternatively you can hire a taxi. Public transport is very difficult to use to get to the Nürburgring and is therefore not recommended, as then you’ll have an even more difficult time getting around once you’re here! There is no train station in Nürburg, and buses run infrequently!\n\nDo not mix up the Nürburgring with Nuremberg – they are about 5 hours drive apart!\n\nBest is to use our street address (and check the post code!):\n\nRSRNurburg\n\nAntoniusweg 1a\n\n53520 Nürburg (Also can be written as Nuerburg)\n\nGERMANY\n\nLink to RSRNurburg on Google Maps\n\nTo be sure you stay in Germany will be as comfortable as can be, we have put together a list of recommended restaurants and Hotels. We know from our own experience what the best place are to eat or sleep. If you still need advice, don’t hesitate to give us a ring.\n\nIn the local area the reality is there isn’t much more available for families to do aside from drive the track. There are shopping options available in Koblenz (45min) or Cologne (1hour 30min) and Adenau (15min). There are also few activities within a reasonable drive, see in the list below."
