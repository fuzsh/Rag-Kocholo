        "text": "IT SOUNDED UNLIKE anything my 11-year-old ears had ever heard, and I loved it. In one of the biggest automotive shifts ever conceived, my father went from a 1982 Cadillac Seville—a silver and burgundy hunchback designed to keep you as far from the driving experience as possible—to a 1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Targa. He died last month. And he’s been on my mind in a way he hasn’t since he controlled my keys and curfew. He made it to 85 despite a 30-plus-year fight with Parkinson’s. An overachieving middle child, he had two careers as different as the Seville and the 911: one as a pro soccer player in his homeland of Bolivia and a second as a neurosurgeon in the U.S. The cars he owned tell a story of the…\n\n_ SIC YOUR DOGS ON US AT: EDITORS@CARANDDRIVER.COM WHAT’S NEW You have to understand that I am never wrong. So, when I learned that Car and Driver was changing frequency, I deemed the change was the last straw. I intended to let my subscription run out. Lo and behold, the March/April 2024 issue was awesome. Tons of content, engaging format, and solid build quality. I admit being wrong. This time. —Deke Keyes Cleveland, OH I demand you renew my subscription immediately! —Peter Britt Davenport, IA Order has been restored. Please renew my subscription into infinity. —Michael Reece Fort Worth, TX Thank God you continue in printed form. My wife won’t allow me to take my smartphone into the bathroom. —George Cermak Dazed in MS My March/April issue arrived today. It’s about damned time! Great graphics, photos, font selection, and enough…\n\nMATE RIMAC HAS A COLD. But unlike Frank Sinatra in the famous Esquire profile, he’s neither sullen nor unwilling to be interviewed. On the contrary, he’s eager to talk, despite the occasional sniffle. The focus of his enthusiasm is the Bugatti Tourbillon, the second new model from the French brand since its merger with Rimac in 2021. The Tourbillon ditches the Chiron’s quad-turbo 8.0-liter W-16 for an entirely new 8.3-liter V-16 with a cross-plane crank— the 16-cylinder equivalent of a flat-plane V-8—that spins up to 9000 rpm and is good for 986 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque. Cosworth helped develop the engine, which surprisingly eschews forced induction for natural aspiration. This may seem like a step backward from the 1578-hp Chiron Super Sport. Except the Tourbillon’s powertrain story extends beyond its…\n\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN adaptive and active dampers is akin to a robot gaining sentience. Whereas an adaptive system can only change its damping in response to an input, an active system can push back against one and move the suspension, theoretically allowing for the car to leap off the ground. This summer Porsche adds an active damper system, dubbed Active Ride, to the options menus of its 2025 Taycan and 2024 Panamera E-Hybrid model lines. The German automaker says it will also continue to roll out new features that make the most of the technology’s capabilities. One possibility: using Active Ride to raise a tire off the ground to facilitate wheel changes without a jack. For now, the system’s ability to essentially smooth rough roads and drastically reduce body motions,…\n\nLIKE VIAGRA AND PROPECIA, drugs initially developed to treat heart and prostate issues and not performance concerns and hair loss, UVeye’s automated vehicle-inspection system was born from an unexpected outcome. The Israeli company originally intended its inspection tool, dubbed Helios, to serve as a homeland-security device that could scan for explosives strapped to the underside of vehicles. “We started finding more [fluid] leaks than guns or bombs,” says Yaron Saghiv, the chief marketing officer of UVeye. Consequently, the company changed its business model, shifting resources toward the automotive industry. In 2018, Škoda installed a UVeye scanner at its tech incubator in Israel. Others got onboard, and partnerships with automakers such as General Motors and Hyundai followed. Now, with UVeye’s tech scanning more than 50,000 vehicles each month, the company’s algorithms continue…\n\nROUGHLY HALF A DECADE after unveiling the limited-production 1 coupe and the mass-market 2 hatchback, Polestar is dipping its toes into the SUV space with the also uninspiringly named 3 and 4. Both models bring a new sense of style to the Swedish EV brand, but the lower-slung 4 is sure to drum up controversy. Besides ditching the wagon body style of the 3 for a sleeker fastback form, the 4 forgoes a rear window entirely. Instead, a camera serves the role previously assumed by a big piece of glass. We chatted with Polestar exterior-design manager Steve Potter to learn more about the overall design of the 4 and the rationale for nixing the rear window. C/D: From a design perspective, what makes the 4 an SUV? POTTER: It has the stance…"
