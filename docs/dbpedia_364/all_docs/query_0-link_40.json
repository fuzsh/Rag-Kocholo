        "text": "Appointments and Scheduling\n\nThe DMV administers three tests for Driver Licensing: a vision test, a knowledge test and a road test. All tests are done by appointment only. Vision and knowledge tests must be successfully completed prior to scheduling a road test. Road test availability varies between driver licensing locations. A road test may be given on the same day as a knowledge test if same-day appointments are available. If the schedule does not permit same day road testing, the applicant will be given an appointment for a different day. To schedule the initial knowledge or road test, please visit our Appointments and Services page to schedule an appointment.\n\nVision Test\n\nThe vision test will measure how clearly you see. You will be asked to look into an eye machine and read a series of letters or numbers. To pass, you must be able to read the 20/40 vision line with both eyes. If you wear glasses or contact lenses to pass the vision test, you are required to wear them at all times while driving. If you fail the vision test, you will have to visit an eye doctor to certify that you are visually capable of operating a motor vehicle.\n\nComputer-based Knowledge Test\n\nThe NH DMV uses a computer-based, automated touch screen testing system to administer all knowledge tests. The test is administered on a touch screen monitor and no special knowledge of computers is required. Every knowledge test has a time limit based upon the number of questions. If you exceed the time limit or miss too many questions, the test will automatically terminate; you may request an appointment to retest no sooner than ten days from the current date.\n\nTests are multiple choice and are specific to the license type.\n\nKnowledge tests are available in English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin, Portuguese, Farsi and American sign language\n\nAll knowledge exams require a passing grade of 80%.\n\nAll knowledge exams have an optional audio feature which can be accessed by using headphones. If you wish to take advantage of this feature, please notify the licensing representative at the time of your test.\n\nAll knowledge exams are completely random, and you will not see the same exam if you have to retake the test.\n\nAll failed exams will have to wait ten (10) calendar days before they are allowed to retest.\n\nRoad Tests\n\nAll road test vehicles must be fully registered and in safe operating condition. If the road test vehicle is required to have an inspection sticker, it must be up to date. You must have a properly licensed driver to drive the test vehicle for you to and from the testing site. That person should remain at the test site until the road test has been completed. The vehicle used for a road test must be of the proper class for the type of license you are being tested.\n\nNo person except you and the authorized Division of Motor Vehicles employee can ride in the vehicle during the road test. The average test will take 15 to 20 minutes. To pass the road test, you must be able to show you can drive a motor vehicle with good control. During the road test you will be scored on:\n\nSkill in handling the vehicle in traffic.\n\nDriving habits.\n\nWorking knowledge and understanding of traffic signs and rules of the road.\n\nHow well you physically, mentally and emotionally handle the actual stress of driving in traffic.\n\nAttitude toward driving and personal and public safety.\n\nIf you fail the road test, you must wait at least ten (10) days before you can be re-tested. If you miss your scheduled road test or cancel your test with less than 24 hours notice, then you must wait 30 days to be retested."
