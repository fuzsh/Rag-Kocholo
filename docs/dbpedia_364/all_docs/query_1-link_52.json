For more information on this program, or to report an incident, review the information below and follow the procedures for submitting a report.\n\nDriver responsibilities and authorized use\n\nYou are responsible for your vehicle’s proper use, maintenance, and protection.\n\nIn accordance with Federal Management Regulation (FMR) 102-34.235, you must obey all motor vehicle traffic laws of the state and local jurisdiction when driving a federal government vehicle, except when the duties of your position require otherwise. You are personally responsible if you are fined or otherwise penalized for an offense you commit while performing official duties.\n\nYou may not use a government motor vehicle for transportation between your residence and place of employment, unless your agency authorizes such use after making the necessary determination under 31 U.S.C. 1344 and Part 102-5."
