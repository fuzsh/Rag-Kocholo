        "text": "The practical driving test includes an eyesight check, safety questions and about 40 minutes of driving which involves a section of independent driving. You can prepare yourself by reading the information below.\n\nDriving test video\n\nDigital tests\n\nExaminers use tablets during the driving test to input the assessment information.\n\nThere is no change to the driving test or to the assessment, only to the method of capturing the information during the test.\n\nThis means if you give an email address you can have the test results emailed to you after the test and if you've passed the test, your licence will be issued automatically, if appropriate.\n\nEyesight check\n\nThe test includes an eyesight check. If you fail this, your test will not continue. The eyesight test requires you to read a number plate that is a certain distance away. For more information, visit:\n\nDriving eyesight requirements\n\nAfter the eyesight test you will be asked two vehicle safety check questions.\n\nVehicle safety questions\n\nThese are basic safety checks that a driver should carry out to make sure the vehicle is safe for use. Although some checks may involve the candidate opening the bonnet to identify where fluid levels would be checked, pupils will not be asked to touch a hot engine or physically check fluid levels.\n\nThe examiner will ask you one 'show me' question, where you'll have to show them how you would carry out a vehicle safety check. You'll also be asked one 'tell me' question, where you'll have to explain to the examiner how you would carry out the check.\n\nFor example, the examiner might ask you to identify where the windscreen washer reservoir is and tell them how you would check the windscreen washer level.\n\nIf you give the wrong answer for one or both questions, you'll be marked with one driving fault.\n\nAs vehicle technology advances, more and more vehicles are being equipped with electronic diagnostic systems. These tell the driver of the state of the engine, fluid levels and tyre pressures. It will be acceptable for a candidate to refer to the vehicle information system (if fitted) when answering questions on fluid levels or tyre pressures.\n\nYou can find source material in the Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) publication 'The official DVSA guide to driving - the essential skills' and 'The official DVSA guide to learning to drive', available online via the link below:\n\nTSO Bookstore - TSO website\n\nIf you plan to use your own vehicle at the practical driving test, there are some vehicles that can't be used for safety reasons. You'll need to check that a recall or safety notice doesn't affect the vehicle.\n\nVehicle safety questions for car tests\n\nDuring the test\n\nDuring the driving test the examiner will give you directions which you should follow. Test routes are designed to be as uniform as possible and will include a range of typical road and traffic conditions. The examiner will ask you to carry out set exercises.\n\nThroughout the test you should drive in the way your instructor has taught you. If you make a mistake, don't worry about it, it might be a less serious driving fault and may not affect your result.\n\nYou will be examined on your general driving and on one reversing exercise. The reversing exercise will be chosen from:\n\nreversing around a corner\n\nturning in the road\n\nreverse parking, either on road or into a parking bay\n\nYou will also be asked to carry out an emergency stop exercise.\n\nThe examiner will be looking for an overall safe standard of driving. You can make up to 15 driving faults and still pass the test (16 or more results in failure). However, if you commit one serious or dangerous fault you will fail the test. If at any time your examiner considers you to be a danger to other road users your test will be stopped.\n\nIndependent driving\n\nThere will be a section where candidates will be asked to drive independently. For all other parts of the test, examiners will give candidates step-by-step instructions.\n\nIn the independent driving section of the test, you'll have to drive independently by either following:\n\ntraffic signs\n\na series of directions\n\na combination of both\n\nTo help you understand where you are going when following verbal directions, the examiner will show you a diagram.\n\nMore information about independent driving is available at the following page:\n\nIndependent driving\n\nAfter the practical test\n\nWhen the driving test is over, you can call your instructor over (if they didn’t go with you on your test) so that they can hear the result and feedback with you. This feedback is useful for your ongoing development whether you have passed or failed.\n\nCandidates who give an email address and had the test conducted using a tablet can have the test results emailed to them after the test and if they've passed the test, their licence will be issued automatically, if appropriate.\n\nYou can view the guidance notes and explanation of your driving test report at the following:\n\nGuidance notes\n\nDriving test standards\n\nAll examiners are trained to carry out the test to the same standard. They do not have pass or fail quotas. As long as you show the standard required, you will pass your driving test.\n\nAdverse weather\n\nDVA does not conduct driving tests in adverse weather conditions for the safety of the candidate and the examiner.\n\nPractical driving tests are managed locally on a test by test basis, depending on local conditions which are reviewed regularly throughout the day. All attempts will be made to cancel tests beforehand. However, this is not always possible as local conditions can change quite quickly.\n\nIf your driving test is cancelled, another appointment will be arranged automatically at no further cost but compensation is not payable. You will be contacted with a new appointment date as soon as possible.\n\nIf you are unable to go to a scheduled test due to adverse weather, you can contact the online booking enquiries team at the link below:\n\nOnline booking enquiries customer support team\n\nTaking someone with you on your driving test\n\nDVA promotes the benefits of candidates having an ‘observer on test’ to give critical support for the learner and newly qualified driver’s ongoing development and lifelong learning. This involves an Approved Driving Instructor (ADI), parent or friend sitting in on the test to observe and listen to the examiner’s feedback.\n\nUsing an interpreter\n\nIf you have a driving test booked and would like an interpreter to come with you, you can have them come along with you on the test.\n\nMore useful links"
