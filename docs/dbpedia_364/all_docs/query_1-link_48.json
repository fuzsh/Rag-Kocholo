        "text": "DMV Wants You to Pass\n\nThe DMV is committed to helping you prepare for your drive test. Carefully read and study the information provided to help your chances of passing.\n\nThe DMV examiner will ride with you for the 20 min drive test to make sure that you can drive safely and obey traffic laws.\n\nThe test consists of basic actions you will encounter while driving, such as:\n\nLeft and right turns\n\nStops at controlled/uncontrolled intersections\n\nStraight line backing\n\nLane change\n\nDriving in regular street traffic\n\nDriving on the freeway (if required)\n\nStudy this brochure and the California Driver’s Handbook (DL 600). Relax and do your best.\n\nWhat to Expect?\n\nExpect to be treated with respect, fairness, and courtesy during the entire examination process. Contact the office manager if you are not.\n\nWho Takes a Drive Test?\n\nA drive test is required if you have:\n\nNever been licensed in California or any other state or you hold a driver license (DL) from a foreign country\n\nA vision-related problem\n\nA limited term DL for specified physical and mental (P&M) conditions\n\nA physical condition (except corrective lenses) for which DMV imposes a restriction or you have a restriction on your DL and request the restriction be removed\n\nAn out-of-state junior, provisional, or probationary DL\n\nBeen licensed out-of-state but do not have the DL to surrender\n\nDrive tests for DL renewals or holders of out-of-state or U.S. territory DLs are normally waived, if the DL is presented. However, DMV may require a drive test at any time.\n\nIs the Same Criteria Used in All Drive Tests?\n\nThe drive test for the noncommercial Class C (basic) DL is the same for all drivers regardless of age. An adult driver takes the same type of drive test as a teen driver. However, a driver with a P&M condition may take a different version of the drive test containing additional test elements.\n\nPreparing for Your Drive Test\n\nGet enough practice. Some drivers need more practice than others. Minors (under 18 years old) must complete 50 hours of behind-the-wheel training (10 hours must be night driving) before taking a drive test. When you practice, pretend you are taking a drive test. Ask your accompanying driver to calmly point out your mistakes. Ask questions about driving situations that confused you. When you practice, try to correct any driving errors you made before. The DMV examiner is there to ensure you demonstrate that you can handle your vehicle in regular traffic situations, not to trick you. During your drive test, the examiner will note how you obey the rules of the road and traffic signs and/or signals. They will note other areas in which you may need improvement.\n\nPractice safe driving tips. To improve your driving skills:\n\nSteer smoothly at all times.\n\nAccelerate smoothly. Do not rev the engine or make it stall.\n\nStop the vehicle gently. Start braking well ahead of where you must stop to avoid sudden movement. Know where to stop. Be aware of crosswalks. If your view is blocked at a crosswalk, move forward carefully and look both ways before entering the intersection.\n\nBe in the correct gear. Do not grind the gears. Do not coast to a stop.\n\nAlways obey the posted speed limits. If needed, reduce your speed for weather, road, and other traffic conditions. Remember to turn on your headlights if you need to use your windshield wipers in poor weather conditions.\n\nFollow at a safe distance. Use the 3-second rule. Increase your following distance in bad weather or poor visibility.\n\nKnow what the traffic signals mean and obey them at all times.\n\nUse the proper lane and start a turn from the correct lane into the correct lane.\n\nSignal for all lane changes and turns.\n\nAlways look for potential hazards (scan) and check your mirrors frequently.\n\nAlways look over the proper shoulder before making lane changes or pulling away from the curb.\n\nDrive defensively. Anticipate another driver’s errors.\n\nReview the California Driver’s Handbook (DL 600), Safe Driver Check List, videos, and sample tests. These tools provide detailed instructions on how to correctly perform the driving actions required on a drive test following laws, rules of the road, and safe driving practices.\n\nOther Test Information\n\nFor your safety, ask the examiner to show you their DMV identification (ID) badge before the test begins. Only the examiner, or other DMV authorized personnel, are permitted in the vehicle during your drive test. If you have any questions, ask the examiner before your drive test begins. During the test, the examiner will ask questions and give directions. They will not engage in general conversation.\n\nThe purpose of the drive test is to determine your skill in operating a motor vehicle in most road situations and evaluate your abilities, not the vehicle’s technology. Therefore, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) technologies, such as automated parallel parking and adaptive cruise control, are not permitted during the drive test. Vehicle safety technology, such as backup cameras and blind spot monitors, may be used on the drive test, but they are not a replacement for an actual visual check of your mirrors and blind spots and cannot solely be used on a drive test. The use of any audio or video recording device to record the interior of the vehicle is prohibited during all drive tests.\n\nTest Vehicle Requirements\n\nYour drive test vehicle must be safe to drive. Before the test, the examiner checks for:\n\n2 license plates. The rear plate must show current registration.\n\nFunctioning front and back turn signals and brake lights.\n\nA working horn designed for the vehicle.\n\nTires with no bald spots.\n\nAdequate brake pressure (you will be asked to step on the brake pedal to show it works properly).\n\nA driver’s side window that rolls down.\n\nA windshield that allows a full unobstructed field of view for you and the examiner.\n\n2 rear view mirrors. One must be on the left, outside of the vehicle.\n\nDriver and front passenger doors that open from both the inside and outside.\n\nA glove box which is securely closed.\n\nA passenger seat permanently attached to the vehicle.\n\nWorking safety belts (if the vehicle was manufactured with safety belts).\n\nWorking emergency/parking brake.\n\nYou will locate the controls for the vehicle’s headlights, windshield wipers, defroster, and emergency flashers, and demonstrate how to use the parking brake\n\nThe behind-the-wheel drive test will be rescheduled if the vehicle does not meet the above requirements or if you refuse to use your seatbelt(s) during the drive test.\n\nFinancial Responsibility\n\nYou must show that your vehicle is properly insured before the drive test begins (or the test will be postponed) by providing one of the following:\n\nA document with a liability insurance policy or surety bond number.\n\nAn assigned risk insurance card with the name of the assigned insurance company, file number, and current coverage dates.\n\nA current insurance binder or copy of an insurance policy signed or countersigned by an insurance company representative.\n\nA DMV-issued certificate of self-insurance or acknowledgment of cash deposit.\n\nA written confirmation from the insurer that the person is insured.\n\nA rental vehicle contract (the applicant must be listed on the contract as an insured driver).\n\nIf a rental vehicle is used for the drive test, the contract must not indicate drive tests are excluded.\n\nAfter Your Drive Test\n\nPossession of a DL means you have met the drive test requirements. However, in everyday driving you will have to deal with many situations you did not encounter on your drive test. The best way to deal with unexpected situations is to always use the same safe driving habits and responsible attitude you demonstrated on your drive test.\n\nIf you failed your driver test, you must wait 14 days, not including the day of failure, before taking the driving test again and pay a retest fee for each subsequent driving test."
