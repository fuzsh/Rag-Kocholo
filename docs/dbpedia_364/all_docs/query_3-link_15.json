Oral tests are offered in English and Spanish.\n\nIf the knowledge test is not available in your native language you may use an interpreter obtained by the Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) via state contract. You may request at time of your Permit appointment and MVC will arrange to secure an interpreter in your native language and pay the appropriate fees. Appointments with an interpreter are typically scheduled within four to six weeks.\n\nNote for CDL applicants: CDL knowledge tests are available in English and Spanish. The Hazmat endorsement test is available in English only.\n\nDeaf or hard of hearing options\n\nIf you are deaf or hard of hearing, you can take the knowledge test with an MVC-approved interpreter. The MVC will pay the interpreter’s fees directly associated with the knowledge test after submission of a properly completed payment voucher form. In order to qualify, the interpreter must be one of the following:\n\nCertified by the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf and listed with the New Jersey Division of the Deaf.\n\nEvaluated by the Division of the Deaf and on the approved list of that division’s interpreters."
