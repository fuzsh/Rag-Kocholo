        "text": "Driving Skills Test\n\nThe driving skills test must be completed before you can be licensed. You have three (3) options for completing your driving skills test:\n\nOption 1: Schedule the test with the Driver License Division (if you failed and need to reschedule, click here.)\n\nOption 2: Complete the test through your driver education course.\n\nOption 3: Test with a Third-Party Tester (see below for more information)\n\nIf you fail the driving skills test at the Driver License Division, you will be expected to practice before scheduling another test. You may take only one (1) driving skills test in a day. Failure to pass the driving skills test in three (3) attempts will result in paying another fee. All tests must be completed within six (6) months from the day you pay your fee.\n\nAny person may be asked to complete a driving skills test if the examiner thinks the applicant’s driving ability may be in question.\n\nIf you complete the driving skills test at your local high school or a commercial/private school/tester, the results of the test are submitted electronically to the Utah Driver License Division and entered into your driving record.\n\nDuring the Test\n\nThe driving skills test evaluates:\n\nDriving behaviors/attitudes.\n\nDemonstrates that you possess the basic skills, knowledge, and abilities to maneuver a vehicle safely in compliance with Utah State Traffic Rules and Regulations.\n\nYou understand simple English used in highway traffic and directional signs.\n\nYou are capable of following simple instructions necessary for the successful and safe completion of the driving skills test.\n\nYou must provide the vehicle for the test and it must be appropriately registered and comply with vehicle safety laws, including functioning safety belts. The vehicle may be rejected if its condition could cause harm to the examiner’s person or clothes.\n\nThe applicant and the examiner are the only occupants allowed in the vehicle during the driving skills test and you will not be asked to do anything that is against the law.\n\nThis is a partial list of items on which you may be evaluated during the driving skills test:\n\nDriving posture\n\nProper use of lanes\n\nLeft and right turns\n\nStarting and stopping\n\nParking on hills and between cars\n\nObservance of traffic signs and signals\n\nBacking\n\nU-turns\n\nSteering coordination\n\nAttention at intersections\n\nBefore your scheduled driving skills test appointment, watch this video.\n\nThird-Party Tester\n\nThird-party testers are certified to administer the driving skills test. An example of a third-party tester would be a company that provides testing for a fee. After completing a driving skills test with a third-party tester, they will submit the test results electronically to the Driver License Division. Click here for a list of available Third-Party Testers.\n\nAn applicant may not use the services of a Third-Party Tester when:\n\nIf you have a Utah driver license and have been requested to take a driving skills test by a physician, other medical professionals, or a law enforcement officer; or\n\nThe Driver License Division has requested you to complete additional hours of driver training."
