        "text": "Introduction\n\nDriver testing in Ireland is carried out by the Road Safety Authority (RSA). You must successfully complete a driving test to get a full Irish driving licence.\n\nLearning to drive and passing your test can be a significant milestone. However, the driving test can also cause stress and anxiety, and many people are uncertain about what the test involves and how they should prepare.\n\nNCT Update\n\nYou must have a valid NCT disc to sit your driving test, because one of the requirements of a driving test is to have a roadworthy vehicle. If you have an upcoming driving test appointment but you do not have a valid NCT, you need to cancel your driving test through the MyRoadSafety portal. You can reschedule your test twice without losing your fee, once you give at least 10 days’ notice.\n\nIf you're not able to get an appointment at your chosen NCT centre, you can add your vehicle to a priority list through the NCT website or phone 01 4135992. The NCT will do their best to accommodate you with a time and date that's convenient. Your car can be tested up to 90 days in advance of its test due date without affecting the expiry date of the cert.\n\nThis page aims to give practical guidance and advice on driving tests in Ireland. It includes information on:\n\nWhat you need to take a test\n\nApplying for a test\n\nPreparing for a test\n\nWhat you will be tested on\n\nAppealing a test result\n\nDriving tests waiting times\n\nCovid-19 has caused delays, so it may take some time before you will be offered an appointment.\n\nYou will be sent an invitation to book your driving test. You can use the RSA’s online driving test waiting time estimator to check wait times.\n\nAppointments are prioritised as follows:\n\nCritical frontline workers: priority customers whose request for an emergency test has been accepted.\n\nRe-tests: people who have failed their test and reapplied. There’s a 6 to 8 week gap between failing your test and being invited for a retest.\n\nEligibility and application date: the earlier you applied, the sooner you will get an appointment, provided you were eligible to sit a test at the time you applied.\n\nWhen you get your booking invitation you will have 10 days to select an appointment. If you're not ready to sit a test, that's ok, you can hold off booking and re-add yourself to the invitation queue at a later stage.\n\nYou can get more information on how to book your driving test from the RSA website.\n\nWhat do I need to take the test?\n\nBefore applying to take a driving test, you need to make sure you are eligible to be tested. To undergo driver testing in Ireland, you must:\n\nComplete all mandatory training. For car tests, this means you will need to have completed all 12 Essential Driver Training (EDT) sessions with an RSA Approved Driving Instructor (ADI). You can access details of ADIs located across the country. Similarly, to sit a motorcycle test, you will need to have completed all the Initial Basic Training (IBT) modules appropriate to the category of motorcycle you wish to drive. You can read detailed information on these requirements in the RSA’s ‘Learning to Drive’ handbook.\n\nHold a learner permit. You must hold a learner permit appropriate to the category of vehicle you wish to drive. In the case of cars, motorcycles and work vehicles, you generally cannot take a driving test for at least 6 months after getting your first learner permit. However, there are exceptions to this rule, notably for people who hold a full licence in a country (jurisdiction) with which Ireland does not have a licence exchange agreement.\n\nHave access to a representative vehicle. The law requires that any person attending for a driving test presents with a vehicle that is representative of the Licensing Category in which they wish to attain a licence to drive. The RSA has published information on representative vehicles for the driving test (PDF). Your vehicle must also be in order. Your vehicle must be roadworthy, displaying valid L-plates front and rear, valid insurance and motor tax discs, and valid original NCT disc if applicable. You can get detailed information on vehicle requirements in RSA’s ‘Checklist for Your Driving Test’ publication.\n\nHow do I apply to take a test?\n\nYou can apply and pay for your test online at RSA.ie. You will need a debit or credit card and a valid email address.\n\nAlternatively, you can download an application form for a driving test (pdf) and apply by post. You can also get a copy of the relevant form from your local Motor Taxation Office.\n\nYou must send the correct fee with your completed application form. Payment should be made online or by cheque, postal order or money order. These should be crossed and made payable to the RSA. Fees are non-refundable.\n\nTesting takes place at test centres throughout the country. Where possible, your test will be arranged for the centre you nominate on your application form.\n\nWaiting times vary from county to county, so it is advisable to apply for a test about 6 months before the expiry of your second learner permit. The test is standard and all test centres use the same testing procedures. See - driving tests waiting times above.\n\nCategory of Vehicle Fee Categories A, A2, A1, B, BE, AM and W €85 All other categories €120\n\nIf you need to cancel your driving test, you must give 10 days’ notice to get a refund of your fee. You can cancel your test online using the RSA website. If you cancel more than 2 tests, you will not be entitled to a refund and must make a new application.\n\nPreparing for and taking a test\n\nA driving test is designed to make sure that you:\n\nKnow the Rules of the Road\n\nPossess the knowledge and skill to drive competently in accordance with those rules\n\nDrive with proper regard for the safety and convenience of other road users\n\nThe test lasts about 30 to 40 minutes, depending on traffic conditions. At the beginning of the test, you will be asked technical questions about the rules of the road, the functionality of your car, and you may also be asked to point out different parts under the bonnet, such as how to check oil levels, or which part is the engine.\n\nYou will then drive about five miles in a variety of road and traffic conditions and will be examined on your practical skills.\n\nPreparing for your test\n\nTo prepare for your test you should:\n\nStudy the RSA’s Rules of the Road booklet (pdf). This publication can also be bought in hardcopy from bookshops for a fee of €5.\n\nRead the RSA’s Preparing for Your Driving Test.\n\nStudy the RSA’s Learning to Drive for car, bike, bus and truck.\n\nPractice driving as much as possible on all types of roads and in all types of traffic situations with an ADI.\n\nThe RSA have created a dedicated website, passthetest.ie which provides a range of free supporting information and instructional videos about how to pass your driving test.\n\nThe RSA have also published a useful ‘Checklist for your Driving Test’ booklet (pdf) to help you prepare for the day of your test. It provides practical details about what to expect on the day of your test and what you need to take with you to the testing centre. You can also watch a video of what will happen during the driving test itself.\n\nTechnical checks\n\nFirst you will be asked some questions on the Rules of the Road. Next, if you are doing a driving test for categories B (car), EB (car with trailer) and W (work vehicle), you must explain some technical checks.\n\nThe instructor will bring you out to your vehicle and will ask how you would carry out a technical check on three of the following: steering, horn, brakes, tyres, lights, reflectors, indicators, engine oil, coolant, and windscreen washer fluid. To get access to some of these parts, you will have to show how to open the bonnet and close it securely. The RSA has more detailed information on technical checks for all motor vehicles.\n\nIf you are doing a test for categories C1, C, EC1 and EC (truck and trucks with trailers), you will be asked how you would carry out a technical check on three of the same items above. To get access to some of these parts, you may have to open and securely close the bonnet and certain panels. You can access detailed information about getting a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for buses and trucks on the RSA website.\n\nPractical test of skills\n\nThe practical part of your test will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. The examiner will give you clear instructions throughout the test, but if you don’t understand something, ask them to repeat it.\n\nDo not panic if you make a mistake during the test. It may not be as serious as you think and it may not mean you have failed.\n\nYou will be assessed in the following situations:\n\nMoving off\n\nDriving in traffic\n\nStopping\n\nReversing round a corner\n\nPerforming a turnabout\n\nPerforming a hill start\n\nParking\n\nThe aspects of your driving that will be assessed include:\n\nRoad positioning\n\nOvertaking and passing\n\nAnticipation and observation\n\nUse of mirrors and signals\n\nProgress\n\nSpeed\n\nCompliance with traffic lights\n\nRoad signs and road markings\n\nProper use of your vehicle controls\n\nYou can also expect to make a number of left and right turns, encounter a roundabout and stop at traffic lights. At some point during your test, the examiner will ask you to demonstrate hand signals.\n\nGetting your result\n\nWhen you return to the test centre, your examiner will bring you back into the examination room to give you the result. If you pass, you will be given a Certificate of Competency, which is valid for 2 years. Once you have this certificate, you can apply for a full driving licence. If you do not apply for a full licence during the 2 year period, you will have to take your driving test again.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that a Certificate of Competency is not a licence, and a driver holding one cannot drive on a motorway, remove their ‘L’ plates or drive unaccompanied until they possess their full licence. A person granted a first full driving licence must also display ‘N’ plates on their vehicle for a period of 2 years.\n\nIf you fail your driving test, you will be given a detailed list of your mistakes. You should study the list and work on the mistakes before you sit another driving test. You will automatically get an invitation for another test in 6-8 weeks.\n\nMotorcycle driving tests\n\nThe motorcycle test is similar to that for cars and work vehicles. The RSA recommend that you prepare for your motorcycle test by studying the Rules of the Road booklet (pdf) and by practise riding as much as possible on all types of roads and in all types of traffic situations.\n\nYou can access detailed information on the motorcycle test and the motorcycle licencing system on the RSA website. The RSA have also produced several instructional videos to support learner riders in preparing for a test.\n\nTechnical checks\n\nBefore you begin the practical test of skills, the examiner will check your technical knowledge of the motorcycle. You will be asked how a technical check on 3 parts of your motorcycle would be performed. This can include, tyres, steering, brakes, chain, reflectors, indicators, lights (including dipping the headlight), oil level and emergency stop switch (if fitted).\n\nYou will also be asked to put the machine off (and back on) its stand (or side-stand). You will also be asked to move the motorcycle approximately 5 metres forward or backwards with the engine off.\n\nPractical test of skills\n\nYou will be given clear instructions before your test on the route to take. The driver tester will be following you in a car or motorcycle. In exceptional circumstances, i.e., very heavy traffic congestion, the tester may observe you on foot.\n\nMotorcycle tests will be carried out using radio controls. You will be given the radio equipment and advice on how to use it at the test centre.\n\nYou will be assessed in the following situations:\n\nMoving off\n\nRiding in traffic\n\nRiding left-hand circuits\n\nRiding right-hand circuits\n\nYou will also be required to do a U-turn within the width of the road to demonstrate that you have good control of your motorcycle in a confined space.\n\nYou will then be asked to ride slowly, at \"walking pace\" for around 50 metres to demonstrate that you have adequate control of your vehicle.\n\nGetting your result\n\nWhen you return to the test centre, your examiner will bring you back into the examination room to give you the result. If you fail your motorcycle test, you will be given a detailed list of your mistakes and must apply to take the test again at a later date.\n\nIf you pass, you will be given a Certificate of Competency, which is valid for 2 years. A Certificate of Competency is not a full licence and it does not entitle you to drive on a motorway or to carry a pillion passenger. If you fail to apply for a full licence during this 2 year period, you will have to take your driving test again.\n\nIf English is not your first language\n\nTests in the Irish language\n\nYou can apply for your driving test to be conducted through Irish. To do this, complete the Irish language version of the application form (pdf) and submit it as normal.\n\nTests for non-English speakers\n\nIf English is not your first language, you may have an interpreter go with you for the first part of the test where you answer questions on the Rules of the Road and carry out technical checks. However, your interpreter cannot be your driving instructor and they cannot go with you on the practical part of the test.\n\nTests for people with a disability\n\nYou should notify the RSA’s Driver Testing Section in advance if you:\n\nHave a severe hearing problem\n\nAre restricted in your movements or have any disability which could affect your driving\n\nDrive an adapted vehicle\n\nThis will ensure you don’t face any delays on the day of your test. Most driving test centres in Ireland are wheelchair accessible, but you should contact your selected centre in advance of your test to confirm this. You should also note that if the vehicle you use for the test is adapted to suit a disability (e.g., it has additional controls), this will be recorded on your full driving licence.\n\nDrivers with a disability are tested to the same standard and in the same way as other drivers, but the test is conducted by a specially trained examiner familiar with the techniques of disabled driving. You can access useful information on driver assessment and instruction from the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland (DDAI) website.\n\nYou can request to be tested on your knowledge of the Rules of the Road in your vehicle, rather than in the test centre, if you wish. If you have a hearing impairment, an interpreter can assist you with answering questions on the Rules of the Road. However, your interpreter must not be your driving instructor and they cannot go with you on the practical part of your test.\n\nIf you have a disability, or if you are deaf or hard of hearing, you will be given a little longer to go through the practical test of skills. However, this does not mean you are allowed to drive more slowly during your test; you need to maintain the same progress on the road as all other drivers in line with national speed limits.\n\nAppealing your test result\n\nIf you are not satisfied with the results of your driving test, it is possible to appeal. Appeals against driving test results are heard in the District Court by a judge sitting alone, without a jury.\n\nTo begin appeal proceedings, you must lodge your appeal with your local District Court Office for a fee of €25.\n\nNo financial compensation is available in driving test appeal cases. You will not get any compensation for any costs associated with either failing your test or in taking the appeal. A District Court judge can only make one of two decisions in a driving test appeal case:\n\nYour appeal is refused. The judge agrees with the decision of the driving tester that you failed your test.\n\nOr\n\nYour appeal is upheld. The judge is satisfied that your driving test was not conducted properly. You will then be offered another driving test, free of charge. If the judge directs another test to be carried out, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport must arrange to have it conducted by another tester.\n\nMore information\n\nYou can apply for your driving test online (see ‘How to apply’ above) or send your completed application form and fee to the Driver Testing Section of the RSA at the address below."
