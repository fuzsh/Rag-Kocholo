However, the driver license expires at midnight on your birthday or at midnight on the expiration date printed on your license. You are not authorized to be driving during the time it is expired.\n\nHow early can I come in to renew my ND driver license?\n\nYou can renew your North Dakota driver license up to 10 months prior to its expiration date.

Can I renew again by mail?\n\nNo, you may not renew by mail a second time unless you are Active Duty Military or a spouse of an Active Duty Military member.\n\nCan my car insurance company see my driving record?\n\nYes, if your insurance company does a record check, they will see violations within the last three years for violations with a point total of three or more.\n\nWhat do I need to do if I had a reportable motor vehicle crash and didn’t have proof of motor vehicle insurance?\n\nWhen a driver has a motor vehicle crash involving an injury, death, or property damage of at least $4,000 or more, and the department is notified that the driver did not have proof of insurance at the time of the crash, the driver must comply with the following:\n\n1. Provide evidence of liability insurance at the time of the crash, or\n\n2. Provide a notarized release of liability from each person who suffered property damage or injury in the crash, or\n\n3. File a security deposit in the amount of damages that will be held as security for one year and used to satisfy any judgment arising out of the crash, or\n\n4. File proof of financial responsibility. This may be shown by filing an SR-22 insurance form or a deposit of $25,000 cash or negotiable securities. This proof must be kept on file for one year from the date of the crash.\n\nFailure to comply with one of the options above will result in the suspension of driving privileges.\n\nWhat is an SR-22 insurance certificate?\n\nAn SR-22 insurance certificate is required for proof of financial responsibility for persons whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked for certain convictions or traffic offenses. It must be obtained from your insurance company. An SR-22 shows the department proof of insurance for the future, as required by law. It is motor vehicle liability insurance which requires the insurance company to certify coverage to the department. The insurance company must notify the department if the policy is canceled, terminated, or lapses. If the department receives notice of a canceled SR-22, the driving privileges will be suspended. An insurance card, policy, or declaration page cannot be accepted in place of the SR-22.\n\nIf I already have a REAL ID do I need to bring any documentation upon my next visit to a driver license site?\n\nYou will not need to present your Real ID documents upon your next visit.

It explains how long your driving privileges will be suspended for and why (a DUI conviction, having too many points, no insurance, etc.). It will also tell you what reinstatement requirements must be met before your driving privileges can be reinstated.\n\nWhat is the difference between suspension and revocation?\n\nIf your privileges are suspended, you will get driving privileges back after the period of suspension time has been completed and all reinstatement requirements have been met. If your driving privileges are revoked, you must complete the revocation period, meet all the reinstatement requirements, and take the written and road tests again before having valid driving privileges restored.\n\nWhat is the minor's cancellation?\n\nIf you are under the age of 18 and accumulate six or more points on your driving record or commit an alcohol-related or drug-related offense while operating a motor vehicle, your permit or license will be cancelled.
