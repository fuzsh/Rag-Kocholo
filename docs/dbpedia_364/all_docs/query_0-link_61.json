        "text": "When I moved to Spain, I’d had my US license for 15 years, and had put hundreds of thousands of miles on three different cars while traveling cross-country. I had also driven countless rental cars both in the US and Europe. I had a stellar driving record.\n\nWhen I moved to Spain I had to go through the process of getting a driver’s license from zero, as the US and Spain don’t have a bilateral agreement to allow the exchange of one license for the other. At the time, I didn’t think it would be a big deal. Having to take the written test would force me to learn the road signs and vocabulary in Spanish, which would be useful, and having to take the practical test would require that I get better at driving an automatic transmission.\n\nIt didn’t seem like it would be a problem.\n\nI’m pretty sure the expression “pride cometh before a fall” was coined by some other poor soul who assumed that the Spanish driver’s license test wouldn’t be a problem. Little did I know that the driver’s license system here has nothing to do with teaching someone to drive, and everything to do with bureaucracy.\n\nI failed the Spanish practical exam twice, spent a ton of money and lived through months of purgatory. While it is possible to get your license without losing your mind and the shirt off your back, the only way to do it is to understand the system before you begin.\n\nCan’t I Just Exchange My License for a Spanish License?\n\nThe short answer? Maybe.\n\nIf you have a valid driver’s license from an EU or European Economic Area (EEA—Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) country, yes, you can simply exchange it by making an appointment with the Traffic Department or DGT (click the option called “canje”). You have to bring a valid photo ID and an official document proving Spanish residency.\n\nIf you’re over the age of 18, you can drive in Spain with a valid driver’s license from your home country for two years if you are a citizen of the EU or the EEA, and for six months if you are a third-country national (non-EU/EEA citizen). EU and EEA citizens have to register with their Provincial Traffic Office after six months as well as take a medical exam at a Center for Recognition of Authorized Drivers, but may continue to use their license rather than change it for a Spanish one. Your license must be accompanied by an International Driving Permit if it is in a language other than Spanish.\n\nAfter these time periods have passed, you are required to obtain a Spanish driver’s license, or you could be fined for driving without a license.\n\nUntil Brexit, those licensed in the United Kingdom could also exchange their driver's license for a Spanish one, but now that the UK is no longer a part of the EU, British citizens will not be able to exchange their licenses after December 31, 2020. The rules applying to British citizens after this date have not yet been announced, but will be published on the UK government’s official website, as well as the section of the Spanish Traffic Department website dedicated specifically to UK residents in Spain.\n\nThere are a number of non-EU/EEA countries that also have bilateral license exchange agreements with the Spanish government. As of the writing of this article, the list of non-EU countries includes Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Morocco, Nicaragua, Peru, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela, Brazil, El Salvador, the Philippines, Guatemala, Serbia, Turkey, Tunisia, the Ukraine and Macedonia.\n\nHow to Get Your Spanish License\n\nIf you’re one of the lucky ones who can exchange your license, you will need to make an appointment with the Provincial Traffic Office. Bring a passport or valid national ID card, the application form, the fee form, proof of Spanish residence (such as your NIE or a recent copy of your empadronamiento), your original driver’s license to be exchanged as well as a photocopy, two recent passport-sized photographs, a written self-declaration that you haven’t been suspended from driving in another country, and a written self-declaration that you don’t hold another driving license in the same class in another country. Be prepared to turn over your original license in the exchange process.\n\nThere is a specific application form for UK citizens who want to exchange their license before the end of this year.\n\nIf you’re coming from the United States, Canada, Australia or any other country without a bilateral agreement with Spain, you can’t exchange your license. You will have to start the process from the beginning, which includes taking a theoretical exam and a practical exam conducted by the Traffic Department or DGT, taking a medical exam, and attending driving school. Your school will tell you what paperwork you will need to present at the time of the test.\n\nHow To Choose Your Driving School\n\nChoosing your driving school is the most important decision you’ll make throughout the process. Lessons at an authorized school are mandatory and choosing a good driving school is essential to passing the tests, even—perhaps especially—for experienced drivers.\n\nIf you value your sanity, do not sign up on Groupon for some (relatively) cheap driver’s school way out in the sticks. That’s what I did, thinking that preparing for the test was just a question of going through the motions, getting in some practice time, and brushing up on local laws.\n\nThat was a mistake.\n\nThe school I first attended was a nightmare. There are schools that have the reputation of deliberately setting students up to fail so that they will have to continue to pay for classes, and I am convinced that’s exactly where I ended up.\n\nThe money I paid covered two practical exams, so after failing twice, I was going to have to pay for the tests and all the paperwork all over again, as well as continue to pay for classes, as the classes I’d taken had not remotely prepared me for the exams.\n\nI was tearing my hair out, so I called a friend whose husband is an important figure in the world of Barcelona public transport. I asked if he had any advice. He recommended a driver’s school in Gràcia, which was more expensive per class, but which he said would get the job done. It was a family business, and the head of the school was told to make sure to make sure things went smoothly for me.\n\nAs Spanish correspondent for The Guardian Giles Tremlett said in his book The Ghosts of Spain, this is the country of enchufismo: It’s all about who you know.\n\nAfter four classes at the new school, I took the practical exam for a third time and passed with no issue.\n\nThe crucial difference between this school and my previous experience were that this new instructor, Xavi, taught me how to take the test, not how to “drive.” Of course, it also helped that his goal was to get me to pass the exam, not to squeeze as many classes out of me as possible.\n\nThe first time we went out for a class, he said: “You drive fine. I’d trust you with my own car. But you will still fail the test unless I show you what the instructors are looking for.”\n\nHe went on to explain that the test is not about being a safe driver and knowing the law, it’s about making the specific series of gestures that the examiner wants to see in the correct order. He also said that experienced drivers from other countries have a harder time than new students, because their driving habits may be perfectly safe in the real world but are so ingrained that it’s hard for them to adapt to the strange dance that is the Spanish practical exam.\n\nI asked him if it was just an urban legend that certain schools try to keep students in classes as long as possible, thinking that perhaps it was my pride, rather than a conspiracy, that had convinced me that that’s what had happened at the other school. He said that unfortunately, some schools did have that reputation, and the school I had gone to before had had trouble in the past as a result of similar allegations.\n\nAs we continued the practice runs, Xavi taught me exactly what to do in the test and took me along the route in Montjuïc where I would have to take the exam. He drilled me over and over on the series of steps to follow at certain kinds of stops, when entering a rotunda, when parking. Thanks to him, I finally got my Spanish license without additional drama.\n\nThe school has unfortunately closed since I got my Spanish license, but the moral of the story is to ask around. Get a recommendation from a friend or a colleague who had a positive experience and go visit the school before registering. Ask questions, like how long the classes last, what happens if you have to miss a class, if the theoretical and practical session can be scheduled back-to-back. Ask if you have to pay the full rate for Traffic Department paperwork and fees or if the school gets a discount, as prices vary widely from school to school.\n\nDo not go with the school that is cheapest or the closest to your house, go with one with stellar reviews or where the instructors make you feel comfortable and spell out exactly what you will pay and when. It will save you stress and money in the long run.\n\nWhat Kind of License Should I Get?\n\nThere are several types of driver’s licenses in Spain.\n\nA1: Motorcycles with engine power of up to 11kW and 125cc. This kind of motorcycle is more suited to urban riding or short trips outside of the city, and while it is legal to travel on the highway with a 125cc motorcycle, it is not recommended for long-distance travel on major roadways. You must be at least 16 years old to apply for this kind of license.\n\nA2: Motorcycles with engine power of up to 35kW a power-to-weight ratio of less than 0.2kW/kg. They are suitable for urban riding, long-distance trips and highway travel. You must be 18 years or older for this license.\n\nB: This is the license you’ll need to drive a car. It allows you to drive vehicles that weigh 3,500 kg or less with a maximum of nine seats. This will also allow you to drive the kinds of motorcycles covered by an A1 license, providing you’ve had your B permit for at least three years. You must be at least 18 years old.\n\nC: Vehicles that weigh more than 3,500 kg, such as commercial vehicles. You must be 21 years or older to apply for this kind of license.\n\nD: Vehicles that transport passengers, such as buses. You must be 24 years or older.\n\nAll practice classes and tests are performed in cars with a manual transmission unless you specifically request an automatic car. Most Spanish cars are standard transmission, also known as a stick shift.\n\nWhat if I Can’t Drive a Stick?\n\nYou can apply for a limited license by taking the practical part of your driver’s test on a car with an automatic transmission, but this kind of license prohibits you from driving a car with a manual transmission unless you retake your driver’s test in a “standard” car. In addition, most rental cars, trucks, and vans offered by European companies are stick shifts. Automatic cars are usually available in many rental offices, but there is significantly less selection and sometimes they run out when demand is high during tourist season.\n\nIf you don’t already know how to drive a car with a manual transmission, don’t worry. You’ll learn in the classes. In that sense, having to get your license a second time can be an educational experience if you come from a country where automatic transmissions are the norm.\n\nCan I Take the Classes and the Test in English?\n\nIf you can’t or prefer not to take the test in Spanish, there are several schools in Barcelona that offer the option to take the theoretical and practical classes in English. You can also take the theoretical exam in English, just make sure to specify your language when signing up for the theoretical test.\n\nIn some cases it may not be possible to take the practical exam in English—your best bet would be to talk to your instructor at your driving school and ask for their guidance. There are often long waiting lists to take the practical tests in urban centers like Barcelona.\n\nI would recommend taking the class and the test in Spanish if you can. It’s helpful to learn the laws and the vocabulary in Spanish, and the English translations in the preparatory materials are not always the best. However, it’s better to do it in English if your level of Spanish is not high enough to allow you to adequately prepare for and take the test.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost?\n\nGetting your license in Spain is an investment, both in terms of your time and your money.\n\nThe cost usually ranges from 700 to 2000 euros, depending on where you live and how many hours of classes you ultimately need. Barcelona, Madrid and other urban centers are more expensive than smaller cities. I ended up paying around 1,700 euros, including validating my previous driving experience (see below)\n\nYou can often find “packs” for sale on driver’s school websites that include school registration, theoretical classes, a set number of practical classes, a theoretical exam, a practical exam, a medical checkup, and all necessary paperwork. Any additional classes are paid for a la carte.\n\nYou are given a total of three chances to take both tests, so after three total attempts you’ll have to pay the fees to take them again. For example, I passed the written test with no problem, but failed the practical test twice, so I had to pay the full fee and wait nearly a month to take the practical test again.\n\nYour written test is valid for up to two years, but the results of your practical exam are only valid for six months. If either of your results expire before you complete the other part of the test, you’ll have to pay the full fee to take both again.\n\nWhat is the Written Test Like?\n\nThe theoretical test is composed of 30 questions and is taken at the Provincial Traffic Office. The exam has to be scheduled in advance, which can usually be arranged by your driving school.\n\nIn order to pass the theoretical test, you have to take classes—or do what I did and skip the class but memorize the book and take a bunch of practice tests online. My classes consisted of watching old-school instructional videos that the instructor kept starting and restarting in different places, and they were impossible to follow. The good news is that many schools have started relying heavily on online instruction, especially since the start of the global pandemic, which has required them to update some of their teaching materials.\n\nWhether or not you attend the theoretical classes, you absolutely must study from a book and/or online study materials and take online practice tests in order to pass the written part of the exam. The test questions are extremely specific and it’s easy to answer incorrectly unless you’re familiar with the testing style. Going on intuition alone, knowing traffic laws or having real-life driving experience will not get you through the written part of the test.\n\nHere’s an example of a question that I remember from the exam:\n\nWhat does this sign mean?\n\nA) Possibility of snow.\n\nB) Possibility of ice.\n\nC) Snow and Ice.\n\nD) None of the above.\n\nDoes it matter? Snow, ice, or snow and ice, isn’t the point that I should drive slower and be careful?\n\nIf you miss three or more questions on the test, you fail and have to take the test again. In the real world, all that matters is that you slow down, but in the context of the exam it does matter.\n\nIt’s important to pay attention to the wording of the question. When asked what a sign or a street marking means, there is a difference between you “should” and you “must.” Subtle differences in the use of prepositions and verbs is one of the hallmarks of the Spanish theoretical exam.\n\nAlso, be careful of the photos that accompany the questions. The photos don’t always reflect the situation that’s being framed by the question.\n\nLast tip: You are allowed to ask the instructors for clarification during the written exam. It’s up to his or her discretion to give you a hint, or not.\n\nWhat Is the Practical Test Like?\n\nYou will arrange to meet the DGT examiner in a designated spot on a date that is assigned to you, and take the test in the examiner’s car, usually accompanied by one other student. You will need a photo ID, proof of Spanish residency, a medical certificate issued by an approved medical center—your driver’s school can help you make an appointment—and a certificate from your driving instructor.\n\nThere is very little flexibility in testing schedules. If you can’t make the date and time you are assigned, you may have to wait a month to reschedule, so I would suggest moving heaven and earth to make sure you can be there at the time they give you.\n\nThe practical test lasts around 25 minutes, and can include urban driving, highway driving or both. The test is based on a points system: there are errors that will cause you to fail outright, such as running a red light, and others that are considered less significant errors. The assessment includes the instructor’s highly subjective assessment as to your readiness to handle a car on the road, which means that part of your likelihood to pass or fail on day of the test depends on the luck of the draw.\n\nWhile there are major errors that the examiner can’t and shouldn’t overlook, there are minor nuances that can be either penalized or let go at his or her discretion. Some examiners will do their best to help you, and some will do their best to make you nervous to simulate “real world conditions.”\n\nBe prepared for anything and rely on the information your driving instructor has given you in the classes.\n\nOnce You Finally Have Your Spanish License\n\nFirst, you should celebrate!\n\nOnce you’ve passed your theoretical and practical tests, you’ll receive a temporary license, which is valid until your permanent, official license arrives by mail at your driving school or place of residence. This will come with a big green “L” sign, which you have to display in the back window of your car for the first year that you drive in Spain.\n\nIf you don’t like the idea of being branded by the “L,” you can put your old license from your home country to good use. Once you have your brand-new Spanish license, you can make an appointment with the Traffic Department and apply for recognition of the validity of your previous driving experience. You have to request a certified and apostilled copy of your driving record from your home state or country along with an official translation into Spanish.\n\nWhile recognition of the existence of your previous driving record ironically does not allow you to skip the process of going through the process of getting your license again, it does mean that you won’t have to attach the conspicuous “L” to your car for the first year. It can also favorably impact your insurance if you choose to buy a car.\n\nBe careful when traveling with your new license, as some car rental companies will not allow you to rent from them unless your license is at least a year or two old, while others have no minimum.\n\nRecent Changes in Spanish Driving Law\n\nThe Spanish government has announced changes to the driving law as of November 2020, which included a number of harsher sanctions for a laundry list of infractions. Examples are severe penalties for using a mobile phone while driving, for not wearing a seatbelt, or for having radar-detecting equipment in your car in order to avoid speed traps."
