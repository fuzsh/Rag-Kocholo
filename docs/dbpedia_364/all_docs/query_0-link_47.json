In Concierge, select your rider’s preferred language when you enter their details.\n\nLet Lyft do the rest. We’ll communicate the trip info via SMS text messages or automated calls to the rider in the language selected.\n\nThe trip info will be translated. The rider will not be matched with a driver who speaks their preferred language.\n\nReady to try it out?\n\nWhen you enter rider details, you’ll see a dropdown for the rider’s preferred language. You can select Spanish, French, or Portuguese. Then, any texts or automated phone calls the rider receives from Lyft will be in the selected language.\n\nTry it today"
