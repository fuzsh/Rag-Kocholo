        "text": "How mu ch does it cost?\n\nThe state driving test is $60 per attempt. Most of our competitors charge $70 to $90 for one attempt. The state driving test is offered in our vehicles, or you can bring your own car to use for the exam. We want you to pass on the first try, so please read our best tips on \"How Do I Prepare for the Driving Test?\" page.\n\nAm I eligible to take the driving test?\n\nYou must have passed the state knowledge test within the past 2 years\n\nBe 18 years of age or older\n\nIf you are under age 18, you must have also completed a driver's ed program\n\nThat's it! You do not have to meet other requirements, even if you have unpaid fines from another state, or are reinstating your license from a suspension. You also don't need a permit or a license, as we can issue a temporary permit that is only valid for the driving test.\n\nWhat languages do you offer the driving test in?\n\nWe offer the driving test in English, and have two examiners who conduct the driving test in Spanish and Russian. For other languages, we do have the instructions pre-printed on illustrated cards. There are only five maneuvers, and most of the instructions are \"turn left, turn right\", etc. Language cards are available in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian, Spanish, Ukrainian, and Bulgarian. If you don't see your language here, please ask!\n\nWhat should I expect for the driving test?\n\nThe driving exam consists of:\n\n15-20 minutes of driving\n\n5 maneuvers (click here for videos)\n\nNo freeway driving\n\nThe examiner won't try to trick you or confuse you\n\nBest to arrive a few minutes early\n\nIf you bring your own vehicle, we'll check:\n\nCurrent registration\n\nValid insurance (must be the current policy, not an old card)\n\nBrief inspection, including turn signals, mirrors, brake lights, and headlights or windshield wipers if needed. Some items must be able to function normally, such as the driver's side window and seat belts, and the car must have sufficient tire tread plus no cracks in the windshield.\n\nWhat do I need to bring for the test?\n\n$60 for the test\n\nPhoto ID (state ID card, school ID, passport, etc.) Something issued by a government, school, or municipality is required. Please visit our page on ID requirements here.\n\nYou don't need a valid permit, as we are allowed to provide a temporary permit for the driving test. If you are using your own car for the test, you'll need to bring the registration and insurance for the car. You need it to drive anyway :)\n\nWhat do I need to know to pass?\n\n#1 - Practice! The test does not measure how good of a driver you are. It does measure your ability to avoid making technical errors for 15-20 minutes. For example, if you change lanes without using a turn signal (even if there are no other cars around), there is a point penalty. Practice the little things like signaling when you are required to, always looking where you are supposed to, and always yield the right of way correctly.\n\n#2 - Work on the important skills. Most of us are worried about parallel parking, but that is a low priority on the driving test. It's more important to practice driving at the speed limit, and stopping completely at stop signs and red lights (even if you are turning right on red).\n\n#3 - Be humble and take it seriously. The folks who do the best on the driving test are those who practice first, such as driver's ed students. The folks who struggle to pass don't take it seriously, or have been driving for 20+ years. We all develop bad habits over the years, such as not stopping completely at stop signs if there is no one around to yield to. Please do your best to remember all of the small things so you can pass on the first try! Most test takers do pass on the first attempt.\n\nClick here for videos and tips on how to pass the driving test!"
