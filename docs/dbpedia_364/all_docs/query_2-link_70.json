It also has many options for additional coverage, making it a good choice to consider when comparison shopping.\n\nIts optional Responsible Driver Plan includes accident forgiveness and minor violation forgiveness. If you upgrade to a Premier policy, you also get a decreasing deductible and a deductible waiver if your car is totaled.\n\nOffers new car replacement coverage.\n\nHas a very low level of complaints made about it to state insurance departments.\n\nMore: Travelers Car Insurance Review\n\nExpert’s Take\n\nEveryone feels safer under the red umbrella.

We’re also impressed by its top score for its collision repair claims processes and its low level of complaints.\n\nOffers gap insurance and new car replacement coverage.\n\nHas accident forgiveness and vanishing deductibles.\n\nIt’s easy to budget costs with Erie’s Rate Lock, which keeps your price the same year after year unless you make certain changes to your policy, such as adding a car.\n\nMore: Erie Car Insurance Review\n\nExpert’s Take\n\nErie is a super regional insurer and is very customer focused.\n\n– Marty Ellingsworth, advisory board member\n\nDrawbacks\n\nRates for drivers with bad credit are on the high side.\n\nOffers a poor digital experience, primarily because of its low-rated mobile app.\n\nOnly available in 12 states.\n\nTrends in Complaints and Collision Repair Quality\n\nComplaints\n\nErie’s auto insurance complaint level has fluctuated in recent years and is currently right below the industry average.\n\nCollision Repair Quality\n\nErie has gotten excellent grades from repair specialists over the past four years.

It also has a low level of complaints, which helps offset its only so-so rates for good drivers and those who have caused accidents.\n\nOffers accident forgiveness, gap insurance and a vanishing deductible.\n\nProvides nonowner car insurance and SR-22 filings.\n\nHas a pretty good average discount for teachers (13%).\n\nMore: Progressive Insurance Review\n\nExpert’s Take\n\nProgressive started decades ago with a focus on drivers with problems, so it understands how to write policies for risks other insurers don’t. Its use of data from smartphone-assisted insights is some of the best in the market to give drivers feedback on their behavior behind the wheel.\n\n– Marty Ellingsworth, advisory board member\n\nDrawbacks\n\nRates are mediocre for senior drivers and those adding a teen to a policy.\n\nGood drivers can try Progressive’s usage-based program (Snapshot) to potentially receive a decent discount. But your rates could go up if your driving score is low. Progressive says rates go up for 20% of drivers who use Snapshot.\n\nTrends in Complaints and Collision Repair Quality\n\nComplaints\n\nProgressive’s auto insurance complaint levels have consistently been below the industry average and have been going down in each year of the past three years.\n\nCollision Repair Quality\n\nProgressive has consistently received a C for collision repair over the last four years, meaning its claims processes are just average.\n\nYear Progressive’s Collision Repair Grade 2021\n\nC\n\n2022\n\nC\n\n2023\n\nC\n\n2024\n\nC\n\nStates Available In\n\nProgressive is available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGreat for Drivers With Poor Credit\n\nGeico\n\n4.2\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes.

Also:\n\nAuto-Owners’ “purchase price guarantee” pays you the original purchase price if your car is totaled within the first two years and you’re the original car owner.\n\n“Total loss to a new automobile” coverage pays to replace your car with a new one of equal value or pays out your original purchase price if your car is totaled within 90 days of purchase.\n\nNot all top-rated companies offer new car replacement coverage and the ones that do usually offer just one type.\n\nCompany Offers gap insurance Offers new car replacement\n\nYes\n\nYes, two types\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nBest Digital Experience: Geico\n\nAre car insurance companies keeping up with increasing consumer demands for a delightful digital experience? We found out by analyzing mobile app ratings and website functionality. We discovered that Geico currently has the overall best digital experience among the companies that otherwise scored well in our analysis of the best auto insurers.\n\nCompany Forbes Advisor rating for digital experience Our expert take\n\nGeico\n\n5.0 stars\n\nGeico leaves its competitors in the dust thanks to the live chat on its website, high user ratings for its mobile apps (4.7 out of 5) and online quotes. It also has a Spanish website version.\n\nProgressive\n\n4.0 stars\n\nProgressive scored well for its mobile app ratings (4.7 out of 5), helpful site search and online quotes. But there’s no Spanish version of its site or live chat.\n\nNationwide\n\n3.9 stars\n\nNationwide’s app has a good user rating (4.6 out of 5), a helpful site search and online quotes. It lacks a live chat and Spanish version.\n\nUSAA\n\n3.7 stars\n\nUSAA’s mobile app has decent user ratings (4.4 out of 5), online quotes and a good site search. But it comes up with no Spanish version and its live chat leaves a lot to be desired: There are only five pre-set questions, none of which could answer our test question about how to get policy documents.\n\nTravelers\n\n3.4 stars\n\nTravelers’ average mobile app rating (4.1 out of 5) is OK, and it has online quotes and a good site search. But like many others in our analysis, it lacks a Spanish version and online chat.\n\nErie\n\n2.2 stars\n\nErie’s mobile app fails to impress, with a low user rating (2.9 out of 5). It does have online quotes and a good site search, but it lacks online chat and a Spanish version.\n\nAuto-Owners\n\nNo stars\n\nAuto-Owners failed to earn any stars in our analysis mainly due to its lack of online quotes, a site search that is not helpful and no online chat.\n\nWestfield\n\nNo stars\n\nWestfield lacks basic digital features: No mobile app, no online quotes, no online chat and a site search that delivers poor results.\n\nExpert Tips\n\nTips for Finding the Best Car Insurance\n\nMarty Ellingsworth\n\nAdvisory Board Member\n\nPenny Gusner\n\nInsurance Senior Writer\n\nAmy Danise\n\nInsurance Managing Editor\n\nMichelle Megna\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nLes Masterson\n\nInsurance Editor\n\nJason Metz\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nShop Around Frequently\n\nWhen it comes to auto insurance shopping advice, early, often and regularly are the three watchwords to remember. I recommend making insurance shopping a regular exercise and not once a decade, when you trade in a vehicle or only when rates go up. Take advantage of all your resources—call your company to ask for discounts, use the internet to get multiple quotes, ask a local agent to describe options, and don’t forget to ask your family and neighbors.\n\nMarty Ellingsworth\n\nAdvisory Board Member\n\nDon’t Overlook Small Insurers\n\nI recommend looking at companies of all sizes when searching for the best insurance company. If you count out small insurers, you may miss out on a company that offers good coverage perks and superb rates.\n\nPenny Gusner\n\nInsurance Senior Writer\n\nBe Cautious About Usage-Based Insurance\n\nYour car insurance company might suggest you become part of a telematics program, aka usage-based auto insurance. If you like your privacy, I’d say this isn’t a good option for you. Your data could be shared with other insurers and even affect future car insurance quotes from other companies. Also, most people in usage-based programs do not drive well enough to get a discount.\n\nAmy Danise\n\nInsurance Managing Editor\n\nConfirm There’s a Mobile App\n\nIf digital experience is important to you, make sure the insurer you’re considering has a mobile app. Believe it or not, not all insurers do! I like to have the ability to show my insurance ID card from my phone, for example.\n\nMichelle Megna\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nDon’t Skimp on Liability Insurance\n\nWith an increasingly litigious society, I think it’s very important to make sure you have generous liability insurance. If you haven’t paid much attention to this line item on your declarations page, I recommend taking a look. You want enough liability insurance to equal your net worth, which is essentially what you can be sued for. Buy umbrella insurance for extra liability insurance at a good price.\n\nLes Masterson\n\nInsurance Editor\n\nConsider Rental Reimbursement Insurance\n\nI think rental reimbursement insurance is an underappreciated coverage. Car repair times have been going up. Your vehicle could easily be in the shop for a collision repair for three weeks or more, waiting to get worked on and waiting for parts. This coverage can help pay for a rental, so you’re not footing the whole bill yourself.\n\nJason Metz\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nHow Much Does Car Insurance Cost?\n\nCar insurance costs an average of $2,026 a year, based on our analysis of rates from large car insurance companies. That’s an average of $169 per month.\n\nCompany Average annual car insurance cost for good drivers Average monthly car insurance cost for good drivers\n\n$1,364\n\n$114\n\n$1,436\n\n$120\n\n$1,521\n\n$127\n\n$1,597\n\n$133\n\n$1,642\n\n$137\n\n$1,826\n\n$152\n\n$1,855\n\n$155\n\n$1,984\n\n$165\n\n$2,025\n\n$169\n\n$2,210\n\n$184\n\n$2,889\n\n$241\n\n$2,896\n\n$241\n\n$3,093\n\n$258\n\nCar Insurance Rates by State\n\nAuto insurance rates vary by state for many reasons, including the coverage limits required in each state, severe weather that leads to claims, and local costs of repair parts and labor.\n\nState Average annual full coverage cost\n\n$1,975\n\n$1,913\n\n$2,110\n\n$2,295\n\n$2,768\n\n$2,591\n\n$2,252\n\n$2,405\n\n$3,865\n\n$2,003\n\n$1,369\n\n$1,246\n\n$1,903\n\n$1,627\n\n$1,559\n\n$2,032\n\n$2,496\n\n$3,545\n\n$1,361\n\n$2,210\n\n$1,804\n\n$2,372\n\n$2,016\n\n$1,917\n\n$2,434\n\n$2,354\n\n$1,709\n\n$2,496\n\n$1,390\n\n$2,438\n\n$2,082\n\n$2,612\n\n$1,470\n\n$2,190\n\n$1,434\n\n$2,741\n\n$1,748\n\n$2,353\n\n$2,080\n\n$2,172\n\n$2,075\n\n$1,843\n\n$2,609\n\n$2,050\n\n$1,158\n\n$1,755\n\n$1,525\n\n$1,942\n\n$1,655\n\n$1,531\n\nTypes of Car Insurance\n\nKnowing the types of car insurance coverage available is important to building the best policy for your specific situation. Liability is the foundation for all auto insurance policies. From there, states vary on what is required, and there is optional coverage you may want for broader coverage.\n\nASK AN EXPERT\n\nAsk an expert\n\nWe Answer Your Questions\n\nAmy Danise\n\nInsurance Managing Editor\n\nPenny Gusner\n\nInsurance Senior Writer\n\nMichelle Megna\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nIs collision coverage part of a full coverage policy?\n\n– Chis Z., Scottsdale, Arizona\n\nYes, collision is part of a full coverage policy. A full coverage policy typically includes state-required coverage like liability insurance, plus collision and comprehensive coverage. Collision insurance pays to repair your car if it’s damaged in an accident or pays its value if your car is beyond repair.\n\nAmy Danise\n\nInsurance Managing Editor\n\nWill my car insurance cover my out-of-state road trip?\n\n– Jessie D., Ocala, Florida\n\nYes, car insurance policies generally extend your coverage when you drive out of state. A “broadening clause” activates when you drive out of state, adjusting your policy limits to comply with the auto insurance laws of the state you’re visiting. Your policy likely also extends coverage for driving in Canada, but car insurance coverage for Mexico is typically limited, if extended at all.\n\nPenny Gusner\n\nInsurance Senior Writer\n\nDoes car insurance cover the theft of my car?\n\n– John S., Oakland, California\n\nYes, if you have comprehensive coverage as part of your policy. Comprehensive coverage pays the value of your vehicle if it’s stolen and not recovered. It also pays for repairs to your vehicle if it’s damaged due to vandalism, fire, severe weather like hail or floodwaters, striking an animal or falling objects.\n\nMichelle Megna\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nMethodology\n\nTo identify the best car insurance companies we evaluated each company based on its average rates for a variety of drivers, the coverage options offered, complaints against the company and collision repair grades from auto body professionals.\n\nAuto insurance rates (50% of score): We used data from Quadrant Information Services to find average rates from each company for good drivers, drivers who have caused an accident, drivers with a speeding ticket, drivers with a DUI, drivers with poor credit, drivers caught without insurance, adding a teen driver, senior drivers and young drivers.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, rates are based on a 40-year-old female driver with a Toyota RAV4 and coverage of:\n\n$100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).\n\nUninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.\n\nCollision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.\n\nCar insurance coverage options (25% of score): Any auto insurance company can provide the basics of liability insurance, collision and comprehensive coverage and other standard offerings. But it’s also important to have access to additional coverage types that can provide greater protection or cost savings. In this category, we gave points to companies that offer accident forgiveness, new car replacement, vanishing deductibles, usage-based or pay-per-mile insurance and SR-22s.\n\nComplaints (20% of score): We used complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Each state’s department of insurance is in charge of logging and monitoring complaints against companies operating in their states. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays, and denials.\n\nThe industry complaint average is 1.00, so companies with a ratio below 1.00 have lower levels of complaints.\n\nCollision repair (5% of score): We incorporated insurance company grades from collision repair professionals. We used data provided by CRASH Network, a weekly newsletter covering the collision repair and auto insurance market segments. CRASH Network’s Insurer Report Card used grades from more than 1,100 collision repair professionals to gauge auto insurers on the quality of their collision claims service.\n\nAuto Insurance Collision Repair Grades\n\nRead more: How Forbes Advisor rates car insurance companies\n\nMethodology for Our Digital Experience Ratings\n\nOur Digital Experience ratings reflect the quality of a company’s mobile app and website.
