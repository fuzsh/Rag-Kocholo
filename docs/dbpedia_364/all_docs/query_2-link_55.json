There are two streams in engineering - 1. Academic - students wanting to do design, development and research, 2. Vocational/Practical - the 'Hands On' side, the mechanics and engineers who set the cars up, prepare the cars, rebuild them after accidents - the team members you see outside the garages doing the pitstops in F1. There is a serious shortage of suitable engineers, but particularly on the practical side. We have been advised that in July 2025 funding for the two mainstream 'motorsport' vocational qualifications is being withdrawn. We have heard that this is due to them not being able to demonstrate sufficient take up of careers in the motorsport sector. The reason for that is that they are not delivering the correct skills. SCU Motorsport undertook 10 months of research in 2019, supported by Ufi VocTech Trust, talking to race team managers and mechanics in WEC, ELMS, British GT, F4 and many other series to validate our approach. We also spoke to race car manufacturers and the supply chain and the unanimous feedback is that they would not take on students that had just completed either of the two mainstream qualifications. Why wasn't any analysis undertaken before making a decision to withdraw funding? Surely it would make more sense to understand the problem and address it - that is what SCU Motorsport have done and we constantly get feedback on our programme \"that is what is needed\". We are writing a qualification based on the feedback from the motorsport sector. We are in discussions with an awarding body for them to become our accreditation body. This is a sector that delivers £10 Billion to the UK Economy - struggling to get engineers with the right experience and skills, students who want to enter the motorsport sector and the funding to support this is being withdrawn. We will continue to develop our qualification based on the overseas interest we have. #fia #motorsporteducation Photo credit to GOV UK.\n\nFormula Student Acceleration WORLD RECORD!! 🚀 The DUT23 broke the world record for the fastest acceleration time at a Formula Student competition with a time of 2.999 seconds at Formula Student East. This was completed with a full competition spec and scrutineered car. We would like to thank once again our partners and supporters, without whom this record would never have been achieved! 💙 At the acceleration event, the car covers a distance of 75 meters from standstill, with a power limit of 80 kW. When crossing the finish line, the DUT23 was doing 122.45 km/h. With our time of 2.999 seconds, we are the first team in Formula Student history to break the 3 second barrier at a FS competition! 🏎️ For more information, please watch 'Formula Student East 2023 TV - Day 5' on YouTube (https://lnkd.in/eU2VNT9N). We would like to extend our appreciation towards the organization of Formula Student East, for letting us use their footage for this video. 🤝 - #formulastudent #fseast #fseast2023 #race #car #racecar #engineer #innovation #design #technology #development #team #f1 #formula1 #explore #sport #motorsport #electric #competition #drive #university #delft #tudelft #dut23\n\n🏁 Unbelievably gassed to announce our collaboration with Mercedes F1 🏁 Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team (MGP) is going to be powering 146 scholarships over two years with us to drive social mobility in motorsport, F1 and STEM.

It is an outstanding achievement to be selected as a finalist for one category. All at DPR Motorsport are extremely proud, that in our case, we have been selected for two categories – The Business Support Grant Award and the Sustainable Business of the Year. The Reigate & Banstead Awards celebrate the very best organisations and individuals from the local area with ten award categories to highlight success across a range of business criteria. This is now the third year for these awards and with an increasing number of entries, competition is at an all-time high. David Rowe, Engineering Director, commented: When we moved our business to Redhill some six years ago, whilst some benefits were recognisable up-front, during our time on the Holmethorpe Industrial Estate we have come to fully appreciate the benefits from a great location, a local business eco-system second to none and a pool of local youngsters keen to progress into engineering through the apprenticeship route. The original Business Grant Award enabled us to invest in a range of tools and equipment to kick-start their progress. Graduates from our tailored engineering apprenticeship pathway will have gained both the practical and academic skills required at the highest levels of UK Motorsport. We take pride that our first apprentice, who joined McLaren some years ago, is now a key member of their Formula One race team supporting the Lando Norris car. Engineering excellence is at the front and centre of everything we do. It was no contradiction to adopt sustainability as core to our workplace approach. On our initial move to Redhill, we up-cycled rather than demolished what was a run-down 1950’s workshop. The renovation focused on taking full advantage of energy saving measures such as adding modern levels of insulation to the workshop together with investing in solar PV to help transition away from fossil fuels for heat and light. Reaching two of the final shortlists for the 2023 awards is an unexpected and therefore an all-the-more appreciated recognition of our work to grow the business. Key to this growth has been developing our young staff and improving the efficiency of our operational processes. Being able to gain numerous podium and championship wins in Caterham Motorsport events at the top UK and European motorsport race circuits has no doubt been a strong motivator to all concerned! #caterhammotorsport #RBBA23 #statementofexcellence\n\n🌟 \"Motivation is fleeting - find something you enjoy\" - Dan Bigham 🌟 I've been reflecting on the journey of Dan Bigham, an engineer and Olympic cyclist, whose story epitomises the blend of passion and profession. Training for the upcoming Paris Olympics, Bigham cycled through the picturesque peaks of Andorra. It's not the scenery that gives him his unique perspective, but the choice he made years ago to balance both his career as an engineer and his passion as a cyclist. Bigham's journey is one of perseverance and innovation. From working with the Ineos Grenadiers team to founding WattShop, his path showcases an extraordinary synergy between engineering and elite sports. His love for simulations and modelling, rooted in his university days, played a key role in breaking the world hour record in cycling in 2022 - an impressive feat of riding 55.548km in 60 minutes. As he says, \"There is a causable, tangible link between the things you learn at school and breaking world records.\" In a world constantly evolving with AI advancements, Bigham's insights into the future of sports engineering are incredibly inspiring. AI's role in predicting race outcomes and sports nutrition is redefining possibilities. His advice to younger engineers resonates deeply: \"Motivation is fleeting - find something you enjoy.\" It's about perseverance, creativity, and finding joy in the journey, even when doors seem closed. 🚴♂️⚙️ #Olympic #DanBigham #EngineeringExcellence\n\nFormula Student Acceleration WORLD RECORD! 🚀 Traveling 75 meters from standstill; acceleration is one of the four dynamic events on Formula Student competitions.
