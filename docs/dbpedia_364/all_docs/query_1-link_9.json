I am not rich enough for electric cars. There arenât enough charging stations where I live or in the country where I live to where I would even think about getting an electric car. Keep the politics out of it and just give me information about cars.\n\nDonât force feed electric car garbage in these magazines. I AM paying for this magazine (which I donât plan on continuing if next months installment has electric car ads and articles) so I want to see cars I can afford, that take gasoline, that are not destroying the environment as spoiled kids keep speaking about while they take private jets to their next big lecture shaming people who own SUVâs and other vehicles.\n\nI want to read about proper cars. Get on the ball and give me articles about cars, Car and Driver. Electric cars will never grace my driveway. I will never spend a dime on these powerless atrocities."
