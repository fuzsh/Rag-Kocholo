If you completed a Stock Car Driving Experience with us 3+ years ago, you must re-complete at least a 10-Mile Stock Car Drive Experience(provided at a discounted rate of $289) prior to being eligible for this program.

Electric and Hybrid motor vehicles are not eligible(ie: Tesla).. Only certain SUV’s or Trucks will qualify- GMC Cyclone, Porsche Cayenne or Ford Lightning etc . Convertibles can not be used unless they have an approved type of roll over protection, please call Steve Fox at 877-786-2522 ext.222 to confirm if your convertible is applicable. It will also need to have a current registration, state inspection and insurance. Keep in mind that most of this program will be run at much higher speeds than you see on the highway, so you and the car you choose along with all of its components will need to be up to the task. All cars must pass an in-depth, detailed safety and technical inspection before being allowed on the racetrack. You will be emailed a link to a Tech Sheet with your confirmation along with instructions on how to get it completed. You can also Click Here for the Tech Sheet that is required to be completed and submitted on the day of your event.\n\nHOW FAST WILL I GET TO GO?\n\nWhile there is no set max speed, how fast you go usually depends on you, your car, and your driving abilities. You should realize that higher speeds will come with knowledge and experience. The first lap of each session will be under a Yellow Flag. We ask that you limit your speed to 70 MPH until the Green Flag is thrown. Under Green Flag conditions we encourage you to safely and smoothly explore the limits of your car and your skills while staying at your comfort level. Remember this is NOT a race and in the interest of safety, we will slow drivers who are demonstrating unsafe and/or irresponsible driving.\n\nHOW MUCH TRACK TIME WILL I GET?\n\nTwo 15 minute sessions on track with coaching from your Instructor between.\n\nHOW SAFE IS THIS PROGRAM, I HAVE AN EXPENSIVE CAR?\n\nVery safe, but with any racetrack activity there are inherent risks. Most of the cars used are high dollar, high-end sports and touring cars that have owners who just want a fun, safe place to open them up. Since 2009 we have run this program with zero reportable incidents.\n\nWHAT DO I NEED TO BRING WITH ME?\n\nYou will need a high-quality SA rated Auto Racing helmet, preferably full face, SA 2010 designation, or newer. If you do not have your own helmet you may rent one for $25. We also suggest anti-glare sunglasses. You will need to wear a long sleeve shirt and long pants while on-track. Wear narrow lightweight closed shoes with non-slip soles. Food and drinks are available for sale at the track; you may also bring your own.\n\nCAN I BRING FRIENDS AND FAMILY?\n\nYes! Guests are welcome to share this special experience with you, bring as many as you choose. Your guests can purchase a 3-Lap Ride in one of our 600 HP NASCAR style stock cars while you go thru your Check-In and Drivers Meeting.\n\nCAN I GET MY CAR TECH’D AT THE TRACK?\n\nNo. You will need to get your car tech’d in advance. You will be required to hand in your completed tech form at registration on the day of the event. You will be E-mailed a Tech Form along with your confirmation when you purchase your program and choose your date.

Our Photography Staff will talk with you during your class to confirm if you’d like photographs taken.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF I CRASH MY CAR?\n\nYou will need to sign a release and waiver of liability, hold harmless agreement at check-in. We are not responsible for any damage to you or your car regardless of whether this damage was caused by yourself in a single-vehicle incident or by another driver in a multi-vehicle incident. We are also not responsible for damage to your car for any reason. Check with your Insurance Company to see the limits of your coverage. Some companies might recognize this as Driver Training; most companies will not cover anything that takes place on a racetrack. Any damage to the Pocono Raceway facility will be the responsibility of the individual causing this damage during the course of this event.\n\nWHAT TIME DO I NEED TO BE THERE?\n\nCar and driver arrival time is 2:00 PM.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF IT RAINS?\n\nWe will make every effort to run your experience.
