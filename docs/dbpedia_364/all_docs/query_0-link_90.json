        "text": "Hi, friends,\n\nI am a huge Formula One fan. I haven't missed a racing weekend since 1992 and I've seen maybe half of all the races on British channels. However, I cannot say conclusively whether I have ever heard an F1 driver being called \"a pilot\". I am pretty certain that referring to an F1 driver as \"a pilot\" is the usual thing in almost every European language. Therefore, if I ever heard that said in English, I surely did not notice it. Neither did I notice the absence of that word because \"an F1 driver\" sounds just fine. This was how Pob14 caught me red-handed, unwittingly committing a verbal crime in this thread: http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=2278432\n\nSo, has anyone ever heard a racing driver being called \"a pilot\" in English?\n\nPS Go McLaren!\n\nAnd especially Jenson, Lewis being too damn aggressive!\n\nThank you both Paul and Gwan. Guilty as charged - \"pilot\" is not used to mean a racing car driver in ordinary English.\n\nBe it enacted that henceforth \"a pilot\" mean, inter alia, a racing car driver in all varieties of English for the purposes of F1 racing. Amen!\n\nI found a few uses of \"pilot\" to mean driver in the context of F1 racing, such as these pages:\n\nhttp://www.722prospect.com/tag/f1-racing\n\nhttp://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5294.html\n\nbut not many. It comes across as an unusual style, but many sports writers go in for unusual styles. They come up with odd words, such as \"cager\" for a basketball player or \"harrier\" for a cross-country runner. These are correct, but they're not terms I would suggest using.\n\nI found out something else in this search: if you search for \"pilot\" without quotes, and Google determines that your query is in an automotive context, it substitutes a search for \"driver\" - and doesn't bother to tell you! If you put the word in quotes it figures that you know what you're doing, that you meant what you wrote, and it does what you asked it to.\n\nIf someone use a vehicle goes more than 300 km/h speed it called pilot Ä±f his job to use that vehicle.\n\nI'm sorry to disagree with you, but I don't think many native English speakers would make that distinction.\n\nMany cars that one can buy today can go faster than 300 km/h (about 187 mph), though they are not inexpensive, and there are some roads on which it is legal to drive that fast. I would not call someone driving a McLaren or a Lamborghini at 310 mph on an empty section of the Autobahn a pilot.\n\nBecause \"pilot\" is the word for \"racing car driver\" in many European languages, it may have become trendy to use the word in English, as a sign that one is an insider (rather as some English-speaking cycling journalists seem to prefer the French word \"peloton\" over the English word \"bunch\"), or perhaps the non-English-speaking drivers use the word \"pilot\" in their English-language interviews, and it spread from there. I have never heard a member of the English-speaking public call a racing car driver a \"pilot\", but then I rarely discuss F1 because it does nothing for me. Journalists are a law unto themselves."
