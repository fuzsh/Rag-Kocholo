There may be people crossing where you can’t see.\n\nNever drive under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs.\n\nFollow the speed limit, especially around people on the street, in school zones and in neighborhoods where children are present.\n\nBe extra cautious when backing up and look for pedestrians.\n\n8 Walking Safety Tips\n\nFollow the rules of the road and obey signs and signals.\n\nWalk on sidewalks whenever they are available.\n\nIf there is no sidewalk, walk facing traffic and as far from traffic as possible.\n\nCross streets at crosswalks or intersections. Look for cars in all directions, including those turning left or right.\n\nIf a crosswalk or intersection is not available, locate a well-lit area where you have the best view of traffic. Wait for a gap in traffic that allows enough time to cross safely; continue watching for traffic as you cross.\n\nWatch for cars entering or exiting driveways, or backing up in parking lots.\n\nAvoid alcohol and drugs when walking; they impair your abilities and your judgment.\n\nEmbrace walking as a healthy form of transportation - get up, get out and get moving.\n\nPedestrian Bystander Care\n\nFinding and Creating Walkable Communities\n\nResident's Guide for Creating Safe and Walkable Communities\n\nWant to improve the walkability of your neighborhood?
