        "text": "What is an International Driver’s Permit?\n\nAn IDP is proof that you hold a valid driver’s license in your own country. It also provides a translation into almost a dozen languages so that police and other authorities in other countries can read your license in their own language.\n\nThe IDP is a special license authorized by United Nations conventions on road safety. Nearly 180 countries are signatories.\n\nThe process for obtaining an IDP varies by the issuing country. Contact the agency that granted your driver’s license, such as the department of transportation or department of state, to ask about the process. Do your research to make sure that the entity you are working with to obtain an IDP is reputable. Verify the source with a government agency, if possible.\n\nThe issuing authority will require you to submit two passport-style photos and fill out an official form. To be eligible, you must be at least 18 years old and have a valid driver’s license in your home country. You will not be required to take a driving test, but there is a small fee for the license."
