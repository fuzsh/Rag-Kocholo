        "text": "Who can drive here?\n\nTo drive a car or motorcycle in New York State, you must\n\nbe at least 16 years old and\n\nhave a valid New York State driver license or learner permit, or\n\na valid driver license or permit issued by another state or country\n\nIf you have a New York State learner permit or one issued in another state, you must follow New York State permit restrictions.\n\nIf you are under age 18, you must obey New York's Graduated License Law.\n\nResidents of New York\n\nIf you become a New York State resident, you must get a New York State driver license within 30 days. If you have a valid driver license issued by another U.S. state or territory, federal district or Canadian province, you may be eligible to exchange it for a New York driver license (see Exchange an out-of-state license), or see other information about moving to New York.\n\nIf your license was issued outside the U.S. or Canada, you must apply for a new original New York State driver license at a DMV office (see Get a driver license). When you pass your road test, you must give your foreign driver license to the DMV road test examiner.\n\nDefinition of \"Resident\"\n\nSection 250 (5) of the NY State Vehicle and Traffic Law says:\n\nAs used in this section, the term \"resident\" shall mean domiciliary, that is, one who lives in this state with the intention of making it a fixed and permanent abode. It shall be presumptive evidence that a person who maintains a place of abode in this state for a period of at least ninety days is a resident of this state.\n\nTo live in a house, a home, an apartment, a room or other similar place in New York State for 90 days is considered \"presumptive evidence\" that you are a resident of New York State. A police officer can use this as evidence to issue a traffic ticket if you drive in New York State without a New York State driver license or vehicle registration.\n\nA judge considers the law and the evidence of your intent and decides if you are a resident of New York State. If you pay taxes or your children attend school in another state, a judge considers these facts to decide if your intent is to make New York a \"fixed and permanent\" residence. According to this law, students from other states or from other nations who attend school in New York State are usually not considered residents of New York. DMV does not decide if you are a resident of New York State, if you must get a New York State driver license, or if you must register your vehicle in New York State.\n\nNon-residents\n\nOut-of-state and foreign driver licenses\n\nYou can drive in New York State with a valid driver license from another state or country. You don’t need to apply for a New York State driver license unless you become a New York State resident.\n\nIf you have a driver license from another country you do not need to have an International Driving Permit, but it is helpful. The permit verifies in several languages that you have a valid driver license. Police officers who can’t read the language on your foreign driver license will be able to read the permit. Contact the authorities in your home country to get an International Driving Permit.\n\nVisitors from other countries\n\nIf you have a driver license from any nation, you do not need a New York State license to drive here. You should only apply for a New York State driver license if you become a resident of New York State."
