        "text": "You can drive in New York State with a valid driver license from another country. You do not need to apply for a New York State driver license unless you become a New York State resident.\n\nTo get a New York State driver license, you must pass a written test, complete a five-hour pre-licensing course, and pass a road test.\n\nWhen you pass your road test, you must give your foreign driver license to the DMV road test examiner.\n\nYou do not need to be a US Citizen to get a New York driver license, permit or non-driver ID card.\n\nNew York offers three types of ID documents; standard licenses and IDs, REAL IDs, and Enhanced licenses and IDs. Non citizens are eligible for standard IDs. Non citizens who can provide proof of lawful presence are eligible for REAL IDs. However, only US Citizens are eligible for Enhanced IDs.\n\nDriving With a Foreign Driver License\n\nYour valid foreign driver license allows you to drive without a supervising driver. You can drive on any street, road, highway, bridge, or tunnel, except in a DMV road test area.\n\nIf your driver license is printed in any language except English, you must bring an International Driving Permit or a certified translation of your driver license to the road test. The translation must be certified by a consulate, the US Department of State, or another official agency. The translation must include\n\nyour name\n\nyour date of birth\n\nthe expiration date of your foreign driver license\n\na list of the types of vehicles that your foreign driver license allows you to drive\n\nIf you have a NY State learner permit, and you do not have a valid foreign driver license, NY State law requires a supervising driver to ride with you. The supervising driver must be age 21 or over and must have a valid driver license to operate the vehicle that you drive.\n\nTemporary Visitors\n\nA Temporary Visitor is defined as anyone who is not immigrating to or not permanently residing (living) in the United States. These visitors have US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) documentation that supports their legal status in this country.\n\nIf you have DHS documents that identify you as a Temporary Visitor and have a REAL ID, your New York State driver license, permit or non-driver ID card will have\n\n'TEMPORARY VISITOR' on it, and\n\nthe expiration date from your DHS document\n\nPlease note that if you have a REAL ID, the document will expire on the same date as your Temporary Visitor date. If you have a standard Non-Driver ID or a Commercial Driverâ€™s License, the document will not expire on the Temporary Visitor expiration date.\n\nIf your temporary visitor status gets extended, you must bring it to a DMV office\n\na completed Application for Permit, Driver License or Non-Driver ID Card (PDF) (MV-44)\n\nyour updated paperwork from the DHS (your documents must be valid, current and verifiable)\n\nRenewing your license\n\nAs long as the Temporary Visitor status that DMV has on file is not expired you can renew your license online, through the mail or in an office.\n\nIf your Temporary Visitor status has been extended, you must go to a DMV office with your updated paperwork from the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS). We will update our records to show that your Temporary Visitor status has been extended so you can renew your license. Your new license will have your new temporary visitor expiration date."
