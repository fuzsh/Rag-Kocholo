        "text": "If you’re planning to drive in Costa Rica, it’s important to learn about the driving culture. So in this guide I will tell you exactly what it’s like to drive in Costa Rica and give you my local tips to stay safe while driving in Costa Rica as a tourist. Also make sure to read our renting a car in Costa Rica guide and get our Costa Rica car rental discount!\n\nImportant Things to Know About Driving in Costa Rica\n\nCosta Rica drives on the right side of the road (just like USA and Canada).\n\nTraffic signs are in Spanish and use the same/similar shapes as USA and Canada (like the red octagon for stop).\n\nCosta Rica uses the metric system so speed limits are in kilometers and gas tanks are in liters.\n\nThe normal speed limit on the highway is 90 Km/h (~55 mph).\n\nForeigners can drive in Costa Rica with a valid original driver’s license and their original passport with a valid tourist stamp. Tourists must have their original passport and valid original driver’s license with them when they drive. They can only drive for as long as their tourist visa is valid. Temporary licenses and paper driver license copies are not accepted.\n\nThe legal driving age is 18 in Costa Rica. For car rentals, the minimum age to rent a car will vary depending on the agency. Usually it is 21 – 23 years old.\n\nDefensive driving is the best way to drive safely in Costa Rica.\n\nCosta Rica Road Signs\n\nAll the road signs are in Spanish. They use the same symbols, but it’s always good to familiarize yourself with the Spanish words. Here are the most common signs you’ll see.\n\nAlto – stop. Is also a red octagon\n\nVelocidad maxima – maximum speed. Remember they use kilometers so you’ll see KPH\n\nCeda el paso – yield. Is also a red and white triangle\n\nPuente angosto – narrow bridge\n\nDesvio – detour\n\nDespacio – slow\n\nCruce de monos – monkey crossing (or some other animal, they will put a picture of it)\n\nUna via – one way\n\nCarretera en mal estado – road in bad condition\n\nPuente en mal estado – bridge in bad condition\n\nNo estacionar – no parking\n\nCurvas peligrosas adelante – dangerous curves ahead\n\nNo hay paso – don’t enter\n\nNo virar en u – no U turns\n\nCalle sin salida – dead end\n\nTarifa liviano – lightweight fare (you will see this at the toll boths)\n\nDriving in Cities vs Rural Areas in Costa Rica\n\nRoad conditions will depend on what part of the country you are in. Driving in the city is different than the countryside, below you can see what it is like.\n\nCity Roads\n\nYou will find that in the Central Valley and bigger cities like San Jose, Heredia, Liberia, Cartago, Puntarenas and Alajuela. Roads are paved, most with painted lines but not all.\n\nSmaller cities and touristic beach towns like San Ramon, Grecia, Turrialba, Zarcero, Jaco, Manuel Antonio, La Fortuna, Tamarindo, Playas del Coco and Puerto Viejo all have paved main roads, though not necessarily any painted lanes.\n\nHowever, one thing that you will not see too much here are traffic lights and sidewalks once you are out of the capital city of San Jose.\n\nThen in San Jose, there are roundabouts but it can get kind of crazy as everyone goes when they can and there are no painted lines within the roundabout. It’s a bit like a free for all, just go when you can as most people don’t yield or use blinkers. The driving culture is a bit impatient, so don’t freak out if people start honking at you while you are waiting to enter the roundabout. It is better to take your time than try to rush.\n\nYou also need to be careful on freeways because roads can end with no warning. Then you’ll have to merge with little space. They have speed bumps here but they don’t always have the reflective lane markers or signs.\n\nTraffic in the City/San Jose\n\nMore than 1.5 million Costa Ricans live and work in San Jose, representing almost half of the total population in the country. Therefore the main roads are always packed during rush hour.\n\nOne of the best tips for driving in Costa Rica is to avoid driving in the cities during rush hour which is 3-6 PM and 5-8 AM Monday through Friday. But if you have to drive during those times, make sure to be super alert and drive very defensively.\n\nDon’t get road rage because you will get honked at, people will cut you off and drivers won’t yield for you.\n\nCity driving is always a bit of a mess with lots of traffic, regardless which capital city you are in the world. However due to the poorer infrastructure and shoddy road conditions, there are some things you need to be extremely aware and careful about when driving in Costa Rica.\n\nExamples\n\nHere are some pictures I took from one of our drives through San Jose so you can get an idea of what it’s like. Most of the drivers (but not all of them) act like the ones in the pictures below. My intention is to not to discourage you to drive but to show you the truth so you are aware of what it’s like.\n\nSometimes in San Jose, you may need to drive a bit assertive or else you will be waiting forever to turn left or to cross the street. Drivers here are not used to yielding and giving space even if you put your blinker on, so you may need to squeeze yourself in (but do it carefully).\n\nHighways and Freeways\n\nCosta Rica has both highways and freeways but they don’t look exactly quite like the ones in other countries. Many of them have only one lane or 1-2 lanes for a short period of time.\n\nThe nicest highway, Interamericana Highway 1 underwent construction a few years ago and now has two lanes in both directions and are very nicely done. Most of the other freeways in Costa Rica have just 1 lane and no shoulders.\n\nFarming areas/rural areas\n\nIn rural areas, usually just the main road is paved with marked lines and all other roads are not. Additionally, they don’t usually have sidewalks and are one lane.\n\nThe nice thing about driving in rural areas is that you will not find as many cars or as much traffic as San Jose. However, you will find other obstacles such as chickens, cows, kids, bicyclists, motorcycles and people walking on the road.\n\nSince there aren’t really sidewalks, you will need to be careful if there are people walking/biking on the side of the road. As roads are usually narrower and smaller, it is not always possible to give them a full 6 feet of room when passing them. Bike lanes are not common in Costa Rica.\n\nAdditionally, in farming areas, be very aware that there may be animals on the side of the road. You may see herds of cows and horses in the middle of the road! In places like Puerto Viejo and Dominical, there may even be sloths crossing the road so be super careful.\n\nExamples\n\nHere are some examples of rural/farm roads and the driving.\n\nOnce you leave the GAM (San Jose/Alajuela/Heredia/Cartago), you will find mostly rural and farming road. There will also be less traffic on the intercity roads but it is very common to have traffic on the highways since most of them only have 1 lane.\n\nBe Prepared for Anything and Everything\n\nOne of the most important things to know about driving in Costa Rica is to drive defensively and be prepared. Be prepared for unexpected traffic, be prepared for animals crossing the road, be prepared for people walking in the middle at night with no reflexive lights.\n\nAdditionally, you need to look up the road conditions in Costa Rica to see which type of car you need. Always research to see if you need a 4×4 or 4wd or a high clearance car for your destinations.\n\nIf you want to see what it’s like to drive in Costa Rica, we have made lots of driving videos on our Youtube channel!\n\nTips for Driving in Costa Rica for the First Time\n\nHere are our personal tips for driving in Costa Rica for first timers.\n\nDo not EVER drink and drive or do drugs and drive. If you are caught driving under the influence, no insurance will cover this and you will get in big trouble (tickets/jail time/etc.) BE A RESPONSIBLE TOURIST IN ANOTHER COUNTRY!\n\nThere isn’t really a thing as a 4 or 3 way stop. All the stops are normal as in you have to stop and then you can go.\n\nLock your doors while driving.\n\nIf you get a flat tire (not covered in insurance), go to a mechanic or gas station to change it. Then drive to your rental car company’s closest office to get a new tire.\n\nKnow that right of way is more like a suggestion in Costa Rica. Many local drivers do not follow it.\n\nIf you are driving in a parking lot and you see a car in front of you backing out, they may not stop even if they see you. Local drivers don’t really give the right of way to the car already driving.\n\nIf you’re on the highway and you’re going to change lanes, your blinker will mean almost nothing to other drivers. Make sure to look 3 times before you do.\n\nIf you are being tailgated, don’t speed up or try to Fast and the Furious the other drive. Tailgating is so normal here. Just let them do their thing and pass you.\n\nPedestrians are not used to cars stopping for them when crossing the road. Don’t be scared if you see a pedestrian getting close to your car or if it looks like they are about to walk into your car.\n\nIf you stop to let pedestrians/animals cross the road, be aware of the cars behind you. They might not know that someone is crossing so they could pass you and hit the pedestrian. If you stop or brake suddenly, turn on your emergency lights to signal the driver behind you.\n\nIf you’re at a busy intersection trying to turn left, be very careful. Other drivers may completely ignore you and just try to jam themselves in front without using their blinker or checking. A lot of drivers will jump the line.\n\nPassing\n\nBecause many roads have only one lane, you may get stuck behind a semi-trailer truck or a slow car. In these situations, you may need to pass the car ahead of you.\n\nHowever, if you do not feel comfortable passing, do not do it. Only pass when you are comfortable and are 1000% sure the road is clear. If you are going to pass, double check the coast is clear and use your blinkers.\n\nFurthermore, if the car in front of you starts to pass, do not blindly follow them. There may be a car coming in fast from the other direction. Always check that it’s clear before you go.\n\nAlso note that before you pass, the car behind you may try to overtake you so check your mirrors before going.\n\nSpeed Limits and Speeding\n\nThere are speed limit signs but locals don’t really adhere to them, especially outside the city. However, as a tourist, we recommend to follow the speed limits in Costa Rica. If the car behinds you starts to tailgate you, just let them pass.\n\nPolice do give speeding tickets and they are super expensive in Costa Rica (can be on average around $300-400 USD a ticket).\n\nWhat happens if you get a driving ticket in Costa Rica? If you receive a parking ticket, speeding ticket or any time of driving violation ticket, you must pay the ticket to the car rental company you rented your vehicle with. You can do this during your rental or when you return the car. The car rental company will give you a receipt and voucher for proof of payment.\n\nRiver Crossing\n\nThere are some places in Costa Rica where a river crossing may be required in the rainy season. This is more in the rural, off road areas like in the Nicoya Peninsula, Drake Bay and Osa Peninsula. There are some very important things to know about river crossings.\n\nWater damage to rental cars are not covered under any insurance. Even on official routes like Route 911 Monkey Trail that has two river crossings, insurance will not cover ANY damage caused by water.\n\nFlash floods can happen in rainy season, particularly September through November.\n\nIf the river is too full or you don’t feel comfortable, DO NOT CROSS. Turn around and go onto the main road. It may seem fun but safety should always be your priority. It is NEVER worth that Instagram shot of you driving across a river because there is a possibility of a flash flood, getting stuck or damaging the car.\n\nDriving at Night\n\nShould you drive at night in Costa Rica? You’ll read many blogs saying no, absolutely not. But what if your flights lands at 8 PM and you want to drive to your hotel in the city? Or you want to drive to dinner?\n\nRemember it gets dark by 6 PM everyday in Costa Rica!\n\nAt the end of it, you can drive at night in Costa Rica for short distances. However, we do not recommend driving at night during rainy season (May – November), if it is a long route (more than 1 hour), the route is unpaved and requires a 4×4 or if you do not have a GPS. In these situations, it will be safer to book a nearby hotel for the night and leave early the next morning.\n\nWe do not recommend to drive long routes at night during both dry and rainy season (more than 1 hour).\n\nRead more Costa Rica safety tips in this post!\n\nDriving From Liberia International Airport at Night\n\nAn exception is if you are flying into Liberia International Airport and your first destination is not very far. For example, Playas del Coco is only about a 25 minute drive Liberia Airport and Tamarindo is only 1 hour. Both routes are easy in the sense that it is on a well paved road with good signage going through small towns. You can drive those routes at night using a GPS.\n\nDriving from San Jose International Airport at Night\n\nIf you are landing late in San Jose International Airport, you can drive to your hotel in the city. San Jose Airport is actually in Alajuela so from the airport to downtown San Jose, it is around 30 minutes.\n\nHowever, San Jose traffic is awful so if you don’t want to deal with traffic and city driving, it’s best to book a hotel by the airport and take a taxi/Uber/shuttle to your hotel. You can pick up your rental car the next morning.\n\nSafety tip: something very important to be aware of when driving at night are the pedestrians and bikers. Locals don’t really use reflexive clothing or flashlights and since sidewalks are pretty much non-existent in Costa Rica, they will be walking on the road. Driving slow is the best advice for driving at night in Costa Rica.\n\nWhat to Do if You Have an Accident Or Get a Ticket\n\nSome people will try to approach and help you but this MAY be a tourist scam. There have been some cases where people act like they’re helping but instead rob the person. Read more common tourist scams in Costa Rica here.\n\nThe emergency number is 911 and they have an English speaking line.\n\nYou can move your vehicle if there is an agreement between both parties (or vehicle and object), if nobody was injured, one of the drivers accept responsibility or if it is necessary to move for traffic.\n\nIf you get a traffic ticket, call your rental car company to let them know. You will have to pay it when you drop the car off and it’s best to give your company a heads up so you can begin the payment process.\n\nIf you do not pay your ticket, you may get stopped at the airport and not be allowed to board the plane. They may detain you so pay your ticket!\n\nWhat to Do if a Police Officer Stops You\n\nIn Costa Rica, traffic stops are very common and normal here. Police are allowed to ask anyone: citizens, residents, and tourists to show them their papers which may include your passport, drivers license and tourist visa.\n\nMost of the time, they are actually looking for something specific (drugs, alcohol, etc.) so if everything is OK, they’ll quickly send you on your way.\n\nIf a police officer stops you and you don’t speak Spanish, tell them “No hablo Español”. Usually they will want to see your driver’s license and your passport. All the police officers have access to an English line in case they need it. Be respectful and simply answer his questions.\n\nIf a police officer tries to bribe you, ask for his name, his car or badge ID, take a picture if possible and you can report him. Police officers are not supposed to bribe tourists.\n\nBelow are some more of our local tips for driving in Costa Rica.\n\nCosta Rican Driving “Lights Vocabulary”\n\nIf you see cars flashing their lights, they are actually sending a message. As a Costa Rican, this is very normal for us to see. This is what it means if you see a car flashing their lights at you.\n\nThere is a cop ahead of you: This is very useful and it might save yourself from a ticket. If you’re on the highway and you see the car coming from the other direction flash their lights twice (one short, one long) it means that a cop is ahead of you.\n\nThank you: Let’s say that the person in front of you slows down to let you pass, we usually say thank you by turning on the emergency lights for a few seconds (blink 2 or 3 times).\n\nPass me: I’m not a big fan of this one but just in case you see it you’ll know what’s going on. When you drive on the main highway you’ll see big semi trucks going really slow. Since it’s hard to see, the driver will turn on his left blinker to let you know you can pass him and usually stick his arm out and wave. Like I said I don’t like this one but it’s very common.\n\nThere’s an accident or obstacle: Sometimes local drivers will flash their lights if there is an accident or large obstacle blocking the road ahead.\n\nEmergency Lights\n\nAdditionally, if you see the car in front of you turn on his emergency lights all of a sudden, slow down. There is probably an obstacle ahead and he had to brake suddenly. It is very common in Costa Rica for drivers to put on their emergency lights. They will put on their emergency lights when stopping in the middle of the road, braking suddenly or just talking to their neighbor.\n\nParking\n\nIn the city, San Jose and the GAM do have official parking lots that are paid and with a guard. I highly recommend to park only in official lots in the city.\n\nIf you are outside the GAM, you will notice that a lot of locals park anywhere and everywhere. They’ll park on the side of the road, put on the emergency lights and leave the car running to go to the supermarket and block half the road in the process. This is very common so be careful if you see a parked car with emergency lights. Drive around them carefully.\n\nThe traffic police do give parking tickets in the GAM (San Jose/Alajuela/Heredia/Cartago) and it is also normal in Jaco and Quepos.\n\nTry to park on well lit streets and do not ever leave any valuables visible in your car wherever you are in Costa Rica. Always roll up your windows and lock your doors.\n\nYou may be approached by a man or woman wearing an orange vest offering to watch your car. They’ll most likely try to charge you for parking in their “area” so you can give them a little tip but do not rely on them to watch your car 100%. Never leave anything valuable visible in your car and always roll up your windows and lock your door.\n\nDirections in Costa Rica\n\nIf you are driving in Costa Rica, you will see that addresses are a little different.\n\nCosta Ricans use referral points to get to places. You’ll see addresses like “200 meters west of the bus stop” or “Calle 4” as the address.\n\nThis is super common which is why you should use a GPS when driving in Costa Rica. Waze and Google Maps work in Costa Rica.\n\nIf you rent a GPS, enter the name of your hotel, restaurant, business, etc. as your destination. Also, you can ask the car rental agent to show you how to use the GPS and help you program your first destination.\n\nCosta Rica erected its first street signs in 2012 but they’re not very helpful to be honest. The signs are really small and on the street corner. Many of the road names are simply “Calle 1” or “Avenida 2” and houses still do not really have a house number.\n\nTolls\n\nThere are a few toll booths leaving San Jose on Route 27 that range from 200-1100 colones. Then there are toll booths for exits on this highway like to Jaco, Atenas, etc.\n\nYou can pay these tolls in cash or credit card. They also accept both USD and CRC (local currency). However, we recommend to use Costa Rican currency since they do not use a very good exchange rate but if you have to use USD, you can pay in 1, 5, 10 and 20s bills. They will give you your change back in Costa Rican colones. If you pay with credit card, they will charge in local currency and use the poor exchange rate.\n\nYou will know when tolls are coming up because there will be a sign for “Peaje” and there will be a sign with a list of prices. You just need to pay the automobile price for a car which is the first line (Automóviles liviano). However if you have are driving a 12 seater van like the Hyundai H1 or Staria, they will charge you the category up. Do NOT go in the lane that has the sign “Quick Pass” as that is for cars that have the toll pass. Check the photo below for how to cross the toll booths in Costa Rica.\n\nIf you need local currency, you can exchange like $5 or $10 USD at the airport to get some Costa Rican colones to use for the tolls. Then exchange larger amounts at the bank later.\n\nGas\n\nGas stations are full service in Costa Rica – you do not need to pump your own gas. Regular and super gasoline and diesel are available at every gas station, which are 24 hours.\n\nWhen you pull up, tell the attendant you want lleno de regular por favor (or diesel) to fill up your tank completely. You can read our full guide to getting gas in Costa Rica.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you want to see Costa Rica and explore as much as you can, driving in Costa Rica is the best way to get around.
