        "text": "Requirements For Americans Driving In Spain Expat Tips\n\nIf you are from the United States and are moving to Spain to work, study or even for a vacation, there's a good chance that you will want to drive a motor vehicle during your time here.\n\nWhen it comes to driving laws and documentation requirements, Spain is no different from the United States and most other countries.\n\nAmerican Driving Licenses and Spain\n\nThe Spanish as in the U.S. can be quite strict when it comes to having the correct documentation.\n\nIf you are an American driving in Spain, you will need to carry both your valid U.S. driving license, plus an International Driving Permit (IDP).\n\nThe International Driving Permit is a separate document that translates your driving license into 10 different languages. It is recognized in over 150 different countries worldwide and allows any foreign authorities to be able to easily interpret your driver's license in their native tongue.\n\nThe IDP makes life a lot easier when driving in a foreign country, especially in non-English speaking countries, so is well worth the relatively small investment. Many car hire companies in Spain may also insist on the presentation of an IDP along with your driver's license.\n\nHow to Get Your IDP (International Driving Permit)\n\nAn IDP can be easily obtained for $20.00 from your nearest American Automobile Association (AAA) office or online via their website here.\n\nOnce you have downloaded the IDP application form, you will need to complete it and either take it to your local AAA branch, or send it to the branch via post.\n\nApplication for the IDP has to be made via post to your local AAA office.\n\nThere are certain requirements and things you will need when applying for your IDP which you should be aware of. These include:-\n\nThe fee of $20.00\n\nThe applicant must be over 18 years of age.\n\nSigned copies of the front and back of your current driving license.\n\nTwo passport-sized photos (See application form for requirements)\n\nA completed IDP application form\n\nYour current driving license will need to have at least 6 months of validity remaining beyond the issue of your IDP.\n\nPlease note that the IDP is only valid for 12 months, at which time it must be renewed.\n\nThe IDP can be renewed from overseas, but your driver's license must be valid for at least six months from issue. You will also need to allow up to 15 business days for delivery of your new IDP.\n\nTraffic Citations and Your American Driver's License\n\nIf you do get a traffic citation while in Spain, it's important to note that this is placed against your driver's license and not the IDP document.\n\nAny citations incurred in a foreign country only apply to that country, as the various states' Departments of Motor Vehicles are only able to access a national database. There is no international traffic citations database at this time.\n\nDo Americans need an IDP to Rent a Car in Spain?\n\nSeveral car rental companies in Spain may not insist on an International Driver's Permit (IDP), accepting only your US driver's license and passport. However, in the event of being stopped by Spanish traffic officers, an International Driver's License might be requested, and failure to produce one could result in a fine.\n\nWhen considering renting a car in Spain, be aware that the minimum age requirement is generally 21 years (some providers may require 23), and there are typically additional restrictions or fees for drivers under 24-25 years of age. It's essential to familiarize yourself with Spanish road regulations before driving in Spain.\n\nStaying Long-Term in Spain\n\nUnfortunately, Spain and the United States do not have a reciprocal agreement on the validation of U.S. driver's licenses.\n\nIf you plan on staying in Spain long-term and becoming a resident here, you will need to take a Spanish driving test and obtain a Spanish driving license.\n\nUnder Spanish law, you are only allowed to drive on your U.S. license for a maximum of six months.\n\nYou can read more about this on our Spanish Driving Licences page.\n\nWhat are the basic driving rules in Spain?\n\nYou won't be surprised to know that there are different rules in Spain to those in the U.S. when it comes to driving.\n\nBelow we highlight the main things to remember.\n\nIn Spain, we drive on the right-hand side\n\nAll passengers including those in the rear must wear a safety belt.\n\nYou must legally be 18 or over to drive a car in Spain and over 21 to rent a car.\n\nUsing a cell phone while driving is illegal.\n\nChildren under 135 cm in height, regardless of their age, are obligated to occupy the rear seats of the vehicle, and they must be secured in an authorized child car seat. The sole exemption to this regulation occurs when the rear seats are already occupied by other car seats or if it is impractical to install an approved car seat. In such cases, deactivating the front airbag is necessary. Additionally, child seats must be positioned in a rear-facing orientation until the child reaches 15 months of age or older.\n\nThe maximum speed limit on a motorway is 120 km/h. For conventional roads, it is 90 km/h and for urban traffic it is 30-50 km/h.\n\nThe legal limit for alcohol in Spain is 0.5 grams of alcohol per litre of blood (equivalent to 0.25 milligrams of alcohol per litre of exhaled air).\n\nAll vehicles in Spain must undergo a roadworthiness test called an ITV. If your vehicle is under four years old, it is exempt from undergoing this inspection. However, once your car falls within the age range of four to ten years, an I.T.V test must be conducted every two years. Subsequently, when your vehicle surpasses ten years of age, an annual inspection becomes mandatory.\n\nPrivate Health Insurance in Spain\n\nIf you will be living, working, or studying here in Spain, we can provide you with a wide range of expat health insurance policies to cover your everyday health protection needs. All of our policies are in English (or Spanish, depending on your requirements..) and are underwritten by BUPA."
