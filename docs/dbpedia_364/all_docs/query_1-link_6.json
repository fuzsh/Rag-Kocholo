        "text": "The requirement for the additional driver to be present is there because the agent must verify that s/he is in fact licensed to drive and matches the identity on the driver's license.\n\nAs such, to do everything strictly by the book, you would rent the car solo, drive to pick up your friend, then stop at the nearest branch of the rental agency. There, your travel companion would be added to the rental agreement. For example, Alamo's Additional Driver Policy states\n\nAn additional driver may only be added to the contract at a rental location and may be added or removed in the middle of the contract. When adding an additional driver in the middle of the contract both the renter and the additional driver must be present at the location.\n\nThe system will calculate the charges based on the dates the additional driver was listed on the rental.\n\n(emphasis in original)\n\nI've asked a rental car company about this. I was told that the second person had to be present, however, \"if the second person happened to be stuck at the airport collecting luggage or something, and I happened to have their driving licence, they'd add them\". In other words, they'd let me add a second person if I had their driving licence with me and made up a story that they were nearby.\n\nCan the other person fedex their licence to you or something? If so, you could try that.\n\nAlternatively, if the rental car company has offices in the US, they will let you add the second person at another office if you turn up with them. I've done that before on several occasions.\n\nMost of the answers here, and the question too for that matter, seem to assume that you're going to use the rental agency's loss damage waiver, and in my experience, they're accurate.\n\nHowever, most \"premium\" credit cards (MC World, MC World Elite, etc...) have a \"Travel Protection\" benefit which covers you, and any drivers you authorize, to drive the vehicle. For example the CIBC credit card insurance states that:\n\n(2) Any other person who drives the same rental vehicle with Your permission whether or not such person has been listed on the rental vehicle contract or has been identified to the Rental Agency at the time of making the rental, however, You and all drivers must otherwise qualify under and follow the terms of the rental contract and must be legally licensed and permitted to drive the rental vehicle under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the rental vehicle shall be used.\n\nGenerally they'll ask you to book, and pay for, the rental on said credit card, and specifically decline the agency's LDW.\n\nNot all classes of vehicles are covered, and the terms can vary by issuer, so it's best to get a copy of them, to confirm if your card provides the benefit, and what's required to be covered."
