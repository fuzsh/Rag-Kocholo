If you are looking for a verb to refer to what a car does (as it moves along the road):

The car motored down the highway.

The car rolled along.

The car sped off into the sunset.

The car trundled down the bumpy dirt road.

We can also use these verbs for what a driver of a car (and/or passenger in the car) does:

I | we motored down the highway in my new car.

I | we rolled along in my car.

I | we sped off into the sunset in my new Mercedes.

I | we trundled down the bumpy dirt road in my old jalopy.

or

I | we drove down the highway.

If you're looking for a generic verb that can be used of passenger and driver alike:

We rode along in silence.

You can even use the verb ride transitively with the road as the direct object:

We like to ride the highway in silence.

We like to ride the highway with the radio blaring and the windows rolled down.

Drive performs this function in English, it can be used both for persons

2 a : to operate a vehicle

// learned to drive at the age of seventeen

b : to have oneself carried in a vehicle

// drove to Canada as a kid

(source: Merriam-Webster)

and for the vehicles themselves:

To move along or advance quickly: We could hear the trucks driving along the highway.

(source: The Free Dictionary)

For some persons/vehicles, ride works as well:

1 a: to travel on

// ride a bike

// ride the bus

(source: Merriam-Webster)

but, as Tᴚoɯɐuo notes in the comments, we do not ride a car; we ride in a car.

Your examples would become:

I'm driving/riding on the way now.

Imagine a car driving down the way, and then it stops gently.

Words like "hitchhike", "trek", "swan off" have very specific meanings and are never used in a general sense.
