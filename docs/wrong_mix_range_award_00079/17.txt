On 13 July 2014, South African writer, political activist and Nobel Prize laureate Nadine Gordimer died in her sleep at the age of 90. She was recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee as a writer "who through her magnificent epic writing has – in the words of Alfred Nobel – been of very great benefit to humanity".

Nadine Gordimer was born on 20 November 1923 in the small East Rand mining town of Springs, the daughter of Jewish immigrants. She published her first story - Come Again Tomorrow - in a Johannesburg magazine at just 15 years of age.

In her novels and short stories she wrote about people who lived under the pressures created by the prevailing structures of power. The consequences of apartheid, exile and alienation were the major themes. A number of Gordimer's books were banned by the South African government under the apartheid regime, including The Late Bourgeois World (1966) and Burger's Daughter (1979).

Nadine Gordimer was a leading member of the African National Congress (ANC) and fought for the release of Nelson Mandela. In the post-apartheid 1990s and 21st century, she was also active in the HIV/AIDS movement.
