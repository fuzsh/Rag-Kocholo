If I’d been a black kid, I couldn’t have used that library.”\n\nGordimer began writing at the age of nine and was just 15 years old when her first work was published. During the 1960s and 1970s she wrote several novels set against the backdrop of the emerging resistance movement against apartheid. She was involved in the anti-apartheid movement early on and several of her books were banned by the apartheid regime. \n\nWatch or read the 2005 interview with Nadine Gordimer by clicking the link in our bio. \n\n#NobelPrize\".",
