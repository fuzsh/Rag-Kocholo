With Frederik Willem de Klerk, Mandela was the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize 1993 for staging a peaceful demonstration against the apartheid regime and offering a platform for a democratic South Africa. Mandela remained a philanthropist throughout his life and in 2008, in his 90th birthday celebration, he asked the rich to extend a hand to the poor people around the world.
