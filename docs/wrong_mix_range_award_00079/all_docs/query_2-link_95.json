        "text": "The world lost an exceptional woman recently and I lost a friend.\n\nNadine Gordimer, 90, South African writer, political activist and recipient of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature died on July 13.\n\nWe met at a United Nation Development Program (UNDP) event in New York where she was a guest speaker during a two-day seminar before traveling to Senegal to visit UN aid projects.\n\nIn her speech that morning, she suggested that the news media, especially the Western media, had their own agenda and seldom told the truth. It was obvious that most of the audience, many from developing nations where the media is controlled by the government, agreed with her.\n\nBut I did not agree and stood up and said that the newspapers I was familiar did no such thing. That freedom of the press was a reality in the United States and if you didn't like what was printed there were ways to voice your opinion without penalty. I also warned about the unfairness of painting whole groups of people with one brush.\n\nFollowing her presentation, she joined me for lunch, introduced herself and with a smile, told me she liked my spunk. She also said that maybe I had given her something to think about. Little did she know that it was the first time I had stood up before an international audience to defend my position on an issue.\n\nWhen we boarded the plane the next day, she was my seatmate for the trip to Senegal.\n\nWe talked about the evils of apartheid as practiced in South Africa and about segregation in the United States. We talked about our families, our background and our future and what writers, including journalists, could do to make the world a better place.\n\nI could best describe her as a tiny person with a big heart. The spark in her eyes told you of her passion for righting the wrongs of society, especially where people are the victims of racial and political oppression.\n\nAfter arriving in Senegal, she always found a seat near me. I guess by then we had decided that we liked each other.\n\nMy friends and family know that I hate flying, especially long trips, but on the three or four flights we were on together as seatmates, every thing was fine. She talked so much I didn't have time to be uptight. I told her she was my good luck charm.\n\nAlong the way, we danced the high life in a ballroom in Bamako, Mali; rode in an open truck in the Sahara desert; and visited Timbuktu, one of the most isolated places in Africa.\n\nThe more I learned about Gordimer, the more I admired her. Here was a woman who had written over two dozen works of fiction, and over 200 stories plus personal essays and literary criticism.\n\nMost of her writing dealt with racial and moral issues, especially apartheid in South Africa. She was born in South Africa to activist Jewish parents who were concerned about the poverty and discrimination faced by black people in South Africa.\n\nAt least three of her books were banned in South Africa because of her support for racial and economic quality.\n\nGordimer began writing at an early age. When she was 15 years old she published her first work, a short story for children. Her first adult fiction was published at the age of 16.\n\nAs an adult, she was active in the anti-apartheid movement and joined the African National Congress during the days when the organization was banned.\n\nAs her reputation as a writer and activist grew she became a significant figure in world literature. At first, publication of her stories was limited to South African liberal and literary magazines while later she was published in international journals, creating a wider audience for her work.\n\nAlong the way, she was recognized with awards from all over the world, including at least 15 honorary degrees. Not bad for a woman who only spent only one year at the University of the Witwatersrand.\n\nThanks to our friend at the UN, Djibril Diallo, we were able to make at least three other trips to African countries, including South Africa where I got a chance to spend time with her good friend Nelson Mandela.\n\nIt was said at the time that when Mandela was released from prison after serving over 25 years, one of the first persons he wanted to meet with was Gordimer.\n\nHer home was close to Mandela, \"just a bit down the street,\" and with a laugh she told me about the times after Mandela and his wife Winnie had separated that he would call and invite himself to dinner at her home. \"Really he was just lonesome and wanted someone to talk to. Someone he felt comfortable with. An old friend like me,\" she said.\n\nDuring the post-apartheid years, Gordimer was active in the HIV/AIDS movement, addressing the need for government funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and care. She and I served on the UN Task Force on AIDS in Africa.\n\nDuring meetings at UN headquarters in New York, she was most vocal in her concern that the agency was not doing enough in developing countries spreading the word about care and treatment of HIV/AID patients and the shortage of information on how to protect from contracting this disease.\n\nBecause of her personality and knowledge of the issues, most often she was asked to chair the meetings.\n\nI'm reminded of a UN trip I took to Timbuktu Mali with my good friend David Hawpe, retired editorial director at the Courier-Journal. I was happy when our plane arrived in Paris safely after a bumpy trip. As we entered the airport, I heard a woman's voice down the hall. \"Mervin, Mervin.\" I looked and there she was, my friend Nadine, ready to join us for the next leg of our flight.\n\nGone was my apprehension. Everything was going to be all right. My seatmate and good luck charm was on board.\n\nAs I ponder the loss of this amazing woman. I have concluded that she lived a full and productive life and, yes, the world will know she passed by. Most of all I am grateful for the wonderful opportunity of knowing a true freedom fighter that fought with her head and a pen.\n\nMervin Aubespin of Louisville is a former reporter and associate editor of The Courier-Journal who retired in 2002 after a 35-year career.
