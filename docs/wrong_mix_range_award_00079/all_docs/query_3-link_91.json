        "text": "JOHANNESBURG (AP) â€” Nobel Prize-winning author Nadine Gordimer has died at the age of 90 in South Africa, her family said Monday.\n\nGordimer, who won the literature prize in 1991, died peacefully in her sleep at her home in Johannesburg on Sunday, the family said in a statement. Her son Hugo and daughter Oriane were with her at the time, it said.\n\nGordimer wrote 15 novels as well as several volumes of short stories, non-fiction and other works, and was published in 40 languages around the world, according to the family statement, which was released by a law firm.\n\n\"She cared most deeply about South Africa, its culture, its people, and its ongoing struggle to realize its new democracy,\" the family said. They said her \"proudest days\" included winning the Nobel prize and testifying in the 1980s on behalf of a group of anti-apartheid activists who had been accused of treason.\n\nA private memorial service is expected to be announced at a later date."
