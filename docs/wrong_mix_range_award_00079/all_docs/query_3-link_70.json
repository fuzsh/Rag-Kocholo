        "text": "South African Nobel Prize-winning author Nadine Gordimer has died in Johannesburg aged 90.\n\nThe writer - one of the literary world's most powerful voices against apartheid - died at her home after a short illness.\n\nShe wrote more than 30 books - including the novels My Son's Story, Burger's Daughter and July's People - and was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1991.\n\nGordimer's family released a statement following her death, saying she died peacefully with her children Hugo and Oriane by her side.\n\n\"She cared most deeply about South Africa, its culture, its people and its ongoing struggle to realise its new democracy,\" the statement said.\n\nRegarded by many as South Africa's leading writer, Gordimer was renowned as a rigid moralist whose novels and short stories reflected the drama of human life and emotion in a society warped by decades of white-minority rule.\n\nMany of her stories dealt with the themes of love, hate and friendship under the pressures of the racially segregated system that ended in 1994, when Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president.\n\nA member of Mandela's African National Congress (ANC), which was banned under apartheid, Gordimer used her pen to battle against the inequality of white rule for decades, earning her the enmity of sections of the establishment.\n\nSome of her novels, such as A World Of Strangers and Burger's Daughter, were banned by the apartheid authorities.\n\nBut Gordimer, a petite figure with a crystal-clear gaze, did not restrict her writing to a damning indictment of apartheid, cutting through the web of human hypocrisy and deceit wherever she found it.\n\n\"I cannot simply damn apartheid when there is human injustice to be found everywhere else,\" she said shortly before winning her Nobel prize.\n\nIn later years, she became a vocal campaigner in the HIV/AIDS movement, lobbying and fund-raising on behalf of the Treatment Action Campaign, a group pushing for the South African government to provide free, life-saving drugs to sufferers.\n\nNor did she shy away from criticising the ANC under president Jacob Zuma, expressing her opposition to a proposed law which limits the publication of information deemed sensitive by the government.\n\n\"The reintroduction of censorship is unthinkable when you think how people suffered to get rid of censorship in all its forms,\" she said in an interview last month.\n\nLonely childhood triggered interest in people\n\nThe daughter of a Lithuanian Jewish watchmaker, Gordimer started writing in earnest at the age of nine.\n\nA lonely childhood triggered an intense study of the ordinary people around her, especially the customers in her father's jewellery shop and the migrant black workers in her native East Rand outside Johannesburg.\n\nA teenage naivety was eventually replaced by a sense of rebellion and as her talent and reading public grew, her liberal leanings earned her the reputation of a radical.\n\nEventually the government censors clamped down and banned three of her works in the 1960s and 1970s, despite her growing prestige abroad and her acceptance as one of the foremost authors in the English language.\n\nThe first book to be banned was A World of Strangers, the story of an apolitical Briton drifting into friendships with black South Africans and uncovering the schizophrenia of living in segregated Johannesburg in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1979, Burger's Daughter was banished from the shelves for its portrayal of a woman's attempt to establish her own identity after her father's death in jail makes him a political hero.\n\nDespite Gordimer's place in the international elite, she maintained a passionate concern for those struggling at the bottom of South Africa's literary heap.\n\n\"It humbles me to see someone sitting in the corner of a township shack he shares with 10 others, trying to write in the most impossible of conditions,\" she said.\n\nDespite her hatred of apartheid, Gordimer remained proud of her heritage and said she only once considered emigrating to nearby Zambia.\n\n\"Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European - a stranger,\" she said.\n\n\"It is only here that I can be what I am: a white African.\""
