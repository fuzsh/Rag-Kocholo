        "text": "London, July 15 (ANI): Nobel prize-winning author Nadine Gordimer took her last breath at her home in Johannesburg. She was 90. As per her family, the South African writer, who was known for strong voice against apartheid, died following a short illness, the BBC reported. Gordimer, who had more than 30 books to her credit, had jointly claimed Booker Prize in 1974 for 'The Conservationist' and was honored with the Nobel Prize for literature in 1991, where the committee had mentioned her work \"magnificent epic writing\" which had been of \"great benefit to humanity.\" The author's work and association with African National Congress (ANC) had made her close friends of Nelson Mandela, for whom she even edited his famous 'I Am Prepared To Die' speech for his 1962 trial. The Nelson Mandela Foundation and the ANC paid tribute and \"heartfelt condolences\" to Gordimer's family, saying that they lost a great writer, and a patriot, who fought hard to bring equality in their nation. Gordimer had published her first work 'Come Again Tomorrow' when she was only 15, while her last novel, 'No Time Like the Present', was published in 2012. The writer was also featured in 1981 BBC series 'Writers And Places'. The author, who is survived by two children, would be paid last respects in a private memorial service which is yet to be announced. (ANI)"
