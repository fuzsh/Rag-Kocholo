        "text": "Hi Gang,\n\nFor the last two years, I've been a consultant for Peter Turner of the Oxford Brookes University regarding the viewing of horror films by underage viewers. His initial paper is out so I thought I'd post the link here as it's quite a read (it can be downloaded, too, so you can convert for your preferred e-reader).\n\nIt is obviously more geared to the UK's history and in particular the so-called (and imprecise, panic-term) video nasty. Incidentally, as a participant, I saw very little 'traditional' video nasties and have no interest in plotless horror that is just about revenge or hate, but I certainly saw stuff too early. I began watching horror in 1978 when Night of the Demon and Curse of the Werewolf were broadcast, and from there on I watched Alien, Amityville Horror, 'salem's Lot, the Halloweens and so on.\n\nMy parents were strict, but their discipline didn't extend to horror, but if there was sexual content, they would forbid me from watching.\n\nI'm also working on an academic-flavoured essay on the inappropriate inclusion of horror literature with science fiction and fantasy. More and more I've noticed the disparity between SFF and horror, perhaps more so in literature than movies. I've become more than a little fatigued with the snobbery leveled against horror by genre fans, and my work on the Chronscast (podcast with @Dan Jones) has underlined just how poor a mix horror lit and sff are. I'd argue comedy has far more in common with horror than it does with sff, but as we are all aficionados of genre fiction here, horror gets crowbarred in, despite a fundamental misunderstanding about horror, it's purpose and its creation. (And I never get tired of banging on about how I hate the term 'horror'; it's a reductive term describing an emotion, not a genre, and I suspect mostly responsible for the maligning and misunderstanding of my beloved genre)\n\nBut I digress. The point of this post is to offer the link for Pete's paper, so here it is:\n\nYes, it's fifteen pages. I'm saving it for after the weekend as we have an interview with Tade Thompson so I need to prep for that\n\nJust to clarify, I don't want people thinking I'm saying SFF aren't or can't do dark, but the aims, the root of horror comes from the abject, and is linked with the human condition/existentialism in its nihilistic and most inscrutable or spiritual form whereas SFF manifesto seems to be less limited than that.\n\nI think Guillermo del Toro made a lovely observation on horror, which I can only paraphrase; we don't write/watch horror to be scared, we write/watch it to make sense of the world.\n\nThat really chimes with me.\n\nSo it’s the reflective mirror? The reason many write spec fiction is to make sense of the world around us not the world on paper. I think you feel more of an outsider than you really are. You and your work are much loved here xx\n\nI see I wrote I was a consultant on the paper which is far grander a term and misleading. I was a participant— that’s a far better description.\n\nRe the mirror @Jo Zebedee — yes, but that’s too simplistic a view (or perhaps generalised). I’m talking purely about our reptilian brain experience and our utter existential failure. Fantasy and SF might be able to address that thematically but it’s not the lynchpin of their being.\n\nBut, I’m very keen to point out, this post is nothing about whether people here like my writing. It’s about the difference in genre. I’m happy with my own writing. I just wish there was the level of expertise and interest in horror here as there is for SFF.\n\nMaybe I should’ve kept those thoughts to a different thread or time, but it seemed salient at the time of posting.\n\nI'm also working on an academic-flavoured essay on the inappropriate inclusion of horror literature with science fiction and fantasy. More and more I've noticed the disparity between SFF and horror, perhaps more so in literature than movies. I've become more than a little fatigued with the snobbery leveled against horror by genre fans, and my work on the Chronscast (podcast with @Dan Jones) has underlined just how poor a mix horror lit and sff are. I'd argue comedy has far more in common with horror than it does with sff\n\nI could go on about this at quite some length. Horror, comedy, erotica and perhaps Romance are categorised by the emotion they evoke, while SFF and fantasy are settings. I've written comedy SF and fantasy with horror influences. Perhaps the next stage is erotic Westerns.\n\nRegarding the mirror aspect, I've come to think that one of the reasons I write is to process life, not to satirise it or to escape from it. (There's also the fact that it's the only thing I do particularly well, so I might as well produce something decent.)\n\nAnyhow, I saw Alien when I was 13 or 14 - my parents had no idea that I was watching it. It was one of the first films that struck me as \"good\" as well as \"fun\" (if \"fun\" is really the word, which it isn't). I was braced for most of it, but not the robot scene. When Ash was decapitated, the film stopped being \"scary\" and was now downright traumatic. I think it's easy to make horror that is boringly ironic or just plain disgusting, but very hard to produce that kind of convincing nightmare.\n\nPart of the problem with horror for me is that, unless the emotion of horror is properly created - which is much harder than, say, setting a story in space or in a magical kingdom - it's not a pleasant viewing experience: it will probably end up as boring, unconvincing or just gross (a lot of extreme horror seems to be asking the question \"How long can you sniff this turd before you retch?\"). It is a very difficult genre to get right and, like comedy, getting it right varies enormously from reader to reader.\n\nThese comments on Alien are interesting to me, because it was proably the first X rated film that I was old enough to legally go to see. I never looked old enough to pretend, as some classmates claimed they did to see The Exorcist. Obtaining videos was much easier to do, but I don't think we even had a VCR yet then. I went to see Alien because it was science fiction, but it was really something quite different, and was \"adult\" in the full meaning of that word, when compared to Star Wars and all that fantasy SF that followed from its success. Alien sprouted many copies too, but they weren't very adult. I remember, I think it was Inseminoid, which was just Judy Geeson screaming for one and half hours. I've never liked the gory 'horror' films. Horror must, as @Toby Frost just said, create an emotion of horror. It wasn't enough for me to have some guy with a chainsaw hacking off limbs. I've never watched any of the Friday the Thirteenth films, or Saw, and only recently saw Halloween. However, films like The Spiral Staircase and the original Invaders from Mars genuinely gave me sleepless nights as a child.\n\nI think Alien was more important to shaping my future cinematic experiences than any other film. You ought to make a podcast on it.\n\nI'd agree that horror is closely connected to comedy; quite often a movie will present a moment of levity before a 'shock'. But I would also say that in genre terms science fiction is often closely intertwined with horror or suspense. Both genres tend to challenge the status quo, and whether we like it or not, much science fiction literature tends to concentrate more on the negative aspects than the positive.\n\nAs for the word 'horror', I agree that this is not a very good (or very accurate) description of the genre. Most supernatural/scary movies are not outright horror. I think that it was M R James who described his work as 'a pleasing terror', and I think that this description most accurately describes his stories, but there are so many different types of this genre from 'Jaws' to 'Alien' to 'Saw' to 'The Exorcist' to 'Night of the Demon' - even Threads - that it's difficult to give them one name that accurately describes them. Whilst the word 'horror' is far from perfect, it's as good and as inaccurate as any other.\n\nAs for the OP, I think that as kids we were exposed to a lot more fictional supernatural stories. Many kids programmes of the time featured ghosts, from the more comedic 'Rentaghost' to the chilling 'Clifton House Mystery', 'Come Back Lucy' and 'Children of the Stones'. Even Doctor Who would often have spooky stories, which eventually got reigned in when they were starting to get too carried away. It seemed like a natural progression to the very creepy Hamer House of Horror 1 hour episodes shown on ITV, then onto to the double billed horror/monster movies on BBC Two Saturday night (when kids used to get to stay up as a treat)\n\nLooking on Wiki at a list of the films classed as 'video nasties' I've only seen a handful, and none when younger (apart from maybe 'The Evil Dead'). Of those I've seen, they seem to be far more 'gore' than 'scare', and if the list is accurate and 'The Thing' was listed as such, I'm not sure what the rationale was. In my opinion the likes of 'The Exorcist' (which I did see as a teenager, and scared me more than any other movie I'd seen to this point) was more likely to cause distress than The Evil Dead or The Thing.\n\nAs a kid, by far the scariest thing I ever saw on tv was 'Threads'. I think the same could be said for many (adults and children) who watched it.\n\nMy folks and grandparents were liberal, at least when it came to movies, books, etc., so I was able to watch Alien in the theater with the folks, an aunt, and paternal grandparents. For some reason, the ticket seller and ushers didn't enforce the rating rule, and probably because I was accompanied by family. Scared the crap out of me but I became an Alien fan since. I also remember watching movies like The Passage.\n\nIf we didn't go out, we saw R-rated horror flicks (or worse) on tape, on Sundays, after lunch, in my grandparents' home. I remember watching movies like The Devils (horrible), The Fan, Halloween (nice), The Howling (it was OK), Wolfen, An American Werewolf in London (that frightened me), The Fog (my favorite), The Thing (the newer one because the folks didn't care for old, black-and-white movies, as they saw them when they were young), The Hearst, Ghost Story, The Exterminator, The Brood (hated that), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (from the 1970s; I liked that one), Galaxy of Terror, and similar B- and Z-movies from different genres (like the Lemon Lollipop series from Israel, Gorp, and so on).\n\nMom would always advise me to cover my eyes during sex scenes (apparently, gore was fine but boobs weren't, LOL), but I'd always have a gap between fingers and could see things, anyway (except for gore)."
