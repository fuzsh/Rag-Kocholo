        "meta_description": "A list of 11,536 films compiled on Letterboxd, including Mad Max (1979), Rendezvous (1976), Witchfinder General (1968), Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Evilspeak (1981). About this list: 100 Years of Exploitation! All the films from my exploitation lists, bundled into one mega-super-list-to-rule-them-all! I had to use a cut-off date as the list was growing so huge that it was a real pain to update, sort and save, plus I wanted to add even more films. I chose 1995 as the cut-off as it's 100 years after the very first exploitation film on the list (1896). Besides, films after this point, especially when you get to the digital age, start to become a little more self-aware and \"knowing\". That's when it gets a little hard to differentiate between a real exploitation film and a homage, parody or satire. That isn't to say that later period exploitation is crap as there are some real gems out there swirling around in the straight-to-dvd zombie bin-juice, so maybe another list is needed for all the Asylum monster movies, Rob Zombie flicks and films like 'Hobo with a Shotgun' and 'Nude Nuns with Big Guns'? This list and the sub-genre lists include proto films (films that influenced a sub-genre) as well as later, more mainstream films that the exploitation genre, in turn, influenced. There will always be missing films so, as always, suggestions are welcome but please let me know to which sub-genres the suggestions belong. Some won't fit into a sub-genre, but that's ok - I'll just add them to this master list. Finally, remember to use the 'Service' filter above to check which are available to stream - so many of them are!
