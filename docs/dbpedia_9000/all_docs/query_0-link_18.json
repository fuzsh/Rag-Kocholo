Yet the ways in which genre is understood are anything but consistent across those different constituencies. At a more fundamental level too, genre remains a perplexingly evasive and, philosophically speaking, idealistic entity. On the one hand, no individual genre film can ever embody the full range of attributes said to typify its genre; by the same token – as volumes of frustrated critical effort attest – no definition of a genre, however flexible, can account equally well for every genre film. For newcomers to the field, it must often seem that, as with Gertrude Stein’s Oakland, ‘when you get there, there’s no “there” there.’ This book proposes that, such problems notwithstanding, genre remains an essential critical tool for understanding the ways that films are produced and consumed, as well as their broader relations to culture and society. However, the shifting valences, relations and definitions of the concept of genre pose obvious problems for students, who must additionally balance abstract and/or generalised categories – in ‘defining’ individual genres and in understanding the underlying principles of generic classification as such – on the one hand against their realisation (or repudiation) in any given film on the other. Rather like the baffled private eye Harry Moseby in the ‘revisionist’ genre film Night Moves (1975), anyone studying genre is prone to encountering an unexpected complexity in apparently common-sense categories where every new turn threatens further consternation. Harry Moseby ends up quite literally going around in circles. Students risk a similar fate. The aim of this book is to make that dismal outcome less likely. Focusing mainly on the best-known and longest-lived Hollywood genres – those with roots in the classical studio era, even if like the action film they have taken on a different generic character and a hugely expanded industrial importance in\n\nviii\n\n \n\nthe post-classical period – I have tried to show the ways in which film genre theory has informed the most influential accounts of major genres and vice versa. In some cases, students may find that their prior assumptions about what makes films generic, or how individual genres work, are challenged. As disorienting as this might sometimes be, it seems nonetheless an appropriate dimension of learning to understand what are after all complex entities with widely ramified connections to film, social – and critical – history. Such ramifications defeat Harry Moseby, who at the end of the film we leave adrift in a boat named Point of View. Night Moves leaves it deliberately ambiguous whether Harry himself lacks a point of view or is baffled by too many conflicting ones. The reader of this book will I hope be able to understand the reasons for the controversies and conflicting views of film genre and genre films, and through such understanding develop a critical perspective of their own. Books, like films, are collaborative productions. Thanks are owed to many colleagues and undergraduate and postgraduate students, and to Royal Holloway, University of London, who have in a variety of formal and informal contexts helped formulate and refine the ideas about film genre explored in this book. I have also had the benefit of airing some of these ideas, notably on Westerns and on Holocaust film, in papers delivered at conferences in the UK and the United States: I am grateful to the conference organisers for those opportunities and, once again, to numerous colleagues for the responses and insights they have volunteered. Some material is based on essays previously published in Film & History and the Journal of Holocaust Education. My editor at Edinburgh University Press, Sarah Edwards, expertly coaxed the book through the initial proposal and then waited (and waited!) patiently for the eventual arrival of the manuscript. My family had to live with an increasingly reclusive and grouchy author as his deadline first approached, then passed. They did so with a good deal more grace than he did. In particular, without the support, tolerance and keen editorial eye of my wife Carole Tonkinson this book would not have been possible, and it is dedicated with love to her.\n\nAbout this book\n\nThe overall approach of Film Genre: Hollywood and Beyond situates genres in their historical – primarily, cultural and (film) industrial – contexts; the overarching context of the book is the transition from the ‘classical’ Hollywood system to a ‘post-classical’ mode that extends to the present day. In making this separation, I neither explicitly challenge nor endorse arguments about the extent to which ‘post-classical’ Hollywood represents a qualitatively different set of visual stylistics in Hollywood film, or is essentially continuous in formal terms with the ‘classical’ Hollywood cinema (see Bordwell, Staiger and Thompson, 1985; Bordwell, 2002). It is clear enough, as numerous studies have now established, that the relatively standardised mass-production of film entertainment that typified the studio era until shortly after the war has been replaced by a far more dispersed and heterogeneous mechanism (this does not mean of course that the outcomes are equally heterogeneous), and thus the structure of contract artists – stars, writers, directors, set and costume designers, composers, etc. – studio backlots and standing sets, annual release ‘slates’ and vertically integrated corporate organisations that collectively comprised what André Bazin called ‘the genius of the system’ and which supported and encouraged genre production, has gone. Some genres, like the musical and the Western, seem for a variety of reasons to have been so much a part of that system that they could not easily survive its passing, while others, like film noir and the action blockbuster, are in different ways clearly outcomes of a different order of production than the Hollywood studio system and may usefully be considered in the context of a post-classical cinema. In any event, I have arranged the genres discussed in the book into three categories – classical, transitional and post-classical. Like other boundaries discussed in this book, these too are porous and certainly open to challenge: they are intended as heuristic tools rather than definitive statements. Each chapter addresses both genre history and some of the principal\n\nx   critical approaches each genre has invited. History and criticism are at every stage interlinked: it is easy enough in genre study to lose the wood for the trees, and so I have not attempted either to cover every major critical approach to every genre (a task in any case undertaken magisterially by Steve Neale, 2000), nor have I aimed to provide in each case a comprehensive genre history, as this can easily end up simply offering lists of insufficiently differentiated film titles. Each chapter does, I hope, give a reasonably clear picture of a genre’s historical development while also engaging with those critical perspectives that seem to have the most direct bearing either on the current state of critical understanding of a genre or its location within genre studies as a whole. In citing genre critics and theorists I have maintained a slight bias towards recent research to reflect the current state of play and new critical directions. Each chapter concludes with a brief ‘case study’ of a genre film or pair of films. These films have not been selected for either their ‘classic’ or their representative status, but simply as films that can be and have been firmly located within the genre in question, whose more detailed consideration seems to me in useful ways to complement or amplify the issues raised in the main section of the chapter. The account given of the film(s) is not intended to be comprehensive, nor could it be in the space available: the elements highlighted are those that bear most directly on genre history or genre theory. Genre studies has historically been dominated by analysis of the major Hollywood genres, and this book is principally about Hollywood. However, the subtitle – Hollywood and Beyond – reflects firstly my own concern to indicate that Hollywood genres not only colonise the rest of the world, but are and have been open to it; secondly, the stream that in recent years has become a flood of critical studies of the popular cinemas of other nations and their genres; and third, that even American genres are not and have not been exclusively produced by Hollywood. The first concern means that, where relevant (for example, the horror film and film noir) influences on Hollywood from other national cinemas and cultures are considered in their proper place in the main body of each chapter. The second is inadequately – for reasons of both space and in many cases the limits of my own expertise – covered in a concluding section to each chapter (bar Chapter 5 on the war/combat film, which, to highlight the interaction of genre and nationhood, proceeds on a comparative international basis throughout) which briefly indicates some of the ways that major Hollywood genres have also figured importantly (sometimes under Hollywood’s influence and sometimes wholly separately) in other national cinemas. Non-Hollywood American genres like documentary and pornography are discussed at somewhat greater length in the final chapter. Note: Films are listed with their year of release on their first citation in any individual chapter: the country of origin is assumed to be the US unless otherwise indicated.\n\n \n\nWho Needs Genres?\n\nT\n\nhinking about why we might ‘need’ genres means thinking about the uses to which we commonly put genre concepts and the value we derive from doing so. Thus we can focus on genre’s role as an active producer of cultural meanings and film-making practices alike. The provisional answer to the question ‘who needs genres?’ is ‘Everyone – but in different ways, and not to the same degree’. For film-makers, organising production around genres and cycles holds out the promise of attracting and retaining audiences in a reliable way, so reducing commercial risk. For audiences, genre categories provide basic product differentiation while the generic ‘contract’ of familiarity leavened by novelty seems to offer some guarantee that the price of admission will purchase another shot of an experience already enjoyed (once or many times) before. For scholars, genre provides a historically grounded method of establishing ‘family resemblances’ between films produced and released under widely differing circumstances, and of mediating the relationship between the mythologies of popular culture and social, political and economic contexts. Unlike many topics within academic film studies, the basic concept of genre is readily grasped and widely used in the larger contemporary film culture, as a visit to any video rental store readily illustrates. In my own local outlet in South West London, for example, videos and DVDs are arranged into the following categories: latest releases, action, thrillers, drama, science fiction, horror, comedy, family, classics, cult and world cinema. Such a listing illustrates both the practical utility of genre and some of the problems that genre theory and criticism have always faced. Certainly – perhaps unsurprisingly – for film consumers in this high-street context at least it is genre, rather than other means of grouping films adopted by film scholars, that offers the readiest means of charting a path through the variety of available films to those they are most likely to want to see. Although film\n\n2   history, for example, plays some role in these classifications, the overarching principle is not a historical one. Nor does the notion of the ‘auteur’ play a terribly visible role: although the identification of (usually) the film director as principal creative agent has become an interpretative norm for broadsheet and specialist magazine film criticism, directors in general feature only marginally in the promotion or classification of videos. This of course tells us nothing about the percentage of customers who enter the store to find a particular film, or a film by a particular director, and are thus uninterested in or uninfluenced by the genre categories: indeed, as we shall see, genre theory generally has found it rather difficult to establish with any certainty how far the film industry’s categories map onto, let alone determine, audiences’ actual experience of movie-going. Stars, another major focus of academic film studies, play a much more visible part in the promotion of individual films – ‘above the line’ talent usually features prominently on video or DVD covers and is clearly a major factor in attracting audiences. Yet stars as such do not comprise generic categories. Film students, indeed, may be surprised to see that star personae – a major force in film production and consumption since the 1910s, when public demand forced reluctant producers to identify their hitherto anonymous performers (and pay these new ‘stars’ accordingly inflated salaries) – are also suppressed as a criterion for classification. Industrial change has clearly played a part here: no longer salaried contract players assigned to several different film roles annually within the studio’s overall release ‘slate’, today’s film stars are free agents, leading industry players in their own right, and usually have their own production companies to originate film projects and bring them to studios for financing and distribution deals. Actors today are accordingly much freer to diversify and extend both their acting range and their star image; they need not be pigeonholed in just one style or genre of film. In the classical period the interplay of star, studio and genre was complex and not necessarily unidirectional: Sklar (1992: 74–106) argues that rather than hiring performers to meet pre-established generic needs (let alone compelling actors against their will into restrictive genre roles), having Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney, both actors with ‘tough’ urban screen personae, as contract players encouraged Warner Bros. to make a speciality of the crime thriller during the 1930s and 1940s. Even the Western The Oklahoma Kid (1939) wholly conforms to the template established in other contemporary Cagney and Bogart gangster films like Angels With Dirty Faces (1938) and The Roaring Twenties (1939). As usual, Cagney (much the bigger star at this point) plays the hero – here in the ‘pro-social’ gangbusting mould into which his early 1930s gangster persona had subsequently been recast (see Chapter 6) – and Bogart the underworld boss ‘heavy’ in a narrative that\n\n  \n\n3\n\nsimply transposes the racketeering/syndicate gangland template of G-Men (1935) to the ‘wide-open town’ Western. In general – and with different approaches from one studio to another – the bigger the star the greater his or her opportunity for diversification: thus Cagney in the 1930s played not only gangster parts but musicals (Footlight Parade, 1934), aviation films (Ceiling Zero, 1937) and even Shakespeare (A Midsummer Night’s Dream, 1935). Moreover, star personae could transform over time, as with Bogart’s own transition from second-lead heavies in the 1930s to the ideal romantic leading man for the war-torn 1940s. But the studio system generally made casting a much more reliable guide to the nature of a film than today: whereas fans of Errol Flynn in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) could be reasonably confident that The Sea Hawk (1941) would offer similar pleasures – and that this would be true even if the generic mode shifted from swashbuckling action-adventure to Western (They Died With Their Boots On, 1941) or war film (Desperate Journey, 1942) – admirers of Tom Cruise in Top Gun (1986) or Mission Impossible (1996) may be surprised, disappointed or even outraged by his performance in Magnolia (1999). The movement of a contemporary star like Julianne Moore between large-budget popcorn spectaculars like Jurassic Park II: The Lost World (1997) and stylised independent films like Far From Heaven (2002) offers audiences little clear generic purchase. Artwork on film posters and DVD jackets typically relies at least as much on sending out generic signals – typically by means of iconographic conventions (see below) – as on star personae, which are indeed often modified or generically ‘placed’ by such imagery. Arnold Schwarzenegger grins goofily in linen lederhosen on the front of Twins (1988); on Kindergarten Cop (1990) he gurns in exaggerated alarm as he is assaulted by a swarm of pre-schoolers. Both films are comedies and both images knowingly play off the unsmiling, tooled-up Arnie featured on the publicity for the techno-thrillers The Terminator (1984) or Eraser (1996). Yet as central an aspect of film consumption and reception as genre may be, another look at the video store’s generic taxonomy quickly reveals what from the perspective of most academic genre criticism and theory look like evident anomalies. For example, while some of these genres – action, thriller, horror, science fiction, comedy – match up fairly well with standard genre headings, the video store omits several categories widely regarded as of central importance in the history of genre production, such as Westerns, gangster films and musicals (examples of all of these are dispersed across drama, action, thriller and ‘classics’) – let alone more controversial yet (in academic discussion) ubiquitous classifications as film noir or melodrama. Other categories are uncanonical by any standard: ‘latest releases’ is selfevidently a time-dated cross-generic category; ‘classics’ is generically problematic in a different way, since it apparently combines both an evaluative\n\n4   term (‘all-time classic’, ‘landmark’, etc.) with a temporal one (the small and seemingly random selection of pre-1975 films available for rental are automatically classified as ‘classics’, regardless of critical standing). The ‘family’ category combines G-rated films from a number of conventionally separate genres (animated films, comedies, Disney live-action adventures and other children’s films). ‘World cinema’ is used, not as it is in academic film studies (somewhat reluctantly, given its implicit Euro- or Anglo-centrism) to designate film-making outside of North America and Western Europe, but rather includes any subtitled film, most independently produced US films and British films – for example, the films of Ken Loach – that fall outside recognised and familiar generic categories like the gangster film, romantic comedy, etc. Nor are these categories stable in themselves: all new titles eventually mutate from ‘latest release’ into one of the other backlist categories; those (English-language) films that last the course may in due course be elevated to ‘classics’. Anomalies of course beset classificatory programmes of any kind. In a celebrated example (much quoted by critical theorists, most famously Michel Foucault, 1970: xv), the Argentinian fabulist Jorge Luis Borges quotes a ‘certain Chinese encyclopedia’ in which animals are divided into ‘(a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) suckling pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification …’ and so on, concluding in ‘(n) that from a long way off look like flies’. The ‘wonderment’ of this taxonomy, as Foucault puts it, consists less in its sheer heterogeneity per se – since it is precisely the function of conventional lists to enumerate similarities and discriminate differences – than in the epistemological and ontological incompatibility of the categories: ‘the common ground on which such meetings are possible has itself been destroyed’ (Foucault, 1970: xvi). While film genre criticism would seem to avoid such difficulties, many studies of genre – including the present one – combine within their pages genres with rather different standings: those that have a long and verifiable (for example, through film-makers’ correspondence or trade paper reviews) history of usage as production categories within the film industry itself, such as Westerns, musicals or war films; those where industry usage differs markedly from critical usage, notably melodrama (see Chapter 2); and those that are largely a product of critical intervention, pre-eminently film noir. The history of early cinema meanwhile reveals that film distributors in moving pictures’ first decade tended to classify films under such heterodox (by today’s standards) headings as length (in feet of film) and duration rather than the content-based generic categories that emerged by 1910. Even the most uncontroversial categories remain heterogeneous: war films and Westerns are identified by subject matter, the gangster film by its protagonist(s), thrillers and horror films by their effects upon the viewer, film noir by either\n\n  \n\n5\n\nits ‘look’ or its ‘dark’ mood. Studio-era producers, in addition to the familiar genre categories (usually referred to in the industry as ‘types’), used the economic category of the ‘prestige picture’ to denote their most expensive, high-profile and (hopefully) profitable pictures – which could of course also belong to one or more of the standard types, but whose audience appeal would be expected to break out beyond that type’s core market. Our sojourn in the video store illustrates above all that genre is a process rather than a fact, and one in which different perspectives, needs and interests can and do deliver widely varying outcomes. Genres are not born, they are made. The store manager explained to me that the ‘classic’ category combines individual preference with institutional supervision: that is, while store managers have wide personal discretion in assigning ‘classic’ status to individual films, corporate policy mandates that if one film in a series is categorised as a ‘classic’, other series entries must automatically be filed alongside. Thus since Die Hard (1988) is (so I was informed) ‘an obvious classic’, Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) also has ‘classic’ status thrust upon it. This bears out James Naremore’s (1995–96: 14) observation that ‘individual genre has less to do with a group of artefacts than with a discourse – a loose evolving system of arguments and readings, helping to shape the commercial strategies and aesthetic ideologies.’ (One might note that the leeway this system affords individual managers brings into play the social categories through which contemporary cultural studies engages popular media texts – race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, even age. The video-rental business is, as Kevin Smith’s microbudget indie film Clerks (1994), testifies, dominated by young white males: the ‘classics’ section abounds in stereotypically ‘male’ genres like Westerns, action films and science fiction, with a striking deficit of musicals or family melodramas.) How might any of this be relevant to genre studies? In relation to the last example, genre critics and theorists have in recent years laid increasing importance on institutional discourses and practices, broadly conceived – what Steve Neale (1993, citing Gregory Lukow and Steve Ricci, 1984) designates the industry’s ‘inter-textual relay’, comprising both trade journalism (Variety, Film Daily and so on) and newspapers as well as the language of film promotion and publicity – as a means of locating in a determinate if always changing historical context the understandings of generic categories upon which genre criticism in turn bases itself. For such categories, however apparently deceptively solid ‘in theory’, often prove surprisingly elusive in both industrial, and hence critical, practice. These ‘historicist’ approaches to genre studies have in some cases – notably the Western and melodrama – significantly extended the historical horizons and cultural contexts for understanding genres and productively problematised conventional critical accounts. Today’s genre-constituting ‘relay’ includes such venues of film consumption\n\n6   as the corner video store, which occupies an important place in the global and vertically integrated ‘film industry’ – not in fact the singular and unified entity that term suggests, but a complex network of cross-media enterprises mostly clustered into a few very large transnational corporate enterprises, for whom a film’s performance in ancillary (but no longer secondary) markets like home video provides a growing share of its profitable return on investment. As Christine Gledhill (2000: 225f.) points out, the empirical history of industry relays neither defines nor exhausts the terms on which audiences engage with genre texts. Moreover, film genre studies today itself constitutes its own ‘relay’: the terms and categories that have developed through decades of analysis and theory about individual genres and genre in general have established meaningful contexts in which genres and genre films are understood today. This process of generic legitimation is the principal reason this book generally cleaves to ‘canonical’ genre categories like the Western, the combat film, etc. What on the other hand I have tried to avoid is any sense that such categories are more than provisional or that generic identities can be fixed, however critically convenient such fixity would undoubtedly be. If anything, genres may intermittently stabilise in the sense of becoming for strictly delimited periods carriers of particular meanings or vehicles through which specific issues may be negotiated (for example, ‘whiteness’ in early Westerns (see Abel, 1998), or ‘technoscience’ in the contemporary science fiction film (see Wood, 2002)).\n\n    Genre, as a police detective in a (British) crime film might say, has form. Aristotle opens his Poetics, the foundational work of western literary criticism, by identifying it as a work of genre criticism: ‘Our subject being Poetry, I propose to speak not only of the art in general but also of its species and their respective capacities’ (1911: 3). By 1601–2, when Shakespeare’s Hamlet was first performed, genre categories – and their abuse – were clearly ‘hot’ issues. In Hamlet, Act II, Scene ii, the busybody courtier Polonius excitedly announces the arrival of a troupe of travelling players. Praising – today we would say hyping – their abilities, he declares them ‘the best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene indivisible, or poem unlimited’ (l. 392ff.). Shakespeare here is clearly making fun of Polonius’ ludicrous attempt to pigeonhole, ratify and standardise the aesthetic realm to within an inch of its life; however, he may also be targeting for satire the abuse of valid categories\n\n  \n\n7\n\nthat will ultimately lead to the breakdown of the utility of categorisation itself. Genre, in other words, is a tool that must be used wisely but not too well: defining the individual artefact in generic terms can be helpful but shouldn’t be pursued at all costs. Not every aspect of the genre text is necessarily or purely attributable to its generic identity, hence there is no need to invent absurd refinements of generic denomination, or to make the mesh of the classificatory or definitional net so fine as to allow no light through. At the same time, if the concept is to have any critical utility at all, it needs to be able to make meaningful discriminations: ‘scene indivisible’ or ‘poem unlimited’ seem unhelpfully broad as workable categories for genre criticism. Polonius seems unconsciously to exemplify Jacques Derrida’s (1992) dictum that texts – all texts, any text – neither ‘belong to genres’ (because texts can always exceed specific expectations and labels), yet nor can they escape being generic (because all texts are encountered in contexts that involve some, often major, measure of expectation on the part of readers in regard to style, identity, content, use, meaning: a text is necessarily ‘placed’ as a very condition of its being able to be read at all). However, even if ‘there is always a genre or genres’ (Derrida, 1992: 230), this merely establishes that the task of film genre studies must be to establish the particular kinds of genres that are characteristic of commercial narrative cinema, the varieties of assumptions and expectations that play around and through them, the uses to which they are or have been put, and finally the identities, roles and interests of the different stakeholders (film-makers, film distributors and exhibitors, audiences, critics and theorists) in this process. One approach might be to emphasise those relatively concrete and verifiable aspects of the film-industrial process that historically subtend genre production, above all though by no means exclusively in Hollywood cinema, to demarcate a field of study. At the same time, one might want to look at the ways in which individual films seem either to conform to or to confront and challenge the (assumed) expectations of the spectator. Douglas Pye ([1975] 1995: 187f.) has described genre as a context in which meaning is created through a play of difference and/in repetition, one ‘narrow enough for recognition of the genre to take place but wide enough to allow enormous individual variation’. This combination of sameness and variety is the linchpin of the generic contract. While it may reasonably be assumed that audiences do not wish to see literally the same film remade time and again, considerable pleasure is to be derived from generic narratives through the tension between novel elements and their eventual reincorporation into the expected generic model. The confirmation of generic expectations generates what Richard Maltby (1995a: 112) describes as a ‘sense of pleasurable mastery and control’. In an analysis of genre films in the 1970s, a period when many traditional genres underwent considerable revision and\n\n8   revamping, Todd Berliner (2001) has argued that even ‘revisionist’ genre films ‘bend’ rather than ‘break’ – that is, manipulate and modify, but do not wholly dispense with – generic conventions as they seek to engage their audiences in a more conscious scrutiny of genre conventions and the values they embody. For most film genre theorists, the concept of ‘genre’ has implied a great deal more than simple conventionality. On the contrary, genre was historically an important means for writers interested in popular, and above all Hollywood, cinema – as distinct from, for example, European art cinema (though see Tudor, [1973] 1976; Neale, 1991) – to establish the value and interest of their chosen field of critical enquiry. This was an important move because some mid-twentieth-century critiques of popular/‘mass’1 culture tended to blur the lines between genre, formula, stereotype and simple cliché as part of a critical project to deprecate popular culture generally on grounds of unoriginality and derivativeness. Those popular cultural forms to which genre is most evidently indispensable were on that very account discounted: for early twentieth century modernists, for example, this included such Victorian relics as the bourgeois novel and theatrical melodramas – both of which exerted a strong shaping influence on early cinema and so to speak helped damn it by association. Such deprecations of the popular/mass may partly be attributed to the cultural privilege attached to ‘originality’ by post-Romantic literary theory. Whereas earlier ages had judged works of literature according to their upholding or replication of, and consistency with, pre-existing standards of artistic excellence and ‘decorum’, from the late eighteenth century onwards aesthetic theory laid increasing stress on the irreducible particularity of the artwork – that is, the ways in which it stretched or transgressed the ‘laws’ of good taste, craftsmanship, and so forth (see Kress and Threadgold, 1988). In the age of industrialisation, a growing divide grew up between the ‘merely’ workmanlike or ‘well-crafted’ artefact – with the implication that such works were the products of apprenticeship and the acquisition of essentially mechanical skills – and the ‘true’ work of art; the latter was increasingly seen as the product of inspiration not perspiration, of genius not hard graft. Art, in short, was henceforth to stand outside rules and conventions: that is what made it art. Writing in the 1930s, Walter Benjamin ([1936] 1970) noted that the work of art had come to acquire an ‘aura’ born in part of its uniqueness and indivisibility, an ‘aura’ that facilitated art’s institutionalisation as secular cult. A definition of art that places such heavy emphasis on originality and selfexpression will inevitably tend to devalue works that appear to be produced through collective rather than individual endeavour, and along quasi-industrial lines: this will be all the more true when the resulting artefacts themselves seem to manifest qualities of repetition and stereotypicality, or when they seem to have been designed with an existing template in mind. Questions of\n\n  \n\n9\n\nauthorship are implicitly invoked by such critiques of genre – for in the new aesthetic orthodoxy that emerged out of Romanticism, the individual author had become the best guarantee of a work’s integrity and uniqueness. So it is wholly logical that it was through the category of authorship that the first serious critical attempt to recover Hollywood genre texts like Westerns and musicals for the category of ‘art’ was undertaken, in the French auteur criticism of the 1950s. Auteurism seeks to (and claims to be able to) identify submerged patterns of continuity – thematic preoccupations, characteristic patterns of narrative and characterisation, recognisable practices of mise-enscène and the like – running through films with (usually) the same director. Establishing such individuating traits makes a claim for that director’s creative ‘ownership’ of the films he has directed: the director earns a status as a creative originator – an auteur – along the traditional lines of the lone novelist or painter. Thus, for example, John Ford’s films can be seen to work through a repeated pattern of thematic opposition between wilderness and civilisation (‘the desert and the garden’): this is Ford’s auteurist ‘signature’ (see Caughie, 1981). Although the limitations of auteurism are often correctly identified as an important factor motivating the development of genre studies, without auteurism it is doubtful genre would have made it onto the critical agenda at all. Auteurism proved particularly effective in establishing the serious critical reputation of directors who had rarely if ever hitherto been conceived of as artists because their entire careers had been spent filming Westerns, gangster pictures, musicals and the like – quintessentially disposable US junk culture. The American auteurist critic Andrew Sarris proposed a model of ‘creative tension’ between the creative drive of the film director and the constraints of the commercial medium in which he worked. Thus, for Sarris, whether a director could stamp his own artistic personality and concerns on essentially stereotypical material was in a sense the qualifying test for being awarded auteur status. Auteurism at least drew genre texts within the scope of serious critical attention. However, within auteur criticism genre itself remained very much the poor relation – since the unspoken assumption in Sarris’s schema that auteurs were more deserving of critical consideration than non-auteurs (or as François Truffaut notoriously classified them, mere ‘metteurs-en-scène’) relied in turn on the claim that what distinguished an auteur was precisely his transformation of formulaic generic material into something personal. Genre is thus in some measure the culture – like a petri dish – on which genius feeds, rather than meaningful material in its own right. Directors and films that strain against or break the limits of their given genre are thus evaluated as ‘superior’ to texts that remain unashamedly and unproblematically, even banally, generic. In this way auteurism recapitulated the birfurcation, familiar\n\n10\n\n \n\nas we have seen since the early 1800s, of (true) ‘artist’ and (mere) journeyman. It was the transcendence, not the comfortable inhabitation, of genre that marked the auteur (as nouvelle vague film-makers, the original French auteurist critics mostly used genre as a framework for transgressive individualising gestures). Obviously, such an approach will discourage sustained attention to the particularity of genres themselves, other than as tedious normative values for the inspired artist to transgress or transcend. The desire to find a means of talking about the things that typified conventional commercial narrative film as well as those that challenged or subverted it, was a governing factor in the emergence of genre studies in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Early genre critics stressed auteurism’s inability to explain such important questions as why genres flourish or decline in particular cycles; how spectators relate to generic texts; how genre artefacts shape the world into more or less meaningful narrative, moral or ideological patterns – in other words film genre’s history, its aesthetic evolution, its social contexts. The problems facing early film genre theorists were not especially recondite, and indeed have not changed fundamentally in the thirty-five years since Edward Buscombe first tabled them: [T]here appear to be three questions one could profitably ask: first, do genres in the cinema really exist, and if so, can they be defined? second, what are the functions they fulfill? and third, how do specific genres originate or what causes them? (Buscombe, [1970] 1995: 11) Most accounts concur that generic labelling historically preceded organised genre production in early cinema, with distributors prior to 1910 classifying films in a variety of ways including length as well as topic for the benefit of exhibitors. During and after the First World War, with film production in all national cinemas increasingly concentrated in a small number of studios and feature-length narratives becoming the norm, more closely defined and conventionalised generic categories started to appear. Altman (1998: 16–23) suggests that the crystallisation of a genre may be traceable in its evolving nomenclature, as the defining term moves from adjectival and modifying (as in ‘Western melodrama’) to substantival (‘the Western’). This shift also seems to mark a shift of emphasis in terms of production, as genre concepts move from the descriptive to the prescriptive: a ‘Western melodrama’ is simply a melodrama (a term generally used by exhibitors before the First World War to describe non-comic dramatic narratives of any type) set in the American West; a ‘Western’ is a film set specifically in the historical West that also involves certain strongly conventionalised types of characters, plots and, rather more debatably, thematic motifs or ideological positions.\n\n  \n\n11\n\nSince such a degree of conventionalisation obviously happens over a large number of films, the concept of film genre in turn implies a system for something like the mass production of films. The studio systems that developed in Europe as well as the USA during the 1920s all relied on genre production in some measure, but it was in the American film industry, the world’s largest, that genre became most fundamentally important. Most theories of film genre are based primarily on analysis of the Hollywood studio system. Contemporary theories acknowledge Tom Ryall’s (1975) argument that genre criticism needs to triangulate the author–text dyad in which auteurism conceived meaning by recognising the equal importance of the role of the audience as the constituency to which the genre film addresses itself. The resulting model recognises genre as an interactional process between producers – who develop generic templates to capitalise on the previously established popularity of particular kinds of film, always with a view to product rationalisation and efficiency – and generically literate audiences who anticipate specific kinds of gratification arising from the genre text’s fulfilment of their generic expectations. Thus, as Altman summarises: A cinema based on genre films depends not only on the regular production of recognizably similar films, and on the maintenance of a standardized distribution/exhibition system, but also on the constitution and maintenance of a stable, generically trained audience, sufficiently knowledgeable about genre systems to recognize generic cues, sufficiently familiar with genre plots to exhibit generic expectations, and sufficiently committed to generic values to tolerate and even enjoy in genre films capricious, violent, or licentious behaviour which they might disapprove of in ‘real life’. (Altman, 1996: 279) The importance of the audience is worth emphasising here since, as we shall see, in most genre theory and criticism the audience has remained a somewhat elusive presence, notionally an indispensable interlocutor in the generic process but in practice, in the general absence of clear evidence about its historical composition, remaining largely a projected and undifferentiated function of the text (or rather, of the meanings ascribed to the text), its responses ‘read’ at best largely in terms of the spectator ‘implied’ by the genre text.2 The difficulty of verifying the responses conjectured for historical genre audiences helps explain why the unfolding history of film genres and critical readings of genre films have dominated critical discussion. Broadly speaking, genre criticism has evolved through three stages, each of which roughly corresponds to one of Buscombe’s three questions. A first phase focused on classification – the definition and delimitation of individual genres. A second stage, overlapping with the first, focused on the meanings of\n\n12\n\n \n\nindividual genres and the social function of genre in general, within broadly consensual generic definitions and canons – principally, through analyses that understood genre in terms of either ritual or ideology (as we shall see, there is some overlap between the terms). Alongside influential works of genre theory, mostly in essay form, several book-length studies of individual genres, each informed by a distinctive understanding of genre but tending to follow either the ritual or the ideological approach, were produced in this period, including Basinger’s (1986) study of the war/combat film, Sobchack’s (1980, 1987) study of science fiction, analyses of the Western by Wright (1975) and Slotkin (1992), Doane’s (1987) study of the 1940s ‘woman’s film’, Altman’s (1987) book on musicals and Krutnik’s (1991) study of film noir. Finally (to date), more recent scholarship, as part of a generally renewed interest across film studies in understanding film historically and reacting in particular to what has been seen as the second phase’s at times essentialist and decontextualised accounts of genre identities, has focused on the historical contexts of genre production – the forms inherited from other media like the novel and the popular theatre, and the institutional practices (studio policy, marketing and publicity, modes of consumption, and so on) through which genres become available, in all senses of the term, to audiences. The very earliest studies of film genres, of which probably the best-known are essays by André Bazin ([1956] 1971] on the Western, and by Robert Warshow ([1943], 1975a, [1954] 1975b) on the Western and the gangster film,3 were only indirectly concerned to define their novel objects of study: that is, in the very act of arguing for the serious critical consideration of popular film genres they were necessarily performing some basic definitional work. Like many later writers, Bazin set the Western within existing narrative traditions, drawing parallels with traditional ‘high’ literary forms such as the courtly romance; he indicates core thematic material, proposing the relationship between individual morality and the greater communal good, or the rule of law and natural justice, as the issue which charges the genre; and he makes the first attempt at establishing a genre ‘canon’, identifying the period 1937–40 as the Western’s moment of ‘classic perfection’ – with John Ford’s Stagecoach (1939) as the ‘ideal’ Western – and contrasting this with the postwar period when large-budget ‘superwesterns’ strayed from the true generic path by importing topical political, social or psychological concerns that Bazin sees as extraneous to the genre’s core concerns (although the ‘B’ Westerns of the 1950s in his opinion maintained the form’s original vigour and integrity). Both Bazin and – especially – Warshow based their arguments on a rather small sample of genre films (just three in the case of Warshow’s gangster essay), and treated genre history, by today’s academic standards, rather casually (Bazin identifies as examples of 1950s ‘B’ Westerns such major studio releases as The Gunfighter (1950), and simply ignores the thirty-five\n\n  \n\n13\n\nyears of Western genre production before Stagecoach (for more on problems of sampling and genre history in relation to the Western, see Chapter 3). Most fundamentally, while Bazin and Warshow both insisted on the integrity and distinctiveness of generic character, their project did not extend to considering the means whereby individual Westerns or gangster films can be identified as such in order to then be periodised, classified or evaluated. Setting the terms for such recognition then became the project of the first wave of genre theorists proper starting in the late 1960s.\n\n   Fairly early in the development of film genre theory, Andrew Tudor succinctly nailed an inescapable and basic crux in trying to define individual genres. Noting that most studies of this kind start out with a ‘provisional’ notion of the field they are working on that they then set out to define more clearly, he suggests there is a basic problem of circularity: To take a genre such as the ‘western’, analyse it, and list its principal characteristics, is to beg the question that we must first isolate the body of films which are ‘westerns’. But they can only be isolated on the basis of the ‘principal characteristics’ which can only be discovered from the films themselves after they have been isolated. (Tudor, [1973] 1976: 135) Only very recently has the focus on industrial discourses and ‘relays’ suggested a means of squaring this circle. Much previous work on genre definitions either ignores the problem or proposes itself as an empirical approach that nonetheless clearly begs the questions Tudor asks. In his 1970 essay quoted above, Edward Buscombe proposed to identify genres through their iconography (a term derived from art theory) – their characteristic ‘visual conventions’, such as settings, costume, the typical physical attributes of characters and the kinds of technologies available to the characters (six-shooters in the Western, for example, or tommy-guns and whitewalled motorcars with running boards in the gangster film). These iconographic conventions were to be seen not only as the formal markers of a given genre, but as important vehicles for explicating its core thematic material: in a celebrated passage, Buscombe ([1970] 1995: 22–4) analyses the opening of Sam Peckinpah’s Ride the High Country (UK: Guns in the Afternoon) and notes how the juxtaposition of conventional and non-conventional (a policeman in uniform, a motor car, a camel) Western elements, with the non-conventional ones variously signifying progress or at least change, by disturbing the genre’s standard iconographic balance communicates the\n\n14\n\n \n\nfilm’s ‘essential theme’, the passing of the Old West. Iconography was also central to Colin McArthur’s (1972) Underworld USA, a book-length study of the gangster film. Iconographic analysis is as subject to Tudor’s circularity charge as any other, but its taxonomic value is apparent: an empirically derived set of generic attributes helps both to establish the dominant visual motifs and by extension the underlying structures of a genre, and to determine membership of that genre. A particular strength, as Buscombe pointed out, is that iconographies are grounded in the visuality of the film medium: they are literally what we see on-screen. Moreover, as the conventional meanings that audiences understood to inhere in iconographic devices (for example, the Westerner’s horse) derived not from the genre alone, but from the interplay between common-sense understandings of their valences and their specific generic usage (as Buscombe notes in his analysis of Ride the High Country, in Westerns the horse is ‘not just an animal but a symbol of dignity, grace and power’), iconography potentially established a porous frontier where the generic/textual and the social interacted with one another – hence a basis for discussing a genre’s larger socio-cultural currency. Finally, inasmuch as iconographic analysis took its force from those elements that were repeatedly or consistently present in genre entries, it centred on those very qualities – conventionality and repetition – by which genre as a whole is typified. One limitation of iconographic analysis was its limited applicability. Buscombe and McArthur focused on the Western and the gangster film, well-established and familiar genres that both lend themselves particularly well to iconographic interpretation. However, as several writers who have tried and failed to discover such well-defined and defining visual conventions in other major genres (comedy, biopics, social problem films, etc.) have noted, the very consistency of their iconographic conventions makes these genres atypical of film genre generally; the Western is particularly unusual in having such a tightly defined physical and historical setting (see Chapter 3). Also, iconography’s interest in film as a visual art form, a considerable virtue, stalled in the pro-filmic (the space framed by the camera) and failed to engage with visual style (camera movement, editing, etc.). Nor did it seem to offer a means of identifying and discussing narrative structures, although narrative models – such as the musical’s basic ‘boy meets girl, boy dances with girl, boy gets girl’ template – probably form as or more important a part of the audience’s expectational matrix than abstracted iconographies. An issue to which the discussion of iconography interestingly relates is that of generic verisimilitude, since one function of visual conventions is to establish a representational norm, deviation from which constitutes generic discrepancy (which can of course also be generic innovation). These norms are in turn bound up with our sense of what is likely or acceptable in the given generic context, which may or may not relate to our understanding of\n\n  \n\n15\n\nFrom Son of Frankenstein (1939). Reproduced courtesy Universal/The Kobal Collection.\n\nwhat is possible or plausible in our lived reality. Regimes of verisimilitude are generically specific, and each bears its own relation to reality as such. Many genres include ‘unmarked’ verisimilitudes – like the laws of the physical universe – whose observance can simply be taken for granted and establishes the continuity of the generic world with that of the spectator. On the other hand, the suspension of those laws (teleportation, travelling faster than light or through time) may form a basic and recognised element of the verisimili-\n\n16\n\n \n\ntude of an outer-space science fiction film. As discussed in Chapter 4, the classic Hollywood musical has its own quite distinct, specific and readily recognisable verisimilitude. Altman’s summary of the genre audience quoted above suggests that the audience’s willingness to ‘license’ certain departures from what would normally be considered desirable and/or believable behaviour constitutes an important part of the generic contract. (For fuller discussions of genre and verisimilitude, see Neale, 2000: 31–9; King, 2002: 121f.) Considerations of verisimilitude extend iconography’s implicit socialisation of genre convention further into the domain of the everyday and this has important implications for discussions of generic meanings (see below). Clearly, too, while iconographic conventions are entailed in verisimilitudes, so are the narrative dimensions iconography leaves out. Yet lifelikeness, even conventionalised lifelikeness, is not the principal agent of generic form. The model for genre analysis proposed by Rick Altman ([1984] 1995, 1987) seems usefully to combine many of the strengths of each approach. Altman argues that genres are characterised, or organised, along two axes which he nominates, employing linguistic terminology, the semantic and the syntactic. If the semantic axis involves the ‘words’ spoken in a genre, the syntactic concerns the organisation of those ‘words’ into ‘sentences’ – into meaningful and intelligible shape. Every film in a particular genre shares a set of semantic elements, or components: these certainly include traditional iconographic aspects like setting, costume and the like, but range more widely, taking in characteristic narrative incidents, visual style and even (as hard as this might be to quantify) typical attitudes. A contemporary action blockbuster like Face/Off (1997), then, might number among its semantic components portable armaments ranging from automatic pistols to light artillery, car (or boat or plane) chases, large set-piece action sequences usually involving explosions and/or the destruction of buildings and expensive consumer durables (the aforementioned cars, boats, planes), and a distinct disregard for the value of human life. Genre films’ syntactic dimension involves their characteristic arrangement of these semantic elements in plots, thematic motifs, symbolic relationships, and so on. (Face/Off shares a recurrent motif of 1990s action films: the hero’s defence or reconstruction of the family through, paradoxically enough, ever-greater violence to and destruction of people and objects – see Chapter 10.) Altman (1996: 283–4) adds that whereas semantic elements usually derive their meanings from pre-existing social codes, generic syntax is more specific and idiosyncratic and thus more fully expresses the meaning(s) of a given genre. The major problem of Altman’s interpretative matrix, as Altman himself acknowledges, is knowing where to draw the line between the semantic and syntactic. For example, if as suggested above spectacular action sequences are a semantic ‘given’ in the action film, it would be highly surprising if at least\n\n  \n\n17\n\none of these did not occur at the climax of the film and resolve the central narrative conflict – in other words, enter into the syntactic field. Questions of definition eventually became somewhat discredited as insufficiently critical and inertly taxonomic, and genre studies started to focus increasingly on the functions of genre. Recently, however, genre definition(s) have been put back into critical play. Collins (1993) and others have argued that postmodern tendencies to generic mixing or hybridity call into question the traditional fixity of genre boundaries.4 Perhaps partly in response to this, a historicist trend has emerged – Gledhill (2000) compares it to the influential ‘new historicism’ in literary studies in the late 1980s – that has used the empirical analysis of how genre terms were and are used within the film industry itself (by producers and exhibitors) to reassess traditional understandings of and claims about the historical basis of genres. This has indeed challenged some fundamental assumptions about genre stability and boundaries, and suggests that much of the postmodern preoccupation with generic hybridity relies on a historically unsupported notion of classical genres as far more rigid and secure and much less porous and prone to generic mixing than was actually the case. One does not have to delve very deep into genre history to find examples of generic mixing: for example, a quick scan reveals Western musicals (Calamity Jane, 1953; Paint Your Wagon, 1969), Western melodramas (Duel in the Sun, 1946; Johnny Guitar, 1950), noir Westerns (Pursued, 1948; The Furies, 1950; Rancho Notorious, 1952), horrorWesterns (Billy the Kid vs. Dracula, 1965; Grim Prairie Tales, 1990), even science fiction Westerns (Gene Autry in The Phantom Empire, 1935). Neale (2000: 43) argues that the industry’s ‘inter-textual relay’ (see above) must constitute the primary evidential basis both for the existence of genres and for the boundaries of any particular generic corpus: … it is only on the basis of this testimony that the history of any one genre and an analysis of its social functions can begin to be produced. For a genre’s history is as much the history of a term as it is of the films to which the term has been applied; is as much a history of the consequently shifting boundaries of a corpus of texts as it is of the texts themselves. (Neale, 2000: 43)\n\n   As we have seen, early genre studies, in aiming to introduce and identify the core groupings of films in key genres, also made observations about the function of genres; indeed, these played an important part in their argument for the value of genre texts. However, they typically stopped short of theories\n\n18\n\n \n\nof genre as a whole. Subsequent critics advanced various theories of the kinds of meanings that could be derived from the genre text. Despite diverse approaches, they commonly centred on an understanding of genre as a form of social practice – as ritual, myth or ideology. All were motivated by the conviction that film genre offered a privileged insight into ‘how to understand the life of films in the social’ (Gledhill, 2000: 221). And all proceeded from a shared basic assumption about how that insight was generated. Genre films by definition are collective rather than singular objects: their meanings are comprised relationally rather than in isolation. Whereas to attempt to ‘read off’ social or political debates in the broader culture onto individual films is thus likely to prove reductive and speculative, the sheer number of films in a given genre means that changes in generic direction and attitudes across time may reasonably be understood as responses and/or contributions to the shifting concerns of their mass public. Genre films solicit audience approval through both continuity and variation; audience responses encourage genre film-makers to pursue existing generic directions or to change them. The closely linked concepts of ‘myth’ and ‘ritual’ aim to relate this transaction to the underlying desires, preoccupations and fantasies of audiences and to ascribe these in turn to the social and cultural contexts in and through which film genres and their audiences are equally constituted. In the standard anthropological sense, ‘myth’ denotes something like an expression of archetypes on the part of a particular community (grounded in that community’s social experience of the natural world and/or its collective human psychology). Sometimes ‘myth’ is invoked in genre criticism in precisely this sense: in his study of the Western, Wright (1975: 187) states that ‘the Western, though located in a modern industrial society, is as much a myth as the tribal myths of the anthropologists.’ More often, as applied to popular media forms, myth in its most neutral formulation designates forms of (culturally specific) social self-representation, the distillation and enactment of core beliefs and values in reduced, usually personalised and narrative, forms. Myth is also characterised by specific kinds of formal stylisation, for example extreme narrative and characterological conventionalisation. The strongest influence on mythic readings of popular culture is the structuralist anthropology of Claude Lévi-Strauss, which argues that the role of myth is to embody in schematic narrative form the constitutive contradictions of a society – typically in the form of pairs or networks of strongly opposed characters/values – while through the stories woven about these oppositions, and formally in the fact of their integration into mythic narrative, partially defusing their potentially explosive force. Thus in film genre theory, ‘myth’ broadly designates the ways in which genres rehearse and work through these shared cultural values and concerns by rendering them in symbolic narratives. ‘Ritual’ meanwhile redefines the regular consumption of genre films by\n\n  \n\n19\n\na mass public as the contractual basis on which such meanings are produced. The ritual and mythological models of genre quickly encounter genre theory’s characteristic problems, noted earlier, with the audiences whose participation in generic ritual plays so central a role. Thus although mythological analyses frequently pay scrupulous attention to individual genre texts and carefully differentiate their negotiations of generic conventions, the audience features as a homogeneous and largely notional presence. The prevailing assumption appears to be that audiences seek out, and respond to, the mythological address of the genre film – what the Marxist theorist of ideology Louis Althusser would term their ‘interpellation’ – in the same ways. There seems little possibility of concretising this claim, at least as regards historical audiences. Box-office popularity – of individual films or of entire genres – is sometimes cited as an apparently objective criteria for demonstrating the popularity of a genre – hence of the values sedimented within it. Yet to purchase a ticket for a film of course does not (as academics studying popular films would certainly have to acknowledge) necessarily prove assent to all or indeed any of a film’s ideological content. It is also enormously difficult to compute popularity: Westerns, for example, were by no means universally popular and were shown by audience surveys in the 1930s to be strongly disliked by a considerable proportion of movie-goers. Regular Western fans, however, were dedicated followers of the genre and likely to see most or all the Westerns that made it to their local theatre: thus the reliable market that supported the huge number of ‘B’ (or series) Westerns produced during the 1930s. Does this narrow but deep audience base make the Western more or less representative of the national temper than a genre with a broader but perhaps less ‘committed’ following, such as screwball comedy? To complicate matters further, recent research has shown how even the most apparently orthodox and classical genre films were not necessarily universally perceived in that way at the time of their original release. Leland Poague (2003: 89) demonstrates that Stagecoach, partly to counteract the Western’s received image at the end of the 1930s, a decade dominated by ‘B’ Westerns, was publicised in ways that de-emphasised the film’s generically ‘Western’ aspects (which would limit its appeal to exhibitors and audiences, especially in metropolitan areas) in favour of elements of broader appeal such as the dramatic interactions of a disparate group of characters in enforced proximity (‘Grand Hotel on wheels’, as a contemporary review put it) or the (hardly realised) promise of sexual tension among ‘2 women on a desperate journey with 7 strange men!’. While the expectations created around a film do not of course exhaust its range of possible meanings, such examples indicate that large assertions about the ritual function of individual genres are equally incapable of dealing with the range of responses audiences may bring to bear on any single genre film.\n\n20\n\n \n\nClaims that the Western or the musical articulate dominant or foundational paradigms for American national identity also need to take account of the presence within the same industry at the same time of genre films that seem directly to challenge those values: film noir, for example.5 In the most influential argument for genre as ritual, Thomas Schatz (1981, 1983) partly addresses the latter question by identifying different genres with different sets of key American ideas and dilemmas. Each genre has its own ‘generic community’: thus what emerges as a social problem (or dramatic conflict) in one genre is not necessarily a problem in another. Law and order is a problem in the gangster film, but not in the musical. Conversely, courtship and marriage are problems in the musical but not in the gangster and detective genres. (Schatz, 1981: 25) In so far as these problems are discrete, each genre has its own specific set of concerns and performs a particular kind of cultural work; in so far as these issues are generally relevant to American life, the system of Hollywood genres as a whole enables a kind of ongoing national conversation about such issues. The classical Hollywood studio system, Schatz argues, was especially well-suited to this ‘ongoing discourse – the process of cultural exchange’ because of its mass production of genre films and domination of the American popular imagination (1981: 20–8). In the diversified entertainment markets and weaker generic landscape of the New Hollywood, by contrast, as Schatz acknowledges in his 1983 book, this conversation and hence the movies’ ritual function is greatly weakened. In its association of core generic preoccupations with specific ritual functions, Schatz’s argument seems to presuppose a degree of generic segregation and consistency the generic record hardly bears out. The two examples quoted above – the musical and the gangster film – are rendered as distinct and their concerns clearly differentiated. It is certainly advantageous to have a model of genre that allows for the possibility of different ‘solutions’ to comparable problems in line with the changing cultural understandings that subtend such solutions (see, for example, the analysis of New York, New York, 1977, in Chapter 4 below). But where does this leave a gangster musical like Guys and Dolls (1955)? Alternatively, what are likely to be the ‘problems’ tackled by a series of detective films about a married couple (like the popular Thin Man series, 1934–47)? Schatz also seems to overstate generic homogeneity – not all musicals, for example, are about courtship and marriage (backstage musicals, an extremely important sub-genre, may be at least as much about professional prestige). Myth-based readings of genre are related to ideological critiques: in a\n\n  \n\n21\n\nfoundational text of semiotic analysis, indeed, Roland Barthes (1957) names the pervasive ideological fictions in contemporary capitalist culture as, precisely, ‘mythologies’. Place (1978: 35) states that popular myth ‘both expresses and reproduces the ideologies necessary to the existence of the social structure’. Yet in general myth is, as Neale observes, ideological criticism minus the criticism: that is, whereas writers such as Judith Hess Wright ([1974] 1995) identify genre’s ideological dimension with its provision of imaginary and bogus resolutions to the actual contradictions of lived experience under capitalism, proponents of genre as myth tend to a more neutral descriptive account of how genres satisfy the needs and answer the questions of their audiences. In other words, they do not stigmatise such satisfactions as delusion designed to maintain individuals and communities in acquiescent ignorance of the real conditions of their oppression. Moreover, the dialectical nature of the Lévi-Straussian schema implies that underlying social contradictions are less resolved away than repeatedly re-enacted and thus – at least in principle – exposed by their mythic articulations. Initial ideological accounts of genre like Wright’s often imputed a somewhat monolithic character to the ideological work performed by genre films. As products of a capitalist film industry, genre films must necessarily produce meanings that support the existing social relations of power and domination: their ideological function, in fact, is precisely to organise perceptions of the world in such a way as to elicit acquiescence and assent to the proposition that this is not only the way the world is, but the way it ought to be – or even the only way it ever could be. In Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer’s excoriating account of the ‘culture industry’ ([1944] 1972: 120–67), the standardising imperatives of genre production signified the absolute unfreedom of contemporary mass media forms (and conversely the relative – and only relative – truth-content of their mirror-image counterparts, the recondite practices of high modernist art). On an ideological analysis, genre closes off alternatives, resists multiple meanings and symbolically resolves real contradictions in imaginary (here meaning illusory) ways. Specific generic outcomes (like the gangster’s exemplary fate reiterating that ‘crime does not pay’) also work to promote a larger pattern of acquiescence in conventional and rule-governed methods of ‘solving’ problems. One would have to say that if the genre system is as secure and sealed as this view holds, it is hard to see where the impetus for any kind of change comes from – still less why a genre might be moved to perform the kinds of quite radical self-critique undertaken by numerous Hollywood Westerns, musicals, gangster films and other traditional genre films during the 1970s, a move that moreover encompassed explicit criticism of the violence and racial prejudice of American society (as in such ‘counterculture’ films as Easy\n\n22\n\n \n\nRider, 1969, or the contemporaneous ‘Vietnam Westerns’: see also below). Of course, American society and the core ideologies sedimented in its principal cultural forms confronted a major crisis of legitimation in the late 1960s; but with contemporary opinion polls showing a majority of Americans still supporting conservative positions on war, race and sexual/gender issues, genre films ought to have been working harder than ever to sustain rather than to challenge the status quo. Ideological analysis also seems to have difficulty acknowledging the real differences between genres: even if the ‘affirmative’ nature of Westerns and musicals is granted, this still leaves unaccounted for the strongly critical charge of much film noir, to say nothing of the gangster film’s historically well-attested ideological ambivalence (see Chapter 6). In this sense, ideological criticism’s view of genre is both too reductive – in that all genre films are held to relentlessly promote a singular message of conformity – and not reflective enough – in that it seems not to allow for the possibility of interference in core genre propositions by changes in social and cultural context such as those powerfully at work in American society from the late 1960s onwards. The virtual disappearance of the ‘woman’s film’ since the 1960s, to take another example, seems hard to account for without acknowledging the impact of the women’s movement on traditional concepts of gender roles (see Chapter 2). Ideological criticism in the later 1970s generally started to modify the inflexible model inherited from Althusserian Marxism, inspired in particular by the rediscovery of the writings of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci in the 1920s. Gramsci’s concept of ‘hegemony’ reinscribed ideological domination as an ongoing process in which dominant orthodoxies continually struggled to retain their mastery over both residual (older and outmoded) and emergent (newer and potentially revolutionary) positions. Applying this to the study of popular culture allowed critics to trace the fractures and contradictions in the apparently seamless structure of classical Hollywood, and thus to discover ways in which even the genre film could – perhaps unconsciously – take up positions at variance with dominant ideology. Much contemporary film analysis remains rooted in the critique of ideology, in fact, in the sense that it addresses itself to the ways in which films work through (or act out, to use psychotherapeutic terminology) the values and interests of different groups in society. An increasing dissatisfaction with the older monolithic models of ideological domination, however, as well as the waning of explicit Marxist critical affiliations, means that analyses focused on issues of gender, race, ethnicity or sexuality – and on the ways that the popular media structure attitudes towards minority groupings – are less clearly marked as ideology critique in the older sense.\n\n  \n\n23\n\n   The ‘revisionist’ tendency evident across several major Hollywood genres in the 1970s (including the Western, the gangster, private-eye and police thriller, and the musical) impelled several genre theorists to propose ‘evolutionary’ models of generic development. According to John Cawelti: One can almost make out a life cycle characteristic of genres as they move from an initial period of articulation and discovery, through a phase of conscious self-awareness on the part of both creators and audiences, to a time when the generic patterns have become so wellknown that people become tired of their predictability. It is at this point that parodic and satiric treatments proliferate and new genres generally arise. (Cawelti, [1979] 1995: 244) Schatz (1981: 36–41) develops this theory of generic evolution much more systematically – indeed, naming it as such – yet follows the same basic outline, while grounding his account in his ‘ritual’ thesis. Thus ‘at the earliest stages of its life span’ a genre expresses its material in a direct and unselfconscious manner – because ‘if a genre is society speaking to itself, then any stylistic flourishes or formal self-consciousness will only impede the transmission of the message’. After this experimental stage where its conventions are established, the genre enters its classical stage (a phase beloved of genre theorists since Bazin). This stage is marked by ‘formal transparency. Both the narrative formula and the film medium work together to transmit and reinforce that genre’s social message … as directly as possible to the audience’ (emphasis in original). Eventually, the genre arrives at a point where ‘the straightforward message has “saturated” the audience’: the outcome is that the genre’s ‘transparency’ is replaced by ‘opacity’, manifested in a high degree of formalistic self-consciousness and reflexivity. Schatz suggests that both the musical and the Western had reached such a stage by the early 1950s, and he cites as examples such ‘self-reflexive musicals’ as The Barkleys of Broadway (1949) and Singin’ in the Rain (1952) and ‘baroque Westerns’ like Red River (1948) and The Searchers (1955). At this stage the ‘unspoken’ conventions of the genre – the centrality of the courtship ritual to the musical, the heroic individualism of the Westerner – themselves become narratively foregrounded. From today’s perspective, however, the 1950s seems very far from the ultimate developmental stage of either the Western or the musical. All That Jazz (1980) and Heaven’s Gate (1980) are very different from An American in Paris (1951) or The Searchers (1955), and Moulin Rouge (2001) and The Missing (2004) are different again. So to be workable the evolutionary model\n\n24\n\n \n\nwould at least need extending: one would probably want to differentiate a further stage where ‘opaque’ self-consciousness intensifies yet further and mutates into outright genre ‘revisionism’: this period may also often be accompanied by a slowdown in the rate of production of genre films. ‘Revisionism’ implies that traditional genre attitudes may be seen as articulating a worldview no longer applicable, perhaps in changed social circumstances: thus a key aspect of revisionism is that the genre is no longer self-sufficient, but is critically scrutinised for its ability to offer a cognitive purchase on the contemporary world. Yet another ‘stage’ might involve the re-emergence of the genre under altered (industrial or cultural) circumstances, partially purged of its original ideological or mythic content (or those parts thereof which no longer speak to a contemporary spectatorship). Such texts never recover the unselfconsciousness of the ‘classical’ period, but equally they are neither as serious as the ‘mature’ period or as corrosively critical as the ‘revisionist’ period; rather, they will often display a playful degree of referentiality and generic porosity of the kind frequently regarded as characteristically postmodern, for example by injecting anachronistic elements into period settings (a ‘riot grrl’ Western like Bad Girls, 1994) or highlighting the racial diversity traditionally suppressed by the classical genre text (for example, the transformation of gangster to ‘gangsta’ in the New Black Cinema of the early 1990s). Such a model of generic development is appealingly straightforward. However – even if one overlooks the obvious objection that genres, as a form of industrial practice, are not organisms and to propose generic phylogenies of this kind risks a category error – it raises several problems. In the first place, its historical account smacks of special pleading – seemingly designed to justify the critical attention already bestowed on certain groups and periods of genre film. If one accepts the evolutionary model, the allegedly more complex and self-aware films of the ‘mature’ and ‘revisionist’ phases are always likely to command more attention than the straightforward presentations of generic material in the ‘classical’ period. In fact, as Tag Gallagher ([1936] 1995: 237) argues, earlier films are to an extent set up as naive ‘fall guys’ for later, allegedly more sophisticated, challenging and/or subversive approaches. However, as early film historians are quick to point out, many pictures from the silent and early sound periods in a variety of genres display a surprising degree of generic self-consciousness (surprising, that is, if one assumes as the evolutionary model suggests that these classical phases should be typified by the ‘straight’ presentation of generic material). In fact, the entire, rather literary, notion of self-consciousness, inwardness and reflexivity as a function of ‘late style’ seems to bear little relation to the realities of market positioning, a process which is more likely to be typified by a variety of approaches ranging from the steadfast and generically secure to the playful and experimental.\n\n  \n\n25\n\nAnother problem, as Neale (2000: 214f.) notes, is that the evolutionary model necessarily, despite Schatz’s (1981: 36) citation of ‘external (cultural, thematic) factors’, tends to attribute generic change to intra-generic factors: genre is in fact hypostatised, sealed off from social, cultural and industrial contexts. It is an idealised and implicitly teleological model (that is, its outcomes are predetermined). As Mark Jancovich (2002: 9) observes, ‘narrative histories of a genre … usually become the story of something … that exists above and beyond the individual moments or periods, an essence which is unfolding before us, and is either heading towards perfect realisation … or failure and corruption.’ Yet one of the most obvious examples of genre ‘revisionism’ already referred to, the cycle of strongly, even militantly proIndian Cavalry Westerns made at the start of the 1970s – such as Little Big Man, Soldier Blue (both 1970), Ulzana’s Raid and Chato’s Land (both 1971) – that depict white cavalrymen or paramilitaries almost to a man as venal, brutal, sadistic and exploitative and thus neatly invert many of the categories of the classic Western (in Solider Blue it is the white cavalrymen, not the Indians, who threaten the white heroine with rape, and at one point the soldiers break out in war-whoops while scalping an Indian brave), are transparently intended as allegories of and statements about US military involvement in Indochina: they are not ‘natural’ or inevitable outcomes of the generic lifecycle. Genre revisionism thus appears to be a function of larger trends within the American film industry, and in turn within American popular and political culture, as much as, or more than, of evolutionary change in a generic universe closed off from interaction with the world outside. Many critics indeed have found genre a useful tool for mediating large and hard-to-grasp socio-historical issues and popular media texts: rather than simply reading off, say, the cynicism and paranoia of the Watergate era onto bleak mid-1970s Westerns like Posse (1975) as a set of one-to-one correspondences, the idea of genre allows social reality to be mapped onto individual fictional texts in a more subtle and indeed plausible way. Robert Ray (1985: 248f.) has suggested that the binary ‘reflection’ model can helpfully be triangulated by the addition of the audience as the missing link between text and (social) context. Thus the accretion of conventions over the totality of a genre’s historical evolution, the film-maker’s modulation of these conventions and the role of the audience as both a participant in and in a sense the arbiter of this interactive process, together map the evolving assumptions and desires of the culture. In fact, research on the American and global film industry in the both its classical and contemporary periods has increasingly tended to suggest that the film studies’ preferred notion of genre is likely to need some important modifications. As far as the ‘New Hollywood’ (broadly speaking, Hollywood\n\n26\n\n \n\nsince the late 1960s, with an important watershed within that period around 1977) is concerned, new genres (or sub-genres) such as the ‘yuppie nightmare film’ (see Grant, 1998), the road movie (see Cohan and Hark, 1997; Laderman, 2002) or the serial killer film seem to be differently constituted than those of the classical period. Put simply, earlier generic structures – the individual genres and the system of genre production as a whole – were part of a system for mass-producing films in which regularised production, a carefully managed, monitored and highly centralised machinery of distribution and exhibition, and on the audience’s part regular moving-going in a relatively undiversified entertainment market, together enabled the kind of informal yet powerful generic ‘contract’ Altman describes. A well-known series of events over about 20 years starting in the late 1940s – including the legal ruling that compelled the studios to sell off their theatre chains; the rise of television, itself part of a general transformation of American lifestyles and leisure pastimes; the loss of creative freedoms and personnel as a result of the anti-Communist witch-hunts and blacklist of the 1950s – largely put a end to this system (see Ray, 1985: 129–52; Schatz, 1993; Krämer, 1998; King, 2002: 24–35). Over the course of the late 1950s and 1960s, the deceptively singular term ‘Hollywood’ masked an increasingly dispersed and decentralised industry in which agents, stars, directors and writers worked with independent producers to originate individual projects conceived outside the assemblyline and economy-of-scale principles of classic Hollywood. The role in this process of the major studios – who by the end of the 1960s had themselves mostly been taken over by larger conglomerates for whom the entertainment sector was merely one part of a diversified business portfolio – was in many cases limited to providing finance and distribution. The armies of craft and technical personnel who under the studio system had contributed so much to the stylistic continuities by which studio identities were defined, and who had made factory-style generic production possible, had long since been laid off. Although the 1980s and 1990s would see further major changes in the American film industry, including the major studios’ return to the exhibition sector in a changed regulatory climate as their corporate parents increasingly restructured themselves into dedicated, vertically integrated multimedia businesses (see Prince, 2000: 40–89), neither the majors’ ever-greater emphasis on blockbuster production (see Chapter 10) nor the rise of ‘independent’ production enabled anything like a return to the generic production of the 1930s. New genres such as those mentioned above are far more likely to appear as relatively short-lived cycles. The latter may in fact be a good deal less novel than this overview implies. In fact, an argument can be made that the very concept of ‘genre’ – if understood as it usually has been as a large, diachronic vehicle for producing and consuming meanings across a range of texts – needs radical modification\n\n  \n\n27\n\nif it is to be made relevant to the practices of an industry that has more often relied on shorter-term series or cycles of films seeking to capitalise upon proven seasonal successes or topical content. The fluctuating patterns of popularity and ideological address in genre films owe as much to contingent industrial factors as they do to generic evolution or the kinds of intra-generic dialectic favoured by critics. Writing in 1971, Lawrence Alloway argued that it was misleading to import into the study of popular cinema approaches to genre inherited from art criticism that sought out thematic continuity and universal concerns, insisting rather that Hollywood production was typified by ephemeral cycles seeking to capitalise on recent successes, hence by discontinuities and shifts in meaning and focus in what only appeared (or were critically constructed as) consistently evolving ‘genres’. Maltby (1995: 111–12) states flatly that ‘Hollywood never prioritised genre as such’, instead working in the studio era as today in ‘opportunistic’ ways to pull together elements from different genres into a profitable whole. Barbara Klinger (1994a) has proposed a category of ‘local genres’, such as the teen delinquent films of the mid-1950s (The Wild One, 1954; The Blackboard Jungle, Rebel Without a Cause, 1955), marked by clear topical affinities and competing in the same markets, and which comprise a clear and time-limited classification over a particular production cycle. An added irony is that even as the classic Hollywood system of genre production was disappearing, film genres – newly understood in the light of an industry ‘relay’ that for the first time included academic film criticism – took on an increasing importance as explicit points of creative reference for emerging New Hollywood film-makers. As is again well established, the writers and directors most strongly associated with the New Hollywood, the ‘movie brats’ of the 1970s (for example, Martin Scorsese, Paul Schrader, Peter Bogdanovich, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Brian dePalma) and their diverse successors (James Cameron, Robert Zemeckis, Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino), came to professional film-making through pathways (television, film school, film journalism) that equipped them with a different historical understanding of film culture than their classic Hollywood predecessors. Whether or not New Hollywood film-makers are actually more self-conscious and film-literate than (for example) John Ford, Howard Hawks or Nicholas Ray, or whether they simply possess and exploit those qualities in different ways, is an open question. However, as the web of generic intertextuality that enfolds (some might say constitutes) a film like Tarantino’s Kill Bill (2003, 2004) amply demonstrates, notwithstanding the end of the system that created and supported genre film production, the historical legacy of classical film genres clearly provides New Hollywood film-makers with a preferred means of establishing not only (in classic auteurist fashion) their own creative identities, but connecting to larger traditions of national\n\n28\n\n \n\nidentities, social conventions and ideology. In this sense, to adopt Altman’s (1996: 277) terminology, while ‘film genre’ may have become a questionable category, the ‘genre film’ remains very much alive. Between the institution(s) of film genre and the genre film text’s activation of those institutions are of course the structures of individual genres, each with its individual history, thematic concerns and representational traditions. But underlying and informing those structures there may also be less tangible modalities that can neither be identified firmly with larger ideological categories nor located or contained within individual genres. It is to such a modal form, crucial to the history and in all likelihood the future of American film genre, that the next chapter will turn its attention.\n\n 1. Though habitually confused, the terms are by no means synonymous and have been hotly debated: see Strinati (1995: 2–50). 2. A problem shared with film apparatus theory, which has some interesting affinities with genre theory. 3. On Warshow’s gangster essay, see Chapter 6 passim. 4. Staiger (2001), however, argues that ‘hybridity’ is an inappropriate concept to bring to bear on film. 5. Conversely, as Maltby ([1984] 1992: 57) points out, neither should noir be used, as it often has been, to embody the Zeitgeist. Either construction, he suggests, entails ‘a process of historical distortion which comes about from the practice of generic identification, and has [I might prefer to say, can have] the effect of imposing an artificial homogeneity on Hollywood production’.\n\n \n\nBefore Genre: Melodrama\n\nM\n\nost of this book is concerned with generic categories that have, over the course of decades of sustained production, established clear generic identities in the eyes of producers, audiences and critics alike. As discussed in Chapter 1, this does not mean that all or any of those groups share the same generic understandings, nor that these identities are in any way fixed or immutable. On the contrary, as Derrida observes, if the ‘law of genre’ dictates that every text belongs to a genre it also dictates that texts do not belong wholly to any one genre, hence that they can and will find themselves serving a range of different interests and put to a range of different uses in a variety of contexts of reception, distribution and consumption. Thus generic identities – those of genre texts, and those of genres themselves as ultimately the sum of the texts that comprise them – are provisional and subject to ongoing revision. Such observations apply strongly to melodrama. Critical debates in particular have played a governing role in consolidating melodrama’s generic paradigm(s). Indeed, no genre – not even the endlessly debated film noir – has been so extensively redefined through critical intervention. (On the contrary, as we shall see in Chapter 9, the initially esoteric critical conception of noir became naturalised by widespread usage to the point where noir eventually realised an autonomous generic existence within the contemporary Hollywood. By contrast, a gulf persists between the film-theoretical and the industrial understandings of ‘melodrama’.) By identifying melodrama with the allegedly marginal female-centred and oriented dramas of the studio era, feminist criticism in the 1970s and 1980s successfully overlaid a new definitional framework onto a long-standing industry category – a project that successfully reoriented the gender politics of film theory itself. Feminist criticism located melodrama in the intense pathos generated by narratives of maternal and romantic sacrifice in films such ‘women’s films’ as Stella Dallas (1937) and Now, Voyager (1942), and has fiercely debated the gender politics of these\n\n30\n\n \n\ntexts – the gendered social roles created by and for their female protagonists, and the ‘viewing positions’ they offer female spectators. Melodrama has also been identified with a rather different body of films, the emotionally wrought dramas of family conflict directed in the 1950s by Nicholas Ray (Rebel Without a Cause, 1955; Bigger Than Life, 1956), Elia Kazan (East of Eden, 1955) and above all Douglas Sirk (Magnificent Obsession, 1954; All That Heaven Allows, 1955; Written on the Wind, 1958; Imitation of Life, 1959), dubbed ‘family melodramas’ in the 1970s by such critics as Thomas Elsaesser ([1972] 1991), Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1977] 1991) and Chuck Kleinhans ([1978] 1991), whose high emotional pitch and ‘excessive’ visual style are held to effect a subversion of ideological norms.1 Behind and beyond all of these studio-era films in some way lay the melodramas of the silent era and further back still the legacy of popular nineteenth-century theatrical melodrama, a seemingly separate tradition whose connection to Ray, Sirk, et al. film studies has until recently conspicuously failed to address. Clearly, to what extent these strains constitute (a) genre(s) is a question that can be needs to be, and is endlessly debated. As in other areas of film genre studies, recent historical research has uncovered new fields of melodrama – notably in pre-Hollywood silent cinema – while problematising prevailing assumptions about others. The exact status of the ‘woman’s film’ as an industry category, for example, is open to question: while Rick Altman (1999: 27–33) labels it a ‘phantom genre’ (i.e. critically rather than industrially constructed), Steve Neale’s (2000: 188–94) research on the film industry’s own generic terminologies as reflected in the trade press from at least the 1920s to the 1950s indicates that the term was used from the 1910s onwards, but in neither as localised nor as consistent a way as feminist criticism has suggested. Recent research has also placed a question mark over the woman’s film’s ‘subaltern’ status in studio-era Hollywood, an important dimension of its retrieval/construction as a critical object. On the other hand, based on the same research methodology Neale (1993, 2000: 179–86) argues that in studio-era Hollywood at least ‘melodrama’ was a term which, while it could and did mean many things, rarely meant what ‘melodrama’ has come to mean in contemporary film studies and in particular meant almost anything but ‘women’s films’; ‘family melodrama’, meanwhile, is a term Neale declares himself unable to locate anywhere in this ‘industry relay’ at all. ‘Melodrama’ seems generally (though by no means exclusively) to have denoted blood-and-thunder dramas of passion, crime, injustice and retribution – in fact the term was widely used to describe films across (in standard genrecritical terms) a wide variety of classical genres, from Westerns to crime thrillers and exotic adventure films. Richard Maltby (1995: 111) notes that of the six major categories used to classify pictures for the Production Code Administration in the 1940s, melodrama was by far the largest, accounting\n\n : \n\n31\n\nfor between a quarter and a third of all production. A growing body of scholarship, starting with Gledhill (1987, 1994), has argued for the centrality to Hollywood film in general of a melodramatic mode that extends back to and derives directly from the popular nineteenthcentury stage. While the theatrical inheritance is most clearly visible in silent film, the melodramatic mode in this larger, even capacious conception extends well beyond the silent film-makers most readily associated with melodrama such as D. W. Griffith, into not only studio-era film, but contemporary Hollywood too. Moreover, this melodramatic ‘mode’ maps directly onto neither the earlier gender-based critical constructions of soundera melodrama (Sirk, Minnelli, the woman’s film, etc.) nor onto the ‘industry relay’ explored by Neale. As a set of narrative conventions, affective forms and ideological beliefs present across a wide variety of genres in different periods, melodrama is at once before, beyond and embracing the system of genre in US cinema as a whole. Linda Williams offers perhaps the clearest, as well as the most ambitious and far-reaching recent statement of this reconception of melodrama: Melodrama is the fundamental mode of popular American moving pictures. It is not a specific genre like the western or horror film; it is not a ‘deviation’ of the classical realist narrative; it cannot be located primarily in woman’s films, ‘weepies’, or family melodramas – though it includes them. Rather, melodrama is a peculiarly democratic and American form that seeks dramatic revelation or moral and emotional truths through a dialectic of pathos and action. It is the foundation of the classical Hollywood movie. (Williams, 1998: 42) Thus any discussion of film melodrama needs to begin not by defining the genre – because if Williams is right there are clear grounds for arguing that melodrama is not a genre in the same, relatively if always questionably welldefined, sense as the other genres described in this book – but by demarcating a field. Williams and several other writers, indeed, suggest that melodrama is a ‘mode’ or ‘tendency’ that has been taken up at different times and with different formal and stylistic characteristics in numerous different literary, theatrical, cinematic and more recently televisual genres (for example, soap operas). In her celebrated study of the woman’s film, Mary Ann Doane (1987: 72) suggests that, ‘[W]hether or not the term melodrama is capable of defining and delimiting a specific group of films, it does pinpoint a crucial and isolable signifying tendency within the cinema which may be activated differently in specific historical periods.’ I will be employing this notion of melodramatic ‘modalities’ in this chapter and elsewhere in this book. In a seminal study, Peter Brooks (1976) speaks of\n\n32\n\n \n\n‘the melodramatic imagination’, which he finds informing a wide variety of ni"
