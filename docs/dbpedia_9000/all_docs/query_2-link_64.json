        "text": "The Abominable Doctor Phibes\n\nThis Saturday night takeaway’s so full of strife. Anton decks anyone he thinks killed his wife.\n\nAbsolution\n\nOne boy’s a chump, the other’s a champ, and their teacher has made clear his fave. But one’s making up stories about a local tramp, and what’s this? A freshly dug grave?\n\nAlien\n\nIt’s a haunted house in space! Don’t let the thingy hug your face…\n\nThe Amazing Mr Blunden\n\nIt’s a tale where the hosts turn out to be ghosts. Climb up that wall Jamie, lest they be toast (again).\n\nAn American Werewolf In London\n\nHis name is John Landis, a scary-funny-sexy romp planned-is.\n\nAnd Now The Screaming Starts!\n\nEye eye, that's handy, thinks luckless young bride.

Craig Fairbrass works out. Liz Hurley gets 'em out. The end result? Absolutely nowt (worth watching).\n\nBizarre (Secrets Of Sex)\n\nIf you want to know about the birds and the bees, your parents are the ones to explain.

Into bathtub blood of young ladies does bung.\n\nCover Girl Killer\n\nSteptoe stalks the streets in his macintosh and specs, determined to get some non-consensual sex.\n\nCraze\n\nCamp antiques dealer strangles, stabs, burns and jumps-out-of-cupboards-at women of all varieties.\n\nThe Creeping Flesh\n\nThe way this fiend is created we just mustn’t linger.

All over the place, that’s the thing.\n\nDeadly Strangers\n\nA nutter’s escaped, the surrounding area’s in a flap. Is it the obvious one, or her from the Parent Trap?\n\nDeath Is A Number\n\nNine is the number you don’t want around, unless dead in your racing car you want to be found.\n\nDeath Line\n\nMind the doors!
