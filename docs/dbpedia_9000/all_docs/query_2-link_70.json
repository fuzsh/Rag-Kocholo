        "text": "Sometimes you just need kung fu girls fighting a drug ring in their school.\n\nThat’s what what we have this week – Lovely But Deadly. The film was made by David Sheldon, and he’s had a pretty good, long career as mostly a producer or executive. This is only one of three movies he directed (one of which he was not credited for), but he does have some pretty good writing and producing credits worth mentioning. To start, he wrote the movie Grizzly, and its long-to-finish-sequel Grizzly II: Revenge. He’s been involved with the films Abby, Devil Times Five, Sheba, Baby, The Evil, The Manitou, Dr. Phibes Rises Again, and a whole slew of blaxploitation flicks. Dude got around, but mostly got around the behind the scenes side of things as he doesn’t actually have a lot of actual on-screen credits.\n\nSure, many of his movies deal with animals having enough of our shit as human beings. This time around though, he decides to take it back to school with a tale of a cheerleader, nicknamed “Lovely”, who decides to go undercover to expose a drug ring after her brother overdoses and a bunch of kids get hooked on the junk. Also, she knows kung fu. I cannot emphasize that enough. Continue reading “Lovely But Deadly (1981)” →\n\nOh boy, do we have a LOT to talk about in this new B-Movie Enema. article. Oddly, the movie itself, Joel M. Reed’s controversial Bloodsucking Freaks from 1976, doesn’t really have a lot to discuss in terms of what is seen on the screen (don’t worry, I will be calling play-by-play nonetheless). No, there are two topics in particular to discuss in much greater detail.\n\nI’m not entirely sure where to start with this, so let’s start with the director, Joel M. Reed. He unfortunately passed away in a care facility in New York City just earlier this year. He’s one of the many unfortunate casualties due to the global pandemic that is COVID-19. He’s likely known best for making this movie, which drew the ire of many, many people when it was released. The release of the movie also had a couple alternate titles like The Incredible Torture Show and Sardu: Master of the Screaming Virgins. However, almost everyone knows this movie by the title Bloodsucking Freaks. That’s the name applied to it by Lloyd Kaufman when Troma came along to take over the distribution of the movie.\n\nThat began a long relationship with Kaufman that lasted up until Reed’s passing. Continue reading “Bloodsucking Freaks (1976)” →\n\nAh, the fan film. Pretty much from the moment home movie equipment became available to laypeople in the 1950s, people were shooting home movies. Aside from the basic recording of familial moments like Christmases, birthdays, Jimmy’s first orgy with Sally from across the street and that busload of Yugoslavian carnies passing through town that one summer, and the like, people liked making their own big, Hollywood adventures.\n\nMy grandpa liked making a bunch of silly movies with my mom and aunt and my oldest brother. My other two brothers had a Super 8 camera in the 70s and 80s and made lots of home movies. This wasn’t quite like the VHS camcorders and digital cameras that came in my day. Oh no… Most of the time it was silent. If you wanted sound, my brothers had to painstakingly overdub their dialog while watching the movie through a projector.\n\nFan films existed pretty much from the get-go too. In the 50s, I’m willing to bet lots of families dressed their little kids up as Bogey and Bacall or Superman and Lois. Shit, my brothers made a movie called Grime as a take on the immensely popular Grease. Their movie starred hunky heartthrob John Travoltastein. Anyway… Horror, established sci-fi properties, and superheroes tend to be general go-to genres for fan films nowadays.\n\nAnd this is what we have here – 1995’s Friday the 13th Part X – To Hell and Back starring a bunch of teenagers.\n\nContinue reading “Friday the 13th Part X – To Hell and Back (1995)” →\n\nOkay, so maybe last week I closed out one tradition on this site, but I still have a lot more that I can draw from!\n\nThat’s what’s up this week as, yet again, it’s time to check out a Norman J. Warren joint! This week’s movie is one that I often see a lot of negativity float about on social media sites and groups I belong to. I don’t care, I think this is a perfect example of the strangeness in one of Warren’s movies. I’m going to talk about Inseminoid.\n\nBut, here’s the deal. This movie is actually quite well liked in a few circles. First and foremost, it impressed Roger Corman who nearly hired Warren for movies he was producing. It was made on a shoestring budget, but that actually works in its favor as the cave where they filmed the scenes for the scientists doing their excavation produced the perfect effect Warren wanted. He also got a boost when the famed Shaw Brothers from Hong Kong provided half the budget. It was a little bit of a tortured set though. The cave provided little light and air, and it would often be damp and cause quite a few injuries to cast and crew. On top of that, Robin Clarke, an American actor cast as one of the more important roles, didn’t get along with Norman. The two clashed often. Continue reading “Inseminoid (1981)” →"
