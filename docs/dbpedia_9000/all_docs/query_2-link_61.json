        "text": "Grizzly (US: Pyramid, 1976)\n\nTagline: \"18 Feet of gut-crunching, man-eating terror!\"\n\nI have to say I loved this cover the moment I saw it.\n\nExcellent work by comic book great Neal Adams. We'll\n\nnever know how a bear that damn big snuck up on our\n\nsexy little camp bunny, but hell, who cares? Nobody\n\never said this stuff has to make sense. Anyway, as you\n\nmight have guessed, we're going slumming again with\n\nanother movie novelization. Grizzly was one of the\n\nmany movies knocked out to cash in on the success of\n\nJaws. Sort of a Jaws on land, if you can dig that. I was\n\ntwelve years old when I saw Spielberg's amazing film. This one showed up a year\n\nlater and I remember we were all very excited to see it. Like most movies back\n\nthen, it took forever and a day to show up at the theater in our small town...but\n\nwhen it did, man, we were pumped! A whole bunch us walked downtown to catch\n\nGrizzly on a Friday night. And you know what? Even though it was (obviously) not\n\nin the same class as the shark movie, we liked it. We really did. Fast forward\n\nthirty-odd years. I watched it on DVD and, well, to be honest, the thrill was gone,\n\nbaby. Then I read the book and...well, that's what we'll get into now.\n\nOkay. Now realistically, a novelization is probably only as good as the script it's\n\nbased on. Very often with these, the writer has no opportunity to see the film\n\nbefore he types out his version. And it's not unusual that he's given an earlier\n\nversion of the script to work from. Check out Alan Dean Foster's novelization of\n\nThe Thing. It's fun...but it's different and the shape-shifting monsters are never\n\nreally described in any detail (probably because Rob Bottin wasn't done making\n\nthem yet).\n\nSo far, here at Horror's Guilty Pleasures, we have looked at three other\n\nnovelizations, which proves we can slum with the best of 'em-- Piranha, Return of\n\nthe Living Dead, and Inseminoid. Piranha was very good. Return of the Living\n\nDead was fair. Inseminoid...well, like the movie, fucking indescribable.\n\nLet's take a look at Grizzly. It was written by Will Collins who I've never heard of\n\nand was probably the producer's brother-in-law or something. No matter. Collins\n\nwrites with all the flair and imagination of a newspaper article. In other words: stiff,\n\nstilted, and dry. He follows the script blow-by-blow, which is fine. The story is\n\nthis: one peaceful summer at the National Park (the name is no more specific\n\nthan that) a gigantic bear starts eating people which, of course, causes no end of\n\ntrouble for rugged ranger Mike Kelly. Our first two victims are a couple of college\n\ngirls. Collins uses the common 1970's technique of shifting the point-of-view from\n\nthe victim to the monster, victim to monster. The first girl (Maggie) gets it:\n\n\"But Maggie knew only terror and disbelief. Her blood was pulsing from her torn\n\narm in six-foot jets, her organs had gone into final spasm...\"\n\nSix-foot jets yet! Damn! Poor old Maggie. We knew her well...what? Oh, she's not\n\ndead yet? Let's see:\n\n\"With a single stroke her chest was ripped open to and through the bones. What\n\nhad been desirable breasts, cradled in lace only moments before, now became\n\nraw, bleeding meat.\"\n\nNot too shabby. A bit of flair there. If only Collins had left it alone. Instead, he\n\ncloses the death scene with this:\n\n\"...the last word that choked from her bleeding lips was, \"Mommy!\"\n\nYeah...that's a little cornball. What might have been an effective creature-kill and\n\ndesirable breasts reduced to hamburger becomes, sadly, laughable. But maybe\n\nI'm being too harsh. Let's examine the rest of the plot. After Maggie's death, her\n\nfriend hides in an abandoned cabin where the bear finds her and has her for\n\nlunch. Enter out lantern-jawed hero, Mike Kelly. He has the remains moved to the\n\nhospital where the resident sawbones tells him, yup, a bear killed the girls. Now\n\nthere's trouble. Park Supervisor Kittridge blames Kelly. The bears were supposed\n\nto have been shooed out of the park by Kelly and Arthur Scott, a naturalist and\n\nbear enthusiast who wears bearskins and follows grizzlies around up in the\n\nboonies. I'm sure you see the parallel here with Jaws: Kelly is Chief Brody, Scott\n\nis Hooper, and Kittridge is Mayor Vaughn (the asshole who wanted to keep the\n\nbeach open even when a giant killer shark was biting people in fucking half). All\n\nwe lack here is a good Quint-type. They try with Don Stober, but fail horribly.\n\nStober is a wise-assed helicopter pilot that channels his Native American\n\nforbears...even though he's obviously white as rice. But back to Kittridge. He's an\n\nadmirable prick on all accounts. Like Mayor Vaughn keeping the beach open,\n\nKittridge wants to keep the park open even though Kelly wants it closed. And like\n\nVaughn letting loose the crazy, beer-guzzling fisherman to catch the shark,\n\nKittridge responds in kind by putting a bounty on the killer grizzly and allowing\n\nevery drunken redneck hunter in the state to roam through the wilds of the park.\n\nScott, the naturalist, tells Kelly (and Kittridge) that the beast in question is\n\nfifteen-feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds and it's got a name: Arctodus-Ursus\n\nHorribulus. That's Latin meaning Big-ass Motherfucking Bear. A prehistoric bear\n\nright out of the Pleistocene. A throwback. Kittridge could care less. A buck is a\n\nbuck. More deaths follow. A woman's tent is torn open and she is eaten. A mother\n\nis savaged and her son mutilated. This is a good one and a chance for Collins to\n\npractice his artistry with implausible dialog. Okay, it's not his fault. It's in the\n\nscript, right? When the mother discovers the giant carnivore tearing apart her little\n\nboy and smashing his broken body against a tree, she grabs a fireplace poker\n\nand goes after the bear, saying:\n\n\"Get away, you! Shoo!\"\n\nReally??? Get away? Shoo? Somehow, I expected a more violent, pissed-off\n\nmother-love reaction. But this woman is not the dumbest of the victims. No, that\n\ndistinction goes to one of Kelly's rangers. A hot ranger chick who wants to get it\n\non with her ranger boyfriend. Even though they're trained professionals, what's a\n\nlittle sex in the woods? After all, they're tired (and horny) from tracking the big\n\nfella. So, while her boyfriend scouts downstream, the hot ranger chick strips\n\nnaked and skinny dips in a waterfall. Guess what happens?\n\nAnd I'll leave you hanging right there, my friends.\n\nPros: There few and far between here. Other than Maggie and six-foot jets of\n\nblood, there's not much here to recommend. The ending is pretty cool,\n\nthough...even though, once again, it mimics Jaws.\n\nCons: The writing is dull, dry, and uninspired. Collins was clearly bored and, early\n\non, so are we.\n\nOverall: Avoid this like the clap. If you spot a copy of Grizzly, by all means keep\n\nyour hands in your pockets. Don't put yourself through this. I suffer for my \"art\",\n\nbut there's no reason you should.\n\nOne bloody skull out of five.\n\nOur next guilty pleasure:\n\n\"Courage, treachery, greed...and primal fear unleashed on a city.\""
