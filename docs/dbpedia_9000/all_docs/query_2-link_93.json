        "text": "WARNING—->SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN<—-WARNING\n\nThe sole reason I bought Vinegar Syndrome’s Home Grown Horrors set was for Beyond Dream’s Door (1989), but that didn’t mean I didn’t know of Winterbeast’s existence. I did from a review of the VHS in Fangoria, but had never heard of Fatal Exam (1990), until now. Regardless, Beyond Dream’s Door was what I wanted this set for, so I bit the bullet and slapped down the moolah for it. Incidentally, this wasn’t the most I’ve paid for a single movie I wanted in a set, that award goes to Indicator’s Bloody Terror: The Shocking Cinema of Norman J. Warren set, and that was just to have Inseminoid (1981, aka Horror Planet) on blu. My intention was to only review Beyond Dream’s Door, but looking over the other two films I got curious, and so the decision was made to review the others as well. I was just going to have to keep my fingers crossed and hope the other two were keepers as well. I should point out even though I’ve heard of Winterbeast and Beyond Dream’s Door, I’ve never seen them, so, yes, there’s a chance all three of these flicks could suck. Anyway, with the die cast and my plan set forth, I decided to put them in the order I would review them. I deciding to save the best for last (Beyond Dream’s Door), so which of the other two should I do first and second? Facebook and forum posts indicated Fatal Exam was the worst, so it appeared that one would go first. Deep down I started to hope it didn’t. All I knew of the flick was what was described on the back of the case, and I’ll admit it sounded promising. First half of the movie appeared to be a haunted house film, with the second half turning into a slasher. Translation: it was probably a slasher from the start with the haunting being a fake to lure victims into the madman’s clutches. I’m not an overwhelming fan of slashers, so this didn’t bode well.\n\nAgain, I wanted to be wrong about all this, another reason being the awesome custom artwork done by Thomas “The Dude Designs” Hodge (he did the art for all three movies in this set). It reminded me of some of those young adult horror novels I came across in the local bookstore, and in the school library when I was a kid. Not that I was ever a big fan of those, the artwork sure, but Hodge’s artwork for this one reminded of the two “young adult” horror novels I did read when I was in summer school back in 1984. I found them at the bookstore, sadly I got rid of them at some point, and to this day I cannot remember their titles, or who wrote them, only the cover art, and it kills me I cannot find any hint of them through googling. But you know what, something unexpected happened, I actually ended up liking Jack Snyder’s movie!\n\nI liked the set up a little bit more than the pay off, fisticuffs at the end came off clunky, plus I’ve never seen a person beaten into unconsciousness with the “blunt end” of a scythe, generally when scythes are used in horror flicks it’s the business end that gets the most action, but, okay, I rolled with it, overall none of what I saw was a major letdown. According to IMDB it was filmed in 1985, but due to budget constraints wasn’t finished until 1990, and part of my liking of this film was the period it was filmed in. I was 16 when this was made, and I made a lot of memories in the 80s, mostly due to that decade being part of my formative years. It also reminded me of several movies: Equinox (1970), The House Of The Devil (2009) and The Resurrected (1991). Mostly, it was Equniox that kept coming to mind. Equinox falls into that “home grown horror” category too, both films were shot with cameras that didn’t have the capability to record audio, forcing the filmmakers to loop all the dialogue in post, they both concerned demonic activity, the Devil in Equinox, and a demon seen in the final act that could have been the Devil, and both have stop-motion monster(s) in them. The demon I just mentioned was lit and animated in such a way it could have been taken right out of Equinox. Equinox is one of my favorite bad movies; I reviewed it here on this blog, in case you’re interested in knowing its particulars and why it’s such a memory movie. After seeing Fatal Exam I’m looking at it as a kind of companion piece now.\n\nThe element that reminded me of Ti West’s House Of The Devil was the general plot of someone, or in the case of Fatal Exam a group of someones, being lured to a creepy house for satanic purposes, namely a sacrifice. In the basement of Fatal Exam’s haunted house is a secret hatch to an underground ritual area. This hatch is a hinged, circular, manhole-ish cover (something you might find on a submarine), the exact same type of hinged seal discovered in the basement of the creepy house in The Resurrected, that one didn’t lead to a ritual area though, but a vast underground network of tunnels and rooms.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to learn my assumptions about the plot were all wrong, the haunted house aspect in the first half really is about a house that’s haunted, and the slasher aspect in the second half isn’t about some crazed nutbag hiding out and using the “haunt” as a lure, it’s Satanists with a diabolical plan to resurrect a demon that they think will give them power. Oh, you crazy Satanists, when will you ever learn?\n\nGenerally, I don’t put spoiler warnings on movies this old, but there are mystery elements in Fatal Exam which was another reason it kept me hanging on until the very end, so stop reading right now if you don’t want to know anything more about the story, otherwise I’m going to spoil a shit-ton of things for you. First up, even though the cast list numbers in the double digits (10 to be exact), there are only three main characters: Nick (Mike Coleman), his sister Dana (Carol Fitzgerald Carlberg), and Roger (Terry Comer). I think Roger is Dana’s boyfriend, but I think the relationship is just starting out, which might explain why neither show any outward affection towards one another throughout the film, either that or Dana is aware Roger has the hots for her and just hasn’t decided yet if she wants to commit to a first date.\n\nI’m currently in the process of reviewing Lone Wolf (1988), a werewolf flick about kids in high school where the actors are clearly, and I mean clearly too old to be high-schoolers. The set up to this whole movie revolves around a final exam, and, yes, the actors here are of an age I hoped wasn’t linked to high school, so you can imagine my relief when it’s eventually revealed they are indeed in college. It’s finals week, and Mr. Hughes (Gilio Gheradini) is assembling his parapsychology class to announce a unique final exam he has planned for everyone, everyone who wants to participate that is. He needs at least 6 volunteers, any less and he’ll have to call the project off, but I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nOh, before I continue on, the dude playing Mr. Hughes reminded me of the brother of this girl I dated when I was 21, take away his mustache and he could’ve been another sibling of hers.\n\nOnce Hughes has everyone’s attention he tells them of the Nostrand family who lived way, way out in the countryside in this creepy house. His name was Malcolm (the late Mike Suzor) and he had a wife named Judy and two kids, teen son Tom and pre-teen daughter Sherri. Judy was chronically ill so he had his aunt, who’s a nurse, move in and take care of her. One day Malcolm decides to murder his whole family and dismember their bodies. All except the Aunt. No more is ever revealed about the Aunt. Ever since the house is rumored to be haunted. Time line on the family’s butchering was two years ago. Hughes goes on to enlighten his class about how he got personally involved and that concerned the government contacting the university to see if they could get some people together to do an investigation. Government ended up owning the house for tax purposes, or something like that.\n\nSo, before this movie began there were sinister events already in motion, and I’m not talking about the Nostrand murder. I’m talking something more recent; I’m talking about Hughes’ investigation into the haunting, where he found something that changed his life! Nostrand was in possession of a medallion, and his family was part of a satanic sacrifice that didn’t quite pan out. This medallion will grant power to anyone who conducts the four sacrifices needed to bring this particular demon into our realm. Hughes has sampled some of this power, so has two of his students—Syd (Joe Midyett) and Stacy (Teresa Nienhaus). This will explain Stacy’s suspicious glances now and again, like she knows something the others don’t, and she does too, like how some of them are going to die by their hands.\n\nHughes is offering his students a full weekend (Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon) to stay at the abandoned house and investigate, and all he needs is six sacri– uh, I mean, 6 volunteers. Ten of his students take the bait. Two of them we barely get to know—Kurt (Dave Mayer) and Jill (Karen Greer). We meet them the first day when everyone shows up at the house, but the next morning they’re gone, a note being left saying they drove into town for gas, we’ll eventually find out they were sacrificed (off screen) as part of that first afternoon ritual. Just two more Hughes needs, and that will happen at midnight. The movie starts off with day and dates appearing on screen, so we know how far the investigation got before it went straight to hell. Not literally, almost, but not quite.\n\nThe house they chose was spinster and impressive looking, though not having listened to the commentary or watched the doc yet I don’t know if the outside and the inside were two different locations. We even get to see some of the property as a few life threatening events take place in the woods nearby and on the massive front lawn.\n\nI was rooting for Dave (Paul Steger), Jim (Greg Rhodes) and Sharon (Maureen Lampert). Dave is the tech guy, Jim ends up being traumatized by seeing a ghostly chick’s head in the cabinet in an end table, and Sharon we lose track of for a bit before she shows up near the end. I liked the cast, even Syd and Stacy before they reveal their true nature and kill off Jim and Sharon. Jim takes a ritualistic knife to the gut while Stacy sends Sharon into the great beyond with a razorblade throat-slitting. None of the gore is disturbing, though throat-slittings on any kind of budget gives me the willies.\n\nMost of the movie (about 75-minutes) is centered around the paranormal investigation, before out of the blue two robed Satanists with scythes appear and either kidnap or kill the remaining cast. But before that we do get some actual supernatural events, Jim’s disembodied head encounter notwithstanding. Eerie sounds recorded that leads Dave and the others to that secret hatch in the basement; Dave also records a stop-motion apparition that ends up being the manifestation of the demon Nick, Dana and Roger encounter at the very end and who tries to tempt Nick with the power of the medallion; and the most terrifying, for Nick anyway, a possible residual reenactment of Nostrand chopping up his wife in a bedroom.\n\nFor a brief moment Nick turns into an action hero as he tangles with Syd, a couple of nameless Satanists who keep their faces cloaked, and Hughes as he saves Roger and Dana from getting sacrificed, so we get a happy ending for them, but in a final scene a win for Evil as Stacy got away with the medallion and sent it to someone high up in the political food chain. Oh, that’s definitely not good."
