        "text": "Inseminoid (UK: NEL, 1981)\n\nTagline: \"A far from human birth...\"\n\nSince I haven't taken a look at a good grade-Z novelization\n\nlately, I thought it was time and what better than Inseminoid?\n\nThis was one of those sleazy British horror flicks pumped out\n\nby Norman J. Warren back in the 1970's and '80's, most of\n\nwhich were just excuses for blatant gore that teetered on the\n\nedge of soft-core porn. In the United States this movie was\n\ncalled Horror Planet, which is a nice name, but I have no idea\n\nwhy they changed the title when Inseminoid might just be the\n\nfinest title of a science-fiction horror film ever. Period. There's\n\nno sense in tip-toeing around the fact that this one was a rip-off of Ridley Scott's\n\nAlien and not a particularly good one, but that doesn't mean the movie wasn't fun.\n\nAnything as absolutely ludicrous as Inseminoid just has to be fun in some way, now\n\ndoesn't it? But let's forget for a moment there was such a movie and we'll pretend\n\nthat this novel is just a novel and that the author, Larry Miller, wasn't such an\n\ninsufferably bad hack.\n\nOur story opens on an alien world as a crew of men and women touch down and\n\ninhabit a formerly abandoned compound. Out exploring some caves, there is a rock\n\nslide and they find the sealed tomb of an ugly alien creature and bring it back to the\n\ncompound for examination. Even though they have made an incredible find, most of\n\nthe characters seem preoccupied by thoughts of sex. And it's no wonder. See the\n\nspace service has certain protocol and by-laws. One of these is called\n\nMate-Rotation. An equal number of men and women always fill out any crew and\n\nthey are on a sexual rotation basis, meaning that they switch partners every so often\n\nso everyone gets enough variety. You don't have to have sex with your rotational\n\npartner, but you better not have sex with anyone else's either. Sorry, company rules.\n\nThis is the background of our novel. As one of our characters, Ricky, a sophisticated\n\nintellectual muses to himself:\n\n\"If he'd been asked why he'd become a space archaeologist, sex would have come\n\nfirst on the list, adventure second and scientific motivation a lowly third.\"\n\nAnyway, the alien is in the lab. Its glass-like coffin dissolves for unknown reasons\n\nand releases a foul stench as Dr. Karl examines it. Sandy is his assistant. Sandy is\n\non a sex rotation with Dr. Karl and she's glad of it because Dr. Karl loves blondes\n\nwith big breasts. Ricky, hurt in the rockslide, is in the lab, too. Sandy examines him.\n\nAnd even though she's hot for Dr. Karl and is a dedicated medical professional, she\n\nfinds herself lusting after Ricky's body:\n\n\"Sandy found herself admiring his bulging forearms and solid thighs. Not to mention a\n\ncertain other bulging part of his anatomy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, back to the alien monster. Sandy is certain she saw it move. But neither\n\nDr. Karl or Holly, the compound commander, believes her. Which makes Sandy fly\n\ninto a feminine huff. But she recovers. Ricky, back in his cabin, is overwhelmed by\n\nan alien force. He attacks Dr. Karl but Sandy, ever the quick thinker, karate chops\n\nhim in the balls. He begins to bleed. He rushes out of the compound where he\n\ncannot breathe but somehow does. Gail goes after him, but Ricky tricks her and her\n\nleg is caught in the airlock. As he advances on her and the crew watches in helpless\n\nhorror over the video screen (but for reasons unknown cannot help her), she uses\n\nher laser and burns her foot off. Unfortunately, her thermo unit stopped working and\n\nshe instantly froze to death. But she got the airlock closed. Ricky then runs into Kate\n\nwho wisely burns him with her laser. But it leaves her in a very shaky emotional\n\nstate. It was hard for her to kill Ricky because not only were they friends but they\n\nwere on sexual rotation together. Kate turns to Commander Holly for support. In the\n\nprivacy of Holly's cabin, wearing filmy nighties:\n\n\"Holly moved close to Kate, their legs were pressed against each other. From above,\n\nthe reading lamp shone down through their nightclothes revealing contrasting bodies.\n\nKate was taller, her breasts and hips smaller. Holly was muscular and buxom with\n\nnicely shaped round hips.\"\n\nKate is upset and Holly tells her she has to toughen up, hide her feelings. That's life\n\nin the space service and she better damned well get used to it. But Holly isn't a\n\nmachine and she admits her inner tender feelings:\n\n\"It's impossible to block out all emotion (she said). All human emotion. I know it has\n\nno place on intergalactic missions like this but hell, you spend two, maybe three\n\nmonths fucking a guy. You get to like it and you get to like him. Then it's time to\n\nrotate and you're landed with someone you can't stand and he's balling you're best\n\nfriend.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you understand. I really am. (sez Kate)\"\n\nAnd Holly does understand. She holds Kate. But somehow, their shirts fell open and\n\ntheir breasts touched. So Holly keeps comforting Kate in a hot lesbo action scene.\n\nMeanwhile...what the hell was this book about? Oh, the alien monster. Right. Back\n\nin the lab, both Sandy and Dr. Karl see the creature move. It's alive! Strapped down\n\nto a table, it seems agitated. Like Lassie, it's trying to tell them something. Sandy,\n\nher scientific and analytical mind quickly ascertaining the problem, says:\n\n\"Maybe it wants some breakfast.\"\n\nEureka! The alien monster, poor little thing, is hungry. They give it some breakfast\n\nsausage, then raw steaks, eggs, loaves of bread, and finally a frozen chicken. Mr.\n\nAlien Monster perks right up. Even though the monster is active, Dr. Karl decides to\n\ngo take a nap in his cabin and leaves Sandy to clean up the mess in the lab. Sandy,\n\never the obedient large-breasted research scientist, is more than happy with this\n\ntask. Cleaning up, she accidentally spills a chemical on her lab coat so she does the\n\nonly reasonable thing and strips down to her bra and panties, parading her junk in\n\nfront of the monster who begins to get excited. Since the monster is strapped down\n\nand quite harmless as such, Sandy decides to augment her research by bending\n\nover the creature and putting her love-melons pretty much right in the beast's face.\n\nAnd as she does so, she inspects its weird alien penis:\n\n\"A pair of foot-long rods joined at the crotch were covered with a slick foreskin that\n\ncontinually rolled forward and back.\"\n\nSandy knows she is imagining things, but it seems as if the creature is becoming\n\nsexually aroused:\n\n\"Its head was only inches from her large breasts. It had once again become agitated,\n\nstraining at the straps...\"\n\nEnough scientific pursuits for one day, Sandy turns off the lights and prepares to\n\nleave the lab and as she does so, the alien monster breaks free! It jumps on her! It\n\nholds her down! It forces her legs apart with its lobster claw hands and:\n\n\"With unrestrained fervour the creature inserted one of its sexual organs into her\n\nwomanhood, pushing the long thin member deeper and deeper, ejaculating into her.\n\nThen the second organ penetrated and ejaculated in the same way.\n\nThe creature rose from her body, a body now covered in greasy yellow saliva. The\n\nfluid was on Sandy's face, her breasts and it ran down her thighs.\"\n\nSuch is the fate of Sandy. All she wanted to do was clean up the lab and continue\n\nwith her scientific work and look what happened. There are those who might say she\n\nwas asking for it, that she was a tease, but I'm not one of them. Anyway, by this\n\npoint we're not even half way through the novel. Basically what happens next is that\n\nSandy goes a little alien and gives birth to a set of nasty twins (two penises, two\n\nchildren, right?). Awful things happen. So awful that the crew members must\n\n\"comfort\" each other a great deal.\n\nNow, of course, we all know the plot to Ridley Scott's classic Alien: the mining ship\n\nNostromo visits a bleak, spooky planetoid and discovers the remains of a weird\n\nbiomechanical alien culture. They find eggs and this thing jumps out of one of the\n\neggs and grafts itself to one of the astronaut's faces. This being the ultra-cool\n\nFacehugger which falls off and the Chestburster larva bursts free, gets into the\n\nventilation system, and becomes our predatory monster. But what if you wanted to\n\nrip Alien off and cash-in on it and you didn't want to spend a lot of money? What if\n\nyou wanted to replace the grim forbidding atmosphere with, say, lots of T & A? Then\n\nyou would, like Norman J. Warren, make Inseminoid. You'd get some actresses who\n\ndidn't mind taking it off, borrow a set from a 1950's B-movie, swipe some costumes\n\nfrom Rocky Jones, Space Ranger, and present the world with a touching story of\n\nmotherhood about a woman who is raped by an alien monster and gives birth to a\n\ncollection of crawly alien spawn. That woman would be Sandy, of course, she of the\n\nblonde hair and large firm breasts...Larry Miller likes to remind us continually of\n\nSandy's joyous globes of delight. If you read this book, long will you remember them.\n\nPros: Gimme a minute...there's gotta be something. Oh, the title is pretty cool.\n\nCons: Is this a bad book? Dear God, it's atrocious. Larry Miller is a terrible writer. The\n\nplot makes no sense. The characters behave irrationally. The alien is your typical\n\nrubber monster with a zipper up the back...save its menacing extraterrestrial penis,\n\nthat is. The movie is crap, the book is crap.\n\nOverall: By this point you're probably assuming that I'm not recommending this one.\n\nAnd I'm not...unless you need a good laugh. Because this book is hilarious! Buy it.\n\nRead it. Revel in the sheer badness of it. It may be one of the funniest things you'll\n\never read (and don't forget about Sandy's breasts, because Larry Miller never did...I\n\nthink he was typing with one hand).\n\nTwo Bloody Skulls out of Five for sheer gross ineptitude.\n\nOur next Guilty Pleasure:\n\n\"A winged terror which flies by night--feeding on death and destruction.\""
