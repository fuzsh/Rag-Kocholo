        "text": "Naturally brunette/blue-eyed beauty Amy Davis Irving was born in Palo Alto, California. She is the youngest of three children, and the daughter of influential theatrical/television director and producer Jules Irving, and actress Priscilla Pointer. Her father was of Russian Jewish descent, and her mother's ancestry includes English, Scots-Irish, Welsh, Jewish, and German.\n\nAmy was brought up in the world of theater. She was put on stage from the time she was nine-months-old, her father was the director and her mother was the actress, they didn't want baby sitters for their children, so if she wasn't performing, she would stay in the wardrobe department or her mother used to put her in the second row center where she could watch her. And, before she was 10-years-old, she had already worked in several plays. At a young age, Amy Irving was trained at the American Conservatory Theater and Britain's London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts (L.A.M.A.D.A.). She made her off-Broadway debut at the age of 17 and, from that moment to date, she received critical acclaim, appearing in such plays as: \"Heartbreak House\" (1983), \"The Road to Mecca\" (1988), \"Broken Glass\" (1994), \"The Three Sisters\" (1997), \"The Guys\" (2002), \"Ghosts\" (2002) and \"Celadine\" (2004), among others.\n\nIn 1976, Amy made her film debut, playing \"Sue Snell\", one of her most unforgettable characters in Stephen King's Carrie: Des Satans jüngste Tochter (1976), a classic in the horror genre, taken to the big screen by director Brian De Palma. For the next few years, Irving continued working in important films, Teufelskreis Alpha (1978), also directed by De Palma, Eine Welt ohne Ton (1979) and Das große Finale (1980).
