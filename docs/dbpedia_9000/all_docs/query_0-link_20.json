Moving as a young child to the US, Cartwright appeared for seven seasons in the TV series Make Room For Daddy. During her tenure there, she had a wonderful on- and off-screen relationships with Danny Thomas and Marjorie Lord. She was reunited with both Thomas and Lord for the 1970 remake, Make Room For Granddaddy. After the series was cancelled Cartwright remained on good terms with Thomas until his death on February 6, 1991.\n\nHer trembling vocal delivery was put to good use when she played the excitable young Penny Robinson in the hit TV series Lost in Space (1965-1968).

Soon after her first marriage to Gene Dickinson she decided to pursue a career in acting. She studied the craft and a few years later was approached by NBC to guest-star on a number of variety shows, including The Colgate Comedy Hour. She soon met Frank Sinatra who became a lifelong friend. She would later play Sinatra’s wife in the film Ocean’s Eleven.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve 1954, Dickinson made her acting debut in an episode of Death Valley Days. This led to other roles in such productions as Buffalo Bill Jr, eight episodes of Matinee Theatre, City Detective, Gray Ghost, General Electric Theater, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Broken Arrow, Meet McGraw (twice), Northwest Passage, Gunsmoke, The Virginian, Tombstone Territory, Cheyenne, Meet McGraw, The Restless Gun, Perry Mason, Mike Hammer, Wagon Train, Men Into Space, and a memorable turn as the duplicitous murder conspirator in a 1964 episode of the classic The Fugitive series with David Janssen and fellow guest star Robert Duvall. In 1965, she had a recurring role as Carol Tredman on Dr. Kildare.\n\n[edit] Film career\n\nDickinson’s film career began with small roles in Lucky Me (1954) with Doris Day, The Return of Jack Slade (1955), Man with the Gun (1955) and Hidden Guns (1956). She had her first starring role in Gun the Man Down (1956) with James Arness, followed by the Sam Fuller cult film China Gate (1957), which depicted an early view of the internal conflicts in Vietnam.\n\nCasting directors began noticing her enigmatic charisma and her ironic, albeit seductive, delivery – at once femininely fluttery, yet undeniably edgy. She was armed with a fine physique, great legs, deepset brown eyes which could read as either warmly receptive or aloofly dismissive, and a striking, classical face which photographed as oval from the front but angular in profile.\n\nIn 1959, Dickinson appeared in Howard Hawks’ Rio Bravo, in which she played a flirtatious gambler called “Feathers” who becomes attracted to the town sheriff played by Dickinson’s childhood idol John Wayne. The film co-starred Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and Walter Brennan. When Hawks sold his personal contract with her to a major studio without her knowledge, she was unhappy. Dickinson nonetheless became one of the more prominent leading ladies of the next decade, beginning with The Bramble Bush with Richard Burton and Ocean’s Eleven with friends Sinatra and Martin, two films released in 1960.\n\nThese were followed by the political potboiler A Fever in the Blood (1961); a Belgian Congo-based melodrama The Sins of Rachel Cade (1962), in which she played a missionary nurse tempted by lust; and the European travelogue Rome Adventure (also known as Lovers Must Learn) in 1962; and Jean Negulesco’s Jessica (1962) with Maurice Chevalier, in which she plays a young midwife who is resented by the married women of the town. Angie would also share the screen with friend Gregory Peck in the comedy-drama Captain Newman, M.D.\n\nIn The Killers, a film originally intended to be the very first made-for-TV movie but released to theatres due to its violent content, Dickinson reached the apex of her skills as a femme fatale. She is slapped by a villainous boyfriend, played by future U.S. President Ronald Reagan in his last movie role. This movie was directed by Don Siegel. It was a remake of the 1946 version based on a story by Ernest Hemingway.\n\nDickinson co-starred in the comedy The Art of Love (1965), in which she plays the love interest of both James Garner and Dick Van Dyke. She appeared in a star-studded Arthur Penn/Sam Spiegel production, The Chase (1966) along with Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, Robert Duvall and others.\n\nDickinson’s best movie of this era was arguably John Boorman’s cult classic Point Blank (1967), a lurid crime drama with Lee Marvin as a criminal betrayed by his wife and best friend and out for revenge. Epitomizing the stark urban mood of the period, the film’s reputation has grown through the years.\n\nWesterns would continue to be a part of her work in 1969, when she starred in Young Billy Young with Robert Mitchum, and in Sam Whiskey, where she gave a young Burt Reynolds his first on-screen kiss.\n\nIn 1971, she played a lascivious high school teacher in the dark comedy Pretty Maids All in a Row with Rock Hudson. One of Dickinson’s best-known and most sexually provocative movie roles became the tawdry widow Wilma McClatchie from the Great Depression romp Big Bad Mama (1974) with William Shatner and Tom Skerritt. Although well into her forties at the time, she appeared nude in several scenes, creating interest in the movie and a new generation of male fans for Dickinson.\n\nDickinson returned to the small screen in March 1974 to play lead in an episode of the critically-acclaimed hit anthology series Police Story. That one guest appearance proved to be so popular that NBC offered Dickinson her own television show which became a ground-breaking weekly police series called Police Woman; it would be the first successful hour-long dramatic tv series to feature a woman in the title role. At first, Dickinson was reluctant to accept the role, but agreed to do the tv show when she decided she wanted to be a household name.\n\nIn the series, she played Sgt. Leanne “Pepper” Anderson, an officer of the Los Angeles Police Department’s Criminal Conspiracy Unit. The show became a significant hit, even reaching Number One in many countries in which it aired during its first year. It would run for four seasons and Dickinson would win a Golden Globe award, and receive Emmy nominations for three consecutive years.\n\nCo-starring on the show was Earl Holliman as Sergeant Bill Crowley, Andersen’s commanding officer, along with Charles Dierkop as investigator Pete Royster and Ed Bernard as investigator Joe Styles.\n\nThe success of Dickinson’s Police Woman television show resulted in a number of female-starring series like Charlie’s Angels, Wonder Woman, The Bionic Woman, and Cagney and Lacey during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1987, the Los Angeles Police Department awarded Dickinson an honorary doctorate, which led her to quip, “Now you can call me Doctor Pepper.”\n\nAfter appearing in the TV mini-series Pearl (1978), Dickinson returned to the big screen in Brian De Palma’s thriller Dressed to Kill (1980). The role earned her a 1981 Saturn Award for Best Actress. The film featured Dickinson in a 35-minute sequence, dialogue free, being stalked through the maze of a New York museum and ending shockingly with her character’s brutal murder.\n\nEarlier that year, she had been the first choice to play the character Krystle Carrington on the television series Dynasty but she turned it down; the role instead went to Linda Evans.\n\nAfter nixing her own Johnny Carson-produced prospective sitcom, The Angie Dickinson Show, in 1980 after only two episodes had been shot because she didn’t feel she was funny enough, the private-eye series Cassie & Co. became her unsuccessful attempt at a TV comeback. She then starred in several TV movies such as, One Shoe Makes it Murder (1982), Jealousy (1984), A Touch of Scandal (1984), and Stillwatch (1987). She also had a pivotal role in the highly rated mini-series Hollywood Wives (1985), based on a novel by Jackie Collins.\n\nIn 1995, Sydney Pollack cast her as the prospective mother-in-law of Greg Kinnear in the romantic comedy Sabrina starring Harrison Ford, a remake of the Billy Wilder classic. She also played Burt Reynolds’ wife in the thriller The Maddening and the mother of Rick Aiello and Robert Cicchini in the National Lampoon comedy The Don’s Analyst. In 1997, she also seduced old flame Artie (Rip Torn) in an episode of HBO’s The Larry Sanders Show called “Artie and Angie and Hank and Hercules.”\n\nDuring the first decade of the new millennium, Dickinson played an alcoholic, homeless mother to Helen Hunt in Pay it Forward (2000); the grandmother of Gwyneth Paltrow in the drama Duets (2000) and the mother of Arliss Howard in Big Bad Love (2001), co-starring Debra Winger.\n\nHaving appeared in the original Ocean’s Eleven (1960) with good friends Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, four decades later she made a brief cameo in the 2001 remake with George Clooney and Brad Pitt.\n\nAn avid poker player, during the summer of 2004 she participated in the second season of Bravo’s Celebrity Poker Showdown. After announcing her name, host Dave Foley said “Sometimes, when we say ‘celebrity,’ we actually mean it.”\n\nDickinson is a recipient of the state of North Dakota’s Roughrider Award.\n\nIn 1999, Playboy ranked Dickinson #42 on their list of the ‘100 Sexiest Stars of the Century’. And in 2002, TV Guide ranked her #3 on their list of the ’50 Sexiest TV Stars of All Time’, behind Diana Rigg and George Clooney (who tied for #1).\n\nIn July 2009, Dickinson starred in a Hallmark Channel film, Mending Fences.\n\nNominations in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress – Drama Series :\n\n* 1975 – Police Woman\n\n* 1976 – Police Woman\n\n* 1977 – Police Woman\n\nGolden Globe Award wins Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Drama Series :\n\n* 1975 – Police Woman\n\nNominations in the category of Best TV Actress – Drama :\n\n* 1976 – Police Woman\n\n* 1977 – Police Woman\n\n* 1978 – Police Woman\n\nAnn Morgan Guilbert\n\n1st Ever appearance SAT ONLY (born October 16, 1928), sometimes credited as Ann Guilbert, is an American actress who played hyperactive neighbor Millie Helper in 61 episodes of the early 1960s sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show, and later Yetta Rosenberg, Fran Fineâ™s doddering g… (born October 16, 1928), sometimes credited as Ann Guilbert, is an American actress who played hyperactive neighbor Millie Helper in 61 episodes of the early 1960s sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show, and later Yetta Rosenberg, Fran FineÃ¢ÂÂ™s doddering grandmother, in 56 episodes of the 1990s sitcom The Nanny.

Having known for a number of years that she wanted to act, she pursued roles in both film and television as well as Broadway theater. The role that initially brought her note was Evelyn Gardner, the Rockford Peaches’ right fielder, in the Penny Marshall directed film A League of Their Own. Schram’s character was the focus of the now famous line uttered by manager Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), “There’s no crying in baseball!”\n\nDuring 1993-95, she had a role in the original Broadway production of Neil Simon’s Laughter on the 23rd Floor.\n\nIn 2002, Schram landed a major role opposite Tony Shalhoub on the USA mystery series Monk. USA Network released her mid-way through the show’s third season, stating they “decided to go in a different creative direction with some of its characters”; MSNBC reported that “some members of the series’ supporting cast, including Schram, Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford, attempted to renegotiate the terms of their contract” and cited Schram’s departure as evidence of the industry’s “hard line against raise-seeking actors who aren’t absolutely essential to the show.” Levine and Gray-Stanford remained on the show. Natalie Teeger, played by Traylor Howard, replaced her character as Monk’s assistant. Schram returned to Monk for an episode during the show’s eighth and final season entitled “Mr. Monk and Sharona\n\n• Photos\n\n• Filmography\n\nBo Hopkins\n\nNEW is an American actor.

He is probably best known for playing Dr. Jesse Travis over five seasons of Dick Van Dyke series Diagnosis: Murder and for starring in big screen comedy 18 Again!, opposite George Burns. Since the early 1990s, Schlatter has been primarily a voice actor.\n\nSchlatter was spotted by a casting director during a performance in 1988, and asked to audition for the Michael J. Fox drama Bright Lights, Big City. This led to his first film appearance, as the younger brother of Fox’s character.\n\nCharlie starred in 1988’s Heartbreak Hotel (directed by Chris Columbus) where his character kidnaps Elvis Presley in an effort to make his mother (Tuesday Weld) happy. His most highly acclaimed role in an American film was in 1988 comedy 18 Again!. His 18-year-old character swaps body and mind with his 81-year-old grandfather, played by George Burns. His work in this film was described as “displaying enormous range and extraordinary skill as an actor in his comedic starring role”.\n\nSchlatter also starred in Australian romance The Delinquents (1989) opposite Kylie Minogue. In 1990, he was cast in the role of Ferris Bueller for NBC’s sitcom Ferris Bueller, based on the John Hughes film Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. In 1992, he co-starred in Sunset Heat with Michael Paré, Dennis Hopper and Adam Ant. In 1994, he appeared in Police Academy: Mission to Moscow as Cadet Kyle Connors.\n\nIn 1996, Schlatter began his role as Dr. Travis on the television series Diagnosis: Murder. His character was introduced as a comic relief character in the third season after Scott Baio’s character moved to Colorado, and never returned. Schlatter remained with the show for the next five seasons, until the series was finally cancelled in 2001. During the series, he began writing episodes, such as “A Resting Place”.\n\nSchlatter was initially cast as Philip J. Fry, one of the main characters in animated series Futurama, which premiered in 1999.Due to a casting change, Billy West landed the role after auditioning for the part again.

In the great perky tradition of fellow blondes Sandra Dee, Linda Evans, Yvette Mimieux, and the late Sharon Tate, stunning Chris Noel did what she did best: distract male viewers from some of the silliness around her. However, she has been less remembered than the aforementioned lovelies, all of whom went on to bigger and better things in their careers. Chris took an entirely different route, altogether. She was born near the water in 1941, albeit a different beach locale–West Palm Beach, Florida, to be exact. She took the standard route–cheerleader, model, beauty pageant winner–that most gorgeous girls take when trying to crash Hollywood. The incredibly photogenic teen seemed tailor-made for the camera and, sure enough, by 1963, she was appearing in her first film, Soldier in the Rain (1963), starring Steve McQueen. After a few other minor efforts, Chris received her first “Annette Funicello”-like star billing in Beach Ball (1965), opposite Edd Byrnes, in the Frankie Avalon role. But, it was the specialty performers–The Supremes, The Four Seasons and The Righteous Brothers–who were noticed in that flick, not the actors. Wild Wild Winter (1966) provided Chris a second chance as a lead and she also booked a secondary femme part in Elvis Presley’s Girl Happy (1965), but nothing much came out of them, either. Though Chris made appearances in such TV series as Perry Mason (1957), Bewitched (1964) and a few Bob Hope specials, she was not satisfied with her career…or her life.\n\nA tour of a VA hospital in 1965 altered her destiny, forever. Based on her minor pin-up celebrity, Chris impulsively auditioned for the Armed Forces Network (AFN) and started hosting her own radio show for the GIs in Vietnam, frequently flying to that war-torn country and visiting remote areas considered too risky for Bob Hope’s USO shows. She became the GIs’ favorite sexy radio and show personality while putting her own life on the line. As it turned out, Vietnam veterans would become her prime mission and life’s work long after the war. In the 1970s, Chris began to suffer from postwar trauma. Any attempt to resurrect her Hollywood career in the 1970s and 1980s would be short-lived due to her stress, ill health and depression. Moreover, her first husband, a Green Beret captain (they married in Vietnam) suffering from the same postwar syndrome as Chris, killed himself during the Christmas holiday season of 1969. Chris’ two subsequent marriages also ended in divorce. Persevering, she ventured into the operation of shelters for veterans in Florida during the 1990s, becoming a durable symbol for those who fought the unpopular fight.

Later in the decade, Leachman appeared as Ruth Martin, Timmy’s adoptive mom, in the last half of season four (1957) of Lassie.

True Hollywood Story episode featuring Dynasty, former ABC executive Ted Harbert stated, “The truth is we didn’t really believe that we had this thing done as a hit until Joan Collins walked down that courtroom aisle.” Co-star Al Corley noted that Collins “just flew” in the role that was “tailor made…just spot on.” In Dynasty producer Aaron Spelling’s final press interview, he said of Collins: “We didn’t write Joan Collins. She played Joan Collins. Am I right? We wrote a character, but the character could have been played by 50 people and 49 of them would have failed. She made it work.”\n\nLater career\n\nThis section of a biographical article needs additional citations for verification. Please help by adding reliable sources.

He has been cited… an American singer, songwriter, bandleader, and music producer and the principal architect of P-Funk. He was the mastermind of the bands Parliament and Funkadelic during the 1970s and early 1980s, and launched a solo career in 1981. He has been cited as one of the foremost innovators of funk music, along with James Brown and Sly Stone. Clinton was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic.\n\nFor a period in the 1960s Clinton was a staff songwriter for Motown. Despite initial commercial failure (and one major hit single, “(I Wanna) Testify” in 1967, as well as arranging and producing scores of singles on many of the independent Detroit soul music labels), The Parliaments eventually found success under the names Parliament and Funkadelic in the 1970s (see also P-Funk). These two bands combined the elements of musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Cream, and James Brown while exploring various sounds, technology, and lyricism. Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic dominated diverse music during the 1970s with over 40 R&B hit singles (including three number ones) and three platinum albums.\n\nClinton’s efforts as a solo artist began in 1982. He is also a notable music producer who works on almost all the albums he performs on, and has produced albums for Bootsy Collins and Red Hot Chili Peppers, among others. Beginning in the early 1980s, Clinton recorded several nominal solo albums, although all of these records featured contributions from P-Funk’s core musicians. The primary reason for recording under his own name was legal difficulties, due to the complex copyright and trademark issues surrounding the name “Parliament” (primarily) and Polygram’s purchase of that group’s former label Casablanca Records.\n\nIn 1982, Clinton signed to Capitol Records under two names: his own (as a solo artist) and as the P-Funk All-Stars, releasing Computer Games under his own name that same year. The single “Loopzilla” hit the Top 20 on the R&B charts, followed by “Atomic Dog”, which reached #1 R&B and #101 on the pop chart. In the next four years, Clinton released three more studio albums (You Shouldn’t-Nuf Bit Fish, Some of My Best Jokes Are Friends, and R&B Skeletons in the Closet) as well as a live album, Mothership Connection (Live from the Summit, Houston, Texas) and charting three singles in the R&B Top 30, “Nubian Nut”, “Last Dance”, and “Do Fries Go with That Shake?”. This period of Clinton’s career was marred by multiple legal problems (resulting in financial difficulties) due to complex royalty and copyright issues, notably with Bridgeport Music, who Clinton claims fraudulently obtained the copyrights to many of his recordings.\n\nIn 1985, he was recruited by the Red Hot Chili Peppers to produce their album Freaky Styley, because the band members were huge fans of George Clinton’s and of funk in general. Clinton, in fact, wrote the vocals and lyrics to the title track which was originally intended by the band to be left as an instrumental piece. The album was not a commercial success at the time, but has since sold 500,000 copies after the Red Hot Chili Peppers became popular years later.\n\nThough Clinton’s popularity had waned by the mid-1980s, he experienced something of a resurgence in the early 1990s, as many rappers cited him as an influence and began sampling his songs. Alongside James Brown, George Clinton is considered to be one of the most sampled musicians ever. “Sure, sample my stuff…” he remarked in 1996. “Ain’t a better time to get paid than when you’re my age. You know what to do with money. You don’t buy as much pussy or drugs with it – you just buy some.”\n\nIn 1989, Clinton released The Cinderella Theory on Paisley Park, Prince’s record label. This was followed by Hey Man, Smell My Finger in 1993. Clinton then signed with Sony 550 and released T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M. (The Awesome Power of a Fully Operational Mothership) in 1996, having reunited with several former members of Parliament and Funkadelic\n\n1994 saw Clinton contribute to several tracks on Primal Scream’s studio album Give Out But Don’t Give Up. In 1995, Clinton sang “Mind Games” on the John Lennon tribute Working Class Hero. In the 1990s, Clinton appeared in films such as Graffiti Bridge (1990), House Party (1990), PCU (1994), Good Burger (1997), and The Breaks (1999). In 1997, he appeared as himself in the Cartoon Network show Space Ghost Coast to Coast. Clinton also appeared as the voice of The Funktipus, the DJ of the Funk radio station Bounce FM in the 2004 video game, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, in which his song “Loopzilla” also appeared.\n\nRapper Dr. Dre sampled most of Clinton’s beats to create his G-Funk music era. In 1999, Clinton collaborated with Lil’ Kim, Fred Durst, and Mix Master Mike for Methods of Mayhem’s single “Get Naked”.\n\nDisplaying his influence on rap and hip hop, Clinton also worked with Tupac Shakur on the song “Can’t C Me” from the album All Eyez on Me; Ice Cube on the song and video for “Bop Gun (One Nation)” on the Lethal Injection album (which sampled Funkadelic’s earlier hit “One Nation Under A Groove”); Outkast on the song “Synthesizer” from the album Aquemini; Redman on the song “J.U.M.P.” from the album Malpractice; Souls of Mischief on “Mama Knows Best” from the album Trilogy: Conflict, Climax, Resolution; Killah Priest on “Come With me” from the album Priesthood, and the Wu Tang Clan on “Wolves” from the album 8 Diagrams.\n\nClinton founded a record label called The C Kunspyruhzy in 2003. He had a cameo appearance in “Where Were We?”, the season two premiere of the CBS television sitcom How I Met Your Mother, on September 18, 2006.\n\nClinton wrote “You’re Thinking Right”, the theme song for The Tracey Ullman Show.
