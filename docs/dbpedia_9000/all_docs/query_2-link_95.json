        "text": "I have significant work and family commitments, so not sure how many we're going to get through. Now that we have a teen, we'll be watching one horror film a weekend with them, starting tonight, and I'll try to catch a few more as/when I can.\n\n1. Paranormal Activity (2007, rewatch). I saw this opening weekend at the theater, but not since. It really freaked me out at the time, and I was still quite stressed out by it on this rewatch. It's really impressive how effective it is considering the minimal budget and effects. Some of the poor audio capture and blurry image quality really captures the found-footage-ness of the production in ways that many other films of this sub-subgenre choose to clean up. A lot of credit to the writing and acting, both of which are naturalistic and are never show-y.\n\nSomething I didn't quite catch the first time (or perhaps I didn't have the language for?) was the fact that--oh boy--Micah is just a toxic male chud. 'My house, my girl, my rules.' He sucks, basically, and deserves whatever may or may not happen to him.\n\nBy the by, I have also seen 0 of the sequels. Are any of them worth checking out?\n\n2 and 3 are good. I forget 4, for the most part. Ghost Dimension is probably the worst. Marked Ones is pretty good. The one from last year wasn't bad.\n\nI'm going to be on vacation for half of October (seasonally fitting though a very American Werewolf in London style vacation of hiking across the Moors and then going to London) so I'm sadly not going to participate this year, but I'll wing it and watch a random assortment when I get back. Always fun looking at other people's lists though.\n\nRise, Divius, RIIISEEE!!\n\nI'm back, the only thread I return to this board for. Still working on my list. Good to see a bunch of familiar faces. Also good to see some lists already, inspiration ahoy!\n\nFind my list here (work in progress as of yet)\n\n31 Days of Horror 2022\n\nIt's the most spooky time of the year! My 12th go at the 31 Days of Horror challenge, where the idea is to watch a horror movie every day in October. These are all movies I have not seen before.\n\nMasterlist:\n\n31 Days of Horror Masterlist\n\nA piled up list of (mostly) lesser known horror movies from old bookmarks, infinite backlog, and twisted recommendations, that'll form the base of my 31 Days of Horror selection.. I'm just adding stuff as it crosses my path and will sift through it all later on, as I select 31 of these for October.\n\nMy previous years: 2011 / 2012 / 2013 / 2014 / 2015 / 2016 / 2017 / 2018 / 2019 / 2020 / 2021\n\nHere are some of my favorites from your master list if you're looking for help narrowing it down:\n\n-Corman's House of Usher and/or The Haunted Palace\n\n- The Fifth Cord\n\n- Let's Scare Jessica to Death\n\n-Asylum\n\n-The Shout\n\n-Witchfinder General\n\n-Deathdream\n\n-Psycho II\n\nAnd here are a few of my favorite discoveries from my prior marathons for you or anyone else:\n\n- Quatermass and the Pit\n\n- The House that Screamed\n\n- Bunny Lake is Missing\n\n- Stage Fright Aquarius\n\n- The Fall of the House of Usher (1928 dir.

Always fun looking at other people's lists though.\n\nHere are some of my favorites from your master list if you're looking for help narrowing it down:\n\n-Corman's House of Usher and/or The Haunted Palace\n\n- The Fifth Cord\n\n- Let's Scare Jessica to Death\n\n-Asylum\n\n-The Shout\n\n-Witchfinder General\n\n-Deathdream\n\n-Psycho II\n\nAnd here are a few of my favorite discoveries from my prior marathons for you or anyone else:\n\n- Quatermass and the Pit\n\n- The House that Screamed\n\n- Bunny Lake is Missing\n\n- Stage Fright Aquarius\n\n- The Fall of the House of Usher (1928 dir. Jean Epstein)\n\n- The Vampire Doll\n\n- The Seventh Curse\n\nBeware of the moon, laddie.\n\nI'll second The House that Screamed. If I remember right, some ass recommended it to me, but it turned out pretty good.\n\nfinally watched The Empty Man, I gotta say, I was pretty disappointed after the crazy ass word of mouth it got the last few years after the initial awful reception it got at launch, I guess for me it's somewhere in the middle? It's nowhere enar as bad as the initial receeption it got, but it's also nowhere near as good or CULT CLASSIC as it was hailed as recently.\n\nIt's alright and the explanation is cool if you don't think about it too much, but it's WAY too long and like I said, if you think too much about it it sorta-kinda just falls apart all over.\n\nwhat I DO like however, and I'm fully aware I'm a small minority with this, is Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. I love the white-trashy-ness of the first half, there are some really striking scenes like the asylum scene after Mikey kills a nurse and chaos erupts with him his mom and guards but all you hear is the alarm going off in the background. The second half is basically just a straight up copy of the OG, but Tylar Mane is a GIANT OF A MAN so I love how huge Michael is, the kills are nice and brutal, and I like the actress that plays Laurie. In fact I like the whole cast. What can I say, I really like this remake\n\nMy slasher-ish September marathon continues...\n\nScream (1996, Wes Craven) ★★★★\n\nScream 2 (1997, Wes Craven) ★★★\n\nScream 3 (2000, Wes Craven) ★★½\n\nScream 4 (2011, Wes Craven) ★★★\n\nI had only seen the first 2 when they released. The whole \"Stab\" meta-layer is probably what made me lose interest in the franchise to begin with and I'm still not a fan. 2 should've been better since there's some solid parts, but it's dragged down by dumb shit like the singing and Sidney crawling over the unconscious killer and not killing him/taking his mask off....only to then change her mind and get her friend killed because these movies insist on being 2 hours long. The plot in 3 is awful. The live-streaming murder stuff in 4 hits a little different nowadays and I guess it's cool that one of the only interesting side-characters is coming back in 6. The sequels are all varying degrees of fine/unnecessary.\n\nScream (2022, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett) ★★½\n\nThe same can be said for 5. It's dumb and unnecessary, but it was mostly fine. The premise at the beginning of dude asking slasher trivia and killing people who liked Hereditary is hilarious....and then they don't really do anything with that. Whatever point they were trying to make could've used a few more passes in the writing room (or a time machine to a few years ago). \"It was the message boards! I was radicalized!\" and \"I still prefer The Babadook.\" competing for dumbest lines ever written. Felt like they were hesitant to actually comment on what's popular in horror now and were grasping at straws.\n\nNightmares in a Damaged Brain (1981, Romano Scavolini) ★★★½\n\nReminded me of Maniac but closer in tone to something like The Witch Who Came From the Sea. Even some of the dumber* or boring parts help punctuate the sudden bursts of screaming or violence. Lived up to its sleazy video nasty reputation. *Those scenes with the computers...\n\nThe Centerfold Girls (1974, John Peyser) ★★★\n\nDidn't really like the structure of the movie (it's divided into 3 chapters with Andrew Prine stalking/killing different models). Not enough Prine and the first 2 segments are a bit boring. The ending is great though.\n\nFreaky (2020, Christopher Landon) ★★★½\n\nFun movie. Elevated by being rated R and having some decent kills. Better Scream sequel than any of the actual Scream sequels.\n\nThe Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976, Charles B. Pierce) ★★★\n\nPut it off because I heard it was slow and uneven tonally....and it is.\n\nUltimately, I can't resist the siren's song, though the situation does mean I have to treat this a fair bit differently than I normally do as I'm playing this entirely by ear, which is the first time since 2010 where there isn't a major game plan in place, while also minding the literal gap that's about to occur in just over a week as I go out of town for eight days. I shall dub it...\n\nRidley's Informal Halloween Horror Movie Marathon 2022: This Might Get Weird!\n\nFilm 1:\n\nFor a marathon that doesn't really have a plan and has to account for an eight-day blackout period (possibly maybe), it's fitting to start with something just as unconventional an approach as we get here. Mixing together coming-of-age drama and horror is hardly a new idea in of itself, and I've certainly seen more than my share of such films during the proper marathons, but offering the context of it happening as the result of a kind of creepy-pasta online horror game certainly makes for a more unique setup. Where it really shines, however, is the lengths it goes to create a palpable sense of immersion into the topic, wasting little time on establishing just what all involves the \"making it up as we go along\" mythology powering its workings beyond the ritual one performs to make their participation in the game official and letting the videos of other participants shade a little outside the lines, in which Casey begins to draw her own picture.\n\nIn a very impressive debut role, Anna Cobb uses her expressive face to simultaneously render Casey in a way where she can't help but put out her feelings for everyone to see, while also creating a terrific psychological barrier that makes for a lot of real tension as the more we want to see what really makes her tick, the more likely it is that we might uncover something we truly do not wish to witness. Though hardly the stuff of art horror provocation, the film is nevertheless highly resistant to easy classification, opting to let the tapestry of the subject matter sew itself into a pattern that lets the mood dictate the chills, rather than offering up traditional scares or easy emotional content for a more contemplative and decidedly sadder kind of experience. And certainly, the turn the film takes when Casey's video attracts the attention of a mysterious viewer further pushes the film into a category all of its own, whose intentions remain murky at best beyond his interest in the overall experience of the game as a kind of observer, while letting the very taboo dynamic that enters the picture cast a very uncomfortable shadow on what's to come, even as it remains doggedly non-explicit on every front.\n\nThe film builds and builds, only to let the air out itself as the eventual confrontation does not go as expected for anyone and creates a rare intentional anticlimax for both of our characters and the viewer themselves to grapple with, as the thin line between the world that the characters are building for themselves soon gives way to an almost oppressive disappointment as the cues are missed and the self-awareness of being confronted with the impact one has on the other resolves in an unexpected way when the real world must insist upon itself. There's little doubt that the very courageous rug pull that happens here will rub folks the wrong way as it leaves no doubt to the kind of horror we've been dealing with all along, though it should come as little surprise that it's exactly the kind of major shift that I can appreciate wholeheartedly as it reinforces the dramatic undercurrent the entire film to truly sturdy stuff, sad as it may ultimately be. With a look and feel to the film that constantly highlight the uncomfortable corners those fears and anxieties lie in, writer/director/editor Jane Schoenbrun makes a whole hell of a lot out of incredible modest means, while staying on target throughout as they tackle some very heavy thematic content that reaches a suitably ambiguous ending that offers little solace to anyone, regardless of how one ultimately weighs in on what its ultimate implication may be. I don't often kick off marathons with something this difficult and heavy, but the way this got under my skin while also delivering plenty of genuine chills make this a strong start to whatever shape this marathon eventually takes.\n\nI'm not a fan but I am the rare individual that loves Zombie's Halloween 2, so I stand with you in solidarity.\n\nI believe that Zombie's Halloween sequel is his best movie and the closest he's come to making a bonafide good film. It gets trashed by many simply for how \"un-Halloween\" like it is. I mean, you can't look at that film's versions of Loomis, Laurie, and Michael and then apply them here. They are completely different characters. It's got a nice surreal bend to it and a dreamlike atmosphere that's unique to the series. Sure, he approaches this style like a regular film student would doing their best impression of David Lynch, but I can roll with it here.\n\nI'll put the rest in spoilers.\n\nI think it's a gorgeously shot film as well that makes great use 16mm. It feels exploitative. The central drama with the characters is wonderful as the events of the previous film hang over everything, and I love how they are drawn back to each other as if some force is propelling them. Laurie's story in particular, and the home drama while living at the Brackett's is so refreshing and engaging. I've always seen criticism on how Laurie is depicted as a cringey, edgy teenager; but that's exactly what she is here! The violence and kills are so disturbing as well. Very effective.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some lesser moments throughout and Rob can't help but indulge his worst tendencies as a filmmaker (it's his screenwriting, the man needs a cowriter). The ending is not very satisfying for me, and it's as if he set these pieces up quite nicely but didn't know what to do with them at the end. Oh well, I'll still go to bat for that film.\n\nHis first attempt with the series though, I can't defend as much. To me, it's a very confused and at times misguided film that unsuccessfully tried to stuff three films into one. It's still got its moments occasionally."
