For years I hankered after Slave Girls (1967), the second, cheapest and most obscure of Hammer’s prehistoric fantasies. Quickly thrown together after the success of One Million Years B.C. (1966) and filmed on the same sets and with the same costumes, Slave Girls was the story of a rhino-worshipping tribe of Amazonian women ruled by Martine Beswick. The stills I had seen showed her stretching in seductively feline poses on couches and stroking an enormous white horn. It looked sublime. Often considered one of Hammer’s worst mistakes, Slave Girls was shown first in the US under its original title of Prehistoric Women and then cut by twenty minutes for its British release, retitled and dumped at the bottom half of a bill. Despite its disastrous reputation, this was a film I needed to hunt down and ensnare, for it ticked almost too many boxes for a British exploitation fan. An anticipatory cultist, I pursued this elusive film by degrees, securing a copy of the original screenplay (now signed by Beswick!) and a vast wall-filling French poster of Femmes Prehistoriques, but the film itself was virtually impossible to see till it turned up at the Barbican in 1996 as part of a Hammer season. At last I could revel in its gaudy colour in ‘HammerScope ’ complete with stretched and grainy stock footage – and missed the second half because I had to rush for a plane. Not till the film came out on DVD in the US did I finally, with an admitted bat-squeak of disappointment, get to own and consume the whole marvellously camp farrago. Yet how could it ever live up to my imaginary construction of it? Now Slave Girls is available in Britain, uncut as Prehistoric Women, on pristine anamorphic DVD and Blu-ray, its aura diminished but not, for me, its talismanic fascination. That obscure and unloved film, more than any other in its combination of rarity, erotic thrills and tantalising subtexts prompted this book’s adventures in the wilds of British cinema since the 1950s. Asked to describe the kind of ‘trash’ I was writing about, I would eagerly enumerate the qualities and bewilderments of Slave Girls. And the feelings I have about this seemingly indefensible film – proud embarrassment at liking it, irritation that it is now easily accessible to ‘civilians’ and slightly wishing it was still just out of reach, and uncertainty about why it matters to me beyond so many other much better films – echo throughout the pages of British Trash Cinema. Slave Girls sums up, too, many of the problems of defining and making sense of British trash. It is a low-budget ‘exploitation film’, indifferently written and acted with the exception of Beswick’s imperious performance, which has earned it a minor but welldeserved cult following. The film’s flamboyant high camp is compromised by budgetary\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\nvi\n\nThe seductively feline Martine Beswick in Hammer’s Slave Girls\n\nlimitations, but that enforced rationing of ‘paracinematic’ excess itself seems typically ‘British’. Full of moments of rich idiocy, Slave Girls is surreal in the offhand way you might call an unexpected juxtaposition surreal, and there is too, from today’s perspective, a certain nostalgia in its innocent eroticism, trembling at the cusp of the Permissive Society, as well as more than a hint of self-mockery that suggests the film is not quite as daft as it looks. On the one hand, one could write about it as a laughable disaster (a ‘badfilm’, as scholars of trash say) or as a prime example of the wily cynicism with which British exploitation recycled material. But on the other hand, one could attempt an irrational enlargement, as the surrealists called it, a feverish appropriation of the film’s lurid interpretative possibilities in the language of dreams and poetry. Slave Girls is from most rational perspectives a tatty but instructive waste of celluloid, at best an example of a certain kind of impoverished and disposable pulp filmmaking. Far more subjectively, though, it is what trash cinema itself is all about – those precious fleeting moments when the commercial stumbles haphazardly into the erotically oneiric and avant-garde. For whatever else it is, Slave Girls is emphatically a film – and its pleasures are wholly cinematic ones, however transient, trivial or meretricious, and the very trashiness of their execution is catnip to cinephiles. Unburdened, it would seem, by intentional meaning, this innocently hapless film is perfect for obsession and flights of writerly fancy – or is that perhaps just special pleading by an over-excited ‘trash aesthete ’ hot for the thrills of weirdness and obscurity? Slave Girls fails comprehensively\n\nPreface\n\non a literary level, but how important, really, is that compared with cinema’s uniquely magical capture of images from the past, resurrection of the dead and the dreamlike experience of a fantasy world, however tawdry, unspooling in light? Digging a little deeper, Slave Girls, with its racial and sado-masochistic fixations, enables little stabs of insight into what might grandiosely be described as the Unconscious, even what the Marxist critic Fredric Jameson calls the Political Unconscious, of British culture seething with repression and coming apart in the 1960s. Or perhaps the film really is just rubbish after all, trash in its most demotic and throwaway sense, and not worth a second glance when there are so many shiny new Blu-rays of Great Films to improve the mind. British Trash Cinema is all about films like Slave Girls, from the first stirrings of British exploitation in the 1950s to straight-to-DVD horror in the present day. Here are the overlooked and the begging to be reappraised, the despised and the forgotten; the crassly populist and strangely compelling; mistakes, follies, botches and bold experimental disasters. Some are genre films and some uncategorisably odd. All are candidates for cult reappraisal. The discards of British cinema, these orphaned films, like trash everywhere, are worth the effort to salvage and recycle, to be made useful once again as objects of pleasure, contemplation and even scholarly indulgence. ‘Trash’ is a label in this book and not a contemptuous libel, as I’ve anxiously explained to film-makers piqued that their beloved movies pop up in its pages. Critics have often been at odds with both popular tastes, which they cannot police and regularly despair at, and with the even more recherché tastes of cultists and cineastes, who revel in bizarre and undervalued films maudits and who, when they notice British films at all, love a different kind of British cinema and perhaps a different vision of Britain. But this book is not simply an exercise in critic-baiting nor is it intended for aficionados of trash only. It is an entry-level introduction, indebted to the research of numerous amateur and academic scholars, to the underworld of British cinema since the 1950s. I didn’t set out to write an industrial history of exploitation cinema, to compile encyclopaedia entries on every British trash film, or to replicate the bravura list-making and reviews of websites like britishhorrorfilms.co.uk and the porn review site bgafd.co.uk. This book aspires neither to the peerless comprehensiveness of the most distinguished historians of British horror, such as Jonathan Rigby and David Pirie, nor to the astonishing depth of knowledge of the doyens of sex-film scholars, Simon Sheridan and Gavin Whitaker, whose gavcrimson.blogspot is an invaluable resource on British sexploitation. Here you’ll find simply the trash films I passionately wanted to write about. There is an unapologetic prejudice towards the trash I find most interesting and challenging, am offended by or protective of; films in which, for one reason or another, I have acquired an unexpected emotional investment, biased by private preferences, nostalgia and politics. In short, this book is a cinephiliac dérive through my DVD and video collection (I saw few of them in the cinema) in the hope I might communicate some of my love for and excitement about the ‘worst’ of British pictures. I have approached the films from whatever perspective and in whatever style I felt did them justice – from academic ‘symptomatic criticism’ (the default when exploring trash) to industrial history, guided by archive work and interviews with practitioners and drawing on numerous accounts of production histories by fan-archaeologists.\n\nvii\n\nviii\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\nAs I’ll explain in more detail in the first couple of chapters, the term ‘trash’ is used here in a number of overlapping ways. First, it refers, straightforwardly enough, to exploitation films – low-budget genre movies, mostly, which have sometimes gained cult reputations for their oddness and rarity. These films are trash in the sense of being designed for the built-in obsolescence of weekly exhibition cycles and the rapid turnover of video and DVD shelves. Often they are unrespectable and embarrassing films, whose attractions rely on the twin exploitation standbys of flesh and fiends, naked women and gory thrills. But there are other kinds of trash here too, such as straightforwardly ‘bad’ films like Raise the Titanic (1980), tossed aside by cinema history and changing regimes of taste. Horror, science fiction (SF) and sexploitation, thanks to the ‘New British Revisionism’ which I discuss in Chapter 1, are in comparatively less need of critical survey and recuperation than when the pleasures of British trash first sucked me in back in the early 1990s. In fact, as my research went on, fascination grew for two almost entirely ignored categories of trash – kitsch crossovers between art and exploitation, such as Boom (1968), and The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael (2005) and what is usually dismissed as rubbishy hack-work, like Dirty Weekend (1993) and Outlaw (2007). The book also tracks the wider cultural influence of trash via art cinema and underground practice on film-makers such as Ken Russell and Derek Jarman, and the creation of a commercial trash aesthetic by entrepreneurs such as Antony Balch, whose activities as director, distributor and cinema programmer cut across exploitation and the avantgarde. Throughout the book I explore not only the history of trash cinema, in the many conflicting senses of the term, but also the uses and value of trash for film-makers, cultists and, for what it is worth, myself – as a style, a heritage and a metaphor for an alternative cinema and another Britain. More covertly, this book is about the education of a trash aesthete, for whom trash cinephilia is a way of coping with the present by reimagining the past. This book should have been written and published years ago; it is shameful to admit how many. Still, for various reasons it was not and the book reflects interests that go back through my entire academic career and life as a cinephile. I am grateful to the following for granting me interviews and entering into correspondence: Anna Arrowsmith, J. G. Ballard, Martine Beswick, Rhys Davies, Vera Day, Mike Freeman, Richard Gordon, Ray Harryhausen, Lindsay Honey (www.ben-dover.biz), Poppy Morgan, Olivia Newton-John, Jonathan Sothcott and Norman J. Warren. Many colleagues and friends have helped this book on its way over the years, and I extend my thanks especially to Martin Barker, Steve Chibnall and the Cinema and Television History (CATH) Research Centre at De Montfort University, Ian Conrich, Marcus Hearn, Peter Hutchings, David McGillivray, Laura Mee, Xavier Mendik, Julian Petley, Simon Sheridan, Sarah Street, Johnny Walker, Mike Weaver and the unfailingly helpful staff at the BFI Library and the BBFC. Rebecca Barden at BFI/Palgrave commissioned and supported the book wonderfully and patiently throughout its interminable gestation. Feona Attwood, Ernest Mathijs, David McGillivray, Julian Petley, Clarissa Smith, Justin Smith, Johnny Walker and Norman J. Warren were kind enough to read and comment on chapter drafts. I should stress that the book’s failings and errors are of course entirely my own fault.\n\nPreface\n\nThe Faculty of Humanities at De Montfort University granted me study leave in 2011, which allowed me finally to start drafting the book. The Media, Film and Journalism Research Committee funded numerous visits to the BFI Library and the BBFC, and enabled me to try out some of my ideas at conferences. Duncan Murray Wines in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, fuelled the last few months of writing and helped me get through much panic, boredom and indecision. My greatest thanks by far, however, go to my beloved mother and to Elaine, the book’s dedicatee, whose love and support were inspiring at a very difficult time. The book draws on work I have published over the last fifteen or so years. Some of Chapter 4 reworks ‘The Far Side of Moon Zero Two’ in Science Fiction Studies vol. 85 (November 2001), pp. 355–64. Chapter 6 includes some material from my chapter, ‘Take an Easy Ride: Sexploitation in the 1970s’ in Robert Shail’s edited collection Seventies British Cinema (London: BFI, 2008), which is reproduced with the permission of the publishers. The section on Permissive in Chapter 7 was originally published in the booklet that accompanied the BFI’s Flipside release of Permissive on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nix\n\n1 BRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\nThis film is quite blatantly directed at a certain type of audience which, unfortunately, does exist.1 I seldom go to see British films for pleasure. I go out of duty, and invariably regret it.2\n\nWhat is your idea of a proper British picture? A stiff upper-lipped romance in a railway station? A sturdy black-and-white war film with John Mills or Richard Attenborough? Something historical, perhaps, with floppy-haired Englishmen in white flannels and Keira Knightley looking soulful in crinoline? Or one of the great crowd-pleasers: Gainsborough, Ealing, Bond, Carry On, Hammer and Harry Potter? It has been truthfully said that ‘British cinema, with the best will in the world, is more a carefully constructed illusion than a serious industry’, but the ‘brand’ of British cinema continues to have purchase on the popular imagination.3 A 2012 Film Policy Review paper on the future of the industry after the abolition of the UK Film Council (UKFC), at a time when British films were more successful than for many years, quoted British respondents as citing humour (‘a sort of dark humour’) and authenticity (‘gritty, more like real life’) as the key ‘British values’ that marked a film as British and thereby pleasingly ‘non-Hollywood’.4 In the global marketplace, meanwhile, British films seem firmly identified with classy nostalgia, realism and modest literary ambition. In 1999 the British Film Institute came up with an uncontroversial list of the 100 ‘best’ British films, topped by The Third Man (1949) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and weighted towards the 1960s.5 Consensus was that Britain could be proud of its numerous world classics, most of which were indeed, as you might expect, literary adaptations, ‘heritage films’ and realist dramas in the kitchen-sink tradition. Yet there still clings to British cinema a sense of disappointment, of being, on the one hand, in Hollywood’s shadow and, on the other, subordinate to and even oppressed by the great achievements of British theatre and the novel (for, as a current Waterstones promotion insists, ‘The book is always better’). British cinema for all its triumphs remains awkwardly stranded between art and populism, a nubile Cinderella – to borrow a line from If…. (1968) – sparsely clad and often interfered with. Debate rolls on about what is meant by a proper British picture. Controversy is sharpest over what kinds of films to support financially so as to promote both commercial success and the national culture. The Eady Levy, which channelled box-office takings back into film production from 1950 till its abolition in 1985, encouraged the international investment that underpinned the sex and horror film boom of the 1960s to\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\n2\n\nSex Lives of the Potato Men: not a proper British film?\n\nthe 1970s; and in recent years the doling out of Lottery money through the late UK Film Council led to the funding of a number of barely released, low-budget comedies, horror films and thrillers, such as Sex Lives of the Potato Men (2004) and Straightheads (2007), which, given the heterogeneity of the films supported by the UKFC, earned the Council an undue amount of negative attention.6 The Daily Telegraph in 2004, after the disastrous release of Sex Lives of the Potato Men, which concentrated critics’ minds on the funding and profile of British cinema, complained that, unlike the Arts Council, whose role the UKFC took over in 2000, the Film Council tried to second-guess the market and fund ‘commercially minded’ films, and cited ‘wan little British films that disappear quickly from cinemas’.7 Examples included Bodysong (2003), This Is Not a Love Song (2002), Emotional Backgammon (2003) and Suzy Gold (2004), none of which recouped their budget. Emotional Backgammon sold 209 tickets and grossed £1,056. Needless to say, a film like Sex Lives of the Potato Men is somewhat at odds with a definition of British cinema that rests on Harry Potter (2001–11) and Oscar-bait like The King’s Speech (2010) (also backed by the UKFC). British cinema today ranges from Wuthering Heights (2011) and Skyfall (2012) to Stag Night of the Dead (2011) – all of them, in one way or another, expressive of contemporary Britain, but who is to say which is more properly ‘authentic’? Which represents the ‘true’ British cinema that projects ‘our’ culture to the world?\n\nCINEMA IN THE RAW Beyond the heritage of official British cinema, there has always been, for want of a more precise term, British trash cinema – a long tradition of cheap exploitation and improper entertainments that has shocked, appalled, frustrated and delighted in equal measure.\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e m a\n\nInto this makeshift category are grouped all manner of critically and often popularly despised offences against what British cinema ought to be, offences even more blatant than Bond, Hammer and the Carry Ons, which by some standards are quite trashy enough. Trash represents what Charles Barr emphasised was a key component of British cinema – a ‘strong under-life – represented most powerfully by the horror film’.8 Here are weird, obscure, haphazardly surreal and marginal films, compellingly bad and entrancingly bizarre, the sort of films that mainstream critics disdain or simply never see but which cultists seek out (or rather nowadays click to purchase on amazon.com or download as torrents). Much of this is ‘psychotronic’ cinema, as Michael Weldon called it, condemned by critics ‘for the very reasons that millions continue to enjoy them: violence, sex, noise, and often violent escapism’.9 They especially appeal to that category of film fan, the ‘trash cinephile’ who revels in films exiled from the mainstream and ‘is far too cynical to sit through whimsical romantic comedy, or a big budget event movie’.10 This book outlines some of the key modes of British trash cinema, and their reception by their original intended audiences, but it is also, and in many ways more fundamentally, about the contemporary cult of trash cinema. Many of the films are not cult films – or at any rate not yet, though the field of British cinema as a whole is certainly the object of cult interest. But the reasons for getting interested in these films, and the pleasures they afford viewers today who watch them in a generous and receptive spirit, are absolutely informed by cult. There is then a dual perspective on the films – on the one hand, a neutral view which summarises the history of trash, and on the other, a cult view, not the same as that of the intended audiences, which addresses the films’ particular attractions and, more important, uses for a certain kind of excessively committed viewer. Most obviously trash cinema includes exploitation and sexploitation films – lowbudget horror and science fiction, shoestring sex comedies and softcore pornography, which are typically dismissed as the lowest, most formulaic and sometimes most dangerously corrupting manifestations of film production.11 From the 1950s to the 1980s over 400 exploitation films were made in Britain, ranging from international hits, such as Hammer’s Dracula (1958), to eternal outcasts little seen outside specialist cinemas, such as the sex films Come Play with Me (1977) and Erotic Inferno (1975). They count as trash because they are or were regarded as worthless, disposable and ephemeral junk; in short, not so much bad but disgraceful, and consequently the target of harassment by censors and moral guardians, who in Britain have long been suspicious of cinema’s delinquent energy and popular reach. Cultists have of course revived interest in the margins of cinema, especially horror and sex films, and it is cultists with a taste for low genres, bad taste and bad films, kitsch and the frankly sub-cinematic who are the main enthusiasts nowadays for British films which, however popular at the time, have since fallen by the canonical wayside. But British trash cinema is arguably distinct from the disreputable cult cinemas of the US and continental Europe. It is less well known, for one thing. Hammer apart, British trash remains a niche cult among cults. It is true that the most celebrated of all cult films, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), is indeed British, but how many fans of that unique prefabricated trash movie went on to explore Devil Girl from Mars\n\n3\n\n4\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\n(1954), Psychomania (1973), Toomorrow (1970), Vampyres (1974), Big Zapper (1974), Dirty Weekend and the unforgettable kitsch of Boom and Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness? (1969)? Most Rocky Horror fans, I suspect, kept their virginity as regards such obscure gems. Yet each of those films can boast a select following of connoisseurs. Many times I’ve witnessed eyes light up in disbelieving recall at the mention of Psychomania – zombie bikers! Beryl Reid turning into a frog! As Fangoria sardonically remarked, that film ‘is an artefact of post-mod British kitsch, admired with irony and worshipped by millions, perhaps thousands, even dozens of cult movie fans around the globe ’.12 For, alas, its cultists are few indeed, even in Britain, compared to those of the Italian horror maestro Lucio Fulci, the inept American auteur Ed Wood and, attracting the largest cohort of fans of British films, James Bond. British trash also – how can I put this? – feels different from other trash cinemas (in ways not all cultists will respond to) thanks to the impact of restrictive censorship and the peculiar social, production and distribution contexts of British film. Although this book trolls through a cinema of transgression, not all of it is a wild ride into excess, subversion and lurid erotic defiance. British trash is also, and perhaps mostly, a cinema of routine underachievement, of stupid sub-B movies, austerity thrillers, unfunny comedies and failed grabs at naughtiness. Sometimes inspired, frequently weird, often sad and desperate – rather, in fact, like Britain itself – our trash cinema opens onto not only a world of exotic pleasures but also one of compromise and impoverishment, thwarted ambition, social embarrassment, silent erotic yearning and suburban boredom. That, being British myself, with a stereotypical fondness for unassuming mediocrity and gallant failure, is reason enough for me to love it.\n\nBEASTS IN THE CELLAR Trash refers in large part to what Julian Petley in 1986 famously called, borrowing the term from Hammer’s 1968 fantasy, ‘the Lost Continent’.13 Petley, in a foundational article for what I’ll risk capitalising as the New British Revisionism in Film Studies, highlighted the crucial counter-tradition of romance and anti-realism in British cinema, which had been overlooked for reasons of class, aesthetic snobbery and hostility to popular cinema and even, you might say, to cinema itself: ‘an other, repressed side of British cinema, a dark, disdained thread weaving the length and breadth of that cinema, crossing authorial and generic boundaries, sometimes almost entirely visible, sometimes erupting explosively, always received critically with fear and disapproval’.14 This lost continent included not only trash but the saturated romanticism of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, and the Gothic tradition of Hammer and its imitators, as well as the ambitious hybrid art cinema of Ken Russell and Peter Greenaway. Emerging from deeply culturally embedded traditions of fantasy, nonsense and absurd humour, this was a heterogeneous cinema which challenged the subordination of cinema to literature and theatre. Visceral and ‘visual’, boldly mythic and erotic, it had been habitually overlooked by critics committed to realism and the literary. The films, from art house to horror, still challenge dominant conceptions of British cinema and expand its range and remit beyond what cultural gatekeepers allow. Kate Egan makes the crucial point that horror films, for example, and especially modern ones,\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e m a\n\nare not considered in relation to the idea that they are commercial ventures based around spectacle and fantasy, but are measured against a realist norm, where the logic and plausibility of narrative and characterisation always takes priority over the visual and spectacular.15\n\nConsequently, reviewers tend to ‘view any deviation from the notion that a narrative should be convincing, logical and realistic as evidence of a “bad” film’.16 The keynote of the films of the lost continent was fantasy, even a strain of British surrealism. Many of the films Petley highlighted were popular genre films, which critical convention had overlooked or taken for granted – the horror films in particular. But beyond them is, as well as other genres, unpopular popular cinema – films catering to the wrong people (devotees of sex cinemas, for example), or films barely seen at all, or flops even in otherwise successful genres. Tom Ryall, referring to British cinema in the 1930s, highlights the importance of conceiving of national cinema as being as diverse as the nation it represents. British cinema has always been torn between art and entertainment, low culture and literary ambition, imitation and rejection of Hollywood, public-service realism and genre: The notion of a sub-current or an alternative oppositional strand of national cinema is important in the analysis of the idea of national cinema itself. The term ‘national cinema’ is often locked into a form of essentialism which implies the possibility of a single unitary form of expression which can be designated as representative of a nation. A corollary of this is that there also exists a unitary national culture which can simply be mapped onto a set of cinematic signifiers to constitute the national cinema. Britain, however, as a political entity has been carved out of a variety of regions and nations, ways of life which can be differentiated from each other in terms of gender, class and race. National cinemas in their overall profile necessarily reflect such differences and, indeed, can be conceptualised as elements in the broader arena of ideology.17\n\nThis notion of an alternative or ‘dark side ’ of British cinema is a provocative and attractive metaphor, and I’ll exploit it ruthlessly throughout this book. But it can be criticised as an oversimplification, like the other handy binaries which bedevil mappings of British cinema, such as Michael Balcon’s phrase ‘realism and tinsel’, and which denote two opposing strands in British cinema.18 For a start, it depends on what is meant by realism, which is an endlessly moveable feast; and also by what’s meant by alternative? The problem critics had, for example, with the horror films that sprang up in the 1950s was that they were too realistic by half in the sense of explicit – all that blood and cleavage – and that they left little to the imagination. Films like Dracula and Horrors of the Black Museum (1959), in which spring-loaded binoculars stab spikes into a young woman’s eyes, were an advance in their unprecedented directness; like the kitchen-sink films of the same period, they updated British cinema by splashing across the screen what had hitherto been politely left off it. The scandal of Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom (1960), that period’s key film maudit, was not that it depicted a surreal fantasy world but that it was too close to home, its monster too human, its violence too intimate and its depiction of Soho too seedily precise. British cinema has often prided itself on undercutting the\n\n5\n\n6\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\nescapist fantasies of Hollywood, and the radical, influential novelty of such groundbreaking genre films as The Quatermass Xperiment (1954) was that it dragged horror into the terrors of contemporary life. The same might be said of the nudist and sex films that proliferated from the late 1950s. They were realist films rather than exercises in make-believe and often disguised as documentaries. Their motives were not so different from the British New Wave ’s. They revelled in sexual openness, voyeurism, changing mores and the unconsidered lives and desires of ordinary people. It is true that the emphasis of such exploitation films on spectacle and their direct address to real-life peeping Toms worked against some of the self-effacing conventions of narrative cinema; but the appeal of exploitation and its unique promise to viewers was that it would show them the world naked – as nature intended. A similar revelatory impulse is at work in the sex comedies of the 1970s and even the hardcore films of contemporary pornographers such as Lindsay Honey (Ben Dover) and Anna Span, which, concretising homely fantasies in familiar domestic landscapes, document flabby white bodies in poorly matched cheap underwear exerting themselves in motel rooms, council flats and suburban kitchen-diners. The surrealism of Psychomania – zombies, frogs, Beryl Reid and all – lies not so much in its resurrected biker suicides but in seeing them do the ton on the M3 and rampage around supermarkets in nondescript Walton-on-Thames. Stylistically, too, while the films of Powell and Pressburger and Ken Russell certainly blurred the worlds of dream and the everyday, their ‘excesses’ were arty authorial interventions. Most of the ‘dark side ’ films in fact conformed to the usual rules of classical cinema, and were far from the subversive tradition of any strand of modernism and the avant-garde, whether surrealist, underground or the rigorously experimental abolitions of convention attempted by Jeff Keen, Peter Gidal and Laura Mulvey in the 1970s. In fact, if one is looking for a truly hidden and ‘unknown’ British cinema – to use Alan Lovell’s memorable phrase – well, that better describes arty oddities such as Herostratus (1967) and The Riddle of the Sphinx (1977) rather than Fire Maidens of Outer Space (1956) or Psychomania, which, curious as they were, at least reached mainstream audiences and had an afterlife on late-night television.19 That suggests another problem with the ‘dark side’ or lost-continent metaphor: the popular cinema it describes may have been critically disregarded, but it was hardly invisible. Indeed, so far as critics were concerned, it was often too visible, cluttering up cinemas with censor-baiting rubbish like Virgin Witch (1971) and Confessions of a Sex Maniac (1974), which audiences were far too willing to consume. The films were not genuinely undiscovered, except by critics adrift from popular taste; the films were simply ignored, taken for granted and hidden in plain sight down at the local Odeon or Jacey. There is a final reason not to get too carried away with dramatic metaphors of dark side and lost continent. Reviewers and critics, with perhaps the exception of Raymond Durgnat, overlooked these films simply because most of them weren’t very good. They were in fact trash, and the thankless task of writing about them could be left to the trade press and Monthly Film Bulletin. And it is indeed true that many trash films engage us only to the degree that they are vaguely symptomatic of trends in British cinema and society; even the most partisan cultist would struggle to say much else about Nudist Memories (1959) and Paul Raymond’s Erotica (1981). In any case the lost continent was\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e m a\n\nnot uniformly transgressive and disturbing. Little attention was paid to Not Now Darling (1973), The Slipper and the Rose (1976) and Wombling Free (1977), but it was not because critics recoiled from them in bourgeois disgust. Innocuous minor films rather than exploitation, they could tell you something about popular entertainment and public taste, but it hardly seemed worth analysing them in detail or breaking the butterfly of their trivial significance upon the wheel of film theory.\n\nTHE NEW BRITISH REVISIONISM Since the 1980s Petley’s lost continent has become increasingly familiar ground as well as a – perhaps the – presiding cliché of recent British film scholarship.20 Vast tracts of the continent have been excavated in a spirit of cinephile curiosity. The ‘systematic and creative process of rethinking British cinema’, as Jeffrey Richards welcomed it, has been industriously pursued by film academics but crucially also by film fans and savvy video and DVD companies, such as Redemption, Jezebel, Odeon Entertainment and recently the BFI.21 Films that, when I started getting into British trash back in the 1990s, were merely rumours, titles patiently reviewed in Monthly Film Bulletin or blurred fourthgeneration copies of ‘pre-cert’ videos are suddenly available once more thanks to DVD and the internet. The BFI’s Flipside series of DVD and Blu-ray reissues offers rarities like the mondo film Primitive London (1965), the first British sex film Her Private Hell (1968) and the Swinging London drama Joanna (1968) with elaborate notes and commentaries, and relocates them from low culture to specialist cult items. Odeon Entertainment’s DVDs similarly present sex films, from Take Off Your Clothes and Live (1963) to Come Play with Me, and mislaid gems like the horror film Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny and Girly (1970) under the unlikely banner of ‘The Best of British’, which at least acknowledges that ‘Britishness’ may lurk in even the lowest cultural products. At the same time, maligned aspirational kitsch like The Magus (1968) and Hammersmith Is Out (1972) are newly available or can be watched in pirated snippets on YouTube. Even movies that were never released, such as Queen Kong (1976), or which embarrassed the inside of cinemas for merely days, as did Toomorrow, can be easily imported or downloaded by insatiable film fans. Moreover, new kinds of British trash continue to mushroom, such as straight-to-DVD comedy-horror films like Kill Keith (2012) and Strippers vs Werewolves (2012). Since 2000, legitimate British hardcore pornography on video and DVD has been passed by the British Board of Film Classification – a whole new category of British film production, albeit secreted away safely in sex shops. Although cultists may regret the loss in rarity value of their treasured pre-cert videos, this is plenty indeed. As I look at the piles of DVDs at home and in the office, I am dazzled by the sight of so many films I thought I’d never see, with even the most trivial of them afforded more lavish treatment on DVD than masterworks by Ozu and Bergman. Exploitation, sex films, pornography, the work of ‘sleaze artists’ of all kinds – what was once the province of a handful of cultists is also the subject of an academic industry. Books by fan-scholars from small presses such as FAB Press and Headpress and academic imprints playing catch-up have provided detailed histories of not only Hammer but exploitation companies such as Tony Tenser’s Tigon and once patronised genres such as the crime film, science fiction movie, 1930s ‘quota quickies’ and the British B movie.22 Even the sex comedy of the 1970s, perhaps the low-point of British cinema’s\n\n7\n\n8\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\ncreativity, has its superbly committed historians, who demonstrate that the films offer valuable insights into the tastes, values and frustrated desires of ordinary filmgoers at a period of rapid social and moral change, when sexploitation was one of the few thriving areas of indigenous cinema.23 TV programmes on the sex film, the British SF film and the B movie have drawn on this work to explore the territory with enthusiasm and sympathy.24 In short, a field of study once wholly beneath contempt is not only now visible but well served by both fandom and academia. The outlines of British film history have been revised and the canon of British cinema reordered. This canon has edged, thanks partly to generational change among critics and ‘acafans’ (academics who also identify as fans), towards populism, genre cinema and cult favourites whose transgressive and stylised realism caught the imagination of youth audiences. This is of course not a phenomenon restricted to British cinema. Interest has shifted generally in Film Studies to complement cultists’ enthusiasm for the low and exploitation cinema of many countries. Cultists have long valued the energy and combative artistry of American trash films by exploitation directors such as Roger Corman and the badfilm chaotician Doris Wishman and the gory extremism of Italian exploitation cinema from the 1960s to 1980s. Indeed, the last twenty years has seen the flourishing of Cult Film Studies as an academic field of its own, and a wealth of publications specifically devoted to trash, sleaze, exploitation and pornography.25 Moya Luckett, dating British canonical revisionism to the 1990s and the influence of lad-centred magazines like Loaded and its swaggering take on Cool Britannia, comments on ‘the formation of a new British film canon that counters traditional heritage-centred ideas of British cinema … this “alternative” canon focuses on violence, style and sexuality as well as more traditionally reified traditions of British horror and comedy’.26 British cinema is now as closely identified with its cult films, such as Get Carter (1971), The Wicker Man (1973) and Withnail and I (1987), as with its literary, realist and heritage traditions, though the cult films are caught up in those as well. Few of the most celebrated of these newly canonised cult films find their way into this book, but their qualities – eccentricity, dubious taste, allegorical significance – are often shared by the films that do. But other kinds of films have emerged as central to our understanding of British cinema, inspired by a renewed interest in auteurs committed to outrage, offence and tastelessness, such as, pre-eminently, Ken Russell, who infiltrated low genres with a radical style and an enthusiasm for vulgarity and excess, and who was at once inimical to British film tradition and deeply embedded in British Romanticism, low comedy and simple eccentricity. It is not petty nationalism either to reclaim our heritage of trash. The links between British cinema and American and continental European talent and money work against any easy notions of trash films representing more ‘authentic’ versions of national identity. As Andrew Higson remarks, ‘English cinema has been hybrid from the very start’ and contemporary British cinema, from Harry Potter blockbusters to straight-to-DVD trash, is more transnational than ever.27 The symbolic centre of that revision, and indeed of the lost continent itself, is the aforementioned Peeping Tom. It is now regarded as a classic, and – since this is an argument about aesthetics and critical preferences as well as definitions – one of the greatest British films ever made. Its passage from trash to classic, though a familiar tale, remains exemplary and instructive.\n\nPeeping Tom: the greatest British film maudit\n\nPeeping Tom was greeted with an appalled critical reaction in 1960, Derek Hill in Tribune saying, ‘The only satisfactory way to dispose of Peeping Tom would be to shovel it up and slush it swiftly down the nearest sewer. Even then the stench would remain.’28 The film was beyond trash; it was abject and excremental. The critical reaction to Peeping Tom – though it was actually a modest commercial hit29 – ended Powell’s film career in Britain. It was in France that its merits (like those of Hammer director Terence Fisher) were first recognised. As Peter Wollen notes, French critics ‘concentrated on the issue of sadism, probably because the French critics who first praised the film, in Positif and MidiMinuit were heavily influenced by Surrealism and hence by André Breton’s own fascination with the Marquis de Sade’.30 The film has since been recuperated by academics for its self-reflexive discourse on film, voyeurism and pathology – useful, twinned with Psycho (1960), for illustrating the male gaze in seminars – and by cultists of Powell, who also appreciate it as a film about film, a genre cultists often warm to. The film, full of the kind of in-jokes that please cinephiles, such as Powell’s playing Mark Lewis’s (Carl Boehm) sadistic father, is also very knowing about pornographic subcultures in Britain at the end of the 1950s, and uncomfortably links the world of cinema to that of exploitation – Lewis takes photographs, for example, for a character based on the glamour photographer Harrison Marks.31 Though released as an exploitation film by AngloAmalgamated, Peeping Tom also works as an intense art film, transgressing boundaries between high and low culture, not least by focusing on psychoanalysis rather as Hitchcock did, and the film’s cult is partly a response to this boundary crossing. It was influential especially on Martin Scorsese: the ‘neon-expressionism’ of Taxi Driver (1976) owes much to its sordid and saturated realism. If Peeping Tom is a new centre of gravity for understanding British cinema – if its most excremental film becomes its pivotal and\n\n10\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\nperhaps greatest one – then this revision, founded on 1960s auteurism (the same impulse that elevated Psycho into the ultimate film) and backed up by cultists, has implications for rethinking British cinema entirely.\n\nREVISIONISM TRIUMPHANT? In part this revisionism involves a drive towards completism, a desire by fans and academics to map the whole of the territory in a kind of panoptic frenzy that allows no film to go uncollected, unlabelled and unaccounted for. This utopianism will end, perhaps, only when every last film, and every last person who made it, saw it and wrote about it has been accounted for by the recording angel of British film criticism. But revisionism is also a modest shift towards taking account of the films that audiences, especially working-class ones, actually watched at cinemas – an astonished acknowledgment, for example, that On the Buses was the most successful British film of 1971 and grossed over £1 million in domestic rentals in the first six months of release. Revisionism investigates the persistence of the sex comedy, from Confessions of a Window Cleaner, the top British film of 1974, to The Inbetweeners Movie, similarly successful in 2011, rather than regarding it as evidence of the recidivist hopelessness of public taste. Revisionism encourages us to take seriously films few people saw and fewer still liked, or which, like sexploitation and hardcore porn, virtually no one even admits to watching. As well as films, this revisionism pays homage to the lived experience of cinemagoing and to forgotten audiences of the past, from the proverbial ‘man in a mac’ to the habitués of rep cinema clubs like the Scala in London. Revisionism asks such questions as who went to sex cinemas in the 1960s and 1970s, with their teasing visions of continental plenty and suburban wickedness. What was it actually like to sidle furtively into the Jacey Piccadilly and enjoy time out from everyday suburban life? How did one anticipate the visit and cope afterwards with the disappointment of yet another film that promised so many thrills and delivered so few? This new wave of revisionism, inspired equally by scholarship and cult enthusiasm, is, in the end, a defence of British cinema and its unruly multiplicity. It is a reaction against the negative definitions of the ‘Britishness’ of British cinema, that disappointment I mentioned at the start of the chapter – the idea that it is theatrical, staid, overliterary and generally lives down to François Truffaut’s much quoted comment about the incompatibility of British and cinema and the contempt expressed thus in the 1960s by the British auteurist journal Movie: ‘The British cinema is as dead as before. Perhaps it was never alive.’32 Revisionism wrenches the canon away from middlebrow and middle-class critical preferences, and takes seriously the commercial aims of the industry, changing contexts of reception and the unpretentious tastes of real audiences. Insofar as taste judgments go, revisionism may involve a critical animus against official definitions of British cinema, such as the irritated boredom that has bubbled up since the 1980s against the reactionary and nostalgic British cinema represented by Merchant–Ivory, Chariots of Fire (1981) and Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994). One catches that in David Thomson’s comment (though he is appreciative of The Remains of the Day (1993)) that ‘The loveliness of Merchant–Ivory gives me the creeps … . Merchant–Ivory is Masterpiece Theatre moviemaking: prestigious, well furnished,\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e m a\n\naccurate, prettily cast – and bland, anonymous and stealthily interchangeable. Can you tell one Ivory-ized classic author from another?’33 And it is there too in Ken Russell’s characteristically forthright complaint that The success of a film like Howard’s [sic] End [1992] at the Oscars, BAFTA and elsewhere is depressing. Is this how the British cinema will end? Not with a bang, but a genteel whimper in full period costume?34\n\nIndeed, from a revisionist perspective, ‘bad’ British films, the ones that really betray the possibilities of cinema, are those conventionally associated with that kind of conservative quality film-making. Rather as the New Wave scorned the tradition of quality in French cinema, so we might sympathise with Anne Billson when she despairs at the visually drab blandness of much of our official cinema: I once heard a British film director say in an interview that he wasn’t interested in telling a story visually (why were you directing a bloody film then?), and it’s clear he’s not the only one. Historically, Britain has produced more world-class writers than painters, and words tend to be valued far above visual imagery, if only because reading and listening apparently require more effort than looking, and so are deemed to be worthier pursuits. A lot of British film-makers assume that screenplay equals dialogue, and because the Brits still haven’t caught on to William Goldman’s maxim that ‘Screenplay is structure’, we get endless exposition and a plodding procession of scenes unfurling like stage plays. Scene begins, there’s some dialogue, scene ends, next scene begins, more dialogue and so on. Lawks-a-mercy, we might as well be watching a Restoration drama at the Old Vic.35\n\nIn that sense, then, contemporary revisionism is not neutral at all. It reflects a decision (political as much as aesthetic) in favour of pleasures and purposes for British cinema different from those represented by, say, Richard Curtis’s films, which, as James Leggott writes, ‘triggered expansive, and usually sniffy, analysis of Curtisland, deemed by many an unpalatably selective and politically suspect version of Britain, populated by characters in thrall to American culture and to a facile romance of instant attraction’.36 (Indeed, so far has the pendulum swung that it is probably now more transgressive to admit admiration for Love Actually (2003) than for Confessions of a Sex Maniac.)37 As will be obvious in this book, emotional investment as well as scholarly neutrality is involved. I want passionately to impress on the reader that Frightmare (1974) is not only symptomatic of social upheavals in the 1970s but one of the decade’s best films, and that the films of the pornographer John Lindsay and the later films of the arch-populist Michael Winner are not wholly without interest and merit. Alan Lovell summarised complaints about British cinema in the early 1970s: ‘British films are generally mediocre; they have no style; they lack humour; they are snobbish and class-bound; they are too dependent on documentary modes; too literary; too unsophisticated.’38 The point of comparison then may have been European art cinema or canonical Hollywood, but the same complaints are still made by cinephiles bored by the latest Terence Davies or The King’s Speech (an excellent film, but …) and retching after contamination by the Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady (2011).\n\n11\n\nSheila Keith and her lunch in Frightmare, one of the best British films of the 1970s\n\nIn fact, as I must admit, this revisionism, which was once a radical view of British cinema, is now getting pretty orthodox. There is a new openness from critics towards British genre cinema, exploitation film and the cinema of bad taste. It is important, therefore, not to set ‘critics’ up as a convenient and monolithic shorthand for Daily Mail-ish middlebrow reaction; for in many ways the argument is being won. Although an overview of changing critical tastes falls outside this book, it is notable that reviewers these days, in broadsheets as well as magazines like Empire and Total Film, are likely to reflect and even identify with cult tastes, rather as Time Out did in the 1970s and 1980s. One got a sense of that from the critical reception of Kill List in 2011. An ultraviolent hybrid of hit-man thriller and horror film, it was lauded by critics as different as Philip French, the veteran reviewer of the Observer, and fan websites one might expect to enthuse about such gory fare; and many compared it to The Wicker Man, a cult horror film that has moved to the very centre of the new canon of British cinema. Although the 1999 BFI poll mentioned earlier was more conventional in its canon formation, Time Out’s 2001 poll of ‘the best British film of all time ’ was topped by another horror film, albeit an arty auteurist one, Nicolas Roeg’s giallo-esque Don’t Look Now (1973).39 The canon has shifted. There is, it must be said, echoing points made earlier, nothing especially subversive about this revisionism, which undoubtedly rests on an over-schematic opposition\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e m a\n\nbetween a straw man official British cinema and a conveniently imagined (wicker man?) counter-cinema. The lost continent and the dark side are valuable metaphors but do remain problematic for the reasons I outlined before. Thomas Elsaesser drolly remarked, echoing Ryall, that British cinema ‘always functions around [a] polarization – what one might call an “official” cinema and an “unofficial” cinema, a respectable cinema and a disreputable one’ and that this ‘Jekyll-and-Hyde, yin-yang quality of the British cinema, first analyzed by Raymond Durgnat, has in its “realism versus romanticism” version become one of the orthodoxies of academic film studies. Both sides – romantic and realist – have their clichéd “mythemes”.’40\n\nSOME AIMS In the view of the New British Revisionism there are, then, a number of different, overlapping, and at times competing as well as complementary projects. First, remapping British cinema and acknowledging without necessarily elevating its low products. Suspending conventional aesthetic standards, the aim is to understand them in relation to genre, audiences and conditions of commercial production and distribution. The films are integrated into the industrial and social history of British cinema and, regardless of cultural and aesthetic qualities, their particular economic functions are put centre stage. This is absolutely crucial. In relation to horror film, this has been achieved so comprehensively that I admit I have often struggled to say anything new or interesting about them. This (over)emphasis on horror reflects a general, international cult fascination with violent bad taste and the ‘transgressiveness’ of gore; it reflects too, perhaps, the enthusiasm of male cultists and scholars for the coolly marginal and extreme. Happily there is still much work of recovery and gap-filling to do in other, less obviously ‘culty’ genres. The sex comedies of the 1970s are now acknowledged as important, perhaps because their combination of bawdy and embarrassment about sex seems quintessentially British, but little has been written about low-budget thrillers, camp and kitsch films, pop musicals, fantasy and SF, hardcore pornography, and the wealth of ‘bad films’ across all British genres. Auteurism, still a default perspective in cultism, where much of the foundational revisionist work began, also encouraged focusing on directors, such as Terence Fisher and Michael Reeves, at the expense of writers, actors, set designers, cameramen, composers, editors and producers, whose contribution to British cinema is only starting to be explored. Second, re-evaluating these films and inserting some of them on their merits into the canon of British cinema. This is a major achievement, and again it is horror (Dracula, Peeping Tom, Witchfinder General (1968), The Wicker Man), along with that other ‘male’ genre, the crime film (The Italian Job (1969), Performance (1970), Get Carter, The Long Good Friday (1980)), that has seen the most enthusiastic advocacy. Even so, there is much more you can do with films than simply judge them good or bad, or indeed ‘so bad they’re good’. The trash films in this book, which as a cultist I often value very highly, are rarely ‘good’ by conventional standards, but this begs many vexed and fundamental questions. Who decides what counts as a good film? How far do judgments of value and taste reflect distinctions based on class and cultural status rather than access to universal aesthetic standards? Why do popular\n\n13\n\n14\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\nand critical tastes diverge and why do they change over time? And why – if I may strike a personal note – do I positively love trash like Psychomania while ‘modern classics’ such as Distant Voices Still Lives (1988) make me lose the will to live? How can some films seemingly without value be yet so valuable to me? The issue of value and quality remains, for me, in many ways impenetrable, and I’ll return to it in bafflement and confusion many times in the course of this book. This leads on to the next and most ambitious and combative project of the New British Revisionism: Third, resisting and replacing official conceptions of British cinema, canonicity, indeed cinema itself, in accordance with what might be called trash aesthetics. This is down to fans and cultists as much as film critics and scholars, though the distinction between freelance trash mavens and film academics is increasingly moot. Here we must confront the problem of what we do with all these disinterred trash films? Revisionism hints at new ways of writing about British cinema, drawing on fan and cinephile discourses as much as on academic ones. On the one hand, we can still pursue the usual methods of film scholarship and set the films in their generic and cultural contexts, analyse them for their ideological underpinnings, and offer tentative appraisals of their ‘quality’ (a different thing, of course, to recapturing the meaning and value they had for their original intended audiences). But, on the other hand, there are other less scholarly and more ‘cultist’ approaches that could lead us far away from level-headed normative film interpretation – towards, for example, hermetically private responses to the films’ photogenic qualities, or autobiographical accounts of the life-changing significance of trash to cultists’ identities and politics. There is one final and more elusive reason to re-map British cinema. Insofar as the national imaginary is influenced by films, then rethinking the canon goes further than arguing that British cinema is as much about horror and sex, low pleasures and high camp as it is about Forster and Brief Encounter (1945). Trash films project, if you like, an alternative psychogeography of Britain that allows us to rethink what is meant by Britishness itself. Watched end to end, British trash cinema is an epic mondo film reporting back on Britain’s imaginative edgelands, far removed from the stately homogeneity of heritage cinema.\n\n2 BRITISH TRASH CINEPHILIA\n\nWhy should anyone care about trash? Plucking masterpieces from dross is a wholly respectable activity; you might even say it is our chief duty as critics and film fans. Providing a comprehensive overview of film production is equally important if we’re to understand how and why films get made and critical and audience tastes change. But why enthuse about and even prefer trash films that may be very ‘bad’ indeed? Why does the Blu-ray of Andrea Arnold’s Wuthering Heights, dutifully rented from LOVEFiLM after good reviews in the Guardian and Sight and Sound, still languish unwatched next to my TV, while I leapt at the chance to see Stag Night of the Dead on the Horror Channel? We need to step back and define the role of trash generally in contemporary culture, and then to ask why trash films in particular became objects of critical and cult interest.\n\nTRASH, CLASS AND CULTURE Trash is necessarily a loose term, as much defined by films that tickle a certain sensibility as a predictable combination of qualities already mentioned, such as kitsch, surreal, tasteless and weird. I chose it because, though ‘trash’ seems a derogatory word, redolent merely of contempt and dismissal, it chimes with the enthusiasm for the lower pleasures of cinema itself that have energised film critics from Parker Tyler to Pauline Kael and J. Hoberman and artists generally from the surrealists to postmodernists.1 It also links to a wealth of scholarship by aca-fans about exploitation and bad films that has flourished since the 1980s, in which the term ‘trash cinema’ is a convenient synonym for exploitation without any pejorative intention.2 The term ‘trash’ obviously has wider cultural meanings than just film. In culture, trash is not a precise category, but rather, like a genre or a mode, changeable and pragmatic, in part evaluative (badness, indifference to aesthetic value, throwaway), in part descriptive (a style of reckless or hapless excess and lack of inhibition), and in part simply denoting aesthetically null aspects of popular culture – the disposable products of society, anonymous, replaceable, ephemeral and seemingly worthless – in short, the vulgar. The conception of trash in culture emerged with modernism and avant-garde high art, with trash being identified with popular culture tout court rather than with the ‘lowest’ level of it. In this book there are two main ways of defining trash in general – one refers to everyday disposable culture, which might equally be called junk; the other to low culture, so low as to be more or less oppositional. Trash certainly embraces culture – commercial, not folk – aimed at and enjoyed if rarely made by the working class. This is what Leon Hunt means, in the context of\n\n16\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\nBritain in the 1970s, by ‘low culture’.3 In Britain one might think of what developed from the proletarian culture of naughty postcards, music hall and fairgrounds, pulp novels, low comedy – the aspects of British culture explored by Orwell, for instance, in his celebration of the saucy postcard artist Donald McGill, whose vulgar comedy is ‘the voice of the belly protesting against the soul’.4 But this kind of British low culture, which might be seen as in some senses authentic, has often been regarded, on left and right, as continuously threatened by the insidious encroach of Americanised popular culture, more violent, anomic and amoral; that fear, in which America represented modernity itself, has certainly underpinned fears about the horror film, from Hammer to the ‘video nasties’, and pornography. The notion that the ‘United States is a corrupting influence in British cultural life’ has, as James Kendrick reminds us, been a continuous thread in British moral panics.5 (Conversely, the uninhibited brashness of American popular culture has been an inspiration to the British working class, eager to escape from the binding shackles of the British class system.) But the conception of trash as low culture also implies that it is the culture, both imposed and appropriated, of people who are considered trash and who are especially vulnerable to its influence and ‘effects’. The audience for trash is an audience of Others, whether it is the working class or the aspirant middle class (whose preference is for that disturbing imitation of high culture, kitsch). In fact, we cannot understand trash at all without relating it to class and to the relations of power that police the boundaries between trash and legitimate culture, since trash, like rubbish generally, only becomes recognised as such by social conventions. As Michael Thompson argues: only if one remains within severe cultural and temporal confines can one sustain the commonsense belief that rubbish is defined by intrinsic physical properties. Step outside these limits and one sees that the boundary between rubbish and non-rubbish moves in response to social pressures.6\n\nThe key aspect of trash and low culture in general is that they work on the body and emotions in direct – often embarrassingly direct – ways. Mikita Brottman remarks that ‘middle-class resistance to “low” culture is rooted in the conception of a “proper” body, distanced physically and geographically from the grotesque “improper” body associated with “bad” tastes and “bad” places’.7 Trash induces emotional participation in ways that clash with middle-class taste, which typically valorises intellectual and ironic distance. Trash is appreciated along the nerves and in the guts and groin rather than coolly at a safe remove; in film, for example, this is especially true of what Linda Williams calls ‘body genres’, such as horror, melodrama, low comedy and pornography, which shortcircuit the intellect and incite intimate and even convulsive bodily response.8 As James Twitchell says, ‘physical arousal is almost always involved in the experience. Generating laughter, tears, shivers, and swoons is what “junk” usually strives for’.9 A survey of trash is thus an act of reclamation that rescues historical tastes and pleasures from (crudely) the enormous condescension of middle-class (and male) critics and gatekeepers of taste towards the fetid, soiling, toxic working class and its ‘diet’ of junk culture. It is a history of popular pleasures, a subversive carnival that, on the whole, official culture wished certain classes of people did not enjoy because, like its close metaphorical equivalent junk food, it is probably terribly bad for them.\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e p h i l i a\n\nThe notion of trash therefore involves a complex matrix of associations closely bound up with class and power. But trash has positive connotations too, insofar as it possesses an anarchic uncivilised immediacy that is uncontaminated by the bourgeois realm of art. Trash challenges the socially imposed authority of top-down high culture, which so often feels alien to everyday experience and desires. Trash culture, from this point of view, can be revalued as the cultural Id, the Unconscious Other of repressed middle-class taste. Hence trash can be turned, by artists for example and by cultural critics, into a resource and a weapon to attack conventional value judgments – not by integrating trash into ‘legitimate ’ art (elevating it, in other words) but by passionately embracing it, re-evaluating it and declaring its superior authenticity – an attitude often associated with camp and the subversive cultural practices of gay artists, critics and consumers. If trash is a term imposed, contemptuously, on low cultural products, it can also be appropriated as a transgressive style and an inspiration for creativity (a bit like ‘outsider art’). Indeed the conversion of trash into art has become the key signature of postmodern culture, which, as Gillian Whiteley says, ‘in its pluralist embracing of mass culture … took on kitsch and trash, often conflating the two. In a curiously inverse aesthetic, trash has achieved primacy.’10 The conflation of art and trash, high and low culture, from Schwitters and merz to the pop of Richard Hamilton and Andy Warhol and the emergence in the 1960s of a voraciously indiscriminate postmodernism is well beyond the remit of this book, but it is an essential framework for understanding how trash has shifted from the margins to the centre of contemporary culture, not least because, being rubbish, it falls outside conventional value systems.11 As Jonathan Culler has said, ‘Rubbish has … become an essential resource for modern art’: At a time when there are fewer and fewer conventions sufficiently rigorously established so that to violate them is taboo, and when it is thus more and more difficult to innovate by breaking rules, the possibilities of change may well lie in junk and rubbish.12\n\nIndeed the key gesture of modern art, from Duchamp’s urinal (Fountain) to Tracy Emin’s unmade bed, is that it converts rubbish, often ordinary objects that have lost their original use value, into auratic and durable works of art that short-circuit hierarchies of value. ‘A transient piece of plumbing’, as Culler remarks of Duchamp’s urinal, ‘detached from its function, becomes rubbish, and thus available for sudden elevation into art.’13 As we ’ll see, this conversion of trash into treasure, as Kate Egan calls it, is at work too in cultists’ elevation of films regarded as so worthless that they are incomprehensible within conventional aesthetic frameworks.\n\nTRASH AND THE MOVIES In 1940 Orwell listed ‘Hollywood films’ among the characteristic and invariably unfortunate phenomena of mid-century modernity, along with ‘concentration-camps, rubber truncheons, Hitler, Stalin, bombs, aeroplanes … and political murder’.14 And indeed most cinema can be – and has been over the years – denigrated as worthless trash. I don’t just mean the way the word was casually used to describe schlocky, expensively cheap filmed equivalents of airport novels by Harold Robbins and Jacqueline Susann and the sexually\n\n17\n\n18\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\nexplicit epic spawn of Peyton Place (1957), such as Valley of the Dolls (1967), The Adventurers (1970) and The Betsy (1978). There is a deeper point involved here than reiteration of Sturgeon’s Law that 90 per cent of everything is crap. Trashiness can be regarded as an intrinsic quality of film, an unavoidable consequence of its Faustian pact with commerce and its historical ties to melodrama, comic books and the sub-literary, as well as the disposability enforced by its traditional weekly exhibition cycles; indeed, as Justin Smith pointed out to me, Film Studies is ‘broadly engaged in resisting the consumption patterns of popular cinema in practices of undue scrutiny and canon-formation’.15 You get a sense of that when it comes to literary adaptations: the assumption that film – too visual, too mindlessly literal – will always drag material down to its level, debauching it with accessibility and populism. Trashiness is one of the irredeemable characteristics of the big, vulgar and moneyed ‘art’ of the movies, not least because the apotheosis of cinema is in America, with its resistance to cultural hierarchies and democracy of sluttish energy. You might resist brash melodramas like The Devil’s Advocate (1996) and headache-inducing eye-candy like Transformers (2007), but they represent what cinema, and especially American cinema, can do better than any other art form: ‘the accidental forms of commercial poetry’, as Jeffrey Sconce calls it, and ‘the vertiginous surrealism that brought so many to the cinema in the first place’.16 The trashier the films, from this point of view, the truer they are to cinema’s historical purpose; really trashy films, such as exploitation films, are in a sense purer embodiments of cinema’s true essence. That is reason enough to discard literary conceptions of cinema and value it precisely for not being in thrall to good taste. Film canons are made by overturning what is regarded as trash. If we did not spend a good deal of time with bad films, then what passes for a film canon would never change. As J. Hoberman says, ‘many, if not most, of the films we admire were once dismissed as inconsequential trash’.17 Today’s masterpieces – like Peeping Tom – were yesterday’s trash, and yesterday’s masterpieces get forgotten or are reframed as middlebrow or kitsch. Cinephilia – the love of film as film – often advances through the making of revisionary lists hostile to conventional value judgments, from the surrealists’ lists of favourite films, to Andrew Sarris’s categories of American directors, to the endless lists of ‘best films’, ‘worst films’ and even ‘sickest films’ that populate film magazines and fan-sites, and polls such as Sight and Sound’s greatest films poll of critics that has been going since 1952. There is a sense of free for all in the matter of evaluating films. One of the pleasures of cinema is that high and low seem endlessly renegotiable, much more so than in literature, for example, where firewalls between genre entertainments and literary novels are surprisingly resilient. James Naremore, referring to film noir, says that: media critics have always defended certain types of ostensibly disreputable, formulaic thrillers by appealing to their moral ambiguity and their lack of bourgeois sentimentality or ‘high-mindedness’, and such a defense is valuable to the movie industry because it enhances the films’ crossover potential, allowing them to play at the higher end of the market.18\n\nThere are always new ways of describing even the trashiest films so that they suddenly click into place as auteur works, or as subversive realism. Film, of all the arts, is the\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e p h i l i a\n\none most deconstructive of bourgeois conceptions of value and established aesthetic hierarchies. We can trace the re-evaluation of trash historically, at any rate in relation to Hollywood. By the early 1960s auteur theory – which Robert Ray described as ‘in effect, an elaborate justification for cult films’ – was revising the entire history of American cinema.19 Disregarded and marginal films were lauded at the expense of the middlebrow films that made money and won Oscars. ‘The shock value of auteurist aesthetics’, Ray said, ‘depended on the existence of a gap between popular and critical tastes … . The disagreement … lay not only between the auteurists and the popular audience, but also between the auteurists and the critical establishment.’20 From American B movies and Poverty Row noirs and horror films, from Sam Fuller to Russ Meyer, what was once seen as the detritus of cinema became the object of critical approval and cult appreciation, often with a political edge. As Ernest Mathijs reminds us, in 1970s France left-wing reviewers in ‘Combat, Le Monde and Positif … champion aesthetically low-value films because they challenge taste’.21 The result was a collapse in the consensus as to what represented a good, serious, pleasurable American movie. Notions such as ‘highbrow’, ‘lowbrow’ and ‘middlebrow’ turned out to be increasingly hard to entertain. Wide gaps opened up between the mass audience and the minority of cultists and art-house devotees, and, in critical circles, between auteurists and mainstream critics. New and competing reception contexts, in Europe as well as the US, destabilised the status and meaning of films. A positive understanding of trash implies that trash has a certain authenticity absent in the highbrow and the mainstream. This lies behind the enthusiasms of critics like Ado Kyrou at the surrealist-influenced Positif, the cult criticism traced in detail by Greg Taylor in Artists in the Audience, Parker Tyler’s willing immersion in the camp trashiness of Hollywood’s commercial ‘hallucinations’, and the overturning of big serious cinema by what Manny Farber called ‘termite art’.22 By the early 1970s there was a considerable difference among critics as to whether, like Sarris, one revalued low art or, like Pauline Kael and the surrealists, one simply lapsed into vicarious enjoyment of it. As the conservative critic John Simon wrote, ‘Even some of the feeblest flicks can be pronounced movie-movies, glorified trash, pure Americana, pop art, silly but harmless fun, or whatever term is thought to vindicate one’s addiction best.’23 Sarris attacked the kind of critic who is fascinated by the vulgar spectacle of popular films but cannot bring himself to admit they are art: ‘He conceals his shame with such cultural mechanisms as pop, camp, and trivia, but … [his] intellectual guilt compels him to deny serious purpose and individual artistry to the mass spectacles he has been educated to despise.’24 For Kael, trash and trashiness, as a critical category and as a general quality of cinema, was essential to the vitality of American cinema because America itself was trashy. Trash for her certainly covers exploitation movies, like Wild in the Streets (1968), but more typically she uses the term to mean straightforward commercially inspired entertainment films, like The Thomas Crown Affair (1968) (‘trash undisguised’) and Morocco (1930) (‘great trash’), which were ‘never meant to be anymore than frivolous and trifling and entertaining’.25 A refined notion of art is ‘what America isn’t, and it’s especially what American movies are not’.26 It denoted energy, unpretentiousness, visual zip and pleasure in the undergrowth of American culture and the potency of cheap movies:\n\n19\n\n20\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\naudiences who have been forced to wade through the thick middle-class padding of more expensively made movies to get to the action enjoy the nose-thumbing at ‘good taste’ of cheap movies that stick to the raw materials. At some basic level they like the pictures to be cheaply done, they enjoy the crudeness; it’s a breather, a vacation from proper behaviour and good taste and required responses.27\n\nThis is trash imbued with positive, liberating connotations, whether you regard it as ripe for appropriation or as exciting on its own terms, though Kael was amused and irritated by the younger generation of critics treating trash as art. Gary Hentzi went so far as to argue that exploitation films embodied uniquely American virtues: Freedom, individualism, and inventiveness in the face of financial limitations – these timehonoured Yankee values are part and parcel of the schlock moviemaker’s creed, and the psychotronics pantheon offers innumerable examples of American ingenuity in action … . For these are above all low-budget movies, turned out by a kind of film industry underclass, who pride themselves on their ability to do without, and look on the privileges of their rich relatives with a mixture of envy and disdain. As a result, in their films we can see money – or rather the lack of it – and this fascinates us because of the way it exposes the conditions under which more successful Hollywood illusions are created … big-budget spectacles, whose astonishingly convincing special effects are matched only by the unsurpassed shallowness of their conception.28\n\nHere again is that sense of an essential trashiness in cinema itself, or rather that trash displays or releases those aspects of film – speed, immediacy, eroticism, fantasy, emotion, modernity – nurtured by American cinema and perfected by the lively commercialism of its ‘lowest’ products, which have no fear of what Farber called ‘the potential life, rudeness and outrageousness of a film’.29 British cinema – and its critical reception – has of course been uncomfortable with the trashiness of cinema. It is as if, in Britain, cinema needs to be rescued from itself, by alignment with the saving graces of literature and theatre. Kael spoke approvingly of ‘the generally tawdry movies [that] contributed to our national identity’.30 That is not, generally, how one would conceive of the role of British cinema. The movies, to adapt what Katharine Hepburn says about nature in The African Queen (1951), are what British cinema is here to rise above.\n\nCULT, TRASH AND PARACINEMA Trash has accrued a more useful and specific meaning in relation to film than just popular films or an emergent quality of all cinema. It means exploitation – sleazy, cheap and blatantly vulgar films, full of sex and violence, which are now objects of fandom and nostalgia for their transgression and tastelessness. If legitimate high culture feels exclusive to some people – and that often seems the whole point of high culture – then in the low culture of exploitation films they may find equal excitement, significance, liminal experiences and instructive shocks, with the added frisson that the films’ pleasures offend against the repressive conventions of middle-class taste. The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu said that,\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e p h i l i a\n\nA work of art has meaning and interest only for someone who possesses the cultural competence, that is, the code into which it is encoded … . A beholder who lacks the specific code feels lost in a chaos of sounds and rhythms, colours and lines, without rhyme or reason.31\n\nThat is a feeling that may be encouraged by contemporary high culture, insofar as such a thing still exists. Unlike low culture, some people may think, it is not meant for ‘people like us’, is meant in fact precisely to exclude them and bring home their inadequate cultural capital (‘knowledge ’, in Sarah Thornton’s words, ‘that is accumulated through upbringing and education which confers social status’).32 Trash culture, our culture, becomes, for cinephiles, an alternative to both high culture and the mainstream rather than merely their degraded Other, and we relish having the cultural competence to appreciate the kind of alienating trash, such as exploitation films, that others simply cannot stand or make worthwhile sense of. The sensibility that could embrace trash films was given impetus in the 1960s by the success of camp and pop art and the emergence of what Robert Ray called ‘the ironic audience ’, which had morphed into the cult audience by the end of the decade.33 This began with the dissolution of the homogeneous audience in the US in the early 1950s. The minority art-house crowd and the phenomena of the cult film and the cult star were manifestations of ‘the new widespread and growing audience awareness of alternative possibilities for the movies …. [They] discovered something that profoundly shook the industry: the Classic Hollywood movie was not the inviolable model for the commercial cinema.’34 According to Ray, the catalyst for irony was television, whose endless and indiscriminate recycling (Ray’s words) of the traditional codes and genres of the Hollywood film ensured that the audience, soon overfamiliar with these exhausted paradigms, acquired an ironic, ‘knowing’ distance from them; it became an unwitting participant in camp. An audience evolved of, in Umberto Eco’s phrase, instinctive semioticians, countercultural in taste as well as politics.35 Nirvana for the ironic audience came with cult movies. Cult films often share textual qualities but are chiefly defined by an enthusiastic following. Nowadays the term has expanded to include any low-budget movie which might appeal to a cult sensibility – a rather circular definition, in which the choices of a pre-existing taste, especially for trash, are more crucial than the qualities of any particular film. The key period of cult films was the early 1970s, the period of the midnight movie in the US, which can be dated from screenings to ironic audiences of Alejandro Jodorowsky’s ‘head film’ El Topo in New York in 1970. Cult films were on the one hand films of Hollywood’s Golden Age, often commercial successes like Casablanca (1942) as well as re-evaluated films like Freaks (1932) and Touch of Evil (1958) and on the other the products of the New Hollywood and the fusion of underground and exploitation cinema – 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Pink Flamingos (1972), Harold and Maude (1971) – which found an adoring audience among a countercultural crowd looking for mind-expanding experiences. Cult films are often prized for qualities that condemn them from a conventional perspective, such as their incompleteness, the vividness of their production backstories and their transgressive style and content.\n\n21\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\n22\n\nFilms began to be made which were essentially programmatic cult films, deliberately aimed at audiences attuned to the pleasures and bourgeois-baiting subversions of trash. Pioneered by underground film-makers, such as George and Michael Kuchar, Andy Warhol, Kenneth Anger and Jack Smith, trash became a deliberate countercultural aesthetic. It might be a gay intervention, as with the British director and film programmer, Antony Balch; or, as with Michael Reeves, who was not gay, it might exemplify a cinephile ’s desire to use a trash genre for personal expression, as Reeves does in Witchfinder General.36 By the 1970s ‘trash film’ had hardened into a recognisable category of deliberately trashy movies catering to cultists delighting in bad taste, violence, kitsch, camp and sexual explicitness. John Russell Taylor traced the forerunners of such trash films back not only to the camp side of the American underground but also to Roger Corman’s absurdist and self-parodying horror films, A Bucket of Blood (1959) and The Little Shop of Horrors (1960): ‘They occupy a terrain vague, not exactly commercial, not exactly underground, not exactly pornographic, but a bit of all. There is an element of defiance about them. Some films are trash by accident; these are trash by design.’37 The examples he cites are Kuchar and MacDowell’s Thundercrack! (1975), an epic hardcore underground film, and John Waters’s celebration of decadence, Female Trouble (1974). Since then the programmatic trash movie has flourished in Britain as well as the US as a category of ultra-low-budget Witchfinder General: countercultural exploitation\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e p h i l i a\n\nfilm production that pastiches and emulates exploitation in an attempt to reach a niche audience of gorehounds and other self-selecting trash fans. Most recent British examples are horror and SF comedies whose titles sum up their content and appeal, such as Pervirella (2002), Evil Aliens (2005), Lesbian Vampire Lovers (2009), Kill Keith and Strippers vs Werewolves. It is important, then, that trash cinema is neither simply a genre of film nor a dismissive blanket term for low-budget movies. Trash is a discursive category – like ‘video nasty’ and ‘torture porn’ – associated with a specific taste associated with the popularisation of camp since the 1960s and the emergence of a culture of cultism. This taste, while consonant with the critical re-evaluation of low cinema, was finessed mostly in fan culture, and, again, as my references here betray, it has chiefly been explored in relation to the US. Liking trash films of all kinds is caught up in an aggressive and punkish antiaesthetic, which Jeffrey Sconce, in a seminal article on trash, called paracinema – seemingly disparate subgenres as ‘bad film’, splatterpunk, ‘mondo’ films, sword and sandal epics, Elvis flicks, governmental hygiene films, Japanese monster movies, beach party musicals and just about every other historical manifestation of exploitation cinema from juvenile delinquency documentaries to soft core pornography.38\n\nIt is, according to Sconce, ‘an extremely elastic textual category … less a distinct group of films than a particular reading protocol, a counter-aesthetic turned subcultural sensibility devoted to all manner of cultural detritus’, in which ‘the explicit manifesto of paracinematic culture is to valorise all forms of cinematic “trash”, whether such films have been explicitly rejected or simply ignored by legitimate film culture.’39 Sconce points out, crucially, that paracinema is not only a discursive construct but a taste, a strategy as much as a checklist of weird movies and an unofficial, rather than academic or critical, form of resistance to the mainstream that ‘seeks to promote an alternative vision of cinematic art, aggressively attacking the established canon of quality cinema and questioning the legitimacy of reigning aesthetic discourses on movie art’.40 Paracinema is a way of disputing the categorisation of films into high and low and even inverting such categories; it is based on ironic reading strategies that, paradoxically, by appropriating and remediating the films, create ‘a hierarchy of “skilled” and “unskilled” audiences’.41 Since the 1970s this has been a key taste formation for cultists, especially lower middle-class young white men (like me, at any rate in my younger days), culturally insecure and keen to distance themselves expertly from the ‘feminised’ mainstream. Mikita Brottman came up with a complementary discursive label of ‘offensive film’ – an alternative taboo cinema – ‘trash cinema par excellence ’ – that links Blood Feast (1963), Cannibal Holocaust (1980) and Irreversible (2002) because they share an irredeemable quality of shock and body horror, strategies valuable to high and low alike.42 They are films not only ‘genuinely shunned from mainstream cinema’ but which ‘can be understood as symptoms of a nervous disorder, revealing themselves to be part of the unconscious of mainstream cinema and thereby the locus of all its anxieties, problems, and frightening neurotic taboos’.43 Trash is conceived as having a special, privileged relationship to cultural fears and repressions.\n\n23\n\n24\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\nJoan Hawkins too has pursued this idea, noting that ‘high culture trades on the same images, tropes, and themes that characterize low culture’, and traced the development of a taste for such films and crossovers: These films promise both affect and ‘something different’: they are films that defy the traditional genre labels by which we try to make sense of cinematic history and culture, films that seem to have a stake in both high and low art.44\n\nExploitation and trash are as distinct from Hollywood as art movies – and art movies may have, as Hawkins puts it, ‘high production values, European art film cachet, and enough sex and violence to thrill all but the most jaded horror fan’.45 Borrowing from the lexicon of auteurism, cult critics re-evaluate exploitation hacks, such as the prolific Spanish director Jess Franco, as warped auteurs: paracinema can be and has been revalued as film art by placing it in direct cultural proximity to films already deemed aesthetically (and legitimately) valuable. Again, this should remind us that trash film culture often resembles legitimate film culture, especially in its reliance on notions of film art and authorship.46\n\nTrash, because it is a product of taste choices as much as a coherent set of films, can therefore move abruptly up and down the cultural scale. Ernest Mathijs argues, with reference to the Belgian cult art-exploitation film, Daughters of Darkness (1971), that reception contexts are all important in determining whether a film is seen as trash, art or some confusion of the two (which often in itself makes for cult status): ‘trash’ has become a very different word in cinema studies. If it first referred to straightforward rubbish, it now carries a much more subtle and complex status … . It has come to signify a particular kind of film, characterized by its openness to different interpretations, much more than just a bad film.47\n\nA film’s cultural status and also what it means change over time and across reception contexts. As Mathijs says, ‘trash films seem, like sleepers, to stick around. But unlike canonized cinema, whose reception trajectory also covers long periods of time, the films’ reputations never seem to settle.’48 Indeed it is a cliché that highbrows will always prefer the lowbrow to the middlebrow, and a taste for trash is to some extent a paradoxically elite and rarefied taste for low over easy pleasures, a refusal of the popular popular – mainstream vanilla movies, in other words, especially those liked by, say, young girls and women (even those with significant cult fanbases such as the Twilight films). You might call it cultural slumming, but it is also a way, as Sontag emphasised, of being a dandy in mass culture by upturning and ironising cultural hierarchies, and promoting the credentials and knowledge of fans over those of official arbiters of cultural value. As Helen Merrick says, within ‘the realm of popular culture, fans are the true experts; they constitute a competing cultural elite, albeit one without official recognition and social power’.49 Susan Sontag wrote, in her classic article on camp, in which she emphasised the role of film in popularising\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e p h i l i a\n\ncamp: ‘The old fashioned dandy hated vulgarity. The new style dandy, the lover of Camp, appreciates vulgarity.’50 Since the 1960s, when Sontag was writing, this style of camp irony has become mainstream, standardised, and lost most of its subcultural (and gay) attitude and cachet – and thereby much of its subversiveness. It is still political, in a sense, because it denotes a refusal of mainstream taste, but, in relation to cult film audiences, it is arguably a kind of snobbish anti-snobbism. The oppositional character of trash appreciation often reproduces the practices of high cultural criticism and much of its exclusiveness and oneupmanship. According to Mark Jancovich, cult movie audiences are less an internally coherent ‘taste culture’ than a series of frequently … contradictory reading strategies that are defined by their sense of their difference to an equally incoherently imagined ‘normality’, a loose conglomeration of corporate power, lower middle class conformity and prudishness, academic elitism and political conspiracy.51\n\nThis book, like so many others that have flourished since the mass dissemination of camp since the 1960s, is the product of this popularisation of the taste for paracinema, bad films and the sub-cinematic. The uses that people make of trash will of course be determined by many competing factors, not only the usual ones of class, race, gender and sexuality, but also age, profession and nationality. (It is crucial to remember of course that what cultists get out of older trash films is unlikely to be the same as what the films’ original audiences did.) Sharp competitive distinctions exist between trash fans: between, for example, amateur enthusiasts, who often have a sense of prior ownership over the field, and aca-fans, who may be regarded as pretentious Johnny-comelatelys. For middle-class cultists like me, a taste for trash is not simply a recovery of the popular (a fantasy of low culture as much as the real thing), but an act of transgression and a means of creating an identity. This taste for the low at the expense of the middlebrow chimes with an international trend once described as a shift in middle-class taste ‘from snob to omnivore’. Richard Peterson and Roger Kern showed that in contemporary American contexts at any rate, those with high cultural capital are often ‘cultural omnivores’ who embrace the texts of low as well as high culture: elitist exclusion had been replaced by elitist inclusiveness.52 This middle-class culture, in which high and low are consumed with equal confidence, was pioneered by camp ironists such as the filmmaker John Waters: As a Baltimore teenager, my filmgoing habits were completely schizophrenic. I’d see four films in one day – maybe start off with Door to Door Maniac [1961] starring Johnny Cash, and then rush to the opening day matinee of The Exterminating Angel [1962]. After gobbling down a sandwich, I’d catch an evening screening of Hagbard and Signe [1967] at the most obscurely interesting art theater in town, the now-defunct 7-East, and then top it off with a late-night showing of something like Angel, Angel, Down We Go [1969].53\n\nNimble-footed scampering up and down the cultural scale is now the speciality of baby boomers, who value the films they loved as children, raise ephemera to the level of art and emotionally invest in and collect what aroused, entertained and distracted them in the past. In Oedipal revolt against earlier generations, these middle-class taste tourists are\n\n25\n\n26\n\nBRITISH TRASH CINEMA\n\nused to the shock of the new and to re-evaluating rubbish as art. Whether it is gallery art, comic books, rock music, old films or literary novels, the status-seeking middle-class omnivore is adept at negotiating the most unlikely boundaries between high and low: The market forces that swept through all the arts brought in their wake new aesthetic entrepreneurs who propounded avant-guardist theories that placed positive value on seeking new and ever more exotic modes of expression, but in the latter half of the twentieth century the candidates being championed for inclusion were so numerous and their aesthetic range so great that the old criteria of a single standard became stretched beyond the point of credibility.54\n\nIn relation to cult film, this taste for trash is often caricatured as a predominantly male taste, expressive of a cult identity that is contemptuous of ordinary tastes and people and which demonises an establishment of censors, feminists, taste makers, the self-righteous and snobs.55\n\nBRITISH CULT CINEMA Perhaps, then, with British trash cinema what we are really talking about is British cult movies. Well, not exactly. Not all cult films are trash, and not all trash is cult. Few ‘canonical’ British cult films are trash exploitation or ‘so bad they’re good’. And, though the field of British trash is very ‘culty’ indeed, few individual British trash films will ever be, or deserve to be, cult favourites. It was in the 1990s that a canon, and specifically a British canon, of British cult films emerged, distinct from the films included in Danny Peary’s Cult Movies trilogy, which summarised American cult preferences in the midnight-movie era.56 The canon is summarised in Your Face Here, a popular guide to British cult films published in 2002. As well as The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the films to which chapters are devoted include If…., Performance, A Clockwork Orange (1971), Get Carter, Quadrophenia (1979), Withnail and I and Trainspotting (1996), youth-orientated films with ‘tribal themes’ which celebrate outlaw masculinity in charismatic central performances.57 This is not a canon of trash films in the sense of sleazy exploitation movies (though some, such as The Wicker Man and Performance, were certainly considered trash by their own distributors), and only Rocky Horror is thoroughly imbued with a spirit of camp trashiness. Even those belonging to the horror and SF genres, such as Witchfinder General, The Wicker Man and A Clockwork Orange, tend to be auteur works celebrated as art and somewhat adrift from their generic location. Neither Witchfinder General nor The Wicker Man, for example, is a conventional horror movie; the former, a historical melodrama, has been likened to a Western, while the latter is a shaggy-dog police procedural with musical numbers. Indeed, the same is true of the British films in Peary’s 1980s trilogy, which include Zardoz (1974), A Clockwork Orange, The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976), The Red Shoes (1948), Peeping Tom and 2001. There is no mention of trash films, such as Devil Girl from Mars, Come Play with Me and Psychomania, whose cult certainly exists but remains comparatively under the radar. The key British cult films, discovered on TV and video in the 1980s and 1990s, are one-offs, auteur films and films with subcultural credentials, rather than particular trash movies.\n\nB r i t i s h Tr a s h C i n e p h i l i a\n\nYou will have noticed – and I am painfully aware of the fact – that my discussion of paracinema and the appearance of a cult sensibility has drawn mostly from American experience, where the history of cinephilia is much more developed and self-conscious. The emergence of a trash sensibility in Britain and the development of British cinephilia in criticism and film fandom have received comparatively unsystematic study.58 You can, however, tentatively sketch the rise of trash cinephilia in Britain – the auteurist recuperation of Fisher and Reeves by critics such as Robin Wood; Raymond Durgnat’s interest in trash and the national Unconscious; the influence of the gay coded magazine, Films and Filming and the ‘younger, queerer, countercultural aesthetic’ it shared with Antony Balch (one of a significan"
