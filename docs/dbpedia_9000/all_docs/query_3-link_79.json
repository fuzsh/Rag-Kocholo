        "text": "INSEMINOID tells the story of a crew of interplanetary archaeologists who are threatened when an alien creature impregnates one of their members causing her to develop a psychosis and mutilate her colleagues one by one. INSEMINOID was directed by British filmmaker Norman J. Warren, known primarily for a series of late ’70s-‘80s horror films, including SATAN’S SLAVE, PREY, BLOODY NEW YEAR and the like and produced by Richard Gordon known for a variety of films but specializing in horror movies such as THE HAUNTED STRANGLER, FIEND WITHOUT A FACE, CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, and DEVIL DOLL. Warren shot the film during May and June 1980, with a £1 million budget, half of which was financed by Hong Kong’s Shaw Brothers (their first investment in a British film).\n\nSide A:\n\n1: Main Title\n\n2: The Chrysalis\n\n3: Virus\n\n4: Death In Space\n\n5: The Creature Strikes\n\n6: The Insemination"
