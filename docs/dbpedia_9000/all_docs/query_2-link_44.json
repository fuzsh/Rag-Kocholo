        "text": "(Warner Bros. Home Entertainment provided me with a free copy of the blu-ray I reviewed in this Blog Post. The opinions I share are my own)\n\nSPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN!!\n\nYou may have read what I’m about to say in another review, or if you haven’t you’ll probably come across it one day. I always hate to repeat myself in reviews, but it tends to happen now and again, and it’s about to happen here, in our present, tonight . . . sorry, I suddenly felt the urge to channel part of that opening of The Terminator (1984), anyhow, yeah, I’m going to repeat myself — Movies have a myriad of sub-genres, anything you can think there’s a pretty good chance you can find at least one movie about it, some sub-genres are full of movies, others have a handful, and some have only one or two flicks, the ‘Alien Rapist’ sub-genre, to my knowledge, had only three films (Inseminoid, Xtro, Breeders) in its category—until now, that is. All three of them were made in the 80s, but when I came across this Snatchers flick a year ago I was genuinely surprised to see another addition. But unlike the three in the 80s that are straight horror this one is more comedy oriented, and a pretty good one at that. It was an email press release where I discovered it, and before I read the plot the title raised an eyebrow, it sounded very porn-ish, and for a minute I thought, perhaps, someone was sending me a link to their latest porn parody, the parody being of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, of course.\n\nThe basic plot isn’t so dissimilar from those three 80s flicks either, a human, female chick is attacked and raped by an alien ugly, the chick then gives birth to one or two alien uglies, which become immediately hostile to all other humans it/they encounter. Inseminoid and Xtro added their own wrinkles by either turning the mother(s) into the main villain (Inseminoid, Breeders) or the main alien ugly into the villain disguised for a time as a human (Xtro).All of them have various levels of special effects and gore as eye candy, and Snatchers is no different; I’ll get into those particulars in a moment, but Snatchers adds its own wrinkles first by using a “consensual rape” to impregnate the lead female character, seventeen year old, Sara (Mary Nepi). Wait, “consensual rape?” Is there such a thing? I suppose, if you’re into role playing, and sex games, with their “safe words” and all, and you have a rape fantasy, so, yeah, I guess that would constitute“consensual rape.” There’s a cycle the movie’s aliens have that wasn’t totally clear to me, the opening credits hint at it as we see Mayan artwork depicting their encounters with them, they seem to show a Mayan knocking up another Mayan, and that Mayan giving birth to aliens, which then mate and try to take over the world with offspring? This last part was never clear, but since I’m penning this before taking in the commentary I’m hoping all questions will be answered by the time I get to the end of this review.\n\nSara had a boyfriend, Skylar (Austin Fryberger), who went to Mexico, who’s now back, and very horny, doesn’t seem that odd, but when they have sex for the first time his orgasm appears incredibly painful, and perplexing, not just to me watching it, but also to Sara, so much so it stifles her orgasm and turns it into a “the-fuck-is-wrong-with-you moment.”\n\nAnd did he slap on a condom, no.\n\n. . . or pull out, no.\n\nThe next day Sara goes through a whiplash of mood swings during lunch, requisite puking, as one tends to do when they’ve been knocked up, and in twenty-four hours acquires a belly that appears to be suddenly nine months along. I’m going to go out on a limb and say that last part isn’t normal.\n\nSo, here’s how Sara got alien inseminated . . . Skylar went to a museum and got educated, well, as much as a dude named Skylar can get educated, about Mayan culture. He came upon this little statue of a Mayan with a hard dick, he accidentally broke that dick off and got hit in the face with this “powder,” or “gas,” and it’s this alien gas that inserted alien DNA into him, in turn making him hornier than normal, which resulted in that alien DNA shooting into Sara. It sounds very ‘Rube Goldberg machine,’ but it happened, and here we are. These aliens might want to take some advice from the ones in those 80s flicks, the direct approach is a lot simpler.\n\nSara had a really good friend once, one she grew up with, Hayley (Gabrielle Elyse), but she chucked her aside to be one of the popular girls, but now that she’s nine months inseminated she goes to her for help. This is part of the human drama of the movie, Sara and Hayley reconnecting and working out their shit to be better friends than ever, same goes for Sara and her mother, Kate (J.J. Nolan), she’s also another character Sara needs to work some shit out with. Concerning Kate, when she first appeared I thought this was an older sister, but she kept talking to her like a mother, which seemed implausible. Then later on we find out, yes, this indeed is her mother. I think they should have casted older, but later we find out Kate had Sara when she was seventeen, so that rounded off that implausibility I was feeling. All right, her youth makes sense now.\n\nThe monster FX and gore starts right at the point when Sara and Hayley hit the free clinic to see what doctors can do about it, and without warning Sara goes into labor, and a second without warning moment occurs when she blasts the alien so hard and fast out of her it literally decapitates the doctor!!!\n\nWell, that escalated quickly.\n\nSara will later refer to this death as her “vag-cannon” moment, and I agreed with that assessment wholeheartedly. She will also reason she cannot put anyone else in front of her “Vag-cannon” either once she realizes she’s got a second bun in the oven, but this “fraternal alien twin” is much, much worse. The first one is a foot long little bugger that likes to Robert Heinlein its victims by leaping onto the back of their necks and sticking its scorpion-like tale into their brainstems to control them. So you have this human walking around with its head hunched forward so the controlling alien can see where it’s going. The second alien she gives birth to is different, and gets larger, like size of a car larger, and is female. The cycle continues when the smaller male fucks the larger female one, but I was never sure exactly what she was supposed to give birth to, the “gas” that makes human males horny, or more aliens? She’s killed before her birthing process begins.\n\nI wasn’t totally in love with the alien designs, for they looked like something I might have seen on a Herculoids or a Thundar The Barbarian episode, something generic to an 80s toon is what I’m saying. I would’ve liked to have seen something more original, more “alien,” but according to the extra features they had a limited amount of money, so I can understand why the designs were “simple,” but the execution of the effects was really damn good looking. A mixture of CGI and practical effects were used, most seamless, since I assumed the final female alien confronted in the basement was a full practical effect, when in reality only the head was, the rest was CG. The foot long male when it wasn’t moving was practical, with moving eyebrows even. And when it was moving it became CG, but seamless CG.\n\nFor a brief moment I thought this was going to be a rare exercise in a monster movie ending without the required setup scene for a sequel you see in just about every film these days. The aliens are killed, the Earth is saved, and Sara is better friends with Hayley than she ever was, and on better terms with her Mom than she ever was too, and we even get a “THE END” appearing, something I haven’t seen in a film since the 80s. Well, holy hell, a movie with a beginning, a middle and end . . . then I remembered the penchant filmmakers also have for after credits scenes, and so I waited, and, son of a bitch, there it was, the after credits scene. I had forgotten all about Skylar even though he was rendered unconscious (with a hard on) on the floor of that house party, when he just couldn’t stop looking for someone else to fuck. He’s seen in the back of a car, bound and gagged, and being taken somewhere by what appeared to me to be federal agents. So, technically, the door is open for a sequel, and to be honest I liked what I saw, so I wouldn’t mind seeing another chapter of this movie.\n\nThe gore culminates at the siege on the police station with all but one cop ending up dead, there’s much blood and a couple of arms lose their owners, and an eye trauma moment (shiver) when the alien makes his “human steed” stab himself in the eye with a pen! Oh, God, I’m having a flashback to it now! Every time I see a movie that has a police station attacked by the film’s lone, unstoppable villain looking for the lead female holed up inside I always ask myself who’s The Terminator (1984) fan? That’s the flick that started that trend, and that was a surprising moment in James Cameron’s flick, because up until then characters were deemed safe when they went to a police station for help, but Cameron said, fuck that shit, and showed not even being in the presence of a bunch of cops can stop Evil. Snatchers police siege scene is exactly that, and have you noticed the lead female is also named Sara?\n\nI want to also point out the filmmakers also love Sam Raimi’s directing style, throughout the movie there are moments of sudden close-ups on characters and situations that had me thinking of Raimi’s Evil Dead movies. So, it would appear the filmmakers love some of the same movies I do. This is good. Very good.\n\nA few days have passed between this paragraph and the above one where I’ve had time to listen to the commentary with the directors and writers, and they revealed that statue Skylar broke the dick off of was molded from the meteor the aliens came to Earth in, something I didn’t get, but was evident in the paintings in the opening credits apparently. With this piece of crucial information I can now logically make better sense of the cycle now, and I’m guessing the aliens were inside this meteor as DNA and when it was fucked with gas came out and did what it did to Skylar, so one horny Mayan inseminated another, she gave birth to two fraternal twin aliens, they engaged in alien incest, and what she would have given birth to may have been more male snatchers? Do I have that right? So, had the aliens won we’d be a society of snatcher ridden steeds with a single Queen overseeing everything? That’s how I’m going to read it, until I hear differently.\n\nSnatchers started out as web series for mobile platforms with each episode clocking in at 8-minutes, but it never got past one season, so the filmmakers filmed the rest of it for consumption as a film, but none of this is mentioned in the commentary or in the extra features. I only got clued in to this when I hit-up IMDB to learn more about the movie and saw there were two entries for it, one being a “series,” that’s when I went in search of more info and found a couple of articles explaining it all.\n\nSo, there ya have it, my Snatchers review!\n\nNow go get snatched!\n\nThat sounds so dirty.\n\nOwn Snatchers Blu-Ray Combo Pack and DVD February 18 from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment!\n\nVIDEO/AUDIO/SUBTITLES: 1080p 2.39:1 high definition widescreen—5.1 English DTS-HD Master Audio, 2.0 French Dolby Digital, 2.0 Spanish Dolby Digital—English SDH, French, Spanish, Danish, Sweden, Finnish, Nordic subs\n\nEXTRAS INCLUDED . . ."
