        "text": "This page provides a quick reference to those who might wish to use Word 97 to build a web site. The simplest way to do this is to build the site on your local computer, then transfer it all to the university's web server when it's complete. Instructions on basic features of Word and on using and ftp program to transfer your site are included below.\n\nIntroduction to the Web\n\nThe Internet is a global network of computers.\n\nThe World Wide Web, which, for the past few years has been the most popular portion of the Internet, allows us to link documents with one another through hyperlinks, as well as to do more than just read text-we can look at pictures, run programs, \"chat\" with other people, etc.\n\nWe look at the web with Web Browsers, like Netscape or Microsoft's Internet Explorer. These browsers read programs written in a relatively simple computer language called Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML).\n\nComputers on the Web are identified by unique Universal Resource Locators (URL's), or addresses. For instance, our URL is\n\nhttp://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/PoliSci. When you publish your web site, you'll have your own URL. More details on this are located in the section on transferring your files. Until recently, if you wanted to construct a web site you had to learn HTML. Now, however, many specialized programs exist that use a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to that in Word or Word Perfect. In fact, both of these word processing programs have recently introduced innovations that allow you to use them to build HTML documents.\n\nWord 97 is integrated with the Web such that you can actually look at web documents from within the program. To get some idea of how this is done, click the button on the toolbar that looks like a globe with arrows going to and from it. You'll notice that this added another toolbar, and you'll also see the address of this document pops up as well.\n\nSome basic tips on designing web pages\n\nKeep it simple. Remember that even though you might think it looks cool to have a billion different spinning things or big, detailed pictures on your page, others are sitting in front of the computer impatiently waiting for the page to download. Also, remember that most folks who use the Internet don't have the benefit of our ethernet connections and relatively new computers.\n\nMake it easy to get to the important stuff. People don't like to have to scroll down a long page, or click through five different pages to get to what they're looking for. When possible, try to have links to what you think are the most important parts of your site as high up on the first page as possible.\n\nThink about color schemes and background images. Your background and text colors should be coordinated so that they're easy to read, and any background images you use should not interfere with the readability of the text.\n\nWhy are you doing it? If you're constructing the page just to have one, the novelty will wear off quickly (think pet rocks). If, however, you have some plans for how you want to use it (to make papers or data available to colleagues, to provide students with announcements about class or a central index of web sites relevant to the class), you're likely to be more interested in keeping it up to date in style and content.\n\nPlanning the web site\n\nSingle page with lots of links\n\nOpen first to simple page, expand from there:\n\nCraig Warkentin's site\n\nMike Baranowski's site\n\nColor Schemes: Backgrounds and text\n\nBy default, the background of documents is white and the text black. Similarly, hyperlinks are by default blue. You can change all of these fairly easily.\n\nBackground color: From the Format option on the menu, point to Background and do one of the following\n\nPick a color from the menu.\n\nMake custom colors by selecting \"more colors\" from the list of options.\n\nBackground Images: Select \"fill effects\" from the Background menu. From here to can pick from images that Word has on file, or browse to images of your own. I have a folder in my share file of background images, or you can go to\n\nhttp://www2.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/bg/backgrounds.htmlor http://the-tech.mit.edu/KPT/bgs.htmlto find more extravagant lists.\n\nText Color\n\nDefault colors: Select Format from the menu bar and go to \"Text Colors.\" Here you can set the default colors for regular text, hyperlinks, and hyperlinks you've already clicked on.\n\nAdding a little color to a sight is often helpful. If you want to vary from the default colors, it's pretty easy. On your toolbar you should see the letter A with a strip of color beneath it (by default, I think the color is black). If you click on the little arrow to the right, you'll be able to select from a variety of colors. If you select one and then type, your text will be in that color. Also, you can highlight existing text and change the color simply by selecting from the menu of colors.\n\nRemember: Your background and text colors should complement one another. They should be attractive, of course, but most importantly, your text must always be readable. Discard any backgrounds that get in the way of clarity, or try various combinations of colors until you find one that works.\n\nImages\n\nPerhaps the most popular feature of the Web is the ability to view images. In Word you can insert a picture from the Insert Menu, choosing either Word's clip art, or a picture of your own. I have a folder in my share file of pictures for you to practice with.\n\nAfter you insert an image, you should size it to your desires by clicking once on it with your mouse, then pulling or pushing on it until it's the size you want (remember that, generally, larger images take longer to load), and make sure that it aligns with text as you wish by right clicking on the image, choosing \"format picture\" and choosing the alignment you want and making sure that the text gets no closer to your picture than you desire.\n\nCreating Links\n\nThe real advantage of the web is the ability to jump from document to document with the click of a mouse. The things you click on that let you do this are called hyperlinks, and you have to insert them in your documents. After typing in the text or inserting the picture you wish to serve as the link, highlight it, go to the Insert Menu, select hyperlink and either browse to the file or type in the URL.\n\nYou can also create links to different parts within the same document (like the links in the menu at the top of this page). To do this, you first have to insert a bookmark in the place you wish to be able to jump to by placing your cursor where you want the bookmark to be, selecting Bookmark from the Insert menu, and typing the name you wish to call it. Then when you want a link to refer to it, select it from the options given in the blank labeled \"Named Location in File.\"\n\nCreating Lists\n\nWhy would you want to create a list?\n\nThey allow you to format information so it's easily readable.\n\nThey look nice.\n\nBecause you can.\n\nLists in Word are created through using the Bullets and Numbering options in the Format menu. You can create either ordered (numbered) lists, like this outline, or unordered (bulleted) lists, like the short one immediately above. The Bullets in the list are actually pictures, so Word copies the picture file it uses to the same directory in which your document is located.\n\nCreating Tables\n\nThere may be many occasions in which you want to construct tables. Many web pages today use them, including our\n\nhomepage, which essentially consists of a table of three columns and one row. To make simple tables with uniform rows and columns, you can point to the Table menu. When you click on Insert Table, you'll notice that you can just highlight the size table you want. Word will then insert it into the document.\n\nOther times, however, you may wish for a table with a somewhat odd configuration: where cells have rows or columns within them but not within other cells, for example, or, like below, where the top row has one column that stretches the width of the entire table, but the bottom one is split into three columns. The easiest way to do this is to draw your own table, which is an option on the Table menu.\n\nGetting your files to the Web server\n\nIn order to Start the FTP program located under Programs--Exceed in your Start menu.\n\nThe window that appears will be pointing you toward files on the C drive; change the drives and browse through the directories as necessary so that you're looking at the directory in which you've stored your web site.\n\nUnder the Connection menu, choose Open. Under server name type:\n\nwww.uky.edu\n\nEnter your userID and password\n\nUnder initial directory type:\n\n/usr/local/www/htdocs/ArtsSciences/PoliSci/Yourlastname\n\n***Remember that this is case sensitive, so you must type it in exactly as it appears here. Be sure to capitalize the first letter of your last name***\n\nCreate directories under your directory on the web server such that it mirrors the site you have set up on your local machine. To do this make sure that the active window is the one for the remote terminal (the web server), and choose Create Directory from the File Menu. Type in the name of the new directory and hit enter.\n\nOnce the directory structure on the web server mirrors the one you've created locally, you can begin to transfer files by dragging them from the local drive to the web server. The easiest way to do this is to first ftp all files in your root directory, then open subdirectory A on the local drive and the web server and ftp the files. Do the same for each subdirectory you may have.\n\nCheck whether everything's transferred OK by pointing Netscape toward\n\nhttp://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/PoliSci/Yourlastname\n\nWhen you need to update a page, simply ftp it again. The ftp program should ask whether you want to replace the old file. When you say 'yes', your page will be updated."
