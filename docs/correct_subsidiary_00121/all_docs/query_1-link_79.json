        "text": "NASA Web Site Privacy Policy and Important Notices\n\nThank you for visiting NASA and reviewing our policy notices. We have integrated these statements into a single posting for ease of use.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThis notice provides NASA's policy regarding the nature, purpose, use and sharing of any information collected via this Web site. The information you provide on a NASA Web site will be used only for its intended purpose. We will protect your information consistent with the principles of the Privacy Act, the e-Government act of 2002, the Federal Records Act, and as applicable, the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nSubmitting information is strictly voluntary. By doing so, you are giving NASA your permission to use the information for the intended purpose. If you do not want to give NASA permission to use your information, simply do not provide it. However, not providing certain information may result in NASA's inability to provide you with the information or services you desire.\n\nThere are several types of information we collect. These include:\n\nAutomatically Collected Information\n\nPersonal Information\n\nInformation from Children\n\nNASA never collects information for commercial marketing. We will only share your information with another government agency if it relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. NASA never creates individual profiles or gives your information to any private organization.\n\nAutomatically Collected Information\n\nWe collect and temporarily store certain technical information about your visit for use in site management and security purposes. This information includes:\n\nThe Internet domain from which you access our Web site (for example, \"xcompany.com\" if you use a private Internet access account, or \"yourschool.edu\" if you connect from an educational domain);\n\nThe IP address (a unique number for each computer connected to the Internet) from which you access our Web site;\n\nThe type of browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) used to access our site;\n\nThe operating system (Windows, Unix) used to access our site;\n\nThe date and time you access our site;\n\nThe URLs of the pages you visit;\n\nYour username, if it was used to log in to the Web site; and\n\nIf you visited this NASA Web site from another Web site, the URL of the forwarding site.\n\nThis information is only used to help us make our site more useful for you. With this data we learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use.\n\nExcept for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are retained temporarily as required for security and site management purposes only.\n\nPersonal Information\n\nIf you choose to provide us with personal information, through such methods as completing a form or sending us an email, we will use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information or services you have requested.\n\nRemember that email isn't necessarily secure. You should never send sensitive or personal information like your Social Security number in an email. Use postal mail or secure Web sites instead.\n\nSome of our Web sites ask visitors who request specific information to fill out a registration form. For example, vendors looking for marketing opportunities by visiting our NASA Acquisition Internet Service site may be asked to register to obtain email notices of business opportunities. Other information collected at Web sites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means, enables us to determine visitors' interests, with the goal of providing better service to our customers.\n\nInteraction with Children\n\nThe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathering online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child's parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under the age of 13.\n\nWe collect no information about you or your child, other than that detailed in the previous section, when you visit our web site unless you choose to provide information to us. When a NASA Web site needs to collect information about a child under 13 years old, COPPA required information and instructions will be provided by the specific Web page that collects information about the child. The Web page will specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept.\n\nThere are several exceptions that permit collection of a child's email address without receiving parental consent in advance:\n\nTo provide the parents with notice and to seek consent for communications with the child. Note: this may require collection of the parent's email address as well.\n\nTo respond to a one time request from a child.\n\nTo respond more than once to a child's request; i.e., subscription to a newsletter. However, parental consent is required prior to the second communication.\n\nTo protect the safety of a child who is participating on the site; i.e., in a chat room.\n\nTo protect the site or to respond to law enforcement; i.e., in the case of a Web site compromise.\n\nPersonal information about children under 13 years of age may be needed to respond to his/her communication to us, such as to receive a poster or to acquire information for a school project. Personal information about your child will be destroyed immediately upon completion of its intended purpose. On rare occasions, it may be determined that a communication from a child under 13 years old should be maintained for historical purposes. Should such an occasion occur, NASA will obtain the necessary consent from the child's parent.\n\nFinally, we provide many on-line tools and services in support of NASA's mission. A child under 13 years old may inadvertently provide personal information to one of these services. If this should happen, the information about the child will be deleted immediately upon discovery.\n\nWeb Site Security Notice\n\nFor site security purposes and to ensure that this Web service remains available to all users, this Government computer system employs software programs that monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information,. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to appropriate law enforcement officials.\n\nUnauthorized attempts to upload or change information on NASA servers are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law, including under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.\n\nAccessibility Statement\n\nWe continually strive to ensure the pages on this Web site are accessible to individuals with disabilities in accordance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. If you have any difficulty viewing any page with adaptive technology, please contact the webmaster for this site or the Center Section 508 Coordinator.\n\nDocuments on NASA Web sites are presented in many formats. These formats are generally accessible to users using screen reading software. Some files on this Web site may be posted as Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF) files. Adobe provides their Acrobat Reader software as a free download.\n\nLinking Policy and Disclaimer of Endorsement\n\nNASA links to many Web sites created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations. NASA provides links to these sites as a service to our users. The presence of a link is not a NASA endorsement of the site.\n\nWhen users follow a link to an outside Web site, they are leaving NASA and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the outside Web site(s). NASA is not responsible for the information collection practices of non-NASA sites.\n\nDate of Publication: December 2005"
