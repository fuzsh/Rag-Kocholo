Nevertheless, the r \\3 information superhighway is a reality as well as an ^ incredible phenomenon, and | it is changing the way we think, communicate, and approach our lives. But, how do you get on board the deified digital interstate, with its strange new chariots and alarmingly insular language? How to visit those stunningly beautiful sites people keep raving about, or tap into all the free software rumored to be out there, floating, waiting to be accessed? Until now, no publication has attempted to take you by the hand and show you — step by step — how to get online in the easiest, most painless, and most efficient way. At The Net, our goal is to teach you how to converse with others around the world while you learn to trek in the heady atmosphere of cyberspace. You will also be kept up to date with the rapid changes under way on the information superhighway — because (r)evolutions do occur every day. This is our promise to you. We'll underscore it with a stunning visual style and flare that will make the Internet come alive for you. Whether you're an experienced infobahn traveler or a frustrated but enthusiastic newbie, The Net is going to take you places you've never dreamed of visiting. So, arm yourself with some hardware, some software, a six-pack of Diet Coke (not a pre- requisite, whatever beverage you prefer), and a copy of The Net — and let's get started.

California Today, the World Tomorrow? he Internet is expected to serve as a hub for tens of millions to electronically buy and sell products and services. But how soon will this happen? The Net has the inside scoop ... It's the usual chicken or egg conundrum. Marketers are salivating over the software and hardware that compose the Internet and commercial online services, expecting both an exponential jump in sales and a new umbilical cord to consumers. Still, online commerce remains more virtual than actual reality. (The Wall Street Journal , for instance, reports that only 120,000 of Prodigy's 2 million subscribers bought airline tickets via the online service in 1994.) Whether that's because businesses are only beginning to jump onto the information superhighway or because only 6% of U.S. households subscribe to online services is hard to call. But businesses seeking to set up shop on the Internet are already being targeted by telecommunications companies. In California, Pacific Bell is phasing in dedicated Internet access services to big businesses located in the San Francisco Bay, greater Los Angeles and • Business Outlook: RHI Consulting asked 1,000 CFOs of companies with more than 20 employees to predict how U.S. firms will use the Internet. The results: sales and marketing, 46%; customer support and communications, 36%; research, 6%; other/don't know, 12%. • GenX Effect: Computer products and channels will become a S70 billion market by 1997, predicts the Multimedia Research Group. The jump will be fueled by 18- to 24-year-olds, whose buying power is pegged at $125 billion. Orange County, San Diego, and Sacramento areas. Pacific Bell's full range of services is intended to provide a one- stop Internet access system. Partners in the project are Brand-Name Electronic Shopping MCI's marketplaceMCI is described as the first brand-name secure electronic shopping area. Storefronts include Dun & Bradstreet Information Services, Flammacher Schlemmer & Company, OfficeMax, Intercontinental Florist, Damark International, PC Zone and Mac Zone, Reiter's Scientific & Professional Books, QUALCOMM Incorporated, Proxima, Reveal Computer Products, Covey, Doneckers, FTP Software, National Wildlife Galleries (Art Access), Aetna, Amtrak, Borders Books and Music, Healthrider, Sara Lee, Tiger Direct, and Timberland. MCI is using Netscape's browser software and Netsite servers, as well as FTP Software's Internet software, to create marketplaceMCI services. To shop, Internet users log in to MCI's home page (http://www.internetMCI.com) and have their credit cards verified, then they can point and click on marketplaceMCI (http://www.marketplace. internetMCI.com/ marketplace). Users can browse the merchant fronts for product information, graphic images, and pricing. Any browser software can be used to access marketplaceMCI, but secure transactions reguire software compatible with Netscape's Secure Socket Layer encryption protocol (see article to the right). Netscape Communications, Sun Microsystems, and Cisco Systems. Sun and Cisco are providing a full line of routers and Internet-ready server hardware, while Netscape is supplying its Navigator software package. Sun is also providing firewall security software, and Sun workstations and servers are part of Pacific Bell's Internet services network and operations infrastructure. Noting that \"the Internet is rapidly becoming the data equivalent of basic telephone service,\" Pacific Bell President and CEO Dave Dorman says the company is attempting to make the Internet \"as easy to use and as widely accessible as the telephone.\" In the fourth quarter of 1995, Pacific Bell plans to offer switched access service to small businesses and residential customers in the same four areas of the state. By 1996, it will provide dedicated and switched access for other service areas. California is probably the best market for such services at the moment. The state accounts for one of every four commercial domains in the U.S., has three times as many connections as any other state, and is home to 10 of the 25 U.S. cities with the highest concentration of Internet-connected companies, says Internet Info, a market research and analysis firm. Pacific Bell is hooking up to the Internet businesses in cities up and down the coast of California. Battle Over Online Security Heats Up As with everything related to computers and information technology, competition rages over security data systems. No system has yet emerged as the industry standard — an important issue, since interoperability will advance the cause of electronic commerce on the Internet. Netscape has published both the specification for its security encryption service, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, and the source code to the reference implementation on the Internet. Eighteen companies, including Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Silicon Graphics, Prodigy, and Sun Microsystems, are supporting SSL. However, Terisa Systems — a joint venture of Enterprise Integration Technologies and RSA Data Security — is touting a rival standard, known as Secure HTTP. Testers of early versions of Secure HTTP include CommerceNet, Spry (recently purchased by CompuServe, see page 6), and Open Market, a company that helps merchants get an online presence. Although critics have argued that Netscape should have waited for the software industry to create some standards before it widely released SSL, the matter may be moot. SSL and Secure HTTP are being evaluated by the World Wide Web Consortium and the Internet Engineering Task Force, and it is possible that both will be adopted. D D ^ premiere issue 1995 Gateways NEWS ABOUT COMMERCIAL ONLINE SERVICES CompuServe Serves Up Internet Access With Internet curiosity surging as the World Wide Web emerges as a medium with appeal for businesses and consumers, commercial online companies increasingly are viewing Internet access as a must. Although it has been a slow transition for firms like H&R Block Inc.'s CompuServe to move from e-mail to FTP to Telnet, the pace is quickening as the race for cyberspace explodes. CompuServe, which had been lagging behind its competition, has gained a more solid foothold via the acquisition of Seattle-based Spry for about $100 million in stock and cash. Privately held Spry makes user-friendly software, including its popular Internet in a Box (see review, page 72), for entering and browsing the Web. Commenting on the deal, Ozzie Wenich, H&R Block's vice president of finance, noted that Spry will bring CompuServe \"the expertise that will help us become a significant player in the Internet industry.\" In addition to Web browsing capabilities, CompuServe will offer separate telephone connections for full Internet access. CompuServe expects Internet software, access, and consulting services to grow into a $4 billion industry in two years. Prodigy Was First Prodigy, a partnership of IBM and Sears, was long seen as the least aggressive of the commercial services, but it was the first to provide Web access with a graphical interface. More than 200.000 users signed up for this service within two weeks after Prodigy made it available. AOL Isn't Left Behind Meanwhile, America Online has acquired BookLink Technologies, another developer of World Wide Web software, in an attempt to integrate a browser into its services. AOL's rapid growth over the last year, and expectations that it will double its subscriber base this year, have also led the company to acquire the commercial arm of Advanced Network & Services. This acquisition is tantamount to the purchase of a major chunk of the Internet, since ANS operates one of the largest and fastest public networks (it controls more than 12.000 miles of leased fiber-optic circuits), and has been referred to as the backbone of the Internet. (continued on facing page...) Trying to Spur Online Transactions A number of business giants are working feverishly to ensure that consumers' technophobia and electronic commerce security fears are allayed. MasterCard recently set up a home page on the Internet's World Wide Web (http://www.mastercard.com) that not only includes information on what to do if your credit card is lost or stolen and where to find ATMs around the world but also has a WebMaster section to help newcomers learn how to use the Web and navigate the Internet. It contains a history of the Web, a tour of Web sites, and a tutorial on performing online searches and downloading files. A key goal of the page is to help users learn about cybermalls, where they can now shop using MasterCard. The credit- card company is working with Netscape to ensure secure electronic transactions on the Internet. Visa, which has had a Web home page since September 1994, recently added 59 pages of automated ATM site information that is updated monthly. Visa's page also includes information on its portfolio of products. Visa is working with Spyglass on a secure transaction system. Meanwhile, as part of its effort to put a personal computer in every U.S. home — and attract subscribers to its online service (see page 7) — Microsoft is producing the Home and Family Computing Supershow, a traveling event designed to \"teach the latest in computer and consumer technology products and services.\" Consumers attending the show will be able to test products, query manufacturers, view about 8,000 CD-ROM titles, and surf the Internet. The Supershow will feature pavilions entitled \"Internet and Online Services\" and \"E-Mail to the Rich and Famous,\" plus a computer games area and a learning center. Microsoft is teaming up with Multi-Media Publishing Corp. for the four 1995 events (Boston, Oct. 6-8; Atlanta, Oct. 20-22; Dallas, Dec. 8- 10; and San Francisco, Dec. 15-17). One of WebMaster's goals is to help Internet users learn about cybermalls. Omni's Internet Faith Not satisfied with an online version, Omni abandons print for a feet-first plunge into the cyberfuture. The growing interest in electronic commerce can be charted by the new ventures related to writing about it. Recently, PC World announced that it would co-publish with Forbes a special section, \"Electronic Commerce,\" about new developments in electronic banking and commerce. Notably, the publication will be in print form. PC World's publisher, Richard J. Marino, notes that the magazine still believes that \"the most effective way to deliver new editorial content to readership audiences is in the context of traditional environments that they are already comfortable with.\" This contrasts sharply with the beliefs of General Media, which has taken the radical step of suspending a print version of its Omni magazine and transporting it into cyberspace. Omni will shore up its established beachhead on America Online with a World Wide Web site and services on other networks. The only vestige of a print-format Omni will be a jumbo quarterly issue available at newsstands (not by subscription). Omni's change in medium is not the desperate gamble of a foundering company: It has a circulation of 700,000 and a rising number of ad pages. Rather, Omni is underscoring its reputation as a \"tool for the 21st century,\" says Keith Ferrell, vice president and editor. \"Anticipating the future and its new technologies is what Omni is all about,\" Ferrell adds. Also not lost on Ferrell is the fact that students make up a large proportion of Omni's circulation, and they are much more likely to accept, and know how to use, a digital medium for their reading material. Many magazines have begun publishing online versions — the pioneer is Wired , and Time has also gotten into the act, as have Business Week (available through America Online), and Aviation Week & Space Technology (online on CompuServe). However, a key difference from the Omni project is that these sites basically serve to complement their print counterparts. premiere issue 1995 O D £ ($X$£&taDg)g Freedom, Privacy, and the Internet Flying Online It's getting harder and harder to slip unobtrusively from the office, even on a plane ride. Now flyers can go online: In-Flight Phone Corp. is establishing a local area network for aircraft with its FlightLink II digital system. The product of six years of labor and a $200 million investment, FlightLink permits airline passengers to send faxes and hook up to the Internet and online services. Five U.S. airlines plan to install the system on about 900 planes. Already, more than 60 USAir planes have it. The fifth annual Computers, Freedom, and Privacy (CFP) conference, which took place in Burlingame, CA March 28-31, focused on the uses of the Internet and computer database networks as both intellectual and potential terrorist tools. Topics included privacy and intelligent transportation systems; minority and international Internet accessibility issues; censorship; intellectual property rights; electronic cash; and anonymous remailers. Cryptography was among the most highly debated subjects, with attendees largely favoring absolute freedom. By contrast, intellectual property was less hotly contested — copyright protection appeared to have the support of most of those in attendance. Instead, discussion focused on the subtler points of enforcement and the role of the courts. The CD-ROM version of Sci-fi author William Gibson, considered the founder of cyberpunk ideology, is entering his once-make-believe wired community. On May 18, he will participate in an online press conference promoting adaptations of his 1980 story, \"Johnny Mnemonic,\" about a young data courier. Gibson has recast the story as a full-length feature film for TriStar Pictures, and it is also appearing as a CD- ROM game created by Sony Imagesoft for PCs, Macs, and Sega. The game will have real-time fight scenes and the electronic gadgets Gibson is famous for — videophones and neurocomputers — to allow players to interact in a futuristic Gibson society. Gibson's conference takes place from 6 to 7 p.m. (PST) on ZiffNet and CompuServe, and again from 7 to 8 p.m. (PST) on America Online and HotWired. Virtual Wars omark Software is W stepping up the pace in the online gaming world with its latest product, Confirmed Kill, a World War II flight combat game. Initially, the Telnet site for this game supported 375 players, but that number will be at 500 as of June. While this sort of interaction has a truly violent edge, there is something awe inspiring about the notion of hundreds of customized virtual planes flying through a simulated wild blue yonder. And don't worry about those practiced aces dropping every newcomer out of the skies: Domark plans on maintaining different arenas for different skill levels. Virtual Trees Earthday's 25th Anniversary on the Internet This year, the Internet was a But for those who missed key participant in the events all the fun, ArtRock Gallery is marking the April 22 Earthday celebration. Virtual Earthday was overseen by the Earthday Network, which for the last year has extended technical support, advised interested individuals and groups about how to get involved virtually, and planned several national events. Nearly all the major online service providers held special forums to discuss the issues; among featured guests were such eco-celebrities as Carol Browner, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and Steve Manning of The Nature Company. running an online auction of Rock Star memorabilia through May 21 (http://www. ccurrents.com/cc/). Proceeds will benefit activities addressing urgent local and global issues surrounding water and air pollution, toxic waste, and damage to ecological systems. The Rolling Stones, John Lee Hooker, Metallica, Suzanne Vega, and Soundgarden are just a few of the artists donating autographs to the cause. If you want to get a jump on Earthday 1996, you can reach the Earthday Network at earthday@ qualcomm.com. Although Prodigy may have gotten the jump on AOL in being the first to offer Web service, AOL's recent acquisitions will give it an edge in connectivity that will likely pay off big time. Delphi Reorganizes for Internet- Based Platform Delphi has reorganized in preparation for launching an open, Internet-based platform this year. Mark Benerofe, formerly director of interactive media for Microsoft, now leads Delphi's consumer services development, responsible for overseeing the acquisition and development and placement of content on the online service. Content will include products and services from News Corporation (Delphi's Rupert Murdoch-owned global media parent) and from other media sources. Benerofe played a role in developing the Microsoft Network (see below). Reporting to Benerofe will be Bruce W. Thurlby, newly appointed vice president, business affairs for Delphi. Thurlby previously was the new product development director for AT&T's Interchange, and the director and manager of editorial business and operations for Prodigy. Delphi recently signed a licensing agreement with Netscape for use of its Web software suite, after abandoning plans to come up with its own Web interface. David & Goliath To say that competition among the commercial online services will heat up even more later this year is something of an understatement, considering that Microsoft is at work on an Internet access system. Most of the major hardware and software vendors currently found on CompuServe will also be on the Microsoft Network. Because the communications software to access this network will be included with the company's Windows 95 operating system, the network is expected to rapidly gain subscribers. Microsoft apparently is bent on starting its own electronic news service as part of the Microsoft Network. The plans created an uproar when they were revealed by a new hire who was chatting in a private discussion group for journalists on the Internet, New Information Technologies. Immediately, a wave of furious questions was unleashed in the group, as journalists expressed concern that Microsoft might distort or omit news. Microsoft has licensed Spyglass's Mosaic Web browser, and plans to customize it for the Microsoft Network. Another giant is also apparent on the horizon: AT&T's Interchange. O O 7 premiere issue 1995 R30§[fc Making Contacts and Connections Online THE WONDERS OF THE WEB The Web turns users into active information gatherers and creators. <L _Q £ Qj O Qj aybe new technological revolutions are only meant to come around every 400 hundred years or so, but it seems we are the lucky ones: We find ourselves on the brink of a transformative change. A transformation this great hasn't been seen since the invention of movable type, which made possible the production of multiple copies of text- and graphic-laden paper, and spawned an explosion in knowledge that continues, unchecked, today. Yet content limitations, as well as the need to physically move paper from its site of creation to the end user, have constrained the ultimate capabilities of print publishing. Today, though, the World Wide Web is transcending print's restrictions and at the same time, breaking the boundaries of nation, culture, time, and space.

The way the Web links together documents results in remarkably creative opportunities for the user to discover, interact with, and create knowledge. The Web operates according to a popular model for networked communication — the client/server model. A server is a computer host and its associated software; when it's made publicly accessible, it serves as a \"broadcast\" station that provides access to information and resources contained in its online files. Those interested in accessing information found on Web servers use client software (called Web browsers). There are a variety of Web browsers, all of which communicate with the myriad of Web servers worldwide using a standard set of rules. This allows you to use different browsers to view the same information on Web servers, much as you use different television sets to watch the same program on TV. The Web certainly isn't the much-hyped 500 channels of television, nor is it an orderly -W VV( Hypertext Documents on the World Wide Web have author- defined features called links, or hotspots.

Rather, it's a new medium born from the need of researchers to organize and associatively link related information. Using the Web, you can do everything from accessing White House documents to checking Southwest Airlines' latest flight and fare information, discovering little-known facts about the San Jose Sharks, and planning your summer rafting trip. You could also use the Web to gamble without having to go to Vegas, track your Federal Express package without ever lifting the phone, or order the latest games without leaving your keyboard. You'll find information on the Web about beekeeping, Fermilab, genealogy, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, horror movies, mood disorders, motorcycling, pet rabbits, sumo wrestling, vegetarianism, and world oceans. The list is endless. You'll also \"bump\" into a myriad of other users: mainstream and fringe culture folks, corporations looking for your dollars, and university researchers intent on answering their thesis questions. There is no shortage of Web sites to choose from. Every day marks the debut of yet more Web pages, with everyone from the White House to Metro Goldwyn Mayer, the Krema Nut Company, and Miller Brewing Company getting in on the action. But organizations and institutions aren't the only ones providing Web offerings. Individuals are creating home pages that offer personal information. Groups of people are collaborating to create interlinked trees and webs of information about nearly every subject of human interest around. And, as more sites pop up on the Web, more users are drawn to explore the resources, and many of them in turn are inspired to become information creators. The Web is thus weaving the global communication network many utopian thinkers have dreamt about. As the Web grows, it increases in value, and as its value increases, it grows. j/^ S<ee World Wide Web More information about the Internet's “killer application\" can be found on pages 22 and 54- 55 of The Net.

I imagine by now you've heard I about the recent I ^ spate of computer crimes. Let's see. There was the February arrest of Kevin Mitnick, a fugitive computer programmer, for allegedly stealing at least 20,000 credit-card numbers from the computer files of Internet access service provider Netcom. Then, there was the electronic terrorism vandals visited upon journalists Michelle Slatalla and Josh Quittner.

Also, although government reports cited about 2,400 break-ins in 1994, keep in mind that commercial online services added more than 2 million users (at least) to the system that year. When you consider the fact that the number of people on the Internet has increased at a dramatically higher rate than the number of trespasses, the computer crime wave looks a bit more like swells lapping against the beach. We should also remember that any . . \"bombing\" of Quittner's Internet mailbox — it was stuffed with thousands of unwanted messages until his Internet access was shut down. Other journalists who've written about the Internet have also been targeted. Michael Wolff, author of NetChat, booted up to find that his e-mail messages had been removed by someone using a hacker program. In addition, there've been other problems, such as sexual harassment via e-mail. Taken together, these happenings could evoke a vision of cyberspace as a lawless frontier. But I urge you to put the risks in perspective and exercise a few simple precautions. The potential for security breaches is a bit less alarming than it first appears. It's true that, as recent magazine and newspaper headlines have been trumpeting, system break-ins doubled between 1993 This list of Frequently Asked Questions about firewalls provides information about how to protect computers from being tampered with. ■L activity exposing us to Breaking into computers is like stealing cars: IF a pro wants your car, no alarm, lock, or club is going to stop nim or her.

Breaking into computers is like stealing cars: If a pro wants your car, no alarm, lock, or club is going to stop him or her. However, as any police officer will tell you, 99% of car thieves are amateurs. They get into your car because you left the keys in the ignition or didn't lock the door. The same is true of computer systems. I cannot count the number of networks I've serviced whose operators hadn't bothered to set the supervisor password. These same people who are lax in enforcing security on their systems are now talking to me about hooking their in-house networks up to the Internet. So, it's not hard to predict that there are going to be a lot of carjackings along the information superhighway, especially after Uil jUJ rut nil t unn mis You travel at the speed waking bats who dangle in your way.

Security information resides in many places on the World Wide Web. You'll find software, Frequently Asked Questions lists, and lists of consultants. learning the results of a recent survey by consulting firm Ernst & Young and Information Week magazine. It found that only 22% of the respondents considered computer security \"extremely important.\" If this describes you or your company, you may want to rethink your priorities. If you're worried about online thieves making off with your credit-card number, remember that the best way to prevent that is to avoid putting the number on the Internet in the first place. Most of us have become considerably more wary about providing card numbers over the phone, and that same healthy suspicion should be applied to electronic transmissions. If you want to buy something online, see if you can be billed. Consider the security of the company's ordering system; online vendors are working on upgrades in response to consumer concerns, and it might be worth e-mailing the company for information about how they will protect your personal data. As for harassment, some urge fighting back instead of logging off. They suggest responding to abusive message senders with strongly worded replies telling them to back off, and reporting harassers to the system operator of bulletin board systems or online services. Computer security is a real issue, but it's one based largely on common sense. Have you changed your password lately? If not, do so, and while you're at it, better run out and grab the keys from your ignition. Internet Security Systems, Inc.

TIMES FOR NETWORK SECURITY MElM an ^ cs Kevin I * BRtVfl Mitnick and other crackers sending chills up the collective spine of Internet users, network owners are racing to create firewalls within systems connected to the Internet. However, these software developments could actually help, rather than hinder, crackers. For example, there's a software program called SATAN (Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks) that's now available for free over the Internet. SATAN was developed by data security expert Dan Farmer (who worked for Silicon Graphics until a controversy over his plans to distribute SATAN to all for free erupted) and Dutch researcher Wietse Venema. It's designed to help network administrators uncover network weaknesses so that they can buttress security. Unlike most security software programs, SATAN can scan multiple host computers, rather than just one, to identify vulnerabilities. Some in the Internet community, however, are worried that SATAN will fall into the wrong hands and end up assisting those intent on cracking a computer's security. In particular, they believe that the software's easy-to-use Mosaic interface will eliminate the need for crackers to be technically savvy. SRI, the technology think tank in Menlo Park, CA, has asked Farmer to attach a hefty price tag to the software and make it proprietary. The question of whether SATAN and other security systems should be free and available to all underscores the fact that secrecy and freedom issues are going to play an important role in shaping the future of the Internet. Jtjy Jkzrt' 'ti&Cd&r Crackers Typically lumped in with hackers by the general media, these are people who employ their technical skills to break into computer systems and commit crimes, such as vandalism or stealing data for financial gain. Firewalls Security-conscious companies set up computers called firewalls to prevent outsiders from tampering with their internal computer systems. The firewalls act as a gateway, monitoring traffic between an Internet site and the Internet, and ferreting out and blocking unauthorized access. premiere issue 1995 3 / 4 T^lS SPACE xr-c-r /mtEn'ttoH^llY blan*' (email) thenet@intercon.com (web) http://www.intercon.com/thenet ifiterGon I n «jjji lashing Through the Cyberspace gle in Search of Classic Games here are 20 million or more Internet users out there in cyberspace.

Could be — those rooms get pretty crowded these days. Subscribing to newsgroups? Flaming poor newbies? Survey says ... The number-one activity is downloading files. Software is the name of the game. There are thousands — no, make that tens of thousands — of programs available. Internet tools and information. Freeware. Shareware. Commercial demos. Upgrades, patches, and product previews. And they're all yours for the FTPing. Me, I like old-fashioned games. You might think that, as someone who gets to play beta copies and advance promotional copies of forthcoming CD-ROMs and software, I wouldn't waste my time with games that are more than five minutes old. But when I'm in a time-wasting mood, I prefer tried-and-true classics that are decidedly unglamorous — at least by the latest multimedia bells-and- whistles standards. Shanghai , for example, remains a firm favorite. I'll always play a hand or two of cribbage. And sometimes I still try to beat my best time at Minesweeper without cheating. But it is Rogue that remains at the top of my Best of the Oldies list. It has transcended the limitations of its When i m in time-wastin mood, I prerer tried-ana-true classics that are decidedly unglamorous — at least by the latest multimedia bells- and-whistles standards. character-based graphics to provide endless hours of blade-wielding fun. It took me a couple of weeks — I lie; it took me a couple of months — to hack and slash my way down 30 flights or more of that doom-laden dungeon and claim my prize. And the other night I felt a nostalgic desire to hold that sword once more, and to fight my way past unknown terrors to the bottom of the death- cursed maze. Surely, I wasn't alone in remembering Rogue with such rose-tinted visions. I logged on and kicked in the newsreader. Scrolling down the list, I quickly discovered not just one, but six different newsgroups dedicated to discussing Rogue and Rogue- like games. I scanned the likeliest-looking files and soon hit on Aliza R. Panitz's FAQ of FTP sites. Wow — there were all kinds of goodies here to warm the cockles of a virtual warrior's heart. Ragnarok caught my eye. I remembered when the game came out commercially, and it has since been released in a shareware version. The FAQ told me it was available from poppy.engr.ucdavis.edu/rag22.exe. Sounded worth trying. I sent Fetch off and running and pretty soon it came back with rag22.exe between its teeth. It took quite a few minutes to download the binary file — later, I tried FTPing via America Online and received a message that it would take more than half an hour for the transfer. I flipped the file over to Windows (I was using the Mac side of the machine up to that point) and it self-extracted and quickly decompressed itself into a new folder. There it was: Ragnarok.exe.

From the outset, it has been the meeting ground for a diverse, eclectic, and improbable association of people. Jkv-r VV’| er<rns< Telnet A remote log-in service for the Internet that enables a user at one site to access a remote site as if the two sites were directly connected. The downside is Telnet's grievous slowness. Wide Area Network A form of networking that connects computers across long distances, using modems to send signals. It allows communication to be independent of the computers using the wide area network. C ruising cyberspace, you can bump into everyone from military analysts and academics to computer geeks, hyperactive technopunks, and outdoor enthusiasts seeking the latest ski report, not to mention software company spies charting their competitors' latest moves. Now that gaining access to the vast Internet computer network is becoming easier — especially with commercial online services such as CompuServe adding Telnet capabilities — the Internet is extending beyond its original group of users to encompass all kinds of people all over the world. Yet ironically, today's eclectic mix of Internet aficionados are benefiting from technology born of paranoid, Cold War fear mongering within the U.S. government. The imagined echo, \"the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming,\" sparked the revolution in computer networking that, ultimately, spawned the Internet. Worried that a thermonuclear strike might cramp its ability to transfer data, the U.S. Department of Defense in the late 1960s began funding research on computer networking as a means of bolstering military communications. One of the projects was a wide area network called the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency — a properly Bond-like acronym). Using the ARPANET both as a way to move data between project sites and as a place to evaluate new communication software and applications, defense-funded researchers put in place a prototype Internet by 1982. Many of the top computer scientists in industry and academia had access to this structure through CSNET (Computer Science Network), a project created by the National Science Foundation (NSF), yet another U.S. government agency. Then, in 1983, all U.S. military sites were connected to the ARPANET, marking its transition to a practical rather than an experimental network. Recognizing the role interconnectivity had begun to play in computer communication research, the NSF built its own wide area network, called NSFNET, which linked its five supercomputer centers across the country. Determined to extend access to every science and engineering researcher in the U.S. (a goal that eluded both the ARPANET and the NSFNET due to lack of capacity), the NSF helped fund the building of a high-speed wide area network in 1988. This new Internet opened its doors to all educational facilities, academic researchers, government employees, and international research organizations, which essentially democratized the system. Graduate students using the Internet saw its potential not only for research, but also for fun and games (probably the most unlikely uses the founders of the ARPANET could have envisioned). What happened next was a sort of \"big bang.\" In 1983, 562 computers were on the Internet. By 1989, that number had jumped to 80,000. With capacity again strained, another wide area network was built in 1992; it forms the backbone of the current Internet. Today, there are more than 30 million users and 2 million computers on the Internet. So, cyberspace friends, not only are you in good company (you're bound to find someone on the Internet with interests similar to yours), but you have a vast array of worlds to explore.

Here's a rundown of what you'll need for optimal access. efore the dawn of the World Wide Web and the graphical capabilities of Web browsers, almost any personal computer setup was adequate for accessing the Internet. Sure, maybe you needed an SVGA card to view an image you'd downloaded, but at least you weren't waiting for several images on a single Web page to be drawn. Like it or not, the Web has changed the way people use the Internet — as well as the tools required to get the most out of time online. Here's a brief rundown on what you need to maximize your PC's cruising speed. CPU: 486/50 megahertz (MHz) or faster. Most Internet applications run under Windows, so peppy Windows performance is a must. RAM: Eight megabytes (MB) should be adequate, but Netscape's memory cache will use more if you can allocate it, which will speed up reload times for previously accessed pages. Modem: 14.4 modems, which transfer 14,400 bits per second, are pretty much the baseline standard. They were considered the hottest chariots just a year or so ago. However, if your provider offers (or plans to offer) 28.8 (28,000 bps) or faster access, the extra money you spend for this kind of modem will pay Netscape offers good performance with at least eight megabytes of RAM — but if you've got more, you can increase the program's memory cache. This will speed uploading times. off. You'll get significantly faster Internet cruising and speedier downloading of graphics. Video Card: Data transmission rate levels the playing field — because data come in only so fast, nearly any card is adequate. If your card handles graphic images well, it'll be fine for most of the stuff you download. However, a Windows-accelerated video card will speed up everything you do if you're in Windows. Hard Drive: Since you'll be downloading all sorts of goodies, you'll probably want at least a 500 MB hard drive. If you don't have that much space, you can either use disk compression software or buy a new hard drive. Although the latter suggestion may sound expensive, hard-drive memory upgrades are actually quite affordable, around 50 cents a megabyte. Sound Card: Any 16- or 32-bit sound card with Windows drivers should be just fine. Buy one based on how it sounds to you and how well it fits your budget. Monitor: A 15-inch monitor is certainly sufficient, but if you plan on running at 800 by 600 or higher, you'll save yourself a lot of eye strain with a 17- inch monitor. Don't even think about anything smaller — you'd be amazed at how tiny a 14-inch monitor seems when you're looking at graphics. Speakers: You can spend anywhere from $25 to more than $300 on speakers for your PC. As with the sound card, your choice depends on budget and the level of sound quality you want. You could run your PC straight into a stereo, if one happens to be nearby. Software and Utilities: Make sure you have the latest drivers for your video and audio cards. For playback of video clips, you'll want Video for Windows, Quicktime for Windows, and the Indeo -bcf World Wide Web Known as the Internet's \"killer application,\" the Web was developed in 1990 at Switzerland's European Laboratory for Particle Physics. It provides a graphical, magazine-style interface to the Internet using hypertext-linked documents.

How to Choose an Internet Provider The most basic step to going online, other than getting a computer and a modem, involves selecting a service provider — a company that will supply you with the connection you need. Here are a few things to consider before taking the plunge. Connect; Basically, you have four types of Internet service providers to choose from: 1. Dedicated: This is the most expensive type, typically used by universities. It allows a direct connection to the Internet with no limit on how many companies can work off of the connection. 2. Dial-In (SLIP/PPP): You dial in to a company that has a direct connection. See page 23 for a definition of SLIP and PPP, the protocols for connecting. 3. Dial-Up (Terminal): You're connected to another company's system that is connected to the Internet; this is how commercial online services such as CompuServe work. 4. Mail Only: You can often access e-mail through bulletin board systems, but you won't be able to gain entry to other aspects of the Internet. T he fact that you're reading this magazine instead of Elegant Bride or Hot Rod suggests that you either have an Internet account or are thinking about opening one. If you're already hooked up, you may be wondering if you could get a better deal; if not, choosing from among the dozens of local and national Internet service providers can be a daunting task. Either way, by answering the following questions, you should be able to narrow your list of possible providers. • What's the total cost? The true cost of Internet service is made up of several elements: a monthly charge, which may include a fixed or unlimited number of hours online; an hourly fixed charge for additional time; and a charge for the connection itself, which may require long-distance telephone calls or access through a data network such as Sprintnet. A \"free\" Internet account in another city might actually cost more than a local one for $20 or $30 per month. • Can you connect easily? The lowest cost is not always the best choice. If you spend more time listening to busy signals than you do online, it's time to cancel your account. (Hint: Use a redial-on-busy script; you'll be amazed at how often you can connect within two minutes or less.) System downtime also holds up connections. It's true that modems, servers, and routers sometimes fail, but if you suffer frequent and prolonged stretches of time when the system does not answer, you need a different service provider. • Is support available? Is it useful? Sooner or later, you'll need some kind of hand- holding. You might want to configure a new modem, or a program that has worked flawlessly for months might mysteriously die. What happens when you call for help? Calls to tech support tend to come in bunches, especially when some part of the service provider's setup crashes. If you can't get an immediate answer, does someone return your call within a couple hours? A local access number does not guarantee that the support center is nearby. Can you reach it with a free call, or will you pay by the minute while you're waiting on long-distance hold? One good measure of tech support is a service provider's ability to give you a custom log-in script. It's a good sign if the provider knows enough to get you up and running quickly and easily. Also, ask if the support staff knows about the software you plan to use. • What kind of extra services do you get? Many service providers offer a plain vanilla connection and nothing more, but if you look around, you might find some added hot fudge and whipped cream. For example, some accounts include space on a Web server or an FTP server. Other providers might offer their own conferences or newsgroups, or a toll-free telephone number for access from out of town. Especially in competitive markets, such as Seattle and Boston, it's worth asking about extras. And don’t ignore the commercial online services. Some hard-core Internet heads may sneer at @aol.com or @prodigy.com e-mail addresses, but these services are relatively easy to use, and their prices can be competitive with those of other Internet service providers. Finally, take advantage of the free connect time that many Internet service providers offer to new users. If you get constant busy signals or unhelpful tech support while you're on their dime, thank them politely and move to the next provider on your list. — John Ross A \\ef r Hot Fudge and Whipped Cream Two sinfully fattening toppings to vanilla ice cream. These decadent extras can turn the act of eating ice cream into a blissful experience. Likewise, choosing an Internet access provider with a few extra \"toppings” can transform cyber travel into a truly unprecedented affair — and you won't gain weight. premiere issue 1995 D 2 4 Mr part 4 Start Me Up! Packages that Promise the World While starter packages can be good deals, making a smart purchase is tricky. A word to the wise: Don't let disks alone be your guide. Here's why. I f you've been to a bookstore lately, you've probably seen the racks brimming with Internet books. Most come with one or two disks of Internet software, and some include sign-up offers from Internet service providers. Others dispense with the book altogether: \"All you need to surf the Net!\" scream the covers of floppy disks sitting next to the cash register. \"Be on the Internet in minutes! Hundreds of dollars in free software included!\" One of the great things about books is that you can flip through the pages to see what you're getting. But when software and Internet services are included, you'll find that making a wise purchase is a bit trickier. Some packages are good deals, but often useful books are bundled with software that misses the mark, and few packages, if any, are worth buying just to get the disks. Caveat emptor: Netcruiser's box says, “Free Internet Service Offer,” but that free month costs $25. Billing Information •y NSTOOM About Your Account Please Enter Your Credit Card Information ' ~ Credit Card ® VISA O MasterCard O American Express Living Up to Expectations? Sometimes the software isn't quite what you'd expect. A few Internet books come with sign-up kits for WinNet or Delphi, for example. WinNet provides offline e-mail and Usenet news feeds, while Delphi is a conventional online system with some Internet access. These aren't bad services — they're just not what most of us have in mind when we think about connecting to the Internet. Other packages offer more complete access but are tied to a single Internet service provider. Netcom's Netcruiser and PSINET Pipeline's Internaut, for example, require you to sign up with their default providers. The software is fine, but the providers' range is limited. Netcom has a presence in a couple dozen NETCOM welcomes you to NetCruiser! Your first monthly fee, a value of $19.95, will be waived after your one time, non-refundable, $25.00 registration fee is paid. Your current charge will be $25.00 After your free month, your monthly fee will be $19.95 billed on the first of each month. It Card Number Example: 12j4-bb/B-yui2-J4bb Expiration Date :xample: mm/yy OK Cancel Registration large cities, while other small providers are local only to their particular areas. If you don't live in those places, you'll have to make a long-distance call or use a packet network such as Sprintnet. Either option adds to your hourly Internet cost. For total Internet access that isn't tied to a single service provider, Trumpet WinSock and the Chameleon Sampler are the low-end standards for Windows users. They're widely available online and are also included in many book/disk combinations. Trumpet WinSock is shareware, unpolished in appearance but quite powerful. The Chameleon Sampler is a freeware demo of Netmanage Inc.'s Internet Chameleon, but it's usable in its own right. Both programs handle SLIP and PPP connections to the service of your choice. Another set of WinSock-based Internet tools is available with Angela Gunn's Plug ‘n Play Mosaic (see review, page 73), which comes with a software bundle that includes Distinct TCP/IP and Enhanced NCSA Mosaic. On the other hand, Mortice Kern Systems' Internet Anywhere book contains little more than instructions for the software, which is a very limited trial version of the company's commercial product. Finding Bargains with Small Providers What you pay for Internet service and what you get for your money both depend on the provider you choose. Some book/disk kits try to make that choice for you, with software that's tied to one provider or that automatically calls up a cooperating service. But in many parts of the country, the best Internet deals often come from smaller providers. A local company may be the only provider with its own modems in your local dialing area, particularly if you live outside a big city. That can make a big difference in your monthly bill, but a small provider isn't likely to offer its services in books that are sold all over the country. If an Internet book looks like something you want to read, buy it, and maybe you'll get some useful software as a bonus. But unless you already know that the software and services are your best bet, don't let the included disks guide your decision about services. — Tim Victor ■Jk&P Pipeline Direct access Internet service provider that was founded by James Gleick, author of Chaos: Making a New Science. It has been acquired by Performance Systems International (PSINet). D2f premiere issue 1 995 part 5 About A Brie Stuff.. ystems Internet explorers are notoriously picky about which operating system they use for voyaging. Fury can erupt when one user espouses Mac and another Windows — and those aren 't even the only two operating systems around. Because we at The Net aren't taking sides, we asked five expert users to focus on their operating system of choice, appraising the Internet- ready features bundled with it and identifying missing links. They also recommend tools that will compensate for deficiencies, so users can cruise the information superhighway more easily. When it comes to Internet connectivity, some operating systems simply inspire more passion than others — as you'll see. Windows 3.1 A \\&f Windows 3.1 Made by the ubiquitous Microsoft, Windows 3.1 is (soon?) to be updated by Windows 95, which will let you run DOS games that didn't work with version 3.1. For more information on Windows 95, see page 28. Fresh out of the box, Windows 3.1 doesn't allow easy Internet connectivity. Still, the large number of add-on software packages available for Windows has made it one of the most popular operating systems for accessing cyberspace. When first installed, Windows 3.1 doesn't impress with its Internet-ability. Its meager communications applet, called Terminal, can dial your modem to access a bulletin-board system or the text-based menus of services such as CompuServe or GEnie, but it can't get you on the Internet. To do this, you'll need shell software provided by your Internet service, or a TCP/IP connection with SLIP/PPP dial-up and WinSock-compliant clients, such as Netscape for World Wide Web access. Windows for Workgroups does include TCP/IP networking, but no SLIP or PPP. That means you can get online only if your local area network is itself tied into the Internet via a gateway of some kind. Do-It-Yourself Shareware Nevertheless, you have plenty of choices for TCP/IP and WinSock compatibility with Windows 3.1. You get a TCP/IP suite, SLIP and PPP dial-up, and a few utilities with shareware Trumpet WinSock. Just plug the technical details of your Internet account — such as the IP addresses for your Domain Name System (DNS) server, gateway, and so forth — and your username and domain, into the Trumpet configuration program. Then, dial your provider to get an actual connection to the Internet. The advantage of a live connection like PPP is that you are an actual participant on a network attached directly to the Internet. With PPP, you can \"roll your own\" Internet access, choosing from shareware, freeware, and commercial tools such as Eudora for e-mail, WS_FTP for file transfer, and Netscape for With PPP, you can “roll your own” I nternet access.

Based in Seattle, WA, it was acquired in March by CompuServe for about $100 million in stock and cash. At the time of the acquisition, CompuServe said Spry would help make it a significant Internet player. Commercial Shareware and Shell Accounts If you're not satisfied with do-it-yourself shareware, you can choose among a number of commercial packages, such as Spry's Internet In a Box, which features Chameleon TCP/IP from Netmanage and Spry's own commercial tools for FTP, Telnet, as well as an enhanced Web Viewer (Air Mosaic). Other tools include Frontier's SuperHighway Access and book/shareware combinations like Internet Membership Kit from Ventana Media. Instead of going the TCP/IP and PPP route, you can subscribe to a shell account from an Internet provider. In the past, a shell account gave you a text-based menu system, but recently, providers such as Pipeline have enhanced their tools with easy-to-use Windows graphical user interfaces, including their own brands of Web browsers. Shell accounts are less expensive, but they narrow your options to the software provided with the account. Commercial Online Services You can also turn to commercial online service providers such as CompuServe, GEnie, Prodigy, and America Online for Internet access. At the time of this writing, only Prodigy featured the Web viewing, but you usually get FTP, newsgroups, Internet mail, Gopher/WAIS — pretty much all the Internet you need from all of them. Getting on the Internet this way can be more costly, however, since you're paying the usual online charges, and you're limited by the dial-up speed of the service, often just 9,600 baud in many areas. However, both CompuServe and America Online are working to launch high-speed, 28,800 bits per second networks in the coming year. — Charles Brannon Internet Resources What resources are available to connect Windows users to the Internet?

Macintosh users are pretty much on their own when it comes to Internet access. The Macintosh operating system doesn't include even a basic terminal program, and most Macs don't ship with a modem. So it's up to you to find the Mac- compatible Internet stuff you need. The key is getting a fast modem. Once you have that, you can check into Apple's eWorld service. Apple gives the kits away with most new Macs. eWorld is still finding its legs, however. America Online is still a sturdier commercial service for Mac owners, and it should be offering a full Internet browser soon.

See helpful hint in the 2/3 eWorld Weekly News under <Shaking Hands>. Commercially available since the summer of 1994, Apple's eWorld is intended to be a virtual neighborhood for users to visit. Apple is positioning eWorld as being more interactive, making better use of graphics, and being easier to navigate around than other commercial services. It’s a Small eWorld, After All \"With online services, new virtual neighborhoods of like-minded people spring up daily, hourly. ..People not only find like- minded people that because of geographic distance they couldn't find before, but... families and friends. ..once separated by distance re-establish their intimacy because of the ease and accessibility of online services. I believe this idea — that natural relationships can be re-established because of online services — acts as a metaphor for what online services can do to the vendor/customer relationship: bringing it back to a level of openness and intimacy that's more intuitive and natural and appropriate. Just as the eWorld town square tells our users that they're not just accessing information, but coming to a neighborhood, so, too, can online services take the customer/vendor relationship out of data analysis and spreadsheets and back to conversation and discussion. \" — Peter Friedman, vice president, eWorld 0 2 9 premiere issue 1995 OS/2 OS/2 Warp lives up to its hype: It will enable you to surf the Internet with ease and provides a full- featured Web browser that works well the first time. Good news for the nun in the IBM commercial who says she's \"dying to surf the Net\": OS/2 Warp will let her do all the surfing she desires. As an OS/2 user, she owes it to herself, and so do you, to upgrade to Warp. If you're a Microsoft Windows or even an MS-DOS user, you might also consider it because it's a quick and easy way to get started on the Internet. Warp is a complete operating system, demanding about eight megabytes (MB) of RAM and 80 MB of hard disk space, but it gives you full Internet access right out of the box. Easy-to-Use Screens Once you've installed Warp, load the Internet software from the Bonus Pack. On your desktop will appear an icon labeled IBM Internet Connection for OS/2. Double-click here, go into the IBM Internet Customer Service folder, and double-click on Registration. You'll be taken through a series of easy- to-use screens that ask for your name, address, phone number, credit card information, modem type, serial port number, and so on. You'll also be asked for three preferred usernames. Then, the program will dial a toll-free number and instantly register you with the IBM Network. IBMNet offers access in many countries, and the local phone number list is growing rapidly. When you sign up, you receive three free hours of access, then you're switched automatically Warp’s Web browser, a necessity in an Internet package, doesn’t disappoint. & WttOSnSmt* DGSPn»gfa»* Wn-lew* PtOjpwiew iAjsmhwj ‘ kp/ip y 3a p»?ep * WSwSRMk* S J Oval fkx* vk vs ❖ IBM Internet Connection Service Registration The IBM Global Network provides access to the Internet and a variety of other networking services.

With IBMNet's user-friendly, full-featured WebExplorer, you'll quickly find yourself becoming a “virtual tourist'' of the World Wide Web, with easy access to all its wonders and mysteries. to the standard subscription fee of $12.95 per month for six hours of access. A comprehensive plan gives you a reasonable 30 hours of access for $29.95 monthly. Or, you can dial in through a toll-free number, but this adds $6.00 per hour to the price. IBMNet offers special deals in a number of different countries, so be sure to check your options. Also, note that you can configure Warp to dial into your existing Internet account, although this takes some work. A Robust Browser, but Little Software So, what does IBMNet provide? There's a solid little e-mail program called Ultimedia Mail Lite, and you get a very browsable Gopher program. NewsReader/2 gives you access to nearly 8,000 Usenet groups (happily, IBM doesn't seem to believe in censorship), while two Telnet programs offer you VT100 or the less-used 3270 access to other machines. You get point-and-click access to files around the world from the attractive and functional FTP program. Warp's Web browser — WebExplorer — doesn't disappoint, either. This full-featured browser works well the first time. To get it, access the Retrieve Software Updates program from the IBM Internet Connection folder. Warp both downloads and installs the browser, with an ease rarely seen in Internet programs anywhere. The downside? Just one — there simply isn't a lot of OS/2 software available for the Internet and not much is on the horizon. No NCSA Mosaic, no Netscape, few e-mail choices. Yes, you can run Windows from OS/2, but it'll run more slowly and sometimes takes ages to load. Then again, this could inspire you to write OS/2 programs, which you could distribute across the Internet to the growing number of OS/2 and IBMNet users. If they're good, you'll be an instant hero. — Neil Randall -fte-r \\lieXTi OS/2 Warp OS/2 Warp is a family of products made by IBM.
