However, there are several Web browsers out there, and you should seriously consider your alternatives to make the most of your surfing experience.\n\nThat's precisely what occurred in 1995, when Wagner, then a graduate student at Berkeley, and his fellow student Ian Goldberg cracked the random-number generator used by the Netscape web browser to secure online transactions."
