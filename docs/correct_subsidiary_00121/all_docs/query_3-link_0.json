It launched a dial-up online service for the Commodore 64 which eventually spread to Macs and PCs--one that became a lot better known after it was renamed America Online in 1989. At various…",

        "text": "In retrospect, most of AOL’s big acquisitions turned out to be bad news for everyone involved. (As a CompuServe user, my heart sunk when I first heard that this one was happening.) AOL drove the CompuServe service into the ground in short order, but continues to operate it as a zombie to this day: The current CompuServe site is so archaic that it brags about supporting Microsoft’s latest OS…Windows XP.\n\nAt risk of repeating myself, I’d like to say that as a Netscape user, my heart sunk when I heard this merger was happening. Would the story of Netscape have had a happier ending if AOL hadn’t horned in? Maybe, maybe not. In this release, Steve Case specifically lauds Netscape for de-emphasizing its namesake Web browser–a strategic blunder that turns out to have been the beginning of the end.\n\nI’ve already annotated this historic press release. I wonder what the parties involved would do with the $164 billion that AOL paid for Time Warner if they had it back and could spend it in some other fashion? (Hey, how much would it have cost for AOL to acquire Comcast instead a decade ago?)\n\nIn the mood to read one more AOL press release? Take a look at the one from last December in which the company announces that it’s once again an independent outfit. Then come back here and share your AOL memories–whether they’re fond, painful, or a little bit of both.\n\n«PREVIOUS PAGE 1 2 3 4\n\n14 Comments\n\nRead more:"
