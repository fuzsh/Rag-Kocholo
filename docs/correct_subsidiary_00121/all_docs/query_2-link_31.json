        "text": "Episode 35 Transcript\n\nTim Berners-Lee: We have to realize that the people who run the social networks, the existing social networks, can change them. You know, they’re all just code. Maybe you’re a feminist blogger on Twitter or something. And you get up in the morning, and it’s hard to avoid people saying really nasty things about you. Then it’s reasonable to go to the platform. It’s reasonable to hold them accountable.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Welcome to this episode of Untangling the Web, a podcast of the Web Science Trust. I am Noshir Contractor and I will be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in thought leaders to explore how the web is shaping society, and how society in turn is shaping the web. My guest today is Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who you just heard talking about how we can reengineer digital technologies for good. Tim is a computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web.\n\nBut before I introduce Tim, an announcement: This is not only the 35th episode of Untangling the Web but the last one for this season. Keep your ears open on your favorite podcast platforms for a mini episode reflecting on the past, present and future of the Untangling the Web podcast series.\n\nThat said, let’s get back to Tim. Tim is a professorial fellow of computer science at the University of Oxford and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium, W3C for short, which oversees the continued development of the web. He co-founded the World Wide Web Foundation and is the founder and president of the Open Data Institute. He is also the founder of the Web Science Trust, which produces the Untangling the Web podcast. In 2004, Sir Tim Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for services to the global development of the Internet through his invention of the World Wide Web. Welcome, Tim.\n\nTim Berners-Lee: Thanks, Nosh.\n\nNoshir Contractor: It’s a true delight to have you on an episode of Untangling the Web as somebody who created the World Wide Web. I want to start by asking you, how you, following the creation of the World Wide Web, decided that one needed to think about the science surrounding that and your use of the phrase “web science”?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: People think simplistically of the web as being a technical system. Somebody makes a link and somebody else follows a link. The computer, when they click on the link, does the business of bringing up the destination webpage. And the person who made the original link, why did they make the link? So things like podcasts or before them blogs, you know, they spread because people interact through the web. The web and all things like it, they’re sociotechnical systems. They are people and computers interacting. And so they needed to think about, at the time, to get people from both sides, social sciences and the, the technical side, to collaborate together very closely. Hence web science.\n\nNoshir Contractor: And the significant difference is that once the computer was invented and we created a discipline called computer science, unlike computer science, your vision of web science from the start was to be an interdiscipline, as you said, on both sides of it.\n\nTim Berners-Lee: Yes, in a way, one of the models was cognitive science, that people took, they very deliberately took sort of psychology and neuroscience and a bunch of different disciplines, including AI I suspect, and said, okay, if we’re going to study the brain, we have to get all the people who are looking at different sciences to talk together. We had a figure like, yes, there are lots of neurons in the brain. But there’s even more web pages out there on the web. So if something is going to require study in its complexity, the web merits it, just like the brain.\n\nNoshir Contractor: What are the areas where you think we need to see a lot more progress? If you had to make a recommendation about what web science today should be focusing on, what, what would be your recommendations?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: For a lot of people out there, there’s a huge concern with the web in general is fake news. And not just fake news, but the deliberate manipulation of people to do things which is not in fact in their best interests. So I think, because the web is such an important tool for making democratic decisions and so on, what I think we need to do is build more tools for democracy, build more tools for coming to collective agreement and understanding about the way forward. Something like Wikipedia or Reddit or something where people come online and interact together, when it’s a system which allows people to, to interact in a way that’s managed. The system is providing the process which end up leading to people being more constructive, respecting each other’s opinions rather than attacking them, and so on. So I think the way we build our social networks in particular and our interactive collaborative tools has a lot to answer for. And so I think it’s important that we build new ones, which are better at that, which are better at helping us be collaborative, constructive, and democratic.\n\nNoshir Contractor: One of the reasons why the web has been so fascinating is that in some ways, there is no centralized control. So engineering in that sense becomes a tricky issue where you’re creating something that has at it’s very premise, a level of decentralization.\n\nTim Berners-Lee: Yes, but you still create it. You create a little protocol, for example, whether it’s sort of email, or the ability to link to somebody’s blog, or something, and that technical protocol comes along with an accompanying social protocol, the social protocol being people like to be read and will do almost anything to get that. There used to be hit numbers on the bottoms of blogs. And you’d get up in the morning and see how many people read your blog overnight. And so people are motivated by being read and to be read they need to have a good blog or a blog that people thought it was worth linking to and so on. The sociotechnical system then evolves to become, you get a virtuous circle where people try to make their blogs better and better, and they link to more and more interesting blogs, and the blogosphere just seems to become ridiculously beneficial, ridiculously valuable. And that’s the way the technology itself should work when – on a good day.\n\nNoshir Contractor: I was just going to touch on that – on a good day. Because as you pointed out, in many cases, you’ve described examples of virtuous cycles. And we also witness many instances of vicious cycles, whether it is in terms of overall societal well-being or human rights, democracy, education, take your pick. What do you think today are ways in which we need to reengineer the web to help make the good days more frequent and the virtuous cycles more likely than the vicious cycles?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: We have to realize that the people who run the social networks, the existing social networks can change them. You know, they’re all just code. Maybe you’re a feminist blogger on Twitter or something and you get up in the morning, and it’s hard to avoid people saying really nasty things about you. Then it’s reasonable to go to the platform, it’s reasonable to hold them accountable. When the Web Foundation looked at online, gender-based violence, I think there were three cases where they looked at what was going on with the platform, and they suggested that the platform could make a bit of a change. And the platform made that change. But certainly things like should you let people know how many people have liked their stuff? Or can you remove the toxicity of people just talk about what they’re doing without being able to see what the reactions were? We should do the web science, do the analysis, but also we should be prepared to force platforms to change if they are creating badness in the world.\n\nNoshir Contractor: And you’re absolutely right, there are small pieces of information or nudges that we could tweak on social media platforms that can have enormous implications in terms of our motivations for posting things or also nurturing more constructive deliberative discussions. You’ve been very instrumental in creating this ecosystem of institutions, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the World Wide Web Foundation, and the Web Science Trust, among others, to nurture and to tend the growth of the web. What prompted you to build this ecosystem? How do you see these connected to each other and helping one another as part of an ecosystem?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: So in a way, it was a tremendous luxury to be able to sit down in an office at CERN and just write down HTTP and HTML specs and code them up without anybody looking over my shoulder. But those days were immediately over the moment the thing started to take off. Then immediately, we had to make sure we had agreement, we had interoperability, every web browser across the planet had to speak the same language. It had to be able to talk to any web server. That’s a big ask. So the engineers working on areas where protocols and natural policy is important, they have to do this very grown up thing of realizing that other people have got great ideas too. And if you go to the working group and sit down with them, between you, you will actually come up with something which is even more powerful than you could have got.\n\nSo the W3C is a standards body. It started in ‘94. People came to my office from Digital Equipment Corporation, American computer company, came in to my office in CERN and said, you know, we need to have standards, you need to make a consortium. The X Consortium, it was run by MIT. We like that. I wanted it to be international, so we had a base in France and a base in Japan and China. There are hundreds of exciting specs being produced, adding accessibility to it and adding internationalization to it. So putting all sorts of values behind that community and saying, everything you do must be as accessible as possible to people with disabilities. Everything you do must work in any culture no matter what language people speak. Starting the consortium as a community with those values I think has been really crucial to the healthy progress of the web.\n\nThere was a feeling when we got to the point where, oh, somebody noticed 20% of the world is actually on the web. Then that meant, that 20% of the world is enabled, more. If we’re constantly making the digital divide bigger by making the web more powerful, don’t we have a moral obligation to try to get the other 80% of the world online as quickly as possible. Partly in the way we design the web to make it work on mobile devices and so on, talking to governments about making sure that they do allow a competitive industry for the internet connectivity, for example, that the internet is affordable, things like that. So the Web Foundation came out of two pieces then: the shouldn’t we make sure that the other 80% of the world get online as quickly as possible, then we have a moral obligation also to make sure that the web serves humanity, that it’s used for good. That was the Web Foundation, while meanwhile the Open Data Institute came from a more focused realization of the power of data. When Gordon Brown was prime minister of the UK asked, what should the UK do to make the most use of the best use of the Internet? And we said, “Well, you should put all your government data online for free.” And, and then he said, “Okay, let’s do that.” And so that project, the Open Data Institute was to help that.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Tell us a little bit about what prompted you to come up with the Web Science Trust.\n\nTim Berners-Lee: So web science was initially very much on the academic side, compared to the consortium. It was important that we got our colleagues in different fields to come and help us figure out how to analyze this complicated thing that is the web. It needed an institutional home and an institutional existence and the Web Science Trust turned out to be the most useful thing. We have a web science journal and a web science conference, and so on, and so the Trust holds those things together.\n\nNoshir Contractor: You have, for a long time, obviously, been passionate about the virtue of the web being decentralized. Your most recent work is to revisit that decentralization in terms of launching Solid, or SOcial LInked Data.\n\nTim Berners-Lee: Solid is a new level of protocol for the web, it’s using HTTP and it’s using linked data, and you know, we talked about the blogosphere. That’s one place we could start. So back in the day, right, so imagine you were a total geek, and you had a computer in your basement, which is running a web server and you connect it. You have to get a domain name, then you put interactive things on your web server. You could be creative. And most in particular, you could chat there and chat with other people and you could link to other things. Whereas now everybody’s on Facebook. Everyone’s on the big social networks. So what went wrong with this picture? The feeling with the blogosphere was, it was decentralized. Everybody had their own website. And there was a certain glorious power. People call it now sovereign identity. You wrote the rules of your own website. You could turn it off, you could unplug it, or you plug it in and just be part of humanity. So the Solid project, the SOcial LInked Data Project, is a movement, if you like to, let’s say, how can we go back to those days? We’ll make it so that everybody does have a website. You have a place where you can publish stuff. It’s like, a bit like a Dropbox account or a G-drive. It’s a personal cloud. It’s like a thumb drive in the sky. The very enabling thing is that once you put stuff in your Solid Pod, anybody anywhere to access it. A Solid Pod gives you the ability to connect to anybody else, to share with anybody else. So you don’t have to get everybody onto Flickr. You can certainly share the photographs with people on Flickr. You can share them with people who are on Facebook or people on LinkedIn. In a way, it breaks down those silos. Also from the point of view of ethically, because you’ve left the user in control of their data, actually, that’s what you should do, because of GDPR, and just the ethics of data ownership and data control. So now we believe philosophically that everybody should, you should be able to control your own data. Solid gives you the technology to be able to do that. So that’s more or less where Solid came from.\n\nNoshir Contractor: That’s fascinating, Tim. Is it fair to say that two key tenets of Solid is that each individual is now in more control of their own data, but that the interoperability available through Solid means that social media platforms don’t own your data but can essentially share data that you want to share with them through the protocols of Solid?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: Interoperability is, yes, it is really important. It’s really valuable. At the moment, the social network programs are talking about portability, and the government may mandate portability. That is, if I’ve got all my photographs in Flickr or Instagram, I should have the legal right to extract them and then put them into Google or Dropbox or whatever. Interoperability is much more powerful. Interoperability is, it doesn’t matter where your photographs are. You can use any app. So I’m building a great slideshow with my favorite slideshow app, but my kids are all watching the slideshow using completely different apps on their phone, because the way it’s stored in Solid Pods is standards. So that means we need a lot of standards. In the internet stack-level terminology, this is layer seven. This is the application layer. So what we’re doing with Solid is we’re taking all that stuff and we’re making standards, which will be interoperable between people’s Pods – very much more empowering for the user to be able to run, choose to run different applications at the same time on the same data.\n\nNoshir Contractor: I can see that this is very empowering for the user. What would you say is the incentive for the existing platform providers to play and make their work compatible with Solid? From their point of view, what is the incentive to do this when they already control large parts of the market for example?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: To a certain extent, if they don’t, that’ll be fine. We’ve seen this before. If you insist on being a silo, you can be a silo for quite a long time. AOL was a silo for quite a long time. But eventually AOL had to admit that there was this internet thing, and then bit by bit, and then it became a part of the internet rather than the other way around and so on. So when you have a silo which does not interoperate with the rest of the world, the classic walled garden, the jungle outside the garden always becomes more exciting.\n\nNoshir Contractor: It is extremely exciting to see the vision of Solid. Solid would make sharing your vaccine status, for example, a lot easier than it might be currently. As we look at the last couple of years in the pandemic, what are some of the ways in which you believe the web has helped humanity cope with the pandemic, learn from the pandemic?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: Well, I suppose people, what people will remember will be we worked from home. When the only way you can work is to work from home, then clearly it’s about do you have a device? Do you have connectivity? One of the more relatively recent standards in a web is this web RTC, real time communication, which is the way we can sit in a webpage and have a video chat. So obviously, that’s been a huge part of it. Some of the interesting things to think about is, there’s always been the synchronous-asynchronous question. So if you’re teaching a class in person, it’s synchronous, they have to be in the same space, and then they have to be on the same time zone. If now they’ve gone home to their homes all over the world, they’re on different time zones, actually, that doesn’t work. But is it fair to prioritize synchronized if people are actually spread all over the world? I think the ways in which we can optimize between synchronous and asynchronous is interesting. I use Solid a lot for managing my life. I have lots of different to-do lists. We have a tracker of all the incoming requests for me to do things like this. So when the office of TBL sort of goes over those requests, and that shared state is really important. We can see which things we’ve said yes to and which things we said no to and which things we’re not sure about. So I think the, while synchronous communication maybe is something we’ve learned to do a lot more during the pandemic, we should now also really think about asynchronous communication as having a web of data, which captures the state of our company, of all the relationships in a company and its providers and suppliers, status of all of the relationships, the contracts, and the tasks, and so on. So in a way, one of the things I want to use Solid for is, I want everybody to be able to capture the way they collaborate, in particular, and especially the way they do democracy.\n\nNoshir Contractor: That’s really interesting, because in some ways, we were so fascinated with the ability of technology to enable synchronous communication that we have to, as you point out, now reimagine the virtues of asynchronicity and the ability it gives us to have an ambient awareness of a lot of various facets of our life.\n\nTim Berners-Lee: Yes, and you and I are having a nice synchronous communication. It was nice to chat to you, Nosh, but then actually, the reason we’re doing this is so that it will become a piece of audio. I’ve been listening to lots of podcasts and reading lots of blogs, and you can listen to something happily until somebody comes into the room, and then you have to start reading it. So one of the things I want us to be able to see is much more facility for moving between these modes. Can you get your technicians to produce this podcast so that there’s a printed version and a listened-to version such that I can switch between them at any point on the way. For us, it’s synchronous. For everybody else, it’s an asynchronous piece of, of a resource which they can go and use whoever they are, whenever they want. To be realistic, we have to maximize that side of the value.\n\nNoshir Contractor: And indeed, this podcast does have a transcript. And so if there are those who prefer to read it, rather than to listen to the conversation, they have the ability to do that. I take that point really seriously as a way of us reimagining what communication would be post-pandemic, whatever way, shape, or form that takes. Well, Tim, thank you, again, so much for taking time out of your extremely busy schedule to share with us some of the ways in which you not only invented the World Wide Web, but also have continued to nurture an ecosystem of institutions that are doing their best to keep this web decentralized. I look forward to our next opportunity to meet in person again. But in the meantime, I want to thank you so much again for taking time to talk with us about the web and your vision for it.\n\nTim Berners-Lee: It’s me that thanks you. Thanks for having me.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Untangling the Web is a production of the Web Science Trust. This episode was edited by Susanna Kemp. I am Noshir Contractor. You can find out more about our conversation today in the show notes. Thanks so much for listening to both this episode and all of our episodes over the last year and a half.\n\nEpisode 34 Transcript\n\nBrewster Kahle: We’re now going backwards and digitizing books, music, video. And we really want an open library system as opposed to a commercial answer to the whole thing. There’s so much wonderful things that are just not being read because they’re not that available, and people are going to read whatever it is they can get their hands on. Misinformation can be rife and just published out the wazoo.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Welcome to this episode of Untangling the Web, a podcast of the Web Science Trust. I am Noshir Contractor and I will be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in thought leaders to explore how the web is shaping society, and how society in turn is shaping the web. My guest today is Brewster Kahle, who you just heard talking about his vision to create an all-encompassing online archive.\n\nBrewster has spent his career intent on a singular focus: providing universal access to all knowledge. In 1989, he created the internet’s first publishing system, called Wide Area Information Server (WAIS for short), which he later sold to America Online. In 1996, he co-founded two sites to help catalog the web: Alexa Internet, which he sold to Amazon, and the Internet Archive. The Internet Archive is one of the largest libraries in the world and now preserves 99 unique Petabytes of data, books, web pages, music, television and software of our cultural heritage. In 2001, Brewster implemented the Wayback Machine, which allows public access to the World Wide Web archive that the Internet Archive has been gathering since 1996. Brewster was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2010. He’s also a member of the Internet Hall of Fame, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and serves on several boards. Welcome, Brewster.\n\nBrewster Kahle: Thank you. It’s great to be here.\n\nNoshir Contractor: This podcast, of course, is Untangling the Web. But when I think of you and everything you have been doing in your career, I think of you as somebody who’s contributed to help us rewinding the web rather than just untangling it. And in that spirit of the Wayback Machine, I want you to take us back to 1992 when you first came up with the idea of WAIS. Tell us what prompted that. And it’s important to note that in many ways, WAIS was a precursor to the World Wide Web.\n\nBrewster Kahle: Absolutely. The idea was of the internet, the opportunity was to build the library, well, of everything. Could you take the published works of humankind and make them available to anybody, but not just anybody, but any computer. Could we go and mush people, networks, and computers together? This was sort of the dream back in 1980 to try to figure out, how do we go and build this? First, we needed to go and build computers that actually could handle this. And Danny Hillis at MIT who I worked with had a great idea called the connection machine of making a supercomputer out of lots of little computers. And so I helped build that to go and try to make it so we could go and handle building the library of everything. And then I built WAIS and did that in 1989 and then made it publicly available for free on the internet in 1992, as you point out. The idea is to try to get publishing to go so that you don’t just have one big database of everything, you wanted to have people be able to have their own information in lots of different servers, a decentralized system. And that was the idea of WAIS. WAIS was kind of the search thing at that time.\n\nNoshir Contractor: So as you looked at it, the library that you were building was a distributed search and document retrieval system where documents could be distributed all over the internet. And what you were providing was an indexing system, in the parlance of library talk, and you were trying to see how one could search for these documents anywhere on the web and then how one could retrieve it. At the same time that you were thinking about WAIS and how it fed into the World Wide Web, you also were thinking about a different product called the Alexa Internet.\n\nBrewster Kahle: So WAIS helped get people online and made everyone able to become a publisher. And could you even, you know, control the distribution of your works? Could you even charge for it? We made the first subscription-based service on the internet. We made the first ad-based system on the early web to try to help make that all work. But once we got kind of the commercial side going by ‘94, ‘95, then the idea was, we could turn to build the library. So Alexa Internet and the Internet Archive started on the same day in 1996. And one was a for profit, and one was a nonprofit. And the for profit, Alexa Internet, was to catalog the web. So we could start crawling the whole World Wide Web and trying to find related links. The thought was that the search engines were going to give up steam, that the keywords weren’t going to be enough to get you the right document out of billions. Well, I was kind of wrong, because Google has done such a fabulous job. But we do really need some of these other things like related links, like if you’re looking at a webpage, tell me am I, like, is this crap or is this good? What else have people said about it? How long has it been there? If I’m looking for other things like it or maybe other points of view, what can I go see? Maybe it’s actually now that we have disinformation being broadcast so widely on the internet, that this technology that Alexa Internet was really designed to do was important. And the idea was also to go and leverage the link structure of the web and the usage trails of the web. And the idea then, also, for profits don’t last that long. So we said, okay, let’s go and build a contract into the soul of Alexa Internet that all the data that was collected would be put into this new nonprofit called the Internet Archive. So every day since 1996, it’s been donating data to the Internet Archive.\n\nNoshir Contractor: If I recall correctly, they announced that they’re shutting down Alexa in May of this year.\n\nBrewster Kahle: Oh, so sad. Yes. But it was a good 25 year run, which is a lot longer than most tech organizations, commercial ones, last, but nonprofits tend to last much longer.\n\nNoshir Contractor: One of the ways in which I first encountered Alexa was basically as a way of understanding web traffic. A lot of people who do web science research would use Alexa data, you can know a little bit about the status of a website, how well trafficked it is. And so that’s one piece of metadata that you might consider when you’re looking at a website. But as you point out, Alexa was also archiving the web. And when you say it was doing that every single day, help me understand. Does it take a snapshot of the internet every single day? Does it sample it and say, I’m going to do every part of the internet once every week or month? How does that work?\n\nBrewster Kahle: Let’s take the Internet Archive, this post-Alexa internet. What we do is, we have many different crawlers that basically go through the web – each one have different mandates. There are about 3,000 crawlers that run on any particular day, There are about 900 organizations now – libraries, archives, museums – that work with the Internet Archive, where they go and state particular mandates to these crawlers, that they say they want this particular subject area, they want this particular language, they want this particular whole country domain. They want it this deep, they want it this often. And a total of over a billion URLs every day get archived by the Internet Archive, to just try to keep up with what’s going on out there. Then we index it to make it available in lots of different ways, including the Wayback Machine.\n\nNoshir Contractor: So tell us a little bit about how the Wayback Machine sits in some ways on top of the Internet Archive.\n\nBrewster Kahle: We found that the average life of a webpage is about 100 days before it’s either changed or deleted. So we basically needed to try to keep up with that and then make all the out-of-print web pages available to people. So the way that the Wayback Machine works is completely simple. Fundamentally, it’s a line and a file for every URL we have. And it’s sorted based on the URL and the date. And every time somebody wants to look up a URL, we go and binary search this, well, multi-terabyte file to be able to find the most relevant page for that user. Or every GIF, every JPG, every JavaScript file is indexed in this way. And by running it in a parallel computer, much like the Connection Machine, we’re able to go and pull these out at 1000s of times per second, for the millions of users that use the Internet Archive’s resources every day.\n\nNoshir Contractor: As you know, there have been several movements around the world, especially from the European Union, to legalize the right to be forgotten. And I imagine that the archive might make it difficult for people to have the right to be forgotten. What are you doing in the archive in terms of addressing this issue?\n\nBrewster Kahle: Oh, yeah, a lot of the web was not really meant to be publicly available always. And so we take requests from people to remove things from the Wayback Machine, and those come in all the time from users, and you can write to info@archive.org and, you know, say what URLs or domain name, and then you have to try to prove that you own that so you can’t delete microsoft.com or something like that, and then it’s removed. And that seems to work pretty well.\n\nNoshir Contractor: I was struck by a comment that you wrote that for the cost of 60 miles of highway, we can have 10 million-book digital library available to a generation that is growing up reading on screen.\n\nBrewster Kahle: You know, being brought up during the tail end of the hippie generation, right, so the utopian “let’s build a better world,” I took that all very seriously and being a technologist tried to figure out what could we do. We thought, let’s start with what became the World Wide Web. But then also, let’s do television, radio. So we’re trying to get good at those. But we’re now going backwards and digitizing books, music, video. And we really want an open library system as opposed to a commercial answer to the whole thing. There’s so much wonderful things that are just not being read, because they’re not that available, and people are going to read whatever it is they can get their hands on. And this next generation is going to learn from whatever they can get. And it’s, a lot of it’s crap. Misinformation can be rife and just published out the wazoo by anybody with some budget, because a lot of the good materials are locked up behind paywalls, are still in print, or just, they haven’t really moved into the bigger picture of the opportunity of the internet. And so we’re gonna want to put the best we have to offer within the hands of our children.\n\nNoshir Contractor: So it sounds like while you began by trying to create an archive of the internet, you’re now moving more towards creating an archive on the internet.\n\nBrewster Kahle: It’s a good point. Absolutely. We’ve got maybe five or 6 million books that have been digitized. And we’re starting to do periodicals. First going and digitizing these for the blind and dyslexic. Then we make it somewhat available, you know, to, for instance, machine learning researchers, but also through borrowing, interlibrary loan, controlled digital lending, those sorts of things. You shouldn’t have to be at Yale to be able to see some of these good works.\n\nNoshir Contractor: At the end of the day, even what is digitized is being supported on some material resource, whether it’s a disk drive or something else. I recall reading that you were inspired by the Global Seed Vault idea of trying to keep one physical copy of perhaps every book. Now maybe it’s not a physical copy as in papyrus or paper, but a digital storage record. And talk a little bit about the fragility of all of these different media that we have, starting with paper, but including many of the servers that you have and how often you have to be careful to make sure that those servers don’t get obsolete or die.\n\nBrewster Kahle: I mean, it’s such a problem. You see these beautiful pieces of papyrus from 5000 years ago, it’s great. But it seems like it’s getting shorter and shorter. So some of these new technologies like microfilm and microfiche, they were reported that they could last 500 years. And so we’re starting to collect the microfilm and microfiche not only to preserve the microfilm, microfiche, but to then also digitize it. So we’re moving forward, but we’re always keeping the physical materials. The Internet Archive works with other libraries that have these large physical archives to keep these.\n\nNoshir Contractor: You have also argued that the value of digital archives is not just historians, but also to help resolve common infrastructure complaints about the internet, such as adding reliability to 404 document not found. Tell us a little bit more about what you see as the value in that space.\n\nBrewster Kahle: Yeah, at least let’s fix some of the bugs on the web. The 404 document not found is just bad engineering. We made a little extension that you can add to your browser such that if any of a number of errors come up, then we’ll probe the Internet Archive Wayback Machine and see if it’s got it. I think, also, the big opportunity is thinking at scale. My friend Jesse Ausubel put it: humanity got a long way with a microscope; What we need now is a macroscope, an ability to step back, understand the bigger trends. There’s a great interface on top of the Television Archive that’s just the transcripts that were taken by a fellow named Kalev, and he made GDELT, and you can go and do queries to find out terms, how much were they on one cable channel versus another over time, and you can start to see biases in these bubbles by stepping back and getting a bigger picture of what’s going on. I think that’s absolutely critical. People are very good at getting excited about some tweet or blog posts or Facebook something or other, some cable news, dramatic whatever. And it’s difficult to put it in context. If there would be a wish that I’d have for the next 10 years of web science and the like, is let’s build context into our online experience. So that’s not necessarily fact checking. It’s, what were the debates around it? What’s the information around it? It’s all the sorts of things that scientists in the academic publishing used to know about before the paywall sort of took over. This, this whole approach, I think we need to bring that to a much broader population.\n\nNoshir Contractor: In many ways, what you’re talking about is a much more nuanced version of what we sometimes call metadata, that is, data about the data in this particular case.\n\nBrewster Kahle: So Bill Dunn was one of my mentors. He did the electronic side of Dow Jones. He was the first purchaser of a Connection Machine to go and do full text search. And he had this saying back in the mid-80s that the metadata is more important than the data itself. And that’s what Google leveraged with their anchor text and PageRank. It’s what Alexa did by looking at user trails to be able to find: people that like this webpage, what web pages did they like even more? The importance of the internet is not the computers at the edges, it’s that we’re all connected.\n\nNoshir Contractor: So you mentioned GDELT as being an example of a repository that has become incredibly helpful to scientists, including web scientists, to study ways in which information is flowing and how it impacts public opinion and so on. Given that you have built this incredible Internet Archive, and given that there are so many people who are using it to help understand society today and how it has been in the past, can you share with us some of the most interesting insights that you have learned from what you or others have found by using the Internet Archive as a way of studying society?\n\nBrewster Kahle: Oh, I wish I had more time to go and study society. Mostly I’m just a librarian building the darn thing. We went and studied all of the political ads in the United States to understand the wash of money that’s going over the media system based on Citizens United and other decisions by the United States to allow corporations to pay for politicians. And it’s fascinating to see how much money and just the barrage of ads that you would get if you were in a battleground state. I mean, you couldn’t flip channels fast enough to not be seeing an ad at all times. So there are these things you can kind of see by stepping back. Let’s see. The World Wide Web made it so that you could take unpopular websites and they could become popular, which is a really good sign for going and having an ecosystem that’s alive. When you get too much either regulation or too many monopolies going and controlling things, a lot of that will slow down and stop. And I’m very excited about the decentralized web technologies. Let’s see another round or two of these to go and put people back in charge of some of these technologies rather than just these very large corporations that have started to take over whole media types. Let’s build open systems that lots of people can play. I like games with many winners.\n\nNoshir Contractor: It sounds a bit like history repeating itself, because when the World Wide Web and WAIS and other technologies were spawning, it was also in response to corporations at the time, think of companies like AT&T, for example. The mantra was decentralized. Now we are saying we want a new wave of decentralized technologies. So was there a cycle where this decentralization gave way to a certain level of centralized authority that we now need to renew our efforts at decentralizing the web.\n\nBrewster Kahle: We certainly need to renew our efforts. But the decentralization never needed to come. If you actually had government antitrust law that was actually, you know, used as much as it was before 1980 when things started to collapse in terms of antitrust, then I think we would have had an ecosystem without having to go through revolutions. And I’m hoping that we invent something better.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Speaking of inventing something better, I was fascinated by a recent blog posting by you titled “Imagining the Internet: Explaining our Digital Transition.” My understanding here is that you have talked about the different metaphors that we have used to talk about the internet from the time it began. Tell us a little bit about what those metaphors are and how you see us trying to imagine the internet of the future.\n\nBrewster Kahle: If we’re trying to, you know, look forward, I find looking backwards and seeing the trajectory we’re on to try to understand where we were going might be useful. So what I did is I went and tried to look at what was the metaphors that people had for the internet and tried to track that change over time, if you will. So the first one, I would say, would be the library. But then it moved and it started to become other things, like, just portrayals of a raw network. I would say then cyberspace was a term that people use. So it was far away. Then it started coming home towards being a frontier, the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It was a wild west and it had to be navigated. Then there was information superhighway. We moved to surfing. So now, it’s not just some place out there. But now you can experience it, you can ride on it, you can use it. Then I would say the next one was the Facebook, right? The idea of the Borg. Your cell phone was glued to your face. So now, where does it go from here? I would say, the thing we’re wrestling with around now is algorithms. If that’s where we are, then what happens next? And I would say machines are starting to not need us anymore. [The machines sort of detach.] In The Matrix in ‘99, Agent Smith has this terrific rant about people being a disease.\n\nNoshir Contractor: That does paint a somewhat dark picture of where we are headed.\n\nBrewster Kahle: I mean, you can’t see a movie these days without it being frickin’ dystopian. People are anxious. They are really worried about what’s going on. They are not feeling in control. I would like to make it so people have a feeling that they’ve got some level of control of what it is they’re reading, what it is they’re writing, where it’s going, their privacy, their sense of self, their friends. And we have done almost everything we can to strip that away from them. I do like the Alan Kay “don’t predict the future, go and invent it.? We as technologists should do a better job than just go to, “Hey, let’s go make a ton of money and be like a rich internet mogul.” Let’s leave a better environment for people to be the most they can be, they can be creative and feel safe and achieve and build and grow. That’s what our technologies and our internet should be for.\n\nNoshir Contractor: And that’s a wonderful place to end this conversation. A very upbeat note, very inspiring. Brewster, thank you so much again for joining us and for all the work that you’ve done in helping us to understand the archive of the internet and to, as I said, to rewind the web and the Wayback Machine. I would certainly recommend folks take a look at the blog entry that Brewster has just been summarizing at brewster.kahle.org as well as play with the Wayback Machine if you haven’t. It’s a lot of fun and somewhat embarrassing to go back and see what kind of websites we created back in the ‘90s and also in the early part of the century. So thank you again, Brewster so much for joining us today.\n\nBrewster Kahle: Thank you very much, Noshir.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Untangling the Web is a production of the Web Science Trust.

Thanks for listening.\n\nEpisode 33 Transcript\n\nHoward Rheingold: I ended up creating a course called “social media issues” around my book Net Smart. My answer to Is this any good for us? has been, it depends on what people know, that it’s no longer a matter of hardware or software or regulation or policy. It has to do with who knows how to use this medium well. And I felt that if you mastered these five fundamental literacies or fluencies, that you would do better.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Welcome to this episode of Untangling the Web, a podcast of the Web Science Trust. I am Noshir Contractor and I will be your host today. On this podcast we bring in thought leaders to explore how the web is shaping society, and how society in turn is shaping the web. My guest today is Howard Rheingold, who you just heard talking about how we can use media responsibly.\n\nHoward is an American critic, writer, and teacher. He specializes in the cultural, social, and political implications of modern communication media, such as the internet, mobile telephony, and virtual communities. In the mid 80s, he worked on and wrote about the earliest personal computers at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center or Xerox PARC, for short. He was also one of the early users of the Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link or The WELL, an influential early online community. And in 1994, he was hired as the founding executive director of HotWired. He is the author of several books, including The Virtual Community, Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution, and Net Smart: How to Thrive Online. Welcome, Howard.\n\nHoward Rheingold: Good to be here.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Howard, you were one of the folks who was there, even before the birth of the web, and certainly at the birth of the personal computer and the very first online communities. Take us back to what things were at Xerox PARC, where so many important things were invented that helped shape the web that was yet to come.\n\nHoward Rheingold: I found my way to Xerox PARC because I heard that you could edit writing on a television-like screen with a computer. And I had been a freelance writer for 10 years at that point, and my technology was a correcting electric typewriter, which meant that you could white out the last line that you wrote. And people who lived through that era know that you marked up your pages, and sometimes you literally cut and paste them, and then at a certain point, you had to retype them, which is really a pain. If you’re going to write a book of 400 pages, you probably retyped 3000 pages. I found an article in the 1977 Scientific American titled “Microelectronics and the Personal Computer” by Alan Kay, and it had images of what he called a Dynabook of the future, pretty much an iPad. I called and asked if there was any writing jobs that they needed at PARC. Eventually, I got the job of roaming around and finding interesting people and writing about them, and then the Xerox PR department would place it in magazines. I drove half an hour from my home in San Francisco every day so that I could work on their computer there.\n\nWhen ARPA decided they only wanted to do defense-related research, all of these smart young researchers came to Xerox, because they hired Bob Taylor and they gave him $100 million in 10 years before he had to produce anything, and so he got all of these superstars, really superstars, in one place. I mean, they ended up creating not only the visual interface for the personal computer we know today, but also the laser printer and the local area network. My research tools were a typewriter, a telephone, and a library card. I was interested in extending those capabilities. And then I met Doug Engelbart. Engelbart was talking about using the computer to extend human cognitive capabilities – augmentation, he called it. I’m interested in the intersection of technology and the mind.\n\nIt occurred to me in 1983, I think it was, Time magazine made the personal computer the person of the year, and I thought, boy, there’s a much bigger story here to be told. So I wrote a book called Tools for Thought. And I wrote a chapter about what was happening online. The internet didn’t exist yet. The ARPANET did. And I got a modem, and I plugged my telephone and my computer into it. And that’s when I discovered the WELL, which had been started by the Whole Earth people. The WELL was like three dollars an hour. And I got totally sucked up into that. And I tell the story in my book, my wife became concerned that I was spending so much time having fun online. And I wrote an article for the Whole Earth Review in 1986 or 1987 on virtual communities. And I wrote that because so many people had been saying, or implying to me, that there’s something pathological about communicating with people you don’t already know through computer networks. And I had seen that all the things that happen in a real face-to-face community, you know, people meet and fall in love and get married, people get divorced, there were funerals and parties, and we passed a hat when people were having hard times, we sat by people’s bedsides when they were dying. So that’s why I wrote about virtual community. I discovered that this diverse group of people I could connect with through a computer, not because we knew each other, but because we had similar interests, could really serve as an online think tank for me and help amplify my ability to learn about the things that I was writing about. So I became interested professionally with this as a tool, but also as a writer, I became interested in where is this all leading? What is this all doing to us as individuals and as communities and societies?\n\nAnd because I wrote enthusiastically back then, a lot of people since then have set me up as kind of a straw man utopian. But in fact, if you read the last chapter of my book The Virtual Community, it’s called Disinformocracy. I’ve been writing about what might go wrong as well for a long time. And I think it’s important to have a nuanced view of technology, that it’s okay for someone who’s critical to also be enthusiastic. Another thing I’ve always been interested in is how can you look at the signals that we see today and make some kind of extrapolations about the future? So, back in The WELL, we thought, what we were very enthusiastic about, a few 100 people, that this was going to be a big deal someday. And back then it was like words on the screen. But we knew that someday there would be the processing power and the bandwidth for us to have audio and video and graphics. And so I’ve just had a fortunate position in time and space being in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1970s and 1980s to be a participant observer.\n\nNoshir Contractor: And you were not alone. There were so many other people. I mean, you had this fascination for using the tools for your own trade, but then also using that same curiosity to project further not just how it was going to help you at that point in time, but how these tools, the computers, the mouse, what was happening at Xerox PARC and The WELL, had the potential to transform society. Several people were in a similar situation to you. What do you think motivated you to say, no, I really see something special happening here, and I’m going to write about it, whether it’s to evangelize, or as you point out also, point out cautionary aspects about it.\n\nHoward Rheingold: I thought, here is something very important happening. People recognize something important is happening. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, they knew what Xerox PARC was doing. They adopted it. I thought it was very important because this was our consciousness and our capacity to think and communicate meeting our ability to build technologies that are very powerful. And you know, one thing that I think we the human race noticed from the nuclear physicists and the bomb was that human ability to create powerful technology seems to be racing ahead of our ability to know what to do with them morally and ethically. And so it struck me that big changes were going to come. When I was writing The Virtual Community, I found a graduate student at UCLA, his name was Marc Smith, a sociologist. He was studying Usenet, and I asked him, why do people give information away to other people that they don’t really know? He said, “knowledge capital, social capital, and communion.” That was a great lens for looking at things.\n\nSo fast forward to 1999, 2000. I’m in Tokyo. I noticed that people are walking around looking at their telephones. They’re not listening to them, they’re looking at them. A couple of weeks later, I happened to be in Helsinki, other side of the world, and I noticed some teenagers looking at their phones and showing their phones to each other. What was going on here? Those were signals. 1999, the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle was disrupted by protesters who used the internet to coordinate. In the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, the president, was deposed after mass demonstrations were organized spontaneously using SMS, which wasn’t happening in the U.S. in 2000. It really took off after the iPhone in 2007. So I asked Marc, what’s going on here? And he said, it looks like the merger of the telephone and the internet was lowering the barriers for collective action. So, you know, like any good freelance writer, I went and did some research. Trying to find social scientists to help me understand what the signals meant was really part of this process of looking at the future.\n\nI was saying, the computer, the telephone and the network are merging into a new medium. We don’t really have a name for it yet. Well, now we call it the smartphone. But that ability, I thought, would signal another kind of phase change in the world in which people were able to organize collective action in the physical world through their connection online. I guess you would say that the insurrection of January 6th was an example of that, as well. So again, throughout this process, the question of Is this stuff any good for us? kept arising. I started teaching, I guess about 2005, because I saw college students were using these. But the universities, you couldn’t take a course on What does it mean? anywhere. They invited me to teach this course on digital journalism at Stanford. I noticed that there were very few teachers using forums and wikis and blogs. Because I was teaching about social media, you know, it only made sense that we use that social media in the process of doing. I ended up creating a course called Social Media Issues around my book Net Smart. My answer to Is this any good for us? has been, it depends on what people know, that it’s no longer a matter of hardware or software or regulation or policy, it has to do with who knows how to use this medium well. And I felt that if you mastered these five fundamental literacies or fluencies, that you would do better.\n\nNoshir Contractor: And when you said how to use a social media well, you parse that into how to use the social media intelligently, humanely, and above all, mindfully.\n\nHoward Rheingold: Yeah. So what are these five essential literacies? Attention, crap detection, participation, collaboration, and network awareness. I start with attention. The bad news is that the business model of the web has to do with attracting and engaging and maintaining your attention so that they can sell you things. And the people who are engineering these apps are very good at doing that, and we’re all suckers. The good news is that there’s ample evidence both from millennia-old contemplative traditions and from neuroscience that you can begin to understand how to deploy your attention more productively, something called metacognition. So one of the things I taught my students was, you know, becoming aware of where you put your attention is important.\n\nSo that was the first chapter, but then I told the story of my daughter when she was in middle school, this was before Google, but she was using search engines. She was beginning to put queries in to do her homework. And I sat her down and said, I showed her a website called martinlutherking.org. I think that they’ve changed their identity. But it’s actually run by white nationalists. And I showed her how to find that out, that you can go to the library and get out a book, and that book was edited, it was published, it was purchased for your library, it was assigned by your teacher. Each of those were kind of gatekeepers to kind of guarantee that what you’re reading is accurate. You can now ask any question anywhere, anytime and get a million answers in a second. But it’s now up to you to determine which of those are accurate information, because a lot of them are wrong. So crap detection comes from Hemingway saying every journalist should have a good internal crap detector.\n\nAnd then the next one was participation. And we really wouldn’t be having this conversation about the web if it wasn’t for participation. It was created by millions of people who put up websites and put up links to other websites. From the Google twins to Mark Zuckerberg, people invent things in their dorm rooms, and it changes the world. And part of that is the miracle of the architecture of the internet. You don’t have to get permission to start a new search engine or social network, as long as it operates according to the technical protocols of the internet. You just need people to come to your website.\n\nSo when I wrote Smart Mobs, I became interested in dynamics of collective action. How humans cooperate and what the barriers to cooperation are is probably at the root of our most significant global problems, from climate change to nuclear weapons to interstate conflict to land management. Elinor Ostrom won her Nobel Prize because she came up with design principles that if a group that was managing a scarce resource used these design principles, they would succeed.\n\nNoshir Contractor: You were amongst the first who introduced or at least popularized the term collective intelligence: when all of us can be smarter than any of us. Today, there’s a lot more interest in collective intelligence. There are conferences on the topic, centers around the world studying it. But again here, there was a signal that you picked up on before others.\n\nHoward Rheingold: It was pretty obvious even back in The WELL. You got a group of people together, you could solve problems together online. Going back to Engelbart. Engelbart was not primarily interested in hardware and software. He was interested in, – and he used these words, “increasing the collective intelligence of organizations,” collective IQ, he called it.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Net Smart talked about five fundamental digital literacies. And we talked about attention, crap detection, participation, collective intelligence. Can you talk a little bit about the fifth one – the network smarts?\n\nHoward Rheingold: Although we’re used to the term “social network” in response to Facebook, social networks are something that precede technology by a long ways. The way I would describe it is, well, your family, your friends, your teachers, your neighbors, those are your community. The person you buy coffee from, the stranger you see when you’re walking your dog, the people you communicate with online, those are your network. They don’t all know each other. In a community, people know each other. Way back when Marc Smith told me about knowledge capital, social capital, and communion, one of the things that I taught my students was how social capital is cultivated and harvested online. The traditional definition of social capital is the ability of groups of people to get things done together outside of formal mechanisms like laws, governments, corporations, and contracts. If you are a farmer and you have good relationships with your neighbors and you break your leg, your neighbors will come in and help you with your harvest. Well, there’s a lot of social capital to be had online if you know what you’re doing. I learned this way back in The WELL. I learned, if somebody has a question and I have the answer, even if I don’t know that person, doesn’t cost me anything to give them the answer. Well, if you get several hundred people together who have different kinds of expertise and they all do that, suddenly, everybody is empowered. But you know what, people aren’t gonna give you answers unless you give answers yourself. I think anybody who is in a support group online knows about that.\n\nNoshir Contractor: You can’t go there and simply want to take things from other people and not also then contribute to the public good.\n\nHoward Rheingold: Oh, that’s right. When you study human cooperation, what’s called altruistic punishment is a big part of that. It’s not just laws that enable people to live together, it’s norms. Why do you get angry when someone cuts ahead of you in line? It’s because they’re breaking the norm, and you feel that you need to enforce that.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Yeah. So in closing, then Howard, I want to go back to something that you’ve done so well over the last several decades, and that is detect signals and use those to project what’s coming down the pike. What are the signals that you’re detecting today that might tell us about what is going to happen in the next couple of decades?\n\nHoward Rheingold: I think the most important one is the disintegration of consensus about what’s real and what’s not. Misinformation seems to travel much faster than corrections. The anti-vax movement worldwide is a good example. You know, the Enlightenment came along and said, well, let’s not have theological arguments about what causes disease, let’s use microscopes and see if we can discover the physical causes of it, so relying on science and coming to some kind of consensus about what we all agree it’s real. That seems to be in big question. That’s a very troubling signal to me.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Does this also have implications for another term that you spent a lot of time thinking and writing about: virtual reality or augmented reality? And what is real or not real in that context?\n\nHoward Rheingold: I spent some time in Second Life, which is not immersive, but a kind of metaverse. There were people doing very interesting things, but it was not the next big thing. I don’t think people are gonna want to have avatar meetings and buy avatar groceries and socialize to the degree that the Metaverse vision from Facebook is promulgating. I just don’t think it’s going to appeal to everybody that way. I also think that there’s some problems. In Second Life, there were what were called griefers. You would be having a seminar and a bunch of flying penises would disrupt it. I think we’re going to see that kind of disruption in the Metaverse, and we’ve seen that Facebook has been unable to moderate even in its two-dimensional form. What would be really interesting in something like that would be a molecular biologist taking you through a walkthrough of a ribosome, an archaeologist taking you on a walkthrough of the pyramids to do things in three dimensions that you can’t do any other way. And I know that they’re using it for things like protein folding these days. And I think that being able to navigate and manipulate a three-dimensional world has research and educational implications that really have not been tapped.\n\nNoshir Contractor: It’s been a real delight, Howard, hearing from you as somebody who was witness to the birth of many of these technologies, and you have done a great job of envisioning so many of the phenomena that we have been experiencing and perhaps we should have paid more attention to you when you first raised it, then we might not have found ourselves in some of the predicaments that we do today. I also obviously want to thank you for all your work as an educator, helping to make the next generation more network smart than we were. So thanks again for joining me today, Howard. It’s been a real pleasure.\n\nHoward Rheingold: Mine too.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Untangling the Web is a production of the Web Science Trust. This episode was edited by Susanna Kemp. I am Noshir Contractor. You can find out more about our conversation today in the show notes. Thanks for listening.\n\nEpisode 32 Transcript\n\nSafiya Noble: I have found in my own community, as a, you know, Black woman living in Los Angeles watching so many different kinds of predictive technologies, predictive policing, experimented upon my own community, that I think we have to abolish many of these technologies, and we actually have to understand to what degree are digital technologies implicated in some of the most horrific forms of violence and inhumanity.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Welcome to this episode of Untangling the Web, a podcast of the Web Science Trust. I am Noshir Contractor and I will be your host today. On this podcast we bring in thought leaders to explore how the web is shaping society, and how society in turn is shaping the web. My guest today is Dr. Safiya Noble, an associate professor of Gender Studies and African American Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. She is the co-founder and faculty director of the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry, an interdisciplinary research center focused on the intersection of human rights, social justice, democracy and technology. She is the author of the best-selling book Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism. Safiya was also the recipient of a 2021 MacArthur Foundation fellowship. Her nonprofit community work to foster civil and human rights, the expansion of democracy, and intersectional racial justice is developing at the Equity Engine. Welcome, Safiya.\n\nSafiya Noble: Hi. First of all, I just want to say thanks so much for having me on the podcast today. This is such a thrill and such an honor to be in conversation with you.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Thanks for joining us here today. Safiya, your book about the algorithms of oppression focuses on search engines. And you talk about your experience using these search engines and recognizing very quickly that they are not quite as objective and neutral as one might like to believe they are.\n\nSafiya Noble: A decade ago, I was thinking about large scale digital media platforms. And I had kind of spent my whole first career in advertising and marketing. And as I was leaving the ad industry and going back to graduate school, it was so interesting to me the way that people were talking about search engines at the university. So I was at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the information school there. Lycos, and Google and Yahoo, you know, these new technologies were amazing the way that they were indexing the web. But I also had just left this experience of trying to game these systems for my clients when I was in advertising. So really, I understood them as media systems. We were buying ads and trying to optimize. We were hiring, like, programmers to come into the agency and, like, help us get this General Motors ad up on the first listing, things like that. So it was interesting to kind of come into the academy and study search engines in particular, because I was just so fascinated by them. They were just kind of so banal and non-interesting compared to social networking sites that were coming into vogue. And it was kind of in this inquiry that I started doing searches and looking to see what kind of results we get. And one day I just kind of stumbled upon searching for Black girls. You know, I’m a Black woman. My daughter at the time was a tween. I realized that when you search on Black girls, you were met with almost exclusively pornography. And I was thinking about like, what does it mean that you don’t have to add the word “sex,” you don’t have to add the word “porn,” but Black girls themselves, that phrase is synonymous with hyper sexualization. This was kind of like a sexism 101, racism 101. And that really was the thread that I started pulling on that led to the book Algorithms of Oppression.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Are you suggesting that the reason the search engines were privileging these kinds of search results is because that actually reflected something that was happening in society already and it was simply being amplified here? Or was this some other kind of manipulation that resulted in those?\n\nSafiya Noble: That’s the question, right? I mean, I think that the prevailing logic at the time, 10 years ago, was that whatever we found in technology was purely a reflection of society, right, that the tech itself, those mechanisms were neutral, and that if you found these aberrations, it was because people were misusing the technology and that’s what was becoming reflected back. And I felt like that was an insufficient answer. Because I knew from my previous career, we had spent time trying to figure out how to manipulate these technologies. So I knew that if they were gamable, that that was a design choice or a set of kind of business imperatives.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Sometimes referred to innocuously as search engine optimization, which was a term that was used at the time.\n\nSafiya Noble: It was interesting, because search engine optimization was kind of a nascent industry. And then, you know, our beloved colleague Siva Vaidhyanathan wrote this incredible book called The Googlization of Everything: (And Why We Should Worry). I felt like, this is the jumping off, this book is actually the place now that I can go even more specific about how this skews in these kind of historically racist and sexist ways toward vulnerable people, toward communities of color, toward women and girls under the guise of being neutral, normal, and apolitical.\n\nNoshir Contractor: During the COVID crisis, we see algorithms now are also playing a sinister role in the propagation of information, not just in terms of giving us search results. Talk about some of the work that you have been concerned about with regards to how algorithms were employed by university hospitals in terms of guiding vaccine distribution.\n\nSafiya Noble: This was one of the most egregious, I think, examples of a kind of distorted logics that are embedded into a lot of different kinds of software that we use every day and really don’t think twice about. So you know, there was this story that kind of went viral pretty quickly about how the vaccine during COVID-19 would be distributed. And of course, we had so many frontline workers who desperately needed that. And Stanford University Hospital, in the heart of Silicon Valley right, you have the hospital that deploys an algorithmic decision making tool to determine who should get the vaccine first. They determine that the algorithm suggests a group of people that happen to be people who are retired doctors, who are at home, who are mostly protected. We have to look and understand the data, the logics that are imbued into the different kinds of systems that we are making ubiquitous, because they will inevitably have huge consequence.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Concurrent to that we also saw an infodemic. You’ve talked about the role of the algorithms and the propaganda in terms of escalating violence against Asian Americans.\n\nSafiya Noble: One of the things we want to remember is this dynamic interplay between social media and search. During the Trump administration, he was one of the greatest propagators of racist propaganda against Asians and Asian Americans by invoking sarcasm and hostility toward our communities, and in suggesting that Asian Americans and South Asians and really Asians throughout the diaspora were responsible for Coronavirus, right. And so this, of course, we know, also elicited incredible violence. If you come across something like racist propaganda against Asian and Asian American communities in social media, on Facebook, you might go and turn to a search engine to query whether it’s true. And this of course becomes extremely dangerous, because we know that search engines also are likely to be flooded with disinformation and propaganda too. Using something like Google as a fact checker for propaganda, and then having that propaganda be made visible to you, only confirms the dangerous kinds of ideas that you might be experiencing or exposed to.\n\nNoshir Contractor: So there is almost a symbiotic relationship between what propagates in social media and then what shows up on your search results. One example that you’ve talked about is how Dylann Roof was influenced by reading white nationalist websites before massacring nine African American church goers.\n\nSafiya Noble: Yes, that’s right. What we know is that the most titillating and often egregious – which includes racist and sexist propaganda against religious minorities and sexual minorities – this kind of material on the web is actually very, very engaging. It’s fashioned many times like clickbait, so that it looks like it could be kind of true. And this is one of the main arguments that I really try to make in my work, which is that it is not just a matter of the fact that people are clicking on it, because guess what, people who are against that kind of material are also clicking on it, trying to understand what in the world is going on. But every one of those clicks really translates to profits. It will, in fact, contribute quite handsomely to the bottom line for many of these companies.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Which takes you back to your initial profession, in the ad business.\n\nSafiya Noble: Right. Publicly traded companicompasses are required to maximize shareholder investment and profit at all costs, so there is no social responsibility, there is no social justice in the frameworks of Wall Street. I think we’re seeing now a decade of the results of that kind of misplaced value in our society.\n\nNoshir Contractor: A lot of the tech industry engages in some pretty brazen experiments where they try to engage in some kind of an intervention where they would experiment with a particular kind of manipulation for a day. And you’ve compared that to something that would not be allowed in industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, in the tobacco industry.\n\nSafiya Noble: The way in which Silicon corridors around the world are able to articulate their work is shrouded in math, science, engineering. We have to be careful about how we deploy even words and frameworks like science, that get used as a shield sometimes right for some of the most egregious kinds of products and services. I heard the investigative journalists who broke the story about Compass, the recidivism prediction software, right, that is profoundly racist, predicting African Americans, I think it was like at a four or five times the rate of white people who were arrested, to go back to jail or to stay in prison. They had all these boxes of paper documents to prove how the harm was happening. And the programmers, they didn’t want to hear it. And I remember sitting on this panel, in fact, it was at Stanford, with these journalists. I thought to myself, you know, we would never let three guys rent some space in a strip mall like those guys, and cook up some drugs and roll it out in pharmacies, right and then when people die or people are harmed, we say, “Hey, it’s just chemistry. Chemistry can’t be dangerous,” right? Like, we would never do that. So why is it that in the tech industry, we allow this kind of deep belief in the neutrality of these technologies without realizing that so many people have personally been harmed. And I think that we have to look at other industries, even like the era of big cotton, you know, during the transatlantic slave trade. We had many, many arguments during that era, where people said, you know, “We can’t do away with the institution of slavery and the enslavement of African people and Indigenous people, because the American economies are built on it, it’s impossible, our economy would collapse.” And that is actually the same kind of discourse that we use today. And I think there’s a lot to learn from these other historical moments, and figure out how we will shift the paradigm as we did for those other industries.\n\nNoshir Contractor: That includes the abolitionist movement as well as a historical precedent.\n\nSafiya Noble: Absolutely. When I set out a decade ago to work in this area, and to think about these things, I didn’t think of myself at the time as being, like, an abolitionist. I thought I was curious in doing this inquiry, and I knew that there was something unjust happening, and I wanted to sort it out. And now I can truly say that there are so many technologies that are deployed that are made with no oversight, with no regulatory framework. I have found in my own community, as a, you know, Black woman living in watching so many different kinds of predictive technologies, predictive policing, experimented upon my own community, that I think we have to abolish many of these technologies. And we actually have to understand to what degree are digital technologies implicated in some of the most horrific forms of violence and inhumanity. Doing this work for 10 years has definitely moved me to the place of thinking of myself as kind of an abolitionist in the sense that, like during the transatlantic slave trade and during the institution of slavery, it really was a small handful of people that were persistent about the moral and ethical failings of the economic and kind of religious political system that was holding up such an inhumane set of business practices and social practices and political practices for centuries. And I think it will be those of us who are trying to point to these dangerous moves, that probably we will be articulated as some type of abolitionists in this sector, trying to raise attention to the costs, the long term costs.\n\nNoshir Contractor: How does one bring a more concerted way of addressing all of these injustices?\n\nSafiya Noble: We need the structural changes, we need different laws, we need different policies. The law, it’s not the only thing. But it certainly is very important. What I worry about with predictive analytics is that so much information is collected on people that then is used to determine whether they will have an opportunity, but also to foreclose opportunities. And of course, you know, we have to think about each of us. Imagine our worst moments of our lives. And I think, what if that moment is the snapshot in time, collected about me and that determines, it’s a no-go for Safiya Noble, right? And of course, it also forecloses any possibility of redemption, of forgiveness, of empathy, of learning, of change. And I think we don’t want to live in a society without those qualities. And predictive analytics really forecloses the opportunity for being known, for changing, and for having a high quality of life. Cathy O’Neil says in her book, Weapons of Math Destruction, she says, predictive analytics make things much better for people who are already doing great, and much worse for people who are already not doing well. And I think we want to take that heed seriously.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Technology has had a history of widening the knowledge gap and the information gap in society. And so this is a natural progression of what has preceded it. One of the things you have also discussed as a way of addressing some of the issues you just talked about was proposing an awareness campaign and digital amnesty legislation to combat the harms perpetuated by algorithmic bias.\n\nSafiya Noble: When I was a graduate student, I was thinking about what happens when you are ensnared in a search engine, for example, and you can’t fight your way out of it, right, your name is destroyed. And of course, we have legislation in the EU like the right to be forgotten, that helps address this, right. We don’t have this yet in the United States. Every engagement we have on the web is bought, sold, traded by 1000s of companies. So how do we withdraw? How do we pull ourselves out of these systems? How do we create amnesty out of these situations? I’ve been trying to talk to lawmakers in California about what would it mean when we do pass our own kind of localized versions of GDPR? I love this article written by Jean-François Blanchette and his collaborators about the social value of forgetting, like why we seal juvenile records, so that those mistakes don’t follow you into the future. So how do we grapple with that now in this global web? Could we imagine and reimagine the way in which we appear? I once heard the director of the FBI, and he was at a conference, and he said, “As far as the government is concerned, who you are is your digital profile.” Can you imagine? I mean, people like us who study the worst parts of the web, who are on the internet looking at terrible things all the time. All the things we’re doing on the internet, nothing could be further from the truth about who I am as a person.\n\nNoshir Contractor: That’s a really important point, because we celebrate the fact that now we can store and put into memory everything. But you’re pointing out the perverse aspects of keeping that memory always available to everyone. And you worked with engineers, executives, artists, and policymakers to think through these broader ramifications of how technology is built, how does it get deployed, and how most importantly, does it get used in unfair ways?\n\nSafiya Noble: I think one of the most impactful organizations that I’ve been able to be a part of and on the board of is the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, which is really the organization that has helped develop and pass all of the non-consensual pornography or revenge porn laws that we have in the United States. I think that’s a place that actively engages with trust and safety staff in large tech companies to try and help them understand truly the cost of their algorithmic distortions of people, many times young women. I have many relationships into Silicon Valley. The benefit of having had my whole first career in corporate America for 15 years before being an academic is I really understand, when you work in a large global company, you’re one person like sometimes on the Titanic, and it’s going down, and you can’t actually stop it yourself. You know, you’re trying to figure out how to leverage and work across all kinds of teams and all kinds of people. I don’t only stay in academic and, kind of, activist spaces, or community spaces, I also go into these corporate spaces, and I try to talk about the work and give them the examples and challenge them to think differently. And I do think that now, if I look out at engineering programs, you see slowly schools changing, and that means that that’s because industry is also saying, maybe we need people who have some background and experience in social sciences and humanities, too.\n\nNoshir Contractor: But you are saying that in general, you find many of them to be receptive to these ideas and willing to be educated about these issues?\n\nSafiya Noble: Absolutely. I think there are a lot of people who do not want to look back and feel that they are on the wrong side of history, that they didn’t ask tough enough questions, that they took for granted the wrong assumptions. I can tell you in the classroom, for sure, as I train engineering and computer science students who take my classes, 10 years ago, they were hostile to the idea that their work had any political value. And now, traditionally aged undergraduates are completely clear when they enter the field, and they’re here to change it.\n\nNoshir Contractor: So in addition to the work you do with corporate America, as well as activism, you’ve also rubbed shoulders with celebrities. Meghan Markle has cited Algorithms of Oppression as key to understanding the online vitriol that was spewed about her.\n\nSafiya Noble: I got this email that said, you know, “Please save the date to meet with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.” And I thought it was like a scam email. Okay, long story short, it was real. They had been given my book by my former dean from USC. Meghan, I think she really saw an explanation for the incredible racist and sexist vitriol that she’s experienced on the internet. You know, the way that I could articulate how Black women and women of color become fodder for destruction, almost like as a sport on the internet, I think she really, she had experienced herself. And sent here was someone explaining that this is actually a business imperative for companies. And so they have given, you know, resources to the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry. Bot Sentinel, just, you know, issued a couple of really important reports that showed how just a few dozen high impact accounts on social media were coordinated to basically try to destroy their family, destroy them. But I will tell you, Meghan and Harry, they understand that a girl living in Iowa, a teenager living in Oakland, that people who are vulnerable that don’t have the platform and resources they have, could never fight off these kinds of internet attacks and cyber bullying and trolling. And I think that is what they want to put their time and efforts and support around people who get that and care about that are also working on that, too.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Wonderful. So as we wrap things up here, I want you to look ahead. I want you to tell us a little bit about what plans you have as part of working as a MacArthur Genius, and also the launch of your new nonprofit Equity Engine.\n\nSafiya Noble: I’m still pinching myself. I’m very grateful. And there are many Black women and women of color, who with just a little bit of support and scaffolding could continue to have very big impact. I mean, I look around, and I see, whether it’s Stacey Abrams, or you know, a whole host of Black women, too many to name, and women of color, who are holding up families, villages, neighborhoods, the country, democracy, and who are really under-resourced in doing that work. And so I’m really trying to use this opportunity to build Equity Engine. I’m hoping that people will just give resources and their networks and their power to women of color, because the one thing that women of color have is incredible sense of justice. And our work has been on the frontlines of expanding human and civil rights around the world. And we are also the least resourced in doing that. And so the Equity Engine is really a place for people to help us hold Black women and women of color up and build their power, in many of the ways that this MacArthur Fellowship is helping me do.\n\nNoshir Contractor: I love the term Equity Engine as well, I think it’s a very apt name for what your vision is. Thank you again so much, Safiya for speaking with us. You brought us lots of really interesting insights and awareness about some of the ways in which we need to be much more skeptical about the web in general and about the algorithms and do something about it to make a difference.\n\nSafiya Noble: Yes. Well, thank you. It’s such an honor. I have followed you and my whole career, and I just am so honored that I’ve done something right in life to get to be in conversation with you, so thank you so much for this opportunity.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Untangling the Web is a production of the Web Science Trust. This episode was edited by Susanna Kemp. I am Noshir Contractor. You can find out more about our conversation today in the show notes. Thanks for listening.\n\nEpisode 31 Transcript\n\nVint Cerf: When I joined the company, Larry and Eric and Sergey said to me, “What title do you want?” And I said, “How about Archduke?” And they said, “You know, the previous Archduke was Ferdinand, and he was assassinated in 1914 and it started World War One. Why don’t you be our Chief Internet Evangelist?” When people ask me about this, I tell them I’m Geek Orthodox, because my intent is to spread the internet religion. The idea here is that people should be able to get access to information and collaborate with each other on a global scale.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Welcome to this episode of Untangling the Web, a podcast of the Web Science Trust. I am Noshir Contractor, and I will be your host today. On this podcast we bring in thought leaders to explore how the web is shaping society, and how society in turn is shaping the web. Today my guest is Vinton Cerf, who you just heard talking about taking on a leadership role at Google, where he contributes to global policy development and the continued standardization and spread of the internet.\n\nVint is widely recognized as one of the fathers of the internet. He’s the co-designer of the TCP/IP protocols and is vice president and Chief Internet Evangelist for Google. He is a former member of the U.S. National Science Board and a past president of the Association for Computing Machinery. He is a recipient of numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the National Medal of Technology, and the ACM Turing Award. Vint, thank you so very much for joining us.\n\nVint Cerf: Well thanks so much for inviting me to join the show, Noshir. This is a topic dear to my heart, which is, you know, what’s happening to the internet and the World Wide Web and how is it affecting our society? So let’s have a look at that.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Absolutely. So let’s take us back to the early mid-70s, when you were working first as a PhD student at UCLA and then went on to be a faculty member at Stanford coming up with a design of something called the TCP/IP protocol. And you did this in collaboration with Bob Kahn. What do you think was remarkable about that moment, in coming up with a quote-unquote protocol?\n\nVint Cerf: This is sort of like the question that says, describe the universe in 25 words or less, give three examples. First of all, the work at UCLA on the ARPANET was commissioned because the Defense Department was spending money on research and artificial intelligence way back then in the mid- to late-60s for as many as a dozen universities. Everybody kept asking for new computers every year. And ARPA said, “We can’t afford that, so we’re going to build a network and you can all share your computing resources.” So we built the ARPANET first as a resource sharing system and second as a test of a theory that packet switching would be suitable for computer communication. It worked extremely well. And somewhere around 1971, one of our colleagues at Bolt Beranek and Newman, Ray Tomlinson, came up with networked electronic mail. So we were early adopters of that technology. Bob Kahn came to visit me at my lab at Stanford in the spring of 73. He had worked on and been very key to the architecture of the ARPANET project. He then went to ARPA, and began working on a problem related to command and control. And that is, how do I use computers in that application? And of course, immediately recognized that in order for this to work, the computers would have to be in mobile vehicles and ships at sea and in aircrafts, in addition to fixed installations. So Bob shows up and he says, I’ve already started working on a mobile packet radio network and the packet satellite network, and we’ve already got the ARPANET. How are we going to hook them all together to make it all look uniform so that any computer on any network can talk to any other computer on any other network? And within a period of about six months, we came up with a strategy for doing that. So by January of 1974, I was already working with a team of graduate students at Stanford to develop a detailed specification of the TCP protocol. And then by 1983, January of 83, we were able to turn the entire shebang on. So the internet begins operation on January 1 1983.\n\nNoshir Contractor: The goal of the protocols that you’re describing was to provide interconnectivity between all kinds of networks, and these networks of networks came to be called as the internet as we now know it. Arguably a second-most famous protocol, besides TCP/IP, on the web is the HTTP protocol that we use. Why do you think that some of these protocols succeed and take off the way they did while others might be technically sound, but are unable to take off as much?\n\nVint Cerf: Well, several things influence those outcomes. The first thing is that Bob and I gave away the protocols. We basically published freely. Now others were pursuing similar ideas. But those were not open source, whereas TCP/IP was fully open, which led, of course, to commercial availability of routers executing the IP and the BGP, and the other protocols that make the Internet work. So Tim, emulating this release mechanism in December of 1991, announced the World Wide Web, released the protocols freely, and encouraged people to make use of them. The early browsers including Tim’s and others, like Netscape Communications, had property that you could ask the browser to show what the HTML source code was that produced the web page that you were looking at. So that meant you could copy other people’s web pages and change them and explore and so on. This is super important from the standpoint of learning from other people. So there weren’t classes in webmasters. They were aggregations of people who were trying these things out and sharing what they knew and taking advantage of seeing what other people had done freely.\n\nNoshir Contractor: Your next foray after DARPA was at MCI Mail. One of the things that I think I heard you say, and I just want you to clarify, is that the original idea of connecting these computers was to share computing resources and that email messaging was an afterthought that came about in that network.\n\nVint Cerf: That’s correct. People were leaving messages for each other on the same machine. And so the next step is to be able to leave messages for someone on a different machine that’s part of the same network. And so that’s what led to the internet or ARPANET email. So we all made heavy use of that plus remote access to the time sharing systems, terminal access, and also file transfers to move data back and forth. I was invited to come to MCI and build an electronic mail service for them. That was late 1982. Already, there existed email services. CompuServe, for example, had one, and I think General Electric had one. So we tried very hard to put the MCI Mail email system into a place where it invited interaction with other email services and other communication services. So we introduced into MCI Mail the ability to cause the email to be printed and mailed or printed and FedExed or sent through Telex, which is of course a 19th century, you know, invention. And eventually, we got it to send faxes, as well. And so I was very proud of the fact that we were able to design a system that was that general in order to bring people into the email world even before they had that capability.\n\nNoshir Contractor: And at that time, giving access from MCI Mail to print, for example, which today might seem antiquated, must have been at least a way of getting some people into the email space.\n\nVint Cerf: That’s right. And, you know, there are situations where people want to deliver hardcopy. So MCI Mail is retired now. So I don’t have that ability anymore, now I still have to print things out and put them in envelopes and post them myself. And I’m kind of missing the capability that we invented 40 years ago.\n\nNoshir Contractor: So now we come into the 21st century. You’ve been at Google as the Chief Internet Evangelist. I’ve heard of evangelists in other areas, such as religion, but you were the first person I heard of who had taken that title at a tech company.\n\nVint Cerf: It was not a title that I asked for. When I joined the company, Larry and Eric and Sergey said to me, “What title do you want?” And I said, “How about Archduke?” You know, that sounded like a fantastic title. And they said, “You know, the previous Archduke was Ferdinand, and he was assassinated in 1914 and it started World War One. Why don’t you be our Chief Internet Evangelist?” And I said, “Okay, I can do that.” When people asked me about this, I tell them I’m Geek Orthodox because my intent is to spread the internet religion. The idea here is that people should be able to get access to information, they should be able to find it, and share it, and make use of it, and collaborate with each other on a global scale. And of course, that’s what internet and some of its applications tried to do. And one of those applications, of course, is the World Wide Web, which Tim Berners-Lee introduced in late 1991. And he did so by putting another layer of protocol, HTTP, which you referenced earlier, on top of TCP/IP. It created a capability that had not existed before, except perhaps in the form of the online system that Douglas Engelbart developed in the mid 1960s. Tim certainly augmented much of that with video and audio as well as formatted text and imagery. It was an idea ready for its time, because now we see web pages in the billions and billions of users as well.\n\nNoshir Contractor: As you worked now in this new role, one of the things that you have been at the forefront of is trying to help us get ready for the time when everything will have its own unique internet address. And a lot of that has now been referred to as the Internet of Things and the advent of the Internet Protocol version 6.\n\nVint Cerf: When Bob and I did the original design, we actually asked ourselves, you know, how much address space should we plan for? And we did a few back-of-the-envelope calculations. So we allocated eight bits of address space for networks, which would allow for up to 256 networks. Then, very quickly, as the Ethernet took off as a commercial product, and as other networks started to emerge, the consumption of address space became very rapid. So we had to redesign the interpretation of the 32-bit address space. By 1992, it became very clear that we were going to run out of that 32-bit address space no matter how we sliced it up. So the Internet Engineering Task Force, which is the primary standards body for internet standards, devoted about four years of intense debate over what new version of the Internet Protocol should be adopted. And they ended up with something we now call IP version 6. So it had 128 bits of address space. It’s 340 trillion trillion trillion addresses, and I’m hoping we won’t run out until after I’m dead. Then it’s somebody else’s problem. 1996 is when the standardization happened. And I thought everybody would instantly recognize the intelligence value of switching over quickly to the larger address space, so we wouldn’t end up with a terrible transition problem. Well, unfortunately, 1996 was exactly in the middle of the dot boom. And so everybody was too busy throwing money at anything that looked like it had something to do with internet. And nobody had run out of IPv4 address space yet. And so there was no real motivation to implement it. And so here we are today, in 2021, when only about on the average 30 percent of the possible parties have IPv6 implemented. The Internet of Things is going to consume address space like crazy. Already, we have people who have anywhere from 10 to 50 devices at home that are consuming IP address space. So we’re going to need a lot more than can be provided by IP version 4.\n\nNoshir Contractor: What would you suggest are some of the most compelling reasons why the world needs to switch over ASAP to IP 6?\n\nVint Cerf: If a device needs to communicate on the internet, it does need an IP address. I mean, that’s sort of a given. We’re starting to see a proliferation of programmable devices, including appliances, you know, things like the refrigerator and the microwave, and all these other things are increasingly driven by software. And the utility of having them online is that they can be serviced online, new programming can be provided, I mean, take a Tesla car as an example. It is, essentially, a computer on wheels. So making it do new things is a matter of downloading new software. That will be true for many, many devices. So having IP addresses is really a critical part of being able to interact, download new softwar"
