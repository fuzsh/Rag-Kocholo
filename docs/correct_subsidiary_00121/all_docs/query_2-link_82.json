Windows RegCreateKeyEx(…) returned error code 5.\n\nThe fix is to run JMeter as Administrator, it will create the registry key for you, then you can restart JMeter as a normal user and you won't have the warning anymore.\n\nYou may encounter the following error:\n\njava.security.cert.CertificateException: Certificates does not conform to algorithm constraints\n\nif you run a HTTPS request on a web site with a SSL certificate (itself or one of SSL certificates in its chain of trust) with a signature algorithm using MD2 (like md2WithRSAEncryption) or with a SSL certificate with a size lower than 1024 bits. This error is related to increased security in Java 8+.\n\nTo allow you to perform your HTTPS request, you can downgrade the security of your Java installation by editing the Java jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property. Remove the MD2 value or the constraint on size, depending on your case.\n\nThis property is in this file:\n\nJAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security\n\nSee Bug 56357 for details.\n\nUnder Mac OSX Aggregate Graph will show wrong values due to mirroring effect on numbers. This is due to a known Java bug, see Bug JDK-8065373 The fix is to use JDK8_u45 or later.\n\nView Results Tree may fail to display some HTML code under HTML renderer, see Bug 54586. This is due to a known Java bug which fails to parse \"px\" units in row/col attributes. See Bug JDK-8031109 The fix is to use JDK9 b65 or later.\n\nJTable selection with keyboard (SHIFT + up/down) is totally unusable with Java 7 on Mac OSX. This is due to a known Java bug JDK-8025126 The fix is to use JDK 8 b132 or later.\n\nSince Java 11 the JavaScript implementation Nashorn has been deprecated. Java will emit the following deprecation warnings, if you are using JavaScript based on Nashorn.\n\nWarning: Nashorn engine is planned to be removed from a future JDK release\n\nTo silence these warnings, add -Dnashorn.args=--no-deprecation-warning to your Java arguments. That can be achieved by setting the enviroment variable JVM_ARGS\n\nexport JVM_ARGS=\"-Dnashorn.args=--no-deprecation-warning\"\n\nWith Java 15 the JavaScript implementation Nashorn has been removed. To add back a JSR-223 compatible JavaScript engine you have two options:\n\nUse Mozilla Rhino\n\nCopy rhino-engine-1.7.14.jar into $JMETER_HOME/lib/ext.\n\nUse OpenJDK Nashorn\n\nThe OpenJDK Nashorn implementation comes as a module. To use it, you will have to download it and add it to the module path. A hacky way to download the version 15.0 (or later) and its dependencies and set the module path is outlined below:\n\nmkdir lib/modules pushd lib/modules wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/openjdk/nashorn/nashorn-core/15.3/nashorn-core-15.3.jar wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm/9.5/asm-9.5.jar wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-commons/9.5/asm-commons-9.5.jar wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-util/9.5/asm-util-9.5.jar wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-tree/9.5/asm-tree-9.5.jar wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-analysis/9.5/asm-analysis-9.5.jar popd export JVM_ARGS=\"--module-path $PWD/lib/modules\" ./bin/jmeter\n\nVersion 5.6.1\n\nSummary\n\nNew and Noteworthy\n\nIncompatible changes\n\nBug fixes\n\nImprovements\n\nNon-functional changes\n\nKnown problems and workarounds\n\nThanks\n\nNew and Noteworthy\n\nImprovements\n\nHTTP Samplers and Test Script Recorder\n\nPR#6010 – Use UTF-8 as a default encoding in HTTP sampler.

Java will emit the following deprecation warnings, if you are using JavaScript based on Nashorn.\n\nWarning: Nashorn engine is planned to be removed from a future JDK release\n\nTo silence these warnings, add -Dnashorn.args=--no-deprecation-warning to your Java arguments. That can be achieved by setting the enviroment variable JVM_ARGS\n\nexport JVM_ARGS=\"-Dnashorn.args=--no-deprecation-warning\"\n\nWith Java 15 the JavaScript implementation Nashorn has been removed. To add back a JSR-223 compatible JavaScript engine you have two options:\n\nUse Mozilla Rhino\n\nCopy rhino-engine-1.7.14.jar into $JMETER_HOME/lib/ext.\n\nUse OpenJDK Nashorn\n\nThe OpenJDK Nashorn implementation comes as a module. To use it, you will have to download it and add it to the module path. A hacky way to download the version 15.0 (or later) and its dependencies and set the module path is outlined below:\n\nmkdir lib/modules pushd lib/modules wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/openjdk/nashorn/nashorn-core/15.3/nashorn-core-15.3.jar wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm/9.5/asm-9.5.jar wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-commons/9.5/asm-commons-9.5.jar wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-util/9.5/asm-util-9.5.jar wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-tree/9.5/asm-tree-9.5.jar wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-analysis/9.5/asm-analysis-9.5.jar popd export JVM_ARGS=\"--module-path $PWD/lib/modules\" ./bin/jmeter\n\nVersion 5.5\n\nSummary\n\nNew and Noteworthy\n\nIncompatible changes\n\nBug fixes\n\nImprovements\n\nNon-functional changes\n\nKnown problems and workarounds\n\nThanks\n\nNew and Noteworthy\n\nJMeter now supports Java 17\n\nJMeter 5.5 ships with log4j2 2.17.2\n\nOpen Model Thread Group\n\nNew component: Open Model Thread Group allows creating load profiles with variable load.\n\nFor example, if you need to gradually increase load from 0/sec to 10/sec during minute you could previously use Thread Group + Timer combinations. However, then you need to compute the expected number of threads, ensure they are created only when needed, and so on.\n\nWith Open Model Thread Group you can configure the same load profile as rate(0/sec) random_arrivals(1 minute) rate(10/sec). The thread group would spawn threads as needed to drive the configured load. The load profile can use properties, so you can launch the same script with slightly different load levels, however, the profile can't be updated while the test is running.\n\nThe new thread group is experimental in JMeter 5.5, so please feel free to submit your feedback.\n\nPreparing the deprecation of Oro Regex usage\n\nAnother experimental feature in JMeter 5.5 is the ability to replace the Oro based Regex implementation by the built-in Java based one. To choose the Java based one, set the JMeter property jmeter.regex.engine to the value java.\n\nCore improvements\n\nKotlin language is now used in some core classes and tests (e.g. Open Model Thread Group). JMeter is compiled with apiTarget=1.5, and it ships with kotlin-stdlib 1.6.\n\nlets-plot-kotlin charting library is added, so it will be easier to refine and create new charts in UI in the future.\n\nImprovements\n\nThread Groups\n\nNew component: Open Model Thread Group\n\nHTTP Samplers and Test Script Recorder\n\nBug 65027 – Detect mime-type for files automatically when adding files to HTTP Sampler\n\nBug 65020 – HTTP Sampler/Files upload tab – add missing buttons\n\nPR#650 – HTTP Sampler timestamp fix when exception is caught.

Previous shortcut was CTRL + SHIFT + wheel, however, it conflicted with horizontal scrolling.\n\nIn-app zoom is more consistent (e.g. sometimes not all the labels or even panels were scaled). For instance: log viewer, JSR223 code editor were not previously scaled with zoom-in/out feature\n\nTree context menu is shown for the full row, not for the label only\n\nUndo and redo support for editable fields. Keystrokes are CTRL + Z / CTRL + SHIFT + Z, or CMD + Z/ CMD + SHIFT + Z depending on the operating system. Undo is implemented on a field level basis (each fields has its own history), and the history is invalidated when tree selection changes.\n\nMark the currently selected language in the options menu.\n\nMark the currently selected log level in the options menu.\n\nRework of many Test Element UI (JUnit Request, ForEach Controller, If Controller, Throughput Controller, WhileController, Counter Config, XPath2 Extractor, Function Helper Dialog, Search popup, JMS Elements)\n\nIncompatible changes\n\nDefault value of httpclient4.time_to_live has been modified from 2000 to 60000, this means HTTP connections will live longer than before.

Java will emit the following deprecation warnings, if you are using JavaScript based on Nashorn.\n\nWarning: Nashorn engine is planned to be removed from a future JDK release\n\nTo silence these warnings, add -Dnashorn.args=--no-deprecation-warning to your Java arguments. That can be achieved by setting the enviroment variable JVM_ARGS\n\nexport JVM_ARGS=\"-Dnashorn.args=--no-deprecation-warning\"\n\nVersion 5.1.1\n\nSummary\n\nNew and Noteworthy\n\nIncompatible changes\n\nBug fixes\n\nImprovements\n\nNon-functional changes\n\nKnown problems and workarounds\n\nThanks\n\nNew and Noteworthy\n\nThis release is mainly a bugfix release.
