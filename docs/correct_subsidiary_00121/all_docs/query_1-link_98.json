Brailes Home Pagebraile@purdue.edu\n\nWhats New (February 2, 2007):\n\n1.Earth science education activities are now available as MS Word downloads (click on Earth Science Education Activities at web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile).\n\n2.New write-ups are: EqLocate Tutorial (a description of the EqLocate interactive earthquake location program); AS-1 Magnitude Calculator (MagCalc); Seismic Waves and the Slinky 4-page handout; Accessing earthquake data from the Internet (eqdata); and Earthquake Shaking (Building Contest). Access by clicking on Earth Science Education Activities at web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile.MagCalc is also available through the Quick Links at: web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile.\n\n3.Updated activities: Seismic Waves and the Slinky (minor changes); Journey to the Center of the Earth. Access by clicking on Earth Science Education Activities at web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile.\n\n4.The workshops folder (access through the Quick Links at: web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile) contains documents and PowerPoint presentations referred to in recent workshops.\n\n5.PowerPoint presentation for the AGU Lecture at the NSTA Regional Convention at Indianapolis (November 5, 2004) entitled Recent advances in understanding and predicting earthquakes, and seismic hazards in the Midwest is available at: http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/nstaINDY2004Braile.ppt\n\n6.AS-1 Seismograph and AmaSeis software teaching activities and resources have recently been enhanced and updated extensively. A list and of the activities and resources (and links) is available at: http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/edumod/as1lessons/as1lessons.htm\n\n7.PowerPoint presentations from the NSTA Regional convention in Seattle, November 18-21, 2004:\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/EQWorkshop2004NSTASeattle.ppt\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/Journey2004NSTASeattle.ppt\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/SeisVolE2004NSTASeattle.ppt\n\n8.PowerPoint presentations from the Fall AGU meeting in San Francisco, December 14, 2004 (paper OS22A-02, Implementing Successful Geoscience Education and Outreach Efforts):\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/BraileOS22A.02.10.35AM.ppt\n\n9. PowerPoint presentation (most information is from USGS and NOAA websites; ~2.8MB) on the 26 December 2004 M9.0 Sumatra earthquake and tsunami and a tsunami animation (Quick Time; from NOAA, ~6MB):\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/SumatraEQandTsunami122604.ppt\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/TITOV-INDO2004[1].mov\n\n10. A new teaching module and educational resource, Seismic Wave Demonstrations and Animations is now available. The files contain seismic wave animations that illustrate wave propagation and particle motion of P, S, Rayleigh and Love waves and teaching strategies. The materials are available in html and MS Word formats. The animations can be viewed online or downloaded as html or animated gif viewable files. A PowerPoint presentation that includes the animations is also available for download. The Seismic Wave Demonstrations and Animations document can be found at:\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/edumod/waves/WaveDemo.htm.\n\n11. New (10/5/05), more extensive PowerPoint presentation (most information is from USGS and NOAA websites; ~10.8MB) on the 26 December 2004 M9.0 Sumatra earthquake and tsunami and tsunami animations (Quick Time movies; from NOAA, ~6MB; from Stephen Ward, ~7MB; to download the .mov files, right click on the file name below and select save target as  in Internet Explorer, or save Link target as  in Netscape):\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/SumatraEQandTsunami122604New.ppt\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/TITOV-INDO2004[1].mov\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/indo[1]Ward.mov\n\n12. HY4 file for importing to the Seismic/Eruption program. The file contains events from 12/1/04 to 10/5/05 within the area of -7.3 to 23.6 degrees latitude and 72.3 to 112.5 degrees longitude. The file has 4778 M4+ events including the 12/26/04 M9.0 Sumatra earthquake and aftershocks:\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/new/sumaaft.hy4\n\n13.New or Updated Earth science lessons and resources:\n\nPlate Puzzle: http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/edumod/platepuzz/platepuzz.htm\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area Earthquakes:\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/edumod/bayarea/bayareaNew.htm\n\nEvery Pebble Tells a Story:\n\nhttp://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/edumod/pebble/pebble.htm\n\nInterpreting Seismograms Tutorial:"
