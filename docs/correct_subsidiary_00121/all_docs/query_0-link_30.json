        "text": "By PETER WAYNER\n\netscape Communications Corp. is expected to release on Monday a new version of the software that is at the core of its Internet browser. The release of the free software will allow developers to build it into their own products, potentially increasing Netscape's influence over the direction of the software standards that make up the foundation of the Web.\n\nNetscape says the release also highlights the success it has achieved by embracing the idea of \"open source\" software, allowing anyone to examine and even modify the underlying code of its products.\n\nThe new software, known as Gecko, is the next generation of Netscape's layout engine, the part of the browser code that is responsible for interpreting and displaying Web documents. Netscape says it will eventually build the Gecko technology into its own browser, which also includes code responsible for other tasks like maintaining bookmarks and connecting to search engines.\n\nChris Saito, director of client software marketing at Netscape, said last week that the new engine got its name because the gecko \"is a small lizard; it's a fast lizard.\" He said the new engine would fit on a single floppy disk, small by the standards of today's software packages, which are often many times that size.\n\nThe compactness of Gecko's code is a crucial part of Netscape's strategy. In the coming months, Web browsing is expected to become more and more mobile as manufacturers of hand-held computers, cellular phones and other devices start adding Web browsing capabilities to their products. Netscape clearly hopes that these manufacturers will consider including its layout engine, which it is giving away.\n\nRelated Article\n\nSentiment Growing for Freeware\n\n(April 13, 1998)\n\nSaito said that the decision to share the layout engine's source code was not merely an act of philanthropy. \"It's a very good way for us to build high-quality software, and to be on the leading edge of what the Web standards are,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\nSharing the engine with the world gives Netscape much more political clout with the nonprofit committees responsible for developing the standards that govern the Web. The committees generally choose standards that are open and available to all computer and software manufacturers on an equal basis. Netscape's rival, Microsoft Corp., uses similar tactics when it participates on these committees. For some time now, for instance, Microsoft has freely distributed the source code to another evolving Web technology known as an XML parser.\n\nMany software developers consider participation in the standards-making process to be an important precursor to establishing market share. In this case, Netscape is able to claim that the Gecko technology \"features full support for open Internet standards,\" in part because it worked so closely with the committees designing the standards and allowed them to work with its code.\n\nWeb designers often struggle to ensure that their content will be correctly displayed by the different browsers on the market. If Gecko is used by other developers, like those putting browsers in cell phones, then the company will have a larger presence on the Web and a higher profile with Web content creators. Designers will be more likely to keep Gecko in mind when designing their sites, because they will know that their pages will be displayed the same way on many different screens and devices. Microsoft is pursuing a similar strategy by building versions of its Internet Explorer browser into the Windows CE operating system, which is designed to run on hand-held computers.\n\nNetscape also hopes that releasing the source code to Gecko will spur innovation by inspiring programmers to add to the code or improve it. Other companies and programmers have taken similar steps, sparking an \"open source movement\" that is shaking up the software industry.\n\nNetscape's first move in this direction came early this year when it announced that it would release the source code to its browser products and create a division named Mozilla to help manage the process of collaborative development. Mozilla shares a version of the Netscape source code with the world and handles the organizational chores of synchronizing the contributions of many volunteers, users and bug finders throughout the world. In return, Netscape can then create, distribute and perhaps sell branded versions of the software which take advantage of all that input.\n\nGecko itself includes contributions from people outside of Netscape. Saito said that a programmer named Jim Clark, not to be confused with the Netscape founder, created Gecko's XML parsing engine, which interprets the meaning of tags like \"<p>\" that describe the layout of a Web page. \"He did it because it's his passion,\" Saito said. \"It's a great win for us and it's a great win for the Web.\"\n\nIt is hard to quantify the amount of non-Netscape work that went into Gecko, but the open source idea clearly has its fans. David Baron, a freshman at Harvard University, said he helped to test Gecko because he wanted to help bring an end to the problem that \"every browser supports the standards in a different way. Then you have to design a different version of the site for each browser.\"\n\n\"I might as well be doing this instead of playing around and looking at Web sites all day,\" Baron said. \"A lot of people do volunteer work, but not a lot of people get to do volunteer work at this level. When you can do volunteer work that uses what you know, it's even better.\"\n\nThe Gecko release is one of the first announcements to come out of Netscape since it was acquired by America Online. The merger caused some concern that AOL might retreat from Netscape's commitment to open source. But Steve Case, chief executive officer of AOL, has said that he is supportive of Mozilla, and Saito said that AOL will be incorporating Gecko into its new online chat application.\n\nRelated Sites\n\nThese sites are not part of The New York Times on the Web, and The Times has no control over their content or availability.\n\nNetscape\n\nMozilla\n\nMicrosoft"
