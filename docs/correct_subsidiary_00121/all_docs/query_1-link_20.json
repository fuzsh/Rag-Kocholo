        "text": "The epic struggle between Netscape and Microsoft over software for the World Wide Web is a well-chronicled David versus Goliath tale. But both companies are losing business to a rival product few people have ever heard of: Apache. Among the best features of this little-known program is one that is particularly hard to resist: It is entirely free.\n\nApache, it turns out, doesn't come from a company at all. It's the loving labor of a loose confederation of programers who, working in their spare time over gin and tonics at home and collaborating on the Internet, wanted to build a better way to serve up Web pages to the millions of people who want to see them. Once they completed the server software three years ago, they triumphantly released all of the technical details on the Internet, letting any Web site use it gratis.\n\n\"Direct remuneration itself wasn't an interest,\" says Brian Behlendorf, one of the chief organizers of the Apache Project _ so named because the team started with university lab software and \"patched\" it with new features and fixes. (\"A patchy server\" _ get it?) \"We needed a better server for our own purposes, and we wanted to take our future into our own hands,\" says Behlendorf, who makes his living as chief technology officer at Web developer Organic Inc.\n\nNow Apache server software is used by an impressive range of companies and organizations to run their Web sites, including Kimberly-Clark Corp., McDonald's Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., as well as the New York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves. By some estimates, Apache is in place at close to half of the 2-million Web sites on the Internet, more than double the share held by Microsoft Corp. or Netscape Communications Corp.\n\nThat is especially galling to the two software juggernauts. \"Apache is our biggest competitor,\" Microsoft chairman Bill Gates declared at a Wall Street gathering more than a year ago.\n\nMicrosoft and Netscape have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to build a profitable Internet business. They hand out millions of free copies of their browser software to help consumers navigate the Web, hoping this will lead to increased sales of the server software they sell to corporate customers.\n\nApache's popularity is emblematic of the strange economics underpinning the entire Internet industry. Five years after the Internet began to shift from an obscure academic network to a teeming commercial enterprise, lots of free stuff still is widely available, from \"freeware\" programs to slick Web zines to news and stock quotes.\n\n\"It's the essence of the Internet,\" says Esther Dyson, founder of high-tech publisher EDventure Holdings Inc. \"There's an ethos to contribute to a work that's greater than any of us.\"\n\nRandy Terbush, one of the original Apache developers and the founder of Covalent Technologies Inc., says Apache \"is testimony to what a user-driven software project can accomplish, and why that may be a better model than commercially driven efforts.\"\n\nBut that ethos is giving Internet companies a run for their money. \"The genie's out of the bottle,\" says Eli Noam, director of Columbia University's Institute for TeleInformation. \"There are too many people who will continue to offer free software that will continue to put pressure on traditional software companies.\"\n\nThe Apache project began informally in early 1995, when a handful of Web developers were searching for robust and flexible software that could deliver Web pages to users' desktops quickly and reliably. Microsoft hadn't yet created a server program. Netscape had an early version that lacked sophisticated features the Apache contingent wanted.\n\nSo Behlendorf and a few colleagues started zapping e-mail to and fro about how to create new features and work through problems. An original circle of eight programers began working on some existing software code from a program written at a university lab, communicating via an Internet mailing list that updated everyone on each designer's progress.\n\nThe list grew to 150 people, and 200 more contributors have pitched in, many of whom have never met face to face. The first version of Apache was ready in April 1995, and by year end it had become the No. 1 Web server program.\n\nToday Apache is said to have a 47 percent share of the Internet server market, compared with 22 percent for Microsoft and about 10 percent for Netscape, according to Netcraft Ltd., a British consulting firm. Other sources reject those figures for several reasons, including that among the private internal \"intranets\" that companies install, Microsoft and particularly Netscape hold the lead. Still, even Microsoft's newly acquired subsidiaries _ Hotmail Corp. and WebTV Networks Inc. _ use Apache software on their Web sites.\n\nThe market is strategically important to both of Apache's for-profit rivals. Microsoft offers its Web server software as part of its crucial Windows NT operating system, which costs $725 or more. Netscape's Web servers start at $1,295 for 50 seats. The total Web server market generated more than $400-million in revenue in 1997, according to International Data Corp.\n\nOne reason Apache came into its own is that the source code, the basic software coding that most developers keep secret, is readily available on the Internet. That allows users to make improvements and eliminate any bugs that emerge. Proponents of such \"open\" software believe that revealing a program's inner workings entices more outside programers to devote their creative energy to building an even better version.\n\n\"If you give everyone source code, everyone becomes your engineer,\" says John Gage, chief scientist at Sun Microsystems Inc., which built its own operating system on the early Unix version developed by the Berkeley System Distribution effort.\n\nApache fans cite another advantage: Too often, software companies take too long to fix their products, while Apache patrons can do it themselves. \"It takes most vendors several weeks, sometimes months, to get fixes out. We need it within days,\" says Steve Madere, chief technology officer of Deja News Inc., a heavily trafficked Web site that uses Apache software and lets users search bulletin boards.\n\nBut many corporations balk at public-domain software. \"When I get calls in the middle of the night, I want to know I can call someone, get an answer, and go back to sleep,\" says Mark Kortekaas, director of technical operations at Sony Corp.'s Online Ventures Inc. unit in New York.\n\nBoth Microsoft and Netscape are banking on such concerns. \"Enterprise customers don't want to grow their own,\" says John Paul, senior vice president at Netscape."
