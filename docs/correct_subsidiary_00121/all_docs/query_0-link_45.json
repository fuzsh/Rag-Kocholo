        "text": "Much of Silicon Valley’s strength as an innovation center is due to its warm and welcoming community of engineers. Communal institutions and get-togethers have formed a critical part of both academic and commercial environments. The founding of Apple from the Homebrew Computer Club is one classic example, but less well known is that Pinterest was formed at Hacker Dojo.\n\nThis talk will describe the origins and evolution of Super Happy Dev House, its spread across the world (and Mexico in particular), and its evolution into Hacker Dojo. This story includes 2012’s struggles with the City of Mountain View and the institution’s ultimate move to a larger facility, its fundraising efforts, and its ongoing experiments in community management.\n\nAbout the speaker, David Weekly, Hacker Dojo\n\nDavid Weekly is is a hacker who likes people.
