        "text": "Identity theft is a serious problem on the Web these days. Just ask Netscape.\n\nNot long after America Online bought Netscape Communications Corp. in 1998, AOL began neglecting the browser at the heart of the Silicon Valley start-up. Updates arrived at an ever-slower pace, and a promised integration of the browser into the online service's software never happened. Things reached a humiliatingly low point last January, when AOL launched a cut-rate access service called Netscape that bundled Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.\n\nIf Netscape's programming code had not been released to the public under an open-source license, the browser that first popularized the Web would probably be pushing up daisies by now.\n\nFortunately, other parties (aided by a $2 million pledge from AOL) did pick up where AOL left off, turning Netscape into, first, Mozilla and then Firefox. The latter release has gone on to have the most successful start of any browser since Internet Explorer itself -- and with AOL's March 19 release of a new Netscape browser based on Firefox, things have come full circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's not a compliment. Netscape 8.0 (Win 98 SE or newer, browser.netscape.com) has more in common with 1998-vintage Netscape -- ugly, awkward and unstable -- than with the sleek, reliable Firefox. AOL's developers started with a solid foundation and added two worthwhile innovations, but the results are a mess.\n\nGET CAUGHT UP\n\nStories to keep you informed\n\nHeat pumps, EV chargers and more: U.S. unveils $4.3 billion in local climate funds\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\n‘Magical’ self-portrait was hidden for decades — until the canvas was flipped\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\nHow can I get healthier hair? Here’s what the science says.\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\nTwo dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\nAOL's biggest change to Firefox was to add the page-drawing engine of Internet Explorer. This means Netscape will properly display almost any page in existence -- from IE-only sites such as Microsoft's Windows Update to artsy blogs designed with Web standards that IE doesn't yet support. Netscape sticks to the Firefox engine, treating a page exactly the way that browser would, unless a site falls into one of two categories.\n\nIf a page belongs to a \"whitelist\" of about 150,000 sites that AOL or other firms have certified as safe -- including major news sources, search engines, stores and other name-brand destinations -- Netscape will display it in IE mode. But if the page lands on a blacklist of sites that AOL knows or suspects are dangerous, Netscape switches to a locked-down Firefox mode, with only minimal Web functions permitted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can also switch the display of a site from IE to Firefox by clicking an icon at the bottom left of Netscape's window. Select \"Display Like Internet Explorer\" when a page doesn't look right, for example, and Netscape quickly reloads and redraws the page.\n\nThis approach fails in a couple of ways. First, why even bother viewing a page in IE unless it won't function properly in Firefox? The newer browser is just that much more reliable, secure and convenient.\n\nSecond, under certain circumstances Netscape 8 displays distrusted sites in IE mode, opening the door to browser hijacking attempts. When you use a search engine that Netscape displays like Internet Explorer, the browser stays stuck in the less-secure IE mode as you click through to a page found by the search site.\n\nThe only clue that you're browsing with your shields down is a little blue \"e\" icon at the bottom-left corner -- until, of course, a hostile site tries to take over your machine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI ran searches for sites offering pirated games, knowing they would take me into a bad neighborhood, then clicked on five or so links. Only one of them was on Netscape's blacklist; the others were able to pop up a succession of pushy solicitations to run hazardous ActiveX programs. One even appeared to be on its way to loading an unknown program -- at which point I exited the browser and had the test laptop wiped clean.\n\nAOL confirmed that this behavior was a bug and said it would issue a patch for it.\n\nNetscape's other major addition to Firefox's features is a set of \"Live Content\" toolbar icons that present such snippets of Web data as weather forecasts, news headlines and stock quotes. It's the same basic idea as the Dashboard in Apple's Mac OS X, but here you don't need to switch to a separate layer of applications. On the other hand, AOL has yet to provide other developers with a way to write their own Live Content widgets, which for now limits this feature to a predictable selection of AOL's own fodder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from Live Content, Netscape mainly sets back the art of browser interface design. This thing just looks ugly, done up in a tacky green-and-orange theme (as if its developers were Miami Dolphins fans). It also works ugly, thanks to AOL's refusal to place controls where users will expect them. By placing a Web-search bar between the back, forward and reload buttons and the address bar, AOL ignores the past five years of browser development -- and by shoving the menus into the top right corner of this application's window, AOL ignores the last quarter-century of software design.\n\nLike Firefox, Netscape 8 allows for tabbed browsing, in which you can switch among multiple pages by clicking on a series of tabs within a single window. Unlike Firefox, this browser enforces a single-window mode; even if a link is set up to open in a smaller pop-up window, Netscape will display it under another open tab.\n\nNetscape provides too many options to adjust its tabbed-browsing behavior (19 instead of Firefox's five) but gets most of the default settings wrong. For example, if you open a new tab, it fills with the same page as the previous tab, instead of staying blank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cursor then fails to shift automatically to the address bar, where you could type the address of a page you do want -- unlike in every other tabbed browser I've used. Finally, Netscape clumsily widens the currently selected tab, shifting every other tab left or right and defeating your attempts to select them from memory. These little flaws conspire to waste a little bit of your time every single time you use this program, all without providing any meaningful benefit in return.\n\nElsewhere, AOL added some options to store user names, passwords and other data frequently entered at Web sites. But it also took away Firefox's valuable highlighting of properly secured sites -- a valuable help to users worried about whether they're on their bank's real site or a fake one set up as part of a \"phishing\" scam.\n\nAdd in the pushy marketing during Netscape's installation -- unless you opt out, it will have a resource-hogging Weather Channel program loading every time you start up your PC -- and this browser's habit of crashing, and it's all but unusable. Forget AOL's history of abandoning the Netscape browser (the company has yet to say if it will offer its new browser with its Netscape Internet service); this is a train wreck in its own right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's not as if installing Netscape will even permit you to de-clutter your computer by uninstalling other browsers. As long as you run Windows, you're stuck with Internet Explorer. And it's going to be easier to keep a second set of bookmarks in IE for the dwindling number of IE-only sites than to put up with this sorry successor to Netscape.\n\nLiving with technology, or trying to?
