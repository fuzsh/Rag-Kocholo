        "text": "Tim O'Reilly is leading a panel featuring: Adam Bosworth (Google), Kevin Lynch (Macromedia), John McKinley (CTO @ AOL), Halsey Minor (Grand Central Communications).\n\nAdam thinks that Web Service is not yet a platform but is close.\n\nWhat kind of clients will we use?\n\nKevin sees lots of non-browser clients: iTunes, aggregators, etc.\n\nWhat's AOL going to do to get into the 2.0 game?\n\nJohn says that AOL needs to catch the wave. They need to expose metadata.\n\nTim asks about IM.\n\nThere's an AIM SDK w/Macromedia. (News to me.)\n\nGrand Central story?\n\nWeb 2.0 is about the business use of the Internet. SLAs don't exist yet on Web services.\n\nAdam talks about the difference between things that are simple enough to work all over vs. the standards that standards bodies produce (REST vs. SOAP, RSS vs. Atom). He notes how important it is that blogs make self-publishing easy for everyone.\n\nFrom industry standards to commercial standards. What is RSS? Adam says it's not a standard and it doesn't matter.\n\nTim asks what these guys are scared of? What's missing?\n\nChaos in usability as apps migrate outside the browser. We're behind in some areas, like wireless. Adam is scared of fragmentation. How do you build an app that runs on every phone? You can't. What if we have 1,000 different apps that each only run on some devices/platforms? We don't have that with the web. We have instant updates and easy deployment on the web.\n\nTim: You afraid of Microsoft?\n\nDepends on whether Avalon and such are relevant. They might have IP issues that get in the way and slow down the rest of the world. Microsoft depends on machine upgrades. But will you really need to do that for Web apps?\n\nOpen Source?\n\nAdam: when things become commodities (open source stuff) things get better.\n\nFirfox? That's a case of open source really improving the world.\n\nAudience Questions\n\nRemember Netscape? They should they could outrun Microsoft. Open Source seems to think the same thing. What about Web Services and reliability?\n\nAdam says that cell phones are unreliable. HTTP and browsers aren't either. But it still works. When the value is there, people deal with it.\n\nDon't discount Microsoft. \"Quality is Job 3.0\"\n\nModern apps really need engineers and designers to work very closely together.\n\nAdam says that Microsoft got it right by building great developer tools.\n\nREST is good for query but not for transactions. But the big tool providers are making standards (WS-Security) that rely IP that's owned by those guys. That means the Open Source communities may be out in the cold.\n\nAdam thinks that the complexity is more important than the IP issues. Is Microsoft really going to sue a random developer for supporting WS-Security? Unlikely. The problem is that the average PHP hacker can't figure it out.\n\nWhat can PayPal do to push REST and security? Adam says just publish a spec!\n\nSee Also: My Web 2.0 post archive for coverage of all the other sessions I attended.\n\nPosted by jzawodn at October 07, 2004 03:31 PM"
