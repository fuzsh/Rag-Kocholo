We did not have time to adequately review web page development and the FTP process at out last meeting. Javier DeLeon had so much information to offer, I felt it better to let him have the time.\n\nWe will review web page development further, as well as the value of using WS_ftp for your own data management.\n\nIf we have time, we will look at creating resumes (in simulation) on the Internet.\n\nI will include a listing of the things that will be included in the final quiz. That is what I am working on now. It will be posted in a timely fashion.\n\nJuly 29, 1997\n\nWe are into Session 7. Now is a good time to work on your projects. For those of you who are developing a web page, review and practice using the editor in 3.0 Gold. If you are writing a paper, you should be gathering your supporting web information in bookmarks, or storing material in your Email account.\n\nIn addition to Javier Deleon's presentation, we will have some follow-up to web page development and FTP process.\n\nJuly 22, 1997\n\nRead: Module 6, File Transfer Protocol (ftp), pp. 91 - 99.\n\nLook over the Microsoft guide to HTML. You don't need to memorize this stuff.\n\nJuly 15, 1997\n\nPrepare for the mid-term quiz by reviewing Modules 1 thru 5 in the manual. Be familiar with the structure of a Universal Resource Locator (URL). Review EMail and Search Engines, Bookmarks, and Newsgroups.\n\nLook over the Microsoft guide to HTML. We will be looking at web page development basics for session 6, on July 22nd.\n\nJuly 8, 1997\n\nWe will have a guest speaker: Allison Elms, who will explain the vast resources available on DePaul's Libray web site.\n\nRead: Module 5, Usenet Newsgroups, pp. 80 - 89\n\nJuly 1, 1997\n\nRead: Module 3, Surfing the Internet, pp. 32 - 46, and Using Search Engines, pp 47 - 62.\n\nAlso read the handouts describing seach methods.\n\nTo reinforce your understanding of search engines, perform a simple search in AltaVista for: \"Java\" the computer program and \"Taipei\" the computer game. If you can, email me the web locations you found. These can be web addresses, or page titles.\n\nJune 24, 1997\n\nRead: The Internet Made Easy: Module 4, Netscape Electronic Mail, pp. 64 - 77.\n\nBefore our next session, locate a web site that you like. This could be a site that deals with the subject of your project, or one that is just unique and interesting to you. Using Netscape Email, send me a copy of the web site. You can send the web page information in text or as an attachment. My Email address is jbaker1@condor.depaul.edu.\n\nJune 17, 1997\n\nRead: The Internet Made Easy Manual: Module 1, Introduction, pp. 5-11, and Module 2, pp. 12-31.\n\nType http://condor.depaul.edu/~jbaker1 in location field on the Depaul Home page. Press enter. Click on the Email link, and send me a message.\n\nWeb Page Development\n\nWe will create web pages with a purpose, and we will use HTML code to create graphics and links that provide connections to database information and to locations anywhere on the world wide web.\n\nWS_FTP\n\nEven though most of your data downloading can be achieved with Search Engines, it is important to understand how to use WS_FTP.\n\nProject Papers\n\nDue: August 12, 1997\n\nPurpose: Project papers should reflect your own personal goal, one that is consistant with your competency achievement.\n\nLength: 10-15 pages (this includes your web page examples).\n\nWith regard to your written projects, the focus should be to present information that solves a problem, demonstrates a learning experience, or somehow fulfills a goal set by the student. For clarity, your paper should contain these basic parts:\n\nAn introduction: with a description of the goal you set for yourself. Show what your project was about. What computer resources did you have at your disposal (DePaul Lab, home computer, etc)? What Internet resources did you use (Newsgroups, Search Engines, Library Indicies)?\n\nListings of your Internet information: Provide lists of your web page, Newsgroup, and other information site locations. Describe the value of each type of information source. Please read Appendix 3 in the work book on citing electronic information materials. Using citation guidelines will help the reader follow the electronic path your paper leads.\n\nA Wrap-up: As a conclusion to your paper, interpret and assess what you have gathered. What does it mean to you? Did you achieve your goal? What should it mean to your audience? What broader conclusions can you make from the detailed information you have gathered? What went right? What were the difficulties you encountered in accessing information in support of your goal?\n\n. Think about how you will incorporate your competence/s into your project. This is an area we can discuss in class.\n\nCheck Out the OnLine Career Center, (OCC)\n\nThe URL for the OnLine Career Center is http://www.occ.com.\n\nIf you are interested in placing your resume on line, the Online Career Center (OCC) is the place for you. Check out the FAQ page for the most Frequently Asked Questions about this electronic career center. A good book on the subject of using the Internet to better your career is: \"Be Your Own Headhunter on Line\" by Pam Dixon and Sylvia Tiersten. This is a guide to getting the job you want using the Information Superhighway.\n\nOnline Resumes\n\nFollow the new process listed below. When you have completed writing your resume, and you are satisfied with the way it flows, you are ready to prepare it for electronic transfer. It is best to start with a word processing program like MS Word, or WordPerfect. A word processing application provides you with the benefits of spell check and other editing tools. All word processing programs can cause conversion problems when you attempt exporting your document to the Internet platform. When you create your resume in the word processing program of your choice, avoid using boldface, italics, and fancy fonts. Keep your headings, bullits, etc. at the left margin.\n\nFollow these steps to create your resume:\n\nOpen a new document in your word processing program.\n\nInput your resume using a standard type font like Times or Helvetica.\n\nKeep your headings and bullits at the far left margin.\n\nAfter you have spell checked, formatted and saved your resume, you're ready to move your word processing document to the Internet.\n\nTake your cursor and highlight the entire document.\n\nClick on \"EDIT\" and \"COPY\"\n\nOpen Netscape and GoTo the Online Career Center Web Page, http://www.occ.com.\n\nSelect\"Post Resume\" which is located just below the \"Quick Search\" Keyword field.\n\nSelect the second choice, \"entering your resume without creating a personal account\".\n\nComplete the questionnaire and \"PASTE\" your resume into the text box provided. When you are satisfied with the look of your resume, Click \"Submit\". Your resume is on its way to the Online Career Center. In a short period of time, you will receive an Email from OCC responding to your resume upload. Check in about 24 hours. Your resume should be online.\n\nPeriodicals on the Web\n\nPC Computing\n\nPC Magazine\n\nPC World\n\nWindows Internet Magazine\n\nByte Magazine\n\nReturn Home"
