The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Orrin G. Hatch (chairman of the committee) presiding. Also present: Senators Thurmond, Leahy, Kohl, Feinstein, and Schumer. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH The Chairman. Good morning, and welcome to today's hearing addressing the important and increasingly complicated issue of privacy on the Internet. It has been no secret that throughout my career in the U.S. Senate, I have advocated and sought policies that encourage and foster the development of new and better technologies. Included among them are medical technologies that help to improve the health of Americans and information technologies that bring distance learning to many who live in rural areas in Utah and across the Nation. The Internet's explosive growth promises to impact every aspect of our daily life, as it provides the public with useful and often vital information and literary content immediately at the mere click of a mouse. Internet technology will play an important role in educating the population through distance learning and through the general delivery of information. The Internet will also continue to play an increasingly larger role in our daily entertainment, whether it is through the delivery of movies and music over the Internet or through the ability to play video games with a network of literally millions of players across the globe. During the last session of Congress, I worked with my colleagues on this committee in a bipartisan manner to act on a number of matters aimed at fostering the growth of the Internet and promoting a competitive environment in this new digital environment. First, this committee won passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which put in place the most significant revisions to the U.S. copyright law since the enactment of the 1976 Copyright Act. I consider that one of the most important bills of the whole last session. Second, the Judiciary Committee initiated the still ongoing, thorough public examination of important issues affecting competition and innovation in the digital marketplace. In addition, the committee also provided legislative assistance to industry in our national effort to prepare for the Y2K problem by crafting and passing legislation to allow businesses and local governments to share Y2K remediation information with limited fear of liability. During this session of Congress, I intend to continue working on legislative and oversight efforts that address new policy changes of the Internet and the new digital revolution. Today's hearing is the first this committee has held on the issue of consumer privacy on the Internet. Given the complex nature of this issue and all of the various policy considerations involved, I do not expect this to be our last hearing on this issue. Any revolutionary, paradigm-shifting technology presents government with new and significant policy changes and challenges. The Internet is no exception. I recently read that earlier in this century there were concerns about the sale of automobiles to the public as it provided crooks with a tool to escape the police. Luckily, we found a way to address this automobile, ``concern.'' It is my hope that we can do the same for any concerns that surround the Internet. As Americans spend more of their lives on the Internet, they are more concerned about the ability of Web sites, both government and commercial, to track their, ``digital steps.'' There is no question that in order for the Internet to reach its maximum potential as a viable avenue for transacting commerce, consumers must be assured that personally identifiable information that is collected online is afforded adequate levels of protection. But the question remains how do we best do that. How do we do it without chilling the development of new technologies or the expansion of the marketplace? There have already been over 50 legislative proposals offered this session addressing privacy. I have been skeptical of most proposals to date, as they require increased regulation of the Internet by government. As I have expressed in the past, we must be careful not to stymie the growth of new technologies with broad government regulations. The purpose of today's hearing is two-fold. First, it is intended to educate the public and the members of this committee about what the privacy issues are that surround consumer use of the Internet and what industry is doing to correct these problems. Second, it will allow us to begin a dialogue with those with an interest in the privacy issue in order to develop a meaningful and balanced policy that takes into consideration the needs of consumers, law enforcement and industry, one that would ensure continued technology development in this important area and that ensures electronic commerce is able to reach its full potential. Now, I believe that it is in the best interests of the industry to develop meaningful privacy policies and to provide adequate protections for consumer privacy. After all, individual consumers will demand that the electronic marketplace provide adequate and effective privacy protections. Indeed, I have been very encouraged to see, in over the past 6 months, the development of a productive and meaningful effort by industry to ensure such privacy protection. We will hear testimony from some of those involved in that effort today. However, I am still concerned about reports that there might still remain certain fringe operators of Web sites who might not abide by the standards that the industry has set for itself. Any successful self-regulatory model needs to have adequate resources to enforce the rules that it sets for itself. To date, the discussions surrounding Internet privacy have revolved around two mutually exclusive models as possible solutions to this issue. The first, advocated by certain consumer rights groups, would give government regulatory bodies the authority to regulate conduct on the Internet. And the second, advocated by most members of the industry, would entrust the industry to regulate itself without any role for the government. For the past several months, I have been examining different self-enforcement systems that have proven successful in other industries and that might serve as a useful model for the protection of privacy on the Internet. I believe we should explore whether another solution exists, one that aims to respect both the need to foster continued growth of the electronic marketplace and the need to enforce any rules for the protection of consumer privacy. I hope we could develop a solution that respects this dynamic and diverse Internet industry, a solution that would give the industry appropriate power to establish a code of conduct for its online presence, while providing for a limited and proper government oversight role, which, frankly, given the interest received to date in Congress, appears inevitable. This solution possibly could be based on the self-regulatory, quasi- governmental model successfully employed in the securities industry. Now, I know that can bring a chill over anybody's body in just a few seconds, when you look at how bureaucratically over- regulated in some respects the securities industry is. Yet, still, we have probably the most effective securities industry regulations of any nation and of history itself. As we continue to examine this issue, I invite any interested person or persons to work with me and other members of this committee to develop a reasonable policy for Internet privacy, one that provides adequate privacy protections for consumers, and at the same time allows the industry to regulate itself in a manner that would allow them to bring new innovations to the marketplace. So I am hopeful that we can do that. Herb, shall we turn to you at this time to represent the minority? STATEMENT OF HON. HERBERT KOHL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN Senator Kohl. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to commend you for holding this hearing today on the very critical issue of privacy, which is enormously important in the information age that we live in. Public worry over privacy is real. A recent survey found that 92 percent of consumers are, ``concerned'' about threats to their personal privacy, and that is a startling figure. Today, new technologies, including the Internet, facilitate the free flow of vast quantities of information around the world. The benefit of this technology is both real and tangible. But as with many other things, there is a downside, especially when this technology allows sensitive personal information, such as medical and credit histories, to be collected and often used by third parties. Not even the local supermarket is insulated from the information age. Nowadays, stores issue cards that can track information regarding customer purchases right at the check-out counter. Granted, these cards are helpful to consumers who want discounts, but they are not so convenient when the cashier notifies folks in the check-out line that you need to refill your prescription of Prozac. In much the same way, the Internet can track and store personal data and preferences, oftentimes without the consumer even knowing it. When this information is then shopped around for a profit, privacy is lost and the problems begin. Certainly, self-regulation is preferable to government regulation, and many in the computer industry have made important strides in this direction. However, striking the right balance between access to information and protection of personal privacy is a complicated matter. While these hearings will help, it is not clear that Congress is equipped to look at this issue with the sort of altitude or distance necessary to resolve these issues. Nor is it clear that the best actors in the private sector will set the standards for the worst. So, Mr. Chairman, to my mind the time has come to step back and assess privacy concerns from a broader perspective. With Senator DeWine, I am considering legislation to create a privacy study commission which would provide us with a comprehensive overview of the privacy issues we need to focus on today and suggestions of how to ensure privacy tomorrow. This is not a new idea. In fact, 25 years ago a Privacy Study Commission was established by the Privacy Act of 1974. The work of that commission is legendary. It led to laws protecting financial privacy and credit reporting. But times and technology have changed. In light of the new privacy challenges facing us today and into the next century, which are of a vastly greater magnitude, we need to once again consider a commission approach. That said, Mr. Chairman, I applaud you and Senator Leahy for holding this important hearing, and I look forward to working with you in the future to address the real privacy concerns of all Americans. Thank you. The Chairman. Well, thank you, Senator Kohl. We appreciate it. [The prepared statement of Senator Kohl follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Herbert Kohl Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would like to commend you for holding this hearing today on the very critical issue of privacy--which is enormously important in the ``information age'' of today. Public worry over privacy is real. A recent survey found that 92 percent of consumers are ``concerned'' about threats to their personal privacy-- that's a startling figure. Another poll reported that 83 percent believe they no longer have control over how companies collect and use their personal information. No wonder that privacy has caught our attention. Today, new technologies, including the Internet, facilitate the free flow of vast quantities of information around the world. We've heard time and time again about the benefits of this ``Internet Revolution,'' and these benefits are both real and tangible. But, as with many things, there is a downside. For example, newer and faster computers make it easier than ever to retrieve medical information in an emergency; but, this technology also allows potentially sensitive personal information, such as medical and credit histories, to be collected and often used by third parties. Not even the local supermarket is insulated from the information age. Nowadays, stores issue cards that can track information regarding customer purchases right at the checkout counter. Granted, these cards are helpful to consumers who want discounts. But they are not so convenient when the cashier notifies folks in the checkout line that you need to refill your prescription for Prozac. [LAUGHTER] In much the same way, the Internet can track and store personal data and preferences, oftentimes without the consumer even knowing it. When this information is then shopped around for a profit, privacy is lost and the problems begin. These are just some of the privacy concerns of Americans, and they are not without consequence. Suspicions regarding Internet privacy, or the lack thereof, have limited the growth of electronic commerce. Many consumers hesitate to participate in on-line activities for fear of having their personal data tracked and stored by unknown parties. There is also the very real problem of harmonizing our privacy laws with the generally stricter--and often less thoughtful--privacy laws of other nations, most notably, the European Union. Certainly, self-regulation is preferable to government regulation, and many in the computer industry have made important strides in this direction. However, striking the right balance between access to information and protection of personal privacy is a complicated matter. While these hearings will help, it is not clear that Congress is equipped to look at this issue with a sort of ``altitude'' or ``distance'' necessary to resolve these issues. Nor is it clear to me that the best actors in the private sector will set the standards for the worst.

That said Mr. Chairman, I applaud you and Senator Leahy for holding this important hearing, and I look forward to working with all of you in the future to address the very real privacy concerns of all Americans. Thank you. The Chairman. Senator Leahy is going to be here. So when he arrives, I will probably interrupt to permit him to make whatever statement he desires. In order to achieve today's dual goal of educating the public and the members of this committee on Internet privacy issues, we are fortunate to have with us six experts in the field of Internet privacy and technology who will testify today. We will first hear from Ms. Katherine Borsecnik, Senior Vice President of Strategic Businesses at America Online. Ms. Borsecnik has been with AOL for more than 7 years and has played an integral role in developing and implementing AOL's online privacy and safety policies. We are delighted to have you here. Then we will hear from Mr. Michael Sheridan, Vice President for Strategic Businesses at Novell, headquartered in my home State of Utah. Prior to joining Novell, Mr. Sheridan previously worked at Sun Microsystems, where he was co-creator of the computer programming language Java. Mr. Sheridan is one of the developers of Novell's recently announced digitalme technology. Are you living in Utah, Michael, or are you down in California? Mr. Sheridan. I am actually out here. The Chairman. You are out here? Mr. Sheridan. Yes. The Chairman. Also testifying today will be Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, General Manager of IBM's Internet Division. Dr. Wladawsky-Berger has been affiliated with IBM since 1970 and is currently in charge of IBM's Internet and network computing strategy, and is referred to at IBM as ``Dr. Internet.'' I am not sure that that is good. Mr. Wladawsky-Berger. I am not sure either. [Laughter.] The Chairman. I would also like to note that Dr. Wladawsky- Berger is a member of the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee, or PITAC. Then we will hear from Mr. Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology. As its mission states, CDT works to promote democratic values and constitutional liberties in the digital age. Mr. Berman has worked tirelessly with free speech and privacy policy working groups focusing on Internet policy issues. We are certainly glad to have all of you here. Next, we will hear testimony from Mr. Russell Bodoff, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of BBBOnLine, an independent subsidiary of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Mr. Bodoff is in charge of directing and supervising the creation of BBBOnLine's new Privacy Seal Program, which we are very interested to hear more about today. Our final witness will be Mr. Greg Fischbach, Chairman and CEO of Acclaim Entertainment, which develops and distributes interactive entertainment software for the Internet and home entertainment systems. Mr. Fischbach is also the Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of the Interactive Digital Software Association. So we are really happy to have you here, Greg, Mr. Bodoff, Mr. Berman, Mr. Wladawsky-Berger, Mr. Sheridan and Ms. Borsecnik. We think this is a terrific panel and I am looking forward to hearing what you have to say. I would like to thank each of you for taking time out of your busy schedules and appearing before the committee. We expect you, as experts, to shed light on the issues inherent in the protection of privacy on the Internet. I feel confident that you share my view that Internet privacy issues are too important not to be addressed, and that growth of this new medium and its problems must be addressed carefully. So I have looked forward to today's hearing as a careful and considered first step toward opening a meaningful dialogue between Congress and the interested public on the issue of Internet privacy. So with that, we will begin with you, Ms. Borsecnik, and we will look forward to hearing what you have to say. I would like you to limit your remarks to five minutes, if you can. I am not going to be a stickler on that, but I would appreciate it if you can because we do have some questions. PANEL CONSISTING OF KATHERINE BORSECNIK, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, STRATEGIC BUSINESSES, AMERICA ONLINE, INC., DULLES, VA; MICHAEL SHERIDAN, VICE PRESIDENT, STRATEGIC BUSINESSES, NOVELL, INC., OREM, UT; IRVING WLADAWSKY-BERGER, GENERAL MANAGER, INTERNET DIVISION, IBM CORP., WASHINGTON, DC; JERRY BERMAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND TECHNOLOGY, WASHINGTON, DC; RUSSELL T. BODOFF, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, BBBONLINE, INC., ARLINGTON, VA; AND GREGORY FISCHBACH, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ACCLAIM ENTERTAINMENT, GLEN COVE, NY STATEMENT OF KATHERINE BORSECNIK Ms. Borsecnik. Thank you. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss online privacy with you here today. My name is Katherine Borsecnik. I am Senior Vice President of Strategic Businesses for America Online. The online medium is quickly revolutionizing the way we learn, communicate and do business. It impacts industries fundamentally as diverse as booksellers to brokerage, and offers consumers unprecedented convenience. Our customers can sign onto AOL and instantaneously do research, send a letter, find the best price on an airline ticket--tasks that just a few short years ago would have taken them far more time. But the technology of the Internet offers users even something more unique--the ability to customize or personalize their online experience. Consumers can communicate specific preferences online that will allow them to receive services or information that is targeted to their needs. For example, an AOL member can set her online preferences to get the weather forecast in her local area, to read news stories about her professional interests, or to get a notice about the availability of a new CD from her favorite musician. But the power of the Internet can only be fully realized if consumers feel very confident that their online privacy is protected. For me, protecting my customers' privacy is essential to earning their trust, without which I cannot sustain a business. AOL learned this important lesson through our own mistakes not too long ago when an AOL employee wrongfully disclosed information to the government about a member's screen name. AOL has recognized that consumer trust is essential to building our business and building the online medium, and we have taken a number of important steps to create a privacy- friendly environment for our customers. Building on the online lessons we have learned, and from the information and opinions we receive from our members on a daily basis, we have adopted privacy policies that clearly explain to our users what information we collect, why we collect it, and how they can exercise choice about how that information is used. We have based our policies on core principles that reflect consumer needs and expectations. For example, we never read members' private e-mail. We will not disclose to anyone any information about where a member goes online, and we will not give out a member's phone number, screen name, or credit card information unless he expressly agrees. We give consumers clear choices about how their personal information is used, and we make sure that our members are well-informed about what those choices are. For example, if a customer decides that he does not want to receive targeted marketing materials from us, all he needs to do is check a box online that tells us not to send him such information. We also make sure that our policies are well-understood and implemented by our employees. We provide training about our privacy policies and we require all employees to agree to abide by our privacy policies as a condition of their employment at America Online. We continually review state-of-the-art technology to ensure that we use the most advanced technologies to defend our customers' data security. AOL takes extra steps to protect the safety and privacy of children online. We do not collect personal information from children without their parents' knowledge or consent. We have created a secure environment for children, our Kids Only area, and we carefully monitor all the activity in that area, including chat rooms and message board posts, to ensure the safest possible environment for children, and to ensure that a child does not post personal information online that could allow them to be identified or contacted offline. Furthermore, America Online's parental controls technology enables parents to safeguard their children online by allowing them to set preferences and limits on who their children may talk to online and where they may go and what they may see. In addition to adopting and implementing our own policies, AOL is committed to fostering best practices among our business partners and industry colleagues. One of the strongest examples of this effort is our Certified Merchant program, which guarantees that our members will be protected and satisfied when they are within the AOL environment. Through this program, which currently includes over 150 of our merchant partners, we offer a money-back guarantee to dispel consumer concerns about shopping security and increased consumer trust in this powerful new medium. We believe that the more we are able to work with our business partners and require high standards of them, the more likely it is that these standards will become the marketplace norm. In fact, we believe that the online industry as a whole is taking positive steps toward protecting online privacy. To strengthen industry's commitments to online privacy, AOL joined with other companies and associations last year to form the Online Privacy Alliance, which has grown to include more than 85 recognized industry leaders. AOL believes that companies are responding to the increasing marketplace demand for online privacy, and that the tremendous growth of e-commerce reflects positive trends on a variety of consumer issues, including privacy. In part, we think that technology holds the key to ensuring a safe and secure online environment. We believe it is critical for us to provide the most sophisticated security technologies to our customers so they can take steps to secure their own privacy. That is why we continue to advocate the widespread availability and use of strong encryption, both in this country and abroad. Challenges that lie ahead will give us the opportunity to prove that the industry and government can work together to promote effective online privacy. But ultimately for me at the end of the day, it is the consumer who will be the judge of our efforts in these areas and whether they are adequate because no matter how extraordinary the opportunities for electronic commerce are, we know our business will fail if we cannot earn the trust of our customers and meet the consumer demands for privacy protection. We at AOL are committed to doing our part in this effort. Our consumers demand it, our business demands it, and we appreciate the opportunity to discuss these important issues with you and to work with you further on the issues of Internet electronic commerce and privacy. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Borsecnik. That was great. [The prepared statement of Ms. Borsecnik follows:] Prepared Statement of Katherine Borsecnik Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy, and Members of the Committee, I would like to thank you, on behalf of America Online, for the opportunity to discuss online privacy with you today. I am the Senior Vice President for Strategic Businesses at AOL, and in that capacity a significant amount of my work for the company is devoted to addressing issues of online privacy, security, and data protection. The online medium is quickly revolutionizing the way we learn, communicate, and do business. People are migrating to the Internet to meet their commerce and communications needs at an extraordinary rate because it is convenient and fast, and offers an ever-growing selection of information, goods and services. AOL subscribers can sign on to our service and do research, shop for clothes, and buy airline tickets all in a matter of minutes. In addition, the online environment offers users unique benefits of customization and personalization. Consumers can communicate specific preferences online that will allow them to receive information targeted to their own interests. For instance, AOL members can set their online preferences to get the weather forecast for their own zip code, read news stories about their own hometown, or receive notices about special discounts on their favorite CDs. No other commercial or educational medium has ever afforded such tremendous potential for personalization. But the power of the Internet can only be fully realized if consumers feel confident that their privacy is properly protected when they take advantage of these benefits. We know very well that if consumers do not feel secure online, they will not engage in online commerce or communication--and without this confidence, our business cannot grow. For AOL, therefore, protecting our members' privacy is essential to earning their trust, and this trust is in turn essential to building the online medium. We learned this important lesson through our own mistakes not too long ago, when an AOL employee wrongly revealed the screen name of one of our members to the government. Recognizing the importance of this issue, AOL has taken a number of steps to create an environment where our members can be certain that their personal information and their choices regarding the use of that information are being respected: from creating and implementing our own privacy policies and educating our members about them, to promoting best practices among our business partners, to engaging in self- regulatory initiatives and enforcement mechanisms that will raise the bar for all companies who do business online. setting an example Building on the lessons we have learned and the input we have received from our members, we have created privacy policies that clearly explain to our users what information we collect, why we collect it, and how they can exercise choice about the use and disclosure of that information. To that end, the AOL privacy policy is organized around 8 core principles: (1) We do not read your private online communications. (2) We do not use any information about where you personally go on AOL or the Web, and we do not give it out to others. (3) We do not give out your telephone number, credit card information or screen names, unless you authorize us to do so. And we give you the opportunity to correct your personal contact and billing information at any time. (4) We may use information about the kinds of products you buy from AOL to make other marketing offers to you, unless you tell us not to. We do not give out this purchase data to others. (5) We give you choices about how AOL uses your personal information. (6) We take extra steps to protect the safety and privacy of children. (7) We use secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personal information. (8) We will keep you informed, clearly and prominently, about what we do with your personal information, and we will advise you if we change our policy. We give consumers clear choices about how their personal information is used, and we make sure that our users are well informed about what those choices are. For instance, if an AOL subscriber decides that he does not want to receive any targeted marketing notices from us based on his personal information or preferences, he can simply check a box on our service that will let us know not to use his data for this purpose. Because we know this issue is so critically important to our members and users, we make every effort to ensure that our privacy policies are clearly communicated to our customers from the start of their online experience. We also make sure that our policies are well understood and properly implemented by our employees. We require all employees to sign and agree to abide by our privacy policy, and we provide our managers with training in how to ensure privacy compliance. We are committed to using state-of-the-art technology to ensure that the choices individuals make about their data online are honored. Finally, we try to keep users informed about the steps they can take to protect their own privacy online. For instance, we emphasize to our members that they must be careful not to give out their personal information unless they specifically know the entity or person with whom they are dealing, and we encourage them to check to see whether the sites they visit on the Web have posted privacy policies. protecting children online AOL takes extra steps to protect the safety and privacy of children online. One of our highest priorities has always been to ensure that the children who use our service can enjoy a safe and rewarding online experience, and we believe that privacy is a critical element of children's online safety. We have created a secure environment just for children--our ``Kids Only'' area--where extra protections are in place to ensure that our children are in the safest possible environment. In order to safeguard kids' privacy, AOL does not collect personal information from children without their parents' knowledge and consent, and we carefully monitor all of the Kids Only chat rooms and message boards to make sure that a child does not post personal information that could allow a stranger to contact the child offline. Furthermore, through AOL's ``parental controls,'' our members are able to protect their children's privacy by setting strict limits on whom their children may interact with online. Because of the unique concerns relating to child safety in the online environment, AOL supported legislation in the 105th Congress to set baseline standards for protecting kids' privacy online. We worked with Senator Bryan, the FTC, and key industry and public interest groups to help bring the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) to fruition last year. We believe the enactment of this bill was a major step in the ongoing effort to make the Internet safe for children. fostering best practices In addition to adopting and implementing our own policies, AOL is committed to fostering best practices among our business partners and industry colleagues. One of the strongest examples of this effort is our ``Certified Merchant'' program, through which we work with our business partners to guarantee our members the highest standards of privacy and customer satisfaction when they are within the AOL environment. AOL carefully selects the merchants we allow in the program (currently there are 152 participants), and requires all participants to adhere to strict consumer protection standards and privacy policies. The Certified Merchant principles are posted clearly in all of our online shopping areas, thereby ensuring that both consumers and merchants have notice of the rules involved and the details of the enforcement mechanisms, which help to foster consumer trust and merchant responsiveness. Here are the criteria that our merchants have to meet in order to become certified and to display the America Online Seal of Approval (some screen shots that show how these criteria appear to subscribers on our service are attached to this testimony): 1. Post complete details of their Customer Service policies, including: Contact Information, Shipping Information, Returns Policies, and Money-Back Satisfaction Guarantee Information. 2. Receive and respond to e-mails within one business day of receipt. 3. Monitor online store to minimize/eliminate out-of-stock merchandise available. 4. Receive orders electronically to process orders within one business day of receipt. 5. Provide the customer with an order confirmation within one business day of receipt. 6. Deliver all merchandise in professional packaging. All packages should arrive undamaged, well packed, and neat, barring any shipping disasters. 7. Ship the displayed product at the price displayed without substituting. 8. Agree to abide by AOL's privacy policy. Through our Certified Merchant program, we commit to our members that they will be satisfied with their online experience, and we have developed a money-back guarantee program to dispel consumer concerns about shopping online and increase consumer trust in this powerful new medium. We believe that these high standards for consumer protection and fair information practices will help bolster consumer confidence and encourage our members to engage in electronic commerce. helping to promote industry efforts The online industry as a whole is taking positive steps toward protecting consumer privacy. In fact, to improve industry's commitment to online privacy, AOL joined with other companies and associations last year to form the Online Privacy Alliance (OPA), a group dedicated to promoting privacy online. Since we began our efforts just a few months ago, the OPA has grown to include more than 85 recognized industry leaders, and industry efforts to protect consumer privacy online have blossomed. The OPA has worked hard to develop a set of core privacy principles--centered around the key concepts of notice, choice, data security, and access-- and its members are committed to posting and implementing privacy policies that embody these principles. Furthermore, the OPA is continuing to reach out to businesses nationwide to explain the importance of protecting online privacy and posting meaningful privacy policies. We believe that the OPA member companies are setting a new standard for online privacy, and that as consumers become more aware of the choices available to them, the marketplace will begin to demand robust privacy polices of all companies that do business online. But we also understand the need for meaningful enforcement of self-regulation. That's why we abide by the OPA requirement to participate in robust enforcement mechanisms through our involvement in the TrustE and BBBOnline privacy seal programs. We are key sponsors of both the TrustE and BBBOnline privacy seal programs, and have worked closely with industry representatives and members of the academic community to help formulate strict standards for seal eligibility. the challenges ahead We believe that companies are responding to the increasing marketplace demand for online privacy, and that the tremendous growth of e-commerce reflects positive trends on a variety of consumer protection issues, including privacy. But our work has only just begun. As technology makes it easier for companies to collect and use personal information, the adoption and implementation of robust privacy policies will become even more important. In part, we believe that technology holds the key to ensuring a safe and secure online environment. As an online service provider, we believe it is critical for us to be able to provide the most sophisticated security technologies to our members so that they can take steps to protect their own privacy online. That's why we will continue to advocate the widespread availability and use of strong encryption, both in this country and abroad. The challenges that lie ahead will give us the chance to prove that industry and government can work together to promote meaningful self- regulation of online privacy. But ultimately, it is the consumer who will be the judge of whether these efforts are adequate. Because no matter how extraordinary the opportunities for electronic commerce may be, the marketplace will fail if we cannot meet consumers' demands for privacy protection and gain their trust. We at AOL are committed to doing our part to protecting personal privacy online. Our customers demand it, and our business requires it-- but most importantly, the growth and success of the online medium depend on it. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss these important issues before the Committee, and look forward to continuing to work with you on other matters relating to the Internet and electronic commerce. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8199.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8199.002 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8199.003 The Chairman. Mr. Sheridan, before we turn to you, let me turn to our Democrat leader on the committee for his statement. Senator Leahy. STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Senator Leahy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As it often happens, I am running between two different committees, and I apologize for going back and forth because this is an area of great interest to me. I have told this story before. Since I have been in public office, I have clipped and saved and actually framed only about two news items about myself, and I will tell you about one of the two just to give you an idea of why I think this issue is so important. I live on a dirt road in Vermont. Our nearest neighbors are a mile or so in either direction. One of the neighbors, a farmer, who has known me since I was a teenager, prompted a whole article in the New York Times. An out-of-State car with New York plates pulls up to the farmer. The reporter says, does Senator Leahy live up this road? The farmer says, are you a relative of his? The man says no. The farmer says, are you a friend of his? The reporter says, well, not really. He says, is he expecting you? The reporter says no. The farmer looks him right in the eye and says, never heard of him. [Laughter.] And I have often thought that probably reflects as much as anything the sense of privacy we have in Vermont, and so I come to this naturally. The concern over privacy is reaching an all-time high. In 1978, 64 percent of Americans reported they were very concerned or somewhat concerned about threats to their privacy. As Mr. Berman knows, by 1998 this number had skyrocketed. According to the Center for Social and Legal Research, 88 percent of Americans reported being very or somewhat concerned about threats to their personal privacy. So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you and Senator Kohl and others for having this hearing. Good privacy policies make good business policies. If you have new technologies--and those on the panel know the new technologies as well as anybody in this country--you know that it brings new opportunities for business and consumers. But it doesn't do any good if consumers hesitate to use a particular technology because they are concerned about what it might do to their privacy. That is why privacy policy is good business policy. Ensuring that we have adequate privacy laws has a more significant and important role in our democracy than just fostering high-tech businesses. We have to defend online freedom from heavy-handed content regulation. The Communications Decency Act in 1996 which was found unconstitutional--I voted against that because of that. Stopping efforts to create government censors is critical to allow our First Amendment rights to flourish, but it is not enough. For people to feel comfortable in exercising their First Amendment rights, they have to be able to keep their activities confidential and private. If Big Brother is watching, then First Amendment rights are chilled as if government is censoring it. We have a long tradition of keeping our identities private. The Federalist Papers, for example, the most important political document written about our Constitution, was authored anonymously initially by James Madison, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton, and published under a pseudonym. The Supreme Court, I believe, said ``anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.'' The report that I released last month on Vermont Internet commerce is telling on this point. The strongest obstacle among consumers from shopping and doing business online was their fear of the online security risk. This is important because in my State, a rural State like mine, the commercial potential of the Internet is enormous. We have seen businesses that are using it--we have seen their businesses skyrocket, but it is still held back by people who fear the security risks, right or wrong. That is why promoting the use of encryption is so important, so that businesses and consumers can use this technology to provide the privacy and security they need. I am going to introduce privacy legislation to ensure that Americans' Fourth Amendment rights to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable government searches and seizures are given ample protection in a networked computer environment. In addition, several provisions of the bill will address the concern Americans have about the use of their personally identifiable records and information by businesses, satellite carriers, libraries and book sellers. Online businesses are engaging in serious efforts to make available to consumers information on privacy policies, and I commend and applaud those efforts. But in our current laws, we don't apply privacy principles in an even-handed manner. Video rental stores and cable operators are subject to privacy laws to protect our rights to keep our viewing habits private, but no protections exist for the books we borrow from the library or buy from a bookstore, or the shows we watch via satellite. We should have more privacy for that. For that matter, we should have more privacy on our medical records, which can be moved all over the country without any restrictions. Telephone companies and cable operators are subject to legal restrictions on how they may use personally identifiable information about their Internet subscribers, but other Internet and online service providers are not. The E-RIGHTS bill I am introducing would promote a more level playing field in terms of the privacy protections available to Internet users, no matter whether they obtain their Internet access from AOL, their cable company, or their local phone company. So we have to look at a number of things. When should the FBI be allowed to use cell phones to track a user's movements? Should a Kosovo human rights organization that uses a Web site to correct government misinformation be able to get a domain name without having their names publicly available on a database? Should we allow Federal prosecutors to act like Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr did and go on fishing expeditions with subpoenas issued to bookstores to find out what we are reading? That was one of the most chilling things I ever saw, a prosecutor going to a bookstore to find out what I was reading. And this is not George Orwell; this is the United States of America. I mean, of all of Mr. Starr's excesses, this was as bad a one as any I saw. Should we protect our choices of reading and viewing materials the same way we protect our choice of videotapes that we rent from our local Blockbuster? You may recall that when a Supreme Court nominee was before this committee, somebody had found out what videos he was renting. And Senator Alan Simpson and I were so outraged by that, we introduced legislation saying you can't go into the video stores to find out what they are renting. That was probably the only thing that stopped Mr. Starr on that. If you maintain your calendar on Yahoo, shouldn't you get the same privacy protections as those who keep their calendars on their desks or in their PCs' hard drive? So these are some of the questions. Mr. Chairman, I know we have witnesses here, and you have been more than gracious with the time. I will put the whole statement in the record, but these are significant privacy issues--and I suspect that you get people in Utah who are very concerned about their privacy, and every State that is represented here. In the electronic world, we have to be more concerned. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. [The prepared statement of Senator Leahy follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy Concern over privacy is reaching an all time high. In 1978, 64 percent of Americans reported that they were ``very concerned'' or ``somewhat concerned'' about threats to their personal privacy. By 1998, this number had skyrocketed. According to the Center for Social and Legal Research, 88 percent of Americans reported being ``very'' or ``somewhat concerned'' about threats to their personal privacy. I am pleased the Senate Judiciary Committee is taking this concern seriously and beginning an examination of new Internet-related privacy issues. good privacy policies make good business policies New technologies bring with them new opportunities, both for the businesses that develop and market them, and for consumers. It does not do anyone any good for consumers to hesitate to use any particular technology because they have concerns over privacy. That is why I believe that good privacy policies make good business policies. protecting privacy plays an important role in the exercise of first amendment rights Ensuring that we have adequate privacy laws has a more significant and important role in our democracy than just fostering high-tech businesses. We also must defend on-line freedom from heavy-handed content regulation. That was my purpose in voting against the unconstitutional Communications Decency Act that became law in 1996. Stopping efforts to create government censors is critical to allow our First Amendment rights to flourish, but it is not enough. For people to feel comfortable in exercising their First Amendment rights-- by speaking, traveling and associating freely online or in physical space--they must be able to keep their activities confidential and private. When Big Brother is watching, the exercise of First Amendment rights is chilled no less than the threat of a government censor. It is therefore not surprising that our country has a long and honorable tradition of keeping our identities private when we exercise our First Amendment rights. ``The Federalist Papers,'' which is probably the most important political document ever written about our Constitution, was authored anonymously by James Madison, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton and published under a pseudonym. Healthy advocacy and debate often rests on the ability of participants to keep their identities private and to act anonymously. Indeed, the Supreme Court has said, ``Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.'' Healthy commerce also depends on satisfying consumers' desire to keep their business affairs private and secure. A report I released last month on Vermont Internet commerce is telling on this point. The strongest obstacle among consumers from shopping and doing business online was their fear of the online security risks. This is why promoting the use of encryption is so important, so that businesses and consumers can use this technology to provide the privacy and security they want and that best suits their needs. I plan to introduce privacy legislation to ensure that Americans' Fourth Amendment rights to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable government searches and seizures are given ample protection in a networked computer environment. In addition, several provisions in the bill will address the concern Americans have about the use of their personally identifiable records and information by businesses, satellite carriers, libraries and book sellers. industry self-regulation efforts should be encouraged In contrast to a citizen's relationship with his or her government, consumers have a choice of whether they want to deal or interact with those in the private sector. In my view, this choice should be generally recognized in the law by allowing consumers and businesses in the marketplace to set the terms of their interaction. This is an area where the Congress should tread cautiously before regulating. Online businesses are engaging in serious efforts to make available to consumers information on privacy policies so that consumers are able to make more educated choices on whether they want to deal. I commend and applaud those efforts. That being said, however, current laws do not apply privacy principles in an even-handed manner. Video rental stores and cable operators are subject to privacy laws to protect our right to keep our viewing habits private, but no protections exist for the books we borrow from the library or buy from a bookstore, or the shows we watch via satellite. I am introducing a bill to provide more uniform privacy protection for both books and videos, no matter the medium of delivery. Similarly, telephone companies and cable operators are subject to legal restrictions on how they may use personally identifiable information about their Internet subscribers, while other Internet and online service providers are not. The E-RIGHTS bill I am introducing would promote a more level playing field in terms of the privacy protections available to Internet users, no matter whether they obtain their Internet access from AOL, their cable company or their local phone company. this legislation addresses a broad range of emerging high-tech privacy issues For example: When should the FBI be allowed to use cell phones to track a user's movements? Should Kosovo human rights organizations that use Web sites to correct government misinformation be able to get domain names without having their names publicly available on a database? Should we have the same ability to get an ``unlisted'' domain name (or Internet address) as we are able to get an ``unlisted'' phone number? Should we allow other federal prosecutors to act like Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr and go on fishing expeditions with subpoenas issued to bookstores to find out what we are reading? Should we protect our choices of reading and viewing materials the same way we protect our choice of videotapes that we rent from our local Blockbuster? Should people who maintain their calendars on Yahoo! get the same privacy protection as those who keep their calendars on their desk or on their PC's hard-drive? Will people avoid certain network services offered by Netscape or new Internet start-ups because they get less privacy protection for the information stored on the network than on their own PC's? These are all important issues, and I have worked to propose solutions to each of these and to other questions, as well, in the E- RIGHTS bill I am introducing. I invite each of the witnesses and others with interests in these matters to exchange ideas on these topics. There are few matters more important than privacy in maintaining our core democratic values. The Chairman. We will turn to you now, Mr. Sheridan. We respect all the things that you have done to cause angst throughout the operating platform community. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL SHERIDAN Mr. Sheridan. Good. The Chairman. Yes, it is good, and we are delighted to have you here. Senator Leahy. Good word, ``angst.'' The Chairman. Yes. We have had a lot of that expressed here before this committee, by the way. Mr. Sheridan. I can feel it. The Chairman. Yes. Mr. Sheridan. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, good morning, and thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to testify on this important issue. My name is Mike Sheridan. I am Vice President of Strategic Businesses and a member of the Executive Committee of Novell, Inc., which is the world's largest provider of directory- enabled network software, and which is located in the great State of Utah. Prior to coming to Novell in 1988, I worked at Sun Microsystems, where I was one of the original members of the team that created the Java programming language. I testify before the committee today not as an expert in privacy policy, but as a technologist who is building software products that are relevant to the online privacy debate. At Novell, we view online privacy as an extension of Internet identity, since it is all about empowering users to make decisions about how much information they want to share and with whom. It will come as no surprise to you that I believe that the first line of defense for online privacy is commercial technology. The genius of Net culture is the immediacy with which it funnels resources to new areas and the furious pace, known as Internet time, at which it develops new products. Several new firms have already been established to address privacy on the Web and are attracting significant amounts of venture capital. To the extent possible, we should let the marketplace address privacy concerns, since it will deliver the fastest, most flexible and most cost-efficient solutions. The second line of defense is industry self-regulation. Before we regulate the Net, we must let the private sector attempt to develop best practices and industry norms that satisfy consumers' needs. The Online Privacy Alliance, TRUSTe, BBBOnLine and the Platform for Privacy Preferences exemplify this effort. We are making steady progress, as witnessed by the rather dramatic increase in the number of privacy policies posted across the Net. Only after we have given commercial technology and self-regulation a chance to work should we turn to government intervention and regulation, and even then we must be sure that it supports America's leadership of the networked economy and needs of consumers. The first phase of the Internet was really all about getting connected, and companies like AOL made it easy to do this and led the way. For the past years, we have focused on connecting individuals, schools, government and businesses to the Net. The next phase, which is just beginning, will be about creating and managing digital identities. Novell believes that the best way to build the world of Internet identities is to develop products that let individual users create, manage and secure them. The directory, a sort of network white pages, is at the center of our efforts to do so. Identities and directories are two sides of the same coin. Identities describe who you are on the Net. Directories process this information so that you can connect to the right people, applications and services. An example of the new technologies that will allow individual choice to govern individual privacy is a product called digitalme. This product reflects Novell's belief that the best way to resolve privacy concerns is to address the larger identity issue. Digitalme allows users to enter and modify personal data in the directory themselves, and to control who has access to it. In other words, it lets people specify the personal information they want to reveal, if any. By providing such tools that allow users to manage their Internet identity, we can educate them about their online privacy. Because no one technology or company can guarantee privacy on the Web, Novell is also working to promote industry self- regulation. We are currently in discussion with BBBOnLine and are already a member of the Online Privacy Alliance and a premier sponsor and licensee of TRUSTe. Our privacy policy, which is posted on our Web site, was created in accordance with the guidelines of these two groups, as well as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and EU Directive on Data Protection. Mr. Chairman, the privacy debate has at times been difficult for the Internet industry. But it has also been very constructive, since it has helped reveal consumer preferences, industry responsibilities, and the new landscape of e-commerce. We should not cut off this debate by pretending that Internet privacy concerns don't exist. Nor should we pass premature legislation that assumes we know all of the answers. For now, government should encourage private sector solutions, investigate and prosecute deceptive business practices, and monitor privacy abuses to determine the actual harm to consumers. Only after we are satisfied that the private sector cannot meet consumers' needs through commercial technologies and self-regulation should we consider government intervention. Thank you very much. The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Sheridan.

What do we mean by online privacy? At Novell, we view it as an extension of Internet identity. It is about empowering users to make decisions about how much information they wish to share and with whom. With all the press attention that online privacy is getting has come a chorus of calls for government legislation and regulations. We should exercise great caution in responding to them. We are in the early stages of the next big phase of the Internet--a phase that will focus on the creation and management of digital identities and relationships. It would be a mistake to pass legislation regulating privacy on the Net before we fully understand the commercial products and services that will be available to us in this new environment. The first line of defense for online privacy is commercial technology. The genius of Net culture is the immediacy with which it funnels talent and resources to new areas--like protection of personal privacy--and the furious pace at which it develops new products. Entrepreneurs have already established several new firms to address privacy on the web, and they are attracting significant amounts of venture capital. We must allow the market to address privacy concerns to the greatest extent possible since it will deliver solutions that are the most flexible, speedy and cost-efficient.

Only after we have given commercial technology and self-regulation a chance to work should we turn to government intervention, and even then we must be sure that they support America's leadership in the networked economy and the needs of consumers. In my comments today, I will examine three issues that are central to the privacy debate: (1) The next phase of the Internet; (2) The promise of commercial technology; and (3) The principles for future progress. 1. the next phase of the internet: the identity wave The Internet began as a Department of Defense research project and for many years was used primarily by scientists at national laboratories and research universities. The first big wave of the Internet occurred in the mid-1990's with the advent of the world wide web and the browser. Suddenly, it was easy to surf the Net, and there was a scramble to connect. Companies like Netscape and AOL led the way. Businesses wanted to connect to improve their communications and productivity. Schools wanted to connect to improve educational opportunities; government at all levels wanted to connect to enhance their operations; and individuals wanted to connect to the new world of digital information. Today, US Internet users number about 80 million. The Internet is having an economic impact that is on the scale of the industrial revolution, and it is occurring much faster. The connection phase will continue for several years as we build out the infrastructure of the web, but it is about to be supplanted by something else--the identity wave. Now that the problems of getting online, getting a browser and using the Net have been largely overcome, we are faced with massive scale issues. These scale issues are really identity problems. How do I find what I want? How do I control my identity when it is scattered over dozens of different sites? How do I keep track of all my passwords? How do I authenticate my digital relationships? How to manage a system this complex in ways that create trust? Questions about Internet identity are closely related to privacy, but they are not synonymous. Privacy is only one aspect of this identity, albeit a very important one. The best way to resolve privacy concerns is to address the larger issue of how to manage Internet identities. The transition from the connection phase of the Internet to the identity phase should carry a red flag for public policymakers. Instead of being well along a road we already know we are moving into unfamiliar terrain. Decentralized decision-making and market solutions will serve us better during this transition than centralized government policy since they can respond more quickly and more flexibly to consumers' needs. 2. the promise of commercial technology: directories and digitalme TM Entire new companies are being formed and many technologies are being developed to deal with different aspects of online privacy. I cite Novell's approach, not as a panacea, but to illustrate the innovative ways that industry is beginning to respond. Novell believes that online privacy is an extension of Internet identity and that by addressing the broader issue of identity we can resolve many privacy concerns. The key to building a world of Internet identities is to develop products that let individual users create, manage and secure them. The directory is at the center of our efforts to do so. A true Internet directory is an integrating layer of software that cuts across operating systems to provide a platform for network services. Without a directory, you cannot find, manage or use your network. Directories are what allow network administrators to keep networks up and ready for the user, regardless of where he is or what device he has. Perhaps the simplest way to think of directories is to compare them to the white pages of a telephone book. Just as white pages contain the information for telephone identities, directories contain the information for Internet identities. But while the white pages are nothing more than a reference guide, a directory is a dynamic database that makes it easy to manage networks, maintain digital interactions and, ultimately, enable widespread electronic commerce. Digital identities and network directories are two sides of the same coin. Identities describe who you are on the Net; directories process this information so that you can connect to the right people, applications, services and devices. Novell recently announced a new identity product called digitalme TM that leverages Novell Directory Services so that consumers and businesses can manage their digital identities. Consumers are looking for secure ways to manage and protect their personal information (such as bookmarks, cookies, preferences, user IDs, credit cards and contact information) since these attributes define what they can do, where they can go, and who they are on the web. Companies are looking for opportunities to differentiate their business by creating secure, personalized services that are beneficial to customers. digitalme TM has a flexible interface built around digital ``cards.'' These virtual meCards can be customized so that users share different information about themselves with different sites based on their personal preferences. For example, a user may want a card for their favorite airline to hold information about their frequent flyer number, their e-mail address, their telephone number, their business travel patterns and their favorite vacation destinations. Voluntarily providing this information would allow the airline to customize its interactions with the user so that if low fares to the users favorite vacation spot are available, for example, the airline can alert them. The same user would provide an entirely different set of personal information to his bank or local hospital. Since the user knows what information he shares, who he shares it with, and when he shares it, he is in more control of his identity on the Net and more aware of his Internet privacy. digitalme TM is all about user choice. It is downloaded voluntarily from the Net, and is designed so users can enter only the information that they want to share. If they choose to include highly sensitive information a trusted third-party can hold it for them. It puts users in control. By giving users control of their identities, it allows them to create customized solutions that meet their individual needs. 3. principles for future progress Some seem to have already come to the conclusion that prompt government intervention is necessary to address concerns about online privacy. Surveys show the protection of personal privacy is the number- one concern many people have about the Internet. And advocates of this view note that it is easier than ever for businesses to gather digital information about consumers without their knowledge or consent and to use this data to market products, or worse, in discriminatory and invasive ways. There is no doubt that the issue of Internet privacy raises legitimate questions about the rights of web users. To the extent that it leads to the erosion of consumer confidence in the Net, it could even retard the growth of electronic commerce. Nonetheless, it is too early to make a judgement about the need for privacy legislation. Just like the Internet, our understanding of digital privacy is still evolving. The success of Free-PC shows that many consumers are only too happy to trade their privacy rights given the right incentives. And although Internet identifiers can create an invasion of privacy, they are also what allowed the FBI to find the perpetrator of the Melissa virus and to discover who posted the fraudulent Internet articles that artificially inflated the stock price of Pairgain Technologies. In order to balance these competing concerns, many companies have created privacy policies that share a common set of guidelines. Among the most important are giving consumers notice before gathering any personal data, disclosing how any information that is collected will be used, and letting users choose to opt out of personal data transfers that are not necessary to complete a transaction. Novell's policy, which is posted on our web site at www.novell.com, was created in accordance with the guidelines set forth by TRUSTe, the Online Privacy Alliance (OPA), the US Federal Trade Commission, and the EU Directive on Data Protection. It consists of the following guidelines: 1. In general, people may visit Novell web sites while remaining anonymous and not revealing any personal information. Novell will at times request basic data--such as name, address and e-mail--in order to respond to visitors queries about our products or services, but we will not contact you with additional marketing information unless you indicate that you want to receive it. 2. Novell will not disclose your personal information for marketing purposes to any third-party company without your consent. 3. Novell will not collect information from people who identify themselves as being younger than 18 years of age. 4. Novell may use cookie technology only to obtain non-personal information from its on-line visitors to improve their on-line experience. If you do not wish to have a cookie set when visiting the Novell web sites, you may alter the settings on your browser to prevent them. 5. Novell will take appropriate steps to respect and protect the information you share with us. Whenever you give Novell sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers), Novell will take commercially reasonable steps to establish a secure connection with your web browser. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes. 6. All of the information Novell gathers will be available to you at the Novell Identity web page. From this site you can see what kind of information Novell has collected from your visit to our web site and update the information you have provided us in your personal profile. From this site you can also indicate that you would rather be anonymous and provide no information about yourself or your visit to our web site. As the debate about Internet privacy evolves, we should look to the following principles to guide our efforts: 1. Rely on market-inspired solutions as much as possible The private sector still has a lot of work to do, but we should not let the highly publicized privacy problems of the past few months distract us from the real progress that has been made. Many organizations have invested a lot of time, effort and money to create a self-regulatory system in which business takes real steps to protect online privacy. OPA, TRUSTe and BBBOnline have educated industry about the issue. Novell and several other companies have developed technologies that hold promise. AOL has made a huge effort to educate consumers. AT&T has funded studies to better understand consumer demand. And IBM has withheld advertising dollars from sites that do not have privacy policies. As a result of these actions, new products are beginning to emerge and privacy policies are steadily proliferating across the Net. If the government decides to take legislative or regulatory action, it should persist in its role as champion of best commercial practice. The private sector is likely to develop faster, more flexible and more cost-efficient solutions than the government and should be encouraged to do so. 2. Refrain from a one-size-fits-all policy approach Just as no one technology or company can solve the privacy issue, neither can any one policy. Not all information is equal. Some data-- such as medical and financial data, and information about children--is especially sensitive. Other types of data can be quite mundane. Moreover, different users have different privacy preferences. Aggressive legislation that treats privacy as a uniform problem could create more problems than it solves. 3. Keep government intervention consistent with the Internet Where government involvement is needed, it should support and enforce a predictable, minimalist, transparent and simple legal environment. Government should follow a decentralized, technology- neutral approach to policy that encourages private sector innovation. It should refrain from picking technology winners or implementing policies that undermine America's leadership of the networked economy. 4. Enforce existing laws and self-regulation The government already has an extensive mandate to protect consumer welfare and should vigilantly enforce laws that prevent deceptive trade practices on the Net. Preventing fraud and false advertising are as essential to consumer confidence and the growth of e-commerce as they are to ordinary commerce. 4. conclusion Mr. Chairman, the privacy debate has at times been difficult for the Internet industry, but it has also been very constructive since it has helped reveal consumer preferences and the new landscape of e- commerce. Just as importantly, it has highlighted industry responsibilities and made us think hard about the appropriate role for public policy. We should not cut off this debate by pretending that Internet privacy concerns don't exist. Nor should we pass premature legislation that assumes we know all the answers. For now, government's role is to encourage private sector solutions, investigate and prosecute deceptive business practices, and monitor privacy abuses to determine the actual harm to consumers. Only after we are convinced that the private-sector cannot meet consumers needs through commercial products and self-regulation should we consider government intervention. The Chairman. Mr. Wladawsky-Berger. STATEMENT OF IRVING WLADAWSKY-BERGER Mr. Wladawsky-Berger. Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the question of privacy in the emerging digital age. My name is Irving Wladawsky-Berger and I am the General Manager of IBM's Internet Division. Let me begin by reiterating that all of us, individuals and businesses alike, derive incredible benefit from the free flow of information over the Internet. At any hour, day or night, people can check the status of a shipment, analyze their investment portfolios, or compare prices over a whole universe of suppliers. Likewise, businesses gain efficiencies they could only dream of before the Internet, efficiencies that restrain prices and bring them closer to their customers. All this requires information, lots of it. So, clearly, it is in everyone's interest that the privacy of information be protected. After all, the consumer's embrace of the Internet and the electronic marketplace it makes possible will only last as long as they try us and all the other participants in that marketplace to respect their privacy. IBM is no stranger to this issue, and we have been working on privacy issues ever since the 1960's. Not surprisingly, then, in 1997 we adopted a worldwide privacy policy for our thousands of Web pages, and at the same time recognized the need for industry to unite on some basic principles and actions. In fact, we have played key roles in the establishment of the Online Privacy Alliance and the TRUSTe and BBBOnLine Privacy Seal programs. We actively support Call for Action, which is an educational program to educate consumers on what they should look for, for privacy on the Web sites. Most recently, IBM announced that, effective June 1, we would no longer advertise on United States and Canadian Web sites that did not post privacy policies. And as the second largest advertiser on the Web, our action, we hope, should influence the practices of others. That commitment to privacy, and our experience in making the promise of the Net real for thousands of customers, gives us an excellent vantage point from which to view this issue. It seems to us at IBM that the key question to be answered at this point is how can our society strike the right balance between the value of a free flow of information and privacy. How can that flow of information be not just free, but fair as well? In our opinion, a broad new statute is not the answer. The Internet is too global, too instantaneous and too decentralized for a fixed, rigid statute to regulate it. The Net and its related technologies simply change too quickly to be amenable to centralized control. We strongly believe that the best way to strike the balance between the free flow of information on the Net and privacy protection is through market forces, which are invariably the product of consumer preferences. This self-regulation would ride atop a broad base of consumer protection laws and targeted sectoral regulation. This approach envisions a mix of business involvement and commitment, government support and targeted action, international cooperation among businesses and governments, as well as individual responsibility. Government should defer to private sector leadership for any number of reasons. Number one, the private sector has many incentives to respect privacy, not the least of which is self- interest. The members of the business community simply have too much to gain from the freest possible flow of information and too much to lose if concerns over privacy limit the growth of the networked economy. Second, excessive regulation can exclude many small and medium firms from the e-business marketplace. We believe that one of the most important opportunities in electronic commerce is to level the playing field, to allow not just the large companies but the smaller companies to participate. We want e- business to benefit Main Street, not just Wall Street. Third, private sector self-regulation can adapt and change much more quickly and responsibly than government regulation. Fourth, the Internet and the e-business marketplace are fresh, new phenomena and should be regulated very, very carefully and only with good cause. And, finally, the fifth reason for deferring to market forces is the fact that on the Internet information is borderless and the Web itself decentralized, complicating immeasurably all efforts to impose traditional regulation. The last few years have seen any number of promising marketplace privacy initiatives, and I believe a lot of progress is being made. As my colleague from AOL said, one of the most promising efforts is the Online Privacy Alliance, a cross-industry group established in 1998 to agree on a basic framework for privacy policies tailored to individual industries. My written statement goes more into detail about the practices of the Alliance. Let me just very quickly talk about what is it based on. Number one, each company should adopt and implement a privacy and post it at its Web site. Two, each visitor to a site should be informed of what personal information is collected at its site, its use, and whether it will be disclosed to others. Third, visitors to a site should have a choice in whether information will be disclosed to others. Fourth, the Web site owner should take reasonable steps to keep the information secure. And, fifth, the owner should take reasonable steps to keep data accurate and to provide individuals as much access to their identifiable data as is possible. Let me just conclude by thanking you for the opportunity to appear before you, and afterwards I will be pleased to answer any questions. The Chairman. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Wladawsky-Berger follows:] Prepared Statement of Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, and Members of the Committee, thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment on the question of privacy in the emerging Digital Age. My name is Irving Wladawsky-Berger and I am the General Manager of IBM's Internet Division. In that capacity I am responsible for IBM's Internet strategy, and for driving its implementation across the company. I am also privileged to serve on the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee. As you may know, IBM is the largest information technology company in the world, with over $81 billion in 1998 revenue and over 290,000 employees worldwide. We believe this gives us a unique vantage point from which to comment on privacy in the digital age, working as we do with leaders of large, medium and small companies and with governments worldwide, helping them navigate the historic shift to a networked world, and offering them business solutions in the form of expertise, services and technology. i. the value of information in the information age With every passing day it becomes more certain that the Internet will take its place alongside the other great transformational technologies that first challenged, and then fundamentally changed, the way things are done in this world. But with all respect, let me begin my comments by suggesting that, while technological advances in our industry continue at an amazing pace, it is information not technology, that is at the heart of this revolution. Information has never been more important than today, when we are engaged in a fundamental transformation of commerce, education, health care, and government--indeed, just about every institution in society that serves individual Americans either as consumers or citizens. For every business, information has assumed an increasingly strategic role. Information is their competitive advantage. It is what allows them to differentiate themselves from all the others in the marketplace who are trying to serve the public. Leveraging the Internet and other networks so that businesses can better work for all their constituents is what we in IBM call e- business. Indeed e-business is our key market strategy. We have worked in the marketplace with many thousands of our customers around the world to help them implement e-business strategies. And, one of the things we have learned in the process is that the more information is available to business, government and other institutions, and the more intelligently it is used, the better the job they do serving their customers, dealing with business partners, and running an effective organization. The cumulative effects of all these improvements are greater convenience for consumers, more satisfied constituents, and lower costs that can be passed on to customers in the form of price reductions. For example, customer self-service applications let consumers obtain whatever information they need anytime of the day or night, whether it is locating a package they have shipped, analyzing the status of their investments, or getting expert advice about a purchase they are contemplating. Moreover, with the amount of information in the World Wide Web growing at a prodigious rate, businesses are increasingly capable of using automated ``personalization'' techniques, leading questions based on the customer's known needs and wants, to help consumers better navigate through the growing sea of information. Similar personalization techniques permit retailers to cement relationships with customers by offering promotions on items shoppers are most likely to want. In fact, the Safeway supermarket chain in the United Kingdom typically gets a remarkable fifty percent-plus response rate to their direct promotions based on this simple premise: offering discounts on items they know customers are likely to buy anyway--and Safeway knows what they are likely to buy because of the information people have entrusted to them. This same retailer, in devising additional customer loyalty programs, discovered that people hate to write shopping lists and invariably forget certain items. So, in cooperation with our research labs, they are piloting a program in which customers get shopping lists matched to their buying patterns. The lists are downloaded to a portable device the customer picks up as he or she enters the supermarket. This same device scans the items as the customer selects them, thus significantly reducing the time spent checking out. Health care is an area of enormous promise as well. We are working with practitioners around the world to establish high-security health information networks that connect physicians, laboratories and hospitals. With much more timely health information available, patients can receive faster, more effective treatment, and the significantly lower administrative expenses could help restrain medical costs. But the real promise of these health care networks is the possibility of subjecting all that information to highly sophisticated supercomputing analysis--what we call Deep Computing, since it is similar to that developed in our research labs for our Deep Blue chess playing application--and developing a truly ``intelligent'' assistant able to deliver expert medical advice to health care professionals. Such expert assistance could be available over networks to practitioners everywhere, in a famous urban medical center or a small rural practice. In addition, such sophisticated information analysis can infuse far better forecasting and planning into business processes of all sorts. For example, our research laboratories are working with an airline to apply Deep Computing techniques to the scheduling of crew assignments. That improves not only the airline's efficiency, but working conditions as well by matching assignments as much as possible with the preferences of their flight personnel. That's a great convenience for the flight crews certainly, but it also saves the airline over $80 million annually, costs that would otherwise find their way into airline fare schedules to be paid by the consumer. In the final analysis, if the digital age is about anything, it is about using information to empower individuals, be they consumers or citizens. ii. addressing privacy expectations: ibm's longstanding commitment Incredible prospects exist for enriching the lives of customers, patients, citizens, or just plain individuals by using their information for their benefit, not for their exploitation. And the opportunity to obtain and use that information constitutes a competitive advantage for business. With all that at stake, it stands to reason that the business community has keen incentive to meet people's privacy needs. This is why IBM takes people's concern for the privacy of their information very, very seriously. IBM understands that consumers will continue to embrace the Internet, and the electronic marketplace it makes possible, only to the degree that they trust those who use the technology to respect the privacy of their personal information. Equipping consumers with knowledge and choice about how their personal information is used is key to building such confidence and trust. We strive to lead by example via our own policies and behaviors. And we have done so for three decades--a long term commitment to individual privacy, one that predates, in many ways, the policies of industry and government. 1960's IBM adopted our first formalized and global privacy policy, on handling of employee data, establishing employee access to their personnel folder, well before the practice became common in the workplace. 1970's and 1980's We formulated specific guidelines and principles, applicable worldwide, on the handling of employee and other data (such as medical records). We instituted management training to ensure compliance. IBM also participated via business groups in the formulation in 1980 of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and the Transborder Flow of Personal Data. These Guidelines underlie much of the international community's thinking about privacy protection and IBM supports the spirit and intent of the OECD Guidelines. 1990's As the decade of the Internet began, it was characterized by much hype and a lot of trial and error, but now by the end of the decade the Net emerged as a new mass medium that is transforming how we work, buy, sell, play and learn. As use of the Internet and other networked technologies grew, the need for IBM to renew and refocus its commitment on today's privacy issues became clear. Therefore, in 1997 we adopted and implemented a worldwide privacy policy for our thousands of web pages operating as part of ibm.com. A copy of our corporate privacy policy statement from www.ibm.com is attached as an Exhibit. Within IBM, we supported adoption of our Web privacy policy with executive communications and the establishment of a new executive position responsible for our internal privacy practices, reporting to IBM's Chief Information Officer. And we recognized the need for independent third-party backups to company policies, and thus sponsored the formation and launch of both the TRUSTe and BBBOnline privacy seal programs. We also played a key role in the organization and launch of the cross-industry Online Privacy Alliance, the principles of which I describe below. TRUSTe and BBBOnline are independent non-profit groups that can provide consumer assistance and dispute handling for privacy-related questions, and in the case of BBBOnline can respond to any and all consumer queries or complaints. We backed up our own policy by enrolling in the TRUSTe program last year. IBM also organized or sponsored a number of customer briefings on the issue. In 1998 alone, for example, we hosted a conference in New York City for over 100 senior executives from various business and government organizations. We hosted Secretary of Commerce Bill Daley for a roundtable with over 30 senior executives. With the Software Publishers Association (now the Software and Information Industry Association) we co-sponsored a series of a dozen workshops on web privacy policies. Recognizing the needs some businesses will have in this area for expert assistance, we also formed a dedicated consulting team in our IBM Global Services division to guide organizations (large and small) through the process of creating and implementing practices that comply with applicable privacy policies or regulations. This team relies on the concept of a ``Privacy Architecture'' to help organizations adopt the appropriate mix of policies and technologies to manage the privacy and security commitments they make. We also supported efforts to educate consumers on how to protect their privacy online, most notably funding an effort by Call for Action, a consumer assistance organization, to publicize its ``ABCs of Privacy.'' I've included a sample sticker pamphlet as an Exhibit, and you can find more of their information on www.callforaction.org. To their credit, Circuit City supported Call for Action's efforts during the 1998 Holiday season by allowing the organization to distribute this material through their 500-plus stores in the United States. And most recently, IBM last month stepped forward and announced that, effective June 1, we would no longer advertise on U.S. and Canadian Web sites that did not post privacy policies. As the second largest advertiser on the Web, we believe that our action will influence the practices of other market players. Attached as an Exhibit is the letter sent by our advertising agency, OgilvyOne, to over 350 Web site owners, informing them of our policy. iii. spreading the adoption of online fair information practices The key question before all of us at this point is how our society as a whole--business, government and individuals--will strike the right balance between the free and fair flow of information and the reasonable expectations of privacy. In particular, what is the right balance between legitimate government action and the rewards and sanctions of the marketplace? IBM, led by our CEO Lou Gerstner, has thought about this question a great deal, drawing on our decades of experience with privacy, technology, and business practices. Frankly, we want rapid progress in adoption of ``fair information practices'' by organizations that handle personal data--so that the e-business marketplace, and consumer acceptance of it--will continue to grow at double-digit rates. We also appreciate that U.S. policy makers and other important stakeholders also want rapid progress--especially since electronic commerce has been recognized as a major economic driver of the U.S. economy's success entering the 21st century. A new statute is not the answer. It would be relatively easy, I suspect, for some to fall into the trap of thinking that enacting a simple statute that tries to make those who operate on the Internet, through whatever means, ``respect privacy.'' But that would give a false guarantee to our citizens--a single ``one size fits all'' approach could never really meet their expectations for privacy protection, especially in such a complex and fast moving medium as the Internet. The Internet presents some special challenges that stem from its wonderful and unique attributes. All at once it is: global, instantaneous, and decentralized. Information flows through many packets in order to get routed to its final destination, relying on a very international distribution system that is by its nature decentralized and under no one's ultimate control. The Net and its related technologies change quickly as well. For example, the Internet2 and Next Generation Internet initiatives, under development now in the United States, will soon make it possible to share richer stores of data, much more quickly than before. New technologies and new online startups are challenging us all with their continual changes and new business models. We strongly believe, therefore, that given these attributes the best way to strike the balance between information flow and privacy protection on the Net is through private sector leadership--what many call ``self-regulation''--built atop a base of broad consumer protection laws and targeted sectoral regulation. In order to succeed, we need a mix of business involvement and commitment; government support and targeted action; international cooperation among businesses and governments; and individual responsibility. IBM strongly supports such a ``layered'' approach to privacy protection. Where specific, sectoral concerns are identified and are not adequately addressed by self-regulation, some amount of legislation or regulation may be needed. For example, IBM has for several years supported the enactment of medical records privacy legislation--medical data are among the most sensitive data an individual can share, and for that type of data we support a comprehensive statutory framework. But with respect to the Internet and electronic commerce generally, we believe"
