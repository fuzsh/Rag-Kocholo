THE TRUTH ABOUT MICROSOFT Backed by Popular Demand? Finally! Someone who's not afraid to speak the truth (\"The Color of Microsoft,\" John C. Dvorak, January, page 65). Bill Gates woke up and saw that this new Internet thing had great potential. Then he decided that Microsoft would make a concerted effort in that direction. I laud his efforts but not his tactics. If Gates wants to compete, let Microsoft put a browser on the market and price it in line with the competition— and let the public choose. Joe Michels via the Internet Redmond Racket As a Micron Electronics employee, I know Microsoft has often used fear 'of being cut off from Windows to control what computer manufacturers offer (\"The Color of Microsoft, \" John C. Dvo- rak, January). Even before Windows 95 was introduced, the rumor around Micron was that we had to sell a mini- mum number of copies of Microsoft Bob to get a lower price for Windows 95. Our fear of reprisal pushed Bob on customers. I was especially proud when Micron president Eric Browning spoke to the Justice Department about Microsoft's de facto control over what we offer cus- tomers. My pride dissipated, however, when Browning decided to kiss and make up with Bill Gates. Good thing our com- puters have significantly more spunk than our senior execs. Name Withheld by Request via the Internet Sour Grapes? Department is going after Microsoft. After installing the trial version of Money 98 the program prompts you for Internet Explorer to continue. This is yet another Microsoft tactic to force users to load its browser. David Schmitz via the Internet Package Deal 'The >est 225, pro duct: ■ of t heYear . h„0KS < PliBl,r ... Hot\" 00 * . st0 r3?» ; S« r <«'* . . Hard**'* 1 . .■ &r»*» ,cs little* WW!' Windows isn't a monopoly (\"Trie Color of Microsoft,\" John C. Dvorak, January). Anybody has the right to make an operat- ing system, and if it's better (and costs less) than the competition people will buy it. It would be ideal if all software came in one package: OS, word processor, spreadsheet, browser, e-mail, finance, and anything else a business needs. I envision companies using one package to compete in the years to come— running software on a central computer and hooking up via modem, or better yet a wireless connection. Peter Bricel via the Internet Washington Technophobes Thanks for your January commentary on our technophobic politicians (\"OS Police,\" Paul Somerson). I'm concerned that the United States can't establish a standard for data encryption. This is typical, considering the way our country's foreign policy uses brute force or subversion to move its will. Dan O'Donnell via the Internet John C. Dvorak sounds like a bitter man who didn't get on the Microsoft band- wagon in time to profit from its success (\"The Color of Microsoft,\" January). In this country, when did business not engage in screwing the competition? What's wrong with letting the market- place determine Bill Gates' success or WWW.PCCOMPUTlNG.COM failure? Did anyone stop Netscape or any other such operation from making arrangements with PC manufacturers to package their products? Leon Mitchell via the Internet Microsoft vs. DoJ Force-fed Browser I hope John C. Dvorak's January column (\"The Color of Microsoft\") enlightens some readers— including his colleague Paul Somerson (\"OS Police,\" January, page 61)— -on the real reasons the Justice Regarding Paul Somerson's January col- umn (\"OS Police\"), he's right about gov- ernment interference with the Internet. But I disagree with him about the Depart- ment of Justice's case against Microsoft. It isn't a vendetta. If Bill Gates believes that Internet Explorer 4.0 is such a superior product, then why does he give it away? And Gates' coercion of computer makers into bundling IE4 with Windows 95 and not including Netscape-^or else lose their right to the Microsoft OS— is monopoly in its true form. If Mr. Somerson can't see Mail • A\" P>a», No Work, the evil in these doings, he should call his Reader fOr Hire column the \"I Love Bill Corner.\" Marshall Foster via the Internet IT'S NOT A VENDETTA; it's purely political. But what's the big deal about giving IE away? It's essentially given away free when it's integrated in Windows 98. Netscape is about to start giving Navigator away too, and nothing prevents Win95 users from downloading it. There's no evil here, just smart, strong-arm marketing. Free Ride Taylor & Jerome are right in saying that people pay for content (\"Free Lunch,\" Jan- uary, page 63). But the problem is that a fee- based market will always be smaller than a market for those who want something for free. In the end, Web sites with valuable content succeed. But those that don't also succeed because they offer free stuff. Patrick Killips via the Internet Just wondering when I can expect a check from PC Computing for reading the ads in the magazine (\"Free Lunch,\" Taylor & Jerome, January). Free lunch on the Net won't last long, if history is any guide. Ed White via the Internet Bloody Bad Taste Ron White's flippant review of Offices- teria makes me sick (\"Take This Job and Spin It,\" CD-Ron, January, page 132). When White writes that he finds \"the .45 semiautomatic pistol and the bloody bul- let holes it makes in the boss's head a sat- isfying experience,\" should we assume that PC Computing's management allows this kind of game-playing? Dis- gruntled employees with firearms have murdered 7 of my coworkers over the past 25 years. Workplace violence is not cartoon violence. Curtis W. Swanson via the Internet LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE THIS STRAIGHT: Curtis works in an environment where even talking about violence is banned; Ron works for a company where violent games are permitted and Doom death matches are a 5 p.m. ritual. At Curtis's company, seven people have been killed by fellow employees; at Ron's office, no one has been killed by anybody. Where would you rather work? Good Read Once upon a time, articles in computer magazines were written like Japanese stereo-installation instructions. Thanks to PC Computing, those days are gone. For the last year I've read every issue from cover to cover. Reviews are short and sweet; the prose is amusing; and the information is invaluable.

The catch, though, is that it's on our lunch hour. Thomas Salvitti via the Internet Mouse Practice Some people spend too much time gam- ing at work, but that doesn't mean all games have no business value (Mail, Jan- uary). Simple games like solitaire exer- cise hand-mouse-screen coordination, which helps make my job as LAN man- ager (which defaults to me because I'm the most computer literate) a lot easier. As it is, I spend way too much time showing people how to navigate files and applications using the mouse and key- board.

You'll probably hear from a lot of people who say they do, and defend their waste of company time with a variety of specious arguments like, \"They owe it to me,\" or \"It enhances my mouse skills.\" These are the same people who feel companies shouldn't read employees' e-mail. Com- panies supply the equipment and pay the employees to do work. The employees should actually do some work. S.L. Fischer via CompuServe Waiting for Win98 Tcan'Twait for Windows 98 if it gets us out of the mess Windows 95 created (\"PC Rage,\" Paul Somerson, December, page 111). I don't care if there is no upgrade path. What difference does it make if you have to reinstall Windows 95 every six months? John Bowman via the Internet Wish List \"PC Rage\" was on target (Paul Somer- son, December). I have two wishes that would help. The first is that computer magazines rate tech support, help files, and uninstall features for all software; and second, that Toyota would start making hardware and software. Joe Sullivan via the Internet Not So Automatic Paul Somerson said exactly what I think in pQ|- fl]g ReCOrtl his column \"PC Rage\" (December). I've found myself in all the tight spots he men- tions. Any software with the word automation on the box is anything but, and will probably make my life miserable. Lee Kissell via the Internet it. It's just plain old Christmas spirit to brave the crowds to do your shopping. You say there's no waiting on the Inter- net? The wait is horrible on several shop- ping mall sites I've visited, mainly because it takes so long to download a photo of the item I want.

Some are alpha, some are numeric, some are alphanumeric, and they're all a pain. Easy pass- words are easy to guess, difficult ones are hard to remember. But passwords are about to get per- sonal, and we don't mean your mother's maiden name. Biomet- rics keep your information safe by using the most secure code of all — your physical traits. Once limited to the world of James Bond, The X-Files, and science-fiction movies, biomet- ric security technologies analyze physical characteristics to estab- lish a person's identity. From fingerprint and voice analysis to retinal scans and facial feature readers, biometric technologies render many password-security problems moot. Nobody can copy your fingerprints. No one will steal your retinal image. And even the best mimic can't match your voice patterns or facial features. High-tech? Yes. Expensive? Not really. Dozens of security-minded companies are making high- grade biometrics affordable. A Positive ID: Biometrics-based security devices read your fingerprints, listen to your voice patterns, and scan your retinas and facial features to establish your identity. handful of hospitals and police departments around the coun- try are already experimenting with biometric security and identification measures. Busi- nesses could spend between $150 and $1,000 for a reliable security system based on bio- metrics. That's a small price to pay for foolproof security. Most of the current biomet- ric products rely on the most mature physical identification science — fingerprint analysis. You register your identity by scanning in your fingerprints using a glass-prism print scanner that attaches to your computer system. The software then matches your fingerprints against the information in its database every time you log on.

More advanced biometrics are on the horizon. A few prod- ucts are already experimenting with using other identifying characteristics. Visionics' Face- It PC (www.faceit.com) turns your desktop videoconferenc- ing camera into a personal security device^it analyzes facial shapes, lines, and fea- tures, and compares a user's face with stored profile infor- mation. And Net Nanny Soft- ware's BioPasswords (www •netnanny.com), due out later this year, analyzes the speed, patterns, and intervals of key clicks on the keyboard when you type out your password. Someone might still steal your password, but if they don't type it exactly the way you do, they're out of luck. Of course, most biometric products come with their own caveats. This is a market of pro- prietary technologies, and with- out standards, a Tower of Babel looms. Though biometric data should remain private, a few shared open application pro- gram interfaces could help push development along. As much as consumers hate lost or stolen passwords, they also treasure their privacy. Skep- tics argue that biometrics means sharing too much sensitive information. But what biomet- rics most likely means for us is a world of faster access for autho- rized users, and tighter security against unauthorized ones. As our list of passwords— and our need to safeguard information- grows, biometrics may be the key to a more secure future, rs Iomega, Contributors to Pulse: Liesl La Grange Noble and Rich Schwerin.

Force-feedback input devices like Microsoft's joystick and the new Feel-it Mouse bring your desktop to life .ar Radios- Wh fl noario CM Pulse- NT Update Think Thin And the award for best code name for a secret Microsoft project goes to... Hydra. The vaguely menacing name creates a vivid image of what this NT Server add-on does, allowing thin client machines to access 32-bit Win- dows applications running on a remote server. By contrast, the official name _Microsoft Windows-based Terminal Server— is downright dull. Despite the prosaic name, Microsoft has big plans for Terminal Server, which is now available in bett versions. If it lives up to its advanced billing, it has the potential to displace entrenched mainframes and minicomputers, including IBM's popular but aging AS/400. Terminal Server is a throw- back to the days of time-sharing, with applications (including Microsoft nt muni WINDOWS NT 4.0 OPTION PACK Until recently, Microsoft used service packs to deliver new NT features and bug fixes in a single massive download. No more. The latest maior upgrade to NT represents a new philosophy: Service packs are for bug fixes only, the newest features appear instead in an Option Pack. The first of these appeared on Microsoft's Web site (www.microsoft.com/ ntserver) late last year. When you install the full update on an Nl Server you get Internet Information Server 4 (IIS4) with a full X.509 Certificate Server Transaction Server 2.0, Message QueueServer 1.0, and the Internet Connection Services for Microsoft RAS Interestingly, HS4 requires that you install Internet Explorer 4.01 on the server, and it s incompatible with Proxy Server 1.0. The full NT Option Pack lets you upgrade NT Server or NT Workstation, as you'd expect. In an unintuitive example of cross-coding, the Active Setup routine also installs the update on Windows 95. On NT and Win95 workstations, it installs only the Personal Web Server components and the Web Publishing Wizard. r.ndows based U Seivei CI Office, Project, and line-of- business apps from SAP and PeopleSoft) running on the server; the client machine simply displays the user interface and captures key- strokes and mouse clicks, to send to the server using the Remote Desktop Protocol. In theory, Terminal Server offers enormous sav- ings in hardware and admin- istrative costs. Instead of purchasing full-strength PCs capable of running NT Workstation, a corporation can simply install the client software on a terminal or a stripped-down PC with as little as 4MB of RAM. Because the server components and network protocols run on top of Windows NT Server 4.0 and support encryption, there s no need to sacrifice security, either. Beta 1 includes server-side compo- nents and basic client software for Windows 95, NT 4.0 Workstation, and Windows for Workgroups 3.11. A terminal client for Windows CL should appear later this year. HfKHnSFRun your 32-bit Windows aDDS with 4MB of RAM or less? Terminal sSets bare-bones PCs do it all remotely. Microsoft has lined up an impres- sive array of third parties to support Terminal Server, including hardware makers like Wyse, who suddenly see life in the moribund terminal market. Citrix Systems, which co-developed the Hydra software with Microsoft, will deliver enhanced versions later this year. Look for Citrix-branded Termi- nal Server management tools and client software for non-Windows clients. Terminal Server is scheduled tor final release in mid-1998; pricing is ED BOTT not yet set. BRIEFS Sun Replaces Java Virtual Machine In the latest episode of the ongoing tug-of-war between Sun Microsystems and Microsoft over Java, Sun has written a full replacement for the Java virtual machine included in Internet Explorer 4.0. (Find it at java.sun.com/ products /activator.) The new virtual machine lets developers exploit features that Microsoft removed from its own Java virtual machine. MSN for NT... Eventually Maybe the Microsoft Network isn't on its last legs. An NT- compatible \"Technical Beta\" of the MSN client software is available from fdlmsn .com/public/setup/ msn25nt4/default.htm. Microsoft promises that NT5 will include a working MSN client for the first time ever. Sign up for the MSN beta program at msnbeta.msn.com/ betainvite/ nt. Got the Time? PC clocks drift over time, and even a few seconds a day can add up to problems if you depend on an NT server to keep a far- flung network in sync. The best way to keep the correct time is to tap into the atomic clock at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
