        "text": "Join fine-art photographer Manuela Thames in the beautiful setting of Santa Fe to explore and cultivate your personal vision and artistic voice. Manuela offers a unique approach in helping you uncover the motivations behind your work and the voices you should listen to and those you should ignore.\n\nUsing the tools you have as a photographer—your equipment, imagination, and post processing options—this unique workshop provides a safe space for you to step outside your comfort zone, confront your fears, and gain a deeper understanding of your role and purpose as an artist. This transformative process ultimately provides a deeper understanding of yourself, your story, and your life’s path.\n\nThrough evocative writing exercises and photography prompts, Manuela guides you to explore creative vision, process, and practice. While discovering how to find inspiration and new ideas, you begin to uncover a deeper understanding of what it means to create original images and the importance of developing your vision.\n\nOur mornings are spent in the classroom providing feedback for each other’s work, listening, writing, and sharing insights. In the afternoons, we spend time creating new images on location in and around Santa Fe. We experiment with self-portraiture and also photograph models. There is also time to take individual photo walks practicing mindful observation.\n\nManuela’s workshop is perfect for photographers who desire to dive deeper, grow in their confidence as an artist, and strengthen the belief that their work matters and makes a difference in this world. Journey to New Mexico and partake in the creative spirit that resides deep within the land."
