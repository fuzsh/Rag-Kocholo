        "text": "Reviews are one of the chimeras that exhibitions leave behind along with, if we are lucky, archives, visitor books, and catalogs that record and imperfectly reinvoke their transient existence, the scholarship and resources that conjured them into being and the responses they elicited. Reviews have value, even when published after an exhibition closes, not only in its assessment, but as an integral part of its archive. The exhibition Arte de los Pueblos de México: Disrupciones Indígenas marks a turning point in public scholarship on the history and interpretation of what has variously been described as “artesanias,” “arte indigena,” and “artes populares,” which most assuredly warrants being widely recorded, remembered, argued over, and incorporated into the annals of critical museology, much as its curators, Juan Rafael Coronel Riviera, Octavio Murillo Álvarez de la Cadena, and Lucía Sanromán Aranda, and the director of the Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes, Miguel Fernández Félix, surely intended.\n\nArte de los Pueblos de México: Disrupciones Indígenas is the first major exhibition on Mexican “popular” art that in part is organized as a critical history of past approaches to its display and interpretations, and in part as a comprehensive panorama of cultural and material expressions including recent texts, poems, songs, and soundscapes produced by Indigenous and African-descendent artists and knowledge holders. It breaks new ground as a trilingual exhibition in Spanish, Nahuatl (central Highland valleys dialect), and English (via QR codes), and, in addition, it further expands access by incorporating sign language. Indigenous makers and artists are named when known, and throughout the exhibition works made by historical makers intermingle with those by contemporary practitioners working in diverse media including ceramics, wood, basketry, textiles, poetry, painting, photographic prints, film, and more besides. Most significant of all, the exhibition is intended to signify a sea change in methodology and perspective, one, moreover, hosted by the nation's most prestigious art museum, backed by the Ministry of Culture, which many scholars and critics once thought would always be impervious to Indigenous arts.\n\nThe exhibition was timed, although a month late, to coincide with the bicentenary celebration of Mexican independence, and the centenary of the earlier, much acclaimed Exposición Nacional de Artes Populares that opened at 85 Avenida Juárez on September 1921. Like its predecessor, with which it establishes a dialog, the 2022 exhibition celebrates its own revisionist view of Indigenous creativity based on a rearticulation of the relationship between the state, national identity, and the role of the arts, while at the same time acknowledging México's irreducible cultural diversity, artistic originality, and the inalienable rights, including that to self-expression, of Indigenous people and descendants of the African diaspora.\n\nThe new approach is signaled immediately by the first work the public encounters and by a powerful series of subsequent Indigenous statements. Salvador Xharicata's installation, “Jakeúrakua,” a composition incorporating a simple altar on which lie different colored ears of maize juxtaposed against Yoreme, Yoeme, and Makurawe masks and a banner reading “No nacimos ayer, no nacimos apenas hoy: Nacimos antes” (We are not born yesterday, we are not born just today, we are born before). This clearly sets the discursive frame of the exhibition and proclaims the ancient origins of Indigenous cultures and civilizations and the preeminence of maize and its impact in shaping their mode of life and political and territorial struggles.\n\nFollowing this powerful statement, there is a first-voice assertion by Teófila Palafox, an Ikoot (Huave) weaver and México's first Indigenous woman filmmaker: “A veces no somos reconocidos, estamos como un papel archivado en un lugar, no se dan cuenta de nosotros; necesitamos abrir ese archive” (Sometimes we are not recognized, we are like a document that has been archived somewhere, they don't recognize us, we need to open this archive). Her words could be understood as positioning the subsequent works as documents or records, and the exhibition itself as the archive finally prised open. This interpretation is backed by the P'urhépecha artist, Mario Augustín Gaspár, for whom: “El artisano es un historiador, pero no escribimos libros, escribimos la historia de nuestros pueblos en nuestros trabajos” (The craftsperson is an historian, but we don't write books, we write the history of our people through our works). The exhibition could be seen, therefore, to correspond to the role of an open archive embodying different Indigenous “things” and voices, although the curators are never far away, discreetly shaping its narrative structure. Interpretive texts clearly reinforce the desired paradigmatic shift, which at one point calls on Indigenous peoples to represent themselves from their own points of view and in their own voices. The search for the common spiritual essence, which its curators believed to lie beneath the diversity of the country's “popular” arts displayed in the 1921 exhibition and in its catalog, is here abandoned in favor of a historical and sociological appreciation of each community's singularity and the irreducibility of the experiences and creativity of their artists, writers, critics, and performers—although many such voices never escape from being imbedded and enunciated within a new curatorial narrative.\n\nSome positions, like the rejection of the Western linear view of history, implicit in Salvador Xharicata's, Noé Martínez's, and other Indigenous works, go uncommented. Despite this, the sheer incommensurability and sense of historical bewilderment cast by some of the extraordinary, seldom seen objects, such as the Comcáac and Kumial capes and immense seed baskets, the Chapey Kwapa bark painting, and more remarkable still, the tunic made from six bird skins, collapses any simple timeline and sense of place some visitors might once have cherished. There are other inspired curatorial choices too, like the powerful wooden deities in a box from the Winik atel (Tseltal) and O'de pict (Zoque) regions of Chiapas, which, if not for the labels, would have defied many of us, myself included, to assign them provenance or date. This encyclopedic coverage of Mexican Indigenous art, displaying works from communities from the extreme north to the south of the country, was only dreamt of by Jorge Enciso, Roberto Montenegro, and Dr. Atl, the curators of the 1921 exhibition, who, with their own limited knowledge and the help of the ethnographer Miguel Orthón Mendizábal, were nearly entirely dependent on whatever information and goodwill state governments and local officials provided them. Having failed to present an encyclopedic coverage in the 1921 exhibition, scholars had to wait a century before Arte de los Pueblos de México achieved those grand ambitions. Through the intervening years, though, far from such a panorama supporting the then-illusion of their supposedly shared spiritual and aesthetic unity, the artists and curators of Arte de los Pueblos de México confirm instead their irreducible diversity.\n\nThe exhibition, organized in a spatially confusing and disjunctive fashion, across four galleries on different levels, can be divided into two parts. The first part, divided into five periods, deconstructs what by now is a well-established periodization of the history of interpreting Mexican Indigenous arts and cultures. After providing a background summary of the Porfiriato (1876–1911), the exhibition focuses on five periods: first, the post-revolutionary period between 1917 and 1940; second, the period of Indigenismo during the decade of the 1940s, marked by the foundation of the Instituto Nacional Indigenista in 1948; third, the ethnographic turn, reflected in the opening of the Museo Nacional de Antropología in 1964; fourth, the decade of the 1980s and the surge of the vanguard movement represented by Guillermo Bonfil Batalla and the establishment of the Museo Nacional de Culturas Populares in 1982; and fifth, the period of acute commercialization characteristic of the last decades of the twentieth century.\n\nDuring the Porfiriato, the government adopted an evolutionary model of development, based on progress, measured by European industrial, commercial, and scientific innovation and advancement. Evolutionism, when applied to culture, marginalized the achievements of all but Western civilizations, and in México also provided an argument for dissolving the legal foundation of Indigenous communities and denying their inhabitants’ artistic capabilities, while, paradoxically, it simultaneously instigated the beginning of scientific archeological excavations and exalted a romanticized image of the Indigenous past and its residual antiquities. This model was punctured by the Revolution (1910–1917), which, after the social and political violence had subsided, consolidated the power of new elites, some of whom worked on the much-studied formation of a national identity based on a pastoral image of Indigenous peoples and rural laborers. The beginning of the post-Revolutionary period began to revise the centuries of prejudice against Indigenous people. No longer, the 2022 exhibition argues, were the rural poor thought backwards or inferior, as their arts and social and religious organizations were redeemed to furnish the icons of national identity.\n\nThis change in sensibility was crystallized in the influential 1921 Exposición Nacional de Artes Populares, which recognized differences in aesthetics and values and interpreted works as the “life expressions of Indigenous peoples,” with the hope that some at least might be commoditized and become marketable. After the 1921 exhibition, smaller displays were mounted, especially in the US, to promote México as a secure and prosperous country, making it attractive to investors and tourists alike. This was also the period when painting, literary work, music, cinema, and photography in Mexico celebrated Indigenous peoples as “the heroes of history” and provided the inspiration for the muralists and other artists and movements. By the 1940s, the growth of Indigenismo, championed by the anthropologist and politician Manuel Gamio, refocused attention on ways of assimilating Indigenous people into the wider society, effectively depreciating their culture and exacerbating the transformation of their arts into marketable commodities. The state slowly established local museum networks, schools, workshops, competitions, and a chain of shops to market Indigenous works. Craftspeople were encouraged to sign their works, thereby differentiating them from one another, and qualitative “expert” evaluations were introduced, which substantially altered the production, quality, and sometimes the style of popular arts and converted them into more “beautiful” commodities and more appropriate “emblems of Mexico in a globalizing world.” It is worth noting that similar romantic notions of Indigenous civilizations were also being elaborated elsewhere at this time in the Americas, such as in Argentina, based on the folklorization of the Andes, and in the United States, focused on the exoticization of the Indigenous peoples of New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nThe exhibition's articulation of these initial two periodizations is evoked through pottery, photographs of the excavations sponsored by Porfirio Díaz, and early books on Mexican archaeology. These two sections are more fully captured in the reproductions of some of the vitrines of the 1921 Exhibition, which grouped objects by materials and techniques. The reproductions made for the 2022 exhibition often use similar contemporary pieces to those displayed in 1921, which are critically juxtaposed with original works and photographs of the original cases. Books are displayed to capture the era's excitement and achievements, including the highly influential works by José Vasconcelos, Manuel Gamio, Adolfo Best Maugard, and Anita Brenner, which established the intellectual legitimations and aesthetic style of Indigenismo. There are also idealized photographs of Indigenous people by Luís Márquez Romay, Edward Weston, and the later work of Graciela Iturbide and Ruth Lechuga. These, as well as paintings belonging to the same romantic genre by Julio Castellanos, Rosario Cabrera, Diego Rivera, Julia López, Olga Casta, María Izquierdo, and Luis Nishizawa, are shown with pottery from old established villages, such as Azompa, Coyotepec, Izúcar de Matamoras, Acatlán de Osorio, and Metepec in Oaxaca, Puebla, and México. Exhibits include beautiful trees of life by Aurelio Flores and a magnificent candelabra by Herón Martínez Mendoza, both now sadly deceased.\n\nThe ideological role of interpretation in these first three historical periods in which Indigenous arts were clearly appropriated and subordinated to political projects and different inflexions of modernism have long been accepted in academic literature but have seldom influenced exhibition narratives; neither have they been so clearly articulated and projected into the public sphere as they are in this exhibition. Furthermore, what makes the exhibition different from most of those that preceded it are the number of Indigenous voices, the inclusion of modern and contemporary artistic works to evoke eras, and the reproduction of vitrines from the 1921 exhibition, which taken together explain how Indigenous peoples and arts have been incorporated and rearticulated as part of wider intellectual and cultural configurations and subordinated to revolutionary nationalism.\n\nThe fourth and fifth periods treated in part one of the exhibition are understandably less conclusive than those that preceded them. They seemingly refer to the period between the 1960s and the final decades of the twentieth century, and set the scene for the exhibition's second half that focuses on unsettling these representations using subsequent Indigenous practices. These final two sections of the exhibition's first part aptly remind us of the hybrid nature of sixteenth-century Spanish society composed of Islamic, Judaic, and medieval Christian worldviews, values and technologies that were violently implanted in the Americas and informed what has become “Indigenous art.” Later, other outside influences were channeled, in part, through the galleons that ploughed the sea between Manila and Acapulco bringing exotic Oriental imports, which were sometimes copied or found their way into Indigenous manufactures. The forced contribution of Africa through slavery to the colony's arts and material cultures unfortunately receives scant attention, as does the slavery forced on native Americans. Instead, the curatorial narrative makes a long jump from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century to note that the end of Spanish colonialism coincided with the birth of the Industrial Revolution that converted the newly independent México into a market for European goods, forcing the Indigenous population to adopt their wares accordingly. The narrative in this section notes the common pre-Hispanic heritage underlying all Indigenous societies, but nevertheless acknowledges constant social flux and transformation and the transmission of materials, technologies, and iconographic motifs across cultural borders.\n\nNone of these perspectives are particularly new in academia, but their dissemination to a wider public is to be welcomed. That noted, the absence of documented examples or case studies leaves the vast generalizations less convincing and sometimes disappointingly glib. It is also somewhat false to invoke a common pre-Hispanic heritage, because societies ranged from cosmopolitan city states and subjugated metropoli to tropical riverine settlements and desert hunters and gatherers. What we are given in place of textual explanation is instead an assortment of exceptionally well made objects that demonstrate externally derived techniques, imported styles, and foreign iconographies all recast into superb pots baskets, stamps, painted and lacquered gourds, masks, images of saints, crosses, and musical instruments. Nevertheless, I can't help but wonder where are the objects not made for gods, markets, or homes, but which were forged in the heat of violent struggles to provide spiritual advantages (the talking crosses of the Yucatec Maya “guerilla” saints and protective images and the communicating apparatuses of prophets and seers), regalia, weapons, cartoons, counter hegemonic monuments, laser prints, photographs, and films?\n\nThe importance of indigenous agency, although on display throughout the exhibition, especially embodied in the contemporary artworks, is largely missing from the narrative. Market-oriented descriptions often surreptitiously insinuate a deterministic narrative, which I assume the exhibitionary approach would want to supersede? Perhaps, if the category of “Indigenous art” had been widened to include more overtly political works that express trauma, struggle, and loss, the vitality and agency behind a rather different genre of Indigenous art might not so easily have been lost or forgotten. An exception to this is Noé Martínez's two large drawings paired with poems in Spanish and Nahuatl, which are part of a series of 26 drawings and collages, Las razones de mi nombre (2021). Inspired by deep contemplation of the transformation of the Indian body and the way it has been trafficked for more than half a millennium (enslaved, exchanged for domestic animals, raped, and mutilated), the work further raises questions about the construction of history, the classification and naming of ethnicities, and the unacknowledged role of Indigenous slavery in building New Spain.\n\nBehind what I take to be a second unintended effect of this revisionist curatorial narrative is a further equally serious ellipsis. I was unable to find any mention in this exhibition of the internal struggles within the new nation for Indigenous self-determination or their mobilization against imperial aggression. Neither, despite the concept having its origin in Rodolfo Stavenhagen's mid-1960s work, are the effects of internal colonization and the dependent relation between the Mexican state and Indigenous communities ever mentioned. While Teofila Palafox commends the exhibition on the Museum's official Facebook account and her work appears in the gallery, there is no mention of the current land problems and assassination of compatriots currently taking place in her natal community of San Mateo del Mar. This is disappointing, because having presented a critical history of the period 1876–1970s, the curatorial narrative seems to stutter, apart from a later reference to the influence of the Zapatistas, and lose much of its self-reflexivity and criticality when confronted with the last half-century and the continuing abuse of the rights of Indigenous peoples, even though in 2007 Mexico adopted the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP). It is revealing that no mention of UNDRIP is made anywhere in the exhibition.\n\nBefore leaving the five historical sections contained in the exhibition's first part covered in galleries 1 and 2, exhibition text reaffirms the aesthetic independence of local artist-based practices and the important role of historical singularity and linguistic influences. Many languages, the exhibition texts reveal, have terms for similar aesthetic concepts as those in the European Greco-Roman lexicon, but they emanate from different lived experiences, different practices and alternative collective exchanges across cultural boundaries and between other knowledge holders and institutions. Beauty, the curators insist, resides in each case in a complex of interrelated factors and histories that are not easily accommodated in Western art history and have neither been synthesized or systematized by their own practitioners.\n\nThe second part of the exhibition opens with Arte para la vida. In this section the view is conveyed that art is made for life and not contemplation. This seems contradictory when compared to the ensuing statement that tells us Indigenous art is meant to be felt through all the senses, which instead suggests it provides one of the most intensively contemplative experiences possible. It is nature, not culture, it is argued, that is constantly active and is related to humans through principles of reciprocity. Objects have personalities and sacred essences but, as always, they may still be adapted to external markets and tastes. The next section presents the film by O'de pict artists Saúl Kak and PH Joel, Solos con Náwayomo (2021), described in label text as a “cinematic ritual” related to the torrential rainfall and the political effects of Hurricane Eta on parts of Chiapas in 2020. Other powerful works include the three deities in their wooden case (previously mentioned); a petrified Wixarika (Huichol) ancestor and an image of Tatewarí, their creator and fire deity; incense burners and candlesticks; and Náayari (Cora), Yokot'an (Chontal), and Nahua masks, including a COVID embroidered mask.\n\nThe final gallery, Resistencia y Resonancias is in some ways the most disappointing. It begins with the promising affirmation that the arts have provided mediums for the expression of resistance, negotiation, and liberation. They have themselves been spaces of Indigenous struggle over how they are named, preserved, and used, and by whom. This is inscribed as a colonial struggle, again eluding the political and economic conditions of the Independence period, and especially the past 50 years with the Salinas and subsequent presidencies, when México embraced neoliberalism. All we are told is that, currently, the situation between neocolonial practices, corporations, and governments and the Indigenous struggle for collective rights and self-determination is “tense”—a massive understatement given the unending threats against Indigenous lives, properties, and rights over their own cultures. The narrative goes on to acknowledge that within the wider struggles for rights over land, language, and justice, precipitated by the Zapatista uprising (EZLN), Indigenous artists have appropriated hegemonic art practices that they have used for experimentation and innovation, which have enabled them to insert themselves into the Western art market. We are told they use disruptions and contradictions between and within Indigenous cultures and the wider world to confront the global art system, but in ways we are left to guess—in Carmen Vázquez Hernández's unfinished woven rebozo or Octavio Aguilar's wonderful, finely textured white “huipil de la reina” (the Queen's blouse). Other artists and practices are burdened with still heavier obligations, required to confront racism, discrimination, and exoticization, reject knowledge extraction and aesthetic appropriation, and provide alternative intellectual categories to Western binary and hierarchical classifications. Here we are presented with Elvira Palafox's powerful film exerpt, Teak Monterok, The Story of the God of Lightning, Hilán Cruz's digital images, and Baldomero Robles’ La casa del viento (the House of the Wind), but it is not always clear how all these works fulfill the weighty obligations assigned to them.\n\nWithout doubt, this is a broad and ambitious exhibition that, despite my more critical comments, should encourage the curation of new genres of Indigenous and multiculturally curated exhibitions and the development and growth of Indigenous art history in México. Without it, the questions others and myself have raised in relation to Indigenous arts might not have been articulated in the same way; ideas for some future exhibitions might never be stimulated nor promoted outside the acute problematics raised by Arte de los Pueblos de México, Interupciones Indígenas. Without doubt, the exhibition marks a turning point, but having failed to breach the division between art production and reception and politics, it falls short of presenting a wholly new paradigm, as it so yearned to achieve. In many ways, the exhibition should have begun with its final section, Resistencia y Resonancias, and then worked systematically to illustrate, using concrete examples, each of the important statements contained in this part of its narrative.\n\nI am reminded of Laura Osorio Sunnucks’ 2018 exhibition, Arts of Resistance: Politics and the Past in Latin America (UBC Museum of Anthropology, Vancouver), whose curatorial project began by asking: what is popular art today, and what is its purpose and significance after globalization and President Salinas de Gortari's neoliberal reforms (1988–1994) that dislodged revolutionary nationalist ideology as the core of the nation's foundation myth and collective identity? Mexico's membership of NAFTA in 1994, the constitutional reform of article 27, in 1991–92 (which deregulated the protection of communal lands), and the almost three decades of neoliberal government, having broken with the previous nationalist regimes, has not only made the established cultural policies based on the singularity of the Mexican Revolution redundant, but also discarded the sentimental art history that had long supported it. Osorio began her analysis in Mexico and then extended it to Latin America. She incorporated the Oaxaca mural-artist collective Lapiztola, whose large-scale, stenciled installation with Indigenous women bearing guns protested the introduction of genetically modified maize; an amatl painter who focused on the preparations for an election, with lorries loaded with beer, drinking and dancing while the politician sits in the municipal hall collecting ballot papers; the so-called Codex Ayotzinapa, belonging to the families and friends demanding justice for their 43 disappeared children and friends; and two groups of Teloloapan and Tocuaro devil masquerades, each displayed on pink dissecting tables, to open discussion on attitudes to exploitative foreigners in Latin America. What, I wonder, would Arte de los Pueblos de México have looked like if it had been curated at a more critical cultural institution like the Museo Universitario del Chopo, or for that matter at the Centro Cultural Tijuana (CECUT) on the Mexican/US frontier, or even the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, renowned for its interdisciplinary critiques of institutional and political cultures, or better still if variants of the Palacio's exhibition, employing different curatorial teams, had opened in all three venues simultaneously?\n\nCuriosity notwithstanding, I find this to be an astounding and important exhibition that clamors for a change in museum and gallery approaches, as well as for much more in-depth studies of distinct types of Indigenous arts in the context of their specific aesthetic systems and political histories. This is an exhibition that needed to be curated and has, as a result, made the discipline of museology more lucid and public awareness of Indigenous art more astute.\n\nAnthony Alan Shelton\n\nUniversity of British Columbia"
