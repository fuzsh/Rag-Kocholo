        "text": "Hey there writers!\n\nI'm opening up to queries again! I've been closed for a bit while juggling my own writing, a major move back to the East Coast, a toddler, and you know, life. And I'm just so excited to read new work again!\n\nNew here? Have a look at my sales and list. That'll also give you an idea what kind of books I work on.\n\nHere's what I'm looking for in 2019.\n\n-#-\n\nGenre Blending Literary & Commercial Fiction\n\nIf you love novels like Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel, The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern, Alif the Unseen by G. Willow Wilson, The Last One by Alexandra Olivia, The Time Traveler’s Wife by Audrey Niffeneggerand, The Last Policeman by Ben H. Winters, The Monsters of Templeton by Lauren Groff, and every book by Colson Whitehead... then your work is a good fit for me.\n\nI'm looking for genre-blending fiction... books that pull a bit of genre into the literary.\n\nWhen it comes to my clients, Mike Chen's Here & Now & Then, Erica Boyce's The Fifteen Wonders of Daniel Green, and Alison Stine's The Grower, are the perfect example of this. Literary fiction with splashes of time travel, secret societies, and the apocalypse? Yes. Please.\n\nI also really love literary fiction that takes you into small worlds and communities where I'm an outsider. A glimpse inside a complex family, or a workplace. One of my favorite novels of 2018 was Number One Chinese Restaurant by Lillian Li. I'd love to find a book like that.\n\nAs for weirdly specific things I'm looking for... I'm dying to find a great book about a cult or a survivalist or a plague... maybe all of them in one?\n\nI'm hoping this will be a big focus for me this year and pushing forward, so please, query away!\n\n-#-\n\nYoung Adult\n\nHey, it's that category I also write in! I'm always hungry to find bright new voices in YA.\n\nAs for what I'm specifically looking for, that's a hard thing to pin down. I read widely in YA, and enjoy just about every genre in it. I love moving contemporary reads, thrilling sci-fi, and lush fantasy.\n\nTo get a sense of my taste in YA, my favorite novels of last year were Dread Nation by Justina Ireland, A Conspiracy of Stars by Olivia A. Cole, The Beauty That Remains by Ashley Woodfolk, Hullmetal Girls by Emily Skrutski, Heart of Iron by Ashley Poston, The Summer of Jordi Perez by Amy Spalding, and Contagion by Erin Bowman.\n\nMy favorite YA novel of all time is Hero by Perry Moore.\n\nWhen it comes to my favorite YA authors, I've read every book by writers like Becky Albertalli, Adam Silvera, Nova Ren Suma, Mindy McGinnis, Zoraida Cordova, Meg Medina, Jeff Zentner, Brandy Colbert, Bryan Bliss, and Nina LaCour.\n\nVery hungry to work on more LGBTQ+ YA novels and diverse, inclusive reads. I'd also love to see more YA non-fiction hit my inbox.\n\n-#-\n\nSelect Science Fiction & Fantasy\n\nI'm a bit picky when it comes to sci-fi and fantasy novels. I love them. I read a ton of them. But they have to be accessible.\n\nWhat does that mean? It means that readers who don't traditionally pick up much sci-fi or fantasy, can pick up one of these novels, and enjoy it.\n\nSome of my favorite recent sci-fi and fantasy reads include The City of Brass by S.A. Chakraborty, Blackfish City by Sam J. Miller, The Book of M by Peng Shepherd, Kill the Farm Boy by Delilah S. Dawson and Kevin Hearne, and the Sleeping Giants series by Sylvain Neuvel. I also love anything Chuck Wendig, Kat Howard, and Delilah S. Dawson writes.\n\n-#-\n\nMemoir and Essay Collections\n\nI love powerful personal stories, especially from essayists. I'm lucky enough to work with Bassey Ikpi, whose novel I'm Telling the Truth But I'm Lying is out this year. Some of my favorite essayists include Nicole Chung and Michele Filgate, whose books are absolutely filed in \"books I wish I could have worked on.\"\n\nAll You Can Ever Know by Nicole Chung was my favorite memoir of 2018, and one of my favorite books of the year, period.\n\n-#-\n\nCookbooks\n\nI love quirky cookbooks that explore topics that are hard to find in the bookstore, or haven't been explored at all. Odd, single subject books tend to grab me really quickly. If you think your project is too niche, I might be right for you.\n\nRecent projects of mine in this category include Eat to Feed by Eliza Larson and Kristy Kohler, a cookbook that dishes recipes that help mothers with breastmilk production,Are You Afraid of the Dark Rum? by Sam Slaughter, a cocktail book full of 90's inspired drinks, and Lindsey Smith's Eat Your Feelings, a mental health focus cookbook about pairing food with emotions.\n\nWildly different, right? But each are wildly unique and very specific.\n\nCookbook authors should be platformed... which doesn't necessarily mean a big ol' Twitter following. If you're writing articles for food-related places, doing speaking engagements, or run your own blog... that counts!\n\n-#-\n\nNon-Fiction History & Pop Culture\n\nI love love LOVE books that introduce readers to untold stories. My author Alex Rubens' 8-Bit Apocalypse is the perfect example, telling the untold story of the creation of the game Missile Command.\n\nI've loved every single book written by Mary Roach, and would love to find a non-fiction book along those lines. One of my favorite non-fiction titles ever is The Secret Life of Lobsters by Trevor Corson.\n\n-#-\n\nAnd now, a quick rundown of what I'm not looking for, to save everyone's time.\n\nWhat I'm Not Looking For:\n\nMiddle Grade or Picture Books (pitch my colleague Maria!)\n\nAngel & demon love stories, Heaven / Hell stories.\n\nAdult epic fantasy or military sci-fi.\n\nBooks significantly over 100,000 words.\n\nDouglas-Adams-esque sci-fi.\n\nNon-fiction about sports or politics.\n\nYour bad thriller about a white guy fighting terrorists.\n\nPortals.\n\nNovellas.\n\nMain-character-is-a-bigot-and-learns-a-lesson. Hard pass.\n\nRedemptive story arcs for abusers. Nope.\n\nNew Adult books.\n\nHorror novels. I like them, but I don't know what makes a good one.\n\nAnything comped as \"Lovecraftian\" (he was racist, not interested)\n\nAnything comped to Orson Scott Card (if I have to explain this, we can't work together)\n\nCommercial fiction about sports (exceptions made for sports YA, I love sports YA!)\n\nUpdated: April 2024\n\nA while back, the iconic fantasy author Kat Howard worked on Mike Chen's novel Here & Now & Then. Her guidance helped get the book where it needed to be, and it’s since netted acclaimed reviews. His next books, A Beginning at the End and We Could Be Heroes are in stores everywhere, with more novels to follow.\n\nA good eye, can get you on track.\n\nBut wait. Why have someone else looking over the manuscripts by the authors I've been signing?\n\nWell, here's the thing, writerly types. I can still miss things that need work. Generally when I'm picking up an author, I'll have read through their manuscript pretty quickly (if I'm in love with a manuscript, I read it like I read any book... by devouring it), and when it comes time for edits, I'll read it again, slowly, making notes. Then usually another time. And then again.\n\nBy the time we're ready for sub, I've likely read the book four, maybe five times. At that point, I'm probably missing stuff. If I didn't catch it by the fourth or fifth read through, I'm not going to. And if that book isn't quite landing with editors I'm subbing it to, another set of eyes becomes so key. This goes for my work process as an agent and as a writer, as well as any author working on a query letter or a rough manuscript. A new set of eyes will catch things you might have missed, and pick up on issues that are closer to them.\n\nTL; DR: More eyes, means a better letter or a better book.\n\nI thought it might be a good idea to roundup other authors and editors that offer up freelance editorial work. Because who better to help you work on that query / manuscript, then someone who has been there before? Authors and editors know what solid queries and manuscripts should look like, having read and written so many.\n\nSo... here we go!\n\nKat Howard (@KatWithSword): Kat's an author with Saga and a published short story writer with over 30 shorts out there in the world.

[Website]\n\nHave someone you'd like to add to the list? Are YOU that someone? Email me! ericsmithrocks at gmail dot com!\n\nI love taking in-person pitches at publishing conferences.\n\nIt's how I found Lindsey Smith (her award-winning cookbook, Eat Your Feelings, came out with St. Martin's Press in 2017!), and I've had the wonderful opportunity to talk with numerous writers around the country. About their books, about their platforms, all kinds of good stuff, sharing advice as well as dishing out suggestions for their projects.\n\nBut without fail, at every conference I attend, there are certain questions I ask that seem to trip writers up. And sometimes, not having answers to those questions sends up serious red flags.\n\nSo I thought I'd do a little post, to dish out some tips for those of you pitching agents and editors in-person. Because while you may have polished that pitch to perfection, you're going to need to answer these kind of questions.\n\nLeave Room To Talk\n\nFirst, before we dig into any of these bits… leave room to talk. It can be tempting to spend the entire ten or fifteen minutes explaining why your book is amazing, but… what if the agent has questions? What if you forget to mention word count or talk about your platform? What if the discussion ends before you finish even explaining your book?\n\nYou might miss out on answering the questions the agent needs to really get hooked. Don’t spend the whole time talking. Leave room for a conversation.\n\nWhat's Your Book About?\n\nRight away, at every conference I go to, when I sit down with an author, this is what I open up with. Tell me about your book. What have you written? What's it about? Give me the details.\n\nThis should be the quickest and easiest question to answer, but sometimes it trips people up.\n\nEvery writer comes prepared to talk about their book at these things. It's why you are there, for the most part. But not every writer is able to talk about their book in a quick, succinct way. Remember, you've only got like ten, maybe fifteen minutes here to sum up your entire story.\n\nDon't use this time to explain the entire intricate plot of the book. This isn't a book report. Treat it as though you're reading the back-jacket copy of a book to a friend in your local bookstore. You're shopping and you're trying to sell them on this book. That's what you would show them.\n\nYou can read the jacket copy of a book in a minute or two. You want to have plenty of time for the agent to ask YOU questions and for you to ask your own. Don't spend it explaining every little thing. Save room.\n\nHow Many Words?\n\nKnow the word count of your book. Agents and editors are going to ask this.\n\nAnd that being said, before you even get ready to pitch, know what the typical word count is for your respective genre. If you show up boasting an enormous, unheard of word count for a book, it might tell the agent / editor that you're not familiar with the genre.\n\nWriter's Digest has a great post about typical book lengths here. There are exceptions to every rule, of course. Just be savvy.\n\nWhat Have You Read in the Genre Recently?\n\nSpeaking of genre... I get pitched a lot of YA, sci-fi, and fantasy at conferences, which is fantastic, because that is what I'm there looking for. But nothing makes me hit the brakes faster than when I ask what a writer has read recently in their respective genre, and they don't have an answer.\n\nOr even worse, when they say they don't really read in their genre.\n\nIf you tell me that you don't actively read, that throws up a red flag. When potential YA authors tell me the last great YA novel they read was The Chronicles of Narnia (this happens a lot, this isn't a silly joke example) or that they don't really read YA at all, I immediately lose interest.\n\nI want to work with writers who actively read where they want to write.\n\nBe ready with an answer. And if you don't have an answer because you aren't actively reading the kind of books you want to write... maybe rethink what you're writing? The best way to be a good writer, is to read. If you aren't reading, you probably aren't writing anything worth reading.\n\nWhat's Your Platform?\n\nThis is the kind of question you're going to get asked if you're writing non-fiction.\n\nAs I've rambled about on here before, platform doesn't really matter when it comes to fiction. It helps, sure. But, your story is what's important here. But with non-fiction, editors and agents want to work with experts. Writing memoir? They want to work with authors who can prove people want to hear their story. Writing a collection of essays? We're going to want to see where you've been published before.\n\nAnd when it comes to that non-fiction book you're working on, be it about a major historical figure or how to be a good parent, you need to show your expertise. Where have you been blogging? Where have you been speaking?\n\nRemember, platform isn't just your social media presence. It's your regular speaking engagements, the places you've written. Make sure you're established there, and have something to discuss.\n\nWhat's Your Life Outside of Writing Like\n\nGasp! A question that doesn't have to do with your book? That's right.\n\nHere's the thing about agents and writers, friends. It becomes a very personal relationship. For some. At least, for me it does. These become the people you talk to every day. Me and my authors, we talk in Google Chat constantly. We text. We gossip about non-book things frequently. The relationships often become friendly.\n\nSo be ready for an agent to want to get to know you a little better. Don't shrug and say \"oh, nothing really interesting\" when chances are, you do have something interesting. Share bits about yourself. Your hobbies. What you do for a living. What you're studying. Things like that. Making a personal connection is important here.\n\n---\n\nAnd those are the usual things I bring up. So! Come ready with answers. Because we are going to have questions.\n\nAt this point, most of the Bookternet seems to know. But in case you didn't hear, after five years at the fabulous Quirk Books, I'm packing up my little toy-decorated office this week.\n\nSeveral New York Times bestsellers, books that won numerous awards, a dozen (mostly) viral book trailers, several bookish websites, plenty of social network profile launches, the publication of my own book, tons of conventions, and thousands upon thousands of books mailed to bloggers... it's been a really wonderful and fulfilling experience, working with all the awesome people at Quirk.\n\nBut, it's time for a new chapter, as they say. A new challenge.\n\nThis month, I'm jumping into a new career as a literary agent with P.S. Literary.\n\nAs anyone who has ever met me will tell you, I'm happiest when talking about other people. Asking me about a favorite book or a favorite author usually ends with me doing something like this.\n\nI mean, when I was emailing friends and media about my latest book, I linked out to another person's book in my PS (again, ya'll should add More Happy Than Not to your Goodreads). Some of the best blog posts I've ever written on BookRiot and The Huffington Post have to do with me talking about other people. Hell, I started a blog and an awards show to give others a platform.\n\nUsing my voice to help others get their stories out there... it makes me happy.\n\nSo exploring a career where I get to discover new writers, boast about how amazing their undiscovered works are, help launch their careers, and be their voice? Ah, what a perfect, perfect opportunity. Thanks for giving me a shot, Curtis and David!\n\nAnd while P.S. Literary is located in Toronto, I will be staying in Philadelphia, working out of my new home office / coffeeshops all over. I may even crash Indy Hall once and a while, when Adam and Alex aren't busy making websites.\n\nSo before I list the kind of books I'm looking for, here's a big ol' public thank you to Quirk Books, for an awesome five years.\n\nIf it wasn't for Quirk taking a chance on some local blogger with zero publishing experience, I wouldn't have had... well, any of this. Two published books (one of which was published with Quirk, thank you Jason!), dozens of lectures and talks at conferences, and now this, a new career to explore. For that, I'm not quite sure how to express my thanks. It's just so huge.\n\nBut I think about that fact often, how I got from Point A to Point B(ook). Thanks for giving me a shot after my awkward, nervous interview, Brett, and giving me the chance to grow over the years. I won't ever forget it.\n\nAh, and the Quirk authors and the many, many book bloggers. I've come to know so many of you outside the walls of our publishing house, and I'm happy to call many of you my friends. Thank you for your awesome words, whether it was a book you wrote or a book you reviewed.\n\nQuirks, it has been an absolute pleasure. I'll see you at all the conventions. And you'll certainly see me in the area. Blair and I have new comic book day every Wednesday, and I don't plan on breaking that tradition.\n\nI also have to thank my awesome future-wife Nena. Without her support to move forward with this, it wouldn't be happening.\n\nAnd as for the books, here's what I'm looking for. You can scope me out on the agency website here. I'll update this site soon with all of this. But for now, here you go.\n\nNote: To my friends that I've listed here as comps... well, I'm not sorry. I admire each of you so very much, and I want more writing like yours in the world.\n\nYoung & New Adult: I'm eager to find bright, diverse new voices in YA. Send me your sci-fi, your fantasy, your contemporary, your pretty-much-any-genre in YA. I write and read YA frequently, so this is a genre I'm fiercely passionate about. If you're curious about my tastes, I adore authors like Susan Dennard, Lauren Morrill, E.C. Myers, Rainbow Rowell, Chuck Wendig, Andrew Smith, Marie Lu, Tahereh Mafi, and new kids on the YA block like Aisha Saeed, Sabaa Tahir, Brandy Colbert, and Adam Silvera.\n\nTo quote Andrew Smith, \"keep YA weird.\" Give me your weird, give me your quirky!\n\nWith NA, send me your awkward romances and your bold new ideas. It's a growing genre, I'd love to find something that surprises me and makes me swoon. Steamy kissing scenes are awesome... but I'd love to see some NA jump into new genres. Are those kissing scenes in... oh, I don't know, SPACE? Would it make Kirk and Uhura blush? Awesome. Send it to me.\n\nScience Fiction & Fantasy: Looking for high fantasy and exciting sci-fi, new worlds that simply can't be put down. I would love books in the vein of titles by authors like Brandon Sanderson, Lev Grossman, Cory Doctorow, John Scazli, Jeff Vandermeer, Cherie Priest, or Andy Weir.\n\nCookbooks: I'm particularly interested in cookbook ideas from bloggers. Do you have an awesome food blog with a growing audience? Can you take amazing photos? Are you an active part of the food blogger community? Let's talk. I'm very open to helping develop ideas here, even if the book isn't quite there yet.\n\nNon-Fiction: When it comes to non-fiction, I'm interested in books that focus on pop culture, geekery, and/or teach readers about the odd and the unique. If you've ever picked up a book by Mary Roach, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Non-fiction that explains big ideas and large concepts in ways that are accessible, fun, and humorous.\n\nI'm also interested in essay collections, particularly humor though I'm open to anything that's really compelling. Think Davy Rothbart, David Sedaris, or Anna Goldfarb. Give me your awkward confessions. Make me laugh.\n\nBlog to Book Ideas: I would love to work with bloggers kicking around ideas for developing their blog into a book. Think your massively popular Tumblr deserves a fun hardcover gift book? Let's discuss.\n\nLiterary Fiction: Very open to and excited to read some adult literary fiction, especially anything contemporary with a rom-com twist (think Nick Hornby) or mystery / thrillers that touch on current affairs (think Jon McGoran).\n\nI'm also very interested in literary fiction that does a bit of genre mashing. Think Station Eleven, The Last Policeman (one of my favorite books ever), or The Night Circus.\n\nAnd there we have it. The adventure starts. Send me your books. Have a pitch? Email me. And I'll see you all at BEA. This time around though, it'll say \"agent\" on my tag.\n\nAgent... Smith?\n\nOh dear."
