        "text": "Writing as a Debt of Honor – with Ann Lamott\n\nPeople usually come to writing conferences because they love to write, or want to write, or used to write, and want to again. There is something inside some of us, a select few, that longs to create written stories about life and humanity and our deepest truths. And when we do not honor that longing, something inside us begins to atrophy. When we let that desire slide by the wayside of busy lives, we do not feel fully alive.\n\nSo how do we awaken and commit to the pursuit of a writing life? How do we reinvigorate this commitment when it has been too long since we last wrote with any sustained pleasure and conviction?\n\nThis is what Anne Lamott will discuss in her keynote address, the whys and hows of writing, as a debt of honor.\n\nInspiration Ignited: How to Embrace Healing and Spark your Creativity – with SARK\n\nIn this session, you will learn to Revitalize and Re-Energize Your Dreams and Life in every way!\n\nWhat’s a story you’re telling about yourself that you would like to shift? Bring it to this magical conversation and learn how to move from the stories you typically tell about yourself and your life, to stories that empower you and ignite your creative spark!\n\nIt’s time to make magical shifts in your life so that you can Begin, Continue and Expand upon Your Unique Gifts in this world.\n\nDo you desire to embrace your healing journey so that you can:\n\nCREATE something NEW\n\nGet more MOVEment on something you’ve already started\n\nSpring your creative DREAMS into ACTION\n\nBring your favorite writing things – and you’re encouraged to add some colored pens or pencils to your bag for this one.\n\nWriting Your Book from Beginning to End – with Eric Maisel\n\nYou’ve heard it all before: you incubate an idea, the idea percolates up, you start writing, you complete a draft, you revise the draft, and, voila, a book!\n\nBut how does this process really work? Why does it take so many writers years and years to get their book written? How can the process of bringing a book into existence be handled much better than it usually is?\n\nLearn how from America’s foremost creativity coach and the author of more than fifty books, among them Fearless Creating, Coaching the Artist Within, A Writer’s Paris, and A Writer’s San Francisco. Come experience this one-of-a-kind, information-packed ninety-minute workshop.\n\nPoetic Rhythms: Creating verses that hit your high notes\n\nPoetry is one of the oldest forms of writing and many of us have forgotten the healing nature of expressing ourselves in this way. Join the Writing Doula and tap into the power of your creativity to give birth to poetry.\n\nWatch what unfolds when you learn how to seamlessly transform your thoughts and reflections into poetic expressions – and create rhythms with your words. Don’t be surprised if what you write evokes laughter or rocks your emotions. The goal of this gathering of creative kindred spirits is to let it go and let it flow.\n\nCome ready to:\n\n• Create spirit-lifting poetry\n\n• Reactivate your muse\n\n• Engage in self-reflection\n\n• Express in a safe space\n\n• Have fun!\n\nNo advanced writing skills are necessary to participate in this spirit-lifting experience. All you need to bring is your favorite writing tools and a mind that is open to trust your magic.\n\n* You will have a chance to share your words in the evening Poetry Share Gathering (no one is required to share, and you can simply attend to celebrate the sharing of others).\n\nMapping Your Writer Hero’s Journey\n\nThis session invites you to go deeper into who you are, why you are called to write, and how to tune into the cycle of the “hero’s journey” as it applies to this transformational experience.\n\nDuring this session, Jacob will lead you through practices designed to bring your true writing desires into greater clarity.\n\nYou will learn to understand the Four Characters that play a role in every one of us:\n\n• The Victim\n\n• The Villain\n\n• The Guide\n\n• The Hero\n\nWhen you understand how each of these archetypes interact, you can empower yourself to grow into your potential as a writer and overcome hindrances that have held you back in the past.\n\nYour creative inner soul self wants to communicate – giving you clues, fuel, courage, and surprising direction for the path ahead.\n\nBring your notebook and writing tools.\n\nHealing from Procrastination and Perfectionism: How Trauma Blocks Writers\n\nDo you suffer from procrastination that feels insurmountable? Perfectionism that feels utterly crippling? Most writers struggle with these two demons periodically, but for some writers it’s more than just a temporary problem. For writers who have suffered from procrastination and perfectionism for years, even decades, these two obstacles are more than just an ordinary bump in the road on the creative journey—they are deeply-rooted coping mechanisms that the writer adopted in childhood and adolescence to protect themselves from a dysfunctional home environment and/or toxic relationship with their primary caregiver.\n\nIn Healing from Procrastination and Perfectionism Lauren Sapala will share strategies she’s discovered that actually work for these kinds of writers. With over ten years of experience coaching writers who thought they could never move forward with writing, Lauren has developed techniques that not only conquer what she calls “toxic procrastination and severe perfectionism” but can also help any writer find their writing voice, rediscover the joy in writing, and finish their creative projects.\n\nThis 90-minute workshop requires only you and your favorite writing tools.\n\nDon’t Write Your Book – with Sam Lamott\n\nMany people struggle for years with the traditional approaches to giving birth to the book that lives inside them. They start and find themselves stymied over and over again.\n\nIn the true spirit of creativity, Sam Lamott has developed a different approach. During this interactive workshop, he will draw on his years as a top podcaster and storyteller to show you how a process of recorded interviews could be the way to help you unearth those stories, characters, and lessons that you long to bring into life on the page.\n\nRather than staring at the blank page and wondering why the words won’t come out, learn how to use techniques that professional interviewers and ghostwriters employ to produce captivating works of fiction and nonfiction.\n\nDuring this session, you will be invited into curiosity, humor, and imagination that can become the keys to unlock your best work."
