        "text": "I spent five days, weekend before last, in Santa Fe and Taos, New Mexico. I met, talked with, and heard from other writers, both unknown and famous. Anne Lamott was a headliner, as well as Julia Cameron and several writers I didn’t know much about. Sam Lamott and Jacob Nordby organized and ran this conference, billed as a Transformational Writing Retreat. And it was all of that and more.\n\nMy sister graciously came to Memphis to be here with my mom, who had just gotten out of the hospital with some health issues that were, thankfully, mostly resolved. She’s doing better now, but I was prepared to cancel the trip at the last minute and possibly attend the retreat online, or at least part of it. I got there a day early because of airline schedules, and I finally got to visit the Georgia O’Keefe Museum and walk around town, which helped make me ready for this experience.\n\nIf you haven’t been to Santa Fe and Taos, you should go. The towns are beautiful and historic, with art galleries and food and local jewelry and crafts you can buy. But even better, mountains surround the towns, and the skies are vast, expanding, 360-degree vistas that couldn’t be adequately photographed, at least not by me. Beautiful, blue, and endless. Some say the area is a “thin place,” and to me it was.\n\nWhat happens at a transformational writing retreat? First of all, you write and write and write. The speakers give you prompts or tell you to make lists or draw circles where you analyze your own thoughts and feelings and your entire life; a topic might be how you manage your days or why someone is your hero. Then you share what you just wrote with a complete stranger or maybe with a group, or even with the whole conference of 600+ people. You might also describe a new acquaintance without mentioning their physical appearance or get up in the morning for a full hour of yoga. You become much better acquainted with your brain and your heart, the sources of all your writing.\n\nI attended a pre-conference workshop with Julia Cameron on Friday, and here are a few things I learned there: other writers are friendly and encouraging; we can name our inner critics and reduce their power over us; we can ask ourselves for advice and receive valuable guidance. The suggestions from her book, The Artist’s Way (which I read many years ago and now plan to work through again), can expand us and bring out our creativity. You must do some handwriting first thing in the morning, go on a 20-minute solo walk twice a week, take yourself on a weekly “artist’s date” to see something new, and ask for daily guidance. Julia was funny and direct and instructive. She used some of the ideas from her book, The Right to Write, which I happened to have at the conference. She taught us a song she had written and told us how she had discovered that she could write songs.\n\nShe divided us into breakout groups of three (which had to be different each time), and we would share what we had just written or drawn or listed. Ideas flowed from my head and heart into my hand, and I met people who were willing to share about their lives and losses and careers. I tried to write down all of their first names. I told them about losing my husband four years ago and retiring from my job, and others talked about trying to find a way to work full-time and still write or let go of a job and retire. Time was limited, so we only shared tidbits.\n\nThe final group answered questions about what we needed to accept, celebrate, and be proud of. One woman said she was proud that her marriage and kids had all succeeded, which made her feel validated because she had stayed home with them, and that is something to be proud of. I had planned for my life to be like that, but it didn’t happen. My answer was that life is short, I need to celebrate love for everyone, including myself, and that I’m proud that I’m still here breathing, after losing my husband four years ago and then my adult son just four months ago. That took the others’ breath away, or at least took their words away for a second, but then they said, “you’ve been talking about being joyful!” and I said yes, you have to find joy in life every day and you can survive. I didn’t burst into tears, but one tear spilled out and I smiled a little, and we went back to our original seats. I felt that I had left them in a state of bewilderment, but it was all okay.\n\nThis was rightly called an intensive workshop. I was exhausted when it was over, and then there were keynote speakers that evening. That day, I ate protein bars, snacks they provided, and a smoothie, since I didn’t really want to sit down at a restaurant for lunch or supper.\n\nSaturday and Sunday were also intense, but in a different way. After what happened at Julia’s workshop, I didn’t write or read to others about the recent losses of my husband and son. I felt that it was too soon for me, and there wouldn’t be enough time in the short breakout sessions to tell about it authentically. My intuition and my inner guide said that I can talk about it when I’m ready. The story will be long, if and when I write it, and I will be able to tell it much better.\n\nI did mention the struggles of being just one of the caregivers for my mother and told my final group that I’ve had a whole lot of stress and loss in my life recently.\n\nA few people read about their hard lives: having been abused, struggling to get sober, being trans or surviving “conversion therapy,” and people clapped for them and their courage. But you could also write about finding a four-leaf clover and they would clap for that, too. Anything and everything was accepted, and I didn’t hear a single reading that was poorly written or expressed.\n\nSome of the sessions were more like gigantic group therapy sessions than a writing conference, but when you’re a writer or an artist, thoughts and feelings are behind everything, so it made sense.\n\nLauren Sapala’s session, for example, which focused on anxiety and the fear of writing, dived into the fact that we’re often discouraged, ridiculed, or shamed for expressing ourselves as children, and that things like procrastination and perfectionism are trauma responses that come from the fear of self-expression. Dysfunctional families discourage true thoughts and feelings and push children to conform to the parents’ thoughts and feelings. Her final point was that “the writing path is the path of power,” as we learn to build or regain our confidence and freedom of expression.\n\nI enjoyed and learned from every single speaker, but my favorite speaker had to be Anne Lamott because I’ve read most of her books on how we all get through this life together. She spoke to us about a few things we should remember as writers:\n\n· We’re here on earth to pay attention and be ourselves.\n\n· Writing is a gift, something we’ve been created to do and we have a debt of honor to write.\n\n· Because we’ve gotten a Willy Wonka “golden ticket,” we must take it seriously.\n\n· Stop “not writing”!\n\n· Stop multitasking — before you start your day every day, cross two things off of your to do list.\n\n· Do it a day at a time; don’t wait for a different stage in life.\n\n· Trust someone to read and comment; join a writing group and/or get a partner.\n\n· As her husband Neal Allen says, use verbs! and fall on your butt with the first draft; let yourself fail so that you can learn.\n\n· Step across the threshold into living a writer’s life (you may need to give up a TV show or two).\n\n· Today is the start of a new season (it was really the first day of fall, so yes).\n\n· Use your vision to go deep, and explore what the universe is about.\n\nAlong with this last point, Anne talked about “Teddy,” J. D. Salinger’s story, which I love. Afterwards, I lined up for her to sign my new copy of Bird by Bird, and she asked me about my circular necklace, one circle within another, and I just said, “It’s an eternity thing.” She asked if I was writing and I said yes, and she said, “Good!” I know she has a best friend named Bonnie, so I thought she might have connected me to her friend. I have a photo of the moment, but I think I’d need permission to publish it here.\n\nOn the last day, we were all encouraged to share something we’d written in the large forum, so I finally stood up and read: it was about having made choices throughout my life to de-prioritize practicing the piano, mainly because my love of reading and writing led to a career as a teacher and librarian. I still play and sing and enjoy music, nevertheless. The final sentence was, “But I’m still a musician.” We’re all “multitudes,” as Walt Whitman said, and we have to make some choices, but we don’t have to give up the pieces of ourselves that really matter.\n\nI recommend next year’s workshops to anyone who wants to develop a stronger writing practice. You can find out more by going to the site: AWritingRoom.com, or following the group, A Writing Room Collective with Anne Lamott, on Facebook.\n\nAfter the workshop was over on Sunday, I drove to Taos and let myself breathe, look, and contemplate this transformation in my life. I drove home the next day, relaxing and feeling a release from worry and fear and anxiety. I have several new friends, a whole lot of compadres, and a few new things to do every day and every evening, instead of binge-watching too many TV series. I’m full of gratitude for my family, who all support my transformation, and for the joy of getting away."
