        "text": "Want to stand out from the crowd this summer? This week’s Chic of the Week Julia Cameron can transform your look with one of her unique jewellery accessories. Founder of Julia Cameron Ltd, a luxury British heritage brand, Julia fuses her rich artistic heritage and elements from her Great Great grandmother’s photographs whose powerful and provocative expressions of women have been rebirthed and realised in Julia’s current collection.\n\nJulia’s nature is represented by choosing our dusty pink DSQuared bag, distinctive soulful and powerfully feminine!\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nI’m a fashion designer and launched my brand of jewellery accessories under my own name last year. I produce shoots and do freelance styling as well as voiceover and compering work. www.julia-cameron.com\n\nWhat are you most proud of?\n\nStarting my brand independently from scratch and hopefully creating a distinctive and strong aesthetic in a relatively short space of time. Since then I have adorned several brides on their wedding day with my creations which I think is pretty special. Being chosen as one of Triumph lingerie’s makers collective campaign was definitely up there and I’m very proud of my artistic heritage which has really inspired me.\n\nWhat can’t you live without?\n\nStatement Jewellery, a good leather jacket and my new skullcap headphones, which are vital as I walk everywhere. A good pink lippy always does the trick and of course a headpiece or two to change up my outfit. Also can’t live without my mentors that have guided me in the last couple of years and friends who have supported me through all my crazy ideas.\n\nWhat is your most memorable fashion purchase?\n\nA rail of exquisite vintage clothes that I won in a bid at an auction house a few years ago. The clothes had belonged to a very famous aristocratic ballerina. It was a treasure trove full of incredible Escada, Missoni and Yves saint Laurent jackets. I don’t think I’ve been so excited since and I still wear all the pieces regularly.\n\nWhat is your favourite shop of all time?\n\nMG Seamans in Rugby where I’m from, it’s a very well curated vintage emporium. I have found many gems there over the years, its like going back in time, everything is beautifully laid out and I always look forward to going there when I pop back home full. It’s got a real old school glamour nostalgia about it.\n\nWhat is your biggest fashion mistake?!\n\nI think hankerchief tops with flared jeans in the 90s wasn’t such a good look for me, I’m pretty sure I was inspired by the irish pop band bewitched. Not so trendy.\n\nWho would play you in the film of your life?\n\nIn my dreams Charlize Theron as she is cool elegant, strong and independent.\n\nWhat’s your Chic Beauty/Fashion tip?\n\nDon’t be afraid to experiment with a headpiece. It can really transform your outfit, making it super glam or with a more relaxed bohemian edge. You can style it up with jeans and a t-shirt to take an outfit from dusk til dawn. Beauty wise I always carry a good highlighter for some shimmer on the cheekbones for a dewy refreshed look especially after a long day.\n\nMake a statement like Keira Knightly in one of Julia’s stunning headpieces"
