        "text": "Brianna Ahn\n\nEffect of Organophosphate Pesticide Exposure on Neuronal Viability and Susceptibility to Neurodegeneration\n\nOrganophosphates (OPs) are a widely used and readily available class of pesticides and nerve agents that inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). The toxic effect of AChE inhibition includes hyperstimulation at cholinergic synapses, damage of neurons, and predisposition to neurodegenerative disorders. Prenatal or childhood exposure to OPs have also been found to be related to abnormal brain development, cognitive deficiencies, and other functional impairments. This study seeks to understand the acute effects of organophosphate pesticides—chlorpyrifos (CPF), dichlorvos (DDVP), and diazinon (DZN)—on differentiating PC-12 cell viability and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Analysis of cell viability using the MTS assay showed that all three pesticides have a dose-dependent influence on cell survival when PC-12 cells were exposed during their entire differentiation period. CPF concentrations over 25 µM exhibited significant toxic effects (p<0.01). Whereas, significant toxicity levels for DDVP and DZN were determined at concentrations greater than 100 µM (p<0.01). Additionally, stage-specific studies indicate that PC-12 cells are most sensitive to CPF, DDVP, and DZN toxicities at late stages of differentiation during neuronal synaptogenesis. When exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of CPF, DDVP, and DZN over the entire differentiation period, effects on susceptibility to H2O2-induced oxidative damage was also observed in the PC-12 cells. These results demonstrate that OPs adversely affect PC-12 cell survival and normal differentiation. Exposure to these pesticides also increases neuronal susceptibility to oxidative damage and may predispose individuals to neurodegenerative disease.\n\nHunter Alexander\n\nVers une autre vie (Towards another life)\n\nDeath. The grand equalizer, yet it is also a part of the circle of life. Ahmadou Kouroma, one of the most influential African writers of the 20th century, discusses this concept of death and life in his work “The Suns of Independence.” This presentation will examine the cycle of life of Fama, the main character and a member of the Malinké tribe, in order to explore the relationship that the Malinké have with death and how they go about celebrating and respecting it. First, we will look at the earthly rites, performed at every Malinké funeral, and their components in order to show the pomp and ceremony that accompany them, as the ceremonies can be quite grand. This includes the so called “griots”, parties, food and animals. From there we will go into how animals are representative of the Malinké beliefs as well as how they relate to Fama so that we can highlight his fall from prince hood into the life of a beggar. Finally, we will examine the belief in reincarnation held by the Malinké, looking into the way that they see death positively, a new beginning. We will examine more closely how Fama embodies this belief to emphasize the journey that he takes. Life is a cycle. We feel both pleasure and pain, but death does not have to mean sadness, instead, it can be a joyful new beginning of life.\n\nJulie Alvarez\n\nThe Benefits of Sleep and Exercise on Percent Body Fat\n\nA variety of Americans believe that in order to live a healthy lifestyle they should get the suggested eight hours of rest and exercise at least four hours a week. However, both of these variables may not be fundamental to complete a solid muscle to fat ratio. Americans are not fully aware of what they are ingesting during their meals. During the extent of twenty years, obesity has consumed the bodies of the occupants in America (Weaver Aaron et al, 2009). To reveal why this is happening, this study will utilize the Bod Pod machine to analyze the relationship between the hours of rest and practice of the muscle to fat ratio. The participants were twenty-four females of different ages, body types, amounts of sleep per night, and hours of exercise per week. All participants fasted for an eight-hour period and wore tighter and less clothing than usual. They were also surveyed on the amounts of hours they slept per night, hours they exercised per week, and their weight. Through experimentation with the Bod Pod, we were able to conclude how the hours of sleep and exercise affected the percent fat mass and percent free fat mass. The final analysis can be utilized to prove the validity to use the Bod Pod to calculate whether or not there exists an epidemic of obesity within the United States, and possibly across the globe.\n\nJoseph Anderson and Imelda Castro\n\nThe Effects of Stress on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate in Pre- and Post-Stress Environments\n\nStress is a known factor for a physiological response such as an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. This study analyzed how blood pressure and heart rate is impacted from a pre-stress to post-stress environment. These responses are regulated by the sympathetic nervous system; the primary function of this system is to initiate the fight or flight response in an effort to maintain homeostasis. These responses can affect homeostasis by altering the heart rate, blood pressure, and the production of adrenalin. Aside from these major changes, there are smaller changes such as the release of stress hormones which regulate homeostasis during smaller, less life-threatening events when these responses are triggered. Public speaking is a common event that can create an increase of stress on the speaker which is also referred to as situational stress. Participant’s blood pressure and readings were taken in days prior to their presentation to have a baseline reading for a pre-stress environment. The participants then delivered an oral presentation where their readings were taken at the conclusion of their presentation and these readings were classified as post stress. We hypothesize that there will be an increase in both blood pressure and heart rate due to being exposed to a stressful environment. Both heart rate and systolic blood pressure increased in the raw data within the majority of those who presented with heart rate increasing on average of 73.5 bpm to 92.4 bpm and systolic blood pressure increasing on average from 128.4 mmHg to 145.6 mmHg. After conducting T-tests, our data suggests that the change in heart rate is not statistically significant however, the change in systolic blood pressure is statistically significant due to the data yielding a confidence ratio higher than 95 percent. This data suggests that the fight or flight response is activated when stress is introduced, but since public speaking does not require increased oxygen demand to the muscles, blood pressure increases due to the stress hormones of adrenaline and cortisol being released within the blood in response to this situational stress.\n\nKrissy Arechiga\n\nDivorce and Macroeconomic Instability\n\nDivorce rates in the United States have fluctuated over the past several decades and variation in divorce rates is common across states in any given time period. Variation in the economy’s macroeconomic performance has coincided with the observed variation in divorce rates; thus, the link between divorce and macroeconomic instability has been a topic that has received considerable attention. While there have been many empirical studies on the topic, the methodologies that researchers have employed and the reference periods they have examined have resulted in differing results. The analysis presented here extends the related empirical research by looking at the effects of state unemployment rates, growth in gross state domestic product and inflation rates (measured at the national level) on state divorce rates. The analysis uses panel data from five points in time (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) to analyze whether macroeconomic instability has any effect on divorce rates. A linear regression model is employed and both state- and time-fixed effects are accounted for. I conclude that there is a significant and robust negative relationship between state unemployment rates and divorce rates. National inflation rates, on the other hand, are robust and positively associated with divorce rates. Gross state domestic product is not found to be a significant determinant of divorce rates. However, the estimated relationships are statistically significant only when state and year fixed effects are controlled for. These results add to the existing literature by analyzing three macroeconomic variables and providing greater insight on the influence that these factors have on divorce rates.\n\nDavid Arellano\n\nContracts: The Effects on Major League Baseball Player Performance\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) contracts are a cause of concern for owners and organizations involved with the signing of professional baseball players. Unlike other sports leagues, such as the National Football League, MLB contracts are distinct in the fact that the salaries are guaranteed regardless of performance or amount of games played. Although performance bonuses are often included within a player’s contract and treated as an incentive to perform above expectations, they are negligible when compared to the guaranteed contractual amount. As a result, effort is questioned when players perform below expectations, and they are frequently criticized of engaging in opportunistic behavior due to the lack of incentives after signing a multi-year contractual agreement. Although this behavior is assumed to be widespread throughout Major League Baseball, it may be a common misperception due to availability bias as the most prolific players are criticized of engaging in opportunistic behavior. However, this behavior may not be representative of MLB players that do not garnish as much media attention or fan following. To thoroughly analyze opportunistic behavior, most commonly referred to as “shirking,” this study uses panel data for MLB players from the 2005-2009 seasons to determine whether professional athletes engage in opportunistic behavior with regards to the players’ contract status and performance level. This study examines player performance prior to free agency, following free agency, and for players who are under team control, which includes players who are ineligible for free agency and who are signed to a multi-year contract. Opportunistic behavior is derived by the regression of the various performance measures, which includes OPS, OPS+, WAR, and wOBA, as a function of age, age2, games, playoff appearance, and controlling for the players’ position and contract status. The results substantiate the perception of opportunistic behavior and provide insights that are useful for application within the labor market.\n\nSansanee Arunpoolsap\n\nEffects of Oregano Oil on Bacteria\n\nMany bacteria today have become resistant to antibiotics. Oregano oil contains carvacrol [2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl) phenol] and thymol (2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol), which are shown to have anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. This study aims to investigate the effects of oregano oil on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. According to previous research, these compounds disrupt bacterial cell membranes causing them to change shape and lose functionality. This experiment used two pathogenic foodborne bacteria as the gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial models, respectively: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Both types of bacteria were cultured on SOC media agar plates at 37°C. A disk diffusion method was used to determine the zone of inhibition. E. coli and S. aureus were treated with dilutions of oregano oil and changes to colony numbers were determined. The results show that the number of colonies of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria decreased after being exposed to oregano oil. The T-test was performed and the p value was calculated to be 0.002 which means that the difference was statistically significant. Gram-positive bacteria were statistically more susceptible than gram-negative bacteria (p<0.05). This suggests that oregano oil is effective in killing bacteria and can be used as a natural treatment for infection.\n\nAlex Bedolla\n\nNeural Regions of Significance in Gestural Communication of Native Deaf Signers: An fMRI Study\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the neural regions associated with gestural communication in native deaf signers who use American Sign Language (ASL). Both ASL and pantomimes engage the manual-motor system in the brain, but only the former engages the linguistic system. Utilizing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to map the relationship between ASL recognition and production, and pantomime recognition and production. Participants in our study viewed videos of actions (e.g., person using a hole puncher, whisking in a bowl) and signs/ASL representing the actions. Participants either performed a recognition task or a production task. For the recognition task, videos were presented in pairs and participants had to indicate whether or not the pairs of videos matched (i.e., videos were both ASL or gestures, or a combination of ASL and gestures). For the production task, participants either gestured the action or they produced the sign for the action. This study found that recognition and production of gestures produced activations in bilateral middle and superior temporal gyri, inferior frontal gyrus, and left inferior parietal cortex. Additionally, we found overlap of recognition and production of gestures in area Spt in the left hemisphere, a region previously implicated in sensory-motor processes in language. A comparison of recognition of gestures with recognition of ASL yielded greater activation in bilateral superior temporal and middle temporal gyri. Finally, we found greater activation in inferior frontal cortex and the insula associated with the production of gestures compared to the production of ASL. Our results suggest that manual gestures used non-linguistically recruit neural regions commonly engaged in language processes.\n\nAnders Blomso\n\nInclusion, Exclusion, and Ideological Frameworks\n\nWhere, how, and why, does inclusion occur? On whose terms? Across which borders? Inclusion, and its opposite, exclusion, are definitional exercises that occur within and often remake preexisting ideological frameworks. This panel works from the micro to the macro, examining issues related to inclusion and exclusion, first in the Hindu tantric text, the “Hymn to Kali”. By examining the place of this hymn within preexistent Hindu theological and philosophical frameworks, we will understand that tantric practices integrate many practices and seek to include or unify the individual practitioner in the salvific state or realm of the goddess Kali. Next, research on the experiences of LGBTI individuals in Cape Town, South Africa, illustrates how Christian and Muslim groups have negotiated inclusion and exclusion in their social life, and to what end. This paper contests the notion that religious and queer identities are insoluble by asserting that recent years have seen an uptick in inclusive practices by churches and mosques. A third paper explores how political leaders are affected by ideological frameworks in their decision to try to include in their political agendas different regions in global politics. This final paper asserts that President Richard Nixon’s posture towards South East Asia was heavily influenced by the ideological framework established during the Cold War, by examining primary documents that detail his trips to Thailand, Burma (Myanmar), and Indochina (Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam), with special attention to his ideas about Communism. Overall, this panel looks at different methodological (textual, ethnographic, political) and theoretical approaches to ideas and practices of inclusion and exclusion across disparate ideological frameworks.\n\nMarcell Blow\n\nCommunity-Law Enforcement Cohesion\n\nThe aspect of community policing implementation is a key theory to a way to reduce crime as well as improve the community-law enforcement cohesion. Tensions between law enforcement officers and the communities they police have increased in the recent years. We need policies and programs that bring police and communities together to reduce this tension and fight crime. With my research question being, which crimes do the methods of community policing have the most effect in the fight against crime and building stronger relationships between law enforcement and the society? This study was administered on a police department residing in a suburban city in southern California. Qualitative data consisted of interviews and observations. Statistical data of the criminal offenses in the community was the quantitative analysis. The accumulation of data was used to find correlations to officer opinions of most prominent offenses in their community they police, the amount of action they spend interacting with the communtiy through programs and if there are programs in place to combat the rise of certain criminal offenses. Research suggests that successful programs change the perceptions that police have of youth, from seeing them as targets to appreciating them as community assets. Also, increasing communication and transparency between police and community members enhances cooperation and trust. Most research focuses on community responses to law enforcement. My research examines how police officers perceive the communities they patrol and which programs or policies they believe would work best to reduce crime and increase police-community cohesion. In agreement with the literature the findings reveal that this department is understaffed, as well as there is a lack of community programs through the department as a result of budget cuts. In addition to the officers feeling the community has a lack of education to what goes into the officers’ daily duties. The findings of this study are influential because now we can make strong correlations based off of statistical data compared with what the officers are experiencing. It is apparent that law enforcement needs to invest in educating the community as well as provide proactive programs for the youth of the community.\n\nAmanda Cabanilla\n\nForm, Function, and Structure: Online Dating While Fat\n\nFat acceptance movements within the US have become more visible in recent years, coinciding with increasing use of the Internet, which has become a crucial mediator of our social and romantic lives. The Internet has provided a new platform for the formation of romantic relationships, with as many as 23% of Americans aged 25-34 entering into marriages and long-term relationships through online dating (Pew Research Center). How do online dating sites both commodify and fetishize fat women’s bodies while simultaneously creating a space for their liberation and recognition as legitimate objects of desire? To what extent can online users achieve social and sexual liberation within the parameters made available to them on niche dating websites? Similar to ongoing debates about pornography, feminists question whether fat women can challenge normative beauty ideals by intentionally sexualizing their bodies within a society plagued by unequal gender power dynamics and the sexual exploitation of women. Anonymous profiles were created for two mainstream and two niche dating websites/applications and 15 male and 15 female profiles that met predetermined criteria were sampled from each dating platform. An analysis of the form/structures of niche online dating websites for individuals seeking “big beautiful women” suggests the replication of social biases against fat women embedded within the websites in the form of questions indicative of the popular depictions of fat women as undesirable. Furthermore, mobile dating applications also impose additional structural limitations on the formation of users’ online identities not found in web-based dating sites. A content analysis of the free-form response sections within user profiles suggests site users are failing to challenge the structural impositions placed upon them, instead seeming to conform without significant resistance. Niche dating websites perpetuate fat stereotypes through the overt sexual fetishization of female subscribers, suggesting deliberate efforts to maintain popular images of the paradoxically hyper-sexualized undesirable fat woman waiting to fulfill male fantasies. Authentic self-expression online is significantly curtailed by the rigidity of digitized hegemonic gender norms and power relations.\n\nValeria Cabral\n\nThe Battle Between being a Soldier or being a Woman\n\nBefore the 1940s when women were attending schools for the first time and being involved in sports, society questioned their competence and demonstrated concerns regarding how these involvements would affect their reproductive system and take away from their female duties. Similarly enough, when women began enlisting in the military in the 1940s their intention to join the military was questioned. When joining the military, women were believed to join with the intention to look for a husband, find multiple sex partners, or simply try to be male. However how often do we see men being questioned on their reasons to join the military? Men are often getting praised and celebrated for wanting to join because they will be defending their country and the values of justice, equality, and freedom. Interestingly enough, women who wish to do the same are denied the freedom to do so and the equal treatment they deserve for also being soldiers fighting for our nation. Melissa Herbert, Assistant professor of Sociology at Hamline University in Minnesota, wrote the book titled, Camouflage Isn't Only for Combat in which she explains how women who enter male-dominated areas are often confronted by societal expectations concerning what makes a “real woman”. Often, the idea of this “real woman” does not involve her carrying a weapon, sleeping in foxholes, and not showering. In this paper, I will demonstrate how despite the advancements women have made in society, and in gaining access to military positions, women still face gender discrimination and have to prove their competence as soldiers, while also maintaining their femininity as women. Considering the growing number of women still entering the military to this day, it is important to ask the following, can women be both women and soldiers at the same time, if the military holds justice, equality, and freedom as its core values, then why is it that women join with the fear of inequality and unjust treatment?\n\nEmily Cadena\n\nLatiNO Student Left Behind? Why Latino Males Are Not Graduating from College\n\nBased on the 2010 Census, Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, and the group is projected to be driving the American work force in just a few short years. However, a concerning anomaly has recently been discovered: Latinos are struggling the most with educational attainment, making them the least likely demographic (especially males) to attend and graduate from college. This paper presents research from 10 interviews with Latino men to examine factors that impeded their capability to attend and/or persist in college. Specific factors examined were family support, financial responsibilities and concern, and encouragement from peers and educators. Unlike previous research, this paper will thoroughly explore father-son relationships, and how various dynamics of such may so heavily influence a Latino male’s decision to attend college or not. Data were analyzed using accordant qualitative research. Findings suggest that of all factors explored, the lack of parental support, in terms of having no knowledge about financial aid, the application process, or the American college system itself contributes the most to Latino males not attending or graduating from college. Suggestions for further research are provided.\n\nScarlett Cazares\n\nThe Function of Social Networks in the Daily Lives of People Experiencing Homelessness\n\nAt the start of 2014, The United States had an estimated 578,424 people experiencing homelessness. In 2015, there were 44,359 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County alone. This study seeks to understand the function of social networks in the daily lives of people experiencing homelessness. Research was conducted in a suburban city just outside of Los Angeles. It uses primarily ethnographic methods, including field observations and interviews to understand the ways social capital and recovery capital work in the lives of people experiencing homelessness; as well as what kinds of relationships they have with each other and with “support networks”, which are crucial to transitioning out of homelessness, as well as coping with day-to-day life. It is important to note that much of the research focus thus far has been on youths and substance abusers who are already in shelters. With the focus on demographically similar groups, these studies lack the understanding of the interactions between members of these groups. Additionally, research has predominantly been conducted in urban areas, excluding the experience of suburban homelessness. Matching the literature, findings include the cultivation of resourceful relationships which have resulted in access to services, as well as the utilization of social networks to enhance self-esteem. My research also draws attention to a concept I call “trust networks” which are comprised of people with whom the safety of self and possessions are presumed. Ultimately this study provides an understanding of the social lives of those that experience homelessness in our communities; and the ways in which social networks can aid the alleviation of homelessness as a social problem.\n\nAllison Cox\n\nLights, Camera, Female Action: Exploring the Media’s Depiction of Women’s Activism in the Arab Spring in Egypt\n\nThis paper will examine the roles women played in the “Arab Spring,” revolutionary uprisings that occurred across northern Africa with specific emphasis in regards to female activism in Egypt. As many of the North African societies were changing, through similar means of protest and civil unrest to achieve governmental and societal advancement, the uprisings in Egypt in particular used media as a means of achieving social and political change. This paper will analyze how women were portrayed within the media as icons and symbols of their gender. Through the use of viral videos, social media, and news media, women were able to expand outside of their homogenous representation and claim a sense of agency within this historical movement. However, the roles that they held within the revolution proved to be significantly different from their societal roles post-uprising.\n\nNicholas Creason\n\nNovorossiya, Crimea and Russian Irredentism\n\nThis paper will investigate Russian irredentism with a focus on the region called Novorossiya as well as Crimea. These regions, which lay outside of Russian Federation but were once part of the Russian Empire and its successor the Soviet Union. They seem to hold a special significance in the minds of some ethnic Russians both outside and inside Russia as being an integral part of Russia. I will draw on newspaper accounts as well as on literature to examine the views and goals of the ethnic Russians who wish for these territories to be part of the Russian Federation, as well as the policy goals of the Russian government. My paper will draw conclusions about the reasons for not just the conflict in the Ukraine but also similar conflicts that exist in other former Soviet Republics such as Transnistra in Moldalva.\n\nSamantha Cruz\n\nA Turn Around the Garden: Julia Margaret Cameron's Critique of Garden Imagery in Tennyson's “Maud” and “The Gardener's Daughter”\n\nI analyze three photographs posed and taken by the 19th-century photographer Julia Margaret Cameron in 1867-1868 which are titled after lines from Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s poems “The Gardener’s Daughter” and “Maud.” Both poems by Tennyson use garden imagery in order to create an idyllic space where the woman is sequestered and safe from the increasingly industrialized world beyond the gate. Cameron challenges these Victorian gender conventions by reclaiming the image of the garden. In Victorian society, women were expected to straddle the line between childlike innocence and matronly decorum. Julia Margaret Cameron, being aware of the contradictory expectations of women, sets out to show a progression through her own understanding of the garden, moving from praise to criticism. In “The Rosebud Garden of Girls” (1868), Cameron utilizes the physical closeness of her models as well as her characteristic blurred focus to create an idyllic and ethereal landscape in which the girls enjoy each other’s company. This dreamlike quality celebrates the garden as a female space allowing for female friendship apart from male influence, a parallel to the closeness of the female flowers inside Maud’s garden described in Tennyson’s poem, “Maud.” However, in “The Gardener’s Daughter” (1867) titled after the Tennyson poem of the same name, Cameron moves towards questioning the garden, suggesting the space is inherently unsafe because it allows the male to gaze in and idealize the female, just as the narrator does to the gardener’s daughter in Tennyson’s poem. Cameron does so by again blurring the landscape that lies beyond garden gate in the photograph, creating a feeling of unease in the viewer as the negative space looms threateningly behind the maiden within. Cameron’s criticism of the garden culminates in her The Passion Flower at the Gate (1868), in which her subject is much more dynamic, showing an anxious expression and gripping the garden gate in desperation. Cameron makes use of sharp angles and lines in order to portray the garden as suffocating and menacing because it confines the woman, an image in direct opposition to Tennyson’s idyllic descriptions in “Maud.” By critiquing the garden, Cameron establishes herself as a worthy female artist who ultimately rejects Tennyson’s male representation since it perpetuates harmful ideas of what a woman should be.\n\nRussell De La Rosa\n\nHitler's Consorts: A Study of German Women in Nazi Germany\n\nThis study will investigate the interactions, treatments, and involvements of German women within The Third Reich during World War II. With the general, under-representation of women within the social structure, this study seeks to illuminate the harsh, patriarchal ideologies of the Nazi regime that was forced upon the German women during the pre-war and war periods. I will also offer the argument that German women were stigmatized within a strong patriarchal society, promoting the idea that Nazi nationalism was really heterosexism during World War II. Generally, German women were limited in their involvement in the Nazi regime and were expected to stay home with the children while the soldiers were away from home. On the other hand, there were also German women who were very active within the Nazi regime that promoted the party’s ideologies, as well as promoted the visual of the “ideal German woman” in the eyes of the Nazi regime. As recent studies show, with the increasing conflict and the heat of war, women took a more active role in the Nazi regime during war-time that included work as secretaries, nurses, and even guards. Although the women were able to take more of an active role to somewhat “level the playing field” with the male soldiers, they were still restricted to what Adolf Hitler allowed them to do. Lastly, we will also explore the war crimes German women faced from enemy soldiers during wartime, as well as the acts of female genital mutilation that occurred upon German women that were deemed unfit to further the progression of the Aryan race according to Hitler’s Third Reich.\n\nTana Duong\n\nCollege Admission Rates: Examining Correlation Between Externalities and Household Influences to Higher Education Admittance Outcomes in the State of Washington, 2000- 2010\n\nThe pursuit of higher education is often associated with overall success in pursuing a career professionally as well as building the foundation for a promising livelihood. Yet the process of attending college has grown in prestige and with that, the pursuit of higher education now consists of greater barriers and commitment through standardized testing and centralized scoring systems. This suggests the conditioning of each individual student, as well as that of members in the student’s household, and additional factors such as upbringing and accessibility to resources may largely influence whether one attends college. Therefore, utilizing survey data collected by the University of Washington, this work examines the relationship between the likelihood that a student applies to college and the corresponding likelihood that s/he is accepted to college. Several surveys were conducted between the years 2000 and 2006. In total, data are available for more than 10,000 subjects who reside in all regions of the State of Washington. Thus, this paper utilizes state-level data to isolate the determinants of the pursuit of higher education by high school seniors. The analysis identifies strong correlations between participant’s gender, extracurricular activity, and upbringing when determining the outcome of college admission acceptance. Understanding the influence of factors that contribute to either the decision of applying to college as well as the rate of acceptance allows for greater encouragement and efficacy in the pursuit of higher education in future generations.\n\nSamantha Ettinger\n\nThe Effect of El Nino on Greenhouse Gas Concentrations in the Los Angeles Basin\n\nGreenhouse gases are naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere. However, the combustion of fossil fuels and agricultural practices have resulted in an increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. A surplus of greenhouse gases is a global concern due to the imminence of climate change and the overall warming of the planet which affects populations throughout the globe. On the other hand, the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the result of changing wind circulations that creates more precipitation in the Americas and less precipitation in the Western Pacific. The Los Angeles Air Basin traps pollutants such as greenhouse gases due to the inversion layers that often occur such as the Marine Inversion Layer and the Regional Subsidence Inversion. In this study, I collected Nitric Oxide (NOx) and tropospheric ozone concentration data (for the period 1997-2016) -specific to the Los Angeles Basin from the California Air Quality Resources Board. These concentrations were taken from a spectrometer in the Los Angeles Basin that recorded the highest concentration of specific greenhouse gas (nitric oxide or ozone) for that day. I also collected precipitation data from the California Air Quality Resources Board. Precipitation was measured hourly from the Los Angeles International Airport (33.9333 degrees N, 118.4 degrees W) and daily maximum concentrations were recorded by the spectrometer in millimeters. The data for both greenhouse gas concentrations and precipitation was grouped into wet months (October-April) and dry months (May-September) for comparison. Overall, decreased greenhouse gas concentrations both monthly and annually corresponded to higher amounts of precipitation in comparison to drier months and years (El Nino and Non-El Nino years). There was not a direct correlation between greenhouse gas concentrations and rainfall in the Los Angeles Basin, however, there was a decreasing trend. This suggests that pollutants that are normally trapped in the basin are uplifted due to the low-pressure system that is created with rainfall and are pushed eastward, as the general circulation of storms moves from west to east.\n\nAlissa Fa\n\nEnvironmental Policy on Invasive Species in Hawaii\n\nIn this paper, I address the specifics of when and why certain environmental policies in Hawaii were enacted in regards to invasive species. I will emphasize the importance of these policies and how they have affected and will continue to affect the environment in question. The purpose of this research is to examine Hawaii’s environmental policies in relation to the threat that invasive species, both plant and animal, pose to the fragile and unique ecosystem of the state. The topic of invasive species is growing increasingly important in Hawaii and more broadly, “invasive species” does not refer just to animals, but plant life and vegetation as well, which can affect economic, environmental, and societal health. To support this research, I will examine and draw from various case studies of invasive species, as well as analyze how the state has utilized rules and regulations to contain and eradicate these problems. Drawing from legislative and state/government councils I will identify the policies and the reasons that they were enacted. I will support my research and findings using literature from State and Government resources. Due to previous cases of invasive species and the negative impacts they had on the state it was clear that a council be enacted for rules and regulation, as seen in recent years the action set forth for threats of invasive species have proven to be effective.\n\nGabriel Forbes\n\nUn Handicap Transformateur: Grigris (2013) de Mahamat Saleh Haroun\n\nThe Chadian Director Mahamat Saleh Haroun deals with the topic of being handicapped in his 5th film, Grigris (2013). The purpose of this paper is to analyze how the main character is transformed by his handicap and from this, transforms others. It is a common belief that those who are handicapped also inherit a form of depression which is present within them for extended amounts of time. However, Grigris presents a different perspective which was that the handicap was not necessarily a hindrance. The movie presents a wide-ranging model for the physical and emotional characteristics of those handicapped. However, although he has a paralyzed leg, Grigris has a status in the community, a romantic relationship, and the glory of being a hero all because he is handicapped. First, we will consider how Grigris has a status in the community and how the handicap allows him to perform dance moves that others cannot. Next, we will consider his romantic relationship and link it to his handicap. Finally, we will consider his sense of community altruism and attribute it to his handicap. I will be conducting this presentation in French with a Power Point presentation.\n\nKrystal Frith and Maria Lara\n\nAssembling and Improving upon a Prosthetic Hand using a 3D Printer\n\nThrough the Artemis program, we had the opportunity to print a prosthetic hand using a 3D printer. 3D printed prosthetic hands are less expensive and could achieve the same functions as a traditional prosthetic hand, but 3D printed hands have a difficult time at turning doorknobs and grasping smooth surfaced objects. There is not enough friction between the 3D printed hand and a smooth surfaced object because of the lack of palm lines, and the creases on both the palm and fingers. This led to our main goal which was to mirror the grip of the 3D printed hand to the grip of a real hand by determining the coefficient of static friction with different materials such as sandpaper, tire liner, grip liner, and sticky pads. The results would allow us to find the best suited material in order to enhance the grip of the 3D printed hand to allow it to lift and move objects easily. We found that the grip liner had the highest coefficient of static friction by laying a block on a smooth table surface, and in between the table and the block we tested each of the three materials using a pulley at the end of the table. Weights were hung on the end of the string to test the friction of the material by measuring the weights until the block started moving. After doing this, we used the formula µs=mh/mb, mb being the weight of the block and mh being the weight of the hanging mass, to determine the coefficient of static friction, µs. After printing the hand, we assembled the prosthetic hand and applied grip liner to the fingers and palm while improvising because the hand did not print adequately. Once the hand was assembled it was clear that the hand would be more functional than before the material was applied because it was able to lift objects because of the friction created from the grip liners.\n\nLauren Galantai\n\nThe Importance of Physical Activity and Nutrition Education during after School Care\n\nIn today’s society, the obesity rate continues to increase among the youth population. Although the government has mandated healthy school lunch programs, there are still many times students are not eating nutrient dense items. In order to improve children’s lifestyle choices, holistic interventions encompassing physical activity and nutrition education need to be implemented during after school care, and they must connect to the child’s homelife. Once a week, for six weeks, I visited a local Whittier YMCA to facilitate the existing healthy eating and physical activity program. Through the implementation of the healthy lifestyle curriculum, the positive impacts of a nutrition program were seen through qualitative observations and interviews. Through student engagement in healthy lifestyle activities and parent engagement in maintaining a healthy household, improvements in both the student’s and the family’s attitudes and choices towards a healthy lifestyle were seen by all the staff members. Staff observed parents packing their children healthier lunches and snacks, the children began taking daily walks around the block, and by the end of the summer the YMCA took the children on a hike. To extend the knowledge of the importance of nutrition and exercise to more youth in the area, I have reached out to other organizations with the goal of implementing similar lifestyle intervention curriculum, constructed and implemented an experiment with a group of high school students regarding the importance of nutrition and exercise, and contacted local Whittier governmental agencies regarding this project and to share the results, so they may encourage other after school organizations to participate in this endeavor of healthy lifestyle education.\n\nAzaria Garcia and Maryam Hami\n\nCorrelation between Acacia Mearnsii growth, Prionium Serratum, and stream speed in the Western Cape of South Africa\n\nScientists have previously struggled with determining exactly what makes the invasive species Acacia mearnsii successful. We sought to discover if there is a relationship between the invasion of Acacia mearnsii, Prionium serratum cover, and stream flow. We predicted that the density of Acacia mearnsii along the Holsloot River in South Africa have an inverse relationship with stream power and the Prionium serratum cover. Riparian habitats in South Africa have been negatively impacted by the invasion of Acacia mearnsii. The increasing density of Acacia mearnsii along the Holsloot River, may reduce light availability for native species. Since flooding leads to the removal of native species along the riparian zone, we asked if this will cause an increase in the density of Acacia mearnsii. To answer this question, 3 transects along the riverbed in 3 different areas along the Holsloot River were used to first measure the ratio of the density of Acacia mearnsii and Prionium serratum. The transects went inland and were 3 meters long. The stream speed was measured directly adjacent to the transects on land using the tennis ball method. In these same areas light measurements were taken using a Decagon septometer. All the results indicate that there is a positive relationship between Acacia mearnsii, Prionium serratum, and stream power along the Holsloot River. So, where Prionium serratum stabilizes the streambank we see increased density of Acacia mearnsii.\n\nMegan Garcia\n\nStandard Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Efficiency Comparative to Active Compression Decompression Mechanical Devices for Cardiac Arrest Patients: A Meta-Analytic Review\n\nWe compared active compression decompression (ACD) mechanical devices and standard (STD) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in cardiac arrest (CA) patients. Although active compression decompression is a popular treatment in medicine, there is controversy of the effect of ACD- CPR in comparison to standard CPR. This meta-analysis was to study the effectiveness and safety of active compression decompression devices versus standard CPR when treating cardiac arrest patients. An electronic search for articles through various data bases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane (papers of meta-analysis), etc. was conducted for studies reporting cardiac arrest patients who were treated with CPR. These random trials, published from January 1950 to August 2016, were searched using the phrase “standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation and active compression decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation”. Primary outcomes considered were the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rate, survival rate pre- and post-hospital admission, and survival after 24 hours. Complications of CPR were considered to be secondary outcomes. The effects discovered in the included studies were calculated in accordance to the fixed-effects model and random-effects model. The I^2 method was used to determine the statistical heterogeneity that is assumed in the random-effects model. Data was extracted from the 10 studies that met the criteria for this meta-analysis. The studies included 378 adult CA patients treated with the ACD-CPR and 373 patients with standard CPR. Out of the patients reviewed, 218 were out of hospitals and the other 317 were in hospitals. Three articles were identified as high-quality where the other seven articles had poor methodology. The ROSC rate, survival rate after 24 hours, and survival rate at hospital discharge determined that ACD-CPR is preferable to standard CPR, with a relative risk (RR) values of 1.32 (95% CI 0.92-1.90), 1.87 (95% CI 1.38-2.52) and 2.72 (95% CI 1.52-5.17). The survival rate to hospital admission and hospital discharge showed no significant difference between the two treatments, ACD-CPR and standard CPR, with values of 1.02 (95% CI 0.72-1.56) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.69- 1.34). The ROSC rate and the survival rate after 24 hours showed that ACD-CPR is more admirable to standard CPR. To hospital admission or discharge, there was no significant difference between ACD-CPR and standard CPR in terms of survival rate.\n\nTyler Garfield\n\nPTSD as a Social Disorder\n\nPTSD can be a serious stress disorder caused from the aftermath of a catastrophic event such as war. The focus of this research is to look at PTSD from a social aspect. Is PTSD a social disorder just as much as it is a psychological disorder? A great deal of research has been done in the past about how PTSD affects an individual’s brain activity. But what has not been looked at specifically is how PTSD affects social interaction. People diagnosed with PTSD still have to go about their everyday lives, and this research targets how their social lives have been affected by the disorder. This is important because with the information gathered, it may pave the way to a better understanding of the disorder and how to better treat people with PTSD. In collecting information for this proposal, I interviewed several participants who have been diagnosed or suffered forms of PTSD and asked questions about their social and personal life. Most people who were interviewed were war veterans along with a few who have been through traumatic experiences in their life. The results were compelling: each person who I interviewed had struggled just as much socially as they did mentally and emotionally. These results were very consistent and support the logic that PTSD is in fact a social disorder.\n\nJulia Giffin\n\nPropaganda and the Women of the Soviet Military\n\nThis paper will examine the differences in the portrayal of female combatants in propaganda and reality, specifically focusing on women in the Soviet Military during World War II. While women made up a much smaller portion of the military than men, as the war progressed the number of women in the military increased, with some receiving the highest honor in the Soviet Military, Hero of the Soviet Union. Women faced many difficulties during their time in the Soviet Military that their male counterparts did not, but it did not stop them from having major successes on the battlefield. This paper will compare and contrast the depiction of women in the Soviet Military in propaganda and the reality these women faced, and what impact this difference made for these women, as well as societies view of them.\n\nTerianne Hamada and Leslie Lien\n\nSynthesis and Photophysical Studies of Lophine Derivatives with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Moieties and Electron-Donating Groups\n\nLophines (2,4,5-triphenylimidazoles) are of interest due to their luminescent properties, which can be utilized in fields such as bioimaging and optical data storage. 9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde and 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde were used to prepare lophine derivatives with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moieties in the 2-position, in good yield. 9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde and 4,4’-dimethoxybenzil were used to prepare a lophine derivative with anthracene as the substituent at the 2-position and electron-donating groups on the aryl rings at the 4- and 5-positions. 10-chloro-9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde was used to prepare a derivative with the chloro-anthracenyl substituent in the 2-position. Photophysical properties of these lophine derivatives were examined in acetonitrile solution at room temperature. The absorption spectrum of the anthracene lophine had maxima at 254, 196, 346, 366 and 385 nm (values for e were 1.02×105, 1.08×104, 4.90×103 8.16×103, and 1.10×104 cm-1M-1, respectively), while the emission spectrum had a maximum 496 nm. The absorption spectrum of the pyrene lophine had maxima at 239, 280 and 374 nm (values for e were 5.29×104, 2.21×104, and 2.78×104 cm-1M-1, respectively), and the emission spectrum had a maximum at 366 nm. The absorption spectrum of the anthracene-dimethoxybenzil lophine had absorption maxima at 250, 257, 308, 355, 375, and 395nm (values for e were 1.29×105, 1.16×104, 4.40×103, 7.40×103, and 9.20×104 cm-1M-1, respectively), and the emission spectrum had maxima at 540nm. The absorption spectrum of the chloro-anthracene derivative had absorption maxima at 250, 257, 308, 355, 375, and 395nm (values for e were 7.84×104, 8.51×104, 6.80×103, 3.70×103, 7.40×103, and 9.00×103 cm-1M-1, respectively), and the emission spectrum had maxima at 381 and 527nm. Excited state lifetimes and fluorescence quantum yields at room temperature were determined for all compounds.\n\nBrittany Hedderson Moses\n\nPreventative Measures and Coping Techniques for Athlete Burnout\n\nAthlete burnout is a phenomenon that has been studied for decades and several different theories have been used to explain its origins. Although, this review will present different approaches to burnout, each theory understands burnout as a manifestation of specific responses to stress. Athlete burnout is generally and most often defined as withdrawal from a formerly enjoyable activity and characterized by physical and emotional exhaustion, reduced sense of accomplishment and sport devaluation (Raedeke & Smith, 2001; 2009). Burnout is found among competitive athletes of all ages, sports and cultures and can be experienced as varying levels or as a complete withdrawal from a sport (Coakley, 1992; Smith, 1986). Although research on the prevalence of athlete burnout has not been extensive, the need for a review is imperative because of the troubling effects burnout has on an athlete’s well-being (DeFreese & Smith, 2014; Lundquist & Sandin, 2014). Recent literature has presented conflicting results concerning identity as a potential risk factor and protective measure against burnout (Brewer, Van Raalte, & Linder, 1993). Considering these discrepancies, a literature review is necessary to critically analyze the current research and examine the reasons for varying results. This review will also update the knowledge base on the importance of mental skills as coping techniques to prevent and mitigate the effects of stress related to athletic performance (Khodayari, Saiiari & Dehghani, 2011). Conclusions and future directions are identified as well as implications for professionals to protect the mental health of athletes.\n\nEric Hinwood\n\nThe Encaged Partridge and it’s Flight: Madame Brouette (2002) by Moussa Sene Absa\n\nMadame Brouette (2002), directed by Moussa Sene Absa, is a feminist film that has a unique look at the Senegalese culture regarding the abuse of women by focusing on a woman entrepreneur who is trying to empower herself and her friends to overcome the three main ways in which they experience oppression: physically, mentally and legally. The purpose of this essay is to discuss the Senegalese cultural issues that the film uses to further the plot and to demonstrate how the protagonist attempts to overcome some of the aforementioned issues, as well to highlight the relationship between our protagonist and a caged partridge. The main character, Mati “Mrs. Wheelbarrow”, commits many actions, both objectively good and evil depending on the perspective of the observer, to fight the physical oppression of her country’s culture, especially regarding Ndaxte, and interaction between Naago and herself. First, we will focus on physical oppression, using the interaction between Biraan and Ndaxte, and between Mati and Naago, while also touching on cheating, drugs, and money in order to bring these problems to light. All physical wrongs and physical oppression are discussed in this section, along with what Mati has done to combat them and ensure her freedom. Next, we will discuss all the mental oppression and wrongdoings and how Mati trys to change the minds of others through her own actions and ideas. This section focuses on problems with how men look at women, the pressure to have children, and problems with social classes. Finally, we will debate the ways that Senegal has created legal problems for women, because in the film it is made extremely clear that it is very difficult, nigh impossible, for a woman to open a business, to have security in life, and to earn money to use for her own needs and desires without a man. The partridge, similar in various ways to Mati, begins this film in a cage. Their similarities will be revealed in each part of this essay. This presentation will be in French.\n\nHailey Holmgren\n\nBehavior and Social Development of Maltreated Children in Foster Care\n\nMany studies have looked at how maltreatment relates to behavioral development and school performance as well as foster care and behavioral development and school performance, but not much research has been done on children in foster care who have experienced maltreatment. Since many children who are in foster care have experienced maltreatment, this literature review focuses on how both of these adversities affect behavior and school performance specifically during early childhood and middle childhood, and slightly into early adolescence. This literature review questions if children facing these adversities are more likely to have lower school performance and higher risk behavior compared to their peers not in the foster system and non-maltreated. It is examined if interventions can increase school performance and decrease risk behavior. This research found that children who are in foster care and are maltreated show more externalizing and internalizing behavior problems as well as difficulty in school. Interventions have helped these children when they are implemented during transitional periods of their lives. If more knowledge is available about this vulnerable group of children, they may be less likely to show risk behaviors and have higher school performance.\n\nEmily Iniguez and Maria Rea\n\nWrong Integration Done Right\n\nDr. Bill Kronholm, in his article, “Integration By the Wrong Parts”, gives detailed explanation of how to solve a calculus integration problem by using the “wrong parts”. The term of “using the wrong parts” refers to the manner by which integrating by the incorrect parts allows for a simple function to be expanded into a longer and more intricate equation, resulting in a more condensed product utilizing the Taylor Series. This theory was tested with different integral equations and the results were astounding. Kronholm’s theory is proven in this experiment by showing that the mathematically correct manner of evaluating a mathematical statement is not always the only way of solving for its product; in fact, the use of the incorrect parts could produce more accurate results. Interestingly enough, although the integral that was evaluated turned into a long and complicated equation, it was able to be condensed much more easily than by attempting to evaluate it utilizing the correct procedure. If the correct procedure was used, this would have never produced a simplified anti-derivative that was being solved for. This experiment proved that solving an equation incorrectly may actually yield a much ``nicer'' looking product.\n\nAlyse James\n\nMinority Groups in the Punk Scene: Before there was Punk, there was a Band Called Death\n\nMy research is centered on minorities in the Punk Rock Scene. The punk rock scene was in response to normative mainstream culture, but even in the Punk Scene, minorities (racial minorities, women, non-gender binary identifying etc.) were underrepresented. My objective was to showcase these underrepresented bands, as well as to showcase the white, male, cis gender, and heterosexual privilege that still remains, even in the punk scene. This was a final project for my Sociology of Punk Rock Class. I watched a documentary called Afro Punk at Garret house and James Spooner the director of the film, after the screening said that Maurice Mitchell who was featured as the lead singer in the band Cipher, was now one of the leaders in the Black Lives Matter Movement. That sparked my interest, because I think there is a strong correlation between Punk Rock and Social Movements. The Riot Grrrl movement was formed out of the Punk Rock Scene. I was able to get in contact with Maurice, and asked him a number of questions about his experience in the Punk Rock Scene, and his views on the lack of minority representation in the scene itself. From the research I conducted I found that in order to change the dynamics of Punk Scene to make it less oppressive to marginalized groups, you’d have to restart the scene all together. My research poses the question, “Is Punk even punk?” If the punk scene is supposed to be a safe space for those who don’t fit in the main stream culture, then why are marginalized groups still fighting for representation in the punk scene?\n\nAlexandra Jimenez and Laura Smith\n\nThe Impact of S-Nitrosocysteamine on F508Del CFTR Protein Expression, Maturation, and Function to the Cell Surface\n\nCystic fibrosis can be a devastating disease having the ability to shorten the lifespan of a patient. There are 30,000 people in the United States that suffer from cystic fibrosis today. F508del is the most common Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) defect. Though there have been advances in discovering pharmaceutical targets for Cystic Fibrosis, there are no ideal treatments for correcting the F508Del CFTR protein to the cell surface. The existing drugs and methods used to treat F508Del CFTR still leave patients at risk of advancing to severe lung disease and death. S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is currently being tested for its potential to treat F508Del CFTR in patients. S-nitrosocysteamine (CA-SNO), S-nitroso-Coenzyme A (CoA-SNO), and S-nitroso-L-cysteine (L-CSNO) have also been found to be F508Del correctors in a previous study. These s-nitrosothiol signaling molecules increase the expression, maturation, and function of the F508Del CFTR. The goal of the current study is to get a better understanding of the mechanism of action that the molecules use to correct F508Del CFTR. Specifically, western blot was used to observe the effect of different concentrations of CA-SNO and Vertex 809 on the CFTR maturation of Wild Type CFBE-410 CF cells and CFBE-410DeltaF Cells. Overall, the western blots for CFBE-410 CF WT cells and CFBE-410 DeltaF Cells showed the possibility that CA-SNO works with Vertex 809 to enhance their effects on delF508 CFTR expression at the ER. Biochemistry, pharmacology, catabolism, transport, and synthesis of CA-SNO, COA-SNO, L-CSNO, and GSNO in the airway epithelium need to be further investigated.\n\nMathew Johnson and Brian Doyle\n\nEngineering Stilbene and Azobenzene-Based Metal Organic Frameworks for Tailored Light Emission\n\nMetal organic frameworks offer a degree of predictability in the topology of the resulting structures. The primary MOF geometry (i.e., the shape of the secondary building unit (SBU) from which the MOF is constructed) can be influenced by both the linker shape and the metal coordination geometry. The ultimate structure observed in the solid-state can therefore be predicted in ideal cases by considering typical metal ion and/or ligand coordination preferences. This can lead to the generation of homologous series, such as O. Yaghi’s isoreticular IRMOF materials), and can allow materials properties that are influenced by the solid-state structure to be tuned in a rational manner. For example, we report here two distinct Zn-stilbene MOF structures that exhibit different solid-state emission profiles, resulting from important differences in stilbene-stilbene distances in the two different geometries. Varying the reaction conditions between stilbene dicarboxylic acid and zinc nitrate affords both 2D and 3D geometries, with the difference between materials (and, hence, in structure) clearly evident upon observing the luminescence color. Similarly, we reported changing the metal ion to give a series of isostructural 2D structures with the generic formula M3L3(DMF)2. Here, the observed luminescence is solely a function of the stilbene-stilbene geometry, not the metal. The emission spectra are similar, only varying in intensity due to the presence of a quenching paramagnetic metal (Mn). Here we report on a novel phenomenon whereby we are able to modulate the secondary structure of a MOF (i.e., generate structures with the same SBU geometries but with different arrangements of these SBUs with respect to each other) through subtle variations of the ligand electronic structure by incorporating the linker azobenzene dicarboxylic acid. Theoretical and experimental results will be presented.\n\nJulio Juarez\n\nIndigenous Women's Encounter with “Feminism”\n\nThis comparative work examines indigenous women’s range of involvement in indigenous movements, particularly those protesting neoliberal policies in Canada and Southern Mexico. Ranging from women’s involvement in the front lines of the Zapatista movement, their involvement in the creation of the Nisga’a common bowl, or women’s involvement in the Zapotec’s struggle for autonomy. Exploring how place, colonial and postcolonial history, and identity shape indigenous feminism, while also exploring the distinctions, if any, between nationalism and women’s agency in these movements and their relevance in the movement. All while taking note of the perceived gender roles that they face as women and as indigenous women. This work hopes to shed some light on feminist perspectives that separate themselves from traditional western feminist thought, but also looking for the similarities and how these ideas are implemented into the movements and to what extent that they have on women's participation and the effect it has had on the movements.\n\nHyesoo Kim and Stephanie Zamora\n\nAntibacterial Properties of Selected Herbs on Bacillus Megaterium, Enterobacter Aerogenes and Enterococcus Faecalis\n\nBacteria have developed antibiotic resistance creating the need for natural alternatives. Herbs, a class of natural products, have been shown to inhibit bacterial growth in various studies. In this study, antibacterial properties of seven herbs were tested on Bacillus megaterium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. The herbs in the study were extracted with methanol, filtered, roto-evaporated and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Bacteria were grown in tryptic soy broth and incubated overnight. The samples were then diluted to match a 0.5 McFarland standard to ensure a fixed bacteria density. Samples were composed of 1500µL of diluted bacteria with 20µL of herb samples and incubated/shaken at 37°C for 45 minutes. The percent transmittance of each sample was measured at a wavelength of 625nm hourly until the control decreased to less than 50%. Percent inhibition was determined by normalizing the percentage transmittance of the sample at 50% of the normalized control. Bacillus megaterium exhibited the greatest inhibition with the herbs (41-67%). In contrast, Enterobacter aerogenes had an inhibition of 33-58%, and Enterococcus faecalis had an inhibition of 11-27%. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) for catnip on Bacillus megaterium was 0.014g/mL. In the future, additional MIC values will be determined, and additional bacteria will be tested. This study has demonstrated the potential for herbs to be effective antibacterial agents.\n\nDaria Kosmynina\n\nBiomarker Research for Behcet’s Disease\n\nBehcet’s Disease (BD) is an autoimmune disease that originated along the Silk Road and is prevalent in Asian and Mediterranean countries. However, BD is a rare disease in western countries such as the U.S. and Spain. It develops from genetic and environmental factors and as a result, the immune system attacks self, causing symptoms such as oral and genital ulcers, skin and eye lesions, and joint disorders. Currently, BD does not have specific biomarkers that could guide doctors determine the disease in patients. This summer, only serum from healthy patients was obtained and purified with Affinity Chromatography, and samples were tested with a Western Blot to identify impurities. The Magnetic Bead purifying technique was performed to isolate peptides from HLA that is bound to a mouse biotinylated antibody, to the constant region of the sHLA. Streptavidin is bound to magnetic beads, which bounds the biotin molecule, on the antibody; the peptides are then removed from this complex by elution with 0.1% FA. After a Western Blot was done, the bands were accurate except for the purified sHLA and purified antibody samples, which should have shown one band instead of two. This indicates that there was excess of antibody and sHLA that the Magnetic Beads did not capture. Once this method is optimized, the purified peptide samples will be sent to City of Hope for a Mass Spectroscopy analysis.\n\nNathan Landau\n\nCan a GINI Stimulate Growth? Examining Effects of Income Inequality on GDP Growth Rates\n\nIncome inequality is a topic that has been heatedly discussed both within economies and on a global scale. While perhaps intuitively negative, with respect to the overall health of an economy, theories do exist that point to a positive relationship between income inequality and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, though the majority of the existing literature on the topic concludes that high amounts of income inequality negatively affect economic growth. Economies realize GDP growth through increases in factor endowments (i.e., land, labor and capital), by qualitative improvements in existing factors, and by general technological advancement. For example, greater investment can lead to capital formation and job creation. Using a linear regression model and data for 106 countries that span the period from 1980-2014, this project examines the relationship between income inequality, as measured by GINI Coefficients, GDP growth rates, while controlling for other determinants of economic growth. The relationship is examined generally and for country cohorts that correspond to World Bank income classifications. The relationship between inequality and growth is important, especially for developing countries, as their continued growth can be maximized by identifying the optimal, level of income inequality. The empirical analysis reveals a consistent negative relationship between income inequality and GDP growth rates over the time period examined. Thus, government policies should be geared towards reducing income inequality to realize higher rates of GDP growth.\n\nJimmy Lopez and Charisma Johnson\n\nThe Effect of Exercise on Blood Oxygen Saturation, Heart Rate, and Blood Pressure in Athletes Compared to Non-athletes\n\nThere are notable benefits of exercise as it pertains to the overall fitness of the heart and the individual. Our research set out to understand the advantage and difference in the effect of strenuous exercise between athletes (AT) and non-athletes (NA) through a collection and comparative analysis of the blood pressure (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure mmHg), heart rate (HR beats/min), and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2 %) from 14 young adult individuals. We hypothesized based on previous trends and research that athletes (AT) will have a lower heart rate and blood pressure post exercise compared to non-athletes (NA) due to their increased level of fitness, accompanied by a decrease in blood oxygen saturation (SpO2 %) overall for both AT and NA. However, heart rate values recorded post-exercise significantly differed between the two groups as NA had a value of 84.38 beats per minute that surpasses the AT value of 78.66 beats per minute (P<0.05). As far as blood pressure, there was no significant difference of systolic pressures among both groups (P>0.05). On the other hand, diastolic pressure recorded after exercise showed a significant difference as the NA value of 98 mm Hg was considerably higher than AT at 79 mm Hg (P<0.05). In terms of SpO2 there was a decrease among AT of 2%, yet an increase in NA of 1% following physical activity. Nonetheless, these changes were not significantly different (P>0.05). We were able to conclude based on the results that regimental physical activity has an impact on the overall level of fitness of the individual. Overall findings suggest that due to the effects of exercise regardless of being an athlete or non-athlete, the heart rate and blood pressure will increase while the blood oxygen saturation level slowly decreases, depending on fitness of the individual.\n\nJoshua Lopez\n\nLung Cancer Screening in Survivors of Previous Cancers\n\nLung cancer-screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) has been shown to decrease mortality in high-risk patients. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends LDCT for patients age 55-80 with at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking. Lung cancer screening in patients with a previous history of malignancy raises a complex set of issues. Patients with a previous history of malignancy may be at higher-risk for developing lung cancer. Those with a history of solid tumors are at risk of cancer recurrence or metastatic disease to the lung. It is unclear whether the same management strategies can be used in assessing nodules among these patients. We analyzed data from a database of lung cancer screening performed at a National Comprehensive Cancer Network designated comprehensive cancer center and identified all patients enrolled in the lung cancer-screening program who had a previous history of cancer. Patients were enrolled in the lung cancer-screening program if they met NCCN guidelines for screening and if their treating oncologist estimated their median survival to be greater than 5 years. Patients were excluded if they were already undergoing chest CTs as part of surveillance for their previous cancer. After a discussion of the risks and benefits of lung cancer-screening, patients underwent LDCT. Patients with negative scans underwent repeat annual LDCT. Management of all positive scans was determined in a multidisciplinary lung cancer-screening board. From 2012-2015, 142 patients with a previous history of cancer were enrolled in our lung cancer-screening program. The mean age of patients was 65 ± 9 years. 58 (40%) were current smokers and the mean smoking history was 44 pack years. Breast cancer was the most common previous cancer diagnosis (51/142,30%) and prostate cancer was second (40/142,23%). 20 patients (12%) had a previous, remote history of lung cancer, but were not undergoing active surveillance. Of the initial scans, 89 (62%) were positive, with a mean nodule size of 8 mm. Among the positive scans, the vast majority 52 (58%) were Lung-RADS category 2. A total of 7 cancers were detected (5%)–6 new primary lung cancers and 1 metastatic melanoma. Patients with a significant smoking history who also have a previous history of malignancy may be at increased risk for development of lung cancer. Nodule assessment in these patients is more complicated due to the possibility of metastatic disease. In our experience, the diagnosis of a new primary lung cancer was much more common than the identification of metastatic disease.\n\nLindsey Macdonald\n\nAssortative Mating and its Effect on Modern Household Income Inequality in the United States\n\nHousehold income inequality has been rising in the United States since 1970. Only a portion of this inequality is explained by the underlying wage inequalities. A variety of other factors account for the remainder of the trend. Specifically, empirical evidence suggests that assortative mating has contributed to the rise in household income inequality; however, the impact of this phenomenon is debated and, thus, remains an open empirical question. Assortative mating is a mating pattern and a form of sexual selection in which similar individuals mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern. With respect to household inequality, this pattern may have implications through individuals with similar education levels being more likely to marry or cohabitate. To explore this potential relationship, we perform an empirical analysis using data from the American Community Survey for the years 2010-2014 that includes regression of husband’s education level to that of their wife’s. We then construct two contingency tables, one for the distribution of pairs by education level and another for the distribution of pairs by random matching. The distributions are then employed to create corresponding Lorenz Curves and the calculation of associated Gini Coefficients. This permits determination of the degree of household income inequality that can be attributed to this sorting of spouses.\n\nJessica Martineau\n\nTantra and Unification: A Study of the Hymn to Kali\n\nThis paper focuses on “left-hand” tantric ritual practices that are situated within a Hindu theological and philosophical framework. Tantra (lit. weave) as a body of texts and practices foregrounds the importance of sadhana (ritual visualizations and initiations). “Left-hand” refers to a specific type of Tantra that incorporates often forbidden activities (e.g., sexual visualization) into sadhana. The paper explores concepts regarding the cosmos that are intrinsic to understanding tantric practices and texts. Concepts include but are not limited to the three gunas or qualities that are present in all things; Siva (efficient cause of the universe) and Sakti (animating female energy) as dualistic, omnipresent, and paradoxically unified; and, the balance between Purusa or consciousness and Prakrti or nature/matter. The ultimate goal is to analyze the connections between these concepts of the cosmos in relation to devotional practices and imagery of the Goddess as presented in the “Hymn to Kali” and a commentary on it; I will show how the structure and content of the text focuses on unification between (in terms of the panel abstract as a whole, “inclusion” of) a devotee and (in) the Goddess, in the process of visualizing a transition from destruction to compassion, based on particular understandings of the gunas, etc. Evidence from field research is not a component of this paper, but I will suggest avenues for further research in that regard.\n\nJustine Mata\n\nThe Phylogenetic Relationships of Bursatella Leachii Subspecies and Their Sister Group Stylocheius\n\nAplysiidae or sea hares have an important value in the field of biology. For example, neurobiologists examine their large neuronal system to better understand memory and learning, and ecologists examine their defense mechanisms through the toxins they secrete. These toxins have the potential to be used in the medical field, for example, some chemicals from sea hares have been important in cancer research. Sea hares contain around 80 species; however, their relationships between one another are not entirely clear. Bursatella leachii has a circumtropical distribution and is hypothesized to have around seven subspecies. However, this has not been tested yet. Additionally, the relationship of B. leachii to other sea hares has not been resolved. Here, a phylogeny of B. leachii was reconstructed to test the B. leachii subspecies hypothesis and to understand how B. leachii is related to other sea hares. Genes from B. leachii specimens were amplified using polymerase chain reaction. The genetic information was then used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship of B. leachii and other sea hares. The preliminary results show that B. leachii is a monophyletic group that is sister to Stylocheilus sea hares. Within B. leachii there is some evidence that subspecies exist, but population genetic methods may be required to determine them. B. leachiii is an important species to study as a purple fluid secreted by the species has been shown to contain a protein with anti-HIV properties. Understanding the phylogenetic relationships of B. leachii is of medical importance as it potentially provides alternative sources for anti-HIV proteins and expanding HIV research.\n\nCollin McDowell\n\nUnderstanding the Context and Ramifications of Hong Kong’s Umbrella Revolution\n\nThis paper describes the short-term effects of the 2014 Umbrella Revolution on the political and social atmosphere of Hong Kong. Additionally, the paper offers insights into the future of Hong Kong’s government, activist groups, and relationship with mainland China. The protests, which were led by activist groups consisting primarily of high school and college level students, had the effect of politicizing the youth and revitalizing the notion of political participation in Hong Kong. However, the use of force by the police during the Umbrella Revolution, especially when considered in light of the more recent Mong Kok Fishball Riots, strikes a worrisome note about the future of political discourse in Hong Kong. The paper is based primarily upon research and personal interviews compiled one year after the event of the Umbrella Revolution, including opinions from a number of sources involved with the protests, such as professors, businessmen, and protesters.\n\nAlyssa Mendez\n\nTeacher Perceptions of Inclusive Education\n\nAs public schools within the United States are facing pressure to alter the general education classroom setting into a more accommodating learning environment for students of all abilities, teachers are hesitant to undergo such a transition. Many advocates for inclusive education insist that the integration of students with special needs and typically performing students can be a mutually beneficial learning experience. Current literature concerning inclusive education of children with disabilities makes two dominant arguments: teachers’ differing attitudes towards the efficacy of inclusive education within in a general education classroom setting, and the overrepresentation of racial/ethnic minority students, who are often referred into segregated (non-inclusive) special education programs. However, we do not know how the race/ethnicity of special education students impacts how teachers perceive the efficacy of including these students in a general education classroom setting. This study utilizes a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodology, comprising surveying and interviewing a sample of twenty-seven special education and non-special education (general education/multiple subject) public school teachers. The survey questions concerned teachers’ experiences and views involving classroom inclusion as a feasible and beneficial option for both special needs and typically performing peers. In addition to the surveys, teachers were invited to partake in an interview to supplement their survey responses in more depth. After reviewing the responses, it was evident that an overall lack of time, academic training, experience with students with special needs largely contributed to teachers’ confidence (and lack thereof) with inclusive education. Teachers of color were also more likely to acknowledge the abundance of minority students within special education. Almost every teacher indicated that all students deserve a right to a quality education despite any disabilities. However, as the responses suggest, a quality education is not feasible for all students, particularly when the teacher does not feel confident in his/her training. This study revealed that this particular sample of general education teachers do not feel as though they can successfully accommodate the academic needs of students in special education due to this lack of training and experience. The benefits of inclusive education continue to be obscured behind teachers’ self-proclaimed lack of confidence and inability to provide a proper education for all students. An effort to properly educate and train these teachers may reduce this lack of confidence.\n\nAlyssa Mendez\n\nArt and Madness in Victorian Photography\n\nI examined two sets of photographs; one set by art photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, and one set by doctors Hugh Welch Diamond and James Crichton-Browne. As photography became a distinguished medium in the Victorian era, the camera became celebrated for its ability to represent truth, a means to capture the literal exterior of a scene or individual. However, Julia Margaret Cameron, a renown British photographer, admitted to utilizing her camera to faithfully record what she interpreted as one’s “inner being”, or soul. Cameron stated that through photography, she was able to simultaneously record the features of the outer-being as well as the greatness of the inner-being. But how can a camera concurrently record the greatness of the inner, as well as the outer? This notion seems both contradictory and difficult to understand, as an individual’s internality is not visible through a single, stagnant image. Interestingly, early psychiatric professionals of the Victorian period also assumed that the camera could authentically capture the inner being, in particular, the mental instability of madness. Through their photographs, Dr. Hugh Welch Diamond and Dr. James Crichton-Browne explored the physiognomy of their patients quite faithfully, in an attempt to make a connection between the individual’s physical appearance (the exterior) and their mental health (the interior). These photographs of patients were taken in order to create medical documentation as well as diagnostic purposes. My paper displays how Julia Margaret Cameron and two doctors, Dr. Diamond and Dr. Crichton-Browne utilize the camera to “record” both the interiority and exteriority of their subjects. However, I conclude that in pursuit of capturing the inner being, these photographs veer away from “truth” as the photographers focus their attention on items of clothing and manipulation of their subjects’ appearance. I ultimately question the legitimacy of the doctors’ intentions behind these photographs and argue that the so-called inner-being that the doctors are capturing is nothing more than notions that are in the heads of the photographers that they purposefully attribute to their subjects.\n\nSarah Meuwissen\n\nEvaluation of Long-Term Effects of Chlorpyrifos Oxon and Diazionon Oxon on Differentiating PC-12 Cells\n\nOrganophosphate (OP) pesticides are a widely used and readily available class of pesticides used for protecting crops and livestock. OP pesticides gain their toxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which leads to hyperstimulation at the cholinergic synapse. Hyperstimultation affects neuronal development, function, and survival. Toxicity of Chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) and Diazinon oxon (DZO) were determined by exposing rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells to a range of concentrations (10 µM, 5 µM, 1 µM, .1 µM, and .01 µM). MTS assays were conducted to determine the cell viability and effect of these toxins. Once EC50 levels were determined, stage specific toxicity for DZO and CPO were conducted with sub-lethal concentrations at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Data revealed that DZO (100 µM) demonstrated no impact on the longevity of PC12 cells at any stage of differentiation. CPO (100 µM) reduced cell survival at later stages of cell development. By understanding the toxicity of CPO and DZO, we can better understand the neurotoxicity of these contaminants and their possible implication on neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nReneé Miller\n\nThe Changing Faces of Death in America: Shifting Trends in American Funerals\n\nScholars have long noted the changing culture of funeral practices in North America and our cemeteries serve as a historic record of death and mortuary practices in America. Advances in technology and cultural diffusion have changed the landscape of the American funeral industry and the progression and choices of mortuary practices and beliefs have evolved tremendously. The American culture surrounding death practices is in constant evolution and most Americans are unaware of the multitude of choices for the disposal of our body postmortem. Cremation has become a popular choice in recent decades after the Roman Catholic Church lifted its ban on cremation in 1963. According to a 2011 poll in the publication U. S. Catholic, 48% of 151 Catholics surveyed said they preferred cremation over traditional burial despite their belief that the body is needed for their eventual resurrection from the grave. Have changes in American death practices shifted due to the diffusion of practices from our diversity of cultures? Or have our practices changed due to other social factors such as economics or environmental concerns? This paper explores these questions while analyzing the technical advances made in the funeral industry, researching surveys and data on burial patterns and mortuary trends, and my field notes from several Southern California memorial parks. It is important to understand the issues and choices involved in our funerary practices as we all will complete this cycle of life at some point. American funerals have become a multi-billion-dollar industry and according to the Public Broadcasting System’s 2013 statistics, Americans spend 20.7 billion dollars a year on over 2.4 million funerals and their associated practices. My first assertion and hypothesis was that our economic downturns and recessions were the reason why more Americans are going with cremation due to cremation being half the cost of traditional burials. However, research and survey findings lend evidence to support that those individuals who choose cremation over burial are generally well-educated, from the upper class, and environmentally aware (Laderman 2003: 200). It is true that over the past few decades Americans have had to consider the ecology of death in a crowded country as well as its effects on the environment and my research indicates a growing trend in American death practices for “green” burials and “eco-friendly” burials.\n\nJasen Missailidis\n\nLiving Up the Aging Process\n\nCurrent research shows that having meaning in the later stages in life leads to living longer, happier, and healthier lives. When elderly people have things that bring meaning into their lives, a specific kind of importance is latched to them. Having meaningful characteristics among the later stages in life provides elderly people with a desire to continue performing those characteristics which leads to living longer, happier and healthier lives. Therefore, it is the purpose of this study to provide an answer as to which aspect of meaning predominantly gives elderly people the determination needed to keep living. Finding this conclusion is important because it will help the overall well-being of elderly citizens by providing them an answer as to which aspect of meaning they should strive to achieve. The steps taken in this study which helped to come up with a conclusion included; asking a sample of elderly citizens to rank the top four aspects of meaning that currently provide their lives with the determination needed to stay alive, as well as a rationale for their answers, then all answers were combined and ranked to find the top three most predominant answers throughout the participants. My findings concluded that family, friends and faith were the top three characteristics of meaning among participants. I found that family was the most important aspect among participants because it was the reason for their existence. Friends were found to be the second most popular answer because they are what keeps them socialized and as a result is their way of feeling like a part of society. My findings concluded that faith was the third most answer because it provided them with routine beliefs and practices to follow among their daily lives. Results throughout the study remained consistent and it is clear that we must hold onto things that are important to us. This study shows that in the end all that matters is the simple aspects of life because they provide a positive well-being and overall reassurance.\n\nCynthia Montoya\n\nThe Sexual Socialization of Millennials: Are We Talking About Sex?\n\nCurrent research on sex-related information available to millennials has focused primarily on the impact of socializing institutions and relationship dynamics on adolescent and adult sex practices, and the gender-biases embedded within the sexual socialization of adolescents. However, little research has been done on the various individuals, both within and outside of the nuclear family unit, and social and technological mediums through which millennials share and receive sex-related information. In the age of technological innovation, does the Internet provide millennials with an alternative means with which to access sex-related information that has otherwise been limited due to factors such as race/ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, and gender-bias? “Millennials” is loosely defined as a person born after 1980 and approaching adulthood during a time of rapid technological change and the rise of mass media. This study consists of a 25-question short-answer survey distributed to 100 college students, 64 females and 36 males, ages 18-24. While recent literature emphasizes the importance of influences from parents, siblings, peers, and cultural factors, this study compiles all of the aforementioned variables to create a preliminary order of sexual socialization, which reflects how millennials rank various influencing factors on their sexual educational and practices. Consistent with the literature, millennials appear to perceive parental influence to be a significant influencing factor on their sexual behaviors. However, millennials more commonly seek peer communication through personal or online interactions, and the overwhelming majority of millennials appear to value these peer discussions more than any other source of sexual socialization. Despite the fact that the majority of sex-related information in mass media remains gender-biased, most individuals insist that they received unbiased information. Future research should focus on peer-influenced sexual socialization and the dynamics of these relationships that may supplement the limited and biased sources of sex-related information available to today’s adolescents.\n\nKatya Murillo\n\nRefugee Camps in Jordan: A Gendered Look at the Lives of Palestinian Refugees\n\nSocially constructed gender roles generally vary from culture to culture. While many gender norms do transcend borders, the particular roles a man or a woman is accustomed to having at home might shift as he or she is forced to flee his or her home and community. Though a substantial number of families and communities who encounter forced migration seek refuge in their own country—becoming labeled internally displaced persons—a number of them may find themselves in refugee camps outside of their native land. Currently, there are an estimated five million refugees living and “looked after” in about sixty camps in the Middle East; of those five million refugees, Jordan hosts 664,000 refugees, many fleeing the Israel-Palestine conflict. In this paper, I will focus on and analyze the struggles faced by Palestinian refugees in Jordan through a gender-based lens as they transition from their homes to refugee camps. I will also examine whether the roles Palestinian women in the camps have now differ from those they had prior to residing in Jordan.\n\nYvett Navarro\n\nRole of Mutated Cardiac Ion Channels and Serotonin in SIDS and the Correlation between Ethnicities: A Meta-Analysis\n\nSudden infant death syndrome, SIDS, is defined as an unexpected death of a newborn younger than one year often due to random or inexplicable causes. Certain risk factors have been known to be associated with SIDS such as loose bedding, sleeping on the stomach and sharing a bed with an infant. Approximately six published research articles were researched that focused on the specific biological reasons for SIDS. These papers were selected based off certain criteria such as proof of data, relevance of data, time period of research, location of information studied, factors influencing results, and the overall relevance to the SIDS victims. Other criteria include causes such as mutation in the gated ion channel and abnormalities of serotonin which helps regulate sleep. Studies concluded that 20.2% of SIDS victims displayed a mutation in any of the eighteen cardiac ion channel genes. Other studies looked at the levels of serotonin, (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) and determined that lower levels were found in the case of SIDS victims. Compilation of studies also showed that black and American Indians are at a higher risk for SIDS than non-Hispanic whites, Asians and Pacific Islanders. Meta-analysis of the six articles conclude that both serotonin and ion gated channels play a role in SIDS.\n\nPhoebe Neuburger\n\nImmigrating to The U.S. for A Better Future\n\nIn this paper, the question I ask is, “Why immigrants are leaving their home country to come to the U.S, and what they are hoping to find when they arrive here?” Immigration is currently a hot topic right now and I want to know the reasons why many immigrants are leaving. I will first give background information on immigration that includes both the definition of an immigrant and refugee. An immigrant differs from a refugee because an immigrant chooses to resettle to another country, while a refugee is forced to and has no other choice but to leave his or her country. I will focus on two specific cases: Mexico and El Salvador. Both have similar issues and problems, e.g. drug violence, gangs that forced many people to leave. By comparing these two countries, I will better understand what was going on from1970 to the present. I will then focus on my personal story, as well as conversations I had with two adults from the Whittier Adults School; one was from Mexico and the other was from El Salvador. Literature shows that many immigrants come to the U.S. to become a citizen, and to be able to send money home to their families. Others come in the hope of better job opportunities and the U.S. offers many families a better life than in their native land. Living in the U.S. offers a better education for children, and a stable government. To support my research, I will be starting off with the general information about the history of immigration, I will then focus on specific individual stories such as my own reason for immigrating to the U.S. and conversations with two adults from Mexico and El Salvador to support my thesis. I will be using online articles and books to support my project. My preliminary findings are that many immigrants left El Salvador due to economic hardship and political instability, repression, and violence due to the Civil War. Immigrants from Mexico fled to the U.S. due to the labor demands in the U.S. and political unrest in Mexico. I also found that after the Great Recession hit the U.S. many Mexicans are now leaving and coming back to Mexico.\n\nMarissa Ochoa\n\nA Comparison of Southern California’s Arroyo and Red Willows to South Africa’s Cape Silver Willow Under Drought Conditions\n\nIn both the Northern and Southern hemisphere, Mediterranean climates are equally affected by intense drought conditions. Drought sensitivity is one of many major factors that regulate distribution of willow species in riparian communities. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of severe drought on dominant willows in riparian communities in the Angeles National Forest of Southern California and Dwarsberg Trout Haven of South Africa. The species studied were Arroyo Willow and Red Willow, in Southern California, and Cape Silver Willow, in South Africa. Vulnerability curves were used to estimate P50 values and pre-dawn and midday xylem water potentials were measured at both sites. Curves are indicators of drought sensitivity and water potentials measure water-stress conditions. P50 values for Arroyo and Red willows averaged -3.0 and -3.5 MPa while Cape Willows averaged -3.7 MPa. Midday water potentials in the Southern California ranged from -2.4 – -2.7 MPa, while South African willows ranged from -1.5 – -2.3 MPa. Preliminary data on stomatal conductance, which measures rates of gas exchange, and leaf weights have been taken in South Africa while additional analysis is underway in Southern California.\n\nAnthony Osherow\n\nThe Gendered Life of Women in the Soviet Union during World War II\n\nUnlike most Western societies during World War II, the women of the U.S.S.R. played very active roles as combatants, after initially playing stereotypical roles as women. This paper will not only analyze the active roles they played as combatants, but the author will also look at their critical roles in societal development as women who kept the war machine going at home by looking at the pre-war and post-war contexts, as well as the contexts of the war itself. State propaganda drew women into the war, initially to keep Soviet society going and then eventually to defend their country as more soldiers were needed due to heavy losses against Nazi Germany. By drawing on various literature reviews, including academic journals and historical books, the author will reveal the gendered aspects of the war as a continuum in both Soviet society and in combat, despite Soviet policies that allow "
