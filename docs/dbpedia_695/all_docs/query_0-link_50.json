        "text": "AMERICAN INDIAN STUDIES 1120.101\n\nScience Meets Spirit: Indigenous Knowledge Systems and Natural Resource Management\n\nNative peoples across the Western hemisphere use knowledge systems that diﬀer fundamentally from those of Western science. Using traditional oral as well as written texts and contemporary writings by Native and non-Native scholars, we will examine the tensions and complementarities of these two knowledge systems. Using Iroquois knowledge systems in the northeast as a focal point, we will examine how they conceptualized their ecosystem and used it for agriculture, comparing it to resource management based on Western science. We will also explore how contemporary indigenous communities negotiate with non-Indian scientists, policy- makers, and legislators across boundaries that reﬂect very diﬀerent ways of knowing. Through reading and writing activities, students will critically examine these issues and deﬁne their own views on what constitutes knowledge.\n\nTR 08:40–09:55 a.m. Jane Mt.Pleasant 28500\n\nAMERICAN STUDIES 1140.101\n\nCommon Ground: Education Beyond the Ivory Tower\n\nEarn course credit while learning about and working within the Ithaca community. This course on educational practices in the US combines academics with outreach and oﬀers a unique opportunity for students who desire to be active in tutoring or mentoring in our community to enhance that practice through critical engagement with texts relevant to their experience. Participate in discussions about readings focused on ideologies and practices that have created the current state of education in the US (e.g., Jeﬀerson, Baldwin, Barber, Trask, Leguin, Kozol, Reich). Write essays that explore class, gender, and ethnic diversity and how those components become implicated in how our schools carry out the mission of providing free and public education locally and nationally.\n\nTR 01:25–02:40 p.m. x-listed w/ Writ 1400 and Engl 1140 28701\n\nThe Public Service Center is available to arrange a mentoring partnership with interested students not already active in such a program. Contact Amy Somchanhmavong ayk3@cornell.edu\n\nANTHROPOLOGY 1123.101\n\nMedia Matters\n\nThis course introduces students to the anthropology of media—expanding upon conceptions of the media as detached images—to understand the social relations and cultural processes that accompany production, the representation itself, and audience reception. We will examine concepts of nationalism, transnationalism, and race by drawing from research mainly in the areas of social theory and anthropology, including Benedict Anderson and Arjun Appadurai. We will also explore the ways in which advertising, journalism, television, cinema, and new media are embedded within complex social relationships and historical trajectories. Readings and ﬁlms take us from India to the Americas, leading us back to the profoundly interconnected world through media. The writing assignments will require students to clarify, build on, and redeﬁne class discussions and readings.\n\nMW 08:40–09:55 a.m. Reighan Gillam 28428 Hiro Miyazaki\n\nANTHROPOLOGY 1124.101\n\nThe Pop Psyche\n\nIn the last scene of HBO’s Sex and the City, Carrie Bradshaw relates that “the most challenging, exciting, and signiﬁcant relationship of all, is the one you have with yourself.” Indeed. Within the self, Freud discovered the Id (site of basic drives), the Ego (site of rational activity), and the Super-Ego (site of moral imperatives). Interestingly, the main characters of not only Sex and the City but also South Park embody precisely these three structural positions. In this course, we will consider these protagonists not as interacting individuals, but as constituent components of an individual. In short, we will put the pop psyche on Freud’s couch and see what we can learn about ourselves in the process. The writing assignments will require students to clarify, build on, and redeﬁne class discussions and readings.\n\nTR 08:40–09:55 a.m. Timothy Haupt 28429 Hiro Miyazaki\n\nANTHROPOLOGY 1126.101\n\nScience, Religion, and the Body: Anthropological Appproaches\n\nThis course seeks to explore the spaces generated by scientiﬁc and religious ideas and practices as they shape and are shaped by the human body. While anthropologists believe that the body is “good to think with,” we will push our bodies (and minds) one step further to traverse the intersections, overlaps, and frictions emerging with twenty-ﬁrst–century science. We will consider the ways in which questions of science and religion have come to be mediated through the body by the state and larger global contexts. We will also investigate how persuasion is built into religious and scientiﬁc texts and learn to write persuasively ourselves. Through the shared processes of reading and writing, we will consider recent scientiﬁc scandals and develop an analysis from multiple perspectives.\n\nTR 08:40–09:55 a.m. Marcie Middlebrooks 28430 Hiro Miyazaki\n\nANTHROPOLOGY 1127.101\n\nTransnational Interruptions\n\nTransnationalism: for a global society, it’s a signiﬁcant term indicating the ﬂows of people, ideas, and goods between and across regions. The question for us, then, is: How does transnationalism disrupt reiﬁed cultural categories and complicate analytical boundaries? In addition to reading assigned texts from ethnic and area studies such as Ronald Takaki’s Strangers from a Distant Shore, Paul Gilroy’s Black Atlantic, and Benedict Anderson’s Spectre of Comparisons, students will examine newspapers and articles to identify and share with the class contemporary examples of transnationalism. Discussion will focus on how to destabilize and question disciplinary analytical categories in order to understand the assumptions and contexts behind their construction. In essay assignments, students will apply and expand on theoretical concepts of the course as they relate to current events and to issues of speciﬁc interest. Students may also choose to participate in service learning opportunities such as volunteer work with transnational migrant workers, sharing their experiences in discussion and writing.\n\nMWF 12:20–01:10 p.m. Ivan Small 28431 Hiro Miyazaki\n\nANTHROPOLOGY 1128.101\n\nCigarette Cultures\n\nThis course considers how a range of communities are constituted in relation to the cigarette industry. We will examine how actors such as smokers, anti-tobacco advocates, health oﬃcials, contract tobacco farmers, and industry executives deﬁne themselves and are deﬁned by others. What structural politics underpin the knowledge and practices of these groups? How do assumptions about age, gender, class, race, and ethnicity ﬁgure into the constitution of diﬀerent actors and corporate strategies? In addressing these questions, we will consider debates over the moral, aesthetic, economic, spatial, and bodily dimensions of cigarette production and consumption. In addition to scholarly books and articles, we will analyze and write about a range of popular texts from corporate websites to public health materials, movies, photographs, advertisements, and museums.\n\nMWF 09:05–09:55 a.m. Marina Welker 28432\n\nANTHROPOLOGY 1130.101\n\nAnthropology and the Research University: Ethnography, Critique, and Reform\n\nResearch universities are global sites of knowledge creation, preservation, and transmission. Promoting social mobility, conserving the past, and creating some of the future, universities have become complex service organizations that harbor a bewildering array of levels, units, missions, and constituencies. Handling this increasing complexity while creating active learning environments, serving society, and balancing budgets challenges everyone involved. Universities are rarely studied as organizations and cultural systems by the “inhabitants” who know the institution best. In this seminar, we will collaborate in learning how to study complex organizations like Cornell by developing critical ethnographic and analytical skills needed to describe, understand, and write about the university and to participate more eﬀectively in shaping its future.\n\nTR 02:55–04:10 p.m. Davydd Greenwood 28439\n\nANTHROPOLOGY 1132.101\n\nImaginary Landscapes: People and the Sense of Place\n\nBoth anthropological and archaeological studies have demonstrated that humans have a powerful “sense of place” that can inﬂuence the ways that we perceive the world and create our cultures. In this course, students will be invited to explore their own “sense of place” in relation to the University, the city of Ithaca, and their wider cultural background. The course will include concepts of exoticism, spatial mnemonics, and the use of the landscape in the construction of culture through readings from Richard Louv’s The Last Child in the Woods and Keith Basso’s Wisdom Sits in Places. In addition, students will study value-laden maps and work on creating such maps of their own immediate surroundings. Writing assignments will include responses to readings, personal narratives, and journals.\n\nMWF 01:25–02:15 p.m. Maureen Costura 28661 Hiro Miyazaki\n\nANTHROPOLOGY 1172.101\n\nThe Anthropology of Food and Cuisine\n\nYou are what you eat! This course examines the way food is produced, prepared, exchanged, presented, and given meaning in cultures around the world. It will examine the symbolism of speciﬁc foodstuﬀs; who prepares food and how it is done; who feeds whom and how these relations are expressed and valued; ideas about commensality; how food is used in public contexts for presentation or exchange; and how food is a marker of gender, class, status, ethnicity, and identity. In addition to looking speciﬁcally at food, we will analyze cultural ideas about gender, the body, and identity in terms of how these cultural patterns are produced and expressed through concrete activities such as eating, fasting, and special diets.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Jane Fajans 28440\n\nARCHAEOLOGY 1132.101\n\nImaginary Landscapes: People and the Sense of Place\n\nBoth anthropological and archaeological studies have demonstrated that humans have a powerful “sense of place” that can inﬂuence the ways that we perceive the world and create our cultures. In this course, students will be invited to explore their own “sense of place” in relation to the University, the city of Ithaca, and their wider cultural background. The course will include concepts of exoticism, spatial mnemonics, and the use of the landscape in the construction of culture through readings from Richard Louv’s The Last Child in the Woods and Keith Basso’s Wisdom Sits in Places. In addition, students will study value-laden maps and work on creating such maps of their own immediate surroundings. Writing assignments will include responses to readings, personal narratives, and journals.\n\nMWF 01:25–02:15 p.m. x-listed w. Anthr 1132 28662\n\nART HISTORY 1129.101\n\nBlasting the Machine: Questioning Technology Through Art\n\nOver the last decades, media artists and activists have adopted consumer technologies to intervene and participate in mainstream media culture. Their works are exhibited and used in virtual and public spaces such as the internet, supermarkets, health clinics, and museums. Artists create these works from the premise that technologies are not neutral: they carry assumptions about communal culture and the individual body. But we become accustomed to such technologies and their assumptions: they become a “natural” part of our social fabric. In our class, we will survey the strategies that artists and technologists use to highlight the cultural implications of “new” technologies, from the work of SubRosa to Wafaa Bilal and others. For discussion, reading, and writing, students will explore issues raised by these works, identifying critical topics for exploration from both an arts context and beyond.\n\nTR 02:55–04:10 p.m. Claudia Pederson 28433 Maria Fernandez\n\nART HISTORY 1133.101\n\nA Sea of Islands: Identity and Art in the Paciﬁc\n\nAn exciting adventure into Paciﬁc visual culture awaits you in this journey through “A Sea of Islands.” In this course, we explore the art of Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia to understand how identity is represented in art from pre-contact through globalization. The geographical scope of the course covers Samoa to Guam to Papua New Guinea. We examine a wide variety of art forms including ﬁlm, performance, body adornment, and Paciﬁc Hip Hop. Key themes include: gender and the body; diaspora and indigeneity; tradition and innovation, etc. To see art on campus, we will visit the Costume and Textile Collection, the McGraw Hall Museum, and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art. Assignments will develop critical skills in reading, thinking, and writing about art and identity.\n\nTR 02:55–04:10 p.m. Bernida Webb-Bindeer 28434 Maria Fernandez\n\nART HISTORY 1134.101\n\nPerforming Objects/Collecting Cultures\n\nThe twin phenomena of performing and collecting are as old as time, and both require an intense entanglement with words and things. This course will consider the signiﬁcance of objects and their related texts within the ﬁeld of art history and, indeed, more widely as they are “performed” and “collected” (sometimes both initiatives occurring simultaneously) in Asian Art and Culture. A series of writing assignments will build on the powerful allure of objects. Students will be encouraged to explore the politics of their ever-shifting biographies, their strategies of selection, designation, fabrication, and, when auspiciously ephemeral, their creative destruction and renewal. Various performative and collective containments will be mapped as they transcend boundaries, cultural and otherwise. Masked dances and their costume elements, clay pots, bronzes, serpentine daggers, miniature paintings and gardens, musical instruments and embroidered story cloths, shadow puppets, spices, exotic ﬂora and fauna, ﬁlm, fossils, and folktales will be fair game. Classes will be held in the Herbert F. Johnson Museum when appropriate.\n\nMW 02:55–04:10 p.m. Kaja McGowan 28441\n\nART HISTORY 1135.101\n\nRepresenting North Africa in Art: Cairo, Algiers, Tangier\n\nNorth Africa looms in American popular cultural imaginaries and representations as a space of exoticism, separate from the rules that govern “us.” How can we read these representations, and to what can we compare them? Looking to the alternative representations of three cities as case studies, we will consider particularly the representations of women in Cairo, the war for independence in Algiers, and the border in Tangier. We will consider divergent viewpoints, including ﬁlms such as Casablanca, theory by Edward Said and Frantz Fanon, literature by Nawal el Saadawi and Laila Lalami, and visual representations by artists such as Yto Barrada. Students will develop ideas on how to critically interpret representation, focusing on building arguments in writing assignments.\n\nTR 01:25–02:40 p.m. Holiday Powers 28442 Maria Fernandez\n\nASIAN STUDIES 1107.101\n\nReligion and the State in Asia and the West\n\nJeﬀerson once used the phrase “wall of separation” between church and state, imagining an ideal of secular government. Has this ideal been realized? Do other nations share this ideal? This course looks at problems generated by the entanglement of religion and the state in Asian countries while taking a comparative look at similar problems in the West. Students will be introduced to important theoretical works on secularism, as well as case studies from Asia. The course addresses writing on two levels: the use of writing as a weapon in arguing for or against religion’s involvement with the state, and the use of academic writing to elucidate an understanding of these arguments. Assignments will include role-playing exercises, including a mock debate, in addition to academic essays.\n\nMWF 09:05–09:55 a.m. Jonathan Young 28443 Anne Blackburn\n\nAFRICANA STUDIES AND RESEARCH CENTER 1811.101\n\nWomen Writing in Southern Africa\n\nIn this course, students will explore the works of Southern African women. We will read and respond in discussion and writing to testimonies, ﬁlms, stories, songs, and many other texts that represent the voices of women in Southern Africa. In our studies, we will discover what the voices of Southern African women are and how their discourse expresses experiences in the countries of South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Mozambique.\n\nTR 02:55–04:10 p.m. Sarah Mkhonza 28444\n\nAFRICANA STUDIES AND RESEARCH CENTER 1813.101\n\nPan-African Freedom Fighters In Their Own Words\n\nThis seminar will examine autobiographical writings and advocacy statements and speeches by selected freedom ﬁghters from Black America, Africa, and the Caribbean. Through written and oral communication, students will explore the ideas, values, activities, and impact of individuals such as W. E. B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, Amy Jacques Garvey, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, African American Women in the Civil Rights Movement (including Ella Baker, Septima Clark, Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Angela Davis), Nelson Mandela, African Women in the South African Anti-Apartheid Struggle (including Winnie Mandela, Ruth Mompati, Mavivi Manzini, Albertina Sisulu), and Bob Marley. Video and ﬁlm presentations will augment reading, discussion, and writing assignments.\n\nMW 02:55–04:10 p.m. Locksley Edmondson 28445\n\nAFRICANA STUDIES AND RESEARCH CENTER 1822.101\n\nThe African American Short Story\n\nAs a form and genre, the short story’s speciﬁc origins within African American literature are traceable back to the antebellum era of the nineteenth century. The foundational contributions to the development of this genre were made by both black male and female authors during the fecund Black literary renaissance of the 1850s, including The Heroic Slave (1853) by Frederick Douglass and The Two Oﬀers (1859) by Frances E. W. Harper. This course will consider the signal works by these early authors, along with selections by a range of others. Its priority and central emphasis will be the reﬁnement of writing skills through the production of a series of short essays on the short stories over the course of the semester and a longer one at the end.\n\nTR 01:25–02:40 p.m. Riche Richardson 28567\n\nAFRICANA STUDIES AND RESEARCH CENTER 1823.101\n\nJourney to Justice: African Americans and the Modern Civil Rights Movement, 1940–1980\n\nThis course will examine the African American push for civil rights. Students will gain insight into the movement as it evolved from moments of non-violent mass organizing and protests into the realm of Black Power and electoral politics. Through course readings and writing assignments, students will critically engage the following issues: tactics such as nonviolence and self-defense; the tensions between charismatic and group- centered leadership styles; the beneﬁts and liabilities of coalition politics; and the impact of gender, sexuality and class on racial goals.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Jessica Harris 28463\n\nCLASSICS 1531\n\nGreek Myth\n\nThe course will focus on the stories about the gods and heroes of the Greeks as they appear in the works of ancient Greek literature. We will read a selection from Greek authors, inquiring into the relationship between myths and cultural, religious, and political realia of the society in which they were shaped and perpetuated. Alongside the primary texts, we will read a number of recent scholarly works on the subject. We will start by discussing myths in general terms (theories, basic concepts) and will proceed toward the analysis of individual stories and cycles. This fascinating material will serve as a vehicle for improving students’ written communication skills. Assignments will include preparatory writing and six essays focusing on our readings and discussions in class.\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1108.101\n\nLanguage and Politics: The Question of the Animal\n\nBeginning by debating the question of a ﬁrm divide between humans and animals, we will consider the animal in the many diverse and problematic roles it plays as “other” to the human—as object of spectatorship, symbol or totem, scapegoat, experimental creature, object of consumption or possession, and even companion. We may begin to think about the potential of a diﬀerent kind of otherness—one that challenges our societal and personal beliefs, and one which allows us to rethink the notion of “rights,” of the “subject,” and with it, perhaps even the idea of the human itself. Fictional and critical readings from Aesop, Descartes, Swift, H. G. Wells, Kafka, Woolf, J. M. Coetzee, Barbara Gowdy, and Temple Grandin, vary widely in their audience and style. Through discussion and writing assignments, students will work with (and sometimes against) varied approaches and arguments of these authors.\n\nMWF 02:30–03:20 p.m. Allison Weiner 28532 Petrus Liu\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1109.101\n\nWriting across Cultures: Poetry’s Image\n\nWhere do we get our images of poetry, and of poets? Along with the images we ﬁnd in poems themselves, how do poetry and poets ﬁgure in ﬁction and ﬁlm, in philosophy and popular culture? How do such ﬁgures inform the images in poems, poetry’s image? In what senses is poetry a “liberal art”? What is its relation to “self,” to language, history, and politics, to other disciplines and discourses? This course will explore such issues in a wide range of short texts in both verse and prose, in ﬁction, ﬁlm, and other media. The course’s focus on “poetry image” will encourage students to make the connection between such self-reﬂexive practices in the texts they’re reading and viewing and the texts they themselves produce in their own writing. Authors that we will study include Plato, Wordsworth, Poe, Dickinson, Baudelaire, Whitman, Rimbaud, Stein, Breton, Stevens, Neruda, Borges, Wittgenstein, Celan, Rich, Brathwaite, Waldrop, Collins, Swenson, and Bolaño.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Jonathan Monroe 28534\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1109.102\n\nWriting across Cultures: Bacchannal and Bush-tea—The Culture of Caribbean Literature\n\nWhat if reggae were made literature? Carnival seen as an art exhibit? Voudou read as philosophy? The traditional divide between “high” and “low” culture becomes an especially murky matter in the Caribbean, where the highest of literary texts cannot extricate themselves from the lowly cultural expression of the folk. Caribbean writers, from Walcott to Naipaul to Conde, draw obsessively upon local music, oral culture, spirituality, and masking for both the subject and the shape of their work. The questions this raises about the form, function, and limits of textual production will inform this writing workshop, both in short responses and longer papers. Readings in cultural and literary theory will accompany careful literary analysis.\n\nTR 08:40–09:55 a.m. Kavita Singh 28535 Petrus Liu\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1109.103\n\nWriting across Cultures: Pictures of Garbage—Images of Waste in Latin American Art and Literature\n\nGarbage is the late material evidence of human interaction with nature. All humans have a meaningful relation to garbage: either they produce the commodities that will be discarded; they buy, use, and discard such commodities; or they scavenge garbage as a living. Although trash is global, the ﬂux of the transnational economy makes it more conspicuous in the third world. There are all sorts of diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the image of waste that we are familiar with: garbage on a curb has a very diﬀerent signiﬁcance than a picture of garbage hanging on a museum wall. In this writing seminar, we will explore the image of garbage in Latin America as it is constructed in the work of photographers, ﬁlmmakers, and writers such as Vik Muniz, Marcos Prado, Clarice Lispector, Caio Fernando Abreu, among others. Written responses, reports, and essays will train you to use the written word to analyze visual information.\n\nTR 11:40–12:55 p.m. Marcela Romero Rivera 28536 Petrus Liu\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1109.104\n\nWriting across Cultures: Bacchannal and Bush-tea—The Culture of Caribbean Literature\n\nWhat if reggae were made literature? Carnival seen as an art exhibit? Voudou read as philosophy? The traditional divide between “high” and “low” culture becomes an especially murky matter in the Caribbean, where the highest of literary texts cannot extricate themselves from the lowly cultural expression of the folk. Caribbean writers, from Walcott to Naipaul to Conde, draw obsessively upon local music, oral culture, spirituality, and masking for both the subject and the shape of their work. The questions this raises about the form, function, and limits of textual production will inform this writing workshop, both in short responses and longer papers. Readings in cultural and literary theory will accompany careful literary analysis.\n\nTR 02:55–04:10 p.m. Kavita Singh 28537 Petrus Liu\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1126.101\n\nComparative Arts: Blues of the Ports—Popular Music on the Fringes\n\nNew Orleans, Havana, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Seville, Piraeus—port cities have been pivotal sites of cultural exchange, often spawning controversial social identities, rituals, and musical forms. Through a combination of audio and visual media, as well as literary and academic texts, students will examine the musical and cultural life of port cities while learning the fundamentals of critical thought and prose. Surveying musics as disparate as blues and tango and authors as diverse as Claude McKay and Federico Garcia Lorca, students will glean how, on the fringes of civilization, port cities have created an atmosphere favorable for the ﬂowering of some of the world’s most captivating musical traditions.\n\nMWF 09:05–09:55 a.m. Ryan Dreher 28538 Petrus Liu\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1133.101\n\nStudies in Literary Theory: Literature and Radicality\n\nCan we understand literature as being inherently politically radical? How have literature and literary writing been marshaled not only to question political norms but to dismantle them at their foundations? What kind of agency and political impact can we attribute to literature? This course will examine a variety of diﬀerent kinds of radicality in literary form and political content. For instance, we will look at literature that challenges the social standards of its time through various kinds of perversity (Baudelaire) and sexuality (Gide’s The Immoralist), and we will look at explicit political statements (Marx’s The Communist Manifesto). To explore the inherent politically radical nature of literature, class discussions and writing assignments will focus on close reading and developing strong arguments.\n\nMWF 10:10–11:00 a.m. Tatiana Sverjensky 28669 Petrus Liu\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1133.102\n\nStudies in Literary Theory: The Power of Rhetoric and the Rhetorics of Power\n\nWhile it may seem an outdated concept, belonging to ancient times, rhetoric, as the form or manner in which we speak, is intimately bound up with everything we read, see, hear, or say—from newspapers and blogs, to TV shows and the arts. What is rhetoric? How does it work? Is there one rhetoric or many? And what is political about it? The course will follow the history of writing about rhetoric towards the modern understanding that the form of language has a determining eﬀect on its content, and that both inﬂuence the way we think and act. Reading may include excerpts from Aristotle, Plato, Augustine, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Nietzsche, and others. We will focus on close reading and methods of critical writing.\n\nMWF 11:15–12:05 p.m. Liron Mor 28670 Petrus Liu\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1133.103\n\nStudies in Literary Theory: Metaphysics, Morality, and Selfhood in the Novel\n\nHow can we know the true nature of the world? What standards, if any, guide our action? How, ﬁnally, can we know ourselves? This course will examine philosophical and literary responses to these questions; we will trace the intersections and divergences between these diﬀerent forms of thinking about truth, knowledge, freedom, and personal identity. We will also aim to understand and develop argumentative rigor and stylistic sophistication in writing. Readings may include selections from writers such as Rene Descartes, David Hume, James Joyce, Immanuel Kant, Plato, Thomas Pynchon, and Virginia Woolf.\n\nMW 02:55–04:10 p.m. Aaron Hodges 28671 Petrus Liu\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1133.104\n\nStudies in Literary Theory: Touching Literature\n\nWe often say that we have been “touched” by literature. At times, we even demand that we be “touched” by literature. We, however, often take for granted this notion of touch. We do not question how literature touches us speciﬁcally, if not empirically. We do not know if literature touches us the same way as we touch another living being. This course addresses these gaps in our understanding of touch in relation to literature. Through readings of texts literary (Schlink’s The Reader, Lispector’s Passion according to G. H.) and theoretical (Cixous, Nancy), and through writing assignments (concept papers, creative writing exercises, and so on), we will seek to construct a critical grasp of touch in literature, and question how it can transform the way we touch (others) in the real world.\n\nMWF 08:00–08:50 a.m. Irving Goh 28672 Petrus Liu\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1133.105\n\nStudies in Literary Theory: Cyborg Selves\n\nAre we becoming cyborgs? Does it matter? What does the increasingly blurry line between “human” and “technology” mean for our experience of identity and memory (both individual and shared), of freedom, consumption, agency, love, desire—in short, for all the things that tell us who we are in the world we inhabit? Students in this class will examine historical and contemporary examples of cyborgs in literature, ﬁlm, popular culture, media, and visual art. We’ll read and discuss scholarly writings on cyborgs as well, and work throughout the semester to produce a portfolio of ﬁnely crafted, polished essays that address two major questions: How has the not-quite-human ﬁgure of the cyborg marked a changing sense of the human condition? And what can it tell us about what it means to be human now, in an age of advanced technology?\n\nMW 08:40–09:55 a.m. Madeleine Casad 28673 Petrus Liu\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE 1133.106\n\nStudies in Literary Theory: How To Become A Woman—Literature and a Girl’s Coming of Age\n\nWhat does it mean in literature to become a woman? How does one leave girlhood behind? And why should we care what literature has to say about it anyway? Through readings of such works as Carson McCullers’s The Member of the Wedding and Marguerite Duras’s The Lover, we will analyze literature’s ﬁgurations of a feminine coming of age. At the same time, we will engage with such thinkers as Sigmund Freud, Simone de Beauvoir, and Judith Butler to see how becoming a woman is conceived in theoretical texts. Writing assignments will engage students in a dialog between theoretical and literary texts in order to discover how literature complicates theory and how it formulates the problem diﬀerently.\n\nMW 07:30–08:45 p.m. Carissa Sims 28674 Petrus Liu\n\nCITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING 1109.101\n\nImage(s) of the City\n\nThis class will use a variety of media, including historic insurance maps, aerial photographs, zoning and land use maps, bird’s eye views, images from current and historical newspapers, and other sources to explore the diﬀerent points of view or biases that shape these depictions of “reality” in the city. It will also explore how these images have inﬂuenced generations of policy decisions, and the lives of those who call the city home. Readings will range from historical works by Jacob Riis and nineteenth-century civic-boosters to modern pieces by Kenneth Jackson, John Reps, Richard Schein, and others. Students will be asked to prepare written responses to both the images of the city presented in class, and to the analysis or descriptions provided in the readings.\n\nMW 02:55–04:10 p.m. Douglas Appler 28449 John Forester\n\nCITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING 1109.102\n\nSocial Movements and Collective Action in the Age of Globalization\n\nGlobalization processes have had profound economic, social, and cultural consequences on the peoples of both developed and developing countries. The last decade has been marked by what the media has referred to as a rising tide of “anti-globalization protests.” Who are these protestors and what are they protesting against? In this course, we will examine social movement responses to globalization processes. In particular, we will explore how movements channel grievances into collective action by focusing on neighborhood, women’s, indigenous, and environmental groups. We will also investigate how social movements have scaled up mobilization to the global level, and assess whether movements have taken advantage of the opportunities created by globalization. Students will reﬂect on these issues in short response papers and critical essays.\n\nTR 08:40–09:55 a.m. Abdulrazack Karriem 28448\n\nDEVELOPMENT SOCIOLOGY 1200.101\n\nHaving a Lot on Our Plates: An Introduction to the Sociology of Food\n\nAs our food system becomes increasingly globalized, many Americans are becoming concerned about the disconnect we have between our food and where it comes from. In this course, we discuss, read, and write about sociological perspectives on how our food is produced, how it gets to us, and what the implications of these processes are for producers, consumers, and the environment. In a sequence of writing assignments, students will choose a food item to trace through the global processes that carry it from “farm to fork.” Additional writing assignments will draw on our exposure to local perspectives through guest speakers and ﬁeld trips to places such as the Ithaca Farmers’ Market and Cornell’s student-run organic farm, Dilmun Hill.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Andrea Woodward 28458 Chuck Geisler\n\nDEVELOPMENT SOCIOLOGY 1202.101\n\nInternational Conservation: People and the Protection of Biodiversity\n\nDo people need biodiversity? If so, how do we preserve it? And who pays when we protect natural areas? This course uses a sociological lens to examine the construction of the biodiversity concept, how the human-nature relationship has changed throughout history, and the underlying political perspectives that support various positions on conservation. We will also address contemporary debates on conservation strategiesusing case studies to evaluate the eﬃcacy of these competing approaches. Readings will be drawn from social and biological science journals, NGO publications, oﬃcial documents, and popular environmental literature. Students will improve writing skills through writing in various genres including: rhetorical analysis, exposition, persuasion, and an argumentative research paper.\n\nMW 02:55–04:10 p.m. Kayte Meola 28459 Chuck Geisler\n\nDEVELOPMENT SOCIOLOGY 1203.101\n\nMedicine, Technology, and Control Over Women’s Bodies\n\nSexuality, contraception, pregnancy, birth: all of these aspects of women’s health are increasingly subject to scientiﬁc and medical knowledge. The shift in expertise about bodies and birth from mothers (and other women) to doctors (and other experts) is accompanied by a shift in power over women’s bodies and their babies. Who beneﬁts and who is burdened by this shift? In this class, we will discuss, read and write about how the extension of medical knowledge to women’s bodies and health both empowers and disempowers women and families. We will engage in a variety of academic and popular resources, and assignments will allow students to practice many diﬀerent writing styles. Students will also have the opportunity to undertake their own original research.\n\nMWF 01:25–02:15 p.m. Marygold Walsh-Dilley 28460 Chuck Geisler\n\nEARTH AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES 1420.101\n\nSustainable Earth, Energy, and Environmental Systems\n\nDeveloping a sustainable society while confronting global change is one of the leading challenges facing our planet during the 21st century. Solving the problem of energy is fundamentally interwoven with the risks\n\nto climate and challenges for food, water, and sustainable ecosystems on land and sea. This course will explore those connections and the inherent environmental tradeoﬀs. The Sustainable Earth, Energy, and Environmental Systems speaker series will address these topics and their societal connection. Knowledge and critical thinking skills will be developed through reading scientiﬁc and popular literature, discussions, writing, and peer review. Writing assignments will provide the students with the foundation for developing the written communication skills of substance, structure, and style intended for both scientiﬁc and public audiences.\n\nMWF 08:00–08:50 a.m. Louise McGarry 28119 Charles Greene\n\nStudents are required to attend the Sustainable Earth, Energy, and Environmental Systems speaker series on Mondays 7:30-8:45 p.m. Please choose another writing seminar if your schedule conﬂicts with the speaker series sessions.\n\nEARTH AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES 1420.102\n\nSustainable Earth, Energy, and Environmental Systems\n\nOur planet currently faces no greater challenge than developing a sustainable society while confronting global climate change. This course explores the connections between energy and sustainability—including challenges for food, water, energy, and threats to sustainable ecosystems—as well as the importance of conveying these challenges beyond the bounds of the scientiﬁc community. Knowledge and critical thinking skills will be developed through reading scientiﬁc and popular literature, discussions, writing, and peer review. Assignments will provide a foundation for eﬀective written communication skills for a wide spectrum of audiences.\n\nMWF 01:25–02:15 p.m. Amanda Baker 28120 Charles Greene\n\nStudents are required to attend the Sustainable Earth, Energy, and Environmental Systems speaker series on Mondays 7:30-8:45 p.m. Please choose another writing seminar if your schedule conﬂicts with the speaker series sessions.\n\nEARTH AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES 1420.103\n\nSustainable Earth, Energy, and Environmental Systems\n\nThere is an urgent need to develop sustainable solutions to combat climate change and the widespread degradation of ecosystems. In this course, students will study the science that governs environmental challenges related to energy, and explore the impact of various energy technologies on the environment. Students will develop knowledge and critical-thinking skills through reading scientiﬁc and popular literature, watching videos, discussions, writing, and peer review. Assignments will help students develop skills needed to write with substance, structure, and style appropriate for a variety of audiences.\n\nTR 02:55–04:10 p.m. Deborah Sills 28121 Charles Greene\n\nStudents are required to attend the Sustainable Earth, Energy, and Environmental Systems speaker series on Mondays 7:30-8:45 p.m. Please choose another writing seminar if your schedule conﬂicts with the speaker series sessions.\n\nECONOMICS 1106.101\n\nClimate Change, Economics, and Ethics\n\nThe debate over what action should be taken in response to the threat of climate change is plagued with extreme opinions. In order to arrive at a balanced perspective, this course will introduce core economic concepts and apply them to the monumental issue of climate change. We will examine the economic explanation for how the problem arose and the types of solutions that economics oﬀers. Of course, economics is not the whole story. Because of the social ramiﬁcations of climate change and international disparities in greenhouse gas emissions, the debate is deeply intertwined with issues of ethics and equity and we will incorporate moral responsibility into our framework. Writing assignments will range from personal responses to critiques to formal, thesis- driven, persuasive essays.\n\nTR 08:40–09:55 a.m. Corey Lang 28462 Chris Barrett\n\nENGLISH 1105.101\n\nWriting and Sexual Politics: Lesbians, Transmen, and Bears, Oh My! Masculinities in the Margins\n\nCommon sense—or at least Spike TV—would suggest that masculinity is “naturally” the purview of heterosexual men. But is masculinity really more “proper” to some bodies than it is to others? How do butch subjects relate to one another, and to their own masculinity? Indeed, is it even possible to recognize the category “masculinity” across diﬀerent time periods and cultures? In this course, we will read, discuss, and write about “masculinity” as it is performed and inscribed in the literal and ﬁgurative “margins” of social intelligibility—by subjects whose articulations of masculinity are marked as troubling, irrelevant, or seemingly counterintuitive. Course texts may include Woolf’s Orlando, Armory’s Song of the Loon, Bechdel’s Fun Home, and theoretical selections from Halberstam, Rubin, Hennen, Sedgwick, and Wright.\n\nMWF 09:05–09:55 a.m. Kaelin Alexander 28577 Mary McCullough\n\nENGLISH 1105.102\n\nWriting and Sexual Politics: All the Single Ladies\n\nFrom sad spinsters to glamorous bachelorettes, single women in literature and ﬁlm long for a diﬀerent life with “Mr. Right” by their side. Or do they? This course is concerned with the often reviled but always riveting ﬁgure of the single woman and with her ﬁctional adventures and metamorphoses. The fascination with unmarried women has given us captivating tales of horror, puzzling stories of renunciation, and inspiring coming-of-age narratives. We will consider contemporary images of single women and their 19th- and 20th-century forerunners (from Emily Dickinson to Lily Bart) and look closely at conceptions of gender equality, romantic love, and personal freedom as well as the clichés and conventions that shape them. Writing assignments will include short responses and multi-draft essays.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Kamila Janiszewska 28578 Mary McCullough\n\nENGLISH 1105.103\n\nWriting and Sexual Politics: Sexual Relations of Early American Literature\n\nSex and sexuality weren’t a deﬁning feature of American culture until the 1960s, right? Wrong. In fact, as this course explores, that wouldn’t be true even if we said before the 1860s. In this course, we’ll read, discuss, and write about seduction, queerness, same-sex desire, transgender performance, androgyny, child sexuality, pregnancy, interracial relationships, singleness, polyamory, voyeurism, pornography, prostitution, consent, rape, pleasure, punishment, and more. We’ll encounter these topics in texts from mostly colonial and pre-Civil War America by familiar writers like Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and by writers whose work was well-known in its day: Hannah Foster, Julia Ward Howe, Harriet Jacobs, Horatio Alger, and others. Written work will be both formal and informal, practiced on paper and online.\n\nMW 08:40–09:55 a.m. Jonathon Senchyne 28579 Mary McCullough\n\nENGLISH 1105.104\n\nWriting and Sexual Politics: Queer Pleasures/Queer Pains\n\nWhy do we tend to favor texts about queer suﬀering over those that emphasize delight? And why, for example, do we celebrate ﬁlms about the death or oppression of these individuals, like Academy Award winners Philadelphia and Milk, even as we ignore those that imagine new forms of love and desire, such as the critically neglected Shortbus? In considering such questions, this course will pair works that take up problems of distress or misery with those that seem to embrace enjoyment and release, including works by Oscar Wilde, Gertrude Stein, and Alison Bechdel, and movies by ﬁlmmakers such as Derek Jarman and John Cameron Mitchell. We will write essays about both these larger issues and more local questions of pleasure and pain in individual texts.\n\nTR 11:40–12:55 p.m. Jacob Brogan 28583 Mary McCullough\n\nENGLISH 1105.105\n\nWriting and Sexual Politics: Prostitutes, Punishments, and Pleasures in Early American Literature\n\nSex and violence: most people secretly, or not so secretly, love and fear both. This course investigates sex and violence in early American literature, from the Puritans to the 1918 text Autobiography of an Androgyne. We will deﬁne “sex” and “violence” loosely, and our readings will challenge and enrich your own deﬁnitions. We will investigate topics such as gender, desire, friendship, and the nation. We will read authors like Whitman and Hawthorne, as well as lesser known texts. You will also read materials in Cornell’s Gender and Sexuality archive. Our writing assignments will address both contemporary and early American experiences, and you will write a series of shorter papers ending in a ﬁnal research project.\n\nTR 01:25–02:40 p.m. Brant Torres 28584 Mary McCullough\n\nENGLISH 1105.106\n\nWriting and Sexual Politics: Libertine London—Sex, Scandal, and the City\n\nFrom the creation of the closet to the invention of the coﬀee house, urbanization has shaped our cultural presumptions about sex and sexuality. The modern city formed itself around a carving up of spaces, one that highlighted the divisions between public and private places. Using London as its main paradigm, this course will examine the eﬀects that such city spaces, houses, and layouts had on modern concepts of sexuality. Subtopics include: the country versus the city, the ﬁgures of the libertine, the prostitute, and the homosexual, cities and the marriage market, secrecy and satire, politics and pornography. A series of critical writing assignments will explore a variety of literary genres along with museum visits and ﬁlm screenings. Authors may include Rochester, Swift, and Pope.\n\nTR 02:55–04:10 p.m. Sarah Eron 28585 Mary McCullough\n\nENGLISH 1111.101\n\nWriting across Cultures: Literature of Witness—Writing about Extreme Experience\n\nWhen one survives a cataclysmic event--such as a hurricane or an era of political oppression--there is something inside us that bids us to write. We feel the need to oﬀer our testimony of atrocity, hardship, and disaster. In this course we will examine the relationship of literature to traumatic experience, testing the boundaries of memoir, warning, and elegy. We will read works by poets and writers, such as Paul Celan, Loung Ung, Katie Ford, and Junot Diaz, who have lived through genocide, natural disaster, and political tragedy, and come to terms with the imperative for writers to act as witness. Using such texts as catalyst, we will explore ways in which we too may bear witness by writing critical and personal essays.\n\nMW 02:55–04:10 p.m. Christopher Lirette 28592 Margo Crawford\n\nENGLISH 1111.102\n\nWriting across Cultures: The Special (Un)Dead—Saints and Vampires\n\nIn this course, through examination of texts that center separately on vampires and saints, we will discuss and investigate saints and vampires as both cultural constructions and constructors of cultures. The emphasis will always be on reading one through the other, through such texts as The Golden Legend, Twilight, and True Blood. Various writing exercises will continue this focus on otherworldly creatures who maintain their existence in part through a special relationship to blood. The choice of vampires and saints will also give us a chance to trouble the distinction between medieval and modern, as we navigate the boundaries between the supernatural and natural. In discussion and writing, we’ll ask how vampires and saints say something similar about the cultures they represent and create.\n\nTR 08:40–09:55 a.m. William Rogers 28593 Margo Crawford\n\nENGLISH 1111.103\n\nWriting across Cultures: “A Life Exposed”—Public and Private America\n\nToday, the public assails the private from all sides. Forms of communication, confession, surveillance, social networking, blogs, tabloids, Twitter, encourage a relentless “publication” of our private lives, blurring boundaries between public and private, radically altering our self-understandings. Yet the tension between the public and private is not a new topic in American life. This course will go back to the beginnings of American cultural history to investigate how that tension has shaped conceptions of religious belief, domestic life and public culture, intimacy, the body, political resistance, cultivating and revealing a “self.” Possible readings include selections from the poetry of Bradstreet, Dickinson, or Whitman, Emerson’s Self-Reliance, ﬁction from Poe’s Man of the Crowd to Delillo’s Mao II, ﬁlms, reality TV, new media, and excerpts from the work of public intellectuals.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Michael Jonik 28599\n\nENGLISH 1111.104\n\nWriting across Cultures: ”The Things I Have Seen”—Literature and Human Rights\n\nIs it possible to share the suﬀering of others? In this course, we will look at literature as an ethical project, one that raises enduring questions about humanity, the relation of the self to the other, and the possibility of human understanding across cultural, racial, and national boundaries. We will consider how reading and interpretation help us develop empathy and understanding of situations that may be separated from us in time and experience such as slavery, the Holocaust, homophobia, and the phenomenon of child soldiers. Readings may include Satrapi’s Persepolis, Primo Levi’s Survival in Auschwitz, and Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. The diversity of our texts will allow for a cross-cultural inquiry. Assignments will include free-writes and six critical essays.\n\nTR 11:40–12:55 p.m. Elizabeth Tshele 28600 Margo Crawford\n\nENGLISH 1111.105\n\nWriting across Cultures: Vulnerable Masculinities—Stories of Instability and Change\n\nIn discussing masculinity in contemporary literature, the word “vulnerability” often arises. In this course, we will examine how and why this concept has captured our attention and will ask, above all, what does vulnerability do, and can masculinities be (socially, ethnically, and culturally) diﬀerent? We will explore these questions through James Baldwin’s If Beale Street Could Talk, Leslie Marmon Silko’s Ceremony, and Cherrie Moraga’s Shadow of a Man, among other texts, interpreting these works in light of feminist, queer and cultural critiques of male authority and power. In the end we will ask: does vulnerability transform power relations between genders and sexualities or does it simply “re-inscribe” male power? Through our writing, we will emphasize peer-review, self-revision, writing in stages, and voice and argument development.\n\nTR 11:40–12:55 p.m. Orlando Lara 28601 Margo Crawford\n\nENGLISH 1111.106\n\nWriting across Cultures: Natives and Strangers\n\nBelonging and not belonging. Inclusion and exclusion. Familiarity and estrangement. How does the US order its social relations? How does a society construct and enforce social, political, psychological, and economic boundaries? How do these boundaries operate in daily life? How does our society determine who is a “native” and who is a “stranger”? What are some of the ways through which people are included and excluded (for example, by way of race, gender, class, sexual or religious orientation, or able-bodiedness)? How are people’s lives aﬀected by such determinations? We’ll be reading a number of twentieth-century American authors who grapple with these issues in their writing (including, possibly, Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, Saul Bellow, Lois-Ann Yamanaka, and Gwendolyn Brooks).\n\nTR 11:40–12:55 p.m. Shelley Wong 28602\n\nENGLISH 1111.107\n\nWriting across Cultures: The Culture of the Raj\n\nJudging from the recent spate of popular novels and movies dealing with the British rule in India, the “Raj” was a time of pageantry and color, adventure and romance. But to what extent is this image historically accurate? How did people live their lives, and how did the colonial rule aﬀect not only Indian society and culture but also contemporary Britain? The Raj did invent many of the modern forms of spectacle and public ceremonial display, but is there anything else that survives to the present day? What do we know about “race” and nationalism, for instance, or literature and imperial ideology, and the various “cultural” ways we understand ourselves—then as much as now? Readings will draw on both literary and historical texts, and include some current ﬁlms and popular ﬁction.\n\nTR 01:25–02:40 p.m. Satya Mohanty 28603\n\nENGLISH 1111.108\n\nWriting across Cultures: Englishmen Abroad\n\nIn this course, we will read works of ﬁction featuring Englishmen (and sometimes Irishmen) engaged in overseas travel. Travel and geographical discovery have haunted the European imagination at least since the Renaissance, and travel narratives have had a signiﬁcant impact on British history and literature. We shall explore classics like Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe as well as 20th-century novels like A Passage to India and The English Patient. Occasionally, we will also look at essays, short stories, and poems. Through the writing assignments, we will try to answer some of the numerous questions these texts trigger: How does one cope with the fact of being a stranger in a foreign land? How do phenomena like colonialism and war aﬀect travel? Why do people travel at all?\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Nandini Ramesh Sankar 28604 Margo Crawford\n\nENGLISH 1111.109\n\nWriting across Cultures: Bodies, Households, and Nations—Six Plays\n\nHow do play scripts use “the body” to compel audiences and readers to confront unspeakable desires, and where do we perform these secret longings? Using techniques and strategies associated with both “literary” and “theatrical” perspectives, we will confront these questions in a variety of dramatic works, ranging from Shakespeare’s Othello and Beckett’s Happy Days to Zora Neale Hurston’s early one-act, Color Struck, and Djuna Barnes’s surrealist play, The Dove. Becoming more adventurous and robust readers is one of the goals of this course, as well as learning how our responses to representations of “dangerous desire” can provide us with models for igniting our own prose.\n\nTR 08:40–09:55 a.m. Catherine Burroughs 28605\n\nENGLISH 1127\n\nShakespeare from Stage to Screen\n\nFor four hundred years, Shakespeare has been responsible for more smash hits than any other other dramatist or screenwriter. He is the most quoted poet in the English language, and his dramatic works are the most frequently enacted and ﬁlmed. What accounts for this enduring popularity? What about the plays has made them at once so permanent and so adaptable? This class will give students the opportunity to work very closely with just a few of Shakespeare’s plays: a total of four or ﬁve over the course of the semester. We will look to the playtexts themselves as inspiration for the extensive writing we will do over the course of the semester. But we will also consult ﬁlm clips and performances to focus on these plays as works produced by and for a public theater.\n\nENGLISH 1134\n\nMemoir and Memory\n\nIn this course, we will examine how authors construct their public, written selves. Since the self is, at best, a diﬃcult and multi-faceted concept, we will consider a variety of texts in our endeavor to understand an author’s choices of literary techniques in his or her narration of the remembered, created self. We will read book-length memoirs such as Jamaica Kincaid’s My Brother, Tobias Wolﬀ’s This Boy’s Life and Sandra Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street, and we will explore other texts such as reﬂective essays, poems, or visual renderings (e.g. Spiegelman’s Maus). Together we will investigate writers’ methods of self-exploration and presentation, and through reading and the frequent writing of essays we will explore how and why people write about themselves, always asking, “How does writing shape lived experience?”\n\nENGLISH 1140.101\n\nCommon Ground: Education Beyond the Ivory Tower\n\nEarn course credit while learning about and working within the Ithaca community. This course on educational practices in the US combines academics with outreach and oﬀers a unique opportunity for students who desire to be active in tutoring or mentoring in our community to enhance that practice through critical engagement with texts relevant to their experience. Participate in discussions about readings focused on ideologies and practices that have created the current state of education in the US (e.g., Jeﬀerson, Baldwin, Barber, Trask, Leguin, Kozol, Reich). Write essays that explore class, gender, and ethnic diversity and how those components become implicated in how our schools carry out the mission of providing free and public education locally and nationally.\n\nTR 01:25–02:40 p.m. x-listed w/ Writ 1400 and AMST 1140 28569\n\nThe Public Service Center is available to arrange a mentoring partnership with interested students not already active in such a program. Contact Amy Somchanhmavong ayk3@cornell.edu\n\nENGLISH 1147\n\nThe Mystery in the Story\n\nWhat makes a story, and what makes it a mystery story? In this course, we’ll study and write about the nature of narratives, taking the classic mystery tale written by such writers as Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, and Raymond Chandler as typical of intricately plotted stories of suspense and disclosure that have been written and ﬁlmed in many genres: Greek tragedy, horror tales by Poe and Shirley Jackson, psychological thrillers by Ruth Rendell and Patricia Highsmith, neo-noir ﬁlms such as Memento and Fight Club, and postmodern mystery parodies such as those of Paul Auster and Jorge Luis Borges. We’ll look at the way they hold together, the desire and fear that drive them, and the secrets they tell—or try to keep hidden.\n\nENGLISH 1158.101\n\nAmerican Voices: Imagining Cities—The Big Apple, The City of Angels, and Other Dystopias\n\nIn much ﬁction, cities take on a life of their own, becoming the leading character—especially the (in)famous cities of Los Angeles and New York. This class will analyze the uses of urban geography to construct and question identity. How do race, socio-economic status, gender, and citizenship factor into imagined cities? How does geography limit or challenge these interactions? And why have many representations devolved from idyllic dreams to bleak dystopias? Readings might include Allen Ginsberg’s Howl, Nathanael West’s Miss Lonelyhearts and Day of the Locust, Karen Tei Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange, and geographers David Harvey and Doreen Massey. Essays will give students the opportunity to develop their own arguments and to try their hand at the stylistic and rhetorical conventions modeled by the readings.\n\nMW 08:40–09:55 a.m. Noor Hashem 28624 Jeremy Braddock\n\nENGLISH 1158.102\n\nAmerican Voices: The Politics of Style\n\nHow can a literary text be political? Might it become political not just in its subject matter, but also in the way it’s written? How can texts which don’t always speak explicitly of the events of their time be political in some other, maybe even more radical, way? By reading, writing about, and in some cases, imitating texts with complicated relationships to their context, we will consider how literary style might already be a political act. Texts may include Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man and selections from Shadow and Act, Tim O’Brien’s The Things They Carried, Thoreau’s Civil Disobedience and Hawthorne’s short stories. Writing assignments will include reading journals, style imitation exercises, and formal analytic essays.\n\nMWF 11:15–12:05 p.m. Ingrid Diran 28625 Jeremy Braddock\n\nENGLISH 1158.103\n\nAmerican Voices: Nineteen Eighty Five\n\nThis course will focus on thinking and writing about the literature of 1985. We’ll read three novels published that year (Don DeLillo’s White Noise, Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian, and Haruki Murakami’s Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World) and place these in the context of the contemporary social and cultural milieu, especially ﬁlm, television, and the emergence of home-video-game technology. We’ll focus on close literary analysis of the novels, but there will also be substantial secondary theoretical readings on postmodernism and globalization. While spotlighting such a speciﬁc historical moment should ideally give us some sense of its zeitgeist, in general we’ll read these very diverse texts on their own terms.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Nicholas Roth 28626 Jeremy Braddock\n\nENGLISH 1158.104\n\nAmerican Voices: American Dreams, American Nightmares—The Quest for Identity\n\nThis course explores the American novel of the journey, from the 1950’s to the present. We will trace the particularly American quest for identity—be it comic, romantic, tragic, or nightmarish—and we will attempt to answer the following question: What is it to be American? How can we deﬁne “Americanness,” and how has it been deﬁned for us, historically? We’ll look at ways American authors as divergent as Saul Bellow, Willa Cather, Junot Díaz, Zora Neale Hurston, Cormac McCarthy, and J. D. Salinger have attempted to subvert and redeﬁne notions of the American. Written assignments will include six formal essays, regular in-class writing exercises, and the opportunity to produce a short creative piece.\n\nMW 02:55–04:10 p.m. Jennifer Adams 28627 Jeremy Braddock\n\nENGLISH 1158.105\n\nAmerican Voices: Worlds of Fiction—Thinking, Reading, Creating\n\nWe will examine modern ﬁction with an emphasis on the short story and novella. Students will write critical essays on work by authors from around the world who ﬂourished between 1870 to present day. We will also try our hand at creating our own ﬁction in our last class session.\n\nMW 02:55–04:10 p.m. Helena Viramontes 28628\n\nENGLISH 1158.106\n\nAmerican Voices: Home Strange Home—Writing about Place\n\nContemporary writer Rebecca Solnit claims that “to know a place, like a friend or lover, is for it to become familiar…. [T]o know it better is for it to become strange again.” What does it mean to know a place? What’s the relationship between place, identity, and community? What might strangers notice that natives don’t (and vice versa)? We’ll explore how writers navigate both the American landscape and their relationships to it, transforming place from mere “setting” into something more. Possible texts include novels by Cormac McCarthy and Jonathan Safran Foer; short stories by Proulx, Faulkner, O’Connor, and Hemingway; essays by\n\nSolnit, Thoreau, and Baldwin. Writing assignments include journaling, literary analysis, and an essay project on writing our way into familiarity (and strangeness?) with Ithaca.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Sarah Ensor 28629 Jeremy Braddock\n\nENGLISH 1158.107/108\n\nAmerican Voices: Time Travels in American Literature\n\nAmerican “time travel” might conjure images of Marty McFly and Back to the Future, but the persistently popular concept of time travel has a long and varied history within American literature and culture. From Rip Van Winkle to contemporary novels that play with time to recover forgotten histories, characters throughout American literature travel through time, as time travels within American literature. In this course we will read “classic” time travel stories like Mark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, but we will also read texts that complicate time in less familiar ways. Writing assignments will include short responses and multi-draft essays on texts by Irving, Bellamy, Twain, Silko and others as we ask what anxieties time travel narratives express at diﬀerent historical moments.\n\nENGLISH 1158.109\n\nAmerican Voices: Diverse Voices of American Identity\n\nWho is “American?” How is American identity conceptualized and acted out in diverse cultural communities within the land deﬁned as the United States of America? In what ways do contemporary novels about these communities reﬂect these communities and deﬁne them for an audience beyond community borders? In this seminar, we’ll read a series of contemporary novels by authors like Toni Morrison, Junot Diaz, Leslie Silko, Kiana Davenport, and Cormac McCarthy that exemplify the multifaceted role of story in communicating cultural identity. Through journal writing, autobiographical essays, and critical analytical essays, students will explore diverse conceptions of American identity as they are communicated in contemporary novels and consider how those conceptions can both solidify and productively unsettle notions of “being American.”\n\nTR 01:25–02:40 p.m. Virginia Kennedy 28632 Jeremy Braddock\n\nENGLISH 1158.111/112\n\nAmerican Voices: The Obama Moment\n\nThis course will engage some of the most compelling and provocative political analysis, cultural criticism, and art of “the Obama moment.” We will analyze the President’s self-representation by reading his ﬁrst memoir and select speeches. However, we will focus on journalistic and artistic representations of Obama and his signiﬁcance. Speciﬁcally, we will ask how his ascendancy has highlighted issues that have long been central to US society: race relations, race loyalty, the limits of white liberalism, the relationship between white and black feminisms, the notion of the US as a “post-racial” nation. Through frequent writing exercises and essays, we will hone our own skills as cultural critics. Supporters of McCain, Clinton, et al. are more than welcome.\n\nENGLISH 1167\n\nGreat New Books\n\nGreat literature in English goes back several centuries, but some of it is being written right now. What are the great new books of the twenty-ﬁrst century, and how do we know? What role do reviews, prizes, book clubs and movie adaptations play in establishing the appeal and prestige of new literature? These are some of the questions we’ll explore as we read, discuss, and write critical essays about several of the most acclaimed books published in the last ten years. Our readings will include works in a range of genres, from novels and memoirs to poetry and children’s literature.\n\nENGLISH 1168.101\n\nCultural Studies: The Figure of the Badass in Literature and Film\n\nThe Road Warrior. Rambo. Ellen Ripley. Coriolanus. All walk alone. All stand up for what’s right. All are Badasses. But what exactly makes a “Badass,” and what does it mean to be one? This course will examine our conception of the Badass through many mediums: we will engage with literary texts, critical essays, and ﬁlms. Through these works, we will seek to better understand what exactly the Badass is, and how he or she intersects with issues of gender, race, technology, sexuality, and cinematic representation. Writing and revising will form an integral part of this course, allowing you to develop and work through your own analyses. Texts may include Shakespeare’s Coriolanus, Old English poetry, Kierkegaard’s Fear and Trembling, The 6th Day, Mad Max, and Aliens.\n\nMW 08:40–09:55 a.m. John Robbins 28641 Jane Juﬀer\n\nENGLISH 1168.102\n\nCultural Studies: Happily Ever Aftermath\n\nIn the beginning was the end: at least for these versions of the world. Hollywood endings are notorious for their wish-fulﬁlling escapism, a lucrative venture in itself. How, then, to understand stories beginning from a love of aftermath? What we might write oﬀ as scare tactic, melodramatic gimmick, or gross exaggeration might, on examination, involve passionate renunciation of the status quo. Whether analyzing ﬁlms as varied as Resnais’s Hiroshima mon amour and Cameron’s Terminator, reading ﬁction like H. G. Wells’s The World Set Free, artistic manifestos, or rap lyrics—our writing for this class will investigate how apocalypse launches imagination. Through words and images, we consider how “worlds at an end” have galvanized audiences to horror or to hope: that is, how not to hold on.\n\nMWF 09:05–09:55 a.m. Avery Slater 28642 Jane Juﬀer\n\nENGLISH 1168.103\n\nCultural Studies: Martial Arts Discipline and Punish\n\nBruce Lee and other martial arts actors portray characters who are extremely disciplined, but how do their ﬁlms discipline us as an audience and create in us a social, cultural and political subject that is just as ﬁnely-tuned? This seminar uses the action cinema of Hong Kong as an occasion to think and write about philosophical and ethical questions, with an emphasis on French theorist Michel Foucault’s Discipline and Punish. Films will include 36th Chamber of Shaolin and Fist of Legend, among others; we will also consider the Street Fighter game series and a selection of literary texts, such as Beowulf and Shakespeare’s Coriolanus, in order to extend our conversation across media and cultures. Student writing will involve close reading, critical debate and theoretical critique.\n\nMWF 11:15–12:05 p.m. Matthew Bucemi 28643 Jane Juﬀer\n\nENGLISH 1168.104\n\nCultural Studies: Writing on Art, Art from Writing\n\nThis course addresses many and varied relations of word and image: How do written texts respond to visual art? How does art respond to texts? How can we as writers render in words that which is without language but calls for interpretation? How do artists render in painting or sculpture the substance of a text? How is an episode from Ovid or the Bible represented in multiple works of art, and how may visual renderings of a familiar tale both retell it and interpret it? How does a static work of art render time and memory? Writers considered may include Ruskin, Pater, Hazlitt, Shelley, Keats, Hogarth, Diderot, Baudelaire, Auden, John Ashbery. Works of art from such as: Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Rubens, Turner, Rauschenberg, Twombly, the Laocoön group, and the the Elgin Marbles.\n\nMWF 01:25–02:15 p.m. Tatiana Senkevitch 28644\n\nENGLISH 1168.105\n\nCultural Studies: Architexts—Castles, Prisons, Oﬃces\n\nFrom Gothic castles to modern oﬃce cubicles, architectural settings can have as much signiﬁcance as literature’s characters and plots. This course attempts to map the symbolic and poetic spaces of buildings as they shape, and are shaped by, the values and forms within texts. We will investigate ways of reading architecture—and how architecture, in turn, helps determine or deconstruct social bodies. How are castles haunted by the specters of history? How do prisons “incarcerate” certain reading practices? How do oﬃces assume (or subvert) a view of humans as machines? We will write about such questions while reading authors that may include Borges, Melville, e. e. cummings, or Tom Wolfe, and looking at architecture such as Bentham’s Panopticon, Tschumi’s Follies, and episodes of The Oﬃce.\n\nMW 07:30–08:45 p.m. William Cordeiro 28645 Jane Juﬀer\n\nENGLISH 1168.106\n\nCultural Studies: Gone to the Dogs—The Canine in Literature and Culture\n\nThis interdisciplinary FWS will introduce students to behavioral, ethological, philosophical, historical, and literary perspectives on dogs. It will also emphasize how thinking about the dog-human relationship has changed profoundly over the past several decades. Mark Derr’s A Dog’s History of America, Virginia Woolf’s Flush, Donna Haraway’s The Companion Species Manifesto, Jack London’s The Call of the Wild, and Raymond and Lorna Coppinger’s Dogs: A New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior, and Evolution are some of the possible course readings. Writing assignments will include short essays, a revised longer essay and in-class critical thinking exercises. The mode of the class will be discussion. Students will have the opportunity to take several voluntary, oﬀ-campus ﬁeld trips during the semester.\n\nTR 01:25–02:40 p.m. Laura Donaldson 28646 Dag Woubshet\n\nENGLISH 1168.107\n\nCultural Studies: Everybody Lies—Lying and Literature in House and Holmes\n\nWhat is the diﬀerence between a truth and a lie? Between truth and ﬁction? In this seminar, we will rethink the function and value of lies, of ﬁction, through the TV series House, M.D. We will view the show as a secondary ﬁction, adapting Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s original novels and short stories about Sherlock Holmes. We will consider the role of lies in the construction of concepts such as “God,” “niceness,” “blackness,” “bisexuality,” “success” (economic or otherwise), and identity. And we will critique the show’s philosophical, socio-political, scientiﬁc, and aesthetic construction of itself in similar terms. After all, as Gregory House says, “everybody lies.” Discussions and writing assignments will focus on House and Doyle, in addition to texts by Nietzsche, Freud, and Arendt.\n\nTR 01:25–02:40 p.m. Sang Yin Wu 28647 Jane Juﬀer\n\nENGLISH 1168.108\n\nCultural Studies: Acoustic Modernity—Literature, Music, and the Meaning of Sound\n\nWhat would anarchy or total social control sound like? Literary works like T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land or Anthony Burgess’s Clockwork Orange have long envisioned what human society will become (or already is). They often look to music, in particular, to help create this vision. In this course we will examine works in which society’s fate is rethought through music, looking closely at literature’s musical themes and forms. At the same time we will listen carefully to a range of our own music, from Dylan to Public Enemy, punk to indie, exploring its visions of our present society by paying close attention to its literary and musical form. Students will write short responses, track reviews, critical analyses, and a ﬁnal research paper.\n\nTR 11:40–12:55 p.m. Benjamin Glaser 28648 Jane Juﬀer\n\nENGLISH 1170\n\nShort Stories\n\nWhat do Minority Report, Brokeback Mountain, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have in common? Each began life as a short story. Uncanny yet homely, short stories bestride both the commonplace anecdotes we relate daily and the high literary tradition that values visionary moments. Short ﬁction can pack poetry’s punch and still ride the novel’s propulsive drive of plot. Stories make us human; they urge us to write. Although we will primarily write analytical essays about the craft (and the reading) of narrative, we will nevertheless ﬁnd our creative and research abilities challenged. Texts may include works by authors such as Poe, Melville, de Maupassant, Gilman, Chopin, Hemingway, Faulkner, Steinbeck, O’Connor, O’Brien, Carver, Lawrence, Atwood, Munro, Chekhov, Joyce, Kafka, Kipling, Danticat, Lahiri.\n\nENGLISH 1191.101\n\nBritish Literature: The Private Life—The Ordering of Inner Thoughts in Devotional Literature\n\nSocrates’ prayer from the Phaedrus—“May the outward and inward man be at one”—is striking to the contemporary reader. Modern society so clearly rewards external performance and image management over the cultivation of a rich and mature inward person. The constant exposure of the hypocrisy and scandal of well- known ﬁgures reminds us, however, of the dangers of a public life that far outpaces a neglected private life. In this course, we will examine the life of devotion that produces the quiet ordering of the inner person and study the literature of the English devotional tradition. Authors may include John Donne, George Herbert, Francis de Sales, and John Bunyan. Through in-class writing and formal essays, we will develop skills in close reading and critical thinking.\n\nMWF 10:10–11:00 a.m. Jane Kim 28653 Wendy Jones\n\nENGLISH 1191.102\n\nBritish Literature:Monks, Monsters, and Madwomen—Gothic Romantic Literature\n\nWhy do stories of murder, incest, diabolism, and seduction continue to fascinate? What drew nineteenth- century audiences to tales of wickedness and woe? In this course, we’ll study and write about popular romantic-era tales of horror, from nursery stories and sensational plays to classic send-ups of the genre such as Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey and John Keats’s The Eve of St Agnes. We’ll analyze their ornamental and elevated style and their often artiﬁcial conventions, such as desolate settings, tortured spirits, and fainting heroines. Taking these texts as indicative of the spirit of the age, we’ll identify the anxieties they express and assuage, with particular interest in the sense of power gone mad that is often at the heart of gothic literature.\n\nMWF 10:10–11:00 a.m. Mariam Wassif 28654 Wendy Jones\n\nENGLISH 1191.103\n\nBritish Literature: Animals, Monsters, and Aliens\n\nWhat is a human being? In response to this surprisingly diﬃcult question, British authors have compared humans with many other creatures, including imaginary ones. Each unit of this course pairs a classic work with a science-ﬁction novel about a particularly disturbing non-human ﬁgure: the talking animal, the human-animal hybrid, and the rational non-human. We will not only analyze rhetorical strategies for constructing and challenging deﬁnitions of the human but also consider how science ﬁction can oﬀer new perspectives on classic literature. In addition to analytical essays, students will write a creative piece in which\n\nthey adopt a non-human perspective. Featured books include Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, H. G. Wells’s Island of Dr. Moreau, and C. S. Lewis’s Out of the Silent Planet.\n\nTR 11:40–12:55 p.m. Bryan Alkemeyer 28655 Wendy Jones\n\nENGLISH 1191.104/106\n\nBritish Literature: Medieval Popular Culture, Then and Now\n\n“What do Vikings and credit cards have in common, anyway?” If you’ve watched TV recently you may have asked yourself that question – this course will help you ﬁnd the answer. In “Medieval Popular Culture, Then & Now” we will examine how we deﬁne “popular culture” and why medievalism so often features in its most famous texts. We will read medieval examples of popular entertainment, and ask if they perform similar cultural work to our media of today. Texts will include Beowulf (the poem and 2007 ﬁlm), saints’ lives, Arthuriana, a passion play, Star Wars, a Batman graphic novel, and advertisements. Students will produce six pieces of writing during the semester, including close readings and the opportunity to create (and then analyze) their own medieval romance.\n\nENGLISH 1191.105\n\nBritish Literature: Jane Austen\n\nWe will read and write about all of the major novels of Jane Austen as well as some of her lesser known works. Our exploration of Austen’s ﬁction will go beyond her Masterpiece Theatre façade to discover a novelist deeply engaged with philosophy, history, and politics.\n\nTR 02:55–04:10 p.m. Wendy Jones 28657\n\nENGLISH 1270.101\n\nWriting about Literature: The Reading of Fiction\n\nWe will examine modern ﬁction from 1870 with an emphasis on the short story and novella. Our writers will include: Conrad, Dostoevsky, Joyce, Kafka, Woolf, Lawrence, Mann, Chekhov, Hemingway, Faulkner, and Welty. We will not only study form and narrative strategies but we will also put these works in the context of intellectual and historical developments, including parallel developments in modern art. Student writing assignments will be mostly critical essays, but there will be one creative assignment. Our goals will be to develop close, attentive, imaginative reading and writing-and to enjoy our reading and writing!!\n\nMW 08:40–09:55 a.m. Daniel Schwarz 28663\n\nStudents who have already taken a First-Year Writing Seminar, or who scored 4 or 5 on the Princeton AP exam, or 700 or better on the English Composition or CEEB tests, may enroll, space permitting, in this upper-level First-Year Writing Seminar: Engl 1270.\n\nENGLISH 1270.102\n\nWriting about Literature: Modern Fiction\n\nThis course examines modern ﬁction, with an emphasis on short stories—and a few longer ones— published in the past one hundred years. Authors may include Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Franz Kafka, Ernest Hemingway, Vladimir Nabokov, Flannery O’Connor, Toni Cade Bambara, Gabriel Garcia Márquez, Grace Paley, and Beth Nugent. The last unit of the semester will explore diﬀerent critical approaches to Joseph Conrad’s novella The Secret Sharer. The seminar combines detailed, imaginative analysis of ﬁction with intensive writing and revisions of critical essays.\n\nMW 08:40–09:55 a.m. Fredric Bogel 28664\n\nStudents who have already taken a First-Year Writing Seminar, or who scored 4 or 5 on the Princeton AP exam, or 700 or better on the English Composition or CEEB tests, may enroll, space permitting, in this upper-level First-Year Writing Seminar: Engl 1270.\n\nENGLISH 1270.103\n\nWriting about Literature: The Great Pleasures of Short Fiction\n\nIn this course, we will closely read a variety of nineteenth- and twentieth-century short ﬁction, from Poe’s unforgettable tales of horror to Nabokov’s dazzling metaﬁctional puzzles, from Melville’s mysterious antebellum Manhattan to Woolf’s and Joyce’s high modernist gems. Over the semester we will observe the wide variety of styles and shapes that short ﬁction can assume, and we will focus our critical lenses on what literary eﬀects are achieved by our authors’ formal and narrative techniques.\n\nMWF 10:10–11:00 a.m. Kevin Attell 28665\n\nStudents who have already taken a First-Year Writing Seminar, or who scored 4 or 5 on the Princeton AP exam, or 700 or better on the English Composition or CEEB tests, may enroll, space permitting, in the following upper-level First-Year Writing Seminar: Engl 1270.\n\nENGLISH 1270.104\n\nWriting about Literature: Tragedy\n\nIn this course, we will study and write critically about plays, older and newer, in a variety of dramatic idioms and cultural traditions. We will practice close, interpretive reading of texts and pay attention to their possibilities for live and ﬁlmed performance. Readings will include works by such playwrights as Sophocles and Shakespeare, Arthur Miller and Caryl Churchill, Ntosake Shange and Tony Kushner, and some drama criticism and performance theory. Attendance at screenings and at live productions by the Theatre Department may be required.\n\nMWF 11:15–12:05 p.m. Philip Lorenz 28666\n\nStudents who have already taken a First-Year Writing Seminar, or who scored 4 or 5 on the Princeton AP exam, or 700 or better on the English Composition or CEEB tests, may enroll, space permitting, in this upper-level First-Year Writing Seminar: Engl 1270.\n\nENGLISH 1270.105\n\nWriting about Literature: Telling Stories—The Power of Narrative\n\nThis course explores how stories move readers. It aims to help you respond to the short ﬁction we will read with an ever-growing intensity of perceptiveness and pleasure. Along the way, it will also introduce you to a relatively new branch of narrative study. Medical schools have begun to oﬀer courses in what has become known as “narrative medicine” (and its relative “narrative ethics”). I’m no physician, and the primary focus of the course will rest on the stories we read. By the end of the semester, though, you should have gained a notion of why medical training increasingly includes an exploration of the power of narrative and why some would claim that narratives can heal.\n\nMWF 02:30–03:20 p.m. Harry Shaw 28667\n\nStudents who have already taken a First-Year Writing Seminar, or who scored 4 or 5 on the Princeton AP exam, or 700 or better on the English Composition or CEEB tests, may enroll, space permitting, in this upper-level First-Year Writing Seminar: Engl 1270.\n\nFRENCH 1102.101\n\nQueer Rhetorics\n\nWhat is rhetoric, and what could make it queer? Is it possible for rhetoric not to be queer? This course explores the logos, the pathos, and the ethos of “queer” writing, with the objective of analyzing the relationships between form and content writing. Texts might include: stories from Does Your Mama Know?: An Anthology of Black Lesbian Coming Out Stories, Sharon Bridgforth’s The Bull-Jean Stories, performance stories set in the 1920s South; and/or Valencia, whose author has been described as “a punk rock Judy Blume.” We will also read essays in queer theory, broach problems of racism, classism, and ableism in LGBT movements, and watch a few ﬁlms. Writing assignments will be as varied in style as the reading assignments.\n\nMWF 11:15–12:05 p.m. Shanna Carlson 28464 Kathleen Long\n\nFRENCH 1106.101\n\n(Il) Legitimate Loves: Marriage in Seventeenth-Century French and Spanish Theatre\n\nThrough a reading of various plays by Racine, Corneille, and Molière as well as Lope de Vega, Calderon, and de Castro, students will examine the ideas of love and marriage and the possible subversions and perversions of these themes. We will use these texts as a source and motivation for our reading, writing, and critical analysis, while not losing sight of these plays as performances. Film screenings, performances, modern adaptations of these works, and historical material related to the plays in production will be included. Student work will involve extensive writing, both formal and informal, as well as a short theatrical performance or staged reading.\n\nMWF 09:05–09:55 a.m. Luisa Rosas 28465 Kathleen Long\n\nFRENCH 1108.101\n\nMonstrous Forms: Wild Men and Wicked Women\n\nMonstrosity is a means of marking oﬀ and isolating the “unacceptable” other, that which threatens us, often for reasons that we cannot explain. Throughout time, women, people of other races and nations, various species of animals, have all been designated as monstrous. This course will explore the gendering of monstrosity: why is it that monstrous men are described as “wild,” as if their monstrosity is natural, while monstrous women are most frequently described as “wicked,” as if their monstrosity is a moral failing? We will focus on texts about “wild men” and witches: Yvain by Chrétien de Troyes, Beowulf, Grendel by John Gardner, Ambroise Paré’s On Monsters and Marvels, and selected episodes of The X-Files.\n\nMWF 10:10–11:00 a.m. Kathleen Long 28466\n\nGERMAN STUDIES 1105.101\n\nLanguage of Alchemy: The Romantic Tale\n\nAlchemy: can lead be changed into gold? Is there an elixir that can cure disease and prolong life? As the French revolution and its aftermath split Europe, another—and no less drastic—revolution took place in the realm of science: the discovery of oxygen gave rise to modern chemistry. The ground for this break was, however, long prepared by alchemy, the esoteric knowledge of binding and separating the elements. Alchemists led the way for philosophers and writers in the Romantic era in a quest for the legendary “philosophers’ stone” and in seeking what they called the “chemical marriage.” Reading representations of alchemy by Goethe, Novalis, Hoﬀmann and more recent texts such as Hofmannsthal’s Andreas, we will analyze and write about the tensions between the mystical and the scientiﬁc.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Anna Glazova 28467 Brent McBride\n\nGERMAN STUDIES 1109\n\nFrom Fairy Tales to the Uncanny: Exploring the Romantic Consciousness\n\nAs didactic texts that present explicit—and implicit—moral lessons, fairy tales shape cultural identity by questioning as well as aﬃrming dominant cultural values. This seminar uses selections from the Brothers Grimm to analyze characteristic features of the genre and examine its evolution to the present day. Our investigation will focus on how the transformation of oral folk tales into literary texts in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries sparked an interest in androids, the paranormal, and the pathological and spurred German Romantics to experiment with new forms of ﬁction that established the matrix for popular genres like horror, mystery, fantasy, and sci-ﬁ. The emphasis of the course is on improving writing skills.\n\nGERMAN STUDIES 1170.101\n\nMarx, Nietzsche, Freud\n\nA grasp of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud is essential to understanding critical discourse in the humanities and social sciences. This seminar introduces (1) the three revolutionaries who shaped modern and postmodern thought and practice; and (2) the key terms of the analytic models they pioneered: political economy, post- metaphysical philosophy, and psychoanalysis (including diﬀerences and points of intersection). Discussions and assignments will focus on short texts and excerpts from longer texts that are essential to understanding their work and lay a foundation for critically analyzing global society, politics, and culture. The core problem: Do alternative ways of thinking and acting exist in opposition to how we already think and act? The emphasis of the course is on improving writing skills.\n\nTR 11:40–12:55 p.m. Carl Gelderloos 28472 Douglas Brent McBride\n\nGOVERNMENT 1101.101\n\nPower and Politics: Markets and Morals\n\nThe market is seen as the default mechanism of economic organization. But is it morally defensible? In this course, we examine defenses of the market—defenses emphasizing eﬃciency, rights, and deservedness—as well as critiques. What justiﬁes private property? What is owed to those with less to oﬀer the market, such as the disabled? Are there things that should not be bought or sold, such as bodily organs? Can a voluntary exchange still be exploitative? In addressing these questions we will read canonical thinkers—including Adam Smith and Marx—contemporary philosophers—such as Nozick and Sandel—and coverage of topics of relevance to public policy. Assignments will be designed to enable students to sharpen their analytical writing skills and develop and articulate their own views.\n\nTR 11:40–12:55 p.m. Simon Cotton 28473 Isaac Kramnick\n\nGOVERNMENT 1101.102\n\nPower and Politics: Causes of War and the War in Iraq\n\nWhy do states ﬁght wars? Moreover, what can existing theories of war tell us about the causes of modern conﬂicts such as the most recent war in Iraq? In this course, we will begin by examining prominent theories of war. We will then study the events leading up to the war in Iraq, assessing which theories best explain why, when, how, and with whose cooperation the Iraq war was fought. Students will answer these fascinating questions in writing assignments that are designed to help them hone their analytical skills and learn to communicate their ideas clearly.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Jessica Weeks 28474\n\nGOVERNMENT 1101.103\n\nPower and Politics: Islam and Development in the Comparative Perspective\n\nStudents in this class will undertake an in-depth survey of economic development and political power in the Muslim world. The world contains well over one billion Muslims, and the majority of them live under authoritarian regimes, in conditions of economic hardship if not abject poverty. Yet this underdevelopment exists alongside glimpses of prosperity in Dubai and Kuala Lumpur, amidst astounding natural resource wealth, and despite widespread popular dissatisfaction with incumbent governments. In discussion, readings, and writing, we will study the political economy of the Muslim world in order to understand the varying development trajectories of Muslim-majority countries.\n\nTR 02:55–04:10 p.m. Tom Pepinsky 28475\n\nGOVERNMENT 1101.104\n\nPower and Politics: US Democracy Promotion\n\nOver the past twenty years, the United States has made democracy promotion a major foreign policy priority. Does the United States always support democratic change abroad, or can concerns about energy supplies and national security dampen the enthusiasm for democratic change? How does democracy assistance actually work—on the ground and in Washington, DC? How distinctive is the US approach as compared to European eﬀorts in this area? Has the United States actually contributed to democratic change in other countries, or have such interventions undermined democratic development? Finally, given our answers to these questions: can and should the United States be in the business of promoting democracy in the international system? Students will write short papers on issues highlighted in the readings and in our discussions.\n\nTR 08:40–09:55 a.m. Valerie Bunce 28476\n\nGOVERNMENT 1101.105\n\nPower and Politics: Authoritarianism in the Age of Globalization\n\nDo authoritarian leaders care about globalization? Does it make their lives more or less diﬃcult? How do authoritarian regimes navigate today’s highly globalized world economy? These are some of the questions we will try to answer in this course. Approaching these topics will require a discussion of complicated concepts, such as capitalism, democracy, authoritarianism, property rights, globalization, and many others. In addition to Frieden’s Global Capitalism, the readings for the course will come from political science and economics journals. We will aim to clarify our ideas about these issues by writing them down and then, re-writing them many times over. For this purpose, the course will be organized around writing assignments that will ask students to reﬂect on readings and class discussions.\n\nTR 08:40–09:55 a.m. Igor Logvinenko 28477 Valerie Bunce\n\nHUMAN DEVELOPMENT 1120.101\n\nPsychology and Literature: Voices of Vermin, Vagabonds, and Vampires\n\nWhat are the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and about others? What is our responsibility to ourselves and to others and how does this responsibility impact identity? We will examine the interplay between developmental psychology and literature, to see how life imitates art and vice versa. For instance, students will apply broad developmental theories to literary characters, as if these characters were case studies, and students will also apply these theories to their own lives. By reading texts such as Kafka’s The Metamorphosis and Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye, students will begin to think about their identity and start to write their narrative. Reading and writing will be used not just as an academic exercise but as a transformational process in self- discovery.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Charlotte Sweeney 28478 Steve Ceci\n\nHISTORY 1102.101\n\nRoma (Gypsies) in Europe and the United States\n\nThe Roma, one of several groups of people lumped together by outsiders of the group under the name “Gypsy,” have a long history in Europe and were among the ﬂood of immigrants to the United States at the turn of the century. This course will introduce students to the history of the Roma in Europe and the United States using literature and ﬁlms made by Roma about Romani culture. Additionally, the course will identify the representation of “Gypsies” in ﬁlm and literature and ask students to interrogate these representations through a variety of writing exercises.\n\nTR 02:55–04:10 p.m. Ann Wilde 28863\n\nHISTORY 1114.101\n\nThe Cold War: Revolt and Revolution\n\nThis course introduces students to three major, closely related themes in the study of twentieth-century United States and world history: the Cold War, revolutionary movements in the postwar era, and nationalism. How did the Cold War and revolutionary movements shape the global political landscape as we know it today? How do we write about the role the politics of nationalism played in the outcome of the Cold War and revolutionary movements? Texts in this course include the writings of Ché Guevara, Fidel Castro, and Franz Fanon, and historians Eric Hobsbawn and John Gaddis. Essays of varying length will be assigned throughout the course.\n\nMWF 11:15–12:05 p.m. Jorge Rivera Marin 28501 Fredrik Logevall\n\nHISTORY 1128.101\n\nWomen and Black Nationalism in the United States\n\nAlthough often overlooked, Black women have played an important role in the development and practice of Black Nationalism in the United States. Through an examination of Black Nationalist women throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this course will explore the history of such women, paying particular attention to the unique position they held and the challenges they faced as women. Additionally, students will be challenged to explore and write about the ways in which feminist and/or Womanist perspectives complimented and/or complicated Black women’s interpretations and expressions of Black Nationalism. Ultimately, this course oﬀers a more gender-balanced lens into the study of Black Nationalism in the United States.\n\nTR 01:25–02:40 p.m. Candace Katungi 28502 Margaret Washington\n\nHISTORY 1137.101\n\nTheories of World History\n\nHow did the idea of world history arise? To what extent are our present views on history indebted to the theories of the past? What is the relationship between theories of world history and current trends towards globalization? In engaging with these questions, this course will explore diﬀerent interpretations of history from the eighteenth century to the present. It will also examine competing explanations about the causes of globalization and the special status that has often been accorded to Western civilization in the shaping of world history. Particular emphasis will be devoted to developing writing skills and careful analysis of historical and philosophical texts. Readings include selections from G. W. F. Hegel, Karl Marx, Francis Fukuyama, Jared Diamond, and others.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Taran Kang 28503 Dominick LaCapra\n\nHISTORY 1138.101\n\nThe Quest for Commercial Empires in Early America\n\nEarly America of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was a remarkable place. Historians often portrayed trade during this period as Anglo-centric: primarily peopled with English and managed from London. In practice, trade had no core. It was not managed from any center—London, Amsterdam, or elsewhere; men and women on both sides of the Atlantic made strategies, choices, and decisions. Today, everyone thinks about globalization as something new. But here, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, is the true beginning of it. This seminar will examine four Atlantic empires trading in early America—the Dutch, English, French, and Spanish. In this course, students will develop the skills necessary to analyze historical and contemporary writings and to communicate their ideas in written presentations.\n\nTR 11:40–12:55 p.m. Kim Todt 28504 Mary Beth Norton\n\nITALIAN 1105.101\n\nThe Humanities Confront Climate Change\n\nClimate change is the most signiﬁcant crisis of our age. Because greenhouse gas emissions have an eﬀect on climate wherever they are produced, it is arguably the ﬁrst truly global event. While scientists and social scientists work on solutions and policy, what role, if any, could the humanities play? Are literature, art, and cinema reduced to merely raising awareness about climate change? Or in their very impracticality, can the humanities provide a necessary response to the climate crisis? These are the fundamental questions that we will ask in this class as we read literary and philosophical texts, view ﬁlms, study art works, and reﬂect on ways of writing about the crisis in a number of short essays and a longer research paper.\n\nMWF 01:25–02:15 p.m. Karen Pinkus 28479\n\nLINGUISTICS 1100.101\n\nLanguage, Thought, and Reality: Testing the Language Instinct\n\nWhen children ﬁrst acquire language, in all its complexity, they do so with such ease and eﬀortlessness that it seems they are pre-programmed for it, as an instinct. Linguists are discovering common properties throughout the world’s languages; perhaps the universals are due to a common biology. In this seminar, we will examine the issues surrounding the debate on language innateness. We will focus on the contrast between taught and untaught knowledge of language. How do children learn to speak? How are languages similar to and diﬀerent from each other? Do other animals have language? Do some people speak more “grammatically” than others? Readings will include Steven Pinker’s 1994 bestseller The Language Instinct. Students will write a series of short papers and a longer paper.\n\nTR 10:10–11:25 a.m. Esra Kesici 28480 Wayne Harbert\n\nLINGUISTICS 1100.102\n\nLanguage, Thought, and Reality: The Death of Language\n\nThis course will address issues related to language death, including: What does it mean for a language to be endangered? Why should we care? Are some languages more viable or valid than others? We will discuss issues such as the globalization of English, language as a vehicle for culture, linguistic prejudices, language revival programs, etc. This course will touch on languages and dialects around the world, including modern Hebrew (Israel), Mayan (Mexico), Bunong (Vietnam), and Ebonics (United States). Students will write short papers on a subset of the language issues discussed in class and one longer paper on a related issue of their choosing.\n\nMWF 11:15–12:05 p.m. Becky Thompson 28481 Wayne Harbert\n\nLINGUISTICS 1100.103\n\nLanguage, Thought, and Reality: From Cuneiform to Cryptography\n\nWhen ancient writings are discovered we are faced with a challenge: how can we decipher an unk"
