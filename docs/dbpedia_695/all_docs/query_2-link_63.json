        "text": "Last week the Writers Strike reached the Land of Enchantment, with picket lines in both Albuquerque and Santa Fe that shut down a couple of shoots. The biggest turnout was Friday, when we picketed the Greer Garson Studios for most of the day.\n\nHEY HEY HO HO\n\nCORPORATE GREED HAS TO GO\n\nSanta Fe does not have as many WGA members as California, of course, but while we don’t have the numbers, we yield nothing to California when it comes to determination.\n\nSome friends from distant lands joined us as well, including Neil Gaiman and Nnedi Okorafor.\n\nRebecca Roanhorse as also on hand, along with bestselling author Douglas Preston (from the Authors Guild), director/ producer Chris Eyre from DARK WINDS, Melinda Snodgrass of WILD CARDS and STAR TREK fame, and all sorts of other good people.\n\nThanks to our friends in the Teamsters and IATSE, who have been staunch allies from the start, and to all the people who HONKED to show their support as they drove by.\n\nHEY HEY HO HO\n\nMINI-ROOMS HAVE GOT TO GO\n\nThe strike is in its fourth week, but the Guild is more determined than ever.\n\nA number of productions have been shut down, but so far the AMPTP won’t even come back to the table. There’s nothing to do but redouble our efforts. The issues here are too important for anything less.\n\nI hope you’re with us. If so, HONK when you see our signs, in LA or SF or anywhere else. And never never ever cross a picket line.\n\nWe’ll be back when you least expect us."
