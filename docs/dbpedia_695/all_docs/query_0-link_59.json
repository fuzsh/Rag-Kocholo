        "text": "AWP Conference, February 29- March 4, Chicago\n\nSpalding MFA faculty, students, and alumni are set to attend the annual conference of AWP, the Association of Writers and Writing Programs, to be held February 29 to March 4 at the Hilton Chicago and Palmer House Hilton, both in downtown Chicago.\n\nMFAers are invited to visit the Spalding MFA/Louisville Review table during the Bookfair (Table M3 in the Southeast Hall, Hilton Chicago Lower Level), held 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nSena Naslund, Kathleen Driskell, Kenny Cook, Molly Peacock, Jeanie Thompson, Crystal Wilkinson Dianne Aprile, and other faculty members are to attend and, in some cases, present on panels. Numerous Spalding alumni and current students plan to attend as well. Among the alums presenting on panels are Dan Nowak, Katerina Stoykova-Klemer, and Christopher Klim.\n\nAt 7 p.m. on Saturday, March 3, WordFarm Press hosts a reception in honor of the book launch of Until Everything Is Continuous Again: American Poets on the Recent Work of W. S. Merwin, edited by Jonathan Weinert (Fall 2005) and Kevin Prufer. The book features contributions by Spalding faculty members Debra Kang Dean and Jeanie Thompson. The book grew out of a joint interview of Merwin by Thompson and Weinert when Merwin was the MFA Program’s featured author at the Fall 2006 residency. Thompson emcees the evening. “We’ll each probably read one of our favorite Merwin poems and speak briefly about why we felt this book was necessary and important to an understanding of W.S. Merwin in the canon of American poetry and also to the process of contemporary poetry writing,” Thompson said. “All of the contributors have been influenced in their own poetry by W.S. Merwin’s craft. So in a way, it is an homage to him.” WordFarm Press was co-founded by Marci Johnson (Spring 2005), who serves as poetry editor.\n\n(top)\n\nSpring 2012 Residency Program Book in Common Is Hush\n\nThe MFA Program’s Book in Common area for the Spring 2012 residency is Writing for Children and Young Adults, and the program director has selected the young adult novel Hush, by award-winning young-adult author Jacqueline Woodson, who has been named the inaugural Diana M. Raab Distinguished Writer in Residence for Spalding University’s brief-residency Master of Fine Arts in Writing Program. The subject matter of the novel, told from the perspective of the daughter of a police officer whose conscience leads him to testify against a fellow officer, is in keeping with the Spalding University-wide emphasis on social justice.\n\nAll students and faculty, regardless of their area of concentration, read Hush and prepare comments to add to the plenary discussion led by Program Director Sena Jeter Naslund, which takes place May 18, the first Friday of residency. Later in the residency, on Thursday, May 24, Woodson visits to present a talk on her work to the MFA students, faculty, and community at large. The next morning, she attends a closed Q & A session for the MFA students and faculty. After both presentations, MFA students and faculty may have their books signed.\n\nStudents entering ENG620 in the Spring 2012 semester are required to write a 2-4 page short critical essay on Hush and email it as an attachment to mfadropbox@spalding.edu by February 28; these essays are forwarded to the MFA Program’s expository writing coaches, who conduct one-hour small expository workshops during the spring residency for ENG620 students. (Current ENG610 students who are required to complete this assignment have been notified by email in January; those who have questions about this assignment should email Kathleen Driskell, kdriskell@spalding.edu.) All students adjust their semester’s reading lists in order to add Hush to their cumulative bibliographies.\n\nWoodson has written more than two dozen books for children and young adults, including picture books and novels for middle-grade and young-adult audiences. Her titles include Miracle’s Boys, which won the Coretta Scott King Award in 2001, and Newbery Honor titles After Tupac & D Foster, Feathers, and Show Way. She has also been awarded three Coretta Scott King Honors, a Margaret A. Edwards Award, and an ALAN Award—both for Lifetime Achievement in YA Literature. Her books have twice been nominated for the National Book Award. Woodson lives with her family in Brooklyn.\n\n(top)\n\nSpring 2012 Residency: Film Production Seminar\n\nStudents in all areas of concentration are eligible to participate in the Film Production Seminar (FPS) offered during the Spring 2012 residency in Louisville; however, space is limited and will be filled taking seniority into account. ENG610 is a prerequisite for this workshop.\n\nStudents participating in this seminar are not assigned to other workshops during residency, as this seminar is scheduled at the same time as Workshop. After completing the workshop seminar, students are mentored by faculty in their major areas of concentration for the independent study portion of the semester.\n\nFor their workshop submissions, FPS members present three two-page scripts to be considered for filming. In the first workshop, students discuss the scripts and, with the workshop leader’s guidance, choose one of the three to produce. Rehearsals, filming, and editing take place during the remaining workshop hours. Outside of the workshop, film production students attend other residency sessions, including plenary and craft lectures and panels, student and faculty readings, etc.\n\nBefore the residency, participants submit their three two-page scripts, which must use an indoor setting and employ not more than three actors, to mfadropbox@spalding.edu. While the two pages may be excerpted from current work, they should form a certain unity or completeness: each short script should have a beginning, middle, and an end. Students may wish to reshape some of their original scenes from their own writing into scripts to fit these requirements.\n\nThe screenwriting faculty and the program directors regard this activity as an enriching, optional experience for students in any area of concentration and are excited about this curriculum enhancement for our students. Interested students contact Ellyn Lichvar at elichvar@spalding.edu by February 10. Students who have met the ENG610 prerequisite will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n(top)\n\nParis Residency and Summer Semester\n\nIn July, the MFA Program travels to Paris for its Summer 2012 residency. The trip marks a return to the location of the first residency abroad in 2007. Classes and workshops will be held, as they were in 2007, at Reid Hall, the picturesque courtyard campus of Columbia University’s Paris branch near the Jardins du Luxembourg.\n\nFaculty for the trip are Julie Brickman and John Pipkin (fiction), Jeanie Thompson (poetry), Elaine Orr (creative nonfiction), Susan Campbell Bartoletti (writing for children and young adults), and Sam Zalutsky (screenwriting and playwriting). Kathleen Driskell will lead a teaching workshop as part of the ENG660 Teaching Practicum semester.\n\nStudents, faculty, and alumni stay at three-star hotels in the heart of the city. In addition to a full slate of workshops, lectures, panel discussions, conferences, and readings, the curriculum includes visits to four of Paris’s iconic museums—the Louvre, the Musée d’Orsay, the Pompidou Center, and the Rodin Museum—as well as a guided tour of the palace and gardens of Versailles. The Program Book in Common for summer is The Great Journey: Americans in Paris by David McCullough. Other books in common will be announced later.\n\nFor current students and alumni, the deadline to enroll for the Paris trip is February 1. Students must register for their course via WebAdvisor, then sign up with travel company EF Tours online or by phone. The 13-day tour package costs $4,216 for students flying from Louisville (price may be different for those flying from other airports) and includes airfare, hotel (shared room), ground transportation, EF Tours enrollment fee, comprehensive insurance policy, breakfasts, opening and closing dinners, guided tour of Versailles, museum tickets, and metro passes. The price for alumni and guests is $4,666 and includes all items listed above. Tuition costs are the same as residencies in Louisville.\n\nFor itinerary and enrollment, visit http://www.efcollegestudytours.com/1123785, or call 877-485-4184.\n\n(top)\n\nTeaching Workshop/Practicum offered in Paris Summer Residency\n\nStudents interested in taking the Teaching Practicum in Summer 2012 should contact Kathleen Driskell (kdriskell@spalding.edu) by February 28. Students must have finished ENG610 and ENG620. Summer 2012 graduating students may take ENG660 as a additional semester. Alums may take the teaching practicum as a post-graduate semester, if space allows. Students sign up to take only one workshop.\n\nENG660 is a 16-hour course. During residency, students meet in a cross-genre teaching workshop and lead discussions on submitted Worksheets. Students attend lectures outside their major areas of concentration in order to gain a wider view of the other genres they may be called upon to teach in introductory-level courses. Students not only benefit from lecture content, they also comment on the teaching methods used during those lectures. The number of residency reports required remains the same as for students enrolled in the other courses.\n\nDuring the semester, students develop syllabi, lesson plans, teaching diaries, and annotated bibliographies on pedagogical and classroom texts and submit those to the mentor in four course packets. Each student develops a workshop assignment and delivers that curriculum online to other students in ENG660. Each student must also arrange her or his own teaching practicum: In the past, students have taught in university settings, continuing education settings, non-credit courses, and online. Students have also convened beginning writers from their communities to meet as a class in local libraries, work environments, and community centers. Other teaching options may fit the practicum requirement.\n\nThe course is limited to six students and will be filled on a first come, first served basis (though students must meet the prerequisites).\n\nThe Teaching Workshop is reserved for those interested in enrolling in ENG660 for the entire practicum semester; however, if there are spaces unfilled (limit 6), MFA students may take the teaching workshop during the Summer 2012 residency and then continue to be mentored in their major area, such as fiction or poetry, for the remainder of the semester. Students interested in the teaching practicum or the teaching workshop, should email Kathleen Driskell as soon as possible, but before February 28 at kdriskell@spalding.edu.\n\n(top)\n\nFall 2011 Residency: Anniversary, Poems, Paintings, a Comic Opera\n\nThe MFA Program celebrated its 10th anniversary with a birthday party and announcement of the Diana M. Raab Distinguished Writer in Residence fund, a gift of alumna Diana Raab (Fall 2003). A panel of alumni spoke about the effect their Spalding experience has had on their lives as writers.\n\nThe Fall 2011 MFA residency took place November 11-20 with an emphasis on poetry. Before coming to residency, students and faculty read Gregory Orr’s collection The Caged Owl: New and Collected Poems. The opening-night welcome session included a discussion of the book, led by Program Director Sena Jeter Naslund. Later in the week, Orr gave a public reading and presentation, followed by a wide-ranging Q&A session for MFA faculty and students the next morning.\n\nAs part of the poetry emphasis, Sena delivered a lecture on poems about paintings and art objects. A faculty panel also commented on ekphrastic poetry. Students traveled to the Speed Art Museum for inspiration for the cross-genre assignment, in which all students, regardless of area of concentration, wrote an ekphrastic poem. At a follow-up session, some students read the results of the exercise aloud to the student body.\n\nThe Program also attended a full dress rehearsal of The Marriage of Figaro, the opera by Mozart, performed by the Kentucky Opera. Before the performance, opera educator Kimcherie Lloyd gave a presentation providing context for the opera and familiarizing students with the plot, characters and some of the music.\n\nIn addition to the traditional residency workshops, two workshops took on unique formats. A creative-nonfiction workshop led by Dianne Aprile and Roy Hoffman focused on the special topic of literary journalism. And a fiction workshop led by Rachel Harper and Eleanor Morse was dedicated to workshopping chapters from novel.\n\n(top)\n\nSpring 2012 Homecoming\n\nThe MFA Alumni Association is putting together a package of events for Homecoming, May 24-27, the final weekend of spring residency. Events kick off Thursday afternoon with a panel by alums who have published in the area of writing for children and young adults. The featured author presentation by Jacqueline Woodson follows. Woodson, who writes frequently about issues of race and social justice, will read from and discuss her YA novel, Hush.\n\nFriday’s events include a lecture for alumni by Richard Goodman, a session on publishing by Red Hen Press publisher Kate Gale, and the Celebration of Recently Published Books by Alumni, followed by a reception and the SPLoveFest bookfair. To nominate yourself for the Celebration of Recently Published Books by Alumni, contact Bonnie Johnson (Fall 2004) at bonnieomer@aol.com or Tom Pierce (Fall 2005) at tapierce@insightbb.com. To reserve a table at SPLoveFest to display your book, literary journal, visual art, or other literary or artistic project, contact Renee Culver (Fall 2006) at SPLoveFest@gmail.com.\n\nThe MFA Program is giving a free drink ticket to any Alumni Celebration attendee who wears Spalding MFA apparel or carries Spalding MFA gear (water bottle, tote bag, etc.) at the event.\n\nSaturday features an Un-Conference—a set of spontaneous sessions in which alums bring topics to discuss, vote to see which topics generate the most interest, and then wade right in for two one-hour sessions of lively conversation. Teneice Delgado (Fall 2006), one of the Un-Conference organizers, describes it thus: “Think: complete and total opposite of AWP. No panels. No invited guests. Everyone is a panelist; all participate.” Two one-hour time slots, each featuring a choice of two discussion sessions, allow participants to choose the topics that interest them most.\n\nDelgado continues, “For those of you unfamiliar with an Un-Conference, it is a very organic process that results in a broader expression of ideas and community built through collaboration. Erin Keane (Spring 2004) and Teneice Delgado will be on hand to facilitate the process. There is no pre-registration and sessions will not be decided until the scheduling time. However, you can use the MFA alumni Facebook page to discuss possible topics and to let us know if you are attending. Please do not plan out sessions beforehand, as this defeats the purpose of an un-conference. Just show up with your topic and an open mind!”\n\n(top)\n\nSpring 2012 Residency Books in Common\n\nIn addition to the Program Book in Common, Jacqueline Woodson’s Hush, students also read a Faculty Book/Script in Common in their area of concentration.
