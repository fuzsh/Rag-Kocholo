        "text": "Sense-Making in Complex Times: Writing in Service to the Collective\n\nOctober 1–29, 2024\n\nJoin us for our third annual Fall Online Writing Program. Immerse yourself in a community of creative beings led by world renowned authors, healers, story tellers, poets and folks who make meaning using the power of words.\n\nIn this month-long writing program, we will come together to answer the following questions:\n\nHow can we use writing as a tool to help us slow down and listen for the truth of our own experience?\n\nHow can we turn to our writing practice to support us to find connection and cultivate clarity within ourselves?\n\nHow can our words help us make meaning and add value in these complex times?\n\nHow do we become visible in the world with our words?\n\nWhat does it look like to write in service to the collective?\n\nWhether you are seeking to connect more with your truth, creativity, hone the practice and habit of writing, deepen your healing journey or publish a book, we invite you to join us for an incredible writing journey with an amazing panel of professional writers from a multitude of backgrounds and disciplines.\n\nWith over 24 hours of curated content with facilitators such as Julia Cameron, Waylon Lewis, Brynn Saito, Eric Maisel, Victoria Erikson and more plus two Writer’s Coffee House sessions and a Share Out Writing Slam at the end, this full immersion can be done live.\n\nNOTE Note Kripalu is delivering this livestream experience through a third party platform.
