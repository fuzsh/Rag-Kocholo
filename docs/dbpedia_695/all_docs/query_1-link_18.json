My strong work ethic was forged on the family farm where …\n\nHope Searches for Rest Read More »\n\nLately, I’ve been thinking a lot about creativity. Partly because I’ve started a new group called Creative Connections. Partly because I learned more about creativity through the books and presentation of Julia Cameron.

Between the third and fourth chapter of the gazillionth revision of my novel. A segue exists somewhere, but I CANNOT find it.

A gap of time to contemplate …\n\nHope Fills in the Gaps Read More »\n\nWhile meeting with my spiritual director, she suggested I consider the questions, “What if?” In one of the workshops I teach, the “What if?” question is presented as a fear tactic artists sometimes use to procrastinate.

An artist date is an intentional setting …\n\nHope Sets Healthy Creative Boundaries Read More »\n\nMany of my friends choose a special word for the year. It helps them focus on annual goals and gives them the motivation they need every day. For some reason, the word of the year has not worked for me. Instead, I hang on to a verse for the year. During the last weeks of …\n\nHope Finds Reality in a Verse Read More »\n\nAs I walked out of Hen House with my groceries, he was loading his trunk with food supplies.

It’s on my bucket list to …\n\nEnchanting Hope Read More »\n\nA national magazine asked me to write an article about becoming emotionally overwhelmed. So I hammered out 1600+ words. Yet, even as I wrote, another reminder of self-care affected my thought processes. It has taken me so many years to believe and write this truth. But one purpose of a blog is to be forthright …\n\nHope Embraces Self-care Read More »\n\nThe month of February has always been difficult for me. Usually, the cold and flu bugs continue their romp so the air is filled with germy spores. This year, we are still in the grip of the insidious COVID-19 pandemic. February’s weather is too cold for leisurely walks, and the ground too frozen for gardens. …\n\nHow to Find Hope in February Read More »\n\nWhen I first read The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron, an a-ha flashed. Through its pages I learned creativity is a gift, a blessing from the Creator to each of his beloved children. The more I recognized my own gift of creativity, the more I began to nurture it.
