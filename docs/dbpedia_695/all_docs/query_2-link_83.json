        "text": "“There There,” Tommy Orange’s polyphonic debut novel, takes its title from Gertrude Stein’s cutting line about Oakland, Calif: “There is no there there.”\n\nMr. Orange, who grew up in Oakland and is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, uses that concave, twisty riddle as his novel’s recurring anthem, a shorthand to describe the disorienting experience of living in America as a self-described “urban Indian.”\n\nFor native people, Mr. Orange writes, cities and towns themselves represent the absence of a homeland — a lost world of “buried ancestral land, glass and concrete and wire and steel, unreturnable covered memory. There is no there there.”\n\nMr. Orange, 36, seems at home with those sorts of paradoxes and contradictions. He grew up straddling two worlds, never quite feeling like he belonged. His father, who spoke Cheyenne as his first language, was a Native American Church ceremony leader. His white mother, a wandering hippie and spiritual seeker, later converted to evangelical Christianity and denounced his father’s religious practices as demonic. Mr. Orange wasn’t sure what to believe — as a boy, he used to worry about the coming apocalypse and spending eternity in hellfire.\n\nWith the highly anticipated “There There,” which Knopf will publish next week, Mr. Orange has written a new kind of Native American epic, one that reflects his ambivalence and the complexity of his upbringing. “There’s been a lot of reservation literature written,” he said. “I wanted to have my characters struggle in the way that I struggled, and the way that I see other native people struggle, with identity and with authenticity.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
