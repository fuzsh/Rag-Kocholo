        "text": "For centuries, this maverick city at the edge of the Southern Rockies has been a cultural crossroads, from Native and Hispano peoples whose oral traditions root them in the landscape to a long line of writers whose work imagines and illuminates the American West and the wider world. What better place to bring together influential authors, thinkers, and passionate readers for an event as unique and inspiring as the city itself?\n\nThe Santa Fe Community Convention Center is a LEED-certified green building in the heart of the capital’s historic downtown and home to the Festival.\n\nThe Tewa Pueblo people who occupied the site beginning in the thirteenth century called these homelands the “Dancing Ground of the Sun.” Later, Spanish and Mexican inhabitants and American soldiers established seats of government and military operations in the area, including the 1610 Palace of the Governors. While in residence there, Territorial Governor Lew Wallace completed his famous 1880 novel Ben-Hur, one of the most popular novels in history.\n\nStories to lift us out of the ordinary.\n\nSanta Fe, a city rich in cultural diversity, creativity, and dazzling light, is home to a four-day event that celebrates our shared love of language and ideas. We’ll explore issues at a time of extraordinary change—in politics, race, immigration, the environment, and more—as well as simply escape into great stories. The Santa Fe International Literary Festival will feed our minds and hearts and send us back into the world inspired."
