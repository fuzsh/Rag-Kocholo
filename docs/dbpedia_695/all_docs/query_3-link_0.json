        "text": "Hailed by the New York Times as \"The Queen of Change,\" Julia Cameron is credited with starting a movement in 1992 that has brought creativity into the mainstream conversationâ€” in the arts, in business, and in everyday life. She is the best-selling author of more than forty books, fiction and nonfiction; a poet, songwriter, filmmaker and playwright. Commonly referred to as \"The Godmother\" or \"High Priestess\" of creativity, her tools are based in practice, not theory, and she considers herself \"the floor sample of her own toolkit.\" The Artist's Way has been translated into forty languages and sold over five million copies to date."
