If you looking for new ways to bring your creative ideas and dreams to life, expand your creative community, and identify the many opportunities that await you, you’ve come to the right place. Regardless of your stage in life, it's never too late to make significant changes.\n\nWith its advocating artistic philosophy and powerful creative tools, the Artist's Way approach is the perfect support system to bolster your courage and give you strategies to turn your creative dreams and desires into finished realities.\n\nAs an experienced creativity coach, I have been teaching Artist's Way creativity courses since Julia Cameron and I first co-produced The Artist's Way Creativity Camp in Taos, New Mexico starting in 1995 and running until 2001. Since then, I've taught hundreds of Artist's Way classes, from small two-hour workshops to weekend retreats, to 12-week courses based on The Artist's Way and other books by Julia Cameron.\n\nI've witnessed firsthand how The Artist's Way's evergreen approach to unblocking creativity works. I've lost count of how many people I've helped achieve their dreams while working with The Artist's Way.\n\nWhen we work together, you'll start and finish The Artist's Way Course which will ground in the Artist's Way tools: morning pages, artist's dates, and walks. Then, as we continue, you'll redefine perfectionism, overcome creative blocks, and develop a strategy to push your artistic work forward with a sense of drive and purpose. Finally, we'll design a manageable creative strategy to support your sense of purpose, vitality, and confidence as you build your creative projects into the world.\n\nRemember, it's never too late to begin again. I look forward to talking with you. Your first Artist’s Way session is free. Let's talk and see if our styles fit.\n\nCreativity Coaching Inquiry\n\nName *\n\nEmail *\n\nPhone\n\nOptional, if you'd like to receive a call back.\n\nTell me more about what you're looking for from a creativity coach. *\n\nThank you!"
