Led by a brilliant but ill-tempered radical named Ricardo Flores Magón, the magonistas were a motley band of journalists, miners, migrant workers, and more, who organized thousands of Mexican workers—and American dissidents—to their cause. Determined to oust Mexico’s dictator, Porfirio Díaz, who encouraged the plunder of his country by U.S. imperialists such as Guggenheim and Rockefeller, the rebels had to outrun and outsmart the swarm of U. S. authorities vested in protecting the Diaz regime. The U.S. Departments of War, State, Treasury, and Justice as well as police, sheriffs, and spies, hunted the magonistas across the country. Capturing Ricardo Flores Magón was one of the FBI’s first cases.\n\nLong ignored by textbooks, the magonistas threatened to undo the rise of Anglo-American power, on both sides of the border, and inspired a revolution that gave birth to the Mexican-American population, making the magonistas’ story integral to modern American life.\n\nKelly Lytle Hernández is The Thomas E. Lifka Endowed Chair in History at UCLA. One of the nation’s leading scholars of race, immigration, and mass incarceration, she is the author of Migra! A History of the U.S. Border Patrol (University of California Press 2010) and City of Inmates: Conquest, Rebellion, and the Rise of Human Caging in Los Angeles (University of North Carolina Press, 2017). She reframes our understanding of U.S. history in her groundbreaking book, Bad Mexicans: Race, Empire, and Revolution in the Borderlands (W.W. Norton, May 2022). In 2019, Professor Lytle Hernández was named a MacArthur “Genius” Fellow for her historical and contemporary work.\n\nMarissa López is Associate Graduate Dean and Professor of English and Chicana/o Studies at UCLA, researching Chicanx literature from the 19th century to the present with an emphasis on 19th century Mexican California. She has written two books: Chicano Nations (NYU 2011) is about nationalism and Chicanx literature from the early-1800s to post-9/11; Racial Immanence (NYU 2019) explores uses of the body and affect in Chicanx cultural production. She recently completed a year-long residency at the Los Angeles Public Library as a Scholars & Society fellow with the American Council of Learned Societies.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, book purchase, and details.\n\nWhere: Skylight Bookstore\n\nDate: Monday the 23rd\n\nTime: 7 pm\n\nAddress: 1818 N.

Featuring authors:\n\nKat Cho Kat Cho (she/her) used to hide books under the bathroom sink and then sneak in there to read after bedtime. Her parents pretended not to know. This helped when she decided to write a dinosaur time-travel novel at the tender age of nine. Sadly, that book was not published. She currently lives and works in NYC and spends her free time trying to figure out what kind of puppy to adopt. Kat is the international bestselling author of Wicked Fox and Vicious Spirits (Putnam/Peguin). As well as the webcomic, Free Hexel, and the YA romcom, Once Upon a K-Prom (Disney).\n\nStephan Lee is a journalist, author, and multi-fandom K-pop stan. He currently works as Senior Editor at Bustle after a five-year stretch covering books and movies at Entertainment Weekly. At EW, he traveled to Seoul for three weeks to write a feature about Korean entertainment’s world domination, interviewing K-pop idols, filmmakers, and drama writers. He earned an MFA in Creative Writing at The New School. His debut novel is K-POP CONFIDENTIAL.\n\nGrace K. Shim grew up in Tulsa Oklahoma as one of two Korean-Americans at her high school (her sister was the other one). Today, Grace writes books with Korean-American protagonists that she wished she had read about as a teen. When she’s not plotting (the writing kind, not the world domination kind), you can find her wearing a Korean sheet mask, baking French macarons, and unintentionally killing house plants & succulents. She lives in the Bay Area with her husband and three kids. She is the author of The Noh Family.\n\nSusan Lee has built a career as a Human Resources executive at successful startups such as Spotify and Warby Parker. Her biggest job takeaway: we are all, for the most part, ridiculous. And she channels this into her writing of light-hearted, quirky novels about the oftentimes hilarious human condition. Susan is a 2018 PitchWars alum, a 2019 & 2020 PitchWars mentor, a 2019 Romance Writers of America Golden Heart® winner, and an avid K-pop and K-drama fan. Her bias is V/Taehyung, which for those in the know, explains it all. She is the author of Seoulmates.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines and event details.\n\nWhere: Book Soup\n\nDate: Wednesday 25th\n\nTime: 6 pm\n\nAddress: 8818 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, CA 90069\n\nWebsite: https://www.booksoup.com/event/korean-american-authors\n\nMothers/Madres Write Workshop with Rosalilia M.

Tonight’s featured event is the George Floyd Anthology. See comments for details:\n\n“The tragic and unnecessary death of George Floyd has allowed poets, and artists to memorialize him and other Black men and women who’ve been victims of police brutality. This is our job: we language things to grow, and grow up from that moment, that incident. It’s how we transcend the sorrow and the unbelievability of injustice against us.”\n\n—Shonda Buchanan Poet / Publisher Black Indian\n\n“A little over 100 years ago, Countee Cullen wrote his stirring poem, “If We Must Die,” which served as a signifier to speak against injustices facing African Americans. Itwas a healing poem. Thus, the Harlem Renaissance was born as a mechanism to address racism while sharing beauty and grace. In similar fashion, the words found in this tome spark the imagination, expressing frustration, pain, action, change, hope. In this anthology, these words fight back and dignify George Floyd’s legacy. Flip to any poem and let the healing begin. Flip to any poem to find Floyd’s urgency calling out towards you.”\n\n— F. Douglas Brown\n\nTeacher / Poet\n\nSee site for details and/or to verify.\n\n$4 cover fee, cash only.

From backstage and onstage, she carries us through both the serendipitous history and physical intricacies and demands of Serenade: its dazzling opening, with seventeen women in a double-diamond pattern; its radical, even jazzy, use of the highly refined language that is ballet; its place in the choreographer’s own dramatic story of immigration to the United States from Soviet Russia; its profound influence on the art form internationally.\n\nBentley takes us inside the rarefied, intense, and thrilling world Balanchine created through his lifelong devotion to celebrating and expanding female beauty and strength—a world that, inevitably, passed upon his death.\n\nToni Bentley danced with George Balanchine’s New York City Ballet for ten years. She is the author of five books, all named “Notable” by the New York Times, which include Winter Season: A Dancer’s Journal, Holding On to the Air (the autobiography of Suzanne Farrell, co-authored with Farrell), Costumes by Karinska, Sisters of Salome, and The Surrender: An Erotic Memoir. Bentley is the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship, and her work has appeared in Best American Essays, as well as in many periodicals, among them the New York Times Book Review, Wall Street Journal, The New Republic, Playboy, The Daily Beast, Vogue, and Vanity Fair.\n\nLeslie Zemeckis is a best-selling author, actress, and award-winning documentarian. She is the author of three best-sellers, Behind the Burly Q, Goddess of Love Incarnate; the Life of Stripteuse Lili St. Cyr. and Feuding Fan Dancers.
