New Mexico Writers is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and connecting the state’s literary community.

Our annual dinner, now in its sixth year, brings established and aspiring writers together to celebrate and inspire each other.

In addition to the annual dinner, we publish a monthly newsletter that features literary happenings throughout the state, including book releases, readings, workshops, grant opportunities, and more.

We’re also working to strengthen collaborations with state government, schools, and other entities who can help us connect the state’s literary community and its aspiring writers.

In today’s world, literary voices are more important than ever. New Mexico Writers is committed to supporting the diverse and original writers who populate our state and to continuing its long tradition of literary excellence and creative community.
