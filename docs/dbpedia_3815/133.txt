THE SAMOAN CRISIS 1888-89

The Samoan Crisis involved a confrontation between the United States and the Imperial German Navy with Great Britain choosing to observe. While a civil war, fostered by German agents, raged ashore, the American warships: USS Vandalia, a screw sloop, USS Trenton, a 3900 ton steam frigate, and USS Nipsic, a 1375 ton Adam-class gunboat, squared off against the Imperial German warships: SMS Adler, a 1040 ton gunboat, SMS Olga, a 2424 ton Carol-class corvette, and SMS Eber, a 735 ton ironclad gunboat, in Apia Harbor. The British warship HMS Calliope, a Calypso-class corvette, was also in the harbor to observe.

During December 1888, a landing party from the Olga and the Eber engaged the Samoans. A German officer and 15 men were killed and another officer and 38 men were wounded in the fighting. During early March 1889, the Germans shelled a rebel village.

The standoff continued until March 15-16, 1889 when the 1889 Apia Cyclone sunk or disabled all six American and German ships. Only the Nipsic and the Olga survived the storm, but both were driven ashore by the storm and badly damaged. The Calliope, slipped its anchor and barely able to clear the harbor and survive the storm. The Samoan Civil War eventually resulted in the Tripartite Convention of 1899 and the eventual partition of the islands into American Samoa and German Samoa. German Samoa was eventually lost to the United Kingdom as a result of WW I when it was quickly occupied by New Zealand troops.

Imperial German Medals

The German naval forces were issued the Colonial Medal with the rare Samoa 1888 bar authorized in 1912. A total of 482 were authorized, but approximately 350+ were awarded due to the loss of life and the time lag until the issuance of the medal in 1912.
