        "text": "RCA is a twelve-month maximum, needs-based cash benefit for refugees and other eligible beneficiaries who are not eligible for other cash assistance programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The twelve months start from the date of the refugee's entry into the U.S. and end on the first day of the thirteenth month after entry. The arrival month is included in the twelve-month count.\n\nRefugees entering Arizona, as a rule, first contact a Voluntary Agency (VOLAG). The VOLAG is responsible for determining eligibility for Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA). The VOLAGs are also responsible for issuing TANF Differential Payment. This is a supplemental payment for refugee households who are not eligible for RCA but receive TANF from the Family Assistance Administration (FAA). The TANF Differential payment is also valid only during the refugee household's first twelve months in the U.S.\n\nVOLAG staff assists the refugee in completing the official Family Assistance Administration (FAA) application when any of the following applies:\n\nThe VOLAG determines that a refugee household is not eligible for RCA\n\nThe refugee household may be eligible for Nutrition Assistance (NA), Cash Assistance (CA), or Medical Assistance (MA) programs from FAA\n\nFor VOLAG's contact information see Contact Information see Arizona Refugee Resettlement Program Resources - Local Partners.\n\nRMA is a twelve-month maximum health benefit program for refugees and other eligible beneficiaries who are denied Arizona Medicaid (AHCCCS) upon arrival and who fall below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, or who have had their Arizona Medicaid coverage terminated due to income from employment that exceeds the Arizona Medicaid income eligibility standards.\n\nRMA also funds coordination of the U.S. Domestic Medical Examination for Newly Arriving Refugees that identifies persons with communicable diseases of potential public health significance, enables refugees to successfully resettle by identifying health conditions that may threaten their wellbeing, and ensures proper follow-up for refugees with medical conditions identified overseas through referrals to medical providers.\n\nView Arizona Refugee Medical Assistance Provider Manual - Updated December 2020\n\nDomestic Medical Examination Service Providers\n\nMaricopa County Department of Public Health\n\n1645 E Roosevelt St.\n\nPhoenix, AZ 85006\n\n(602) 372-1013\n\nThe U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services identify refugee children from birth to age 18 who are without a parent/guardian and are eligible for resettlement in the U.S as an unaccompanied refugee minor. Upon arrival in the U.S., these refugee children are placed into the URM program to receive safe and nurturing foster care placement along with other services and benefits.\n\nThe Unaccompanied Refugee Minors Program is currently coordinated through Catholic Charities.\n\nContact Information\n\nCatholic Charities\n\n(602) 997-6105"
