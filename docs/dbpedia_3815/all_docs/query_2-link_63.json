        "text": "From 1887-1889 Germany and the United States were staring one another down over keeping one another at bay in Apia Harbor, with the British monitoring the situation. Ultimately, Germany and the US partitioned the archipelago in 1890.\n\nWhat if the US and Germany had gone to war?\n\nI imagine the US would try to annex Hawaii a few years early like with the Spanish-American War.\n\nGermany's pacific holdings at this time are German New Guinea (including the North Solomon Islands), Marshall Islands, and Nauru.\n\nFor the US is War Plan Black, a few years early, for the Germans its the war plan the kaiser ordered up in that general era. I don't think the German plan as written was very practical, it may have fallen by the wayside swiftly & some other strategy chosen.\n\nWhat if the US and Germany had gone to war?\n\nUSN was a Joke at this time, the 'New Navy' ABCDs, two small 3000 ton 13 knot protected cruisers, a slightly larger cruiser, and a dispatch boat.\n\nNot quite the terror of the Seas.\n\nThat's it for modern ships, the previous newest ship, the Trenton, was a wooden hulled 4000 ton sailship with auxiliary steam power, a throwback to pre-civil war ideas on what 'real' ships were. The only real modern thing about that ship, was it had electric lighting. The guns were civil war muzzle loaders, the 9\" Dahlgren sleeved to make a basic 8\" rifled gun.\n\nThat's it for innovations.\n\nThe rest of the civil war monitors were laid up, or 'rebuilt' that was a way to enrich the shipyards and the politicians support that fraud. The USN was spending more on these repairs that what new steel hulled ships would have cost.\n\nFrom 1887-1889 Germany and the United States were staring one another down over keeping one another at bay in Apia Harbor, with the British monitoring the situation. Ultimately, Germany and the US partitioned the archipelago in 1890.\n\nWhat if the US and Germany had gone to war?\n\nI imagine the US would try to annex Hawaii a few years early like with the Spanish-American War.\n\nGermany's pacific holdings at this time are German New Guinea (including the North Solomon Islands), Marshall Islands, and Nauru.\n\nHow would Japan react ?\n\ni suspect that Great Britain, seeing two of its rivals in conflict, would take steps to bring Hawaii into its orbit by making guarantees to the Hawaiian royals,\n\nUK always wanted Hawaii to be an independent Monarchy. Problem is, with a real War going on, US desire for a secure Coaling base would push for annexation in a hurry, and the Queen just wasn't good at politics, and it's doubtful the UK would do anymore than protest.\n\nBut if the Brits get a base at Pearl in exchange for supporting the monarchy, there is no way the US could or would pick a fight. For one, the RN vastly outclassed the USN. Secondly, US domestic political opposition would be fierce."
