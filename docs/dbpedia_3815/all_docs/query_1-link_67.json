        "text": "Samoa's beleaguered Caretaker Prime Minister has refused to concede leadership of the Pacific nation, despite the woman who won last month's election being sworn in at a makeshift ceremony on Monday.\n\nBoth sides have accused each other of staging a coup, with incumbent Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, who has been in power for more than 22 years, saying he remains Caretaker Prime Minister despite numerous court cases disputing his interpretation of the law.\n\n\"This is what happened: They have broken the law, they have disgraced the chief justice, they have disgraced our country,\" Tuilaepa said of his political rivals, in comments translated from Samoan by broadcaster RNZ.\n\nHis remarks came a day after Tuilaepa's political opponent, Fiame Naomi Mata’afa, and her FAST Party were barred from entering Parliament, and instead took their oaths of office under a large tent outside the building.\n\nFiame was declared Samoa's first female Prime Minister during the unusual ceremony.\n\n“There will be a time when we will meet again inside that House. Let us leave it to the law,\" Fiame told supporters who had gathered outside Parliament.\n\nTuilaepa has called the swearing-in ceremony an act of \"treason\" and a \"coup\", and accused the nation's judiciary of being biased.\n\n\"The courts have caused this problem, with no solution in sight,\" Tuilaepa said.\n\n\"FAST have usurped and taken the duties of our government and the duties of the clerk of the Legislative Assembly, and as such they should be charged. This is treason.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court had earlier ordered the Parliament to convene on Monday after the nation's head of state, Tuimalealiifano Va'aletoa Sualauvi II, attempted to cancel the sitting without explanation.\n\nSamoa's constitution requires elected representatives to meet within 45 days of an election. May 24 is the final day by that count.\n\nWorld reacts to Samoa's political drama\n\nSamoa's bitter political battle has left both Fiame and Tuilaepa each claiming they are the rightful prime minister of the country.\n\n\"Samoans inside Samoa and around the world wake up to the fact that there are two Prime Ministers,\" George Carter from the Australian National University (ANU) said.\n\nMany leaders around the world have declined to take sides in Samoa's leadership scandal.\n\nThe United Nations secretary-general, through a spokesperson, said he \"urges the leaders in Samoa to find solutions to the current political situation through dialogue in the best interest of the people and institutions of Samoa\".\n\nThe first nation to formally recognise Fiame as Prime Minister was the small Pacific archipelago of the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nPresident David Panuelo said his government had drawn from its experience of the United States and former president Donald Trump's refusal to leave office in making the announcement.\n\n\"The FSM announced its support for the newly sworn-in Prime Minister Fiame for the same reasons that we denounce former US president Donald Trump for his embrace of fascism and rejection of democracy,\" Mr Panuelo said.\n\nHe urged other democratic countries to show their support for Samoa's elected leader.\n\n\"I didn't mean to come in as the first country to recognise the newly sworn-in Prime Minister. I was just doing what I think is right.\"\n\nThe Pacific Islands Forum secretary-general Henry Puna called for \"a moment of reflection and solidarity\" for Samoa amid the \"post-election events\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Pacific's first female leader, former Marshall Islands president Hilda Heine called Fiame Samoa's \"duly elected\" Prime Minister.\n\n\"Congratulations PM Fiame Naomi Mata'afa! Stay strong and unwavering in your legitimacy as the duly elected Samoa PM!\" Dr Heine said in a tweet.\n\n\"The facts of the election stand. Your win is a win for Pacific women. The political wrangling, fueled [sic] by entrenched resistance to change is sad but not surprising.\"\n\nAn advocate for women's equality, Fiame broke new ground during her campaign by going on the road and robustly criticising the incumbent.\n\nHer election win was widely considered a step forward for gender equality in the Pacific, which has few female leaders.\n\nSupporters rally around Fiame as Prime Minister\n\nThe courts continue to be drawn into Samoa's political battle, with elected Prime Minister Fiame and two other members of her party pleading \"not guilty\" this morning to a private prosecution brought by Tuilaepa, according to broadcaster RNZ.\n\nThe case was filed more than a week ago, over allegations stemming from the election campaign.\n\nFAST Party lawyer and former attorney-general Taulupapa Brenda Heather-Latu said \"bah-humbug\" to Tuilaepa's charges of treason and illegality, saying he had been \"misusing the law\" for his own political ends.\n\n\"We've spent the last four weeks in court upending all of the grubby and dirty and illegal actions that have been taken by this caretaker government and its complicit officials,\" Taulupapa told the ABC.\n\n\"He's [Tuilaepa's] acting through weak sycophants and officials that have forgotten that they're there to serve the public and not a dictator.\"\n\nDr Carter from ANU, who is also a former political adviser, said Samoa's political leaders would now have to go through \"dialogue\" and \"reconciliation\" to overcome the crisis.\n\n\"Samoa is still at peace, its people are not under any duress,\" Dr Carter said.\n\nLast month's election initially ended in a 25-25 tie between Fiame's FAST Party and Tuilaepa’s HRPP, with one independent candidate.\n\nThe independent candidate chose to go with Fiame, but meanwhile, the electoral commissioner appointed another HRPP candidate, saying it was required to conform to gender quotas.\n\nThat made it 26-26.\n\nThe head of state then stepped in to announce fresh elections to break the tie. Those elections in the nation of 200,000 were scheduled to be held last week.\n\nBut Fiame’s party appealed and the Supreme Court ruled against both the appointed candidate and the plans for the new elections, restoring the FAST Party to a 26-25 majority."
