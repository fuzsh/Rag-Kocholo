        "text": "The idyllic South Pacific islands of Samoa seem an odd spot for colonial conflict. Yet the German Empire and the US nearly went to war over control of the archipelago. In 1889 the series of islands, thousands of miles from the US and German capitals, became the center of colonial machinations – until nature intervened and altered the course of history.
