        "text": "Samoa has been plunged into fresh political turmoil, with two rival political leaders claiming they are prime minister of the Pacific nation.\n\nIt comes after the majority FAST party, that was expected to form a new government for the first time in almost four decades on Monday, was blocked from entering Parliament this morning to begin the swearing-in process.\n\nParty members decided to instead conduct their own ceremony in a large tent outside the Parliament, with leader Fiame Naomi Mata'afa declaring herself as Samoa's first female prime minister.\n\nCaretaker Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi deemed the move unlawful, and has said his Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) remains the government.\n\nIt is the latest scene from a deepening constitutional crisis in the Pacific nation, which saw the Supreme Court intervene yesterday to overturn an attempt by the head of state to cancel parliamentary sitting without explanation.\n\nBut Tuilaepa, who has held power for more than 22 years, contradicted the court's ruling, saying that only the head of state had the power to convene parliament.\n\nTuilaepa said in a press conference \"the Devil has won and taken over\" and that people asking him to concede \"need to come to us and beg\".\n\n\"Only the Head of State, and no one else, can call parliament meetings and swear people in. None of what they [FAST party] did is legitimate,\" he said in statements translated from Samoan by broadcaster RNZ.\n\n\"I didn't know we had the Mafia here in Samoa. I thought it was just in Italy.\"\n\nIt comes amid accusations Tuilaepa and his political supporters are rejecting the democratic handover of leadership.\n\n\"He is holding onto power unfortunately ... and weaponising the constitution,\" said journalist Lagipoiva Cherelle Jackson.\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne has taken to Twitter to say Australia has \"faith\" in the country's judiciary.\n\n\"We have faith in Samoa's institutions including the judiciary.\"\n\nLabor MP Pat Conroy said he was \"greatly concerned\" by what was unfolding in Samoa.\n\n\"The Samoan people expressed their will at the election recently. I call on all sides of politics to respect that expression and use the court process as appropriate,\" Mr Conroy said.\n\n\"I think the people of Samoa made their views clear and every participant in the Samoan political system should respect that will.\"\n\nIn New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her government's position was to \"simply to support Samoa's institutions and its democracy\".\n\n\"We have faith in Samoa's democracy and in their institutions,\" Ms Ardern told New Zealand broadcaster RNZ.\n\nFears of brewing coup as PM refuses to concede\n\nMeanwhile, a party spokesman has described this morning's events as a \"coup\".\n\n\"Democracy must prevail, always,\" the FAST party said in a Facebook post.\n\n\"There can be no exceptions from this fundamental principle. Those who claim otherwise and act accordingly play with fire.\"\n\nSamoan lawyer Fiona Ey said the actions by the incumbent prime minister were a \"blatant grab for power\".\n\n\"We are now starting to see the breakdown in their respect for the rule of law,\" Ms Ey said.\n\nSamoa's constitutions states that parliament must sit no later than 45 days after the election, which should have been on Monday.\n\nThe six weeks since the April 9 election have been dominated by a political deadlock, that ended with FAST and the HRPP locked at 25 seats each with one independent in the 51-seat parliament.\n\nWhen the independent sided with FAST, Prime Minister Tuilaepa boosted his numbers by adding an extra MP to his party under provisions setting out the minimum quota of women in parliament.\n\nHe then pushed for a second election for May 21.\n\nThe courts overturned both measures and a panel of appeal judges on Friday rejected HRPP's bid for a stay on the rulings.\n\nTuilaepa has insisted the HRPP still has the numbers to lead the nation of 220,000.\n\nBefore a meeting in chambers with FAST and the HRPP yesterday, Fiame urged for legal rulings to be followed.\n\n\"The refusal to accept defeat has moved from obstruction and defiance by the caretaker prime minister … to a complete disregard for the law,\" she said."
