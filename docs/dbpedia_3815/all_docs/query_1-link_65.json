        "text": "journal contribution\n\nposted on 2023-02-13, 21:26 authored by Jonathan FraenkelJonathan Fraenkel\n\nIn 2021, SÄmoa witnessed its first change of government since the 1980s. The April election result entailed a narrow defeat for the governing Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP). This triggered a major constitutional crisis and a succession of legal battles over the 10 per cent quota for women in parliament and over the powers of the head of state, who had attempted to cancel the election. This paper examines the election outcome, how this was influenced by changing electoral laws, and why the newly formed Faâatuatua I Le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (FAST) party was able to mount such a strong challenge to the HRPP. The paper argues that the central issue during the campaignâthe HRPP's reforms to reconfigure the Land and Titles Courtâwas not (as widely depicted) a dispute over âcommunal' versus âindividual rightsâ but rather one over two conflicting visions of centralized control.\n\nHistory"
