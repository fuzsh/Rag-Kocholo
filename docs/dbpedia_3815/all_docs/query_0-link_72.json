        "text": "Samoa consists of nine islands in the South Pacific, the two largest of which are Upolu, where the capital, Apia, is located, and Savai’i, which has a total land area of 2.8 square kilometers. Samoa has a narrowly based economy and, like many of the Pacific island countries, is highly vulnerable to weather-related shocks. It is heavily dependent on private remittances, which are equivalent to about 25 percent of GDP, to finance consumption and on official transfers to finance investment. Expatriates tend to maintain very strong ties with their families, villages, and churches, and this is true even among second-generation migrants. Emigration, which is primarily to Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, has kept the population stable at roughly 180,000 over the past decade. The political system is based on a parliamentary system of democracy and is stable.\n\nMonetary and Exchange Rate Management\n\nBefore the 1996 structural reforms, direct controls on interest rates and credit had inhibited financial sector competition and monetary policy implementation in Samoa. The controls resulted in artificially low deposit interest rates, which contracted savings, and rigid loan rates, which precluded risk-based credit pricing. Combined with volatile inflation, this caused wide fluctuations in real deposit and lending rates, constraining the level and efficiency of financial sector activity. In addition, supervision was weak, with only limited supervisory capacity at the central bank and no effective supervision of nonbank financial institutions.\n\nFinancial sector liberalization and the introduction of indirect monetary policy instruments were a major part of the 1996 structural reform program. All credit ceilings and interest rate controls were removed in 1998. Auctions of central bank bills began and became the primary monetary policy instrument. In addition, the liquid asset requirement was reduced and eventually abolished in 1999. These changes had a positive impact on financial institutions and markets. Credit to the private sector grew more rapidly, and banks’ profitability improved. Programs were launched to strengthen the central bank’s capacity to undertake prudential supervision, including for nonbank financial institutions and insurance companies. These liberalization measures facilitated faster real GDP growth during 1999-2003. Credit growth, in combination with sales of central bank bills, substantially reduced excess liquidity in the banking system. The Central Bank of Samoa then eased monetary policy in order to support economic activity following the 2004 cyclone.\n\nMonetary policy is conducted in the context of a pegged exchange rate arrangement supported by capital controls, with the tala linked to a basket of currencies based on transaction-weighted trade, remittances, and tourism receipts. This regime has served well as a nominal anchor. The central bank periodically makes adjustments in the value of the tala within a plus or minus 2 percent band in order to strike a balance between maintaining external competitiveness and preserving the exchange rate peg’s role as an anchor for inflation.\n\nRegional indicators, despite some recent appreciation, do not signal an overvaluation of the tala nor do they suggest any loss of competitiveness within the region. External current account surpluses were recorded during 1998-2004, and official reserves were adequate. Export growth has stalled over the last few years, but this was due not to a lack of competitiveness and/or movements in prices and costs out of line with Samoa’s major trading partners, but rather to the effects of unfavorable weather on fishing, which remains the largest export industry. There are plans to build more efficient landing and docking facilities to assist the fishing industry, and there are efforts to shift toward new export crops, although improvements in the agricultural sector are likely to be gradual. New Zealand recently entered an agreement to enhance Samoa’s market access for higher-value-added goods, including organic crops and processed food, and to help diversify the export base. The Samoa Tourism Development plan seeks to strengthen this sector, which is seen as a promising engine for growth and is underdeveloped compared to some Pacific islands. Tourism will get a boost if the recent Polynesian Airlines merger is successful in lowering the high airfares. Remittances are expected to remain substantial.\n\nThe Financial Sector\n\nThe financial sector remains sound, and progress has been made in strengthening the supervisory framework, as noted. The four commercial banks, two of which are subsidiaries of major Australian banks, have a joint market share of over 75 percent of total banking system assets, are adequately capitalized, and are in compliance with the 15 percent capital adequacy requirement. The central bank’s current practice is to conduct examinations through external auditors and extensive off-site monitoring, along the lines of the New Zealand model, and this is effective. Information is shared among the central bank, the external auditors, and the foreign banks, whose parent institutions maintain strong internal controls on their subsidiaries, and this reduces the need for an extensive on-site monitoring.\n\nSamoa continues to make progress in tightening the regulatory requirements for offshore banks and strengthening the framework for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). The international banking bill approved by parliament in 2005 requires all offshore banks to establish a physical presence in Samoa and established an International Financial Authority as the supervisory agency for the offshore banks. An AML/CFT bill also was passed in 2005.\n\nThe authorities are reviewing the role and investment guidelines of the National Provident Fund (NPF) and are strengthening its supervisory framework. Its assets are now skewed in favor of short-term loans to members and to various public sector projects, and these borrowers can access about 50 percent of their outstanding balances, using their balances as collateral, because of the lack of long-term investment opportunities in the private sector. Thus, the government in 2005 gave the NPF the authority to invest abroad about 1½ percent of GDP or about 7 percent of its total assets.\n\nStructural Policies\n\nThe public sector still dominates the economy, accounting for about 40 percent of both GDP and total employment. The goal is to reduce this share and enhance the contribution of the private sector to stimulate growth. The policy framework focuses on incorporation for state enterprises of strategic public interest, including power, ports, and water, and privatization for state enterprises in nonstrategic sectors. The Public Bodies Act stipulates that all enterprises be run on strict commercial principles. There are plans to inject more competition into the telecommunications sector, supported by an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nThe reform program has helped improve the business and investment climate, but there are constraints on private sector activity that need to be addressed. Poor infrastructure is a concern, although public investment has been increased for road construction, telecommunications, and port development. Approval procedures for new businesses (domestic or foreign-owned) remain lengthy, and a one-stop shop is to be established to alleviate these bottlenecks. Addressing such structural weaknesses is critical not only to stimulate domestic employment and growth but also to invigorate and diversify the export base.\n\nLand reform is important for private sector development. Most of the sites suitable for commercial development are on communal land, but the constitution bars the sale of communal land for commercial purposes. The challenge is to build an institutional and legal framework capable of sustaining an efficient lease market, while safeguarding the interests of the local community and protecting investors.\n\nTrade has been liberalized, and there has been progress toward accession to the World Trade Organization. Since 1998, the maximum tariff rate has been reduced from 60 percent to 20 percent, the tariff schedule has been simplified to four rates, and rates of 35-42 percent have been reduced in several steps to 8 percent. Samoa is a founding member of PICTA, which aims to eliminate all intraregional tariffs by 2011. Samoa is also a participant in the negotiations currently under way for new access to the EU market through reciprocal Economic Partnership Agreements, which are expected to take effect in 2008."
