        "text": "On June 16, 1774, James Cook became the first European to catch sight of a tiny coral island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Navigators from Samoa and Tonga had settled Niue, as the island is known today, as early as 900 CE. Cook attempted to land in Niue no fewer than three times, but was kept at bay by the local inhabitants, painted in what looked like red blood. He named the unwelcoming place ‘Savage Island’ and sailed on. Nearly a century after Cook’s brief visit, more determined Spanish-speaking captains made landfall in Niue and kidnapped forty men to work in the silver mines and guano fields of Peru. One of these men was Taole, son of Hegatule. As High Chief of Avatele in the island’s southwest, Hegatule was a powerful man, but he stood powerless when a Peruvian ship took his son away. A three-masted, 400-ton barque, the Rosa Patricia was under the command of the Spanish Captain Marutani, who rivaled Cook’s dictatorial manners and outmatched his ruthlessness. As the flagship of a veritable fleet, the vessel had left the Peruvian port of Callao in early December 1862 in search of laborers from Pacific islands. After stops in Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and the Cook Islands, the Rosa Patricia reached Niue in January 1863.\n\nWhen Taole and his fellow captives tried to escape from the ship, he was stunned by a blow to his head and thrown back into the hold. As he remembered years later, “three of our men were killed in the struggle, and two others were terribly wounded; and overboard they went, dead and dying.” Closely guarded by armed crewmembers, Taole remained locked under deck, as the brig continued its journey through Samoa and Tokelau. After a dreadful voyage across the vast Pacific Ocean, Taole finally reached the port of Callao, close to Peru’s capital Lima. Taole was made to work at the port, “digging and carrying stones, and carrying and wheeling loads of cargo for the ships.” Most of his fellow captives worked as domestic servants in town or as agricultural laborers in the cotton plantations further inland. “We worked every day, every day. We received no pay. We were worked until we nearly died,” Taole later recounted.\n\nOne day, years after his arrival, Taole was working on the Callao wharves, still under the watchful eyes of the Peruvian guards, when a whaling ship under the U.S. flag anchored at the port. As was common for U.S. whalers at the time, part of the crew consisted of Native Hawai’ians from Oahu. Taole struck up a conversation with a number of these fellow Polynesians and told them that he was forcefully taken from his native Niue and brought to work in Callao. Together, Taole and the sympathetic Hawai’ians pleaded the ship captain, who agreed to help him. Dressed in sailor’s clothes, Taole was smuggled past armed Peruvian guards on board the whaler, which immediately made off. A government vessel followed in hot pursuit, but the U.S. whaler eventually escaped. In Taole’s ecstatic words: “The government had given up the chase, and I, Taole, the slave, was now a sailorman and free!”\n\nThe whaler sailed north toward the Gulf of Alaska to hunt for whales, making Taole “all but perish in the terrible cold.” Then, leaving the subarctic latitudes, the ship turned south and Taole began working as a harpooner. After some successful hunts, the whaler continued south and finally reached Honolulu where Taole disembarked and stayed for a few years. Taole continued his life as a sailor, went to Starbuck Island to work for a British settler—this time voluntarily—and finally made it back to his home in Niue. After an odyssey through the Pacific, his return overwhelmed Taole: “I threw myself down and wept when I stepped ashore once more on the island of my birth.” Taole told the story of his spectacular escape from Peru wherever he went, and it has been retold many times and with many variations since. The ‘happy ending’ of Taole’s story fulfilled an important symbolic function for Pacific Islanders who craved it as evidence for successful, if rare, resistance against their exploitation by European and American outlanders. But as the liberatory U.S. whaling ship indicates, Taole’s story also offers a unique window into the Pacific World and the ambiguous roles Americans played in it.\n\nThe Civil War, Pacific Trade, and the Rise and Fall of Whaling\n\nThe mid-nineteenth century was a time of crisis around the Pacific. From the Taiping rebels in southern China to the Civil War in the United States, violence and social upheaval threatened the cohesion of entire societies. One of the lesser-known global effects of the U.S. Civil War was an increased demand in cotton around the world. As a result, cotton planters in places like Peru needed more workers to cultivate their expanding plantations. In the 1860s, the legal emancipation of African American slaves gave way to other systems of unfree labor around the Pacific and elsewhere. Taole was just one of many Pacific Islanders (and Chinese) pressed into work on plantations, ports, and domestic service around the Pacific.\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, long-standing U.S. trade links across the Pacific received renewed interest. Trade between North America and East Asia had reached back almost two centuries. As early as the late seventeenth century, ideas and commodities from East Asia, particularly from China, circulated in colonial America. From Boston to Philadelphia, colonial Americans were fascinated by China and were busy collecting china. This trade with China intensified after U.S. independence and throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, as the British forcefully opened up China to outside trade during the Opium Wars. By the 1850s, Lincoln’s future Secretary of State William H. Seward had become one of the most vocal supporters of U.S. trade in the Pacific. In several speeches, Seward supported the admission of California into the Union and called for the formal extension of the U.S. empire in the region. With the acquisition of Alaska from Russia and the annexation of the Midway Islands in 1867, the age of more formal U.S. imperialism in the Pacific had begun. As Seward well knew, U.S. whalers had been laying the groundwork for the Pacific trade for decades. And by the 1860s, the dusk of the U.S. whaling industry had given way to the dawn of U.S. empire in the Pacific."
