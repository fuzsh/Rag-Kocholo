        "text": "9 December 2023, Dubai UAE - Samoa, as the Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), has called for a political declaration in response to the findings of the Global Stocktake (GST) as climate change negotiations continue at the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP28) in Dubai, UAE.\n\nThe GST is a process for countries and stakeholders to see where they’re collectively making progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement – and where they’re not.\n\nSpeaking during the resumed High Level Segment of COP28 on Saturday, Samoa’s Minister of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE), Hon. Toeolesulusulu Cedric Schuster, said AOSIS is extremely concerned about the pace of the negotiations.\n\n“Time is not on our side, and we must act fast and diligently with the limited time we have left here in Dubai. The first pillar AOSIS sees is delivery of a robust and effective outcome to the first Global Stocktake. We know that these stocktakes will happen every five years but this is the one that matters for keeping the 1.5C limit within reach,” Hon. Toeolesulusulu said.\n\n“We must lean into international cooperation and multilateralism to pave the way to these new development pathways. To galvanize this international cooperation, we will need to send a strong message to the outside world, one that resonates beyond these four walls.\n\n“This is why SIDS are calling for a high level political declaration in response to the findings of the global stocktake. We have a responsibility to send a clear message to the rest of the world on the actions that must be taken to accelerate and improve climate action. Without this, the outcomes of this first GST risk fading into obscurity.”\n\nAfter a week of technical-level negotiations, the political phase of the Dubai Climate Change Conference has begun. Negotiators are aiming to agree on how to bolster emissions-cutting targets set by the Paris Agreement and what to do about the future of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal.\n\nBut all eyes are on countries’ ability to use the conclusions of the global stocktake – an in-depth look at how far the world has come since adopting the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement and what’s to be done next – as a springboard towards more ambitious climate action plans.\n\nAccording to Minister Toeolesulusulu, the climate crisis is expanding the chasm between those who can afford to be resilient, and those who cannot and he urged world leaders at COP 28 to turn the tide by taking a serious approach to keeping our commitments, and ramping up climate action.\n\n“The IPCC represents the best available climate science and it is clear that we can still limit warming to 1.5°C but this will require global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 and be roughly halved by 2030. Crucially, a target for renewables cannot be a substitute for a stronger commitment to fossil-fuel phase-out and an end to fossil fuel subsidies. COP28 needs to deliver both,” said Hon. Toeolesulusulu.\n\nThe AOSIS Chair also reminded of the IPCC finding that “vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected.”\n\n“This should be a key consideration for how we define inequity in this process and the basis on which we should make all of our decisions,” he said. “We have come here with high hopes. We have come here with the aim of delivering positive outcomes for our people who deserve to live in dignity in the face of this climate crisis.\n\n“Our hope was bolstered by adoption and capitalization of the Loss and Damage Fund, and the agreement to fully operationalise the Santigo Network on Loss and Damage. This COP will be marked in history by such monumental outcomes.”\n\nSince 1990, AOSIS has represented the interests of the 39 small island and low-lying coastal developing states in international climate change, sustainable development negotiations and processes. As a voice for the vulnerable, its mandate is more than amplifying marginalised voices as it also advocates for these countries’ interests, a role Samoa as Chair continues.\n\nCOP28 is expected to wrap up its work on Tuesday and a decision adopted by the parties could emerge as the most consequential outcome following the 2015 Paris conference.\n\n“We must never move away from what we all agreed at COP21 in Paris. The Paris Agreement establishes the framework under which we have agreed to operate. Different countries are at different stages in their development, and the Paris Agreement recognizes this by embedding within it the notion of implementation based on national circumstances,” Minister Toeolesulusulu urged.\n\n“We must remember this as we work toward our common goal of addressing the existential threat of climate change. We can and must achieve this goal despite our differences. In recognizing our differences, the Paris Agreement provides the means to help our vulnerable countries meet our common goals. This is through the provision of support, including financial support.”\n\nSamoa also took up the fight to keep the special circumstances of SIDS.\n\n“The specific needs and special circumstances of small island developing States are enshrined in international law as a special case for sustainable development. And sustainable development provides the context for all of our work to address climate change under the Convention and the Paris Agreement,” the AOSIS Chair said.\n\n“We cannot afford to derail the recognition of SIDS and LDCs as by attempting to renegotiate Paris. We kindly ask everyone to respect this important and fundamental principle. Adaptation remains one of the important priorities for SIDS and we e will not give up on it. We are disappointed that discussions on the GGA are not progressing, but we remain hopeful under your leadership on this important measure.”\n\nThe 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP28) in Dubai, UAE is taking place from Thursday 30 November 2023 – Tuesday 12 December 2023.\n\nIt is being attended by Pacific leaders and their delegations, who are advocating for the survival of Pacific communities who continue to be at the forefront of climate change impacts.\n\nA key part of amplifying the One Pacific Voice at COP28 is the Moana Blue Pacific Pavilion, which is a Pacific partnership with Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia. Another key part of the Pacific’s work at COP28 is the Pacific Delegation Office, which is Pacific partnership with Aotearoa New Zealand. Both the Moana Pacific Pavilion and the Pacific Delegation Office are managed by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)."
