This law helps us provide generations of Veterans—and their survivors—with the care and benefits they’ve earned and deserve. And starting March 5, 2024, we’re expanding VA health care to millions of Veterans—years earlier than called for by the PACT Act.\n\nThis page will help answer your questions about what the PACT Act means for you or your loved ones. You can also call us at 800-698-2411 (TTY: 711). And you can file a claim for PACT Act-related disability compensation or apply for VA health care now.\n\nFile a disability claim online\n\nApply for VA health care\n\nWhat’s the PACT Act and how will it affect my VA benefits and care?\n\nThe PACT Act is perhaps the largest health care and benefit expansion in VA history. The full name of the law is The Sergeant First Class (SFC) Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act.\n\nThe PACT Act will bring these changes:\n\nExpands and extends eligibility for VA health care for Veterans with toxic exposures and Veterans of the Vietnam, Gulf War, and post-9/11 eras\n\nAdds 20+ more presumptive conditions for burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic exposures\n\nAdds more presumptive-exposure locations for Agent Orange and radiation\n\nRequires VA to provide a toxic exposure screening to every Veteran enrolled in VA health care\n\nHelps us improve research, staff education, and treatment related to toxic exposures\n\nIf you’re a Veteran or survivor, you can file claims now to apply for PACT Act-related benefits.\n\nWhat does it mean to have a presumptive condition for toxic exposure?\n\nTo get a VA disability rating, your disability must connect to your military service. For many health conditions, you need to prove that your service caused your condition.\n\nBut for some conditions, we automatically assume (or “presume”) that your service caused your condition. We call these “presumptive conditions.”\n\nWe consider a condition presumptive when it's established by law or regulation.\n\nIf you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to prove that your service caused the condition. You only need to meet the service requirements for the presumption.\n\nAm I eligible for VA health care under the PACT Act?\n\nGulf War era and post-9/11 Veteran eligibility\n\nWe’ve added more than 20 burn pit and other toxic exposure presumptive conditions based on the PACT Act. This change expands benefits for Gulf War era and post-9/11 Veterans.\n\nThese cancers are now presumptive:\n\nBrain cancer\n\nGastrointestinal cancer of any type\n\nGlioblastoma\n\nHead cancer of any type\n\nKidney cancer\n\nLymphoma of any type\n\nMelanoma\n\nNeck cancer of any type\n\nPancreatic cancer\n\nReproductive cancer of any type\n\nRespiratory (breathing-related) cancer of any type\n\nLearn more about presumptive cancers related to burn pits\n\nThese illnesses are now presumptive:\n\nAsthma that was diagnosed after service\n\nChronic bronchitis\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n\nChronic rhinitis\n\nChronic sinusitis\n\nConstrictive bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis\n\nEmphysema\n\nGranulomatous disease\n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)\n\nPleuritis\n\nPulmonary fibrosis\n\nSarcoidosis\n\nLearn about other hazardous materials presumptive conditions that may make you eligible for care or benefits\n\nIf you served in any of these locations and time periods, we’ve determined that you had exposure to burn pits or other toxins. We call this having a presumption of exposure.\n\nOn or after September 11, 2001, in any of these locations:\n\nAfghanistan\n\nDjibouti\n\nEgypt\n\nJordan\n\nLebanon\n\nSyria\n\nUzbekistan\n\nYemen\n\nThe airspace above any of these locations\n\nOn or after August 2, 1990, in any of these locations:\n\nBahrain\n\nIraq\n\nKuwait\n\nOman\n\nQatar\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSomalia\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE)\n\nThe airspace above any of these locations\n\nYes.
