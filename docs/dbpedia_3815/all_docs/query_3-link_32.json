        "text": "Collective memory is a central component of group identity. The importance of distant events is typically passed from generation to generation through acts of public remembrance and the teaching of history, using symbolic “sites of memory.”Footnote 1 Collective memory functions as “mythical glue” (Harari Reference Harari2015), helping humans to collaborate in large groups of genetically unrelated individuals by becoming members of “imagined communities” (Anderson Reference Anderson1983).\n\nAlthough collective memory is a constant of human society, it is still unclear when it meaningfully affects important dimensions of behavior. Under which conditions does collective memory of past events come to matter for present-day behavior and attitudes? Despite a burgeoning literature on political legacies and long-term historical persistence (Simpser, Slater, and Wittenberg Reference Simpser, Slater and Wittenberg2018; Voth Reference Voth, Bisin and Federico2021), recent work increasingly suggests that the past only affects the present under specific circumstances (Cantoni, Hagemeister, and Westcott Reference Cantoni, Hagemeister and Westcott2020; Ochsner and Roesel Reference Ochsner and Roesel2017; Rozenas and Zhukov Reference Rozenas and Zhukov2019). What moderates the contingent effect of history on present-day behaviors and attitudes?\n\nIn this paper, we highlight the role of two factors, one behavioral and one institutional. The first one is associativeness of memory. When present events resemble the past, the salience of history increases in people’s minds, affecting their beliefs and associated actions. The second factor is the degree to which collective memory is institutionalized. Official commemoration of past events through symbolic state actions increases the likelihood that collective memory influences present-day behavior. We provide evidence for the interaction of the two factors: associativeness drives the time-variant effect of past events on present-day behavior, and that effect is increasing in the degree of institutionalization of collective memory.\n\nOur empirical analysis focuses on economic and political behavior in the context of Greece. During Greece’s military occupation by Germany in World War II, German armed forces committed numerous war crimes, including mass executions and the destruction of entire villages. This violence was typically carried out in retaliation for local partisan attacks (Mazower Reference Mazower1995). Decades later, during the sovereign debt crisis of 2009–2014, political relations between the German and Greek governments once again turned acrimonious. Under European Union and German pressure, Greece had to implement stringent austerity measures. German newspapers were quick to blame “lazy Southerners” for the Euro debt crisis. As public discord erupted between the German and Greek governments, memories of Germany’s violent occupation of Greece during World War II resurfaced: Greek demonstrators waved placards of German chancellor Angela Merkel in a Nazi uniform, and consumer groups called for a boycott of German products.\n\nTo examine how collective memory interacted with contemporary political conflict to influence major individual decisions, we focus on car sales. Cars are “big ticket items,” representing a major expense for consumers. They are also an iconic German product. We analyze variation in car sales over time and across prefectures in Greece and ask: did German car sales during the debt crisis decline more in areas that suffered German reprisals during World War II—and especially in those that received official recognition as “martyred” towns?\n\nUsing original sources and secondary historiography, we construct a dataset of the universe of Greek towns that experienced German reprisals during World War II. We combine that with data on new car registrations. Applying a machine learning algorithm to the online archive of Greece’s largest newspaper, we compile a time-varying measure of political conflict between Greece and Germany. In addition, we conduct a survey in a sample of over 900 households in towns that experienced reprisals and a set of control locations.\n\nFigure 1 previews our main result. The dotted line tracks the level of animosity between Germany and Greece based on our newspaper measure. As the debt crisis worsened, conflict surged, with months of peak conflict in early 2010 and the summer of 2012. The solid line shows the difference in German market share between prefectures with and without reprisals. From the two time series, it is evident that heightened public conflict between Germany and Greece coincided with lower German market shares in high- relative to low-suffering prefectures. Panel regressions confirm the pattern: the greater the share of reprisal towns in a prefecture, the greater the decline in market share for German producers in times of German–Greek conflict. We provide numerous pieces of evidence that these results are not due either to the differential time-varying effects of the crisis or the persistent influence of cultural characteristics of locations.\n\nWe find similar effects of collective memory on political behavior. Applying a dictionary approach to the universe of Greek parliamentary speeches since 2008, we identify parties with a critical stance toward Germany. We show that the vote share of those parties is identical across locations prior to the start of the debt crisis, but it steeply increases thereafter in municipalities that experienced reprisals. These results provide new evidence that economic and political behaviors respond to the reactivation of collective memory in similar ways.\n\nWe next explore in more depth how the past comes to matter for the present. Since the 1990s, Greece awards communities “martyr” town status if they suffered severely during the occupation—a purely honorific designation with no material benefits. Applications of towns for martyr status are assessed by a committee composed of academic historians. Government data on town-level destruction combined with information from the committee minutes allow us to identify an exogenous component in the assignment of martyr status. Higher wartime destruction in general led to higher acceptance rates, but with a pronounced discontinuity at around 50% of destruction. This suggests that the committee followed a behavioral heuristic for deciding status assignment. We find no evidence that towns were discretely more likely to apply for martyr status after crossing the 50% destruction threshold. Controlling for average levels of destruction, prefectures with a higher share of towns that received official martyr status saw market share declines for German cars above and beyond those experienced by prefectures with a higher incidence of reprisals. We find a similar result after isolating the exogenous component of martyr status, as predicted by the discontinuity at 50% of wartime destruction.\n\nThis finding indicates that public recognition of victim status can amplify collective memory. To examine the mechanisms behind the effects of state sanction, we conduct a telephone survey of mayors’ offices in towns affected by reprisals. We show that places that today continue to collectively commemorate their suffering during 1941–44 saw sharp declines in German car sales during periods of heightened disagreements between the German and Greek governments. These effects are similar in magnitude as for martyr towns, suggesting that formal recognition of past victimhood works in large part through memorialization and the visibility of past memory in public life. Qualitative evidence from martyr towns confirms this interpretation by revealing a stronger role of the memory of past atrocities in public events and in public education. The pattern is mirrored in political outcomes, with martyr municipalities and those with memorials registering similar increases in the vote share of anti-German parties after the crisis. We find no strong evidence of interaction between state recognition and family transmission of past trauma: martyr status has similar effects on residents native to a town and on more recent arrivals.\n\nOur study makes several contributions. Work on historical legacies has identified countless ways in which past events affect present-day attitudes and behaviors, both through institutional and through social channels (Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen Reference Acharya, Blackwell and Sen2016; Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales Reference Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales2016; Putnam and Leonardi Reference Putnam and Leonardi1993; Voigtländer and Voth Reference Voigtländer and Voth2012). Our paper adds to this literature by demonstrating that history’s effect on the present is not a linear function of time. Persistence can be time-varying, and the effects of the past may remain latent until reactivated by changes in the external environment. We thus contribute to a small number of studies that demonstrate the contingent effects of the past on present-day behavior and have emphasized the role of political leaders (Charnysh Reference Charnysh2015; Ochsner and Roesel Reference Ochsner and Roesel2017) and of the political context (Rozenas and Zhukov Reference Rozenas and Zhukov2019). To these factors we add a behavioral mechanism: the association of present events to significant historical experiences, which increases the salience of the past and makes memory a crucial determinant of behavior.\n\nWe also contribute to a narrower subset of the literature on persistence, which focuses on the effects of past conflict and repression. Several studies have demonstrated that past violence has a persistent influence on behavior and that this influence is transmitted across generations (Balcells Reference Balcells2012; Lupu and Peisakhin Reference Lupu and Peisakhin2017; Rozenas, Schutte, and Zhukov Reference Rozenas, Schutte and Zhukov2017). We add to this work by showing that negative attitudes toward the perpetrator of the violence may not manifest in behavioral outcomes unless triggered by external conditions. We also show that, beyond political attitudes and voting behavior, past violence can affect other aspects of individual decision making such as high-stakes purchasing decisions.\n\nWe also provide new evidence on the role of institutionalized collective memory. Through official recognition and rituals of collective remembrance, an adverse shock translates more sharply into attitudes that matter, especially when sanctioned from above. To work that has identified the importance of family (Lupu and Peisakhin Reference Lupu and Peisakhin2017), community (Charnysh and Peisakhin Reference Charnysh and Peisakhin2022), and local institutions (Wittenberg Reference Wittenberg2006) as vehicles of cultural transmission and identity preservation, we contribute evidence on the role of the state. We show that official state actions directed at preserving collective memory have strong effects on behavior when the past becomes relevant for the present, and we provide evidence that these actions work by making memory visible in public life for all residents of a community regardless of their personal or family connection to past violence. Our work thus also relates to studies that provide evidence on the material effects of symbolic politics (Rozenas and Vlasenko Reference Rozenas and Vlasenko2022).\n\nFinally, we add to a literature in international political economy on the effects of consumer boycotts (Ashenfelter, Ciccarella, and Shatz Reference Ashenfelter, Ciccarella and Shatz2007; Hong et al. Reference Hong, Hu, Prieger and Zhu2011; Pandya and Venkatesan Reference Pandya and Venkatesan2016). In work most related to ours, Fisman, Hamao, and Wang (Reference Fisman, Hamao and Wang2014) examine a diplomatic incident between China and Japan caused by how Japanese textbooks treated the 1930s invasion of China. Unlike their setup, the effects we estimate are not due to changes in firm behavior or government actions but due to choices made directly by consumers. Our results suggest that collective memory of past violent actions can be a mechanism sufficiently powerful as to help overcome the collective action problem underlying the failure of many boycott efforts.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen does collective memory affect behavior? We argue that collective memory matters the most when the present is reminiscent of the past, for example by pitting the same groups of “insiders” and “outsiders” against each other. We also show that associativeness of collective memory is strengthened through government intervention by intensifying the presence of “places of memory”—from local plaques and statues to commemoration ceremonies.\n\nOur main analysis focuses on high-frequency movements in political tension across countries and monthly variation in consumer behavior. Figure 1 and additional analyses (Figure A.4) show that consumers responded immediately to Greek–German tension and the economic effects did not carry over to following months. However, other results point to more than just short-lived changes in behavior and attitudes triggered by associative memory. Election data reveal a divergence between municipalities with different degrees of exposure to war crimes that increases over the course of several years. Additionally, we find significant differences in attitudes and buying intentions between martyr towns and towns not affected by WWII violence in 2017, several years after Greek–German relations had normalized. Together, our results suggest that associativeness of memory affects high-stakes economic behavior when the salience of past events is highest, but it can imprint less costly behaviors and attitudes for a longer period.\n\nOur findings on changing patterns of consumer behavior could reflect either personal preferences—that is, a greater dislike of Germany—or concerns over the social acceptability of purchasing a German product. To some extent, social considerations are always a second-order mechanism; residents of martyr towns may worry about social ostracism or vandalism of their cars exactly because at least some of their neighbors hold deeply seated animosity toward Germany. True preferences and social concerns are thus likely to act together to produce the patterns we observe. Two additional pieces of evidence point to the secondary role of social considerations. First, the effects of exposure to reprisals are present for not only purchasing behavior but also purchasing aspirations expressed in the absence of community pressure (to the survey interviewer). Second, private vote choice follows similar patterns to publicly observable purchasing behavior. Nonetheless, this evidence remains suggestive, as our setup does not allow us to cleanly distinguish between private preferences and social desirability considerations.\n\nOne of our study’s central findings is that reactivation of collective memory has similar effects on economic and political behavior. We thus help to bridge literatures in political science and political economy, which have focused on these aspects of human decisions in isolation. By demonstrating that the official recognition of victim status matters over and above the memory of past violence, our paper is also the first to provide causal evidence for the role of institutionalized collective memory on economic and political decision making."
