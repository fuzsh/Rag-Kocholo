        "text": "80 years later, Marine remembers Guadalcanal - ‚ÄùWhen we were on Samoa, we would hear stories from the ships stopping at Guadalcanal, and of what was happening there. So we were fully prepared for what faced us. When we got aboard ship, we knew where we were going, and we were prepared for it. I was part of a very important time in the Marine Corps. It makes me very proud. The Marine Corps taught me everything I know. Taught me to be a good man.\" Mr. Richard Russell celebrated his 20th birthday in the company of his comrades with Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, in the Samoan Islands. Russell is preparing to celebrate his 100th birthday and simultaneously commemorate the 80th anniversary of the battle that shaped his young life.
