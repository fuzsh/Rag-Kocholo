        "text": "Crisis in relations between states\n\nThe term international crisis is a widespread term without a single common definition.[1] To some, it involves \"a sequence of interactions between the governments of two or more sovereign states in severe conflict, short of actual war, but involving the perception of a dangerously high probability of war\".[2]\n\nTypes\n\n[edit]\n\nLebow gives a breakdown of three types of international crises:\n\nJustification of hostilities.[3] One of the nations decides, before the crisis starts, to go to war and constructs a crisis to justify it. The pattern of justification is almost always the same: Rouse public opinion, make impossible demands, try to legitimize the demands, deny your real intentions then employ the rejection of the demands as a reason for war. A recent example, commonly employed by critics of George W. Bush, is the Iraq disarmament crisis, which precipitated the Iraq War.\n\nSpinoff crisis. The nations are involved in a war or crisis with another nation or nations and this precipitates another crisis, e.g. the Lusitania incident in 1915.\n\nBrinkmanship. Intentionally forcing a crisis to get the other side to back down. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 is a well-known example of brinkmanship.\n\nWith the exception of a justification of hostilities, the study of international crises assumes that neither side actually wants to go to war, but must be visibly prepared to do so.\n\nStrategies\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge's book presents an overview of the process and conflicting goals of crisis management as well as many examples.[4] He discusses a number of strategies, including:\n\nOffensive strategies\n\n[edit]\n\nblackmail\n\nlimited and reversible response\n\ncontrolled pressure\n\nattrition\n\nfait accompli\n\nDefensive strategies\n\n[edit]\n\ncoercion\n\nlimited escalation\n\ntit-for-tat\n\ntest of capabilities\n\n\"drawing a line\"\n\nbuying time strategy\n\nconveying commitment and resolve to avoid miscalculation by the adversary\n\nList of defused crises\n\n[edit]\n\nInternational crises tend to result in war, almost by definition; they are then remembered best not as crises but as causes of wars. For information on international crises that resulted immediately in war, see list of wars.\n\nGiven the above, some of the crises that are best-known as crises were defused. The following crises did not immediately provoke large-scale violence, but set off anger in countries:\n\nWar in sight crisis (1875)[5]\n\nSamoan Crisis (1887–1889), between the United States of America, England, and Germany\n\nAnglo-Portuguese Crisis (1889–1890)\n\nVenezuelan crisis of 1895, between Venezuela and the United Kingdom\n\nFashoda Incident (1898–1899)\n\nBaltimore Crisis (1891–1892)\n\nVenezuelan crisis of 1902–03, between Venezuela and Britain, Germany and Italy\n\nFirst Moroccan Crisis (1904–1906)\n\nDutch–Venezuelan crisis of 1908, between Venezuela and the Netherlands\n\nBosnian crisis (1908–1909)\n\nAgadir Crisis (1911)\n\nÅland crisis (1916–1920)\n\nRemilitarization of the Rhineland (1936)\n\nAnschluss (1938)\n\nMay Crisis (1938)\n\nSudetenland Crisis (1938)\n\nLevant Crisis (1945) between the United Kingdom and Syria, France\n\nIran crisis (1946–1947)\n\nBerlin Blockade (1948–1949)\n\nBerlin Crisis of 1961\n\nCuban Missile Crisis (1962)\n\nPueblo incident (1968)\n\nDamansky Island Crisis (1969)\n\n1973 Chilean coup\n\nAxe Murder Incident (1976)\n\nBeagle conflict (1978)\n\nIran hostage crisis (1979)\n\nAble Archer 83 (1983)\n\nCaldas' crisis (1987)\n\nOngoing crises\n\n[edit]\n\nKorean conflict (1945-ongoing)\n\nNorth Korea and weapons of mass destruction\n\nIsraeli–Palestinian conflict (1947-ongoing)\n\nIndo-Pakistani wars and conflicts (1947-ongoing)\n\nTerritorial disputes in the South China Sea (1950s-ongoing)\n\nCyprus problem (1963-ongoing)\n\nIran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict (1979-ongoing)\n\nIraqi conflict (2003-ongoing)\n\nCrisis in Venezuela (2010-ongoing)\n\nLibyan conflict (2011-ongoing)\n\nSyrian Civil War (2011-ongoing)\n\nRusso-Ukrainian war (2014-ongoing)\n\nYemeni Civil War (2015-ongoing)\n\nRohingya genocide (2017-ongoing)\n\nLebanese crisis (2019-ongoing)\n\nThe 2023 Nigerien Crisis (2023-ongoing)\n\nAftermath of the 2023 Nigerien coup d'état.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDiplomacy\n\nInternational relations\n\nThe UN\n\nWorld Bank\n\nG-20\n\nNegotiation\n\nCrisis\n\nCrisis management\n\nCategory:Wikipedia categories named after diplomatic crises\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSnyder, Glenn H. and Diesing, Paul: 1977.
