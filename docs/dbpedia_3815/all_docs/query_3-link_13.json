        "text": "A monument erected by the New Zealand Government commemorating those who died in the Spanish influenza epidemic in Samoa has been unveiled in Samoa.\n\nIt memorializes the 8500 lives lost in Samoa to the Spanish influenza epidemic in 1918 .\n\nNew Zealand's Minister of Social Development and Disability Issues, Carmel Sepuloni, said the Memorial site at Vaimoso is significant for Samoa and New Zealand.\n\n\"The launch and re-dedication of the monument allows New Zealand to be held accountable for actions that has a devastating impact to Samoa,\" she said.\n\nIn 2002, New Zealand's Prime Minister Helen Clark made a public apology to Samoa for the colonial administrators handling of the epidemic in 1918, killing a fifth of the population at the time and \"causing pain and sorrow to the people of Samoa\".\n\nThe apology according to Minister Sepuloni is necessary because reconciliation is important in building strong relationships between Samoa and New Zealand.\n\n\"Despite of that plight in our New Zealand history of which we are not proud of, Samoa and New Zealand has a strong relationship.\"\n\nLearn more about the epidemic:\n\nHow NZ took influenza to Samoa, killing a fifth of its population\n\nBlack Sheep podcast: Epidemic, the story of Robert Logan\n\nMedical historian Ryan McLane on Samoa's Spanish flu\n\nTalamua online said there were four long blocks at the gravesite marking the area where the victims were buried in mass graves including the monument erected and now upgraded by the New Zealand Government in memory of those who died.\n\nOn the monument are the words \"Funded by the Government of New Zealand in Sacred Memory of the People Who Died in the Pandemic Influenza 1918\".\n\nHigh chief Manuleleua of Vaimoso believes the monument was built around the 1930s.\n\n\"The monument can become a historical and a tourism attraction for Vaimoso and Samoa in the future,\" he said.\n\nSamoa Prime Minister Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi said Samoa has long forgiven what happened in 1918 and that a repeat of what happened may not happen again in the future.\n\nThe project is estimated to cost more than $ST100,000."
