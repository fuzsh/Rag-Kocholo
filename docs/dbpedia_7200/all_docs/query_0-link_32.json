        "text": "It’s good to see the true history of my people on film. Although the most famous depictions of cowboys of the old west were white men like Roy Rogers and Billy the Kid, one in four of America’s cowboys were African-American.\n\nLittle to no attention was given to the black cowboys who made their mark in the old west. Cowboys like William “Bill” Pickett, Stagecoach Mary, Nat Love were among the most famous.\n\nNot only did Hollywood ignore black cowboys, it plundered their real stories as material for some of its films.\n\nThe Lone Ranger, for example, was inspired by Bass Reeves, a black lawman who used disguises, had a Native American sidekick and went through his whole career without being shot.\n\nThe 1956 John Ford film The Searchers, based on Alan Le May’s novel, was partly inspired by the exploits of Brit Johnson, a black cowboy whose wife and children were captured by the Comanches in 1865. In the film, John Wayne plays as a Civil War veteran who spends years looking for his niece who has been abducted by Indians.\n\nThanks for posting this historically significant movie."
