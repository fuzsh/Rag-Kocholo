Unlike the \"black cast\" films produced within the Hollywood studio system, these films not only starred African Americans but were funded, written, produced, edited, distributed, and often exhibited by people of color. Entrepreneurial filmmakers built an industry apart from the Hollywood establishment, cultivating visual and narrative styles that were uniquely their own.\n\nDVD, NTSC, region 1.\n\nContents: Body and soul. -- Conquest. -- Jeff Ballinger's woman. -- Ten nights in a bar-room, and what I saw there. -- Ten nights in a bar-room. -- House behind the cedars. -- Rain. -- Birthright.\n\nCOMMUNITY REVIEWS\n\nNo community reviews.
