        "text": "Intro: Cyberdyne Systems\n\nCyberdyne Systems is a high-tech corporation that plays a central role in the Terminator universe, as it is responsible for the creation of Skynet in a number of timelines.\n\nIn the second film, T2: Judgement Day, we learn that the time traveling Series 800 Terminator from the first film was not entirely destroyed when it was crushed in a factory, in the year 1984. As a result, that manufacturing company came to possess a metal hand and forearm from the Terminator’s endoskeleton, along with its broken CPU. Research based on those artifacts would lead to the founding of Cyberdyne Systems. While it was mentioned in the first Terminator film by Kyle Reese, this would be our first look at the company and its visual identity, in the year 1995.\n\nIn T2, we also learn Miles Dyson is the Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems. It is his breakthrough work in neural-net technology, based on that Terminator CPU, that puts Skynet on track for activation in 1997, which leads to Judgement Day.\n\nWhen Sarah and her son John Connor, along with the Terminator aiding and protecting them, confront Dyson in the film, he learns the future of the Cyberdyne’s work and the events they must avert. The Terminator Collection Limited Edition Book outlines those as follows:\n\n1996 / Cyberdyne becomes the largest supplier of military computers; the US government funds the building of Skynet to run the country’s nuclear defense systems.\n\n1997 / Skynet goes on-line, becoming self-aware on August 29th; when panicking humans try to shut it down, Skynet starts a nuclear war that virtually annihilates the human race. This event is known as “Judgement Day.”\n\n1997–2029 / Human survivors of the nuclear war are hunted down by Skynet’s Hunter-Killers, created in automated factories; the human race is nearly wiped out.\n\nAnd the company doesn’t go forgotten — it lives on in a way, because Skynet still identifies with its corporate creator, as it builds these entirely new machines for human extermination. In The Terminator, Kyle Reese refers to the Terminator as a “Cyberdyne Systems Model 101.” And in T2, as the Series 800 Terminator sent to protect John Connor introduces itself, it also identifies as a “Cyberdyne Systems Model 101.”\n\nThe story doesn’t end there, but this is essentially the origin and role of Cyberdyne Systems in the Terminator universe’s main timeline. Alternate timelines will be noted as they relate to the evolution of Cyberdyne and Skynet’s identity, when examining the design in later sections of this research entry\n\nAnalysis: Possible Origins of the Name “Cyberdyne Systems”\n\nBefore analyzing the visual identity, it will be useful to examine the company’s name, to uncover its possible origins and how it relates to real-world corporations. This will give us some necessary context for puzzling out design decisions and what the identity may hope to communicate about Cyberdyne Systems.\n\nWhile Cyberdyne Systems doesn’t make an appearance until T2, it was mentioned in The Terminator, in the following exchange:\n\nSarah Connor : [in a stolen car, while being chased by the police and the terminator] This is a mistake. I haven't done anything.\n\nKyle Reese : No, but you will. It's very important that you live.\n\nSarah Connor : This isn't true. How could that man just get up after you just…\n\nKyle Reese : He's not a man — a machine. Terminator, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101.\n\nSarah Connor : A machine? Like a robot?\n\nKyle Reese : Not a robot. A cyborg. Cybernetic organism.\n\nSo there, like Sarah Connor, we first learn of Cyberdyne’s existence, while also having the terms “cyborg” and “cybernetic” thrown at us. To understand what that all means, now is a good time to briefly cover cybernetics.\n\nIt’s originator, Norbert Wiener, defined it in 1948 as “the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things.” Being cross-disciplinary, Cybernetics has been applied in a variety of disciplines, like biology and computer science, but on a basic level it attempts to discover the underlying principles of things like artificial intelligence and control systems. So it’s cybernetics we can thank for the “cyber” in Cyberdyne, and this wouldn’t be the first time it figured into a sci-fi story about killer machines (Figure 8.1).\n\nIt’s also worth noting that in early drafts of the film’s script, the company was first referred to by Reese as “Cyber Dynamics” (Figure 8.2). While being a contraction of cybernetics, “Cyber” is by itself a term that could generally refer to networks and computers, and in the 1980s, its use in a name would imply that the company is in the high-tech industry. I don’t know the extent of its real-world use in the naming of corporations at the time, but it was definitely a term with traction in science fiction, in large part thanks to the sci-fi subgenre of cyberpunk (Figure 8.3). Using it in the name of a company, would make it sound futuristic to the film’s contemporary audience.\n\nThen there is the “Dynamics” part. In addition to being a branch of physical science that is concerned with the motion of bodies under the action of forces, dynamics can be defined as “the forces or properties which stimulate growth, development, or change within a system or process.” To see this used by a corporation in its name, would imply that it is on the leading edge of whatever technology the company deals in.\n\nThe earliest example I am aware of, for the word’s use in company naming, is the Electro-Dynamic Company, founded in 1880. That company would go on to spawn General Dynamics Corporation in 1899 (Figure 8.4), which in the 1980s and to this day, is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the US. This is interesting, because General Dynamics is a company that has had a hand in just about every aspect of US military technology, including computer systems and nuclear weapons — two main ingredients in Skynet, the fictional end product of Cyberdyne Systems.\n\nFrom there, it would appear that the two words in the earlier scripts — Cyber and Dynamics — were combined into a portmanteau, giving us Cyberdyne. But “dyne” in this spelling has another specific meaning, relating to the science of dynamics, where it is a unit for measuring force. If there’s a dyne in the name, it could imply that the company is a powerful force to be reckoned with. And there are also real-world examples of cutting-edge technology companies using dyne in their names for this reason.\n\nThe earliest that came to mind was Rocketdyne (Figure 8.5), founded in 1955 by North American Aviation, to design and produce rocket engines — for this product, using a unit of force makes a lot of sense.\n\nNot long after, there were two corporations founded in 1960 that were entering the electronics industry, which could have gone on to directly inspire the Cyberdyne Systems name (Figure 8.6). By the 1980s, both of these companies were corporate conglomerates, having expanded through acquisitions of other companies, while extending their reach into new technologies.\n\nThere was Teradyne, which started out building automated electronic test equipment, and later expanded into robotics and industrial automation. The founders of Teradyne stated that the name of that company was intended to represent a very forceful presence: 1,000,000,000,000 dynes = 10 meganewtons.\n\nLooking at the company’s history, we learn that in 1969, Teradyne launched Teradyne Dynamic Systems after the acquisition of Triangle Systems, to develop new digital semiconductor test systems in Chatsworth, CA. With the info in that sentence, you have almost all the language to inspire the Cyberdyne Systems name, along with a triangle being thrown into the mix, which is the overall shape of Cyberdyne’s mark.\n\nThe other company was Teledyne, which started out in the business of semiconductors and control systems, before getting heavy into aerospace and defense work. As currently described on their website, “the name ‘Teledyne’ means ‘distant force’ or alternatively ‘power from afar.’ Across the globe, in deep space and on the ocean floor, Teledyne businesses manufacture enabling technologies that provide power or derive information from distant environments.” At one time, Teledyne owned as many as 150 different companies. Among them was Teledyne Ryan, which was one of the largest producers of military drones in that technology’s early days — which makes me think of Skynet's aerial H-Ks.\n\nFor \"dyne\" to be similarly applied in the Cyberdyne name, would communicate that they are aiming to be a powerful force in the \"cyber\" space, which for them encompasses technologies like networks, computer systems, automation, and the holy grail that is artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile both Teradyne and Teledyne would have been around and well-known in the high-tech industry in 1984, to inspire the naming of Cyberdyne Systems in The Terminator, they were just two of a number of companies using “dyne” in their name by the time T2 was being produced in 1990. Flipping through computer technology magazines from that same year, I found ads for Novadyne and AT&T Paradyne (Figure 8.7), among others. The same goes for corporations using “Systems” in their name, which was extremely popular at the time (Figure 8.8). Novadyne is actually a good example of both of these trends in naming — founded in 1990 by a breakaway division of the defense contractor McDonnell Douglas, the company’s full name was actually Novadyne Computer Systems.\n\nSo what this tells us, is Cyberdyne Systems — whatever its original inspiration may have been — was a believable and historically accurate title for a 1990s technology company, when it was devised by James Cameron for the 1984 Terminator film. Whether he got the idea from any one company in particular, or just saw the naming trends in the industry, he hit the nail on the head. Now I’ll turn to the design of the identity, to see if the same was managed there.\n\nAnd while it may seem like we spent a lot of time with the company name, much of what we discovered in this exercise will provide references for analyzing and evaluating the design, in the next sections of this entry.\n\nAnalysis: The Design of the Cyberdyne Systems Mark\n\nThe Cyberdyne Systems visual identity, as it first appeared in the film T2: Judgement Day, is composed of two elements — a mark and wordmark — that appear in a variety of versions and lockups, and independently as standalone identifiers.\n\nThe mark (Figure 10.1) can be described overall as an upward pointing triangle divided into three separate parts, each of which is an irregularly shaped diamond, arrayed around a central point. The primary, 2-color version of the mark is black and light gray, with the lower right diamond being highlighted in most versions of the mark. It is not apparent what the mark or the highlight signifies. Given the company’s name, there is no reason to read the overall triangle shape as an “A”. It can be classified as an abstract or non-figurative mark. But that doesn’t mean it is just arbitrary shapes — looking for possible inspiration, by examining the trends and companies mentioned in the previous section, could point to it being a reference or homage to real-world marks and what they represent.\n\nLooking through publications collecting technology logos in the 1980s, it is not hard to find marks that look like Cyberdyne’s (Figure 10.2). Modern, abstract designs were still in style, and slicing basic shapes with thin lines was an industry trend at the time. In the 1985 book High Tech Trademarks Vol 1, author John Mendenhall writes “the line, slim or tapering, has become the symbol of our electronic age of information processing. The high speed, highly miniaturized and highly powerful transfer of information through lines of electric circuits is truly the ‘high’ of high technology.” No doubt, the mark’s designer wanted to place it in this moment, identifying Cyberdyne with other technology companies, to make it believable for the film’s audience and to give them something to associate with tech marks they may have been familiar with already.\n\nAs noted in the previous section, the designer may have been looking at very specific companies as well, like those that inspired the name. Of these, I think Teledyne is the most likely to have played a part in the design.\n\nTeledyne’s mark at the time of T2’s production was designed in the 1960s by Robert Miles Runyan and Associates, and is still used by the company to this day. It’s a logo that would have been relatively easy to find by a designer at the time — Robert Miles Runyan was a big name in the design world, with work published in books and magazines, and both Teledyne and Runyan were based in LA, where much of T2 was filmed.\n\nComparing the design with Cyberdyne’s mark, we find that even though Teledyne’s isn’t a triangle shape, it is a 2-color black and gray geometric design, composed of parts that are separated by similarly weighted line breaks. Those individual parts are also diamonds, though all four are equal in size and shape. I don’t know that Teledyne’s is an entirely abstract mark though, as I can see a letter “T” for Teledyne in its overall shape.\n\nWhat’s really interesting is how similar the look and feel of the two are (Figure 10.3). Even more so, is if I were a designer playing around with ideas on tracing paper, I could turn the Teledyne mark and superimpose a triangle over it, cropping it to get some of the base shapes in Cyberdyne’s mark (Figure 10.4). If this were done using the 2-color Teledyne mark as a starting point, it could even explain the seemingly arbitrary highlight of one of those base diamond shapes. Coincidence? Maybe… but we’re seeing a lot of coincidences at this point, between the company name, the business path of Teledyne (building semiconductors before getting into defense electronics), and the construction of the mark. If nothing else, it is a very interesting connection to a real-world company, that lends to the possibility of something like Cyberdyne actually coming into existence.\n\nBut why a triangle? Well, on a very basic level, it is not as friendly a shape as a circle or square. It is said that triangles represent tension, action and aggression, due to their stable/unstable dynamic (depending on their orientation), with a triangle on its base conveying immovable strength. The shape helps us perceive Cyberdyne as a threat, and maybe communicates to the film’s audience that the company, and the future it delivers, will not be easy for T2’s protagonists to topple or change.\n\nTriangles can also imply a more specific threat in the right context, due to the shape’s association with nuclear danger, which could be induced by Cyberdyne’s role in the nuclear apocalypse known as Judgement Day. For example, the shape has a prominent place in the fallout shelter symbol and the Civil Defense symbol (Figure 10.5), and could also be found in information graphics depicting the US military’s Cold War nuclear triad of ICBMs, bombers and SLBMs. Several of these involve the triangle being split into three parts as well, which strengthens their link to Cyberdyne’s mark.\n\nThese nuclear related symbols were also brought up in the research entry for Colossus, which is another sci-fi artificial intelligence that could have inspired elements of Terminator’s story — the supercomputer Colossus, like Skynet, gains sentience shortly after activation and uses our nuclear arsenals against us. It is definitely worth noting here (Figure 10.6), because the Cyberdyne mark could have been an homage to Colossus’ triangular identity.\n\nAnother fictional identity that could have served as inspiration for the mark is that of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems, from The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension. In that film, Yoyodyne is a defense contractor in the aerospace industry, that turns out to be a front for a group of red Lectroid aliens that are trapped on Earth and disguised as humans. With the film being released the same year as The Terminator, in 1984, it is probably a coincidence that they both used “dyne” and “systems” in the company names. But the Yoyodyne design could have gone on to influence the Cyberdyne mark we see in T2, produced years later.\n\nThough the colors and proportions are different, both marks use a triangle for the overall shape (Figure 10.7). And we see the green Yoyodyne triangle used by the evil Lectroids in other ways. One in particular, caught my attention — towards the end of the film, as they try to get their spacecraft to cross into the eighth dimension, they target a green triangle that is painted on the wall of the facility (Figure 10.8). Within the triangle, there are green dots, from which three dotted lines extend, each trisecting the triangle in a similar fashion to what we find in the Cyberdyne mark. Could the T2 production artists have been fans of Buckaroo Banzai, and slipped in a subtle homage to that film's evil \"dyne\" corporation? It’s possible. But without knowing the designer of the Cyberdyne logo, to ask for a definitive answer, all we can do is add it to the list of plausible inspiration sources from science fiction and reality.\n\nUsage: The Cyberdyne Identity In Alternate Timelines\n\nAfter the events of T2, with Cyberdyne Systems’ future altered, the way was opened for other filmmakers to reimagine where the company would go from there.\n\nIn Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, set in the year 2004, Cyberdyne is out of business, its technology having passed into the hands of the US Air Force’s Cyber Research Systems (CRS).\n\nAn alternate timeline is then established in Terminator: Salvation, where we find Cyberdyne Systems operating in the year 2003, with a new Genetics Division (Figure 12.1). The mark as been reduced to one color bronze/brown, but remains the same otherwise. The dark blue wordmark is set in Baskerville Old Face. Jumping ahead to the post-apocalyptic setting of that film, in the year 2018, we also find the one-color Cyberdyne mark being used by a sentient Skynet.\n\nThen, in yet another attempt to reboot things, Terminator: Genisys establishes another alternate timeline, where Cyberdyne is still operating in the year 2017. Here, the mark has become more squat in proportions. Cyberdyne is set in a heavyweight geometric sans serif, and “Systems” has been dropped from its wordmark. It has also been reduced to one color overall, with a metallic treatment used on product packaging (Figure 12.2). Compared to T2, it received limited usage in and on the Cyberdyne building (Figures 12.3 and 12.4).\n\nEarlier in Genisys, we also get a look at things from a T-800 Terminator’s perspective. As that Terminator from the year 2029 comes back online from a damaged state, its machine vision view displays a previously unseen version of the Cyberdyne mark as used by a sentient Skynet, that is rendered in white lines against the red boot screen.\n\nWhat is most interesting among these cases are those instances where the mark from Cyberdyne’s visual identity is used by the sentient artificial intelligence that is Skynet. In The Terminator and T2, we learned that Skynet retained the company name when assigning make and model designations to its machines, which was already a little strange. Now we are seeing the visual identity not just retained, but actively used and applied in software, hardware and industrial environments that were created by Skynet. This is a very sci-fi development for a corporate identity to go through, that merits examination — something I've done in a separate research entry devoted to Skynet."
