        "text": "Director Oscar Micheaux lines up a shot\n\nOver the past few years, Kino Lorber, one of our favorite distribution houses, has coordinated a major restoration project called Pioneers Of African-American Cinema. As part of this project, executive-produced by Paul D. Miller (also known as DJ Spooky) new restorations have been created from original elements that reside in a number of film archives including the Library Of Congress, the UCLA Film and Television Archive and, close to home, Southern Methodist University.\n\nThese, with some important exceptions, were films made for African American audiences, to be played exclusively in theaters which catered to a black clientele, as such these films provide a fascinating glimpse into a popular culture that was not visible by society at large, mostly until now.\n\nWe’re honored to present two programs of selections from these materials, co-curated and hosted by Professor Mark Cunningham, Ph.D, of Austin Community Colleges Radio-Television-Film Department.\n\nFor the first installment, screening at the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum’s Spirit Of Texas Theater on Sunday, February 19 at 4pm, we present the following program:\n\n1) DARKTOWN REVIEW (1931, 18 min): From legendary African American director Oscar Micheaux, his most unusual, free-wheeling film, a recontextualisation of a traditional black-face minstrel show, in an attempt to reclaim the tradition from its racist purveyors."
