        "text": "Gold: So first of all, that Golden Lady I liked. Colbert viewers may know that, after winning All The Emmys plus an Oscar and miscellaneous other awards, adorable bandleader Jon Batiste has departed the show to follow his muse. The band, formerly called “Stay Human”, is now renamed The Late Show Band, and is directed by Louis Cato, who has a bit less personal flash than Jon Batiste but is very talented. The show has put out a few videos to help the new lineup show off a little, including this one with singer Madison Cunningham. [4:34]\n\nSilver: Silver Lining by Bonnie Raitt, live at Montreux, 2003. [6:42]\n\nPlatinum: Platinum by Miranda Lambert, live at Belk Bowl FanFest in Charlotte, NC, December 2014. [3:10]\n\nAluminum: Not just precious metals! Aluminum by Barenaked Ladies, here in a very nice plague-time solo guitar arrangement by their lead singer and guitarist Ed Robertson, alone in his bathroom. [3:28]\n\nLead: It turns out to be annoying to find songs referring to lead, the heavy metal, because they’re mixed in with songs with “lead”, the verb, most often used in supplication to Jesus, apparently. This is Get The Lead Out by Aerosmith, live at Texxas World Music Festival (“Texxas Jam”), 1978. [3:16]\n\nNickel: Sometimes we’re going to cheat a little. The Nickel Song by Melanie (1971) is talking about the coin, but the coin is called that because of the metal in it, so, not really cheating! [3:42]\n\nCopper: I had never heard The Copper Song by Clint Maki, from his 1996 album Two Track Road. It seems it wasn’t very successful, because I can’t find anything more about him now. It may be the only song in here that is so directly about the metal for which it’s titled. [5:39]\n\nTin: Tin Man by America, live on German TV show Musikladen, in 1975. [3:28]\n\nBronze: No reason we need to stick with elements, when there are metal alloys with songs of their own. Copper plus tin makes bronze. The Bronze Buckaroo is performed by The Red Hot Rhythm Rustlers at the 2013 Western Music Association convention in Albuquerque. The song was apparently concocted to honor singer and actor Herb Jeffries, shortly before his death at age 100. Jeffries may or may not have been of mixed race, but generally claimed Black heritage, and made a career of playing characters of color, cowboys in particular (The Bronze Buckaroo was a 1939 film of his), and singing with all-Black jazz groups. I had no idea, when I picked this little western song, that it would merit a diary-length introduction! [3:34]\n\nZinc: Think Zinc by T. Rex. This isn’t live, or the greatest recording or most interesting song, imho, but we need zinc to get to brass! [3:23]\n\nBrass: Copper plus zinc makes brass. Brass in Pocket by The Pretenders, recorded live at a 1979 rehearsal. [3:02]\n\nMercury: Mercury Blues by The Steve Miller Band, live at Pine Knob Amphitheater in Detroit, 1982. I admit this song refers to the old Ford automobile brand, which in turn was named after the fleet-footed Roman god whose name is also all tangled up with the planet AND the element. It all comes together in the end! Also, worth a little stretching to hear Norton Buffalo play (why yes, I do love blues harp). [5:48]\n\nLithium: Lithium by Nirvana, live at Pier 48 in Seattle, 1993 (from the concert video/CD, Live And Loud). [4:13]\n\nIron: Iron Lion Zion by Bob Marley (the “official music video”). [3:25]\n\nChromium: Chromium, by The Church, live at some House of Blues location somewhere, sometime. (If you’d like to know more, be prepared to learn about some Gospel Brunch events at that chain...) [3:40]\n\nSteel: Iron plus carbon (not a metal!) = steel, but add chromium and you have stainless steel. I am pretty sure the steel Joni was writing about was the furthest thing from “stainless”, though. Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire by Joni Mitchell, live in London, 1974. [5:21]\n\nZirconium: Zirconium is an element, and a metal, that is obtained from the mineral zirconium(IV) silicate (ZrSiO4), more commonly known as zircon. As many fans of Frank Zappa are aware, zircon has a gemstone form, suitable for encrusting tweezers. Montana, live on Swedish TV show Opopoppa in 1973, does not get around to the tweezers until 6:45, but I believe you’ll be entertained in the interim. [8:37]"
