        "text": "A24 has been successful for a lot of reasons but among the biggest keys to their success is their ability to generate conversation, and they sure generated a lot of conversation when the trailer to the Alex Garland directed thriller Civil War dropped. Part of that conversation had to do with the film’s place within the A24 business model: this was clearly much more expensive than most of the movies they put out and would be seeking to be a much bigger mainstream hit. But the bigger conversation had more to do with the movie itself and what it was doing. It’s no secret that the United States is presently being ripped apart by partisanship and cultural warfare and that there’s a specter of dictatorship on the horizon if a certain someone finds his way back into office. With that as a backdrop any movie about the country being torn apart by actual literal warfare is going to be pretty loaded. There were plenty of debates about how the alliance the film posits between Texas and California against a seemingly dictatorial president would even work or how such a realignment would happen given the existing political cleavages in the country and also how such a war would even function but the bigger question was what exactly the movie was even trying to say by positing such a conflict. Personally, I had some pretty strong reservations but I was more than intrigued enough to give it a shot, especially given that it was coming from an interesting voice like that of Alex Garland.\n\nThe film is set in some sort of alternate timeline of the present day or near future and posits a world in which the United States has been in a state of civil war for a while when the film begins. The nation has been divided into the “Loyalist States,” the “Western Forces” lead by California and Texas and also something called the “Florida Alliance.” The exact makeup and ideologies of these forces are left vague but we know they are in opposition to a seemingly dictatorial unnamed President played by Nick Offerman who’s said to be in his third term or later in office. We follow this from the perspective of Lee Smith (Kirsten Dunst), a war photographer who we’re introduced to as she photographs a protest that turns violent on the streets of New York. During that scuffle she meets Jessie (Cailee Spaeny), a women in her early twenties who also has a passion for news photography and idolizes Smith. The war is apparently in its late stages with the Western Forces primed to move in on D.C., prompting Smith and a colleague named Joel (Wagner Moura) to drive down to that city to get a final interview with the president and both Jessie and another veteran journalist named Sammy (Stephen Henderson) decide to tag along.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I think the basic alternate universe premise behind this movie just does not make a whole lot of sense. Releasing such a movie during this particular moment of polarization and in an election year no less instantly makes you assume it’s trying to act as some sort of cautionary tale about where current conflicts could be heading but the movie never quite “goes there.” We don’t get a clear idea what political ideology the film’s unnamed fictional president belongs to beyond his having some dictatorial tendencies and the states that are said to be on his side and opposed to him do not really seem to follow modern partisan lines and that alliance between California and Texas seems particularly eyebrow raising. In some ways this might have made a bit more sense if they’d dropped the whole “war between the states” terminology and just made this some non-geographically aligned “rebel alliance” against the regime in power, though one also wonders how such a group could get a regular army with advanced armaments and a seemingly conventional hierarchy of power.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear from the outset which side we should be rooting for through all this, which is probably partly by design. It’s not always entirely clear what side the various soldiers we encounter are fighting for as many are not in uniforms and the ones who are wear fairly interchangeable camouflage fatigues and it’s also not entirely clear what the “Florida Alliance” is in all of this and both sides do some questionable things throughout. As a viewer of a certain political outlook I’m generally inclined to view the idea of a violent rebellion in this country with a lot of suspicion given who were the “rebels” in the actual 19th Century Civil War and also because the people in modern America most inclined toward anti-government militarism (paranoid right wing “militias”). I do not get the impression from watching the movie that this particular rebellion is rooted in paranoia as this president does appear to be legitimately totalitarian but the movie does withhold a lot of the information you might want in order to really pick sides. In some ways this mirrors the complexity of a lot of civil wars in the real modern world line in Syria, where Bashar al-Assad legitimately seems like a butcher who deserves to be taken down, but where there also seemed to be extremists among the resistance who may well be even worse than the people they’re bringing down if they prove to be the ones taking power when all is said and done.\n\nOf course I suspect that if asked Alex Garland would tell me that getting this into the weeds about the sides in this Civil War is a mistake and that the real focus here is on the visceral feeling of what the sight of such a conflict happening in modern America would invoke. In a lot of ways the Alex Garland project this most closely resembles are the 28 Days Later in that this sort of a post-apocalypse movie even if the apocalypse is locally contained. In fact the interplay between the Dunst and Spaeny characters as they take a road trip across this war torn landscape is not too far from the whole Children of Men/The Road/Logan/“The Last of Us” formula that pop culture has been using pretty regularly lately. That’s not a criticism per se, this is a clever enough riff on the idea, but it’s definitely there. The arcs of these various characters in the group are not too hard to predict but the actors flesh them out well enough and their journey works well enough for its intended purpose of showing off different aspects of the film’s world without giving us too much of a bird’s eye view of things.\n\nWhen the combat does pop off in this movie it is pretty effective and tense. The violence here is brutal and a bit disturbing, but certainly still a spectacle, and the film’s soundtrack features a lot of notably very loud gunshot sound effects. I will say, for a movie that’s trying very hard to scream modernity there is something a bit old fashioned about its conception of modern combat. We’re given little indication here that drone strikes exist in the world of the movie and there’s a level of small arms fire that seems a bit out of step with where most contemporary battles are going, but maybe that’s for the best cinematically. That spectacle mixed with the novelty of seeing this kind of material is the main reason to see this movie and it’s definitely a good enough reason. I do not know that this is something I can really take all that seriously however; on some level I think this is more of a glorified zombie movie than it is a real cautionary tale about political divisions run amok. But is that isn’t an inherently bad thing, I like zombie movies and finding a new spin on society falling apart in a disastrous conflict is a smart thing to do.\n\n***1/2 out of Five\n\nMost people would be happy to tell you that The Exorcist is an important and influential horror movie and yet on some level the sheer magnitude of its influence still somehow feel under-rated in that it’s a movie from over fifty years ago which still regularly gets blatant ripoffs like The Pope’s Exorcist or Prey for the Devil released almost every single year during some of the slower box office weeks of the year. But this year something seems to have shifted and we’ve instead gotten not one but two horror movies in a row that have realized that there are other devil movies from the New Hollywood era that they can try to monetize. First we’ve got a movie called Immaculate looks to 1968’s Rosemary’s Baby for inspiration but opts for a convent in Italy for its setting and then we’ve got The First Omen which… also looks to 1968’s Rosemary’s Baby for inspiration and also opts to set itself in a convent in Italy… but it’s branded after the 1976 thriller The Omen. Honestly it’s kind of wild how closely these movies that came out within two weeks in the spring of 2024 twin one another and given just how much of an apples-for-apples comparison we’ve got between the two I felt like this was a good opportunity for me to pull out the “double review” format that I haven’t used in a while.\n\nUnlike the other movie I’m looking at today Immaculate is a non-IP property whose debt to a previous movie is less official and it was put out by the cool indie distributor Neon, but it can claim to have the bigger star at its center in Sydney Sweeney, who plays a young woman from Michigan named Cecilia who seeks to become a nun and has been sent to work at a convent in Italy which doubles as a hospice for elderly women of the cloth. While there she sees some odd things going on and gets some strange visions but things really kick into motion once it’s discovered that Cecilia has become pregnant despite having maintained her vow of chastity, which is determined to have been an immaculate conception by the people running the convent. However it become clear quickly that these people do not have her best interests in mind as they become increasingly controlling of her every move. A similar conspiracy seems to be happening in The First Omen, which also looks at a young American woman aspiring to be a nun who also travels to Italy (in this case Rome) to take her vows. This being a direct prequel to the Richard Donner film The Omen it is set in the early 70s and in prequel fashion seeks to explain how Damien came to be born and what forces led to his being handed off to the American diplomat played by Gregory Peck in that movie. This will play out in a similarly conspiratorial convent, this one an orphanage, that may be seeking to find a mother for the devil.\n\nLet’s start by going into The First Omen, which is in this rather odd position of being an extension of a horror franchise that I’m not sure people were really asking for a prequel to despite there being some pretty clear unanswered questions for a prequel to address. The original The Omen is pretty well remembered but is not a movie that should be taken as seriously as The Exorcist or Rosemary’s Baby. It was a movie that was plainly made to exploit the success of those other two movies and it has some cool kill scenes, has some fun with the creepiness of the kid in it, and has an all-timer score by Jerry Goldsmith but otherwise it’s kind of dumb. I kind of get the impression that the people making this prequel aren’t huge fans of the movie either because this doesn’t seem that interested in looking or sounding like the original film and when it does choose to echo the original it does so with hesitation. When I think of The Omen I think of pretty bold widescreen compositions and tons of gothic music and this doesn’t really do that. One could argue that’s a good thing as trying to hard to cater to nostalgia could be kind of cringe as well but I’m kind of mixed on what it tries to replace that style with. The film does try to mirror a couple of that movie’s kills, but a lot of its more memorable images feel more like something out of Jacob’s Ladder than The Omen and it also barters in some kind of out there body horror. In fact the film’s willingness to “go there” when it “goes there” in terms of graphic imagery is probably the best thing it’s got going for it.\n\nImmaculate, by contrast, while still a movie that’s plenty violent is a bit less creative with its bloodletting. However I’d say it makes up for this by nailing the sense of paranoia leading up to the bloodletting better than The First Omen does. Both are essentially movies that posit sects of the Catholic Church being complicit in the conspiracies befalling these expat nuns to be becoming anti-Madonnas, which is something of a subversion of how these devil movies usually go given that the Holy See is usually the cavalry coming in to save the day at the end of these things. Nell Tiger Free and Sydney Sweeney are both pretty good in their respective films at portraying these innocents who become unwitting incubators and find themselves fighting back against the control being exerted on their bodies. Both movies could be seen to be post-Dobbs decision parallels to one degree or anther but I think Immaculate is a bit stronger in this regard because the pregnancy is front and center in that one whereas The First Omen kind of delays that aspect of its story in service of trying to hide what is in fact an extremely obvious plot twist, especially given that this is a prequel and we know exactly what all this is leading up to. Immaculate by contrast has a much more successful twist which actually takes things in a more interesting direction.\n\nReally though, the main reason that Immaculate works better is just that it’s a tighter and more intense than The First Omen, likely in part because it’s about a half hour shorter. I cared more about the Sydney Sweeney, I thought she reacted to the situation she was in more logically, and when the movie really ramps things up in its third act it starts to get legitimately intense leading into a really good finale. That’s not to say it’s a perfect horror movie by any means. It has a kind of a weak villain and probably could have stood to have a stronger supporting cast, and like the film I’m comparing it to it sort of feels obligated to add some kind of cheap jump scares and kills to the proceedings to make sure audiences don’t get bored, but I was overall impressed. As for The First Omen, well I admired some of its audacity and appreciated that it was at least trying to do something with the assignment it was given but at the end of the day it kind of lived down to the reputation of the original The Omen in that it’s kind of a middling movie that’s only occasionally elevated by a couple of cool isolated scenes. So I have a pretty clear favorite between the two in this comparison but man, the fact that two films that are so similar are coming out back to back like this does kind of hurt both of them. I feel like things could have maybe been scheduled a little better all around.\n\nThe First Omen: **1/2 out of Five\n\nImmaculate: ***1/2 out of Five\n\nFor far too long my copy of Kino’s “Pioneers of African American Cinema” sat on my shelf unwatched until last year I decided to finally do something about it and I did a whole crash course looking at the eight Oscar Micheaux movies that were in the set. I can’t say that all the movies held up but it was an interesting and rewarding experience nonetheless. However, that boxed set still has eight other movies from other various filmmakers on it and it was high time I finally finished off this boxed set I (mostly) blind bought by doing another crash course of everything else the set has to offer. I’ll be doing that shortly and will just go ahead and watch the movies in the order they appear in across the set.\n\nThe Flying Ace (1926)\n\nThe first three movies I’ll be looking at all come from disc two of Kino’s set, which is sort of informally themed around “race films” that featured all black casts and were intended for black audiences but which were produced by white owned companies and mostly directed by white men. This film, The Flying Ace, is a famous example of this in no small part because it’s survived relatively intact in a way that many other such films have not. In fact it was prominently featured in a notable scene from the 2023 musical remake of The Color Purple, with the characters in that movie going to the movie and theming a musical number around it. There is good reason to think that the movie did in fact play in Georgia, where that movie is set, because it was produced by a Jacksonville based company called the Norman Studios, which was run by the film’s director Richard E. Norman. Norman was a white businessman who was reportedly something of an ahead of his time liberal who believed that “representation mattered” but who also most likely saw profit to be made in making product for an underserved market. Norman would often travel to towns and get the locals to volunteer to be in the movies in small parts and sort of turn it into a community project, but would cast professional actors in the leads. In the case of The Flying Ace, which is the company’s only surviving film, he cast a fairly well known stage actor named Laurence Criner in the lead who is one of the better parts of the movie.\n\nThe title and poster art for this movie imply that this is a stunt filled war movie along the line of Wings, unfortunately that’s not really the case. There is a pilot in the movie and another guy who’s a World War I veteran but most of the movie is set on the ground and the few scenes in the air were achieved either through stock footage or camera tricks. Lots of close ups of people in their cockpits with smoke in the back to give the illusion that they’re actually flying but they’re not. The majority of the plot is a sort of mystery with various characters trying to get to the bottom of the robbery of a railroad payroll delivery from a small town train station. There are a few too many characters in the film to keep track of and maybe a few more twists than are really necessary. The film is interestingly clear minded about police corruption but otherwise operates in very Hollywood “black hat/white hat” kind of morality. The film also rather notably makes no reference whatsoever to the fact that the characters in it are black or to race as a social issue, it’s bartering in a sort of race-blindness. That’s not inherently a bad thing but it is a contrast to the films we saw from Oscar Micheaux, which were constantly examining prejudice and colorism in way this doesn’t and that might be a mark of the fact that this was made by white producers. The movie overall is, fine. It gets an additional interest from being one of only a handful of surviving “black” films from the era but beyond that I can’t say it stands as a truly great example of silent filmmaking.\n\n*** out of Five\n\nTen Nights in a Barroom (1926)\n\nTen Nights in a Barroom stands as another “race film” made by a white owned (or in this case co-owned) studio, in this case a Philadelphia based studio called the Colored Players Film Corporation. The CPFC was founded by David Starkman and Sherman H. Dudley, the former of whom was white and the latter of whom was black, though it appears to be that Starkman was the one more involved in producing the actual movies while Dudley was more the businessman. Together they only produced four movies of which only two have survived, with Ten Nights in a Barroom being one of them. This film is actually one of several adaptations of an 1854 novel called “Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There” by Timothy Shay Arthur, a wildly popular book about the evils of alcohol consumption that was by some accounts the second most popular book of the 19th century behind “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” and was a major influence on the temperance movement which culminated in the era of prohibition that was going on during the making of this film. So in that sense this isn’t exactly the most radical of films to be making, but of course adapting “white” source material with a black cast is something that people still debate about the merits of doing to this day so perhaps this was more ahead of its time than its subject matter would let on.\n\nThe film is perhaps best notable for being the most prominent surviving film to star Charles Gilpin, a prominent African American actor of the era who mostly worked on the stage and was something of a rival to Paul Robeson. Gilpin plays a guy who finds himself ruining his life through alcoholism in fairly melodramatic fashion. I think this particular brand of 19th Century moralism was already considered a little corny by 1926 and I can imagine this tale of drunkenness and bad parenting might have come off as something of a negative stereotype in the black milieu if not for the fact that everyone watching would have known this was an adaptation of a non-black source material. One thing that does ring a little strange in this context though is the ending, in which the story culminates in vigilante violence… essentially a lynch mob engaging in black on black violence, and that’s something that I’m not sure the filmmakers fully thought through the implications of. Or maybe they did and I’m just overthinking things. There are some interesting cinematic moments and ideas here like a scene where the main character starts visualizing a glass of booze as a snake or that aforementioned climax with the angry mob, which is at least filmed very well. I’m not sure that an adaptation of this silly dated novel was ever going to be the making of great cinema and I’m not going to hold up director Roy Calnek as some master of the form, but the movie isn’t too shoddy and is an interesting watch.\n\n***1/2 out of Five\n\nThe Scar of Shame (1929)\n\nThis is the other surviving film made by the Colored Players Film Corporation and certainly the more ambitious of the two. Where most of the other silent movies I’m looking at for this series are barely over an hour long this one is a full 86 minutes and has reasonably impressive production values as “race movies” go. However, like Ten Nights in a Barroom the film is very much a melodrama that’s working with narrative conventions that do not necessarily jive with modern tastes. The film is about a guy from an upper-middle class-wealthy family who falls for a girl from the “other side of the tracks” who’s being beaten and abused by her alcoholic father (the writers for the Colored Players Film Corporation were plainly fans of prohibition) and this leads to a bunch of struggles and heartbreak as various capital-M Melodrama transpires to keep them apart and the movie does not end particularly happily. Like with Ten Nights in a Barroom the film is not terribly concerned with the racial politics of its day, instead focusing on class issues in a fairly “colorblind” way, though there are some mentions of “our race” in the title cards that at least acknowledge that this is a movie about black people.\n\nThat the film has relatively high production values (by which I just mean it isn’t noticeably cheap) was a bit of a trademark of the Colored Players Film Corporation, but was also sort of their undoing. The company was specifically targeting an urban and Northeastern black audience, the “elite” section of the black community, and doing that meant paying a bit more for sets and hiring Broadway trained actors. That meant more expenses than some of these other independent “race film” producers and even when their films were “hits,” like The Scar of Shame was, they didn’t necessarily recoup enough money to pay for the production budgets. The other big problem they were facing down was the emergence of “the talkies,” which they knew they’d have to adjust to in order to stay competitive and they just didn’t have the money to do that, so they didn’t try. The company folded after having only made four movies. Still they clearly had a legacy. I’d say of their two surviving films Ten Nights in a Barroom has a bit more going for it. It has a few more moments of cinematic invention like the bit with the snakes and while its temperance movement politics were and are kind of dated, they’re dated in a ways that’s a bit more interesting than the Stella Dallas-lite stuff we get out of The Scar of Shame.\n\n*** out of Five\n\nEleven P.M. (1928)\n\nFor the next two movies from Kino’s The Pioneers of African American Cinema boxed set I’ll look at a pair of movies from the set’s third disc, which seems to be kind of unofficially themed around movies that come from more fringe voices which almost border on being “outsider art.” That’s probably a bit more true about the next movie I’ll be looking at but this one is certainly an oddity itself. Eleven P.M. was made by an afro-Cuban immigrant named Richard D. Maurice who is something of a mysterious figure. He made two independent movies in his life, one in 1920 called Nobody’s Children, which was apparently successful but has been lost and then Eleven P.M. nearly ten years later which still exists but whose production and original release is so obscured by history that film scholars can’t even agree what year it originally came out with most assuming it was made in 1928 but others thinking it came from later. Beyond that all we know is that it was made in Detroit and that after it was made Maurice left filmmaking and became a somewhat notable figure in labor activism before dying in obscurity in the mid-1950s. The one movie he left behind though, is quite interesting and has become something of a “discovery” in recent years.\n\nEleven P.M. is a kind of surrealist movie, albeit one that doesn’t necessarily announce itself as one right upfront. It’s about a writer who has an eleven P.M. deadline and ends up falling asleep and dreaming about the melodramatic book he’s writing, which plays out on screen with the same actors who are in the framing story. That story is not unlike some of the other melodramatic movies we’ve seen in this crash course like The Scar of Shame with this story about a woman being pushed into a marriage with people who are actually gangsters but it’s not played “straight” and at a certain point reality really starts to be in flux and someone turns into a dog to end the story before this is all revealed to have been a dream. Sounds pretty creative and ambitious and conceptual, but it kind of toes the line between being weird in a good way and being just kind of ramshackle. The film’s production values are of course next to nothing and while Maurice seems to be a creative guy I wouldn’t call him a natural visual stylist and he seems to be working with completely amateur actors. Still, of all the movies in this boxed set this one gives me the biggest pangs of “what if?” Given more opportunities and resources I think this guy could have really been somebody in film and accomplished bigger things, but the world didn’t allow that to happen. Still, he had the drive to at least get this movie made and it’s still interesting people nearly a hundred years later, that’s more than what a lot of people manage.\n\n***1/2 out of Five\n\nHellbound Train (1930)\n\nAnother movie from an unusual source in the “Pioneers of African American Cinema” boxed set is Hellbound Train, a movie made by a pair of Evangelical preachers named James and Eloyce Gist who would travel from church to church and show these cheap Christian movies they made accompanied by sermons. The most famous of these is Hellbound Train a movie with a rather literal title as it’s about this train being engineered by Satan himself (a dude in a very unconvincing Halloween costume) and each car in the train represents a different class of sinner who the devil has rounded up to drive into hell for their evil ways. These sins include such horrendous deeds as “dancing” and “listening to jazz music” and “not repenting at church” alongside more traditional criminal activity as well as religious hot buttons like abortion. These “train cars” are essentially jumping off points to show various filmed sketches about this sinful behavior and the consequences for them both on earth and in the afterlife as these people are tempted into these behaviors by the dude in the devil suit. So, obviously I have pretty substantial objections to this movie on moral and political grounds and even most people today who are basically on board with the message would probably laugh at the film’s Jack Chick like scolding tone. It’s also obviously an incredibly amateurish piece of work, albeit an ambitious one given what the movie is, so it’s obviously not a great piece of filmmaking on its own. That having been said, I was certainly consistently interested while watching the movie both for its value as a historical artifact and also for a sort of Reefer Madness-like unintentional comedy value to the whole thing.\n\n*1/2 out of Five\n\nThe Bronze Buckaroo (1939)\n\nI will be rounding out my excursion into Kino’s “The Pioneers of African American Cinema” by looking at a trio of talkies featured on the set’s fifth disc starting with this sixty minute B-Western starring Herb Jeffries. Jeffries was primarily a jazz singer but had a side career starring in these “race films” with titles like Harlem Rides the Range and Harlem on the Prairie which have in some ways had a longer lasting legacy than his musical endeavors. Like many of his films this was written and directed by Richard C. Kahn, a very workmanlike white filmmaker who specialized in poverty row productions, and like a lot of the “race movies” directed by white people this seems to barter in a sort of extreme colorblindness. The movie basically never acknowledges that all the cowboys in the city are black and if they had wanted to give film’s screenplay to an all-white cast they wouldn’t have needed any real alterations. There’s nothing wrong with that necessarily, though I must say that some racial politics or commentary being injected into this would have been welcome because it otherwise does not have much going for it at all. This is just the most stock “evil black hat rancher tries to steal land and is fended off by a white hat hero” plotline you can imagine and Kahn doesn’t do much to add any real flair to the proceedings. You almost get the impression that they just assumed that having an all-black cast was all the novelty they needed to impress the film’s underserved audience and didn’t really bother to excel otherwise.\n\n** out of Five\n\nThe Blood of Jesus (1941)\n\nThe final films in the “Pioneers of African American Cinema” boxed set are a pair of films from a man named Spencer Williams, who in many ways had a rather fascinating career. Williams was originally an actor (in fact he had a small role in The Bronze Buckaroo) and would eventually reach some level of national fame (and infamy) playing Andy in the “Amos and Andy” TV series, but for a stretch in the 1940s he found himself directing as well. His debut film The Blood of Jesus is his most famous work and is argumably the most famous non-Oscar Micheaux film in this entire boxed set. Interestingly the film appears to have been made for the same kind of religious circuit as another movie from the set, Hellbound Train, and shares most of that movie’s questionable values but is significantly better and more intelligently executed. The film looks at a woman who is nearly killed in an accident and finds herself in a sort of purgatory state in which she’s drawn into temptation or salvation by a literal devil and angel represented by dudes in what appear to be Halloween costumes. The film is certainly using this scenario to highlight sins that would lead to this woman’s damnation but the focus seems to be more on rooting for her salvation than it is on relishing in the judgment of the sinners like it was in that other film. All of this is of course done on a shoestring, it’s not the cheapest movie I’ve watched during this crash course but it is lower budget than The Bronze Buckaroo (which wasn’t exactly huge budget affair to begin with) but it is made with some moxy. There are limits to how much I’m going to praise a “Christian movie” and I also don’t think this has that much to offer people who aren’t looking at it as a historical artifact but I do get why people find this more interesting than average.\n\n*** out of Five\n\nDirty Gertie from Harlem U.S.A. (1946)\n\nThe last movie in Kino’s “Pioneers of African American Cinema” boxed set is one with a title that feels like something out of the exploitation movies of another era, perhaps a precursor to the next great wave of black cinema that would emerge with 70s Blaxploitation. The title is misleading, however, “Gertie” isn’t really dirty and the movie is about how she’s misunderstood by outside observers. The Gertie in question is a nightclub performer who has traveled to an island community for a performance gig at a local hotel and when she arrives a bunch of local men become infatuated by her, much to the concern of the local church leaders. This makes the film something of an interesting contrast to Spencer Williams’ other film in the set, the religiously themed The Blood of Jesus, with this one having in some ways a more critical view of the church and its more judgmental tendencies. The movie is also generally interested in the various ways in which men become objectifying and possessive of women, though its ending it perhaps a bit muddled about its own views of these topics. Lots of fodder here for essays if people are looking for that. As a movie unto itself, well, like a lot of movie in this boxed set it’s more interesting as an artifact than as an example of filmmaking. It is cool to see some more of Spencer Williams though an to see that he’s not just some two dimensional evangelist as his other movie here might suggest.\n\n*** out of Five\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAnd with that I’m finally done with this boxed set. And that leads me to ask, was this boxed set worth buying, and on that I am conflicted. On one hand I certainly don’t regret watching these movies. They’re all very important artifacts of film history: I’m very glad they’ve been preserved and I definitely learned a lot from watching them. That having been said these movies sit kind of oddly in my collection. Most of them are objectively just not favorite movies of mine after watching them and are not necessarily the kinds of things that rank high enough that I’d ever buy them individually. A lot of them just aren’t even the kinds of things I’d buy just in terms of format with a lot of them running only about an hour long. The two movies in the whole set that I feel most needed to be in my collection ended up being the two I’d seen before buying it: Oscar Micheaux’s Within Our Gates and Body and Soul and I can’t say the rest stacks up to either of them. Looking back I may have been better off just streaming these or finding them at the library or something because I don’t think I’ll be revisiting these often. But still, it was worth the exploration and I don’t have too many regrets.\n\nI skipped Ghostbusters: Afterlife when it came out in theaters in late 2021. That was a decision that was partly the result of the pandemic. We were going through one of those variant surges at the time, and while there were movies I was still willing to mask up and go to during those conditions, that highly questionable franchise reboot wasn’t one of them. I did see the discourse around the movie, which was largely negative, firstly because a lot of people viewed the movie as something of a capitulation to the people who were shitty on the internet about the all-female 2016 Ghostbusters remake and secondly out of a generalized backlash to nostalgia pandering in Hollywood movies. That first objection seemed unfair firstly because Ghostbusters: Afterlife was plenty female and diverse itself and secondly because the film was made by Ivan Reitman’s son and did feel like a somewhat sincere tribute on some level. I was, however, a little more persuaded by that second objection when I finally saw it, which was ironic given that the movie actually did change quite a bit about the series formula in terms of setting and tone. Like, people would deride the movie’s unoriginality while also complaining that it didn’t faithfully recreate that movie’s comedic sensibility, which are kind of contradictory complaints. That’s not to say I particularly liked the movie because I didn’t, but I didn’t hate it either, it kind of just seemed like a garden variety 2020s Hollywood legacy sequel that had some fun moments combined with some cringe ones. Three years later we’re getting a sequel and in some ways the culture war complaints about the previous movie feel like old news now, but the nostalgia complaints see as alive as ever and audiences seem to now agree given the way they’re responding to things like Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, so I’m not sure how this is going to be received. Personally I probably would have skipped it as well had it come out in a busy November again, but they wisely put it out during an early spring dead zone where my standards of what I’m going to give a watch are a lot lower so I decided to give it a go.\n\nThe movie begins two years after the events of Ghostbusters: Afterlife and the now blended family form that movie has moved to New York and set up shop in the fire station from the first movie and begun busting ghosts again funded by Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), one of several paranormal investigation operations he’s invested in. Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd) and Callie Spengler (Carrie Coon) are not officially married yet but Grooberson has been slowly becoming something of a stepdad to Tevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace). As tends to be the case ghost busting remains a controversial activity in New York and after a dangerous incident the optics of bringing teenagers along to paranormal incidents become an issue for the family. Trevor, having recently turned eighteen is still able to go along but the decision is made that they need to leave Phoebe behind to avoid litigation, much to her discontentment. Feeling left behind she starts to form a friendship with a teenage ghost she meets in the park, little does she know that this teenage ghost is part of an elaborate plan by an ancient deity to escape from containment and unleash a frozen destruction upon the world.\n\nWhen the trailer for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire came out a lot of people were critical of the fact that it, and by extension this whole reboot series, had abandoned the comedic roots of the franchise in favor of more dramatic ghostbusting storytelling, an accusation that both is and isn’t true. On one hand there was actually plenty of more straightforward blockbuster storytelling in the original Ghostbusters including the heroes going up against an visual effects heavy apocalyptic threat at the end. This is what distinguishes it from other comedies of the era and is probably why it remains a “geek” staple in the way that something like Trading Places isn’t. It also ignores that, despite some perhaps misleading advertising, this reboot is hardly devoid of comedy. Both movies star Paul Rudd and both have fairly silly ghost encounters and this one bolsters those elements even more by more extensively featuring some of the original cast (particularly Dan Aykroyd) and also brings in Patton Oswalt in a small role and also introduces Kumail Nanjiani , who I suspect will be a permanent cast member if the series continues. The difference is that the comedy in question is less “80s Saturday Night Live” and more MCU quips and occasional sight gags. Now, while I do think it’s unfair to say this isn’t a comedy at all, I wouldn’t call it all that successfully funny either. The movie has clever lines here and there but I wouldn’t say I was rolling on the floor laughing through this thing either but I wasn’t exactly cringing at the jokes either, I was kind of more passively entertained by them.\n\nThe other big complaint about Ghostbusters: Afterlife is that it pandered too much to nostalgia. Personally I didn’t think it was too much more guilty of this than the likes of Star Wars: The Force Awakens or Top Gun: Maverick but I’m not going to say the whole “resurrecting Harold Ramis with CGI” thing wasn’t cringe. This sequel doesn’t have anything as egregious as that in it but it does still feel the need to go back to the Slimer and Stay Puft Marshmello Man well in sub-plots and there’s also a very dumb callback to the library ghost. These are silly, but I feel like a certain amount of this was always going to come with continuing this franchise and none of it went too far over the line in my view. The bigger problem is probably just that while these new characters aren’t “bad” per se I don’t think any of them have really caught fire. Paul Rudd is mostly wasted here and Carrie Coon doesn’t have much to do here either. The “kid” characters here also don’t really have that much going for them on paper though the young actors playing them do have enough charm to kind of coast on. The side characters fare a bit better in places and there’s a potentially interesting sub-plot here about the Phoebe character potentially befriending (perhaps even having a crush on) a teenage ghost, which maybe doesn’t get used to its full potential but does keep things at least a little interesting. All in all, the movie is pretty “mid,” but it did keep my attention and you can do worse as far as mid-spring studio programmers go. At the same time though, I don’t feel that inclined to give the movie a total “pass” either. It’s something that aims for mediocrity and achieves it and I’m not sure I entirely want to award that.\n\n**1/2 out of Five"
