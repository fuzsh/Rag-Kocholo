        "text": "Despite the many announcements of its death, the western has recently reappeared in American cinema and literature, reinvigorating a tradition that spans from James Fenimore Cooper’s Hawkeye to the Lone Ranger and John Wayne. Among the many recent productions, this volume considers American films, literature, and music, produced between 1985 and 2011: movies such as The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Roberto Ford, The Ballad of Little Jo, Brokeback Mountain, 3:10 to Yuma, Don’t Come Knocking, the TV series Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman, the novels Blood Meridian, God’s Country, and hick-hop music. Matching western, men’s, literary, and film studies, Bordin reads the western as a gendered cultural product, which comments on pivotal contemporary themes such as issues of fatherhood, homosexuality, gaze, and race and gender appropriations. Building upon Judith Butler’s notion of the performative nature of gender, Bordin analyzes how the western interacts with models of American masculinity, confirming the genre’s crucial role in the American cultural and ideological landscape at the turn of the new millennium.\n\nDoctoral Dissertation in Humanities Syracuse University 1996 Oklahoma! and South Pacific were Rodgers and Hammerstein's most successful and popular musicals of the 1940s. This study demonstrates their function as modern morality plays for their audiences. Specifically, the two musicals provided Americans with a prescription for a postwar Paradise. This was a Paradise based upon the American Dream of rebirth and renewal acted out in a landscape of second chances. The components of this Paradise are examined in topical essays that consider such issues as Americanism, consumerism, tourism, racism, and optimism. Each of these elements links what would otherwise appear to be disparate narratives: the American West at the turn of the century and the South Seas during World War II. The most significant connection between the two musicals and the basis for a postwar Paradise is the geopolitics of an expanding American frontier, paralleling the nation's evolution from a national to a global power in the years during and after World War II. Sources such as Western films and recordings of the singing cowboys, popular images of the Pacific Islands, travel literature and advertisements, anthropological and sociological tracts on race and ethnicity, the theology of Reinhold Niebuhr, and foreign policy publications are used to demonstrate Oklahoma!'s and South Pacific's connections to contemporary discourses and to provide historical and cultural contexts for understanding the musicals. Finally, Chapter 7 explores the relationship between the emergent postwar youth culture (the \"Children of Paradise\") and the issues raised by the musicals.\n\nIn 1934, Mascot Pictures took a chance on a relatively unknown singer named Gene Autry. Mascot had a new film serial about a technologically advanced empire living in caves 25,000 feet underground that needed a leading actor. When The Phantom Empire premiered the following year it not only launched Autry’s career, it launched a new genre that introduces future technology into a frontier setting: the science fiction western. Since that first genre hybrid, many have followed including The Wild Wild West (1965-1969), Westworld (1973, 2016-), The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr (1993-1994), and Firefly (2002). These examples, and many others, amply display the appeal of this form of hybridity and its continued importance in American media. While many scholars over the past twenty years have explored the complicated use of the western in filmed and written science fiction, few music scholars have delved into the way score and sound design have questioned the stories and sounds from westerns and reinterpreting them for a new genre and generation. This chapter brings attention to and encourages more music scholarship about the science fiction western by approaching the subject in two ways: first, it presents a musical history of the genre highlighting the ways it reinterprets the western in sound; then, it presents a close reading of two recent science fiction westerns – the television show and MMO Defiance (2013-2015) and the film Cowboys and Aliens (2011) – in order to identify the musical and sonic tropes that have come to define this vital subgenre."
