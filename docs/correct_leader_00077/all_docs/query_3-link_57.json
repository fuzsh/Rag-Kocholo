        "text": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56441644\n\nMax Jakobson (September 30, 1923 ‚Äì March 9, 2013) was a Finnish diplomat and journalist\n\nFrom 1953 to 1974 he was employed by Finnish Ministry Foreign Affairs eventually acting as ambassador to the United Nations in 1965-1971 and to Sweden in 1971‚àí1974\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Jakobson\n\nThus in a conflict between a great power with wide and varied interests and commitments and a small nation with the single objective of survival, the balance of forces cannot always be calculated by simple arithmetic. (p XVII)\n\nFinns learned about ideological solidarity in 1939. Even Marshal Gustav Mannerheim, a man unusually free of sentimentality, was moved to declare at the end of the Winter War, \"We have paid our debt to the West to the last drop of blood.\"\n\np XXIII\n\nFrom the ruins of the tsar's empire Finland emerged in 1917 as a sovereign state, and Lenin's government was the first to recognize it. No doubt in hope that an extension of Bolshevik Revolution into Finland would bring back to the Soviet Union what had been lost by Russia\n\np15\n\nIn the Anglo French vocabulary, the term (‚ÄúBaltic states‚Äù) referred exclusively to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, while Finland was included among the Scandinavian states.\n\nOn Russian maps, Finland too was a Baltic state.\n\np44\n\nWinston Churchill later wrote in his memoirs that Russia's neighbors \"could not make up their minds which to fear more German aggression or Soviet protection.\" ‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ In reality at least Finland and the Baltic states had no difficulty in making up their minds; they had no fear of German aggression, while Soviet protection seemed to them the gravest threat to their independence.\n\np71\n\nThere is a permanent Finnish-Russian agenda, and it has only one item: how to reconcile the stubborn Finnish will to independence with the Great Power ambitions of Russia?\n\np115\n\nThe Swedish government was treating Finland the way a man might treat a mistress whom he wishes to discard as gently as possible. (In september 1939)\n\np.121\n\nthe speech by the delegate from Leningrad at the Supreme Soviet had struck an ominous note. \"From whom does Finland hope to get help?\" he had asked. \"Poland, too, had a guarantee. . .\"\n\np134\n\nAs the Finns were leaving [Nov 3, 1939], Molotov said cryptically, ‚ÄúWe civilians don't seem to be making progress; now it is the soldiers' turn to speak.\" It was the closest to a threat of force he ever uttered throughout the talks.\n\np135\n\nIn retrospect, it seems insanely illogical that the military precautions that had been thought necessary at the beginning of the negotiations were relaxed the moment the negotiations had ended in failure.\n\np140\n\nBut [British Minister] Snow succeeded only in making himself un popular in Helsinki and had to be recalled soon after the war broke out, presumably as a penalty for having been right.\n\np141\n\n[in November 1939 Marshall Mannerheim] clearly favored further concessions rather than risking a war that could only end in disaster; even giving up Hanko was in his opinion \"unpleasant rather than deadly.\"\n\np150\n\n\"In three days it will be all over,\" Soviet diplomats in Berlin told William Shirer, the American correspondent.\n\nAdvance units of the Red Army were even warned not to cross by mistake the Swedish border.\n\np168\n\nFor the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic could not wage a conventional, bourgeois war against another or another nation. It had never waged such a war‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶The invasion of Finland also had to be justified in the face of Marx and Lenin; the bombs dropped on Helsinki had to have an ideologically acceptable address. p168\n\nIn December 1939 the superiority of the Soviet forces advancing into Finland from four directions was indeed overwhelming.\n\nNine Finnish divisions, with 14,000 men in each, faced four Soviet armies, altogether about half a million men\n\np172\n\nIn the Western world, Finland's fight was written off in advance as no more than an heroic gesture, a romantic act of defiance, a reckless refusal to face the cold facts of modern warfare, or simply national suicide.\n\np173\n\nThe first month of fighting had shown the Soviet war machine to be clumsy and inept. All along the lengthy front it had either broken down completely or at least been brought to a standstill.\n\np174\n\nHe [Holsti] did it brilliantly, insofar as the obvious can ever be brilliantly stated. No one actually needed to be convinced; even the most loyal supporters of the Soviet Union found it hard to justify the invasion of Finland as an act of self-defense.\n\np178\n\nFinns were disappointed in Sweden, angry with Germany.\n\np184\n\nFrom his [Mussolini] point of view, therefore, Finland was fighting a delaying action that kept Soviet power tied up in the North; every day that the Finns held out was a day gained on the Balkan front [Bessarabia].\n\np188\n\nHitler was convinced that \"Russia never intended to make up this fight, for otherwise she would have chosen a different season.\" For this reason it was unfair, he thought, to criticize her military effort\n\np189\n\nAs [V√§in√∂] Tanner bitingly remarked to the American Minister in Helsinki, Finland had taken during the first months of fighting more arms from the Russians in war booty than she had received from all friendly powers put together.\n\np194\n\nOn paper, the French design looked like a grand pincer movement of continental scope-from the Arctic to the Black Sea.\n\np203\n\naccording to Marshal Mannerheim's estimate, almost half of the regular divisions normally stationed in Europe and western Siberia were engaged against Finland.\n\nThus the effects of the Winter War were being felt far and wide throughout the Soviet Union.\n\np217\n\nWhile the politicians deliberated, the pressure on the Mannerheim Line was mounting by the hour. The position at Summa ‚Äì the Verdun of the Winter War ‚Äì miraculously was still in Finnish hands\n\np225\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Summa\n\nSeemed fantastic to ask üá´üáÆ to surrender voluntarily what her army had successfully defended. Usually diplomats follow soldiers, presenting vanquished w/ bill for what been lost in the field. Molotov reversed normal procedure by demanding advance payment for victories not yet won\n\nIt was easy enough for the Swedish government to advise the Finns to sacrifice Karelia to save their lives; to a Finn it meant cutting off his right arm; and not everyone was as tough and unsentimental as Tanner, who preferred self-mutilation to suicide.\n\np237\n\n[June 1941] \"Continuation War\" the Second Round of the conflict that had opened with the bombing of Helsinki on the last day of November 1939. [and ended March 14, 1940]‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶Finland was not an ally of Germany: she was a co-belligerent [from 1941-1944]\n\nShe was not a German satellite: Nazi ideology or methods made little headway in Finland and attempts to impose them were firmly rejected.\n\nShe fought for her own ends, not those of Germany.\n\np257\n\n/end\n\nInteresting book on the üá´üáÆ Winter war. Main focus (&very insightful) is on the diplomatic side, hardly any info on the military developments\n\nProbably lot of overlap with V√§in√∂ Tanner‚Äôs book. I‚Äôll just share the table of contents (haven‚Äôt read it)\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2615772\n\nMore on military side is The Hundred Day Winter War\n\nFinland's Gallant Stand against the Soviet Army\n\nby Gordon F. Sander (which I skimmed)\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17130644\n\n‚ÄúThe truth is, even when one removes the distorting effect of the Western media, as well as that of the rigid Finnish press censorship, there is a core of truth to the legenda of the Winter War, which perhaps explains why it still has such abiding force in Finland‚Ä¶\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶As such, the Talvisota [Winter War] clearly ranks among the great defensive sagas of military history, alongside Thermopylae, Masada, the Alamo, and the Battle of Britain.‚Äù\n\np22\n\nSander‚Äôs book has some nice maps and photos\n\nSuomussalmi. Siilasvuo. Raate Road.\n\nThree-quarters of a century later, those names still carry mythological weight in Finland, and with good reason.\n\nUnquestionably, the destruction of the 163rd Division at Suomussalmi, and the subsequent decimation of the highly regarded 44th Division at Raate Road by the outnumbered, out-equipped Finnish forces led by Colonel Hjalmar Siilasvuo, ‚Ä¶\n\nranks as one of modern Finland's proudest moments, as well as a classic military double victory with few if any precedents in the history of modern warfare.\n\np187\n\nThe Russians seemed to be more put out by the loss of the equipment than that of their men: Moscow Radio announced that if the Finns didn't return the Soviet equipment they recovered at Suomussalmi and Raate, the Kremlin would declare war on Finland!\n\np203"
