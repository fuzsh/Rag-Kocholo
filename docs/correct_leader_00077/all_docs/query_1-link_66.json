        "text": "Los Angelese Eesti Seltsi siht on elus hoida eestlaste keelt, kultuuri ja rahvust ning tutvustada meie maad ja rahvust Ameerikale, kus eestlased nüüd elavad. Los Angelese Eesti Selts (LAES) on poliitiliselt neutraalne ja ei poolda ühtki poliitilist erakonda, parteid ega liikumist üle teiste, olgu see siin Ameerika Ühendriikides või Eesti Vabariigis.\n\n2019/2020 Juhatus\n\nRenee Meriste - president, Raivo Neggo - laekur, juhatus : Andres Ruetman, Kaie Pallo, Mall Arusalu, Mati Laan, Tiina Kaskla ja Andres Ruetman\n\nHistory\n\nThe Estonian Community in Southern California, 1976-2018\n\nby Edgar Kaskla\n\nLecturer, Political Science\n\nCalifornia State University Long Beach\n\nThe Seventies and Eighties: Estonian Culture as Everyday Event\n\nThe 1970s into the 1980s might be called the Golden Age for Estonians living in Southern California. With the exception of the Estonian Society of Los Angeles, founded in 1928, other organizations started in the 1950s with the arrival of the first group of émigrés coming from Estonia in the wake of World War II. The community came together for the first time on 11 September 1949, at Sycamore Park in Pasadena, and all of the different organizations from the choir to folk dancing to a Lutheran church congregation can trace their origins back to that picnic adjacent to the Southwest Museum. Though events were held at various rented halls over the next few years, the Estonian community found a permanent home once the Estonian House opened in 1953.\n\nWhy the Golden Age? Certainly Estonians were not lacking for cultural and political activities in the fifties and sixties, but large renovations to the Estonian House made it a more comfortable venue for events, the younger generation of immigrants were now more settled into their family lives, and the first generation of Estonians born in the United States (as well as some in Canada, Germany, and Sweden) were interested in participating in these events as well. Looking back, it might be difficult to imagine that there were at least several events per week back then, ranging from choir and folk dance practices on Friday nights (where there were as many as 50-60 people routinely there, including guests who did not sing or dance and just came to the House to visit and “hang out”) to larger parties with dinner and dancing with 100-150 guests at the Estonian House. On New Year’s Eve, 12 tables on the main floor, three on the upper level, and three added card tables meant that reservations would stop at 150 and that any more guests would have to fend for themselves or spend the entire evening on the dance floor. The consul would usually give a brief greeting a few minutes before midnight (the very same tradition carried on today in Estonia by the president) and guests would ring in the new year by singing the national anthem.\n\nWhen not at the Estonian House, there was volleyball on Wednesdays, for years held at the Robertson Recreation Center in West Los Angeles, Saunaklubi on every other Thursday, first in West Hollywood, later in Burbank, and much more: American Legion meetings in Hollywood for those who belonged to Post 405, or maybe more sauna hosted by Arnold Müürsepp at his Inglewood home where another group of aficionados cleansed their body and spirit on a regular basis. For those performing in the theater group, there were rehearsals to attend. For the Lutheran church, Estonian Society, or Women’s Club, there were board meetings to attend. In other words, it was all Estonian, nearly all of the time.\n\nRenovation and expansion of the Estonian House in the early 1970s had a lot to do with making events more comfortable and convenient. In 1972-1973, two properties adjacent to the Estonian House became available. Long-time Estonian Society member and activist Arne Kalm looked at the potential economic benefits, and Estonian House president Endel Sillat helped carry through the purchase of the two parcels. Teams of two and three visited the homes of Estonians to ask for contributions to buy the properties, and eventually, the buildings on the lot closest to the Estonian House were razed, the lot two doors down the street with three apartment units (known to all as the Red House due to its red brick facade) and a back house (the White House) became a stream of rental income that the Estonian House has used to finance itself ever since. Major renovations to the roof and ceiling of the main hall ensued, the front door was moved off of the street, and the now-emptied lot became the parking lot to help alleviate parking problems in a very crowded (and then somewhat dangerous) neighborhood. A grand opening party for the parking lot in September 1975 had about 150 guests seated for the outdoor “picnic” where young people solicited additional donors to “adopt” the various trees and shrubs surrounding the parking lot. Most of those original plantings are still there.\n\nAdditional improvements were made to the Estonian House a few years later. A second hall, “Kungla,” was built in the late 1960s, mostly by Arnold Müürsepp, and used mainly as added space for the Estonian Sunday School. Later, a refrigerator was added and one end became a kind of bar area (with a memorably primitive particle board top) while Friday evenings were spent playing table tennis at the other end of the room or playing chess against the likes of Heino Kurruk or Tõnis Rebane. Carpenter Heino Virro was the primary builder in renovating the space by building a wooden bar area with cupboards, adding closets, wood trim throughout, and completed with a warmer carpeted floor and wooden bar furniture. Renovations on Kungla began late in 1979 and were completed in 1980. With smaller groups now more the rule than the exception, it has become a focal point for most meetings and events held at the House.\n\nIn 1976, the Estonian Women’s Club of Los Angeles published a cookbook featuring, of course, Estonian food, the first published outside of Estonia in two languages and still a necessary aid in Estonian kitchens to this day.\n\nThe first international Esto get-together was held in Toronto in 1972 and the second Esto took place in Baltimore in 1976. As has become the tradition, much of the year’s activities were dedicated toward those participating as singers and dancers at Esto, remembered for the torrential downpour that took place at Baltimore Memorial Stadium during the dance festival, leaving dancers and their hard-to-find traditional folk clothing drenched with rain.\n\nThe year marked a turning point in relations between Estonians at home and abroad. A few LA Estonians had visited the homeland starting in 1973. A few more followed in 1974 and 1975. Each time, there was intense criticism of these visits coming primarily from Toronto and New York, including the editor of the Vaba Eesti Sõna (Free Estonian Word) Harald Raudsepp. Any visit to occupied Estonia—so the thinking went—was a de facto acknowledgement of the legality of Soviet occupation, thus all such visitors were traitors to the cause of Estonian freedom. Two families decided to return to Estonia a second time in 1976, setting off fireworks among critics given that their travels coincided with Esto. In other words, the two families skipped Esto for real Estonia. This became all the more problematic for the opposition when one family was able to get permission to visit Saaremaa when it was almost impossible for even most mainland Estonians to visit the island given that it was identified as a border zone (or piiritsoon). At any rate, the opportunity to visit Estonia at a relatively young age was a life-changing event because it allowed one to see how the Estonian language and its culture managed to survive despite angry Russians swearing when one didn’t have the correct change at the newspaper kiosk and the red and yellow banners across Tallinn celebrating the international and everlasting friendship of the workers in Estonia and Kazakhstan. What? Had most Estonians ever even met an ethnic Kazakh? Inside, Estonians were still Estonian, but one had to experience this firsthand in order to understand and appreciate it.\n\nOnce back in Los Angeles, the Laan and Kaskla families gave a presentation of what they had seen and done in Estonia, featuring a slide show as well as large photo albums (in blue-black-white covers, by the way) filled with additional pictures taken on the trip. Presumably most of the local critics were not there, but the evening still filled the room with people interested in what was going on in the old country. When showing slides of the relatively newer Mustamäe apartment blocks (built in the 1960s), Valdur Kaskla also introduced the audience to a song that was not known in Los Angeles, “Mustamäe valss.” The trip also brought Raimond Valgre’s “Saaremaa valss” to LA for the first time, and choir director Jaak Kukk soon composed a choral arrangement for that song still used to this day. Yes, Estonian communities were that isolated for that length of time, which is probably hard to imagine in this day and age.\n\nA hardline approach toward the Soviet Union was on display again in 1977. The Soviet Union had a traveling show highlighting all of the great technological innovations and friendly relations between Soviet cultures which made its way to the LA Convention Center in November 1977. The Estonian Society of LA decided to picket the event and to pass out flyers reminding visitors that much of the Soviet Union included occupied countries like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Some of those passing out literature urged people not to go inside while others simply reminded visitors of the political realities of what the USSR represented. Just a few years later in 1980, the Estonian Society also organized a joint protest with Latvians and Lithuanians during Captive Nations week at what today is known as Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe Estonian Society had two functions. Politically, it organized the annual commemoration of Estonian independence day on 24 February, always with proclamations from the City of Los Angeles and the County Board of Supervisors, and often a council member or supervisor would hand deliver the document to great applause. The Estonian Society also helped to coordinate relations between members of the Baltic community, including annual commemoration of the anniversary of mass deportations on 14 June, which rotated between the three countries’ societies each year. With the end of the Soviet Union, the importance of this coordination and of political work in general, has changed from this period in time. The Estonian Society also put out a magazine, Teataja (the Caller) about past and upcoming events. Publication stopped in the mid-1970s and attempts to restart it in the late seventies failed. Fortunately, the local Estonian Lutheran Church’s newsletter calendar of events took up the slack, as have social media notifications in the 21st century.\n\nThe Baltic community tried to hold intact via relationships developed within the confines of the Republican party. The GOP had built out what they called the National Republican Heritage Groups (Nationalities) Council as a means by which to attract voters from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union via the party’s strongly anti-socialist, anti-communist stance. A smaller group of Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians worked as part of this heritage groups project. However, enthusiasm and funding for this specific project dissipated with the rise of Reaganism in the early 1980s, but the idea of coordination and the need for a more unified Baltic effort to publicize the continuing occupation helped lead to the Baltic American Freedom League (BAFL), formed in Los Angeles in 1981. BAFL continues to remind elected officials that the Baltics remain precariously on a border with a Russian state whose leader seemingly cannot always be trusted.\n\nThe Estonian Society was also responsible for organizing and advertising cultural events. These parties became tremendously popular starting in the early 1980s, with the large hall filled with people. Typically, these parties would have a theme and would rely upon members of the folk dance group Kivikasukas for entertainment with dance, song, or both. There was a sea-themed party (featuring “Miki merehädas” with Uve Sillat as the sea monster), Disko, a Saaremaa night, kauboi party, Hawaiian night (with Asta Anderson, accompanied by Inge Kask and Helge Laan as Minni Vinni), simman (a folk party), a circus theme, “spring fling,” and much more. In fall, there would usually be a Mardipidu (or Halloween), also with the Estonian House packed full of people, two ashtrays per table, dance music provided by the Larry Larson Quartet or Fred Ott Trio, and nearly every party ending with people crowded around a table or two singing “Sauna taga tiigi ääres.”\n\nNo event at the Estonian House would be complete without the work of Salme Tiideberg, who prepared meals for virtually everything that happened from the 1960s into the 1990s. She was always in the kitchen, prepping, then cooking food for these parties, anniversaries, birthdays, and any other event on the event calendar. She was assisted by her right-hand man Rosie and later, his assistant Curtis, who worked with her in the kitchen of the Beverly Hills Hilton. In addition to preparing food, she also donated to the Estonian House and owned several shares in Estonian House, Inc. Once the dinner was completed, Salme would stand on the stairs leading to the kitchen, Rosie would come out and wave, and they would be thanked for their hard work. This scene was repeated a hundred times or more.\n\nThe Estonian Mixed Chorus continued to be led by two conductors, Rein Neggo and Jaak Kukk, celebrating its 25th anniversary at a gala concert at the newly built Latvian House, the venue chosen because the Estonian House was too small. The folk dance group Kivikasukas, directed by Virve Lillipuu benefitted from an influx of young dancers in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In addition to providing entertainment to events at the Estonian House, the dancers also became the face of Estonia with performances at outside venues such as the Fisherman’s Days at Ports o’ Call Village in San Pedro, May Day events in Santa Barbara and at Cal Lutheran College, International Day at UCLA’s Sunset Village, and most importantly, at the annual Danish Days festival in Solvang, where Kivikasukas danced every year for more than a decade. In addition to performing dances, the dancers also took part twice in the Danish Days parade and won an award in 1987 for “most enthusiastic group.” Folk dancing broke off for some time into two groups. The Puurattad (literally, Wooden Wheels) was comprised of older dancers, and as a Puuratta member Uno Pormeister once said, “I love dancing, but I don’t love heart attacks.” The Puuratta repertoire was set up with less jumping and slower paced polkas to avoid cardiac arrest.\n\nBoth choir and folk dancers focused their attention on performing at either the West Coast Estonian Days every two years or the worldwide Esto events. The next West Coast festival in Los Angeles took place in 1979 at Loyola Marymount University in Westchester with Bruno Laan the president of the Estonian Days and the Estonian League of the West Coast. The smoked sausages ordered for the Days stuck around for months after the event, as did cases of specially labeled Estonian Days wine, the last bottles with leaky corks finally ending their lives as vinegar in 2017. The next Esto followed in 1980 in Stockholm, Sweden, and most of Kivikasukas traveled to participate in that event.\n\nThe choir celebrated its 30th anniversary in 1980 with a concert at the LA Mart located near the garment district in downtown LA. Again, the Estonian House was not big enough for the number of people attending. The concert was followed by a dinner dance featuring big band music and people dressed to the nines in long gowns and tuxedos.\n\nEven before there was an Estonian House, there had been Estonian theater performances, and the goal was usually to prepare a play in time for performance at the Estonian Days wherever that might be. For 1979, Kadi Karist-Tint went somewhat avant-garde with “Kuningal on külm” (“The King is Cold”) a political play metaphorically criticizing Soviet power and featuring Rein Taagepera as the King. The LA troupe also performed a cabaret-style set of musical and dance performances, appropriately titled “Kabaree” before and during the 1979 Days at the Estonian House. In the eighties, Elo Kabe, Kulle Lippand, and Kaarel Tanner were featured in “Suured segadused” (“Great Confusion”), Kabe and Lippand soon returning to the stage for “Armujook” (“The Love Potion”). Jumping ahead to 1989 and the next West Coast days in LA, Lya Kauk directed “Abielu ettepanek” (“The Proposal”) with Kulle Lippand and Tiina Kaskla in lead roles. In between, Lembit Palm-Leis did “Ärimehed” (“The Businessmen”), Lya Kauk directed “Inetu pardipoeg” (“The Ugly Duckling”), and Eduard Kikas directed a series of gems, including “Džinnimäng” (“The Gin Game”) with Astra Shore and Johannes Nukk, “Sauna kuuldemäng” (“The Sauna” radioplay) with Shore and Kaarel Tanner, and later in the 1990s, “Karikakar ja Tõrvalill” (“Driving Miss Daisy”) with Astra Shore and Ülo Kaskla. “The Gin Game” was so well received and viewed by actors visiting from Estonia that Astra Shore and Johannes Nukk went on to tour Estonia with the play, including a performance at the Drama Theater in Tallinn. Doing a complete play involves and enormous commitment of time and effort, and many of these individuals have done great work for small but appreciative audiences.\n\nSomewhere along the way, a number of people had acquired kannels, roughly the Estonian version of a lap harp or zither, and it was decided to meet regularly to practice songs together. The kannel group named itself “Vanemuine,” and included members Inge Kask, Edgar Kaskla, Helge Laan, Aino Laur, Virve Lillipuu, and Tiina Repnau. The group played at many different parties and events, including Christmas music during the annual choir and folk dancers’ Christmas party (called a Jõulupuu, literally meaning a Christmas tree) and at several themed parties. However, the best-remembered performance took place at the 1983 San Francisco West Coast Estonian Days Rahvapidu at Marine World/Africa USA where the kannel music was drowned out for several moments by lions roaring in the background. They wanted their food, not music.\n\nThere were also other organizations that put on occasional parties or events. What was once the Spordiklubi (Sports club) evolved from soccer and volleyball to the Suusaklubi (Ski club). Soccer had been abandoned (except for Ülo Kaskla and Hillar Paju who played for various clubs into their forties), and the volleyball team continued to play in the annual Baltic tournament (and occasional open tournaments plus tournaments held at the West Coast Estonian Days), but most of the activities shifted to skiing, which became very popular during this time. In addition to the annual China Peak weekend in March where LA people met up with Estonians from the Bay area (two busloads of LA skiers, usually with a waiting list for late cancellations!), the club also organized annual bus trips to Mammoth Mountain and showed Warren Miller ski films at the Estonian House for added inspiration.\n\nAt some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s, the so-called Noorteklubi (Youth club) had died off, so several attempts were made in the early 1980s to try to resurrect it. Since the original Noorteklubi had liquidated its funds, a few ambitious young people put up their own money to pay for these events, all of which fell deeply into the red and led to bad blood between Estonians and a Lithuanian band that stopped playing when the singer/bassist broke a string and claimed “that’s it” because they were owed money from a previous gig involving another Estonian (not involved in the planning of this party, it should be noted). A handful of Estonians had regularly visited the Lithuanians’ youth center in the Atwater district of LA, but this busted string also more or less busted that friendly relationship.\n\nThe 350th anniversary of the University of Tartu’s founding was celebrated wherever Estonians live, and Southern California was no exception. A formal dinner dance was held at the Ambassador Hotel in 1982 which included singing of “Gaudeamus igitur,” speeches, and a dance performance by Kivikasukas. The Ambassador had previously been used as headquarters for the West Coast Estonian Days and as it so happened, the hotel was closed soon after the event, the property sold, and the facilities torn down, replaced eventually with a high school.\n\nAlongside the bigger, noisier events, Estonian culture was also being tended to via MÜLA or Metsa Ülikool Los Angeleses, which derived its name from a similar group with similar goals in Canada. Starting in the 1970s, a number of prominent Estonian cultural and academic figures gave talks at MÜLA events where the primary organizers were Madli and Jaan Puhvel (from UCLA), Mare and Rein Taagepera (UC Irvine). The first meeting took place at the homes of the Puhvels and Taageperas, the very first one in 1975 with Tartu University Chemistry Professor Ilmar Koppel. One of the more noteworthy early MÜLAs involved Lennart Meri and the screening of his two important anthropological films in 1979, “The Waterfowl People” and “Winds of the Milky Way.” From 1985 on, a series of visitors made their way to LA, including Neeme Järvi (who was raising money to record and commit to vinyl the works of composer Eduard Tubin); Vilen Künnapuu, Ain Padri, and Andres Siim (who had won an architectural design project for a Los Angeles gateway that was never built); Mark Soosaar (with his film on the “Women of Kihnu”); artist Jüri Arrak (presenting his paintings of what can only be called antlered people); and the Estonian State Philharmonic Chamber Choir (conducted by Tõnu Kaljuste) in 1990. As travel restrictions were loosened, there were more visitors, and the idea of MÜLA had run its course. Similarly, more people were traveling to Estonia in the era of glasnost and perestroika, so interactions were not as “exotic” as they had previously been. But as Mare Taagepera has said, for that period of time during the seventies and eighties, “MÜLA played an important role in the cultural life of Estonians in Los Angeles.”\n\nThere is an interesting but problematic historical study of relations between Estonians in Estonia and so-called Estonians in Exile and the role played by VEKSA (Väliseestlastega Kultuurisidemete Arendamise Komitee; roughly Estonians Abroad Cultural Exchange Development Committee, which also published a propaganda newspaper designed for Estonians abroad called Kodumaa (Homeland). Author Indrek Jürjo’s account includes the document that Lennart Meri filed once he returned to Estonia from his trip to the United States. In other words, Soviet authorities required information on what they did, whom they met with, for what purposes, and so on. Jürjo seems to imply that Estonians living in other countries were not fully aware that they were being reported on or that visitors may have been propagating propaganda with those they met. This is misleading. Everyone knew that such reports were filed, and when working tours involved multiple people coming to the Estonian House, to private homes, or some other event, it was assumed that at least one person was a KGB agent. At a MÜLA event (probably the Chamber Choir appearance), a friend asked a group of visitors point-blank: “So, which one of you is the spook?” It got a big laugh but no one answered. Of course, by the late 1980s, the Singing Revolution was in full swing and most people no longer worried about who was saying what; they took it as a joke because at that point, it literally was.\n\nThe Boy Scouts and Girl Guides (Eesti Skaudid and Gaidid) had been a crucial part of the community’s life from the 1960s on through the 1970s. The scouts were led by Avo Piirisild (1976-1977), Elmar Koik (1978-1980), Lembit Palm-Leis (1980-1981), then Elmar Koik again until the troop “Tulehoidja” (“Lightkeeper”) disbanded in 1985. The Gaidid were led by Virve Lillipuu during this period. Both groups participated in larger camps held in Northern California (such as the famous “Karulaane” camp with Bay area scouts in Mendocino) and in Lakewood, New Jersey for the girls. “Tulehoidja” always had a very high number of Eagle Scouts, indicative of a troop where boys were determined to take on the many projects needed to attain top honors and scoutmasters who put time and effort into the organization. Elmar Koik has called this period the heyday of scouting, and Eagle recipients during this era were Thomas Tael (who also attained Life Scout status), Steven Tael, Olav Padjus, Steven Liivoja, Alary and Remy Piibe. Both Skaudid and Gaidid disappeared from view in the eighties, due mainly to a generational gap; there just weren’t enough boys and girls in the right age groups to keep things going.\n\nIn 1985, Estonian Consul Ernst Laur passed away. The Estonian Society, with a strong helping hand from BAFL and its connections to the Estonian American National Committee, implored the Estonian diplomatic corps led by Ernst Jaakson to name a new consul to Los Angeles rather than letting the consular position lapse. Jaak Treiman was named an honorary consul, assuming the position in March 1986 where he continues to this day. Whereas earlier years involved attending diplomatic events and acting as a symbolic representative of Estonia, the consul’s job has become more complex in the post-independence era in dealing with passport distribution and other documents in addition to all of the symbolic duties of belonging to the consular corps, attending events, and representing the country and its people.\n\nFrom the New Awakening to Independence: A Changing Role for Estonians Abroad\n\nThe coming of Mikhail Gorbachev did not lead immediately to changes in the Soviet Union nor did it change relations between Estonians in Southern California and those living back in the homeland. The ideas of perestroika and glasnost, however, combined with the push for change that had been underway in Poland via the Solidarity, would soon lead to the Uusärkamisaeg (“The New Awakening”) that, in a few short but tumultuous years, would lead to Estonian independence. The nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 also signaled that technologically speaking, it would be impossible for the USSR to conceal events that were happening within its borders.\n\nThe first hints at change trickled out of Estonia in 1987. Photographs of student protests in Tartu against phosphorite mining were sent out weeks after they occurred in the spring, followed by documentation of what the mining project entailed. The snowball started to roll. The anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact led to the Hirvepark (Deer Park) meeting on 23 August with hundreds of people appearing at the park. Recordings of the meeting were spirited out of Estonia and Consul Treiman played some of them on New Year’s Eve, 1987. The Heritage Society (Muinsuskaitse Selts) was formed. Most people did not comprehend exactly what was going on; everything was in flux, suddenly everything was changing. By 1988, still more changes were taking place. The song cycle of “New Awakening Songs” by Ivo Linna and In Spe were introduced in Tartu and tapes of those songs soon found their way to California. The so-called Öölaulupidu (Night Song Festival) came on the heels of Tallinn’s Vanalinnapäevad (Old Town Days) which led to the open display of the old blue-black-white flag of Estonia and the near-miss of ESSR Chair Karl Vaino apparently requesting that the military be sent to help restore order, only to be overridden by other members of the local government who insisted that this intervention was unnecessary.\n\nLocal orthopedic surgeon Dr. Hendrik Leesment was visiting Estonia at the time and used his new video camera to record and document what took place at these late-night song festivals on those consecutive evenings. Dr. Leesment shared these videos, first with his brothers in the fraternal organization Korp! Rotalia, then on a Friday night with the help of the Estonian Society at the Estonian House. The images of tens of thousands of people singing into the early daylight hours of Tallinn, the flag making an appearance, then hundreds appearing the next night were nothing short of amazing.\n\nThe Estonian House became a different place. Yes, MÜLA now featured cultural stars like Mark Soosaar and Jüri Arrak, but other cultural “stars” started turning up as well at events organized by the Estonian Society. For example, animated filmmaker Priit Pärn came to Hollywood to participate in a film festival and showed some of his works at the Estonian House. People who had been imprisoned as dissidents made appearances at the Estonian House, hosted by a consul without, in effect, a country: Tiit Madisson, Heiki Ahonen, later, Lagle Parek. On any given Friday, the Kungla Hall, known affectionately as the Tagatoa Trahter (or “Backroom Trattoria,” was suddenly filled with relatives and guests from Estonia. On one such Friday, this included two young men who had supposedly escaped via East Germany, Tauno Waidla and Peter Sakarias. They were house guests of BAFL leader Avo Piirisild and Women’s Club president Viivi Piirisild. On 12 June 1988, Viivi Piirisild was found brutally beaten and murdered. Waidla and Sakarias were arrested in September, convicted, and eventually sentenced to death in Piirisild’s murder. It was a jarring moment. Firsthand descriptions of the murder scene by Ben Nurmsen (who found the body) were horrid and took away from the positive political and cultural direction that everything seemed to be moving in.\n\nFortunately, the overall momentum did not change. The Popular Front was organized, the summer of 1988 ended with Eestimaa Laul (Song of Estonia) that drew a crowd estimated to be around 300,000 people, and the same Taageperas who were refused visas to travel to Estonia previously stayed in the rain to soak in—literally and figuratively--what was happening. It did not end there. Back in LA, Korp! Rotalia was celebrating the 75th anniversary of its founding at the Biltmore Hotel in November, with members and their families coming from across North America and Europe. Even as the formal events for this four-day affair were ongoing, there was word that something big was happening back in Estonia. Telephones and fax machines let everyone know that more changes were coming. Within the week, the “Declaration about sovereignty” was issued by the Estonian government, and while it stopped well short of declaring independence, the movement had taken a definite turn in that direction. Even so, there were Rotalia members who were skeptical of any changes, and though the meeting ultimately led to a draft statement that the organization would do everything it could to support the cultural and political freedom of Estonia, that statement was read in original form by ignoring the recommendations of more cynical, old school members who refused to acknowledge what was happening. In a sense, it brought back the same disagreements and zero-tolerance thinking that had framed discussion of Estonians visiting their homeland in the 1970s.\n\nEvents in Estonia comingled with Estonian life in Southern California in 1989. The Estonian flag replaced the ESSR flag on 24 February and in August, the Baltic Chain took place when Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians held hands from Tallinn to the Lithuanian-Polish border. The West Coast Estonian Days took place at the Sheraton Universal hotel in July, and as with everything at the time, it was suddenly different. In addition to the traditional choral singing and folk dancing, the entertainment included Rock Hotel, which performed at the Noortepidu (Young peoples’ party) held at the Roxy night club on Sunset Blvd, at the Veterans’ dance, and at the Rahvapidu (Folk party) that closed the Estonian Days. The final event was held at Calamigos Ranch in the Malibu Hills in 105 degree heat (Fahrenheit, about 41˚ C) but the band kept playing even though keyboardist Margus Kappel could not find shade and was visibly victimized by a fast-moving sunburn. Reet Linna was the featured guest at the children’s party, singing to the children and leading them in group games. Cellist (and singer) Tiitrich Bürger performed at multiple events. For good measure, songwriters Alo Mattissen and Jüri Leesment came along for the ride, later talking about their “awakening” songs when the Days ended and Metsa Ülikool Läänekaldal (MÜLK, the more inclusive coastal version of MÜLA) convened up Pacific Coast Highway at UC Santa Barbara.\n\nDuring the Estonian Days, Rock Hotel plus Alo Mattisen performed live on a local morning television show on KCal 9, and the band’s appearance at the Roxy was covered on local evening news. For the first time, the Estonian Days pins were ordered from Estonia as a way of helping the budding market economy at a time when such help was needed. An Estonian TV (ETV) film crew comprised of Tõnis Kask, Mati Põldre, and Peeter Roos, documented the events and this became part of a film started on the island of Saaremaa called, “Seal kaugel lääne serval” (“There, far away on the Western edge”) which first aired on ETV in the fall of that year.\n\nIt was all surreal. Harri Kõrvits played Leopold on a kid’s show in Estonia and now he was having a beer (sans his Leopold costume) at Telly’s Bar in the hotel, with owner Telly Savalas (of “Kojak” TV fame) sitting on a barstool 10 feet away.\n\nIn 1990, the blurring of geographic distances continued. A group of theater people came to the Estonian House, comprised of Margus Allikmaa (then at Tallinn’s Drama Theater), Raivo Trass (Rakvere), Kersti Kreismann, and Tõnu Aav (also from Tallinn). Kreismann and Aav performed “Rita koolitus” (known here as “Educating Rita”), and Trass presented a reading of “Me lendame mesipuu poole”). Kreismann also performed in the LA theater presentation of “Rahu maa peal” (“Peace on Earth”), later performed at the West Coast Estonian Days featuring a family drama with real family members, Tõnis, Aili, and Lia Rebane. Kreismann returned to Los Angeles in 1993 along with Jüri Krjukov, performing “Toalahing” (“Battle in the Room”).\n\nMusical theater was represented by Tõnu Kilgas and Katrin Karisma, who performed a series of duets taken from their musicals. Those who attended still sing “Ananass” every time they pick up a pineapple. And continuing his stay in Southern California, Rein Rannap played piano at many events at the Estonian House, at the Latvian House for a BAFL event, in church, and from time to time in various night club venues. He also appeared on KCRW radio’s “Morning Becomes Eclectic” with a live in-studio concert. His wife, singer Katre Kõiva, also performed numerous times at various events at the Estonian House.\n\nOne of the first serious challenges to changes in Estonia occurred in May 1990 when supporters of the pro-Russian Intermovement stormed the gate to the courtyard at the government building on Toompea in Tallinn. Popular Front leader Edgar Savisaar alerted Estonians that Toompea was being attacked, leading to thousands of people rushing to the square in front of the building, and the Intermovement supporters backed away and left the courtyard. This was yet again a reminder that there were risks and challenges to be overcome. A sizable group of younger Estonians from LA and San Francisco spent several weeks in Estonia that summer. Food stores were pretty empty, but with dollars, the chain of Amerest stores helped make that summer nothing short of magical. Despite the anger of the “Inters” as they were called, Estonians were not about to go back on the changes already made.\n\nMeanwhile back in Southern California, folk singing brothers Mart and Jaak Johanson first caught the attention of LA Estonians who saw them perform as part of the Tallinn Old Town Days/Estonian Youth Days in June 1989. They performed at UCLA, at a venue in San Diego, then at the Estonian House to an enthusiastic audience in November 1990. They were scheduled to make yearly return trips but did not come back again until 1992. They also sang together with the Urb brothers who had been living in the Los Angeles area for a few years already, apparently for the first time. That folk summit meeting took place at a private residence.\n\nWork began on one of the more ambitious stage plays of recent times, “Kosjasõit” (“The Courtship”), not because of the substance but that it required a cast of dozens, including a chorus of singers and peasants who would break out in folk dance. It also required orchestral arrangement and recording of a sound track. The leads of star-crossed lovers were played by Johannes Nukk and Elo Kabe. Many, many practices later, “Kosjasõit” was staged for the 1991 West Coast Days in Seattle and played for the local Southern California audience a year later at Barnsdall Park in LA.\n\nVery tense moments were to come in August 1991 as a coup unfolded in Moscow and it was not clear what might happen next. Informal telephone chains developed among Estonians here. If someone heard something—anything—from friends or relatives, they called others and let them know what they had heard. CNN and CNN Headline News also helped keep people more informed than they had been just a few years earlier. The coup collapsed without any military orders being passed down, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Estonia declared its “reindependence” on 20 August. For several days, the United States held off recognition of the new government, but finally, it did. A loosely organized celebration at the Estonian House was arranged after Labor Day weekend with some Latvians and Lithuanians participating, and an even bigger party took place at the larger Lithuanian center in the Silver Lake area a few days later.\n\nThe transitional period before and immediately after Estonian independence was very difficult in the homeland since food was in short supply and the move away from a state-based economy meant that unemployment rates and price inflation would be high for years to come. The Women’s Club led by Asta Liivoja, Luige Lill, Helge and Bruno Laan, stepped forward to organize Merevärav (Sea Gate) that allowed people to send packages of goods (dry foods, clothing, etc.) via shipping container to Estonia to either family or friends, or they could donate boxes to send to people on a list of those in need. Merevärav was a great success in that it did help at a time when it really was needed. In the late 1990s into the 2000s, Merevärav took on a different task, namely collecting donated books (mostly written in Estonian) and shipping out of print titles to various libraries across Estonia. Many books had been banned in Estonia during Soviet occupation, so this filled in collections with books that had been published mainly in Sweden, some in Canada and the United States.\n\nOne of the forgotten moments in the early history of the new Estonia took place in 1992. For the first (and maybe only) time, Estonians outside of the country were allowed to vote for its new president. A polling place was set up at the Estonian House coordinated through the consul’s office and people could choose the president. Since none of the candidates received 50% of the vote, the final vote went to parliament which elected Lennart Meri over Arnold Rüütel even though Rüütel took more of the popular vote.\n\nThe end of Soviet occupation was the culmination of a four-year struggle. It had many ups, a few downs. Looking back, there were also many difficult philosophical or ideological battles being waged locally as well. The same divisions that pitted some against those who wanted to visit Estonia and reconnect with familial ties permeated this awakening period. Estonian Society board of directors meetings which started collegially enough over radish salad sandwiches often lasted three and four hours in this period, with some insisting that “we can’t trust those Popular Front people” or that “we can’t know whether or not those Deer Park people might actually be double agents.” True enough. Fifty years of oppression left an indelible mark. However, it was also reflective of a paranoia in American society that was starting to grow in the 1990s and came to dominate social relations in the 21st century. When passing out flyers in front of the Convention Center in 1977, it was assumed that someone was taking pictures; when arguing with Soviet Estonian economist at a MÜLA meeting, it was assumed that this would garner a negative report back to VEKSA authorities. One had to do the right thing, no matter what. Ultimately it was trust in society and community that prevailed, and Estonia had regained its independence.\n\nFreedom, however, changed the dynamics and purpose of being Estonian outside of the newly independent country. Whereas the entire raison d’etre had been to draw attention to the plight of an occupied country so small that it was mostly ignored, now it was about how to support Estonia and what it meant culturally to be Estonian. The lyrics to the song say, “Eestlane olen ja eestlaseks jään” (“I am Estonian and so I will stay”), but that line could easily be ended with a question mark. What does that mean? Estonians here have struggled with finding that meaning for a quarter of a century.\n\nThe Slow Fade: The Estonian Community in Transition\n\nWith independence in hand, both political and cultural objectives started to change. So too, did the community. Those who were in their middle years back during the Golden Age now had reached retirement and a fair handful of active community stalwarts relocated to the heat of the Palm Springs area. Many of the younger people active a decade earlier remained active into the 1990s, though the folk dance group stalled as the longtime leader Virve Lillipuu dealt with health issues and new Kivikasuka director Eeve Sork lost some dancers during the pauses that occurred due to Lillipuu’s absences. The big parties and dinner-dances were more the exception than the rule, but some did continue in the form of anniversary birthdays (for Estonians, every five years counts as a juubel) and funeral wakes. But folk dancing did continue despite the blips, the choir continued its Friday night rituals albeit with 20 singers rather than the 35 that one was used to, and newer organizations like the Seenioride Klubi (Seniors Club) met once a month on Wednesdays, and Eesti Köök (Estonian Kitchen) offered authentic Estonian food once a month on Saturdays. Both newer groups usually have some type of presentation or guest speaker to accompany their lunch menus.\n\nNo Friday evening was complete without bridge at the far end of Kungla hall. There were often more than four players, so pairs would switch out to let everyone play. This ritual would repeat whenever and wherever possible, so the annual general meetings of the church congregation, the Estonian Society and Estonian House Inc. (known locally as “Super Sunday,” usually in March) would end with a card game. In addition, the American Legion Post 405 moved from Hollywood and became Baltic Post 405 with monthly meeting in the Kungla hall on Tuesdays. But the signs of diminishing participation were starting to show. The Women’s Club still organized the annual Christmas bazaar where one could buy traditional blood sausages and gingerbread cookies, but the rest of its monthly activities stalled out. A second cookbook was planned and recipes taste-tested, but never moved beyond planning to being print-ready. The everyday experience of living the Estonian life was not gone, but was starting to slowly fade.\n\nNevertheless, one of the highlights of the nineties was undoubtedly the visit of President Lennart Meri in September 1993. Meri made a few remarks (but as many will recall, his speech pattern included many long pauses, so it still took some time to say a few words), posed for many pictures, answered some questions, and was given a tour of the Estonian House. The building was also inspected and cleared by the Secret Service prior to his arrival, which was exciting in its own right. Equally exciting was his attaché, always by his side in smartly pressed uniform. Yet again, it had a kind of surreal feeling to it. It was that guy, in our house.\n\nThe primary focus of the Estonian Society was to organize the Estonian Independence Day commemoration and to help coordinate cultural events, particularly those involving visiting artists, musicians, and the like from Estonia. Rein Rannap, Marju Kuut, the Urbs, and a few others had lived in the area for some time (then returning to Estonia), but now there were people passing through on tour or were in LA to record, film, and so forth. Ivo Linna and Antti Kammiste performed at the Estonian House in 1994, followed about a year later by Karl Madis. Many others were to follow in the 2000s, and for those familiar with pop and rock music, this has been a godsend.\n\nAnother moment of horror occurred in 1994 with the sinking of the MS Estonia in a storm on the Baltic Sea. Local Estonians again put together informal telephone chains to let people know what was going on, who had been rescued and who had perished. In moments of tragedy, the information that was exchanged was a symbol of a community that still held together.\n\nRotation of the West Coast Estonian Days came back to Los Angeles in 1999. Recognizing the changing purposes and objectives of being Estonian going into the next millennium, president Arne Kalm added a business convention to the schedule, allowing Estonian businesses to present and to shop their wares in California. The Estonian Days were held at the Sheraton Long Beach and the convention side was coordinated with the help of the Long Beach Chamber of Commerce. For the first time, the community was also faced with the reality that there were no longer enough active singers and dancers who would commit to performing at the Days, so choirs and folk dance groups were invited from Estonian to augment local forces. The featured performers at the ball also came courtesy of the old country: Sirje and Väino Puura. Theater continued to be an important part of cultural life, this time including people on stage who had emigrated from Estonia in more recent years, such as Leila McLaughlin and Eeve Sork. The play, “Pisuhänd” (“The Bobtail”), which had been staged half a century earlier in LA also included veteran actors like Ülo Kaskla, Johannes Nukk, and Kaarel Tanner.\n\nMoving into the 21st century, the loss of participation in community events can also be explained by those who spend extended time in Estonia. After all, why go to a concert in LA if you can do the same thing in Estonia? Why watch folk dancers in Long Beach when there are Song and Dance Festivals in Tallinn every four or five years? Indeed, the festival years have replaced a lot of what happened during the Estonian Days and Estos in years past. Tallinn’s old town is filled with familiar faces from other Estonian communities, be it friends from New York, Toronto, or Portland, and everyone is stopping to have a beer at Nimeta Baar or a giant pancake at Kompressor.\n\nLos Angeles sports fans got a thrill in March 2000 when Estonian runner Jane Salumäe won the women’s portion of the LA Marathon. A handful of local runners had participated in the marathon since its inception and Jüri Tint regularly finished in the top ten in his age group, but this was the first time that an elite runner won first prize. There was a brief reception for her at the Estonian House, though understandably she did not stick around for very long. For a few hours, however, it was very exciting to watch an Estonian runner on television at the head of the course and to hear the announcers repeat “the runner from Estonia” time and again.\n\nThe theater group took the road again in 2004, performing “Patuoinas” (“The Scapegoat”) at Esto in Riga, Latvia, featuring a large cast but lead roles for Eeve Sork, Jüri Tint, Helena Seli, Johannes Nukk, and the patuoinas himself, Uve Sillat, directed by Astra Shore. In addition to meeting up again with Ivo Linna and Antti Kammiste (who were there to perform), visiting the Estonian House in a rather sketchy part of Riga, and drinking cocktails at the Radisson SkyBar, it also gave everyone an excuse to stay in Estonia for the weeks after Esto had concluded. The Dance and Song Festivals followed just a few days later, unfortunately with yet more unforgiving rain that left performers and audiences soaked to the bone.\n\nWhen every five-year interval in one’s life is something to celebrate, the same can be said for organizations. The choir celebrated its 50th anniversary with a concert in 2000, the Estonian Society celebrated number 75 in 2003, and the Estonian House had its 50th in 2004. The choir also followed with a 60th featuring a guest performance by the LA German women’s choir, Dammenchor Frohsinn (the choir had performed at their concerts on several occasions) and its 65th was memorable since it was the last time that Jaak Kukk directed the choir. Rein Neggo had retired in 1991, leaving Jaak Kukk as the sole conductor until 2003, whereupon Kaie Pallo took over his duties. Though he was not in top health, Kaie Pallo convinced Kukk to come out of retirement in 2015 to conduct three songs. At the end of the concert, the choir presented him with a wreath of oak leaves as tradition has it at the national song festivals.\n\nThe chamber choir has made a number of visits to Southern California, most recently in November 2018 (previously 2004), performing at UCLA’s Royce Hall. Neeme Järvi, Paavo Järvi, and Eri Klas have conducted the LA Philharmonic, Anu Tali has conducted the Pacific Symphony (2017), and the entire National Symphonic Orchestra (led by Eri Klas) toured the United States, including a stop at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts in 2009. Each time that some performance is scheduled, the community gets the word out to go and see them.\n\nThe volleyball team succumbed to old age in the early 1990s but it has been “replaced” by spectator sports. The Estonian men’s soccer team played the USA at Cal State Fullerton in May 1994 (and lost 2-0), then won a friendly at the LA Coliseum against El Salvador 2-1 in February 2012. The Estonian women’s basketball team also played a friendly against UC Irvine in 1996, unfortunately a losing effort for the Estonian side, but a pleasant reception took place after the game at the Irvine Barclay Theater. A much different spectator sport also emerged on the scene, owing much to the success of a guy named Baruto, real name Kaido Höövelson. Baruto came from Estonia, made a splash in the very Japanese sport of sumo wrestling in Japan, and he was one of the people who helped popularize the sport beyond the islands of Japan. A team of sumo wrestlers, including women, came to Los Angeles first in 2002, again in 2008, and probably will visit at some point in the near future (given that the US Sumo Open is an annual event). A sizable group of Estonians turned out at UCLA to cheer the wrestlers on and to no doubt make frequent visits to the snack bar.\n\nThe next Estonian Days in Los Angeles took place at the Biltmore Hotel in 2009. Prior to the event, a project named “Kodu kauniks” (“Beautify our home”) was organized by Mall Arusalu to raise funds to update the exterior of the Estonian House with new paint, trim, and other accessories, such as a new address sign. Robert Anderson took the lead in making the updates and the renovated Estonian House was ready to greet guests on the final open house day of the extended weekend event. Estonian Days President Jüri Tint had been coy about why he was letting his hair grow out. When the play, “Kihlus” (“The Engagement”) hit the stage at Barnsdall Park with Tint in ponytail and bare feet, the secret was revealed. The piece featured Eeve Sork and Aivar Kokamägi as the lead couple, yet again relying on supporting actors who had become reliably excellent in everything they do: Tint, Leila McLaughlin, Helena Seli, and Uve Sillat. And as actor, director, or both, Johannes Nukk, has been a mainstay in just about every Estonian play that has hit the stage in Southern California over the past 60 years. The Days were highlighted by the Dance Festival performed at the nearby Wells Fargo Plaza, featuring both local folk dancers and guests from Estonia. The setting on a warm summer evening with beautiful dancing underneath imposing skyscraper towers at twilight was amazing.\n\nMusic is always an important part of culture and in 1999, not only was there choral music at the Estonian Days, but the Arsis hand bell ensemble also performed in Southern California for the first time. They returned some years later while on tour in the United States. The girls’ choir E-Stuudio also toured and made a stop at the Estonian House in 2009.\n\nAs mentioned, recent years have brought a lot of popular music to the Estonian House. The list includes Terminaator, Jaagup Kreem (acoustically), Tanel Padar, Ott Lepland, Marek Sadam, Mihkel Raud, Karl Madis with son Carl-Philip Madis, and Maarja-Liis Ilus accompanied by Hando Nahkur. There have also been concerts at other venues by groups like Boogie Company, Ewert and the Two Dragons, Marya Roxx, Metsatöll, N-euro and Trad.Attack!\n\nTheatrical performances with visiting artists go back to the 1990s. The two more recent performances were “Meri ja Orav” (with Egon Nuter and Andrus Vaarik) in 2014 and Mait Malmsten’s solo piece, “Fenomen” (Phenomenon) in 2016. Both concerts and theater no longer fill the hall as they once might have, but the audience has not lost its appreciation for Estonian art and culture. For a younger audience, Ivar Lett performed for the Estonian Sunday School kids and parents with “On vaid hetk” (“There’s Such a Moment”) also in 2014.\n\nAn unusual meet and greet event occurred at the Estonian House in December 2016. The television series, “America’s Got Talent,” featured an Estonian contortionist Vello Vaher, who made it through to one of the final programs in the competition. The Estonian Society hosted a lunch for Vello Vaher, where he did a brief display of his tricks and the entire event was filmed for a clip that aired on “AGT.”\n\nEstonians and the Finnish community also started to build stronger bonds. The Finnish Estonian Friendship weekend was started in 2015, involving camping along the Kings River at the Finns’ Hauli Huvila property. For those attending, it is a pleasant weekend of hot temperatures and leisurely tubing down the cold Kings, topping it off with evenings in the sauna.\n\nThe Estonian film industry has found a place in the global marketplace, and to that end, Estonian films have been screened at the Scandinavian Film Festival in Beverly Hills for the past decade or so. Estonian films are frequently shown at other local film festivals, including the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Consul Jaak Treiman and Estonian Society President Renee Meriste have been big supporters of Estonian cinema, no more so when the film “Mandariinid” (translated as “Tangerines”) was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 2017 Academy Awards. The filmmakers and actors were treated to a luncheon at the Estonian House on Saturday prior to the Oscar awards show.\n\nThe 2017 Estonian Days fell onto the shoulders of Los Angeles, with Uve Sillat agreeing to preside over the Days while relying heavily on the work of the Estonian Society and its board of directors to get it done. Society president Renee Meriste was an invaluable asset, as was treasurer (also from the Society) Raivo Neggo, Milvi and Mati Laan, to lesser degree, Andres Ruetman and Edgar Kaskla. As with previous Estonian Days, there was increasing reliance on Estonians from Estonia for entertainment: two choirs (Endla from Pärnu, Tartu Rahvaülikooli Segakoor from Tartu, of course), the folk dance group Sõna ja Tants, theater courtesy of the Seasaare Näiteringi Selts (Viljandi), and dance music by Boogie Company and Maarja Meriste-Kivi. Ivo Linna and Antti Kammiste were scheduled to appear, but Ivo Linna had a medical emergency and Kammiste played with Boogie Company. Marek Sadam jumped in to ably add to the musical entertainment.\n\nA few things stand out about the event, held at the UCLA Sunset Village conference center. First, it was among the hottest Estonian Days ever, with temperatures over 100 degrees (Fahrenheit; 37˚ C) and unusual humidity for California, making it feel even hotter. Second, the event was covered by both Estonian Television (with ETV’s Margus Saar doing the reporting for Aktuaalne Kaamera, later airing as a full program in November 2017) and TV3 which also covered the Days as part of its “Seven o’clock” news show. One of the reasons that it did catch the attention of the media had to do with the participation of Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, making him the first sitting Estonian PM to visit Los Angeles (former PM Mart Laar came to LA to accept an award in 2006). The prime minister rolled up with a California Highway Patrol motorcycle escort and Secret Service agents guarding the doors. Finally, almost half of the guests at the Estonian Days came from Estonia—performers included—and it was the main reason that the Days were a lot of fun! It does, however, raise serious questions as to the future viability of the Estonian Days. If they are to go on, they will likely have to take on a much smaller footprint.\n\nThere has been interest in establishing a consular office in California to replace the honorary consul position. The consul general has visited and spoken at the Estonian House and because the West Coast Estonian Days were an official part of the celebration of Estonia’s 100th anniversary of independence—another juubel, of course, but this was legitimately a big one—the government presented the Estonian Society with a commemorative plaque which was unveiled at the Estonian House in February 2018.\n\nThe end of the year saw a visit from Economic Minister Kadri Simson who gave a brief talk at the Estonian House and Education and Research Minister Mailis Reps who gave a similar talk at the start of 2019. A larger contingent of officials toured Los Angeles in the summer of 2018. It’s not clear whether the consulate ends up in Northern California with its focus on Silicon Valley or in Southern California with connections to the entertainment industry. Either way, it shows that Estonians on this coast are finally getting the attention of the homeland. President Kersti Kaljulaid did not quite make it to the Estonian House, but she did give a talk just down the street at the University of Southern California in October 2018.\n\nThe end of the year saw a visit from Economic Minister Kadri Simson who gave a brief talk at the Estonian House and Education and Research Minister Mailis Reps who gave a similar talk at the start of 2019.

There are other constants too. The Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church remains part of the scene, though it changed locations from the Hollywood Lutheran Church to the Latvian church (not far from Dodger Stadium) in the early 1990s. Here too, though, the number of attendees at services has dwindled. Up through the early 1980s, then-minister Rein Neggo held services on a rotating basis in Hollywood, Anaheim (for a time earlier, Orange), and Claremont. While the smaller Latvian church might fill up at Christmastime, that is the only time during the year it happens. The church also continues to hold its annual picnic to end summer and remember the harvest season (the only harvests around here are backyard oranges which ripen in December), and this has also changed venues over time. For years, it was held at the Linnas ranch in Chino, then (with some shuffling in between) the Mets backyard in Silver Lake, the Estonian House parking lot, and now, the Kaskla backyard in Garden Grove. There was also an Estonian Russian Orthodox congregation, but Father Hannes Reinhold retired in the 1980s and was not replaced due to the shrinking numbers of that congregation. At one point, though, the Orthodox church also had a choir, directed by Reinhold and featured many singers who also belonged to the regular choir that met on Fridays.\n\nEstonians from Southern and Northern California continue to get together for a ski weekend at China Peak, located east of Fresno in the Sierra Nevada mountains. While most people ski, some snowboarders are now mixed in for good measure and a few others just go to the event and hang out on the Day Lodge deck, usually soaking in a lot of sun given that the event comes in the California spring. There have been years when the event was skipped due to a lack of snow and 2018 was a near-miss, but a massive snowstorm late in the season provided great skiing for those who had time to make the last-minute trip. The two buses filled with skiers, however, is a thing of the past.\n\nThe Eesti Täienduskool (usually translated somewhat misleadingly as Estonian Sunday School) continues on with some children whose parents want them to learn a little Estonian coming from a mixed Estonian-American background or who have emigrated more recently from Estonia and want to hold on to their language and culture. Each year, the school puts on a Christmas program and the kids greet Santa Claus with music or recitation of poems, and in spring they celebrate Mother’s Day with another program dedicated to song and dance for their moms. The principal for many years was Karin Nukk; with her passing in 2010, the school is directed by her daughter, Milvi Laan. School attendance waxes and wanes over the years, obviously dependent on how many Estonian kids there are. For the past handful of years, there has been no shortage of children, so the school is very alive and doing very well.\n\nThings That Aren’t Here Anymore\n\nBy most measures, it is remarkable that the Estonian community is still alive at all. In 1982, Estonian-English dictionary author Paul Saagpakk came to Los Angeles for an extended stay. During that time, he did radio interviews in Estonian which were then played on Radio Free Europe. An interviewee drew immediate fire for commenting that he doubted the Estonian community in Southern California could last more than two decades. Well, that prediction was off the mark, even though the problem of having so few people doing so much of the work remains, a theme also discussed that day. There are new Estonians moving to Southern California all the time, as evidenced by what pops up on social media daily, but very few make it to the Estonian House, even for Independence Day. The need for cultural connection is no longer something to be experienced firsthand, apparently; a quick look at Delfi news on the internet and a visit to Elu24 to find out who broke up with whom is good enough.\n\nThere was a time when there were more community events outside of town. Starting in the 1960s, for example, Estonians would hold a weekend camping trip at Kern River on the second weekend of August (during the Perseid meteor shower, no less). Though an attempt was made to restart the tradition after it died out in the 1980s, that event is not coming back, certainly not how it was with endless volleyball in waist-deep water and Leo Karsen pounding out the accordion next to the campfire. Verses of the song, “Metsa läksid Sa” no doubt echo in the river canyon to this day.\n\nThere was also an annual Labor Day weekend trip to Bass Lake that started in the 1960s and continued through the 1990s, bringing together Estonians from Southern California and the Bay area. Saturday nights meant a trip to the other side of the lake where Asta and Tom Sippel had a cabin and there would be singing and sometimes, dancing. The cabin was also the place where the Geislingen cocktail was born. On Sunday nights, it was campfire time, always doused with great fanfare (actually boos and catcalls) at 10 pm. By the end of the millennium, there were no more Bay area people at Bass Lake, so the trips stopped. But the memories remain.\n\nJaaniöö (technically St. John’s Day eve but really a celebration of the summer solstice, just off by a couple of days) has changed sites many times during the years. In the seventies, it was celebrated with Latvians at White Rock Lake out in the desert, in the 1980s, Lembit Palm-Leis successfully found a place on Mission Bay (some may recall that the place to go was Quivira Point) that was attended by Estonians from both San Diego and Los Angeles. Today, Jaaniöö is celebrated with a picnic at the Estonian House parking lot for those seeking a more urban experience and at a campground in Big Bear for people who still enjoy trees and fresh mountain air. The celebrations are still there and the bonfires are still blazing, but the memories of Mission Bay also take one back to days when talk about the possibility of Estonia’s freedom was still fresh and new.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe community is still intact. Realistically, the groups and organizations here today will carry on as long as they can. But one cannot help but wonder about the future of a choir with 18 members on a good Friday evening. What critical mass is needed to keep it going? And at what point will rent at the Latvian church be too expensive to justify a Sunday service for 16 people? There are often musicians and theater groups on tour in North America, but it is hard to invite them to Los Angeles when the event might draw only 60 people, tops. And can we ever get more new people to run the organizations that remain? Time will tell. The community has passed its suggested expiration date, but it’s still fresh enough, so it’s not about to be tossed out.\n\nTill then, we remember the days of an Estonian House full of people, hazy with cigarette smoke, colored chandelier lights, and Salme Tiideberg waving her bouquet of flowers after another successful dinner.\n\nEstonians in Southern California by WALTER E. NIILUS 1976\n\nThe following is the first attempt to write a chronological, descriptive survey on Estonians in Southern California. It begins with the arrival of the first known Estonian in the Los Angeles harbor district San Pedro in 1896, and ends with the present time when nearly 1,000 Estonians reside in Southern California. The initial work consisted mainly of search for sources, events, names and dates. Considerable help was found in two Estonian language periodicals: Välis-Eesti (Estonians Abroad), published in Estonia before the Second World War, and Meie Tee (Our Path), published in New York. From the latter two longer writings by A. Sandluk were found which were quite helpful, namely Eestlased Põhja-Ameerikas (Estonians in North America), and Ülevaade ameerika eestlastest (A Survey on American Estonians).\n\nBoth appeared in the 1932, 1933 issues of Meie Tee. However, the most useful sources were the interviews, notes, correspondence and documents gathered by late Albert Simm, mainly between 1950 -1966. Only a few parts of his materials have been published. Most of it is in the form of unpublished manuscripts or materials to be organized. A. Simm’s manuscripts and materials are being kept in the archives of the Estonian Society of Los Angeles and were available to this author, who made extensive use of them. Needless to say, the author’s deep gratitude belongs to Albert Simm – posthumously.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhile studying the history of Estonian immigrants to Southern California, one must agree with the statement of the EIA, p.7: “The Great Northern War (1700-1710) ended Swedish rule in Estonia. Now under Tsarist Russian rule, Estonians left no new record of a presence in America until the nineteenth century.”\n\n“Some Estonians might have come here when Russia held sway over Northern California and Alaska, but proof is lacking. Although there are stories of Estonians participating in the California Gold Rush of 1848, the first Estonian immigrant, whose presence in nineteenth century America can be definitely proven arrived in 1855.” We can find a further statement in EIA, p.2: “Estonian sailors, serving on Russian vessels, jumped ship on several occasions during the nineteenth century, both on East and West Coasts. Some of them are reputed to have participated in the California Gold Rush of 1848, but definite proof is lacking. It is fact, however, that one Jaan Sepp, arrived in New York in 1855 as a seaman. After a stint as a stevedore and a construction worker, he left for the West Coast, where under the name of John Smith he became a trapper and a barger. Having made enough money, he decided to return to Estonia, but not before losing the $2,000 he had saved gambling aboard the ship taking him back to Europe.” It is not known whether his travels ever took him to Southern California. Nor is there any information about Estonians from the Gold Rush Era (if there ever were any) having reached Southern California.\n\nSAN PEDRO ESTONIANS, 1896 – 1928\n\nThe Southern California Estonian group began to form in San Pedro. Peet Seppel landed in 1896, in San Pedro. He was born in 1878 on the Estonian island Hiiumaa. At 17 he joined the crew of a sailing ship, which took him to Hull, Scotland. A second sailing ship took him from London to San Diego. The voyage lasted for 132 days. The ship had to go around the tip of the South American continent – Cape Horn. In San Diego Peet Seppel jumped ship, and went to San Pedro. He found work on small coastal vessels, and then bought himself a fishing vessel. When interviewed by A. Simm, 1955, he spoke fluent Estonian, in spite of the fact that he had left Estonia some 60 years ago. He became one of the founders of the Estonian House, in Los Angeles, in 1953. Seppel died at the age of 81, in November 1959, in San Pedro. (INCD—ASY) Juhn Layman, born in 1870, in Põltsamaa, died in 1932, at the age of 62, in San Pedro. He was a skilled watch repairman. In 1905 the Tsarist regime had suppressed a revolt. After the abortive revolt Tsarist military punitive units roamed the country, including Estonia. Somehow Layman had shot two military officers of these units. In order to survive he went into hiding. He was successful, managed to leave Estonia and came to America. (MT 1932, #10, p.9) It is logical to assume that the slow flow of Estonian immigrants to Southern California may have continued after Seppel and Layman, but we have no information. There are no names, or dates of arrival for some 15 years.\n\nIn 1920, Frank Terras, a seaman, came to San Pedro and settled here. He was born in 1880 in Tallinn, and had come to the East Coast in 1909. He worked in the ship building industry. (INCD-As) Jakob Pihel, born in 1887 on the island of Hiiumaa, arrived in America in 1923. Together with his brother Gustav he came in 1925 to San Pedro. For 10 years he worked here as a seaman. Then he bought some real estate and made his living from rental units. (INCD-AS) Jakob Pihel and Frank Terras remembered jointly the names of several Estonians, mostly seamen from Saaremaa and Hiiumaa who had been in San Pedro as of 1925. They were: Jensen, Kasin, Koff, Kuusik, Lauri, Mühleberg, Niit, Onu, Popp, Rammel, Reinojaan, Seppel, Terras and Vispel. (INCD-AS)\n\nIn 1927 John D. Reiman settled in San Pedro. He was born in Tallinn, in 1899. As a 16-year-old seaman he had arrived in New York where he remained for a while. In San Pedro he continued to work as a seaman. Later on, he found work in the harbor. His companions were two other Estonians, Juhan Ahlberg and Alexander Lõhmus. He was among the founders of the Estonian Society of Southern California in 1928. He remembers, that at that time there were about 25 Estonians in San Pedro, mostly seamen. ( INCD-AS ) In his longer survey, Eestlased Põhja-Ameerikas ( Estonians in North America ), A. Sandluk writes: “In San Pedro, the port of Los Angeles ... one can always find a handful of Estonian Seamen. A hotel for seamen, owned by an Estonian, at 370 Third. Street, San Pedro, serves as their center, as well as their local mailing address.” (MT 1933, no.8, P.13) From Bernard Nurmsen it was learned that the owner of this hotel was a former Estonian seaman, John Jensen, the name of that hotel was “Hotel Temprance” (Sic!) and its location was 378 Third Street, San Pedro. Thus, without being formally organized, San Pedro Estonians were able to keep track of each other, thanks to this informal center.\n\nESTONIANS IN LOS ANGELES CITY AND COUNTY, 1913 — 1928\n\nIn 1913, Charles Edward Kodil, born in 1893 in the Province Viljandimaa, with his travel companion Peeter Tobi, arrived from New York via New Orleans to Los Angeles. Soon they met two more Estonians, Hans Laidoner and Martin Mõtus, both gardeners. Kodil acquired a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the University of Southern California and became an employee of the Los Angeles Water and Power Department. Before his retirement, after 40 years of work, he had some 600 employees under his supervision.\n\nIn 1928 Charles Kodil became the founder of the Estonian Society of Southern California in Los Angeles. During the 10th Olympic Games, which were held in Los Angeles in 1932, he held the position of the Estonian Sports Attaché, having been appointed to this position by the Consul of the Republic of Estonia in San Francisco. In 1949 when the existing Estonian Society was reorganized and renamed, he continued his interest in the Society’s activities. In 1953 when the Estonian House, Inc. was founded in Los Angeles, Kodil became one of its financial backers. For his services to the Estonian Community in Southern California, Charles Kodil was made an honorary member of the Estonian Society in 1953. He died in l974.\n\nJohn Babel (originally Johannes Pobul), born in 1882, in the Province Virumaa, became a seaman in order to escape the Tsarist Russian military draft. In 1906 he jumped ship in Seattle. He went to Nome, Alaska and became a gold miner. In 1915 he came to Southern California, went to the Mojave Desert, where tungsten was found, and continued as a tungsten miner. During World War I the United States Government needed this metal for the war industry, and paid well for it. However, Babel did not ‘strike it rich’. The war ended and he was back in Los Angeles and became a construction worker. Then came the Depression. Everything came to a standstill, including construction work. Babel was reminded of the gold in Alaska, went back, and remained there for 13 years. First he worked as an independent miner, then, during the World War II, for a mining company. In Alaska he lived comfortably but he never became rich. In 1957 he was back in California, retired on Social Security pension, and lives in West Riverside. Having spent over 30 years in Alaska he was elected a member of the honorary society known as THE PIONEERS OF ALASKA.\n\nIn the summer of 1974, when Bruno Laan visited him, at 92 years of age he was strong and healthy. He was active tending his garden with many fruit trees. He canned his own fruits and berries.\n\nIn 1916 Charles Gustav Janson arrived in the Los Angeles area. He was born in 1893, in the Province Saaremaa. As a young man he became a seaman. As an apprentice seaman he sailed from St. Petersburg (later Leningrad) to England, and from there to New Orleans where he found work on shrimp boats. Later he was in Mississippi forests, cutting railroad ties. Then, following the advice of a fellow Estonian, “Young man, go West”, he did so and came to Los Angeles where he worked for a while as a carpenter. Then he became a “gang boss” on the railroad in the Mohave Desert and in Arizona. After a serious work accident, he spent five months in hospitals. One of his lungs had collapsed. He was out of work and felt disabled. A social worker told him, “You are still a young man. Why don’t you do something else?” “Like what?” ” Like selling oranges.” With this idea from the social worker he got into the orange business. He bought a truck, and started selling oranges straight from the truck, traveling from house to house. Oranges had never been sold in this manner, and Janson became very successful. In five years he had enough money to enlarge his business. He bought a large warehouse with refrigeration facilities, and a good size parking lot. He named this the San Fernando Orange Market. Ten years later he was the owner of three orange stores. He had two large orange groves and four gigantic trucks. Seasonally he sold up to 600,000 oranges a day. He became known as the Orange King of San Fernando. In 1938 he decided that he had enough money, and his health was not too good, therefore, he sold his business and retired. He lives comfortably in Sylmar near Los Angeles. In 1928 he sent money for the fare from Estonia to Los Angeles to Miss Liidia Potsepp whom he married. Liidia was soon followed by her brother August, and sister Martha with her eleven year old daughter. Charles Janson has mentioned to Albert Simm the names of three Estonians in Southern California whom he admired and respected. These were: First. - Charles E. Kodil who had become a professionally prominent person in the service of the City of Los Angeles, and who was well respected among Estonians as a very good leader and the founder of the Estonian Society.\n\nSecond.— De la Gardie, an Estonian inventor-scientist whose original name was Theodor Märska. In 1912 he had been in Riga, Latvia, as an associate of the Russian inventor Sikorsky who had developed a new type aircraft. In America De la Gardie invented a new and improved film camera. He also invented a stamp canceling machine, which might still be in use by the United States Postal Service, as well as an automated “do-it-yourself” photo camera which used to be popular in the so-called “5-Cent Stores”.\n\nThird.— August Morse, an Estonian investment broker who by 1930 had made his first million, which he lost during the Great Depression. In 1932 he started anew, and had in seven to eight years made his second million. (INCD-AS) Andres Saal, born in the Province Pärnumaa, was a well-known author and journalist during the end of the Estonian National Re-awakening Era (1860-1890). He had visited several countries of West and South Europe, and had studied photography and the printing arts. Also, he had acquired the knowledge of several languages.\n\nIn 1902 he went to Batavia (now Djakarta) and was employed by the Dutch East-Indies government as the head of their Topography Service. He became a well to do man. In 1920 he came to America and settled in Hollywood, California. Since 1927 he went completely blind, and died in 1931. He had never associated himself with the Estonian affairs in Southern California. However, his interest towards Estonia may have persisted, as much as his steadily deteriorating eyesight permitted. Before his death he had made arrangements that his cremated remains were to be transferred to Estonia, and that was done. (INCD-AS)\n\nGustave P. Klaas was born in 1882 in St. Petersburg (later Leningrad). His parents, both Estonians by birth, had migrated to Tsarist Russia, and had eventually settled on the Crimean peninsula. Gustave Klaas had acquired his higher education in Germany. He became an electrical engineer and worked in several places in Southern Russia. The living conditions during World War I in Russia were such that he preferred to go to America. While he was on his way to America he had to travel via Estonia where he stayed for two days. These were the only days he spent in his ancestral land. From 1916 to 1923 he worked in New York. In 1924 he arranged for his widower father the passage from Sebastopol, Russia to Alhambra, California. His father died in 1952 at the age of 98. In 1937 Klaas constructed in Alhambra what was in that time the largest stress-relieving oven in the oil industry. He also made several discoveries in oil cracking technology, which were of military importance. He became an ardent supporter of the Estonian House of Los Angeles (INCD-AS)\n\nESTONIAN SOCIETY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, 1928 -1949.\n\nThe year 1928 was a significant one in the life of Estonians in Southern California. On June 5th, Charles E. Kodil and his friend Peeter Tobi had invited as many Estonians as they knew to gather for a meeting to discuss the possibility of founding an Estonian Society. About 40 Estonians came. The reaction was favorable, and the Estonian Society was founded on the very same day. The minutes of that meeting are not available, therefore very little is known about what other business was transacted. It should be mentioned that very few archival materials are available for the first period of the Society, 1928-1949. The reasons for such a situation are simple, as told by the late Charles Kodil.\n\nin 1952 or 1953 to this author. First, Estonians of Southern California were scattered over a wide area. Second, the Society had no permanent home where its documents could be kept. Third, the President and the officers of the Society changed from year to year, and the old officers seldom transferred the documents properly to the newly elected ones. Fourth, frequently the officers of the Society had to permanently leave the Los Angeles area and failed to turn in the documents in their possession. Fifth, it is possible that at that time the Society did not have history minded members. When Charles Kodil was asked the question: What was the reason for getting Estonians organized, his answer was something like this: There were a number of Estonians in Southern California, especially in San Pedro and Los Angeles, and there seemed to be a need for meeting each other on a regular basis. The Society seemed to be the right answer to this need. There was also an interest that Estonians as an organized group should play a definite role in supporting the participation of the Estonian sportsmen in the 10th\n\nOlympic Games in Los Angeles, in 1932.\n\nIn spite of all that, one should be able to reconstruct the first period of the Society by using Estonian language periodicals Meie Tee (Our Path), published in New York, and Välis-Eesti (Estonia Abroad), 1935-1937. Also, the archival materials of the present Estonian Society of Los Angeles should not be overlooked, including late Albert Simm’s interviews, notes, etc. It is worthwhile to note, that many Estonians who arrived in America before or soon after the abortive revolution of 1905 in Russia, were ideologically split. There was the “red” side and the “white” side. The “reds” favored the revolutionaries and some extreme form of socialism; the “whites” were for traditional and conservative Christian values and preferred evolutionary changes. This split lead to bitter quarrels among the Estonians of the East Coast, and among the San Francisco Estonians. However, nothing of the sort ever flared up in Southern California. In 1934 A.L. wrote under Elu Los Angeleses, Kalifornias (Life in Los Angeles, California);”All Estonians here are doing well, and there is no need, no misery. The red ideas, if anyone ever had them, have disappeared, and because it is so, that is the reason for my participation in the local Estonian Society and its gatherings. We all have become better patriots (meaning: Estonian patriots. – Compiler’s note).” (MT 1934, no.11, p.12) Now a few notes about the Society and its activities as reported in Estonian magazines.\n\nOn July 12, 1932, the meeting of the Society was held in Averill Park, San Pedro. New officers were elected as follows: Peeter Tobi, R. Pageman, Mrs. Liidia Janson, John Jensen, and Charles Kodil. The 1933 Christmas party was held at the home of Society’s President, Charles Janson. Liidia Janson had made very elaborate preparations for the party. Over 30 Estonians attended it. (MT 1934, no.4, p.6- 7)\n\nOn August 26, 1934, the summer meeting was held in Averill Park, San Pedro. New officers were elected, they were as follows: Charles E. Kodil, President-Secretary; August Luck, Vice President; August Morse, Treasurer; John Jensen, Librarian. Thirty persons attended the meeting. (MT 1934, no.10, p.1O-il)\n\nThere are indications that the Society may have had some critical times in 1935-1936. According to an article Eestlasi Los Angeleses, Kalifornias (Estonians in Los Angeles, California), by N., the Society had not held any meetings for a “couple of years” and “the liquidation of the Society” had been discussed. (V-E 1937, p.289)\n\nFortunately the situation could not have been very serious because when the new immigrants began to arrive in 1948, they found the Society very much alive, maybe not very active, but it was there. On the occasion of the Välis-Eesti Päev (Estonians Abroad Day), on November 30, 1936, Los Angeles Estonians met in the Rosslyn Hotel, Los Angeles. Miss Elvi Kaalep, an Estonian aviatrix, attended the festive dinner. She gave a speech about aviation in Estonia, which was broadcast, by a Los Angeles radio station. (MT 1936, no.1, p. 13)\n\nESTONIA AND THE 10TH OLYMPIC GAMES IN LOS ANGELES, IN 1932\n\nSome time before the Olympic Games, the American Estonian community learned that the Republic of Estonia had decided to participate in the Games. The Olympic Committee in Estonia had asked two Estonian sportsmen who happened to be at that time in America, marathon runner Alfred Maasik and wrestler Osvald Käpp, to represent Estonia. American Estonians organized for that occasion their own Olympic Committee, for fund raising. A special pin was designed and sold among local Estonians. Estonian organizations circulated collection sheets among their members. The money was used to finance the trip of Estonian sportsmen from the east coast to Los Angeles. (MT 1935, no.3, p.3) Professor Ants Piip, a scholar and a statesman who happened to be in Los Angeles in 1932 offering guest lectures on international law at the University of California, was asked to become the official representative of the Estonian team. Professor Piip appointed a local Estonian, a successful investment broker, August Morse, to the position of his deputy. Another local Estonian, Charles Kodil, was asked to become the Sports Attaché, representing the Estonian Consulate of San Francisco. The Estonian two-man team performed respectably but did not earn any medals. However, the medals were not as important as the fact that Estonia participated, that the Estonian national colors, blue-black- white, had flown at the Olympic Games. A Los Angeles Estonian old timer had commented: “Now at least more people will know that there is a difference between Estonia and Ethiopia.” It is worthwhile to mention that there were two more Estonians connected with these Olympic Games. Namely, A. Klumberg as the trainer of the Polish Olympic team, and Valter Palm as the trainer of the Finnish boxing team. (INCD-As)\n\nA NEW ESTONIAN CONSULATE OPENED IN LOS ANGELES, IN 1932\n\nEstonian Consulate General in New York announced the opening of a new Estonian Consulate in Los Angeles, on February 23, 1932. The location of the new Consulate was 1914 Raymond Avenue, Los Angeles. The new consul, Mr. Reginald B. Olds was the owner of a musical instruments factory. (MT 1934, no.4, p.9) Some excerpts from the Estonian language magazines may illustrate his activities among local Estonians.\n\nIn 1934, the new consul attended the Society’s annual meeting. “The recently appointed Vice-Consul of Estonia, Mr. R.B. Olds, had his first opportunity to meet local Estonians. Because of that, the participation was larger than usual. There were over thirty persons trying to get acquainted with the representative of their native land.” (MT 1934, no.10, p.10-11) Consul Reginald B. Olds, accompanied by his wife, attended the festive dinner on the occasion of the Välis-Eesti Päev (Estonians Abroad Day). (MT 1936, no.1, p.13)\n\nIn 1948-1950, when the post World War II refugees from Estonia began to immigrate to America, and many of them reached Los Angeles, it was Consul Olds’ factory which offered employment to several of them.\n\nPROBLEMS WITH THE NUMBER OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ESTONIANS\n\nIt appears that the number of Estonians in Southern California has caused a steady flow of questions and problems, especially in early and mid thirties. A.S. writes under Ameerika sisemaa eestlaste päevamuresid (Daily Worries of the American Inland Estonians): “In San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Pedro reside quite a number of Estonians, their exact number may reach a surprising total, however, for the entire state of California we have only sketchy information about the number of Estonians – lack of contacts.” (MT 1932, no.4, p.3) A. Sandluk writes in his longer survey, Eestlased Põhja-Ameerikas (Estonians in North America): “In Los Angeles ... we have information on only about 100 Estonians. The participation of Estonian sportsmen in the Olympic Games, in the summer of 1932, was an important event for the local Estonians, and attracted about sixty Estonians for a joint gathering on the occasion of this event. Local Estonians have been in America for some time, and are economically more or less on a sound base.” (MT 1933, no.8, p.13) In Ülevaade ameerika eestlastest (A survey of American Estonians) by A. Sandluk, we can read: “About 400 miles south of San Francisco is Los Angeles and its harbor San Pedro where some 50 Estonians ... “ and “It has been estimated that there are some 4,000 Estonians in California.” (MT 1932, no.8, p.5) In an article by N., Eestlasi Los Angeleses (Estonians in Los Angeles), can be found statements as follows: “Estonians in Los Angeles and in its environs are scattered over an area of 300 square miles ... Everyone is so busy with his own work, that it is impossible to find time suitable to everyone so that we might go and do something together as a Society. But people visit each other frequently and get along well.” (V-E 1973, no.9, p.289)\n\nAn unsigned “Kiri San Franciscost” (A letter from San Francisco) has the following remark about the American born young Estonians: “Estonian youths, born and raised in California, can hardly be called Estonians. Their parents do not seem to mind this. The young generation gets along fine without the Estonian language.” (MT 1933, no.12, p.11) One may assume quite safely that the same was true about the Estonian youth in Los Angeles area. To summarize the above remarks, it is possible to conclude that Southern California Estonians were scattered over a wide area. Economically they were doing at least satisfactorily. Ties between friends and relatives were good and frequent. Rather few Estonians bothered to organize as distinct ethnic groups. There were mixed marriages. Estonian youths had not learned to speak their ancestral language. Thus Estonians became a rather good material for the so-called American melting pot. The problem of how many Estonians were in Southern California was solved in 1966 by Albert Simm.\n\nHe started a count in 1961. This count was double-checked in September 1965, and received its final form on January 1, 1966. It was titled Eestlased Lõuna-Kalifornias (Estonians in Southern California). According to this report, page 2, there were 885 Estonians in Southern California; of these, 437 were men, and 448 were women. The majority of them resided in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, namely 777, while the remaining 108 persons were scattered from San Diego to Santa Barbara. During the last ten years this number has changed. The general impression is that the total is now larger. The euphemistic there are “about 1000” Estonians in Southern California, might be very close to the truth. (INCD-AS)\n\nMORE ESTONIANS SETTLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, 1931 – 1945\n\nDuring the years 1931 -1945 the immigration of Estonians to America was rather modest, only a total of 1,129 persons, excluding 1933 for which the figure is not available. How many of these new immigrants came to the West Coast, we do not know. (See also EIA 1975, p.129.) The reason for this modest number of immigrants can be understood as follows. First of all, the Great American Depression of 1929-1931 had influenced the whole Western World, including Europe and Estonia. Many prospective Estonian immigrants could not afford the price of the fare to America. Second, in the mid-thirties, when the economic recovery started, many of the prospective immigrants dropped the idea of immigration and remained in Estonia. Third, during the end of that era, it was impossible to get out of Estonia because of the World War II and the ensuing two consecutive foreign military occupations of Estonia (by Stalin’s Russia and Hitler’s Germany).\n\nFor the above reasons only two categories of Estonian immigrants to Southern California may be considered. Some Estonians who were already in other parts of America may have moved to Southern California. Some Estonians who happened to be outside of Estonia during World War II may have immigrated to America, and at least some of them reached the West Coast. It might be of interest to mention the names of some Estonians who were in Southern California during this period, and whose existence is known to us mainly thanks to brief notes in Estonian language periodicals.\n\nOscar Hamilton and brothers Menke married Americans. Charles Kodil married Miss Helen Jürisson, an Estonian from San Francisco. Juhan Wenzel, 73 years old, met accidental death. (MT 1932, no.3, p.6-7) A large Estonian family by the name of Palkman was discovered in Los Angeles. It consisted of the parents and their seven children, five daughters and two sons. They had not met any Estonians during the last ten years, but their domestic language was Estonian. A San Pedro Estonian Mülberg is mentioned, as well as M. Kustin who had been found in his home semi-paralyzed. Ella Vahter had to be institutionalized because of her mental state. August Lukk and his daughter planned to visit Estonia. (V-E 1937, p.289) Miliza Korjus was born in 1909 in Warsaw, Poland. Her father was an Estonian, her mother Polish. They came to Estonia in 1920. Miliza studied singing in Estonia and Germany. She was an excellent coloratura soprano. She married a German. She gave concerts in Estonia, and then she sang in the Berlin opera. There she was noticed by a Hollywood representative and was invited to come to America. Soon she starred in “The Great Waltz”, a musical life story of the famous Viennese composer Johann Strauss. With this movie she had tremendous success in America and in Europe. Later Metropolitan Opera in New York engaged her. For many years she continued a rather successful career. Her songs were recorded and issued in manyeditions by several record companies. It is surprising that she was never able to reach the musical height of “The Great Waltz”. (ME 1968, Nov.14) It is not surprising to read in Eestlased filmis (Estonians in Movies), an unsigned article, about M. Korjus: “Having a Polish mother and being married to a German, she had very little Estonian influence, therefore, she did not claim to be an Estonian, but rather a North European.” (V-E 1936, no.1, p.20) Constantin Flink, a sea captain born in 1887 in Haapsalu, Province Läänemaa, came to America accidentally. In 1916 while en route to Canada, devastatingly bad weather nearly wrecked his ship. U.S.Coast Guard towed it to New York for repairs. While the ship was repaired, Flink worked in New York as a construction worker. A fellow worker, an Estonian, Anton Kruus had advised him to stay in America. Flink took his advice. In order to maintain his professional status as a sea captain, he had to take some courses in American maritime terminology and law. To Flink’s surprise, the person, who offered these courses, was an Estonian, whose name Flink had forgotten. (INCD-AS)\n\nIn 1918, while in Liverpool, Flink and his fellow seamen from Estonia, helped the Estonian Ambassador with a substantial sum of money. It was considered as a loan, but Captain Flink never bothered to collect. (Ants Piip: Tormine aasta, Sweden 1966, Vaba Eesti kirjastus, p.281-282, 3O8)\n\nIn 1921, Captain Flink was one of the three Estonians, who went to President Harding and submitted a petition in behalf of Estonia asking for “full recognition as an independent republic”. Soon afterwards Captain Flink, together with a few fellow Estonians, contributed hundreds of dollars for the distribution of a report on Estonia, written by Congressman W. Chandler, for libraries and schools. After having taken a sailing ship from New York through the Panama Canal to Newport, California, he decided to make his home in Southern California, and did so in 1939.
