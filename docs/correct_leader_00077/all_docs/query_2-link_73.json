        "text": "The origins of the Winter War cannot be explained solely by reference to the hectic days which followed the Nazi attack upon Poland in September 1939. Issues then debated in both Helsinki and Moscow had deeper historical roots. Neither country could forget the bitter days of revolution, counter-revolution, and civil war in 1917–1918. Neither party had been fully satisfied with the Treaty of Dorpat (1930) which drafted the territorial lines of demarcation and specified mutual rights and obligations.\n\n1 He asked that the talks be kept in strictest confidence, since not even the Soviet minister was aware of them! Cf. Tanner, Väinö, Finlands Väg, 1919–40, Helsingfors, 1950, p. 9.Google Scholar\n\n3 This situation was fully understood by the German minister in Helsinki. Cf. his report of August 1, 1938, to the German Foreign Office, Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918–1945, Series D, Vol. v, Washington, 1953, pp. 589–93Google Scholar (hereafter cited as DGFP).\n\n7 Cf. Blücher, , op. cit., pp. 115–17.Google Scholar The sharply critical, almost tragically toned article of the left-wing Social Democrat, Atos Wirtanen, in Arbetarbladet, were exceptional in their specific indictment of Hitler's program and their implied criticism of Western diplomacy. Articles for September 28–30, 1938, reprinted in his Ofärd och Gryning, Helsingfors, 1946, pp. 91–93.\n\n10 Cf. Palmstierna, Carl-Fredrik, Alandsfrågan, 1918–1951 (Världspolitikens dagsfrågor, No. 4), Stockholm, 1951, pp. 18f.Google Scholar Although these islands were a part of Finland, Sweden had peculiar interests there because she was a signatory to the “Guarantee” of 1921, the vast majority of the population was Swedish-speaking and looked to Sweden as a kind of “protector” of its minority status, and the islands lay in waters which were of strategic importance to Sweden.\n\n11 It is noteworthy that Germany gave its assent despite the categorical warning from Minister Blücher in Helsinki that the remilitarization was directed primarily not at the USSR but at Germany. See DGFP, Series D, Vol. v, pp. 607–9.\n\n15 Mannerheim, , op. cit., 11, p. 85.Google ScholarBlücher, , op.cit,. p. 142Google Scholar, furnishes the information that Erkko knew the islands were so located that they were defenseless, and “One rightist politician went even further and conceded that the [Karelian] isthmus lay in the Russian sphere of influence.”\n\n16 The Finnish minister in London, Gripenberg, made several informal protests to Halifax, stating that any common guarantee of Finland by the three powers would tend “… to drive the Finnish Government into the arms of Germany.” Halifax to Snow, minister in Helsinki, July 8, 1939, Documents on British Foreign Policy, III: 6, London, 1953, p. 308. Wuorinen, , op. cit., p. 50Google Scholar, says that Sweden supported this Finnish protest.\n\n17 Earlier Mannerheim had told the English envoy, Snow, that it was his opinion that such a pact would be the most dangerous of several alternatives for Finland. Snow to Halifax, June 20, 1939, DBFP, III: 6, p. 121.\n\n19 This seemingly casual handling of such an obviously important matter subsequently came in for sharp criticism by other Finns. See Frietsch, C. O., Finlands Ödesar, Stockholm, 1945, p. 59.Google Scholar\n\n32 In a personal talk with the present writer in June 1952, Tanner expressed the view that a compromise could have been achieved had the delegates been fully empowered to act.\n\n35 Cf. his note, in Tanner, , op. cit., pp. 81–83.Google Scholar Tanner himself confesses, “I have never learned what motivations Erkko had for his self-confidence. Under any circumstances they dominated his handling of the affair.” Blücher, , op. cit., p. 153Google Scholar, also indicated Erkko's low opinion of Paasikivi's powers of resistance.\n\n41 Quoted in ibid., p. 103; Tanner is the only available source for the Helsinki con, versations and communiqués of November 7–8.\n\n46 Source as given in note 8 above. This source also intimates that only the English minister, Snow, had any real fears of imminent hostilities.\n\n51 Mannerheim, , op. cit., II, p. 115Google Scholar, states that he had been assured a month earlier by General Nenonen that no Finnish batteries had been so placed that they could shoot over the frontier.\n\n53 An indication of the confidence with which the Soviet government played this game is that Pravda and Izvestia, on November 29, printed both the Finnish note and Molotov's reply in full on the front page.\n\n55 Some of the information in this paragraph comes from the source indicated in note 8 above.\n\n56 Paasikivi reported, after his final return from Moscow, “It is my belief that Russia's interest in Finland has always been of a strategic nature, and that other considerations … have never been of any significance.” Source as indicated in note 8 above."
