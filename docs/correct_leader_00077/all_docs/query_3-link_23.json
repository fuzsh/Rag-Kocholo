        "text": "Ryti's mandate as President was intended to extend only through the rest of Kallio's term, i.e., to 1943, but as the government could not organize elections during the Continuation War, the electors from 1937 gathered to re-elect him. This exceptional procedure was mandated by a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament of Finland. To prepare Finland for the eventual peace negotiations with the Soviet Union, the government was changed: Conservative Edwin Linkomies became Prime Minister, some other ministers also came to the government and the Patriotic People's Movement was excluded from the government.\n\nThe Soviet Union's major counter-offensive began in June 1944, in a situation when Finland's relations to Germany were strained due to earlier attempts to secure a separate peace. Finland was in dire need of food, but in particular of weapons and ammunition, as the Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop demanded guarantees that Finland would not again seek a separate peace. Ryti gave this guarantee, expressed as his personal guarantee that Finland under his presidency would not. Soon after the situation was stabilized, Ryti resigned and peace negotiations could begin again, this time from a stronger position although most territorial gains had been lost by that time. Probably neither Hitler nor any other German authorities read Ryti's letter carefully enough, because Finland's decision at the start of September 1944 to end its informal military alliance or \"brotherhood-in-arms\" with Germany surprised and angered them. None of them probably thought that Ryti would resign any time soon, and thus give his successor a free hand to break ties with Germany and to start peace negotiations with the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the war Ryti attempted to return to the Bank of Finland. However, in 1945 Finnish communists and the Soviet Union demanded he should be tried as \"responsible for the war\". This came as a shock to the Finnish people who held Ryti in high esteem. After considerable pressure from the Soviet Union, Ryti was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, in a trial widely held to be illegitimate and a miscarriage of justice from the Finnish perspective. Along with Ryti, seven other high officials were sentenced to prison, although for shorter terms. Despite Ryti and his fellow convicts not being treated particularly badly in prison, Ryti's health failed during his sentence. Most of his stomach had to be removed due to some tumour or other disease; in addition, he developed arthritis during the first winter of imprisonment. He was pardoned by President Juho Kusti Paasikivi in 1949. In 1952, he attended a university students' celebration where he accepted a badge of honour. In May 1956, just five months before his death, he received an honorary doctorate in political science from the Helsinki University. Risto Ryti died in October 1956 and was buried with full presidential honors.\n\nIn 1994, a statue of Ryti was unveiled near the Finnish Parliament House. In 2004, in the YLE TV-series Suuret Suomalaiset (Greatest Finns) Risto Ryti got the second highest number of votes."
