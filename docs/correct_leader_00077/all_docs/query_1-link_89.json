        "text": "Все статьи: 752\n\n\"This family has been found and is now located in Obdorsk region…\" (reflections on the list of Samoyeds of Berezovsky district in 1832)\n\nYuri N. Kvashnin\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe article details the list of “Samoyeds”, compiled in 1832 by Tobolsk missionary Hieromonk Makarii. The generic names and surnames indicated there show that they belonged to the European, Ural and Siberian tundra Nenets, and it was not by chance that they were on the same list. It was a small group from the “Vojkar Samoyeds”, a separate territorial group of the Nenets ethnos, wandering in the 17th–19th centuries on both sides of the Subpolar Urals. On the basis of information from the “List”, generalization of materials from archival documents and works of researchers and travelers of the 18th – 19th centuries, it was possible to put forward several reasonable assumptions and clarifications about the origin of some Nenets families and patronyms, places of their settlement and marital relations. In addition, for the first time, it was possible to find information about the compiler of the “List”, its life and activities long before the missionary trip to the north of the Berezovsky department.\n\nБесплатно\n\n4th meeting of the Arctic Expert Club (February 17, 2016)\n\nДругой\n\nБесплатно\n\nA Linguosemiotic Study of Nominations of Northern Lights in Russian and German\n\nPolikarpov A.M., Bondareva L.M., Kibardina S.M., Polikarpova E.V., Zemtsovskaya E.N.\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe article studies lexical designations of the natural phenomenon of the Northern lights in scientific, literary, journalistic and advertising texts of German- and Russian-speaking authors. The purpose is to compare and contrast their implementation in German and Russian Arctic discourses. The study of semantics, syntactics and pragmatics of lexical designations of the phenomenon allows authors to comprehensively assess the views of German and Russian scientists, writers, poets, journalists, representatives of tourism and advertising business on the northern lights. A comparative study of lexical designations of the northern Lights in the focus of German and Russian Arctic discourses shows the similarity in the presentation of the lexical categories under consideration according to the existing universal (scientific) world picture and the differences in the implementation of lexical designations of northern lights, explained by the national world picture of the representatives of two compared linguistic cultures.\n\nБесплатно\n\nA cosmopolitan, Sami-friendly scholar? Väinö Tanner on the best way to treat the Sami\n\nJukka Nyyssönen\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe topic of this article is Väinö Tanner’s views on Sami policies, which are examined from numerous perspectives, including his personal career and Nordic Sami policies. The discursive resources that he re-produced are also charted. Of the Sami policies in existence at that time, Tanner advocated the Swedish variant, which suited better the agenda of his scholarly production on the Skolt Sami. The origins of his choice are located in his long-term professional contact with Swedish experts on the Sami and the expert role provided by Swedish discourses on the Sami. The anti-Finnish agenda in his scholarly production, and his consequent wish to elevate the Sami in the hierarchies of that time, rendered the more aggressive Norwegian rhetoric on the Sami unusable. In addition, Tanner showed signs of a cultural sensitivity that made him suspicious of assimilative policies.\n\nБесплатно\n\nA great scientific tour in the North of Russia\n\nJens P. Nielsen, Victoria V. Tevlina\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe coverage of various issues related to the Russian-Norwegian relations has always been important for the residents of both countries. Opportunities to present new documents and materials, to discuss the importance of centuries-old good neighborly relations between Russia and Norway, especially in the North, are not provided often. At the end of April 2018, large-scale scholarly events, devoted specifically to this topic, took place in Nikel and Murmansk. So, a scientific-practical seminar “Russia, Norway and the North. Historical relations” was held in Nikel on April 25 and on the next day in Murmansk the international conference “Neighbors in the Far North: historical ties between Russia and Norway” took place. One of the reasons for these measures was the presentation of the collective monograph “Getting closer: Russia and Norway 1814–1917”. The book was written jointly by Norwegian and Russian historians within the framework of a long-lasting historical megaproject (2008–2015) (led by J.P. Nielsen, AHR, UIT-The Arctic University of Norway). In November 2017 the book was published in Russian in Moscow by the “Ves’ Mir” publishing house after three years of preparation. It is the translation of a monograph, richly illustrated, about the history of Russian-Norwegian relations in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, originally published in Norwegian by the Pax Forlag AS, Oslo under the title “Russland kommer nærmere” in 2014.\n\nБесплатно\n\nA large-scale meeting of Nordic and Russian historians, philologists and archaeologists in Arctic Norway\n\nVictoria V. Tevlina, Marianne N. Soleim\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe history of Russia and Norway and their areas in the Arctic and Russian-Norwegian relations are traditionally important for the residents of both states. Opportunities to present new documents and materials, to discuss the significance of centuries-old ties between Russia and Norway, especially in the North, are not provided so often. In early April 2019, a large-scale scientific seminar of Russian and Scandi-navian historians, philologists, and archaeologists was held at the University of Tromsø — the Arctic University of Norway. It was precisely dedicated to the issues listed above. One of the reasons for the meeting was the jubilee of the Honorary Doctor of the Northern (Arctic) Federal University named after M.V. Lomonosov, Professor J.P. Nielsen. Also, the seminar hosted the presentation of a collective scientific collection written by associates of J.P. Nielsen from various countries — “In the North, the East and the West meet.”\n\nБесплатно\n\nA multidimensional Arctic: horizons of development\n\nNatalia V. Govorova, Valery P. Zhuravel\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe article presents an overview of events and presentations at the round table “Modern Arctic: Issues of International Cooperation, Politics, Economy and Security” held in Moscow in November 2017 by the Institute of Europe of RAS and devoted to various aspects and prospects of the development of the Arc-tic. The main goal of the event was to analyze risks and opportunities in key areas of cooperation and management in the Arctic: international cooperation, security, economy, ecology and social sphere. And, the formation of the Arctic consciousness and involvement in the Arctic issues with the help of mass media that covered the event widely, electronic and printed scientific publications based on its results.\n\nБесплатно\n\nA new book on the history of the Murman coast colonization\n\nDmitry A. Gerasimov\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe review of the book by P.V. Fedorov and A.A. Malashenkov “Soil on the Northern rocks: Orthodox necropolis of the Murmansk coast of the Barents Sea (1863–1920)”. The study based on the processing of metrical books made it possible to publish the information about 2,524 persons of the Orthodox religion buried on the Murmansk coast, or drowned in the sea in 1863–1920. The Authors found the demographic statistics related to the appearance of the settlements with permanent population. The book clarifies the idea of “cultural soil”, local and family-genealogical structures in the Russian Arctic, and it also contributes to the historical personification of the Murmansk coast.\n\nБесплатно\n\nA new scientific publication on the economic and socio-cultural development of the Russian Arctic\n\nAnton M. Maximov\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe article represents a review of the book by N.U. Zamyatina and A.N. Pilyasov “The Russian Arctic: towards new understanding of the development processes” and provides the reader with a new scientific publication on the Arctic topic.

The book contains a large amount of statistical data and it is wellillustrated with diagrams and maps. The book by N.U. Zamyatina and A.N. Pilyasov will be of interest not only to specialists in the economic geography, but also to researchers of social sciences and humanities.\n\nБесплатно\n\nAbout A. V. Smetanin's book ''Think of the Homeland early…''\n\nShubin S.I.\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe new book of the Doctor of Economics, professor A.V.Smetanina is reviewed.\n\nБесплатно\n\nAbout Russian Alaska and Its Ruler A.A. Baranov\n\nLukin Yu.F.\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe purpose of this study is to analyze the present and past of the history of Alaska. Such a combination of times highlighted the most difficult problem of ambiguous attitude to the historical past in the USA from the standpoint of modernity. In the process of destroying monuments under the onslaught of the Black Lives Matter movement, the local Indian population accused the long-gone A.A. Baranov of racism, persecution of the indigenous population, enslavement of Tlingits and Aleuts for hunting fur-bearing animals. On July 14, 2020, the Sitka town and district assembly supported these accusations and decided to move his monument from the town square to the local museum. The review article reveals the objective conditions of the historical process during the period of A.A. Baranov's activity in Alaska in 1790–1818, using the methods of historicism, search and systematization of information, analysis and synthesis. The assessment of his personality is updated. The article shows the beginning of G.I. Shelikhov's and A.A. Baranov's activity in the North-Eastern Company, and then its transformation in 1799 into the Russian-American Company (RAC). The article examines the war with the Tlingit people of 1802–1804, the missionary work of Herman Alaskinskiy, three assessments of the nature of Russian colonization, N.P. Rezanov's plan for the modernization of RAC. The episode with Russia's sale of Alaska to the United States is also being clarified.\n\nБесплатно\n\nAbout Russian Pomor say a word\n\nLukin Y.F.\n\nСтатья научная\n\nConceptual approaches 2 definitions of concepts ‘pomors’, ‘Russian Pomors’ in historical and modern understanding are considered.\n\nБесплатно\n\nAbout the appearance of the Russian border in Lapland (some results of the discussion)\n\nPavel V. Fedorov\n\nСтатья научная\n\nThe article deals with the emergence of the Russian state border in Lapland. The author shows that the existing ideas in the historiography negate each other, and offers a solution to this issue on the basis of another method connected with the rise and fall of the system of double tribute of indigenous peoples — the Lapps (Saami). The approach is illustrated on the basis of traditional methods of analysis of sources, including ancient acts of Moscow and Danish rulers from the archaeographic collection of Y.N. Sherbachev.\n\nБесплатно\n\nAbout the book Richard Sale и Eugene Potapov «Scramble for the Arctic: Ownership, Exploitation and Conflict in the Far North»\n\nBobina Julia\n\nСтатья\n\nБесплатно\n\nAbout the continuity of the northern concept of M.V. Lomonosov in selecting of geopolitical model to protect the economic interests of Russia in the Arctic\n\nZalyvskiy Nikolai\n\nСтатья научная\n\nIn this article Lomonosov is considered to be the founder of Northern Regional Studies, the person who determined the place and the role of the Arctic as the strategic factor of Russia’s development.
