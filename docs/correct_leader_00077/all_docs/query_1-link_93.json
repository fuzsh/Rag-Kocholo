        "text": "Stefan Lindfors’ first design which was put into production was the Scaragoo lamp, introduced at the Milan Furniture Fair in 1988 by Ingo Maurer. Since then Stefan Lindfors has completed some two-hundred projects as interior architect, designer, sculptor and director for companies such as Alessi, Amnesty, Arabia, Artek, Dna, Hackman, Iittala, Ikea, Ingo Maurer, Lundia, Marimekko, Martela, Neste, Nokia, Sony Playstation, Swatch, Vitra and Warner Music. Some of the most interesting among his creations as a designer, sculptor and film director are the Ego cups and saucers created for Iittala in 1998 – characterized by an original design which takes both functionality and esthetics into account, and a distinctive handle that helps keep the cups steady both in the hand and on their saucers, not on the table – the sculpture installation on the façade of the Gershwin Hotel (2001) – declared by the New York Times “a new landmark on Manhattan” – the music video for the song “Funeral of Hearts” by HIM – for which he received the London Kerrang! “Best Music Video 2004 Award”. Stefan Lindfors has received several awards for his work including the Väinö Tanner Trailblazer Award in 1992, considered the largest cultural award in the Nordic countries of the 20th century, the Georg Jensen Prize, the Good Design Award, the Design PLUS (for Ego tableware) and the Tokyo Design Award. Stefan Lindfors is represented at several museums around the world such as the Vitra Design Museum, the Chicago Athenaeum, the Röhsska Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum."
