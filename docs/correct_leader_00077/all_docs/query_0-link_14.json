While there are numerous differences between the two parties, their overriding point of friction is the Agrarian allegation that the Social Democrats do not support the official policy of neutrality and friendship with Moscow. On these grounds the Agrar- ians have refused to accept the Social Democrats, Finland's other principal non-Communist party, in a government coalition. As a result the country's recent governments have been little more than presi- dentially appointed cabinets without any representa- tion for democratic labor elements which, with the farmers, comprise the dominant economic interest groups in Finland. This has weakened parliamentary democracy and undermined Finland's ability to resist Soviet pressures. A change in the Social Democratic leadership expected to be approved at the party con- gress opening on 15 June may ease, but is not likely to resolve, this deadlock. Social Democratic Leadership A major development at the Social Democratic congress is expected to be the retirement of the veteran party chairman, Vaino Tanner. The 82-year-old Tanner has long been persona non grata with Moscow and is also the symbol of the polit- ical tug of war between the Social Democrats and the Agrar- ians. provocative of the Soviet Union, they reject any idea of accept- ing Agrarian judgments on the qualifications of their leaders. It appears, however, that the Social Democrats will approach Agrarian insistence that the Social Democrats purge their leadership of allegedly anti- Soviet individuals has merely served to exacerbate the already strained relations between the two parties. While many Social Democrats concede that Tanner's appointment at the 1957 congress was unwise and unnecessarily SECRET Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927A004000120005-2 Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927A0004000120005-2 Name SECRET this congress in a more concil- iatory mood on the leadership question if for no other reason than to try for a political. come- back. Tanner's successor is likely to be Rafael Paasio, a prominent Social Democrat who is regarded as a moderate on the all-important question of Soviet-Finnish relations. Another point in Paasio's favor is his lack of firm identifi- cation with either of the party's mutually antagonistic left- and right-wing factions. His selec- tion, nonetheless, would indi- cate a consensus in favor of reconciliation with the dissi- dent left-wing Social. Democrats --the so-called Skogists--and support for an effort to attempt to improve relations with the Agrarians as a preliminary step toward eventually regaining representation in the cabinet. Agrarian Strategy The Agrarians, however, apparently are convinced they have the Social Democrats on the defensive, and recent pro- nouncements by party leaders indicate that they have raised the price for readmittance into the government. In what has come to be known as the \"March Manifesto,\" the official Agrarian Party paper declared that there was no prospect of renewing a coali- tion between the two parties even if Paasio succeeds Tanner, since actual power would remain in the hands of such leaders as Vice Chairman Olavi Lindblom, Secretary Kaarlo Pitsinki, and Vaino Leskinen, an influential member of the party's executive committee. Like Tanner, all three have been bitterly attacked by Moscow, and the Agrarians are indicating that reconciliation between the two parties hinges on their withdrawal from posi- tions of leadership. The Social Democrats for their part are certain to reject such onerous terms. To accept them would reduce the party to a pliant tool of the Agrarians and merely serve to drive most of labor into the arms of the Communists. The Agrarian - Social Demo- cratic dispute has its origins in the December 1958 cabinet crisis in which Soviet politi- cal and economic pressure was instrumental in toppling Social Democratic Prime Minister Fager- holm's coalition government. The crisis was resolved only when President Kekkonen appointed an Agrarian minority government for which he obtained Khrushchev's SECRET Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927A004000120005-2 Approved For R le se 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927A 4000120005-2 ,low il~j SECRET personal approval during his visit to Leningrad in January 1959. Although Finnish leaders in the postwar years have al- ways taken Moscow's likely re- action into account when draw- ing up cabinets, Kekkonen's di- rect solicitation of Khru- shchev's approval on this oc- casion appears to have estab- lished a precedent which gives the Soviet Union a kind of veto power over the composition of Finnish governments. With the resolution of the ?'???' 1958 crisis, the campaign to isolate and discredit the Social Democrats' party and leadership began in earnest. The Agrarians, Skogists, and Communists in vary- ing degrees have echoed Moscow's line that the Social Democrats are hostile to the Soviet Union, do not support Finland's basic foreign policies, and hence are unfit for cabinet responsibility. The Soviet Union's desire to discredit, if not to destroy, the Social Democratic Party is clear, and is reflected in the basic strategy of the Finnish Communist Party (FCP). This strategy is aimed at weakening Social Democratic influence in labor as a prerequisite to gain- ing for the FCP the role of principal spokesman for labor, and thus representation in the government. There is also a historical basis to Moscow's animosity toward the Social Democrats. In 1918 large numbers of radical Socialists and Communists fled to the USSR after failing in SOCIAL IIBERAlS' DEMOCRATIC 3 LIBERAL' OPPOSITION UNION (SROGISTS) 1 2 200 SEATS their attempt to seize power in Finland. (Among them was Otto Kuusinen, the lone survivor of these emigrds and currently a member of the presidium of the Soviet party) The FCP and Mos- cow have never.forgiven the Social Democrats for frustrating this and more recent efforts of the Communists to gain power, and also for turning their backs on doctrinaire Marxism and identi- fying themselves with the moder- ate, reformist programs of the Scandinavian Social Democratic parties. Kekkonen's Image The motives behind Kekkonen's unrelenting attitude toward the Social Democrats are more ob- scure. His critics charge that he is using foreign policy is- sues such as the Social Demo- crats' alleged hostility to the Soviet Union merely to strengthen his own position as well as that of the Agrarian Party. They assert that by raising doubts about the Social Democrats' SECRET Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927AO04000120005-2 Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927A000120005-2 %W %0 SECRET stand on basic foreign policy questions and encouraging the divisive activities of the Skogists, the Agrarians have sought to keep the Social Demo- crats in a permanent political limbo. In addition, the critics claim the Agrarians have at- tempted to establish an image of Kekkonen as the indispensable leader who alone is able to maintain relations with the Soviet Union on a firm and practical footing. To under- line this, they point to the crisis in Soviet-Finnish rela- tions in late 1961 when Moscow invoked the 1948 Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assist- ance and called for military consultations with Finland on grounds that West German mili- tary activity in the Baltic area presented a threat to the se- curity of both countries. While Kekkonen subsequently was able to \"persuade\" Khrushchev to defer the consultations, it now is generally accepted that the episode was primarily a maneuver on Moscow's part to assure the re-election of Kek- konen in the presidential elec- tions which followed shortly after. Kekkonen's supporters, on the other hand, vigorously deny that he is using foreign policy issues for domestic political purposes. Noting that the Finnish constitution specifi- cally delegates to the presi- dent responsibility for direct- ing foreign relations, they argue that,Kekkonen is acutely conscious of this responsibility and the overriding importance of maintaining a balance in Finland's relations with both East and West. Kekkonen does, in fact, regard his principal task to be one of assuring that Finland's official policy of neutrality enjoys the \"confidence\" and \"trust\" of the major powers-- above all the Soviet Union. His supporters maintain that since the Social Democratic Party's present leaders do not wholeheartedly support Finland's official policy of friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union, any government in which that party is represented would not enjoy Moscow's confidence. Therefore, they say, it would be dangerous to attempt to form such a government since it would only invite another Soviet foray into Finland's internal affairs. On the offensive, the Agrarians have exploited a SECRET Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927AO04000120005-2 Approved For Reje 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927AO04000120005-2 NOW V SECRET recent interview Tanner gave to a Dutch newspaper in which he expressed the conviction the Soviet Union would not rest until it had absorbed Finland. In the Agrarian view, this was conclusive evidence of the So- cialist leadership's unyield- ing hostility to the Soviet Union. To be sure, many of Kekkonen's supporters privately entertain doubts concerning Moscow's protestations of friendship and good will toward Finland, but it is one they keep to themselves. It is Kekkonen's belief that the problem of regulating Finland's relations with the Soviet Union is of overriding importance and all other facets of foreign policy and domestic considerations must be subor- dinated to the maintenance of good relations with Moscow. He maintains that Finland's experiences in wars with the USSR in 1939-40 and again in 1941-44 proved the folly of looking to the outside world for effective assistance in moments of national crisis. Finland, therefore, has been forced to come to terms with the harsh reality of its postwar position as a virtually unarmed neutral controlling territory of great strategic importance to a powerful and suspicious Soviet Union. Finland's only hope for survival in these cir- cumstances is to pursue what is essentially a policy of pas- sive neutrality, accommodating itself to the steady pressures exerted by Moscow which affect many areas of its national life, but maintaining inviolate its free institutions and way of life. All of the non-Communist parties, including the Social Democrats, support this policy of accommodation--the so-called \"Paasikivi line,\" named after Kekkonen's predecessor. How- ever, many non-Communists take issue with Kekkonen's interpre- tation and implementation of it, which they feel have served to further circumscribe Finland's freedom of action in the con- duct of its foreign relations and invited a growing measure of interference by Moscow in its internal affairs. They contend that he has given a lopsided interpretation to Fin- land's neutrality by placing greater emphasis on avoiding any actions which he anticipates might be viewed with disfavor by the Soviet Union than on pursuing a genuine middle-of- the-road course between the two power blocs. They cite, for example, his intervention which enabled the Communist-sponsored World Youth Festival to be held in Helsinki last summer, despite its boycott by most Finnish youth organiza- tions. More recently, his pro- posal for declaring the four northern countries a nuclear-free SECRET Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927AO04000120005-2 Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927A00 000120005-2 SECRET zone is hardly likely to be regarded as a welcome initia- tive at this time by the Scan- dinavian countries. Of particular concern to many Finns is Kekkonen's refusal to recognize that in recent years Moscow has on several oc- casions actively interfered in Finnish affairs.. They are con- vinced that Kekkonen's refusal to recognize this meddling for what it is only encourages Mos- cow to press its advantage and paves the way for more flagrant intervention in the future. Soviet Opportunities The continuing bitter struggle between the Agrarians and the Social Democrats has offered the USSR opportunities to extend its influence in Fin- land. Several months prior to the fall of the Fagerholm govern- ment, the long-developing split within the Social Democratic Party was finalized when the Skogists withdrew. Politically, the Skogists have only a small following and control only two of the seats in the 200-member parliament. It is a matter of speculation as the degree to which the Agrarian leadership has encouraged, if not actively abetted this division of the Social Democratic Party. At any rate, it is one of the more telling criticisms of President Kekkonen that during his tenure he has been a divisive rather than a unifying influence in Finnish political life. Despite their small size, the very existence of the Skogists has weakened the So- cial Democrats politically. The Soviet Union and the FCP apparently are prepared to underwrite much of the Skogists' activities because of the key position they hold in the deeply divided trade union movement. Along with the split in the Social Democratic Party, a parallel division in the trade union movement occurred in early 1960 when the Skogists and the Communists cooperated to oust the regular Social Democrats from positions of leadership in the Central Con- federation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK). The Skogists, who since April 1962 have held two cabinet positions as \"labor\" representatives, continue to fill the top posts in the SAK. This arrangement provides the Communists with a good cover SECRET Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927A004000120005-2 Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP79-00927AO04000120005-2 Novi *000 SECRET for their operations; they have been hesitant about wielding their power too openly for fear of driving the remaining \"neutral\" unions in the SAK to the rival trade union organiza- tion founded in late 1960 by the regular Social Democrats. The new organization, the Fed- eration of Trade Unions (SAJ), got off to a slow start, but now appears to be attracting an increasing number of the \"neu- tral\" unions which heretofore have elected. to remain in the older trade union federation. Future Prospects The direction in which Finnish political life will move in the days ahead--either toward reconciliation or fur- ther embitterment of relations between the Agrarians and the Social Democrats--will be de- termined largely by President Kekkonen. Recent pronouncements by Kekkonen and the Agrarian leadership, however, appear to leave little prospect of an early initiative from that side toward reconciliation. The only hope for an early break in the impasse would seem to lie with an increas- ingly impatient public opin- ion which, if sufficiently aroused, may compel both sides to yield out of con- sideration for Finland's na- tional interests.
