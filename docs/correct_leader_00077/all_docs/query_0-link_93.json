        "text": "2018, Carrara marble, 90 x 95 x 26 cm\n\n(in relation to the film Somnivm)\n\nRetractor Hydrobag, installation view, Beaconsfield Gallery, London 7.3-22.4.2018\n\nSomnivm & Retractor Hydrobag, installation view, Sara Hildén Art Museum, Out of Office exhibition, 2019\n\nRetractor Hydrobag is a tool of its own destruction. It offers insight to both classical statuary and the industrial methods of the marble quarries. The sculpture is a replicate of an iron retractor hydrobag – a tool employed in the quarrying industry to separate up to 200 tons of marble away from the Earth. The sculpture is an exact copy of the original tool. Retractor hydrobag makes a connection to readymade objects of the industry and the conditions of resting and dreaming: a popular motif of the antique and beyond.\n\nProduction supported by ARTS PROMOTION CENTRE FINLAND, FRAME, VÄINÖ TANNER FOUNDATION Commissioned by BEACONSFIELD GALLERY special thanks ALEKSI KRAAMA, ARTO KIVIMÄKI, ORLANDO CERASUOLO, VILLE PIIPPO\n\nCopyright © Jonna Kina.
