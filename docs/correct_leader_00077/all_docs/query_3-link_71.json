        "text": "This article approaches on the basis of fresh archival research some of the key reasons which led to the failure of the region-building process at the western periphery of Soviet Russia (Union). This research of the relations between Romania and Finland, two distant nations located at the two extremities of Soviet western border, points out to the role played by domestic agendas, cultural and political identities, lack of knowledge of each other, regional skirmishes, and outside powers intrusions as viable explanations for the fact that the cooperation between Border States remained to some extent restricted to diplomatic and intelligence sharing cooperation. It is a paradox that although the importance of the cooperation between Border States was rapidly acknowledged by policy-makers and public opinion the achievements remained well behind the projects, ambitions and interests. This article explores one of the reasons responsible for the failure of the Border States (meaning the new or enlarged nation-states neighbouring Soviet Russia (Union) in creating a larger space of security able to deter on the long run the Soviet ideological or political ambitions in the region and to shape a new durable stability inside the area. It starts from the premises that one of the clues for understanding this failure is the research of the bilateral or multilateral relations between the Border States. Because Romania and Finland were geographically situated at the two extremities of the area, a research on their bonds after the beginning of their diplomatic relations until the abrupt end of their direct diplomatic ties in 1922-1923 is relevant in answering to this question. The beginnings of the Finnish-Romanian relations following the Finnish independence and Romanian aggrandizement (on the start of the diplomatic ties between the two states, see Hovi 2005: 293-300) relationship look when seen against the background of the little and rather casual contacts the two nations had entertained very promising. The two countries grasped rather quickly their common interest in regard to Soviet Russia and the menace posed to their elites by Bolshevism. Accordingly, they were seriously trying to overcome their rather local international outlook and build a larger regional structure able to fulfil the task of deterring the ambitious political designs of Soviet Russia. Naturally, the creation of this structure was dependent on the goodwill and capacity of compromise of the many new small states in the area situated between the Baltic and the Black seas, a region traditionally marred by conflicts between its mixed nationalities. One of the main difficulties impeding the creation of a large security structure in the area was the instability prevailing throughout the region. The state-building and empire\n\n‘…of all the nations on the continent of Europe involved in the Second World War, only Finland escaped an enemy occupation. Her social fabric remained intact and the continuity of her political institutions unbroken. In this fact, which is the key to understanding her present position as an independent nations, lies an achievement that transcends the conventional meaning of such terms as defeat or victory. For in the end Finland did not fight for Karelia or Petsamo. She did not fight for any abstract principles or ideals. She fought for national survival. When the fight was over, Finland was a nation crippled and exhausted. But Finland survived. This may seem a pitifully unheroic end to a story of much effort and sacrifice, suffering and blood. But for a small nation, in the iron times of the Second World War, survival was a rare triumph.’ 1. Introduction These are the words - bearing a deep meaning though simple as the verses of an ancient drama - that the Finnish historian and diplomat Max Jakobson wrote about half a century ago in order to assess the consequences of the Finnish resistance during the Winter War and the subsequent Continuation War. Since the end of the Continuation War, historians and political scientists addressed themselves to the issue of the reasons why Finland was only half-included in the Soviet sphere of influence. Drawing comparisons with the cases of Czechoslovakia, Poland or Hungary was one of the tools used by specialists in social studies in order to come up with answers. There have not been so far any attempts to comparatively analyze the positions of Finland and Romania, the only states of in-between Europe that, between 1941 and 1944, effectively fought a war with the Soviet Union being able at the same time to preserve a certain degree of independence vis-à-vis the great competitors of the Second World War. Therefore, this approach envisages drawing a comparison between the Romanian and Finnish ‘cases’. This comparative study also aims at defining my view on the usage and meaning of the terms communization and finlandization. It must be pointed out, from the very beginning, that the fundamental and obvious difference between the situations of Romania and Finland by the end of Second World War seemed to have been the presence of the Red Army in Romania. By her staunch military resistance, Finland was able to lock its door against the penetration of the Soviet Army. The unity displayed by the Finnish nation, made possible by the preservation of the democratic institutions of the country, was remarkable. No major political splitting within the Finnish nation registered during the war.\n\nBy the mid of the 1920s the concept of Border States had already been established in the political and diplomatic vocabulary of European chancelleries. It referred to the belt of countries from Finland to the north and down to Romania to the south, neighbouring the most ideologically charged border of Europe. It stood witness of a divided Europe, functioning at differing speeds and acting based on most urgent security needs and concerns. While the dialogue between Western and Central Europe was unlocked at least temporarily following the Locarno Pact (1925), the Border States persisted to be widely seen as a locus of clash between the old bourgeoisie world and the rising communist one. The countries situated on this belt were still in search of diplomatic and political tools to back up stability and regional balance. The Polish-Romanian and the Latvian-Estonian political and military alliances, set up in 1921, were the foundations of international order in the area, and plans to merge them into a grand Border States league continued to be nurtured although with less enthusiasm than it had been done a few years earlier. The Declaration of Common Aims of the Independent Mid-European nations adopted in the convention assembled at Independence Hall of Philadelphia in 1918 remained a generous statement of goodwill but a chimera in practical terms. Particularly the Polish-Lithuanian confrontation with regard to the belonging of the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania proved to be Achilles' heel of Border States solidarity. It paved the way to German and Soviet policy of Divide et Impera and backfired the creation of a Baltic union or a Border States league spanned between Helsinki and Bucharest. The lack of mutual knowledge, particularly when it comes to Romanian-Baltic or Romanian-Finnish relation, the divergent national aspirations, the ideological clashes, Polish bossy attitude in the region stood in the way of reaching an agreement between the small and mid-sized nations situated in the area. The answer to the question what to do with Soviet Russia also evoked conflicting answers. The Right typically believed that Russia should be closely monitored but surrounded by a cordon sanitaire. It should not be allowed to participate in decisions either at regional or European level. The Left customarily had a different opinion. It sought for rapprochement between East and West in order to safeguard not solely their independence but their economy and trade, too. The Baltic Left placed emphasis on the economic gains to be achieved from the restoration of trade between Europe and Russia. Torn between conflicting aspirations, it was never easy to find a lasting reconciliation between the Border States and the USSR. The Soviet policy would not encourage that, too, transmitting conflicting signals to its neighbours also given the twofold policy of the Soviet state and the Third International. Even when the Soviet Union proclaimed its support for the international order based on Paris peace treaties, the Komintern continued to be perceived as an instrument devised to weaken resistance of the Border States from inside. By 1928, the Briand-Kellogg Pact was signed and the same year Romania opened a Legation in Riga, the biggest town in Baltic States, centrally located on the flow of information concerning the Soviet Union. But what was the intention behind Romania’s interest to establish a permanent legation on the eastern shores of the Baltic?\n\nAs already stated, the Vilna dispute affected also Romania’s eastern foreign policy on a bilateral and regional scale. In terms of bilateral relations, due to the Romanian-Polish alliance of March 1921 it created a barrier in the relations with Lithuania. For instance, in August 1923, when the Lithuanian envoy in Prague visited his Romanian counterpart Dinu Hiott, handing him a letter requesting the setting up of diplomatic relations between the two countries, Foreign Minister I.G. Duca had to refer the request to Prime Minister Ioan I.C. Brătianu and to confess that only a few days before the Polish had demanded that Romania should not establish diplomatic relations with Lithuania. Although the envoy to Warsaw Alexandru Florescu had gained one year later the Polish acquiescence to Romania establishing diplomatic bonds with Lithuania and the Lithuanian Legation in Prague extended for a brief period of time its authority to cover also Romania on 21 August 1924 , a Romanian Legation to Lithuania was late to come into being and a diplomat to Kaunas was not appointed for more than a decade. An attempt to set up a Romanian legation to Lithuania failed to materialize, the main reason being Bucharest’s intention to accredit to Kaunas its envoy to Warsaw, which was wholly unacceptable to Lithuania. Even when a Romanian Legation was created in Riga according to the decisions adopted in late December 1928 to cover the eastern Baltic and Prince Mihail R. Sturdza was appointed in May 1929 to head it as charge d’affaires , no progress was achieved in integrating Lithuania in the Romanian system of diplomatic representation. Eventually, on 28 March 1931 a trade agreement between the two states was signed in Berlin containing the clause of most favoured nation, which was the first document to be concluded between the two states. Yet, the exchanges remained negligible and the agreement had little if any consequences. Soon after Titulescu’s second appointment at the head of Romania’s Foreign Ministry, the issue of accrediting an envoy to Kaunas resurfaced. The envoy to Riga, Prince Studza, was prompting for a decision in this matter already for some time by arguing that following Hitler’s accession to power a Romanian diplomatic representation to Kaunas would be welcomed and useful. This report followed other suggestions from Sturdza of 17 June 1931, 26 and 27 February 1933, asking for the extension of Riga Legation’s powers to Kaunas on the ground that the absence from Lithuania was affecting Romania’s capacity to gain valuable information serving itself and its allies’ interests and anticipating that important political developments were going to take place in Kaunas. Titulescu showed a renewed interest into opening a legation in Kaunas, the more so, as he was informed, Czechoslovakia had already been present there for five years and even Yugoslavia had appointed an envoy in 1933. Gradually, Titulescu’s foreign policy also acknowledged a change especially as a consequence of the threat he perceived coming from Germany’s revisionist program in the aftermath of the failure of the disarmament conference. The Polish-German Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934 and the steady improvement in the French-Czechoslovak-Soviet relations in 1934-1935 further changed the environment in which Romania’s foreign policy was pursued. Titulescu was also afraid that things might change in the Soviet foreign policy and he wanted to prevent the possibility of a German-Soviet rapprochement on the Rapallo pattern on the expense of Romania and its allies. Although badly striving to keep the relationship with Poland and Germany on a good track, by 1935 he chose to close ranks with the French-Czechoslovak-Soviet constellation of powers which had the merit of maintaining the Romanian foreign policy in line with Paris and supporting the collective security program which was the basis of his country’s foreign policy. Additionally, Romania was interested in the project of the Eastern Pact that was anathema to Poland. In the meantime, the Lithuanian Government was insisting upon appointing an envoy to Bucharest with residence in Prague but only on the basis of reciprocity. The Lithuanian envoy in Prague, Edvardas Turauskas, was the person chosen to represent Lithuania’s interest in Romania, presenting his credentials on 29 November 1935 to King Charles II. In these circumstances, a decree was signed on 1 December 1935 and the Romanian envoy to Riga and Tallinn was appointed to Kaunas, too. Constantin Văllimărescu, the first Romanian envoy to Riga, was informed of this decision on 18 December and the agreement of the Lithuanian government was quick into coming. This decision set the Romanian-Lithuanian relations on a track of normality, late but necessary. The relations between the two states will gradually develop in the subsequent years, although remaining minor in the equation of their bilateral foreign relations. Some tentative cultural, economic and diplomatic exchanges were recorded, diplomats of the two countries travelled to the other capital cities, conversations were held among the representatives etc. It was, however, too late and too little as in 1939-1940 the two countries fell prey to the provisions of the secret protocol Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and lost either their independence (as it was the case with Lithuania) or large territories inhabited by a Romanian majority (the case of Romania)."
