I’m ok and no one else was involved or harmed in this my left arm is pretty bruised and scraped from the airbags which scared me more than I thought honestly, other than having a little stiffness in my neck everything is good. We’ll see how the coming days fair.  My car however..not so good.  It was a freak accident I was turning off an exit that circles around (I was stopping to get gas) and as I’m making the turn my car keeps straight which was startling, I tried to correct it but unfortunately the 10in tall concrete median that separates both on/off ramps was too close.  Smashed right into it, airbags deployed and I end up in a ditch. \n\n  A wonderful woman named Shandra came to my aid, I was certainly in shock and slightly disoriented but her kindness and willingness to help me got me through this allowing me to sit with her in her car til help arrived. \n\nI eventually got my rental and made my way safely to North Carolina. \n\nId like to thank the people at @floyds_towing and @enterprise for their help It wasn’t more than 4 hours after my accident that I was back on the road.  Terry Floyd is the owner and has been in business for 52 years.  As I’m sitting in his office trying to find a ride to pick me up for my rental he offers me a water and says “you can stay here as long as you need to and if no one comes to get you I’ll have one my guys take you where you need to go.” I was moved by his kindness, he didn’t need to say or do that, I’m a complete stranger.  Many of you know of me but few of you KNOW me, I’m not a very religious man I’ve stepped away from faith years ago.  But this felt different so many things went right for me even though it was a terrible situation almost as if someone else was in control and was guiding me where I needed to go.  I would like to think it was my father watching over me, I was in the middle of nowhere by myself with a wrecked car, I couldn’t get ahold of my wife because she’s working, she didn’t know til a couple hours after it had happened but by then everything was ok. \n\nThank you again to the gracious people who helped me it’s amazing how a simple gesture can change your whole perspective.\".",
