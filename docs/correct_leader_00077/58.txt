A Classic

The building was designed by architect Väinö Vähäkallio, representing typical Nordic classicism of the 1920s. Finnish men called Väinö have played important roles in the history of this property. The building served as the headquarters of Cooperative Elanto from 1928 to 1995, during which period director Väinö Tanner actively managed its operations. Väinö Tanner had a strong hold of the entire organization, and also lived in the building with his family.

Thus it seems quite natural to rename the building as “The Väinö House”. We are going to renovate this beautiful building into an amazing business location with character to new tenants while respecting the culture and history of the building. Who wouldn't want to work at Väinö!
