        "text": "Quo No live after Exeter City's home match with Luton Town\n\nSt James Park will be hosting a special music event on Saturday, November 26, featuring Quo No – a Status Quo tribute band.\n\nStatus Quo defined British boogie music in the 1970s and are one of a select group of bands who can truly claim to have made a major impact on both the hard rock and pop chart music scenes.\n\nWith more than 60 hit singles and 30 albums to their name Status Quo have produced plenty of recognisable songs. Quo No is a fine tribute to Status Quo who specialise in capturing that authentic boogie-sound much loved by Quo-heads everywhere.\n\nThe event is scheduled to run from 8pm to midnight in the Centre Spot bar. The band will be performing two live sets of real status classics and album tracks.\n\nThis live performance promises to be a fantastic Christmas party and a brilliant experience for all those watching.\n\nTickets for this event are now on sale. They can be bought in advance via the reception for £5. Buying tickets on the night will cost £7 and by cash only.\n\nIf you have any further questions or enquiries please contact the club on 01392 411243."
