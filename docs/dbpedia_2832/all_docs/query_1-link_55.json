        "text": "Looking up the phrase status quo I find out that it means to keep the things the way they presently are, remain in present state is another definition. That is something often said to be the case with british veteran rockers of Status Quo as well, many say they are true to their name but are they really? I am not so sure about that as they are generally more varied than they are credited for. Remember hits like Rockin’ all Over the World and In the Army Now, they are not that similar, are they? And the same goes for most of what the band does and they are also not looking like they did back in the day, they have been going for over 40 years now and with the same people since 2000.\n\nIf you need to ask how Status Quo sound and read Hallowed I think you are in need of brain surgery. To ask how Status Quo sound is like asking what language they speak in England or what is the weather in England, it is those questions that are so bloody obvious that there is no need to ask them. What language to they speak in England? Which weather is most usual in England? and what does Status Quo sound like? ask any of those questions and people will think you are ready for the mental asylum, in a hurry.\n\nQuid Pro Quo is the latest offering by Status Quo and I believe it is their 29th studio album if I am correctly informed and one thing I come to think about when I listen to it is: have Status Quo ever sounded this good? I think the answer is no, they have not. Sure I have not heard all their albums and one of those I have not heard might be as good or better but that does not really change the fact that this is just one fantastic album. Quid Pro Quo said Hannibal Lecter once and now Status Quo says the same, it means an equal exchange which for which is the correct meaning. They did just that with the single Rock ‘n’ Roll ‘n’ You which they released online for free in exchange of feedback so the album name can be said to ring true.\n\nI think it is amazing that this band that has nothing to prove makes such a fantastic album, I mean look at 118 million sold units, 64 British hit singles - more than any other band - 22 of which have hit the Top Ten, only Rolling Stones beat the 33 (34 with this album that reached top ten in Britain immediately) british album chart entries of Status Quo. 106 appearances on BBC TV's 'Top of the Pops' - More than any other group, excess of seven and a half years (415 weeks) in the British Singles Chart. In 1988 Status Quo played a record breaking series of fourteen sell out shows to over 300, 000 people at the giant Olympic Stadium in Moscow. September 21st 1991 saw Status Quo enter the Guinness Book of Records when they successfully completed their most ambitious project ever by playing four British shows in 11 hours and 11 minutes. The 'ROCK 'TIL YOU DROP' event saw Status Quo play sell out shows at Sheffield Arena, Glasgow SE&CC, Birmingham NEC and Wembley Arena. And the list of achievements can be made endless but that would result in a too long review which I do not want. But agree that it is quite the impressive list of achievements and these were just a fraction, check out their website for more.\n\nBut back to the fantastic Quid Pro Quo album it has fourteen new tracks and then ends with the 2010 recording of In the Army Now, it will take you fifty seven minutes to play through the album and strangely enough it does not feel that long, you know why? It is so varied that it manages to maintain your interest all the way through. It all starts with trademark boogie rock in the opening Two Way Traffic which is a great opener that will get you into the correct mood at once. It is followed by the said free single Rock ‘n’ Roll ‘n’ You which is a real treat for any music fan, great energy, catchiness and a great song. And I can go on like that about any song on the album but elect not to as the review would be even more boring than my usual reviews. “I’m gonna tell you something I know - simplify, demystify” is a line from the absolutely amazing Better Than That and immediately when hearing that line I realised that it is exactly what Status Quo is about, make it simpler and demystify. I think that Leave a Little Light on is worth to mention as a great track and the same goes for the following track Any Way You Like It which has a very classical Status Quo sound, a bit back to the basics. The next track Frozen Hero feel like a more modern mould of Status Quo and it is a brilliant track that I often hit back upon to play again. The Winner is another winner and the same goes for the ending In the Army Now and really it does not matter which 2010, 1986 it is the same when hand grenades fly over your head.\n\nI am so impressed with this album and this band, in their simplicity they are so brilliant and I would say they are pure musical genius no matter if they find the fourth chord or not, they simplify, demystify to turn dust to gold. I think Status Quo is the grand masters of my favourite expression, “Less is More”, their boogie rock may seem less but in its amazing catchiness along with the longevity of the layering in the songs it is much, much more. Frank, Rick, Andy, Rhino and Matt I salute you even though we are not in the army now.\n\nWith all that said, this album is fantastic and it is without a shadow of a doubt the best album of 2011, they just said we’re better than that and I agree completely. Over 40 years active and they are still rockin’ all over the world so in a way it is status quo, they are just as brilliant now as they were before and then some. Status Quo have never sounded this good!"
