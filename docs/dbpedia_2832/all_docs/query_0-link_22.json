        "text": "Burning Bridges\n\nStatus Quo - Burning Bridges (Official Video)\n\nStatus Quo’s song ‘Burning Bridges’ is a rock anthem that was released in 1988 as a single from their album Ain’t Complaining.\n\nThe song is based on the melody of a traditional English folk song called ‘Darby Kelly’, which is about a drummer who played at the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nThe lyrics of ‘Burning Bridges’ are about leaving behind the past and moving on to the future, with references to historical events such as the Norman Conquest and the American Revolution.\n\nThe song was a commercial success, reaching number five in the UK.\n\nManchester United teamed up with Status Quo and used it as the basis for their FA Cup song ‘Come On You Reds’ in 1994, topping the charts.\n\nWhat You're Proposing\n\nStatus Quo - What You're Proposing • TopPop\n\nReleased in 1980, this was a single from their album Just Supposin’.\n\nThe song was written by Francis Rossi and Bernie Frost, and it reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, becoming one of their most successful hits.\n\nThe song is a rock tune with a catchy chorus and a guitar solo by Rick Parfitt. The lyrics are about a casual relationship that the narrator is not sure about, and he keeps asking “what you’re proposing” to his partner.\n\nSome of the influences of the song include Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, and The Beatles, as well as other rock and roll artists of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nRoll Over Lay Down\n\nRoll Over Lay Down - Status Quo\n\nThis song was first released on their sixth studio album, Hello!, in 1973, and it became one of their most popular and enduring songs.\n\nThe song was later released as the A-side of a live EP, Quo Live, in 1975, to celebrate the band’s 13th anniversary. The EP was a success, reaching number 9 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nPaper Plane\n\nPaper Plane - Status Quo\n\nThis was the first single from Status Quo's fifth studio album, Piledriver, which marked a change in their musical style from psychedelic pop to hard rock and boogie rock.\n\nThe song was written by Francis Rossi and Bob Young, and is about the desire to escape from the mundane and boring aspects of life, and to fly away like a paper plane.\n\nThe song reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart, and was one of their first songs to feature the distinctive twin guitar sound that would become their trademark.\n\nIn the Army Now\n\nStatus Quo - In The Army Now\n\nReleased in 1986, ‘In the Army Now’ is a cover of a song that was originally written and performed by Dutch duo Rob and Ferdi Bolland, also known as Bolland & Bolland, in 1982.\n\nThe song is a sarcastic and critical commentary on the American military involvement in the Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975 and resulted in millions of casualties.\n\nThe song depicts the harsh realities and dangers of being a soldier, such as facing bullets, bombs, mines and diseases, and contrasts them with the naive and romanticized expectations of joining the army, such as wearing a uniform, travelling the world and having fun.\n\nThe song was a huge hit for Status Quo, reaching number one in several countries. It also became a popular anthem for anti-war movements and peace activists around the world.\n\nThe band re-recorded the song in 2010 with new lyrics to support the British troops in Afghanistan and to raise funds for the Help for Heroes charity.\n\nPictures of Matchstick Men\n\nStatus Quo - Pictures of Matchstick Men (1968) [High Quality Sound, Subtitled]\n\nThis track is a classic example of psychedelic rock from the late 1960s. The song was written by Francis Rossi, who was inspired by the paintings of LS Lowry, a British artist known for his scenes of industrial life in northern England.\n\nLowry often depicted workers and buildings as stylized figures and shapes, which Rossi compared to matchsticks.\n\nThe song became the band’s first hit, reaching number 7 in the UK. The song features a distinctive guitar riff that repeats throughout, as well as a flanging effect that creates a swirling sound.\n\nCaroline\n\nStatus Quo - Caroline\n\n‘Caroline’ was released as a single in 1973 and reached number five in the UK. It was also included on their seventh studio album, Hello!\n\nThe song was written by the band’s lead singer and guitarist Francis Rossi and their roadie and harmonica player Bob Young. They composed the song on a napkin in a hotel in Cornwall in 1971, and recorded a demo with Rossi playing guitar and bass, and Terry Williams on drums.\n\nThe band later changed the arrangement from a slow blues song to a fast rock song, using their stage equipment and amplifiers.\n\nWhatever You Want\n\nStatus Quo - Whatever You Want (Official Video Remastered)\n\nStatus Quo’s song 'Whatever You Want' is a classic rock anthem that showcases the band’s energetic and catchy style.\n\nThe song was written by Rick Parfitt and Andy Bown, and was released as the lead single from the album of the same name in 1979. The song reached number 4 on the UK charts and became one of the band’s most popular and enduring hits.\n\nThe song is about having the freedom to choose your own path in life, regardless of what others may think or say. The song features a distinctive guitar riff that is instantly recognizable and memorable.\n\nDown Down\n\nStatus Quo - Down down 1974 Video Sound HQ\n\n'Down Down' is a classic rock anthem that showcases Status Quo's signature boogie style. It was written by Francis Rossi and Bob Young, who were inspired by T Rex’s debut single 'Debora'.\n\nThe song was originally titled 'Get Down', but it was changed before release to avoid confusion with Gilbert O’Sullivan’s song of the same name.\n\n'Down Down' was the lead single from the band’s eighth studio album On the Level. The song reached number one in the UK in 1975, becoming Status Quo’s only number one hit in their home country."
