        "text": "A blended malt whisky paying homage to Status Quo's best-selling album Piledriver has been released to mark its 50th anniversary.\n\nThe seven-year-old whisky has been released by Glasgow-based independent bottler Caskade Drinks and was chosen by Francis Rossi and Status Quo, with guidance from ex-Edrington blender Max McFarlane.\n\nStatus Quo's Piledriver is the third release in Caskade's limited-edition Artist Collection. The liquid is composed of single malt whiskies from six distilleries across Scotland that were exclusively aged in first-fill sherry casks.\n\nReleased in 1972, Piledriver was the first album that Status Quo produced themselves and the first release on their Vertigo label, which has since earned its place among the best of British 70s rock.\n\nGareth Croll of Caskade Drinks said: “Status Quo are famous for their precision guitar riffs and perfectly balanced anthems - so we reckoned we absolutely had to make this a symphonic blended whisky that nods to their character and unique sound. Max [Mcfarlane] really knocked it out of the park blending this one.”\n\nStatus Quo’s Piledriver Blended Malt is available to order from 10am on 8 December via caskadedrinks.com. Only 500 bottles will be made available."
