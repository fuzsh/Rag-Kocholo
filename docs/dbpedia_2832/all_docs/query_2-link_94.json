        "text": "Status Quo broke through commercially in the 1970s, but this was no overnight success story. Long before the denim and the heads down boogie, there was a band formed in 1962 by school friends Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster, learning their craft for many years before they became the Quo we know. There would be many ups, downs and sartorial as well as musical variations into which ‘The Early Years’ a new 5CD set from BMG, takes a deep dive, including material from pre-Quo acts The Spectres and Traffic Jam as well as the first two albums credited to Status Quo with plentiful bonus tracks including BBC sessions. The full press release and track listing follows:\n\nStatus Quo release “The Early Years (1966-69)” on 15 March 2024 via BMG on 5CD clamshell boxset [Cat No BMGCAT900BOX]. This collection features songs from the Pre-Status Quo days, as the first iterations of the bands that developed into Status Quo found their feet, and began to find their sound, and also early material from the nascent Quo.\n\n“The Early Years (1966-69)” boasts recordings from The Spectres, who then became Traffic Jam. Included also are full Mono and Stereo remastered versions of the first two original Status Quo albums, the debut ‘Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from the Status Quo’ and ‘Spare Parts’. There is also a selection of Single A- and B-Sides, extensive material from BBC sessions, fascinating Outtakes, Demos and Alternate Mixes, and rare track versions. The whole collection is completed by the addition of 40 page booklet with extensive sleeve notes and wonderful photography of memorabilia from the era, including items drawn from the band’s own collection.\n\nStatus Quo are one of Britain's most successful and long-running bands. They were founded in London in 1962 by Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster. After a number of name and line-up changes, including the introduction of John Coghlan in 1963 and Rick Parfitt in 1967, when the band were known as The Status Quo; they became Status Quo in 1969. The band have had over 60 chart hits in the UK, 22 of which reached the top 10. They have released over 100 singles and 33 albums, 25 of which made the UK top 10. In 1985, Status Quo opened Live Aid at Wembley Stadium with ‘Rockin' All Over The World’ and in 1991 they received a Brit Award for ‘Outstanding Contribution To Music’. Status Quo, still led by Francis Rossi, continue to tour, and Francis has also developed his own one-man show telling stories from these early days and beyond.\n\nFully supported by the band, “The Early Years (1966-69)” is a phenomenal collection that will be cherished by Quo fans the world over. “The Early Years (1966-69)” is not only packed full of incredible music, but is also a release that tracks the development and evolution of one of rock’s most enduring and important acts."
