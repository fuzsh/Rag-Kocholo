If you're going to cut out over half of it then it may as well not be there.\n\ndennis, the intention was always to record two albums, me ol' china plate. There were no leftovers, as such. Alan wasn't keen but that was the intention from the beginning, for record company reasons mainly. Certain things happened that led to various songs being finished before others and hence why we had certain songs on Just Supposin' and then on Never Too Late.\n\nThey just ran out of time in Dublin. This loss of tracking time was largely due to Rick burning his finger after a night of drink and other stuff, partying with Scott Gorham. Rick fell asleep in his room with a burning cigar in his fingers. He was lucky he woke up in time and Liz Gernon took him to hospital to have the burns dealt with and dressed. As Rick was out of action for about a week, the band and producer could only continue doing overdubs on songs that were already advanced tracking wise. The tracks that were recorded first became the tracks that were finished first and became Just Supposin', by default.\n\nStudio time ran out on them eventually and other acts were booked in the studio, so Quo had to leave. Bob Young went over to Dublin to record the harp on Coming and Going as an overdub.\n\nBack in the UK and What You're Proposing is mixed in Rossi's roof studio. Other tracks were mixed at the The Marquee studios. The tracks that were most advanced dub and mix wise etc were the ones that became JS. The solo of Rock n Roll had been recorded in Rossi's home studio. Carol, Something 'bout You Baby and AB Blues were recorded in what was then Rick's newly completed studio and games room. Riverside became something of a Rossi/Frost project and a last minute addition to the album.\n\nRick definitely played a significant role in these albums, not just from the cigar incident point of view (!) but from being very involved in the sessions, something that changed at times later on, I believe.\n\nAfter the tracks for JS had been mastered, they went to work on the dubs for the tracks that would become NTL.\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nInteresting. Never really given it much thought, although we probably all have at least one nagging irritation about an otherwise perfect album.\n\nTop album for me has always been Hello! and, classic as the song is, it always disappointed me (only very slightly mind) that Softer Ride was on it. I'd already wiped the grooves off it with the Paper Plane single! So when I bought the album, I technically only had 6 new tracks to listen to after the release of Caroline as a single. That's about the only negative thing I can say about the album. Which isn't a lot really, is it?\n\nBottom of the heap will always be Back To Back. Certainly THE biggest disappointment. But it has Too Close To The Ground and No Contract on it as saviours. I know many see the latter song as a lame heavy metal attempt, but I like it. And the production on it seems different to the rest of the album. Which it probably isn't There is even an absence of irritating synths on it. It's a truly guitar driven song during a plinky-plonky keyboard driven era.\n\nHe pontificated\n\nand fretbuzzzzz , your post is all news to me! Extremely interesting and educational. Nice one"
