        "text": "Hey, at least if all the oldsters are going to shows down at the local tribal casino you don't have to worry about them being creepy at your favorite hot spot. Now if you'll excuse me Gam-Gam needs a ride to the Laser Tupac Hologram Extravaganza.\n\nRednex's timeline of band members.\n\n2001 was the entire band quitting in protest after a conflict with their producer (who just hired a new band, with blackjack and hookers). 2012 was when that same producer decided to ditch the idea of a permanent band entirely, and just pick 4 people from a large pool for each concert.\n\nJust missing the list: Foghat. The drummer is still hanging in there. But all the people who made them Foghat are dead or otherwise gone. And, yes, Foghat is still touring. Playing casinos and summer riverfront park shows.\n\nThey still have 3 out of 4 from before the first album and first tour. Good enough for me. Some bands wikipedia are ultra specific about what was happening when the \"band\" was just a bunch of high schoolers playing in a garage. I just want to know what the lineup looked like when they got serious.\n\nKiss could get away with it in perpetuity. With all that make-up on and sound-alike voices, how would you know it's not the original lineup up there?\n\nRight? Right? Why the fark WOULDN'T you do that? I'd never pay to see zombie Skynyrd, but I probably would have paid to see an all star thing with LS,Blackfoot,Outlaws etc.\n\nLook, these long ago ceased to be bands. They are what we might call going concerns. They employ a lot of people, who as Jerry Garcia once pointed out, rely on them for their jobs."
