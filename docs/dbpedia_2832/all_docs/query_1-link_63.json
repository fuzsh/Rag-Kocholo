        "text": "Rossi & co didn`t have to worry at all about this record review as the album went to No. 1 in the UK and was a big album for them in other parts of the world too.\n\nRead on!\n\nIdentikit boogies\n\nSTATUS QUO: “Hello” (Vertigo)\n\nAlbum review by Charles Shaar Murray\n\nI GUESS I ought to be grateful to Status Quo. If I hadn’t heard this album, I wouldn’t have thought of writing the “Heavy Metal” piece that appeared in last week’s issue.\n\nI doubt if that’ll comfort them any since I am told that when Francis Rossie (or “Mick Rossi” as he used to be in more innocent days) was told that I was reviewing this album, he waxed profane and opined that the band had “had it now.”\n\nWell, rest easy, Francis. I don’t think that “Hello” is going to end up in my “Top 10 Albums of 1973” list, but it ain’t too offensive.\n\nIn fact, it sounds quite nice if you don’t listen too closely. It chugs along quite effectively, and Quo bang out dem ‘ol tried and trusted riffs with a certain amount of precision and enthusiasm.\n\nThere’s even a very nice little neo-Beatles tune called “Claudie”, which would be quite charming if the lads had modified their basic heavy approach slightly, not to mention a cut which winds like a bastardised version of “Truckin”.\n\nNow to the bad news. Once you get past the basic sound and production, there’s naught of any real substance there. The solos are woefully unimaginative, and the songwriting also lacks any real inspiration. Quo’s trouble is basically that they’re rather clichè-ridden.\n\nClichès aren’t necessarily bad in themselves, as to a certain extent most good rock music depends on an imaginative and creative juxtaposition of clichès.\n\nThe problem here is that Quo are not masters of the clichè, but slaves to it. In the hands of a master, the presentation of something half-familiar (or even totally familiar) can be quite enlightening.\n\nOn the other hand, the same clichè presented badly simply causes anguished mutterings of “Oh shit, not that again”. And sad-to-say, when Status Quo trot out their identikit boogie, it is the latter reaction that prevails.\n\nBut again, Francis, rest easy. Most of the people who dig you are going to enjoy the album, so why worry? Gotta rush now – I’m going over to Nick Kent’s to hear some Carpenters albums.\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested. Send it to: geirmykl@gmail.com\n\nThe offer should be 20 $ (US Dollars) to be considered. (This includes postage).\n\nIf you order several papers – contact me for a “special” offer.\n\nWe conduct the transaction through my verified Paypal account for the safety of both parties.\n\nIf you have a large collection of the following magazines, don`t throw them out, but contact me as I would be very interested in these: Creem, Circus, Hit Parader and Metal Edge.\n\nIf you have a music-related web-page where this fits – please make a link to the article.
