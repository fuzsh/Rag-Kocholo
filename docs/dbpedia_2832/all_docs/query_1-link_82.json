        "text": "I have been thinking about doing this thread for a while. There are certainly some fans of the Quo on these boards even if the band failed to achieve permanent success in the US (contrary to UK, Europe, Australia and various other markets). My interest in what is currently touring under the name \"Status Quo\" has waned after Rick Parfitt's sad passing last year, but I don't want to be bitter about Francis Rossi or the members that are playing with him. I don't agree with the notion that the Frantic Four line-up made the only good Quo music, as we'll see in this thread. Still, even for the purist fans it's a good time to start this thread because finally all the classic Vertigo albums are available as deluxe editions (mastered by Andy Pearce, with more or less interesting bonus material).\n\nWhile the music press has never cared much for the band, I think they offer more variety and substance than they are often given credit for and it's also a goal of this thread to prove it. But certainly Quo are mainly fun listening and not ridden with philosophical ideas or highly complicated musical concepts. I sometimes think of them as the British equivalent of boogie bands such as Canned Heat or ZZ Top, the main difference being that the Quo are less laid back and more aggressive.\n\nMy intention is to cover every album release, including selected bonus tracks and rarities (i.e. singles-only material) plus live stuff.\n\nI'm going to post the album covers and detailed information for each LP but will only write reviews for those albums I'm really familiar with (mainly 70s and 2000s stuff), so feel free to step in if you think you've got something to say. Reviews and views are welcome!\n\nFor additional reading pleasure and sometimes opposing views, I recommend this series of texts written by forum member @Ma Kelly (his username will be explained in this thread as well, in case you don't know!) though mind it stops in 1984. http://rateyourmusic.com/list/koeeoaddi_there/the_mother****in_quo/1/\n\nFinally one last comment before we get rolling. I prefer a slow but steady pace (also because of my online habits).

This is remarkable because 1) the Beatles-led music boom hadn’t truly begun yet and 2) the band members were in their very early teens when the band was formed! They played at Butlin’s Minehead (a sort of holiday camp) alongside another band called The Highlights, which consisted of Rick Parfitt and the twin sisters Gloria and Jean Harrison. (Watch Rick, Gloria and Jean reminisce on the “Hello Quo” DVD!) While The Spectres played rock music, The Highlights were more of a cabaret band but Rick was attracted to the sound of that other group. He and Francis quickly became friends and hung out a lot together. One curious thing both had in common – Rick had called himself “Richard Harrison” with the Highlights and Francis had been calling himself “Mike Rossi”. Both weren’t too happy about their real names!\n\nWhen The Spectres released their first single (a cover of \"I (Who Have Nothing)\"), they consisted of Francis Rossi, Alan Lancaster, Roy Lynes and John Coghlan. Two more singles (“Hurdy Gurdy Man” and another cover, “(We Ain’t Got) Nothin’ Yet”) were released but none were successful. The name change to Traffic Jam (after Steve Winwood & company had already secured the name \"Traffic\") didn't change that and this group's only single (“Almost But Not Quite There”) was no hit either. Another change however prefigured their breakthrough, as Francis' friend Rick Parfitt (who’d just got ‘stilettoed’ after an argument with the singing twins…) was brought into the group, mainly for his voice. The band was now called \"The Status Quo\" and recorded a Rossi song that had been treated with all kinds of cool effects in the studio, thereby planting the band firmly into the psychedelic movement.\n\n\"Pictures of Matchstick Men\" became the quasi-title track of the debut album (which we'll come to shortly) and is rightly regarded as a classic of the psychedelic era (and has been re-recorded in 1999 and 2014 as well as played live). However those six early recordings were not included on the debut album or one of its reissues, even if the deluxe edition contains excerpts of the BBC sessions done as Spectres and Traffic Jam. Three unreleased Spectres tracks (including The Bee Gees' \"Spicks and Specks\" later re-recorded for the Quo debut) were later released on Castle's \"Singles Collection\", two more were released on a rare vinyl release called \"Riots of the Amphetamine Generation\".\n\nI wish all those quartet recordings were collected on a single CD!\n\nWhat do you think about the tracks recorded before \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\"?\n\n1968: Picturesque Matchstickable Messages\n\nRick Parfitt * 12.10.1948\n\n1968: Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from The Status Quo\n\n1.

The next single \"Black Veils of Melancholy\", Francis Rossi admitted was an attempt of repeating the success with a very similar sounding song. However, Alan Lancaster said that he doesn't think the songs are similar. In any case, it was not a hit and they went back to outside writers Marty Wilde (himself a former teenage idol and father of Kim Wilde!) and Ronnie Scott for the proper follow-up \"Ice in the Sun\". This was more poppy and less rocky but did contain another ear-catching sound effect, in this case the sound of a plectrum scraping across the piano strings!\n\nWhen the debut album was finally released in 1968 it featured a mixture of psychedelic-sounding originals written by or for the band and covers of relatively current pop ‘hit’ songs (with hindsight not such a good move, but acceptable back then). The preceding singles were all included, with the exception of \"To Be Free\" (b-side of \"Black Veils...\"), later included on the reissues. Speaking of reissues, there was a 1998 remaster on Castle by Robert Corich and Mike Brown and a deluxe edition in 2003 (not sure who remastered that one). Unfortunately neither reissue is available anymore. I've tried to spark some movement but at the moment, it doesn't seem like BMG are willing to change anything about this situation. Personally, I would love a double CD that contains everything the band recorded in that era (i.e. all BBC Sessions) and the earlier, \"Rickless\" Spectres and Traffic Jam recordings put on an extra disc (see above)."
