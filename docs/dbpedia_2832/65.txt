Status Quo is an English group that was founded in 1969 under the leadership of Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster. The origins of the group date back to 1962 when it was called The Scorpions. It will take the name of The Specters from 1963, then The Status Quo from 1967. A group that can boast of having one of the largest numbers of titles classified in the English Charts with no less than sixty including twenty-two in the English Top 10 singles.

The real starting point of the group took place in January 1968 when the single "Pictures of Matchstick men" was released, an enormous title which went around the world and launched the group's career for good. An exceptional year 1968 for the group as they aligned the same year a second mega hit with the title "Ice in the sun". All taken from their first album "Picturesque matchstickable messages from the status quo" (!).

The album "Spare parts" which came out in 1969 did not really experience the same level of success and forced the group to change their musical direction. This is how they adopt the so-called hard rock boogie sound. Which won't change much because the albums "My Kelly's greasy spoon" from 1970 and "Dog of two head" from 1971 will not do much better than "Spare parts".

It was the change of label and the arrival at Vertigo in 1972 that suddenly revived the machine. The group released the album "Piledriver" that year, an album that allowed them to regain success with the title "Paper plane". The momentum is on and is not about to end. New album hits with "Hello !" in 1973 and "Quo" in 1974. But it was above all "On the level" in 1975 that allowed them to achieve consecration thanks to the enormous title "Down down" which became their highest ranked title of all.

At the rate of one album a year, it was the album "Blue for you" which came out in 1976. And like its predecessor, it was a huge global success. Album which will mainly produce the top hit "Rain". Then it was the turn of the album "Rockin 'all over the world" to be released in 1977. A pivotal year in which the group's sound evolved to come closer and closer to the standards of the time. Album with less success but which will produce a mega hit with the single of the same name.

Always on the same dynamic, it is the album "If you can’t stand the heat" which was released in 1978. The group's discography grew from year to year at breakneck speed.

Each year its release, for the year 1979, it will be the album "Whatever you want" which produces the mega-hit of the same name. Then "Just suppose" which in turn came out in 1980. Each album now having its mega hit, for this album, it will be the single "What you’re proposing".

A change of decade that rhymes with strong tensions within the group, forcing some historical members to leave the ship. Departures and arrivals follow one another and yet in no way disturb the phenomenal dynamics of the group. This is how the album "Never too late" was released in 1981, an album which is entitled to its mega hit like the others, namely "Something‘ bout you baby I like ". Then "1 + 9 + 8 + 2" in 1982, which unlike the others, only produced a small global hit with "Dear John". Then it will be "Back to back" in 1983, which produced 4 singles on its own but only one will be successful, namely "Ol’ rag blues ".

Then nothing during the years 1984 and 1985, as surprising as that may seem. It is better to return to 1986 with the hugely huge album "In the army now", a flagship album that will produce one of their most emblematic titles with the single of the same name. An album with multiple hits with 2 other notorious hits which are "Rollin' home" and "Dreamin".

New air hole in 1987. And another comeback in 1988 with the album "Ain’t complaining" which mainly produced the mega hit of the same name. Back in force which will be the last. Because all the albums that will be released subsequently, and there will be, none will produce mega hits equivalent to those of the late 70s and early 80s.

Except in 1990 with the titles "The anniversary Waltz - Part One" and "The anniversary Waltz - Part Two" which will be their last hits of planetary scale.

Which will not prevent them from continuing the adventure thereafter and continuing to produce titles of more than certain quality.

Tracks :

1966...they are not yet called Status Quo but they are still taking their very first steps here. We have to start well one day...

1966...beginnings which will go unnoticed to say the least but this at least allows the group to start practicing as they say...

1967...there will be no takeoff under the name The Spectres. Which will not have stopped them from producing titles that are not devoid of interest...

1967...we find them under the name The Traffic Jam but this one will not work any more than the previous one unfortunately...

1968 ... the huge title that will reveal them and offer them their first global hit. A shattering start for a group that will become year after year one of the major groups of the end of the twentieth century ...

1968...a sequel which will not be able to compete in terms of success but which will come very close. A year 1968 decidedly most favorable...

1968 ... a year 1968 which saw the group literally explode on the international scene. We couldn't ask for a better start !

1968...the rise of the group is linear and the dynamic of success is now well in place. Everything is fine...

1969...even if this title and its predecessor will not have managed to stand out from the crowd, regardless the best is inevitably to come...

1969...a decade of the 60s which allowed them to blossom and begin to make a significant impact on themselves. It's already that...

1969...everything is ready now that seeing them reach the heights during the next decade, it is only a question of time as they say...

1970 ... a change of decade which sees the group adopt a tone that he will keep almost until the end. A unique electric guitar sound that will forever remain their trademark...

1970...a change in sound which pays off in any case since the 2 titles released during this year 1970 will be classified...

1971...a single-title year 1971 which will not remain as their best vintage since this Single title will not even be classified...

1972...this one won't do better but there's no need to worry about them at this stage. For now everything is under control...

1972...a year 1972 which does not prevent them from progressing, slowly but surely. And which allows them to show that they are not there by chance...

1972...as much as the previous year was poor in titles, this one will be full of them. Quantity, quality, what more could you ask for...

1973 ... songs with crazy tempo, another of their particularity. A unique know-how that allows them to stand out from the crowd. But that also marginalizes them somewhat ...

1973...a title which will pass somewhat under the radar but which does not once again call into question the group's rise to the top...

1973...the machine begins to rev up in terms of top hits and this is only the beginning. We are almost on track for 20 uninterrupted years of success at this level. Yes, yes, 20 years !

1974...year after year, title after title, the group gets closer to the summits. They might not be very far away...

1974...then comes THIS title ! They will sign here quite simply the biggest success of their entire career. An enormous title, 1000 % rock, which works perfectly and always in their very particular style. MAS-TER-FUL !

1975 ... that, what is certain with them, is that it beats up. Pure, hard rock that purists love. And that's only the beginning !

1976 ... the group grows inexorably year after year and will line up no less than 2 mega planetary hits that year, plus a top hit, just that. A title called 'rain' but it would be rather great musical weather for the group !

1976 ... the 'little' hit, here it is. A track that spins at 200 km/h and that literally makes you dizzy. Attention to the exit of the road gentlemen ...

1976 ... a year 1976 which ended in apotheosis with this new mega hit. A mega hit which definitely positions the group as one of the biggest phenomena of the moment !

1977 ... 'little' year 1977 with only one mega hit on the clock. But once again, what a hit ! Each title released now becomes an event in himself. HU-GE !

1977...there will be another title during this year 1977 but the latter will go much more unnoticed. Nothing to worry about at this stage anyway...

1978 ... the group is on an incredible dynamic which does not weaken an Iota. And always this frenzied tempo which takes everything in its path. We will not do them again, that's clear !

1978 ... when it wants, the group can be softer, the proof with this title. A deceleration that feels good !

1979 ... each year its mega mega hit. For the year 1979, it will be this one. And on the tempo side, we suspected that the deceleration was not going to last ...

1979 ... would it really be the same band...? Yes, yes, unbelievably as it may seem, they are indeed the same. Like what, with them, everything is possible !

1980 ... one would have thought that the passage to the 80s would relegate them to the rank of 'Has Been' given the sound evolution underway at the beginning of the decade. Oh no, not only they resist but in addition, they will adapt. We will see the result !

1980 ... well, evolution is not yet for now. But we will not have to delay because time is running out and the competition does not intend to give them a gift ...

1981 ... for the moment, the group oscillates between 2 basic trends. A foot in the 70s, a foot in the 80s. They will quickly have to choose ...

1981 ... unheard of, one of their very rare Intimist titles. And my gosh, they're far from ridiculous. Sure, it won't be the Ultimate Slow of the year, but at least they're trying !

1982 ... the group still does not manage to situate himself on the musical chessboard of the 80s. But it will be necessary because the gap with the competition grows from year to year ...

1982...a plethoric year 1982 in terms of titles but with relative success depending on the titles. There will be winners and losers...

1982...that does not prevent them from continuing their adventure in their own way and above all at their own speed. Waiting for better...

1983 ... the sound evolves slowly, but surely. A positive development which will allow the group to find a more than beneficial second wind !

1983...they decide to cover here Elvis Presley dating from 1960. A revisited version which will not equal the original but not without interest, that's for sure...

1983 ... the group begins to vary the tempos and decrease the sound intensity of the electric guitars. The best is clear !

1984 ... even if the musical fundamentals remain the same, the group still tries to diversify. And my faith, we're going in the right direction ...

1986 ... exceptional fact, nothing will happen in 1985. We could have hoped that the 1985 empty year would be a good advisor but it will not be for this time, we find them on the same musical bases as by the past. Still missed ...

1986...after the success in the Charts is still significant and when we see what is on the horizon, there is no need to worry about them !

1986 ... then THIS title comes ! Even if this title will not be their biggest commercial success, it remains surely, and by far, the most emblematic. An incredible title, perfectly in keeping with its time and which definitively consecrates the group as one of the major groups of the end of the XXth century. MAS-TER-FUL !

1986 ... the group sets out again directly in its frenzied rhythms. Not even time to breathe, drive away the natural, it comes back at a gallop ...

1988 ... new air hole in 1987, so back in 1988 in a fashion that we now know by heart. 20 years after their debut, the group will be one of the few still present at this stage to have hardly evolved in terms of sound. Incredible but true...

1988 ... the end of the decade which saw the group suddenly stall, despite real efforts to evolve with the times. Nice try but inconclusive test ...

1988...certain titles like this will manage to slip under the radar but that absolutely does not call into question the destiny of the group in the short term...

1988...they are going to revisit John Fogerty's title from 1975 here and the least we can say is that their version definitely holds up !

1988 ... a year 1988 which sees the group mixing several styles and several influences. Unfortunately, the result will be pretty much the same every time. That is to say disappointing ...

1989...the last year of an exceptional decade for the group. A decade which saw them reach the summits and land their direct ticket to posterity. What ask for more...

1989...it now remains to be seen what the following decade has in store for them : remaining in the Elite or gradual decline ? The future will tell us...

1990...the start of the 90s which allowed them the luxury of obtaining a new global top hit. So we have a semblance of an answer to the previous question...

1990 ... a sequel that will do almost as strong. A year 1990 which unfolds under the best auspices. Not sure that it will last very long ...

1991 ... a style too 'typed' which no longer really fits, if not at all with the 90s. The decline is underway ...

1992...fortunately they still manage to stay afloat in their native land, which is already that. The essential is preserved as they say...

1994 ... no questioning of the group despite an obvious dropout in the Charts for years. Suicidal strategy but hey, it's them who see ...

1994...as long as England continues to support them it does not necessarily seem necessary for them to question themselves any further...

1994...especially as albums sales continue to do well. So they continue on their merry way slowly but surely...

1995...only one title for this year 1995 and which will pass more or less under the radar. A year 1995 to quickly forget...

1996 ... Status Quo which covers an emblematic Beach Boys song, this one had to be tried. When 2 legends from the 60s and 70s meet, it pulsates as they say ...

1996...after the Beach Boys, it's Fleetwood Mac's turn to be popular. A revisited version of their 1977 title not without interest...

1996...a year 1996 clearly more interesting than the previous one, particularly in terms of production of titles. The essential is preserved once again...

1999 ... 30 years after their debut, nothing has changed. A non-development extremely rare among the greatest. An astonishing strategy but which will still have allowed them to last so long. Double paradox ...

1999...certainly the 90s will not have been able to match the 80s in terms of success achieved but they will at least have managed to stay afloat a little...

1999...it now remains to be seen whether they will attempt the transition to the next decade and especially under what conditions...

2000...they will have gone through the 60s, then the 70s, then the 80s, then the 90s and here they are at the gates of this 2000s. Quite a feat all the same...

2000...new version revisited this time of Bob Seger's title dating from 1979. Good work as they say but nothing more...

2002...a new opus which will sell particularly well and prove de facto that the group is still in the race...

2005...new version revisited this time of the Patty Loveless title dating from 1997. Luxury covers which generally succeed quite well...

2005...for the moment everything continues to go in an ideal way for the group even if the success no longer has anything to do with what they experienced previously...

2007...an adventure that lasts, which lasts, which lasts and which proves with certainty that this group will undoubtedly remain one of the most talented of its generation...

2007...the album production remains impressive, it is clear. Not only are they still here 40 years after their debut but they are far from having said everything, and especially sung everything at first glance...

2007...we will enjoy until the end in any case what they still have to offer us. Especially since the adventure is far from over...

2008...seeing the group in special Christmas mode is surprising to say the least and above all unexpected. An original title that breaks their codes in any case...

2008...an astonishing title which sees them take risks and join forces with Scooter, a group which is far, very far from their usual universe. Given the success achieved by this title, they should dare to make this type of association much more often !

2011...they are attacking a new decade here, one more ! Unstoppable, the little guys, and we're here to stay like this for a little while longer...

2011...it is clear that the best years are far behind but each new opus still resonates with the public. Like what...

2011...a desire to believe in it until the end which undoubtedly commands respect. They won't give up and it doesn't matter whether there is success or not...

2012...it would have been a shame if they threw in the towel out of simple weariness because it is clear that they still have things to offer, and quality ones too...

2012...they really impress with their ability to produce titles of more than certain interest, decade after decade...

2013...it is clear that such a long career is a pure and simple feat. Very few groups of the new generation will have such long and successful careers...

2013...with each title we say to ourselves that it may be the last and each time they come back again and again. Well done little guys !

2013...we still have to remember that they started their career in 1966 ! Who could have imagined for a single second at that time that they would still be there almost 50 years later...

2014...quality always and again. A level of inspiration that crosses fashions and decades with impressive ease...

2014...a resistance to time that we only find among the greatest. That's how we recognize them...

2015...not sure if this is the style and sound that are most appropriate to capture the younger generation but whatever...

2015...not sure that this is their main target anyway. As long as their core fans continue to follow them that seems to be enough for them at first glance...

2016...a strategy which in any case allows them to stay afloat at least. For how much longer, good question...

2016...a little modernity wouldn't hurt, on the contrary, but that doesn't seem to worry them that much. Right or wrong...

2019...they are ending their 6th decade of career here which is no small thing, that's clear and there is a strong chance that we will see them again the following decade...

2019...in any case, nothing seems to slow down their desire to continue the adventure a little further. See them next decade...

2020...as planned, here they are at the start of the 2020 decade with the firm intention of going as far as possible. Good job guys...

2022...so last title or not ? Knowing them there is a good chance that we will find them again later, it remains to be seen with which musical project...
