This monument is located in Madrid's Retiro Park. Jacinto Benavente was a dramatist and won a Nobel prize in 1922. As you can see in the pictures, there is a woman holding the theater mask and on the basis lies Benavente's face. Walking down the Retiro you will see a great range of different sculptures which explain Spanish history. Don't miss it.
