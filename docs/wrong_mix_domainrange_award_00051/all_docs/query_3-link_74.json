        "text": "Federico García Lorca’s plays were written in the 1920s and 1930s, but they are still relevant today.\n\nTeatro Dallas will present a “Homage to Federico García Lorca,” which includes a Cientos de Pájaros te Impiden Andar/A Hundred Birds Prevent you from Walking, an adaption of the Spaniard’s Blood Wedding, Feb. 8-9 and a series of stage readings of Lorca’s poems Feb. 22, 23, 24 and March 1, 2 and 3.\n\nCientos de Pájaros, a one-woman show by Maria Vidal of Santander, Spain, will also be presented Feb. 15-16 by La Casa de España de Houston.\n\nCora Cardona, artistic/managing director for Teatro Dallas, says the tribute to Lorca (above) seemed natural after she discovered Vidal was visiting Texas.\n\n“He’s timeless in that he still has have issues that are relevant today,” she says. “Lorca is definitely one of these writers that speaks to us.”\n\nIn the production, a woman has an affair with a man but her family disapproves of him. She separates from him, and her family arranges for her to marry another man. Then she sees her old lover again – and the story ends in tragedy.\n\nThe play, which takes place in the 1920s and 1930s, brings up several elements Lorca is known for – addressing societal issues that remain relevant today, such as women’s independence and domestic violence, and his use of nature interacting with characters, like the moon and animals talking to the couple.\n\nThe company’s homage to Lorca will continue with a stage reading of his “Romancero Gitano” – which reflects Lorca’s Gypsy background – with local artists.\n\nCardona noted that Lorca lived in a repressive, violent time period in his native country – and his plays seem to be about family when they’re symbolic of his homeland.\n\n“He foresaw the future in many ways, especially when it came to capitalism and social issues,” she says. “It’s amazing he was already thinking about what was happening in the future.”\n\nNote: This article also appeared in a slightly different form on the Theater Jones website.\n\n(Note: The Hispanic Reader is still on hiatus, but I wrote this article for the Theater Jones website, which appeared in a slightly different version. Enjoy the holidays and I’ll see you in January.)\n\n“I had to stay up to read it,” she says. “I immediately connected with it.”\n\nSo much so that Barrera adapted it into the play, Milagritos / little miracles, which the Cara Mía Theatre Co. stages until Dec. 15 at the Latino Cultural Center in Dallas. Cisneros attended the opening night production.\n\nCara Mía is presenting the play, which director David Lozano bills it as a “holiday classic,” for the second time. The title comes from the short story, “Little Miracles, Kept Promises,” in which pilgrims come to a shrine to give thanks to Our Lady of Guadalupe—an iconic Mexican symbol who appeared before peasant Juan Diego on Dec. 12, 1531.\n\n“The characters’ range (of prayers) reflects the diversity of life’s experiences, from problems with pimples to more serious health issues, to lost love and loves that need to get lost,” Barrera says.\n\nBarrera was especially drawn to the lead character, Chayo.\n\n“I found not only myself in her but the Chicanos I was running into,” Barrera says, adding that Cisneros based the characters on folks she knew. “That’s why her works are so relevant. We read them and it’s like, ‘Yes, I know this story, I know this woman.’ ”\n\nLozano agrees.\n\n“Everyone knows these characters from our community,” Lozano says. “I think that’s what grabs people. The more you read it, the more you start peeling away some transformational pieces that become pure poetry.”\n\nThe story illuminates the people beyond the Latino neighborhood and into the Catholic community, he says.\n\n“You talk to Catholic people and they have their miracle story,” he says. “Their prayers are heard.”\n\nEliberto Gonzalez, the president and co-founder of Cara Mía, knew Cisneros and got permission for Cara Mía to present the play when it first ran in 1998. Adapting the book is always full of surprises.\n\n“Cisneros’ works aren’t dramatic narratives, and are more sophisticated than readers realize,” Lozano says. “Most folks will get more of the sense of the everyday quality of these characters and what they live through, while astute readers will recognize the symbolism and poetic quality.”\n\n“Her writing is very complex at times and so when you start really repeating and working through these lyrical imagery, the symbolism of such profound events, you begin [to see] a larger universe that is very real to us,” he says.\n\nBarrera, a Southern Methodist University graduate and a San Antonio-based playwright, director, actress, artist and community arts educator, says Cisneros has seen the play before, and she was supportive.\n\n“I think she really felt the stories and listening to them in that way,” Barrera says. “[She enjoyed] her own work in a way she hadn’t before.”\n\nIf you live in the Dallas area, you can catch Milagritos at 8 p.m., Thursdays-Saturdays, Dec. 1-15 at the Latino Cultural Center, 2600 Live Oak Street, Dallas. Tickets are $12-$30. Go to caramiatheatre.org for details.\n\n“At the Theater” is a feature in which I check out plays by Latino writers. The article is intended to be a look at the author’s work and not a review of the theatrical production – so no comments about acting, lighting or staging. I caught the Dallas Theater Center production of “Chad Deity.”\n\nKristoffer Diaz’s The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity explores the issue of race through an offbeat forum – the wrestling ring.\n\nMacedonia “Mace” Guerra is a Puerto Rican who grew up in the Bronx and now works as a wrestler – but he’s always there to lose. The star is Chad Deity, an Apollo Creed-type character, but without the talent.\n\nVigneshwar Padura, a young, enthusiastic Indian-American, aspires to get into the ring. So the wrestling association’s chief, Everett K. Olson, agrees to let him participate – albeit as a Muslim fundamentalist, complete with a long bushy beard and ammunition on his chest. His opponent is Mace – now billed as Che Chávez Castro.\n\nDeity deals with serious issues in a humorous format. Mace speaks of the frustrations of stereotypes, but he’s more weary than preachy. The show – much of it Mace’s monologue – flows smoothly with good audience interaction.\n\nThe play was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Drama in 2010. It was first produced in Chicago and has been presented in Berkeley, Calif., Boston, New York City, Washington, D.C., and is currently playing in Dallas and Colorado Springs until Nov. 11. This is a play that draws as much reflection as it does laughs. If you get the chance, go see it.\n\nMore about Kristoffer Diaz:\n\nKristoffer Diaz also has written the plays Welcome to Arroyo’s, Guernica, and #therevolution. He won the 2011 New York Times Outstanding Playwright Award.\n\nAmericans will celebrate workers this Labor Day weekend. Two of the Latino community’s most prominent figures – César Chávez and Dolores Huerta – led the farmworkers movement in the 1960s, demanding better conditions for the workers who picked grapes in California. The movement not only had an impact on workers’ rights, but on Latino literature as well.\n\nHere’s a look at some books about Chávez and Huerta, a couple of novels that portray the life of farmworkers, and the story of how the movement gave birth to one of the Hispanic community’s most prominent theaters:\n\nFor children: Children can learn about the movement in Side by Side: The Story of Dolores Huerta and César Chávez by Monica Brown, Harvesting Hope: The Story of César Chávez by Kathleen Krull and Dolores Huerta: A Hero to Migrant Workers, by Sarah Warren.\n\nFor adults: The Words of César Chávez is a book of Chávez’s speeches and writings. It was included in the Library of Congress exhibit, The Books That Shaped America. Delano: The Story of the California Grape Strike, by John Gregory Dunne and Ilan Stavans, is a comprehensive look at the strike, while Cesar Chavez: Autobiography of La Causa by Jacques Levy focuses on Chávez. (A film of Chávez’s life is being made into a movie starring Diego Luna, according to The Los Angeles Times.) The Fight in the Fields by Susan Ferriss and Ricardo Sandoval is the companion to the 1997 PBS documentary of the same title.\n\nFiction: Two of Latino literature’s most acclaimed novels focus on the plight of farmworkers. The 2000 young adult novel Esperanza Rising by Pam Muñoz Ryan depicts a teenager working the fields in the 1920s. The 1996 novel Under the Feet of Jesus by Helena Maria Viramontes tells the story of California farmworkers through the eyes of a 13-year-old worker.\n\nTheater: During the Delano Grape Strike, Luis Valdez began presenting plays on flatbed trucks and union halls. He eventually founded El Teatro Campensino, and went on to write the play and the movie Zoot Suit and the movie La Bamba. He recently talked about his theater’s roots to AARP VIVA radio. (The program is in Spanish.)\n\nLuis Valdez was born June 26 in 1940. He is regarded as the father of Latino theater and the playwright of perhaps the most famous Latino play of all time – Zoot Suit.\n\nA former migrant worker, the California-raised Valdez was inspired to go into theater after a teacher cast him in a school play, according to the San Jose Mercury News. He didn’t perform in the production, but the experience led him to study drama at San Jose State University.\n\nIn the 1960s, he marched with United Farm Workers leader César Chávez. He founded El Teatro Campesino – with shows performed on flatbed trucks and union halls during the Delano Grape Strike.\n\nThe company later moved to San Juan Bautista, Calif. In 1977, the theater performed Zoot Suit, which was inspired by the 1940s riots in Los Angeles. The play was a smash – going on to Broadway in 1979 and becoming a movie, which Valdez directed, in 1981.\n\nValdez also directed the 1987 movie La Bamba, about music great Ritchie Valens. His theater company continues to produce plays today. He recently talked about his career in this radio interview.\n\nUpdate: Quiara Alegría Hudes won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize in Drama for her play, Water by the Spoonful. I also included information on Sonia Nazario, which I forgot about when I first wrote this post until I saw her book in my co-worker’s office and thought, “I can’t believe I forgot Enrique’s Journey!”\n\nThe Pulitzer Prizes, which award the best in journalism and literary arts, will be announced on Monday. While the Nobel Prize in Literature is an international award that honors a lifetime achievement of work, the Pulitzers are an American award that recognizes the previous year’s work in a variety of categories. Here’s a look at some of the past Latino winners:\n\nFiction:\n\n• Only two Hispanics have won this prize: Oscar Hijuelos for 1990’s The Mambo Kings Sing Songs of Love and Junot Díaz, right, for 2008’s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. Hopefully, the committee will consider Francisco Goldman’s Say Her Name, Justin Torres’s We the Animals and Hector Tobar’s The Barbarian Nurseries this year.\n\nDrama:\n\n• Nilo Cruz, left, is the lone Latino playwright to win this honor, for 2003’s Anna in the Tropics. Some writers have come close in recent years – Quiara Alegría Hudes was a finalist for 2007’s Elliot, A Soldier’s Fugue in 2007 and, with Lin-Manuel Miranda, 2009’s In the Heights, as was Kristoffer Diaz for 2010’s The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity.\n\nPoetry:\n\n• William Carlos Williams, right, whose mother was Puerto Rican, appears to be the lone poet with Latino roots to win in the category.\n\nSadly, no Latinos appear to have won in the autobiography, general non-fiction or history categories. Luis Alberto Urrea came close in 2005, when he was a finalist for general non-fiction category for The Devil’s Highway.\n\nJournalism:\n\nLatinos have won in various categories throughout the years – as part of teams covering the Los Angeles riots for The Los Angeles Times in 1992 and the Elian Gonzalez case for The Miami Herald in 2001. Here’s a look at some interesting winners of the past:\n\n• Ruben Vives, left, who came to the United States from Guatemala as an undocumented immigrant and worked his way to become a reporter for The Los Angeles Times, won the award last year for Public Service at age 32.\n\n• Liz Balmaseda of The Miami Herald was the first (and still only) Latino to win in the Commentary category in 1993.\n\n• Sonia Nazario, who was raised in the United States and Argentina, wrote a series of articles for The Los Angeles Times about one boy’s travels from Honduras to the United States that won the 2003 Feature Writing prize and became the book Enrique’s Journey.\n\n• Photographer José Galvez, right, was part of the first team of Latinos to win a Pulitzer when The Los Angeles Times took the 1984 Public Service Prize for its series on Latino life in Southern California. His work can also be seen in Urrea’s book of poems Vatos and other books.\n\nNew releases:\n\n• Several Latino-oriented books are coming out in the next few weeks. Gustavo Arellano explores Americans’ fascination with Mexican food in Taco USA, which will be available this Tuesday. Read an excerpt here.\n\n• Four interweaving stories, from South America to Boston, form the plot of Differential Equations by Julian Iragorri and Lou Aronica, out April 16.\n\n• Dagoberto Gilb’s “Uncle Rock” will be featured in the The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories 2012 anthology, which will be published April 17.\n\n• Julia Alvarez’s new book, A Wedding in Haiti, out April 24, describes her experiences in that country before and after the 2010 earthquake. Also coming out that week is Roberto Bolaño’s The Secret of Evil, a collection of short stories, and Alisa Valdes’ The Temptation, the first in a supernatural trilogy.\n\nAwards:\n\n• Several Latinos were named as finalists in ForeWord Reviews’ Book of the Year contest, honoring books from independent publishers. Lyn DiIorio’s Outside the Bones made the Fiction-Literary list. Sergio Troncoso’s (left) Crossing Borders earned a spot in the Essays category and From This Wicked Patch of Dust made the Fiction-Multicultural list, as did Richard Yañez’s Cross Over Water and Rudolfo Anaya’s Randy Lopez Goes Home.\n\n• Troncoso’s From This Wicked Patch of Dust was also nominated in the Reading the West Book Awards in the Adult Fiction category. Emerita Romero-Anderson was nominated in the children’s category for Milagro of the Spanish Bean Pot.\n\nBook festivals:\n\n• The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, running April 20-21, will feature a plethora of authors, including Gustavo Arellano, Kami Garcia (left),José-Luis Orozco, Héctor Tobar and Luis Alberto Urrea. Rudolfo Anaya will be honored with a lifetime achievement award.\n\nWriting workshops:\n\n• April 15 is the deadline to sign up for the National Latino Writers Conference May 16-19 at the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque. Teachers include Jimmy Santiago Baca, Cristina García and Rigoberto González (right).\n\nOther bits:\n\n• The New York Daily News profiled Aurora Anaya-Cerda’s (right) building of the Latino-oriented La Casa Azul bookstore in East Harlem, slated for a spring opening. Check out her progress on her Facebook page.\n\n• The Daily News also profiled poet Nuyorican poet Bonafide Rojas.\n\n• The Daily Show covered the Arizona ban on Latino-themed books and ethnic studies as only The Daily Show could.\n\n• Publishers Weekly had a nice write-up about Pat Mora’s Día: El día de los niños/El día de los libros, Children’s Day/Book.\n\n• Sergio Troncoso previews his panel, “Latino Literature, Then and Now,” to the Texas Library Association’s annual conference April 17-19 in Houston.\n\n• The Austin American-Statesman featured the Austin Latino New Play Festival."
