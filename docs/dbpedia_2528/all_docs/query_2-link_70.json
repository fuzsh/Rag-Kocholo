        "text": "France’s Monnaie de Paris has released two bullion coins honoring 18th century French composer Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1764). Rameau served as the official composer of the Versailles Court and is best known for his operas and ‘ballet-operas’. He served as the Official composer of the Versailles Court from 1745.\n\nDesigner Christian Lacroix reinterprets on the obverse a feminine costume of the 1740’s, inspired by the Indes Galantes, with a background of the scene of the Royal Opera of Versailles.\n\nThe reverse depicts Rameau in a three-quarter view, similar to his famous portraits of the time, with a typical court wig, symbol of his status at the royal Court. An original background designed by Lacroix evokes Rameau’s talent for composition by stylized patterns of violins. The name of the composer is also written in a decorative hand by Lacroix.\n\nThe release is continuation of the Europa Coin Programme, which is a collector-coin program designed to celebrate European identity. The 2014 theme is famous important composers.\n\nCoin Specifications\n\nAbout Monnaie de Paris\n\nMonnaie de Paris possesses age-old expertise which it employs with great vitality and creativity. Heir to more than twelve centuries of tradition, Monnaie de Paris is responsible for the striking of circulating coins. It also produces collector coins, medals, official decorations and casts works of art. Engraving in metal the designs of many styles and eras, Monnaie de Paris entrusts the conception of its products to the greatest artists, and maintains a constant dialogue with contemporary artistic creation.\n\nMonnaie de Paris is the sole mint entrusted with the task of striking official French euro currency. It also strikes several foreign official currency coins, whether in their entirety (as in the case of Luxembourg, Monaco, and Malta) or in part (as for Greece, Bangladesh, etc.)."
