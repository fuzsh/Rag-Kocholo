UPC: 196288111191.\n\nThis edition presents a suite for soprano recorder and basso continuo compiled from the Symphonies pour les soupers du Roy (Symphonies for the King's Suppers) by Michel-Richard Delalande. It enables you to learn the pieces systematically and at three different tempi with professional accompaniments. The recordings begin with the concert version of each piece, following which you will hear the harpsichord accompaniment at slow and medium tempo to help you practise. Having mastered these slower versions, you'll now be ready to play with continuo accompaniment at the original tempo. All of the versions were recorded live.\n\n$24.99 - See more - Buy online\n\nPre-shipment lead time: 2 to 3 weeks\n\nLes fontaines de Versailles\n\nBrass Quintet: 2 trumpets, horn, trombone, tuba\n\nBVD Press\n\nBy Michel-Richard de Lalande (1657-1726).

Text language: Latin.\n\nIn his roles as Music Director at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris and in the Royal Choir [chapel] of Louis XV, Andre Campra (1660-1744) composed numerous motets which frequently displayed the influence of contemporary opera. If today Campra is known almost exclusively for his famous Requiem, nevertheless his more than forty motets composed for soli, choir and orchestra are still awaiting discovery. Among these is a setting of Psalm 129, De profundis, published here in a new critical edition after the autograph score. The work was composed in 1723 during the first months of Campra's service to the French king and it proves to be the equal to the compositions of Michel-Richard de Lalande, who during his lifetime shaped and dominated the genre of the Grand Motet..\n\n$41.95 - See more - Buy online\n\nPre-shipment lead time: 2 to 3 weeks\n\nDe profundis\n\nCarus Verlag\n\nSoli ST(A)TBar, ST(A)TBarB choir, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 violins, 2 violas, basso ...(+)\n\nSoli ST(A)TBar, ST(A)TBarB choir, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 violins, 2 violas, basso continuo\n\nSKU: CA.2103011\n\nPsalm 129.
