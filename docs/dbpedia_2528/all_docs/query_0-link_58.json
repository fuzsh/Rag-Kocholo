The symphony was one of the most popular during Haydn's lifetime and its ominous, almost continuous F minor intensity and arresting dynamism still make an impact today.\n\n10.15am New Releases\n\nErnst von DohnÃ¡nyi: Concertos - Variations On A Nursery Song\n\nSofja Gulbadamova (piano)\n\nSilke Aichhorn (harp)\n\nAndrei IoniÅ£Ä (cello)\n\nDeutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rehinland-Pfalz\n\nModestas Pitrenas (conductor)\n\nCapriccio C5463\n\nhttp://capriccio.at/ernst-von-dohnanyi-concerti\n\nPeter Maxwell Davies: Eight Songs for a Mad King\n\nKelvin Thomas (baritone)\n\nPsappha\n\nNMC PSA1007\n\nhttps://nmc-recordings.myshopify.com/collections/new-releases-2022/products/peter-maxwell-davies-eight-songs-for-a-mad-king\n\n10.40am Leah Broad on Paavo Berglundâs Complete Sibelius Symphonies\n\nLeah Broad reviews never-before-released DVDs of the complete Sibelius symphonies with Paavo Berglund conducting the Chamber Orchestra of Europe.\n\nSibelius: The Complete Symphonies\n\nChamber Orchestra of Europe\n\nPaavo Berglund (conductor)\n\nICA Classics ICAD5163 (Blu-ray & DVD)\n\nhttps://icaclassics.com/releases/chamber-orchestra-of-europe-sibelius-the-complete-symphonies\n\n11.20am Record of the Week\n\nBach: Cantatas Nos 35 & 169; Buxtehude & SchÃ¼tz\n\nIestyn Davies (counter-tenor)\n\nCarolyn Sampson (soprano)\n\nJohn Mark Ainsley (tenor)\n\nNeal Davies (bass)\n\nArcangelo\n\nJonathan Cohen (director)\n\nHyperion CDA68375\n\nhttps://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dc.asp?dc=D_CDA68375\n\nSAT 11:45 Music Matters (m001474b)\n\nHolding onto Musical Traditions\n\nSara Mohr-Pietsch talks to Ruth Slenczynska, the last living pupil of Rachmaninoff, from her home in Pennsylvania ahead of releasing a brand new solo piano album entitled My Life in Music. She reminisces about her childhood as a prodigy, connecting with her audiences, and performing still in her ninth decade.\n\nThe writer, musician and composer Richard Thomas, and contemporary BAFTA and multi award-winning artist, photographer and filmmaker Alison Jackson, join Sara to discuss their new collaboration at the Birmingham Rep â The Covid Variations: A Piano Drama â which takes the form of a unique film-and-concert-in-one depicting everyone from Donald Trump to the Royal Family, and provides an imaginary glimpse into the lived experience of celebrities during the pandemic.\n\nAs Mali's military leaders expel the French ambassador for comments made by the French foreign minister about the transitional government, ethnomusicologist Lucy Duran and the BBCâs reporter Lalla Sy explain more about the fragile situation inside the former French colony following the imposition of sanctions by the Economic Community of West African States. We hear, too, from Malian musicians including the singer and guitarist Vieux Farka TourÃ©, the balafon virtuoso FodÃ© Lassana DiabatÃ©, and kora player BallakÃ© Sissoko, as they describe how years of civil war, military coups, and insurgencies by Islamist militants are collectively impacting music making in the country.\n\nAnd, as we celebrate the centenary of the publishing of James Joyceâs modernist masterpiece, Ulysees, scholar Katherine OâCallaghan explains the musical references which litter the work and how music inform Joyceâs language, while the composer Betsy Jolas remembers accompanying James Joyce at the piano as he sang.\n\nSAT 12:30 This Classical Life (m000xsfz)\n\nJess Gillam with...

Mahan reveals recordings that made him re-evaluate his feelings towards Brahms and Handel, is thrilled by the musicianship of Maria Callas and happily goes on record to say that pianists should not feel guilty about playing Bach on the piano. Providing they play well...\n\nThe harpsichord makes an appearance in the hands of one of the greatest players of the 20th century, Ralph Kirkpatrick, and Mahan is inspired by a new recording by a young Iranian pianist that allows him to hear music by Schoenberg in a whole new way.\n\nA series in which each week a musician explores a selection of music - from the inside.\n\nA Tandem Production for BBC Radio 3\n\n01 00:05:31 Hector Berlioz\n\nHarold in Italie - III - Serenade\n\nPerformer: Jennifer Stumm\n\nPerformer: Elizabeth Pridgen\n\nMusic Arranger: Franz Liszt\n\nDuration 00:06:25\n\n02 00:14:00 Taraf de HaÃ¯douks\n\nGreen Leaf, Clover Leaf\n\nDuration 00:03:54\n\n03 00:19:44 Domenico Scarlatti\n\nSonata in G K454 and K455\n\nPerformer: Ralph Kirkpatrick\n\nDuration 00:06:04\n\n04 00:32:13 Johannes Brahms\n\nPiano Concerto No. 2, Op. 83 - IV - Allegretto grazioso\n\nPerformer: Adam Laloum\n\nOrchestra: Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra\n\nConductor: Kazuki Yamada\n\nDuration 00:09:38\n\n05 00:43:50 Guillaume Dufay\n\nNuper rosarum flores\n\nEnsemble: Cantica Symphonia\n\nDuration 00:06:42\n\n06 00:52:35 George Frideric Handel\n\nSonata in D - IV - Allegro\n\nPerformer: Gerhard Taschner\n\nPerformer: Cor de Groot\n\nDuration 00:02:38\n\n07 00:57:26 Arnold Schoenberg\n\nSuite for Piano, Op. 25 - V - Gigue\n\nPerformer: Arash Rokni\n\nDuration 00:02:52\n\n08 01:01:49 Johann Christian Bach\n\nSymphony in G minor, Op. 6 No. 6\n\nEnsemble: Concerto KÃ¶ln\n\nDuration 00:13:23\n\n09 01:17:01 Duke Ellington (artist)\n\nFleurette Africaine\n\nPerformer: Duke Ellington\n\nPerformer: Charles Mingus\n\nPerformer: Max Roach\n\nDuration 00:03:35\n\n10 01:22:12 Fatemer Vaezi Parisa\n\nSaz-o-Avaz II\n\nPerformer: Fatemer Vaezi Parisa\n\nDuration 00:04:22\n\n11 01:28:26 Johann Sebastian Bach\n\nContrapunctus VIII & Contrapunctus IX alla duodecima\n\nPerformer: Tatiana Nikolayeva\n\nDuration 00:06:27\n\n12 01:36:42 Gioachino Rossini\n\nArmida: D'amore al dolce impero\n\nSinger: Maria Callas\n\nDuration 00:06:33\n\n13 01:45:02 Franz Schubert\n\nString Quintet in C, D. 956 - Adagio\n\nPerformer: Jennifer Ward Clarke\n\nEnsemble: Chilingirian Quartet\n\nDuration 00:14:32\n\nSAT 15:00 Sound of Gaming (m00147hg)\n\ns/heroes\n\nWith the release of the new action role-playing game 'Horizon Forbidden West', featuring the character Aloy, Louise Blain foregrounds music for games where women take the lead.

Here he plays music from his latest releases, Crisis & Opportunity. Vols 1 and 2, blending jazz, hip-hop, dance music and more.\n\nAlso in the programme, we hear from BBC Jazz Award-winning and Mercury-nominated pianist and organist Kit Downes ahead of the release of his new trio album, Vermillion, on ECM Records. Kit shares some of the music that has inspired and shaped his playing, including a dream-like, experimental jazz track by Swedish saxophonist Otis SandsjÃ¶.\n\nProduced by Thomas Rees for Somethinâ Else.\n\nSAT 18:30 Opera on 3 (m00147hn)\n\nMozart's Don Giovanni\n\nThrough some of his greatest and most memorable music, Mozart's Don Giovanni tells the tale of the man who stops at nothing to get what he wants. 'It doesn't matter if she's rich, ugly or beautiful; if she wears a skirt, you know what he does,' sings his sidekick Leporello in the famous Catalogue aria. And he's done it with 2065 of them, leaving a trail of broken promises and wrecked lives throughout Europe. But in the 24 hours portrayed here, the tally stubbornly fails to increase (despite his best efforts) and Don Giovanni at last comes up against something he can't evade, dupe or kill...\n\nTeodor Currentzis is one of today's most compelling period performance conductors and in this Salzburg Festival Don Giovanni, when he led a mainly young cast and his own, hand-picked musicAeterna Chorus and Orchestra, the results thrilled audiences and critics.\n\nIntroduced by Tom Service.\n\nAct 1\n\n8.15 pm\n\nInterval\n\nThe behavioural indicators for antisocial personality disorder on the NHS website appear very precisely to describe the principal characteristics of Don Giovanni. For example: 'A person with antisocial personality disorder may: exploit, manipulate or violate the rights of others; lack concern, regret or remorse about other people's distress; behave irresponsibly and show disregard for normal social behaviour; have difficulty sustaining long-term relationships; lack guilt, or not learn from their mistakes'.\n\nSo, is Don Giovanni a psychopath? Tom puts the question to Sir Simon Wessely, Regius Professor of Psychiatry at King's College London.\n\n8.30 pm\n\nAct 2\n\nDon Giovanni â¦.. Davide Luciano (bass-baritone)\n\nLeporello â¦..
