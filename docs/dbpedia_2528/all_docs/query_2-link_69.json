        "text": "Prelude. (CHWM 263)\n\nBetween 1720 and 1750, Baroque music competed with a simpler, more songful style. Antonio Vivaldi, Francois Couperin, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Johann Sebastian Bach, and George Frideric Handel synthesize Baroque trends in Italy, France, Germany, and England.\n\nI. Italy: Antonio Vivaldi and the Concerto (CHWM 263–70, NAWM 93)\n\nAlthough Venice was declining in power at the beginning of the eighteenth century, it still had a lively musical culture.\n\nVenice\n\nVenice was home to all types of professional and amateur music-making, including public festivals, opera, church music, and chamber music.\n\nOspedali\n\nVenice nurtured institutions like the Pio Ospedale della Pietà, a home and school for orphaned and abandoned girls, which became a famous musical center.\n\nInstrumental concerto\n\nThe instrumental concerto was a new genre that emerged in the 1680s and 1690s and became the most important type of Baroque instrumental music.\n\nTypes of concerto\n\nIn the orchestral concerto, the first violin part and bass dominated, and the texture was less contrapuntal than in the sonata. More important were the concerto grosso, which contrasted a small ensemble (or concertino) with a large ensemble (or concerto grosso, ripieno, or tutti), and the solo concerto, in which a solo instrument contrasted with the orchestra.\n\nGiuseppe Torelli\n\nGiuseppe Torelli (1658–1709) was a leading composer in the Bologna school.\n\nThree-movement structure\n\nTorelli helped to codify the concerto as a work in three movements in the pattern fast–slow–fast.\n\nRitornello form\n\nFor the fast movements of his violin concertos, Torelli often used a form like the A section of a da capo aria, in which two passages for a soloist are framed by a recurring ritornello.\n\nBiography: Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741)\n\nAntonio Vivaldi was born in Venice and trained for both music and the priesthood. As music teacher (and later a director of concerts) at the Pio Ospedale della Pietà, he composed oratorios, sacred music, and concertos. He also received opera commissions from Venice and elsewhere. He earned a great fortune during his career, but spent almost all of it.\n\nAntonio Vivaldi\n\nVivaldi was the best-known Italian composer of the early eighteenth century and is known today primarily for his concertos.\n\nThe Pietà\n\nBetween 1703 and 1740, Vivaldi worked at the Pietà, where he taught, composed, conducted, and maintained instruments.\n\nVivaldi’s concertos\n\nIn his concertos, Vivaldi used a simple but flexible plan that allowed him to achieve variety through ever-changing combinations of a few basic elements.\n\nVivaldi’s orchestra\n\nVivaldi used different groupings of solo and orchestral instruments to achieve a wide range of colors and sonorities in his concertos.\n\nInstrumentation of the concertos\n\nMost of Vivaldi’s concertos feature opposition between soloist(s) and orchestra.\n\nExpanded ritornello form\n\nVivaldi used ritornello form for the fast movements in his concertos. In this form, the full orchestra plays the ritornellos, and the soloist(s) play the episodes. The opening ritornello is composed of several small units, and later ritornellos usually include only a few of those units. The opening and closing ritornellos are in the tonic, and the others confirm the keys to which the music modulates during the virtuosic and idiomatic solo episodes. Music: NAWM 93\n\nSlow movement\n\nVivaldi was the first concerto composer to make slow movements as important as fast ones.\n\nEconomy and variety\n\nAlthough Vivaldi created long movements from a small amount of musical material, his concertos exhibit great variety and range of expression.\n\nPublications, titles, and programs\n\nVivaldi wrote some concertos on commission and earned money through publications. To attract buyers, many concertos were printed with fanciful titles and programs.\n\nRange of styles\n\nVivaldi’s music reflects a variety of styles of the early eighteenth century.\n\nII. France: Couperin and Rameau (CHWM 270–75, NAWM 94–95)\n\nParis was the musical capital of France, with public concerts, private patrons, and institutions supporting musicians and composers.\n\nReconciling French and Italian styles\n\nIn the early eighteenth century, the relative merits of French and Italian music were constantly debated, and some composers blended the two styles.\n\nFrançois Couperin\n\nAlthough he worked for royalty, Francois Couperin (1668–1733) earned most of his money teaching aristocrats and composing.\n\nSuites\n\nCouperin wrote harpsichord suites (ordres) for amateur performers. Music: NAWM 94\n\nChamber works\n\nCouperin blended French and Italian styles in his chamber music.\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau (1683–1764) was both a theorist who founded the theory of tonal music and a composer who was Lully’s most important successor.\n\nBiography: Jean-Philippe Rameau\n\nRameau was forty years old when he earned his first fame with his theoretical treatise on harmony (Traité de l’harmonie, 1722). His compositions took longer to be recognized, and in the 1730s, he wrote his first opera. Wealthy and influential patrons supported Rameau, who despite his late start composed more ballets and operas than any other French composer of the eighteenth century.\n\nLa Pouplinière\n\nRameau achieved his greatest fame after being hired as organist, conductor, and composer-in-residence to Alexandre-Jean-Joseph le Riche de la Pouplinière.\n\nOperas\n\nRameau attained his greatest fame from his operas, including Hippolyte et Aricie (1733) and Castor et Pollux (1737).\n\nLullistes versus Ramistes\n\nLully’s supporters, known as the Lullistes, criticized Rameau’s early operas for their difficulty. Rameau was defended by the Ramistes.\n\nComparison with Lully\n\nRameau’s theater works resembled Lully’s in several ways, but they also introduced many changes.\n\nMelodic and harmonic style\n\nRameau’s melodies are often triadic, outlining harmonies, which he drew from a rich palette of chords.\n\nInstrumental music\n\nThe instrumental passages of Rameau’s operas were especially original, with tone painting, novel orchestration, and independent woodwind parts.\n\nA Closer Look: Rameau’s Theories\n\nBecause he derived the basic principles of harmony from the laws of acoustics, Rameau considered the chord the primal element in music. He asserted that the fundamental bass defined the harmony of a passage. He also coined the terms tonic, dominant, and subdominant and formulated the hierarchies of functional tonality. He recognized a modulation as the change in function of a chord.\n\nAirs and choruses\n\nRameau moved smoothly between recitative and aria styles and frequently included choruses.\n\nHippolyte et Aricie\n\nThe conclusion of Act IV from Hippolyte et Aricie illustrates the high drama Rameau could achieve. Music: NAWM 95\n\nRameau as theorist\n\nRameau’s Traité de l’harmonie was one of the most influential theoretical works ever written, and it became the primary tool for teaching harmony.\n\nIII. Germany: Johann Sebastian Bach (CHWM 275–89, NAWM 96–98)\n\nIn the eighteenth century, composers from German-speaking lands rose to prominence by combining the best traits of music from several nations, including Italy, France, and Germany.\n\nGerman patrons\n\nStates, principalities, and independent cities in German-speaking central Europe supported music. As a working musician in Lutheran Germany, Bach composed to meet the demands of the positions he held, to satisfy patrons, to please and edify fellow citizens, and to glorify God.\n\nBiography: Johann Sebastian Bach\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) was born in Eisenach and came from a large family of musicians. He was a virtuoso organist and keyboard player, and his first positions were as church organist at Arnstadt and Mühlhausen, where he also taught private students in performance and composition. Bach worked his way up the career ladder, serving as organist and then concertmaster in Weimar and later as music director at Cöthen. At Leipzig, he held one of the most prestigious positions in Germany as cantor of the Saint Thomas School and civic music director.\n\nCities where Bach worked\n\nBach composed in every genre of his time, except opera, to meet the demands of his patrons in different cities throughout Germany.\n\nBach at Arnstadt, Mühlhausen, and Weimar: The Organ Works\n\nMost of Bach’s earliest works were for organ, and as church organist, Bach focused on genres employed in Lutheran services.\n\nPreludes and fugues\n\nLike other composers in this period, Bach frequently prefaced fugues with separate preludes, toccatas, or fantasias.\n\nVivaldi’s influence\n\nAt Weimar, Bach arranged Vivaldi’s concertos for keyboard and adopted ritornello form and other traits of Vivaldi’s music in his own works. The form of his fugues resembles ritornello form, with the fugue subject functioning like a ritornello. Music: NAWM 96\n\nChorale settings\n\nIn Bach’s Orgelbüchlein (Little Organ Book), compiled in Weimar, each chorale is stated once, accompanied with counterpoint or embellished through a variety of compositional techniques. In some preludes, images in the chorale texts are suggested through the use of musical figures. Music: NAWM 97\n\nBach at Cóthen and Leipzig: The Harpsichord Music\n\nBach wrote harpsichord music in every contemporary genre.\n\nThe Well-Tempered Clavier\n\nEach of the two books of The Well-Tempered Clavier (1722 and ca. 1740) consists of twenty-four prelude and fugue pairs, one in each major and minor key.\n\nA Closer Look: The Well-Tempered Clavier\n\nThe pieces in Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier could be played on different types of keyboard instruments, and Bach left the choice of instrument to the performer. The term \"well tempered\" refers to the keyboard’s tuning, in which all semitones are nearly equal in size, making it possible to move from one key to another without sounding out of tune.\n\nPedagogical aims\n\nEach prelude assigns the player a specific technical task and illustrates different types of keyboard performance conventions and compositional practices, while the fugues use an array of fugal writing techniques.\n\nSuites\n\nBach’s harpsichord suites show French, Italian, and German influences.\n\nGoldberg Variations\n\nIn his Goldberg Variations, Bach used a variety of techniques, such as canon, fugue, and quodlibet.\n\nBach at the Princely Court of Cöthen: Solo and Ensemble Music\n\nAt Cöthen, Bach wrote works for unaccompanied violin, cello, and flute in which he created the illusion of a harmonic and contrapuntal texture.\n\nThe orchestral suite\n\nBetween about 1690 and 1740, German composers wrote a new type of orchestral suite with dances patterned on those from Lully’s ballets and operas.\n\nBrandenburg Concertos\n\nBach’s six Brandenburg Concertos, dedicated to the margrave of Brandenburg in 1721, follow Italian models but expand upon Italian forms.\n\nCollegium musicum\n\nMost of Bach’s other orchestral music, including concertos and suites, was written in the 1730s for the Leipzig collegium musicum.\n\nOther instrumental works\n\nA Musical Offering contains a collection of pieces on a theme by Frederick the Great of Prussia, and The Art of Fugue systematically demonstrates all types of fugal writing.\n\nBach at Leipzig: The Vocal Music\n\nIn Leipzig, Bach had multiple duties, including teaching Latin and music at the school and composing and rehearsing music for services in the main churches. Lutheran services contained many types of music.\n\nChurch cantatas\n\nThe church cantata was performed during the Lutheran service after the Gospel reading and acted as a type of musical sermon or as an interpretation of the reading. Bach composed at least four complete annual cantata cycles, often reworking his earlier works for new uses.\n\nChorale cantatas\n\nBach’s cantata, Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BMV 62, is typical of Bach’s cantatas with its opening and closing choruses and middle movements for soloists. Music: NAWM 98\n\nOpening chorus\n\nThe opening chorus of Bach’s cantata Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland mixes the genres of concerto and chorale motet.\n\nSolo movements\n\nThe four solo movements of Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland employ operatic idioms.\n\nPassions\n\nFor the St. John Passion and the St. Matthew Passion, Bach drew on elements from opera, cantata, and oratorio to recount the story of Jesus’s death. These works were performed at Good Friday services, most likely with a small chorus and instrumental ensemble.\n\nMass in B Minor\n\nBach assembled his Mass in B Minor from existing works and newly composed movements. He employed contrasting styles and demonstrated different current approaches to writing church music.\n\nReception History\n\nOnly a few of Bach’s works were published during his life.\n\nChanging tastes\n\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century, some people considered Bach’s music old-fashioned and difficult.\n\nBach’s influence\n\nMusicians and connoisseurs kept Bach’s music alive through their study of his works. In the nineteenth century, his life and works were rediscovered and became widely known, his reputation soared, and today he is considered one of the central composers of Western music.\n\nIV. England: George Frideric Handel (CHWM 289–300, NAWM 99–100)\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel (1685–1759) won international renown and success with the public during his lifetime, and his music has been performed ever since.\n\nPopularity\n\nHandel’s popularity stemmed from his adaptability while working for the public.\n\nBiography: George Frideric Handel [Georg Friedrich Händel]\n\nHandel was born in Germany where he studied the music of German and Italian composers. In 1703, he moved to Hamburg, played in an opera orchestra, and composed his first opera. He traveled to Italy where he associated with the leading patrons and musicians. Handel’s greatest successes came in London, where he served aristocratic and royal patrons, as well as the public. Although he wrote many instrumental works, Handel is best known for his Italian operas and English oratorios.\n\nPatrons\n\nHandel enjoyed generous support from patrons, particularly British monarchs who granted him sizable pensions. Most of his musical activities, however, were for public audiences."
