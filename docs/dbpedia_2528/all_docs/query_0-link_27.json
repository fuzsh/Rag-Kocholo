Comparisons and conclusions attained through collation of the two preceding chapters (IV and V) are presented in Chapter VI. To facilitate interpretation of all the ornaments found in this music, Appendix B has been added*\n\nHowever,\n\nsince application of the \"’ principles\" is quite a complex problem\n\nIf in itself, the agrements as found on two of Lalandefs \"Grand Motets’* have been illustrated in footnotes to further exem­ plify their use:\n\n(1) Judica Me Deus, Volume II, pp. 121-172\n\nand Deus Noster. Volume II, pp. 173-232. Similarly, the organ continuo realization in both these \"Grand Motets\" is this writer1s interpretation as are also the orchestral parts of remplissage, written in small notes, found in Deus Noster. Since frequent references to the score will be neces­ sary for purposes of illustration, it should be noted that all the transcriptions of this study are contained in Volume II, the pagination of which is in arabic numerals from one to 535*\n\nThe first measure of each brace is numbered in\n\naccordance with the place it occupies within a \"movement\" of the motet.\n\nIn the sequence of musical \"forms,\" each starts\n\nanew with the number one. References to the\n\nscore will follow two abbreviated\n\npatterns: II:2)^:3 or II:pp.6-9.\n\nIn the former, the Roman\n\nnumeral indicates the volume number; the first arabic numeral the page number; and the second arabic numeral the measure number.\n\nThus the preceding example should be interpreted as\n\nvolume two, page twenty-four, measure three.\n\nIn the latter\n\nexample, only the volume\n\nnumber and the pages are indicated:\n\nvolume two, pages six to\n\nnine.\n\nf>'J y JHt’irnjf,\n\n>/• it/iiw , ' A.'y ■ „\n\n'(’\",)/jz\\'hu',/r'c\n\nv)jc\n\nCHAPTER II BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OP MICHEL-RICHARD de LALANDE* Michel-Richard de Lalande, the fifteenth child of a poor tailor, was born in Paris, December 15>, 165>7» and died at Versailles, June 18, 1726.2 In his extreme youth, he showed unusual talents for\n\n* Unless definitely stated to the contrary, the infor­ mation for this biographical sketch has been taken from one of two sources: (a) Tannevot, Preface ou discours sur la vie et les ouvrages de M. de La Lande (ParTss Ballard, 1729T. pp.”T8, and (b) Hugo Riemann, \"Lalande, Michel-Richard de,ft Dictionnaire de Musique (Paris: Payot, 1931)* In the latter source, it is necessary to question the last statement contained In the article: f,Une etude complete de la vie de Lalande est actuellement pre'paree par A. Tessier. Through direct correspondence with persons who knew Tessier personally (Alexander Cellier, Paul Brunold, and Paul-Marie Masson) I have learned that this task remained unfinished at his death (1931)* According to Masson, the information con­ tained in Riemann represents the totality of information Tes­ sier had accrued in his incomplete study of Lalande. Brunold, who possesses Tessier1s notebook, has informed me that it con­ tains no additional material on Michel. The ifloge sur M. de Lalande by the Countess de Salmdyck located at the Brussels Conservatory, is on Joseph-Jerome Lefrancois de Lalande and not Michel-Richard; although, it ap­ parently is catalogued under the latter name. Another slightly confusing biographical problem is pre­ sented by Oscar Thompson in The International Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians. Two articles (f\n\nand Sermisy, which are\n\nThe language, except for the various Masses,\n\nis always French, and no instrumental accompaniment of any kind is indicated*\n\nThere are no multiple choirs, a specialty\n\nof the Venetian school and particularly of its leader, G a b r i e l i , 2lj- although examples were not entirely lacking in\n\nFrance during the mid-sixteenth century as the works of Dominicus Phinot attest*25 Burney's lament, upon his failure to find Du Caurroy's music comparable to that of Claude le Jeune as the former's reputation had led him to expect, is most revealing about still another perhaps more important aspech\n\n2k See C. von Winterfield, Johannes Gabrieli und sein Zeitalter (Berlin: Schlesinger*schen Buch-und Musikhandlung, , Vol. 3, Canticas Sacras Numbers 1-5, pp* 1-18; ffAlle­ luia,” p. 7 3 ; motet Salvator Noster, p. 127; and Ego Sum Tui, p. 139• Choirs of either four or five voices are used both in isolation and as antiphonal bodies. When the choirs unite for climaxes, however, each part remains 11real . 11 That is, the two choirs do not double each other and thus form only one real choir, the procedure which became traditional in the French school*\n\n25\n\nHugo Leichtentritt,\n\nojd.\n\ncit., pp* 380-81*\n\n30 I have scored one of his canons which is given as a miraculous effort of genius and said to be in six parts, though three of them are mere remplissage, that have nothing to do with the subject, and ± find it miserable . 26 It cannot be assumed that Du Caurroy would have U3ed the word remplissage,27 but the fact that the music contained such a part at this early date is extremely important. fortunately,\n\nUn­\n\nthe canon whereof Burney speaks cannot be iden­\n\ntified, and, necessarily, the date is unknown, but, since the composer died in 1 6 0 9 * it represents one of the earliest, if not the earliest, such concepts in the history of comparable music. Upon the death of Du Caurroy in 1 6 0 9 , Nicolas Form^ ( 1 5 6 7 - 1 6 3 8 ) occupied the position of master of music.\n\nIt is\n\nto him that the credit is usually given for first having pre­ sented in France (c. l6l0) the model of the motet with con­ trasting choirs,28 one of which consisted of soloists, the\n\n26 Charles Burney, A General History of Music (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1933)> P* 230• Burney also describes Du Caurroy*s No£l, in Renais­ sance motet form, as ,fdry and destitute of ideas •,f pp. 2 3 1 32.\n\n27 Parts of little or no contrapuntal or thematic interest used to f,filln or complete the harmony and sonority.

Am^d^e Gastoue cites Victoria1s religious music for two or three choirs which were opposed to a quartet of solo voices— a direct parallel to the double choir usage o f the French school.\n\nHe also indicates somewhat comparable examples,\n\ngiving Praetorius\n\nas his source, of contrasts attained by\n\nLassus through the alternation of two choirs, one of which was a cappella and the other accompanied by instruments.\n\nThe\n\nchoirs were not in different locations as was customary in the Venetian practice.31 Another somewhat later but similar application of\n\n29 Gastoue, loc. cit., and Prunieres, loc. cit., and Henri Quittard, \"Henry Du M o n t ,” La Tribune de Saint-Gervais, 6:182-87, June, 1905. 30 Hugo Leichtentritt draws an analogy to the concerto grosso style, o£. cit., pp. 3 8 2 and 4-3 0 . 31\n\nGastoue, ojd. cit., pp. 3015-4-5*\n\ndouble choirs is found in the Psalms of Schiitz*32\n\nit is\n\nnotable that he recommended for performance both the regular choir for volume and splendor (called capelle) and another choir called cori favoriti (soloists)* Returning to the French scene and FormC, we find that only three of his compositions are extant,33 and, of those available, only one is a motet*\n\nFrom these, however, it is\n\npossible to make certain reasonably accurate deductions* The style is hybrid* tical block harmony*\n\nPolyphony alternates with ver­\n\nWhen the choirs unite, they usually\n\nbecome one real choir of from four to six parts, five and six being the most frequent,\n\nrather than two choirs of four\n\nvoices each or eight real voices*\n\nMeter changes are some­\n\nwhat frequent but usually coincide with major divisions or principal cadences of the composition.34\n\nThe score contains\n\n•3^ fsalmen Davids sampt etlichem Moteten und Concerten, mit acht und mehr Stimmen • . • with basso continuo for organ, lute, and chitarone.

Historians generally describe a stylistic difference between the \"Petit choir™ of soloists and the \"Grand choir, \"35 but in the examples of Forme the technical demands of both choral groups are quite parallel. Example 2, an excerpt from Formers Mass, illustrates his general style. Finally, it should be noted that the \"Grand choirs\" of the Agnus Dei (from the Mass) and of Ecce tu pulchra es arnica mea (the motet)\n\nare written for five real\n\nv o i c e s ,\n\n36 a prac­\n\ntice which remained conventional with later motet composers as the music Appendices to this study amply illustrate. Michel Brenet, in a general sense, aptly characterizes 35\n\nL o c . cit.\n\n36 It is not to be ass'umed that Forme invented the five voice choir. Consider the following statement by Eugene Borrel: \"On attribue parfois & Formd' l 1invention de choeur h 5 voix, ce qui est inexact, puisque les deux seules h qui restent de lui sont a if. voix. £lj Mais je vous signale que Moulinie use du choeur & 5 voix (2 Sop., Alto, Tenor et Basse) avec basse continue et sans orchestre: et Jean de Bournonville en 1612, ecrive du Magnificat a 5 voix et des Messes a 5 et 6 voix, sans orchestre .11 Taken from a personal letter to the writer, June 19> 1949* More than ample evidence of the frequent occurrence of five voice choirs in sixteenth century motets can be seen by examination of Attaingnant1s third volmie.

Both quote Mersenne #10 ranked Bouzignac with BoSsset and Fremart*\n\n36 His motets,\n\nvarying from three to seven voices and void of\n\nindications for continuo,40 alternate between the polyphonic and the vertical style,4l and they include music ranging from solos to double choirs* By preference, he emphasized melody^-2 (possibly the result of the vogue for the nair de cour”), but, quite anti­ thetically, at times he showed a marked leaning toward the dramatic style of the Histoires Sacrees of Carissimi with whom he had studied*43 Leichtentritt summarizes thusly: His motets are neither church pieces in the a cappella style of the sixteenth century, nor have they the least in common with the accompanied monodic style of the seven­ teenth century. His writing is between both styles. He knows neither general bassq-5 nor instrumental accompani­ ment, but his choral compositions have in addition to contrapuntal elegance a songlike quality, a perfection of form which reminds one greatly of arias with ritournelles, and finally a dramatic animation much as in opera. He is fond of juxtaposing voices in dialogue— like question and answer— and chooses his texts deliberately so as to apply such dialogue* A resemblance to the *concerto da chiesa* in such compositions cannot be d e n i e d * ^\n\nk-0\n\nCombarieu, loc. cit.\n\nh-l Henri Quittard, September, 19^4 * P* 2?6*\n\nCf. post, footnote 6 3 *\n\n’’Henry du Mont,” o£. cit., August-\n\n^ Henri Quittard, ”U n Musician Oublie du XVIIe Siecle Franyais: G-.

It is altogether possible that this \"wide b a s s ” refers to a customary practice found in the air de cour. Pauline Alderman describes it as follows. \"Striking, to the casual observer, is the frequent en­ trance of soprano and bass voices together, a device common in most of the airs of the time set in four and five parts. Quite naturally the question is asked, was this bass part really sung or was it a sort of continuo for the lute? Or was it in­ tended to be played by the gamba?

Such practices did not emanate through an esthetic desire for such. Rather was the use of instruments primarily developed because the organ was often awkwardly located in the tribune at a distance from the choir. If the church was for­ tunate enough to own a portative organ, it was often used. Even the clavecin was frequently employed, in Italy particular ly, in default of the organ or other instruments. In practice the violes were most often used.\n\nSuch was the practice with the ”air de cour.”\n\nTherefore, it\n\nis quite logical to assume the application of this popular technique to other music• According to Champigneulle, AntoineBoSsset might possibly be the originator, in Prance, of the solo motet with continuo.62\n\nHe, with his contemporaries and successors\n\n(Bouzignac,&3 Pechon, Moulinie,64- Veillot, G-obert, and Du Mont), were responsible for the adoption and application of the new idiom to the ”Grand Motet*”65 Although the origins\n\nof continuo accompaniment to\n\nthese motets may well remain shrouded in obscurity,\n\n62\n\nChampigneulle, o p . cit., p. 8 7 •\n\n63\n\nCf. ante, pp. 11-12.\n\nthe de-\n\n6^- Etienne Moulinie, the man intended here, was a singer.

The Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris possesses a series of manuscripts (Vm7 1171) written by Bouzignac (see footnote 6 3 ), Bo&sset, Pechon, Moulinie, Du Mont, and others. In the cases of all the afore-mentioned men, there are examples writ­ ten with continuo, but Quittard makes no mention of any addi­ tional instruments. Thus, the introduction of the continuo cannot be as­ cribed to Du Mont as have done the following: Michel Brenet, Concerts en France (Paris: Pischbacher, 1900), pp. 81-82; Eugene Borrel, L !Interpretation de la Musique Franqaise {Par­ is : Librairie Felix Alcan, l93ip) 9 P* lOij.; Michel Brenet, ”La Musique Sacree sous Louis XIV,” o£. cit., pp. 37-385 and Lionel de La Laurencie, ”Le Motet et la Cantata,” op. cit., p. 15H-7.\n\n\\\n\nil-3\n\nvelopment and growth of an orchestral esthetic is somewhat better known. Certain composers fought the innovat i o n . 66\n\nothers,\n\nless bound by the fetters of tradition, welcomed and experi­ mented with the new idiom and eventually effected its consum­ mation* Even as late as Veillot (c.l6o5-l662) no regular or­ chestra personnel was assigned to the Chapel,\n\nand, since the\n\n\"vingt-quatre violons\" and the \"petite bande\" were so heavily charged with court performances that they could be used for chapel duties only on special occasions, the development of orchestral participation in the motets was necessarily re­ tarded *&7 The introduction of the orchestra into the \"Grand Motet\" was effected neither by Lully (1632-1687) nor by Du Mont (l6l0-l68i|.) as some sources indicate*\n\nRather was it\n\nan innovation, at a considerably earlier date, made by Jean Veillot (c*l6o5-l662), the king*s Chapel\n\nMaster from 161±3\n\n6 6 Auxcousteaux in particular.

The Prunieres edition of Lully!s works contains five \"Grand Motets\" in two volumes.\n\n\\\n\n46 first sacred compositions about l660.\n\nOnly two of his\n\n”Grand Motets” can be dated with certainty: Plaude l aetare, Gallia, composed for the baptism of the Dauphin in 1668, and the Te Deum which was composed in 1677* was written before l661{-; a\n\nA third, Miserere,\n\nfourth, De Profundis, was perform­\n\ned in 1 6 8 3 , but this is not necessarily the tion*\n\ndate of composi­\n\nA fifth, Dies Irae,\n\ncannot be dated.\n\nThus, these motets,\n\ndating from 1 6 6 0 until\n\nab least\n\n1677* provide the chronological link between those by Veillot (d.l662) and those written by Du Mont and Robert between the years 1 6 7 8 and 1 6 8 If*73 Lully, in continuation of the style\n\nof Veillot, con­\n\nstantly doubled the choir parts in the orchestra.\n\nOnly\n\nrarely did he timidly allow the violins to embroider a vocal line in heterophonic style.\n\nThere was no indication of the\n\nfree orchestral counterpoint which was later employed by Du Mont and -which became customary with Lalande.\n\nSuch counter­\n\npoints were not only foreign to the vertical, note-againstnote concept of Lully but also directly antithetical to his 73 Lully’s ”Grand Motets” cannot be ‘indicated as the first which added orchestra. This has been proven by the pre­ ceding. However, a musicologist as recent as Michel Brenet has made this error in ”La Musique Sacree sous Louis XIV,” o p . cit., March-April, 1900. Tribute is due Lully for having introduced the operatic orchestra into the motets (flutes, oboes, trumpets, and kettledrums) • Willi Apel is in gross error when he states that ”Lullvfs motets are still a-cappella for double chorus,” o£. cit., p. I|_6 l •\n\nfavored \"style d*air.\"\n\nOccasionally in a \"symphonie\" he\n\nemployed a quasi-contrapuntal style, but strict entries, answers, and orders were not adhered to* Another of his approaches to counterpoint was the concertante style !!recits,ft and '’duos 11 wherein the instru­ ments dialogued with the voices in s imple imitation.\n\nA\n\ncomparable technique was sometimes employed between the choir and a soloist or between two choirs*\n\nIn either case,\n\nthe writing was largely vertical, and the imitation consisted of juxtaposition and alternation, based upon the melody, or fragments from it that appeared in the highest voices•74In the recitative, metrical changes were omnipresent inasmuch as Lully placed full emphasis upon the declamation. In such Instances, no thought was tendered to the melody proper 9 and musical elements were completely subordinated to the prosody.\n\nThe basso-continuo constituted the customary\n\naccompaniment. Perhaps Lully*s most important contribution to this form was the pompous grandeur with which he endowed it.\n\n7^4- The most contrapuntal of Lully* s \"Grand Motets\" is the Miserere (l662f), the earliest such composition by him. The others, later chronologically, are extremely vertical and harmonic• Similarly, this Miserere is the most chromatic of these works. Some of the dissonances are quite surprising in view of his later diatonic and consonant style.\n\nThese motets, written for double choirs (eight or ten voices) and five part string orchestra (augmented by flutes, oboes, bassoons, trumpets, and kettledrums) required a vast perform­ ing personnel which was in seeming accord with the sumptuous splendor of the court of the \"Roi soleil.\"\n\nThe lavish abun­\n\ndance and diversity of court life compared favorably with this newly-enlarged form, the \"Grand Motet,\" which, in reality, had become a cantata with Latin words*75 In 1663 Du Mont and Robert assumed positions as Chapel Masters to the king*7&\n\nAt this time the music personnel\n\nassigned to the chapel was still quite small, 77 and the occa­ sions demanding the use of the majestic ensembles of the \"Grand Motet\" were relatively infrequent *78 It was not until approximately 1 6 7 8 that the \"royal 75 Lully!s Te Deum comprises 1 6 8 pages, and performing groups either change or alternate ninety-six times* The Miserere is 75 pages, and thirty changes or alternations are required• The extension of the form into a group of varied move­ ments is apparent* Lully took the text verse by verse and presented it in a series of varied compositions* 78 Actually, there were four men: Du Mont, Robert, Gobert, and Expilly* The early retirement of the latter two, in 1 6 6 8 , made their contributions in this era negligible* 77 \". . . en dehors des enfants, vingt-quatre chanteurs, hautes-contre, tallies et basses, dont la moiti§ seulement sont en service simultanement et a qui se joignent vraisemblablement quelques-uns des huit chapelains et des quatre clercs de Chapelle.\" Quittard, \"Henry du Mont,\" op* cit., May-June, 1902, p* 1 7 0 . 78 Motets for one, two, or three voices were customar­ ily used during the Mass*\n\nwill\" quite abruptly expressed interest in hearing many of these pompous and imposing w o rks.79\n\nAlthough there are\n\nmany legends concerning the resistance the monarch met from both Robert and Du Mont, particularly the latter,$0 regard­ ing the constant use of orchestra in their motets, both men, according to the evidence their manuscripts bear, acceded to the royal request .8 1 Robert timidly approached the new task by the simple application of string instruments which doubled the vocal lines, and occasionally attempted a feeble ritournelle.

In this music, the multiple metrical changes, such as those constantly employed b y Lully in complete subservience to prosody, do not\n\nexist.\n\nNew meter signatures occur only\n\n8^4Because of the confusion resulting from the names of these various orchestral parts, the originals have been re­ tained. In general, the lfhaute-contreff and the ’’taille” could be played on either violin or viola.The ’’quinte” is usually written in Alto clef, and its range corresponds to that of the viola. The ’’basse” should not be mistaken for our double-bass. It corresponded to our violon-cello. These names refer simply to \"parts\" and have no definite significance regarding the instruments which play them.\n\n51 at appropriate major divisions of the works.\n\nThis is the\n\nstyle that Lalande adopted, to the complete negation of the Lullian concept,\n\neven in Recits.85\n\nThe numerous major divisions and combinations of vocal and orchestral personnel make it evident that Motets\" had become,\n\nas in the case of\n\nRobert’s \"Grand\n\nLully, Latin cantatas.\n\nThus it is that Leichtentritt considers the form after Du Mont.86 With the appearance of the \"Grand Motets\" of Henry Du M o n t , 87 the form attained those distinctive characteristics\n\nthat constituted the fundament of the genre until the end of the eighteenth c e n t u r y .6 8 The principal instrumental parts, not the \"remplissage,\" customarily received one of two treatments:\n\n(1 ) they\n\ndoubled the voice parts, or (2 ) occasionally they executed\n\n85 The word \"Recit\" should not be confused with the abbreviation commonly used for \"Recitative.\" The former is more properly used in the meaning of \"solo\"; the latter has connotations regarding a specific, declamatory kind of solo. 86\n\nLeichtentritt, op. cit., p. 387* Du Mont died injT 6 8 i|.; Robert lived until 1699*\n\n87 Motets pour la Chapelle du R o y , for double choirs of five voices accompanied by four or five instrumental parts, were published in 1 6 0 I4.* 88 Dufourcq, ojd. cit., p. 206; Jules Combarieu, o p . cit., Vol. II, p. 2q95 Quittard, \"Henry du Mont,\" oj d . cit., November-December, 1901, pp. 299-300 and October-NovemBer, 1905, P» 3k-7; and Andr£ Tessier, \"La Carri^re Versaillaise de Lalande,\" Revue de Musicologie, February, 1928, p. 139«\n\nindependent counterpoints•^9\n\nQuittard characterized the\n\nformer technique, the one that had been frequently employed heretofore in similar works by Veillot and Lully,\n\nas ” . . .\n\nle dernier souvenir de la doublure instrumentale des chanteurs, ordinaire au temps de la polyphonie classique . tf90 The latter treatment of the orchestra was novel in its application to the accompaniment of the choir.\n\nThe first\n\nviolins doubled the soprano line while the second violins per­ formed a counterpoint above the register of the former.91 In some instances, this counterpoint, as in the case of Lully, was little more than heterophony revolving about the Alto or Tenor voice, but, in the violins,\n\nit was performed an octave\n\nhigher.92 89 None of Du M o n t 1s \"Grand Motets” indicate any in­ struments other than strings. In his former motets for one, two, or three performers, Du Mont always carefully indicated the orchestra parts f,si I 1on veut.” No such option is sug­ gested in the scores for the \"Grand Motets.” 90 Quittard, \"Henry du Mont,” 0£. cit., OctoberNovember, 1 9 0 pp. 3^5-46• This should not be construed to indicate that Du Mont was the last to utilize this technique. Reference to the Ap­ pendices will amply illustrate the employment of such devices at much later dates. 9^ Quite in accordance with the concept that the first violins are usually more active than the seconds, the counter­ point eventually passed to the former, and the vocal doubling was assumed by the latter. 92 Quittard, \"Henry du Mont,” o£. cit., OctoberNovember, 1905, p. 3^6* describes it as ” • . • la regie com­ mune des transpositions imposees par la nature et l fetendue de s ins trume nt s .” Violes were employed to play the inner parts of remplissage. To the violins f e l l the lot of passages of contrapuntal importance. Thus, since the violins could not perform in the Alto and Tenor ranges, they were transposed an octave higher.\n\nIn the orchestral Preludes, Du Mont often exposed the thematic material, or fragments from it, of the solo or cho­ rus which followed*\n\nThe style, not particularly typical of\n\nstring instruments, recalls the freely imitative polyphony of the clavecinists of the same e r a *93 It is to Du Mont that credit is due for the reconcil­ iation of polyphony and the new ”harmonic” school in Prance* In his youth he received his training from the masters of Liege who had inherited the polyphonic tradition from Lassus* Upon his arrival in Paris, Du Mont absorbed and incorporated the elements of the \"harmonic” style into his polyphony and thus closely approximated the composite technique of tonal counterpoint*\n\nThis technique persisted throughout his life\n\nand eventually became the heritage of Lalande for whom it formed the stylistic basis in his ”G-rand Motets*” Du M o n t fs thematic material contained, germ, the essence of what he had to say.\n\nat least in\n\nNeither did he en­\n\ngage in excessive vocalises, nor did he indulge in powerful dramatics*\n\nHowever, it cannot be said that elements of\n\neither technique were lacking* His \"Grand Motets” combined numerous, seeminglyindependent episodes or movements which were moderate in\n\n93 d u Mont, himself, was considered a fine organist.

Still more important, many reproduce exactly the form of the allemande with two reprises. Some have no instrumental prelude: the sixth, Domine in Virtu te T u a ; the eleventh, Exultat Animus; the thirteenthT\" Magnif Teat 7J There is a vis ible effort to appropriate this sym­ phonic introduction to the general sentiment of the piece, in order to make it more than an harmonious ensemble without precise significance. {Footnote: We have seen that the theme of the first recit is sometimes outlined or prepared in the symphony\"^ Upon the last chord, the first episode begins, most frequently an almost dramatic recit for solo voice. The solo is more or less developed, sometimes serving only to expose a theme taken up by two, three or four-voice petit choir of soloists in the figured style of the Meslanges. The basso continuo suffices for accompaniment to this group. Without stopping at the conclusion, the \"Grand Choir,\" always supported by instruments, enters. It continues for some time (ordinarily interrupted b y short answers from the diverse soloists), and sometimes leads to an important cadence on the dominant which is followed by other independent phrases taken by one or more singers of the petit choir and preceded by ritournelles for two violins with or without concertante-style answers. In this case, a general reprise of both choirs and orchestra on another theme leads to the final cadence which is followed by a more or less extended repose. There are generally two or three equivalent episodes arranged on a plan analogous to this. [Footnote: The order of the ordinary combinations is almost always such that two analogous pieces are never successive. If the first episode ends by a \"Grand Choir,\" the second will always begin by some passages taken by soloists and inversely7J When there are three, the second will sometimes consist of only a single piece for pe tit choir: duet, trio, or even solo without the intervening chorus.

The entire motet is represented by 2%0 or 300 measures with a duration of ap­ proximately twenty minutes, as nearly as one can judge without exact transcription of the movements.” (Translated by the present writer.) 96 These three works are located at the Conservatory library in Paris. 97 The latter works of both men were contemporary with the foremost by Lalande. The \"Grand Motets” of Du Mont were composed between 1678 and l 68ip. The Te Deum of Lully was composed in 1677; the De Profundis was possTTbly not written until 1683 .

QUALITIVE EVALUATION OP LALANDE Although summaries always risk the dangers inherent in generalizations, it seems proper to present a qualitative over­ view of Lalande and his \"Grand Motets\" so that the reader may be oriented for the analytic minutiae which follow*\n\nIt is\n\nthe writer’s hope that the following survey will help clear the way for the details of analysis in succeeding chapters* LalandeTs prominence in French sacred music of the late baroque has long remained obscure* famous because he most\n\nIn general, he was\n\naccurately represented in his music\n\nthe spirit of his time as exemplified in the resplendent court of Louis XIV:\n\nhe was for the church what Lully had been\n\nfor the stage* Having lived during that time in which polyphony and harmony joined forces, Lalande presents examples of both id­ ioms*\n\nHis frequent exploitation of one\n\nat the expense of\n\nthe other, or his technique of simultaneously uniting propor­ tional elements of the two styles is typical of his era*\n\nThe\n\ntools of his craft were common to all composers of his time* Therefore, his role was not that of an innovator, but rather was it largely restricted to stylistic and personalized re­ finements within the form of the \"Grand Motet*\"\n\nHis greatest genius lay in his capacity to express the religious sentiment of his era as exactly and with as much force and ardor as had the ancients in plainchant* Lalandefs gamut of sentiments, however, ranged from the grand­ iose, dignified, majestic, and pompous to the meditative, mystic, and sublime*\n\nWhether simple or profound, he touched\n\nthe soul with the spirit of a prophet.\n\nHis sacredmusic was\n\nso conceived that appropriate harmony, noble expression ren­ dering the true meaning of the biblical text unmistakable, voices, and instruments united to present the incomparable effect of religion as revealed in all its majesty through the idiom of music* Plowing melody,\n\ntrue dramatic expression attained by\n\nthorough acquaintance with and application of the natural timbres and capacities of instruments and voices, roundness and perfection of form, and simple but appropriate harmoniza­ tions make his music easy to comprehend aurally*\n\nThese fac­\n\ntors are nowhere more amply evidenced than in his beautiful aria, Adorate eum omnes Angeli E jus,1 undoubtedly the one single example which reveals most completely the level to which Lalande could rise in his moments of inspiration.\n\nSee l!Pominus Regnavit,,f A Motet by Michel-Richard de Lalande, edited by James E. Richards, pp* 50-55# (Unpublished research project, The University of Southern California, Los Angeles, 1949)*\n\nWhen he errs, it is usually evident in either too com­ plete exploitation of primary harmonies or \"eternal fuguing,\" both of which may be attributed to the great bulk of composi­ tions which he was forced to produce.\n\nHowever, at precisely\n\nthat moment wherein his music induces a degree of fatigue or boredom, he suddenly seems to abandon the rules of his art in a burst of enthusiasm and ascends into those sublime realms where the sagacity and finesse of his craft disclose the mysteries which remain hidden in works of purely mechanistic origin. His exploitation of various types of ninth chords and other extreme dissonances strongly evidence and support the theory of a continuous French gastronomic sense for spiced, sensual harmony that extends through to Ravel. The vivid orchestral counterpoints serve to throw into relief that necessarily abstract factor which, as a result of its very intangibility, neatly conveys the essence of the composer’s intent far in excess of normal descriptive powers. The creative imagination with which he endowed these counter­ points inexorably stamp the movements as grand apotheoses of an ideal that was to remain without parallel for a century. The gamut of his emotional expression may\n\nbe surveyed by\n\nsimple comparison of the choral Confundantur, majestic in its declamatory impact (II:pp. 3-8), and Et misericordia, sublime, mystic, and lyric (II:pp. 65-66).\n\nIn general, he presented great contrasts between move­ ments, but it is his perfection within each piece that catches the spirit of the auditor whether it te in a simple song, charming and pastoral, or in the most complex contrapunt­ al choral writing.\n\nThe exact and precise contrapuntal sub­\n\njects differ greatly from the longer phrases of his recits which negate almost entirely the true recitative, but it is in the melodic scope of these recits that Lalande exhibits his fully versatile powers.\n\nA seemingly infinite number of\n\nstyles and sentiments abound, and to choose single lyric (II: pp. 197-202), dancelike excerpts\n\n(II:pp. 33-35) or intensely dramatic\n\n(II:pp. 191-197) for illustrations serves only in­\n\njustice to the myriad shades of intensity he depicted between the extremes. In brief, Lalande was a man of his time, faithful to his heritage, and true to his era. originality within these limitations\n\nStill, he possessed such that he rose to those\n\nheights of artistic creation attainable only by the chosen few. For the hurried reader who would like to obtain quick reference to excerpts of Lalande!s music at its best, this writer has compiled the following list to serve as a guide to the Appendices which contain the \"Grand Motets.” Simultaneous choirs: II:pp. 203-8 and 22ip— 9* Solo, trio, and choir: II: pp. 271-5*\n\n6l Solo and choir: II: pp. 73-78.

Solo and t r i o : II: pp. 56-57Trio:\n\nII: pp. 2 8 9 -2 9 0 .\n\nDuet:\n\nII: pp. 11-13.\n\nSolo:\n\nII: pp. 8-10, 50-51, 6 3 -6 I4., 191-197, 197-202,\n\nand\n\n275-76. Considering each \"Grand Motet\" as a unit, the following two appear to be the most interesting and truly worthy of performance: Deus In Adjutorium (II:pp. 1-23) and Judica Me Deus\n\n(II:pp. 121-172). II.\n\nNOTES ON THE TRANSCRIPTIONS\n\nGeneral statement. matic alterations, clefs,\n\nExcept for the use of certain chro­ and English words, variables which\n\nwill be discussed at length throughout this chapter, eight of the \"Grand Motets\" have been transcribed with complete fidel­ ity to the original editions. One of the other two motets, Judica Me Deus, Volume II, page 1 2 1 , has been transcribed from a copy now in possession of the Concert Society of Versailles at Paris.\n\nThis score\n\ncontains the orchestral remplissage that is lacking on the original edition. The tenth motet, Deus Noster, Volume II, p. 173 9 also\n\n62 contains parts of remplissage, but in this instance they have been added by this writer since the parts do not exist on the score proper. The sequence in which the first nine motets appear has been determined by the chronology of their dates of com­ position.\n\nThe date of the tenth motet, In Convertendo Do-\n\nminus , cannot be ascertained.\n\nThe ones that can be dated\n\nwere composed between 1 6 9 1 and 17Oi^. Chromatic alterations.\n\nThroughout the original scores,\n\n\"harmonic\" sharps are employed instead of \"naturals\" (\"B#\" in the key of \"F\" major indicates \"B \")•\n\nIn all instances,\n\nmodern notation has been adhered to, and, accordingly,\n\nthe\n\n\"sharps\" appear as \"naturals\" in the transcriptions. Key signatures.\n\nM M M M .\n\nkey signatures. temporary usage.\n\nNo alterations have been made in\n\nIn major,\n\nthey correspond exactly to con­\n\nIn minor, however,\n\nthere is always one\n\nless flat found in the signature than is customary in cur­ rent practice (\"G-\" minor has but one flat instead of two), and appropriate chromatic alterations are made in the body of the music. Since signature changes would have necessitated fre­ quent corresponding modifications in continuo figuration, the original notation has been retained in all instances.\n\nOrnament interpretation.\n\nIn order to clarify the\n\nprinciples given in Appendix B, Ornaments Found in the Motets . two transcriptions contain footnoted ornament interpretations which this writer considers \"probable.\"\n\nThere is no single\n\n\"authentic\" interpretation in most instances. Gontinuo interpretation.\n\nThe basso-continuo of the\n\ntwo aforementioned motets has been \"realized\" to exemplify the correct stylistic interpretation.\n\nThis technique will\n\nbe discussed at length later in the chapter. Terms and words found on the scores. are those of the editor.\n\n- All English words\n\nThis includes the names of both\n\ninstruments and vocalists that are enumerated on the left side of the score.\n\nNo such nomenclature exists on the originals.\n\nIt has been added to facilitate score reading.\n\nAll words\n\nother than those in English appear on the scores from -which the transcriptions have been made. The most accurate criteria upon which the stylistic interpretation of this music can be based are the verbal di­ rections found on the original scores.\n\nOf the twenty-three\n\ndifferent terms used to indicate mood or character,\n\nonly one\n\nbears any connotations of \"heaviness,\" pesament, and only one indicates \"slow\" movement, lentement.\n\nEach of these words\n\nappears but one time. All other terms used indicate and express a light,\n\nsweet, and gay character quite contrary to the general style of most church music*^\n\n\"Legerement , 11 which occurs more fre­\n\nquently than any other single term, is found thirteen times, and, including combined terms\n\n(two or more words)\n\ninvolving\n\nvariants of \"leger,” it appears twenty-eight times*\n\nIn\n\nsupport of this general character, Lalande carefully indica­ ted \"sans lenteur\" on seven different occasions* Thus, the distinction between lfmusic for the church” and \"liturgical music” becomes immediately apparent in the general mood of these \"Grand Motets.”\n\nThe basis of this\n\ndistinction will be presented later during a discussion of esthetics and the secular influences of court life that pre­ vailed* Clefs.\n\nEight different clefs are employed in the\n\noriginal notation:\n\n”C ” clefs on the first, second, third,\n\nand fourth lines; ”F ” clefs on the third and fourth lines; and ”G ” clefs on the first and second lines.\n\nThe last men­\n\ntioned are used for Soprano voices, violins, flutes, oboes,\n\n^ The terms used, in order of frequency, are as follows Legerement, thirteen times; leger et gracieux, seven times; doucement, seven times; vivement, five times; l 6 g e r , five times gracieusement, five times; sans lenteur, three times; rondement sans lenteur, two times; gracieusement sans lenteur, two times; gracieuse et lourez, two times; and the following each one time: modd’r ^ ; v i f ; pes ament; viste; leger et anirn^; plus leger; tr&s gracieusement; legerement et gracieusement; douce­ ment et gracieusement; rondement et fi^rment; rondement; lentem e n t * A total of sixty-three indications.\n\n65 ©t cetera.\n\nIn the transcriptions, these all appear in the\n\n\"G\" clef on the second line. The \"F\" clef on the fourth line is employed for the bass parts of both the orchestra and the chorus.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe distinction applicable to the \"F\" clef on the third line is not so clearly defined.\n\nIt is used only in the vocal\n\nparts, and the range at times demands almost a tenor voice* At\n\nother places the tessitura is quite low*\n\nIn general,\n\nthe part functions like a high bass or baritone, and the name \"first bass\" has been applied to it on the score* The tenor voice, appearing in tenor clef (\"C\" on the fourth line) on the original, has been renotated in the \"G\" clef on the second line: the customary practice in vocal music today.\n\nNaturally, it sounds an octave lower than the\n\nactual pitch indicated.\n\nSimilarly, the alto voice, original­\n\nly in the alto clef (\"C\" on the third line), has been renotated In the \"G\" clef on the second line as is now habitual in choral music* Regarding the \"C\" clef on the first and second lines, consider the opinion of Eugene Borrel: • * * the \"C\" clef on the first line designates a second violin; but does the \"C\" clef on the second line designate a third violin or a viola? The \"C\" clef on the third line seems to designate a viola: but as it rarely descends below er it can be played by a violin.\n\nEsc: But, in general, one considers that there are two violins and two violas because the ancients utilized the\n\nquintes or tailles which correspond very closely to our violas *3 Since the contrapuntally important violin parts\n\nare\n\nalways written in !,G fl clef or in ,fC ,f clef on the bottom line, and since the parts denoted by the ,,C ,t clefs on the second or third lines are frequently mere l!remplissage,fl it is this w r i t e r ’s opinion that the latter should be performed on violas.\n\nHowever, since violists in such numbers are diffi­\n\ncult to obtain today, the first viola part has been notated as a third violin.\n\nThus, only one viola part remains on\n\nthe transcriptions, but the third violin part is functionally comparable to it.4 Me t e r .\n\nThe meter signatures found in this music de­\n\nnote an overwhelming preference for ,f3 tf and n/ tf.\n\nThe former,\n\nalways the equivalent of 3 / 4 meter, occurs 35%> of the time, and the latter, comparable with f,alla breve\" is found in l±0% of the signatures.\n\nThe remaining 25% include 3/2, 6/4* 2,\n\n3 Taken from a personal letter to this writer, dated June 1, 1949* Translation by the present writer.

(1)\n\nNotes which do not move by step should be per­\n\nformed in equal values unless otherwise notated. (2)\n\nWherever notes of sufficiently small value to re­\n\nquire four to a beat are employed, alternate notes, beginning with the first one, should be sustained somewhat longer than the alternate notes starting with the second.\n\nHowever, if\n\neven smaller values occur consistently in the music, aforementioned notes\n\nthen the\n\n(four to a beat) are performed equally,\n\nand the notes of smaller value, occurring under the same cir­ cumstances as enumerated above, become unequal. (3)\n\nIn recitative, the rules of notes inegales do not\n\napply. Thus, in meters of 2/lf and 3/if, sixteenth notes that move by step might be performed as notes inegales. 2 , and\n\nIn 3/2,\n\neighth notes might be subjected to the unequal\n\ndivision* Although the criteria for judgment are certainly far from lucid, it is altogether reasonable to assume that this music was, at least in part, subjected to the above manner­ isms in performance.\n\nWhether they were always applied to\n\nall this music, recitative excepted, is a question for con­ jecture which will probably remain an enigma to perplex all contemporary performers.\n\nPersonal taste applied with dis­\n\ncretion remains the only true basis for passing judgment. 1 & Dotted n o t e s .\n\nSince the double-dotted note was\n\nprobably not employed until after the middle of the eigh­ teenth century,17 the single dotted note was often exagger­ ated into its equivalent.\n\nAs in the case of notes inegales,\n\nthe problems of when, where, and to what degree the exagger­ ation should be applied remain unsolved to this day.\n\nMost\n\nauthorities agree that the dot after a note indicated merely a prolongation of undetermined value which was dependent upon the style, tempo, and type of music performed.\n\nIn\n\nl 6 The best sources of information of the subject are as follows: Eugene Borrel, ,fLes Notes Inegales,\" ojd . c it .; Eugene Borrel, L fInterpretation de la Musique Franpaise (Paris Felix Alcan, 1934)* EugSne Borrel, Interpretation de L !Ancien R 6 citatif,n Revue de Musicologie, February, 1931; Arnold Dolmetsch, o£. c i t .; and Georg Muffat1s \"Prefaces\" to the first and second Florilegium which are published in Denkmfller der Tonkunst in Oesterreich.
