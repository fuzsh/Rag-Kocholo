        "text": "Welcome to Records International\n\nFor 28 years Records International has specialized in bringing unusual repertoire to collectors of classical music. We assume that you already have enough versions of the \"standards\" and know them well enough to be curious about what else was going on at the same time as such giants as Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and Tchaikovsky were creating their masterpieces.\n\nWhat was going on then? Who else was composing in their shadows?\n\nHow about Heinichen, Myslivicek, Vorisek, Raff and Rubinstein?\n\nOr Kuhnau, Kraus, Spohr, Fuchs and Gretchaninov?\n\nWhich composers of our century are worthy to stand alongside the masters of the classical world?\n\nEach month we offer dozens of new titles, many world premiere recordings, others the only available CD versions, but all of them fascinating repertoire, demanding rediscovery.\n\nHere's a website that we strongly suspect will be of interest to a lot of you -\n\nClassical Lost & Found: Forgotten Music By Greats & Great Music By Forgottens\n\nClassical Lost and Found (CLOFO.com) and its CROCKS Newsletter tell you about new classical recordings of forgotten music by great composers and great music by forgotten composers. Exceptional sounding discs for the audiophile are also noted.\n\nNotes for July 2024\n\nNumber of items in this month's catalogue: 0\n\nDear Customers, No catalogue again this month. The time has finally come for my surgical procedure to mitigate the effects of Parkinson’s. Hopefully, after a period of recovery, I’ll be able to resume operations in some form or another. Watch this space for more news. Thanks again for your forbearance. Jeff"
