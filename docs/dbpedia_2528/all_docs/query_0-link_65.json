I have retained the French spelling of the names of the French and Navarrese royalty. Regarding medieval authors, my practice has varied according to custom. Thus, I speak of Philippe de Beaumanoir as Beaumanoir but Christine de Pisan as Christine. I have followed Anglophone usage in not adding diacritical marks to my own transcriptions from manuscripts in Middle French, but I have retained those in printed sources by French editors. I have added apostrophes according to modern usage in order to improve readability. One particular choice to note is my decision to call King Jean II’s eldest son and heir Charles ‘the Dauphin’. The Dauphiné had only recently become part of the French royal domain, and Jean had been the ﬁrst French prince to hold it. Charles and others gave precedence to his position as the Duke of Normandy, which was a grander and more venerable title than that of Dauphin. Nevertheless, for most readers, ‘the Dauphin’ is as readily identiﬁable as the heir to the French crown as ‘the Prince of Wales’ is to that of England. My apologies to anyone whose sensibilities I have offended.\n\nOUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 23/3/2021, SPi\n\nOUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 23/3/2021, SPi\n\nA Note on Money The money supply was one of the most important political and economic issues facing the people of France in the mid-fourteenth century. It is also one of the most confusing to understand and explain now. For a full explanation, see John Bell Henneman, Royal Taxation in Fourteenth-Century France: The Development of War Financing, 1322–1356 (Princeton, 1971), 331–353. Prices, ﬁnes, tax receipts, etc. were often expressed in terms of money of account, livres, sous, and deniers tournois (abbreviated l.t., s.t., d.t.) or livres, sous, deniers parisis (l.p., etc.). One l.t. was worth 4/5th of one l.p. One livre was worth 20 sous. One sou was worth 12 deniers. To give some sense of value, a male labourer might earn as little as 4 d. or as much as 12 s. per day, while the annual revenues of a modest lordship averaged about 200 l. A basic pair of men’s shoes cost 6 d., and a good warhorse might go for upwards of 500 l. The main gold coins in circulation included the mouton (so-called because of its angus dei device), worth around 30 s.t./24 s.p., with the demi-mouton or denier de l’aignel worth half that, and the écu or ﬂorin à l’écu worth 16–30 s.p. When King Jean returned to France in 1360 he had minted a new coin, the franc à cheval, socalled because he was free (franc) and the coin showed him on a horse. Silver coins included the gros tournois, worth variously 10–12 d.t. and the double tournois, worth 2 d.t., as well as the petit paris and the petit tournois worth 1 d. each. The denier blanc was worth 8 d.t. until being revalued at 3 d.t. in November 1356. As is obvious from the remarks above, the value of these coins ﬂuctuated frequently over the period covered by this book. The royal mint pocketed the difference between a coin’s bullion content (measured in marcs) and its face value (its cours), a difference called the monnayage. The monnayage could be manipulated through reducing the bullion content of the coin, minting more coins, or decreeing a change in their value. Manipulation of the monnayage was a major ﬁnancial expedient for the crown in the period of this book but also a major source of political dissension as changes in the value of coins played havoc with prices, consumption, debts, and business. When money is discussed in this book, I have kept the terminology used by the source, which is variously expressed in terms of coins, monies of account, or both.

In the Île-deFrance north of Paris, Normandy to its west, Picardy and Champagne to its east, and further aﬁeld, they attacked the nobility’s castles and manor houses, burning them down and destroying or stealing their contents. They killed noblemen and assaulted their families. According to some reports, they even killed noble children and gang-raped noblewomen, murdering some pregnant ones. On 10 June at the eastern city of Meaux, they allied with urban commoners and troops from Paris, itself in rebellion against the crown, in order to attack a castle on the Marne River that was sheltering nobles, among them the Dauphin’s wife and baby. But there, they were defeated. The castle’s noble garrison chased down those who managed to ﬂee and slaughtered them ‘like pigs’ in the city’s outskirts.¹ At the same moment, 70 kilometres to the north-east, a noble army led by King Charles II of Navarre, himself a great French prince, had captured the rebels’ general and was obliterating their forces in a battle near Clermont-en-Beauvaisis. Bands of enraged nobles, their fear of the peasants mastered and their natural advantage regained, took it in their turn to overrun the countryside, carrying out executions of suspected rebels wherever they found them and burning villages wholesale. The rebels tried to regroup, but July saw their efforts deﬁnitively extinguished and the Parisian rebellion crushed. The revolt was soon called ‘the Jacquerie’, a term ﬁrst attested in 1360 and derived from the sobriquet ‘Jacques Bonhomme’ (James Goodman) borne by its participants.² Along with the Black Death (from 1348) and the Hundred Years War (1337–1453), the Jacquerie is one of the headline events of the ‘calamitous’ fourteenth century. In French and even in English, its name is still used to connote ¹ Jean le Bel, 262. ² ‘Chartre de Jacquerie pour Jehan Heudeman demourant a Dury. Donne a Hedin l’an mil ccclx ou mois de Juillet.’ (AN JJ 88, no. 43, fol. 29v). The contents are not transcribed. The relevant chapter heading in the Grandes chroniques, written in the 1370s, also called the revolt ‘la mauvaise Jaquerie’ (GC, 9, 177). Froissart called the rebels ‘jakes’ used the term: ‘celle jakerie’ (Froissart, SHF, §415, pp. 103–104). The term ‘Jacques’ ﬁrst appears royal judicial sources in October 1358: ‘avec pluseurs des Jaques de la dite ville et les genz du pais de Meucien’ (AN JJ 86, no. 430, fol. 151r). The chronicler Jean le Bel, writing a month or two earlier, erroneously reported that the rebels’ captain was called ‘Jaques Bonhomme’ (Jean le Bel, 260).\n\nThe Jacquerie of 1358: A French Peasants’ Revolt.

At the time, royal documents more usually spoke of it as les effroiz—that is, the ‘noise’ or ‘terrors’—or les commotions, which country people (gens du plat pays) had unleashed against the nobility.³ Echoing these sentiments in more colourful terms, contemporary chroniclers offered their own versions, calling the rebels ‘rabid dogs’ and ‘crueller than Saracens’.⁴ Evoking fear, chaos, and the rural mob’s rage against its social superiors, such language eloquently testiﬁes to the uprising’s emotional effects on its victims, but it does little to elucidate the Jacquerie’s causes or mechanics. Nor does its homogeneity reﬂect the varieties of individual experience that lay behind and together constituted the rebellion for its participants. The language chosen by elite, literate contemporaries reveals how they understood the revolt, but it also shows us how little they wished to understand it. Modern historians have sometimes done better. The ﬁrst and until now the only scholarly book devoted to the rebellion, Siméon Luce’s 1859 Histoire de la Jacquerie, placed the revolt in its speciﬁc historical context and paid attention to the particular people and places it implicated. Luce highlighted evidence connecting the Jacquerie with the Parisian rebellion led by the merchant Étienne Marcel and argued that he probably orchestrated it for political ends.⁵ A century later, Raymond Cazelles went further, arguing that the Jacques themselves were mostly well-off professionals; that the revolt’s inception had clear military utility to the Parisian rebellion; and that rustics’ cooperation with the Parisians and other urban allies evinced a pioneering social vision, one dominated by the town and the countryside’s economic relationships to the exclusion of the outmoded ‘feudal’ nobility.⁶ Luce’s and Cazelles’s explanations jibe with a slew of recent work on late medieval uprisings that emphasizes their rationality, organization, and political motivations.⁷ Rural–urban cooperation of the type they posited now seems more ³ In other contexts, the chancery used effroiz in the sense of ‘terrors’ or ‘confusion’ of war, e.g. ‘les effroiz des ennemiz estoient sur le pays’ (AN JJ 118, no. 276, fol. 148r). Its etymology is the same as that of the English word ‘affray’. ⁴ Jean le Bel, 255–257; Froissart, SHF, §413, p. 100. ⁵ Luce, 53–55, 93–104.

In 1879, Jules Flammermont attacked Luce’s argument in an article that described the Jacquerie in terms not that different from those of the chronicles. According to Flammermont, the Jacquerie was a spontaneous ‘explosion’ of instinctive hatreds nourished for centuries by ‘rude peasants, without education or direction, dazed by poverty and drink’, who lacked the basic intellectual capacity for plotting.⁹ This is almost an anti-explanation, one notably at odds with newer scholarship demonstrating the intellectual range and political consciousness of rural people, but it has remained surprisingly central to the scholarship.¹⁰ Although Guy Fourquin and Rodney Hilton viewed the Jacquerie as having some organization and rational features, Michel Mollat and Philippe Wolff ’s classic book on late medieval revolts called the Jacquerie ‘as incoherent as it was spontaneous’, an interpretation shared\n\n2014); Patrick Lantschner, The logic of political conﬂict in medieval cities: Italy and the southern Low Countries, 1370–1440 (Oxford, 2015); Fabrizio Titone (ed.), Disciplined dissent: Strategies of nonconfrontational protest in Europe from the twelfth to the early sixteenth century (Rome, 2016); Justine Firnhaber-Baker and Dirk Schoenaers (eds), The Routledge history handbook of medieval revolt (Abingdon, 2017); Vincent Challet and Héloïse Hermant (eds), Des mots et des gestes: Le corps et la voix dans l’univers de la révolte (XIVe–XVIIIe siècles), special issue of Histoire, économie & société 38 (2019). ⁸ Rodney Hilton, Bond men made free: Medieval peasant movements and the English rising of 1381 (London, 1973), 214–232; A.F.

As will be seen, there is considerable evidence to support Luce’s and Cazelle’s arguments about organization, coordination, and objectives, but there is also some evidence that points in other directions. One can have good reasons for privileging some sources over others, such as their circumstances of composition or evident authorial intentions, but the interpretative impasse has not stemmed from such methodological considerations. Rather, all of the Jacquerie’s interpreters on both sides of the Luce/ Flammermont divide have viewed the revolt as a homogenous movement with a unitary purpose and fate. They have understood it as a ‘thing’ to which contemporaries ascribed a single, stable meaning. Yet, the revolt took place over a number of weeks. It was not a single event but a constellation of many events, and it evolved over time. Involving thousands or even tens of thousands of individuals in hundreds of places, it was understood in different ways by its participants, as well as its victims, and those understandings, too, were liable to shift during the revolt, as well as after it. To adopt Flammermont’s explosion metaphor, even if combustible materials are lying around, they have to be carefully assembled with skill and knowledge before being detonated, ideally at a speciﬁc time and place in order to cause maximum damage, but people, unlike shrapnel, have some agency as to where the blast takes them or whether it takes them at all, and they might decide to change direction mid-ﬂight, perhaps several times. My purpose in researching this book was to disassemble the Jacquerie and to disaggregate the Jacques and their associates. My purpose in writing it was to put it all back together again as a story about how individuals reacted to a speciﬁc set of circumstances, how events ¹¹ Guy Fourquin, The anatomy of popular rebellion in the Middle Ages, Anne Chesters (trans.)

The story that I will tell in this book goes roughly like this: the ﬁrst episode in the Jacquerie, an attack on some noblemen in the Oise River village of Saint-Leud’Esserent on 28 May, was undertaken as a quasi-military response to a speciﬁc crisis in royal politics. It was brought about through cooperation between a Parisian faction opposed to the crown and a cohort of rural individuals, much as Luce and Cazelles argued, although there is as much reason to believe that the impetus for this attack came from the country-folk as from the Parisians. The political crisis had originated in the French defeat at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 when the English captured King Jean II. The government of France had devolved upon the adolescent Dauphin Charles (later King Charles V) and to the assemblies of the Three Estates of northern France, which were dominated by the head of the Parisian merchants, Étienne Marcel, and the bishop of Laon, Robert le Coq. These men and their followers favoured a thoroughly reforming governmental agenda. They were friendly with King Charles II of Navarre, who was a potential rival to the Dauphin, and they were critical of the Dauphin’s close counsellors. In early 1358, they fell out with the Dauphin, murdering two of his familiars in front of him, and he decided to expel their party from Paris by force. In April, he occupied castles on the Marne and the Seine rivers, threatening Paris’s supply lines, and he began assembling an army from his noble supporters. The ﬁrst incident in what became the Jacquerie was intended to counter these efforts by keeping the Oise River trafﬁc ﬂowing, but it is not clear that all the parties involved had meant the incident to spark the massive movement that quickly followed. Rather, large-scale rural revolt seems to have coalesced in its aftermath and to have developed in ways that many of its participants and allies had not foreseen. Primarily targeting noble castles and property, the Jacquerie as it evolved over the next two weeks was nevertheless very useful to the Parisian faction because it diverted the nobles’ attention away from Paris. In early June, the Parisians were able to move from defence to offence, culminating in an unsuccessful joint assault with the Jacques on Meaux. The nobles’ victory at Meaux, combined with the Jacques’ betrayal and subsequent defeat by Charles of Navarre near Clermont, turned the tide against the rebels. The Parisian faction tried to reignite the revolt, especially in the south and the south-west, but, in the north and east where it had begun, nobles were already taking sanguinary vengeance. This ‘Counter-Jacquerie’ gave the movement a more pronounced character of social war than it had at ﬁrst possessed, and it may have actually served to incite an uprising in Champagne where there was none before. But many rural rebels had understood what they were doing as a social war from the beginning. They opposed their leaders’ efforts to limit and focus their violence, and pressed them to take riskier actions. For their part, the Jacques’ allies in Paris and in provincial cities like Amiens were more cautious and considered themselves to be distinct\n\nOUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 23/3/2021, SPi\n\n6\n\n   \n\nfrom the country-folk, as well as from the nobility. The conﬂicting visions among the Jacques and the latent socio-economic and cultural differences between the country-folk and their urban allies were never resolved. Those ﬁssures constituted a major weakness and contributed a great deal to the movement’s ultimate failure. As the last pockets of rural rebellion were defeated in July, the Dauphin and the nobles returned their attention to Paris. The city fell at the end of the month, when Marcel was killed in a riot by unknown hands. After 10 days of spectacular reprisals, the Dauphin turned to reconciliation, granting a general pardon (lettre de rémission) for all the crimes committed during the Parisian rebellion, the Jacquerie, and the Counter-Jacquerie. Individual pardons—dozens and eventually hundreds of them—followed in a ﬂood of bureaucratic mercy into the autumn and well beyond. Requesting these pardons and writing them required imposing a narrative on the summer’s events. (In some cases, a little invention was also required.) Alternative versions nonetheless proliferated, due to both long-running lawsuits for damages and simmering resentments that sometimes boiled over into homicidal rage.\n\nThe Stories in the Sources Along with about a dozen chronicle accounts, these narratives created the Jacquerie as an event with meaning for its contemporaries and their successors, including us. There are no documents dating from the time of the revolt itself: no rebel letters or petitions, no communications from authorities, no poetry or songs or pamphlets such as exist for other uprisings like the English Rising of 1381 or the ﬁfteenth-century revolt of the Catalan Remenses.¹⁴ That means we have almost no window onto what people thought was happening at the time. Such things did once exist—the sources mention that the Jacques sometimes sent written messages—but by accident or design they have not survived.¹⁵ All the textual evidence that we possess either pre-dates the revolt or is coloured by its failure, the nobles’ revenge, and the fall of Paris. One of the basic arguments of this book is thus that the sources tell us at least as much about the acts of narrative creation and imagination that were committed in the wake of the revolt as they do about what actually happened out in the countryside in the summer of 1358. Retrospection is a fundamental characteristic of the Jacquerie sources that affects interpretation at every turn. Partiality, in the senses both of incompleteness and of bias, is another. The main corpus of sources for the Jacquerie is made up of two types of documents:\n\n¹⁴ E.g.

Most of the judicial sources are letters of remission, about 180 of which were issued to individuals or, less often, to communities implicated in the revolt or its suppression. The chronicles have all been published in scholarly editions. The remissions, on the other hand, are mostly unedited and exist only in registry copy manuscripts that were kept by the royal chancery, now housed at the French Archives nationales. (Luce was familiar with most of these and published a somewhat unrepresentative sample as an appendix to his Histoire de la Jacquerie.) In addition to Jacques or CounterJacques, dozens of members of the Parisian faction and partisans of King Charles of Navarre also received remissions, which help to ﬂesh out the wider political context. While chronicles and remissions form the backbone of the source material for the study of the Jacquerie, I have found a variety of other complementary sources. Many of these are legal documents. The revolt produced several dozen or so records from lawsuits that were heard by the supreme royal court known as the Parlement de Paris. This was France’s court of ﬁnal appeal, as well as the court with jurisdiction over many nobles and the venue of choice for some elites. Some of these suits have been known for a long time and some of them have been newly identiﬁed.¹⁶ All these documents come from civil suits between parties claiming damages inﬂicted during the Jacquerie or the Counter-Jacquerie.¹⁷ I was also able to exploit the records of quasi-judicial settlements made between parties and known as accords, which Parlement validated and stored.¹⁸ In addition to the strictly legal documents, a range of sources from local archives gives insight into the identities, relationships, and possible motives of many of the people involved in the Jacquerie.\n\nThe Chronicles Of the two main genres of sources, historians have often privileged the narrative accounts. Although it is generally recognized that chronicles tell us as much about their authors and audiences as they do about the events they report, in pleasant contrast to the fragmentary, atomized accounts in the judicial records, chronicles\n\n¹⁶ I was able to ﬁnd legal suits overlooked by Luce through keyword databases of the Parlement registers maintained by the Institut d’Histoire du Droit.

Froissart took nearly all of his Jacquerie stories from the much less popular chronicle of Jean le Bel, who wrote his chapters on the Jacquerie between autumn 1358 and 1359.²⁰ Froissart’s chronicle exists in over a hundred contemporary manuscripts that can be grouped into four successive redactions, the ﬁrst three of which include the Jacquerie episodes.²¹ The third redaction, composed between 1395 and 1399 and extant only in a recently relocated manuscript at Chicago’s Newberry Library, contains some stories unknown from other sources.²² The tales in Jean le Bel/Froissart are particularly notable for their chivalric ethos and the window that they thus provide onto noble perceptions of the revolt, but also because Jean le Bel’s chronicle is the earliest narrative account. Of the other chronicles composed in the half century or so after the revolt, the earliest after Jean le Bel’s is a Latin chronicle written in Paris by a Jean de Venette, possibly the same Jean de Venette as a Carmelite monk by whom we have other, very different writing.²³ The Jacquerie section, probably written between 1359 and 1360, may give us the closest thing to a perspective from country-folk, for its author hailed from a Picard village and is certainly the most sympathetic chronicler of the revolt.²⁴ Around the turn of the ﬁfteenth century, this chronicle served as a source for a monk (religieux) of Saint-Denis, the grand seat of French historical writing in the Middle Ages, who abridged some of it in his continuation\n\n¹⁹ Neithard Bulst, ‘ “Jacquerie” und “Peasants’ Revolt” in der französischen und englischen Chronistik’, Vorträge und Forschungen 31 (1987): 791–819. ²⁰ Marie-Thérèse de Medeiros, Jacques et chroniqueurs: Une étude comparée de récits contemporains relatant la Jacquerie de 1358 (Paris, 1979), 27. ²¹ On the chronology of the chronicle’s various redactions, including the Chicago MS or ‘version C’, see Godfried Croenen, ‘La guerre en Normandie au XIVe siècle et le problème de l’évolution textuelle des Chroniques de Jean Froissart’ in Anne Curry and Véronique Gazeau (eds), La guerre en Normandie (XIe–XVe siècle), Colloque international de Cerisy, 30 septembre–3 octobre 2015 (Caen, 2018), 111–147, esp. 141–142.

The religieux, who was much less sympathetic to the rustics than his primary source, also drew upon a vernacular chronicle (or its sources) that continued the Grandes chroniques tradition for the reigns of Jean II and Charles V.²⁵ This chronicle, lavishly illustrated in a manuscript destined for the royal library, was composed at Charles’s direction, the passages on the Jacquerie being completed in the mid-1370s, and both text and decoration articulate a strongly Valois ideological bias.²⁶ Around the same time, an anonymous author wrote a narrative known as the Chronique normande, upon which was based a redaction known as the version non-normande (BnF franç. 5610), later adapted for the Istore et croniques de Flandres; Jean de Noyal’s ‘Miroir historial’, written at Laon and also drawing material from Jean de Venette and other chronicles; and the ﬁfteenth-century Chronographia regum Francorum, composed at Saint-Denis.²⁷ The Chronique des quatre premiers Valois, compiled in the 1390s, possibly in Rouen, is independent of these others. It exists in only one, ﬁfteenthcentury manuscript copy (BnF franç. 10468, fol. 113–190). In addition to these French chronicles, the Jacquerie also appears in several foreign chronicles, including the English Anonimalle Chronicle, Thomas Gray’s Scalacronica, and Matteo Villani’s Cronica.²⁸ These diverse narratives do not always agree, not least because their authors had access to different sources of information: what the royal counsellor saw was not what the Norman soldier experienced, and what the chivalrous Froissart valorized or deplored, the humble monk passed over in silence. None of the writers was himself among the rebels. Only the Norman chronicler may have been an eyewitness to the Jacquerie, but only on the side of its suppressors, possibly while serving in the noble army led by Charles of Navarre. The chronicle of Jean de Venette alone shows any familiarity with the country-folk.

Roland Delachenal, editor of the chronicle and biographer of Charles V, had doubts about this attribution, as well as about an alternative attribution to the poet Eustache Deschamps (‘Introduction’, GC, III: xii–xx).

Each one must be read as an incomplete account. Each must also be read as the product of a particular authorial programme that determined how the chronicler told his story. Moral, didactic, political, and aesthetic aims structured their tales, reﬂecting but also seeking to shape social relations and values. What was ‘true’ or worth telling for a medieval chronicler did not necessarily correspond to what a modern reader would consider ‘the facts’.²⁹ The celebration of aristocratic society and mores that underpins Froissart and Jean le Bel’s stories led them to treat the Jacquerie as a morality play about the failures of noble virtue. The horrifying stories they told about gang-rape and (in Froissart) attempted cannibalism did much to illustrate the perils of aristocratic cowardice and the monstrosity of peasant pride, but they may have been embellished or even invented for dramatic effect, as I discuss in Chapter 5.³⁰ Historians often put more faith in Jean de Venette because of his supposedly peasant background, but, whatever his identity, he intended his chronicle to be a record of wonders and portents connected to the apocalyptic predictions of the friar Jean de Roquetaillade, and he classed the Jacquerie among the nova mirabilia heralding the End.³¹ If the writer of this chronicle is identical to the Jean de Venette who served as prior of the Carmelite convent in Paris, he also owed a debt of patronage to the pro-Navarrese Dowager-Queen Jeanne d’Évreux and her daughter Blanche Capet.³² Although most of the chroniclers suggest that something was out of balance in the countryside’s ‘moral economy’, none of them was sympathetic to the Jacques or even much interested in their point of view. This hostility toward, or incomprehension of, medieval rebels is a welldocumented phenomenon in sources for popular rebellions across Latin Europe. Like other recent historians of medieval revolt, I have tried to work around this problem by being attentive to their inadvertent disclosures about the rebellion and its participants.³³ That is, moments when the texts seem to reveal something ²⁹ Chris Given-Wilson, Chronicles: The writing of history in medieval England (London, 2004), ch. 1.

One such instance is Jean le Bel’s confused addendum to his account of the Jacquerie, in which he meditated on the seemingly inexplicable origins of the revolt. Over the course of a brief passage, the chronicle moves from the possibility of outside help, to the response of the Lord of Coucy, to the Jacques’ captain, whom it erroneously calls Jaques Bonhomme, this man’s possible ties to Robert le Coq, and the strained relationship between Coucy and le Coq. Jean le Bel mused: One can hardly believe that such people would have dared to undertake such devilry without the help of some others, especially in the kingdom of France. In the same manner [as nobles discussed in the previous passage], the Lord of Coucy summoned people from wherever he could get them; thus he attacked his neighbours and destroyed them, hanging and having them killed in such a horrible way as it would be terrible to remember; and these bad people had a captain called Jacques Bonhomme, who was a real hick/terrible person (parfait vilain) and who tried to claim that the bishop of Laon had urged him to do this, for he was one of his men. The Lord of Coucy also did not like that bishop.³⁴\n\nHere, for a moment, we see behind the neat narrative to its messy details. When Froissart retold this story some decades later, he smoothed out the wrinkles that Jean le Bel, writing only months after the revolt, was not sure how to straighten. Except for brieﬂy mentioning Jake Bonhomme and the Lord of Coucy in other parts of his narrative, Froissart completely omitted this passage. He also passed over speculations found earlier in his source text about the possible role of tax collectors, Robert le Coq, Étienne Marcel, and even Charles of Navarre in inciting the uprising.³⁵ Froissart’s narrative neatening of Jean le Bel’s rough edges throws the process of composition into relief: Jean le Bel told what he knew about the Jacquerie, but it is clear that he did not know all he thought there might be to tell about it. Later, when Froissart came to write his more artful tale of vicious peasants, distressed damsels, and dashing knights, these logistical and political considerations seemed less important to the story that he wanted to tell. How and why the chroniclers told a story, or did not tell a story, often tells us as much as the story itself.\n\n³⁴ Jean le Bel, 259–260.

It is true that the pardons, lawsuits, and accords are not stories in the same sense that the chronicles are. They are not structured as continuous narratives, and they were composed for quite different purposes, including discovery of what might be considered ‘the facts’, a process that Chapter 10 discusses in depth. One might be tempted to trust such sources more, despite (or even because of) the fact that they are less entertaining and more labour intensive than chronicles. Produced for individuals and bearing on their actual situation and experience, they offer different opportunities for investigation and discovery, and a sense of getting closer to real people. They nevertheless pose problems of partialness and partiality that are at least as serious as those presented by the chronicles. Like the chronicles, the judicial texts required creating a storyline for an inchoate and incomplete jumble of experiences and information. A messy collection of news, rumours, fears, and lies had to be moulded into a story that served both men (and some women) in need of justice or mercy and a crown in search of authority and reconciliation. Just as Froissart had to decide what he believed and what served the purposes of his story, when the Dauphin extended his pardon to the rebels and their persecutors after his return to Paris, he and his bureaucrats had to decide what it was, exactly, that was to be forgiven or punished, and what it was, exactly, that had happened. The judicial sources do not provide all the pieces of the puzzle, and the information that they do offer has been intensively managed and manipulated by a variety of ‘authors’, each with their own agenda. These considerations are particularly acute for the letters of remission, which make up the bulk of the judicial sources.³⁶ Issued upon the recipient’s humble supplication to the crown, remissions are made up of not only the grant of pardon, but also a narrative section of varying length that explained what the recipient had done to need pardon. In over 40 per cent of the Jacquerie remissions, this narrative portion simply repeats a standard formula:\n\n³⁶ See Natalie Zemon Davis, Fiction in the archive: Pardon tales and their tellers in sixteenth-century France (Stanford, 1987); Claude Gauvard, ‘De grâce especial’: Crime, état et société en France à la ﬁn du Moyen Âge, 2 vols (Paris, 1991); Peter Arnade and Walter Prevenier, Honor, vengeance, and social trouble: Pardon letters in the Burgundian Low Countries (Ithaca, 2015).

For example, one issued to Arnoul Guenelon, who served as a village captain in the Jacquerie, explains that he: agreed under fear of death and of losing all his houses and goods to be captain of Catenoy and to ride and accompany its inhabitants for several days in the company of Guillaume Calle, who had been chosen Captain of the people and commune of the Beauvaisis, during which time a few ‘disorderlies’ of the company killed some people, did some pillaging, set some houses on ﬁre, and committed many other crimes, while Arnoul was with the company but not at all in agreement with these things in his heart or his will and would gladly have impeded all their wickedness if he had dared. And when they returned from the castle of Ermenonville, he left their company and went to Senlis, where he has since comported himself well and honestly, as he says, in the defence of the town against the enemies of the realm . . .³⁹\n\n³⁷ ‘ait este avec pluseurs autres du pais d’environ aus effrois qui derrainement & nagaires ont este faiz par les genz du plat pais contre les nobles du dit Royaume a abatre en pluseurs lieux forteresses disciper (sic) leurs biens & bouter feux Et pour ce que aucuns des diz nobles pourroient avoir malivolence & haine aus dessusdit . . . pour occasion des choses dessusdites et le grever en corps & en biens’ (This example from AN JJ 86, no. 222, fol. 73r). ³⁸ See also Justine Firnhaber-Baker, ‘The heart of rebellion: Law, language, and emotion after the French revolts of 1356–58’ in Jesús Ángel Solórzano Telechea, Jelle Haemers, and Roman Czaja (eds), Exclusión y disciplina social en la ciudad medieval europea (Logroño, 2018), 281–296. ³⁹ ‘par la force & contrainte de feu Guillaume Calle nagaires esleu Capitaine du pueple & commun de Beauvaisiz . . .

In that village, this uncle took Pierre by the hand and led him far away from the said assembly. And a lot of fellows (compaignons) then at the assembly, shouted and cried to Jean des Murs, saying ‘Jean, come to your nephew, who is being beaten up!’ At this shout, Jean des Murs came [back] and Pierre returned with him, and took his nephew [Jean le Debonnaire] by the hand and tried to pull him out of the crowd . . . Michel Wastel, accompanied by many other accomplices, hit Jean des Murs in the head with a cudgel called ‘Cormiel’ (sweetheart) so hard that a lot of blood came out, which a lot of people saw, but Pierre le Debonnaire, induced by good and true love in avenging his uncle, with hot anger (chaude melee), and, indeed, in self-defence and repelling force with force, fearing that he and his uncle might die and wishing to avoid this with all his power, hit Michel with a small club (macelotte) in such a way that Michel’s death followed pretty soon afterward⁴⁰\n\nSuch stories have obvious appeal to a historian trying to ﬁnd out ‘what happened’: the role of captain, the existence, name and title of a greater captain, the description of the crowded assembly, its violent, emotional character and appeal to hotheaded young men, the relative wealth of Arnoul, who had more than one house, the inference that some Jacques rode horses, the kinds of weapons they had on ⁴⁰ ‘environ la saint Jehan baptiste derrein passe ot ii ans ou temps que la commotion & assemblee estoit entre les genz du plat pays d’une part et les nobles d’autre part ala quelle commotion ou assemblee le dit Pierre le Debonnaire & Jehan le Debonnaire son frere neveuz & amis de char [de] Jehan des Murs leur oncle alerent par leur Jeunece senz le congie ou sceu de leur dit oncle et pour ce leur dit oncle meu de vraye & bonne amour vers eulz sitost qu’il vint a sa cognoissance les ala querre en une commotion ou assemblee qui lors estoit en la ville de Goiencourt a la quelle ville ycelluy oncle prist par la main le dit Pierre & le mena bien long de la dite assemblee.

But remissions cannot be simply mined for ‘the facts’, as work by Natalie Zemon Davis, Claude Gauvard, and others has made amply clear.⁴¹ Social conventions, as well as narrative and generic ones, shaped the pardon tales’ stories. The family relationship and the ‘good and true love’ that Jean des Murs had for his nephews covers over any other reason he might have gone to Goyencourt, and the nephews’ own presence there is excused by their youth, a conventional source of medieval imprudence, again eliding any other motives. Pardon-tale tellers sought to incite sympathy and deﬂect blame— for example, by reporting the mortal fear that had kept Arnoul Guenelon from following the better intentions of his heart—and it is well to remember that the alternative to remission was usually execution or impoverishment. For all that, remission stories were not necessarily untrue. Indeed, some reliability is assured because remissions were investigated and overly mendacious ones could be challenged and overturned.⁴² The importance of this subsequent investigation is demonstrated by the hesitancy that two noblemen named Gilot and Jean Dudelange expressed about a remission granted to them for killing one Jean ‘called the Golden’ (dit d’oré). The only witnesses to their claim that the latter had insulted them and threatened them with an axe were unfortunately either dead or had ﬂed, so they had not tried to have the letter veriﬁed nor dared to use it (n’ont encores veriﬁe le contenu en nos dites lettres & ne s’en sont osez aidier). Rather than risk it, they decided to go through the expense and trouble of procuring a second remission conﬁrming the ﬁrst and afﬁrming its validity ‘regardless of words or axe’.⁴³ Problems of partiality nevertheless remain. From Guenelon’s story, for example, we might never guess that Ermenonville was the site of an important siege against one of the Dauphin’s counsellor’s castles or that Senlis was the Jacques’ most loyal urban ally. How the Debonnaire brothers came to know about the Goyencourt assembly, and why that assembly was being held, play no part in the story. These are omissions by design, not accident. We know from other sources that the Jacques’ leaders sent messengers to call villagers to central assemblies where they received their marching orders from higher-ups, including from Étienne Marcel himself. Some such assemblies were only attended by those Jacques with leadership responsibilities, a role that would make the Debonnaire brothers especially culpable.⁴⁴ There were good reasons to tell the truth, but maybe not the whole truth. ⁴¹ Davis, Fiction in the archive; Gauvard, ‘De grâce especial’. ⁴² de Carbonnières, ‘lettres de rémission’. A Jacquerie–related example challenging a remission at AN X1a 18, fol. 63.

This altercation and the legal procedures surrounding it are discussed in Chapter 10. ⁴⁴ On these assemblies, see Chapter 6.\n\nOUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 23/3/2021, SPi\n\n16\n\n   \n\nBy contrast, the records from Parlement cases often give us two sides of the story. While for this period we do not have the transcriptions of testimony that are preserved for lawsuits from later decades, the arguments made are epitomized in the decisions Parlement handed down. Sometimes this was done at length, as in the extensive and competing descriptions of what happened at Pierre d’Orgemont’s houses in Gonesse.⁴⁵ Contradictory claims pose their own problems, but it is also important to remember that the stories in lawsuits were shaped by what the court thought was relevant and the diplomatic form into which its clerks had to ﬁt the material. The accords made between parties are much less formal and do not even have a uniform diplomatic structure. This looseness can lend itself to revelation, as in the long tale that opens an agreement made between the Lord of Vez and his subjects, but most accords are too short to reveal much.⁴⁶ We often get considerably less detail—perhaps only a brief mention of the matter requiring settlement—than in the lawsuit records. Less visible, but possibly even more important than the self-interest and generic conventions that constrain the stories in the documents we possess, are the social and procedural factors that limit the kinds and numbers of these documents. It is impossible to measure the actual effect of these kinds of factors, but they may be profound. The social and economic cost of justice in late medieval France means that these sources predominantly concern those able to bear it. Because obtaining a remission cost money and required some legal knowledge, only the relatively well off and reasonably sophisticated were usually able to procure one.⁴⁷ The same sorts of constraints applied to ﬁghting a lawsuit. Those too poor to be worth pursuing for damages might not appear, and a prohibition in the general remission forbidding criminal prosecution against Jacques and Counter-Jacques meant that civil complaints could not be jointly prosecuted with a criminal case. This removed an avenue that allowed claimants to pursue their causes at crown expense.⁴⁸ That men—they were almost exclusively men, as I discuss in Chapter 7—who were comfortable and cosmopolitan enough to navigate royal justice were implicated in the Jacquerie gives us valuable insight into the uprising’s constituency and appeal, but the poor, the ill-connected, and the female may all be signiﬁcantly under-represented.⁴⁹\n\n⁴⁵ AN X1a 14, fol. 476–77, ed. Luce, no. 57, pp. 313–320, discussed in Chapter 8. ⁴⁶ AN X1c 32, no. 31. ⁴⁷ The average price of a lettre de rémission was 32 s. (Gauvard, ‘De grâce especial’, I: 68), equal to nearly 100 days of an unskilled male labourer’s 4 d. average daily wage. Associated costs, such as the notary’s fee and the (optional) chancery registration might push the total up considerably (Brissaud, ‘droit de grâce’, 246). ⁴⁸ Yvonne Bongert, ‘Rétribution et réparation dans l’ancien droit français’, Mémoires de la Société pour l’histoire du droit et des institutions des anciens pays bourguignons, comtois et romands 45 (1988): 64–69. ⁴⁹ See also Justine Firnhaber-Baker, ‘The social constituency of the Jacquerie revolt of 1358’, Speculum 95 (2020): 689–715.\n\nOUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 23/3/2021, SPi\n\n\n\n17\n\nAnother procedural factor shaping the evidence is France’s jurisdictional fragmentation. Those who lived under direct royal jurisdiction would have come before the provincial courts of the regional bailli in the ﬁrst instance (or the royal prévôt if they lived in an unincorporated city), whose fourteenth-century records have mostly disappeared.⁵⁰ But most of those involved in the Jacquerie were not under the crown’s immediate jurisdiction. Rather, they were direct subjects of a local lord, usually a noble person or a clerical institution, such as an abbey, canonry, or episcopal see. These people came before their lord’s court in the ﬁrst instance and would normally have had access to royal courts only upon a successful appeal.⁵¹ There may have been as many as a thousand seigneurial courts in late medieval northern France, whose complicated jurisdictions were ‘entangled and overlapping’ (entermellees et enclavees les unes dedens les autres), as the lawyer Philippe de Beaumanoir remarked, although whatever records they were keeping have mostly vanished.⁵² While the general remission forbade criminal prosecution and reserved all civil cases to the crown, some seigneurial prosecutions did take place, as discussed in Chapter 10. The dangers and opportunities that multiple jurisdictions might present is particularly well illustrated by the case of one Jean de Chauny: imprisoned, criminally prosecuted, and heavily ﬁned by the lord of Berzy-le-Sec, he appealed to the crown on the basis that the general remission had forbidden such prosecutions and, anyway, he was a justiciable of the canons of Soissons.⁵³ We know about Jean’s case, and others like it, because the defendants successfully appealed to Parlement and thus appear in its registers. There were likely many cases in which the defendants were too poor, unsophisticated, or short-lived to have appealed successfully, or whose appeals were denied, especially because appeals for capital cases were almost always deemed inadmissible.⁵⁴ Some seigneurial subjects did seek a royal pardon, with the right to remit also extended to their lord or lords (concedentes . . . ut similem gratiam facere valeant et faciant) but, again, we have no way of knowing how many did not.⁵⁵ Seigneurial jurisdiction may, for instance, explain why we have so few records pertaining to inhabitants of the countryside around Beauvais, despite the revolt’s known concentration in that area, or in the counties of Valois, Clermont, and Montmorency. These areas were outside direct royal jurisdiction and ﬁlled with lesser lords holding varying ⁵⁰ Bernard Guenée, Tribunaux et gens de justice dans le bailliage de Senlis à la ﬁn du Moyen Âge (vers 1380—vers 1550) (Paris, 1963), 19–21. ⁵¹ Ferdinand Lot and Robert Fawtier, Histoire des institutions françaises au Moyen Âge, 3 vols (Paris, 1957–1962), II: 153–156; Guenée, Tribunaux, 64–67. ⁵² Beaumanoir, cap.

Some municipal records for the cities of Laon and Senlis are still extant, although for Senlis they begin only in 1383. Whether by chance or design, some signiﬁcant losses took place around the time of the Jacquerie. The cartulary of Laon’s cathedral chapter, for example, skips from 1351 to 1370.⁵⁸ This is not the fault of the revolt because, unlike their later English counterparts, the Jacques did not target documents. Likely, this warﬁlled period of history was simply not kind to parchment. There are only a very few local sources that bear directly on the Jacquerie’s events, but many more that reveal those involved in more quotidian contexts. The rebel leader Arnoul Guenelon, for example, can be found attending municipal assemblies in Senlis alongside a number of men with whom he had attacked Ermenonville a quarter century before.⁵⁹ Lay seigneurial documents are scarce on the ground, but records from clerical sources, especially monastic ones, are overwhelmingly ample. Much of this material has not been sufﬁciently catalogued, if catalogued at all.⁶⁰ There can be no question of exhaustively examining these records, but with patience it is possible to ﬁnd Jacques and their opponents in them, especially in land transactions, rent and tithe lists, and lawsuits. From local documents, information emerges about Jacques’ and Jacques’ enemies’ property, family relationships, social networks, and sometime even a little bit about their personality. In 1398, we once more ﬁnd Arnoul Guenelon in Senlis: now 70, he is ‘a frail, old man of great age’, donating the vineyard he had bought with his wife Geneviève to the monks of Saint-Maurice in exchange for ⁵⁶ For the bishop of Beauvais’s temporal jurisdiction, see Chapter 7. ⁵⁷ ‘toutes ycelles males facons le seigneur de Montmorency . . . a pardonnee a lui et a touz autres qui en sa terre ont este aus diz faiz’ (AN JJ 86, no. 207, fol. 67v, ed.

For instance, the Jacques’ lieutenant Germain de Réveillon can be found in 1350 serving as the sworn clerk (tabellion juré) of Pont-Sainte-Maxence, a town in which he also acted on behalf of the rebellion.⁶² Fremin de Berne, recipient of a formulaic remission for Jacquerie at Beaumont-sur-Oise, later served as the warden of the seal for the same village’s provost.⁶³ Identifying the right people and understanding their relationships presents some challenges beyond the sheer mass of material. Arnoul de Guenelon, Germain de Réveillon, and Fremin de Berne all had distinctive names and the documents in which they appear offer further information corroborating their identities, but not every case is as clear-cut as these.⁶⁴ For example, the rebel named Jean Bernier, whose adventures in the Jacquerie are discussed in Chapter 4 is demonstrably not the same man as the royal counsellor Jean Bernier, for the latter already held the high ofﬁce of Maître des Requêtes in August 1358, when Jean Bernier the Jacques was leading Noyon’s city guard.⁶⁵ Tracing family adds another layer of difﬁculty. Fremin de Berne worked for the same authority as one Simon de Berne, the latter also serving as a captain of the Jacques in that area, but their surname ‘from Berne’, a nearby village, may indicate a relationship of past (and perhaps distant) proximity rather than a familial one.⁶⁶ ⁶¹ ‘homme faible ancient et de grant aage par quoy desormais il ne peut traveiller souffrir ne endurer aucune peine de corps ne a ses besoignes entendre en maniere que aucun proufﬁt lui en peust venir’ (AD Oise H 841). ⁶² AD Oise H 2439, no. 4; AN JJ 86, no. 309, fol. 103, ed.

The surname Calle (or Cale), borne by the Jacques’ general captain Guillaume Calle, was quite uncommon, as it remains in France today. It seems certain that an Isabelle ‘widow of Guillaume Calle’ who sued in 1361 for return of her dowry, given to a favourite of the count of Clermont, was his wife.⁶⁷ But, without corroborative information, we cannot be sure that a Thibaut Cale, who fought against the Anglo-Navarrese in 1359, or a Guérin Calle, who leased some farmland in 1369, were his relatives, let alone that William and John Calle, archers in the ﬁfteenth-century English army and active in Normandy, were his descendants.⁶⁸ The new information gleaned from these sources sometimes raises more questions than it answers.\n\nThe Stories in This Book The stories that I tell in this book are thus constructed out of a mass of incomplete and unruly evidence. Like crown’s judges and the chroniclers, I have had to determine what had happened and what it meant from sources that could not, or did not want to, tell me everything I wanted to know. Unlike them, I have access to mapping and relational database software that facilitates the collection and analysis of a relatively large amount of geographical and prosopographical detail.⁶⁹ This made possible the visualization, organization, and retrieval of information required to navigate a very complex event that occurred in many places over an extended period of time. While textual analysis is the bedrock of this book, I have set that analysis within the context of a larger picture aggregated from less textually-bound information. Pictures are worth a thousand words, and sometimes numbers tell a story clearer than, or different from, the texts themselves. The relationship between the analysis of collective data and the close reading of individual texts is necessarily a complementary one. Neither approach trumps the other. Every point on a map or entry in a database represents multiple interpretive decisions made through close reading. It is also imperative to remember that the collective picture drawn from the aggregated stories is not always a better guide to events than an individual story. Given that the sources are mendacious, generic, stereotyped, and incomplete, to ignore minority reports would be to miss some of\n\n⁶⁷ AN X1c 13b, no. 272, 274.

Moreover, and as I will stress again and again throughout this book, the Jacquerie was a collective event made up of individual experiences that changed over time. What the Picard coq du village did was not what the Norman carter saw or the champenois squire suffered. How someone understood what was happening on 28 May 1358 might have been very different from how she thought about it three weeks later or in 1372. I have already emphasized that the sources for the Jacquerie were all written after the revolt. It is also important to keep in mind that the revolt itself took place over a six-week period and went on considerably longer in some parts of the kingdom. There was plenty of time for interpretations, motivations, and loyalties to shift. What the Jacquerie meant for contemporaries was ﬂuid, depending on who or where they were, what they knew or thought had already happened, and what they hoped or feared might happen in the future. In writing this book, I have tried to retain some of that ﬂuidity, leaving open questions to which the sources do not provide deﬁnite answers and allowing contradictory evidence to point interpretation in different directions. The book’s largely chronological structure is intended to facilitate the understanding of ‘the revolt’ as a process, which unfolded over time in not-always predictable ways, as well as ‘a thing’ to which observers later ascribed meaning. The nature of the evidence and of the revolt itself nevertheless makes isolating chronological change during the revolt itself challenging. The ex post facto nature of the evidence means that we cannot directly observe shifts of intention or interpretation during the revolt. Trying to make inferences about chronological development on evidence such as targets attacked, spatial dispersion, communication with allies, and so on is hampered by the fact that almost none of the stories in either remissions or chronicles is exactly dated or datable. Only a few of the remissions give any speciﬁc information about chronology, most simply speaking of the ‘time of the non-nobles’ terror against the nobles’. The few dates available, used to construct the timeline in the front matter, tell only a small part of the story. Most of what is exactly datable are events that happened before or after the revolt, or incidents at which the country-folk and the Parisians and other towns’ citizens were acting together. Much of what happened did so simultaneously across a number of different theatres of action. In the chapters that follow, I have tried to keep a sense of change over time, while also drawing out thematic issues of the violence, identity, and organization that characterized the revolt overall. I begin with a chapter that tells the story of France, its politics, and its unfortunate people from just before the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 to the collapse of the modus vivendi between Marcel’s reform faction and the Prince’s counsellors soon after Charles of Navarre arrived in Paris in late 1357. The second chapter opens with the watershed moment in February 1358 when Marcel’s minions murdered two royal ofﬁcers in the Dauphin’s presence, and follows that act’s\n\nOUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 23/3/2021, SPi\n\n22\n\n   \n\nreverberations through the consolidation of a noble faction opposed to the reform government and the military preparations they undertook against Paris up to the eve of the Jacquerie’s outbreak in May. Chapter 3 looks at the military and political reasons behind the massacre of nine noblemen at Saint-Leu-d’Esserent on 28 May, and the links between this incident and Parisian interests. Chapter 4 considers how and why that massacre became the beginning of a massive social uprising, highlighting both long-term structural factors like demographic and economic change after the Black Death and more immediate political and military concerns, as well as individual and community relationships. Chapters 5 through 7 are devoted to thematic issues of the rebellion’s violence, which was considerably more targeted and limited that its reputation suggests; its remarkable leadership structure and logistical organization; and the uneasy alliances between different social groups that both made the revolt possible and led ultimately to its failure. I return to the chronological narrative in Chapter 8, which covers the joint Jacques-Parisian endeavours in the Paris Basin in the second week of June through the defeats at Meaux and Mello-Clermont. Chapter 9 traces the development of the Counter-Jacquerie after these battles and the spread of the revolt to Normandy, Champagne, and further aﬁeld. Chapter 10 focuses on the legal and social aftermath of the revolt following the death of Étienne Marcel and the Dauphin’s return to Paris, and the evolution of the conﬂict’s consequences in the years that followed. The Conclusion considers the revolt’s legacy and memorialization from the later fourteenth century to the present day.\n\nOUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 17/3/2021, SPi\n\n1 Complaints The Aftermath of Poitiers\n\nThe regions of France where the Jacquerie took place were the epicentre of a political disaster whose proximate cause was a military catastrophe. Since 1337, France and England had been at war, ostensibly over the English King Edward III’s claim to the French throne. His mother was the daughter of the French King Philippe IV (r. 1285–1314), whose last son King Charles IV had died without male issue in 1328 and put an end to the Capetian dynasty’s 300-year reign. The roots of the war with England reached back centuries and were at least as much about Edward’s lordship over the duchy of Gascony and England’s trade relations with Flanders as they were about his claim to be king of France. But while the Hundred Years War might have started as a strategic move in a limited enterprise, its opening decades had gone remarkably well for the English. A resounding victory on the battleﬁeld at Crécy at 1346 followed by the capitulation of Calais the next year was complemented by a strategy of raiding the countryside for supplies, booty, and sheer intimidation.¹ Already disadvantaged by not being Capetian, the ﬁrst Valois king of France Philippe VI (r. 1328–1350) suffered a grave loss of prestige. Worse, he lost the conﬁdence of the political elite who ran the kingdom. A near revolution saw his familiars imprisoned, his council reorganized, and his heir, the future Jean II (r. 1350–1364), nearly excluded.² Philippe regained his power, but note had been taken, a model outlined. A respite from English invasion allowing king and kingdom to regain their footing was the silver lining to the Black Death’s ﬁrst onslaught in 1347–1352.³ But in 1355 Edward Prince of Wales, one of the fourteenth century’s greatest soldiers, landed in Bordeaux and laid waste to a swath of Languedoc running from Gascony to Narbonne, while the French king’s ofﬁcers did nothing to stop him.⁴\n\n¹ Clifford J.

Parleys went nowhere. The next day, the French army was utterly routed in one of the great military defeats of French history.⁶ In addition to an unknowable number of common soldiers, nearly 2,500 noblemen died.⁷ Among them were some of France’s best military and political minds, like Geoffrey de Charny, in service to the crown since 1337, and Jean de Bourbon, Count of Clermont. Thousands more were captured and held to ransom, especially nobles who could fetch a high price.⁸ Worst of all, the captured included Jean II himself. Taken to England, his ransom was eventually set at an astronomical 4 million écus.⁹\n\nDefeat and its Discontents Even more than a ﬁnancial calamity, the captivity of King Jean was a political nightmare. His son and heir-apparent, Charles, was 18, inexperienced, and unreliable. Poitiers had deprived him of many of the crown’s most able advisors. As had happened after Crécy, the king’s favourite ofﬁcers were removed from power and a ‘reform party’ took over. The Dauphin Charles, styled his father’s ‘lieutenant’, worked off and on with the reformers over the next year and a half, but there were deep and lingering ﬁssures between them. Be they ever so rich, the shopkeepers and artisans who dominated the reformers were not the Dauphin’s usual company. This party also included many members who sympathized with King Charles II of Navarre. Charles of Navarre, who was also Count of Évreux in Normandy, was the grandson of King Louis X on his mother’s side, the greatgrandson of King Philippe III on his father’s side"
