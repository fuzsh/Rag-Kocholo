Today these archives are researched by scholars in and outside Malta for their studies, by students for their dissertations and exercises in old music editing, by music directors for revival concerts and by music publishers for recordings. This is all due to the initiative of the Cathedral Chapter and the Cathedral Museum Committee who have opened and promoted these archives to several musicologists who have in various ways assisted by sending their students and directed their research, and to music directors who were keen on promoting Malta’s musical heritage by editing and performing unknown works by Maltese composers. The authors of this publication would like to acknowledge the benefits of all these promoters. This publication consists of two parts: a number of studies and a handlist. The first two studies of Part I, by Mgr John Azzopardi, were completed in the past two months; they offer a brief description of the archives as augmented by the latest donations and a brief history of the cappella di musica in the light of the latest research, including the various publications of Dr Franco Bruni. Chapters three and five by Dr Matteo Sansone, analyse the 1 7 th and 1 8 th century contents of the archives while chapter four, by the same author, studies Azopardi’s treatise II Musico Pratico. These last three chapters were written several years ago when Dr Sansone was active in Malta lecturing in the Department of Italian at the University and keenly researching the archives. Since then Azopardi’s treatise has been studied by O. Brantley Adams in a published dissertation (1991 ) and by Dr Spiridione Buhagiar in two, so far unpublished, dissertations (1988 and 1999). Mro Buhagiar has recently taken on the position of maestro di cappella that was once held by Francesco Azopardi. Let us hope that he will also publish his disseration. Notwithstanding that their studies were written years ago, the authors of this publication feel that they are still valid today and deserve to be published. They would also like to thank two musicologists who have kindly read through the five studies of Part I and made valuable suggestions; these are Mr Joseph Vella Bondin for chapters one and two and Dr Jeffery Kurtzmann for chapters three, four and five. The handlist (Part II) is here included to support the contents of the studies forming Part I of this publiction. It was completed years ago together with the studies of chapters 3, 4 and 5. For a detailed catalogue the reader is referred to Dr Franco Bruni, Stampe Musicali italiane alia Cattedrale di Malta, Malta 1 999 for the Printed Works, and to the entries on csbsjv.edu/hmml/centers/malta/mdina.html (the website of St John’s University, Collegeville, Minnesota) for the Music manuscripts. 9 PREFACE The more majestic stone edifices - such as theatres - resemble at times giant musical instruments; even more so are the churches that regulate the tempo of life in the towns and the countryside with their ringing bells, their organ-playing and singing. The building itself acts only as a support for the belfries and a resounding hollow for voices and instruments. At the heart of every cathedral was to be found the chapel or cappella, understood as a schola cantorum. Although sited at the southern-most tip of Europe, the musical cappella of the Cathedral of Malta performed its sacri concern in the very best European tradition during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries - which one can describe as its golden age. The richness of its repertory is borne out by many surviving musical prints and manuscripts. They are all listed in the following pages according to modern bibliographical methods, and with detailed information. To the merit of the authors of this book, they have rediscovered and catalogued all that valuable music after putting it in order for the scrutiny of scholars. It is a notable event, even sensational, both because Malta has remained nearly unknown to musicology, without any of its archives figuring in the repertories of musical bibliography; and also because the Mdina Cathedral’s collection of old music is without doubt the most important that has been preserved south of Naples. One hundred fifty-nine musical prints have been preserved there; the oldest being Claudio Merulo’s fourth book of Messe d’intavolatura d’organo (Venice, 1568), followed by Giulio Oristagno’s Responsoria Nativitatis et Ephiphaniae Domini quae quatuor vocibus concinnuntur (Palermo, 1602); the most recent is the unicum of the Mottetti a una, due, tre e cinque voci (Rome, 1698) by Alessandro Melani, the very first to compose a melodrama on the myth of Don Giovanni and his “convitato di pietra”. But the major portion of these books fall in the six decades around the mid-century. They supply us indeed with the repertory of the Malta Cathedral chapel between the years of 1620 and 1680. The value of this collection stands enhanced on account of the substantial number of unique copies it contains, among them works by Sicilian authors whose memory has been lost:- such as Corrado Bonfiglio, chapel-master of the senate of Noto, and Andrea Rinaldi, who was formerly chapel-master in the Malta Cathedral and then at the Cathedral of Syracuse, his native town. Rinaldi’s Mottetti concertati a due, tre e quattro voci were published in Palermo, as were most of these unique copies. The other Palermitan prints contain works by Vincenzo Amato, Vincenzo D’Elia, Mariano di Lorenzo, Antonio La Greca and Giulio Oristagno - reported by Mongitore at the beginning of the eighteenth century, but otherwise lost - and moreover works by Giovanni Battista Fasolo and Bonaventura Rubino. Yet the oldest manuscripts are two antiphoners in late Aquitanian notation of the 1 2th- 13th century: the puncta (lozenge-shaped in the earlier codex, square and larger in the later) are usually on a staff of one ink line and three dry-point lines. In addition there are six large illuminated parchment choral books of the 16th century. 11 PREFACE The other manuscripts have preserved a large number of compositions by Maltese, Sicilian and Italian composers from the 17th to the beginning of the 19th centuries. Among these are seven pieces by Giacomo Carissimi, three of which are not otherwise preserved. Among the manuscripts there is a small collection of works by Vincenzo Amato, the most important Sicilian composer of his time - the uncle of Alessandro Scarletti and maybe his first musical teacher - among which is the famous “Passion according to Saint John”. This work had a truly singular success, remaining in the liturgy of Sicilian chapels continually for three centuries, in fact, until a few decades ago. We even have a report of its performance at Mayenne a few years before the outbreak of the French revolution. The other manuscripts of this work that have reached us are in fact late copies: the one at the Palermo conservatory - datable to the end of the 1 8th century - contains only the music for the evangelist (soprano) and for Christ (basso). The other, at Palermo too, is kept by Roberto Pagano - who identified with certainty the author of this anonymous Maltese mansucript. The role of the evangelist is here assigned to a tenor, while the polyphonic sections for the “turba” were “composed by the maestro Ignazio Schiavo in the year 1 889”. In yet another manuscript, also in the Pagono collection, the same music has been adapted for a parallel “Passion according to Saint Matthew”. Other XIX century manuscripts, newly discovered at Monreale, near Palermo, contain both these Passions. But now we have the 1 7th century manuscript at Mdina, which preserves the entire authentic score by Amato: here we find the recitative melodies of the Evangelist and Christ (tenors), of Pilate (contralto), and four-voice polyphony for the “turba”. The Maltese manuscript does not bear the author’s name, but the melodies for Christ and the evangelist are nearly identical to those found in the manuscripts at Palermo. The basso continuo agrees too, although it has passed through a process of modernization in the Palermitan manuscripts. No wonder we find some stanzas from Torquato Tasso’s Gerusalemme Liberata among the Maltese musical manuscripts. Tasso was a national prophet in Sicily, at the very frontiers of Christendom against Islam. The printer of the senate of Palermo, Giovan Battista Maringo, published many books of polyphonic madrigals on Tasso’s poems in the first decade of the 17th Century. Antonio il Verso, the eminent Palermitan composer, set two books of madrigals on Tasso’s poem, apart from six cycles from the Gerusalemme that feature in another four of his madrigal collections, which total twenty-three books. At Mdina we now find from the great Tassian poem, the Dialogo di Sofrania et Olindo, beginning with Poscia che'l re crudel (eleventh stanza in the second canto), set for four voices and basso continuo by Don Francesco Fiamengo. Of this Messanese priest we previously had only one book (incomplete in one section) of Pastorali concenti alpresepe co’ responsori della sacra notte del Natale di Nostro Signore, a due, tre, quattro, cinque e sei voci, co'l basso continuo, opera terza (Venice, 1637), a book of Cantate a tre voci (Messina, 1632) and one of Messe concertate (1636 or 1637), besides information about this two earlier works, now lost. As regards the Maltese musicians, many of their works are kept at the Mdina Cathedral Museum - in fact, there are works of whole dynasties of composers, such as Balzano, Zerafa, Bugeja, Nani, Vella, Camilleri and Scicluna composers, from the 17th to the 20th century. Malta was part of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1091 to 1798. The musical cappella of its Cathedral during its golden age was one of the best Sicilian cappelle. Now it is the only 12 PREFACE one whose musical archives have been preserved - besides the nearly complete administrative records. Much works awaits musicologists, especially Sicilians. The project for publishing the corpus of Musiche Rinascimentali Siciliane, which was planned to contain some sixty volumes has suddenly grown by another dozen. Fortunately considerable progress has been achieved in recent years in the study of the history of music in Malta and its very close ties with Sicily and Naples.

He is the author of various publications on history and especially art history, music and the archives. He also edited and contributed in a number of exhibition catalogues. MATTEO SANSONE Ph.D.(Edin.) is an expert on operatic literature and his special field is late ninteenth-century Italian opera on which he has published several studies. He runs the opera courses at the British Institute of Florence. He was active in Malta as lecturer in Italian at the University between 1 978 and 1 980 when he researched the musical archives of the Cathedral. 16 PART I STUDIES Chapter I The Music Archives at the Cathedral Museum, Mdina - Malta - Their Contents, Provenance and Study 19 Chapter II The Cappella di Musica of the Cathedral Church of Malta 93 Chapter III Maltese Music: Italian Affiliation and Original Achievements 111 Chapter IV Azopardi’s Treatise II Musico Pratico 123 Chapter V The Neapolitan Church Style in the Masses of Zerafa and Azopardi 1 39 17 CHAPTER I THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA-MALTA Their Contents, Provenance and Study JOHN AZZOPARDI A collection of music scores extant for many years in the Mdina Cathedral Sacristies was transferred to the baroque palace of the Old Seminary in 1968 prior to its official opening on 4 January 1969 as the Cathedral Museum. The collection now forms part of the rich, multiform archives preserved there and available for research 1 . On their transfer, the scores were re-classified by composer 2 . During the course of this demanding exercise, works by Maltese composers, whose names had been completely forgotten, came to light. Among these were the two oldest extant compositions by identified Maltese composers, both chapel masters of the Cathedral, namely the motet Beatus Vir dated 1652 and some psalms by Giuseppe Balzano and the motet Venite Omnes dated 1680 by his brother Domenico 3 . A number of initiatives were immediately taken by the Museum to evaluate and make known the scores; these included research on unknown and less familiar composers, exhibitions of selected scores, revival concerts of edited works, lectures and documentary exhibitions on the life and works of some of the more important composers. The end result was extremely rewarding. Private collectors started to donate scores in their possession, often amounting to substantial collections, to the archives. Local and foreign scholars discovered that the manuscript and old printed scores which formed part of the collection contained unsuspected uniques and shed light on musical activity not only in Malta but also in Italy and especially in Sicily. International musicologists began to research the archives, publishing information about them abroad 4 and sending their students to prepare dissertations on the available material. The microfilm project initiated in 1973 jointly with St John’s University, Minnesota, facilitated the study of the scores outside Malta. The advantage of having, concurrently with the music scores, ample historical documentation in the museum archives on the running of the Mdina Cathedral cappella 1 . The suggestion had been made by Chev. Vincenzo Bonello. 2. The original arrangement was by subject (masses, vespers, hymns, antiphons, etc.) As these archives had not been in use for many years, and were conserved in heaps with hardly any order, it took some time and effort to organize them. At the Cathedral, these archives were under the custody of the music deputies, not the archivist. 3. No mention of these two composers could be traced in any of the available literature on Maltese music written up to then. 4. Cfr Paolo Emilio Carapezza, “La Sicilia ritrova a Malta le sue musiche” in L'Ora, Palermo, 7 July 1979. 19 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA di musica over a period of four centuries increased the importance of the collection. It was soon realised that historically the cappella was one of the most important south of Naples. Various studies have now been published, not only on the collections but also on the cappella. The cappella and its archives have featured as a theme in seminars and international conferences 5 . Composer Carmelo Pace (1906-1993) after donating all his works, instituted a Foundation, under the care of the Museum, for the continued promotion of his music. A major initiative was the production of CDs featuring the performance of works in the archives by International Childrens’ and other Choirs, by Studio SM of Paris and other organizations in collaboration with the Cathedral Museum 6 . The music archives can be grouped into three categories: Choral Books, Printed Works and Manuscript Scores. These are available as originals and also on microfilm as part of a bigger collection which includes scores conserved by Religious Orders, Parishes and private owners. Available handlists and catalogues complement the collection. CHORAL BOOKS The antiphonaries The oldest works in the archives are two antiphonaries, marked A and B, on parchment written in Aquitanian notation on a staff of one red and three dry-point lines. Unfortunately they are incomplete. Codex A starts with the Fourth Sunday of Lent while codex B does not have the Common of the Saints or the Liturgy of the Dead. 7 Both have decorated initials; Codex B has 51 of these, coloured in red and bluish green 8 . The provenance of these two codices is unknown. There is a clear indication however that they belonged to a religious Congregation that recited nine psalms instead of three during Easter Week 9 . An early reference to these codices may be traced in the oldest extant inventory of the Cathedral Library, registered in the Acts of Notary Bonaventura de Bonetiis of 19 April 1543 10 as well as in the Angevin inventory of the chapel of St Mary, in the castrum maris of Birgu, dated 1274\" . This is clear proof of their great antiquity. Though mentioned in a few publications of a rather popular character, these codices have only recently attracted the attention of music palaeographers. Peter Jeffery of Princeton University, New Jersey, in a study published in 1979 wrote 5. Italy (Naples, Palermo, Caltagirone), U.K.and the U.S.A . 6. Cfr Appendix 8. 7. Some of the missing pages may have been utilised as backing material for the repair of other choral books in Malta. A choral book at St John’s Co-Cathedral Museum was repaired with leafs written in a similar notation. The recovery of these pages through a proper restoration is worth considering. 8. For a comparative list of the contents of these two unpublished antiphonaries see appendix 1. 9. Cfr J.Azzopardi, The Cathedral Museum, Mdina-Malta, Malta 1990, p.9 10. ACM, Misc. 218 ( Inventaria Ecclesiae Cathedralis Melitensis): “Item sei volumi di antiphoneri tre feriali” 11. Laurenza V., “Malta nei documenti angioini del. R. Archivio di Napoli”, Archivio Storico di Malta, v 1- 4 (1934) 103-171; doc. XL; p. 134: antifoneria vetera duo. 20 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA that “particularly interesting are the two antiphoners from Malta that are written in an unusual type of Aquitanian notation, The puncta in the earlier codex are lozenge-shaped, usually on a staff of one ink line and three dry point lines. The climacus often acends at a slight angle, instead of at the vertical. A and D clefs outnumber F and C clefs. The later antiphoner also uses A and D clefs, but has the larger, square puncta of later Aquitanian notation. The notational characteristics of these two antiphoners can be seen in some manuscripts from south-eastern France. The relationship between the French and the Maltese manuscripts deserves to be studied at greater length” 12 . Prof. Victor Huglo of the Department of Medieval Musical Palaeography of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (IV Section), Sorbonne, has investigated further this French relationship. He dated Codex B from the first half of the 12 th century and Codex A from the middle or second half of the 13 th century. He stressed the close similarity with Codex LH 1 83 of Marseilles Cathedral and as far as initials are concerned with the Graduate of Norbonne in Paris BN, Vat 780. He also located Codex B to the inferior valley of the Rhine 13 . Finally Prof. Nicole Sevestre of Bordeaux University has examined in great detail and transcribed Codex B which she hopes to publish, together with a preliminary study, in the near future 14 . The Royas Graduals The choral books in the Archives also include the six large graduals on parchment commissioned by Bishop Martin Royas (1566-1577) on behalf of the Cathedral Chapter to a Dominican Friar, Fra Salvator Ferrarius di Bisignano who executed them in 1573 in Pozzuoli. The commission of these skilfully executed choral books is definitely related to the Tridentine Reform. The text is in Gothic script. Each volume, with the exception of one, has a decorated first folio with an illuminated border, a historiated initial and the arms of Bishop Royas 15 . Their illuminations have been recently studied by Martina Caruana 16 who detected a strong similarity in style with the 1 582 interventions on the L’lsle Adam choral books preserved at St John’s Co-Cathedral in Valletta. 12. P. Jeffery, “ Musical Manuscripts on Microfilm in the Hill Monastic Library at St John’s Abbey and University”, Notes, (USA) vol. 35 (1978-9), pp. 7-30. 13. Personal correspondence with Prof. Huglo. 14. The initiative for this study was taken by Prof. Alain Blondy of Sorbonne University, Paris IV. Prof. Sevestre has now been working on this project for several years. 1 5. The arms carry the bishop’s motto: In fornace tamquam aurum. There is ample documentation on the lengthy discussions between the Cathedral Chapter and Bishop Royas on the commission and payment of these graduals. 16. M.Caruana, The L’lsle Adam Illuminated Manuscripts and Other Illuminated Choral Books in Malta, Malta 1 997, pp. 43-46. The author attempted to interpret the figure in profile of a bust of a bearded monk in one of the historiated initials as being a portrait of the scribe Bisignano or a fellow Dominican colleague. 21 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA The Gargallo and Other Choral Books Two smaller antiphonaries on parchment are also conserved and exhibited in the Museum. They bear the arms of Malta and have an illuminated initial with the arms of Bishop Gargallo. Cathedral inventories compiled from time to time listed the Church’s choral books then extant 17 . A study of these books, mostly preserved in the Cathedral Sacristies, would be useful. THE PRINTED WORKS A study of the collection of 16 ,h and 17 ,h cent, printed works in the Cathedral Museum Music Archives, by Dr Matteo Sansone, is included in Chapter 3, infra. Moreover a detailed catalogue of the collection was published in 1999 by Dr Franco Bruni under the title Stampe Musicali Italiane alia Cattedrale di Malta. Storia e Catalogo della Collezione (ACM, Mus.Pr. 1-159).' 8 To avoid repetitions, I shall here limit myself to a few statistics and some additional information. In its present state and as presently archived, this collection contains 159 works (marked Pr 1 to Pr 159) 19 . Apart from 20 works of secular music, 15 of which were published in Venice, the collection consists of sacred music, which reflects its intended liturgical use. Its 883 partbooks include 107 complete works, 52 incomplete works with 117 missing partbooks and a considerable number of duplicate partbooks. About 20 works, presumably those in more frequent liturgical use, are available in full duplicate. It is evident that the missing partbooks, like other works documented as extant in a repertory compiled round 171 0 20 , are now lost. The oldest and only 16 th century work in the collection, by Claudio Merulo, is dated 1568 and was published in Venice. Next oldest is a composition by Giulio Oristagno published in Palermo in 1602. Both are incomplete. The ‘youngest’ work, composed by Alessandro Melani, was printed in Rome in 1698. 135 of the 159 prints were published between 1624 and 1678. With the exception of two, all were published in Italy (Rome, Venice, Bologna, Naples, Milan, Modena, Messina and Palermo). The non-Italian prints consist of works by French composers and were published in Paris, that by Du Caurroy in 1610 and that by Du Mont in 1652. The publishers represented total 39 21 . Included are 18 anthologies, 12 compiled by Florido de Silvestri of which one (Pr 61) is a collection 17. The inventories are archived as Misc. 218-222 of the Cathedral Archives. 18. Other studies on this collection by Bruni include his unpublished ‘tesi di diploma’, Studio e catalogo della collezione di stampe musicali della Cattedrale di Malta ( Mus. Pr, 1 -159), Scuola speciale per archivisti e Bibliotecari, Universita’ La Sapienza, Rome, 1994 and the essay “Edizioni rare e unica del seicento nella cattedrale di Malta’ in Nuova Rivista Musicale Italiana , 3 (1995) 505-527. 19. In the present enumeration three duplicate works (Floridus Pr 52 and 53; Foggia Pr 62 and 63; Mazzocchi Pr104 and 105) were each given two different numbers. But two works in different editions ( Bernardi 9a and 9b and Graziani 88a, 88b, 88c) were given the same number. If successive editions or reprints are considered as different works, the total consequently remains 159 works. 20. This repertory is fully transcribed in appendix 4. 21. For a list of these publishers see appendix 2. 22 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA of madrigals. Four works of motets or psalms, three by Bonifacio Graziani 22 and one by Stefano Bernardi 23 are available in different editions or reprints. The title-page of each partbook has a very attractive decorative element. Generally an ornamental frame encloses the title-page text. The centre-piece often carries the coat- of-arms of the artistic patron. Holy images are also frequent. They include St Petronius (Prs 30-32), St Anthony of Padua (Pr 15), the Immaculate Conception (Pr 91), the Nativity (Prs 44, 116) and the Virgin adoring the Child (Pr.40). The name of the artist or engraver has been detected in five cases: Ciro Ferri (Pr 94), F. Niger (Pr 124), Campanile (Pr 1 13 and 115) and Thiboust (Pr 92). The texts of the dedications of the prints to patrons are at times very revealing and the patrons include members of the Order of St John. Gratiani’s Libro Quinto de' Motetti a voce sola (Pr 82), is dedicated to Fra Giovanni Battista Mocchi, Knight of the Order of St John and chapel master of the Duke of Neuberg. In it reference is made to the poetic activities of this Knight in Malta and to a visit commissioned by the Landgrave of Hassia 24 . Two anthologies by Floridus are dedicated to Fra Jacob de Cardon d’Eviev, ambassador of the Order to the Holy See (Pr 50) and to Don Carlo De Lornay De Menton, knight of St John (Pr 51). Perhaps the collection’s major merit lies in the considerable number of unique works or editions or partbooks it contains. Their identification was the result of research in international reference works undertaken with the help of Prof. Paolo Emilio Carapezza of Palermo, Oscar Mischiati of Bologna and Dr Jeffery Kurtzman of the U.S.A. 25 Carapezza’s first visit coincided with an exhibition of the collection’s title pages organized by the Cathedral Museum with the help of Dr Matteo Sansone 26 . The majority of the unique prints was published in Sicily. The Sicilian element in the collection was highlighted in two Seminars, one held in Caltagirone 27 in 1985 and the other in Malta in 1986 28 . A table of these uniques was published by Bruni in 1999 29 . An updated list of these uniques is here included as Appendix 3. This update follows the results of further checking and the discovery 30 of an incomplete copy in Spello (Italy) of Bartolomeo Rubino’s Salmi da vidici.. op. VII (Palermo 1658), previously considered unique . As suggested by Carapezza 31 this list is divided in three sections: unique works, unique editions and unique partbooks. 22.

It is Pr 124 and consists of motets composed by Don Andrea Rinaldi, chapel master in Syracuse 32 , previously active in the Mdina Cathedral between 1627 and 1631 33 . MANUSCRIPT SCORES This section of the music archives can be grouped as follows: a) Scores by Italian composers, 17 th to 19 th cent. b) Anthologies by an unknown compiler c) Unattributed scores d) Scores by Maltese composers recovered from the Cathedral Church in 1968 e) Scores donated to the Cathedral Museum and Library after 1968 f) Scores from other collections available only on microfilm. g) Additional material. Scores by Italian composers, 17 th to 19 ,h cent, (mss 1 to 110) This section, while including some Masses and Vespers, is particularly rich in motets. It also includes 24 secular pieces. Among the more important composers represented are the Sicilian Vincenzo Tozzi with 33 works ( 24 sacred works with Latin or Italian text and 9 secular works with Italian text) 34 ; Vincenzo Amato with 1 0 scores including the earliest and complete copy of Passio secundum loannem 35 ; Giacomo Carissimi with seven pieces including two unique motets, Ecce Deus Noster ( ms 1 3) and O bone Jesu (ms 14) 36 and the unique contrafactum by Monteverdi Ecce Panis Angelorum (ms 47), an adaptation of the canzonetta Chiome d’orcP 7 from his seventh book of madrigals. Anthologies by an unknown compiler (mss 111-119) This homogeneous group of nine manuscript anthologies is made up of 87 motets (which include three duplicates) and seven psalms in 39 partbooks. Only three anthologies are complete: contained therein are 35 motets. The remaining six anthologies have one or more parts missing. They have the same size, format and quality of paper 32. “maestro di cappella della fidelissima citta’ di Siracusa”. 33. Cfr J.Azzopardi, ‘The activity and works of Andrea Rinaldi and Antonio Campochiaro’, An evening of music and poetry at St John's Co-Cathedral, 22 September 1985, pp. 35-39. 34. These scores are being edited and studied by Irene Calagna, who worked in the archives for a few months. 35. Identified by Roberto Pagano in 1978, following a visit to the Cathedral Museum. 36. Not included in “Giacomo Carissimi, catalogo delle opere attribuitef, Finarte 1 975. 37. First performed by Mro Joseph Vella in Gozo on 13 July 1984. In the Museum’s score the Basso part is missing. 24 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA but recurrent in the text are the same grammatical mistakes, particularly the use of the singular for the plural ( voce for voci, autore for autori) and also the same spelling mistakes ( fasta for festa), even in names of composers ( Ceccelli for Cecchelli, Chifra for Cifra). Thirty-five items in these nine anthologies are copied from printed works extant in the Cathedral archives 38 . This group is particularly interesting for three main reasons : there is an apparently unique motet by Carissimi, Dominus llluminatio mea for two soprani (ms 116); three composers - Atanasio da Pisticci, Paolo Agostini and Domenico Borgianni - are present in the Mdina collection only through these anthologies; and finally there are five works by a certain Aloysio Mataron, who so far has not been traced anywhere else. Two of these five works, Dulcis Amor and Salve Regina 39 are complete while the remaining three (Gaudeamus, Confitebor and Lauda Jerusalem ) are not. The anthologies could be a local compilation made for routine use during liturgical functions since, with the exception of the five scores by Mataron, the contents seem to be copies of printed works. Thus, according to Franco Bruni 40 , nine of the 17 motets contained in Ms. 118 are copied from Floridus, Modulorum ortus... 3a selectio (Rome 1647) while 26 other works are copies of musical prints in the Mdina Collection published between 1634 and 1660. The copy (ms 114) of Foggia’s motet Virginis Deiparae (Pr. 59) is transported while Marcioni’s motet Quasi Stella matutina in Pr 59 is unattributed in ms 117. Who was Aloysio Mataron? A person by that name has been traced in the parish records of Victoriosa and Valletta as having been active in mid-17 ,h cent. Malta, but the information found does not indicate that he was a composer. Further information in the marriage records of Valletta indicates that on 7 October 1650 Magnifico Aloysio Mataron, son of the late Giacchi and Aluisetta (1589-1669) of Marseilles married Aloysia Ghimes (1625- 1700) of Victoriosa. The marriage took place at St James’s Church in Valletta where the new family settled. Aloysio had two children, Stefano (1652-1714) and Anna (born 1655). Stefano was ordained priest in Catania on 13 March 1678 41 and served at St Paul’s Parish Church Valletta, together with his uncle Don Carlo Ghimes. These data suggest a conjecture. The grammatical and spelling mistakes in the anthologies could point to a person whose native language was probably French, as seems to be the case with Mataron, writing in Italian. The insertion of five motets by Mataron, untraced as a composer anywhere else, in a series of anthologies made up of items copied from musical prints extant in Malta at that time could indicate that Aloysio Mataron produced these anthologies and included in them his own scores 42 . 38. For details see appendix 7. 39. The Salve Regina is inscribed Sig.Luigio. Prof. Lionnet of Paris transcribed this work and tried to establish a connection with the composer Luigi Rossi. The result was in the negative. 40. F. Bruni in his book Stampe musicali italiane alia Cattedrale di Malta, Malta 1 999 notes under each entry any manuscript copies available in the archives. 41. The see of Malta was then vacant, following the death of Bishop L. Astiria on 3 January 1677. 42. The compiler is inconsistent in writing his own name: Aloysio (ms 113); Sig.Luigio (ms 113); musu Mataron (ms 114); Aluigio Mataron and Luigio Mataron (ms 119) . The same inconsistency is evident even in the official parish records : Mataron, Matarona, Maltalun; so also Aluis, Aluisio, Aluisetta, Aloijsietta. More details in appendix 6. 25 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA If this conjecture is ever established, then the Dulcis Amor of ms 113, dated 1650, would coincide with the date of Mataron’s marriage. The motet was revived with great success by Mro Joseph Vella in 1980 when a documentary exhibition on the Mataron family was also held at the Cathedral Museum 43 . Unattributed scores. This section of 142 unattributed scores includes not only liturgical works, among them three anthologies of motets 44 but also a number of non-liturgical compositions consisting of dialogues 46 , cantatas 46 , pastoral themes 47 and a cantilena 48 . There are no secular themes and, with the exception of four in Italian 49 , the texts are in Latin 50 . Only 8 are dated, the oldest being a 1667 motet for 8 voices. The whole group originally formed part of the Cathedral’s repertory of works up to the end of the 18 th cent, and contained works composed for celebrations specific to the Mdina Cathedral, such as the procession in honour of St Gregory held on Easter Wednesday 51 . Some 19 th and early 20 lh cent, anonymous scores were, later on, added to the collection. The majority of the scores have the same format, the same quality of paper and the same handwriting. This handwriting is identical to the only existing score inscribed and dated Giuseppe Balzano 1652 62 . This could indicate that this section includes unattributed scores by Giuseppe Balzano. This supposition is based on an extant 1710 list 53 of compositions by Balzano which includes works with exactly the same titles, number of voices and specifications (e.g. a 2 chori con sinfonia). Perhaps Balzano did not bother to sign his works as they were intended for personal use. Or else that he himself or another scribe copied the scores partly from Balzano’s own compositions and partly from other available printed or manuscript sources. There are other indications which support the same conclusion. The 1 71 0 list indicates that Balzano composed a cantata Det tuba, 8 v. con sinfonia. An unattributed score with the same specifications is extant in ms 161 . Such a cantata with a non-liturgical text would have been composed for a particular occasion and commissioned to a particular composer. Dat Tuba was written in honour of St Francis Xavier. On the saint’s festivities, the Collegium Melitense run by the Jesuits in Malta organized great celebrations in his 43.

See appendix 4 26 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA honour 54 . It is known that Giuseppe Balzano performed the music on feastdays in this Collegium 65 . Two attempts to identify the composers in the anonymous collection have been made by the Music Department of the University of Malta. In 1991 a number of unattributed scores with the same titles and specifications of the Balzano scores listed in the 1710 repertory were edited and analysed by Natasha Chircop under the direction of Mro Joseph Vella 56 . Basing her analysis on the known Balzano work, Chircop concluded that in all likelihood the works were by Balzano. Thirteen of these scores are now recorded on CD 57 . Furthermore Dr Franco Bruni has identified the composer of two scores and attributed 12 others. From extant prints he identified ms 123 as being the work of Rubino (Pr. 135) and ms 134 as the work of Monteverdi (Pr. 111) 58 . Basing his conclusions on information contained in the the 1710 manuscript repertory, Bruni attributed ms 155 to Marotta, ms 189a to Filippo Muscari and mss 161, 163, 165, 205and 208 to Giuseppe Balzano. In addition, he has proposed Pietro Gristi as the composer of ms 151 a/579 59 ; Giuseppe Balzano as the composer of mss 171 and 194 and his brother Domenico as the composer of mss 164 and 173. Scores by known Maltese composers recovered from the Cathedral Church in 1968 This section of the music archives consists of 1) three signed scores by the earliest known Maltese composers, namely Giuseppe Balzano (1616-1700) and his brother Domenico (1632-1707) 2) an extensive collection of scores by Don Benigno Zerafa (1726-1804) 3) another extensive collection of works by Francesco Azopardi (1748-1809) 4) about 50 scores by other composers 1 ) The Balzano Scores (mss 240-242) The year 1969 was a landmark in the history of Maltese music because it saw the discovery of the two earliest works written by named Maltese composers. They are a motet Beatus Vir dated 1652 composed by Giuseppe Balzano and another motet Venite Omnes dated 1680 by his younger brother Domenico. There is also another work by Giuseppe Balzano Salmi ad otto voci but this is incomplete and undated 60 . The discovery of these scores therefore makes the Balzano brothers the first two known Maltese composers in the annals of Maltese musical history. 54.

Cfr Joseph Vella, “A Tale of two Motets\" in The Sunday Times of Malta , Christmas Supplement, 4 December 1977. 27 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA Giuseppe and Domenico were born in Valletta and both had connections with the Order of St John: both served as “musici salariati” in the musical chapel of the Order’s Conventual Church 61 ; Giuseppe had also been proposed by the Grand Master as organist for the Church of St Lawrence at Victoriosa, but this nomination did not meet the approval of the Bishop 62 who probably had already formed the intention of appointing him music director of the Cathedral. Born in 1616, Giuseppe was ordained priest in 1640 in Catania 63 and for twenty years performed his pastoral duties at St Paul’s Shipwreck Church in Valletta. In 1660 he was appointed maestro di cappella of the Cathedral and started to live, together with his brother Domenico, in Mdina. Giuseppe directed the cappella of the Cathedral from 1660 to 1697 except for two short periods, between 1665-9 when he was replaced by the Maltese Ortensio Benini and between 1673-4 when he was replaced by Guglielmo Mortulana. It is not know what he did during these intervals. He relinquished his post when at the age of 83 he was substituted by his brother Domenico who directed the cappella from 1698 to 1707. Giuseppe was a prolific composer and his output includes 1 8 masses, 70 vesper parts, 36 hymns and 51 motets. He donated his scores to the Cathedral as did his brother Domenico, a less prolific composer 64 . Their output was listed in the 1 71 0 inventory which forms part of the archives and is being fully transcribed in this publication 65 . The Beatus Vir of 1 652 , strongly influenced by the music of Monteverdi 66 was composed prior to Giuseppe’s appointment as chapel master of the Cathedral, when he was still enrolled among the clergy of St Paul’s in Valletta. Likewise Domenico’s motet Venite Omnes of 1 680 was composed prior to Domenico’s official assignment as director of the Mdina chapel in 1698. As has already been pointed out above, a number of works from the unattributed scores can now be safely ascribed to Giuseppe and Domenico Balzano. 67 2) The Zerafa scores (mss 243 to 334) The extant oeuvre of Benigno Zerafa (1726-1804) in the Cathedral Archives amounts to 91 manuscripts of sacred music. These scores constitute the typical output of a maestro di cappella for Zerafa wrote them for execution during the titular and other feasts, processions and special devotions of the liturgical calendar celebrated in the Cathedral 68 , and also for the occasional special events celebrated there such as the installation of a new Bishop 69 or Grand Master 70 .

Zerafa’s full scores are mostly autograph, often carrying at the end a thanksgiving note for heavenly help received 72 ; most of the parts were however transcribed by one or more scribes. Zerafa, after serving as soprano under Mro Don Pietro Gristi in the Cathedral, was in 1738, at the age of 13, advanced financial support by the Cathedral Chapter to study music at the Conservatorio dei Poveri di Gesu Cristo in Naples 73 under Feo and the Maltese Girolamo Abos. On his return to Malta 1744 74 , at the age of 18, Zerafa applied for the vacant post of the Cathedral’s maestro di cappella and supported his applications with certificates from Naples including one from Abos which attested his outstanding abilities as director and composer and extolled the merits of the two compositions which Zerafa had already sent to Malta, namely a Mass and the Psalm Dixit, both composed for two choirs in 1743. The music deputies recommended the application 75 and Zerafa was given the appointment. He continued his studies for the priesthood until 1750, the year of his ordination. Besides conducting and composing polyphonic music, Zerafa organized and directed the Cathedral’s school of music 76 , occasionally composed 77 and taught canto fermo 78 , and during some celebrations played the violoncello with the orchestra 79 . In 1755 Zerafa strengthened the Cathedral’s cappella by purchasing, with a loan from the Chapter, two trombe di caccia from Germany and two oboes from Naples 80 . He was also occasionally asked to give advice on the purchase of a new organ 81 or on the location of a new organ loft 82 and to report on the abilities of an applicant for a post in the cappella 83 . 71. As in the case of Gaetano Marino in 1776, discussed in the chapter meeting of 13 February 1776. Cfr Reg. Del. Cap. 10, ff. 144-5. 72. Generally “La us Deo, Beatae Mariae Virgini et Sancto Pauld'. In other cases Zerafa includes St Benedict or the souls in Purgatory. 73. The amount was 165 scudi, deductable from his salary after he returned. 74. Zerafa returned to Malta from Naples on 1 1 September 1744 on the Tartana San Francesco di Paola which travelled from Marseilles, Naples and Castellammare to Malta. This information from the National Archives at Rabat was kindly supplied by Mr Joseph Muscat. 75. Zerafa’s application , the recommendation of the two music deputies of the Cathedral and the certificates from Naples are archived in CEM, AO, vol. 294, ff. 265-7. 76. Zerafa’s attestation on the school he had instituted was read in the Chapter meeting of 5 December 1786 .Cf. Reg. Del. Cap. 12, f.41 r. 77. In 1756 Zerafa composed in ‘canto fermo’ the New Office of Our Lady of Sorrows., Cfr Chapter meetings of 3 October and 30 November 1756. 78. On 1 9 November 1 751 Zerafa was exempted from teaching Gregorian chant. Cfr Acta Rev.Cap. 7, p.456. 79. Zerafa’s ability in playing the violoncello and controbasso was extolled by the deputies who recommended his appointment. Dr Franco Bruni traced several receipts for performances in which Zerafa took part as violinist in 1760. 80. The two oboes cost over 21 scudi and the trombe di caccia over 26 scudi. 81 Chapter meeting of 4 September 1773: a highly interesting attestation by Zerafa on the purchase of a new portable organ for the Cathedral. In his report Zerafa compared this organ with three newly purchased organs in Rabat, located at St Publius' Church, St Paul’s Parish Church, and the Dominican Priory. 82. The Pastoral Visit of Bishop Bartolomeo Rull carries an erudite report by Zerafa on the location of a new organ following a controversy that had arisen in the Naxxar Parish. Cfr Decretum de collocatione novi organ!. 83. It was common practice to seek the advice of the maestro di cappella and the deputies before employing a singer or an instrumentalist in the Cathedral.. 29 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA In addition, Benigno Zerafa directed music on feastdays in various other churches, particularly in St Paul’s Grotto in Rabat where his brother , procurator and personal assistant, Fra Giovanni Battista, was maestro di chord 34 , in the Carmelite Priory, Mdina and in the Benedictine Nunnery of St Peter at Mdina, where the Cathedral Chapter celebrated on feastdays. It was on the feastday of St Benedict in this church that Zerafa introduced the castrato Gaetano Marino, thus providing an opportunity to the Cathedral Chapter to judge Marino’s ability. 85 On 22 January 1778, before Notary Francesco Glison, Zerafa was contracted by the Dominican Priory of Victoriosa to construct for the priory’s church an organ with ten registers. It was to be completed within four years at the price of 650 scudi and the donation of the old organ to Zerafa himself. Later however Zerafa was compelled to renounce the contract. 86 Zerafa’s difficult character and his weak health were a cause of concern to the bishop and the Cathedral Chapter’s music deputies. In 1751, during a Pastoral Visit, Bishop Alpheran de Bussan , in his prudent judgement, decided to remove Zerafa from the post of chapel master. The Chapter was then informed that a new foreign maestro would accept the appointment if the Chapter gave him a salary of 200 scudi, which was 40 scudi more that normally paid. 87 The Chapter agreed but for some unknown reason the appointee never turned up. In 1753 Bishop Alpheran reinstated Zerafa 88 with the raised salary. During a Chapter meeting in December 1783, the two music deputies referred to Benigno Zerafa’s many infirmities 89 and proposed that he be pensioned off and replaced by organist Francesco Azopardi, but the Chapter did not take a decision on the matter. But in 1787 after 43 years of service, Zerafa himself offered his resignation which the Chapter accepted. On his resignation, Zerafa, by a notarial deed, donated to the Cathedral Church his sacred music consisting of “Masses, Psalms, Hymns, Introits, Litanies and Motets” 90 . We are not sure whether or not he composed more works after that date or how many other works he composed in addition to those extant in the Cathedral Archives. The only other work traced so far is a Requiem Mass for 4 voices dated 4 March 1766 which is conserved in the musical archives of St Paul’s Grotto 91 . The works we know of are all 84. Zerafa directed the music of the principal feasts in this church from 1760 to 1784. 85. Zerafa’s services in St Peter’s Nunnery at Mdina are recorded in the series Conti Provicariali kept at the Cathedral Museum, Mdina. 86. “si vidde impossibilitato di compir i'opera”.

It is hard to believe that such a gifted composer never wrote any orchestral or secular music 92 . 3) The Azopardi scores ( mss 335 to 584) Zerafa’s fame and ability was overshadowed, even in his own lifetime, by Francesco Azopardi, (1748-1809), a prolific composer of the Neapolitan school, brought over from Naples after completing his studies in the Conservatorio di Sant’Onofrio a Capuana and employed as organist following the sudden death in Naples of Don Benigno’s nephew, Vincenzo Zerafa, who had held the incumbency. Azopardi’s appointment and terms of reference, however, included more responsibilities than those normally assigned to the organist: he was required to teach, compose and perform sacred music and was given the right to succeed to the post of the Cathedral’s maestro di cappella as and when it became vacant. But owing to the infirmities of Benigno Zerafa, he was the de facto director of the cappella even before he officially took over this post in 1873. Azopardi enjoyed the respect of the Bishop, the Cathedral Chapter and the general public. After the expulsion of the Order from Malta in 1798, Azopardi was the first director to assume the responsibilty of conducting music in both the Mdina Cathedral and in St John’s Church in Valletta where, however, he was often substituted by Pietro Paolo Bugeja, his successor as maestro di cappella of both churches. Azopardi seems to have been a more prolific composer than Zerafa and his oeuvre of 250 works preserved in the music archives was purchased by the Chapter from his sister Teresa for the sum of 1000 scudi 93 after his death. It includes a few symphonies besides sacred music. The list of Azopardi’s works given by Mgr Paolo Pullicino in his 1876 biography of the composer 94 included more secular pieces, among which an opera buffa La magica Lanterns? 5 and an oratorio La Passione di Cristo written in 1 802 to a libretto by Pietro Metastasio and twice performed at the Manoel Theatre. All Azopardi’s secular pieces were donated by the composer to one of his students Marianna Schembri, mother of Mgr Paolo Pullicino and were conserved in the Pullicino family; unfortunately they are now lost except for some fragments recently discovered in the Carmelite Priory, Mdina. 96 Azopardi’s music is extant in several parish archives in Malta and Gozo as well as in private collections although the majority of these works are copies of manuscripts available in the Cathedral Museum’s music archives. 97 92. An old list of Zerafa’s works with very incomplete information was compiled in 1809 and is here reproduced as appendix 5. A more detailed chronological list of his extant works together with a biography of the composer was published by the present writer in a concert programme of Zerafa’s music held in 1987. The booklet includes among other essays a study on Zerafa’s music by Dr Simon Heighes of St Anne's College, Oxford. A doctoral thesis on Zerafa’s music will soon be presented by Mr Frederick Aquilina. 93. Registrum Deliberationum Capitularium , Vol.1_6, 145-151. 94. P.

The Cathedral Museum has microfilm copies of scores by Azopardi extant in various parishes and religious houses. 31 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA Like Zerafa Azopardi directed the music on the feastday of various other churches 98 including St Paul’s Grotto 99 , the Carmelite Priory and St Peter’s Nunnery, Mdina. Unlike Zerafa, Azopardi continued to compose up to the year of his death in 1809, his last work being the Antiphon Vade Anania for the titular feast of the Cathedral Church. Azopardi was also a dedicated teacher and a theorist. His students included important composers Pietro Paolo Bugeja, Giuseppe Burlon, Teodoro Piscopo, Giuseppe Principato and above all Nicolo’ Isouard. His manuscript treatise II Musico Pratico with its two French editions by Framery (1786) and Choron (1824) and its subsequent revision by Azopardi himself are discussed in detail by Matteo Sansone in a separate chapter in this book. Recently II Musico Pratico was the subject of two unpublished theses by Mro Dion Buhagiar 100 , Azopardi’s latest successor as chapel master of the Cathedral, whereas the two French editions were studied by Oliver Brantley Adams in 1991 101 . The Carmelites in Mdina have a manuscript copy of Azopardi’s treatise, which is an amalgam of Azopardi’s two versions. The autograph copies of the two manuscript versions are preserved in the Public Library. 4) Miscellaneous scores from the Cathedral Church (mss 238-239, 331-344 and 585-629) This miscellaneous section of about 50 scores consists of works which over the years accumulated in the music archives while still located in the Cathedral sacristies. Mixed with Benigno Zerafa’s collection were the only four extant motets composed by his young nephew the organist Vincenzo (mss 331-4) while mixed with Francesco Azopardi’s collection were minor scores by composers of the Neapolitan School such as Rispoli and Jommelli (mss 238-9). Three scores (mss 625-7) by Salvatore Meluzzi of the Cappella Julia were commissioned by the Cathedral Chapter for the feast of the solemn crowning in 1898 of the icon of the Virgin venerated in the Cathedral. Other scores by Maltese composers in this section include works by three chapel masters of the Cathedral, namely Pietro Paolo Bugeja, Vincenzo Bugeja 102 and Dr Giuseppe Vella as well as works by organists, singers or by composers who wished to dedicate a work to the Cathedral Chapter and have it archived in Cathedral’s collection. 98. Mgr Pullicino states that Azopardi directed music on feastdays in almost all the parishes of Malta. Vella Bondin ,op.cit., p. 137, quotes several recent articles with documentary evidence of performances at Zurrieq, Mosta, Rabat and Zebbug. 99. In his childhood Azopardi served for seven years as an altarboy ( called “diacono”) at St Paul’s Grotto where Zerafa’s brother Fra Giovanni Battista was “maestro di canto” and where Benigno himself directed the music on feastdays. Cfr Vella Bondin, op.cit. p.75. Among the members of this Collegio were two brothers of Francesco Azopardi, Fra Giuseppe and Fra Pietro Paolo; the latter was the Church’s organist. 1 00.

Several copies of Bugeja’s works, however , are available at Mdina, as part of recent acquisitions from various collectors. 32 THE MUSIC ARCHIVES AT THE CATHEDRAL MUSEUM, MDINA - MALTA These include Salvatore Portelli, Gaetano Grech, Salvatore Magrin, Cesare Vassallo and Giorgio Mercieca. Works donated to the Cathedral Museum after 1968. The interest in old music provoked by the various initiatives organized by the Cathedral Museum and the attention which these music archives drew soon resulted in donations of abundant collections owned by the families of composers or by private collectors. Though not included in the handlist accompanying these essays, these numerous acquisitions are here being listed and briefly described inasmuch as they now form the biggest part of the music archives. In the past two decades abundant use has been made by researchers who wrote articles and dissertations on these acquisitions. 1. The Nani Collection, with scores by six composers of the Nani family, namely Emanuele, Agostino, Vincenzo, Dr Paolo, Anton and Paul. These scores were donated by the late Mro Paul Nani in three instalments and catalogued as mss 644- 671, 713- 745 and 1725-1861. The Nani family originated in Venice and the music of its last three composers is still performed in some parishes and churches, especially in Valletta (in the churches of St Paul’s Collegiate and Our Lady of Mt Carmel). Dr Paolo Nani and his son Anton also composed operas 103 . 2. The Aurelio Camilleri Collection consisting of 29 scores donated by Charles Camilleri of Rabat, Malta, a relative of composer Francesco Azopardi. It includes works by Azopardi, Bugeja, Mifsud, Monreal and Pepi. 3. The Luigi Vella Collection donated in 1 979 by Mrs Edwige Camilleri and consisting of scores by Luigi Vella (mss 754-785) and various other Maltese composers (mss 1621-1674). Supporting the scores were a number of files with cuttings and information on music activity in Malta in Luigi Vella’s time 104 . 4. The Alberto Vella Collection donated by Mr Anthony Vella of Sliema. Included are the complete works of Dr Giuseppe Vella, maestro di cappella of the Cathedral ( mss 786-974, 1194-1226) and of his sons Alberto (mss 975-1186), and Paolo (mss 1194- 1226) as well as many other scores by his other son Luigi (mss 1227- 1462) 105 . 5. The Mro Francesco Sammut Collection donated in various instalments by Mro F. Sammut of Balzan. Most of the scores are copies of works of sacred music by various Maltese composers; their music was often directed by the donor himself in our churches. 6. The Caruana Collection consists of numerous scores by Giuseppe Caruana (1880- 1931) (mss 1867-2206) and his sons Fr Anton S.J. and Salvino (mss 2207-2218). These manuscripts were donated by the composer’s daughter Bice and her brother 103. Carmen Attard, Five Generations of Nani Musicians, unpublished dissertation Malta University, 1986. 104. These files have been researched by Joseph Vella Bondin who utilised material they contain for his recently published History of Music in Malta in 2 volumes (PIN Kullana Kulturali, Malta 2000, Vols. 18 and 19). 105.

Giuseppe Caruana’s very melodious scores are in full harmony with the Motu Proprio of Pope Pius X. Some of his popular hymns have earned international recognition. 7. The Carmelo Pace Collection, donated by the composer himself during his lifetime, comprises scores in a wide range of musical forms. These are inventoried as mss 2582-3042. Pace has set up a Foundation for the promotion of his music. A detailed catalogue of Pace’s works written by Marcel Degabriele and Georgette Caffari with the collaboration of the composer was published in 1991 106 . 8. The Giuseppe Doublet Collection donated by John B. Cassar of Rabat. The 363 manuscripts forming this collection (mss 2219-2581) were mostly the works of composers from the Cottonera area. 9 The Don Pietro Paolo Galea Collection, donated by Br Edward and the De La Salle Community, Cottonera. Fr P.P. Galea of Zabbar (1873-1930) did pastoral work with Maltese migrants in France. His collection includes an opera (ms 3158) entitled L’Erede di Marolles composed in 1926. 10. The Giuseppe Magri Collection, donated in 1988 by the composer’s daughter, Mrs Rose Bugeja on the recommendation of Mr Joseph Vella Bondin. It consists of 53 scores (mss 3202 - 3254) mostly by Magri himself. Besides sacred music, Giuseppe Magri (1875-1947) also wrote three operas and two operettas. 107 1 1 . The Carlo Fiamingo Collection donated by Mr A. Briffa of Sliema consists of 1 9 scores (mss 3255-3373) by Giorgio and Carlo Fiamingo and some minor composers. Included in this group is one of the few extant scores by Agostino Nani entitled Tre duettini per violino (ms 3266). 1 2. The Salvatore Scicluna Collection donated in 1 989 by the composer’s eldest son Oreste, consists of 302 scores, all by Salvatore (1864-1924) except for three composed by his father Calcedonio. Scicluna composed in the style of the Motu Proprio and conducted music in a number of parishes and other churches. 108 13. The Anton Azzopardi Collection donated in 1988 by the Azzopardi family of St Julian’s consists of about 350 scores grouped in 45 files which have still to be properly classified. Anton Azzopardi ( 1890-1944) was choir director and organist of Lija Parish Church. Among his works is an operetta Isacco . 109 13. The Camilleri Collection donated in 1989 by the wife and daughter of Mro Giuseppe Camilleri of Sliema consists of 437 scores. The collection can be divided into three groups: scores by the Camilleri composers, (Agostino, Enrico, Vincenzo, 1 06.

Among the second group is a rare score for band by Alessandro Curmi (ms 3792) and a copy of Emanuele Galea’s Sinfonia Pastorale (ms 3801). Giuseppe Camilleri’s sacred music is still performed in our churches. The collection includes a variety of secular works. 14. The Abela Scolaro Collection donated in 1990 by the widow of the composer Joseph Abela Scolaro (1912- 19789) consists of 181 scores by various composers including most of the works of Joseph himself. He was a prolific and a popular composer especially of band music. 15. The Galea Misura Collection donated by the Galea family of Valletta on the recommendation of Mgr Anthony Galea, consists of 171 scores by various Maltese composers, mostly connected with the Cottonera area. In fact the collection probably formed part of the Cassar Mallia collection, parts of which are included in the Doublet donation (no. 7) 16. The Fr Daniel Sammut Collection is the only section of the archives which is still being updated with the scores composed by this Carmelite Friar, who is still active as a composer. Manuscript numbers 4677 to 4704 are reserved for his collection. 1 7. A number of less extensive donations of music scores by private owners have accumulated over the past forty years. These donations include the scores of Josie Mallia Pulvirenti, one of Malta’s most important 20 m century composers 110 (mss 4447, 4578-84), the oratorio San Paolo evangelizza i Maltesi (ms 4675) by Carlo Diacono, band music composed by Gianni Vella of Mosta (mss 4586-92) and donated by his two sons and a group of 29 scores composed and donated by Mro Charles Zammit (mss 4616-4644). 18. The Mellieha Parish Collection deposited at the Cathedral Museum consists of 316 scores by various composers with a considerable number of works by Luigi Grech Grandolini, tenor and organist for over 40 years at St John’s Co-Cathedral Church in Valletta. 111 Before concluding this section reference must be made to a number of manuscript musical treatises scattered in the Cathedral archives 112 . These were the grammars and copybooks of several Maltese composers who studied in Naples, including Francesco Azopardi, Emanuele Galea, Pietro Paolo Bugeja, Luigi Vella and Giuseppe Burlo’. There are also the Partimenti of Cotumacci (ms 746) and Monopoli (ms 747) and the Studi di Contrappunto of Zingarelli (ms 748). 110.
