        "text": "Recently in Recordings\n\nHenry Purcell, Royal Welcome Songs for King Charles II Vol. III: The Sixteen/Harry Christophers\n\nThe Sixteen continues its exploration of Henry Purcell’s Welcome Songs for Charles II. As with Robert King’s pioneering Purcell series begun over thirty years ago for Hyperion, Harry Christophers is recording two Welcome Songs per disc.\n\nAnima Rara: Ermonela Jaho\n\nIn February this year, Albanian soprano Ermonela Jaho made a highly lauded debut recital at Wigmore Hall - a concert which both celebrated Opera Rara’s 50th anniversary and honoured the career of the Italian soprano Rosina Storchio (1872-1945), the star of verismo who created the title roles in Leoncavallo’s La bohème and Zazà, Mascagni’s Lodoletta and Puccini’s Madama Butterfly.\n\nRequiem pour les temps futurs: An AI requiem for a post-modern society\n\nCollapsology. Or, perhaps we should use the French word ‘Collapsologie’ because this is a transdisciplinary idea pretty much advocated by a series of French theorists - and apparently, mostly French theorists. It in essence focuses on the imminent collapse of modern society and all its layers - a series of escalating crises on a global scale: environmental, economic, geopolitical, governmental; the list is extensive.\n\nÁdám Fischer’s 1991 MahlerFest Kassel ‘Resurrection’ issued for the first time\n\nAmongst an avalanche of new Mahler recordings appearing at the moment (Das Lied von der Erde seems to be the most favoured, with three) this 1991 Mahler Second from the 2nd Kassel MahlerFest is one of the more interesting releases.\n\nMax Lorenz: Tristan und Isolde, Hamburg 1949\n\nIf there is one myth, it seems believed by some people today, that probably needs shattering it is that post-war recordings or performances of Wagner operas were always of exceptional quality. This 1949 Hamburg Tristan und Isolde is one of those recordings - though quite who is to blame for its many problems takes quite some unearthing.\n\nWomen's Voices: a sung celebration of six eloquent and confident voices\n\nThe voices of six women composers are celebrated by baritone Jeremy Huw Williams and soprano Yunah Lee on this characteristically ambitious and valuable release by Lontano Records Ltd (Lorelt).\n\nRosa mystica: Royal Birmingham Conservatoire Chamber Choir\n\nAs Paul Spicer, conductor of the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire Chamber Choir, observes, the worship of the Blessed Virgin Mary is as ‘old as Christianity itself’, and programmes devoted to settings of texts which venerate the Virgin Mary are commonplace.\n\nThe Prison: Ethel Smyth\n\nEthel Smyth’s last large-scale work, written in 1930 by the then 72-year-old composer who was increasingly afflicted and depressed by her worsening deafness, was The Prison – a ‘symphony’ for soprano and bass-baritone soloists, chorus and orchestra.\n\nSongs by Sir Hamilton Harty: Kathryn Rudge and Christopher Glynn\n\n‘Hamilton Harty is Irish to the core, but he is not a musical nationalist.’\n\nAfter Silence: VOCES8\n\n‘After silence, that which comes closest to expressing the inexpressible is music.’ Aldous Huxley’s words have inspired VOCES8’s new disc, After Silence, a ‘double album in four chapters’ which marks the ensemble’s 15th anniversary.\n\nBeethoven's Songs and Folksongs: Bostridge and Pappano\n\nA song-cycle is a narrative, a journey, not necessarily literal or linear, but one which carries performer and listener through time and across an emotional terrain. Through complement and contrast, poetry and music crystallise diverse sentiments and somehow cohere variability into an aesthetic unity.\n\nFlax and Fire: a terrific debut recital-disc from tenor Stuart Jackson\n\nOne of the nicest things about being lucky enough to enjoy opera, music and theatre, week in week out, in London’s fringe theatres, music conservatoires, and international concert halls and opera houses, is the opportunity to encounter striking performances by young talented musicians and then watch with pleasure as they fulfil those sparks of promise.\n\nCarlisle Floyd's Prince of Players: a world premiere recording\n\n“It’s forbidden, and where’s the art in that?”\n\nJohn F. Larchet's Complete Songs and Airs: in conversation with Niall Kinsella\n\nDublin-born John F. Larchet (1884-1967) might well be described as the father of post-Independence Irish music, given the immense influenced that he had upon Irish musical life during the first half of the 20th century - as a composer, musician, administrator and teacher.\n\nHaddon Hall: 'Sullivan sans Gilbert' does not disappoint thanks to the BBC Concert Orchestra and John Andrews\n\nThe English Civil War is raging. The daughter of a Puritan aristocrat has fallen in love with the son of a Royalist supporter of the House of Stuart. Will love triumph over political expediency and religious dogma?\n\nBeethoven’s Choral Symphony and Choral Fantasy from Harmonia Mundi\n\nBeethoven Symphony no 9 (the Choral Symphony) in D minor, Op. 125, and the Choral Fantasy in C minor, Op. 80 with soloist Kristian Bezuidenhout, Pablo Heras-Casado conducting the Freiburger Barockorchester, new from Harmonia Mundi.\n\nTaking Risks with Barbara Hannigan\n\nA Louise Brooks look-a-like, in bobbed black wig and floor-sweeping leather trench-coat, cheeks purple-rouged and eyes shadowed in black, Barbara Hannigan issues taut gestures which elicit fire-cracker punch from the Mahler Chamber Orchestra.\n\nAlfredo Piatti: The Operatic Fantasies (Vol.2) - in conversation with Adrian Bradbury\n\n‘Signor Piatti in a fantasia on themes from Beatrice di Tenda had also his triumph. Difficulties, declared to be insuperable, were vanquished by him with consummate skill and precision. He certainly is amazing, his tone magnificent, and his style excellent. His resources appear to be inexhaustible; and altogether for variety, it is the greatest specimen of violoncello playing that has been heard in this country.’\n\nThose Blue Remembered Hills: Roderick Williams sings Gurney and Howells\n\nBaritone Roderick Williams seems to have been a pretty constant ‘companion’, on my laptop screen and through my stereo speakers, during the past few ‘lock-down’ months.\n\nBruno Ganz and Kirill Gerstein almost rescue Strauss’s Enoch Arden\n\nMelodramas can be a difficult genre for composers. Before Richard Strauss’s Enoch Arden the concept of the melodrama was its compact size – Weber’s Wolf’s Glen scene in Der Freischütz, Georg Benda’s Ariadne auf Naxos and Medea or even Leonore’s grave scene in Beethoven’s Fidelio."
