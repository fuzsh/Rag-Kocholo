        "text": "Birth of Jean-Philippe Rameau, in Dijon. He was christened on September 25, in the collegiate Saint-Etienne.\n\nHis parents were Jean Rameau and Claudine Demartinécourt. Jean Rameau was the organist at several churches in Dijon. His wife was the daughter of a notary and belonged to the lesser nobility. Jean-Philippe was the seventh out of eleven children. The first four were daughters, the fifth a son, then came another daughter and then only boys. The last but one being Claude, the organist and father of the famous \"Rameau's Nephew\".\n\nJean Rameau taught music to all his children. Besides Jean-Philippe and Claude who were musicians, Maret mentioned Catherine Rameau, who was an excellent harpsichord player and teacher in Dijon.\n\nAs regards Jean-Philippe's childhood, it is said that he knew his notes before he could read.\n\nJean-Philippe had made up his mind that he wanted to become a musician. He went and stayed three months in Milano. Later, he said he regretted not to have spent more time in Italy \"where he could have improved his taste\".\n\nLittle later he was \"first fiddle\" in a troupe of travelling Milanese artists (Marseille, Lyon, Nîmes, Albi, Montpellier).\n\nIn Montpellier, a certain Lacroix is supposed to have taught him the \"octave rule\" for realizing figured bass. According to Maret, Rameau was never taught composition, except by his father.\n\nApparently, the full-term of the contract with Clermont was not reached because Rameau was in Paris.\n\nJ.-Philippe was appointed organ-player at the Jesuit Collège Louis-le-Grand, in rue Saint-Jacques, and at the Fathers of Mercy's, rue du Chaume. Jean-Philippe was in touch with Louis Marchand, the first French organist of his time.\n\nIn September, J.-Philippe applied for the organ of La Madeleine en Cité, he succeeded but didn't took up the position. Probably not to have to give up his two other organs.\n\nFirst Book of Pieces for Harpsichord.\n\nHe leaved Paris around 1708, and moved a lot : Dijon, Clermont, Lyon, and Clermont again. We have little information about these years.\n\nJanuary : Wedding of Claude Rameau, Jean-Philippe's young brother.\n\nOn April 1st , Rameau was appointed again by the Chapter of the Cathedral of Clermont. He stayed there until his departure to Paris in 1722. He had signed a contract for 29 years.\n\nMaret placed there a funny anecdote about how Rameau managed to break off his contract. Rameau wanted to leave, but he has signed and the Chapter wanted him to stay, so, in occasion of a mass, he put all his skill in producing the most awful music he could, pulling out the most unpleasing breaks and adding all the possible discords. It was so unbearable that they asked him to stop playing.\n\nThe chapter reproved him, but he said that he would not play otherwise. And they let him go.\n\nThe same anecdote is reported about his brother Claude.\n\nThe cantatas Aquilon et Orithie, Téthis & L'Impatience were probably composed during this time.\n\nDuring this stay in Clermont, Rameau deepened his theoretical knowledge and his reflexions on music, and built up the theories he would publish some years later in Paris.\n\nOn February 25, Rameau married Marie-Louise Mangot. Her father, Jacques, was a King's musician (\"Symphoniste du Roi\") and her mother a dancer. Marie-Louise was 19 and she was a musician and singer. She had distinguished manners, a good upbringing, a gift for music, a very pleasing voice and a good taste in singing.\n\n(Their marriage seems to have been a happy one. They had four children : 2 boys and 2 girls.)\n\nRameau's family settled rue des Petits-Champs.\n\nRameau published Nouveau Système de Musique théorique.\n\nHe composed L'Enrôlement d'Arlequin, & La Robe de Dissension, for the Fair Theatre, on librettos by Piron.\n\nIn this years (at least before 1727), Rameau was introduced, probably by Piron, to his future sponsor, Alexandre le Riche de La Pouplinière.\n\nBirth of Rameau's first child, Claude-François, christened on August 8 in the church St. Germain l'Auxerrois.\n\nRameau was organ-player at the Church Ste-Croix de la Bretonnerie. He would keep the work at least until 1738.\n\nHe competed for the organ of Saint Paul but failed. They choose Daquin.\n\nOctober 25, Rameau, who wanted to compose operas, wrote a letter to Houdar de la Motte, the most famous librettist of the time in France, to ask him for a libretto (Lettre à Houdar de la Motte). We don't know wether La Motte replied or not, but he didn't provide any libretto.\n\nAquilon et Orithie, Thétis, Le Berger fidèle, cantatas.\n\nNouvelles Suites de Pièces pour Clavecin\n\nThe thesis by Tobias Westbladh from the University of Upsalla was the first scholar work referring to Rameau's theories.\n\nHippolyte et Aricie, on a libretto by Pellegrin, was given privately by La Pouplinière's orchestra and singers at his house in rue Neuve des Petits-Champs, in March or April.\n\nBy July it was being rehearsed at the Royal Academy of Music (the Opéra), and the first public performance was given on October 1.\n\nRameau was fifty.\n\nThis work started the great quarrel between the Lullists and the Ramists (in other terms, between the Ancient and Modern) .\n\nAt the end of the year, Rameau and Voltaire began to work together at the tragedy Samson (libretto).\n\nSamson, composed by Rameau on a libretto by Voltaire was censored (libretto).\n\nCastor et Pollux, tragédie lyrique, on a libretto by Bernard, was performed at Versailles.\n\n\"Rameau, famous musician, who already composed three operas, has just given the fourth one, called Castor & Pollux. This opera had little success and was pretext to the following verses, which were not written by a poet, but by a gentleman :\n\nAgainst moderne music\n\nHere is my last reply :\n\nIf difficult is beautiful,\n\nRameau is a great man ;\n\nBut, if, by chance, beautiful\n\nis only what is simply natural,\n\nAnd depicted the same way,\n\nRameau is a stupid man.\n\nMémoires du duc de Luynes, 25 novembre 1736.\n\nRameau opened his School of Composition (Ecole de Composition - cf. document).\n\nRameau was appointed Compositeur de la Musique du Cabinet du Roi, and given a pension of 2000 pounds.\n\nFrom this date, Rameau's address mentioned on various publications was rue Saint Honoré, \"in front of the caffé Dupuis\" or \"near the Palais Royal\".\n\nRameau began to work on more frivolous works, like opera-ballets and pastorals.\n\nLa Princesse de Navarre, divertissement composed by Rameau to accompany Voltaire's play, performed in Versailles.\n\n\"After diner, at about five, the King came at the Mr. Dauphins and Mrs Dauphine's. The ballet was to begin at six. The lyrics are by Voltaire & the music by Rameau ; the theme of the play is the Princess of Navarre... The ballet ended only at 10 ; it is said the music was greatly approved.\"\n\nMémoires du Duc de Luynes, 24 February 1745.\n\nPlatée, comedy-ballet, Versailles.\n\nLes Fêtes de Polymnie, ballet in 3 entrees and a prologue on a libretto by Cahusac.\n\nLe Temple de la Gloire, an opera-ballet composed to celebrate the victory of Fontenoy, was performed in Versailles, in the room of the Small Stables.\n\n\"The performance and staging seem to me to have been approved. The music is by Rameau ; several pieces were enjoyed ; and the King himself, at his Great Diner, spoked about it before Rameau saying he was pleased. The words are by Voltaire and were criticised a lot. Voltaire too was at the King's diner, but the King said nothing to him. The theme is the Temple of the Glory, where the conquerers are not admitted on the title of their victories only ; Belus, Bacchus are outcasted from it, & Trajan is received in it for combining the greatest virtues with the greatest exploits\".Mémoires du Duc de Luynes, 30 November 1745.\n\nLes Fêtes de l'Hymen et de l'Amour, ballet in 3 acts and a prologue.\n\nThe words are by M. Cahusac & the music by Rameau ; it was titled The Gods of Egypt, but the name was changed for Les Fêtes de l'Hymen et de l'Amour. Rameau's music has generally a lot of supporters and one must admit that it is full of harmonies. Lully lovers think that Rameau is sometimes strange, and that several of his works are in the Italian manner : this is how the criticisers judged his past operas ; nevertheless, one cannot help to think that he is one of the greatest musicians we have. The opera given on last Wednesday was rated according to those opposite feelings ; all the connoisseurs, and Rameau himself, agree that the overture is not good, and he has planned to compose a new one. But, there are some wonderful pieces of music in it, a musette, a chorus which is strange but produces a beautiful effect. The King seemed to be happy about it ; he stopped on his way to speak to Rameau. He said that maybe he'll have this opera performed again after Eastern.\"Mémoires du Duc de Luynes, 18 March 1745.\n\nLa Dauphine, piece for harpsichord.\n\nZaïs, heroic pastoral in a prologue & 4 acts.\n\nPygmalion, ballet in one act.\n\nLes Surprises de l'Amour, ballet performed in Versailles.\n\n\"On past Wednesday the King visited for the first time the new opera built in the Ambassadors' Stairs... On this day was performed an opera or divertissement in three acts, composed on three different themes, a prologue & two ballets, which lyrics are by Sir Bernard, secretary of M. Marshall de Coigny from the dragons and librarian at Choisy, and the music by Rameau. The prologue is Le Retour d'Astrée ; they pictured the forges of Lemnos.\n\nMadame Duchess of Brancas was Astrée ; Mr Duke d'Ayen, Vulcain ; M. de la Salle, Time ; Mme Marchais, a Pleasure ;\n\nThe first ballet is entitled La Lyre enchantée. Madame de Pompadour was Urania ; M. de la Salle, Linus, son of Apollo ; Mme Marchais, Eros.\n\nThe second ballet was entitled Adonis.\n\nMadame de Pompadour was Venus, and performed and sang everything the best way ; Mme Marchais was Eros : Mme Duchess of Brancas, Diana ; M. Duke of Ayen, Adonis ; M. vicount of Rohan, a servant of Diana...\n\nBetween the grade and the stage is the orchestra, which is bigger than the one of the small gallery, and can hold up to 40 persons. The musicians and the public are comfortable, and one can hear clearly the actor's voices from any place......\" Mémoires du duc de Luynes, 29 November 1748.\n\n14 January : revival of Omphale by Destouches, at the Académie Royale de Musique. It was the starting point of the quarrel known as Querelle des Bouffons (Quarrel of the Buffoons), in which the Philosophers showed they determination in judging French opera seria on the criteria of the Italian Opera Buffa.\n\n17 January : Zoroastre, is performed in Dresden in an Italian translation by Casanova.\n\nFévrier : Melchior Grimm publishes his Letter on Omphale.\n\n1st August : The Italian performed Pergolesi's Serva Padrona. It was not the first performance in France but the previous one, six years before, had fallen flat.\n\nD'Alembert, Elements de Musique théorique et pratique selon les Principes de M. Rameau - Elements of theoreticcal and practical music according to M. Rameau's Principles.\n\nRousseau, Le Devin de village. The work was performed at the Court in Fontainebleau on October 18 & 24, and at the Opera on March 1st 1753.\n\nQuantz, Method for the Transversal Flute.\n\nRameau published Observations sur notre instinct pour la musique et sur ses principes - Observations on our instinct for music and on its principles.\n\nLa naissance d'Osiris, ballet in one act.\n\nAnacréon.\n\nA ballet in one act called Anacreon was then given, which words are by M. Cahusac and music by Rameau ; the opinions about this work are divided ... Mémoires du duc de Luynes, Fontainebleau, 27 octobre 1754.\n\nThe performance of last Saturday was the second one of Anacréon ; as this act was not successful for the musician and for the poet as well, here is what one says : this is not Rameau's anymore, but this is still Cahusac's.\n\nMémoires du duc de Luynes, Dampierre, 30 octobre 1754.\n\nCastor et Pollux was performed in a reworked version. It's a fabulous success which temporarily puts an end to the Querelle des Bouffons.\n\n\"Never a success was equal to this one, for it had no detractors, and because more than hundred performances couldn't diminish the pleasure that the whole Paris had in hearing that beautiful Opera, which pleases at the same time the soul, the heart, and the mind, the eyes, the ears and the imagination\". La Borde, Essai sur la musique.\n\nRevival of Dardanus. It was huge success.\n\nThe public lately, gave his (Rameau) talents their due in a brilliant way ; it was in occasion of a performance of Dardanus. They saw him in the amphitheatre ; they all turned toward him and applauded him for a quarter of an hour ; after the Opera ended, the applause followed him up to the Stairs \".Fréron, Année littéraire, 30 octobre, 1760.\n\nRameau submited to the Accademia delle Scienze dell'Instituto di Bologna a manuscript entitled Nouvelles Réflexions sur le Principe sonore - New Reflections on the sound Principles. He published it the year after with many changes.\n\nRameau started to correspond with Padre Martini.\n\nIppolito, ed Aricia, italian version of Rameau's opera by Treatta. The libretto was translated from the French one by a priest, Frugoni. Traetta kept part of the original music. The work was performed in Parma."
