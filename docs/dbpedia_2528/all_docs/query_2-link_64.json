Les Cyclopes (Rondeau)\n\n8min.\n\nClaude Debussy – Estampes (“Prints”), L.100 :\n\nI. Pagodes (“Pagodas”)\n\nII. La soirée dans Grenade (“Evening in Granada”)\n\nIII.

Debussy – “La plus que lente” (Valse), L. 121\n\n5min.\n\nM. Ravel– La valse, M. 72\n\nThe French Baroque composer Jean – Philippe Rameau wrote three books of Pièces de clavecin for the harpsichord .The first, Premier Livre de Pièces de Clavecin, was published in 1706 ; the second, Pièces de Clavessin, in 1724; and the third, Nouvelles Suites de Pièces de Clavecin, in 1726 or 1727. They were followed in 1741 by Pièces de clave in En concerts, in which the harpsichord can either be accompanied by violin (or flute) and viola da gamba or played alone. An isolated piece, “La Dauphine“, survives from 1747.\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau topped the summit of the Musical Establishment—named Compositeur du Cabinet du Roi in 1745—yet his pedigree was hardly auspicious. For a time a travelling violinist, he held numerous undistinguished posts as provincial organist (rarely serving out his contract and on one occasion deliberately playing sufficiently badly to ensure his dismissal) before finally settling in Paris at the age of forty.\n\nSomething of a theorist—his treatise On the Technique of the Fingers on the Harpsichord makes for essential reading—Rameau’s intellectualism combines in his music to produce passion and tenderness, in his own words ‘true music … the language of the heart’. Some sixty keyboard works are known, gathered by key into five suites\n\nThose played tonight are from 1724 and are the first,fifth and eighth from his Suite in D : Les Tendres Plaintes -la Follette– Les Cyclopes\n\nLes Tendres Plaintes. Rondeau .An almost tongue-in-cheek character piece, with a title so hackneyed that Rameau was surely poking a bit of fun: Les tendres plaintes (‘The tender sighs ‘) It is nevertheless a ravishing pearl piece , and Rameau clearly thought enough of it to rework it as a ballet movement in Zoroastre (1749).\n\nLes Niais de Sologne – Premier Double des Niais – Deuxième Double des Niais\n\nLes Soupirs. Tendrement\n\nLa Joyeuse. Rondeau\n\nLa Follette. Rondeau (The Sprite) is a bright gigue like Rondeau\n\nL’Entretien des Muses\n\nLes Tourbillons. Rondeau\n\nLes Cyclopes. Rondeau. Is the jewel of the set with a musical description of the mythological smithies who forged Jupiter’s thunderbolts in the deep recesses of the Earth. Here Rameau uses his special technique of ‘batteries’ which he claimed to have invented. As he explains in the preface to the 1724 collection: ‘In one of the batteries the hands make between them the consecutive movement of two drumsticks; and in the other, the left hand passes over the right to play alternately the bass and treble.’ Incidentally, Les cyclopes is believed to be one of the pieces played by the Jesuit Amiot before the Chinese Emperor; sadly, it seems to have not made much of an impression.\n\nLe Lardon. Menuet\n\nLa Boiteuse\n\nLa plus que lente L.121 was written for solo piano in 1910,shortly after his publication of the Préludes Book 1.It was first played at the New Carlton Hotel in Paris, where it was transcribed for strings and performed by the popular ‘gipsy’ violinist, Léoni, for whom Debussy wrote it (and who was given the manuscript by the composer).”La plus que lente is, in Debussy’s wryly humorous way, the valse lente to outdo all others.”It is marked “Molto rubato con morbidezza” indicating Debussy’s encouragement of a flexible tempo.\n\nDuring the same year of its composition, an orchestration of the work was conceived, but Debussy opposed the score’s heavy use of percussion and proposed a new one, writing to his publisher:\n\n“Examining the brassy score of La plus que lente, it appears to me to be uselessly ornamented with trombones,kettle drums,triangles , etc., and thus it addresses itself to a sort of de luxe saloon that I am accustomed to ignore!—there are certain clumsinesses that one can easily avoid! So I permitted myself to try another kind of arrangement which seems more practical. And it is impossible to begin the same way in a saloon as in a salon. There absolutely must be a few preparatory measures. But let’s not limit ourselves to beer parlours. Let’s think of the numberless five-o’-clock teas where assemble the beautiful audiences I’ve dreamed of.” Claude Debussy, 25 August 1910\n\nEstampes (“Prints”), L.100 It was finished in 1903. The first performance of the work was given by Ricardo Vines at the Salle Erard of the Société Nazionale de Musique in Paris on 9 January 1904.\n\nThis three-movement suite is one of a number of piano works by Debussy which are often described as impressionistic , a term borrowed from painting. This style of composition had been pioneered by Ravel in Jeu d’eau written in 1901, and was soon adopted by Debussy (for example in the earlier numbers of Images,but Debussy did not himself identify as an impressionist.\n\nPagodes evokes Indonesian gamelan music, which Debussy first heard in the Paris World Conference Exhibition of 1889.Debussy marks in the text that “Pagodes” should be played “presque sans nuance“, or “almost without nuance.” This rigidity of rhythm helps to reduce the natural inclination of pianists to add rubato and excessive expression.\n\nLa soirée dans Grenade uses the Arabic scale and mimics guitar strumming to evoke images of Granada ,Spain .Debussy’s only personal experience with the country was a few hours spent in San Sebastian de los Reyes near Madrid. Despite this, Manuel de Falla said of the movement: “There is not even one measure of this music borrowed from the Spanish folklore, and yet the entire composition in its most minute details, conveys admirably Spain.”\n\nJardins sous la pluie describes a garden in the Normandy town of Orbec during an extremely violent rainstorm. Throughout the piece, there are sections that evoke the sounds of the wind blowing, a thunderstorm raging, and raindrops dropping. It makes use of two folk melodies, the lullaby Dodo,l’enfant do and Nous n’irons plus au bois parce qu’il fait un temps insupportable (We will no longer go to the woods because the weather is unbearable).\n\nThe idea of La valse began first with the title “Vienne” as early as 1906, where Ravel intended to orchestrate a piece in tribute to the waltz form and to Johann Strauss.As he himself stated:’You know my intense attraction to these wonderful rhythms and that I value the joie de vivre expressed in the dance much more deeply than Franckist puritanism.’Ravel completely reworked his idea of Wien into what became La valse, which was to have been written under commission from Diaghilev as a ballet. However, he never produced the ballet after hearing a two-piano reduction performed by Ravel and Marcelle Meyer saying it was a “masterpiece” but rejected Ravel’s work as “not a ballet. It’s a portrait of ballet”. Ravel, hurt by the comment, ended the relationship and when the two men met again during 1925, Ravel refused to shake Diaghilev’s hand. Diaghilev challenged Ravel to a duel, but friends persuaded Diaghilev to recant. The men never met again.Ravel described La valse with the following preface to the score:\n\n‘Through whirling clouds, waltzing couples may be faintly distinguished. The clouds gradually scatter: one sees at letter A an immense hall peopled with a whirling crowd. The scene is gradually illuminated. The light of the chandeliers bursts forth at the fortissimo letter B. Set in an imperial court, about 1855.’"
