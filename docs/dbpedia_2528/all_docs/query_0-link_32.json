        "text": "Psalms are a collection of 150 songs used by the people of Israel in their warship. The Jewish people used to praise their Gad in singing; music and dancing. Typical of this aspect was haw King David and the Israelites danced and sang with their might to honour the Lard during the transfer of the ark of covenant from Baalah back to Jerusalem. They played musical instruments such as harps, drums and rattles (2 Samuel 6: 1 ff).\n\nThey were hymns and prayers used by the people of Israel in their praise and warship of Gad. Same were prayers far help, protection and pleas for forgiveness while others were used far liturgical purposes and as songs for thanksgiving far Gad's blessings and petitions for the punishment of their enemies.\n\nThey were composed by different authors, King David who is described as a talented musician played a significant role in the composition of psalms (1 Samuel 16:23). When Solomon succeeded him as a king, mare psalms were written especially with the building of the Jerusalem temple although others were written by unknown sources.\n\nIn all, psalms were written before Israel was taken into exile in Babylonia, during exile and after their restoration.\n\nTherefore, the following psalms should be considered,\n\nâ¢Â Â Â Â Â Psalms 2 (A Royal Psalm used during coronation)\n\nâ¢Â Â Â Â Â Psalm 20 (A Royal Psalm asking for victory in wars)\n\nâ¢Â Â Â Â Â Psalm 22 (A Personal Lament far suffering and a cry of anguish and praise)\n\nâ¢Â Â Â Â Â Psalm 47 (Gad as a Supreme King or a Royal Psalm to Gad)\n\nâ¢Â Â Â Â Â Psalm 48 (The Future King of Israel)\n\nâ¢Â Â Â Â Â Psalm 137 (A National Lament far the destruction of Jerusalem)\n\nPSALM 2: A ROYAL PSALM USED DURING CORONATION\n\nThis Psalm was used during the enthronement of a king in Israel. It was a pre-exilic psalm when kingship was still very important in Israel.\n\nThis Psalm spells out duties, responsibilities and the position of a king, which were greatly emphasized in Israel.\n\nIt also was a messianic prophesy in which the son of God believed to be Jesus Christ would have mighty power over the universe.\n\nThis Psalm gives a confirmation that Israel's kings had to be chosen by God himself and in accordance to the traditions of the people.\n\nThe Psalmist showed that the coronation of a king had to take place in the Jerusalem temple presided over by priests and judges.\n\nHowever, nations had planned rebellion and plotted against the Lard's chosen king. The psalmist described this plot as being useless.\n\nTo the Psalmist, the plot against the Lord's king was a direct plot against the Lord himself. Therefore, an attack on Judah meant attacking the Lord himself.\n\nThe Psalmist urged the people to free themselves from the rule and control of foreign kings.\n\nFor their plots and planned revolt, the Lord could only laugh and mock them from his heavenly throne.\n\nBesides, the Lord warned the plotters against his chosen king in his anger and terrified them as well.\n\nThe psalmist confirmed that the Lord had installed his own chosen king on Zion (the Jerusalem city), which he called his sacred hill.\n\nThe king would announce what the Lord had revealed to him; he had become the Lord's son and he was now his father.\n\nThe Lord promised his chosen king all nations. He would make the whole earth his own inheritance.\n\nThe Lord's king would have power to do whatever he wanted with the nations of the earth. Therefore, he would act with the approval of the Lord.\n\nThe Psalmist presented the king as having become the son of God on the day of his coronation. God had therefore become his father.\n\nThe Psalmist warned the kings of the earth to serve the Lord with fear or else they would arouse his anger thus they would suddenly die.\n\nThe Psalmist urged people to go to the Lord for their protection. For this reason, they had to rejoice.\n\nPSALM 20: A ROYAL PSALM OR PRAYER ASKING FOR VICTORY IN WAR\n\nThis was a prayer to God on behalf of the king of Judah asking for victory as he prepared to go to the battle field.\n\nThe Psalmists pleaded with the Lord to answer his anointed king when in trouble and to offer the protection needed.\n\nThe psalmists prayed to the Lord to send help from his sanctuary and grant support to his king from Zion.\n\nThe Psalmists prayed to God to accept the king's offerings and be pleased with all his sacrifices before being confronted by his enemies.\n\nThe Psalmists asked God to give his king what his heart desired and make all his plans successful.\n\nThe Psalmists longed to shout for joy upon victory being granted. To them, the king's victory was that of the Lord. For this reason, they would celebrate his victory and praise him as well.\n\nThe Psalmists proclaimed the acknowledgement of the Lord's victory to his chosen king. He would answer him and give him great victories by his power.\n\nThe Psalmists mocked those who trusted in their military might; their war chariots and horses. Such people would stumble and fall.\n\nTo the Psalmists, their victory would come by trusting in the power of the Lord their God rather than trusting in large and huge armies.\n\nThe Psalmists acknowledged God's help for Israel without which she would be too weak to face her enemies.\n\nThe psalmists foresaw victory coming their way. Their enemies would fall as they would rise and stand firm.\n\nThe psalmists wanted the Lord to give victory to the king and answer them when called. Therefore, victory for the king was their own victory.\n\nThis psalm was a call for Israel to be confident with their God who was acknowledged as being the supreme king ready to help them at any time.\n\nThe psalmists encouraged all the people to be obedient only to the king whom the Lord had an6inted rather than any other earthly power.\n\nRevision Questions\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Discuss the message behind Psalms 20\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \"Psalm 20 is sometimes called a prayer of victory\". Comment.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â How can the message in this Psalm be of use to Christians today?\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â What lessons can Christians draw from this Psalm?\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should seek protection from God\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should pray to God when in trouble\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should thank God for whatever life achievement\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should be united\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should plead on behalf of others\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should help those in need\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should give material support to the church\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should seek blessings from God through prayer.\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should be joyful and praise God's name\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should remain hopeful in times of difficulties\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should trust the Lord during their difficult moments\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should rely on God for whatever they need in their lives.\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should serve God faithfully\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Christians should be obedient to God's appointed leaders\n\nPSALM 22: PERSONAL LAMENT FOR SUFFERING, CRY OF ANGUISH AND A SONG OF PRAISE\n\nThis Psalm is a personal lament for suffering, a cry for anguish and praise to the Lord after a life of suffering.\n\nThe Psalmist expressed an intolerable suffering and someone overwhelmed by his or her grief.\n\nBesides, it pictured a desperate need for God's help as the Psalmist expressed the inability to help himself from his or her dilemma.\n\nThe Psalm is sometimes referred to as 'The Passion Psalm' as it gives a picture of the agony in Jesus' personal life experience beginning from the time of his arrest up to the time of his death. Â\n\nThe Psalmist bitterly wondered why his God had abandoned him. He felt that his God had forsaken and left him for dead. This implies that he had previously enjoyed the presence of God.\n\nThe Psalmist cried desperately for help but could not see any coming his way. Therefore, he felt being ignored by his own people.\n\nHowever much he called on to God, he could no longer answer him. Both day and night, he could get no rest.\n\nDespite his misery, the Psalmist acknowledged God being enthroned as the holy one whom the people of Israel praised.\n\nThe Psalmist painfully recalled how their ancestors trusted in God and he saved them. By their trust in him, they escaped dangers and thus were never disappointed.\n\nThe Psalmist lost his sense of humanity. He was no longer a human being but rather a worm; despised and scorned by everyone.\n\nHe was being treated like a condemned criminal. The people jeered at him with their tongue sticking out as they shook their heads.\n\nThe Psalmist felt mocked for having trusted in the Lord who could not now save him from his situation.\n\nThe Psalmist bitterly reminded the Lord how he brought him out safely through birth and protected him when he was still a baby.\n\nTo the Psalmist, he had always relied only on God ever since he was born; knowing him alone as; his God. This implies that the psalmist was disappointed that God was not helping him despite being close to him.\n\nThe Psalmist cried to God to be near him. He foresaw trouble near but there was no one to help him out. This still proved his reliance on God.\n\nHis enemies surrounded him in his helpless state. They were like fierce bulls that they opened their mouths like lions roaring and tearing at him.\n\nThe Psalmist felt that his strength was gone; a situation which he described like water spilt on the ground.\n\nBesides, his bones were out of their joint and his heart was now like melted wax yet God could only do nothing about his situation.\n\nThe Psalmist felt that his throat was as dry as dust that his tongue could only stick to the roof of his mouth. Indeed, he felt that the Lord had left him for dead in the dust.\n\nAn evil gang rounded the psalmist like a pack of dogs closing on to him that they were now tearing at his hands and feet.\n\nHis enemies looked and stared at him, gambled for his clothes and divided them among themselves.\n\nThe Psalmist cried out to the Lord for help asking him to come to his rescue and save him from the' sword.\n\nThe psalmist promised to tell his people what the Lord had done. He would praise him in their assembly.\n\nHe urged the people whom he called the servants of the Lord to praise, honour and worship the Lord.\n\nThe psalmist assured the people that the Lord could not neglect the poor and ignore their suffering. This gives the impression that God saved the psalmist from his intolerable suffering.\n\nThe psalmist assured the people that the poor would eat, be satisfied and that those who would seek the Lord would praise him.\n\nBesides, the psalmist assured the people that all nations would remember and turn to the Lord to worship him.\n\nHe assured the people that future generations would serve the Lord and testify about him.\n\nRevision Questions\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To what extent is Psalm 22 a reflection of Suffering?\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Examine the dilemma of the Psalmist as expressed in chapter 22\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â What lessons can Christians learn from this Psalm?\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âPsalms 22 is sometimes referred to as the passion psalm\".

For this reason, he rules with supremacy.\n\nPSALM 48: THE FUTURE KING OF ISRAEL\n\nThe Psalmists acknowledged God as being great and worthy to be praised in the city of Jerusalem; his sacred hill.\n\nZion or Jerusalem is acknowledged as the city of the great king and a source of joy to the entire world.\n\nThe Psalmists presented God as having shown that people could only find safety with him inside the fortress of his city.\n\nHowever, as the kings of the world gathered together and went to attack Jerusalem, they became afraid upon seeing this and they ran away.\n\nThe Psalmists acknowledged having heard all that the Lord had done and now they were witnesses to it in his city.\n\nThe Psalmists confessed that they would think about God's constant love for them while in his temple.\n\nThe covenant people confirmed that their God was praised by people everywhere; for his fame had extended over all the earth.\n\nThe psalmists pleaded with God to rule with justice for the people of Jerusalem to be glad.

They mourned bitterly that their city; Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians.\n\nThe helpless exiles remembered what had happened to Jerusalem (Zion) and were overcome by grief.\n\nBesides, the exiles wept for the loss of their homes, families alongside the city and temple of their God.\n\nThe exiles refused to obey the orders of their captors and tormentors who were demanding to be entertained with songs about Zion.\n\nThe exiles wondered how they could sing a song to the Lord while in a foreign land. This meant that they could only sing to the Lord while in their land particularly in his temple.\n\nTo them, they would rather be unable to play their harps again than forget Jerusalem their holy city. For this reason, they hang up their harps on the branches of the trees by the rivers.\n\nThe exiles pleaded with the Lord to remember what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem was captured. They raided Judah's territory and were happy to see Jerusalem destroyed.\n\nFor what the Edomites had done, the exiles pleaded with the Lord to avenge on them so that they share in their experiences.\n\nThe exiles confirmed that the Babylonians would too share in their fate. They would be destroyed.\n\nThe exiles would gladly welcome those who repay the Babylonians for what they had done to them.\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PSALM 137 AND THE FEELINGS OF THE EXILES\n\nThe people of Israel were under captivity in Babylon and were therefore in a foreign land.

They had destroyed and looted everything.\n\nThe exiles helplessly and hopelessly remembered the destruction of their city; Jerusalem that they could only sit and weep by the sides of the rivers.\n\nThe exiles were being oppressed by their captors who continued demanding them to do what they were unable to do.\n\nBesides, the exiles were mourning for the loss of their homes, families alongside the city and temple of their God.\n\nThe exiles were being mocked by their captors who asked them to entertain them with songs of joy.\n\nThe exiles felt tormented that their captors who were asking them to sing the songs they used for praising their God when they were in their land and were now suffering.\n\nThe exiles had a view that they could only sing to the Lord from their own rather than a foreign land. For this reason, they refused to sing as demanded by the Babylonians.\n\nThe exiles took it that the land in which they were was ungodly. For this matter, they could not praise their God from there and they hang up their harps.\n\nThe exiles had a feeling that they had left their God in their land. He seemed distant away from them and it appeared they had been abandoned.\n\nTo the exiles, nothing at all could ever make them forget their city, Jerusalem, which was their greatest joy.\n\nThe exiles were home sick and they wished they could go back to their land for them to feel comfortable and happy.\n\nThe exiles had a feeling that their ways of worshipping had been interrupted by their captivity. This was the reason they wondered how they could sing to the Lord in a foreign land.\n\nThe exiles felt that they would rather lose their musical skills than to lose their city and temple of God.\n\nThe exiles were bitter that the Edomites rejoiced on the day the Babylonians captured Jerusalem; the holy city of their God.\n\n.
