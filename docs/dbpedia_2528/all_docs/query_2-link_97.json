        "text": "To the beloved reader : the present text has been written simultaneously in French, English and Spanish by the author. Yet it has not been subjected to any translation. All three versions are exclusively ownership of the author. Substantial changes in the text remain entirely under the responsibility of the users and do not share the agreement of the owner. <strong>Jean</strong>-<strong>Philippe</strong> <strong>Rameau</strong> Jorge Cova A son of an organist at Dijon, <strong>Jean</strong>-<strong>Philippe</strong> <strong>Rameau</strong> (1683-1764) received from his father his only formal musical instruction. After a brief sojourn in Italy and a term as organist at Clermond- Ferrand he undertook his first trip to Paris in 1706 where he published his first book for harpsichord at the age of thirsty-three. He then succeeded his father at Notre Dame de Dijon in 1709, and shortly afterwards he was appointed organist at Lyon. In 1715 he returned to his former position at Clermont-Ferrand; here he wrote his Traité de l’Harmonie (Treatise of Harmony), which he published in 1722. He returned to Paris in 1723, at the age of forty. The Parisian public then thought of <strong>Rameau</strong> mostly as a scholar, a philosopher, a wise man, but by no means as a composer. Moreover, due to his being bitter and solitary, <strong>Rameau</strong> revealed himself unfit for court life. He was first acknowledged by the public once he had devoted himself entirely to the composition of opera, shortly before he had turned fifty. But, at the same time he found himself involved in quarrels, assailed by his detractors, due to the innovative caracter of his composition which resulted in clashes with the current taste. His Thougth No other musical personality could be so closely related to the ideas of the XVIIIth century French Enlightenment; no one so fully embodies its inner intellectual character. Within an era in which Nature was believed to be ruled by a rational order and mechanical principles, <strong>Rameau</strong>’s greatest accomplishment was to expose the empirical bias of musical practice in terms of a natural principle: the fundamental bass. His scientific thought is evidently Newtonian, similar to the celestial optic and mechanic’s systematisation. <strong>Rameau</strong> has always imagined his fundamental bass as a Cartesian model. As a matter of fact, in the foreword of his Traité de l’Harmonie he states : “ […] music is a science that should have certain rules; these rules must be drawn from an evident principle, and this principle cannot be known to us out of the resort of mathematics.” Insofar as <strong>Rameau</strong>’s Cartesian rhetoric is not merely pure reason, he has never denied the intervening role of practice in the building up of musical theory. Should whatever musical principle become worth while, - he says -, it must relay on hearing experience: “we can only assess music throughout listening, and mind wouldn’t have any authority unless it relays in agreement with the ear ”."
