        "text": "The music-related gestures of la danse grotesque in Rameau’s Les Sauvages Nowadays many of us agree that a historically informed performance, HIP, is not an objecti ed, historical truth about the music of previous centuries. Even so, we still need to reflect upon the many possibilities of how we actually embody historically informed performing knowledge in practice. In this article I will explore the music-related movements of la danse grotesque in Jean- Philippe Rameau’s composition, Les Sauvages, as a musician-researcher, harpsichordist, and a basso continuo player. The article deals with the solo harpsichord composition as well as with the version for soloists, vocal ensemble and orchestra as part of the opéraballet Les Indes galantes. One of the key concepts in my research is the rhetorical actio. However, rhetorical actio is not only about speech or oratory. When applied to music, the tradition encompasses a range of other bodily actions not necessarily related to the act of speaking. By positioning ourselves in the dialectical space between history and the musical material, we process and modify it. As a result we gain a whole gamut of artistic possibilities. These alternatives are much more historically informed than we might think at first, because our own, temporal position in the historical continuum is comprehended as a part of it. Keywords: baroque, la danse grotesque, embodiment, historically informed performance, musical gestures, music-related movements, performance practice, practice-based research, rhetorical actio. About the Author: Assi Karttunen DMus is a harpsichordist specialized in performing and researching Baroque music. She also performs in interdisciplinary groups with experimental and contemporary repertory. Karttunen works as a musician-researcher at DocMus, Doctoral school of the Sibelius Academy, and teaches harpsichord playing and basso continuo at the Early music faculty, Sibelius Academy. She has recorded solo albums (Alba, Divine Arts), has played in several orchestras and ensembles, and is currently working in her Elysian Fields Workshop.\n\nThe name of Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1764) inevitably appears in the historical considerations of musical theorists. Rameau is considered the father of modern harmony, as well as one of the pioneers of the modern understanding of tonality. At the same time, he was almost certainly the most prominent figure in French music of the first half of the 18th century. Along with the Couperin family, as a remarkably gifted composer for keyboard instruments, he is seen as the progenitor of the long tradition of French keyboard music, which can be traced all the way to our own time. Such an interesting and multi-talented figure provides a very welcome opportunity for musicologists to assess the relationship between the theoretical and the creative; the empirical and the evanescent; and perhaps even the conscious and the subconscious. Rameau the theorist obviously underwent a long evolution; however, this path was not always progressive and straightforward but seems to have meandered and vacillated as he abandoned some of his ideas as the result of personal insecurity and (possibly) the harsh criticisms that mostly came from Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). This led to obvious inconsistencies between the practice of Rameau the composer and the ideas of Rameau the theorist. This paper offers a chronological comparison between Rameau's postulates about tonality theories and its subsystems (diatonic, chromatic and – above all – enharmony) and his contemporaneous compositions for harpsichord, and will attempt to infer if and how much the composer adhered to his own postulates.\n\nAfter a succinct introduction to French Baroque \"inégalité\", this paper explains common shortcomings in the interpretation of the music of Rameau and especially his Concerts, one of the greatest masterworks of Baroque chamber music. It is also shown how these problems are likely to originate in the influence of a decades-old recording by world-renowned performers. An updated version of this essay has been included as section 4.8 INEGALITE IN RAMEAU'S CONCERTS, pp. 93-97 of \"Playing the Baroque Harpsichord\", 2nd ed., 2014. See http://play.braybaroque.ie/"
