        "text": "Comments for CDs on <strong>Klassic</strong> <strong>Haus</strong> website - 1st Series 2010 KHCD-2010-001 (STEREO Reel Tape Master) - Berwald: Symphony in C Singuliere / Mendelssohn: Symphony No. 5 Reformation - This CD release is from a rare Decca (US) Stereotape that was found in seldomplayed condition . This recording of Berwald's Singuliere symphony and Mendelssohn's Reformation symphony is also one of my favorites in the Cincinnati Symphony recordings series Decca made from the early 1960s to the early 1970s. The soundscape faithfully reflects the wonderful acoustics of Cincinnati Music Hall; Max Rudolf's interpretations are thoughtful and well-paced. Highly recommended! KHCD-2010-002 (STEREO) - Nielsen: Symphony No. 4 Inextinguishable/Overture to Maskarade - <strong>Klassic</strong> <strong>Haus</strong> continues in its Cincinnati Symphony/Decca recording series reissues with Nielsen's Inextiguishable symphony, first released in 1965 during the world-wide Nielsen music revival. Once again, Max Rudolf presents a well-paced reading of this intriguing symphony. The CD also features the light-hearted overture to Nielsen's comic opera Maskarade. This CD is sourced from a near-mint LP copy; very hard to find in good condition, as domestic Decca surfaces were seldom quiet even when new. An enjoyable disc from start to finish! <strong>Page</strong> | 1"
