        "text": "The music of Jean-Philippe Rameau has always been a favourite of mine. As a composer he was an absolute genius, pushing the boundaries of harmony, melody, dance, orchestration and imagination at a time when the “high” Baroque period had arguably reached maturity, and yet he was able to create an even more complex and beautiful sound world, the likes of which had not been seen before. But his peerless music is still largely unknown, not only outside France but outside the period instrument world in general.\n\nThere are many reasons for this unfortunate state of affairs, both historical and practical. Staging the great works of Rameau – his “opéras-ballets” – presents a number of obstacles for a modern opera or dance company to contend with. Firstly they require a large corps of personnel – dancers, chorus, large orchestra and several soloists of every voice type – many more than other contemporary works. And also, the historical performing pitch in Paris in the mid-18th Century is generally thought to be around A=392, a whole tone lower than today’s standard modern pitch of A=440. This means that if one uses modern rather than period instruments, the higher pitch renders many of the vocal lines well nigh unsingable.\n\nThen there is also the essential ingredient of all French baroque music – ornamentation – which is complicated to begin with, and which is taken to extremes in Rameau’s music. A huge range of variations, mordents and trills are to be encountered in almost every bar, and for today’s musician it’s unfamiliar and potentially bewildering territory. But once you get the hang of it, you find that the ornamentation really does provide the cement between the bricks of the music. All those notes which are not on the page but instead represented by crosses, symbols and various other squiggles actually fill in the missing links of the melodic line; they add expression, passion and drama, enriching the already daring and sensuous harmonies.\n\nFinally there is the world of “inégal”, a system of unwritten but essential rhythmic variation which adds unmistakable flavour and colour to the music, and without which the music loses its unmistakable “Frenchness”. To the uninitiated, this “loosening-up” of the notated rhythm can take some getting used to.\n\nAnd yet, although these potentially daunting obstacles may contribute to Rameau’s obscurity, they are not impossible to overcome, and the rewards to be enjoyed – in persisting with unlocking the secrets to his music – are great. Rameau’s musical world is absolutely mesmerising, and really does deserve to be performed as widely and as often as possible. In my opinion, he is the greatest composer of dance music before Stravinsky. He had an endless capacity for invention and inspiration: one would struggle to find two of his Passepieds or Chaconnes which are alike. For the young musicians of ANAM, I thought Rameau would be the perfect repertoire to introduce them to the world of French Baroque music.\n\nWritten by Benjamin Bayl\n\nPart 2 will explores bringing Glories of the French Baroque to life – suite selections, sourcing the scores and working with Brenda.
