Additionally, calligraphic and statistical evidence from the earliest known manuscripts and printed source for the keyboard sonatas is explored. The study is focused on three ornaments--the appoggiatura, trill, and tremulo--and concludes that: the appoggiaturas in this repertoire were short unless cadential or present in a cantabile tempo, in which case they could be one-third to two-thirds the value of the resolution note; trills were begun on the main note unless preceded by a grace note; tremulo was usually an alternation of a main note with its lower neighbor note and this ornament is normally indicated at points of harmonic prolongation. The last chapter discusses general approaches to arranging these works for the guitar and the specific influence of ornamentation on the performance of the sonatas on guitar. Details from eight sonatas arranged for the guitar are used to exemplify the conclusions of the research.\n\nWillis, Christopher Timothy. \"Performance, narrativity, improvisation and theatricality in the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti\".

Both composers' sonatas were composed using structural practices already in place. However, it was through experimentation and modifications, which resulted in increased virtuosity in others, that they bridged the gap between the Baroque and the Classical periods, and contributed profoundly to the development of the keyboard sonata.\n\nGiliberti, Patrizia. \"A interpretação das sonatas de Domenico Scarlatti no piano moderno: edição crítica dos manuscritos: \"Manuscrito P-Cug MM 58, 10 da Biblioteca Geral da Universidade de Coimbra\", \"Essercizi per Gravicembalo (1738) da Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal\" e \"Manuscrito F.

Diss., The University of Arizona, 1997. http://hdl.handle.net/10150/288715.\n\nTexto completo\n\nResumen\n\nThis document is a thorough study of the glissando throughout its chronological development, consisting of an examination of differences in the glissando's functions, types, and executions. Examples are extracted from piano solo and piano concerto compositions, which were written by composers from Domenico Scarlatti, born in 1685, to George Crumb, born in 1929. The glissando was used as a formal compositional device in the eighteenth century, beginning with the works of Domenico Scarlatti. It evolved from the Schleifer and was ornamental and occasionally melodic in function. Composers of the Classical period, like Ludwig van Beethoven and Carl Maria von Weber, expanded the device into octaves, which before the end of the nineteenth century was adopted by Bedrich Smetana, Johannes Brahms, and Mily Balakirev. Franz Liszt produced many two-hand and double-note glissandi, and his output of glissandi is the most numerous in the entire piano repertoire. In twentieth-century, Bela Bartok produced a dry effect in the glissando, while Prokofiev produced the most numerous glissandi in this century. Hindemith wrote an unusual form of black-and-white glissando; Tippett's example is of the \"fanfare\" effect; and Britten contributed many glissandi in a single work, to a degree perhaps exceeded only by Liszt's works. For nationalistic composers, like Manuel de Falla and Heitor Villa-Lobos, the glissando is a fine device to express the feeling of ethnic emotions, such as joyful and energetic. Besides, the use of the black-key glissando gives composers a fine application for impressionistic purposes, since its pentatonic orientation is easy to liken to images of nature: water, wind, etc. Such examples are found in the works of Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and others. Nonetheless, it becomes less crucial in this harmonic consideration in the works of more recent composers, in whose works the concept of tone-clusters or just a \"noise\" is revealed. This thesis also includes two appendices, one contains a chart of 473 glissandi categorized by function, and the second, an original composition by the author, which includes numerous glissandi in various types.\n\nCampbell, Alan Douglas. \"The binary sonata tradition in the mid-eighteenth century : bipartite and tripartite \"First halves\" in the Venice XIII collection of keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti\".

His music remains largely unexplored. This study investigates formal and functional aspects of the \"first halves\" in the Venice XIII collection (K 514--K 543) and reveals links to the aesthetics and traditions of his contemporaries. It suggests and examines relationships to the development of the sonata genre. To accomplish this, the study proposes a theoretical base for critical analysis and presents a specialised terminology to examine the features of mid-eighteenth-century sonata forms. The arguments of Michelle Fillion, J. P. Larsen, and Wilhelm Fischer are central to the discussion. Studies by William Caplin, Barbara Foster, Klaus Heimes, Ralph Kirkpatrick, and James Unger also contribute to the development of the theoretical base. An analysis section views the selected repertoire and some contemporary works according to the criteria the thesis establishes. An epilogue sums up pertinent observations made in the analysis section.\n\nYáñez, Navarro Celestino. \"Nuevas aportaciones para el estudio de las sonatas de Domenico Scarlatti.

Es creia que la circulació de música de tecla es va circumscriure a la cort de Madrid i la seva propera àrea d’influència, sobretot, per dues raons. La primera, pel fet que el nombre de còpies manuscrites trobades als arxius espanyols era reduïda, cosa que ha canviat en els darrers últims anys. La segona, pel desconeixement de que podria existir a Espanya una gran col·lecció de sonates realitzada en vida de Domenico Scarlatti. No obstant això, el descobriment dels manuscrits de sonates existents a Saragossa, dut a terme pel Dr. José Vicente González Valle, ha permès disposar d’un nou fons documental d’especial transcendència per als investigadors. La present tesi doctoral, que suposa el primer treball realitzat sobre aquestes fonts espanyoles a nivell internacional, ha donat lloc a l’aflorament de noves dades inèdites; i conseqüentment, ha posat de manifest la necessitat de revisar algunes de les tesis assumides pels investigadors més rellevants sobre aquesta matèria. A partir del meu estudi, he arribat a la conclusió que els còdexs van poder ser originàriament propietat del compositor espanyol, d’origen aragonès, José de Nebra, que va estar més de quaranta anys al servei de la cort espanyola. La col·lecció de sonates de Saragossa tindria el seu origen a la possible relació existent entre D. Scarlatti i José de Nebra; músics que van coexistir en la cort des de 1733 (any en què Ferran VI i Maria Bàrbara de Bragança es van instal·lar definitivament a Madrid) fins a 1757 (any de la mort de D. Scarlatti). Considerant el nombre d’obres, l’origen dels manuscrits, els copistes que hi intervenen, la data primerenca de còpia de la música, i el valor musicològic de les versions contingudes, no hi ha cap dubte que la col·lecció de Saragossa és única a Espanya, situant-se al mateix nivell de les col·leccions de Venècia i Parma.\n\nTradicionalmente, se ha dado por supuesto que la difusión de la música de Domenico Scarlatti durante el siglo XVIII en España fue escasa. Se creía que la circulación de sus sonatas para teclado se circunscribió a la corte madrileña y a su área próxima de influencia, sobre todo, por dos motivos. El primero, por el hecho de que el número de copias manuscritas encontradas en los archivos españoles era reducido, algo que ha cambiado en los últimos años. El segundo, por el desconocimiento de que pudiera existir en España alguna gran colección de sonatas elaborada en vida de Domenico Scarlatti. No obstante, el hallazgo de los manuscritos de sonatas existentes en Zaragoza, llevado a cabo por el Dr. José Vicente González Valle, ha permitido disponer de un nuevo fondo documental de especial trascendencia para los investigadores. La presente tesis doctoral, que supone el primer trabajo realizado sobre estas fuentes españolas a nivel internacional, ha dado lugar al afloramiento de nuevos datos inéditos; y consecuentemente, ha puesto de manifiesto la necesidad de revisar algunas de las tesis dadas por sentadas por los investigadores más relevantes sobre esta materia. A través de mi estudio, he llegado a la conclusión de que los códices pudieron ser originariamente propiedad del compositor español, de origen aragonés, José de Nebra, quien estuvo más de cuarenta años al servicio de la corte española. La colección de sonatas de Zaragoza pudo tener su origen en la posible relación existente entre D. Scarlatti y José de Nebra; músicos que coexistieron en la corte desde 1733 (año en el que Fernando VI y María Bárbara de Braganza se instalaron definitivamente en Madrid) hasta 1757 (año de la muerte de D. Scarlatti). Considerando el número de obras contenidas, el origen de los manuscritos, los copistas que intervienen, la fecha temprana de copia de la música, y el valor musicológico de las versiones contenidas, no cabe duda alguna de que la colección de Zaragoza es única en España, situándose al mismo nivel de las colecciones de Venecia y Parma.\n\nIt has been traditionally believed that the diffusion of the music by Domenico Scarlatti during the 18th century in Spain was scarce. It has been taken for granted that diffusion of his sonatas for keyboard was limited to the circle of the court of Madrid and its nearest area of influence. This argument was sustained for a long time mainly because of two reasons. The first one, because the number of manuscript copies found in Spanish archives was small, something that has changed over the last years. The second one, because of the ignorance that there could exist a great collection of sonatas composed during the lifetime of Domenico Scarlatti in Spain. Nevertheless, the founding of a great corpus of sonatas in Saragossa by Dr. José Vicente González Valle, has meant the opening of a new and relevant line of research. In this sense, this doctoral thesis, which is the first work made about these Spanish sources on an international level, has allowed the outcoming of unpublished data; and consequently, has shown the need to revise some of the thesis put forward as true by the most relevant researchers on this field. During my investigation, I have reached the conclusion that the codexes could have been originally owned by the Spanish composer, of Aragon origin, José de Nebra, who served for over forty years for the Spanish court. The collection of sonatas from Saragossa could have its origin in the possible relationship between D. Scarlatti and José de Nebra; musicians who coexisted in the courtfrom 1733 (year when Fernando the sixth and María de Braganza definitely settled in Madrid) and seventeen-fifty-seven (year of the death of D. Scarlatti). Considering the number of works within, the origin of the manuscripts, the copyists that intervened, the early date of the copy of the music, and the musicological value of the versions, there is no doubt that the collection of Saragossa is unique in Spain, being at the same level of the collections of Venice and Parma\n\nHeiden, Mary Gifford. \"Patronage, Connoisseurship and Antiquarianism in Georgian England: The Fitzwilliam Music Collection (1763-1815)\". Thesis, University of North Texas, 2011. https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc103327/.\n\nTexto completo\n\nResumen\n\nIn eighteenth-century Britain, many aristocrats studied music, participated as amateurs in musical clubs, and patronized London’s burgeoning concert life. Richard Fitzwilliam, Seventh Viscount Fitzwilliam of Merrion and Thorncastle (1745-1816), was one such patron and amateur. Fitzwilliam shaped his activities – participation, patronage, and collecting – in a unique way that illustrates his specialized tastes and interests. While as an amateur musician he sang in the Noblemen’s and Gentlemen’s Catch Club (the premiere social club dedicated to musical performance), he rose to the highest level of patronage by spearheading the Handel Commemoration Festival of 1784 and serving for many years as a Director of the Concert of Antient Music, the most prestigious concert series in Georgian Britain. His lasting legacy, however, was his bequest to Cambridge University of his extensive collection of art, books and music, as well as sufficient funds to establish the Fitzwilliam Museum. At the time of his death, Fitzwilliam’s collection of music was the best in the land, save that in the Royal Library. Thus, his collection is ideally suited for examination as proof of his activities, taste and connoisseurship. Moreover, the music in Fitzwilliam’s collection shows his participation in the contemporary musicological debate, evidenced by his advocacy for ancient music, his agreement with the views of Charles Avison and his support for the music of Domenico Scarlatti. On one side of this debate were proponents of learned, ancient music, such as Fitzwilliam and Avison, whose Essay on Musical Expression of 1752 was a milestone in musical criticism. On the other side of the discussion were advocates for the more modern, “classical” style and genres, led by historian Charles Burney.\n\nDe, La Matter Katherine. \"Domenico Scarlatti's Tolomeo et Alessandro : an investigation and edition\". Thesis, City University London, 2011. http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.551235.\n\nTexto completo\n\nResumen\n\nThis investigation focuses on Domenico Scarlatti's Tolomeo et Alessandro (Rome, 1711), as a representative part of an understudied body of work by a composer who is well-known, but not often acknowledged for his vocal works. The dramma per musica was one of the most popular forms of entertainment in Rome in this period, particularly amongst the most influential group of literati in Italy at that time: the Accademia dell' Arcadia. Scarlatti's setting of this work took place against the backdrop of the turbulent literary aesthetics of the Arcadians: the patron who commissioned the work, the librettist, and a number of members of the audience for which it was composed belonged to the organization. Assessment of the location of features of the libretto within the spectrum of Arcadian practice will preface an examination of the means by which these valued elements were realised in the musical setting. Analysis of Scarlatti' s response to the libretto will assess musical structures, instrumentation, harmonic and melodic devices and tempi, with a view to synthesising an understanding of his practice in setting those literary and theatrical devices appreciated by Arcadian listeners. The study will conclude with brief comparisons of Scarlatti's stylistic characteristics to those evident in other extant drammi per musica by the composer, select works by his father Alessandro, and Handel's setting of the same libretto: Tolomeo, re d'Egitto (1728). The sole complete score of Tolomeo et Alessandro is held by the National Trust at Belton House, Lincolnshire, UK. An edition of this score, presented in Volume II with an accompanying preface and apparatus, complements the discussion in Volume 1. In turn, Volume I provides extensive information about the physical materials of the sources of the edition, and commentary relevant to performance of the work. As complete sources of Roman operas from this period are rare, this edition is included not only as an integral part of the dissertation, but also as a resource for the reader, and for future scholarship.\n\nPan-Yan, Qian-Fei y 潘閻芊翡. \"The Analysis and Interpretation of Five Keyboard Sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti\".

In addition to the well-known J. S. Bach and Händel, there was also one composer—Domenico Scarlatti, who had composed 545 keyboard sonatas. Although Scarlatti was not born in Spain, his keyboard sonatas are filled with Spanish ethnic style. Guitar music is especially an important factor in his compositions— throughout his life. Furthermore, in his sonatas, D. Scarlatti utilized many keyboard techniques and skills that had almost surpassed the capacity of the harpsichord at that time, in which the gamut and the skill of harpsichord playing could be explored to an extreme, for example, long-distance jumping with hand-crossing, quick hand alternations during fast passages, repeating the same note swiftly, etc. In contemporary piano playing, such skills remain essential for advanced piano players, also the prerequisite skills for all the players. In the 18th Century, suites consisting of several pieces of dance music prevailed. However, Scarlatti titled his compositions as sonatas. As for the reason, by analyzing Scarlatti’s unique compositional methods, and musical forms in his sonatas, and compare them with 18th Century keyboard and violin suites, the author wishs to understand whether there is any correlation between his sonatas and the suites commonly-composed at that time in Baroque Period. The five keyboard sonatas by Scarlatti studied in this report are: “L. 413/ K. 9”, “L. 108/ K. 213”, “L. 422/ K. 141”, “L. 449/ K. 27”, and “L. 465/ K. 96”. These sonatas include many Spanish guitar music characteristics as well as the more difficult playing skills. Through formal analysis and the exploration of performance interpretation, these aspects can be better understood.\n\nCAI, XIAWEI y 蔡夏微. \"A Study on the Style in the Keyboard Sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757)\".

D. Scarlatti pushed the creation and performance of keyboard music to a new level. This dissertation conducts a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the style, performance skills and music structure of the unique music language of D. Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas. This dissertation consists of five chapters. The first chapter, \"introduction\", introduces the research object, scope, method, motivation and purpose of this dissertation, as well as relevant literature discussion. The second chapter, \"an overview of D. Scarlatti’s life and music\", this chapter studies D. Scarlatti's family, court position and music cultural environment experience in different countries to understand D. Scarlatti's living background and early music education and deduce the objectivity of his keyboard sonata style. The third chapter, \"creative origin\", studies and classifications the creative origin of D. Scarlatti sonatas, traces the possible sources of style, and analysis the overall style characteristics of his sonatas to promote the indepth understanding of his works. The fourth chapter, \"music structure and performance skills\", focuses on the analysis of his harmonic application, in terms of musical structure, as well as the characteristics of performance skills and the teaching significance of his sonatas. This chapter is an important part of D. Scarlatti's sonata style. The fifth chapter \"conclusion\", this chapter is to summarize the full dissertation. Based on the overall analysis and research of D. Scarlatti sonatas, this dissertation discusses the music style of D. Scarlatti sonatas by focusing on the technical characteristic and structure of D. Scarlatti sonatas, and tries to make some contributions to the research of D. Scarlatti sonatas."
