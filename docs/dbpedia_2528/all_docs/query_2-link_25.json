        "text": "His brilliant Treatise on Harmony (1722) is a work which\n\noffered what many historians of music theory and composition regard as the most\n\npowerful and persuasive presentations of the harmonic and contrapuntal ideas\n\nwhich dominate the analysis of music to this day. This treatise, plus\n\nRameau’s impressive organ and harpsichord works, would be quite enough to\n\nhave guaranteed his preeminence among eighteenth-century French musicians.\n\nThere was, however, even more to Rameau than this: Rameau the opera composer,\n\nthe orchestrator, the dramatist, the creator of impressive and unforgettable\n\nmusical vistas and choral tableaus which had direct and telling\n\ninfluences on the great composers of the latter century, particularly Gluck and\n\nMozart. It is in these wonderful operas that we see why Rameau was so popular\n\nin the court of Louis XV, and why the leading philosophical and literary\n\nfigures of the day admired his talent and worked on his libretti.\n\nThe beautiful selection of works provided in this recording allows the\n\nmodern listener to view and enjoy the spectacle of five of Rameau’s most\n\npopular operatic creations in historically accurate performances, most of them\n\nunder the baton of William Christie, one of the most remarkable figures in the\n\nhistory of modern baroque performance practice. Such a set of recordings will\n\nbe of special use to any professor or teacher of courses in baroque opera,\n\ndance, or stagecraft, and for any student of opera history. Along with this, as\n\na special treat, the set includes a performance of In Convertendo, a\n\nGrand Motet from the composer’s youth, as a part of an informative\n\ndocumentary on the composer. The operas selected (those directed by Christie\n\ninclude Les Indes Galantes, Les BorÈades, Les\n\nPaladins; Zoroastre and Castor et Pollux are directed by\n\nChristie’s long-time associate, Christophe Rousset) include three of the most\n\npopular in the repertoire (i.e., Les Indes Galantes, Castor et\n\nPollux, and Les BorÈades). Of this group, Les Indes Galantes was\n\nundeniably the favorite work of the composer in his day — it was wildly\n\npopular as an operatic tour de force set in a series of different\n\nexotic locales, and featuring the gamut of musical effects and fanciful plot\n\nlines which even today remain charming and highly entertaining. The work\n\nreceived special mention in the very first barrage of the most famous pamphlet\n\nwar of the century, the Querelle des Bouffons, when in 1752 Baron\n\nd’Holbach mocked those “good citizens” who “could not hear the\n\novertures to Les Indes galantes and Les Talents lyriques\n\nwithout shuddering.”\n\nChristie’s production of Les Indes galantes helps us understand\n\nwhy the work was so popular. Les Arts Florissants Orchestra and Chorus, and the\n\nsets and costumes of Marina Draghici in the staging by Andrei Serban, make a\n\npowerful impression. This work, best described as an opera-ballet due\n\nto the extensive use of dance, is made up of four large sections and a\n\nprologue, with each of the four sections representing a different non-European\n\nculture (i.e., The Turks, The Incas, The Persians, and by far the liveliest\n\ngroup — The American Savages). Throughout the production the vocal and\n\ninstrumental quality of the performances is very high. After the obligatory\n\nprologue of the gods, the first entrÈe presents the world of the Turks, with a\n\nspecial focus on the humanity of Osman (sung competently by Nicolas Cavallier)\n\nwho assists in reunited lovers lost at sea. Anna Maria Panzarella shines in\n\nthis scene as the heroic Emilie. Nathan Berg is outstanding as Huascar in the\n\nsecond entrÈe, as is the wonderful ceremonial quality of the scenes of the\n\nIncas, which can be viewed as forerunners to similar marvelous ceremonial\n\npassages in Gluck and Mozart (e.g., Orfeo ed Euridice,\n\nIdomeneo, The Magic Flute). Special praise should be given to\n\nthe wonderful volcanic eruption scene which concludes this portion of the\n\nopera, which contains is a delightful and exciting example of Rameau’s keen\n\nsense of orchestral drama. The third section of the opera, Les Fleurs —\n\nfÍte persane, allows us to experience the wonderful voice of Richard\n\nCroft, who is excellent in the role of Tacmas, and the highly enjoyable\n\nchoreograpy of Blanca Li, whose dancers excel in the famous Ballet des\n\nfleurs, rising out of pots like blooming flowers. Christie and his team\n\nreserve their best work for the finale of the opera, Les Sauvages.\n\nPatricia Petibon provides us with a most memorable Zima, whose on-stage\n\ngyrations and coquettish demeanor is perfectly suited for her role as the\n\nsought-after Indian princess. Christie’s contribution to this last scene is\n\npalpable, as the orchestral accompaniment literally pulsates, creating an\n\nunforgettable impression. It is Petebon who says later, in the documentary\n\nattached to the production (“Swinging Rameau”) that “an American has\n\nrediscovered our repertoire!”\n\nThe remaining works in the Opus Arte set, while not quite equaling the\n\nproduction of Les Indes Galantes in musical impact, are all of\n\ninterest to the connoisseur. Christie and Les Arts Florissants\n\nversions of Les Paladins and Les BorÈades (a work not staged\n\nin the composer’s lifetime due to its Masonic themes) are solid and musically\n\nconvincing, and their production of the wonderful motet In Convertendo is\n\nhighly effective and memorable. Michael Levine’s sets and costume designs for\n\nLes BorÈades are eye-catching imitations of Dior, but it is the\n\nperformance of Barbara Bonney as Alphise and Paul Agnew as Abaris which is the\n\nmost powerful aspect of the recording. The least attractive work in the set is\n\neasily Les Paladins, which features quirky but amateurish choreography, sets,\n\nand stage direction by JosÈ Montalvo and Dominque Hervieu.\n\nRousset’s version of Castor et Pollux (featuring Les Talens\n\nLyriques and the Chorus of the Netherlands Opera) is impressive, and the roles\n\nof the tragic brothers (Finnur Bjarnason as Castor and Henk Neven as Pollux)\n\nare beautifully sung. Patrick Kinmonth’s sets and costumes are minimalistic\n\nbut effective. Rousset’s direction of Zoroastre — another\n\nMasonic-themed work — is also a treat, featuring the Drottningholm Theatre\n\nOrchestra and Chorus as well as Les Talens Lyriques. This disc includes a\n\nfascinating documentary which provides wonderful back-stage views of the famous\n\nDrottningholm theatre. Anders Dahlin, who sings the title role, is masterful in\n\nhis interpretation, which is both lyric and agile as the occasion demands.\n\nDonald R.
