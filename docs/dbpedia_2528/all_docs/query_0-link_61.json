This document is the first chapter of a novel about a man named Durtal who is tired of living in Chartres and is drawn to monastic life. He has visited the Abbey of Solesmes multiple times, finding the Benedictine lifestyle there more lenient than the austere Cistercian order he witnessed at La Trappe. However, he also feels uneasy at Solesmes due to its large size and regimented atmosphere. He analyzes his conflicting feelings but cannot decide if the lifestyle is right for him long term.",
