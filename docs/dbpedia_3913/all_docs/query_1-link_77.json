        "text": "World War II Memorial, Washington D.C. (must see)\n\nThe World War II Memorial has a grand design that reflects the vastness of a war that spanned the entire globe. Two arches at either end of the memorial are symbolic of the Pacific and Atlantic areas of fighting. 56 pillars are arranged in two semicircles around both arches that represent the 48 states at the time of the war and the District of Columbia, plus the territories of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Philippines.\n\nThe walls between the arches and in front of the pillars depict scenes that were typical of the Pacific and European theaters of the war. These are depicted in bas relief. An engraving of the ubiquitous “Kilroy Was Here” is also present. \"Kilroy Was Here\" is a meme that became popular during World War II, typically seen in graffiti. Its origin is debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle became associated with GIs in the 1940s.\n\nOn the west side sits the Freedom Wall that contains 4,048 gold stars each one representing 100 American soldiers who died or remain missing during WWII. Behind the Freedom Wall is the Reflecting Pool on the Mall. In front of the wall is the World War II Memorial Rainbow Pool and the stars reflect in the water. It makes for a very moving scene.\n\nAlmost 2/3 of the site is water or landscaping so the components of the memorial really stand out. The site is available for visiting 24 hours a day except around Memorial Day activities. Rangers are on hand to answer questions from around 10am to 11pm.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nOne of the more formal-style memorials, it carries a certain gravity, conveys a somber nature, and provides lots of space to reflect on the drama of WWII.\n\nThe small bronze relief panels on the walls show scenes of different wartime activities that give you a bit more insight into the lives of people during the war.\n\nThe entire site sits on a little over seven acres, so wear comfortable walking shoes.\n\nTip:\n\nEntry is free but do it on a clear day if you can. On a wet day, there is nowhere much to shelter. If you join a guided tour, it's recommended to get some explanation of all the symbolism and pageantry."
