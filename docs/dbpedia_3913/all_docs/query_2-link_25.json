        "text": "Did soldiers of WW1 believe that it was all a bit of a lark and an adventure?\n\nNo. Another fallacy. It is possible (even probable) that the first blokes to join the AIF did so with little understanding of what was to follow and did so with a false impression of quick victory and glory for all. However it is impossible to believe that the later recruits, who having read the casualty lists from Gallipoli, Fromelles and other early battles could have been under any mis-apprehension about the serious nature of the task.\n\nThey knew what the difficulties were, and the risks. This is indicated by the fact that as the war dragged on and the \"butcher's bill\" got higher so too was there was a lessening of the numbers of eager recruits. These were the blokes called \"Fair Dinkums\" because if they enlisted even after seeing the casualty lists they must be \"fair dinkum\". Sydney Milgate (below) is but one example.\n\nFred Milgate went ashore at ANZAC with the 7th Battalion. He was last seen in the afternoon of the first day and is believed to have been killed during a Turkish counter-attack. He was 21.\n\nHis younger brother Sydney enlisted not long after receiving news of Freds death; he served on the Western Front and was killed in Belgium in 1917. AWM H06088\n\nIf the Lee Enfield had a \"short magazine\" what was a \"long magazine\"?\n\nThis is a common misconception. The word \"short\" refers to the rifle, not the magazine. To quote an expert.........\"was unveiled in 1903 as the \"Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield, Mark 1\", the famous S.M.L.E. It took me quite some time to realise that, with the somewhat awkward, back-to-front nomenclature of British ordnance, the word \"short\" designation referred to the rifle, not the magazine!\n\nWhereas the magazine had the same dimensions as before, the rifle was indeed shorter than its predecessor. The idea was that the S.M.L.E. would be in between rifle and carbine length, and thus serve both functions. Barrel length was now 25 inches, and the robust, bull-dog nose cap/sight protector was introduced. Finally refined as the S.M.L.E. No.1 Mark 3 in 1907, it was lighter and handier than the long Lee-Enfield, was sighted for the new Mark 7 .303 ammunition, had the desired clip feed facility (or \"charger loading\", as the British termed it) and possessed an excellent set of open sights, which could now be readily zeroed. More details\n\nAs an associated trivia piece the bayonet was lengthened by the \"lost\" 5 inches to retain the total strike value of the combined rifle/bayonet assembly.\n\nWas it common to have brothers serve at Gallipoli?\n\nYes. There was the Curlewis brothers. 4 landed at Gallipoli on April 25th, 3 with the 16th Bn & 1 with the 12th Bn. Only 1 brother survived.\n\nLt Col Malone of the NZEF, the hero of (and KIA at) Chunuk Bair was at Gallipoli and so were two of of his 4 sons. The other two sons (from a second marriage) were too young to serve at that time.\n\nFrancis Longworth (1st ALH) and his 3 brothers Archibald (6th ALH), George (6th ALH) and Hugh (6th ALH) were all there during October 1915.\n\nAnother family (the Wheeler's) had all 6 brothers serve at Gallipoli, 5 with the 16th Bn & 1 with the 10th ALH.\n\nCharles Handcock of Myrrhee, Victoria, had eight sons serve in the war.\n\nAlbert (photo left) was killed at Anzac on the first day of battle, while one of his brothers would later die on the last day of the war.\n\nAlbert went ashore at ANZAC with the 7th Battalion and was killed; his body was never found.\n\nAt the infamous charge at the Nek, four sets of brothers died.\n\nSpare a thought for the Beechey family of WA in WW1. They sent 8 sons to war, including some to Gallipoli. 5 were killed. 1 was crippled for life. 2 survived intact. Details.\n\nWhat were the New Zealand Regimental Numbers of WW1?\n\nService numbers and service person's name might be found on a service persons headstone, death notice in newspaper or on the reverse side of the 1914-1915 Star. A soldier enlisted 17 August 1914 and was at Gallipoli in the NZ Army Medical Corps and his service number was 3/133A. The Army sometimes doubled up on service numbers, so instead of giving out new ones they added the A. When ordering a Service Personnel File include the A otherwise could end up with the service file of the person who had a similar number e.g. 3/133.\n\nThe following prefixes were used for WW1 service numbers of troops. Extracted from \"Orders, Decorations and Medals awarded to New Zealanders - an illustrated guide for collectors\" by Geoffrey P. Oldham and Brett Delahunt.\n\n1/ Samoan Advance Force\n\n2/ Royal New Zealand Artillery\n\n3/ New Zealand Medical Corps\n\n4/ New Zealand Engineers\n\n5/ New Zealand Army Service Corps\n\n6/ Canterbury Infantry\n\n7/ Canterbury Mounted Rifles\n\n8/ Otago Rifles\n\n9/ Otago Mounted Rifles\n\n10/ Wellington Rifles\n\n11/ Wellington Mounted Rifles\n\n12/ Auckland Rifles\n\n13/ Auckland Mounted Rifles\n\n14/ Army Service Corps Divisional Train\n\n15/ New Zealand Expeditionary Force Headquarters Staff\n\n16/ Maori Battalion\n\n17/ New Zealand Veterinary Corps\n\n18/ New Zealand Chaplains Department\n\n19/ Samoan Relief Force, Infantry\n\n20/ Samoan Relief Force, Mounted Rifles\n\n21/ New Zealand Army Pay Corps\n\n22/ New Zealand Nursing Service\n\n23/ 1st Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade\n\n24/ 2nd Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade\n\n25/ 3rd Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade\n\n26/ 4th Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade\n\nThis system was employed until the formation of the Tenth Reinforcements, following which the prefix was omitted and a strict numerical sequence was used.\n\nThe Ode: is it condemn or contemn?\n\nEvery year, after ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day, the Department of Veterans Affairs receives many letters asking about The Ode.\n\nThe issue raised by most letters is whether the last word of the second line should be condemn or contemn. Contemn means to despise or treat with disregard, so both words fit the context.\n\nThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:\n\nAge shall not weary them,\n\nnor the years condemn. (\"contemn\"?)\n\nAt the going down of the sun\n\nand in the morning\n\nWe will remember them.\n\nDVAs Commemorations Branch has been researching the poem and its background. The lines comprise the fourth stanza of the poem For the Fallen by Laurence Binyon, and were written in the bleak early days of World War 1. By mid-September 1914, less than seven weeks after the outbreak of war, the British Expeditionary Force in France had already suffered severe casualties. During this time, long lists of the dead and wounded appeared in British newspapers. It was against this background that Binyon, then the Assistant Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote For the Fallen. This poem was first published in The Times on 21 September 1914.\n\nThe Times shows condemn. Some people have suggested that the use of \"condemn\" in The Times was a typographical error. If it were, one would have expected then that the word would be correctly shown in The Winnowing Fan, published only a few months later and for which Binyon would have had galley proofs on which to mark amendments. Binyon was a highly educated man and very precise in his language and use of words. There is no doubt that had he intended \"contemn\", then it would have been used.\n\nThere have been variations in punctuation within the poem across the years and a change in the spelling from stanch to staunch. Dr John Hatcher, who published in 1995 an exhaustive biography of Binyon, does not even refer to any possible doubt over condemn/contemn, despite devoting a solid chapter to For the Fallen.\n\nThe British Society of Authors, who are executors of the Binyon estate, says the word is definitely \"condemn\", while the British Museum, where Binyon worked, says its memorial stone also shows \"condemn\". Both expressed surprise when told there had been some debate about the matter in Australia. Interestingly, the text used in 1916 by Sir Edward Elgar to set the poem to music has eight stanzas; the eighth being inserted between what now is regarded as the third and fourth stanzas.\n\nThe condemn/contemn issue seems to be a distinctly Australian phenomenon. Inquiries with the British, Canadian, and American Legions reveal that none has heard of the debate. Despite an exhaustive search by Commemorations Branch through Binyons published anthologies, no copy of the poem using \"contemn\" was found. The two-volume set Collected Poems, regarded as the definitive version of Binyons poems, uses \"condemn\". Although inquiries are continuing, there now seems little prospect of finding anything to support even a little the \"contemn\" claim.\n\nIn Australia, the Returned and Services League, in its League handbook, shows \"condemn\", while a representative of the Australian War Memorial said it always uses \"condemn\" in its ceremonies. So how did the confusion start? No-one knows, but certainly the question has been debated for many years. Surely now its time to put the matter to rest.\n\nInformation courtesy of Department of Veterans' Affairs\n\nWhat did entering the army include?\n\nContract of unlimited liability: Someone who becomes a soldier is crossing a legally defined boundary, giving up some of the individual rights he hitherto enjoyed (such as the right to withdraw his labour), accepting collective standards which contribute to the common good, and undertaking, in the last analysis, to kill or be killed for a purpose in which he may have no personal interest. General Sir John Hackett called this \"the contract of unlimited liability\". However closely the army may come to resemble society, and however rarely it is called upon to apply lethal force, this essential characteristic still remains.\n\nThe process of turning a man into a soldier and the discipline that underpins it has changed over time, and is complicated by the fact that society, too, is never static, and what was acceptable this year may not be so next. An age in which men were deferential, inured to hardship and had low expectations produced raw material quite different from that in an age where they are non-deferential, litigious and inclined to question authority.\n\nI have books that say the Anzacs landed at Gaba Tepe. Why do you say otherwise?\n\nMany books and accounts written at the time and just after refer to the landings at Gaba Tepe (Kabatepe). That is where the Anzacs were supposed to land. That's what the orders said. That is what the troops believed, sometimes for years after the war. In some cases that is what citations for medals said. However, it never happened. It is just another indication of the poor planning and the confusion that bugged the Gallipoli Campaign from the start.\n\nThe boats either set off from poorly positioned RN ships, or drifted north or were steered north (by over a mile) and the landings took place at Ari Burnu (Anzac Cove and North Beach). Gaba Tepe was never seriously attacked and was the site of a small but troublesome 4 gun Turkish artillery unit during the entire campaign. Even 2 months after the landings Field Marshal Kitchener did not know that the Anzacs were not at Gaba Tepe.\n\nWhy do American junior Officers get gold insignia & seniors get silver?\n\nOnce upon a time army officers wore gold or silver epaulettes on the shoulders of their uniforms. On the silver epaulette the rank insignia was in gold bullion embroidery for contrast and vice-versa for gold epaulettes with silver rank badges. Generals wore a gold epaulettes with one or two embroidered silver stars for either Brigadier or Major General. A full Colonel wore a large silver eagle. Second\n\nLieutenants wore plain gold or silver epaulettes and a First Lieutenant had a bar of contrasting colour and Captains wore two bars. Majors wore no rank insignia on their epaulettes which were larger than those of subalterns (junior officers), the rank of Lieutenant Colonel was added and they were given a silver leaf on gold as they were staff officers, while Cavalry and other arms wore silver epaulettes. Silver epaulettes were eliminated and only gold epaulettes were retained, when it was decided to award Majors a leaf, it was gold as the silver leaf was already used by Lieutenant Colonels, thus silver outranked gold. In 1872 they switched from a gold bar or two gold bars for First Lieutenants and Captains, they became silver too! In 1917 a Second Lieutenant was given a rank insignia of the formerly used gold bar. During the First World War until 1924, rank insignia was darkened bronze."
