        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI am doing metal detection and I found a 50 cal cartridge made in 1943 by the Lake City Army Ammunition plant. The location of this finding is here:\n\nI made some research and I think this cartridge is related to the Tidal Wave operation:\n\nMy question is whether this cartridge has value to collectors.\n\nHello catalin, welcome!\n\nFirst of all this is not a cartridge but only a case (which is a part of a cartridge), a fired case actually.\n\nduring WW2 almost all Europe was “littered” of cases, from land or aerial operation, so it is highly possible that it belongs to the historical moment you mentioned.\n\nValue? Only as a little treasure for the man who digged it out…\n\nWelcome Catalin!\n\nValue to a collector is very subjective. Personally, I have cartridges and fired cases in my collection that have bona-fide connections to historic conflicts. They have a special place in my collection but have little real \"value \".\n\nThere is an old adage in the collector world: “Buy the item, not the story”. Your cartridge case on it’s own is pretty common. To the right person, it being very likely from an historic event during WWII makes it special. The trick is finding that person.\n\nI think your item is pretty interesting and if it were me, I’d keep it and enjoy the connection to history that it gives.\n\nTks for the reply @AKMS, I am not trying to sell, I was just curious if there is an interesting item.\n\nIn my detection activities I found a lot of fired cases but this is not a common case. In WW2 there were 2 major aerial “visits” from the allied forces, in 1943 and 1944. Maybe I will make a donation to the Romanian Military Museum\n\nTo me, the item has great historical interest. I knew two B-24 Liberator bomber crewmen, one a distant relative, that flew on the Ploesti missions. I got to read the relatives’ mission log book years ago and one of the Ploesti raids was just another entry. At the time, no one could have guessed what an iconic mission it would become.\n\nI think donating it to a museum is a fine idea!\n\nOne clue, if anyone knows the answers, would be “what US airplanes on the described mission had guns that ejected the cartridges out of the fuselage of the aircraft?”\n\nI am not into airplanes - don’t even like riding in them - which is why I don’t suggest some types. I only know I have seen films of aerial combat where clearly the empty cases from an aircraft firing its guns are ejecting out of some sort of ejection port under the plane. I seem recall most of those were fighters, though.\n\nWell, probably no help, but thought I would mention it.\n\nJohn M.\n\nI agree with your view that cases fired from bombers were normally kept within the aircraft. But according to the Wikipedia article cited by catalin, 53 aircraft were lost in the attack. So there was in my opinion plenty of opportunity for fired cases ending up on the ground in Romania.\n\nSome of the gun turrets on US bombers ejected the empty cases as well as wing mounted fighter aircraft guns.\n\nIn particular, the Sperry ball turret used on the B-17 and B-24 had openings for the empties to escape. Some period movie films of the turrets in action show this happening. Edited to add: Oddly enough the empty belt links ended up inside the turret with the gunner and he had to scoop them out of the way by hand.\n\nThis item could have come from a fighter or bomber.\n\nThanks for the answers. I agree that there are lots of ways a .50 cal. casing could end up on the ground of a target area, especially if the bombers, or their fighter escorts if they had them, had to fight off enemy aircraft over or about the target area.\n\nJohn\n\nAlso take into account spent cases could accumulate within the Fuselage of a B24 or B17, and had to be physically shovelled out of the plane on return flights, to lighten the Aircraft, especially if plane was damaged or had an engine KO.\n\nEven Guns were jettisoned at times. The Ploesti Raids, were ill-conceived, as the Oil Field were at almost maximum range for fully efficient aircraft, from Southern Italy, or North Africa.\n\nI don’t know the availability of suitable landing grounds in British Palestine or occupied ex-Vichy Syria.\n\nItaly seemed the closest, but most dangerous ( German and RSI airforces) and Romania also Strong Luftwaffe and Romanian Fighter groups.\n\nFlights from Egypt, Libya, had to avoid Neutral Turkey…the detour across Greece and Bulgaria did not help either. And what US fighter cover could effectively fly that far?\n\nYes, the .50cal Case in Romania is historically significant…it says \" Kilroy was Here\" ie, USAAF; just like Roman coins and message tablets at Hadrian’s wall said \" Roma hic est\".\n\nDocAV\n\nVery good point, I asked myself the same question. One hypothesis would be that on the route there were fights, and the planes were hit, there were holes in the fuselage through which such objects could have been lost.\n\nI am glad to discover here people who are passionate about history and who ask questions and seek answers like me.\n\nBeside Wikipedia I recommend also this source:\n\nMy late friend Wayne Marley was a side gunner in the Halvorsen Detachment, the unit assigned to the missions. They flew B-24D aircraft. He made both trips and survived. The side guns were fired from large rectangular openings, with the gunners standing on aluminum planking. We visited a museum aircraft where Wayne demonstrated how it was done. He never mentioned fired cartridge cases, but it was obvious that cases and links had to be ejected clear of the gun, gunner and gunner’s footing, lest they interfere with operations.\n\nThe interior of the aircraft was a maze of fuselage bracing, pipes, electrical wires and control cables, with alum. planking forming an incomplete floor. Had fired cases been ejected inside, there would have been a large number of places for them to accumulate, possibly causing mechanical difficulties, adding unnecessary weight and clean-up problems. Ejecting the cases forward and outside the aircraft would avoid all that."
