        "text": "Contrary to popular belief, the first soldier to draw Kilroy was a Canadian during the Great War. But if you see the “Kilroy Was Here” cartoon around town, we didn’t leave the graffito; we value Rye too highly to deface it.\n\nAs fourth time visitors to Rye from Canada, we were invited to write a few words reflecting our thoughts and feelings about your lovely town. We rent a house for three weeks, in May or September, make a nest for ourselves, go to church, visit our friends, make new friends and have a completely blessed time. Residents would be surprised how many people in our town have visited Rye and hope to return. “Oh! I’ve been there,” is a not infrequent response when we mention Rye.\n\nPerhaps another time I will write about the good and the bad of short-term home rental; that issue is on our minds and consciences.\n\nWe chose Rye as a destination back in 2017 for a three-week visit in part because of the Franciscan church. Our history readings and Google maps tour convinced us Rye was the right choice. I recollect we arrived on a Friday. On Sunday we met two couples on the church steps who immediately welcomed two strangers, took us for coffee at the Kino and laid the foundation for over seven years of friendship. We were welcomed by other folks as well that day who impressed us with their piety, their artistic skills, their friendliness and their warmth. They too continue to be close friends. The two couples who befriended us generously take us on wonderful driving tours each time we visit and share other delights in the greater vicinity.\n\nBy now, after 12 weeks as temporary residents, we know Rye as well as our own town. We have visited every attraction, know most of the pubs, have had cream tea at most eateries and have purchased excellent salmon at the two waterside fisheries. Amazingly, two different sets of owners at the Rope Walk cafe recognise and remember us. One of the staff members at Jempson’s is the world’s friendliest cashier; I jokingly invited her to come to Ontario to train grocery store staff in good customer service. And the teasing tradition continues with Malcolm, the unflappable bar man at the Hope Anchor; what a lovely gentleman he is. Sadly, some of our acquaintances have passed away. We miss Ron Peters, another fine gentleman and skilled calligrapher with whom we have an artistic connection.\n\nOur most recent rental is close to the war memorial at St Mary’s church. It is sobering and saddening to see all the names inscribed on the memorial column; it is particularly striking to see multiples of the same family names of those lost in the Great War. And we had daily reminders that one of our dear friends lost her father in the second world war.\n\nAs regular readers of Rye News we were stunned and saddened to learn the Foodbank was meeting extensive need; we read with concern our friend’s articles about the work of the Foodbank and the generosity of Rye residents. Similarly, we were shocked by the fire at the the George. For our farewell dinner this April we chose the George and friends who joined us gave us a tour of the hotel. It is stunningly beautiful. We congratulate the owners for what they have achieved in rebuilding the George. It will continue to be a credit to Rye.\n\nAs with previous visits we made new friends, this time in the artistic community. They too will keep us returning. Knowing Rye as well as we do, we contend it is our friends and the town people who bring us back to our second home.\n\nVictor Clarke, Teresa Nocera-Clarke Kingston Ontario Canada\n\nImage Credits: Victor Clarke , Kenneth Bird , Abigail Cooper-Hansen ."
