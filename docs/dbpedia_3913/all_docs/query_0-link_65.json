        "text": "Poll Results\n\nHere are the results of our two week long unscientific poll about the age of our readers (11-26-00 to 12/09/00). I expected (and indeed they started that way for the first few days) that the readers would be older. For the first few days the Silent Generation led followed closely by the GI Generation. It now appears that, like the rest of the Internet, younger folks lead in usage. At first I was disappointed that the youngest was third from bottom until I thought it through. The \"D\" Generation Age group is so truncated at the lower end. That is, there are fewer one year olds reading the site that the first ages of each other group (19, 40, 58, or 75).\n\nAccording to Strauss and Howe, authors of Generations, The \"X\" Generation is more like the \"Lost\" Generation (named by Gertrude Stein and picked up by Hemingway in The Sun Also Rises) than any others so maybe it isn't surprising that they read Kilroy.\n\nThere was a single click on \"Lost\" Generation indicating that one person voted who was 100 years old or older. To the one who clicked the \"Lost\" Generation vote and if you are, indeed, a member of the fabled \"Lost\" Generation, please contact Kilroy Was Here.\n\nIs there a real statistician there? If so, tell us what this means.\n\nAircraft Recognition Slides\n\nAircraft Recognition! Of vital importance from the Battle of Britain to the Cold War. A/C spotters from childhood to combat had to recognize aircraft, enemy and friendly, instantly. This is an actual A/C recognition set of slides used by the USN through 1955. These were flashed on a screen for 1/30 second. Students had to recognize type, country of origin, and general flight characteristics.\n\nA common practice in those days, when individuals complained that it was impossible to see so much so quickly, was to secretly include a slide of a pin-up nude. After she was flashed on the screen, students were able to describe every detail of her anatomy. There was no longer any argument about being able to recognize A/C so fast.\n\nThese slides were in use in 1955. There is some deterioration so some have been \"enhanced.\" Some are cropped because the original showed a very small image that had to be recognized and some have been enlarged. They are now sorted according to identification. Imagine these flashed at random and you expected to identify them.\n\nGroup #1 A3D SkyWarrior to British Attacker\n\nGroup #2 B-35 Flying Wing to Badger, USSR Jet Bomber\n\nGroup #3 Bear, USSR Bomber to C-82 Packet, US Army Transport\n\nGroup #4 F-100 Supersabre to F-11F Tiger\n\nGroup #5 F2H-1 Banshee to F7U-3 Cutlass\n\nGroup #6 F-89 Scorpion to FJ-4 Fury\n\nGroup #7 Flashlight, USSR Fighter to MD-450, Ouragan French Fighter\n\nGroup #8 Meteor British Jet to R3Y Tradewind USN Patrol\n\nGroup #9 R7V-2 Super Constellation to Victor British Jet Bomber\n\nGroup #10 Vixon DH110 British Jet Fighter to YAK-15 USSR Jet Fighter\n\nBook Review:\n\nWritten by Robert L. McMahon, 23 February 2001\n\nNo, this isn't John Wayne and \"Sands of Iwo Jima\". This is a story of American youth and a time of American innocence.\n\nWho were these six young, skinny kids in this photograph? The photo itself went on to become an icon of the 20th Century, but the men have remained largely six enigmatic figures against the horizon. Three of them would never know what impact this photo, and their actions, had on a country. The three survivors would know only too well.\n\nIt's with heartfelt appreciation as a former Marine that I thank James Bradley for taking on this very personal and very emotional subject. His father, PM2C John Bradley, USN was truly made of greater stuff than most folks. His son's book is one of the most fitting tributes to a father's memory I could ever imagine.\n\nThis was indeed the time of his life and what a life it is! The title includes the words \"Memoirs of a government agent from Pearl Harbor to the Golden Triangle.\" My interests, however kept me mesmerized through the WWII part. With matter-of-fact casualness Swain tells of having his B-17 shot down over occupied France. With understatement common to \"The Greatest Generation,\" he details escaping with the help of the French Underground and of a personal greeting from the Pope after working his way back though the Vatican in liberated Rome. Any of these adventures, including the parallel story of escape and evasion by his tail gunner, would make a book on its own well worth the price. But the tale continues from WWII through another tour in the Air Force, the FBI, the CIA, DEA, and the war in Viet Nam. We will all love reliving his rolling reminders of the details of the 50's from Salk to Hula Hoops to the U-2 incident\n\nSwain's story starts with Basic training in 1944 with details ranging from the familiar \"Take all you want but eat what you take\" to saltpeter. Then on to B-17 training at Hendricks Field in Sebring, Florida. Later, like so many incongruities, he was qualified to fly a B-17 but could not legally drive a car  no drivers license!\n\nAlthough the book ends on a sad note (the loss of his beloved wife Phyllis) it is, throughout, an upbeat and optimistic life story and well worth the price of admission. You can get your copy by e-mailing him at: adianno@aol.com .\n\nBook Review\n\nSee Here, Private Hargrove\n\n1942, Marion Hargrove, author\n\nby Jay Robert Cook\n\nI recently picked up this book at an estate sale. If you have ever been in boot camp or if you would find interest in what it was like from a private's perspective in the 40's, it is well worth the effort to track down a copy.\n\nPrivate Hargrove enters basic training bewildered by the new rules, language, and chores he must master. He unpacks army rifles covered with grease, pulls KP, suffers bumpy rides under a canvas topped lorry, empties ashes from coal fired ovens, and shovels \"vitamin deposits\" left by the cavalry. He is definitely a $21 a day once a month man; but, like thousands before him and since, he conforms with good humor and becomes a proud and loyal soldier.\n\nI had trouble identifying with Hargrove as I wasn't even born when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor; but, I did perceive through all the antics and tales, the making of young men fully capable of \"giving em hell\" as they rolled out of the train station for battle overseas.\n\nHas anyone out there ever heard of the \"selective retirement system\"? Hargrove mentions the drafting of soldiers back into civilian life, but never explains how or why it was done. It apparently had nothing to do with years of service as he describes a Corporal who was sent home after five months of duty.\n\n\"Hey, I'm alive!' Drew blacked out. When he came to, he found himself on a beach, naked protected only by a raincoat thrown over him. He heard a faint voice Throw him in there too.' Drew, realizing that they thought he was dead, yelled.\" This is just one of many harrowing tales of a life and death struggle resulting from the SS Leopoldville sinking. SS Leopoldville Disaster, December 24, 1944, by Allan Andrade (The Tern Book Company., $21.95) is the story of this troopship loaded with American troops being rushed to the help in the Battle of the Bulge. It was sunk barely five miles from shore taking with it 763 American servicemen.\n\nThe book consists of many short stories detailing individual accounts of the disaster. Even the Introduction has 38. These were compiled from hundreds of interviews and research. Andrade includes many actual copies of letters. Perhaps the most moving are letters from parents to their sons before they knew they were dead. One story in particular is very moving: \"Lt. Gene Barwick died that night. They never recovered his body. Each Christmas Eve reminded Barwick's parents of his death. His young bride eventually remarried and had two children but 20 years after her first love's death, she took her own life on a Christmas Eve.\"\n\nMany who died were only 18 to 21 years old and came from 47 of the (then) 48 states. All are listed by state in the In Memoriam Section at the end of the book as are the survivors.\n\nThis disaster was kept secret for many years. It was understandable during the war but not so afterwards. Allan Andrade has done a service to the nation and to the families of those lost with his book. It is well done, and an easy read  well worth your time!\n\nNote: Those of you who reside in NYC, check out www.queenslibrary.org. Click on \"Programs for Adults\" where you will see the June schedule. Allan will be giving his slide lectures and display of Leopoldville memorabilia. He was consulted for the History Channel's Leopoldville show about the disaster. See www.historychannel.com then click on \"All Exhibits.\"\n\nYou can contact the author directly at: agandrade@earthlink.net or order the book from:\n\nAmazon Books\n\nBarnes and Noble\n\nSee Tony Leone's commants on the Leopoldville\n\nThis is a book as unique as its subject, the F4U Corsair. It offers insiders knowledge with real larger-than-life characters and is told with insight, detail and humor  lots of humor. The author claims Japanese Ace status having damaged, destroyed or otherwise put out of commission five American fighting aircraft. He adds, and after over 30 arrested carrier landings, I learned to drive a car. In training, upon being told it was time to solo, the instructor said, You tried to kill me enough times, now try it with a check pilot. The book features 43 stories by ten former Corsair pilots, 376 pages, 20 illustrations and photos, and 23 Corsair accident reports\n\nAnother reviewer says: If you know anyone who flew the Corsair  or wish they had  they would enjoy this book. . . This includes most everyone. The Corsair and the Mustang were the glamour fighters of WWII. To fly one of these was the dream of every pilot or pilot wannabe of that period. I might add, for anyone who has landed on one of the old straight deck carriers and silently thought, Ill be damned. its a must-read! His descriptions of carrier approaches and landings are superb. I felt like I was back in the cockpit  so very many details that I had forgotten.\n\nThe book is, in part, his own story as well as that of others.\n\nChapter 16 is devoted to Finding your lost flying buddies. It offers tips to help your search.\n\nPart II  Short stories by Daniel L. Polino. Some are sad (the loss of a buddy) and some interesting stories of the F4U.\n\nPart III  excerpts from a book by Owen Dykema called Letters from the Bird Barge. In these excerpts, Dykema takes credit for the carrier approach technique required of the F4U with its 15-foot long nose (no visibility to the front at approach speed). During the development of this technique, he had a running battle with the LSO, coining a new title, LSOB. His technique became the standard and is described in detail.\n\nPart IV  Stories told to the author by William Country Landreth. This part includes an excellent account of a crash landing and capture during WWII. You must read this!\n\nPart V  Stories from the book Tail End Charlies - Navy Combat Fighter Pilots at Wars End. by Roy D. Eric Erickson. I was transfixed by first hand details of carrier operations at sea during World War II. An unexpected call to duty resulted in his participation in the sinking of the 64,000-ton Yamato, the end of the world biggest battleship .\n\nPart VI  Stories by Wallace Bruce Thomson. After training, Thomson flew F4F Wildcats in Oahu but, as he graduated to Corsairs, continued through Turtle Bay, Bougainville, Rabaul and Green Island. All remind a WWII history buff like myself of the classic battles of the Pacific. Thomson accompanied the legendary Pappy Boyington when he was shot down (see below for information on the books Ba Ba Black Sheep by Gregory (Pappy) Boyington and Bye Bye Black Sheep by Masajiro Kawato, the Japanese ace who shot him down). During that same month Thomson himself shot down two Zeros and damaged a third. Thomson continues with interesting observations about Boyington and his Black Sheep Squadron, dispelling a few myths.\n\nBlechmans book concludes with stories by John R. Jack Eckstein, Cookie Cleland, Gene Hendrix, and Randy Moore  all of which are really good reading.\n\nSee http://www.expage.com/bentwings for more info\n\nThis is a 900+ page novel that depicts life in the US lnfantry from World War I through Vietnam. The main character in the book, Sam Damon, de- scribes: life in the military during battle; personal difficulties the soldier faces during peacetime; family life in the military; and the trials and tribulations of soldiers at every rank, in battle and in peacetime.\n\nMyrer is an outstanding military historian and the text of the novel is inter- spersed with personal musings, pains, triumphs, horrors, historical facts regarding military strategies, victories, defeats, and good or bad luck during battle throughout the history of human warfare. Because of the significance of the leadership implications, accuracy of depictions of war and peace, impact and relevancy of realism portrayed, and the training value inherent in this book, it is said to be required reading for officer students at military war colleges.\n\nI commend the reading of this outstanding book to all the KILROY WAS HERE people. The jacket of the book dis- closes that NBC made a 12-hour documentary series based on the book some time ago. I did not see the documentary and therefore cannot comment on that series.\n\nMy own reading of the book brought feelings of admiration for the soldiers described, anger at the many instances of poor leadership, horror at the atrocities described during wars, respect for the excellence of leadership of many of the soldiers, appreciation of the valor, bravery, and dedication of members of the US military, and empathy for the families of members of our professional military. Above all, the positive attitudes portrayed by Anton Myrer, through the voice of Sam Damon, reflect the leadership qualities that any military leader could well emulate.\n\nBurl E. Gilliland,\n\nCAPT USNR-R, Retired\n\nThis is a remarkably well written, detailed, almost scholarly book. While he uses his writing skills to fill in details like specific conversations, the facts are there and well documented (the copious footnotes give it the scholarly feel). The author, Charles A. Martin, calls it a \"novelized biography.\" His attention to detail and the filling in of blanks from hundreds of interviews makes this book as easy to read as a novel  indeed a \"novelized biography.\" His combat dogfight descriptions are about the best I've read -- almost makes you feel like you were there.\n\nEach chapter starts with a short quotation by some expert, including one by Capt. John Tilley (his story is here in the \"The Way We Were\" site.) One of the best is by Charles Martin himself: \"These hot shot pilots play a deadly game. Like the matador they trick and try their deadly foe. They must strike and kill, and see no more. If they took too long they might see that the foe is another matador.\"\n\nIt is, indeed, what they call a \"good read.\""
