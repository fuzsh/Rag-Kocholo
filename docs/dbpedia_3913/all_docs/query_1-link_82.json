        "text": "Last week, in a case resembling a Monty Python skit, a professor at England’s Newcastle University pled guilty to scrawling politely worded graffiti onto twenty-four luxury cars in the upscale British neighborhood of Jesmond. The professor, Stephen Graham, who is a specialist in urban life at the University’s School of Architecture, Planning, and Landscape, used a screwdriver to scratch gentle insults, such as “really wrong,” “very silly,” and “arbitrary,” onto the sides of various automobiles during a summer vandalism spree. While admitting his guilt, the forty-seven-year-old Graham claimed to have no recollection of the events of the night in question, blaming the spree on an unfortunate combination of alcohol and prescription drugs.\n\nGraham’s polite scratchings recall the era when graffiti first emerged in Manhattan. Not all early modern graffiti (in the subway or in other locales) was scatological; much of it revealed a highbrow sense of humor, as well as a surprising literary bent. The New Yorker took a special interest in the evolution of Manhattan graffiti in the forties and fifties. After the Second World War, the phrase “Kilroy was here” started appearing on buildings in the city, usually accompanied by the drawing of a bald-headed man peeking over a wall. American servicemen had started marking the doodle while they were stationed abroad; there were even contests in the Air Force to be the first to scrawl the phrase in isolated places across the globe. (In the mid-forties, the Times credited a shipyard inspector named James J. Kilroy with starting the craze.) In 1946, The New Yorker even published a maudlin poem by Rolfe Humphries about the “Kilroy” meme: each stanza chronicled some aspect of the decline of civilization, then ended with the uplifting refrain, “Look!—it is written: Kilroy was here.” The phrase, Humphries asserted in a prefatory note to the poem, testified to “the ardor, persistence, indestructibility, and omnipresence of the determined spirit of the heart of man in the fell clutch of circumstance.”\n\nIn the early fifties, other cheeky yet polite doodles and phrasings cropped up across the Manhattan landscape. In 1956, John Updike surveyed the local graffiti scene in a Talk of the Town story, which featured numerous illustrations of downtown scribbles. Manhattan’s vandals, Updike wrote, were as “pictoprogenitive” as those in the Old World. Amidst the drawings of plump women and stout hearts along the streets of Chinatown, he was able to locate a few hasty judgments (“Marsha is a boycatcher”; “Eddie is a double-crosser”), along with a sanguine vertical inscription, “I Love the World and I Love Love.” Updike was fascinated by the physical characteristics of various graffiti-laden neighborhoods. The “nook-ridden nature” of Mulberry Street, he wrote, gave graffiti artisans the sense of security they needed for more ambitious projects. Graffiti connoisseurs of the fifties knew to seek out the “less pampered sections” of the city for the truly great finds, those furtively detailed writings and illustrations which were “pressed like fossils in the folds of the city.”\n\nBeginning in the late fifties, The New Yorker ran a series of short Talk items about captivating graffiti slogans. Most of these accounts were brief, including simply the location and a description of the graffiti in question. The magazine chronicled an early example of literary graffiti that would take on greater artistic significance. In 1957, a keen-eyed New Yorker contributor published a small item about someone who had recently visited an “espresso joint” in Greenwich Village. The visitor took note of a phrase that was written, in elegant calligraphy, on the wall beside his chair: “Who’s afraid of Virginia Woolf?” Years later, the playwright Edward Albee, who was often asked about the title of his 1962 play, told The Paris Review how he’d been inspired by a line of graffiti that he had seen scrawled on the wall of a Greenwich Village establishment during the mid-fifties. Perhaps this was the very same scribbling the magazine had noted in its pages nearly five years before the play’s début.\n\nThroughout the following decade, The New Yorker recorded all manner of oddly civilized graffiti writing. In 1960, one observer noticed the phrase “Marcel Proust—Good Man” scratched on a pillar in the Forty-second Street station of the West Side I.R.T. Three years later, amidst a spate of various gang tags (“The Assassins,” “The Dusters”) appearing across the city’s subways, the magazine highlighted two interesting additions at an East Village station: “The Non-Violent Stompers” and “The Conservative Ladies.” In 1965, a commuter on a West Side express train took note of a subway ad for hair spray which featured the tagline, “Who says women are fickle?” Along the side of the ad, someone had pencilled in “Verdi.” In the mid-to-late sixties, graffiti tracked the city’s social and cultural changes. In 1967, the year of the Summer of Love, the magazine observed the phrase “Please practice empathy” scribbled on a building on East Forty-fourth Street, while a similar sentiment, “Peace is a cool scene,” was noticed on a subway-station wall in Flushing.\n\nBy the early seventies, with the advent of the spray can, the proliferation of graffiti slogans and accompanying art across the city landscape had become, as the art critic Harold Rosenberg put it, “the largest spontaneous mass outpouring of folk art” ever to have taken place. In 1971, W. H. Auden published one of his famous light poems, “Academic Graffiti” in the magazine, which featured such stanzas as “Lord Byron / Once succumbed to a Siren” and “Charles Dickens / Could find nothing to say to chickens.” The following year, the Times declared subway graffiti to be an “epidemic,” costing the Transit Authority more than five hundred thousand dollars in cleanup costs annually. Mayor John V. Lindsay, in a fit of political pique, declared war on the art form. But graffiti’s influence within the city continued to expand. Writers and artists such as TAKI 183, TRACY 168, and Fab 5 Freddy were gaining a foothold, tagging was gaining prominence, and graffiti’s sway in the rising punk and hip-hop scenes was increasing exponentially. (The New Yorker’s first graffiti cover, which featured an apartment-building wall splattered with colorful illustrations and tags, ran in the fall of 1973.)"
