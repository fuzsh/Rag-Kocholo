The majority of these will be familiar to modern readers. Included are each word’s earliest recorded usage in a military context. Some words are repeated from the earlier posted generalised list. Many of these terms had earlier usages, but the dates provided relate to their usage within a military context, either during either Steve’s era, or after.\n\nThe first list features words and terms used during Steve’s era, either by U.S. military personnel or in civilian contexts following WWI. It appears the use of military terms was quick-spreading among soldiers and other personnel, as such, it is likely the words in this list were known to Steve.\n\nThe second list of words and terms are those introduced within a military context after Steve went into the ice in 1945. The terms on this list are just as important as those introduced during Steve’s time in the 1920-1940s —it’s the terms in this list that will be new to Steve when he wakes in the 21st century. The terms on this lists would a) Be new and unfamiliar to Steve when he wakes up, and b) Should not be used by Steve (in fanfiction) until he has realistically become more familiar with the changes in the english language and military terminology while he was sleeping. Imagine you’re learning a new language, you don’t pick up all the formal and colloquial vocabulary at once, it’s generally a gradual process — though with his near-eidetic memory, Steve could viably consume a dictionary or military handbook, but even then he would need time to get used to using the new words in everyday conversation.\n\nPre-1945\n\nAce: An outstanding pilot — Technically, one who has brought down 10 enemy planes (1917)\n\nAmmo: Shortened form of ammunition (1917)\n\nArtillery: Warlike munitions (late 14th century)\n\nArtillery barrage: A line or barrier of exploding artillery shells, created by continuous and co-ordinated fire of a large number of guns (1917)\n\nBlitzkrieg: High-speed, offence tactics used by the German army in the opening months of WWII (1939)\n\nBlitz: Sudden, violent military attack, especially by air (1939)\n\nBlitz: Slang for any sudden dash or movement in or out of a place (1940)\n\nBomb: To attack with bombs (1909)\n\nClassified: Classified as secret for reasons of national security and forbidden to be disclosed except to specified persons (1944)\n\nCommando: A member of a body of picked men trained originally as shock troops for repelling the threatened German invasion of England, later for carrying out raids on the Continent and elsewhere (1940)\n\nCounteroffensive: A large-scale operation to halt an enemy’s offensive, while occupying defensive positions (1909)\n\nDemilitarized zone: An area in which by agreement between nations, military powers or contending groups forbid military installations, activities to personal (1921)\n\nDog tag: A metal identification tag for military personnel, featuring the soldier’s name, service number, and other information (1918)\n\nFirst world war: Hypothetical use indicating that the 1914-1918 conflict was not the “war to end all wars” (1914)\n\nFlamethrower: Weapon that shoots a stream of burning liquid (1917)\n\nFoo fighter: Term used by Allied aircraft pilots to describe mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over Europe and the Pacific (1944)\n\nFreedom-fighter: Someone who takes part in a resistance movement against the established political system of a country (1942)\n\nFUBAR: U.S. military slang, acronym for “Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition” (1944)\n\nGenocide: The deliberate and systematic extermination of an ethnic or national group.
