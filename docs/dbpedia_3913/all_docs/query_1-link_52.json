        "text": "Dear Reader:\n\nIt has been awhile since I have just shared a history story with you for a blog post…so when Jo sent me the ‘story behind the story‘ of the expression “Kilroy was here” I knew it was a story that needed passing on to all of you.\n\nEven though, as a “Baby Boomer” (born after World War II was over)… thus not growing up with this expression…I told Jo that I remembered being asked about it by an enthusiastic WWII history buff student one year and together we discovered the story behind the expression.\n\nMy feeble brain slightly remembered some (but not all of the story)…so when Jo later sent it…I thought it was time to work it into today’s post… a great patriotic story to tuck away in our treasure chests of stories to tell our children and grandchildren.\n\nSince the story is pretty long I am going to try to condense the main ideas with a few important excerpts….Hope you enjoy a little history trivia on this last weekend in April!\n\nHe is engraved in stone in the National War Memorial in Washington, DC-back in a small alcove where very few people have seen. For the WWII generation, it brings back memories…a bit of trivia that is part of our American history. No one seemed to know why he was so well known-but everybody rallied around him. So who was Kilroy?\n\nIn 1946 a radio program “Speak to America” sponsored a nationwide contest to find the real Kilroy, offering a prize of a real trolley car to the person who could prove himself to be the genuine article. Forty men stepped forward but only one could provide the necessary proof of his identity – James Kilroy from Halifax, Massachusetts.\n\nThe 46-year-old shipyard worker was a checker at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy. His job was to check on the number of rivets completed. (Back then riveters got paid by the rivets. He would count a block of rivets and put a check mark in waxed lumber chalk, so they couldn’t be counted twice. However, once he left, the riveters would erase the mark so they could be paid twice.)\n\n*(Later on, an off-shift inspector would come through and count the rivets a second time, resulting in double pay for the riveters.)\n\nIt didn’t take too long for the boss to catch on that something funny was going on in that section of the assembly line and asked Kilroy to check on it…it was only then that he discovered what had been going on behind his back. He continued to put his check mark on each job he inspected, but added “KILROY WAS HERE” in king-sized letter with a sketch of the chap with the long nose peering over the fence.\n\nOnce he did that the riveters stopped trying to wipe his marks away. With the war on, ships were leaving the Quincy Yard so fast there wasn’t time to paint over his drawings. As a result, Kilroy’s inspection “trademark” was seen by thousands of servicemen who boarded the troopships the yard produced.\n\nHis message definitely hit a chord of patriotism with the servicemen, because they picked it up and spread it all over Europe and the South Pacific.\n\nThere was just something quite comforting about seeing a “Kilroy Was Here” graffiti on a rock or tree a soldier came across in a foreign land fighting a fierce enemy. So as a joke, U.S. Servicemen began placing the graffiti wherever they first landed for the benefit and morale of the others who would follow. (Always claiming of course that it was already there when they arrived.)\n\nKilroy became the U.S. Super-GI who always got there first ahead of the troops to welcome them wherever they fought.\n\nToday it is said Â to be on top of Mt. Everest, the Statue of Liberty, the underside of the Arc de Triomphe, and even scrawled in the dust on the moon.\n\nConference (Roosevelt,\n\nStalin, and Churchill)…an\n\nouthouse was built for the\n\nleaders. Apparently Stalin\n\nhad to go first and emerged\n\nasking, “Who is this Kilroy?”\n\nÂ The legend continues…Â EVEN Outside Osama Bin Laden’s House!\n\nSo until tomorrow…Another “God Wink” was nagging at me the whole time I was re-writing this article….something about a “person” giving hope and comfort to thousands by the reassurance that no matter where you are …this “person” has already gone there and is waiting to welcome you.” Then it hit me what and where I had seen this.\n\nÂ St. Jude’s Chapel of Hope: Trust, North Carolina\n\nÂ Not far from the chapel is a cross leaning down with the words : FEAR NOT TOMORROW. JESUS IS ALREADY THERE.\n\n(Jesus and Kilroy…it’s nice to know Someone was there for our WWII fighting men and boys with one and the same names…a smile and comfort from the One who is always ahead of us there and now…waiting to welcome us. )"
