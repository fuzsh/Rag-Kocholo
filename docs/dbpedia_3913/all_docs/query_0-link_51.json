        "text": "What's on your #bookshelf? This seems to be the summer for naval literature. I started with \"Fighting in the Dark,\" the incredible study of naval night fighting in the first half of the 20th century from Trent Hone and Vincent O'Hara, then graduated to \"America's First Carrier,\" David Winkler's new book on the USS Langley at the dawn of naval aviation. Now I'm closing the book on \"The Mighty Moo,\" Nathan Canestaro incredible new book on the journey of the USS Cowpens during the Second World War. The story of the #MightyMoo really begins at the end of 1942, at which time four of the US Navy's six \"big\" carriers had been sunk. As a stopgap measure, FDR ordered - against fierce objections from the Navy - that light cruisers under construction would be reconfigured as light carriers. They were smaller, to be sure, ungainly to a fault, top heavy with a shorter flight deck, and surprisingly survivable. Commissioned in May 1943, the #MightyMoo was a workhorse that fought in most of the major battles in the #Pacific but without achieving much of any distinction. She did what she was designed to do: fill a #critical #capability gap until replacement carriers could be brought on line. When she cruised into Tokyo Bay in 1945 (the first carrier to do so), it was because she was considered expendable... an acceptable risk at the time should events run a different course. The Mighty Moo was mothballed in 1946 and sold for scrap in 1960. An undignified end for a ship that served as well as she did. But Nathan Canestaro is here to preserve her memory, her #legacy, and her name. Grand Central Publishing\n\nüìö New Release - Out Now üìö 'Salt Horse: Memoir of a Maverick Admiral, Claude Lionel Cumberlege' by Robin Knight Written originally in 1936‚Äì38 by Admiral Cumberlege as a record of his life, Salt Horse was never published. The original manuscript has been expertly edited and made readable in terms of language to a modern audience. It now comprises chapters on Cumberlege‚Äôs naval career in the RN and Royal Australian Navy and also on the 1922‚Äì38 period when he lived year-round on two large sailing craft, cruising the coasts of France and Spain. Cumberlege writes with some verve. He has strong views, made numerous friends wherever he and his second wife Nora went, and lived a spirited, irreverent and fortunate existence in peace and war. Some of his stories (for instance, about WW1 in New Guinea, or about his 1905 lunch in Gibraltar as a young officer with Kaiser Wilhelm II) are historic and eye-catching. In many ways, the book describes a world, and a way of life, that has disappeared for ever. Salt Horse is complemented with a timeline, family tree and Introduction which trace Cumberlege‚Äôs background. An Afterword takes his life story from 1938‚Äì63 when he died. The numerous black-and-white images and short footnotes bring many of the people mentioned in the text to life.

Each medal symbolizes the values of Courage, Integrity, Commitment, Sacrifice, Citizenship, and Patriotism. Today, we highlight the special features that make up the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard Medal. Laurel & Oak Leaves: Clusters of laurel and oak leaves located on each of the star's five points represent victory and strength. 34 Stars: The 34 stars encircling the insignia are equal to the number of stars on the U.S. Flag in 1862. Each star represents a state, from both Union and Confederate states. Minerva: The Roman Goddess of Wisdom and War, Minerva is depicted warding off a man clutching snakes in his hand, meant to represent discord. The shield in Minerva's right hand is representative of the Union of our States, while the bundle of rods and axe blade in her left is symbolic of authority. The owl perched on her helmet is a symbol of wisdom.\n\nSagamore Institute Senior Fellow Dr. Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain, served on active duty for 26 years. Dr. Hendrix‚Äôs research is a core part of Sagamore‚Äôs focus on national security, one of three pillars of the Institute‚Äôs future research and initiatives. We asked Dr. Hendrix, who will release findings from his research on naval presence during an Oct. 11 event at the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site in Indianapolis, about the role of the Midwest and Indiana in national security. Dr. Hendrix: We are called ‚Äúthe heartland‚Äù for more reasons than just the fact that we are the center of agriculture and manufacturing for the nation. At our nation‚Äôs core, its values and interests are very much the values and interests of the Midwest. We are not as sophisticated or nuanced as the coasts. In fact, we deliberately avoid sophistication and nuance in our approach to the world and each other. We have a commonsense pragmatism in our decision making that extends to defense and national security issues, and it‚Äôs important in a time when the world is increasingly dominated by ‚Äúgray zones‚Äù of conflict, that people who still favor the sharp distinctions between right and wrong to have a voice in our national dialogue.\n\n\"The Gadsden flag is a historical American flag with a yellow field depicting a timber rattlesnake coiled and ready to strike. Beneath the rattlesnake are the words \"DONT TREAD ON ME\". (Some modern versions of the flag include an apostrophe.) The flag is named for Christopher Gadsden, a South Carolina delegate to the Continental Congress and brigadier general in the Continental Army who designed the flag in 1775 during the American Revolution. He gave the flag to Commodore Esek Hopkins, and it was unfurled on the main mast of Hopkins' flagship USS Alfred on December 20, 1775. Two days later, Congress made Hopkins commander-in-chief of the Continental Navy. He adopted the Gadsden banner as his personal flag, flying it from the mainmast of the flagship while he was aboard. The Continental Marines also flew the flag during the early part of the war. The rattlesnake was a symbol of the unity of the Thirteen Colonies at the start of the Revolutionary War, and it had a long history as a political symbol in America. Benjamin Franklin used it for his Join, or Die woodcut in 1754. Gadsden intended his flag as a warning to Britain not to violate the liberties of its American subjects. The flag has been described as the \"most popular symbol of the American Revolution.\" Its design proclaims an assertive warning of vigilance and willingness to act in defense against coercion. This has led it to be associated with the ideas of individualism and liberty.\" - Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia #GadsdenFlag #AmericaFirst #USA #GodBlessAmerica #America #victory #Flag #Patriot #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #MAGA #DontTreadOnMe #AmericanRevolution #revolution #rattlesnake #ContinentalCongress #colonies #UnitedStates\n\nThe Future. Late in his life, Admiral Chester Nimitz, Chief the Pacific Fleet in WW2 wrote, \"I was asked once how we were able to fight the war in the Pacific, and I said we fought it just as we had fought all on paper in the Naval War College. I fought the whole war in the Pacific when I was there in1923.\" This is only a slight exaggeration. Navy Plan Orange did indeed set forth the overall strategy that would be followed. With adjustments for technology, tactics and international allegiances, the overall vision held. Many of you may feel overwhelmed by information about how to face the future. You are urged to introduce many new items into your organization's operations, such as AI. It's hard to know how to process the mass of information that floods in. It's hard to know how to make decisions once you have processed it. Let's find a path to do so. We'll start with the next post.\n\n#History is important. \"...between the World Wars, maritime statecraft was central to how the Navy operated and what the nation expected of it. ... Department of the Navy called for full cooperation 'with other departments of the Government,' making maritime statecraft a whole-of-government issue long before the term was coined. ... The Navy also considered the collaboration with industry ... as part of the mission, looking for a brutally honest assessment of the fleet and the support it needed. And the Navy actively tasked itself with ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù civil industries and activities as well as developing plans for industrial mobilization.\" We are faced with a return to #INDOPACOM and we'd do well to draw on lessons from Naval history as we work to engage industry, our other branches of the Armed Forces, other departments within the government, and most especially, our allies. // Artem Sherbinin üá∫üá¶ Peter Guo #dod #military #defense #navy #armedforces #southchinasea #allies #leadership"
