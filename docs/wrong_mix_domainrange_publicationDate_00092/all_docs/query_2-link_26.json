        "text": "I'm ashamed to say I'm reading The Davinci Code. I guess I just had to know what all the fuss is about.\n\nSo far it's a very well paced story, and it reminds me a lot fo the writing style that Matthew Reilly uses. Reilly is an Australian author who writes frantically paced action thrillers.\n\nI would describe both Brown and Reilly's work as being 'unputdownable' (which is a really terrible word gaining common usage, but that's a whole other argument). But in saying that I'm not necessarily saying the books were excellent, just that they are difficult to put down.\n\nAnd the reason for this, I think, isn't the story itself (though Reilly's stories are exciting and would make excellent movies), but the structure. Both Reilly and Brown end all their chapters with cliffhangers (in the case of Ice Station quite literally, with one chapter ending with two characters actually hanging over the edge of a cliff on a Maghook).\n\nThey're like those movie serials you read about (or perhaps saw if you're old enough) where the superhero/spy/adventureer would end the episode with their car flying out over the edge of a cliff (gasp) only to begin again next week, two seconds previously and jumping from the car. Annie Wilkes has something to say about that (you'll understand that reference if you've read Misery, otherwise ignore).\n\nThis is a blatant, but effective, way of manipulating the reader into having a heightened opinion of the book because they find themselves staying up until 12.30 in the morning, as I did last night, waiting for somethign to get resolved so they can go to bed.\n\nAnd that's today's rant.\n\nSpudley said:\n\nThe only Dan Brown book I've read was 'Digital Fortress', but I'm afraid to say I hated it. Yes, it was fast paced, but so full of plot-holes. Bleah.\n\nThat's what I'm saying. \"The Da Vinci Code\" isn't really that good either. There's a secret society doing secret things, but everyone seems to know what they're doing :roll:\n\nBut the style the book is written in gets you to keep reading. Did you read all of 'Digital Fortress'? Yes. Did it deserve to be read? No.\n\nSo is The Da Vinci Code successful because it's controversial, or because of the way it's written? Probably a mix of the two I think.\n\nTalia_Brie said:\n\nSo is The Da Vinci Code successful because it's controversial, or because of the way it's written? Probably a mix of the two I think.\n\nI personally never quite understood the whole intrigue that surrounds Dan Brown's books, considering one is basically a carbon copy of the next. Sure, the characters' names may change, and the places may change but it is still the same formula at its worst.\n\nI dunno, perhaps D. Brown's research is what infuriates me the most. If you're gonna write about \"historical\" facts at least get them right! And, then there's his horrid, horrid prose that could make a 3rd grader feel like an English major. Someone once broke down his prologue used from the Da Vinci Code (again, anyone with the smallest grain of art knowledge would never refer to Leonardo Da Vinci as \"Da Vinci\" since Vinci was the name of a town...) to illustrate perfectly how horrible a writer he is, and I didn't need the person's commentary to show the badness.\n\nBut, as to what would make the novel so popular? Well, a lot of people who use books to kill time while traveling, etc picked it up and either liked it or didn't. The subject matter? Well, secret societies and the questioning of the Christian (moreso the Catholic) faith is not anything new and it is far from inventive. More like, it's a long used plot that has been reheated and reserved. I know I read a while back that he was being suspected of plagarising (Leigh Teabing is a moniker used as a homage to some of the people he \"researched\" from)... But, seriously all it is, is sensationalism and inane bashing on a horse that has for a long time been dead. For once I would personally like to pick up a book that bashed on say, some little-known religion and religious views for a while. Leave the Catholics, the Christians, the Evolutionists, the Communists, and the Pagans out of it for a while and write something new, dagnabit!\n\nBut again that is just my opinion... oh I was so mad when reading A&D and he got the translation of NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM wrong ::runs off and rips hair out::\n\nswing_it_away said:\n\nAs far as Dan being unputdownable, if you really want to hold something against him, he mentions Moses reading something from the ten commandments in Hebrew somewhere. They were actually written in Aramaic.\n\nThat's what I mean. His research is horrible!\n\nI'll take for instance in A&D, he made a big deal about the translation of NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM, only to get the entire passage wrong. I wonder if the editor ever actually *checks* his \"facts\" before shoving it out to print, because Brown certainly doesn't.\n\n\"Just wait until Brown writes a book about your occupation, and then you'll be frustrated.\" Paraphrasing here from a review I remember reading. I guess I can sympathize. I mean, if someone wrote an inaccurate piece of literature on your occupation, and it became a Bestseller, and thousands of people actually believed it... I suppose it would be infuriating.\n\nI don't know about his research, but I know they sounded pretty believable to me when I read Angels and Demons. That was the first Dan Brown book I read, and it was a while ago so I can't remember what I thought, but I also tried reading digital fortress and the bad writing forced me to stop reading. There's so much repetition he might as well write one paragraph and copy/paste.\n\nAnd despite all the talk, I never write the Da Vinci Code...mainly because I can't find a copy of it in the library and I have no urge to buy one of his books. Unless I start going over them with a red marker...but that would be a little pointless. ;-)\n\nI liked the book as a form of entertainment, it is only when i disconnected my anlytical brain did i start to read it properly. That seems to be a problem with you guys, you expect a bestseller to be amazingly written and so when one isn't you immediately jump on it.\n\nWe all know Dan Brown isn't exactly a great writer but he manages to keep people reading which is what matters, sure if it was some award winning novel that every critic on the planet was harking on about and it was a pile of filth then sure knock it down. But treat Dan Brown's books as they are, entertaining action books.\n\nNo-one ever said the best books make the most money, only the most accessible...\n\netched Chaos said:\n\nI liked the book as a form of entertainment, it is only when i disconnected my anlytical brain did i start to read it properly.

The ones that win the awards are not usually the ones that make the most money at the box office."
