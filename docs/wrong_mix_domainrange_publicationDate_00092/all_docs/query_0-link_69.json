        "text": "This lock-down is the perfect opportunity to read books and catch up on our reading material. But what to do when you are done with all of them that are on your shelf?\n\nWe’re all wary of picking a new author, not knowing whether his intricate tale is our type of story or not. And not everybody just loves a famous author. Fame doesn’t mean he’ll be able to woo you as well though.\n\nSo, if you have heard a lot about Dan Brown and are looking to try out his books but not sure what you will find there, don’t you worry! I have come here to provide you with all the key features of Dan Brown books so you’d know if it’s your type of drink or not.\n\nSpoilers ahead!\n\nSYMBOLISM:\n\nThe main feature common in all Dan Brown books is symbolism. Hidden icons, symbols having historic importance, ambigrams, and amulets signifying some specific historic God or event are some of the main elements of each story.\n\nIt would revolve around a recurring symbol either whose meaning is to be discovered by the Oh-So-Knowledgeable Robert Langdon (the protagonist), or the sudden emergence of an emblem linked to an ancient society which was supposed to be dead. Symbolism means a lot of mystery and a lot of history. So if the puzzles intrigue you, you should totally give this a chance.\n\nOne thing I assure you is, you will come out of them knowing the difference between cauduceus and ascelpius and how hundreds of hospitals around the world are using them wrong!\n\nHISTORICALLY IMPORTANT PAINTINGS AND ARTWORKS:\n\nWho doesn’t love museums, right? If you’re me, your perfect day would be a day spent in a museum, enjoying the rich pieces of history and beautiful artwork there.\n\nRobert Langdon series are full of them. You’ll be able to know just how a specific piece of artwork was stolen, by whom it was stolen, and when it was brought to the country to be displayed (Go read inferno to find out more!). However, you can study the important aspect of ancient artwork as well, as Langdon teaches his peers or as he tries to analyze it and guess the hidden meaning in it.\n\nFrom these books I was also able to find the prized possessions of each museum that Langdon ever travelled to, along with the history behind each painting.\n\nWORLD RENOWNED ARCHITECTURE:\n\nAnother thing you will find in all Dan Brown books is architecture. A building is never just a building for Langdon. He looks at everything from a connoisseur’s eye, judging the sculptures adorning it, the painted ceiling covering it, and the glistening marble adding to its elegance. Even the doors matter!\n\nNaturally, as Langdon looks at them, you get to view them in the same manner and it’s a beautiful experience to get sucked into such a marvelous piece of architecture.\n\nNow since these books follow a specific ancient theme, you won’t, of course, get to go to football stadiums or concert hall (though you just might once or twice).\n\nHowever, the most common types of architecture you’ll find in these books are:\n\nChurches\n\nMuseums\n\nMosques turned into museums or churches\n\nAncient structures turned into universities, shops or stores\n\nPiazzas and Bazaars\n\nFamous tourist spots\n\nIn short, everything that has any historic importance or an intriguing quality to it, you’ll find there.\n\nATTRACTIVE SETTING:\n\nOne thing you must give Brown credit for is the setting of his novels. Brown takes his characters on global adventures, from one attractive country to another, and from one appealing destination to another with in the country.\n\nHis descriptions of each place are so on-point; you’ll find yourself transported through space and time to the location Brown is describing.\n\nAnd with whole world in lockdown where can you go except from the couch to fridge and back to the couch right? But with the Robert Langdon series you can travel to many locations around the globe without having been required to move one foot.\n\nEach location used in the books is a real-life place instead of being fictitious. So, you can run through a piazza in Italy with Langdon and it’ll be exactly the same as Brown described or pass through a park full of sculptures and go there to find the exact same sculptures in the exact same spots as described by the author.\n\nCONTROVERSIAL TOPICS:\n\nEvery Dan Brown book revolves around one main theme or problem that has to be solved. And guess what? All controversial . Religion, cults, demonology, scientific controversies and what-not. The books are full of them. One of them “The Da Vinci Code” was even banned for some time by catholic leaders due to blasphemous content.\n\nAll the organizations, cults, and societies incorporated into his stories are based on real-life organizations, for example you can find “The Da Vinci Code” revolving around Opus Dei and Angels and Demons around Illuminati.\n\nHowever, some of the less talked about topics are kind of engaging and if you’re into that kind of stuff you’ll have a great time reading these.\n\nHISTORICAL ACCURACY:\n\nAlthough historic experts say that Brown’s books are not completely historically accurate, a normal reader, however, can find many interesting facts in them, that when searched turn out to be true. For example, 99% of “The Da Vinci” code is based on truth and all the art, the rituals and, the societies are true.\n\nSo, if your major isn’t or wasn’t history, you’ll surely be very impressed by Dan Brown’s knowledge of history and his absolutely engaging take on it.\n\nORDER OF THE BOOKS:\n\nLastly, here is a list of Dan Brown books in order just in case you have decided to give them a chance:\n\nThe Robert Langdon Series:\n\nAngels and Demons (2000)\n\nThe Da Vinci Code (2003)\n\nThe Lost Symbol (2009)\n\nInferno (2013)\n\nOrigin (2017)\n\nStand Alones:\n\nDigital Fortress (1998)\n\nDeception Point (2001)"
