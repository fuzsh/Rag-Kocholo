        "text": "Dan Brown is an American novelist who writes thriller and mystery fiction. The common themes in his books consist of cryptography, secret codes and conspiracy theories. His books have created some controversy with people who consider his novels to be anti-Christian, but he insists that they are simply stories to promote spiritual debate.\n\nBrown’s novels The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons have both been adapted to major motion pictures starring Tom Hanks and the next to get that treatment is The Lost Symbol. Below is the order in which Dan Brown’s books were originally released in:\n\nGet notified when Dan Brown releases a new book at BookNotification.com.\n\nPublication Order of Robert Langdon Books\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nPublication Order of Picture Books\n\nWild Symphony (2020)Amazon.com | Amazon.de\n\nPublication Order of Non-Fiction Books\n\n187 Men to Avoid (1995)Amazon.com | Amazon.de\n\nNote: The non-fiction book 187 Men to Avoid was written as Danielle Brown.\n\nIf You Like Dan Brown Books, You’ll Love…\n\nJohn Grisham\n\nStieg Larsson\n\nDavid Baldacci\n\nWe do our best to get everything listed but the occasional book gets by us.
