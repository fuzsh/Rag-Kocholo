        "text": "Origin — Dan Brown\n\nWhere do we come from? Where are we going?\n\nWas life created by GOD? Do we have an “origin”? Is it Science that draws the people closer or is it Religion that keeps them sane.. Does nature really create chaos or is it Order.. Where is mankind & technology headed to..\n\nOrigin is a mystery thriller novel by author Dan Brown, who never fails to keep his readers hooked & puzzled until the end. Just like the previous 4 Robert Langdon series, this book has art, symbols, literature works, cultural facts, deaths, a lot of secrets & some astonishing technologies.\n\nEdmond Kirsch, a billionaire philanthropist, computer scientist & atheist, is shot dead during a presentation on his discovery about the “origin of life”, before actually revealing it. Robert & Ambra Vidal, the future queen of Spain, feeling a moral obligation towards their friend & his discovery, embark on a mission to find the password & release the presentation online. His death brings in a lot of speculations & conspiracies about his killer, the Pope, the Royal Palace & ultimately religious communities. As Robert & Ambra Vidal search the password all around Spain we get to see some remarkable places, artworks, and literature. Along with a friend, “Winston” they find what they seek and release the presentation online, the discovery itself is breathtaking & has a prophecy at the end. Robert is heartbroken to find out the real killer, who is also responsible for the different conspiracies.\n\nWhat is the discovery & the prophecy? How will it affect mankind & the whole religious community? What are the secrets that the King of Spain hides? Who is responsible for the conspiracies? Who is the killer? These questions will haunt you & keep you up all night wondering about the simple yet wonderful laws of nature.\n\nI would say, “The end is just as shocking as the beginning”. Dan Brown’s books make you aware of unimaginable facts and understand more about them. Simply changing our perspectives towards things can change a lot. In this rapidly developing tech-savvy world we need to understand that change is inevitable, all we need to do is accept it & use it in the right way or else we will perish."
