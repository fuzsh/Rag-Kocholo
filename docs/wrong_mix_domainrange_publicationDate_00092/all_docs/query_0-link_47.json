        "text": "At the height of my Da Vinci Code fever, I wanted to become a Langdon-esque symbolist running around the museums of France. For the first time, my interest in the Holy Grail went beyond Monty Python, and the Paris Meridian (aka the \"Rose Line\") became a “must-see” for any future French vacations. With crazy twists and subversive theories, it was a book that left quite an impression on this 11-year-old Catholic girl.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code was more than a bestseller. It was a thriller sensation that took the book world by storm. The fast-paced plot filled with intriguing puzzles, historical legend, and religious lore was made approachable through humble professor Robert Langdon. It was easy to follow the clues, solving the mysteries alongside Langdon, all leading to a satisfying end.\n\nOver ten years, 200 million copies, and a film adaptation later, Dan Brown’s novel remains one of the most popular books of the 21st century. From secret societies and religious zealots to art history and familiar landmarks, it’s the perfect balance between an accessible, smart thriller and an outrageous, conspiracy-laden romp. Throw in a side of controversy—a non-celibate Jesus and Mary Magdalene, for example—and it’s no wonder everyone and their mother has read it.\n\nAnd Dan Brown didn’t stop there. With five books in the Robert Langdon series, Brown has unlocked a formula readers love."
