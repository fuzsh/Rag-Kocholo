        "text": "There's something very strange about this first Sunday morning in November... It's not the frost on the trees and grass and the 33 degree morning. It's not my morning mug of coffee. It's a new book in my home entitled The Kindness Games, with my name as an author... This is a first and it feels pretty weird. The upside is it has me reflecting on the blessings of the last several years. Ironically, I had some of my toughest times in my easiest phase of life. It wasn't 4 years in a war zone which weakened me. It wasn't my role in the parade of international incidents and news stories which you've discussed with family, friends, and colleagues that wore me down... it was something seemingly easier to bear which caused the darkness to begin closing in. Yet out of my hardship, a global movement was formed. Because a friend who had never met me in person answered my call and took my hand, a leadership philosophy was born... This morning, I'm thinking about all the friends I never would have met without this struggle. I wouldn't have known them if I hadn't reached out for help. Thank you to all the #TKGalumni, participants, and allies of #TheKindnessGames for the life altering role you've all played in my life. Thank you for choosing to Heal Your Communities, Change Your World, by Leading with Kindness. #OwningLifeStories #KindnessisFree #KindnessCounts #TheKindnessGames #TheRealKindnessGames #TheKindnessGamesOT #GSD #leadershipandmanagement #youngprofessionals #gsdcrew #accelerise2020 #itsnotweaktospeak #accelerisewehearyou #lead #kindness #inspiration #InspirationalLeadership #InspirationalLeaders"
