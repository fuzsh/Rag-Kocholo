        "text": "STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT RULE VIOLATION LEVELS\n\nThe Student Code of Conduct rules are divided into levels according to the severity of the violation and the type of consequence. The principal shall inform students of local school rules that, if broken, may result in suspension from school.\n\nLEVEL 1\n\nRule violations result in in-school interventions. In cases where a student refuses to participate in the in-school interventions or engages in persistent violations of a Level 1 rule, or other aggravating factors are present, the principal may impose a short-term suspension or recommend participation in an intervention program related to the violation. Consequences for truancy or tardiness shall not include out-of-school suspension but may include recommendations for intervention programs and/or transfer to alternative learning programs.\n\nLEVEL 2\n\nRule violations involve more serious misconduct. Level 2 consequences generally range from restorative interventions to short-term suspension. Principals may recommend transferring to an alternative learning program and/or participating in an intervention program based on the presence of aggravating factors. There is no appeal for short-term suspensions.\n\nLEVEL 3\n\nRule violations are more severe and may support a principal recommendation for participation in an intervention program, transfer to an alternative learning program and/or long-term suspension depending on the circumstances. The principal may, however, impose Level 2 consequences based on mitigating factors.\n\nLEVEL 4\n\nRule violations compromise the safety and welfare of students and staff and require a suspension of a specific length under North Carolina General Statutes.\n\nLEVEL 5\n\nAllows for expulsion of a student, as provided by state statute, for a violation of the Student Code of Conduct, if the student is fourteen (14) years of age or older and the student’s behavior indicates that his/her continued presence in school constitutes a clear threat to the safety of other students or employees and the Board determines that there is no appropriate alternative education program. Additionally, any student who is a registered sex offender under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-208.7 may be expelled consistent with state law.\n\nCONSEQUENCES AND VIOLATION LEVELS\n\nThe following information includes CCS Board of Education Behavior Policies (Board Policy Manual) associated with the corresponding Student Code of Conduct rule violation(s). The behavior violations listed below do not constitute a definitive list, however, most behaviors fall within the policies listed below. (Rule violations may be associated with multiple Board Policies and Board Policies may be included under multiple levels).\n\nRule violations are coded per NCDPI Discipline Data Reporting requirements. Behaviors that can be assigned to students have prefixes to indicate severity:\n\n● UB or *– Unacceptable behavior\n\n● RO – “Reportable” Crimes. These crimes along with the PD crimes are used in calculations of the school and school district’s crime rates\n\nthat are displayed on the School Report Card\n\n● PD – Dangerous crimes\n\nAdministrators have the responsibility of considering each incident separately and have the right to assign different consequences consistent with Board Policy\n\n1. School Emergency Behavior For the sake of everyone’s safety, school emergencies require complete compliance with disciplinary guidelines. Inappropriate behaviors (including insubordination or the unauthorized use of a cell phone) during a school emergency will result in serious consequences up to and including long-term suspension or expulsion.\n\n2. Unauthorized Computer Use (see Policy 3225/4312/7320 Technology Responsible Use, Policy 3226/4205 Internet Safety and Policy 4310 Integrity and Civility). No student shall access, or attempt to access, a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access, and by means of such conduct: (1) communicate, deliver, transmit or view System programs and files, (2) obtain, transmit, alter or destroy information contained in System or students’ files and programs, and (3) introduce any program or file into a System computer except as authorized by an instructor. No student shall use a System computer to send or receive profane, obscene, pornographic, or abusive material, or any files, programs, emails, or websites that are non-educational. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, threats, extortion, and slander. No student shall use a System computer to violate copyright laws and license agreements.\n\n3. Criminal Actions (see Board Policy 4335 Criminal Behavior) No student shall engage in any criminal act as defined by state statutes. The principal will report all such acts to law enforcement. These acts include, without limitation:\n\na. any physical or sexual assault\n\nb. sexual offense or rape\n\nc. kidnapping\n\nd. indecent liberties with a minor\n\ne. possession of a weapon or firearm\n\nf. possession of controlled substance\n\ng. homicide\n\nh. robbery/armed robbery\n\ni. bomb threat\n\nj. burning of a school building k. possession of alcohol\n\nThe superintendent or designee may report to a law enforcement official any circumstance or event that gives him or her reason to suspect that a student has violated a criminal statute. Further, the Board will cooperate in any investigations or prosecutions of a student conducted by law enforcement officials pursuant to a criminal statute.\n\n4. Extracurricular Activity Requirements (see Policy 3620 Extracurricular Activities and Student Organizations and Policy 4153 Admission Requirements for Participation in Extracurricular Activities) Participation in extracurricular activities, including student organizations and interscholastic athletics, is a privilege, not a right, and may be reserved for students in good academic standing who meet behavior standards established by the board and the school. Accordingly, students may be held to higher standards of eligibility for participation in extracurricular activities than for participating in the regular instructional program. Participation in extracurricular activities may be restricted if a student (1) is charged with criminal conduct; (2) is not performing at grade level; (3) has exceeded the number of absences allowed; (4) has violated the student conduct standards; or (5) has violated school rules for conduct. Participation shall also be restricted to students who use drugs and alcohol.\n\n5. Gang-Related Activities (see Policy 4328 Gang Prohibition) A gang is any group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, having as one of its primary activities the commission of criminal acts, or the purposeful violation of any board policy, that uses a common name, a common identifying sign, colors or symbols, or a claim of a geographic territory. The presence of gangs and gang activities can cause a substantial disruption of, or material interference with, school and school activities. No student shall commit any act that furthers gangs or gang-related activities.\n\nDisciplinary Reassignment A student who is transferred to an alternative learning program or school for a violation of the Student Code of Conduct has an appeal process available pursuant to Policy 3470/4305 Alternative Learning Programs/Schools.\n\nShort-term Suspensions (1-10 days) A student who has been given a short-term suspension for violation of the Student Code of Conduct shall be given an opportunity to complete assignments, take textbooks home, and take major tests or exams missed during the period of suspension. Short-term suspensions are non-appealable.\n\nLong-term Suspensions (more than 10 days) or 365-day Suspensions A student accused of a violation of the Code of Student Conduct that might warrant a long-term suspension or 365-day suspension from school, shall be afforded the procedural safeguards described below. The student’s principal or his designee must make a recommendation for a long-term suspension, which shall include the notice of procedural rights discussed below. If a parent/guardian requests a hearing on the recommendation, the district will provide a hearing in accordance with the notice of procedural rights. If no hearing is timely requested, a long-term suspension or 365-day suspension may be imposed without a hearing. Only the superintendent or his/her designee may impose a long-term suspension or 365-day suspension.\n\nStudents who receive services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or Section 504 are entitled to additional protections consistent with those laws.\n\nLong-term suspensions (more than 10 days), 365-day suspensions, and Expulsions can be appealed per Policy 4353 Long-term Suspension, 365 Days Suspension, Expulsion, Policy 4370 Student Discipline Hearing Procedures and Policy 4354 Expulsion Hearings.\n\nNotice of Disciplinary Reassignment or Long-Term Suspension When a principal recommends that a disciplinary reassignment or long-term suspension be imposed, parents must be provided written notice of the recommendation by the end of the workday (when reasonably possible; otherwise as soon as is practicable).\n\nIf a parent or guardian requests a hearing to contest a disciplinary reassignment or long-term suspension, a hearing before a CCS Hearing Officer will be held following these procedures:\n\na. The hearing will be informal and conducted in private.\n\nb. The student and parent or guardian have a right to be present at the hearing, and to be represented by an attorney or non-attorney\n\nadvocate at the parent or guardian's expense.\n\nc. Prior to the hearing, the student and the parent or guardian and representative have the right to review any audio or video recordings of\n\nthe incident (although this right might impacted by the state and federal criminal laws that might apply); and consistent with federal and\n\nState student records laws and regulations, the information that may be presented as evidence against the student, including\n\nstatements made by witnesses whose names or other identifying information are withheld if identification of a witness could create a\n\nsafety risk for the witness.\n\nd. The hearing must be attended by the superintendent or designee, the principal and/or assistant administrators, and any persons the\n\nsuperintendent or designee deems necessary.\n\ne. The school representatives have the burden of proving the misbehavior; the violation of board policy, The Code of Student Conduct,\n\nschool standards, or school rules; and the appropriateness of the recommended consequence for the violation.\n\nf. The school representatives will present the witnesses and documentary evidence against the student first. After the school\n\nrepresentatives have presented their evidence, the student or his or her representative may present evidence relating to the alleged\n\ndisciplinary infraction, the student's intent at the time of the incident, any mitigating or aggravating factors involved, the disciplinary and\n\nacademic history of the student and the potential benefits to the student of alternatives to the proposed discipline. Such evidence may i\n\ninclude oral testimony by the student or witnesses, written statements, and other documents.\n\ng. Both the school representatives and the student or his or her parent, guardian, or representative may examine the witnesses presented\n\nby the other side. The superintendent or designee has the authority to limit questioning by any person if the questioning is\n\nunproductive, unnecessarily lengthy, repetitive, or irrelevant.\n\nh. The superintendent or designee will provide for making a record of the hearing, including any findings or conclusions made by the\n\nsuperintendent. The student will have the right to make his or her own audio recording of the hearing.\n\ni. In reaching a determination in the matter, the superintendent or designee shall consider documents produced in the hearing, the\n\ntestimony of any witnesses, and other evidence presented at the hearing. If the superintendent or designee determines that a violation\n\noccurred, the superintendent or designee also shall determine the appropriateness of the recommended consequences for the\n\nviolation. Formal rules of evidence do not apply, and the superintendent or designee may rely on evidence that a reasonably prudent\n\nperson would consider in the conduct of serious affairs.\n\nj. Following the hearing, the superintendent or designee shall render a written decision based on substantial evidence presented at the\n\nhearing and shall notify the student and parent or guardian of that decision in accordance with the requirements of Policy 4353, Long-\n\nTerm Suspension, 365-Day Suspension, Expulsion.\n\nExpungement of Records You have the right to review and obtain copies of your child’s educational records. Cabarrus County Schools follows the procedures outlined in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-402 regarding the expungement of discipline records.\n\nDisciplinary Reassignment – If the recommendation for a long-term suspension of any kind or length is upheld, the student will typically be assigned to an alternative learning program or school for the duration of the suspension.\n\nThe disciplinary reassignment will be immediately effective, pending the appeal, and remain in effect until a decision is rendered in the appeal. If neither the student nor the parent appears at the scheduled hearing, they will have waived the right to the hearing.\n\nBoard Hearings for Long-Term, 365 Day, or Expulsion Decisions The parent or guardian may appeal the superintendent/designee's decision(s) on suspension or expulsion to the Board. Board of Education appeals must be submitted in writing within three (3) school days of receiving the superintendent’s decision. The full Board, or a panel of not less than three members appointed by the Chair, will hear the appeal in closed session and will follow its procedures as provided in Policy 4370 Student Discipline Hearing Procedures. The appealed consequence will remain in effect throughout the appeals process. Students under a long-term suspension from another district, who are seeking admission to CCS, may not appeal their long-term suspension through the CCS process. Decisions made by Board panels are not appealable to the full Board.\n\nProcedures for Suspension of Students with Disabilities Please see the Policies Governing Services for Children with Disabilities, as amended (Public Schools of N.C.) for additional procedural safeguards to be followed for students with disabilities. Parents or students who need a copy of this handbook may contact the principal or obtain a copy through the district office.\n\nPoint of Exit is Point of Entry Withdrawing from and later re-enrolling in Cabarrus County Schools will not circumvent a reassignment to an alternative program or school for disciplinary purposes. Students who are reassigned to an alternative program school or for a specified amount of time must regularly attend and complete this reassignment before returning to the regular school environment. Students who leave CCS while assigned to an alternative program or school and return at a later date will automatically be assigned to the alternative program or school upon re-enrolling in CCS.\n\nDisciplinary Reassignment Programs\n\nShort-Term PASS Suspension Center: Students who have received a referral for a non-aggressive level II or III offense warranting an out-of-school suspension for a period of five to ten days will be given the option to attend a short-term suspension center to complete their school assignments and receive credit for attending school. This option is also designed to provide a structured, restorative, and individualized learning environment. Decision-making strategies and drug abuse awareness will also be embedded during this time. This is a voluntary placement; therefore, transportation will not be provided. At the discretion of the deputy superintendent, or designee, certain offenses may exclude a student from being able to attend the short-term suspension center.\n\nOpportunity School (High/Middle School):\n\nOpportunity School is available as an alternative education option for students who have committed serious violations of the Code of Student Conduct. Forty-five days is the minimum assignment to this location. The Opportunity School meets the requirements of the standard course of study and provides students with the opportunity to make timely progress toward grade promotion and graduation. However, course offerings and programs at the Opportunity School are not as comprehensive as those offered at a student’s home school. Staff will work with students, their families, and the student’s home school to develop a personal behavior plan and curriculum to be implemented during the assigned period to the Opportunity School. Students are assigned to Opportunity School for a determined period or until they meet stated goals and are eligible to return to their home school. Transportation, breakfast, and lunch will be provided.\n\nCCS has implemented an anonymous tip line. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat §115C-105.51 Anonymous tip lines and monitoring and response applications, the governing body of each public secondary school shall develop and operate an anonymous tip line, in coordination with local law enforcement and social services agencies, to receive anonymous information on internal or external risks to the school population, school buildings, and school-related activities.\n\nANONYMOUS REPORTING SYSTEM\n\nIf you or someone you know is being bullied or harassed, please speak with an adult, school counselor, school social worker, school psychologist, or administrator at your school. Bullying can be reported through the Say Something Anonymous Reporting System available on the CCS websites. More information is available under the Safety section. Students and staff will receive training each school year.\n\nCabarrus County Schools is committed to providing every student with a safe welcoming school environment. (See Policy 1710/4021/7230 Prohibition Against Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying; Policy 1720/4015/7225 Discrimination, Harassment, and Bullying Complaint Procedure; Policy 1725/4035/7236 Title IX Sexual Harassment – Prohibited Conduct and Reporting Process; Policy 1726/4036/7237 Title IX Sexual Harassment Grievance Process and NC § 115C-407.15).\n\nStudents may report bullying and harassment through the Say Something Anonymous Reporting System , the online Bullying Harassment Report, or by contacting their school.\n\nHarassment or Bullying behavior includes:\n\nA pattern (repeated) of ONE or more of the following:\n\n● Gestures\n\n● Communications (includes online/social media, etc.)\n\n● Physical Acts\n\n● Threatening Communications\n\nAND ONE or more of the following:\n\n● Damage to property\n\n● Places student in actual and reasonable fear of harm to his/her person\n\n● Creates or is certain to create a hostile environment by substantially interfering with or impairing a student's educational performance,\n\nopportunities, or benefits. (Hostile environment meets BOTH criteria below)\n\no Student subjectively views the conduct as bullying or harassing behavior\n\no Behavior is objectively severe or pervasive enough that a reasonable person would agree it is bullying and harassing behavior\n\no a reasonable person would agree it is bullying and harassing behavior\n\nMOTIVATED by characteristics such as: *Race *National Origin *Religion *Sexual Orientation *Socioeconomic Status *Physical Appearance *Ancestry *Color *Gender *Gender Identity *Academic Status *Mental/Physical/ Sensory Disability\n\nThe following are policies and rules related to bullying and harassing behavior. These behaviors include verbal, physical, and online behavior.\n\nDISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND BULLYING\n\n(See Policies 1710/4021/7230 Prohibition Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Bullying; 4313 Student Use of Social Networking Sites, Blogging and the Internet; 3225/4312/7320 Technology Responsible Use, 1720/4015/7225 Discrimination, Harassment, and Bullying Complaint Procedure,\n\na. Threats or Harassment- Students shall use words, signs, or actions that constitute a threat of force, violence, or disruption, including\n\nbut not limited to bullying, blackmail, and extortion. No student shall harass anyone. Harassment, including hazing, is considered\n\nunwanted, unwelcome, and uninvited behavior that demeans, threatens, or offends the victim.\n\nb. Bullying- Bullying is strictly prohibited. Bullying is a repeated pattern of intimidation that may be either real or threatening. Bullying may\n\ninclude, but is not limited to verbal taunts, name-calling, implied or stated threats, and exclusion from peer groups. Online Bullying can\n\noccur in person, or through social networking sites, texting, blogging, and the internet.\n\nc. Cyberbullying- Cyberbullying is the use of communication such as email, text, or social media to intentionally harm others.\n\nCyberbullying can occur in person, or through social networking sites, texting, blogging, and the internet.\n\nd. Discrimination- It is the policy of the Cabarrus County Board of Education that no otherwise qualified student shall be excluded from,\n\nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in any educational program or activity solely based on age, sex, race,\n\nreligion, color, national origin, disability, creed, or political affiliation.\n\nSee policies 1725/4035/7236 Title IX Sexual Harassment – Prohibited Conduct and Reporting Process and 1726/4036/7237 Title IX Sexual Harassment Grievance Process.\n\nThe board acknowledges the dignity and worth of all students and employees and strives to create a safe, orderly, caring, and inviting school environment to facilitate student learning and achievement. The board will not tolerate discrimination based on sex, including any form of sexual harassment as that term is defined under Title IX, in any education program or activity of the school system. The board takes seriously all reports and formal complaints of sexual harassment. The school system does not discriminate based on sex in its education programs or activities, including admission and employment, in accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 and federal regulations.\n\nStudents, school system employees, volunteers, and visitors are expected to behave civilly and respectfully. The board expressly prohibits sexual harassment by students, employees, board members, volunteers, or visitors. “Visitors” include parents and other family members and individuals from the community, as well as vendors, contractors, and other persons doing business with or performing services for the school system.\n\nDefinition of Sexual Harassment- Sexual harassment prohibited under Title IX and by this policy is conducted based on sex occurring in a school system education program or activity that satisfies one or more of the following:\n\na. an employee of the school system conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the school system on an individual’s\n\nparticipation in unwelcome sexual conduct;\n\nb. unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a\n\nperson equal access to the school system’s education program or activities. This determination requires consideration of all the facts\n\nand circumstances, including, but not limited to, the ages and disability statuses of the harasser and the victim and the number of\n\nindividuals involved and their authority;\n\nc. sexual assault including rape, statutory rape, fondling, and incest;\n\nd. dating violence;\n\ne. stalking\n\nExamples of conduct on the basis of sex that would be considered sexual harassment if the conduct satisfies the criteria above include, but are not limited to: unwelcome sexual advances; requests for sexual favors; and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, such as deliberate, unwelcome touching that has sexual connotations or is of a sexual nature; suggestions or demands for sexual involvement accompanied by implied or overt promises of preferential treatment or threats; pressure for sexual activity; continued or repeated offensive sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; continued or repeated verbal remarks about an individual’s body; sexually degrading words used toward an individual or to describe an individual; sexual assault; sexual violence; the display of sexually suggestive drawings, objects, pictures, or written materials; posting sexually suggestive pictures of a person without the person’s consent; and forwarding pornographic material depicting a classmate or other member of the school community. Acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping but not involving the conduct of a sexual nature may also constitute sexual harassment.\n\nReporting Sexual Harassment- Policy 1726/4036/7237 Title IX Sexual Harassment Grievance Process. Any student who believes he or she is a victim of sexual harassment occurring in the school system’s education programs or activities is encouraged to report the matter to the student’s principal or to the Title IX Coordinator, at (704) 260-5600. Reports may also be made to a teacher, counselor, assistant principal, teacher assistant, or any other school employee. Middle and high school students may also report sexual harassment through the anonymous tip line, but school officials may be limited in their ability to respond if the report does not identify the complainant.\n\nFor more information, visit the Technology Department webpage and see Policy 3225/4312/7320 Technology Responsible Use; Policy 4313 Student Use of Social Networking Sites, Blogging and the Internet; and Policy 3226/4205 Internet Safety\n\nACCESS TO THE INTERNET: INTRODUCTION\n\nAs part of the CCS Instructional Technology program, based on statewide instructional standards, the school system offers our students and staff access to the Internet. Internet access provides opportunities to reach out to experts, share information, explore concepts, and research topics.\n\nACCESS TO THE INTERNET: PURPOSE\n\nThe purpose of allowing access to the Internet is so students and staff can explore online libraries, databases, curriculum materials, and other informational sites. Each year students receive appropriate training on the use of the Internet as part of the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA). Cabarrus County Schools follows guidelines outlined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) and has earned the CoSN Trusted Learning Environment Seal for taking strong, measurable steps to help protect the privacy of student data.\n\nInternet use for students is filtered and inappropriate sites are blocked, but parents/guardians should be aware that some students find ways to access inappropriate material. Because the school system cannot control 100% of all the material available on the internet, it is extremely important that your child understands and follows all Cabarrus County Schools’ policies and guidelines. Any user violating policies and guidelines may relinquish his or her rights to the technology resources for the remainder of the school year. In addition, other disciplinary actions may be taken.\n\nEach student user is responsible for the appropriate use of the Internet. If inappropriate materials are encountered, each student is to report the issue immediately to a teacher. Parents and students understand all student email communications and use of the internet on school-provided email and online collaboration platforms may be monitored.\n\nSTUDENT WEBPAGE: PERMISSION\n\nAnything published locally on the school’s website can be viewed on the Internet and Cable Channel 21. This includes intellectual property such as artwork, poetry, essays, and performances that will be identified with your student’s first and last name and/or photo.\n\nNOTICE: If you do not want your child’s intellectual property or photo to be published and identified, PLEASE NOTIFY YOUR PRINCIPAL IN WRITING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.\n\nStudents are prohibited from using their personal devices as private Wi-Fi hotspots during instructional hours. Policy 3225/4312/7320 Technology Responsible Use.\n\nStudents and staff will be given “Guest” access to the Internet in select locations. The Internet is filtered to “Guest” users while they access the Internet at a CCS site. A signed consent form must be obtained prior to a student’s access to the CCS ‘guest’ network. CCS is not responsible for any device(s) that are broken, stolen, or lost on CCS property.\n\nEXCUSED ABSENCES The principal, superintendent, or student’s teacher has the right to excuse a student temporarily from attendance because of sickness or other unavoidable causes as defined by the State Board of Education. Below are valid/lawful reasons for temporary non-attendance from school.\n\n1. Student’s Illness or Injury: When the absence results from illness or injury that prevents the student from being physically able to attend\n\nschool;\n\n2. Quarantine: When isolation of the student is ordered by the local health officer or by the State Board of Health;\n\n3. Death in the Immediate Family: When the absence results from the death of a member of the immediate family of the student. For this\n\nregulation, the immediate family of a student includes but is not necessarily limited to, grandparents, parents, brothers, and sisters. The\n\nprincipal will consider each event individually to determine a sufficient number of excused absences and may request additional\n\ndocumentation at his/her discretion;\n\n4. Medical or Dental Appointments: When the absence results from a medical or dental appointment of a student;\n\n5. Court or Administrative Proceedings: When the absence results from the attendance of a student at the proceedings of a court or an\n\nadministrative tribunal if the student is a party to the action or under subpoena as a witness. The Local Board of Education can be\n\nconsidered an administrative tribunal;\n\n6. Religious Observance: School principals are required to authorize up to two excused absences each academic year for religious\n\nobservances required by faith of a student or a student’s parents or legal guardian;\n\n7. Educational Opportunity: When it is demonstrated that the purpose of the absence is to take advantage of a valid education\n\nopportunity, including but not limited to, college visitation, or service as a legislative or governor’s page with prior approval (based on\n\nthe student’s current and previous attendance history) from the principal or designee and with the demonstration of learning by the\n\nstudent;\n\n8. Local School Board Policy: LEAs may excuse temporary or occasional absences for other reasons per local school board policies,\n\nprovided that the student has been in attendance for at least one-half of a school day during the current school year;\n\n9. Absence related to Deployment Activities: School principals are required to authorize up to two days each academic year for visitation\n\nwith the student’s parent or legal guardian who is an active duty member of the uniformed services as defined by Policy 4050, Children of Military Families and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or immediately returned from deployment to a combat zone or\n\ncombat support posting for the purpose of visiting said parent or legal guardian. (G.S. 115C-407.5 Article V I),\n\n10. Child Care: Absences due to the illness or medical appointment during school hours of a child of whom the student is the custodial\n\nparent are to be coded excused (lawful) (NC G.S.115C-375.5); and\n\n11. Exam exemption(s): approved in accordance with the provisions of Policy 3405 Students At-Risk of Academic Failure.\n\nUNEXCUSED ABSENCES\n\n1. A student’s willful absence from school with or without the knowledge of a parent.\n\n2. A student’s absence from school for any reason other than those listed in ‘EXCUSED ABSENCE.’\n\n3. A student is not permitted to attend school because he/she lacks proper immunizations.\n\n4. A student is not permitted to attend school because he/she lacks a proper health assessment.\n\nSee Policy 4400 Attendance for more information.\n\n1. When a student must miss school, a written excuse from a parent or guardian must be presented to the teacher within two school days of the student’s return after an absence. Written excuses submitted beyond two school days will be subject to principal approval. A written excuse may be submitted by hard copy, electronically through email, or other school approved forms of communication (i.e., absence forms on school websites, classroom communication apps, etc.). The reason for an absence determines if the absence is excused or unexcused.\n\n2. Absences due to extended illnesses or after accumulating more than ten (10) absences may require a statement from a physician. This requirement may be waived by the school principal for extenuating circumstances, but a waiver is not available for more than twenty (20) absences. Notes/statements from a physician [or health care provider] may require clarification or verification by school staff in order to be accepted.\n\n3. Absences due to extended illnesses generally require a statement from a physician, which may be requested by the principal/designee.

The principal will consider whether to retain the student or deny course credit and shall notify the parent/guardian in writing of the decision. Parents of students with chronic attendance violations will be referred to truancy court when a lack of cooperation and/or a significant increase in student absences is observed.\n\n7. For students experiencing homelessness, school officials must consider issues related to the student’s homelessness, such as change of caregivers or nighttime residence, before taking disciplinary action or imposing other barriers to school attendance based on excessive absences or tardies. See Policy 4125, Homeless Students.\n\n8. To receive credit for courses, students must not have excessive absences or tardies. For the purposes of this paragraph and the state compulsory attendance law, absences include accumulated unexcused tardies as specified below.\n\nK-8 SPECIFIC\n\n1.

School staff work closely with local emergency responders (Police, Fire, Medic, etc.) to promote safe school climates.\n\nSafety is always a priority, and our district has a number of safety measures in place to ensure the safety of our campuses. Say Something Anonymous Reporting System (SSARS) is a system that provides an app, website and 24/7 crisis telephone hotline for youth and adults to submit anonymous tips. This system is provided to our district through the Sandy Hook Promise organization.\n\nWe utilize layers of safety measures in our schools.

Depending on the situation, several forms of communication may be used including the Parent Square Notification System (phone/email), written notifications and Cabarrus County Schools various social media platforms.\n\nUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA TO COMMUNICATE WITH PARENTS, STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY\n\nSchool use of social media to communicate information has become increasingly common. Social media is an effective and quick option for communicating with the community.\n\nSocial media tips for parents and educators during a crisis:\n\n● Recognize the challenges schools face during crisis events.\n\n● While trying to provide information and resources as quickly as possible, school administrators and crisis teams must balance the\n\nneed for immediacy with handling the crisis, keeping staff and students safe, and sharing accurate and timely information.\n\n● Follow the Cabarrus County Schools’ (as well as your specific school’s) social media sites on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\n\n● If you are not a social media user, seek out information and resources through other methods (e.g., the school’s webpage,\n\nParentSquare, etc.)\n\n● Most critical is to use social media to convey the facts, dispel the rumors, and provide resources that facilitate healthy, adaptive\n\ncoping.\n\nANNUAL NOTICE OF RIGHTS UNDER FERPA\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords parents and students over 18 years of age (\"eligible students\") certain rights with respect to the student's education records.

The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the parent or eligible student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA. Parents or eligible students who wish to ask Cabarrus County Schools to amend a record should write to the principal, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed and specify why it should be changed.\n\n3. If Cabarrus County Schools decides not to amend the record as requested by the parent or eligible student, Cabarrus County Schools will notify the parent or eligible student of the decision and advise them of their right to a hearing under the grievance procedures in Policy 1740.\n\n4. The right to provide written consent before Cabarrus County Schools discloses personally identifiable information from the student’s education records except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests.\n\na.

See Policy 4700 Student Records. Directory information is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if released. The primary purpose of directory information is to allow Cabarrus County Schools to include information from your child’s education records in certain school publications. Examples include a playbill; the annual yearbook; honor roll or other recognition lists;graduation programs; and sports activity sheets, showing the weight and height of team members.\n\nOutside Organizations- Directory information, which is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if released, can also be disclosed to outside organizations without a parent’s prior written consent. Outside organizations include, but are not limited to, companies that manufacture class rings or publish yearbooks.\n\nMilitary Recruiters- Two federal laws require school systems receiving assistance under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, to provide military recruiters, upon request, with the following information – names, addresses, and telephone listings –unless parents have advised the school system that they do not want their student’s information disclosed without their prior written consent.\n\nOpt-Out- (See Policy 1310/4002 Parental Involvement) If you do not want Cabarrus County Schools to disclose any or all of the types of information designated below as directory information from your child’s education records without your prior written consent, you must notify, in writing, the principal of the school where the records are kept within 15 days of the opening day of school in the fall semester. The objections must state which information the parent or student does not want to be classified as directory information. If Cabarrus County Schools does not receive notice by that date, it will assume there is no objection to the release of such information. Cabarrus County Schools believes that it is in the students' best interest to have such information released in school and community newspapers because of the recognition it gives the students. Cabarrus County Schools make every reasonable effort to protect student privacy. For example, it is our policy not to release information to businesses for commercial purposes, and Cabarrus County Schools does not release information to individuals without good reason. Therefore, most parents do not restrict the release of directory information.\n\nDirectory Information- Cabarrus County Schools has designated the following information as directory information for all elementary and secondary grade students:\n\n● Student’s name;\n\n● Grade level;\n\n● Dates of attendance;\n\n● Photograph; and\n\n● Pictures or videos taken on buses, school grounds, in school buildings, and at school activities, unless the picture or video may reveal confidential or embarrassing information about a student.\n\nIn addition, for all secondary grade students, Cabarrus County Schools has also designated the following information as directory information:\n\n● Address;\n\n● Date of birth;\n\n● Participation in officially recognized activities and sports;\n\n● Weight and height of members of athletic teams;\n\n● Diplomas (including endorsements earned);\n\n● Certifications and awards received; and\n\n● Most recent previous school attended.\n\nPARENT INVOLVEMENT\n\nThe Board recognizes the critical role of parents/guardians in the education of their children and in the schools. Each parent/guardian is encouraged to learn about the educational program, the educational goals and objectives of the system, and his/her own child’s progress. The Board also encourages parents/guardians to participate in activities designed by the schools to involve them, such as parent conferences, to encourage effective communication. Each school will inform parents of plans to enhance parent involvement. Details regarding parental involvement are included in Board Policy 1310/4002 Parental Involvement.\n\nSCHOOL SURVEYS\n\nThe Parent Bill of Rights requires parental consent for any surveys asking items in sensitive areas as listed in Cabarrus County School Policy 4720.

Parents who wish to opt out of these surveys can complete an “opt out” if notified that their child’s classroom has been selected to participate in either of these surveys.\n\nThe Youth Risk Behavior Survey asks students for information about questions related to concerning or risky health behaviors including substance use, mental health concerns, and interpersonal relationships. Generally, these surveys are delivered to a small percentage of students at one to three school sites selected by the Center for Disease Control and the Department of Public Instruction. The Youth Tobacco Survey ask students questions about their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors associated with the use of tobacco and the prevention thereof. This survey is delivered to a small group of students randomly selected across a small number of secondary schools.

The North Carolina Department of Public Instruction defines the appropriate content standards for each grade level and each high school course to provide a uniform set of learning standards for every public school in North Carolina. The Standard Course of Study for each course describes what students should know and should be able to do. Student progress is measured through multiple assessments including local assessments; state End-of-Grade assessments in reading, and math in grades 3–8, Science in Grades 5&8 and state End-of-Course testing in NC Math I, Math III, English II, and Biology; and CTE State Assessments (See Policy 3410 Testing and Assessment Program). Progress reports (every 4.5 weeks) and report cards (every 9 weeks) are sent to parents to communicate student academic strengths and any areas for improvement. Parents of students in grades 6-12 have access to their child’s grades through the online website PowerSchool. Please visit the CCS Accountability website for directions on accessing the PowerSchool Parent Portal.\n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS\n\nVisit the Curriculum and Instruction website for parent/family resources.\n\nEnroll in the CCS Canvas Course\n\nStay informed of school activities by visiting school and teacher websites and reviewing newsletters and notes.\n\nCheck PowerSchool weekly (grades 6-12) for missing assignments and current grades.\n\nReview progress reports and report cards with your child.

In Cabarrus County Schools, we believe that all children can grow and learn in classrooms that foster understanding and provide effective instruction tailored to meet the needs of each learner. Our mission is to improve schools through a systematic, data-driven, problem-solving approach. The use of a multi-tiered framework for academics, behavior and social emotional needs helps to foster student engagement, positive social interactions, and academic achievement for all students. Effective implementation of MTSS requires school staff to review and analyze available sources of data to support increased student performance and school success. These data sources may include but are not limited to, report cards, behavioral and academic screenings, Student Wellness and Teacher Perception Surveys, attendance reviews, End-of-Grade Assessments, classroom observations, health screenings (vision, motor, hearing, speech/language), assistive technology screenings, discipline records and academic benchmarks.\n\nCHILD FIND\n\nThe Exceptional Children Division of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction is looking for all children and youth ages birth through 21 with special needs who may not be receiving the help needed. These include children and youth with physical disabilities, emotional disabilities and/or intellectual disabilities, and children and youth with suspected disabilities who are highly mobile, migrant and/or homeless. If your child has a disability, or you suspect that he/she may have a disability please contact your child’s school or the Exceptional Children Director at 4401 Old Airport Road, Concord, NC 28025, or call 704-260-5770.\n\nSTUDENT PROMOTION AND ACCOUNTABILITY See Policy 3420 Student Promotion and Accountability.\n\nAppeals of Promotion Decisions Within five workdays of receiving the principal’s written decision to promote or retain a student, the student’s parents may appeal the decision to the superintendent or designee.\n\nRepeating a Previously Failed Course for Credit As provided in State Board of Education Policy CCRE 001, Course for Credit, high school students who fail a course for credit may repeat that course. To take advantage of this option, the student must repeat the entire course. When a student initially fails a high school course and successfully repeats the course for credit, the new course grade will suppress the original failing grade for the course on the student’s transcript and in calculations of the student’s GPA, class rank, and honor roll eligibility.\n\nRepeating a Course for Which Credit was Earned (Grade Suppression) The board recognizes high school students may need to repeat a course for which they have earned credit to increase their understanding of the course content, to improve skill mastery, or to meet postsecondary goals. Students may repeat a course for which they have previously earned credit, subject to the following preconditions and any other reasonable rules established by the superintendent or designee:\n\n● the student must make a written request to repeat the course;\n\n● the principal or designee must approve the request;\n\n● there must be space available after seats have been assigned to students who are taking the course for the first time or repeating a\n\npreviously failed course;\n\n● the course to be repeated must be a duplicate of the original class and must be taken during the regular school day at a high school in\n\nthis school system or through the North Carolina Virtual Public School (spring, fall, or yearlong only);\n\n● upon completion of the repeated course, the new course grade will suppress the student’s original grade on the student’s transcript and\n\nin calculations of the student’s GPA, class rank, and honor roll eligibility, regardless of whether the latergrade is higher or lower than the\n\nstudent’s original mark;\n\n● credit towards graduation for the same course will be given only once;\n\n● a course may be repeated only one time;\n\n● students may repeat a maximum of four previously passed courses during their high school careers; and\n\n● the course must be taken within two semesters of the original course.\n\nCredit by Demonstrated Mastery (CDM) Students in grades 9 through 12 can apply to earn course credit by demonstrating mastery of course material without first completing the regular period of classroom instruction in the course. Students in grades 6 through 8 may earn credit by demonstrating mastery of high school courses offered in middle school. Students and families should contact their school’s counseling department for more information. To earn credit by demonstrated mastery, students must demonstrate a deep understanding of the content standards and application of knowledge through a multi-phase assessment, following standards established by the State Board of Education and any additional standards established by the superintendent.\n\nSCHOOL TO PARENT COMMUNICATION: PARENTSQUARE NOTIFICATION PROGRAM Keeping parents informed is a priority for Cabarrus County Schools. ParentSquare will be used system-wide to provide the means for emergency communication, attendance notification, and community outreach information. By providing your contact information in PowerSchool, you are consenting to receive recorded phone calls and email messages from the school system (e.g., school updates, weather closings, attendance calls). To ensure that you continue to receive messages, the information on file for your student(s) must be accurate. It is your responsibility to notify the school about any updates to your contact information. All district and school, grade level and classroom information will now be sent to your computer or phone via email and/or text.

Kindergarten students receive report cards aligned to the NC ELI (North Carolina Early Learning Inventory) objectives and dimensions which are aligned to the North Carolina Standard Course of Study. Standards-Based Report Cards provide feedback on individual student’s progression toward proficiency on standards aligned with the North Carolina Standard Course of Study. Each quarter report cards are sent home electronically, and parents may request hard copies of these reports from their home school. Additionally, parents can expect weekly feedback on their child’s work. Students in grades 6-12 receive a Traditional Report Card calculated using a 10-point grading scale. Parents have access to their child’s grades 24/7 using PowerSchool’s Parent Portal. Parents can log in to Parent Portal by visiting the Cabarrus County Schools website, www.cabarrus.k12.nc.us/ccs, and clicking PowerSchool Parent Portal under “Useful Links.” If you do not yet have a Parent Portal login, contact your child’s school.\n\nHEALTHFUL LIVING: REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND SAFETY (FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION)\n\nFor more information see Policy 6100 Goals of Student Health Services and Policy 6140 Student Wellness Cabarrus County Schools is committed to a sound school health program that provides students with accurate information and encourages them to be responsible for their own health and behavior. The district recognizes the primary role of parents/guardians in providing for the health and well-being of their children and seeks to involve parents/guardians in the schools. The school health education program provided by the district will meet all requirements established by state and federal law. The school health education program will meet all objectives in the North Carolina Standard Course of Study adopted by the State Board of Education.\n\nThe school health education program will be taught to students from grades K-9. In grades 4-9, students are taught Reproductive Health, and Safety. Every effort has been made to provide quality Reproductive Health and Safety instruction for your child. Teachers have received special training and will only use approved curriculum materials and supplements when teaching in the classroom.\n\nCurriculum materials are accessible for review on the Curriculum and Instruction webpage. You may request your child be excluded from the Reproductive Health and Safety curriculum. If you choose to exclude your child, you must do so in writing to the principal and teacher stating you do not want your child to participate. Alternate and comparable assignments will be given.\n\nREMOTE LEARNING\n\nIf schools are closed for an extended amount of time, CCS will utilize multiple resources to provide remote learning, including Canvas, our Learning Management System (LMS), posted videos and assignments, phone calls, video conferencing, and long-term projects. Two-way communication is extremely important in a remote learning situation. CCS is committed to providing high-quality instruction in any situation.\n\nParents and guardians: One of the greatest concerns of Cabarrus County Schools is that your children will be safe when traveling to and from school. The following guidelines have been developed by Cabarrus County Schools to help ensure the safety of all students. See Policy 6300 Goals of Student Transportation Services, Policy 6305 Safety, and Student Transportation Services, and the Transportation website for more information.\n\nSAFETY GUIDELINES (STUDENTS)\n\n● Respect the “Danger Zone.” This is ten feet wide (5 giant steps) on all sides of the bus.\n\n● Students should not run and/or play while waiting for the bus and must always keep their hands to themselves.\n\n● When crossing the street at a bus stop, make sure the bus is stopped, the door is open, the stop signal is out, and all other traffic has\n\ncome to a complete stop before attempting to get on the bus. Look for the bus driver to give the appropriate hand signal before\n\nattempting to cross the street.\n\n● Never go behind the bus.\n\n● Secure all loose or hand-carried items by placing them in book bags or school bags.

Failure to do so may result in a suspension of the school transportation services. Damage repairs will be charged back to students/parents. Suspension may be invoked after an administrator investigates the reported misconduct. Keep in mind, that school-provided transportation is a privilege, not a right.\n\nPursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-132.2 Administrators may prosecute a student or adult under state law for the following acts:\n\n● Willfully trespassing upon or damaging a school bus.\n\n● Entering a school bus or activity bus after being forbidden to do so.\n\n● Refusing to leave a bus upon request.\n\n● Throwing an object out of the bus that causes injuries or other property damage.\n\n● Willfully stopping, impeding, delaying, or detaining a school bus or activity bus.\n\n● School bus rules and actions of school bus drivers are implemented for the safety of\n\nstudents.\n\nBus routes are developed according to N.C.

(See also Policy 6120 Student Health Services, Policy 6125 Administering Medicines to Students, Policy 5023/6127/7266 Emergency Epinephrine Auto-Injector Devices, and Administrative Guideline 6130-AG Food Allergies).\n\nMEDICATION POLICY\n\n● All medicines brought to school must be in the original container.\n\n● All prescription medicines must have a pharmacy label.\n\n● No medicine can be accepted by school staff without a medical provider’s order and parent/guardian permission.\n\n● Any medicines (prescription or over the counter) to be given by the School Nurse and/or school staff must have a written order from the\n\nmedical provider and parent/guardian permission.\n\n● All new medicine orders must be reviewed and signed by a School Nurse before school staff can administer it.\n\n● All medicines to be given by the School Nurse or staff must be brought to school by parent/guardian and picked up when medicine\n\nexpires is discontinued, or at the end of the school year.\n\n● Students can self-administer/carry 1 or 2 doses of over-the-counter medicines in the original container with a note from parent/guardian.\n\n● Students may self-administer/carry prescription, lifesaving medications such as asthma inhalers, epi-pens, or insulin with a written order\n\nfrom a medical provider, and parent/guardian permission and a signed a self-administration contract with the school nurse.\n\nSEVERE FOOD ALLERGY POLICY\n\n● CCS does not sell any peanut products in cafeterias or vending machines.\n\n● If your child has a life-threatening food allergy, please bring the School Nurse a diet order from your child’s medical provider.\n\n● The school will work with the parents whose children have severe food allergies and their medical providers to develop safe plans for the\n\nchild at school.\n\n● Upon parental request, plans can be made for children with life-threatening food allergies to sit at a specific table in the cafeteria that\n\nreduces the chance of their exposure to the allergen.\n\n● All school staff that have contact with a child with life-threatening allergies to foods will be made aware of the child’s emergency plan and\n\ntrained to recognize the symptoms of and respond to an allergic reaction.\n\n● It is impossible to create a peanut-free or allergen-free environment. To create the illusion that the school environment is free of allergens\n\nwould be misleading and potentially harmful. Instead, this guideline has been designed to increase awareness and communication, to\n\nprevent possible exposure to identify allergens, and to createan emergency procedure for allergic reactions.\n\nMASS SCREENINGS\n\nRoutine mass screenings, such as vision, lice, hearing, and dental are performed annually according to NC state recommendations. If you do not wish for your child to participate, please notify the school/school nurse. If there are concerns regarding a child’s screening results, you will be notified.\n\nGARRETT’S LAW (Information about Flu, Meningitis, and HPV)\n\nGarrett’s Law (Senate Bill 444) mandates schools provide parents and guardians with information about meningococcal meningitis, influenza, and the vaccines that protect against these diseases. This law was expanded to include information about the human papillomavirus (HPV) and the vaccines available to protect against HPV.\n\nViral Infections Including Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 (CORONA VIRUS) The flu is a viral infection that can cause illness with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Symptoms of the flu include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, chills, fatigue, and headache. Sometimes, vomiting and/or diarrhea can occur, although they are not usually the primary symptoms. COVID-19 has similar symptoms and includes shortness of breath, muscle aches, loss of the sense of taste or smell. Both illnesses can be spread through respiratory droplets from a cough or a sneeze, or from droplets on unwashed hands. It is important to protect yourself and others against the flu, COVID-19, and other illnesses. Students and families are strongly encouraged to do so by doing the following:\n\n● Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based hand\n\nsanitizers.\n\n● Cover your coughs and sneezes with tissues.\n\n● Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n● Stay away from people who are sick.\n\n● Stay home from work or school until 24 hours fever-free (without the use of fever-reducing medications). The flu can be especially\n\ndangerous in people with chronic health conditions and people with lowered immunity.\n\n● Get vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19 when eligible. Contact your healthcare provider or local health department.\n\n● Wearing a mask when concerned about levels of transmissible disease or as directed in extreme circumstances by the Board of\n\nEducation or Superintendent.\n\nFlu Vaccine The flu vaccine prevents the flu. The flu shot is encouraged because the flu can lead to other problems including pneumonia, inflammation of the heart, and inflammation of the lungs. Healthy children younger than 5 years of age are more likely than adults to be hospitalized for complications from the flu. The vaccine protects between 45 and 90% of healthy children from getting the flu. Studies have shown that the older and healthier children are when they get a flu shot, the more likely they will be protected.\n\nFor more information and for educational materials about the flu, go to: http://www.flu.gov/ or http://www.cdc.gov/flu/. For information about the flu vaccine, go to: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis statements/flu.pdf.\n\nMeningococcal Meningitis Meningitis is an infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It can be caused by a virus or bacteria. Viral meningitis is more common, and people usually recover fully. Bacterial meningitis is rare, but much more serious. Meningococcal disease is a serious bacterial illness. It is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children in the United States. Meningococcal disease can also cause blood infections.\n\nSymptoms of bacterial meningitis include severe headache, high fever, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, rash, fatigue, and confusion. Not all of these symptoms may be present. Meningitis is spread by close exchange of saliva and respiratory secretions. It can be spread through coughing, sneezing, kissing, and sharing items such as eating utensils, lip balms, drinks, and cigarettes. You can protect yourself against this disease and other illnesses by not sharing food items or utensils, by having good handwashing etiquette, and by covering coughs and sneezes, as stated above. Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent this disease. A vaccine against meningococcal meningitis, which is recommended for school-aged children, is available through the local health department or private healthcare providers.\n\nFor more information and for educational materials about meningococcal meningitis, go to: http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/index.html. For information about the meningococcal meningitis vaccine, go to: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mening.pdf.\n\nHuman Papillomavirus (HPV)\n\n● HPV is a common virus that is spread from one person to another by close intimate contact. It is the most common sexually transmitted\n\nvirus in the United States. Many different types of HPV can infect both men and women and can raise the risk of cervical cancer in\n\nwomen\n\n.\n\n● The virus lives in the body and usually causes no symptoms, but some types of HPV can cause visible growths or bumps on the genital\n\narea. Other types of HPV can lead to cervical cancer in women. Many people with HPV do not know they are infected, which is why it\n\ncan be easily passed to others without realizing it. A vaccine is available for boys and girls 11 or 12 years of age.\n\n● For more information about the human papillomavirus (HPV), http://www.cdc.gov/HPV/index.html. For information about the HPV\n\nvaccine: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/hpv gardasil.pdf.
