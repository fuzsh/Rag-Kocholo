        "text": "Types of spatial knowledge\n\nThe main experimental question that this study sought to address was how to present building layout information to inspectors in a way that supports the development of their spatial knowledge of the environment but does not impede their ability to attend to other aspects of the environment. Inspectors must pay close attention to their environment as they move through a facility, both to ensure their safety as they move through a hazardous industrial environment, and to be on the lookout for any subtle cues that could indicate the diversion or misuse of nuclear materials or facilities. At the same time, they must build and maintain their spatial knowledge of the facility and their location within it. If the inspectors have more complete spatial knowledge of the facility, they will be better able to detect anomalies in the processes and operations of the facility, the layout of the building, or instances in which their guide leads them on circuitous routes, avoiding certain areas of the facility.\n\nThe question of what constitutes spatial knowledge is rather complex. It has been shown that there are at least three different levels of spatial knowledge: landmark, route, and survey knowledge (Siegel & White, 1975). Landmark knowledge refers to one’s memory for objects encountered in the environment (detached from the object’s location) and has recently been shown to develop in the absence of overt attention (van Asselen, Fritschy, & Postma, 2006). Route knowledge is defined as knowledge of an environment that is anchored by a series of actions taken at specific decision points. Route knowledge is more abstract that landmark knowledge and can contain the path between different landmarks, but is not thought to encompass aspects of the environment that were not encountered as part of a learned route nor to include metric knowledge about the distance between landmarks. Finally, survey knowledge is the most detailed representation of the relationships between all places in the environment. Survey knowledge represents the space from an allocentric point of view (i.e., relationships between places represented in terms of cardinal directions, angular degrees, or some other objective measurement) as opposed to an egocentric point of view as in route knowledge (i.e., turning left or right based on the individual’s location in the environment). Survey knowledge is marked by the ability to estimate straight-line directions and/or distances between landmarks, especially those that were never traversed between, and is believed to require effortful attention to generate.\n\nAlthough Siegel and White (1975) originally suggested that these three levels of spatial knowledge develop sequentially, Montello (1998) proposed a competing framework suggesting simultaneous development of survey knowledge in parallel with the other levels of spatial knowledge. Indeed, Ishikawa and Montello (2006) demonstrated that large individual differences exist in the type of spatial knowledge that individuals learn about a novel environment after repeated exposures: some people developed survey knowledge almost immediately, some people never did, and still others showed a continuous progression in their knowledge. Similarly, Hölscher, Meilinger, Vrachliotis, Brösamle, and Knauff (2004) found that even people who were highly familiar with a particular building showed poor survey knowledge, even if they had excellent route knowledge. The evidence from these prior studies suggests that one model of spatial knowledge development may not fit all learners in all situations.\n\nInfluence of learning conditions on spatial knowledge development\n\nSome work exists in the cognitive science literature regarding what types of learning conditions best support the development of spatial knowledge, although none of it specifically addresses the constraints faced by IAEA inspectors. For example, it has been shown that being passively led along a route leads to worse spatial knowledge than if the individual has active control over their navigation (for review, see Chrastil & Warren, 2012). As such, IAEA inspectors already start at a disadvantage because they have no choice but to be passively led through the facility. Moreover, much of the cognitive science literature considers spatial learning and testing that takes place exclusively in a virtual environment (e.g., Carassa, Geminiani, Morganti, & Varotto, 2002; Chrastil & Warren, 2013, 2015), such as watching videos and being tested in a virtual environment (e.g., Meilinger, Knauff, & Bülthoff, 2008), learning maps of an environment without ever seeing it in person (e.g., Coluccia, 2008; Garden, Cornoldi, & Logie, 2002), or learning a route through a combination of virtual environments and still photographs (e.g., Gaunet, Vidal, Kemeny, & Berthoz, 2001). Since it is rarely possible to create virtual, video, or other digital representations of nuclear facilities, many of these findings from the cognitive science literature are not applicable to the IAEA. Similarly, there are tight restrictions on bringing electronic devices into nuclear facilities. While there have been several studies of digitally aided navigation and wayfinding (cf. Münzer, Zimmer, & Baus, 2012; Richter, Dara-Abrams, & Raubal, 2010; Schmid, Richter, & Peters, 2010; Schwering, Krukar, Li, Anacta, & Fuest, 2017), we cannot employ digital aids in this problem space. However, we can draw upon what other researchers have learned from comparisons of different methods of route learning.\n\nThere have been several studies that have compared the efficacy of learning a pre-determined route from a map versus other sources. In studies that have compared learning a route from a map versus learning through direct experience (typically by following an experimenter along a guided route), two studies have found approximately similar levels of spatial learning under both conditions (Ishikawa, Fujiwara, Imai, & Okabe, 2008; Richardson, Montello, & Hegarty, 1999). However, Ishikawa et al. (2008) found that the map group walked more slowly and made more errors than the direct experience group. This is especially relevant to IAEA safeguards inspectors because they have only a limited amount of time to complete their verification activities due to their global verification obligations as well as pressure from the nuclear facility operators to complete their activities quickly, since these activities usually cause a disruption to operational activities and, therefore, lost revenue.\n\nAdditionally, Richardson et al. (1999) noted alignment effects in the map condition (Levine, Marchon, & Hanley, 1984), in which pointing errors were higher when the participant was misaligned in space with the original orientation of their map, suggesting that people build an orientation-specific representation when learning from a map. Thorndyke and Hayes-Roth (1982) found better survey knowledge in map learners, but better procedural knowledge (i.e., routes between locations) in their direct experience group. However, their direct experience group worked in the building where the testing took place, so their effects could be due to prolonged exposure to the environment prior to the experiment.\n\nOther studies have compared learning a route from a map versus learning from a GPS device. While the use of GPS is not an option for IAEA safeguards inspectors due to limited functionality of these devices indoors and restrictions on the use of electronic devices in nuclear facilities, GPS-aided spatial learning is similar to the guided navigation that safeguards inspectors experience while being led through a facility. Research in this area has shown that GPS tends to produce worse spatial learning outcomes, particularly on complex parts of the route (Ishikawa et al., 2008; Willis, Hölscher, Wilbertz, & Li, 2009). Willis et al. (2009) posited that the piecemeal way in which the map was displayed to participants in the GPS condition may have contributed to a more fragmented knowledge of the configural layout of the environment, relative to the map condition in which the entire environment was visible at once.\n\nLi, Brown, Pinchin, and Blakey (2015) compared learning a route through a complex, indoor environment (a hospital) from a map versus a verbal description and found that participants learned the route equally well from both sources, although the map group was able to walk the route in reverse faster than the verbal description group.\n\nOther studies have assessed the impact of different types of GPS-style wayfinding aids on spatial learning. For example, Löwen, Krukar, and Schwering (2019) compared map schematizations that emphasized different types of features along a route. The maps could emphasize local features (such as local landmarks), global features (structural features, such as city or area boundaries), or both. They found that accentuating local features improved participants’ route knowledge, but not their survey knowledge, while accentuating global features improved participants’ survey knowledge, but not their route knowledge. Similarly, Münzer et al. (2012) found tradeoffs between learning routes and learning configural information when participants used mobile navigation assistance systems that presented different types of information. When the presentation mode provided configural information, participants had better configural knowledge, but poorer wayfinding performance. When the presentation mode emphasized the route, participants had better wayfinding performance, but poorer configural knowledge. The researchers also found that individual differences in the participants’ sense of direction had a substantial impact on both types of learning.\n\nSeveral studies have compared learning a route from a map versus pictures and/or videos of the route. In the same study just described, Li et al. (2015) found that people were better able to learn a route through a hospital from a video of the route than a map alone, as measured by their speed in traversing the route both forward and backward, although there were no differences in the number of errors made. Münzer and Stahl (2011) compared learning an indoor route from a map, egocentric photos of the route, or an egocentric video of the route. In terms of errors made, the map did not differ from the combination of the two egocentric conditions; however, the map condition did induce more hesitations than the video. Across these two studies, it seems that the ability to reproduce a specific route in an indoor environment is roughly equally supported by both maps and pictures/videos, with the caveat that the maps may induce higher cognitive load, as evidenced by taking longer to complete the route or showing more hesitations along the way. However, neither of these studies probed other aspects of spatial learning, like survey knowledge of the environment, so we cannot say how these two learning conditions extend beyond reproducing a specific route.\n\nAt least two studies have compared learning an indoor route from a map versus a virtual environment. Richardson et al. (1999) found the worst learning outcomes from their virtual environment compared to their map and direct experience conditions. On the other hand, Bliss, Tidwell, and Guest (1997) measured the ability of firefighters to reproduce a route through an unfamiliar building after learning from a map or from a virtual walkthrough of the route. They found equally good performance between the two conditions in terms of both time to complete the route and number of errors made. However, one caveat to note is that these studies are both at least 20 years old, and so it could be the case that newer, more immersive virtual reality environments may show different effects if compared directly to learning from maps.\n\nTo our knowledge, only a handful of previous studies directly compare the efficacy of different types of paper or non-interactive maps on wayfinding or spatial knowledge development. In one such study, Dillemuth (2005) tested whether participants were better able to learn an outdoor route from viewing a detailed aerial photograph versus a “generalized” map of a college campus (in which the buildings, grass, paths, etc., were filled in with a solid color). The maps were statically displayed on a handheld electronic device that did not include GPS to update position or orientation. They found that subjects performed better on their wayfinding measures when using the simple generalized map, particularly on time to route completion and number of stops made on the route. They also found that users did more zooming in and out when using the more detailed map, suggesting that more attention was required to use the detailed map. Interestingly, participants with higher sense of direction (as measured by the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale, or SBSOD) performed much better with the simple than detailed map, contrary to what may be predicted.\n\nIn another study, Liben, Myers, and Kastens (2008) asked whether different types of map shapes (i.e., circular or square) and angle (i.e., drawn from directly overhead or at an oblique angle to display the buildings in slight relief) enabled college students to more accurately locate themselves during a route-learning task. They found no differences in accuracy based on map type, but they did observe response-time differences in which the square oblique map was the fastest and square flat maps were slowest. This was interpreted as showing that participants generated the strongest spatial knowledge when using the square oblique map. Additionally, they found that people were less likely to rotate the square map to match their orientation, which could have contributed to alignment effects in their results. Unfortunately, neither of these studies measured other types of spatial knowledge (i.e., landmark or survey knowledge), so we cannot say for sure whether either of these map types supported the development of spatial knowledge more generally, or whether they were simply better suited to the tasks assessed.\n\nIn a study of map schematization, Meilinger, Hölscher, Büchner, and Brösamle (2007) tested participants’ ability to localize themselves and complete wayfinding tasks inside of a complex building, using either a standard floor plan or highly schematized maps that provided only route information. For the self-localization tasks, the participants performed equally well with either type of map. For the wayfinding tasks, participants performed better when using a schematized map. While the highly schematized maps were useful for wayfinding, they explicitly excluded survey information. For the IAEA safeguards inspectors, developing survey knowledge is extremely important, since they must be able to understand how the rooms in a facility relate to one another and to the route on which they are guided by the facility operators. Therefore, although schematized maps may be useful for indoor navigation in other contexts, they would not support the cognitive needs of the safeguards inspectors.\n\nCurrent study\n\nThe current study is unique in that we are testing participants in a former nuclear hot-cell facility, which constitutes an extremely complex, indoor environment that was designed around safety and operational requirements rather than easy human navigation. In this way, we ensure that many of the physical and visual characteristics of the environment are well-matched to those that will be faced by safeguards inspectors in the field. This is also true of the experimental conditions that we tested. We tested three types of maps that are representative of the types of maps that safeguards that inspectors have access to when visiting a facility. We obtained actual facility maps from the group that manages the building in which our experiment took place. One map was a simple facility map, intended for space management purposes. The second map was a blueprint of the facility, which was highly complex and included a great deal of extraneous detail. The third map was a 3D representation of the simple facility map, created using the widely available software tool, (SketchUp [Computer Software], 2018) (www.sketchup.com). All three of the maps showed the overall layout of the building accurately, but all three also had minor inconsistencies between the map and the building, due either to changes that had taken place in the building over time (such as the removal of a door) or a lack of detail in the map (such as a temporary rolling partition not appearing on the map). These minor inconsistencies between a map and a facility are highly common in industrial facilities, where the building’s usage changes over time, but older maps are still in use. All maps were provided to participants on standard-sized paper because IAEA inspectors are typically unable to bring electronics into safeguarded facilities. As such, interactive or digital maps were not included as test conditions.\n\nOur experimental conditions allowed us to ask several questions that are unique relative to the existing literature. First, we asked whether studying a map of the building prior to completing a guided route-learning task improves spatial learning. Next, we asked whether the ability to carry and refer to a map when learning a guided route provides an additional benefit to spatial knowledge, beyond the benefit of studying the map beforehand. Finally, we asked whether the level of detail in the map impacted spatial learning. We predicted that studying a map before the route-learning task would improve spatial knowledge, and that carrying the map during the route-learning task would provide an additional benefit. We also predicted that participants would receive a greater benefit from the simpler maps than from the complex blueprint, which was difficult to read and contained extraneous, distracting information.\n\nWe measured learning at every level of spatial knowledge (i.e., landmark, route, and survey), in addition to testing the participants’ awareness of details in their environment via a non-spatial memory test. We chose tasks that have been shown to reflect landmark knowledge (i.e., a landmark recognition memory task; Wenczel, Hepperle, & von Stülpnagel, 2017), route knowledge (i.e., drawing the guided route on an outline of the building; Labate, Pazzaglia, & Hegarty, 2014), and survey knowledge (i.e., a verbal pointing task, indicating angular direction between landmarks; Rand, Creem-Regehr, & Thompson, 2015). We also chose tasks that simultaneously tapped into multiple levels of spatial knowledge, including filling in a building outline with the name and location of learned landmarks and navigating a novel shortcut between two landmarks (Labate et al., 2014). The non-spatial memory task was designed to assess participants’ ability to maintain awareness of their environment by testing their recognition of incidental landmarks (i.e., van Asselen et al., 2006; Wenczel et al., 2017).\n\nWe also included a measure of individual differences in sense of direction, given the large differences in spatial knowledge acquisition found between people with good and poor senses of direction (Hegarty, Richardson, Montello, Lovelace, & Subbiah, 2002; Münzer et al., 2012; Wolbers & Hegarty, 2010). We administered the SBSOD (Hegarty et al., 2002), which is a 15-question scale that has been shown to be highly correlated with measures of spatial knowledge acquired from direct experiences in an environment. This allowed us to test whether the map study conditions had differential impacts on the development of spatial knowledge in individuals depending on their sense of direction. We predicted that participants with a poorer sense of direction would have lower levels of spatial knowledge, even with the aid of the maps.\n\nLow-SBSOD group\n\nFor people with a low-sense-of-direction score, the results were almost reversed from those observed for the high-sense-of-direction group. Namely, the provision of a map tended to produce lower performance on almost all tasks—unless that map was the complex map, in which case performance was roughly the same as in the no-map condition. This pattern was especially pronounced in the pointing task, shortcut task, and map completion task. Interestingly, in the map completion task, the simple map carry condition also performed on par with the no-map condition, suggesting a slight benefit for the simple map carry for developing this hybrid of route/survey knowledge.\n\nIt is notable that whenever there was a main effect of sense of direction for a particular task, the high- and low-SBSOD groups performed equally well on the no-map condition. This was true for the pointing task as well as the for route and landmark scores on the map completion task. In all three cases, when no map was provided, there were no significant differences in performance between the high- and low-SBSOD groups. When given a simple map or a SketchUp map, the high-SBSOD participants performed better on these tasks than they did without a map, while the low-SBSOD participants performed worse (with the exception of the simple map carry condition in the route completion task, as noted above). This indicates that the simpler maps helped the high-SBSOD participants while hindering the spatial learning of the low-SBSOD participants.\n\nWhen given a complex map, the high- and low-SBSOD groups had equivalent performance on the pointing task, but the low-SBSOD group had significantly higher route scores than the high-SBSOD group on the map completion task. They also had higher landmark scores on the map completion task, although the difference was not statistically significant in that case. This pattern, combined with the pattern observed for the simpler maps, as discussed above, indicates that the low-SBSOD participants may not have attempted to use the complex map, or failed to encode much information about it. This made their performance comparable to the no-map condition, which, for the low-SBSOD participants, was beneficial. The data suggests that the high-SBSOD participants either ignored or were distracted by the complex map. Just like the low-SBSOD participants, their performance was very similar for the no-map and complex map conditions, which suggests that they were not using the complex map. However, the fact that the low-SBSOD participants outperformed them on the map completion task indicates that the complex map may have been distracting for the high-SBSOD participants. In their case, having an overly complex map may be worse than having no map at all. Anecdotally, many participants in both groups complained about the complex map and commented that they did not believe it would be helpful.\n\nAnother interesting difference between the high- and low-SBSOD participants emerged for the SketchUp maps. Recall that the SketchUp maps were oriented at a 45° angle relative to the other two maps. When participants completed the pointing task, they were also oriented at a 45° angle relative to the starting point of the route, and this orientation matched the orientation of the SketchUp map. Based on the findings regarding orientation effects in the literature (e.g., Levine et al., 1984; Richardson et al., 1999), we would predict that the SketchUp map would provide the best support for the pointing task, since the studied map corresponded most closely to the demands of the task in this condition. Numerically, the high-SBSOD participants had the highest performance on the pointing task when they were in the SketchUp map condition, while the low-SBSOD participants scored lowest in that condition. The matching orientation may have provided some benefit to the high-SBSOD participants, but it did not benefit the low-SBSOD participants.\n\nSimilarly, the SketchUp map produced the worst overall performance on the map completion task for the low-SBSOD group. For this task, the difference in the orientation between the SketchUp map and the test map may have made it more difficult for people with a low sense of direction understand the relationship between these maps. Together, these findings point to the importance of map orientation to the development of spatial knowledge for people with a low sense of direction. These findings are somewhat in contrast with Liben et al. (2008), who found better performance on a map location task with a slightly oblique round map (like our SketchUp condition) relative to a flat map. However, one difference could be that all of our maps were square, whereas Liben et al. (2008) found the biggest benefits for round oblique maps, possibly because people were more likely to rotate a round map than a square map to align with their view in space. As such, one recommendation we may give to IAEA inspectors, especially those who may have a low sense of direction, would be to rotate any map that they receive to match their current orientation, as this could help support their spatial knowledge development.\n\nOverall effects of map condition\n\nThe only measure that did not show a significant main effect of sense of direction or a significant interaction between sense of direction and map condition was the landmark recognition task. Importantly, this was the only task that did not require any spatial knowledge on the part of the participants. The participants were shown pictures of objects that they had seen (or not seen) along the learned route, and they were tested on their ability to distinguish between seen and unseen items. They were not asked about the location of any of the tested items. When analyzing the RTs for this task, we observed a significant interaction between the map study condition and the landmark type (target or incidental). Namely, we found that individuals in the simple map carry and SketchUp carry conditions took significantly longer to recognize incidental landmarks than did people in the no-map condition. The average RTs for the simple map study and complex map carry conditions fell directly between the no-map and other conditions. We interpret the longer RTs from participants in the simple map carry and SketchUp carry conditions to indicate greater difficulty in recognizing the incidental landmarks. This suggests that participants who carried easy-to-read maps with them during the route-learning phase paid less attention to the environment around them, most likely because they were devoting more of their attention to the maps. People in the no-map condition had the fastest RTs for this condition, indicating that they had formed the strongest memory traces for the objects in the learning environment. Interestingly, people in the simple map study and complex map carry condition patterned together, with RTs that fell between the no-map condition and the simple map carry and SketchUp carry conditions. The participants in the simple map study condition did not have a map with them during the route, but they may have been trying to recall the map that they had studied previously, drawing some amount of attention away from the environment itself. The results on the other tasks indicate that the participants largely ignored the complex map, but participants did report that they referred to it during the route-learning phase. Eighteen of the 24 participants in the complex map condition (13 in the high-SBSOD group and five in the low-SBSOD group) reported that they referred to the map occasionally, frequently, or very frequently during the route-learning phase, which was quite similar to the self-reports of the participants in other groups (20 participants in the simple map carry and 19 participants in the SketchUp carry conditions reported referring to their map occasionally, frequently, or very frequently). These references drew some attention away from encoding the incidental landmarks in the building, but it seems clear that the participants were less engaged with the complex map than they were with the easier-to-read maps.\n\nOne of the main goals of this study was to determine how to support the development of spatial knowledge for an environment without impeding awareness of other factors in the environment. This is important for IAEA safeguards inspectors, who must develop an understanding of a facility’s layout while being alert to safety hazards and anomalies in the environment that could warrant further investigation. Our findings suggest that carrying an easy-to-read map improved spatial learning for participants with a good sense of direction, but it also had a negative impact on participants’ awareness of their environment, regardless of the participants’ sense of direction.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that different map types have pros and cons for the development of spatial knowledge, depending on the sense of direction of the individual using the map as well as that person’s goals. For individuals with a good sense of direction, the provision of both simple 2D and 3D maps was beneficial to the development of spatial knowledge (especially route and survey knowledge), relative to having no map or an overly complicated and/or difficult-to-read map. These participants benefited from using one of the simple maps, regardless of whether they studied the map before entering the facility or carried the map with them while learning the route. However, the maps could also hinder these participants in some ways. Referring to the simple maps during the route-learning task impacted their encoding of incidental landmarks along the route. Also, there was evidence that these participants were hindered by trying to make sense of the complex maps, impacting their ability to reconstruct their route and the locations of the landmarks on the map completion task.\n\nIn contrast, individuals with a poorer sense of direction performed best when they were not provided with a map of the facility, or when they were provided with a complex map (which they proceeded to ignore). This suggests that the participants with a lower sense of direction had to expend additional attentional resources trying to understand the maps and their relationship to the building, and that this effort overshadowed any benefits of receiving the map in the first place. The only task on which receiving a map benefitted the low sense of direction group was the route fill-in portion of the map completion task, which measured a hybrid of route and survey knowledge. Finally, like the participants with a good sense of direction, these participants also had poorer encoding of the incidental landmarks when they were carrying one of the simpler maps, as indicated by significantly longer RTs when they were tested on their memory for the incidental landmarks.\n\nThe goal of this work was two-fold. First, we sought to address gaps in the literature on the cognitive science of spatial knowledge development in order to understand the potential impacts of map exposure and map type on the development of spatial knowledge for a novel, indoor environment in a guided navigation task. Second, we sought to use this information to make recommendations to the IAEA regarding empirically supported ways to aid international nuclear safeguards inspectors in their development of spatial knowledge while being led on a guided route through a complex nuclear facility. From our current findings, we would make the following recommendations to the IAEA. First, given the large differences in performance that we observed based on an individual’s sense of direction, we would recommend that inspection team members self-assess their own sense of direction and select roles based on this result. For example, if there is a facility map available, an inspector with a good sense of direction should take on the task of studying the map prior to entering the facility. Inspectors with a poor sense of direction should not attempt to memorize or use a facility map, because even trying to hold a map layout in mind was detrimental to several measures of performance for the low sense of direction group in our study. That being said, we would recommend that even inspectors with a high sense of direction forego consulting a map while being led through the building, given that we did not observe additional benefits for carrying a map relative to studying a map beforehand, but we did see a detriment to awareness of the environment when people were actively referring to a map while walking the route. However, when working in teams, it may be beneficial for one inspector (with a good sense of direction) to track the group’s location on a map while other inspectors are tasked with attending to the environment as they move through a facility. When more than one inspector is present, these roles can be divided.\n\nFinally, our results indicate that the simpler the map, the better. We did not find additional benefits for the 3D SketchUp map condition, and indeed found that this map condition may have hindered performance for people with a poorer sense of direction. We also did not find benefits to either group from the complex map (however, it consistently patterned with the no-map condition, suggesting that people were not using it).\n\nOur study is not without caveats. First, the different map conditions employed were somewhat limited, based on the materials that were available for the facility used in the experiment. We also limited ourselves to maps that could easily fit on a piece of paper, to stay in line with the constraints faced by IAEA inspectors in the field (i.e., they are typically unable to bring electronic devices into facilities, so an interactive map was not an option). While the map types used in this study are a realistic representation of the types of maps that are available to safeguards inspectors, there are many other types of maps that might provide better support for the acquisition of route and survey knowledge in complex, indoor environments. Interactive digital maps or schematized maps that emphasize different features of a building (cf. Löwen et al., 2019; Meilinger et al., 2007; Münzer et al., 2012) may outperform any of the map types that we tested in the current study. In domains that are less constrained than nuclear safeguards inspections, these other types of maps may be preferable. Secondly, our participant population was chosen so as to be naïve to the environment; as such, our findings can only answer how well our map conditions help develop spatial knowledge of a completely novel environment. It is possible that receiving a map of a somewhat familiar environment may be helpful to people with a low sense of direction. This may be especially relevant to IAEA inspectors because they will often return to facilities multiple times over the course of several months or years, and thus may have differing levels of existing spatial knowledge on which to build. Thirdly, our participant population did not contain professionally trained inspectors. We might expect that IAEA inspectors, through some combination of training, experience, or both, have developed their own wayfinding or memory strategies to employ during an inspection. Future work could explore any or all of these topics, as each will be important to furthering our understanding of how to best provide IAEA safeguards inspectors with information to aid the efficacy and efficiency of their spatial knowledge development when performing inspections in the field."
