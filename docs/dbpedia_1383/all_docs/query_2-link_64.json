        "text": "Richard J. (Dick) Wenzel passed away peacefully at his home on July 8, 2021 after a struggle with pulmonary fibrosis. He was born on January 14, 1943 to Norman and Mabel (Strey) Wenzel. On February 27, 1965 he married the love of his life, Jane Barnes at St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Oshkosh.\n\nDick graduated from Oshkosh High School, Class of 1961. He then attended UW-O. Dick proudly served his country in the United States Air Force from 1964-1968.\n\nIn March of 1969, he started his career with Cumings Electric and eventually became half owner. He was dedicated to the success of the business and to the workers that he considered family. Dick retired in 2017. He was a member of Fox Valley Builders Association and served on the Oshkosh Electrical Board.\n\nDick loved to fish, competing in Otter Street Fishing Tournaments, Mercury Walleye Weekend, and his yearly fishing trips to Canada with his brother. He also loved to deer and turkey hunt, especially with his sons. Weekends were for early morning golf, which he thoroughly enjoyed no matter the weather. Their cabin in Waupaca was Dick’s home away from home. Mowing the lawn (the “right” way), enjoying deer watching, feeding the birds, and occasionally a trip to the casino. Above all he loved his family and friends. Spending time with them is what truly made him happy.\n\nDick is survived by his wife of 56 years, Jane. His children: Mark (Kay) Wenzel, Lori Wenzel, friend Barb Behm, Michael (Angela) Wenzel. His three wonderful grandchildren: Katlyn, Jack, and Ellyn, whom he loved more than words can say. He is also survived by his sister, Marion Daley, brothers: Ronald (Eunice) Wenzel, and William (Bonnie) Wenzel, sister-in-law, Karen Wenzel, brother-in-law, Loren (Jay) Kenefick and sister and brother-in-law Keith (Mary) Hess. Dick is also survived by many nieces and nephews.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his sisters, Carol Kenefick, Susan Wenzel, and identical twin brother Douglas. He was also preceded in death by his in laws, Howard and Veronica Barnes, brothers-in law, Tom Daley and Herbert Barnes.\n\nFuneral services will be at Konrad Behlman Funeral Home, 402 Waugoo Ave. Oshkosh with Rev. Karen Jewell officiating on Thursday July 15, 2021. Visitation will take place starting at 9:30 am until the service starts at 11:30 am. Full military honors will take place at the funeral home following the service. A memorial is being established for the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation to help protect the outdoors that Dick cared so deeply about.\n\nDue to Covid, it is requested that people who are not fully vaccinated wear a mask when greeting family."
