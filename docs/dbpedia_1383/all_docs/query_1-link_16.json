        "text": "My name is Michael Wenzel and I am a Division I club soccer player. I was captain of my 2015 season and led my team to an undefeated season and a State Championship. This was a great experience and it has helped me set high goals for the rest of my soccer career. I am a leader, have a high work ethic, and always put the team before myself. I lead by example and play with a concentrated mindset. I have learned many things about myself through soccer. I have learned that academics is the core that shapes your future, no matter what you want to do. I have been a captain for my high school varsity soccer team both Freshman and Sophomore year. I was selected captain through my leadership and strong character. I take pride in being a smart individual on and off the field and I have had many influential role models help me get to this stage and I look forward to improving my skills to be part of a collegiate soccer program."
