        "text": "There is no doubt about the contributions of Pliny and Gail and the Center for Maximum Building Potential. But the article fails to mention the roots - Energy Star (named after the Capitol of the Lone Star Republic where it was created )and how that morphed into the nation‚Äôs first green building program - long before the USGBC. That goes all the way back to the early 1980s and it‚Äôs a great story that needs to be told as well. UT School Of Architecture Professor Paco Arumi, as well as city councilmember Roger Duncan, need mention for their foundational research and support. Long story short Energy Star was a brain child of many - including a few volunteer UTSOA graduate students (such as myself) , local design professionals (such as LM Holder III), city employees, environmental activists (such as T Paul Robbins), and Paco Arumi‚Äòs DEROB (the Dynamic Response of Buildings) energy analysis program from the late 70's early 80's. Thanks to the inspirated thinking and guidance of these folks many learned and promoted the concept of \"demand-side management\" (where the cheapest kilowatt is one never needed in the first place, for example) and applied that to Austin's electricity as well as water consumption. When we wanted to bring the building community into the fold to reduce the amount of waste ending up in our landfills (a larger percentage of which came from deconstruction, demolition and new building), the Energy Star program name was no longer fitting and it got changed to \"Green\" Building. THAT is more of the whole story of how the Green Building movement got started in North America!\n\nIt's the best time of the year...applications for our 2024 USGBC Local Market Leadership Awards are now open! USGBC‚Äôs Local Market Leadership Awards recognize the people, projects and partners that demonstrate excellence in working to create better buildings and to improve the lives of all in their local communities.

Stephen Ritz, a Bronx-based educator who founded Green Bronx Machine, is on a mission to change all that. He‚Äôs developed an incredibly successful whole-school curriculum, aligned to a data-driven indoor academic gardening program that allows children to grow vegetables in school, improving academic performance, changing eating habits, increasing classroom engagement, and providing pathways for 21st century employment. The award-winning documentary ‚ÄúGeneration Growth‚Äù follows Mister Ritz as he expands his low-cost, easily replicable program throughout the country, bringing passion, purpose, and hope to the communities, students, and teachers who need it most.
