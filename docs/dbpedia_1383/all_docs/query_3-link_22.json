A big thanks for giving up your mornings! #Playwork #play #looseparts #ludicecologyreport\n\nTo be able to understand how soil microbes can influence the sustainability of our food production, we first need to learn to see them. #regenerativeagriculture #soilfoodweb\n\nSwipe through our upcoming training ‚û°Ô∏è Fern Identification for botanical surveying and habitat classification üëâ Identify a wide variety of species and identify key features üîó https://lnkd.in/dpyubfiY Water Vole Ecology and Surveys üëâ The background ecology of, and appropriate survey techniques üîó https://lnkd.in/gFxyT3At Water Vole live-trapping üëâ Gain experience in choosing equipment and planning a trapping project üîó https://lnkd.in/gEEsrtRn National Vegetation Classification Woodlands üëâ Understand the characteristics of types of vegetation communities üîó https://lnkd.in/gA_26_KT\n\nSo, the answer from Monday's question is around 30,000 different species of bacteria, fungi, nematodes, worms, protozoa, etc. in a tablespoon of soil. Now, is there anyone who knows the answer to this question? How many of those species have been identified and we understand their importance in soil ecology and the role they play in soil health? Check back on Friday for the answer, or guess in the comments and the closest to the correct answer wins a prize. Make it a great day! #landscapearchitecture #landscapedesign #nurserymanager #hydroseeding #landscapemaintenance #landscaping\n\nHow can we get more trees per person to restore the local water cycle and local ecology? We should demand cities, towns, districts and villages to start setting targets for tree coverage. That will give direction and focus for increasing the tree cover.\n\nWhy Do Deer Lick Salt Blocks? Deer, with their graceful movements and captivating presence, are a common sight in many parts of the world. Observing these creatures in their natural habitat often raises questions, and one expected behavior that piques the curiosity of many is their tendency to lick salt blocks. Why do deer engage in this behavior, and what does it reveal about their biology and ecology?

The ability to change our soil‚Äôs resilience and productivity is there, using multiple techniques. The greater understanding we have to it‚Äôs function and utilising a multifaceted approach, we can help speed up the moving to re enlivening soils and plant growth. My main takeaways- 1 There is no magic bullet 2 Soil food web is critical- as part of the toolkit 3 I know even less than I thought.\n\n#UBCForestry professor Dr. Suzanne Simard has been named to the TIME 100 Most Influential People List! \"Human beings may pride themselves on the buried webs of wire and fibre-optic cables that allow far-flung populations to keep in touch, but the trees beat us to it‚Äîby many millions of years. That is the revolutionary finding of Suzanne Simard, professor of forest ecology at the University of British Columbia, and the author of Finding the Mother Tree.\" Continue reading: https://bit.ly/3JkLgrA"
