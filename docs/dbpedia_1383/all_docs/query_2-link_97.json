        "text": "🚀 I’m taking off shortly, and I’m takin’ the cat with me! 🚀 After leading #D•Central on this exciting journey, I’m stepping back and starting a new path…! Yet don’t worry, I’m taking #AstroCat with me…! Can't leave our AI mascot behind... Once bitten by AI, its impossible to go back. That is the true power of technology. Embarking on the journey of D•Central, we envisioned not just a company, but a revolution in decentralized working. From our vibrant hub in Asia Pacific to the dynamic landscapes of Africa, India, Europe, and the US, we've built more than a brand; we've crafted a global movement, smashing boundaries in 13 fantastic markets! 🤖 AI: Our Secret Sauce 🤖 Woven into our DNA, AI didn’t just enhance our workflows; it was the revolutionary heartbeat that propelled us into innovative tomorrows, optimizing our today, and elevating our workshops to realms uncharted. 🚀 A Salute to My Crew 🚀 A heartfelt cheer to the unsung heroes, especially to the stalwarts, Gela (employee #1 4Ever! The OG project jumpstarter), Jaisa (chief of everything!), Aidins (our partner in crime behind the numbers!), Sameer (deep diver & all around knower of everything) and Sylvia (creative extraordinaire!) - your ingenuity, passion, and relentless spirit have been the beacon in this exhilarating adventure. To my favorite partner in crime – (KVP) Kay Van-Petersen – well, thank goodness I’ll still see you around all the time, even if we aren’t driving this venture together anymore! KVP will continue the D•Central journey, with a keen focus on its innovation sauce, global macro + crypto strategy across companies, ventures & the wealth management space. And here, with a heart brimming with pride and eyes alight with new dreams, as I prepare for a new chapter, I’m enormously proud of what we’ve built with spectacular people across the globe, and the AI-readiness we’ve inspired. A lot of that work will continue in a new adventure and direction that has unfurled for me with an exciting new company. What can I say – it was love at first sight with this new chapter – but I’ll still continue to build our tech-powered futures with groundbreaking work from the new spaceship. For those who have come to love our AI Primer events, never fear! I’ll take a short rest, but they will soon unfurl under the new banner and with renewed excitement. The upcoming chapter of my journey, while shrouded in a veil of mystery at the moment, is full of boundless growth and excitement. So, I invite you to stay tuned, stay engaged, and join me as we continue to sculpt the narrative of tomorrow, with bold strokes, unwavering passion, and a sprinkle of mischief. The only hint one gets is that its heavily coated with something that starts with a “T” and ends with “echnology” and plays into being a geek at heart. To the adventures that await, Dominique Rose Van-Winther\n\nI love this chart because it resets the bullsh*t radar. Investors are impressed by irrelevant status badges. Founders brag about logos that don’t prove what they think. Of course this is historical data but you can see clear trends in this data of the backgrounds of $billion founders from Endeavor. If you don’t come from a fancy background, look at what many of these founders actually had in common: 🧳 Moved to country they founded their company. 🚀Worked at another startup 1st. 🔬Studied science > business. 🎁 Product/engineering roles. ✈️ Worked or studied abroad. And the obvious one… 2️⃣ Founded another company 1st. We all work on heuristics and I hope this chart makes you rethink yours. Some of you may realise what you thought was a weakness is actually a strength! And those of you with MBB, big bank or big tech backgrounds then take it as a challenge to add some more lines to this chart! Our heuristics are based on the loudest founders which aren’t representative of the overall sample. It’s why I love being someone’s first interview! What surprises you most about this chart? Tag someone who it will give a boost to. Would love for a UK/Europe version of this - Extend Ventures? 👀\n\nWhat we built at Cybrary wasn’t easy. In the early days, we heard our fair share of standoffish comments like, “oh, that’s cute, but you’re never going to make any money,”, “this is a terrible idea”, and “sorry but you just don’t have the talent on the team to pull this off”. We were ambitious people in a world of naysayers. Six months ago, I parted ways with the company I joined in October 2015 as employee number 2. I dedicated nearly a decade of my professional career to working alongside the co-founders, building it into one of the industry's leading companies. While we didn't achieve the big exit we hoped for, I can confidently say we created something incredible. The company stood for change in an industry stuck in its old ways, and we opened the door to something new. We knew it was going to be hard, that the odds were stacked against us. We didn’t have the typical background of a tech startup team, and we operated with little to no money most of the time. Everyone kept telling us how hard it was going to be. And you know what? It was hard. Like really, really hard. Despite reading and listening to everything about building a startup, we still made every mistake in the book. Why? Because startups are hard. For the vast majority, it requires years of long hours, emotional turmoil and uncertainty. There is so much to learn, and the ease with which one simple decision can become a massive mistake cannot be overstated. All the books, blogs, and podcasts glorify success, showcasing the survivorship bias of those who have figured it out. It leaves you feeling incredibly distraught. You sit and read (or listen) and wonder why this seems so simple for everyone else. It’s a “sex sells” situation, and for most founders (probably 99%), it doesn’t come easy. For us, amidst a sea (or perhaps ocean) of mistakes, we managed to find some success. Perhaps it was just dumb luck, but we found a way to make it work. The business found that ever-elusive bit of traction and it was off to the races. Reflecting on our journey, we often laugh about all the things we wish we had known: how to acquire customers, build a community, create a brand, value-sell, retain customers, build a team, grow a company, and fundraise—the list goes on. The time, money, and sleepless nights we could have saved, how different things might have turned out. Now speaking regularly with other founders and business owners, it turns out many find this real-world, from-the-trenches information more useful than we thought. That's why we've launched k.factor, to help early-stage tech businesses craft and navigate go-to-market strategies. To provide the knowledge, insights, and coaching we learned the hard way. The type of stuff we wish we had when building our business. If you're an early-stage founder, looking for some help, feel free to reach out. We'd love to discuss the challenges you're facing and how we can help.\n\nEgg tended break . 😉 Yes, folks that's right, I had a longer than normal Easter break and it was the best thing I've done for my business since I started 18 months ago. Truth be told, yes I did think about all the actions I could be taking but I just didn't go there. I saw one too many tragedies sadly over the Easter break to be thankful for being given precious time with our nearest and dearest. 🐣 So now that's the chicks have hatched and are off to school, mother hen is #backtobusiness. #Q2 will be tough like all previous ones and #bringiton, because the purpose, passion and energy will make us push harder and further as it always does.
