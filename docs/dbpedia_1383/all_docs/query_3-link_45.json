Reverend Norman Thomas was scheduled to return to Rutgers for his annual sermon. Thomas, a well-known socialist leader, was expected to give his usual discourse on the faults of the American democratic system. The Reverend was respected, but was known to sometimes anger students with his anti-American viewpoints. Everyone \"on the banks\" that Saturday expected the next day's events to be quite uneasy, to say the least.\n\nSunday, December 7, 1941, came and went. Three days later, President Clothier appealed to the student body. He pleaded with students to be patient, continue to attend classes and not act prematurely. He advised his students not to succumb to the fervor of volunteerism and continue their education. Uncle Sam would not call for them until the time was right. Sadly, his own son, Arthur Wilson Clothier, would die in aviation cadet training only two months later.\n\nRutgers changed dramatically after December 7, 1941. The war affected the entire community and forced an institution of higher learning to evolve into a wartime establishment. The next issue of the Targum on Saturday, December 13, reported preliminary air raid defense plans and called for students to be on alert. It was later discovered that within the first week of America's involvement, Rutgers had already lost two alumni to the war effort. Lieutenant Frank Joseph Holden, a young Marine aviator, died at Wake Island shortly after Pearl Harbor was attacked. Corporal Richard W. Hartman died in the bombing of Manila on December 13. More than two hundred other Rutgers alumni would not return home from World War II.\n\nA\n\nPlatt Adams, Jr. '46\n\n(b. October 29, 1923, Newark, NJ-d.

His unit saw action at the Vosges Mountains and participated in a counteroffensive against German forces in that area. In his last letter home, dated the day before his death, Philip wrote:\n\n\"I spent New Year's day in an all but demolished French town. High Mass at noon brought forth everyone left. The people looked pathetic as they came down the narrow village street already overburdened with Army trucks, jeeps, tanks, and guns and filled with sweating G.I.'s. Their clothes were old but intact, and their half-demolished church stood bravely against the winter sky. And the sound of their singing filled the cold, frosty air, making an atmosphere of tragedy and hope it will be hard to forget.\"\n\nHe died shortly after writing this letter. While searching for a missing patrol, Philip crossed into enemy territory and was killed in action. His decorations included the Bronze Star for meritorious service and the Silver Star for gallantry.\n\nBernard Jacob Basch '44\n\n(b. August 20, 1921, Hillside, NJ-d.

His decorations included the Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters.\n\nUpdate: In September 2006, the Rutgers Oral History Archives received the following information from Chris Argent of Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England. Mr. Argent has conducted research into the crash of First Lieutenant Jack Wendell Collins' Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress for almost fifteen years. His research included interviews with the co-pilot, Robert J. Doran, and family members of those who lost their lives in that tragic accident on the morning of Saturday, January 6, 1945. What follows is a summary of Mr. Argent's research:\n\n\"This B-17 and her crew belonged to the 94th Bomb Group, 410th Bombardment Squadron, and was based at Bury St. Edmunds (Rougham) Airfield. The target for that day was Kaiserslautern, in Germany. This was to be at least the crew's eighteenth mission out of a combat tour of thirty-five missions. It is possible that, being a pilot, Jack could have flown a few more by this time.\n\nThe aircraft sped down the runway, with six one-thousand-pound bombs onboard and with a full fuel load. Just after the wheels had left the ground, the number four engine failed. Unable to climb and with a farmhouse directly in their flight path, First Lieutenant Jack Collins and his co-pilot, Second Lieutenant Robert J. Doran, diverted the doomed B-17 to the right, narrowly missing the farmhouse and its occupants. Crashing into a small wooded copse, the B-17 came to a stop, digging into the ground and breaking in half. Fire then engulfed the aircraft and surrounding area. The time was 8:15 AM and five of the nine-man crew were already dead.\n\nThe remaining four crew members fought to get out of the aircraft. The co-pilot, amazingly, had survived. Though he had suffered broken bones, burns and been temporarily blinded by fuel, he just stepped out of the badly mangled cockpit onto the ground. The nose of the B-17 had completely buried itself into the ground. The other survivors were the waist gunner, the ball-turret gunner and the tail gunner. Just after the four survivors had escaped, at least three of the one-thousand-pound bombs exploded, sending parts of the B-17 and debris over a two-mile area. Bits landed where the crews' quarters were.\n\nThough the farmhouse was badly damaged by the blast, only minor injuries occurred. The survivors were quickly picked up and taken to hospital. None of these airmen flew during World War II again.\n\nAs sad as this crash was, it did not end there. During the course of my research, it was discovered that the navigator who died in this crash, Second Lieutenant Gordon F. Henry, was from a different crew, as Jack Collins navigator was ill and could not fly on this mission. Also, about two or three years after the end of World War II, the tail gunner, Sergeant Cecil H. Schermerhorn, was killed in a car crash with his family. After being blinded by oncoming headlights, his car smashed into a bridge. At the moment, I am still trying to locate where this happened and where Sergeant Schermerhorn was buried. The other survivor, Sergeant Ony M. Carrico, the ball-turret gunner, if still alive, is now the only crew member left.\n\nAt the scene of the crash, there are two craters left. The smaller one is where the nose buried into the ground and the larger one is where the bomb bay area was. This is about seven-feet deep and over fifty feet across. The rest of the area is surrounded by trees and housing. Also, next to the crash site, there is a Community Centre; in there is a room named after the B-17 (Mission Mistress). The crew in this crash will not be forgotten.\n\nAbout twenty-eight miles west of Bury St. Edmunds, just outside Cambridge, is the American Military Cemetery at Madingley. It is here that First Lieutenant Jack W. Collins, Second Lieutenant Gordon F. Henry and Sergeant Clinton R. Hallman, Jr., are buried. Staff Sergeant James F. Tate (top turret gunner/engineer) and Sergeant Raymond J. Von Bokel (radio operator) are buried in Louisville, Kentucky, in a joint grave.\n\nThe crew of Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress 42-97082 Mission Mistress:\n\nFirst Lieutenant Jack W. Collins, Pilot.
