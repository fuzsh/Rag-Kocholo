        "text": "The key to longevity, Mike Wenzel will tell you, is to never quit.\n\n“If you really like something, from the time you start into whatever direction you think you are going, don’t give up on that direction,” he said. “Go with it. Give it a good honest chance. You might surprise yourself.”\n\nThat is common sense advice from someone who has worn many hats during his life and worn them well. The 72-year-old spent more than 30 years as a football official and more than 30 years as a physical education teacher in Milwaukee Public Schools.\n\nAnd for the past 60 years he has worked in various capacities at South Stadium, the last 50 as the facility’s stadium manager or assistant stadium manager.\n\nHe estimates he has worked about 1,200 games over the years at the stadium on the near south side of Milwaukee. With that run, Wenzel has to be one of the longest-tenured employees in the district. Probably outside the district, too. How many people do you know who can say they’ve worked 60 years in one place?\n\nThe district surprised him by honoring him at halftime of the final football game of season at the stadium earlier this month. The guy who is supposed to know everything that is happening inside South Stadium was caught off-guard.\n\n“I am amazed,” he said. “I look around here always. I’ve seen the old place and now I’ve seen the new place and you think of all the people who have come through here. &mldr; You look around and see things that have happened over the years.”\n\nWenzel is one of the heroes of high school sports that we never hear about.\n\nThe games don't just happen. Someone has to make sure the officials are hired and that there is a public-address announcer. What kind of game would we have without the chain crew? Where would you get your snacks if the concessions stand isn’t open? Who makes sure the lights come on and the bathrooms are open?\n\nWenzel has handled that and more over the years. Even in his current role as the assistant stadium manager, his list of duties is long.\n\n“The old guy handles the football operation and the good (young) guy, who can run around this place, handles everything else that is going around,” Wenzel joked.\n\nWorking the sidelines\n\nLike most great opportunities, Wenzel’s started with being in the right place at the right time. He was attending junior high school and his gym teacher, the stadium manager at the time, hired him to work with the chain crew.\n\nFrom there he worked the scoreboard in the days when it took three people to run it.\n\n“You had to have a guy on the field with a microphone set up because you only had little wooden windows you couldn’t see out of,” Wenzel recalled. “He had to tell the down, what yard line, how many yards to go.\n\n“We did that job next. Then we graduated to being the guy on the field telling them. Then we got old enough to do tickets and security. By the time we’d got through the middle 70s, you’d done all the jobs.”\n\nWell, almost every job.\n\nThe one he didn’t do was was the PA announcer. He was set to have that role in 1975 when his old gym teacher, the stadium manager, died and MPS commissioner Jack Takerian needed a replacement.\n\nHe turned to Wenzel.\n\n“He said I’m going to give you three years probation as stadium manager and after three games the three-year probation was gone and I was the manager permanently,” Wenzel said.\n\nThe job fit seamlessly with the rest of his life. He taught at nearby Allen-Field Elementary and was able to work his schedule so he could continue officiating games.\n\n“It was the perfect teaching location. I could keep coming here and keep doing this,\" he said. “I wasn’t going to leave anyway. I would have volunteered to rip tickets if I had to.”\n\nWitnessed golden era of City football\n\nWorking at South Stadium gave Wenzel a front-row seat to the golden era of City football when crowds would pack the stands so tightly that standing-room-only tickets were sold.\n\nBut he also saw the once majestic facility crumble to the point that it wasn’t salvageable. Rather than renovate, the stadium, which opened in 1927, was demolished and a new facility built on that spot.\n\n“I cried when they tore it down,” Wenzel said. “I loved that red brick and at least for the 40-50 years I was here it stood very well with the repairs they were doing.\n\n“But all at once, it’s like me trying to walk around after my MRI. It’s got old.”\n\nThe red brick that once made up South Stadium is gone. The concrete and brick bleachers that lined the sidelines have been replaced by metal ones. The worn grass has made way for a synthetic surface, and the track used to surround the field is no more.\n\nWenzel, however, is still going at it, and he hopes to stick around for a few more years at least.\n\n“I want to make it to 2025 because that will be 50 years as a stadium manager and then I might slow down,” he said."
