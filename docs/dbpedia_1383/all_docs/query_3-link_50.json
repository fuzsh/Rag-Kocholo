        "text": "Some things change, some things remain the same.\n\nWith the New Jersey high school baseball season scheduled to leave the starting gate on Monday, Steinert High is once again the team to beat. It’s been that way for a long, long time. The biggest change is the Spartans have a new head coach, Brian Giallella, son of legendary skipper Rich, who retired at the conclusion of the 2000 season to become the school’s athletic director.\n\nHamilton High, knee deep in returning veterans, won the Valley Division of the Colonial Valley Conference last season, but this time around will be competing in the Colonial Division, taking dead aim at township rival Steinert and eager to win its second successive state Group III title.\n\nEarly word is Hightstown is loaded and ready to bounce back from last season’s horrendous 6-14 record. Nottingham must find someone to replace pitching ace Mark Conklin, who won seven games last season. West Windsor-South and Lawrence approach the season optimistically, while Trenton will play musical chairs while striving to find a winning combination.\n\nHere’s an overall view of the teams who will be competing for the Colonial Division pennant:\n\nHAMILTON\n\nCOACH: Jim Maher (6th Season)\n\nASSISTANT COACHES: John Costantino, Tommy Carr, Matt Hamilton, Mike Giambelluca, Tom Brettell.\n\n2000 RECORD: 26-5 (Won Valley Division, captured Group III state championship).\n\nKEY PLAYERS LOST: James Hoey (Rider), Matt Giannacio (Kean), Pat Zegarski (Mercer County Community College).\n\n2001 ROSTER: Jeff Iorio (Jr. p), John Leonardo (Sr., p, of), Mark Pienciak (Sr. 3b), Kevin Loretucci (Sr., p), Pat Sharples (Soph., p), Jason Brenner (Sr., p), Colin Wood (Jr., p), Matt Pizza (Jr., p), Tom Paglione (Fr, p), Frank Bisanzio (Sr., c), Tom Metzler (Jr., c-of), Mike Falchi (Jr., lb), Scott Brettell (Jr., 2b), Dennis Alexander (Fr., 2b), Nick Massari (Jr., ss), Scott Senese (Sr., of), Mike Papp (Jr., of), Steve Rinz (Soph., of).\n\nSolid up the middle, the Hornets may have the most gifted shortstop in the conference in junior Massari, who batted .366 last season, had 34 hits and scored 38 runs.\n\n“If we are to be successful,”coach Maher pointed out, “Mark Pienciak, John Leonardo and Frank Bisanzio must hit. And our young kids must step up.\n\n“We won’t have one dominate pitcher, like we did last season (when James Hoey won a Mercer County record 13 games), but we do seem to have five or six quality kids. Pitching is going to be by committee.”\n\nSenior outfielder Senese, who batted .327 last season while nailing down a berth on The Trentonian’s All-CVC first team, should be a solid force while Falchi has transferred in from McCorristin to add a big bat to the lineup.\n\nIf the hitting can carry the pitching, especially early on in the season, the Hornets appear destined for another successful year.\n\nSTEINERT\n\nCOACH: Brian Giallella (1st Season)\n\nASSISTANT COACHES: Frank Gatto, Mike Hastings, Ron Yacyk.\n\n2000 RECORD: 30-2. Won Colonial Division, captured Group IV state championship).\n\nKEY PLAYERS LOST: Scott Rich (Rider), Joe Hernandez (Mercer County Community College), Steve Fischer.\n\n2001 ROSTER: Michael Rogers (Sr., p), Chris Neylan (Sr., p), Frank Sabatino (Sr., p), Matt Sweeney (Sr., p), Matt Perks (Soph, p), Bill Seiler (Sr., c), Jordan McCreedy (Soph., c), Mike DeRose (Jr., c), Paul Bencivengo (Sr., 2b), Dan Sczweck (Jr., 3b), John Kokotajlo (Sr., ss), Mick Dawidowski (Jr., if), Mike Costello (Sr., of), Eric Croux (Sr. of), Mike Carney (Soph, of), Joe D’Andrea (Soph., of), Anthony Proietti (Jr. of), Pat Rose (Sr., of).\n\nOverpowering pitching stamps this Steinert team as potentially one of the best in the state. Seniors Rogers, Neylan, Sabatino, Sweeney and newcomer Perks, a 10th grader, give the Spartans a mound staff second to none.\n\nOutfielder Mike Costello, who batted .423 in 2000, second baseman Paul Bencivengo, coming off a super .389 season and Bob Ziegler, who batted .311 and blasted five home runs, provide offensive punch.\n\nKokotajlo is being asked to fill the large shoes of graduated shortstop Joe Hernendez, while Sczweck will anchor the infield at third base. The left side of the infield is new and untested.\n\n“We just have to go out there and play Steinert baseball,” feels first year coach Giallella. “Our pitching should carry us, but we have to do the routine things, move runners, make the double play, hit the cutoff man, all the little things necessary for a successful season.\n\n“I’m pleased with what I have seen so far. Now I’m just anxious to get going, get the season underway,” said Giallella, who will hand the ball to Rogers on Monday when the Spartans debut at the Lawrenceville School.\n\nWEST WINDSOR-SOUTH\n\nCOACH: Dave Hutchinson (6th Season)\n\n2000 RECORD: 14-9 (Second in Colonial Division)\n\nKEY PLAYERS LOST: Brad Kirkpatrick (Drew), Brian Hollows (Peddie), Joel Hight.\n\n2001 ROSTER: Justin Muir (Jr., p, of), Rob Tabler (Sr., p, of), Keith Cross (Sr., p, lb, of), Rich Gawlak (Soph, c), Gabe Alonso (Soph., p, of), Tim Woodhull (Soph., 2b), Kyle Hutchinson (Sr., 2b), J. T. Hutchinson (Soph., p, 2b), Matt Hunter (Sr., 3b), Ted King (Soph., 3b), Justin Kelemen (Sr., ss, p), Evan Cheresnick (Fr., p), Brian Zurich (Sr., of), Dan Portnoy (Jr., of), Sean Edwards (Jr., of), Jeff Patterson (Jr., of, p), Chris Wade (Sr., of), Jeff Fisher (Soph., of, p).\n\n“We are a young team, but do have a nice blend of returning seniors,” noted veteran coach Hutchinson. Seven seniors, six sophomores, four juniors and a freshman will be ready to represent the Pirates when the season gets underway next week.\n\n“In fact, this is the youngest team I’ve ever had,” said Hutch.\n\nMuir and Tabler will do the brunt of the pitching, withCross, when not at first base or in the outfield, slated to do his share of the hurling.\n\nKelemen brings experience to the shortstop slot, while the Pirates have a solid performer at second base in Kyle Hutchinson, coming off a campaign during which he batted .309. Pushing Kyle will be his younger brother, J. T., a sophomore. Yes, Kyle and J. T. are the sons of head coach Don.\n\n“I’m working with a good group of kids,” Don pointed out. “They are eager to learn and optimistic about the upcoming season.”\n\nTRENTON\n\nCOACH: Frank Partyka (16th Season)\n\nASSISTANT COACH: Dom Lombardo\n\n2000 RECORD: 5-20 (6th in Colonial Division)\n\n2001 ROSTER: Joe McKinney (Sr., p, lb), Carlos Lugo (Sr., of), Aion Hearns (Sr., p, c, 3b), Julio DeJesus (Jr., p, dh),, Tyreese Drummer (Soph., p, ss, of), Jose Gomez (Soph., p, 3b), Josh Santiago (Fr., p, ss), Jose Colon (Soph., p, dh), Anthony Mose (Jr., p, of), James Brantley (Jr., p).\n\nThe bad news at THS is that four sophomores are academically ineligible and three of them would have been in the Tornadoes starting lineup.\n\nFive starters from last year’s team, however, are back in the fold, including first baseman-pitcher McKinney, senior outfielder Lugo, who will captain the team, and Jose Gomez, the club’s most experienced pitcher, who will be at third base when not on the mound. Gomez batted .400 last season for a THS team that won only five games.\n\n“Pitching is going to be the key,” noted coach Partyka, as he heads into his 16th season. “People must step up and do the job on the mound.” Gomez looms as the No. 1 hurler and he will be tossing to Aion Hearns, the likely starter behind the plate.\n\nAs in the recent past, it will be musical chairs time at THS, if the starting pitcher fails to do the job. Almost every player on the team can play another position, so Partyka will be moving players as if in a chess game, trying to find a winning combination.\n\nHIGHTSTOWN\n\nCOACH: John Mariano (12th Season)\n\nASSISTANT COACHES: Brian Lemke, Matt Bruh, Scott Kercher\n\n2000 RECORD: 6-14 (5th in Colonial Division)\n\nKEY PLAYERS LOST: Tom Hopkins, Dale Scherholz.\n\n2001 ROSTER: Shaun Byrne (Sr., p), Bret Rodgers (Sr., p), Steve Sikorski (Sr., p), Paul Reyes (Jr., p), Nick Kenny (Jr., p), Paul Canciello (Sr., c), Adam Levinson (Jr., c), Chris Gully (Jr., c), Brendan Awerback (Jr., c, if), Brian Pramberger (Sr., 2b), John Nini (Sr., ss), Brandon Lugannani (Jr., 3b), Eric Levine (Sr., of), Greg Milesnick (Jr., of), Craig Hopkins (Jr., of), Tim Decker (Sr., of),Mike Liland (Jr., of).\n\nThe Rams took their lumps last season, now they plan to administer a few. Especially with their two top pitchers returning. In fact, seven of the nine starters are returning players.\n\n“All of our pitchers are back,” happily noted Mariano. “The keys are Bret Rodgers and Steve Sikorski. If they can do the job, we will go far.”\n\nRodgers was 1-2 last season, suffering from a shoulder injury that limited his appearances. But he is coming off a good summer of American Legion baseball.\n\nSikorski is a hard thrower who is being counted on to both start and close.\n\nToss in veteran hurler Byrne and the Rams may have three hurlers capable of keeping them in the pennant race.\n\nBehind the plate will be a capable catcher in Canciello, who is also a consistent threat at the plate. Nini has a year of experience under his belt and will be a fixture at the shortstop position.\n\nLAWRENCE\n\nCOACH: Brian Carter (2nd Season)\n\nASSISTANT COACH: Mike Piepszak\n\n2000 RECORD: 9-15 (4th in Colonial Division)\n\nKEY PLAYERS LOST: Eric Weiner (Rider), Bob Brundage (Mercer County Community College), Jason Smith.\n\n2001 ROSTER: Kevin Schneider (Jr., p), Tim Wenczel (Sr., p), Carl Holmquist (Sr., p), Kyle Anderson (Sr., p), C. J. Hendricks (Sr., c), Devin Naar (Sr., c), Brian Bunn (Jr., 2b), Mike Cacciabaudo (Jr., 3b), Mike Bruschini (Jr., ss), Chad Durling (Sr., of), Bill Allegra (Sr., of), Armondo Rosario (Sr., of), Steve Thomas (Jr., of), John Im (Sr., of).\n\nHeading into his second season, coach Carter has a better understanding of the Colonial Valley Conference this second around. Not that it is going to be any easier chalking up victories.\n\n“We lost several seniors through graduation, so we will be a relatively young team,” Carter quickly pointed out. “Our chances for success hinge on how quickly these young players mature. Obviously, there will be a number of young men getting their first varsity experience, so we can’t expect miracles.”\n\nKevin Schneider heads a mound staff that includes seniors Wenczel and Holmquist, neither of whom have varsity experience, and Kyle Anderson, who was good in relief last season, but now will be handed some starting assignments.\n\nC. J. Hendricks will be behind the plate and there will be a number of no names penciled into other starting positions. No names that hope to become\n\nSee “COLONIAL” p.33"
