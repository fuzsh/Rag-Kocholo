        "text": "Milwaukee places second at Vic Godfrey Open\n\nKENOSHA, Wis. – The Milwaukee men's cross country team opened the 2021 season at the Vic Godfrey Open, finishing second out of five teams Friday evening at the Wayne E. Dannehl Cross Country Course.\n\nThe Panthers finished with 51 points, placing a pair of runners inside the top 10. Lewis placed all five scorers inside the top 10 to score 23 points and win the meet.\n\nSenior Trevor Wenzel paced the team with a time of 18:42.2 for a fourth-place finish. Sophomore Brandon O'Hara followed close behind for an eighth-place finish with a time of 19:04.1.\n\nJunior Aidan Sodemann (19:13.4) and senior Corey Thornton (19:17.3) were consecutive finishers for MKE, placing 12th and 13th respectively. Junior Ian Nadolski (19:21.5) crossed the line four seconds later to finish 15th and round of the scoring.\n\nFive more Panthers finished in the top third of competitors, including six straight starting with senior Michael Sippy (19:26.9) at 17th. Sophomore John Roth (19:27.8), making his cross country debut, tallied an 18th-place finish.\n\n\"Coach Reilly did a great job getting out men and women both physically ready and mentally ready to run on a grass course for the first time in two years for many of them,\" head coach Andrew Basler said. \"There was a lot of execution that we focused on for this meet as opposed to the end result to be more prepared for the meets that come in October\"\n\nMilwaukee returns to the course in a week at the Jaguar Invite in Carmel, Ind. hosted by IUPUI. It will be a preview of the Horizon League Championship course, as the Panthers will return on October 30.\n\n\"Some of our athletes have not had a chance to run on that course,\" said Basler. \"It will be a great experience to get a feel of the course before we head there again in October.\"\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
