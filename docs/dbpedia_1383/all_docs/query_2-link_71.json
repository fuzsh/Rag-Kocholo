        "text": "Memorial Services for Janetta Wenzel will take place on Saturday, May 6, 2023 at 1:00 p.m. at Roy-Hetland Funeral Home in Osakis, with Reverend John Martinson officiating. A public visitation will be held one hour prior to services from 12:00-1:00 p.m.\n\nJanetta Joyce Stimson was born to Everett and Gladys (Olson) Stimson on January 24, 1943 in Staples, Minnesota. She was one of four children born into the family that would eventually relocate to Sauk Center, where Janetta would finish out her schooling, graduating with the class of 1961. When Janetta was 3 years old her father passed away and the family would eventually welcome their step-father, Elwood Grove. As a child and young woman Janetta loved the family farm and spending time with her animals and being out in nature. She took delight in caring for her horses, and her favorite childhood dog “Wolf.”\n\nAfter graduating high school, Janetta longed to attend college to become a veterinarian, but because this was not an option for many women in the 60’s, she settled for cosmetology school. After completing her schooling, Janetta worked a variety of jobs, many of them involving managing resorts in the Osakis area. While at the local ballroom, Janetta met the love of her life, Freelyn Carl Wenzel Jr., and the two were married on August 30, 1965. Together the couple ran Freelyn’s family farm and raised their three sons: Erik, Karl, and Bill. Janetta loved farm life, especially her horses and her dogs – both the big and little ones. When the couple were ready to retire, they passed the family farm onto their grandson and moved to Parkers Prairie.\n\nJanetta enjoyed many hobbies. She like fishing, drawing and painting, gardening, and watching the birds. She was also a skilled musician, playing the guitar, keyboard, piano, organ, and the occasional accordion. Before her mother’s passing, Janetta enjoyed going to local nursing homes with Gladys and playing for the elderly.\n\nJanetta loved her mornings and the first cup of hot coffee, even though she would drink it all day, hot or not. In November of 2022 Janetta moved to St. William’s Living Center in Parkers Prairie, shortly before the passing of her husband Freelyn. And while Janetta’s health was declining, she passed away unexpectedly on April 27, 2023 in Parkers Prairie; she was 80 years old.\n\nLeft to cherish Janetta’s memory are her sons: Erik of Henning, Karl (Susan) of Garfield, and Bill (Melissa) of Long Prairie; 10 grandchildren; 9 great-grandchildren; one brother, Gerald Stimson; as well as many beloved cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends. She is preceded in death by her husband of 57 years, Freelyn Wenzel; her parents, Everett Stimson, and Gladys and Elwood Grove; daughter-in-law, Colene Wenzel; grandson, Ryan Richner; brother, Wayne (Bernie) Stimson; sister, Audrey (Harold) Douvier, sister-in-law, Jackie Stimson; and nephew, Ty Atterbury."
