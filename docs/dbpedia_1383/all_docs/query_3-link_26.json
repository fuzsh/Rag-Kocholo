        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nI’m quite the fan of Ian Fleming’s James Bond; 007. That’s the character of books, radio shows, comics, and of course feature films. Often much is made about that number with two zeros and seven. In Die Another Day Pierce Brosnan’s Bond utters the line, “It’s only a number…” Similarly in the most recent film, Daniel Craig states, that the 007 is “just a number.”\n\nSince the end of 2019 our club, the United German Hungarians has been making a lot of reference and waiting to celebrate, well, a number; 110. I’m not going to rehash the reasons why we’ve been waiting, by now we all know, and I also have made a personal decision that this sentence will be the last reference I make in any writing to the debacle that came from a Chinese virus.\n\nWhat do those lines from Bond mean? How are they relevant to the German Hungarians?\n\nWell, James Bond is agent code named 007, and to many that 007 means something, but it has meaning because of the man behind the number.\n\nI feel the same about 110. We pride ourselves in the history of our club. To be over one hundred years old is an accomplishment and we never shy away from a reason to have a party and celebrate. But that number, 110, it has meaning for us like one hundred did 11 years ago. It has meaning not just because it’s a big number. It has meaning because of the individuals, the families, and the club that is 110 years old. Yes, our history is important, and it guides us, yes, we should and have celebrated anniversaries, but most important is the club, and the people that make it up.\n\nOn Saturday, October 23, we held our Gala 110th Anniversary, at the Cannstatter V.V. The event put on display and gathered together the things and the people that make the number 110 have meaning at all. It was easy also to see the threads and materials of our future success in the many aspects of our club life in action that evening. What follows is a review of the event written in sections by Karina Fricker and I.\n\nMichael N. Fricker\n\nSOUVENIR ANNIVERSARY BOOK\n\nA number of years ago our leaders made a decision that every 5 years our club would compile, print, and publish a souvenir anniversary book. We have a rich history of putting together these materials and each one is unique to its time. In 2010 our 100th anniversary book was the last to be printed in black & white and featured one hundred years of written history for the first time ever.\n\nIn 2015-2016 (due to a reschedule because of a snowstorm) we held the 50th Anniversary of our Cultural Group and also printed the first full color book chronicling the history of our dance groups.\n\nThen in 2020 we printed our 110th Anniversary book covering this anniversary and including the history since we finished our centennial in 2010. The cover is a modern take on covers we have had in the past. Again, the full color copy has a variety of photos of our members, dance groups, soccer teams, lists of our achievements, award winners, a letter from the president and an abundance of other features.\n\nEmily Fricker taught us that these published books, and the 110th one is no exception, are not “ad books,” or mere “event programs,” they are pieces of history, printed examples of who we are.\n\nIf you could not attend, you can see a digital version by clicking here.\n\n-M\n\nCOCKTAIL HOUR & MEMORABELIA\n\nThere’s just “something” about putting on your best attire and having a cocktail, don’t you think? The cocktail hour started at 6pm, and as members and friends arrived, the excitement in the air was palpable. Imagine walking through the long hallway of the entrance at the Cannstatter Volksfest Verein, making your way to the Main Ballroom, greeting friends, finding your table, and finally getting that first beverage of the night. Smiles were seen on guests of all ages. As you entered, to the left was a large display of German Hungarian memorabilia. Displayed on these tables were soccer and dance trophies and awards, accomplishments from years past. Next you saw a large television displaying photos, old and new. Many stories and laughs were shared watching this and it was a perfect way to remember our past and celebrate it. Mens and Womens Soccer uniforms were up for all to see. Our German Hungarian tracht, Banater and Bavarian, were displayed as well. We are proud of our history and look forward to our future.\n\nSpecial thank you to all of our members who helped make this display as beautiful and intricate as it was.\n\n-K\n\nEHRENWÜRDIG AWARDS\n\nThe names and bios below are the dedicated members who received the Ehrenwürdig Award.

Congratulations!\n\n-K\n\nATMOSPHERE OF FRIENDS\n\nI’ve written once before about the affection of our people for “suiting up,” for dinner jackets, and donning of gowns all in atmospheric halls filled with smiles and music.\n\nOur 110th Banquet, had all of that and more. Even the tiniest of members, with the biggest of personalities looked the business that elegant evening. The members of our Children’s Cultural Group are a spirited, sometimes mischievous, but true-blue group of friends. It’s an honor for us to have each of them as members of our club and I look forward to seeing their already burgeoning loyalty to each other age into a steadfast dedication to club-life and family.\n\nAll ages could be found on the dance floor socially the night of the event, thanks in huge part to our Heimatklänge. This band as an institution is our ever-frequent collaborator in the fun times of our events. The atmosphere of any affair we have is always heightened with their inclusion. More so than that the men of the band itself are each one a part of the German Hungarians.\n\nOf course, we were joined by friends from the local German-American clubs. What we do as an organization we hope provides an enjoyable time to our fellow clubs. Friends traveled as well from other states nearby and not so nearby and we are always happy when they do so.\n\nFor many years, the emblem of the United German Hungarians of Philadelphia & Vicinity as well as the Banater Männerchor before that included the image of shaking hands. Still today that emblem of the original club is woven into the fabric of our beautiful club flag. That flag served as the backdrop for many family photos taken the night of the 110th.\n\nI know that as we move forward all of our German Hungarians will continue the tradition of extending our hands in friendship as we have since the year 1910.\n\n-M\n\nDANCE PERFORMANCES\n\nThe German Hungarians love to dance. So much so, that we prepared an extensive performance to showcase our abilities and inspire a sentimental feeling in our guests, members, and even ourselves. The dances that were chosen by Alex Blank, Marlene Fricker, and I were as follows:\n\nKovorovska Polka: This polka was choreographed by Marlene Fricker in conjunction with our 100th Anniversary in 2010, and first performed at the Landestreffen der Donauschwaben in Oakford. This is a dance filled with power and energy, starting at the center back of the dance floor-with our HK behind us- and taking off. Our dancers have known it by heart since we first learned it over 10 years ago. It’s a piece of music and a dance that has turned into a core memory for us and elicits such a feeling of pride. We hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed performing it.\n\nBöhmischer Traum: A beautiful piece of music, this song, translated into “Bohemian Dream,” was choreographed by Marlene Fricker for this event. We were immediately excited by the version of the song by Meeblech. It has multiple timing and style changes and gives the dance and the song a lot of character. This dance takes many shapes on the floor, and is edgy, yet classic.\n\nCzardas: The Hungarian Czardas has become a staple for the German Hungarian Dance Group. A czardas is a Hungarian dance to music in duple time in which the dancers start slowly and finish with a rapid whirl. It is another dance that each of us knows by heart, but each time it is performed it is still as exciting and new as the first time it was learned. Our Heimatklänge leads this dance for us as well and makes it even more special. The footwork is sharp and together. Kicks, swivels, stamps, claps, and a lift at the end.\n\nUrlauber Polka: Originally choreographed by Josef Wenczel, this dance was adapted from our friends from Hungary. An epic polka, it is fast, technical, and powerful. This was the most difficult dance we learned for our 110th anniversary. This dance also makes many shapes across the floor. Starting diagonally, it moves into lines, into a circle formation, back into lines, and ends in a U shape. This dance became a project for us, striving to make it as clean and precise as possible. “Urlauber” may translate to “vacation,” but it sure took a lot of hard work and dedication to complete, and we are so proud of how it turned out.\n\nBis Bald Auf Wiedersehen: The German Hungarians can sing! A popular song and dance in the Donauschwaben culture, we decided to put our own twist on this song. This piece, also choreographed by Marlene Fricker, is the perfect way to say goodbye. Short and sweet, we sang “Bis Bald,” or “See ya later,” in a line, and completed the performance.\n\n-K\n\nLANDESVERBAND AWARDS\n\nThe Landesverband der Donauschwaben USA provides awards to its member clubs that include a certificate and an accompanying gold pin. On the occasion of our 110th Anniversary five of our members were presented with this award the night of the banquet. Region Ost President, Marlene Fricker presented these awards on behalf of the Verband stating that these individuals were being recognized for their service over the years “doing whatever it was that needed to be done.” Reading the following names, it’s easy to understand the deserving nature of each and every one:\n\nSusan Hartmann\n\nJanet Fricker Malofiy\n\nJohn Reiter\n\nJoseph S. Reiter\n\nMichael Wagner\n\nCongratulations and thank you to Susi, Janet, John, Joe, and Michael for all of their service and leadership to our shared Danube Swabian-German Hungarian culture. We also thank the Landesverband for their leadership, their welcoming nature and for connecting us with likeminded folks we share a culture with across a whole nation. You can read a very well written and fitting letter from Verband President, Robert Filippi by clicking here.\n\n-M\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThere’s a song by my favorite musical artist that perfectly encaptures my feelings towards the night of our 110th Anniversary. It starts off by saying,\n\n“I said remember this moment… in the back of my mind.”\n\nFrom the cocktail hour to the last song of the night, the evening was nothing but spectacular. Let’s remember the faces, the photos, the smiles, the songs sung, the history made. Let’s hold onto the memories of years past. 110 years of trials and triumphs have brought us here, today. That is something to be proud of. We are continuing a proud tradition.\n\n“You held your head like a hero\n\nOn a history book page\n\nIt was the end of a decade\n\nBut the start of an age…”\n\nLet’s make the next 110 years as powerful and traditional as the last. Let’s hold our heads up high, and walk together towards the future. The United German Hungarians are a close-knit family unit. It is truly special to be a part of something larger than yourself, and the German Hungarians do just that and more.\n\n“Long Live, the walls we crashed through\n\nI had the time of my life, with you…”\n\n“Long Live” the German Hungarians.\n\nKarina E. Fricker\n\nSong Credit: “Long Live” by Taylor Swift\n\nThe featured image features the end of the cultural group’s performance of Böhmischer Traum the evening of the banquet. The authors of this writing felt that our young members, hand in hand, arms raised in pride was the perfect accompaniment for this review.\n\nBelow you will find various photos from the evening courtesy of many of our members and friends who shared these on social media.
