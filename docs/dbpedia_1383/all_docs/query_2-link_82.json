        "text": "Student Profile\n\nJordan Mann\n\nAge: 23\n\nYear: Senior\n\nFrom: Lovettsville, VA\n\nMajor: English Language and Literature\n\nHobbies: Spending time with my fiancée and friends, working out and fitness research, watching movies, reading\n\nWhat's your favorite class or professor? That's a hard question. Dr. John Cuddeback is an excellent teacher and I especially enjoyed his Ethics class. Dr. Adam Schwartz taught some incredible classes, especially The Inklings. I really get a kick out of Prof. Michael Brown's teaching style. But I have especially enjoyed Dr. Thomas Stanford's English classes; I've actually taken his classes seven out of my eight semesters here.\n\nWhat extra curricular activities do you participate in? I was my team's captain in this year's Dorm Wars; participating and coordinating my team in the events was fun, especially since we won. I've also taken part in intramurals, playing indoor soccer, dodgeball, and volleyball with my friends. I also spent one year singing in the choir, have served as a sacristan and altar server, and I've worked in the peer tutor Writing Center for three years.\n\nWhat's your favorite thing about Christendom? I think for me, my favorite aspect is the solid Catholic community built on an education in faith and reason. I really hold dear the relationships I've made at this place.\n\nWhy did you choose Christendom? I ultimately chose Christendom College over other college options because of the integration of faith and reason offered in the education here, as well as the strong Catholic community built on this education and common Catholic ideals.\n\nWhat surprised you the most about Christendom? The breadth of the education is impressive. It encompasses many fields in satisfying depth. I always expected I'd learn much here, but until I actually came here as a student, I was not aware of just how much there was to learn.\n\nPlans after graduation? I'll be getting married in June to my classmate, Lauren Enk, and will start working with an insurance agency, Coverage Inc., in Chantilly, Va.\n\nAny parting words of advice for prospective students? If you are interested in acquiring a fantastic education in the liberal arts, come to Christendom. Not only can you pursue a good education, but you can also do so in a supportive community that shares your goals.\n\nStudent Life\n\nBroadway in the Rotunda\n\nThe St. John the Evangelist Library held a special event, “Broadway in the Rotunda,” last Wednesday evening, April 30. Due to the popularity of “Caroling in the Rotunda” at Christmas-time, Mrs. Mickey Krebs, the Library Acquisitions Assistant, and the library staff hosted a similar event where students, faculty, and staff sang popular Broadway show songs and other fun tunes together in the library rotunda. The library staff joined students in singing tunes from the \"Sound of Music,\" \"Mary Poppins,\" \"Les Miserables,\" \"Annie,\" \"My Fair Lady,\" \"Singing in the Rain,\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\"\n\nStudents joined together to sing their favorite musical and Broadway songs!\n\nMrs. Mickey Krebs, the Library Acquisitions Assistant, and History Professor, Dr. Michael Kelly, join in the singing.\n\nSpring Formal 2014\n\nThe students of Christendom College enjoyed an elegant and fun evening of dancing on Saturday night at the school’s annual Spring Formal. This year’s dance took place at Trumpet Vine Farm, a quaint outdoor setting in Stephens City, Va., about half an hour from Christendom’s campus. The dancing took place under a pavilion covered in twinkling lights and glittering fabric. A live band played for the occasion. When students weren’t dancing, they enjoyed socializing and eating delicious food in the adjacent wide grassy space surrounded by stately old trees and a rustic outdoor fireplace. Everyone loved the atmosphere of the venue and the great music. It was a night of great fun for all.\n\nJunior John Jackson spins Maggie Ostrowski.\n\nJuniors Mike Heffernan and Karolyn Pondo are all smiles as they dance the night away.\n\nSophomore Dominic Borchers and Freshman Nicole LaRochelle share a dance.\n\nFreshmen Sarah Padgett and Luke Williams swing dance together.\n\nFreshmen Josie Ostrowski and Nick Wenzel out on the dance floor\n\nMay Crowning\n\nEvery first Sunday in May, Christendom College celebrates Mary's month by crowning her after Mass. The senior girls all place a rose in a vase at her feet, while the youngest freshman girl holds the honor of crowning her. This lovely ceremony is a beautiful way to highlight the devotion many of Christendom's students, faculty, and staff have for Our Blessed Mother, and to pay her the loving respect she is due. She will remained crowned throughout the month.\n\nFreshman Carolyn Manion crowns the statue of Mary.\n\nCheese and a Choral Performance\n\nOn Sunday evening, the men’s choral group, The Suspicious Cheese Lords, treated Christendom’s students to a heavenly performance of both Renaissance and modern classical works, including a song composed by Christendom College’s own choir director, Dr. Kurt Poterack.\n\nFreshman Clare Fletcher shared that she was thrilled with the men’s talent and pieces they chose to perform.\n\n“The performance was so cool,\" she said. \"I was very excited that they chose to perform 'Ubi Caritas' during the encore. The range of their voices was truly impressive”.\n\nAs always, those who attended thoroughly enjoyed the men’s stunning voices and look forward to their next appearance on campus. Learn more about this talented musical group HERE.\n\nSinger Clifton West shares the humorous story behind the group's unique name.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nAn Interview with a History Professor:\n\nDr. Michael Kelly\n\nIn the midst of the school's last full week of classes, Chronicler reporter Abigail C. Reimel sat down with history professor, Dr. Michael Kelly, to ask him some questions about his background and how he has enjoyed his Christendom experience so far, as he is currently completing his second year of teaching at the college.\n\nSo, Dr. Kelly, you teach history here at Christendom College, but you double majored in college. What were your areas of focus, what is your doctorate in, and why did you choose to ultimately focus on history?\n\nAs an undergraduate I majored in english and history, with a minor in medieval studies. The best teacher I had in college, a literature professor, urged me to become a historian. I followed his advice, but sometimes I envy my colleagues who get to immerse themselves deeply in the Great Books. At length, in graduate school I studied modern European history, and specialized in early modern Great Britain. My dissertation focused on the various understandings of the crime and sin of sacrilege among English protestants in the post-Reformation era.\n\nThis is your second year teaching at Christendom College. What made you join the faculty here, and how has teaching here been different than previous teaching experiences?\n\nIn 2012, when Christendom Professor Christopher Shannon won a prestigious fellowship from the Historical Society for the study of post-War narratives of Progress, I was invited to teach in his place for a year. I already knew the caliber of Christendom alumni since working with now-Professors Brendan McGuire and Christopher Lane in our overlapping graduate school days at St. Louis University and Notre Dame. The promise of pulling in harness with such colleagues was a real draw and made much easier my decision to move from Oregon to Virginia, when I was invited last Spring to join Christendom’s history faculty for good.\n\nWhat is your favorite aspect of the college?\n\nMy favorite part of the College is working with Christendom students. I especially enjoy experiencing the diversity of origins in our student body. Whether born in Liverpool, County Mayo, New Zealand, North Dakota, Napa, or northern Virginia, our students bring, along with their faith, integrity, and commitment to the intellectual life, something of their local color and culture into the classrooms.\n\nI heard you are teaching a new class on the First World War this fall. What are your expectations for this class and what made you decide to offer it? What other classes are you currently teaching?\n\nAt present I am teaching core courses in Western Civilization to freshmen and sophomores. In the fall, I will again teach an upper-level course in my area of specialization—Tudor Stuart Britain. I decided to offer the class on World War I because 2014 marks the hundredth anniversary of the commencement of the Great War. My expectations for the class? I would say that this fall I expect to find myself working with intellectually curious students prepared to learn the facts about a crucial period in world history, eager to explore the historical record in an academically-disciplined way, and simply unable to contain the joy that comes from composing masterful history papers in elegant English prose.\n\nWhy do you feel that history is so important to a liberal arts education, and why do you think Christendom College students in particular need to be reminded of this?\n\nThe number of history majors at present suggests to me that Christendom students are not unaware of the importance of history. While history can’t claim as exalted a place in Christendom’s liberal arts curriculum as some other disciplines, I expect that even theology and philosophy majors come to recognize, and to cherish, history as a bulwark and support in their pursuit of truth. Besides, as G. K. Chesterton noted: “We most certainly live in a novel. What I like about this novelist is that he takes such trouble about his minor characters.” Historians, who, with rare exceptions are minor characters themselves, have the privilege of studying the major characters and the minor, as well as situating historically all those other disciplines: natural science, the arts, philosophy, theology. It’s all in history. We may (or may not) be of a literary bent, but we do get to study the work of the greatest of all Novelists.\n\nWhen you’re not teaching or lounging in the library basement what do you enjoy doing? Any hobbies?\n\nSome of my favorite things/diversions include winery tours, travel, hiking and birding with my wife, choral singing, film, and reading, especially Charles Dickens and that greatest writer of English in the twentieth century (according to Hilaire Belloc and Evelyn Waugh), P. G. Wodehouse.\n\nThank you for your kind questions, Miss Reimel. By the way, when you see me in the library's Sacred Grounds Coffee Shop, I am working, decidedly not lounging."
