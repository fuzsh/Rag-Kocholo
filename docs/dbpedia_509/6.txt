WALKING THE BRIDGEWATER: Exploring Manchester’s First Canal. 2nd Edition. Michael Nevell, Terry Wyke, Clare Hartwell, Alan Kidd, Norman Redhead with David George.

2020. 100pp. Fully illustrated (colour & monochrome images). This edition edited by Michael Nevell and David George.

‘The Bridgewater Canal is one of the most iconic industrial monuments in the world. Its opening in 1761 ushered in a boom in industrial canal building in Britain and around the world. The canal would not have been built, though, without the growing industrial market represented by nearby Manchester.

The relationship of the canal to this city is thus of crucial importance in understanding Manchester’s place as the world’s first industrial city. To walk along the canal from Worsley to Manchester is to follow in the footsteps of 250 years of sightseers

The current revised volume, which includes the recent archaeological research at Worsley, captures contemporary responses to the canal and the emergence of Manchester as an international city based around commerce, manufacture and transport. This is represented by the Bridgewater successors; the Ashton and Rochdale canals, and the world-famous Liverpool and Manchester Railway which are also explored in this work.’

Members may remember MRIAS contributed to funding this publication and in return received a number of copies for sale. Michael Nevell has recently, kindly agreed to donate funding from all remaining sales of the book (from whatever source) to MRIAS. Many thanks, Mike!
