        "text": "Don't count on an Atlas milling machine to be capable of doing much work in any reasonable length of time,especially in steel.They work well in brass,and make a good little mill for clock makers.They are just too light.Something like a small Burke that 2 guys can move is much more of a real machine.This is my opinion,having had both mills in my beginning stages.Don't recall the Burke model.It had a table,1 T slot,abt. 4' X 18\".I rigged up a countershaft that provided very slow as well as fast speeds.It was a decent small machine.The Atlas I sold to a clock maker.\n\nDon't have an Atlas, but DO have another similar sized mill.\n\nIf you can slow down the spindle to where you get to 30 rpm as a low end, with steps up from there, you can do real work. You need backgears and a good cone pulley.\n\nYou cannot spin a 4\" cutter at 200 rpm in CRS like a slitting saw in aluminum. All you get is trouble doing that.\n\nMine has a 1/4 HP motor, and a 5 x 18 table, but I can run a high helix slabbing cutter and get some real cutting done surfacing a block, etc. (those long spiraled chips are real stabbers....like spears. Ouch).\n\nYou WILL want to put supports from knee to overarm. Even large mills use them and they really do make a difference.\n\nThose are really the ONLY serious issues with small mills, assuming they are reasonable.... High spindle speed, and lack of support leading to chatter.\n\nI have never stalled the 1/4 HP motor, even with really aggressive cuts (aggressive for this machine). I did shear halfway through a key once.....\n\nNote..... I guess a lack of \"daylight\" is another issue, but it is inherent to a small machine.\n\nI would have to agree with gwilson. I had an Atlas mill which I sold after becoming extreamly fustrated do to the lack of size, power, and ridgidity.\n\nI don't know what you already have for equipment, but I think a small vertical would be a better choice if you don't already have one.\n\nThe Atlas mill has its place.\n\nI picked one up once I realized that I needed more than just one shop location. For the shop where I work on miniatures, models and robotics, the Atlas mill has filled a niche. For that mill I have added a Rusnok head for vertical operations so I have the best of both worlds.\n\nAn Atlas is one of the few horizontal mills that you can pick up and carry if you are a strong guy...try that with a larger mill.\n\nMaking parts that fit WITHIN its work envelope, it does just find.\n\nConsidering the prices they still bring, there is a strong demand for them.\n\nTMT"
