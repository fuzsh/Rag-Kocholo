The formatting of the data row is complex, occurring on one or two lines in the list, and this can be of two different shades. There are ten unnamed parameters, and the named parameters force, and color. The parameter force, forces a 2 row format when there is no image or notes. color (misspelling to be consistent with css) may be set to dark or pale to assist with formatting. oscoor is used to input a raw UKgrid reference which is then processed by {{oscoor}} to give a clickable link.
