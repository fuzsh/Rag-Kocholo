Successful integration of these data requires a standard 3D reference atlas. Here, we present the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3) as such a resource. We constructed an average template brain at 10 μm voxel resolution by interpolating high resolution in-plane serial two-photon tomography images with 100 μm z-sampling from 1,675 young adult C57BL/6J mice. Then, using multimodal reference data, we parcellated the entire brain directly in 3D, labeling every voxel with a brain structure spanning 43 isocortical areas and their layers, 329 subcortical gray matter structures, 81 fiber tracts, and 8 ventricular structures. CCFv3 can be used to analyze, visualize and integrate multimodal and multiscale datasets in 3D, and is openly accessible (https://atlas.brain-map.org).\n\nKeywords: mouse brain, atlas, 3D atlas, reference atlas, CCF, connectivity, transgenic mouse, cortex, fiber tract, 3D visualization\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nThe Allen Mouse Brain CCF is an openly accessible, cellular level resolution 3D reference atlas for analysis, visualization and integration of multimodal and multiscale datasets.\n\nIntroduction\n\nModern advances in whole brain imaging techniques have made it essential that brain atlases keep pace with large-scale data collection. Digital three-dimensional (3D) atlases are in demand, having significant advantages over classic 2D plate-based atlases as anatomical frameworks for whole brain datasets. Both 2D and 3D reference atlases consist of two key separable and complementary components; (1) the reference brain and its image, and (2) the structural annotations that show how the brain is parcellated. A standard reference atlas should include additional critical features: a spatial coordinate system, ordered structure ontologies, and easy, interactive access to the atlas at multiple resolutions.\n\nThe current standard 2D atlas annotations were drawn on images of a single reference brain sectioned in one plane, stained, and imaged with cellular resolution light microscopy (e.g., Ding et al., 2016; Dong, 2008; Paxinos and Franklin, 2012; Swanson, 2004). Conventionally, parcellation is based on cellular architecture revealed with histological stains (e.g., Nissl, AChE) and/or myelin architecture (e.g., Gallyas silver stain, myelin basic protein). Brain parcellation efforts also utilize differential gene expression, connectivity patterns, or functional properties between brain areas. As each of these modalities may reveal unique characteristics of certain brain regions, when used together, they are expected to greatly improve structural delineations. However, no mammalian brain atlas has systematically combined modalities in a single integrated atlas. In the last decade, brain mapping projects have provided substantial new data revealing highly detailed cellular architecture, including gene expression (Lein et al., 2007; Ng et al., 2009), mesoscale connectivity (Oh et al., 2014; Zingg et al., 2014), and transgenic expression in Cre driver mice (Gong et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2017; Shima et al., 2016). To stay current, reference atlases should allow for modifications to parcellation schemes based on current knowledge.\n\nStandard 2D mouse brain reference atlases, e.g., the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA, Dong, 2008) and the Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (MBSC, Paxinos and Franklin, 2001, 2012), continue to serve important roles, but a digital 3D reference atlas is preferred for informatics-based workflows, data visualization, and integration across brains, labs, and data types. The Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) is a 3D reference atlas that has already undergone several revisions. The first version, CCFv1, was created to support whole brain gene expression mapping and searches (Lein et al., 2007). We converted a subset (n=~200) of the Nissl-based ARA 2D structure annotations to 3D, in one hemisphere, at low resolution (200 μm voxels). CCFv2 was introduced to support mapping and visualization of brain-wide mesoscale connectivity (Oh et al., 2014). It included many more structure annotations (n = 860) converted from the ARA, both hemispheres, and higher resolution voxels (100 μm). Despite these improvements, at least two major issues remained: (1) conversion of the coronally-annotated 2D structures to 3D volumes resulted in irregular, non-biological, borders and shapes when viewed in non-coronal planes, and (2) current large-scale data generation efforts, such as the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (www.biccn.org), require a higher, cellular level resolution atlas (10–20 μm, Ecker et al., 2017).\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we created CCFv3. First, we generated a new 3D reference brain: a volumetric average template at 10 μm isotropic voxel resolution. Second, we comprehensively parcellated and annotated the entire average template brain directly in 3D space. To assist with accurate areal delineations, we compiled and curated multimodal reference datasets deformably registered to the average template brain. Reference data included histology stains, immunohistochemistry, transgene expression, in situ hybridization (ISH) and anterograde tracer connectivity experiments. CCFv3 is parcellated into 43 isocortical areas and their layers, 329 subcortical gray matter structures, 81 fiber tracts, and 8 ventricular structures (per hemisphere). Data and tools are accessible through our web portal (http://atlas.brain-map.org).\n\nResults\n\nThe Average Template\n\nThe CCFv3 reference brain is a 3D spatial template constructed as a population average of 1,675 young adult mouse brains imaged using serial two photon tomography (STPT) for the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (Kuan et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2014; Ragan et al., 2012). The average was created from tissue autofluorescence detected in the red channel. Different formulations of an “average brain” could exist depending on the feature being averaged. For future leverage and integration with human atlases, we followed methods developed for a human MRI-based population average template (Fonov et al., 2011). To maximize input data and create a symmetrical atlas, each hemisphere was reflected across the midline, for a total of 3,350 image series (= 2 × 1,675 brains). STPT images were acquired at high resolution (x, y = 0.35 μm/pixel) every 100 μm through the anterior-posterior axis of the brain, then downsampled to 50, 25, and 10 μm in x-y axes. Slight offsets in the position where imaging starts for each brain provides sufficient coverage to allow interpolation along the z-axis to obtain isotropic voxel resolution to 10 μm. Assuming uniform sampling along the z-axis, each 10 μm is spanned by data from 335 hemispheres, a number comparable to Fonov et al., 2011. We started with a previous template (Kuan et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2014), adding more registered brains to create the new CCFv3 initial template. An iterative process (1) deformably registered each specimen to the template and averaged all specimens, and (2) computed the average deformation field over all specimens, then inverted and applied it to the average image created in (1). This resulted in a volume with an average unbiased shape and intensity used as the template in the next iteration. The algorithm continued until the difference between the mean magnitude of the average deformation field between iterations fell below a certain threshold and stabilized. illustrates the convergence to a sharp average image with evident anatomical details. For computational efficiency, the method was first applied at 50 μm resolution until convergence was attained, followed by processing at 25 μm, then 10 μm for the final 3D volume ( – ). The average template was matched in size and anterior-posterior extent to the ARA Nissl-stained specimen to retain integrity with the original coordinates and dependent informatic tools. So, the most rostral part of the main olfactory bulb and the most caudal parts of the medulla and cerebellum are excluded. At 10 μm voxel resolution, the average template contains ~506 million voxels. Its dimensions are 1320 (anterior to posterior, 13.2 mm) × 1140 (left to right, 11.4 mm) × 800 voxels (dorsal to ventral, 8.0 mm).\n\nThe final template contains many distinguishable, detailed, anatomical features ( – ). Intensity (contrast) levels appear to reflect differences in cell densities (see Methods for details), with white and gray matter appearing at opposite ends of the intensity scale (dark = fiber tracts, light = gray matter). The whisker barrel fields in layer 4 of the primary somatosensory cortex (SSp-bfd) are much more evident in the template compared to a single specimen ( ). In the medullary spinal nucleus of the trigeminal, interpolar part (SPVI), the first brain location targeted by axons carrying sensory information from each whisker, it is difficult to identify the whisker barrelette formations using only background fluorescence in a single STPT coronal image, but, this structure also becomes clearly visible in the average template ( top vs bottom). Similarly, the related barreloids in the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus ( ), cortical layers ( and ), and other thalamic nuclei ( and ) exemplify how the averaging process revealed anatomical structures. The average template provides resolution at cellular scale and is a suitable 3D reference brain for parcellation and annotation.\n\nStructure Ontology\n\nTwo major rodent brain ontologies are used today; (1) Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (Paxinos and Watson, 2013), also used in the MBSC (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001, 2012), and (2) Brain Maps: Structure of the Rat Brain (Swanson, 2004, 2018). While full structure names show major overlap between ontologies, abbreviations are quite different (e.g., primary visual cortex is “V1” in MBSC and “VISp” in the Swanson ontology). For CCFv3, we use the ARA ontology which followed Brain Maps, but adopt terms from the MBSC, or other publications, when structures were not present in the ARA ontology. Given these differences, users should carefully assess regions with respect to their own purposes (Table S1 compares ARA and MBSC terms). The ARA ontology is hierarchical (see also Figure S6A). At the top level (“root”), the brain is divided into gray matter (including cell groups and regions), fiber tracts (myelinated structures), and ventricular systems (spaces filled with brain fluid). Gray matter is sub-divided into 3 large regions (“cerebrum”, “brain stem”, and “cerebellum”), which are themselves organized into subregions with differing numbers of “leaves” in the hierarchical tree (Table S2). Similar structures are not always at the same hierarchical level. So, we also refer to 12 “major divisions” of the gray matter: isocortex, olfactory areas, hippocampal formation, cortical subplate, striatum, pallidum, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla and cerebellum, and 316 “summary structures”: non-overlapping, finer divisions, independent of their exact depth in the tree (Table S2).\n\nAnnotation Workflow and Reference Datasets\n\nAnnotation of the average template brain was accomplished using a coordinated, iterative workflow ( ). The first step for a given structure was review of previously published atlases and literature, visual analyses of the average template and the five types of multimodal reference datasets ( and Figure S1). Reference data were selected based on existing knowledge and new analyses, for those which best revealed boundaries and layers of isocortical areas, subcortical structures, and fiber tracts. Data types included: (1) Transgenic mouse data imaged with STPT (Madisen et al., 2010; Daigle et al., 2018; Gerfen et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2014, 2019; Shima et al., 2016), (2) Axonal projection data from the Allen Mouse Connectivity Atlas (Harris et al., 2019; Martersteck et al., 2017; Oh et al., 2014), (3) Immunohistochemical and (4) Cytoarchitectural stains; including antibodies against NeuN, NF-160, SMI-32, Parvalbumin, SMI-99 and Calbindin, as well as stains for DAPI, Nissl, and AChE, and (5) In situ hybridization (ISH) data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Ng et al., 2009, 2010). Datasets curated for each structure revealed highly coincident shapes, sizes, and borders. Occasionally, we encountered conflicting evidence that suggested small differences in border locations for a given structure. To deal with this rare situation, we re-assessed the multimodal datasets for quality (including registration results) and consulted additional mouse and rat atlases and literature to best integrate all the information into our final annotation. In no case did we see data that suggested orthogonal or perpendicular borders due to different datasets. Specific datasets used for the delineation of brain structures are listed in Table S3, which is searchable and contains links or file locations where images can be accessed and/or downloaded.\n\nThe exact criteria used for determining boundaries varied depending on the specific structure, so here we provide examples in the following sections to illustrate our approach. With the selected reference data registered and overlaid, structures were reconstructed directly in the average template using the 3D annotation software ITK-SNAP (www.itksnap.org, Yushkevich et al., 2006). Neuroanatomists delineated each structure across coronal, sagittal and horizontal planes at regular intervals, depending on the size and shape of the structure ( ). This “weaved’ structure was filled in, refined and smoothed by illustration specialists ( ), and then validated by the neuroanatomists. Once a critical number of 3D reconstructions was reached, individual and local structure groups were merged. After merging, minor overlaps and gaps were fixed, so that all voxels were assigned to a single brain structure ( ). A final evaluation was then performed by the neuroanatomists. This procedure was followed for delineation of cortical layers, subcortical gray matter structures, white matter fiber tracts and ventricular structures, but not isocortical areas, which used a variant described next. We fully annotated the entire average template volume (i.e., no voxel is left unlabeled).\n\nParcellation: Isocortex Areas\n\nThe isocortex is a 3D sheet organized into layers where connections between the layers are typically perpendicular to the surface, suggesting a hypothetical columnar organization. Even though the mouse cortex is lissencephalic, its curvature makes it difficult to visualize along this theoretical dimension, as one “column” cuts through a variable number of coronal planes. So, we developed a curved cortical coordinate system to approximate the “vertical” direction of the sheet based on the geometry of the cortex. These curved coordinates enable the integration and aggregation of information in a columnar manner across datasets, facilitating analyses and parcellation of the cortex.\n\nThe first step to create the curved coordinates was to draw the outside border of the entire isocortex. Although the boundaries between isocortex and its neighbors are mostly recognizable in the average template, manual delineation was facilitated by overlaying STPT images obtained from transgenic Cre driver mice, e.g., Calb1-T2A-dgCre and Fezf2-CreER ( – ). Calb1-T2A-dgCre shows enriched gene expression in the superficial layers of the entire isocortex, except for the ventral part of the retrosplenial area. Fezf2-CreER shows complementary expression in deep layers. In a coronal view, the isocortex is separable ventrally and laterally from the piriform area (PIR), where expression of both transgenes is absent ( ). In a sagittal view, it is separable from the postsubiculum (POST) and area prostriata (Apr) posteriorly, and anteroventrally from the PIR ( ). Horizontally, isocortex can be separated anteriorly from the main and accessory olfactory bulb (MOB and AOB), and posteriorly from the lateral entorhinal cortex (ENTl), which contains strong Fezf2-CreER and weak Calb1-T2A-Cre expression ( ).\n\nAfter delineating the entire isocortex in 3D, the outer surfaces of Layer (L) 6b (bordering white matter) and L1 (bordering pial surface) were designated. Laplace’s equation was solved between these surfaces, resulting in intermediate equidistance fields ( ). Steepest descent paths, called streamlines, were computed through the equidistance fields from the pial surface to the white matter ( – , Jones et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2011; Lerch et al., 2008). Analyses of the streamlines provides data on cortical geometry, e.g., radial orientation may reflect putative column orientation (Figure S2A) and variation in thickness can be mapped across the cortical sheet (Figure S2B).\n\nWe confirmed the streamlines reflect the true curvature of a vertical axis by comparing them with the topology of thick-tufted dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons which extend to L1 (Figure S2E–V). L5 neurons were selectively labeled with Cre-dependent viral tracer injections into the Sim1-Cre_KJ18 driver line (Harris et al., 2019). In the nose region of primary somatosensory cortex (SSp-n), L5 apical dendrites cross several coronal planes in the anterior direction from the labeled cell bodies (Figure S2E–S2K), and, similarly, streamlines are slightly tilted anteriorly (Figure S2L–N). In the rostrolateral visual cortex (VISrl) streamlines are closer to upright (see green star, Figure S2A), and L5 apical dendrites cross fewer coronal planes (Figure S2S inset). In more anterior locations where the isocortical sheet curves ventrally, such as the secondary motor cortex (MOs, see orange star, Figure S2C), streamlines become almost orthogonal to the coronal plane, looking very like the apical dendrites of Sim1-Cre+ neurons in MOs when sectioned coronally (Figure S2U inset). In fact, it can be hard to visualize L5 apical tufts in single coronal sections but reorienting these data by “unbending” the curved cortical sheet, so streamlines point up, reveals the stereotypical profile of the Sim1-Cre+ apical dendrites reaching to L1 (Figure S2O–V).\n\nUsing the computed streamlines, information at different cortical depths can be aggregated and projected to the pial surface. Various 2D views can then be created from 3D, and information can also be translated back to 3D. For example, streamlines enable visualization of the entire cortical sheet in 2D, i.e., a virtual “flatmap” (Figure S2A–D, Fischl et al., 1999, Harris et al., 2019). We used multiple 2D surface views of the 3D average template overlaid with registered reference datasets for parcellation. Surface views were generated by projecting the highest intensity voxel along a streamline to its surface voxel counterpart. Given that various views can provide additional information across a rounded surface, we used seven angles (top, bottom, medial, side, rotated, front and back). Example datasets mapped onto the top and lateral views are shown in – and S3, as these two angles contain most isocortical areas in a single image, but all surface views generated for the transgenic and connectivity data used to delineate isocortex regions are available for download. We drew borders directly on these 2D views, integrating data as described next, then transformed the surface drawings into 3D volumes by extrapolating from the surface along the streamlines.\n\nIn the top view of the average template ( ), distinct bright domains are obvious, e.g., barrel fields, which are unambiguously anatomical structures. Based on the location and shape of these structures, we putatively assigned them as primary visual, primary auditory, primary somatosensory and retrosplenial areas. Boundaries were confirmed by overlaying registered reference datasets on the average template. Rorb-IRES2-Cre, a marker of layer 4 neurons densest in primary sensory areas, affirmed the putative borders of the three primary sensory regions ( , red). Transgene expression in the Chrna2-Cre_OE25 line is enriched in retrosplenial areas ( , green), and the registered spatial pattern aligned well with the putative border drawn from the average template. Additional datasets helped finalize the borders and subdivisions within them (Figure S3). These four major cortical regions then served as landmarks for the remaining isocortex.\n\nUnlike the intrinsically bright areas, regions between landmarks are not visible using only contrast in the average template. For higher order (secondary) visual areas, we generated visuotopic connectivity maps and a virtual callosal connectivity map ( ). By overlaying these on the average template, we identified nine higher visual areas based on their complete visual field maps and fixed spatial relationships with callosal labeling patterns (Wang and Burkhalter, 2007). Five of these areas (anterolateral, rostrolateral, anterior, anteromedial, and posteromedial), were also recognizable for having enriched expression in line Glt25d2-Cre_NF107 (Figure S3C, in red) and axonal projections from the lateral dorsal nucleus of thalamus (Figure S3D, in green).\n\nTo parcellate the remaining isocortical areas, we continued to use both transgenic and connectivity datasets registered to the average template, as well as consulting histological reference stains, published atlases, and literature. In the top view, we further delineated dorsal (Figure S3D,E), agranular ( and S3F), and ventral retrosplenial areas (Figures S3F,G), primary and secondary motor areas ( ), the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate area (Figure S3H, in green) and the prelimbic area (Figure S3F, in green). Like the top view, the lateral view of the template also showed the primary sensory areas as inherently brighter than surrounding structures (Figure S3I). Their shapes, sizes and locations were similarly confirmed through registration and visualization of transgenic expression data. In addition to reconstructing areas that were at least in part visible in the top view, the lateral view enabled additional areas to be parcellated (details and examples in the Figure S3 legend). We reconstructed 31 isocortical areas in the top view ( ) and 33 in the lateral view (Figure S3T). Using all surface views, the mouse isocortex was parcellated into 43 total areas.\n\nParcellation: Isocortex Layers\n\nNext, we delineated the borders between isocortical layers primarily using differential contrast features in the average template itself and Cre driver lines with layer-selective reporter expression ( – , Gerfen et al., 2013; Harris et al., 2014, 2019), as well as consulting histology data and publications. In the average template ( ), Layer 1 (L1) is brighter at the cortical surface, getting darker near the transition to L2/3. L4 is generally brighter than L2/3 and L5, while L6 is generally darker than L5, but brighter than the fiber tracts beneath the isocortex. L6a and 6b are not readily distinguishable in the average template. L6b, located directly above the white matter, is very thin (~20–30 μm, 2–3 voxels), so we relied on the Ctgf-2A-dgCre line with enriched expression in L6b neurons ( ). L1, 2/3, 5, 6a, and 6b were delineated for all isocortical areas using multiple Cre lines for each layer, registered and overlaid on the average template. L4 is not present (or very thin) in the prelimbic, infralimbic, orbital, agranular insular, motor, anterior cingulate, retrosplenial, perirhinal and ectorhinal areas. Delineated layers were intersected with the 43 cortical areas, resulting in a total of 242 structure volumes ( ).\n\nParcellation: Subcortical Gray Matter Structures\n\nWe delineated an additional 329 gray matter structures outside the isocortex, covering the other 11 major brain divisions. For each structure, we curated a unique combination of experiments extracted from the complete set of histological, immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, transgenic driver line, and connectivity datasets that were most consistent with each other to define putative borders (Table S3). Contrast features inherent in the average template were always used when present and informative. Each subcortical structure was concurrently delineated through coronal, sagittal and horizontal planes of the average template at 10 μm voxel resolution to create smooth 3D volumes. We present here only one example out of 329, the interpeduncular nucleus in the midbrain (IPN, ). First, we comprehensively reviewed previous parcellations in other atlases and the literature on IPN anatomy. IPN was previously delineated into seven (Paxinos and Franklin, 2012) or eight (Quina et al., 2017) subdivisions based on cytoarchitecture, transgenic and connectivity data. It was not sub-divided in the ARA (Dong, 2008). We also delineated eight IPN subdivisions in CCFv3 ( ) using a combination of cytoarchitecture (Nissl, ), antibody staining ( – ), transgene expression ( – ), axonal projections to IPN labeled via anterograde tracing ( – ), and the average template itself ( – ). We reviewed all the high resolution 2D image data to assist in discovering and determining the locations, shapes, and contours of regions in coronal planes, and we overlaid the registered image data (downsampled to 10 μm) on the average template for viewing and drawing in the three orthogonal planes ( – ). Details are provided in the legend.\n\nEach structure was pursued in this way, with data analyses, drawing, and merging of structure groups as described above ( ). Most voxels in the average template volume were labeled after parcellating the 329 subcortical gray matter structures. However, some gaps in the gray matter (i.e., unlabeled voxels) remained. Based on the specific location within the brain, these voxels were assigned to one of the 11 major brain regions (as part of a “parent” structure). For example, after delineating the more than 40 hypothalamic nuclei, there were gaps between regions that did not clearly belong to any of the neighboring annotations (e.g., see light pink color around DMH, VMH, TU and LHA in Figure S7B). We labeled such voxels that were located between other regions with the appropriate parent structure (e.g., “Hypothalamus”).\n\nParcellation: Fiber Tracts\n\nWe delineated white matter fiber tracts throughout the entire brain volume ( , ) primarily using inherent contrast features in the average template supported by two types of reference data: anterograde tracing and antibody staining. Some white matter bundles are obviously distinguishable from surrounding gray matter structures, as the axons contained within them are highly fasciculated, traveling in the same direction at these locations. In these types of tracts, contours and trajectories were readily defined by comparing the average template with corresponding anterograde tracing data that directly labels the axons making up these tracts. As an example, we show a set of three related tracts all originating from the medial mammillary nucleus (MM, , ); the principal mammillary tract (pm), most proximal to MM, which splits to form the mammillotegmental tract (mtg) and the mammillothalamic tract (mtt). Axonal tracing data from the Allen Mouse Connectivity Atlas shows the mtt travels anteriorly to innervate thalamic regions, e.g., anteroventral (AV) and anteromedial (AM) nuclei ( , ), whereas the mtg travels posteriorly to innervate the midbrain ventral tegmental nucleus (VTN, , ). The location, shape, size and trajectories of these three tracts can thus be accurately delineated by comparing the STPT images of labeled axons originating from MM in the coronal plane with the average template (where the tracts are dark in appearance, – ). Contours of these fiber tracts were drawn, then adjusted and smoothed iteratively on the average template in coronal, sagittal and horizontal planes to build coherent 3D volumes. Other examples of “simple” fiber tracts include the anterior commissure (ac), fornix (fx), and fasciculus retroflexus (fr, see labels in ). Most fiber tracts were more complicated. More commonly, fiber tracts adjoin, merge, or intersect other bundles and/or portions of gray matter structures at different locations, leading to different intensities along their complete paths. For these structures, we used additional reference data to more accurately delineate boundaries and trajectories, e.g., antibody staining for parvalbumin (Pvalb) which reveals clear fiber orientation patterns for tracts such as the medial lemniscus, as described for rat (Celio, 1990; Endo et al., 1986), see also CCF technical documentation (http://atlas.brain-map.org/). Applying these methods and processes for simple and complicated white matter, we reconstructed 81 fiber tracts throughout the mouse brain in 3D (Table S2).\n\nParcellation: Ventricular Structures\n\nThe ventricular system includes the lateral ventricle, third ventricle, cerebral aqueduct, fourth ventricle and central canal of the lower medulla, as well as associated ventricular recesses and choroid plexuses. We delineated these structures in 3D based mainly on inherent contrast in the average template, paired with corresponding Nissl-stained sections (Figure S4). In the template, ventricles, like many white matter tracts, have a very dark appearance (Figures S4D–H). In Nissl-stained sections, however, the shape and size of ventricular structures and choroid plexuses are readily distinguishable from fiber tracts (Figures S4I–M). The contours of these structures were also delineated using specific transgenic lines that label the ependymal epithelia (e.g., Slc17a8-IRES2-Cre, Figure S4N–9R) and/or choroid plexuses (e.g., Foxp2IRES-Cre, not shown). One notable observation is that the cerebral aqueduct, at the level of the inferior colliculus, appears more ventricle- than aqueduct-like (Figure S4C). As described for fiber tracts and subcortical gray matter structures, the adjustment and smoothing of these structures were done iteratively in coronal, sagittal and horizontal planes to build a 3D volume. We reconstructed 8 ventricles and associated structures.\n\nStructures added to CCFv3\n\nWhile manually inspecting and curating the multimodal reference data, we found evidence to support the addition of 36 subcortical gray matter structures to the ARA/CCFv3 ontology. Most (n=27) already exist in the MBSC ontology and atlas, and we were able to identify enough reference data to support adding these delineations in CCFv3. However, several structures are unique to CCFv3 over other reference atlases (Table S1), although all were previously described in the literature. For example, the IPRL subdivision of the IPN ( ) described above is a new CCFv3 structure. We also further parcellated the dorsal part of the lateral geniculate complex (LGd) into three subdivisions not previously annotated in ARA or MBSC ontologies, based on anatomical features in the template, anterograde tracing data from retinal ganglion cell types, and previous publications; shell (LGd-sh), core (LG-co), and ipsilateral zone (LG-ip, Figure S5; Grubb and Thompson, 2004; Huberman et al., 2009; Kay et al., 2011; Kerschensteiner and Guido, 2017; Kim et al., 2011; Martersteck et al., 2017; Rivlin-Etzion et al., 2011). Other newly delineated gray matter structures include the hippocampoamygdalar transition area, prosubiculum and area prostriata (Ding, 2013; Ding et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2020).\n\nWe also identified and added four fiber tracts not in the previous ARA and MBSC; the optic and auditory radiations, the body of the corpus callosum (ccb), and the supra-callosal cerebral white matter (scwm, – ). Cortical callosal projections make up a fiber bundle that is generally labeled as a single tract, the corpus callosum (cc, e.g., Dong, 2008; Paxinos and Franklin, 2012). However, visual inspection of contralateral axonal projections labeled from a comprehensive set of cortical areas revealed that these cortical axons do not occupy the entire white matter region beneath the isocortex. Labeled callosal axons are instead concentrated in the mid-to-deep portion of the white matter, in both hemispheres, leaving a clear gap between this callosal bundle and the overlying isocortex ( – ). In contrast, we observed that thalamocortical axons appear to be layered above the callosal bundles, just beneath overlying isocortex ( – ). Based on this striking lamination in the white matter, i.e., separate callosal and thalamocortical axon paths, we delineated these as two separate structures; the cc and scwm. Interestingly, corticothalamic projection fibers appear to first travel in the scwm and then penetrate the callosal bundle before they innervate subcortical targets (not shown). Therefore, the cc is mainly composed of the cortical commissural fibers that run between the two hemispheres and part of the cortico-subcortical fibers. The scwm mostly consists of ipsilateral thalamocortical projection fibers, including the optic radiation (or) and cingulum bundle (cing, , ), as well as the auditory radiation and part of the cortico-subcortical fibers.\n\nCCF applications and resources\n\nWe developed web applications for exploring CCFv3 in 2D and 3D (http://atlas.brain-map.org). Our interactive Atlas Viewer (http://atlas.brain-map.org/atlas?atlas=602630314) provides 2D visualization and linked browsing of coronal average template sections overlaid with corresponding structure annotations, like a conventional 2D reference atlas (Figure S6A–C). Notably, the Atlas Viewer can also be used to compare our anatomists’ delineations of the average template side-by-side with most of the multimodal reference datasets. Exceptions include the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) ISH data, as these datasets were not registered directly to CCFv3, and a few transgenic line experiments currently available only via download. Using Table S3, users can identify experiments of interest for a given structure and follow the links provided to navigate to these datasets individually. For example, clicking on the link for a connectivity experiment will open a Mouse Connectivity Atlas experiment page. There, one can open the high resolution image viewer (a box with arrow icon) and click on the key icon to show the reference atlas. Turning on this functionality changes the display into a side-by-side split window with the atlas image on the left and the data image on the right. The two views can be aligned using the “sync” feature (Figure S6D). The Experiment Image Viewer also provides the ability to view and navigate multiple datasets in a single window to compare different expression or connectivity patterns from multiple experiments. For example, one can view the histological reference stains by selecting and viewing all experiments at this link (http://connectivity.brain-map.org/static/referencedata), then adding and “syncing” with the 3D coronal atlas (Figure S6E–I). The Allen Brain Explorer (beta) application enables 3D visualization of CCFv3 structures (http://connectivity.brain-map.org/3d-viewer?v=1). It supports linked browsing and visualization of structures of interest in the CCFv3 ontology tree or loading of 3D models for different sets of structures (e.g., “major divisions” or “fine divisions”).\n\nThe Allen Brain Map portal hosts downloads through our web Application Programming Interface (API; http://help.brain-map.org/display/mouseconnectivity/API) and the Allen Software Development Kit (AllenSDK; https://allensdk.rtfd.io/en/latest/reference_space.html). The AllenSDK provides, in addition to data access and caching, a thoroughly documented and actively maintained open source library of tools for using CCFv3 annotations in concert with registered data. The API and AllenSDK together support cross-platform, public access to the CCFv3 ontology, template, and annotation volumes (at 10, 25, 50, and 100 μm isotropic resolution) along with the code and documentation required to use the CCFv3 in research projects.\n\nTo demonstrate potential uses of the CCF and Allen SDK, we developed two applications using image series already registered to the CCF: reverse mapping and volume estimation. Above, we described that data used to assist with parcellations were warped and downsampled to fit into the average template volume ( – ). However, the reverse mapping, i.e., visualizing atlas annotations in the original image space, is also possible. We used the AllenSDK to access CCFv3, our STPT image data, and original transform parameters following deformable registration to the CCF and applied the inverted deformation field output from the registration process to warp the CCF to the images ( – ). Using the deformation fields also enabled us to compute brain structure volumes for the population of mice used to create the average template. Note that deformably mapping data to a template does not preserve distance relationships, and so measurements like distance and volume need to be done on the original specimen space. The population used to create the average template consists of 1,675 brains (n = 1,051 males: 621 females), with a mean age and SD of P77 ± 10.7 days. First, to calculate whole brain volumes for each brain, we generated a voxel mask for the entire average template volume. Then, we applied a marching cubes algorithm to find the corresponding surface mesh of this mask. Deformation fields were again applied in reverse to map the whole brain surface mesh back to each individual brain’s original shape and size ( ). Volumes ranged from 359–545 mm3, with a mean and SD of 435 ± 23.5 mm3 ( ). Thus, most individual whole brain volumes are within ~11% of the mean, with a coefficient of variation (CoV) = 5.4%. We did not observe a significant difference between males and females (434.24 ± 22.94 vs 437.07 ± 24.41 mm3, respectively). Note the mean volume is ~15% smaller than the CCFv3 average template (435 vs 506 mm3). This is due to our first version template (Kuan et al., 2015) which intentionally matched the size and orientation of the ARA Nissl-stained brain specimen. Since this template initialized the CCFv3 average, the size and shape were also inherited. Notably, the unfixed fresh-frozen ARA specimen is closer in size to brains imaged in vivo (e.g., 506.9 ± 11.5 mm3, Ma et al., 2008) compared to the perfusion-fixed brains imaged by STPT. We also calculated structure volumes and descriptive statistics across the entire CCFv3 ontology using the approach described for the whole brain (Table S4). Major division volumes were not any more variable than the whole brain (CoVs=5.4% to 7%), whereas variation was larger (10.7%) for the finest divisions. The largest variations (87%) were noted in structures with very high surface area to volume ratios (i.e., long thin structures like layer 6b). These measurements rely on the specimen deformation fields, so variations in individual volumes are a function of both underlying biological variability and variability in the registration process.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe CCFv3 reference brain offers several improvements over previous volumetric templates. First, we averaged substantially more individuals than MRI-based templates (n=1,675 vs 4–40, Ali et al., 2005; Bock et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2006; Dorr et al., 2008; Kovacević et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2005; Sharief et al., 2008). Acquiring whole brain high resolution images for so many specimens combined with iterations of registration and averaging resulted in very good signal-to-noise, revealing anatomical details not readily discernable in any single specimen. Second, CCFv3 has the highest spatial resolution of any available 3D reference brain (10 vs 17–50 μm voxels or more) and is 1,000 times higher resolution than CCFv2 (100 μm voxels). Of course, limitations still exist. For example, the reference brain is ~ 15% larger than the average of the individual STPT imaged brains used in its creation, and, the relationship of the template to fiducial landmarks of the skull (e.g., Bregma) are unknown. So, at present, CCFv3 is not suitable for determining stereotaxic coordinates. This limitation could be overcome by registering the average template to brains imaged in the skull with high resolution MRI or X-ray microCT, or validating mapped coordinates following alignment of the CCFv3 to the MBSC atlas (Chon et al., 2019).\n\nWe labeled all the voxels in the average template to produce a fully annotated 3D reference atlas using an approach that differs notably from previous atlases (including CCFv2). Here, we delineated structures directly in 3D to build smooth volumes as opposed to drawing in only one imaging plane, which produced noticeable improvement in the “smoothness” of borders when viewed in all planes (Figure S7). This result is not just aesthetic. The isocortex is a thin sheet of gray matter which has a concave inner surface and a convex outer surface, so, it follows that areal borders that extend from the brain surface down to the white matter should be curved. However, in conventional 2D atlases, borders between cortical areas are always drawn as straight lines from the pial surface down to the white matter in all planes (coronal, horizontal, and sagittal, e.g., Paxinos and Franklin, 2012). Straight border lines seem very unlikely to represent the true curvature of the isocortical sheet in 3D space.\n\nConventional 2D mouse brain atlases are drawn on reference brains stained with Nissl (Dong, 2008), or Nissl and AChE (Paxinos and Franklin, 2012). We also used Nissl staining to corroborate and assist in drawing borders, but it was not the primary reference space (i.e., the average template). Other reference data types commonly consulted for parcellating mouse brain structures include myeloarchitecture, chemoarchitecture, genoarchitecture, connectivity, and functional mapping (Bienkowski et al., 2018; Gămănuţ et al., 2018; Garrett et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2008; Wang and Burkhalter, 2007; Watson et al., 2012; Zhuang et al., 2017). Given that each data set reveals a unique labeling pattern for certain regions, combining data types should provide a tremendous methodological advantage for accurately defining brain structures. Our neuroanatomists carefully selected datasets across these modalities, and, like atlases drawn by other experts, subjectively integrated these data to draw borders (albeit this time in 3D). Incorporating additional structures and using these annotation methods likely enhanced the accuracy of areal delineations, but we did not systematically validate all the parcellations by mapping them back onto individual image series containing appropriately labeled data for validation.\n\nWe annotated 658 individual structures in total for CCFv3. It contains far more 3D reconstructions than any existing MRI-based atlas (Ali et al., 2005; Badea et al., 2007; Dorr et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2005; MacKenzie-Graham et al., 2004; Ullmann et al., 2013), but fewer annotated structures compared to standard 2D atlases, i.e., MBSC (4th edition, n=946) and ARA (n=860). Reasons included a lack of available data from which borders could be confidently drawn, but, in large part came down to resources, as the process of manually annotating so many structures in 3D was time and labor intensive. Given major advances in machine learning approaches to image feature detection and leveraging large multimodal whole brain datasets, we expect future atlases will be built in more automated, unbiased, ways (Van Essen and Glasser, 2018). Several groups have already applied automatic delineation methods to mouse brain MRI, but so far extracted only major brain regions (Johnson et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2005, 2008) or focused on a small number of brain areas in reasonable detail (Chen et al., 2019). Supervised machine learning methods could be applied to learn image features predictive of known brain regions using manual parcellation results. Comparison of atlases built from unimodal and multimodal data types will undoubtedly shed new light on fundamentals of brain organization. To achieve this goal, it is important that data and delineations are in a common spatial coordinate framework.\n\nRegistration of image data into the CCF enables direct comparison and integration across multiple datasets in the same space. Specifically, registration enables a voxel-level description of features of interest in any given image series. As each 10 μm voxel is labeled with a structure from the ARA ontology, one can simply add up all the voxels with the same label to get descriptions at the brain region level, enabling multi-scale analyses ranging from single voxel (cellular resolution) to whole brain. Voxel-based data summaries are demonstrably useful for quantitative analyses (e.g., Kim et al., 2017; Knox et al., 2019; Oh et al., 2014; Whitesell et al., 2019) and data visualizations across multiple resolutions (Winnubst et al., 2019). Working with voxels also provides flexibility in structure annotation (i.e., voxels can be relabeled) and, the ability to ignore parcellation completely for purely spatial-based analyses.\n\nRegistration precision may always be best for image series collected using the same modality (i.e., STPT), but other image types can also be registered to this template. We did not develop registration software tools for users, but, since the CCF was made available online, many recent publications already describe registration solutions and informatics pipelines for different imaging modalities, including MRI, light sheet imaging of cleared brains, other high-resolution fluorescent whole-brain imaging platforms, and traditional histological-stained brain sections (Allan Johnson et al., 2019; Chon et al., 2019; Eastwood et al., 2019; Fürth et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018; Ni et al., 2020; Pallast et al., 2019; Puchades et al., 2019; Renier et al., 2016; Salinas et al., 2018; Tappan et al., 2019; Tward and Miller, 2019; Winnubst et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2018). CCFv3 has also been used to provide anatomical context for large-scale electrophysiology experiments distributed across the brain (Steinmetz et al., 2019) and for widefield calcium imaging maps in cortex of behaving mice (Musall et al., 2019). Alignment of neural activity data opens up the possibility of incorporating functional evidence into the mostly anatomical-based parcellation schemes used for the mouse brain.\n\nCCFv3 is a fully annotated anatomical reference space provided as a digital open access interactive atlas.

All animals were housed 3–5 per cage, under constant temperature, humidity, and light conditions (12 hr light/dark cycles) and given food and water ad libitum.\n\nMETHOD DETAILS\n\nOverall strategy for anatomical delineations in the CCF.\n\nUnlike the 2D ARA atlas drawn on a single Nissl-stained specimen (Dong, 2008), or Nissl- and AchE-stained specimen (Paxinos and Franklin, 2012), the mouse brain atlas built in this study was manually drawn in 3D space on the average template using multimodal reference datasets (described below). In the average template, we identified many structures with distinct inherent contrast features that directly guided border delineations (e.g., primary sensory cortices and dentate gyrus). However, the borders of many other structures, such as higher visual cortical areas, are not visible in the template alone. These “invisible” (as well as the “visible”) structures were delineated with the aid of multimodal reference data: transgenic and connectivity datasets, cytoarchitecture, chemoarchitecture, and in situ hybridization data. We additionally consulted the MBSC and ARA atlases and relevant literature for each brain structure. When conflicts between these two atlases occurred, or when delineation schemes did not exist in either atlas, additional literature was consulted prior to determining borders using our own reference data in the average template.\n\nReference Datasets\n\nThe average template.\n\nThe average template was generated from autofluorescence background signal in the red channel acquired during STPT imaging from 1,675 mouse brains with a final voxel resolution of 10 μm. This volume was annotated to assign every voxel to an anatomical structure. The average template has lower x-y spatial resolution compared to the ARA Nissl-stained specimen images, where one can see size, shape, and density of cells more clearly. Notably, the original STPT images do have high (0.35 μm) x-y resolution, and, in these images, cell nuclei appear darker than the cytoplasm. Thus, in the average template, “dark” and “light” areas often reflect cell density, but not necessarily shape or size as in Nissl-stained specimens. Specifically, we see that structures with relatively densely packed cells are light, such as layer 4 of the primary sensory cortical areas. By contrast, structures with sparse cells are relatively dark, such as fiber tracts which are even darker than gray matter structures ( , – ). There are a few notable exceptions, including the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus. The pyramidal layer is composed of very densely packed cells. Since individual cell nuclei are dark, the many dark nuclei merge together in the averaging and downsampling in x-y to 10 μm voxels, and so form the dark band-like appearance of the pyramidal layer. Also, since cell cytoplasm appears “light” in the STPT autofluorescence background, and the gray matter contains more cell bodies than fiber tracts, the gray matter itself is lighter than fiber tracts (which are very dark) in the average template.\n\nTransgenic Mice.\n\nTransgenic lines were generated at the Allen Institute (Madisen et al., 2010) or imported from external sources including the GENSAT project (Gerfen et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2007) and are listed in the . Cre driver lines were crossed with the Cre-dependent tdTomato expressing reporter line Ai14, Ai110 or Ai140 (Madisen et al., 2010; Daigle et al., 2018). Regulatable Cre lines were induced with TAM or TMP 1–2 weeks before perfusion. Brains were perfused at an average age of P56 (min – max: P50 – P131), imaged by STPT, and registered to the 3D average template brain. Experiments were curated for those with (1) enriched gene expression in the structures that we wanted to delineate and (2) successful registration to the average template determined by visual inspection of alignment results. High resolution images are available through links in Table S3. Registered grid files, cortical surface views, and instructions for using ITK-SNAP to view them are also available here: (http://download.alleninstitute.org/publications/allen_mouse_brain_common_coordinate_framework/).\n\nREAGENT or RESOURCESOURCEIDENTIFIERAntibodiesRabbit polyclonal anti-Calbindin D-28k (Calb1)SwantCat#CB38; RRID: AB_2721225Mouse monoclonal anti-NeuNMillipore SigmaCat#MAB377; RRID: AB_2298772Rabbit polyclonal anti-Neurofilament, Medium, 160 kD (NF-160)AbeamCat#AB9034; RRID: AB_306956Rabbit polyclonal anti-ParvalbuminSwantCat#PV 25; RRID: AB_10000344Mouse monoclonal anti-Neurofilament H (SMI-32)CovanceCat#SMI-32R-100; RRID: AB_509997Mouse monoclonal anti-Myelin Basic Protein (SMI-99)CovanceCat#SMI-99P; RRID: AB_2564742Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbitThermo Fisher ScientificCat#A-11008; RRID: AB_10563748Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouseThermo Fisher ScientificCat#A-11005; RRID: AB_2534073Bacterial and Virus StrainsAAV2/1.hSynapsin.EGFP.WPRE.bGHUPenn Vector CoreAddgene AAV1; 105539; RRID:Addgene_105539AAV2/1.CAG.FLEX.EGFP.WPRE.bGHUPenn Vector CoreAddgene AAV1; 51502; RRID: Addgene_51502Chemicals, Peptides, and Recombinant ProteinsTrimethoprim (TMP)Sigma-AldrichT7883–5GTamoxifen (TAM)Sigma-AldrichT5648–5GExperimental Models: Organisms/StrainsMouse: C57BL/6JThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 000664Mouse: B6.Cg-Tg(A930038C07Rik-cre) 1Aibs/J, A930038C07Rik-Tg1-CreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 017346Mouse: Adcyap1–2A-CreAllen Institute for Brain ScienceN/AMouse: B6;129S-Calb1tm2.1(cre)Hze/J,Calb1-IRES2-CreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 028532Mouse: B6.Cg-Calb1tm1.1(folA/EGFP/cre)Hze/J,Calb1-T2A-dgCreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 023531Mouse: B6(Cg)-Calb2tm1(cre)Zjh/J,Calb2-IRES-CreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 010774Mouse: B6;129S-Cartpttm1.1(cre)Hze/J, Cart-IRES2-CreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 028533Mouse: STOCK Tg(Cartpt-cre)1Aibs/J, Cart-Tg1-CreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 009615Mouse: B6(Cg)-Ccktm2.1(cre/ERT2)Zjh/J, Cck-IRES-CreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 012706Mouse: B6;129S6-Chattm1(cre)Low1/j,Chat-IRES-Cre-neoThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 006410Mouse: STOCK Tg(Chma2-cre)OE25Gsat/Mmucd, Chma2-Cre_OE25MMRRCMMRRC: 036502Mouse: STOCK Tg(Cnnm2-cre)KD18Gsat/Mmucd, Cnnm2-Cre_KD18MMRRCMMRRC: 030951Mouse: Crh-IRES-Cre_BLBradford LowellN/AMouse: B6(Cg)-Crhtm1(cre)Zjh/J, Crh-IRES-Cre_ZJHThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 012704Mouse: B6.Cg-Ctgftm1.1(folA/cre)Hze/J, Ctgf-2A-dgCreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 028535Mouse: B6(Cg)-Cux2tm3.1(cre/ERT2)Mull/Mmmh, Cux2-CreERT2MMRRCMMRRC: 032779Mouse: B6(Cg)-Cux2tm1.1(cre)Mull/Mmmh, Cux2-IRES-CreMMRRCMMRRC: 031778Mouse: STOCK Tg(Dbh-cre)KH212Gsat/Mmcd, Dbh-Cre_KH212MMRRCMMRRC: 032081Mouse: STOCK Tg(Dlg3-cre)KG118Gsat/Mmucd, Dlg3-Cre_KG118MMRRCMMRRC: 032809Mouse: Drd1a-CreRichard PalmiterN/AMouse: STOCK Tg(Drd3-cre)KI196Gsat, Drd3-Cre_KI196MMRRCMMRRC: 034610Mouse: STOCK Tg(Drd3-cre)KI198Gsat/Mmucd, Drd3-Cre_KI198MMRRCMMRRC: 031741Mouse: STOCK Tg(Efr3a-cre)NO108Gsat/Mmucd, Efr3a-Cre_NO108MMRRCMMRRC: 036660Mouse: B6.129S2-Emx1tm1(cre)Krj/J, Emx1-IRES-CreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 005628Mouse: B6.Cg-Erbb4tm1.1(cre/ERT2)Albs/j, Erbb4–2A-CreERT2The Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 012360Mouse: Esr1–2A-CreDavid AndersonN/AMouse: B6;129S-Esr2tm1.1(cre)Hze/J, Esr2-IRES2-CreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 030158Mouse: B6(Cg)-Etv1tm1.1(cre/ERT2)Zjh/J, Etv1-CreERT2The Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 013048Mouse: B6;129S-Fezf1tm1.1(cre/folA)Hze/J, Fezf1–2A-dCreThe Jackson LaboratoryJAX: 013048Mouse: Fezf2-CreERZ.

Viruses are listed in the . Brains were perfused and collected 3 weeks post-injection at P56 (or post-TAM or TMP induction for regulatable lines). Experiments were curated for those that provided useful information on regions or their borders. In brief, we chose datasets which (1) contained strong (dense) projections to target structure(s) that we wanted to delineate. (2) injections were mostly restricted to a single brain region (little secondary infection in neighboring structures), and (3) registration precision to the average template was considered good following expert visual inspection. We did not use a specific quantitative threshold for injection size as the appropriate volume varies by brain structure volume, but we selected those that came closest to filling up a single region, because this shows the largest innervated territories in the target structure. Data can be found in the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas database (http://connectivity.brain-map.org) using experiment IDs or links provided in Table S3.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry.\n\nHistological staining (Nissl and Acetylcholinesterase) and fluorescent double-immunohistochemistry were described previously (Wang et al., 2014). Antibodies used are listed in the . Perfused P56 C57BL/6J brains were cryostat sectioned at 25 μm with a final sampling density of 50 μm. Colorometric stained slides were imaged with a 10× objective on a ScanScope (Aperio Technologies). Fluorescent immunohistochemistry slides were imaged on a VS series multichannel fluorescence microscope (Olympus) with a 10× objective. Image series were registered to the 3D average template brain. Data can be found in the Allen Reference Data database (http://connectivity.brain-map.org/static/referencedata).\n\nIn Situ Hybridization.\n\nAll in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed via a standardized production platform that was previously described (Lein et al., 2007). Fresh frozen brains from male P56 C57BL/6J mice were cryostat sectioned at 25 μm with a final sampling density of 200 μm.The colorometric stained slides were imaged with a 10× objective on a ScanScope (Aperio Technologies). Due to the sampling density, images were not registered to the 3D average template brain, but plane matched sections were analyzed side-by-side. Data were selected using AGEA, Fine Structure Search, Gene Search and Differential Search tools in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas database (http://mouse.brain-map.org), and the specific data selected can be viewed using experiment IDs or links provided in Table S3.\n\nAdministration of tamoxifen or trimethoprim.\n\nSome Cre driver lines contain regulatable versions of Cre recombinase. Induction of CreERT2 driver lines was done by administration of 0.2 mg/g body weight of tamoxifen (TAM) solution (50 mg/ml in corn oil) via oral gavage once per day for 5 consecutive days. Induction of DHFR-domain containing (dCre or dgCre) driver lines was done by administration of 0.3 mg/g body weight of trimethoprim (TMP) solution (20mg/ml in DMSO/methylcellulose) via oral gavage once per day for 3 consecutive days.\n\nSerial two-photon tomography (STPT) imaging.\n\nSTPT imaging of mouse brains was performed via a standardized production platform using the TissueCyte 1000 system (TissueVision) coupled with a Mai Tai HP DeepSee laser (Spectra Physics) that was previously described (Oh et al., 2014; Ragan et al., 2012). Single optical plane images 75 μm below the tissue surface were acquired using 925 nm wavelength light through a Zeiss 320 water immersion objective (NA=1.0), with 250 mW light power at objective. To scan a full tissue section, individual tile images were acquired at a resolution of 2080×2080 pixels, and the entire stage was moved between each tile. Following scanning of a full tissue section, a 100 μm section was cut by vibratome and the imaging process repeated. A total of 140 coronal sections covering the rostral-to-caudal extent of the brain, are scanned in red, green, and blue channels using a 20× objective, at an x,y resolution of 0.35 μm per pixel.\n\nAverage template construction and image registration.\n\nThe CCFv3 spatial template is constructed as a population average of 1,675 young adult mouse brains imaged using STPT as part of the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas pipeline, following procedures described in detail previously (Kuan et al., 2015). For hemispheric symmetry and to maximize input data used in the averaging process, each hemisphere was reflected across the midline, resulting in a total of 3,350 image series (= 2 × 1,675 brains). Each image series were first globally registered to the template created for the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas data processing pipeline (Kuan et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2014). The process for global registration consists of three steps: (1) coarse registration initialized by matching the image moments of the specimen and the template brain; (2) subsequent rigid (in terms of rotation and translation) registration; and (3) a 12-parameter affine (linear) registration. Each registration step aims to maximize and normalize mutual information of the intensity between the specimen and the template. A multi-resolution scheme was used to first register on smoothed and downsampled versions of the images in order to smooth out details to drive the algorithm to match large-scale shape features. The results from one resolution initializes the next resolution and so on allowing finer details to be matched. After global alignment, the specimens were averaged to create the first iteration of the CCFv3 template which effectively provide initial orientation and scale. An iterative process then (1) registers each specimen deformably to the template and subsequently averages all specimens, (2) computes the average deformation field over all specimens and subtracts this result from the average image created in step (1). This shape and intensity normalized average is then used as the anatomical template in the next iteration. This algorithm continued until the mean magnitude of the average deformation field fell below a certain threshold and stabilized.\n\nDeformable registration can easily become trapped in a local minimum especially when there is specimen damage and hence a coarse-to-fine approach is essential. In this process, deformations between specimen and template was parameterized as 3D B-splines (order of 3) where the knots are placed on a regularly spaced 3D grid. A coarse grid implicitly only allows smooth/stiff deformations while a finer grid allows more elastic transformations allowing local neighborhoods to be more accurately matched in later stages. The optimization problem (optimal position of the knots) was formulated and solved as a graph labeling problem (Glocker et al., 2008; Tang and Chung, 2007). Instead of considering all the possible continuous moves of each knot, the searching space is discretized into a number of grids represented by labels. This implementation has higher probability to find the global minimum as compared to gradient-based methods. Like in Avants et al. (2008), the registration was performed in both directions and then composed to form the final transform, resulting in a symmetric and invertible deformation field. Cross-correlation is used as the image similarity metric and to speed up computation; it was only evaluated on a small portion of randomly selected voxels.\n\nAll datasets, except for ISH data, were registered and mapped to the 3D average template through global and local alignment as previously described (Kuan et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2014).\n\nGeneration of the curved cortical coordinate system with Laplace’s Equation.\n\nTo delineate isocortical areas, we first drew the outside borders of the isocortex, then marked its inner and outer surface. We applied Laplace’s Equation to the isocortex volume to generate the equidistance fields. The steepest lines perpendicular to the equidistance fields are called streamlines. Streamlines can be used to project data at various locations through the cortical depth, e.g., the maximum density of the average template, transgenic lines or connectivity data labeling, to counterparts on the isocortical surface. The curved cortical coordinate system based on these streamlines was used to delineate isocortical areas.\n\nGeneration of visuotopic map and virtual callosal labeling.\n\nVisuotopic maps and callosal labeling patterns have been used to define visual cortical areas in mammalian brains. We utilized projection data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas to generate a visuotopic map and virtual callosal labeling. First, we selected viral tracer injections covering different visual fields in VISp (n = 26, experiment IDs in Table S3). 3D volumes of registered and downsampled projection densities from each experiment were combined to create a color-coded, weighted, source location map. This visuotopic map was used for delineation of higher visual areas in surface views. Second, because callosal labeling has a unique spatial relationship with the higher visual areas (Wang and Burkhalter, 2007), a virtual callosal projection pattern was generated with a set of injections in the isocortex in one hemisphere (n = 107, experiment IDs in Table S3). A projection density map was created by finding, at each voxel, the maximum density value over all injections. A surface view was then generated by considering only signal within 0.1 to 0.5 mm normalized cortical depths and projecting the largest maximum value to the surface. The virtual callosal labeling pattern further restricts boundaries of the higher visual areas, although to a lesser extent than in previous studies likely due to the density of injections (Wang and Burkhalter, 2007; Wang et al., 2012).\n\nAnnotation of brain structures in 3D.\n\nBrain structures were reconstructed on the average template (at 10 μm isotropic voxel resolution) using the multi-plane and 3D viewers in the annotation software ITK-SNAP (www.itksnap.org, Yushkevich et al., 2006). As multiple structures were reconstructed, custom macros for merging and splitting individual files were utilized to facilitate group delineations and adjustments at local and global levels. In the last step, right hemisphere 3D reconstructions were mirrored to the left hemisphere to render a symmetrically complete 3D brain atlas. Additional detailed information on the process implemented for 3D reconstruction of brain structures can be found at the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas documentation page (http://help.brain-map.org/display/mouseconnectivity/Documentation, Mouse CCF, Reference Atlas, Version 3 (2017)) and in Wang et al., (2017).\n\nUse of registration deformation fields to estimate structure volumes and to map CCFv3 annotations on individual brains.\n\nThe AllenSDK can be used to implement analyses and visualizations not available through the interactive atlas viewer web application. We described two examples of the kinds of tools that one can develop using the CCFv3 and the AllenSDK. First, we provide an example to map and visualize CCFv3 annotations onto the original image space from an individual specimen. This example is demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook provided at: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/3D-atlasreverse-mapping. In brief, using the registration parameters obtained for any Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas specimen through the AllenSDK, a mask of the whole brain in the reference space is mapped back to a specimen’s image space. This is used to identify the sections of the coronal atlas that map to the original coronal imaged section of interest. Next, these sections of the atlas and their corresponding deformation vectors are used to map each annotated voxel from the atlas onto the corresponding imaged section. The atlas and deformation fields have a resolution of 25×25×25 microns, while the imaged sections have a resolution of 0.35×0.35×100 microns. Thus, it is also necessary to convert the scales so that voxels map to the correct pixels in the imaged sections. Since the value of each voxel corresponds to a structure ID in our ontology, individual structures present in the imaged section can be analyzed and visualized. Second, we provide the scripts used to estimate structure volumes in individual brain specimens at: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/CCFv3_Volumetric_Analysis/. The script “find_structure_surface_mesh.py” uses the marching cubes algorithm to produce vertices and faces of a structure’s surface mesh, given its CCFv3 ID. These vertices and faces have already been calculated and stored under the “/data/” directory in the linked repository. Next, the scripts “find_structure_volume.py” and “find_structure_surface_area.py” take a structure ID and experiment ID and generate the respective volume or surface area. This is achieved by loading the deformation field for an individual experiment from the AllenSDK and applying it to a given structure’s surface mesh. Once a structure is mapped to the specimen’s image space, the volume or surface area is calculated.\n\nQUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe CCFv3 average template was constructed from the brains of n=1,675 mice. Using the Python NumPy package, we calculated descriptive statistics for the estimates of brain and structure volumes across this population, including: mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation, as well as mean, median, and lower and upper bounds of the interquartile range relative to the average template volume. Values are provided in Table S4. Most multimodal imaging experiments were n=1 animal per transgenic line, viral tracer injection into a given source, histology stain or ISH gene probe. All individual animal IDs are provided in Table S3.\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n\nDetailed protocol descriptions for all procedures can be found at the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas documentation page (http://help.brain-map.org//display/mouseconnectivity/Documentation).

(A) Dorsal and (B) lateral views of the whole brain ventricular system reconstructed in 3D. Ventricles are labeled (VL: lateral ventricle, V3: third ventricle, AQ: cerebral aqueduct, V4: fourth ventricle, c: central canal). Dashed lines indicate level of coronal section shown in D–R. (C) Nissl-stained sagittal section near the midline showing the AQ, 4V, and choroid plexus (chpl). Note the ventricle-like AQ just below the inferior colliculus (IC). (D–H) Virtual coronal sections of the average template. Differential contrast features reveal ventricles (dark/black), although they are similar in intensity to many putative fiber tracts (lower case abbreviations; ac: anterior commissure, int: internal capsule, mlf: medial longitudinal fascicle, sV: sensory root of the trigeminal nerve, VIIn: facial nerve, icp: inferior cerebellar peduncle, sptV: spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve). (I–M) Coronal Nissl-stained sections at corresponding locations to above template images show each ventricle location and shape and contains features that more easily distinguish white matter tracts. (N–R) Coronal STPT images of tdTomato reporter expression from the Slc17a8-IRES2-Cre line, which labels the ependymal cells lining the ventricles and central canal.

(A,B) Maximum intensity projection (lateral and dorsal view) of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons labeled with viral tracer into the left eye of a Thy1-Cre driver mouse to reveal central projections brain-wide. Dashed lines indicate coronal, sagittal, and horizontal levels in E–T. (C,D) Lateral views of the final reconstruction of LGd into 3 subdivisions; shell, core, and ipsilateral projection zone (ip). The ip, located medial and ventral to the shell, and dorsal to the core is shown in (D) after making the shell partially transparent. (E–H) Coronal STPT images through the LGd, showing tdTomato reporter expression in a Calb2-IRES-Cre mouse (F) or RGC axonal projections labeled from different Cre driver transgenic lines as indicated. Ipsilaterally-projecting Thy1-Cre+ RGCs terminate in a discrete location within LGd (ip; E, section was flipped to match hemisphere shown in F–H). The ip is also visible as the area with sparse to no input from the contralateral retina in the Kcng4-Cre and Cart-Tg1-Cre lines (G,H). Calb2-IRES-Cre reporter expression is enriched in the shell region at the dorsolateral surface (F). The shell region also contains direction-selective RGC axons labeling in the Cart1-Tg1-Cre line (H), whereas the relatively denser labeling of Kcng4-Cre+ alpha-RGC axons in ventromedial LGd defines the core (G). (I–K) Virtual single plane sections (coronal, sagittal, horizontal) of the average template through the LGd. The dorsolateral edge of the LGd is the brightest part in the template, but subdivisions are not otherwise recognizable. (L–N) The transgenic and anterograde tracing Cre line experiments in E and F were registered and overlaid with the average template. 3D views of the reference data provided critical assistance in the non-coronal planes, in this case, further supporting the delineations of borders between LGd-sh and LGd-ip. (O–Q) The two anterograde tracer datasets in G and H were registered to and visualized in the average template volume, which helped to further define the LGd-sh and LGd-co. (R–T) Integrating information from the above multimodal reference data, the LGd was divided into three sub-regions shown here in coronal, sagittal and horizontal planes.

(A) An interactive hierarchal tree shows the complete ARA ontology. Acronyms and full structure names in the ontology are in black text for the structures annotated in CCFv3; structure names shown in light gray italics indicate structures that exist in the ARA ontology, but were not delineated for CCFv3. Clicking on any acronym in the side bar of the ontology tree highlights the corresponding structure in the interactive 2D atlas (and vice versa). For example, “PO” is highlighted in (A), and this structure is visible in B and C (purple). (B) One of 132 2D atlas coronal plates. (C) The coronal image of the average template corresponding to the atlas plate and annotations in B. (D–I) Images of an anterograde viral tracing experiment with projections to PO (D), Nissl (E), AChE (F), antibodies against NeuN and NF-160 (G), Calb1 and SMI-99 (H), and Pvalb and SMI-32 (I) are shown synced with the interactive 2D atlas plate and the average template image shown in B,C. To sync images, the user defines the alignment position on the data image by placing it in the center the viewing window. The “sync” service translates this image location into a CCFv3 coordinate using databased transforms. The service then determines the best matched image position within the atlas sections. The atlas view is updated such that the best match location is in the center of view and at a zoom level similar to the data view. Annotations in the 2D atlas can thus be compared side-by-side with these registered multimodal reference datasets.\n\nClick here to view.(548K, pdf)\n\n8\n\nTable S1.

Visualization of isocortical anatomical features using curved streamlines, related to . (A–D) Virtual flatmap views summarize and visualize variability of different features across the entire isocortical sheet in 2D. (A) rotational angles of the streamlines, (B) cortical thickness, (C) tilt, and (D) the average template with final parcellations. The flatmap is generated by first constructing a 3D-to-2D mapping, such that the 2D Euclidean distance of every point on the flatmap to a pair of anchor points are the same as their 3D geodesic distance (shortest path along the surface). This process is repeated for another pair of anchor points, with each pair forming an axis of the flattened cortical coordinate space. Stars in (D) show the location of the injection centroids for tracing experiments shown in E–V. (E–G) Three serial coronal STPT images, spaced 100 μm apart, are shown around the approximate center of a viral tracer injection into SSp-n (z=0, panel F) in the Sim1-Cre_KJ18 line, which labels L5 thick-tufted excitatory neurons. (H–J) These original image data were segmented, downsampled, and registered to the CCF to generate a whole brain voxel-level projection density volume. Images show virtual 100 μm coronal sections from the registered images. (K) shows a sagittal view of the maximum projection density in the registered dataset near the injection site, revealing how the apical dendrites of the infected cells in this location curve in an angle non-orthogonal to the coronal plane (anteriorly). (L–N) shows the path for a subset of computed streamlines in three consecutive 100 μm coronal sections of the average template. Note that these are not complete lines extending from pia to white matter in any single section at this cortical location.
