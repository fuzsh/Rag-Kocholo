        "text": "This easy to use, interactive mapping application does not require any GIS skills to use and provides ready access to 500+ maps and multiple analysis tools.\n\nNeed help getting started?\n\nView tutorials for using the Interactive Map.\n\nSee what data we have available.\n\nLearn how the data are organized.\n\nSee examples of how others used our data.\n\nExplore Data:\n\nTools in the Interactive Map\n\nRaindrop | Select a location and see the general raindrop flow path and distance to the nearest water feature as depicted in the National Hydrography Dataset Plus V2.\n\nHUC Navigation | Identify upstream or downstream 12-digit HUCs within the stream network from any given point in the conterminous US.\n\nElevation Profile | View the elevation profile of a selected line segment.\n\nTime Series Viewer | View historic and future environmental variables from 1950 - 2099 in a time-enabled animated map.\n\nCompare My Area | View summarized information for your watershed or Census tract compared to the surrounding county and state.\n\nSelect | Select and view information for certain census block groups or HUC-12s by drawing a rectangle, polygon, or line.\n\nSummarize My Area | Calculate summary statistics for landcover and landcover change for your own customized areas\n\nData Organization\n\nEnviroAtlas contains over 500 data layers for users to explore. Data in our Interactive Map are organized into five main tabs:\n\nFeatured Collections\n\nEnviroAtlas Data\n\nDemographic Data\n\nTime Series Layers\n\nAdd Data\n\nFeatured Collections\n\nFeatured Collections are clusters of data that highlight different environmental decision-making scenarios. These subsets of data allow users to explore and understand a curated selection of data around a topic of interest. Click the title for the available Featured Collections below to open them directly in the Interactive Map.\n\nAgricultural Erosion and Sediment-Impaired Waterways\n\nAPA Metrics for Planning Healthy Communities\n\nBuilding a Greenway: A Case Study\n\nCommunity Resilience: An Assessment of Assets, Vulnerabilities, and Natural Hazards\n\nEnviroAtlas for Brownfields\n\nNitrogen Inputs to Watersheds\n\nUrban Heat Islands and Vulnerable Populations\n\nWatershed Resource Registries & EnviroAtlas\n\nEnviroAtlas Data\n\nThe majority of the 500+ datasets found in EnviroAtlas are developed in-house by the EnviroAtlas team, and with partners. Sometimes helpful outside datasets, such as Protected Lands or GAP data, are also provided as web services in the interactive map.\n\nEnviroAtlas data are organized into one of four categories, based on the type of information they cover.\n\nEcosystem Services and Biodiversity\n\nEcosystem Services and Biodiversity data also have one or more assigned ecosystem service benefit categories to indicate their linkages to the supply, demand, and drivers of change associated with ecosystem services. Learn more.\n\nPollution Sources and Impacts\n\nPollution Sources and Impacts data provide information on various pollutants, facilities reporting to EPA for pollutants, and impacted waterways. The individual data categories are as follows:\n\nEPA Regulated Facilities: Contains data from different facilities that report to EPA about air pollution, hazardous waste sites, Superfund, etc.\n\nImpaired Waters: Shows national 303d impaired waters and stream length impaired by various contaminants, summarized by HUC12.\n\nNational Air Toxics Assessment: EnviroAtlas provides a selection of the National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) 2014 estimates for ambient concentrations and health-effect results by 2010 census tracts, counties, and states. This dataset is based on data from 2014 NATA, which was produced by the US EPA to estimate health risks from toxic air pollutants.\n\nPollutants: Nutrients: Includes national data for nitrogen and phosphorus inputs and other data related to nutrient pollution\n\nPollutants: Other: Contains national data for pollutants other than nutrients.\n\nPeople and Built Spaces\n\nContains data related to the built environment, including commuting and vacancy rates.\n\nCommuting and Walkability: Contains national and community extent data on commuting, travel times, and walkability indicators.\n\nEmployment: Contains national extent data on employment and workers.\n\nHousing and Schools: Contains national and community extent data on facilities such as daycare centers and schools.\n\nPopulation Distribution: Includes dasymetric allocation of population and population by HUC12.\n\nQuality of Life: Includes income thresholds for quality of life. These data are available by census block group for the nation.\n\nVacancy: Includes metrics on residential and business vacancy rates.\n\nBoundaries\n\nEcologic Boundaries: Includes GAP Ecological Systems and USEPA Ecoregions\n\nHydrologic Features: Includes Hydrologic Unit Code boundaries and labels, the NHD Plus V2 dataset, and waterscapes data\n\nPolitical Boundaries: Includes political boundaries (congressional districts, states, counties, census block groups), EnviroAtlas community boundaries, Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, and USEPA Regions.\n\nDemographic Layers\n\nThe Demographic widget contains hundreds of demographic datasets sourced from the 2012-2016 American Community Survey (ACS) & the US 2000 & 2010 Census. The widget contains:\n\nhundreds of demographic variables\n\nuser-preferred symbology (choropleth OR markers)\n\nand scale-dependent data displays that recalculate by state, county, census tract, or census block group when the map is zoomed in or out\n\nTime Series Layers\n\nClimate Projections out to 2099 & Historical Climate Data 1950 - 2005\n\nThe NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) scientific collaboration platform has made available downscaled CMIP5 climate projections for the conterminous United States with a spatial grid resolution of 800 meters. The EnviroAtlas team has converted these large complex files into a geospatial format and has made them available through two tools in the EnviroAtlas Interactive Map. Each tool includes four RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and four climate variables (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration).\n\nAdd Data\n\nAdd Data allows users to easily bring outside data into the EnviroAtlas mapping application. Users can search for and add available web services, input a known URL, or add data from their local machine."
