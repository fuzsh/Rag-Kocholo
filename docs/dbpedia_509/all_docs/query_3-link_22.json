The “CITY_NM” column indicates the city, if applicable, and “NAME” provides the information on the county in which the polygon is located. “AUPolyID” provides the WRIA Watershed Characterization Project Assessment Unit number in which the Polygon is located. The “LUCodeID” and “SubCID” fields correspond to polygon identification numbers contained in the attribute table for the housing unit map layers.\n\nWhile all counties have seen a drop in rural development rates happening after 2010, some rates of reduction are more pronounced than others. For instance, Kitsap and Skagit counties both saw rural housing development rates decrease by 75% when comparing the 2001-2009 period with 2010-2017.\n\nIn terms of the gross number of units added in rural areas, Pierce, Snohomish and Thurston is increasing by over 200 units per year, with recent rural development in Snohomish and Pierce counties at over 300 units per year; indicating significant growth pressure in these locations.\n\nRegional rural development appears to be happening close to the urban growth boundary with about half (47%) of the total amount occurring within two miles of the urban growth boundary. In addition, the Urban Edge sub-category (which contains low-density residential development ranging from one unit per acre up to one unit per 4.9 acres predominantly located in rural areas) is seeing growth occurring at a gross density of 167 units per square mile. Rate of development in Urban Edge areas is over half (60%) of that seen in Urban Residential areas (which are zoned at significantly higher densities). This may indicate disproportionate development pressure in these areas.\n\nAbout 18 percent of all housing development since 2001, or 78,959 units, has occurred in rural areas. The land use categories that primarily correspond with rural areas that have seen significant development include the Active Open Space, Agricultural Areas, Forest Lands and Rural Residential Areas. Rural Residential areas have predominantly accommodated rural growth with over 86 percent happening in these locations. Active Open Space, Agricultural Areas, and Forest Lands saw 2,000 to 4,300 new housing units and accounted for an additional 12 percent of rural development.\n\nBased upon estimates by the Washington State Office of Financial Management, it appears that almost 30 percent of single-family housing development occurred outside of Urban Residential land use categories. This seems to indicate that despite the reduction in growth within rural areas, a significant number of new single-family homes are not being developed in urban growth areas.\n\nWithin Urban Areas, growth split almost equally between Urban Residential (predominately single-family housing) and Intensive Urban Areas (predominately multi-family units). The amount of growth in Intensive Urban areas is virtually equal with the increase in multi-family units estimated by the Washington State Office of Financial Management. As a result, it is unlikely that significant apartment development occurred in other categories.\n\nCentral urban centers such as Seattle, Bellevue and Tacoma are experiencing rapid growth. Over half of growth within Intensive Urban Areas occurred in these cities. In Seattle, this rate of growth is accelerating with about 50% more development happening annually since 2010 (compared to annual rates between 2001 and 2009). In Bellevue and Tacoma, however, annual development rates appear to have dropped since 2010.\n\nMulti-family development, in general, appears to be highly concentrated within King, Pierce and Snohomish counties. These three counties accounted for 89 percent of new multi-family units within the Puget Sound Region.\n\nWithin Urban Residential areas, it appears that some areas are realizing density levels that are close to maximum ranges allowed by zoning. This appears to be especially true in locations where Master Planned Developments (MPDs), such as Issaquah Highlands and Redmond Ridge, have been recently built out. In some areas, infill single-family development does not appear to be as robust as nearby locations. There are multiple possible reasons why these growth rates vary by location and supplemental research is needed help determine which of these factors could be addressed through planning efforts.\n\nThere are some efforts underway already to dig deeper into the factors affecting regional growth patterns. For instance, the Puget Sound Institute is beginning a research study to look at growth occurring near the urban growth boundary. This study will help determine what may influence developers to build new units within or outside of urban growth areas. Contingent upon funding, Commerce would like to assess the degree to which lack of sewer systems (or reliance upon septic systems) may be influencing location of new development. The Puget Sound Regional Council has undertaken efforts such as the Housing Innovations Program to evaluate measures that could boost development in urban centers.\n\nEach jurisdiction will likely be able to use the Puget Sound Mapping Project data to isolate unique questions about their development patterns that may deserve further investigation. Commerce hopes that these maps and data could help cities and counties fine tune things such as zoning, capital facility plans and implementation measures to improve the correlation of growth with land use plans."
