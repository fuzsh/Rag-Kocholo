        "text": "The first lands acquired for Yellow River State Forest were purchased in 1935 with funds that were appropriated to support the Civilian Conservation Corps (C.C.C.). The original purchase was adjacent to the Yellow River near its confluence with the Mississippi and the name \"Yellow River Forest\" was appropriate. In 1949, 1500 acres of the Forest was transferred to the National Park Service and became a part of Effigy Mounds National Monument. The larger units of the state forest are now located in the Paint Creek watershed, north of Yellow River. Subsequent land purchases consolidated scattered tracts and today the forest is 8,503 acres in size.\n\nBecause most land purchased was farmland and pasture, the early management of Yellow River Forest was concerned with protection from grazing, fire and soil erosion. Timber harvests provided material that the C.C.C. used for construction on state parks and other state areas.\n\nDuring the 1940s, most of the open land was planted to trees. The plantations of large pines that can be seen on the forest today are the result of these efforts. The extensive system of fire lanes that provided protection to these plantations serves today as part of the recreational trail system for hiking, cross country skiing, horse riding and snowmobiling.\n\nIn 1947, a sawmill, which the Forestry Division continues to operate was moved to the Paint Creek Unit from Pikes Peak State Park. All the trees processed at the mill are harvested from state land and the lumber used on state parks and wildlife areas, other DNR areas, sold to other state agencies or sold to private individuals. About $20,000 worth of lumber is transferred each year to units of the DNR and another $10,000 worth of lumber is sold each year to other units of government.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, outdoor recreation became more important on the forest. Camping and picnic areas were developed. Access to the area for hunters, fishers and other outdoor recreationists was improved. Trail systems were extended to accommodate horses and hikers. For a time, there was a trail ride concession where visitors could rent horses to ride.\n\nYellow River Forest is located in a physiographic region called the Paleozoic Plateau. This region includes northwestern Illinois, southwestern Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota. It covers most of Allamakee County (in which Yellow River State Forest is located) and parts of Clayton, Fayette, Winneshiek, Howard, Dubuque, and Jackson Counties.\n\nIn contrast to most of Iowa, which is covered by deep deposits of glacial drift, the dominant feature of the surface of the Paleozoic Plateau is limestone and sandstone bedrock.\n\nFor many years, and even today, the term \"driftless area\" was used, reflecting the belief that this region had never been glaciated. Thin, isolated areas of glacial drift do occur in the area, however. This drift is probably pre-Illinoian in age and approximately half a million years old. The ruggedness and deep dissection of the landscape is due to the elements having been at work for that period of time.\n\nMuch of Yellow River Forest is marked by rugged terrain with numerous rock outcrops, bluffs and steep slopes. On the major upland divides between drainages, the bedrock is overlaid to varying depths with pre-Illinoian glacial till and this in turn is overlain with Wisconsinan loess of various thickness.\n\nValleys are narrow and \"V-shaped\" except along major drainages where they may be quite wide.\n\nA brief summary of the geology of Yellow River State Forest and surrounding region is presented in a publication titled \"The Archeology of Clayton County, Iowa\", by Bear Creek Archeology, Inc., Cresco, Iowa. Several useful publications are referenced.\n\nFor topographic maps of Yellow River State Forest, please contact the Iowa Geological and Water Survey at 319-335-1575. Map titles covering Yellow River State Forest are: Waterville, Harpers Ferry, Giard, and Prairie Du Chien.\n\nThe original parcels of the state forest were located on either side of the Yellow River near its confluence with the Mississippi. The first lands acquired for Yellow River State Forest were purchased in 1935 with funds that were appropriated to support the Civilian Conservation Corps (C.C.C.). The original purchase was adjacent to the Yellow River near its confluence with the Mississippi and the name \"Yellow River Forest\" was appropriate. In 1949, 1500 acres of the Forest was transferred to the National Park Service and became a part of Effigy Mounds National Monument.\n\nThis left only 200 acres in the Yellow River Unit and a further 160 acres in the Lost 40 Unit that were actually located within the basin of the Yellow River. This was the case until 1990 when the 880 acre Johanningmeir property was purchased adjacent to the old Yellow River Unit. At the time of transfer to the National Park Service the larger units were located in the Paint Creek watershed, north of the Yellow River. This remains the case at present.\n\nThe Paint Creek Unit takes its name from the stream by that name. Most of the area of Yellow River Forest now lays within the Paint Creek watershed. There are two Paint Creeks; Little Paint and Big Paint. These are the streams which figure prominently in recreation such as camping and trout fishing and which are a major feature of the forest. Paint Creek drains all of the Paint Creek Unit and parts of the Luster Heights and Waukon Junction Units.\n\nPaint Rock Unit takes its name from figures painted by Indians on a high, limestone bluff overlooking the Mississippi near the south end of the unit. A Catholic parish located nearby is also known as Paint Rock.\n\nThe Luster Heights Unit takes its name from the family who owned the property at one time.\n\nThe Waukon Junction Unit is named for the once thriving community located at the foot of a bluff at its south end.\n\nThe Yellow River Unit, as has been noted, is located on the Yellow River.\n\nThe names of the 364 Unit, Lost 40 Unit and North 80 Unit were chosen with a curious lack of imagination. These are in the process of being incorporated into the Paint Creek, Luster Heights and Yellow River Units. Highway 364 ran through the 364 Unit, the Lost 40 Unit was neither lost nor 40 acres and the North 80 Unit was merely an 80 acre tract that happened to be located near the north end of the Forest.\n\nThe Mud Hen Unit in named for the duck. It is comprised of Mississippi River islands and sloughs and its exact location is a subject of speculation, there being no easily discernible property boundaries in mid-Mississippi River.\n\nSome of the overlooks are named. The Larkin overlook is located above the farm once operated by the Larkin family. Its barn and granary are the subjects of a rather nice painting by J. Jackson.\n\nThe Little Paint overlook, overlooks the Little Paint campground. The Sawmill overlook gives a view of the forest sawmill and headquarters complex and Big Paint overlook commands a view of the Big Paint campground.\n\nOn the south side of the Big Paint Creek valley, Cedar overlook has no particular reason for being so named."
