Geologic maps show the types and ages of rocks and younger deposits that are found at or near the Earth's surface. This fundamental tool for earth scientists, maps show map units, faults and folds, cross sections, and other regional or local features, depending on map scale. Map data is typically shown on",

        "text": "A geologic map classifies rocks and deposits into geologic map units, that are displayed as colored or patterned areas on the map based on unique rock type, age, or depositional setting.\n\nIn this example, each colored polygon represents a geologic map unit. The unit symbols labelling each polygon signify the units' age, depositional setting, rock type, and formal or informal name. For example, the unit symbol \"Qgtv\" tells us that its age is Quaternary (less than about 2 million years old), it is composed of glacial (g) till (t), and is part of the Vashon Stade (v).\n\nGeologic structures, such as faults and folds, are added to geologic maps to show where the Earth's crust has bent or broken.\n\nFaults\n\nBecause of plate tectonics, formations that make up the Earth's crust are broken along faults. The past motion along faults can be measured from centimeters to kilometers depending upon the age and tectonic setting of the fault. Repeated movement along the fault pulverizes the surrounding rock, producing what is termed “fault gouge” by geologists.\n\nFaults that break Quaternary deposits are considered potentially active or active, depending upon when the fault last moved. Active faults have the potential for rupture during earthquakes—many geologists do detailed study of these features to better estimate the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes along them.\n\nFaults can be classified into three major categories, based on their sense of displacement: normal, reverse, and strike-slip. Different map symbols are used to mark the different types of faults.\n\nAn beach-side outcrop of young unconsolidated deposits disrupted by a strand of the Dabob Bay fault zone, found recently on the western shore of the Toandos Peninsula, near Brinnon.\n\nFolds\n\nFolds are also commonly shown on geologic maps. A fold occurs when originally flat surfaces, such as sedimentary strata, are bent or curved as a result of tectonic movements. It is the trace of the “fold axis” of moderately large to large folds that are commonly displayed on geologic maps. These can be small folds that measure centimeters to meters across or can be so large, they may be viewed from space.\n\nGeologists map the trace of the fold where it meets the Earth's surface.\n\nMaps are made at varied scales. Map scale determines how much territory is shown by a map. For instance, at a scale of 1:100,000, one inch on the map equals 100,000 inches in the real world—about 1.6 miles.\n\nIn Washington State, common geologic map scales are 1:24,000, 1:100,000, and 1:250,000. All of Washington has been mapped at 1:100,000 and 1:250,000 scales, but most of the state remains unmapped at the more detailed 1:24,000 scale. Land owners, planners, decision-makers, and others commonly need information at 1:24,000, or even at a more detailed scale.\n\nUse your mouse to hover over the photo to compare geologic mapping of the Skokomish–Union area in Mason County at various scales. The left map was mapped at 1:100,000 scale and the right map was created at 1:24,000 scale.\n\nA geologic map can only show what is exposed at the surface of the Earth. To show what lays beneath our feet, geologists make cross sections. Cross sections are imaginary slices into the earth that show how rock units or deposits are arranged below the surface. Geologists use structural measurements, data obtained from water well or geotechnical borings, and various types of geophysical information to help determine the geometry of the geologic map units at depth.\n\nGeologists use surficial mapping, structural measurements of the orientations of rocks and faults, water well and geotechnical boring logs, seismic survey data, and various types of geophysical data to construct cross sections.\n\nTo make a geologic map, geologists start with a base map. A base map shows topography, streams, roads, settlements, landmarks, and sometimes land-use patterns like forestlands and urban areas. This geographic information provides the base that geologists use to map geologic units, faults, folds, and other surface geologic features. Commonly, geologists use the appropriately scaled topographic quadrangle maps made available by the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nRemote-sensing images also make useful base maps. There are many types of remote-sensing data, but probably the most useful are aerial photographs and lidar.\n\nLidar, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure the distance to the Earth from the airborne device. This relatively new remote-sensing method allows trees and other masking vegetation to be removed from the aerial image. Lidar is increasingly used along with topographic maps to more accurately locate features in the field and to aid the map user in 'reading' the relationship between the mapped geology and the terrain.\n\nUse your mouse to hover over the photo to compare geologic maps with and without lidar. Lidar enhances the terrain readability—the steepness of the river channel and the identity of other geologic features instantly become obvious."
