        "text": "I just brought home a usable Atlas MF mill, but get a stand with it. What have others done? I have a simple sheet metal stand that I think originally had a small table saw or band saw on it, but it seems kind of shifty for the mill. I am thinking of a box cabinet made of plywood--any other good ideas or suggestions, especially if you have made something similar or can provide a link to something like that??\n\nThanks!\n\nJim\n\ni didn't make my stand it came with mine.\n\nbut, if you take a look at instructables.com there is an anvil stand that could be emulated and built.\n\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Anvil-Stand/\n\nI used a Waterloo bottom tool chest. I put a piece of particle board with about 8 coats of urethane on top of the chest; screwed cleats around the board to capture it on the tool chest. Works great for me, convenient for moving the mill around, lots of storage right under the tool. No problems with accuracy from vibrations or anything.\n\nBruce\n\nI used a Waterloo bottom tool chest.\n\nNot that I need another space taker, but I'm envious of both your mill and its' stand.\n\nIf you have to make something from scratch, 2x4's and 3/4\" plywood will work well. Under the mill, I would use two layers of the plywood topped with a large rectangular serving tray with raised edges. My drill press and arbor press have been on such stands for 35 or 40 years now.\n\nThe factory steel stand is 32\" tall, not counting the lip around the tray on top."
