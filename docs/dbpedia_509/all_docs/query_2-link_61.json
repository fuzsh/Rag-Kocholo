        "text": "This is a new Kasumi Knife Sharpener. It is a handy little sharpener that's necessary to avoid scratching the titanium or polish on any high quality knife. It is easy to use. Simply add a few drops of water to the unit and pull the knife through several times. It features 2 slots, one has a ceramic wheel that turns and one has a diamond wheel that turns. It will sharpen the titanium knives, or any good quality knife blade quickly and easily. It also sharpens ceramic knives by using the diamond wheel only.\n\nThis is our Exclusive 2 piece Kyocera Revolution Knife Set, it includes a 5.5 in. Kyocera Revolution Ceramic Santoku Knife, and a Y peeler, each with Red Handles, these hold an edge without sharpening. The Revolution series feature a colorful handle and a perfect balance. This is a great ceramic knife set, it's very comfortable and easy to use. The weight is about half of steel knives making it comfortable for extended use. The ultra sharp ceramic blade cuts with precision and accuracy every time maintaining a razor-sharp edge for many years. These knives are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic, second in hardness only to diamond, it was originally developed for industrial applications where metal components failed. Chef Notes: These knives are a great choice for Chefs and Gourmet Cooks! A rainbow of colored handles are now available, exclusively at Chef Depot. Limited Time Offer! Free Gift Below! What are you waiting for? Each one of our Revolution knives comes in a beautiful presentation box. We tested several brands of ceramic knives - Here's the results! Kyocera was the only knife sharp enough to meet our demands, the others were too dull or the blades were too thin and brittle. Only Kyocera scored very high in sharpness, quality, workmanship, material and warranty. These knives are a great choice for Chefs and Gourmet Cooks! Ceramics are perfect for slicing, dicing, chopping and mincing meats, garlic, carrots, onions, celery, fruits and more"
