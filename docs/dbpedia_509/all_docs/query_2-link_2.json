The park has 4,000 linear feet of waterfront and approximately 12.5 acres. Amenities include an ADA accessible water dog park and ADA accessible swim area, ADA accessible picnic area, and ADA accessible kayak launch, a playground, restroom facility and picnic shelter, and access to the Centennial Trail. The Forest family donated the original flywheels from this site, they are incorporated into the theme of the park."
