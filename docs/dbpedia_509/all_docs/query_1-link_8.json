By Robert Mills, Of South Carolina, P.A. ... Published by F. Lucas Jr. Baltimore for Mills' Atlas.\n\nPublication Author: Mills, Robert\n\nPublication Date: 1825\n\nPublication Reference: P2570; Sabin 49113; Ristow pp207-219.\n\nPublication Note: 1st edition. 28 District maps, 1 State map. The District maps are derived from surveys done for John Wilson's 1822 Map of South Carolina, also engraved by Tanner. Mills' Atlas is the first State Atlas; it was reissued with slight revisions in 1838. This copy has the signature of Thomas Carr of Georgetown, one of the original subscribers who are listed in the accompanying volume of Statistics of South Carolina, published in 1826. Carr's residence is shown on the map of Georgetown District (which map shows the most signs of use) as well as some ms notations probably by Carr showing new roads, churches, etc. Tanner engraved the District maps and Lucas engraved the State map on the title page. The District maps are very detailed showing land owners, taverns, Churches, mills, roads and some distances along the roads, swamps, mountains - all in the finest Tanner style of engraving. Several of the maps are large - Charleston District is 89x86 cm. Compared to David Burr's Atlas of New York State 1829, Mills' maps are far more detailed. State map has full color; other maps without color. Bound in half leather gray paper covered boards with \"Mills Atlas S. Carolin(a)\" stamped in gold on the spine.\n\nPublication List No: 2792.000\n\nPublication Type: State Atlas\n\nPublication Maps: 29\n\nPublication Height cm: 57\n\nPublication Width cm: 38\n\nImage No: 2792B\n\nDigital images and descriptive data © 2000 by Cartography Associates.
