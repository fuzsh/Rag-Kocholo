Located on the Fox River in the Appleton Flats, this project is part of a larger waterfront development area that includes the Vulcan Heritage Park and the restoration of the Vulcan power plant. The 2004 renovation converted the 52,000 square-foot former paper mill into a paper museum, home of the Paper Industry International Hall of Fame, and mixed retail/office space at a cost of nearly $5 million.\n\n\"Today, the \"Historic Atlas Mill\" houses a mix of office and retail space, including the Atlas Waterfront Cafe, and a museum, the Paper Discovery Center.\""
