        "text": "An effort has been made to represent here the myriad sources of maps in the Library & Archives collections, as well as to present certain series of maps that are particularly useful for genealogical and historical research. As to sources, the Maps at the Tennessee State Library and Archives displays maps that are drawn from manuscript collections, state record groups, the Congressional Serial Set, published volumes in the State Library collections, as well as the physical Map Collection itself. Obviously, with thousands of maps in our holdings, the items presented in this online digital map collection are but the 'tip of the iceberg,' and researchers are strongly encouraged to consult archival staff, the Library & Archives Map Database and individual collection finding aids to find the right map. One of the strengths of our collection --Civil War Maps--is treated separately below.\n\nWe have included a number of significant early maps of the Tennessee country, beginning with colonial-era maps of British possessions that show the Native American towns and villages of the Cherokee, Creek, and Chickasaw nations. Several maps are presented from about the time of statehood--1796--which show Tennessee as it was originally constituted: two non-contiguous areas of settlement consisting of the middle and eastern Tennessee counties, separated by Indian territory. A series of the so-called District Surveyor's maps are here from 1806 onward, showing the division of newly acquired (by treaty) public lands into ranges and sections so that the State of Tennessee could make (sell) land grants. Thereafter, there are state maps from 1818 and the 1820s showing the rapid development of western Tennessee.\n\nAside from the Civil War maps in this collection, there is a sampling of other military maps spanning from the American Revolution to the Plains Indian wars of the 1870s. A very fine Paris-published map from the eighteenth century depicts the land and naval campaign that resulted in the French-American victory over Lord Cornwallis' British army at Yorktown and effectively won America's independence. Another hand-drawn map on linen shows the disposition and movement of US Cavalry and Sioux and Cheyenne warriors at the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn, apparently done by someone who was there or had close knowledge of the battle.\n\nThe bulk of the maps in this presentation are ones of individual Tennessee counties that contain a wealth of detail and are especially useful for genealogical and local historical research. There are three main series of early twentieth century maps represented here: county postal delivery maps, county maps produced by the state Division of Geology, and county soil survey maps. The latter two types are based on US Geological Survey topographical map data and, consequently, are extremely detailed down to the level of individual house structures and name most topographical features (streams, ridges, hollows, etc.) as well as human features such as churches, schools, stores, mills, cemeteries and even very small communities. The postal maps, done presumably for carriers in the early days of Rural Free Delivery (RFD), are similarly very detailed down to the level of individual houses and buildings and provide a great many names of land and homeowners. These county maps, which are done at different times from 1900 to 1940, show many bygone features and are indispensable guides to the rural landscape of Tennessee before modernization changes everything.\n\nOther series of historical maps from the Library & Archives Map Collection, as well as special maps from lesser known manuscript sources in our collections, will be added to this digital collection on a regular basis.\n\nThe Library & Archives holds an extraordinarily rich and diverse collection of original maps created during and about the American Civil War. There are maps of the Virginia campaigns and even the trans-Mississippi territory, but the majority in our collection are of the principal theater of fighting in West Tennessee. Some were drawn by soldiers who were present at a place or engagement and sought to represent it in a map, either at the time or later in a memoir or reminiscence. Others were executed by professional military cartographers (or, as they were often termed, \"topographical engineers\"), who were providing operational maps for use by commanders on both sides.\n\nMilitary maps have always played a crucial role in planning strategy, designing battle plans, and finding the best points for supply routes or even a retreat. This was no more evident than in the Civil War where large armies--particularly Federal ones--traversed a vast Southern landscape unfamiliar to most commanders. Knowing the roads to and from the sites of military engagements, as well as the topography of the locality, was indispensable in conducting war maneuvers. Generals on both sides understood the advantage conveyed by having good, accurate maps of the theater of operations.\n\nToday, Civil War military maps are used by historians and researchers to analyze all kinds of data: troop positions, defensive structures, roads, ferries, encampments, local buildings, and topography. A number of battle maps provide information about a locality that is not otherwise available, such as the configuration of small towns, the location of plantations, and the names of landowners in the area. Those interested in cartography find Civil War maps to be an endless source of fascination as the first truly modern maps of America. Civil War maps offer a unique glimpse of the nation's most portentous conflict.\n\nUnion forces clearly had the advantage when it came to maps, as there were already mapping units in existence. These included the Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers, the Corps of Engineers, the Treasury Department's Coast Survey, and the Navy's Hydrographic Office. Mapping began in earnest when Federal troops occupied key positions. These units provided the necessary equipment and a trained workforce. Army personnel worked in a concerted effort with topographical engineers to update old maps, utilizing the latest printing techniques and using new devices for gathering information, including the establishment of a balloon corps that made sketches and maps from an aerial point of view.\n\nBy comparison, Confederate mapping was woefully inadequate throughout the war. Besides a dearth of trained cartographers, there was a lack of government mapping agencies, inadequate printing facilities, and an almost total absence of surveying and drafting equipment. Survey parties were often sent out into the field where maps were hurriedly drawn in ink on linen to be traced later. Tracing copies took an inordinate amount of time but Confederate cartographers could not afford the expense of producing lithographs. The Confederate Topographical Department, in response to this dilemma, began making photo-reproductions.\n\nSome Union topographical engineers became noted for their superior map making; their work is reflected in several examples on this site. William E. Merrill belonged to the Union Corps of Engineers but, ironically, was not a topographical engineer. He served in the Army of the Potomac, then under General William S. Rosecrans, and, finally, in the Army of the Cumberland led by General George H. Thomas. Merrill and another Union cartographer named Orlando Poe were meticulous in their drafting and supplied the best maps of either army in the Civil War. Nathaniel Michler was a captain of topographical engineers in the Army of the Potomac from 1863-1865. Michler surveyed and mapped numerous operations and fields of battle. Like Merrill, he was a graduate of West Point. Another Federal topographical engineer of note was Lieutenant Harry C. Wharton, who served in the Army of the Cumberland. All produced valuable, detailed wartime maps of Tennessee represented in this collection.\n\nConfederate cartographers represented in this exhibit are Wilbur F. Foster and C. Meister, an apprentice engineer and draftsman in General Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee. A Confederate engineer named Albert Martin produced a beautiful map of the Confederacy's early fortifications on the Mississippi River above Memphis. The featured maps include the pivotal battles at Fort Donelson, Stones River, Franklin, and Nashville. Especially interesting are a number of operational maps of middle Tennessee and north Georgia that belonged to Confederate general and Army of Tennessee corps commander Benjamin F. Cheatham.\n\nAfter the war, commercial mapping enterprises found a lucrative market in a public eager to know where the engagements of the war had been fought. Battlefield maps and panoramic maps were produced for public consumption, with some maps incorporating portraits of military leaders. Often maps printed from woodcuts could be found in newspapers and journals. A number of Civil War battlefield maps in this collection were produced as studies or plans prior to the establishment of national military parks.\n\nIn addition to maps held at the Tennessee State Library and Archives, the digital collection, Looking Back: The Civil War in Tennessee, is the Library & Archive's digital-only collection that includes a number of significant Civil War maps from private owners across the state of Tennessee. Two were drawn by Confederate and Union soldiers who were at Gettysburg and Spring Hill, respectively, and an 1862 map of West Tennessee by a Union cartographer, L. D. Radford.\n\nBosse, David C.
