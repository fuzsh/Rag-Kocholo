        "text": "An important new project has just been completed and 6,696 records added to the Great Database.\n\nThis data covers admissions to Chetham's Hospital 1651 to 1945 but records from 1936 onwards are subject to closure so as to ensure that those included are only opened at least 100 years after their date of birth.\n\nFor those who are unaware of the institution, Chetham's Hospital was not a hospital as we understand it today, but a charitable school for poor children founded according to the will of Humphrey Chetham. The school continued to about 1969 when it became the co-educational school of music which it is today. There are two registers, which overlap 1813-1936. Although the pupils are duplicated, the details associated may differ.\n\nWe acknowledge the support of Chetham's Archivist, Jane Muskett, in bringing this mutually beneficial project to fruition.\n\nAddeded 9,164 index entries to the Great database. These relate to Tillotson's Mercury Newsletter November 1939 – March 1946\n\nTillotson’s (Bolton) Ltd, publishers of the Bolton Evening News and other publications, created the in-house Mercury Newsletter to keep their staff and former colleagues informed about what was happening to\n\neverybody during the Second World War.\n\nAfter the war the seventy five editions were collected and published as a single volume for which members of the Bolton family History Society have now transcribed an index.\n\nThe index links to images of the original issues where you are likely to find more information about the peson named.\n\nThanks to Graham Holt and the Bolton Branch volunteers for this interesting and valuable addition. (image generated by AI 9 Feb 2024, with additions)\n\nAnother two maps have been indexed by Paul Thomas and added to the index:\n\nDukinfield South 1897\n\nStalybridge 1897\n\nThanks again to Paul for these extensions to the indexes for maps covering parts of Tameside.\n\nNEW FEATURE!\n\nThose familiar with the old printed indexes to the Manchester maps will know that these located streets and buildings down to one of the ten sections into which these maps are divided by the way they are folded. The indexes produced subsequently have included these references but up to now it has not been possible to include them in the online index. This is now possible and for this latest couple of maps, these references have been included.\n\nI plan over the coming days to re-visit the earlier index entries (most of them!) and to replace the basic entries which identify only the map with full entries which include the references as above. This will, I hope, make the index a lot more helpful to those who own copies of these useful maps.\n\nIn one of the biggest additions to our public Catholic Records Index, I have just added 243,155 names of those baptised, parents and godparents for baptisms at the following churches:\n\nSt. Alban, Ancoats 1863-1898\n\nSt. Aloysius, Ardwick 1854-1903\n\nSt. Mary, Failsworth 1849-1908\n\nSt. Mary, Mulberry Street 1850-1922\n\nSt. Patrick, Livesey Street 1861-1897\n\nThe index now contains 1,076,294 names.\n\nThe full details of the baptisms as well as images of the registers concerned are available on our latest DVD which is available from the MLFHS online shop\n\nThe DVD also includes images of the baptism registers for St. Casimir, Collyhurst 1904-1931 but no transcript or index owing to difficulties in finding someone who could reliably read the Polish and other eastern European names which appear in the register entries.\n\nThe DVD can be purchased from the Online Shop at https://mlfhs-online-shop.myshopify.com/products/roman-catholic-baptisms-fourth-collection\n\nThanks are due to Madeline Best and her dedicated team of transcribers for this, the fourth DVD of baptism registers, and the one which completes the indexing of baptisms for Catholic churches in Manchester.\n\nSheila Goodyear has indexed the streets appearing on the Alan Godfrey maps below on the same basis as was used to index the Manchester sheets for the Godfrey Map Index in the public area of the web site at https://www.mlfhs.uk/databases/godfrey-map-index\n\nSheila has generously agreed for this index to be added to the Godfrey Map Index so that you can now identify the map or maps on which a particular street appears for streets in Manchester, Salford and now Oldham and its environs. Thanks are due to Sheila for the addition of 3,162 new street names to the index.\n\nCode map MapYear\n\n3427 Ashton & Dukinfield 1907\n\n3952 Ashton-under-lyne 1916\n\n3427 Audenshaw & Droylsden 1916\n\n3129 Chadderton 1907\n\n3120 Denton Town Centre 1918\n\n3122 Denton West 1916\n\n3107 Droylsden 1906\n\n3318 Guide Bridge 1918\n\n3382 Lees 1906\n\n3130 Lydgate 1906\n\n3128 Oldham 1907\n\n3127 Oldham East 1907\n\n3125 Oldham South 1906\n\n3902 Oldham South West 1916\n\nNow all we need is someone with a set of Alan Godfrey maps for Bolton and District to index the streets on each of these.\n\nThanks to Sheila Goodyear for this large collection of references.\n\nSome time ago I posted that I had been adding listings to many of the Great Database datasets so that these can be browsed in addition to searched for specific entries. One of the big omissions at that time was the many burials datasets, all of which required the pdf files to be be alphabetically bookmarked - a daunting and tedious task.\n\nFortunately, Chris Willis stepped in to dramatically reduce the time needed by writing a program which not only automatically inserts A, B, C ... bookmarks at the start of each set of surnames, but also adds individual surname bookmarks every four pages within each set of surnames which start with the same letter - something I would not have even contemplated on some of the larger listings. A big thank you to Chris.\n\nOne of the benefits of this exercise (though I confess I did not see it in this light at the time!) was that it threw up some anomalies in the older datasets such as annotations to surnames e.g. \"SMITH (Rev.)\" and appearances of 'curly' quotes and double quotes. These anomalies could either mean that a surname entry did not appear in search results (searching for \"SMITH\" would not find Rev. SMITH above) and some sorting problems.\n\nThere were also some irregularities in how the names of parents of children had been entered in transcripts \"John & Ann\" and \"John/Ann\" and some entries which had truncated details with the additional text added as a note (I think a hangover from limitations of the National Burial Index data requirements as these datasets were originally created as part of NBI). These have now been reassembled into complete entries. There were also other oddities such as some ages acquiring \".00\" as a result of import from spreadsheets where the age column had not been set to integer format. These mostly produced odd or inconsistent appearance in results so opportunity has been taken to tidy up the presentation.\n\nHaving now sorted out the old data (which approaches half a million burials), I am starting to add the bookmarked listings to the dataset descriptions. It will still take some time to work through the updating of the burial datasets in the Great Database and to add the listings to the descriptions, but this work has now started.\n\nI will post updates from time to time to alert you to progress. The first two to be completed are:\n\nSt Clement, Chorlton-cum-Hardy and St. Lawrence, Denton.\n\nAfter a long time with no additions, I am pleased to report the addition of two new war memorials to our public database:\n\n1109 Oldham, Royton, Wesleyan Methodist Church and Sunday School WW1 Memorial apparently lost. Photograph of memorial only. (180 names)\n\n1110 Atherton, Howe Bridge Mills, WW1 and WW2. Location now a housing estate. Memorial now located on Flapper Fold Lane, Atherton (28 Names)\n\nThanks to Linda Richardson and Terry pots for the photos and to Joan Secker Wlodarczyk for the transcriptions.\n\nThere is still scope to add further memorials to this database, which already covers well over 1,000 memorials and includes over 65,000 names. If you know of a local memorial in Greater Manchester and it is not in our database, we will welcome photographs (overall photo and sufficient detailed photos of panels as to enable transcription of the names). (MEM-51a)\n\nI have added a further 3,989 records to the Great Database. These constitute a reconstruction of the lost portions of the 1851 census for Chorlton-on-Medlock. Please, however, note the following caveat:\n\nSignificant portions of the 1851 census returns were badly water damaged while in storage and in consequence were not microfilmed (or where filmed, were unreadable). Large parts of the damaged returns were transcribed as a project by MLFHS and can be searched and viewed in the 1851 Unfilmed Census database in the member area of this web site.\n\nHowever, this left many households, particularly in Chorlton-on-Medlock, for which the returns were completely unreadable or which had completely disintegrated. The data in this index represents an attempt to reconstruct the missing entries using the Poor rate records for 1851 as a basis. The methodology employed is described in the article which follows below.\n\nIt must be emphasised that the data which appears in this data set represents what MIGHT have appeared in the original returns. Since the Poor rate records name the person who might be expected to have appeared as head of household in the census, these names (which will be listed first in the 'family' listing) may be considered fairly reliable. However, the presence of other family members and their ages are conjectured from data in the previous and subsequent censuses and from other sources. It is, of course, not possible to identify individuals outside the direct family (e.g. in-laws, cousins, visitors, lodgers and boarders) who might have been in the dwelling on census night.\n\nThanks are due to Ray Hulley who compiled this dataset.\n\nThis is an account of Arthur Wood's army service in WW1. The words are taken from Arthur Wood's diary and are supplemented by contemporary images, mainly photographs taken by an Australian unit which worked alongside the British army and which connect directly with Arthur Wood's diary entried.\n\nThis is a unique story, of course, detailing major eents as well as the smaller details of throwing snowballs in the sunshine; it is a story which deserves its place in our archives.\n\nThanks are due to Elaine Greensmith for enabling the society to create this valuable archive which can be read as a PDF in the Documents section or as a webpage HERE\n\nOne of the criticisms of the Memorial Inscription database is that there is no way to browse all of the memorials for a particular cemetery. Thanks to Cheyvonne Bower, this is on the way to being addressed. Cheyvonne is working through the records to produce listings of the memorials which are to be appended to the descriptive documents. A start has been made, but there is still much to be done. I will keep you updated as the work progresses. The first ones completed are:\n\nGraveYardNo Name\n\nM080 Manchester, Gadsby's Chapel, Rochdale Rd (Owen)\n\nM085 Manchester, St. George, Oldham Road\n\nM088 Manchester, New Cross, St Paul\n\nM090 Manchester, Cannon St Chapel\n\nM091 Manchester, Great Bridgewater St. Wesleyan Chapel\n\nM092 Manchester, Upper Brook St. Unitarian Chapel\n\nM095 Manchester, St Michael, Angel St\n\nM099 Manchester, Ancoats, Christ Church, Every Street\n\nM100 Manchester, Ancoats, All Souls\n\nM101 Manchester, Ardwick, St. Thomas\n\nM106 Manchester, Newton Heath, All Saints\n\nM111 Manchester, Failsworth, Dob Lane Unitarian Chapel, Oldham Rd\n\nM150 Trafford Park, St. Cuthbert\n\nM155 Manchester, Moss Side, St. James\n\nM180 Manchester, Cheetham Hill, St. Luke\n\nM279 Manchester, Ardwick, St. Benedicts\n\nM280 Manchester, St. Saviour, Plymouth Grove\n\nM300 Manchester, Rusholme, Platt Unitarian Chapel (1974 Transcript)\n\nM301 Manchester, Rusholme, Platt Unitarian Chapel (2000 Transcript)\n\nM311 Manchester, Rusholme, St James, Birch in Rusholme\n\nM336 Manchester, Chorlton-on-Medlock, St Clements (Owen)\n\nAnother big addition to The Great Database in the member area at mlfhs.uk\n\nThis is the final batch to complete the Manchester Probate Names Index 1812-1837 which now contains 42,788 names extracted from 5,533 wills and administrations proved at the chester Consistory Court where the testator was recorded as living in Manchester or one of the townships.\n\nThe index is invaluable as a means of finding who was connected with the testator, either as executor, witness or beneficiary, so if one of your ancestors appears as a beneficiary, you can locate the will in which they are named and possibly locate more information and open up a new line of research. Mostly probate is indexed by testator only, so if youu have no knowledge of a connection to a testator, this index will bring it to light.\n\nConsiderable thanks are due to Geoff Edge and his team of transcribers for the splendid work they have done to create this index, which helps with that awkward period just before civil registration and the census.\n\nIf you make a breakthrough as a result of using the index, please post it to the forum to help members become more aware of the possibilities it opens up.\n\nAnother substantial and interesting addition to The Great Database.\n\nThis is a transcript of the burial registers for Salford, King Street, Bible Christian Church graveyard 1814-1837.\n\nThere was already a dataset of 10,091 records covering burials 1800-1813, which had been transcribed by Joan Lawler many years ago. This latest addition covers a further 5,682 burials.\n\nKing Street was a very popular burial ground, firstly for followers of this fairly obscure sect, but possibly more so for those who wanted a cheap burial place. Many of those buried at King Street came from Manchester and so if you have been unsuccessful in finding a burial in the parish graveyards it is just possible that their family may have had them buried here.\n\nAll thanks are due to Geoff Edge for undertaking this substantial transcription.\n\nAnother 2,036 records have been added to the Great Database. This is an index to the Grave Book for Little Lever United Reformed Church (URC). Burial register seldom records the grave in which the person is buried. Memorial inscriptions do not necessarily always record all the persons buried (and sometimes memorialise those who were buried elsewhere). The grave book, for those unfamiliar with them, records who is buried in each grave and so provides strong evidence that those in the grave are in some way related (though this is not always the case). They also record 'unusual' burials such as those of stillborn children and of the ashes of those who were cremated, which may not appear either in the register or on the memorial.\n\nThe grave book was 0riginally transcribed by volunteers of our Bolton Branch working under Sylvia Massey. The project also recorded the memorial inscriptions, which are already included in our MI database.\n\nThe original transcript is also available in the Document Collection - Bolton - Death and Burial.\n\nSpecial thanks to Rita Greenwood, for prompting me to add this very interesting index to the Great Database.\n\nPossibly the final addition to the Great Database for 2020.\n\nI have just added a further 5,109 records from the Creed Registers of Bolton Workhouse transcribed by members of our Bolton Branch. These relate to people admitted between 1869 and 1874.\n\nThe admission registers of the workhouse, as is so often the case, have not been preserved. However, the creed books for Bolton have survived and are in Bolton Archives.\n\nCreed registers were kept so that orphaned children could be given appropriate religious instruction and so that, in the event of the inmate's death, they could be buried with the appropriate rites.\n\nThe format of the registers varies over time but they generally record (at least):\n\nThe name of the inmate\n\nDate of admission (or in some cases date entered into register)\n\nPrevious abode\n\nReligious creed\n\nName of informant providing information (usually self or parent)\n\nReason for Discharge (sometimes death)\n\nDate of Discharge or death\n\nWhere a family was admitted as a group, the family entries will usually appear together in the register.\n\nThis makes them an excellent substitute for the lost admission registers.\n\nThe transcription project aims to transcribe the registers 1869-1918. Twelve of the twenty-one registers have been completed creating 34,649 records covering 1869-1882, 1892-5 and 1902-1907.\n\nMany people, however, will appear more than once since they might be admitted and discharged several times as their fortunes waxed and waned.\n\nJust because the web site has moved to a new platform it doesn't mean that the databases don't continue to expand. Here are the latest additions:\n\nScutari Hospital Deaths\n\nAnthony Steven has made a flying start on compiling a list of those soldiers (and the odd civilian) who died in the Scutari Hospital (think of Florence Nightingale) during the Crimean War 1854-56. His initial batch relates to 1,541 deaths 1854-5 and he is continuing to work on the balance. These are taken from reports published in a variety of newspapers. While these are not (by far) all going to be men from the Manchester area, there will undoubtedly be local men in some of the regiments. Details given include (mostly) rank, regiment, date of death and cause of death."
