        "text": "Not easy, either, is his entire life right now, he admits to himself. The last few months have sped by—he’s accepted too many carpentry jobs for neighbors. Carving the Thuya Garden gate panels has brought him joy, but the detailed work is time-consuming and tiring. Keeping on top of the steady stream of map and postcard orders flowing in by phone and mail consumes his evening hours. Escaping when he can to shoot for new postcards provides a respite, albeit a working one, as do delivery trips like the one he’s making today. He worries about the price of gas—it’s up to 31 cents a gallon.^1\n\nHis feet are on the ground—and in the air—and perhaps it’s in the air where he feels most free. Lately he's been hiring bush pilots so he can snap aerial views. Usually he goes up for just twenty or thirty minutes at a time, but sometimes for an hour when he can afford it. Thinking of Ray Porter, over in Shin Pond, makes him smile. Maybe he can fit in a flight and visit with Ray sometime soon, after he completes his Greenville stops.^2\n\nFinally, almost to town and eager to visit with his customers and stretch his legs, Gus crests Indian Hill. Here he focuses only on the view, as the panorama of town, lake, islands, and hills unfolds before him. He never tires of this moment, this opening up. He pulls off the road to take a few photos—and a few deep breaths.\n\nHis thoughts turn to his older brother Luther, gone for two years now, but with him here in spirit. The view from Indian Hill reveals a vast territory they’d explored together for years. Inheriting his brother’s State O’ Maine Postcards and The Phillips Maps of Maine businesses has been both a gift and a burden. To keep his brother's trades viable, Gus has been updating Luther’s maps while also creating his own. With advances in printing and other technologies, he’s adapting to keep their work relevant and saleable. So far it’s working.\n\nGus sells a lot of maps and postcards to Greenville businesses these days; the town is a hub of activity, a jumping-off point for sports and tourists alike who come to explore the forest and waters of Maine’s North Woods. Gus thinks perhaps some visitors are familiar with the area’s recent past, but how many realize that the Wabanaki people’s history in the area goes back, not just hundreds, but thousands of years?\n\nGus has told his grandchildren stories of Henry David Thoreau and his explorations of the area with Penobscot guides. Two of Throeau’s three journeys in the Maine woods included Greenville. On Thoreau’s 1853 trip to Chesuncook, Chief Joseph Attean guided him. Four years later, Thoreau explored the headwaters of the Allagash and the East Branch of the Penobscot with Joe Polis showing him the way. Both men taught Thoreau the tangibles of woods and water travel and the intangible, ancient connections between these places and those who have been their stewards for centuries. This area speaks volumes to those who want to hear it—and preserve it.\n\nLooking over Moosehead, Gus remembers past trips in the spring when he and Luther marveled at the steamers towing huge rafts or “booms” of logs across the lake. Each boom might hold as much as 4000 cords of wood and cover between 20-30 acres.^4 The log drives, which floated the logs to downriver milltowns, began at Moosehead’s East Outlet, which is where the Kennebec River begins. Once on the river, those logs were “driven” by log drivers who worked to keep the logs moving and off the shore, preventing dangerous log jams.\n\nGus decides to begin today’s deliveries at Wilsons on Moosehead Lake, a sporting camp situated at the mouth of the East Outlet. Gus revels in the camp’s history. A teller of tales himself, he especially likes the story of Henry Wilson, the first operator of the dam at the East Outlet. Wilson floated his house down Moosehead to this spot in 1865 and began welcoming sports to stay there. One of the camp’s more famous guests was Ulysses S. Grant. Wilsons is one of many Maine sporting camps which carries Phillips maps and postcards.^5\n\nThe Rambler descends the last half mile into Greenville. As Gus turns left on Pritham Avenue, he waves to Albert Faye, proprietor of The Indian Store and one of his best customers. Later Albert and his wife Ida will catch Gus up on the latest happenings in town. Turning the corner by Bretton’s Store in Greenville Junction, Gus heads north on the Rockwood Road for the scenic drive up the west side of Moosehead Lake.\n\nL to R: Map1. Luther’s and Gus’s pictorial map. Map 2. Gus’s recreational map.\n\nMap 3. Gus’s painted map. Map 4. Luther’s and Gus’s postcard map.\n\nPerhaps this is why the Phillips brothers created four distinctly different maps of Moosehead Lake. Luther published his pictorial map in 1953. Gus updated and republished it again after Luther’s death. As he adapted to advances in printing and the needs of residents and visitors to the North Woods, Gus created two more Moosehead maps of his own. He first published his recreational map in 1963. His 1971 Moosehead map demonstrates Gus’s final map style, which combines his talents for both painting and cartography. Several versions of a separate postcard map of Moosehead also exist; Luther created the card in black and white, and Gus updated and colored it in future editions.\n\nSixty years after Gus took his trip to Greenville in the Rambler, Cathy and John made the same journey. On an evening in June they visited Tom Watt, a young man who is a seventh-generation Greenville resident, a senior at University of Southern Maine, and during the summer of 2022 he was busy working two summer jobs. Tom described himself as “into outdoorsmanship and local history, especially the preservation of it.” Although Gus and Tom are a couple of generations apart, they are kindred spirits. One can easily imagine the two of them swapping stories around a campfire, both happy and at home in Maine’s North Woods.\n\nTom shared stories and his knowledge of local history with us. He spoke about the woods: “In the Lumberman’s Museum, there’s a lumberman's exhibit, and a lot of those chainsaws belonged to my great-grandfather Johnny.” He talked about steamboats, kick-sleds, diaries, and an early floor-model crank record player. The area’s past came alive for us, populated by Tom’s ancestors.\n\n“My grandmother’s grandfather was a steamboat builder and captain. If you’ve ever heard of the Twilight, it was the sister ship of the Katahdin, that was Stillman Sawyer’s boat, my great-great grandfather. It sank just under the water off Kelly’s Landing. You can snorkel right up to it. It’s mostly intact . . . . Most of them [the steamboats], I think, all except the Twilight, were burned—that was when you were done with them, you just set them on fire, and that one [Twilight] got sold.\n\nThe steamboat company went out of business in 1940 and the ice poked a hole in it [Twilight], and so when they built the last set of dams it got washed out and covered with water, so it’s mostly intact and then of course the Katahdin is the remaining one, the Twilight and the Katahdin were sister ships, very similar in size and layout.\n\nStillman’s father, my great-great-great grandfather, built and captained steamboats. His wife was a lady named Lousia Sawyer. She was born in Stillwater in 1855 or 1856, and she died here in Greenville at the age of 101, and she worked until she was 100. She was physically and mentally competent her entire life. When my grandmother was growing up, they called her Nana Upstairs.”\n\nGlancing up, Tom calls our attention to a chair on skis that’s suspended above us:\n\n“That kick-sled that’s up on the ceiling there—so, I don’t know if you’re familiar with kicksleds at all . . . .It’s a Finnish thing. They use them on the ice, and so they’re all over the place here and Monson and Greenville because of the big Finn population in Monson . . . .That one belonged to my Finnish great-great grandparents and . . .it is my mother’s. We had it and I restored it . . . .It didn’t look that nice a few years ago . . . .I restored it.\n\nI don’t know if you’re familiar at all with a guy named Louis Oakes . . . .You might have heard of his brother Harry Oakes who was a prospector in Canada and became fabulously rich . . . . and Louis paid for the building of Greenville High School and Foxcroft Academy . . . . He used to own a camp in Kokadjo, that my great grandparents bought, and he had abandoned it, like he left all the furniture in it . . . .I have Louis Oakes’s crank record player, a big floor model.\n\nOne of the really valuable sources that I have is, my great-great grandmother Bertha Watt, kept diaries from 1940 to 1972, and I have them. They're five-year diaries, and I’ve read 1940 to 45. It’s very interesting to read about what her daily life was like and especially 1940 to 45 world events that were going on, and some things, like I as soon as I got my hands on them I went through and I looked up different important dates in history. And there were some things that were noticeably missing from—like she didn’t make any comment on—like an assassination or something like that that she didn’t mention. In the back of the book she writes how much they paid in taxes each year. I think one year it was fifteen dollars altogether, selling horses, and that kind of thing. She lived in Blanchard most of her life, and you know it’s a big deal to go to Greenville.”\n\nAs Tom shared stories of Greenville’s past and his knowledge of Maine’s North Woods, we contributed some memories of our own. Chatting about experiencing a truly dark, star-filled sky and deep-woods silence filled all three of us with gratitude.^8\n\nEarlier that day we also visited Wilsons on Moosehead Lake sporting camps, where Gus had visited Don Wilson in 1962. On a previous trip to Wilsons in late March, we had experienced the “mud-luscious and puddle-wonderful” ground under a “blue true dream of sky.”^9 We chatted with Scott Snell, who with his wife Allison, runs Wilsons today. Scott was working on spring projects before they welcomed their guests—many of whom have vacationed there for decades—for the summer season. Here at Wilsons on Moosehead Lake the view across the frozen lake to Katahdin was stunning.\n\nTomhegan Wilderness Camps 2022. Photos by John Meader.\n\nSporting camps have a long history in the Greenville area. In 1904 there were at least 300 sporting camps in operation in Maine, but by 1997, there were fewer than 78. Today the number of sporting camps is even lower.^13 Gus saw the beauty of these rustic camps and the Moosehead area landscape upon which they existed. He loved the tales the owners shared about their lives in the region. And he also saw the prospect that sports might like to take a memory or two home with them, perhaps in the form of a few postcards or a map. Those sporting camps that are still thriving today, and many others which are no longer in existence, are an integral part of both Gus's story and North Woods history. As we further explore this area of Maine, we believe that one day we'll discover an old Phillips map tacked onto a rustic cabin wall.\n\nPhotographer’s Notes—John T. Meader\n\nI’ve been visiting the Moosehead region since I was a young boy traveling to the big lake on annual fishing trips with my father and two grandfathers soon after the ice went out. I remember cold days on the lake trolling for togue, sipping my root beer, listening to my grandfathers exchanging stories, and waiting for the big one to bite.\n\nWhen I was a dad with young children, we again explored the Moosehead area, but in the warmth of summer and from the seat of a canoe. Camping along the shore, hiking Mount Kineo, and swimming in Moosehead’s cool waters, my family returned to the region for many north woods adventures.\n\nAs a photographer, Moosehead has always drawn me—the vast vistas of the lake, the surrounding mountains, including the distant summit of Katahdin more than 40 miles away, and the impressive cliffs of Kineo which plunge into Moosehead’s deepest hole, more than 240 feet deep. Following in Gus’s footsteps, I feel his presence—a connection on many levels: as an artist, a photographer, an explorer, and a lover of the State of Maine. The vistas over Moosehead’s expansive waters have always been a microcosm of the overall beauty of the inland regions of Maine. This lake is surrounded by mountains, deep forests, running rivers, whitewater, and history. Native peoples have lived here for millennia. When I explore the area I often think about their past presence on these shores, from the flint of Kineo, to the birchbark canoes that once plied the lakes and rivers, to the villages and camps they had throughout the region. Here there is much to learn, much to see, and much to appreciate. It’s a haven for a photographer and artist. When I walk in Gus’s footsteps, I, like him, am walking in the footsteps of a history that goes back thousands of years.\n\nEndnotes and works consulted:\n\n1.
