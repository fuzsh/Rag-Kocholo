        "text": "I picked up a nice little Atlas a while back and I'm in the process of cleaning it up and I wanted to take the collet holder out of the spindle and it wont come out. It looks like someone machined it down for the mill and there is no threads or draw bolt holding it in. I notice the arbor has a MT and 3/8'' threaded hole for a draw bolt. and would hope this holder has a MT too I didnt want to pound too hard with a bar through the spindle until I asked the question.\n\nIf I need to lay the BH to it I will but I dont want to mess up my basement pet before I get to play with it.\n\nAlso: the arbor has two slots ahead of the MT and I've seen that used on larger mills to drive the arbor.. should this mill have drive dogs to mesh into the slots ? Thanks for any help with this! Randy Hart Ohio\n\nHello, Randy. There's an Atlas Shaper and Milling Machine users group over on Yahoo! - lots of data, drawings, and other information on the MF mill to be found there. I suggest you join up.\n\nMill spindle is 1\"x10 thread, Morse Taper 2. Most tooling for MT-2 is tapped 3/8\"x16 for the drawbar. There are two round notches in genuine Atlas milling arbors - and these mate with pins that protrude from a thread-on spindle drive adaptor to keep the arbor from slipping in the taper when driving a milling cutter. The Yahoo! site will have more information.\n\nThese are nice little mills for a number of smaller jobs. While I've got bigger machines, I've kept the MFC because it suits my needs for some smaller and lighter work.\n\nWhat did you get for tooling with the mill?\n\n-Carl\n\nCarl:\n\nIs that group you refer to on Yahoo accessed by typing in \"Atlas Shaper and Milling Machine Users Group\" (?) or how do you find them. Figured I'd ask here before trying to look for the wrong thing.\n\nI picked up a little benchtop shaper a couple years ago that looks like new, and while I know the basics of it, I'm more of a Mill, Drill, Lathe, Grinder, Gear Hob, Spline Roll, Broach, machinist with no practical experience on a shaper.\n\nPassed up on a shaper 25 years ago that I'd been kicking myself ever since for not buying, so when I found this one at a local auction I bit the bullit and bought it just to have it. Right now it's just setting in the garage waiting for something to use it for... I got the owners manual & parts book with it, but there's only 'so much' information in those.\n\nHello Carl, Well the 7/8\" arbor and the collet holder and a cheap china vice, a number of carbide endmills and HS endmills.\n\nI have it running now and it all works good.. the power feed runs as it should and all the gears look great. I am missing the arbor drive adapter but I should have it made this week sometime. It is missing the lower belt guard in the back but I should be ok as long as I don't try to hugg it while it's running.\n\nI have a 6\" Atlas lathe in the basement shop and a 7\" South Bend shaper to wrestle down there soon. This little mill is what I have been wanting for a long time and I finally found one priced in my range on Craigs\n\nIn the past I have built steam engines and worked on my York gas engine model with larger machines I have from when I was in the business.. But those are not located at my house and so I wanted a tinker space in the basement.\n\nI want to finish the York so I can buy another casting kit.\n\nAttachments\n\natlas1.jpg\n\natlas2.jpg\n\natlas3.jpg\n\natlas4.jpg\n\nThanks....\n\nMy thanks button is gone again (thanking too many people I guess).\n\nI figured a mill would hog off material faster than the shaper, but the shaper can do internal splines and keyways, and do inside angles smaller than 90 degrees rather than buying or regrinding mill cutters for shallow angles, but so far I haven't had a need to use it yet. Not currently working on any projects, just couldn't pass up another one, cause they don't show up that often.\n\nEngines in the background aren't mine, Though I wouldn't mind having a couple of them. These pics are from when I had it in a friends garage before hauling it home. Bought it in the winter time and his garage was closer and easier access at the time.\n\nAttachments\n\nshaper 1.jpg\n\nshaper 2.jpg\n\nHello again, folks.\n\nYou can find the Atlas group here; http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/Atlasshaperandmillingmachineusersgroup/\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I'm one of the moderators for that group. You do need to enter a one-line description of why you want to join the group - so just mention you've got an Atlas mill or shaper and you'd like to join, and one of the moderators will OK you right away. Unfortunately, we have to make people jump through hoops like that to avoid spamming problems. We look forward to your joining the group, and hopefully finding all sorts of interesting information in the files and photographs sections - not to mention support in the messages, too.\n\nNice looking Atlas MFC. I picked mine up several years ago, and it was missing a number of parts, or had parts adapted that were not correct for the machine. Over the years I've managed to find just about everything I need to do a decent cleaning, painting, and returning to original configuration. I hesitate to say restoration, because I'm not certain how far I'll take the work at this point. There's a normal wear spot in roughly the center of the X-axis dovetail for table travel that I might try to scrape into better shape, but probably won't go too much farther in terms of trying to improve basic machine performance.\n\nThe little shaper shown in the photographs is an AAMCO - on the original cabinet, too. I've got the same shaper here - and an Atlas 7B shaper as well. I really enjoy having shapers around - there's just something pleasant about working with them. They are versatile - but not necessarily fast at removing metal (when talking about home machines, that is - the big ones can remove metal at an amazing rate, throwing blue chips of steel across the room that sound like a quarter when it hits the floor - but I digress). It's been said that 'you can make anything on a shaper - except money', and that's why they have fallen from favor in commercial shop, yet find a perfect place in the home or model engineer's shop. They are a wonderful tool to have in the small shop.\n\n-Carl\n\nActually the one on the factory cabinet has Delta and Rockwell tags on it.\n\nThe cabinet has a tag on it from the Freeport Journal Standard Press Room. Don't know if they used it (very little) for machine repairs, or if they used it on a regular basis scraping down print blocks back in the day. It appears to be in pretty good shape either way.\n\nI bought it at a moving and storage unit auction.\n\nI like the fact that the cabinet has wheels on one end and the drop down handle on the other. The owners manual says it's so you can take the shaper to the repair site instead of lugging all the parts to the maintenace room, or words to that effect. Haven't looked at it for a few months.\n\nI do need to get on that website though and see what I can learn. Hopefully they let Delta owners on the Atlas site. I'm too old and lame to be 'jumping through hoops' anymore.\n\nAttachments\n\nshaper tags.jpg\n\nshaper Journal Standard tag.jpg\n\nThat's a fairly late machine to be carrying the Delta / Rockwell name, OTTO; looks like it's quite nice. I don't recall when they changed over. Do you have the clapper and clapper box for it? Looks like it was removed in the photos. If you need any measurements on parts you're missing, let me know - my machine is fairly complete with most original parts (save for a handle or two that are replacements).\n\nOne of the cabinet claims was that you could roll it to work, or roll it up next to another machine and have one machinist tend to the shaper and the other machine at the same time when the work permitted. It is handy - as I have mine out of the way in a corner of the shop by the door, but tend to move it into a better working area when I use it.\n\nI've got another Rockwell tool in the basement - the small vertical milling machine. Roughly a 1960's American made version of the modern 6x26\" mills, with an R8 spindle. If people have a limited space for a shop, one of these 750 pound machines can fill the bill nicely - provided the nature of the work fits the envelope. These can also be broken down so the largest piece (column) can come down the basement stairs on a two-wheeler - perfect for those applications where a Bridgeport wouldn't be practical.\n\nNo issues joining the Atlas group if you don't have an Atlas machine. While the group's founder would like to keep the message postings Atlas related and not talk a lot about other makes of machines, the general shaper information in the groups messages and especially the files section will have useful stuff that applies to many shapers. There are other groups out there as well with good shaper information - I'm a member of NEMES (New England Model Engineering Society), and Kay Fisher wrote a number of shaper related columns for the group. Here's a place to have a look - http://www.neme-s.org/shapers/shaper_columns.html\n\nNo shop that has the room should be without a shaper. They are just too useful - once you start making various tooling and work holding items. That's the fun part of machining for me - making various tools and work holding items (and fixing cast aside machines with broken irreplaceable parts that can be recreated with a little time and ingenuity).\n\n-Carl\n\nThanks for the info.\n\nYes I do have the clapper box, a swivel vise (I think maybe 4 inch wide without looking at it again), lathe style tool post and a couple tool holders including (I think without looking again) the boring bar tool holder.\n\nI think there were a few other misc. pieces in one of the drawers of the cabinet, but don't remember what else off the top of my head.\n\nAnd of course I already had/have V-blocks, angle plates, etc. that should fit it OK.\n\nAlways thought it would be fun to play around with cutting gear blanks and keyways, and being the smaller model it's 110V single phase so I can run it. I assume that quite a bit of standard lathe tooling will work OK on these.\n\nBeginning to feel guilty for highjacking Randy's thread here especially since I haven't congratulated him yet on that little milling machine... That's something else I've been looking to get, and from the pictures, he got himself a beauty. I've knocked out several million half moon keys and a few hundred thousand long keyways on the bigger versions of those, and always wanted a small one for at home, but haven't gotten it yet. Used to knock out 427 shafts an hour milling a .643 dia. by .187 wide half moon key when I had good cutters to work with, but then the company started buying from a different vendor and I had to cut the feedrates in half to keep from breaking them. I do have a smaller mill than the one Randy got with handwheel operated downfeed and centerline or front to back, but it only has a lever action crossfeed on the table so it would have to take pretty light cuts.\n\nLOL, no problem at all A good chat about cool little machines is better than a short lived thread anyday.\n\nI didn't manage to make the arbor adapter this week\n\nWork was, well... work and the cold had us running to keep things going and from freezing up.. if I do get a chance it will be in the big shop after a long heat soak with the used oil burner running full tilt for at least a day.. Too much iron in there to get it warm for a quick job.\n\nPerhaps I'll get up early after it running all night and go in there for the day\n\nHappy New Year, It's going to be a good one ! I just have that feeling!!"
