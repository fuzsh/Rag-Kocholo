That is, all people other than non-Hispanic white-alone individuals. The word \"alone\" in this case indicates that the person is of a single race, not multiracial.\n\nPercent low-income.\n\nPercent of individuals whose ratio of household income to poverty level in the past 12 months was less than 2 (as a fraction of individuals for whom ratio was determined).\n\nUnemployment.\n\nAll those who did not have a job at all during the reporting period, made at least one specific active effort to find a job during the prior 4 weeks, and were available for work (unless temporarily ill).\n\nPercent in limited English speaking.\n\nPercent of households in which no one age 14 and over speaks English \"very well\" or speaks English only (as a fraction of households).\n\nPercent less than high school education.\n\nPercent of individuals age 25 and over with less than high school degree.\n\nPercent under age 5.\n\nPercent of individuals under age 5 as a fraction of population.\n\nPercent over age 64.\n\nPercent of individuals over age 64 as a fraction of the population.\n\nDemographic Index.\n\nThe demographic index in EJScreen is a combination of percent low-income and percent minority, the two socioeconomic factors that were explicitly named in Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice. For each Census block group, these two numbers are simply averaged together. The formula is as follows: demographic index = (% people of color + % low-income) / 2.\n\nSupplemental Demographic Index.\n\nThe supplemental demographic index in EJScreen is a combination of five socioeconomic factors averaged together for each Census block group. The supplemental demographic index can provide an additional perspective on potential community vulnerability and may be more relevant for use in certain situations. The formula is as follows: supplemental demographic index = (% low-income + % persons with disabilities + % less than high school education + % limited English speaking + low life expectancy) / 5. For block groups where low life expectancy data is missing, the formula will average the other four factors.\n\nEJ Indexes\n\nEJ Index\n\nThere are thirteen EJ indexes in EJScreen reflecting the 13 environmental indicators, combined with socioeconomic information. The EJ index highlights block groups with the highest intersection of low-income populations, people of color, and a given environmental indicator. To calculate a single EJ index for one block group, EJScreen multiplies the environmental indicator by socioeconomic information. This socioeconomic information includes percent low-income and percent people of color (as the demographic index). This is the formula for the index:\n\nEJ Index = (Environmental Indicator Percentile for Block Group) X (Demographic Index for Block Group)\n\nView descriptions of the 13 EJ Indexes here.\n\nSupplemental Indexes\n\nSupplemental Index\n\nThere are thirteen supplemental indexes in EJScreen reflecting the 13 environmental indicators, combined with socioeconomic information. The supplemental index highlights block groups with the highest intersection of five socioeconomic factors and a given environmental indicator. To calculate a single supplemental index for one block group, EJScreen multiplies the environmental indicator by socioeconomic information. This socioeconomic information includes percent low-income, percent linguistically isolated, percent less than high school education, percent persons with disabilities, and low life expectancy (as the supplemental demographic index). This is the formula for the index:\n\nSupplemental Index = (Environmental Indicator Percentile for Block Group) X (Supplemental Demographic Index for Block Group)\n\nView descriptions of the 13 Supplemental Indexes here.\n\nClimate Change\n\nEnviroatlas\n\nSpatial Metadata: Enviroatlas.\n\nSea Level Rise (NOAA)\n\nThis dataset depicts land at risk of permanent flooding when sea level rises. There are six map layers showing the area inundated at one, two, three, four, five and six feet of sea level rise. Over the next 30 years, scientists estimate a one to three-foot rise along most of the U.S. coastline. These data can be used to look for areas of potential permanent inundation based on chosen sea level rise estimates (i.e., 1 to 6 feet) in relation to locations of social and economic vulnerability.\n\nSource: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\nSpatial Metadata: NOAA Office for Coastal Management.\n\nWildfire Risk\n\nThe First Street Foundation-Wildfire Model (FSF-WFM) is a 30 meter resolution model representing the wildfire exposure for any specific location in the contiguous US, today and with the future climate change. The risk of wildfire is derived from a series of inputs associated with fire fuels, weather, human influence, and fire movement. Bringing all of these inputs together, at a national scale, in a high-resolution, climate-adjusted model represents a first-of-its-kind property-level wildfire risk model. In the development of the model, U.S. Federal Government open data are used for the foundational topography, fuels, weather, climate, and historical disturbances information, and additional data were added from a variety of state and local wildfire and land management sources to facilitate a both high resolution and future-facing (estimates both for today and for 30 years ahead) product.\n\nSource: First Street Foundation.\n\nFlood Risk\n\nThe First Street Foundation Flood Model is a nationwide probabilistic flood model that shows the risk of flooding at any location in all 50 states and Puerto Rico due to rainfall (pluvial), riverine flooding (fluvial), and coastal surge flooding. While other hydraulic and hydrologic models show refined risks of flooding in certain areas, this model provides complete coverage across the United States at 3-meter resolution. The First Street Foundation Flood Model provides a consistent and unified methodology across the entire country with continuous outputs. This extends into areas that have no previous flood modeling and even areas that do not have recorded hydrologic data. As a result, there is increased visibility into new regions of the entire country.\n\nSource: First Street Foundation.\n\nExtreme Heat\n\nThis dataset provides a screening level assessment of extreme heat potential by census block group. This dataset describes the average number of days over 90º F (from 2019-2023) per block group. This is calculated from PRISM Climate Group’s gridded daily Tmax estimates. Note this is dry-bulb temperature, and does not factor in humidity.\n\nSource data: PRISM Climate Group\n\nSource: US EPA.\n\nHealth Disparities\n\nLow Life Expectancy\n\nAverage life expectancy data developed as a collaboration between NCHS, the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

This data is available at the tract level; the same tract value is then assigned to all sub block groups.\n\nSource: CDC Places Data.\n\nCancer\n\nCancer (excluding skin cancer) prevalence among adults aged 18 or older. This data is available at the Census tract level; the same tract value is then assigned to all sub block groups.\n\nSource: CDC Places Data.\n\nPersons with Disabilities\n\nPercent of all persons with disabilities. Considers six disability types: hearing difficulty, vision difficulty, cognitive difficulty, ambulatory difficulty, self-care difficulty, and independent living difficulty. Respondents who report any one of the six disability types are considered to have a disability. For more information on each disability type visit: Census.gov: How Disability Data are Collected from The American Community Survey.\n\nThis data is derived from Census ACS data at the tract level. Block group values are calculated by multiplying the tract value by the block population weight. The weights are derived from the same Census source used by the EJScreen buffer reports and analysis.\n\nSource: Download ACS Data.\n\nCritical Service Gaps\n\nBroadband Gaps\n\nAreas with the lowest rate of households with a broadband internet subscription.\n\nSource: The Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year summary estimates.\n\nLack of Health Insurance\n\nPercent of all persons without Health Insurance Coverage.\n\nSource: Download ACS Data.\n\nHousing Burden\n\nThis dataset contains census tract level percentiles for housing cost, which is the share of households that are both earning less than 80% of Housing and Urban Development’s Area Median Family Income and are spending more than 30% of their income on housing costs. The housing cost percentiles were adopted as Housing Burden for EJScreen.\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nTransportation Access\n\nThe Average of Transportation Indicator uses an average of four transportation-related indicator percentiles, including Transportation Cost Burden, National Walkability Index, Percentage of Households with No Vehicle Available, and Mean Commute Time to Work. It was renamed to Transportation Access for EJScreen.\n\nSource: The Department of Transportation's Transportation Disadvantaged Census Tracts.\n\nFood Desert\n\nLow income and low access tract measured at 1 mile for urban areas and 10 miles for rural areas.

CERCLA provides a Federal \"Superfund\" to locate, investigate, and clean up uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous-waste sites as well as accidents, spills, and other emergency releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment. The National Priorities List (NPL) is the list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States and its territories.\n\nSource: EPA's Envirofacts.\n\nHazardous Waste (TSDF and LQGs)\n\nHazardous waste information contained in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information (RCRAInfo) includes an inventory on all generators, transporters, treaters, storers, and disposers of hazardous waste that are required to provide information about their activities.\n\nSource: EPA's Envirofacts.\n\nWater Dischargers (NPDES)\n\nAs authorized by the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program controls water pollution by regulating sources, such as municipal and industrial wastewater treatment facilities, that discharge pollutants into waters of the United States. EPA tracks water discharge permits through the Permit Compliance System (PCS) and Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) databases, which includes information on when a permit was issued and when it expires, how much the company is permitted to discharge, and the actual monitoring data showing what the company has discharged.\n\nSource: EPA's Envirofacts.\n\nAir Pollution (ICIS-AIR)\n\nThe air pollution data (ICIS-AIR) contains compliance and permit data for stationary sources of air pollution (such as electric power plants, steel mills, factories, and universities) regulated by EPA, state and local air pollution agencies. The information in ICIS-AIR is used by the states to prepare State Implementation Plans (SIPs) and to track the compliance status of point sources with various regulatory programs under Clean Air Act.\n\nSource: EPA's Envirofacts.\n\nBrownfields (ACRES)\n\nThe Assessment, Cleanup and Redevelopment Exchange System (ACRES) captures grantee reported data on environmental activities and accomplishments (assessment, cleanup and redevelopment), funding, job training, and details on cooperative partners and leveraging efforts for the Brownfields Program. The information in ACRES is provided at the property and grant level.\n\nSource: EPA's Envirofacts.\n\nToxics Release Inventory\n\nAs authorized under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA), the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) tracks the management of certain toxic chemicals that may pose a threat to human health and the environment. U.S. facilities in different industry sectors must report annually how much of each chemical is released to the environment and/or managed through recycling, energy recovery and treatment.\n\nThe map shows point locations for facilities that submitted TRI reports to EPA during the most recent reporting year. Points are relatively sized based on total quantities reported as released.\n\nSource: EPA's Envirofacts and Facility Registry Service (FRS)\n\nSpatial metadata: TRI.\n\nChemical Data Reporting (TSCA)\n\nThe Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) grants EPA broad authority to issue regulations designed to gather health/safety and exposure information on, require testing of, and control exposure to chemical substances and mixtures. Under Section 8(a) of TSCA, the Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) rule requires manufacturers (including importers) to report information every four years on the production and use of chemicals in commerce. This map shows point locations for sites that submitted CDR reports to EPA during the most recent reporting cycle (2020).\n\nSource: Access CDR\n\nSpatial Metadata: CDR.\n\nOther Environmental Data\n\nFacilities Compliance Status\n\nThe map layer uses the Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) standard facility symbology to illustrate the programs each facility is regulated under, whether they are in noncompliance, and how long it has been since the last inspection. Users can choose to view all facilities or tailor the view to facilities regulated under the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, or Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Source: This includes data about EPA-regulated facilities from the All Media Programs facility search and the ECHO Exporter.\n\nAir Toxics\n\nAir Toxics Cancer Risk\n\nThe air toxics cancer risk data is the estimated lifetime inhalation cancer risk from the analyzed carcinogens in ambient outdoor air, as provided by EPA’s AirToxScreen. The value of the indicator is persons per million over a 70-year lifetime. The data is reported at the Census block level.\n\nSource: EPA’s Air Toxics Screening Assessment.\n\nNonattainment Areas\n\nIf the air quality in a geographic area meets or is cleaner than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), it is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the national standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, EPA is not able to determine an area's status after evaluating the available information and those areas are designated \"unclassifiable.\" These are areas that do not meet (or that contributes to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard for a NAAQS.\n\nPM10 (1987 standard)\n\nDescription: PM10 (1987 standard)\n\nSource and Spatial Metadata: PM10 (1987 standard)\n\nPM2.5 Annual (2012 standard)\n\nDescription: PM2.5 Annual (2012 standard)\n\nSource and Spatial Metadata: PM2.5 Annual (2012 standard)\n\nPM2.5 Annual (1997 standard)\n\nDescription: PM2.5 Annual (1997 standard)\n\nSource and Spatial Metadata: PM2.5 Annual (1997 standard)\n\nPM2.5 24hr (2006 standard)\n\nDescription: PM2.5 24hr (2006 standard)\n\nSource and Spatial Metadata: PM2.5 24hr (2006 standard)\n\nSO2 1-hr (2010 standard)\n\nDescription: SO2 1-hr (2010 standard)\n\nSource and Spatial Metadata: SO2 1-hr (2010 standard)\n\nLead (2008 standard)\n\nDescription: Lead (2008 standard)\n\nSource and Spatial Metadata: Lead (2008 standard)\n\nOzone 8-hr (2008 standard)\n\nDescription: Ozone 8-hr (2008 standard)\n\nSource and Spatial Metadata: Ozone 8-hr (2008 standard)\n\nOzone 8-hr (1997 standard)\n\nDescription: Ozone 8-hr (1997 standard)\n\nSource and Spatial Metadata: Ozone 8-hr (1997 standard).\n\nRSEI Score\n\nA RSEI Score is a unitless value that accounts for the size of the chemical release, the fate and transport of the chemical through the environment, the size and location of the exposed population, and the chemical's toxicity. A RSEI Score is calculated as toxicity weight multiplied by the exposed population multiplied by the estimated dose. RSEI Scores are only meaningful in comparison to other RSEI Scores.\n\nSource: EPA's RSEI\n\nWater Features\n\nImpaired Water Points\n\nThe Impaired Water Points layer includes points that are too polluted or otherwise degraded to meet the water quality standards set by states, territories, or authorized tribes.

The threshold map widget allows EJScreen users to look across all twelve indexes at once, providing a cumulative outlook on vulnerable populations facing higher pollution burdens. Users select a percentile range, for example the 80th to 100th percentile, and the tool then maps places where one or more of the indexes is within that range. The tool also allows users to select the number of indexes within the user-defined range or to select specific indicators of interest. Threshold maps are available for both the EJ indexes and the new supplemental indexes and are available for comparison at the national and state level."
