        "text": "A former mill along the Spokane River reimaged as a mixed-use community\n\nThe Atlas Mill Development is public-private partnership in concert with Ignite CdA for the redevelopment of the former Atlas Mill into a vibrant mixed-use development. Located along the Spokane River and minutes from the heart of Lake Coeur d’Alene, the Atlas Mill development brings together the best-in-class design that seamlessly knits itself into the natural landscape. The minimalist design is accented by heavily landscaped public spaces that blend the waterfront with the built environment.\n\nWith a mix of amenities including a hybrid outdoor activities lounge featuring co-working space, coffee bar, ski/bike tuning, and available stand-up paddle boards, residents are encouraged to take advantage of all the area has to offer. From interconnected pathways leading to downtown Coeur d’Alene and the lake for which it was named, newly developed waterfront parks, and the rising hills and mountains that surround the area, the project embraces the lifestyle that has come to define northern Idaho. Once completed, the project will feature 150-units serving those earning between 100-120% of area median income."
