        "text": "Groundwater Database (GWDB) Reports and Downloads\n\nThe Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Groundwater Database (GWDB) contains information on selected water wells, springs, oil/gas tests (that were originally intended to be or were converted to water wells), water levels, and water quality to gain representative information about aquifers in Texas to support water planning from a local to a more regional perspective.\n\nReports are designed to view a select set of information in the GWDB, not for viewing all records in the database. Reports allow the user to select or enter certain information to obtain records for that specific criteria. There is an option to export the reports to several different formats; although the reports are optimized for viewing as PDF and CSV formats.\n\nFor more information on how to navigate the groundwater reports, download the Explanation of the toolbar.\n\nTo download the entire GWDB or a shapefile of well locations, go to the Downloads section below.\n\nReports\n\nWell Search by Map\n\nThe TWDB Water Data Interactive (WDI) Groundwater Data Viewer contains well records for sites in both the GWDB and the Submitted Drillers Report Database. The default display from the link above is just for Groundwater Database sites. Click \"Groundwater\" at the top of the page to view other groundwater data, including well and plugging reports, and digital well logs from the BRACS (Brackish Resources Aquifer Characterization System) Database. Several base maps and layers, along with interactive tools, allow for viewing and downloading Texas groundwater data.\n\nRecord of Wells\n\nRecord of Wells by Aquifer\n\nSelect one aquifer and then one or multiple counties from the lists at the top of the page, then click the View Report button in the upper right. In the report, click the state well number for all available information on the well. Exported PDF page size is 11\" x 8.5\".\n\nRecord of Wells by County\n\nSelect one county and then one or multiple aquifers from the lists at the top of the page, then click the View Report button in the upper right. In the report, click the state well number for all available information on the well. Exported PDF page size is 11\" x 8.5\".\n\nRecord of Wells by Well\n\nEnter the state well number at the top of the page, then click the View Report button in the upper right. Exported PDF page size is 8.5\" x 11\".\n\nRecord of Wells Advanced Search\n\nEnter and/or select information in one or many of the text boxes at the top of the screen, then click the View Report button in the upper right. Entering partial information in the fields without drop down selections returns all records that meet that criteria, including partial matches. Exported PDF page size is 17â x 11â.\n\nWater Levels\n\nWater Levels by Aquifer\n\nSelect one aquifer and then one or multiple counties and then one or more observation types from the lists at the top of the page, then click the View Report button in the upper right. Exported PDF page size is 11\" x 8.5\".\n\nWater Levels by County\n\nSelect one county and then one or multiple aquifers and then one or more observation types from the lists at the top of the page, then click the View Report button in the upper right. Exported PDF page size is 11\" x 8.5\".\n\nWater Levels by Well\n\nEnter the state well number at the top of the page, then click the View Report button in the upper right. Exported PDF page size is 8.5\" x 11\".\n\nWater Levels Advanced Search\n\nEnter and/or select information in one or many of the text boxes at the top of the screen, then click the View Report button in the upper right. Entering partial information in the fields without drop down selections returns all records that meet that criteria, including partial matches. For Measurement Year FROM and Measurement Year TO, keep NULL checked to return all available measurements. Enter the same year in both fields to display all measurements for that year. Entering a year in the FROM and leaving TO checked NULL will display measurements from the year entered to present. Entering a year in the TO and leaving FROM checked NULL will display measurements from the beginning to the year entered. Exported PDF page size is 17â x 11â.\n\nWater Quality\n\nWater Quality by Aquifer\n\nSelect one aquifer and then one or multiple counties and then one or more parameters from the lists at the top of the page, then click the View Report button in the upper right. Exported PDF page size is 11\" x 8.5\".\n\nWater Quality by County\n\nSelect one county and then one or multiple aquifers and then one or more parameters from the lists at the top of the page, then click the View Report button in the upper right. Exported PDF page size is 11\" x 8.5\".\n\nWater Quality by Well\n\nEnter the state well number at the top of the page, then click the View Report button in the upper right. Exported PDF page size is 8.5\" x 11\".\n\nWater Quality Pivot\n\nThis is the old style water quality text file that displays the major cations and anions for each well along a row. Be advised that the values in this download may be detection limit values, not actual measured values. Please use the reports above to obtain all water quality values for the well and to check for detection limit values. Select the county below and press the \"Download CSV\" button to download the file.\n\nAnderson\n\nAndrews\n\nAngelina\n\nAransas\n\nArcher\n\nArmstrong\n\nAtascosa\n\nAustin\n\nBailey\n\nBandera\n\nBastrop\n\nBaylor\n\nBee\n\nBell\n\nBexar\n\nBlanco\n\nBorden\n\nBosque\n\nBowie\n\nBrazoria\n\nBrazos\n\nBrewster\n\nBriscoe\n\nBrooks\n\nBrown\n\nBurleson\n\nBurnet\n\nCaldwell\n\nCalhoun\n\nCallahan\n\nCameron\n\nCamp\n\nCarson\n\nCass\n\nCastro\n\nChambers\n\nCherokee\n\nChildress\n\nClay\n\nCochran\n\nCoke\n\nColeman\n\nCollin\n\nCollingsworth\n\nColorado\n\nComal\n\nComanche\n\nConcho\n\nCooke\n\nCoryell\n\nCottle\n\nCrane\n\nCrockett\n\nCrosby\n\nCulberson\n\nDallam\n\nDallas\n\nDawson\n\nDeaf Smith\n\nDelta\n\nDenton\n\nDeWitt\n\nDickens\n\nDimmit\n\nDonley\n\nDuval\n\nEastland\n\nEctor\n\nEdwards\n\nEl Paso\n\nEllis\n\nErath\n\nFalls\n\nFannin\n\nFayette\n\nFisher\n\nFloyd\n\nFoard\n\nFort Bend\n\nFranklin\n\nFreestone\n\nFrio\n\nGaines\n\nGalveston\n\nGarza\n\nGillespie\n\nGlasscock\n\nGoliad\n\nGonzales\n\nGray\n\nGrayson\n\nGregg\n\nGrimes\n\nGuadalupe\n\nHale\n\nHall\n\nHamilton\n\nHansford\n\nHardeman\n\nHardin\n\nHarris\n\nHarrison\n\nHartley\n\nHaskell\n\nHays\n\nHemphill\n\nHenderson\n\nHidalgo\n\nHill\n\nHockley\n\nHood\n\nHopkins\n\nHouston\n\nHoward\n\nHudspeth\n\nHunt\n\nHutchinson\n\nIrion\n\nJack\n\nJackson\n\nJasper\n\nJeff Davis\n\nJefferson\n\nJim Hogg\n\nJim Wells\n\nJohnson\n\nJones\n\nKarnes\n\nKaufman\n\nKendall\n\nKenedy\n\nKent\n\nKerr\n\nKimble\n\nKing\n\nKinney\n\nKleberg\n\nKnox\n\nLa Salle\n\nLamar\n\nLamb\n\nLampasas\n\nLavaca\n\nLee\n\nLeon\n\nLiberty\n\nLimestone\n\nLipscomb\n\nLive Oak\n\nLlano\n\nLoving\n\nLubbock\n\nLynn\n\nMadison\n\nMarion\n\nMartin\n\nMason\n\nMatagorda\n\nMaverick\n\nMcCulloch\n\nMcLennan\n\nMcMullen\n\nMedina\n\nMenard\n\nMidland\n\nMilam\n\nMills\n\nMitchell\n\nMontague\n\nMontgomery\n\nMoore\n\nMorris\n\nMotley\n\nNacogdoches\n\nNavarro\n\nNewton\n\nNolan\n\nNueces\n\nOchiltree\n\nOldham\n\nOrange\n\nPalo Pinto\n\nPanola\n\nParker\n\nParmer\n\nPecos\n\nPolk\n\nPotter\n\nPresidio\n\nRains\n\nRandall\n\nReagan\n\nReal\n\nRed River\n\nReeves\n\nRefugio\n\nRoberts\n\nRobertson\n\nRockwall\n\nRunnels\n\nRusk\n\nSabine\n\nSan Augustine\n\nSan Jacinto\n\nSan Patricio\n\nSan Saba\n\nSchleicher\n\nScurry\n\nShackelford\n\nShelby\n\nSherman\n\nSmith\n\nSomervell\n\nStarr\n\nStephens\n\nSterling\n\nStonewall\n\nSutton\n\nSwisher\n\nTarrant\n\nTaylor\n\nTerrell\n\nTerry\n\nThrockmorton\n\nTitus\n\nTom Green\n\nTravis\n\nTrinity\n\nTyler\n\nUpshur\n\nUpton\n\nUvalde\n\nVal Verde\n\nVan Zandt\n\nVictoria\n\nWalker\n\nWaller\n\nWard\n\nWashington\n\nWebb\n\nWharton\n\nWheeler\n\nWichita\n\nWilbarger\n\nWillacy\n\nWilliamson\n\nWilson\n\nWinkler\n\nWise\n\nWood\n\nYoakum\n\nYoung\n\nZapata\n\nZavala\n\nDownloads\n\nFull GWDB SQL Server Download\n\nPipe \"|\" delimited text files of all lookup and data tables from the GWDB, updated nightly.
