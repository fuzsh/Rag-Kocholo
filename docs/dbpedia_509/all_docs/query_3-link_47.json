Two computers are available at the front counter for public access to records and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data including:\n\nAerial Photography\n\nContours\n\nFloodplain\n\nOwnership Data\n\nParcel Lines\n\nRoads\n\nSubdivision Lot Lines and Text\n\nTaxing Districts\n\nOnline Access\n\nProperty records are available online under the Personal Property and Real Estate Search. The Assessor’s Online GIS Services offers a Property Viewer that allows searches by:\n\nOwner\n\nParcel ID\n\nProperty Address\n\nSpatially Zooming to a Specific Area\n\nIf you are looking for more specific information it may require a visit to the office. Additional web applications can be found on the GIS Applications page including a Map Gallery for PDF maps.\n\nFor Purchase\n\nThe assessor’s data files (tax rolls) are available for purchase in digital format. Data can also be requested outside the scope of the Assessor’s responsibilities or beyond a reasonable expectation.\n\nThe Assessor’s Office maintains a comprehensive GIS division whose duties are to:\n\nMaintain property maps and taxing entity boundaries\n\nPerform in-house analysis of data\n\nProvide data on the website\n\nAs a benefit to the taxpayers and businesses; the division can perform reproducible maps and custom work including analysis when time allows. A fee may be charged to cover the cost of creating this data.\n\nWhat Type of Map Do You Need?\n\nPlot Plan or Site Plan (Code Enforcement (FKA Building Department))\n\nThe definition of a plot (site) plan is a plan showing the property boundary lines, building setback lines, and the location of a structure with distances to the property lines. Other elements include the location of North, driveway and road location, utilities, private well/septic, etc. The subtle difference between a plot plan and a site plan is that a plot plan is for a single residence or single building whereas a site plan encompasses a larger area; such as an industrial park, commercial development, or large subdivision.\n\nThe Assessor’s office does not have the authority to produce plot (site) plans that meet that definition. It is something a land surveyor or engineer creates. Code Enforcement (FKA Building Department) does not accept aerial maps any longer (March 18, 2021).\n\nPlat Map or Subdivision Plat\n\nPlat Maps or Subdivision Plat Maps are available from the Recorder of Deeds Department.\n\nA plat map or subdivision plat is drawn by land surveyors and submitted to the Jefferson County planning division for approval. Once approved the plat map is recorded with the Recorder of Deeds. Plat maps or subdivision plats normally show subdivision boundaries, lots, lot numbers, building setback lines and easements. These items are not always provided on the plats. This is a true legal representation of the property.\n\nSurvey (Contracted Through a Land Surveyor)\n\nA survey is researched, performed by, and drawn by land surveyors. A survey contains the legal description of a property including the bearings and distances (metes and bounds), and other items like building setbacks, easements, etc. Surveys are recorded with the Recorder of Deeds at the individual’s discretion; surveys are not required to be recorded with Jefferson County. A survey is a report of the results of a field survey performed by a licensed land surveyor and can be used to prove the legal boundaries of a property.\n\nTo find the true location of property lines; a survey or plat map/subdivision plat is required. All other maps are for taxing purposes only and cannot be used to locate property lines accurately.\n\nTypes of Maps the Assessor Provides\n\nGIS Parcel Map (Property Map)\n\nAerial background with:\n\nLot Lines\n\nParcel Numbers\n\nProperty Lines\n\nRoad Names\n\nRequests are accepted for contour lines (2 or 10 foot) and various years of aerials. Map sizes are 8 x 11, 24 x 24, and 36 x 36.\n\nGIS Custom Map (Property Map)\n\nCustom maps include data that may or may not be available on the GIS Parcel Map that is requested in such a way that the standard GIS Parcel Map is not applicable.\n\nExample: highlight parcels within 1 mile of subject parcel or city boundary map showing properties that have 10 or more acres.\n\nTaxing District Maps (Countywide Map)\n\nAmbulance\n\nFire\n\nMunicipalities\n\nSchool\n\nSpecial Road Districts\n\nPolitical District Maps (Countywide Map)\n\nCounty Council\n\nMissouri House of Representatives\n\nMissouri State Senate\n\nPolitical Townships\n\nU.S. Congressional Districts\n\nVoting Precinct\n\nRoad Map (Countywide Map)\n\nRoad Map - Roads including major and minor with municipalities as reference.\n\nPublic Land Survey System & Locator Maps (Countywide Map)"
