Flour mills, factories, churches, and forges are also noted according to the legend in the lower left. The map was drawn by David Burr in 1829 and engraved by Rowdon, Clark & Company of Albany.

He is best known for his atlas of New York State. \"The Atlas of the State of New York was published in 1830 [although it bears the date 1829].

Robert Mills was born in Charleston in 1781 and studied under James Hoban, the Irish-born architect who designed the White House. In Washington, Mills made the acquaintance of Thomas Jefferson and studied in Jefferson's extensive architecture library before going to work as an assistant to Benjamin Latrobe in 1803. By 1809 he was established as an architect in Philadelphia, doing work in Baltimore and Richmond as well. In 1820, back in residence in South Carolina, he was appointed to that state's department of Public Works. In 1825, Mills published the first state atlas of South Carolina; indeed it would be the first American atlas devoted to any single state. Mills' Atlas was intimately associated with the trend in internal improvements that flourished in the United States in the first decades of the nineteenth century, and the maps in his atlas take great care to show the roads and rivers that were so important in facilitating transportation, communication, and commerce. The creation of these maps was an outgrowth of this trend, as states commissioned engineers and surveyors to create detailed and current maps. Between 1817 and 1821 manuscript maps were created for each district, based on astronomical, geodetic, and topographic surveys and field work, and using the latest scientific techniques. Aware of the surveying and cartographic work that had been undertaken in the state, Mills became determined to make the individual manuscript district maps more widely available by having them printed as an atlas. Mills undertook redrawing the district maps to make them uniform with each other. As part of this undertaking he traveled throughout the state, adding his personal observations and improvements to the maps. \"Mills's Atlas of the State of South Carolina is a cartographic milestone because of its use of astronomical and scientific surveys for its district maps, its position as the first atlas of an individual state, and the impetus it gave to local and regional cartography in the early decades of the nineteenth century\" (Ristow p.219). The present work was published, as Mills writes in the Preface, \"in order that it might serve as an appendix to the author's Atlas of the State . A correct idea of the several sections of the state could not be formed without it.\" It contains an immense amount of information relating to the state's history, natural history, climate, population, government, revenues and expenditures, internal improvements and more. \"This book is, in fact, a history of every thing connected with the State of South Carolina, of general or local interest\" (Sabin).

With one state map by Finley and 28 district maps which were \"improved for Mills' Atlas\" from surveys done for John Wilson's 1822 'Map of South Carolina', which had also been engraved by Tanner. These latter maps are very detailed: they show the names of land owners, local taverns, Churches, mills, roads, swamps, and mountains. The colony, named Carolina after King Charles I, which became divided in 1710 into South Carolina and North Carolina, was one of the thirteen original colonies of North America. Spanish and French explorers arriving in the 16th century found a land inhabited by many small tribes of Native Americans, including the Cherokees and the Catawbas, and their attempts at settlement failed. By 1670, however, a permanent English settlement was established on the coast near present day Charleston which became an important center of commerce and culture. But the interior was settled more slowly by farmers and traders, who struggled with the diminishing tribes of Native Americans, who were forced to move ever westwards. In the 1820s, as the surveys for this atlas were being made, land speculators officially called for the removal of Native American communities that impeded white settlement. These particularly included the tribes of South Carolina, \"the Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, and Seminole Indians of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida--the so-called Five Civilized Tribes. Thomas L. McKenney, head of the federal Indian Office from 1824 to 1830, viewing American Indians as children, proposed their removal west of the Mississippi River. Some missionaries, eager to convert and \"civilize\" Indians in isolated western lands, welcomed his rhetoric. In 1829, newly elected President Andrew Jackson endorsed the Indian-removal campaign. Signed into law on 28 May 1830, the Indian Removal Act empowered the president to exchange Western lands for lands held by eastern tribes\" (ANB online). By the time of the American Revolution, \"South Carolina was one of the richest colonies in America. Its merchants and planters formed a strong governing class, contributing many leaders to the fight for independence. More Revolutionary War battles and skirmishes were fought in South Carolina than any other state, including major engagements at Sullivan's Island, Camden, Kings Mountain, and Cowpens. South Carolina ratified the United States Constitution on May 23, 1788, becoming the eighth state to enter the union With the invention of the cotton gin, cotton became a major crop, particularly in the upcountry. A new capital city, Columbia , was founded in the center of the state, reducing somewhat the political power of the lowcountry elite. Dissatisfaction with the federal government and its tariff policies grew during this period, however. In the 1820s South Carolinian John C. Calhoun developed the theory of nullification, by which a state could reject any federal law it considered to be a violation of its rights. Armed conflict was avoided during this period, but by 1860 tensions between the state and the federal government reached a climax. Unhappy over restrictions on free trade and about calls for the abolition of slavery, South Carolina seceded from the union on December 20, 1860, the first of the Southern states to do so.
