        "text": "Every year, the acquisitions specialists at the Special Collections and Archives (SCA) at Denver Public Library add hundreds of new items to the collections. A large percentage of these acquisitions are the latest scholarship from university and commercial presses on our core collections such as the Western History Collection, the Blair-Caldwell African American Research Library, and our Conservation Collection. Here are a few of our latest acquisitions.\n\n1. World geo-graphic atlas : a composite\n\nof man's environment, Bayer, Herbert, Container Corporation of America, 1953\n\nThis ground-breaking atlas was privately printed for the Container Corporation of America (CCA) in 1953 and was edited and designed by the influential Bauhaus designer, Herbert Bayer. Bayer worked as a consultant for the CCA starting in 1940 and continued working with them until the 1980s.\n\nWhile the pairing of a Bauhaus artist and a giant corporation that makes boxes seems odd, it was made possible by CCA head Walter P. Paepcke. Paepcke and Bayer had similar notions about where industry and art intersected and CCA adopted many of Bayer's designs and concepts into its containers over the decades.\n\nThe idea behind the atlas was to create a work where traditional maps would be showcased alongside graphical presentations of information. For example, a map of The World's Prominent Economies is accompanied by a graphical interpretation of the Occupational Structure of Selected Areas. This idea would eventually be known as the infographic by later generations.\n\nCCA originally published 30,000 copies for private distribution and it seems as though most of those are still in private hands. WorldCat lists just 30 libraries holding this title, including DPL.\n\nWe purchased this item for $388.00 from an eBay listing that was actually spotted by one of our sharp-eyed customers. We'd tried unsuccessfully to purchase the Atlas a couple of months back but weren't quick enough to acquire it at auction.\n\nThe Atlas is in fair to good condition and did not need any conservation. This a great addition to the collection that's available for viewing at the Central Branch.\n\n2. 北米每日年鑑 = Hokubei Mainichi year book, Hokubei Mainchi, 1951\n\nPublished on what is now extremely brittle newsprint, this directory of Japanese American people and Japanese American-owned businesses is a valuable research tool for historians and genealogists. The year book presents a snapshot of America's post-war Japanese American community and includes biographical information such as whether or not the person or their parents were born in Japan. Though the year book focuses mainly on the West Coast, its 770 pages cover the entire country.\n\nBecause of its extremely fragile condition, the Hokubei yearbook cannot be made available to the public in its current state. After consulting a conservator, we made the difficult decision to remove the pages containing Colorado residents and businesses and sleeve them individually so that researchers can work with them. Until the remainder of the conservation work is done, this is the only portion of this item that is available to researchers. We hope to have the rest of the book available at a later date."
