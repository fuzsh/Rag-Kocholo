Needless to say that this sheet will need a lot of calibration but I'm confident that it can be improved with testing.\n\nFor those interested please find below an editable copy(best for everyone to make their own copy and tinker with them... and maybe share results, great finds etc)\n\ndocs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17__NcD6aUEQYb6-cGo_Ec7cWfO3H8S096j_VIK1QA38/edit?usp=sharing\n\nCheers\n\nPost by Aimstrong on\n\nAfter the first batch of tests some results (take this with a grain of salt... it's pretty soon to jump to conclusions)\n\nConfirmed Info (cheers and many thanks andrew for the tips)\n\nTraits for all crew (starting and not) are derived by: Faction ,Job ,Planet attributes (danger, atmo),Zone attributes (govt, military, econ, econ type).\n\nWe're looking at atmo extremes (hard vacuum, very dense, etc) and high danger worlds to produce hardened recruits.\n\nAimstrong's Educated Guesses (somewhat confirmed via in-game experience, but also not 100% bullet-proof TL:DR unreliable)\n\nDevice Freak trait is more frequent to be seen from ECON TYPE=High Tech World and from SPY main Captain profession.\n\nThe run of the mill recruitment(base line) from almost all the worlds (w/o recruitment talents) it's nice for NON-CC crew or if you are in a bind for a CC crew.\n\nPlanet Sizes should have an impact on recruit attributes. Higher Gravity higher Strength Fortitude(as planet Density is not available to calculate the mass we assume the larger the planet the greater the gravity).\n\nI see this as a great bonus multiplier along with Planet Danger,Planet Atmosphere,Planet Type => Bonus Multiplier = Planet Size*Type*Atmo*Danger\n\nRNG plays a factor in attribute spread; averages stay the same between certain limits depending on the confirmed factors-- the Zone Stats weights more in determining stats than the bonus multipliers\n\nRecruitment talents boost stats a lot between +(2-4) on every attribute on average from base line(if recruitment is done in almost optimal conditions)\n\nRecruitment talents&hired from contacts with influence boost stats even further (4-6) on every attribute on average from base line(if recruitment is done in almost optimal conditions)\n\nBonus Skills will eat a bit from the average stats points. There are 2 max bonus skills that can show up on every recruit with a 0-6 skill range."
