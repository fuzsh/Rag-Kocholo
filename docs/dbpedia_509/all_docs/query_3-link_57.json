        "text": "I must write a paper in APA style including citations and references. Where do I start?\n\nAPA style focuses on the needs of presenting psychological information. APA style generally omits the general rules explained in widely available style books and examples of usage that have nothing to do with the behavioral and social sciences.\n\nA great starting point for finding information about the APA style is in the 6th edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, which is a large reference book that contains hundreds of guidelines on how to format references, statistics, tables, punctuation, and grammar. It also contains writing tips and instructions about how to format your papers according to APA. You can find copies of this publication in the Bellevue University bookstore, Writing Center, and Library.\n\nIf a periodical includes a volume number, italicize it. Then change to regular type and give the page range without \"pp.\" Example: 34(1), 40-42. If the periodical does not use volume numbers, include \"pp.\" before the page numbers, so the reader will understand that the numbers refer to pagination. Example: title, pp. 40-42. Use \"p.\" if the source is a page or less. Example: p. 1.\n\nAPA style calls for a list of references instead of a bibliography or works cited page. The requirements for a reference list is that all references cited in the text of a paper must be listed alphabetically by the first author's last name. Therefore, all references in the reference list must appear somewhere in the paper and be cited parenthetically.\n\nThe list of references is double spaced and uses the hanging indent.\n\nA hanging indent is how the sources in a reference list are typed. The first line of the hanging indent is written flush with the left margin, and any additional lines are indented a few spaces (usually a tab or about five spaces) to the right of the left margin. See example below:\n\nNicol, A. A. M., & Pexman, P. M. (1999). Presenting your findings: A practical\n\nguide for creating tables. Washington, DC: American Psychological\n\nAssociation.\n\nThe above questions come from:\n\nFrequently Asked Questions. (2003). Retrieved March 26, 2003, from http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/index.aspx\n\nUsually, you want to use the quoted person's name before writing the quote. Then, in parentheses at the end of the quote, put a 'p.' for the page number followed by the page number.\n\nExample: Bayam (1969) concludes that journalists \"must speak in a voice that is both institutional and representational, hierarchical as well as relational\" (p. 111).\n\nThere are two ways that you can do this. Either you can mention the author's name before the information is presented. Then put the date in parentheses like in this example: Rogers (1994) compared the reaction times... Or you can leave out the author's name and put it in the citation with the date like in this example: A recent study of reaction times found that... (Rogers, 1994).\n\nI am using an author who has cited another author or authors, but I have no idea how to cite the sources in the text of my paper.\n\nUse the citation information of both the secondary source and the primary source.\n\nExample: Seidenberg and McClelland's study (as cited in Coltheart, Curtis,\n\nAtkins, & Haller, 1993)... You would also want to make sure that it was the primary source (Coltheart, etc.) that you cite in your reference list.\n\nHowever, APA strongly advises against these sorts of citations. Locate the original source (in this case, Seidenberg and McClelland) whenever possible before resorting to a secondary source citation. The reason for this is because you are relying on the secondary source authorâ€™s interpretation of the original source when you use this approach.\n\nIf I am referring merely to a website but not using any specific pages, sections, or paragraphs, how should I cite it?\n\nProvide the address to the website in the text. No additional information is placed in the reference list since you are not using any information from the website in your paper itself.\n\nExample:... (http://www.bellevue.edu)...\n\nAuthor's name. (Year). Title of book. (Number of edition). Place of publication: Publisher. Example 1:\n\nHoff, R. (1992). I can see you naked: A new revised edition of the national\n\nbestseller on making fearless presentations (New rev. ed.). Kansas City,\n\nMO: Andrews and McMeel.\n\nExample 2:\n\nPasachoof, J. (1992). Field guide to the stars and planets (3rd ed.). Boston:\n\nHoughton Mifflin.\n\nNote: Remember, with first editions you never have to make any special notes about it. The only time you use an edition citation is when it is not an original first edition.\n\n\"Continuous pagination\" is where the entire volume of a journal never starts over with page 1 on a new issue. So, let's say in Volume 1, Issue 1, the journal starts on page 1 and ends on page 200. In the next issue, Issue 2, it would start on page 201 - 400. Then continue on like that for the rest of the issues in that volume. \"Issue number pagination\" is where every new issue always starts over with page number 1. So Issue 1 starts on page 1, Issue 2 starts on page 1, etc.\n\nAuthor's name. (Year). Title of article. Title of journal/magazine, volume number (or issue number - only if issue starts with page 1 rather than continuously paginated through all issues), page numbers.\n\nExample 1:\n\nJones, H.M. (1997). The attractions of stupidity. The St. Croix Review, 30(2),\n\n6-10.\n\nExample 2:\n\nGerry, R. (1997, April-June). Tempo training for freestyle. Swimming\n\nTechnique, 34(1), 40-42.\n\nNote: Remember, the \"April-June\" follows this examples \"year\" because it is a magazine article, and when doing magazines, you include (Year, Month Day), method.\n\nNote: Because pagination begins anew with each new issue, it is necessary to include the issue number in parentheses after the volume number.\n\n(Cite as you would a printed source, followed by) Retrieved date of access (month, day, year) from (URL address)\n\nExample 1:\n\nAdams, R.G.

Otherwise, treat such references as unauthorized. Do not italize the title. Specify in brackets that the source is computer software, program, or language. List the location and the organization's name that produced the program. Add any necessary information for identifying the program (in this example, the report number) in parentheses at the entry's conclusion. Do not add a period at the end of the citation if it ends with a website address.\n\nUsually, personal communications, which are not archived, should not be included in reference lists and cited just within the text: Smith, Fred (\"personal communication,\" January 21, 1999).\n\nIf the communication is archived, it would be cited as:\n\nAuthor's name.
