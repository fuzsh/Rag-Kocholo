        "text": "I purchased an historic map, 16x24 inch. It is beautifully printed on heavy stock. The lettering, colors, and details of the map are crisp and easy to read. I am highly satisfied and would certainly purchase from Historic Pictoric again!\n\nOrdered the Pan American Midway print to fit a lovely thrift-store gilded frame. I love showing off Buffalo's rich history and this is a pretty entertaining photo from 1901. Prompt shipping. Sturdy packaging.\n\nI received my print within days of ordering, and it arrived well packed in a mailing tube. The print is high quality and exactly as advertised. I will use Historic Pictoric again in the future!\n\nExcellent product. Great fidelity in reproduction of the original. Fine/minute details were sharp, colors were vibrant, and thickness, texture and overall feel and quality of the paper were excellent. Very satisfied with my purchase.\n\nI have purchased six maps from Historic Pictoric. I find the quality to be excellent. Their customers service is also excellent. Outstanding! I called to exchange a few for different sizes and I could not have asked for a better experience.\n\nThe original map I ordered lacked some of the detail that I had hoped for, but they responded with several more map possibilities to choose from. Excellent service- a far step beyond what anyone expects from online purchases.\n\nI am a owner of 5 maps from Historic Pictoric. From Okinawa, 1945, Europe 1940-1945 battle maps. Now they’re helping me with the battle of Gettysburg. These maps are so much superior to the map on a page in a book. I have framed two of them."
