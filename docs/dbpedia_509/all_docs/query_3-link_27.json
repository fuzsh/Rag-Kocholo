        "text": "Explore global water balance in a Living Atlas application\n\nArcGIS Living Atlas is a great place to find authoritative data. But you can also access applications that have been built from this data, which turn layers into useful tools. Next, you'll explore an app to gain more context into water levels in both Ethiopia and Egypt.\n\nOn the ArcGIS Living Atlas website, click the Apps tab.\n\nThis page offers a curated set of apps. These apps do more than just show a dataset. They present information in a guided format that helps you better understand the data as you explore it.\n\nScroll down and click the Water Balance App thumbnail.\n\nClick View application.\n\nThis app uses the same soil moisture layer you explored in the previous steps, but it offers a more detailed interpretation.\n\nIn the search bar, copy and paste 11°12′55″N 35°05′35″E and press Enter.\n\nThis is the location of the Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam.\n\nA pink dot appears on the map in northwestern Ethiopia, and a chart appears at the bottom of the app, showing change in soil moisture over time.\n\nPoint to the different areas of the chart to see how the data values change.\n\nSoil moisture in this region shows a clear seasonal pattern. Moisture peaks for a few months of the year and then decreases. The variation in soil moisture between the rainy and dry seasons each year is usually around 200 mm.\n\nAs you move the pointer along the middle chart, the chart on the far right displays the values of all analyzed years for each month. This makes it easier to see, for example, how July of the current year compares to July in previous years.\n\nThe highlands of Ethiopia form the headwaters for the Nile River. This area receives a fair amount of rain, so there is always moisture in the soil. Even its lowest value of 409 is relatively high compared to the Nile Delta region, which you'll explore next.\n\nIn the search bar, type Nile Delta and press Enter.\n\nThe highest soil moisture value in this dataset is still lower than 409. Additionally, the middle chart is relatively flat, indicating that this region has little variance in soil moisture. Instead of fluctuating with seasonal rains, as it does in Ethiopia, soil moisture here remains consistently low.\n\nTo the left is a list of values that also updates as you move the pointer over the middle chart. When precipitation is higher than runoff and evapotranspiration rates, soil moisture is in a state of recharge. Sometimes there may be a lot of precipitation, as there was in February 2012, but this is still exceeded by runoff and evapotranspiration. Even though there was a lot of rain that month, soil moisture was depleted.\n\nSoil Moisture is one of several layers that you can explore using the Water Balance App.\n\nAt the top of the app, click the drop-down menu, which is currently set to Soil Moisture. In the menu, choose Precipitation.\n\nThe map and charts update with information about precipitation but remain focused on Cairo.\n\nZoom out until you can see most of Africa.\n\nOn this map, you can see that Egypt receives far less rain than Ethiopia. Yet Egypt still has enough water to support agriculture and large cities. This water flows from Ethiopia, via the Nile River. If a new dam caused a reduction in water availability downstream, it could create problems for both Egypt and Sudan.\n\nClose the app and return to the ArcGIS Living Atlas website.\n\nClose the Water Balance App screen and scroll to the top of the page.\n\nClick the Contribute tab.\n\nArcGIS Living Atlas content is always growing. On this page, you can learn about how to add your own data for others to find and use in their maps and analyses.\n\nClick the Nominate Your Content button and click the My Contributions tab.\n\nThe maps, layers, and other content from your ArcGIS Online account are listed here. Before you can nominate one of your items to ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, it must have a fully documented item detail page. Once it is nominated, a curator at Esri will review the item and communicate with you about its eligibility. To learn more about sharing your content with ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, see the Share Your Content to ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World ArcGIS StoryMaps tutorial.\n\nClose the ArcGIS Living Atlas website.\n\nArcGIS Living Atlas of the World allows you to find content for your GIS workflows or contribute your own content for others to use. ArcGIS Living Atlas doesn’t just provide raw data; it offers preconfigured layers, maps, and apps that provide greater context and understanding, making it faster and easier for you to find the trends and patterns you'll explore next.\n\nYou've learned how to browse and explore some of this content. Next, you'll add ArcGIS Living Atlas content to a map in ArcGIS Online and make some small changes that will allow you to choose which story to tell with the data.\n\nConfigure a feature layer from Living Atlas\n\nWith this map, you can see where people live. Much of the administration in the United States is managed at the county level, however, and you are curious about comparing those borders with actual settlement patterns. Next, you'll add a layer representing county boundaries to your map.\n\nIn the Layers pane, click Add. In the Add layer pane, click the My content drop-down menu and choose Living Atlas.\n\nIn the search bar, type usa counties.\n\nFind the layer named USA Counties Generalized Boundaries and click the Add button.\n\nClick the back button to return to the Layers pane.\n\nThe USA Counties Generalized Boundaries layer now covers the land-cover layer. Don't be discouraged, like many layers in ArcGIS Living Atlas, you can easily change its symbology to suit your needs and show county outlines.\n\nEnsure the USA Counties (Generalized) layer is selected in the Layers pane, and on the Settings toolbar, click Styles.\n\nIn the Styles pane, under Pick a style, for Location (single symbol) card, click Style options.\n\nClick the symbol under Symbol styles.\n\nThe Symbol style window appears.\n\nFor Fill color, click No color.\n\nClick the Outline color and in the Select color window that appears, for Hex, type 999999 and press Enter.\n\nIf you are using an ArcGIS Enterprise account, expand Outline and expand Custom color. For Hex, type 999999.\n\nClick Done.\n\nThe outlines are still distracting from the settlement patterns, so you will make them transparent.\n\nIn the Settings toolbar, click Properties.\n\nIn the Properties pane, under Appearance adjust or verify that the Transparency slider is set to 50%.\n\nNow the county boundaries are still visible as a reference layer, but they no longer distract from the main focus of the map.\n\nIn the Change Style pane, click OK, and click Done.\n\nYou have now configured two layers from ArcGIS Living Atlas: a raster layer showing land cover and a feature layer showing boundaries.\n\nFrom this map you can see that settlement in this region does not conform to administrative boundaries. While development does tend to follow major roads, it flows freely over county lines. You may have seen maps of the United States that depict the population of each county. This map shows you instead how the population in each county is unevenly distributed.\n\nOn the Contents toolbar, click Save and open and choose Save as.\n\nIn the Save map window, enter the following:\n\nFor Title, type Urban Land in the United States.\n\nFor Tags, type Living Atlas, landcover, counties, urbanization.\n\nFor Summary, type This map shows urbanization patterns along the eastern coast of the United States.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou can find this map later on the My Content tab in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise and use it in ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS StoryMaps, apps, and more.\n\nFor information about sharing subscriber content publicly, see Using Living Atlas subscriber content in public maps and apps. To learn how to further customize and use ArcGIS Living Atlas layers in ArcGIS Online, check out the Make Living Atlas Content Your Own ArcGIS StoryMaps tutorial.\n\nYou've now created a web map exploring the urban landscape in the United States using ArcGIS Living Atlas content in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise. ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World allows you to make custom web maps with high-quality data, without doing any data processing or hosting on your own.\n\nNext, you'll learn how to use ArcGIS Living Atlas content for analysis in ArcGIS Pro.\n\nFind Living Atlas layers in ArcGIS Pro\n\nIn this scenario, disaster response agencies need to plan for allocating resources during a hurricane disaster drill. To plan for future disasters, you'll use the historic path of Hurricane Irma as an example. The hurricane forecast cone shows the potential for landfall in Florida, and disaster planners want to know how many nursing homes may be affected.\n\nFirst, you'll open an existing hurricane planning map.\n\nDownload the Hurricane Irma Advisory 29 map package.\n\nDouble-click the downloaded file to open it in ArcGIS Pro.\n\nA map of the projected path of Hurricane Irma appears.\n\nThis data is provided by the National Hurricane Center and represents a snapshot in time from September 6, 2017. The forecast cone shows the probable path of the hurricane based on knowledge the National Hurricane Center had at that time.\n\nYou want to use ArcGIS Living Atlas to find nursing home locations that fall within the forecast cone. First, you'll make sure you are signed in to your ArcGIS Online account so you can access ArcGIS Living Atlas content.\n\nIf necessary, at the top of the window, sign in to your ArcGIS organization account.\n\nOne way to access ArcGIS Living Atlas content in ArcGIS Pro is through the Catalog pane. Your Catalog pane may be closed or hidden behind other panes.\n\nIf you are using an ArcGIS Enterprise account, to add the Nursing Homes layer, on the ribbon, click the Map tab. In the Layer group, click the bottom portion of the Add Data button, and choose From Path. In the window that appears, paste the URL https://services2.arcgis.com/FiaPA4ga0iQKduv3/arcgis/rest/services/NH_ProviderInfo_shp_1/FeatureServer and click Add. Skip the following steps and resume the tutorial on step 10.\n\nOn the ribbon, click the View tab. In the Windows group, click Reset Panes and choose Reset Panes for Mapping (Default).\n\nThe Catalog pane appears.\n\nIn the Catalog pane, click the Portal tab and click Living Atlas.\n\nThis takes you to the same set of curated layers you saw in ArcGIS Online and on the ArcGIS Living Atlas website. You can also filter using categories.\n\nClick Filter, expand Categories, and click People.\n\nThe filtered list includes many layers that could contain relevant information to overlay with an incoming hurricane, including national shelters and public schools. For now, you are interested in the impact the storm may have on nursing homes.\n\nIn the search bar, type nursing homes and press Enter.\n\nIn the list of results, point to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services - Nursing Homes layer.\n\nA window appears with basic metadata for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services - Nursing Homes item, including the owner and URL.\n\nThe Path link for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services - Nursing Homes layer will open the item page for the layer, where you can locate the service URL for the layer: https://services2.arcgis.com/FiaPA4ga0iQKduv3/arcgis/rest/services/NH_ProviderInfo_shp_1/FeatureServer.\n\nRight-click the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services - Nursing Homes item owned by Federal User Community and choose Add To Current Map.\n\nThe layer adds to the map and the Contents pane.\n\nTip:\n\nYou can also add ArcGIS Living Atlas layers to ArcGIS Pro by clicking the Map tab on the ribbon, and in the Layer group, click Add Data. Learn more about Data or Data From Path options.\n\nNext, you'll find the layer's metadata to ensure that it is the correct data for your workflow.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click CMS_NursingHomes_A and choose Properties.\n\nThe Layer Properties window appears.\n\nClick the Metadata tab.\n\nThe summary, description, credits, and use limitations for the ArcGIS Living Atlas layer are listed.\n\nThe Description states that the purpose of the layer is to provide accurate locations for high concentrations of people who require constant nursing care and have significant deficiencies with activities of daily living.\n\nClose the Layer Properties window, click Cancel.\n\nUse Living Atlas content in analysis\n\nYou want to know how many nursing homes are at risk from the hurricane. But the symbols are too cluttered on the map to tell. You can change the symbology to make it less cluttered, but there will still be too many features to easily count. Instead, you'll use the Summarize Within geoprocessing tool.\n\nOn the ribbon, click the Analysis tab. In the Geoprocessing group, click the Tools button.\n\nThe Geoprocessing pane appears.\n\nIn the Geoprocessing pane, search for summarize within. Click Summarize Within (Analysis Tools).\n\nYou can use this tool to overlay the polygon of the hurricane's forecast cone with the nursing home layer points and calculate attribute field statistics for those points that fall within the cone.\n\nIn the Geoprocessing pane, for Input Polygons, choose Forecast Cone. For Input Summary Features, choose CMS_NursingHomes_A.\n\nBy default, the tool counts the number of features within the input polygon. Therefore, no summary fields need to be defined.\n\nAt the bottom of the Geoprocessing pane, click Run.\n\nA new polygon feature named ForecastCone_SummarizeWithin appears on the map.\n\nClick the polygon on the map to open its pop-up.\n\nThe pop-up displays all the attributes for the forecast cone feature, as well as a Count of Points attribute. This indicates that there are 569 nursing homes that may be at risk from this hurricane. Your number may differ if the nursing home layer has been updated.\n\nClose the pop-up.\n\nClose ArcGIS Pro without saving.\n\nYou used ArcGIS Living Atlas content to perform analysis in ArcGIS Pro. In life-threatening situations such as a hurricane, the faster you can find answers, the better chance you have of saving lives. With ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, you can find authoritative data and incorporate it into your analysis workflows immediately, helping you plan for disasters faster.\n\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to find and use ArcGIS Living Atlas content via the ArcGIS Living Atlas website, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Enterprise, and ArcGIS Pro. You used this authoritative data in an app, a web map, and an analysis.\n\nYou can find more tutorials in the tutorial gallery."
