With their signature fluted silhouette, all-metal body, and hand crank, Atlas mills have been made in the same way in Greece for more than 300 years.\n\nOriginally created as an adaptation of coffee mills used by Greek soldiers, which themselves were based on Turkish coffee grinders, these iconic mills truly grind, rather than crush, the contents. The result? More aromatic, uniformly ground spices. The adjustable grind can turn out seasoning both coarse and superfine."
