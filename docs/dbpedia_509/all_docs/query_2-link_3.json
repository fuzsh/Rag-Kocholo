        "text": "By Robert Singletary, Special for the Nickel’s Worth\n\nIn 1881, Marcus Wright came to Idaho Territory and helped create the town of Rathdrum and organize Kootenai County. He also established the Atlas Tie Company in 1909, which was located about three miles west of Coeur d’Alene on the Spokane River. Wright was the first in the region to specialize in cutting ties for railroad use. He had contracts with most of the major railroads that ran through northern Idaho. Known as the “Tie King,” Wright was one of the most successful businessmen in the region. The photo above shows the Atlas Tie Company in 1915."
