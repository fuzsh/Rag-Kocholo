        "text": "This year’s Lollapalooza in Chicago may have been a particularly humid one, but that didn’t deter perspiring attendees from making the most of the four-day event. Held Aug. 1-4, the international festival’s flagship midwest iteration showcased a variety of talent — both revered and rising.\n\nAmong Lolla 2024's highlights, Chappell Roan drew an expectedly enormous crowd to Grant Park on Thursday, while GRAMMY winner Tyla captivated audiences with a lighthearted and entertaining anglicism. Friday offered a diversity of artists, from K-pop boy group Stray Kids, to electronic vet Zedd and GRAMMY-winning Icelandic jazz singer Laufey, who performed with the Chicago Philharmonic. J-pop stars YOASOBI and the Killers closed the festival on Saturday, and Blink-182 brought their ‘90s humor and hits to the main stage on Sunday.\n\nLollapalooza founder Perry Farrell was onhand in a rare sighting to partake in the weekend’s festivities, which in addition to various stages featured Toyota Music Den’s retro summer camp vibes, Coke Studio’s roller rink, House of Dunkin’s newly renovated setup and Kidzapalooza for the festival’s youngest attendees.\n\nThough thunderstorms threatened throughout the weekend, it only materialized as light rain and was a welcome reprieve from the balmy temperatures. As Lollapalooza attendees recuperate from one of the summer's biggest parties, relive seven of the most exhilarating sets from Lollapalooza 2024.\n\nKesha Boldly Embraces Theatrics & Politics\n\nKesha has never been someone to shy away from controversy, and the GRAMMY-nominated singer made some interesting choices during her Lolla set on Thursday. The singer delivered some of her biggest hits — from \"Cannibal\" and \"Die Young,\" to \"Take It Off,\" and \"Your Love Is My Drug\" — in front of her most loyal fans at Lolla. While performing \"Backstabber\" from 2010's Animal, Kesha and her scantily-clad male dancers doused themselves in fake blood while the star herself brandished a knife as a prop. Kesha later revealed on X that the knife shockingly turned out to be real.\n\nIn addition to her theatrical dramatics, Kesha also played a clip of Vice President Kamala Harris saying \"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\" as she began \"Blow\" (Kesha brought out a marching band for the song as well). \"Women do run this country,\" Kesha told the crowd, proudly standing in her power.\n\nWhen she wasn’t waving pride flags and encouraging onlookers to \"support local drag, Kesha paused to thank her fans for \"standing by me through the hardest time of my entire life.\"\n\nRead more: Kesha Reveals The 10 Most Important Songs Of Her Career, From \"Tik Tok\" To \"Eat The Acid\"\n\nMegan Thee Stallion Got The Hotties In Formation\n\nThree-time GRAMMY winner Megan Thee Stallion was tapped by the festival as one of the headliner’s after Tyler, The Creator pulled out of his slot earlier this year. The rapper, however, proved she was no \"second best.\"\n\nFresh off of her performance at Vice President Kamala Harris’ Atlanta campaign rally, Megan Thee Stallion feverishly got her fans in formation with a spectacular performance. Donning a sexy, sequined pink ensemble, the Houston rapper plowed through a bevy of hits including: \"Freak Nasty,\" \"Cobra,\" \"Big Ole Freak,\" \"Mamushi\" and \"WAP.\"\n\nShe also addressed haters who were upset about her supporting Harris last month. \"They was fake mad that I was popping it for Kamala. I don’t think they heard what she said,\" Meg explained. \"Kamala said she wants a ceasefire. Kamala said she supports women’s rights. Kamala said y’all tired of high gas prices. Kamala said ‘I’m for the people.’\" She shouted out \"Hotties for Harris\" before being surprised by Chicago Sky star Angel Reese onstage who took a selfie with the \"Savage\" artist.\n\nRead more: 6 Takeaways From Megan Thee Stallion's 'Megan': Snakes, Shots & Self-Assurance\n\nDeftones Appeased Every Metalhead In Attendance\n\nDeftones — the GRAMMY-winning rock facet from Sacramento, California — have For spent three decades perfecting their gnarly guitar riffs, airy vocals and thunderous percussion. Their most recent project, 2020's Ohms, served as a sauntering exploration of frontman Chino Moreno’s inner workings. This energy was on full display at Lollapalooza 2024.\n\nThe band’s electrifying energy was gleefully absorbed by the crowd, who moshed through heavier tracks such as \"Lotion\" and \"My Own Summer (Shove It).\" The audience was slightly more still but visibly bubbling over for slower, more sensual tunes like \"Digital Bath\" and \"Change (In The House of Flies).\"\n\nMoreno — who said onstage he chipped his tooth during \"Needles and Pins,\" from the band's self-titled 2003 LP — proved his performer prowess again and again. Even beyond the T-Mobile, Lolla attendees could feel the infectiousness of Deftones’ stellar set.\n\nLearn more: 5 Essential Nu-Metal Albums: How Slipknot, Korn, Deftones & Others Showcased Adolescent Rage With A Dramatic Flair\n\nFuture x Metro Boomin Injected More Energy Into An Already Lively Crowd\n\nDespite being 45 minutes late to their headlining set on Saturday, Future and Metro Boomin delivered a vigorous performance that celebrated their collaborative albums We Don’t Trust You (released in March) and We Still Don’t Trust You (which dropped a month later).\n\nThe pair ferociously fed off of each other’s energy, while simultaneously injecting that same enthusiasm into the crowd. From \"Luv Bad Bitches\" to \"Type S—,\" \"F— Up Some Commas\" to \"Low Life,\" there were no shortage of hits to feed the insatiable musical appetite of the packed crowd at the Bud Light stage.\n\nFans eagerly threw up two fingers in honor of Future's Dirty Sprite 2, per instructions from the duo, and Future x Metro Boomin Young Thug when \"Relationship\" played. \"Like That\" lost its potency when it was started for a second time as an attempt to reinvigorate the audience — but remained a thrilling track from beginning to end. The chemistry between Future x Metro Boomin was off the charts and seamlessly translated onstage.\n\nRead more: Metro Boomin's Essential Songs: 10 Must-Know Tracks, From \"Creepin\" To \"Like That\"\n\nSiR Savors \"Summer\" With Sensual R&B Set\n\nThe Inglewood, California-based R&B singer used his time at Lollapalooza to reconnect with a city he hasn't performed in for nearly five years. On Sunday, the R&B crooner glided through his discography, performing \"Karma\" (from his March 2024 album Heavy) to \"John Redcorn\" — a track from his 2020 release Chasing Summer.\n\nSiR, who was dripping in sweat from the intense Chicago heat, slowed things down a bit to celebrate his collaborators. First, he gleefully welcomed singer Zacari for \"Mood\" followed by his brother Davion Farris for \"The Recipe.\" SiR’s bravado shined brightly on \"Hair Down\" where he felt his most confident, his most rambunctious, his most seen. He appeased fans’ requests for \"D’Evils\" and got emotional when reflecting on his struggles.\n\nSiR has been candid about his journey to sobriety — a major theme on Heavy — and thanked his fans for their support throughout his set. When SiR performed \"Life Is Good,\" he reminded attendees that nothing is sweeter than a well-earned victory lap.\n\nRead more: On 'Heavy,' SiR Wants People To See The Weight Of His Humanity\n\nCarmen DeLeon Basked In Being A Total Ray Of Sunshine\n\nThe 23-year-old Venezuelan singer smiled from ear to ear as she enthusiastically gave her all during a short but powerful performance on Sunday at the BMI stage. She kicked off things with two of her most notable tracks: 2022’s \"Mala Memoria\" and \"Mariposas\" (which was released the year prior). DeLeon was effervescent during \"Wonderful,\" with its catchy chorus being as bright and brilliant as she was.\n\nDeLeon became visibly emotional while paying homage to Lady Gaga and her BMI stage legacy by covering \"Always Remember Us This Way\" from the A Star is Born soundtrack. She attached her native flag to the mic stand and emphasized the importance of speaking up against injustice, which hit especially close to home for her given the unrest following recent elections in Venezuela.\n\nDeLeon quickly switched gears and tackled the complex nature of love with \"El Vecino.\" Though the singer is longing to be noticed on the track, its live rendition feels more empowering than dejected. One of the show’s most heartwarming moments came when the singer brought her clearly proud dad onstage.\n\nBenson Boone Backflipped His Way Into The Hearts Of Fans\n\nMoments after viral TikTok sensation Benson Boone took the stage at Lolla, he shared that this was the first U.S. music festival he has ever performed at. The former \"American Idol\" contestant used his performance on the IHG Resorts & Resorts stage to sing — and backflip — his way into the hearts of fans.\n\nBoone's performance ranged in both sound and emotion. The singer basked in the sweetness of \"Coffee Cake\" from his 2023 album PULSE, then dug deeper with a formidable performance of \"What Was.\" Before going into \"My Greatest Fear,\" the singer shared that he is terrified of being alone and was devastated by the passing of his grandmother.\n\nHe used \"Friend\" as a springboard to talk about the importance of camaraderie and, before launching into \"Beautiful Things,\" shared amazement at how one song dramatically changed his life.\n\nRead more: Benson Boone Declares \"Beautiful Things\" Is No Fluke: \"I've Tapped Into How I'll Write For The Rest Of My Life\"\n\nLatest Music Festival News\n\nWhen it comes to American dance music culture, few events carry the cool cache of a HARD party. Founded on New Year's Eve of 2008 by DJ and former label A&R Gary Richards, the name HARD has become synonymous with taste-making, offering fans an enviable mix of influential headliners and cutting-edge up-and-comers.\n\nHARD parties have been a breakout platform for luminaries like Justice, Skrillex, deadmau5, and more, and the HARD Summer festival is one of the brand's most celebrated flagship events. In 2017, HARD was absorbed into the Insomniac festival family — the same company that brings fan-favorites EDC Las Vegas and Electric Forest to life — which ensures the stage production, on-site activities and other ancillary fun are sure to be supersized. How many festivals do you know that offer a Ferris wheel and a swimming pool?\n\nComing to Los Angeles' Hollywood Park near SoFi Stadium on Aug. 3 and 4, this year's lineup continues the tradition of blending authoritative artists, legacy DJs and unique back-to-back headliners with buzzy newcomers in a variety of genres and styles.\n\nWhether you wanna rave out with club king Jamie xx, bang your head to bass with Zeds Dead, get tropical with Major Lazer, see what it sounds like for UK grime star Skepta to DJ, or just sing along to mid-2000s belters courtesy of dance-pop crossover queen Nelly Furtado, there's something to please every palette. Of course, in true HARD tradition, we seriously recommend exploring the undercard, because the biggest name in electronic music tomorrow is probably playing one of the HARD side stages today.\n\nWhile you wrap your head around the stacked lineup, check out a quick guide to 10 must-see acts below.\n\nBoys Noize\n\nA legend on the decks who can play blissful disco or teeth-shattering techno with a smile, Boys Noize is a must-see on any lineup simply because he loves doing the job. He recently teamed with Skrillex on the anthem \"Fine Day,\" and released an entire EP with alt-rap icon Rico Nasty. He's also the producer behind Lady Gaga's beloved Ariana Grande collab, \"Rain On Me,\" and Playboi Carti's \"Unlock It,\" but he's likely to unleash a massive set of hard techno bangers for the L.A. crowd — though you never can tell which direction he'll take you in next, so come with an open mind.\n\nDisclosure\n\nAs the top-billed headliner for Saturday night, Disclosure should need little to no introduction to any modern dance music fan — but that doesn't mean you should sleep on their set.\n\nHoward and Guy Lawrence emerged on the scene as seemingly an instant success. The brothers' debut album, Settle, almost single-handedly changed the landscape of popular dance in 2012, moving the taste du jour away from the big-room EDM and bass-heavy trap sound toward a UK garage revival that still carries, and helped launch Sam Smith's career in the process.\n\nIn the 12 years that followed, Disclosure has continued to push the envelope — and themselves — working with cross-genre heavyweights including Lorde, Khalid, Miguel, Kelis, Slowthai, and The Weeknd, as well as incorporating international sounds and styles into their club-driven house grooves. Earlier this year, Disclosure returned with the dance floor-ready single \"She's Gone, Dance On,\" announcing themselves as arbiters of disco-laced funk and good-time DJs for 2024 crowds. Surely they'll be in top form come HARD Summer.\n\nINVT\n\nIf you like your dark techno to come with a side of hip-shaking Latin rhythms, Miami-bred duo INVT is the experimental sound machine you can't possibly pass up. Luca Medici and Delbert Perez have been best friends since they were kids, and that closeness comes through in their tight experimental sets, blending booming bass with glitched-out techno synths, cumbia rhythms, dembow beats, and acidic edge.\n\nINVT are — as the name may imply — extremely innovative, leaning into their own productions and edits to curate an approach that feels hypnotic, exciting and unique. If you're not afraid of beats that go really hard and get a little weird, this is a set that can set your wild mind ablaze.\n\nRezzmau5\n\nWhat happens when you put two of the most unique and hard-hitting producers in electronic music together on one stage? Deadmau5 is one of the scene's leading icons, and Rezz (who released her debut album of deadmau5's Mau5trap label in 2017) shifted bass music culture with her gritty, techno-fueled, half-time sound. The two share a love of dark, stomping, left-field noise, and after years of teasing possible collaborations, those shared interests merged on the 2021 collaboration \"Hypnocurrency.\" Two years later, they released the booming, dystopian 2023 single \"Infraliminal\" — not just a brilliant rework of deadmau5's 2012 track \"Superliminal,\" but the official introduction to Rezzmau5.\n\nRezzmau5 haven't released anything since, and live performances from the duo have remained few and far between. But the monolithic duo just warmed up their trippy joint live show at Tomorrowland 2024, which was set in \"the mythical realm of Silvyra,\" a world \"filled with creatures, plant life, and people living in harmony.\" Whether or not their HARD set follows the same storyline, it's certain to shake the skulls of every dancer at Hollywood Park. Prepare your body for something deep, dark and maniacal.\n\nElderbrook\n\nThere aren't many electronic acts that bring the same level of frontman energy that Elderbrook boasts on stage. A multi-talented performer, the UK artist sings and plays instruments, creating a rock-show experience unlike most sets at heavily electronic festivals like HARD. He leads the crowd in heartfelt sing-alongs to hits including \"Numb,\" \"Something About You,\" \"Inner Light\" and, of course, his megahit CamelPhat collab \"Cola.\"\n\nBouncing between his microphone, synthesizers and keyboards, samplers and drum pads, his one-man band performance is sure to draw a serious crowd. If you're ready for a break from the hard-edged rave noise and want to ascend to heavenly heights, Elderbrook is the man for the job.\n\nFisher + Chris Lake (Under Construction)\n\nNothing is more fun than watching two best mates go absolutely nuts on the decks. And when two stellar DJs go back-to-back, everyone wins, because they spend the whole set trying to impress each other.\n\nChris Lake is one of the most influential producers in tech house. Fisher is one of the most unhinged and energizing DJs one can ever witness. Together, the besties deliver an over-the-top party with an arsenal of mind-numbing drops, weirdo grooves and just-plain fun vibes that make you wanna hug your friends and dance 'til you sweat. The set is called Under Construction, but make no mistake: these two have completely mastered the blueprint.\n\nJYOTY\n\nIf you like your sets to be playful cross-genre explorations of sounds from around the world — tied together by booty-shaking beats and booming bass lines — JYOTY is sure to check all your boxes. She knows how to lead a great party because she spent her childhood frequenting the unmatched clubs of Amsterdam. And with an ethos built around playing whatever the heck she wants, she's comfortable dropping a bit of hip-hop into some Brazilian bops, mixing it up with hard breakbeats, blistering rave synths and more.\n\nKerri Chandler\n\nIf you don't know your history, you're doomed to repeat it, but no one brings the house down quite like Kerri Chandler. A pioneer of the original deep and garage house movements, Chandler was a foundational DJ of the '80s scene, holding down a residency at the legendary Club Zanzibar in New Jersey and founding the MadHouse Records label. If you want to feel the soulful spirit that made electronic music what it is, Chandler's dreamy mix of feel-good melodies served over kickin' club beats are a direct line to house music's roots.\n\nMary Droppinz\n\nYou know how Mary Poppins had a magical bag that held everything from a hat rack to an ornate mirror, a house plant and a Tiffany lamp? Well, California DJ Mary Droppinz comes equipped with a magical USB that's positively bursting with mean beats and original edts.\n\nThis woman can blend everything from grimy bouncing bass to ethereal orchestral house, Spice Girls reworks, drum'n'bass bangers, reggae upbeats, '90s R&B remixes and chart-topping hits of the moment twisted into face-melting heaters. You can try to guess where she'll go next, but it's better to just let her take control and follow the vibe through all the devious twists and turns. The one thing you can count on? You'll leave her set dripping with sweat.\n\nOvermono\n\nDisclosure aren't the only brilliant UK brothers on the HARD Summer lineup. Overmono's Tom and Ed Russell hail from Wales and make some of the most inspired club records of our time.\n\nWith backgrounds exploring hard techno, drum'n'bass and rave, the brothers combined their talents in 2015 and have since created an enviable blend of soulful atmospheres and frenetic breakbeats that feels nostalgic and sentimental, but still very heavy. Overmono's 2023 album Good Lies is a great play from start to finish, and a good way to get prepped for their critically acclaimed live set. If you need a big-name co-sign, Overmono was recently featured on Fred again..'s \"Stayinit\" with Lil Yachty on the vocal. That's the caliber they're rockin' with — and the prestige they'll bring to HARD Summer.\n\nLatest Music Festival News\n\nThis year's Lollapalooza is set to electrify Chicago's Grant Park from August 1-4, showcasing stellar performances from music's top talent. Headliners include Megan Thee Stallion (replacing Tyler, The Creator for the first night), The Killers, Blink-182, SZA, and Future x Metro Boomin.\n\nFounded by Jane's Addiction lead singer Perry Farrell, Lollapalooza has evolved from a modest alternative musical gathering in 1991 to a cultural phenomenon with international editions in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Sweden, India, and France.\n\nRead more: 'Lolla: The Story of Lollapalooza' Recounts How An Alt Rock Fest Laid The Blueprint For Bonnaroo & More\n\nBeyond the headliners, Lollapalooza's eight stages will feature an array of other incredible artists over the four-day festival. Here are 10 must-see acts you shouldn't miss:\n\nFLO\n\nThurs., Aug. 1 at 7:45 p.m. (Bacardi Stage)\n\nThe London trio, FLO, is revitalizing R&B with slick, catchy songs saturated with '90s nostalgia. Consisting of Renée Downwer, Stella Quaresma, and Jorja Douglas, FLO debuted in 2022 with the hit song \"Cardboard Box.\" Since then, they’ve garnered praise from the likes of SZA, Missy Elliot, and Victoria Monét. FLO has seemingly achieved the impossible — reviving the girl group concept.\n\n\"We definitely want to be the face of the resurgence of girl groups,\" Douglas told Variety in April. \"It's all healthy competition, we want there to be girl groups that can exist in the same space. For now, at least.\" Last year, the group won the Brits' Rising Star Award and the BBC's Sound of 2023. FLO took Coachella by storm in April, and their Lollapalooza performance promises to be no different.\n\nd4vd\n\nThurs., Aug. 1 at 3:45 p.m. (Tito's Homemade Vodka Stage)\n\nThis prodigious talent is becoming known for genre experimentation as well as expressive lyrics. The innate melancholy on d4vd's single \"Romantic Homicide\" resonated with the masses in a major way when it was released in July 2022 and has garnered over 1 billion streams across various platforms. Since then, the artist has become known for crafting vulnerable love ballads with a tinge of potency as heard on tracks like \"Here With Me\" and \"There Goes My Baby.\"\n\nOn the songwriting process for \"There Goes My Baby,\" d4vd stated: \"This is a song I wrote about letting go of someone you love and letting them become their own person. Watching them become that person and realizing that you may have been the problem, but also being happy for the person they've become.\" After completing his fully sold-out \"My House Is Not A Home\" international headline tour, d4vd's presence at Lollapalooza is a welcome one.\n\nTyla\n\nThurs., Aug. 1 at 3 p.m. (T-Mobile Stage)\n\nThe GRAMMY-winning South African singer has had an epic year following the immense popularity of her amapiano-infused hit \"Water.\" Tyla's self-titled debut album, released in April, became the highest-charting album on the US Billboard 200 Albums Chart by a female African soloist in history. Over the years, the star — who is of Indian, Zulu, Mauritian, and Irish descent — amassed an impressive following on TikTok with her dance routines and song covers going viral.\n\nTracks like \"Jump\" (featuring Gunna and Skillibeng) and \"On My Body\" (featuring Becky G) showcase Tyla's versatility and her ability to bring her distinct sonic style to life. Tyla's catalog also shows that music found in the African diaspora also contains elements of pop. Her infectious energy will light up not just Lollapalooza, but festival stages all summer long.\n\nKevin Abstract\n\nFri., Aug. 2 at 7:45 p.m. (IHG Hotels and Resorts Stage)\n\nThe wildly imaginative and talented emcee — who also served as the frontman of the hip-hop group Brockhampton — reminded audiences of his solo capabilities with last year's \"Blanket.\" While that project saw Kevin Abstract experiment with darker and heavier rock sounds (\"When the Rope Post 2 Break,\" \"Blanket\"), his first love was and will always be hip-hop, as evidenced on his 2014 debut album MTV1987.\n\nIn addition, Abstract has been passing his time recently with some stellar collaborations. After teasing his song featuring Lil Nas X, \"Tennessee,\" at Coachella earlier this year, Abstract officially released the track in May (the pair attended the same high school in Georgia before they knew each other.) He was also featured alongside Lev on Toro y Moi's latest single \"Heaven.\" Abstract's sonic malleability has always been his greatest and most exciting strength.\n\nStray Kids\n\nFri., Aug. 2 at 8:30 p.m. (Bud Light Stage)\n\nThis K-pop band — often abbreviated as SKZ — formed on a reality show back in 2017. Stray Kids have had a slew of hits, including 2019's \"MIROH\" and 2020's \"God's Menu,\" which showcased the group's pop proclivity and unrelenting fan base. Their fourth studio album, 5-Star, was released last year and was a huge commercial success, reaching number one in the U.S., South Korea, France, Austria, Greece, and Portugal. Their latest album, ATE, released on July 19, marks the next chapter of the band's evolution. Member Bang Chan stated that on ATE, \"a lot of the songs [are] all very different…what we recorded, it's just showing a different side of Stray Kids.\"\n\nRead more: K-Pop Sensation Stray Kids On Their New LP, 'Go Live': \"We Wanted To Show Everyone What Our True Colors Were\"\n\nSiR\n\nSun., Aug. 4 at 5:45 p.m. (IHG Hotels and Resorts Stage)\n\nSiR released his fourth studio album, Heavy, earlier this year, cementing the Inglewood, California R&B crooner as a bona fide star. The GRAMMY-nominated singer is a proud Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) stalwart, with 2019's Chasing Summer being acclaimed for its musicality, joviality, and warmth. On Heavy, SiR — who has been open about his past struggles with addiction — bravely puts his demons on wax as he tells the story of how he became a better man.\n\nFeaturing appearances from Anderson .Paak, Ab-Soul, Ty Dolla $ign and Isaiah Rashad, the project is a beautiful testament to the \"John Redcorn\" singer his devotion to the depth of his artistry. \"With this album, I feel like I was under so much pressure as I was writing the songs — all I could do was make diamonds,\" he told GRAMMY.com earlier this year. SiR’s Lollapalooza performance is a stop mid-way through his “Heavy” tour, which runs through late August.\n\nRead more: On 'Heavy,' SiR Wants People To See The Weight Of His Humanity\n\nSlow Pulp\n\nSun., Aug. 4 at 2:45 p.m. (T-Mobile Stage)\n\nSlow Pulp — consisting of Emily Massey, Henry Stoehr, Teddy Matthews, and Alex Leeds — specialize in the kind of syrupy and saccharine melodies that launched them straight into the indie-rock stratosphere. Their sophomore project, Yard, was released last year and blissfully combines elements of shoegaze with Massey's somber lyricism. The frontwoman often lets themes of reflection bleed into her work.\n\nOn \"Doubt,\" the second single from Yard, Massey confessed that insecurity is at the core of the track. \"I wanted people close to me to validate the things I hated about myself,\" Massey wrote in a statement for Consquence’s “Track by Track” series. \"Self-doubt had found a home in me, it felt safer to stay in this familiar negative space than to like myself. I thought if others shared that with me I wouldn't have to do the work to change.\" Slow Pulp's weepy yet addictive catalog is sure to stand out over the weekend.\n\nDominic Fike\n\nSun., Aug. 4 at 6:45 p.m. (T-Mobile Stage)\n\nDominic Fike released his debut EP in 2018, Don't Forget About Me, Demos, featuring viral hits with Halsey and Brockhampton. Fike's debut album, What Could Possibly Go Wrong, followed two years later. On tracks like \"Good Game\" and \"Politics & Violence,\" Fike takes a somber look at his reality while perfecting his hip-hop influenced brand of pop.\n\nIn 2022, he was cast on Season 2 of the HBO hit series \"Euphoria\" where he played Elliot, a drug user who finds himself in the middle of a love triangle between Rue (Zendaya) and Jules (Hunter Schafer). Last year, his sophomore LP, Sunburn, explored addiction, heartache, and remorse. Fresh off his biggest headlining tour, Fike dropped the visual project \"14 Minutes\" in May, proving that the phrase \"tortured artist\" can very much be a real thing.\n\nHuddy\n\nSun., Aug. 4 at 2:10 p.m. (BMI Stage)\n\nThis viral TikTok sensation has managed to stand out from his pop-punk peers with a pulsating, upbeat sound that transports listeners back to the early aughts. Huddy's 2022 hit song, \"All the Things I Hate About You,\" dominated social media, reaching #1 on TikTok and YouTube. It also became his first entry on the Pop and Alternative radio charts.\n\nThe California native's 4-track EP, Love Bites, was released on May 15 (his 22nd birthday) and embodies his feelings on romance. \"The title 'Love Bites' is a double entendre: it not only alludes to a hickey, but it also means that love can bite you in the ass if you let it,\" Huddy explained to Ones To Watch. \"With each track, I dig deeper into my emotions, unafraid to embrace the raw and the vulgar, because that's what love is — messy, unfiltered, real.\"\n\nThe Last Dinner Party\n\nSun., Aug. 4 at 5:15 p.m. (Bacardi Stage)\n\nThis British rock quintet became quite the sensation after the viral success of their explosive track \"Nothing Matters,\" released in 2023 (garnering over 26 million streams on Spotify).\n\nThe Last Dinner Party — consisting of Abigail Morris, Aurora Nishevci, Emily Roberts, Georgia Davies, and Lizzie Maylan — released their debut album earlier this year titled Prelude to Ecstasy, which contains the same infectious fervor heard on their breakthrough hit. The influence of '90's alt-rock can be heard on another one of their singles, \"Sinner.\" Additionally, \"My Lady of Mercy\" contains a wispy, ethereal ambience that could very well become their signature sound. The refreshing nature of The Last Dinner Party is as empowering as it is fun — their theatrical reverie is sure to translate to the stage.\n\nLatest Music Festival News\n\nHeld from July 26-29 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and Crypto.com Arena, KCON 2024 showcased an array of performances from K-pop stars, with notable acts including NCT 127, ENHYPEN, Taemin, ZEROBASEONE, and g.o.d. The event marked its largest success yet, attracting fans worldwide both in-person and through digital platforms.\n\nKCON, the biggest K-pop show in the world, has come a long way since its inception in 2012 at Irvine's Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre with around 10,000 attendees. Over a decade later, the music festival and convention event has expanded globally, but Los Angeles remains special as its origin. This year, KCON proclaimed its biggest success yet, stating, \"Over 5.9 million fans from more than 170 countries enjoyed KCON L.A. 2024 both at the festival site and through digital platforms.\" It was also broadcasted for the first time on the CW network in the U.S., and by its usual broadcaster Mnet in Korea and around the world.\n\nThis year's KCON featured a varied lineup for performers. The finale headliners were NCT 127, who last attended KCON L.A. in 2017 in their early days. They were joined by ENHYPEN and Taemin as nightly headliners. Rookie groups like ZEROBASEONE and Boynextdoor proved to be crowd favorites, while Y2K icons like g.o.d surprised the whole audience with 2000s hits. Despite fewer female performers, dynamic sets from NMIXX, Somi, and StayC made a significant impact.\n\nIt was generally a big year for rookie acts, with a variety of Korean, Japanese, and Filipino newer boy bands and girl groups making appearances throughout the weekend. As more senior artists hold solo tours, with many touring simultaneously to KCON, there was ample time to meet newcomers.\n\nEven L.A.-based Katseye, Hybe X Geffen Records' new girl group that features members from around the world, had a moment as the openers for the final night, performing live in front of fans for the very first time.\n\nRead on for memorable highlights, performances, and other insights from the annual event.\n\ng.o.d Ascend To New Heights\n\nAlthough the styles of the '90s and early aughts are trending, it was perhaps a bit of a surprise — to the crowd and artists alike — that one of Korea's early boy band greats could get the whole stadium up out of their seats, clapping, and swaying along to the R&B stylings of g.o.d.\n\nFormed in 1999, the quartet took the stage in suits and began their set with the ballad \"Road\" followed by \"Lie.\" While many fans came out specifically to see them, bearing banners and light blue balloon-shaped light sticks in support, it was the group's comfortable affability that made them one of KCON's most talked-about acts.\n\nBy having fun and being earnestly engaging, they won over a crowd largely made up of people unfamiliar with their discography. When they performed \"Sky Blue Balloon,\" a song dedicated to their fans, everyone clapped and sang along. As they turned on their phone flashlights (\"Give us 1% of your phone battery!\" quipped Cali-native Joon Park), the audience basked in the poignant closer \"One Candle,\" a song well-known in South Korea as a democratic anthem, creating a warm, memorable glow.\n\nZEROBASEONE Lead Rookie Power\n\nWhen they performed at the 2023 event, ZEROBASEONE, or ZB1, were charming newcomers who had just come together during K-pop competition show, \"Boys Planet.\" While ZB1 are not technically rookies anymore, they're still relatively new kids on the block compared to many senior acts. Despite their relative youth, at KCON LA 2024, they were one of the biggest draws for fans in attendance. Throughout the weekend, it was near impossible to move a foot or two without spotting one or two (or 10!) dedicated \"Zeroses\" cheering them on with a light stick that looks surprisingly similar to a rose-shaped engagement ring.\n\nFor fans lucky enough to attend multiple nights of KCON LA 2024, ZB1 performed both on Friday, July 26, and Sunday, July 28, showcasing fan favorites like \"Sweat,\" \"Crush,\" and \"In Bloom.\" They also shared a teaser for their new EP, Cinema Paradise, which will drop in August.\n\nAlong with ZB1, it was a big weekend for some other newer boy bands: Boynextdoor’s catchy, witty performances were some of the most-talked about, while TWS’s earworm hits had the whole arena singing along.\n\nENHYPEN Fulfill Dreams And Enhance Fantasies\n\nComing to KCON right after touring in the U.S. earlier this year could have meant repeat performances for ENHYPEN's \"Engenes\" to witness, but instead, the vampiric septet charmed with new energy just days after releasing their latest EP, Romance: Untold, on July 12.\n\nSurprising the crowd with the English version of that album's single \"XO (Only If You Say Yes)\", ENHYPEN ran through some of their biggest hits, seducing listeners with \"Bite Me\" and charming them with the picture-perfect \"Polaroid Love.\"\n\nThey also, along with Zico and Taemin, hosted one of KCON's unique \"Dream Stages,\" coming together with fan dancers to perform the English version of last year's smooth \"Sweet Venom.\"\n\nRead more: Meet ENHYPEN, K-Pop's Latest Breakout Boy Group\n\nA Welcome Return For NCT 127\n\nSeven years since their last KCON LA performance, NCT 127 appeared triumphant as both openers and closers on the third night of the show. They kicked the night off (literally) with their 2020 hit \"Kick It,\" and returned at the end of the night to perform their new song \"Walk,\" before renditions of hits \"Lemonade,\" \"2 Baddies,\" and \"Fact Check.\"\n\nIt was a moment of glory for the team, who had spent much of their biggest musical eras without touring during the pandemic. Now that concerts are back, they've been touring heavily. When their planned world tour, \"Neo City – The Unity,\" became an Asia-only tour, it felt like there would be no moment for Stateside fans in 2024. When they were announced as late-addition special headliners, NCTzens rapidly bought up tickets.\n\nWith the 127 members and their U.S. fans (plus many from overseas) reunited, the atmosphere was one of euphoria and exuberance as the members boisterously dominated the stage, making jokes and playfully engaging in a way that felt comfortable and assured in their performing prowess. It may not have been a full NCT 127 concert in LA, but it's clear that the stars and many fans are waiting for that.\n\nJeon Somi, Hyolyn & BIBI Shine\n\nWhile groups are the bread and butter of K-pop, soloists have their own flair, and this year the fiery spotlight fell on the women. During the final night, the powerful dynamism of BIBI, Jeon Somi, and Hyolyn took over. Although BIBI's real set was the first night, she performed a expletive-free version of her hit revenge track \"Bibi's Vengeance\" before embracing Hyolyn.\n\nHyolyn, a soloist and member of girl group Sistar, forwent her own songs for the concert event and instead put her own sultry spin on LOONA's \"So What\" with a team of fierce dancers.\n\nJeon Somi rounded out things with her truly addicting dance tracks \"Fast Forward\" and \"DUMB DUMB,\" along with the emotive \"The Way.\" She then revealed the name of her new upcoming song, \"Ice Cream\" and charmed the crowd by teaching them a call-and-response chant: \"Come get your ice cream,\" shouted one side of the arena. \"Too hot!\" returned the other before Somi realized with a laugh that the lyric actually was \"Too cold!\"\n\nRead more: 10 K-Pop Rookie Girl Groups To Watch In 2023\n\nFiery Covers Galore\n\nOne of the special things about KCON is the emphasis put on historic K-pop songs and events, with remakes and covers being a major part of every KCON. This year was no different, beginning with the first day's concert featuring P1Harmony's cover of BTS's \"Fire.\"\n\nIn 2016, when BTS performed \"Fire\" at KCON LA, the air was palpable with the feeling that something big was taking place. That set has often been cited as the moment many K-pop fans and music watchers realized BTS was on the brink of global superstardom. It was a fitting tribute to have P1Harmony, who had a major year on the festival and touring circuit, open up KCON LA with their own spin on the song the very first night of the event.\n\nOther acts also put their own spin on both recent hits and older classics throughout the nighttime concerts. The third night featured an homage to girl groups: along with Hyolyn covering LOONA, ZB1 covered Red Velvet's \"Psycho\" and STAYC covered (G)I-DLE's \"Queencard.\"\n\nThe Unsung Hero: The KCON Stage\n\nA rather unsuspecting, warehouse-style room next to the main convention floor was the secret sauce that brought a special touch to revitalize the decade-plus event by making it a true day-long music festival.\n\nWhile KCON LA had previously tried smaller nighttime concerts, concerts occasionally on the convention floor, and long-time had a meet-and-greet stage, this year's daytime KCON Stage that almost all artists visited was the sort of concert fans dream of.\n\nWhile the headlining M Countdown concerts were certainly the highlights of KCON LA 2024, the KCON Stage provided an intimate moment for artists and fans to get up-close and personal. Kicking off each morning with auditions for the Dream Stage performances with Taemin, ENHYPEN, and Zico for their respective night's events, the KCON Stage featured concert sets from a variety of artists throughout the day. Each day's KCON Stage performances were a bit more relaxed and raw compared to the highly choreographed made-for-TV nighttime shows.\n\nNMIXX, whose \"Run for Roses\" and \"Dice\" got the second night's crowd basking in their glory, was one such moment. The KCON Stage gave them a chance to bring some summertime fun with a bubble-blowing rendition of \"Love Me Like This.\"\n\nEven acts who are popular K-pop crowd pleasers but not part of the lineup for KCON's main concerts, like A.C.E and AleXa, had sets during the day. They, along with other acts like POW, Bibi, and Craxy, had KCON convention-goers perking up their ears at these unexpected concert moments.\n\nMore K-Pop News"
