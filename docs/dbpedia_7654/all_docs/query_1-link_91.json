        "text": "What is the RuPaul effect?\n\nWith the finale of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK looming, the mainstreaming of drag into popular culture is more prominent than ever. Despite RuPaul Charles’ affirmation in 2016 for an interview with Vulture that drag ‘will never be mainstream, it’s the antithesis of mainstream’, Sissy that Walk and Kitty Girlwere still the first two songs requested by my 60-something colleagues at the staff party this summer. The so called ‘RuPaul effect’ has seen drag as an art form gain popularity but also affect our lives in ways we don’t even realise, and the few examples here are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nLanguage\n\nAs a language student, this was one of the ways in which I really started to notice that drag was impacting the mainstream: drag terminology is no longer just used by drag fans. All around us ‘fierce’ no longer refers just to lions or tigers but to anything brilliant, looking ‘sickening’ has gone from being an insult to a compliment and ‘tea’ is no longer just a hot beverage, but rather juicy gossip. What these terms all have in common is that they originated in drag culture. ‘Tea’ for example is universally regarded as one of the most popular Millennial slang word on social media, abundant in GIFs and memes, however it originates in black drag culture and was used as early as the 1990s in iconic publications such as John Berent’s 1994 bestseller Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and William G. Hawkeswood’s One of the Children: An Ethnography of Identity and Gay Black Men, published in 1991.\n\nIn Jennie Livingston’s 1990 documentary film Paris is Burning, we are reminded by drag queen Dorian Corey of the difference between ‘reading’ (the real art form of insults) and ‘shade’ (Shade is, I don’t tell you you’re ugly, but I don’t have to tell you you’re ugly because you know you’re ugly, and that’s shade.) Back then these terms were used exclusively in the drag community but now ‘shady’ is a widely used term in mainstream language and media, and even appears in the Ultimate Kardashians Dictionary as a term that they’ve ‘basically invented’.\n\nAnother popular term explained in Paris is Burning is the iconic ‘yaaas’, although this dates all the way back to ball culture in the 1920s which was revived in the 1980s where men wore garments typically associated as female, and vice versa. During the drag performances at these balls ‘yaaas’ was used as a term of encouragement, true to its meaning now. Another similar term of encouragement ‘werk’ also found its roots in black drag culture, as well as ‘kiki’ the onomatopoeic term for giggling which came from Black and Latino gay communities. These words are seamlessly integrated into the lexicon of 21stCentury, as well as ‘beating your face’ or ‘gagging’. We use them every day, unaware of their origins or what they represent.\n\nMakeup and Fashion\n\nThis Halloween thousands of people around the word dressed up as their favourite drag queen, to the extent that some drag queens released makeup tutorials to ‘get the look’. You may think that’s where the similarities end but in actual fact the influence drag queens have had on fashion and makeup goes far beyond just dressing up. For a start we have contouring. Again, something which many attribute to the Kardashians, and certainly one of the hottest makeup trends of the decade: using dark makeup as shadows to help sculpt your face and hide that extra chin. But contouring is a trick drag queens have been using to change the structure of their faces to appear more feminine for generations.\n\nCut creases are another firm drag favourite which have come back into fashion recently, mainly thanks to the rise of beauty bloggers and vloggers. Although Bianca del Rio and other Drag Racequeens are famous for this look nowadays, it has been a staple in drag makeup for decades, and has taken social media by storm since the rise of Instagram. True to its origins, this has been made especially famous by male makeup artists such as Jeffree Star, James Charles and Patrick Starr.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious makeup trend we have taken from drag queens is baking; for us this is a recent phenomenon over the last few years but drag queens have been baking their makeup with a thick layer of powder to set the base for years. For drag queens this is essential for keeping their makeup on, and feminine appearance intact during long and energetic performances, for us a trend popularised on the red carpet and social media.\n\nIn terms of clothing it seems that RuPaul was absolutely right when he said ‘you’re born naked and the rest is drag’. Fashion has been hugely influenced by the drag world and this stems from the ball culture I mentioned earlier. Members of the LGBTQ+ community would showcase designer clothes, reading up about them in Vogue, hence the term ‘voguing’. This influence continues today, from seeing our favourite queens in designer campaigns such as Milk and his boyfriend featuring in Marc Jacobs 2016 campaign or the successful 2013 Marco Marco collection being debuted by 16 drag queens at Style Fashion Week LA including Alyssa Edwards, Courtney Act, Detox and Willam to name a few. Sasha Velour also took over the brand Opening Ceremony’s show for New York Fashion Week 2018 including Jiggly Caliente. But drag queens as models isn’t just a novelty in certain campaigns. Season 7 contestant Miss Fame is signed to Wilhelmina Models and has worked with brands such as Prada and Versace, as well as being a spokesmodel for L’Oréal Paris and the first drag queen to walk the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival. From the same season Violet Chachki has also become a fashion icon, she attended the Met Gala, and produced a video with Vogue, explaining her fashion choices and process of getting ready for the iconic event, as well as doing modelling work with big brands such as Moschino and Prada. This fashion has often been over the top, exaggerated and dramatized, and this has trickled over into mainstream fashion on many occasions.\n\nNowhere was this more evident than this year’s Met Gala where the theme was Camp: Notes on Fashion was co-chaired by Lady Gaga, who has often said that drag has been a great fashion inspiration to her, even shooting a cover for Vogue Japan and her music video for You and Ias her drag king alter ego Jo Calderone. The campy theme was inspired by Susan Sontag’s 1964 essay Notes on Camp, where she mentions the ‘particular relation between Camp taste and homosexuality’. This year’s Met Gala saw a great deal of ‘gender bending’ as it is often known, Harry Styles wore a Gucci one piece with puffy sleeves accompanied by a pair of heels, Jared Leto wore a sweeping red gown and Odell Beckham Jr. donned a black skirt with his sleeveless jacket. Blurring these gender lines has become more popular in mainstream media recently but the fact it is even possible is thanks in part to centuries of drag culture, stemming from theatre performances centuries ago before women were allowed to perform in plays. Men would therefore have to play women roles and their dresses would drag across the ground, which is where the term ‘drag’ comes from.\n\nMusic and Entertainment\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race queens seem to have taken over mainstream music and entertainment recently. On top of RuPaul’s own long-standing music career, launched mainly by his 1992 hit Supermodel (You better work)more and more queens have been occupying our Spotify playlists with their own music. Not only have queens like Alaska Thurderf*ck, Willam or Sharon Needles released dance – pop music more typically associated with drag, but artists like Trixie Mattel have shown us the versatility of drag queens in the music industry, with her country albums dealing with everything from her alcoholic stepfather to her perception of true love. Thorgy Thor is another drag queen who doesn’t just adhere to the pop stereotype. She plays violin, viola and cello and in 2017 made a cameo appearance in Mozart in the Jungle. However not only Drag Race queens are shaping the music industry today, but drag as a whole. From bearded Austrian drag queen Conchita Wurst winning the 2014 Eurovision with Rise like a Phoenix to drag queen Ada Vox’s success on 2018 American Idol years after Courtney Act’s iconic appearance on the first ever season of the show, drag and music are more frequently going hand in hand. Lady Bunny’s infamous outdoor drag festival Wigstock,which started in 1984 was even revived in 2018 after a 12-year gap, reflects the snowball effect that drag has had on the music industry in recent years.\n\nWith the music video for Taylor Swift’s LGBTQ+ anthem You Need to Calm Down including rows of drag queens impersonating famous celebrities and Iggy Azalea using Miss Vanessa Vanjie Mateoas a back-up dancer, extra in music videos or even in some cases stage double, it is clear that not only drag artists are embracing this drag craze in the music industry. Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, Cardi B and Iggy Azalea are all commonly referred to as ‘female drag queens’ that being women, who dress as men dressed as women.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious presence of drag queens however, is on our screens, through films, televisions and web series. Although RuPaul’s Drag Race, All Starsand RuPaul’s Drag Race UK are obvious examples of this, other shows and queens have also gained success on screen. Drag Racequeens have gone on to release and star in films and series on Netflix such as Bianca del Rio’s Hurricane Bianca and Alyssa Edward’s Dancing Queen. LGBTQ+ networks and streaming services such as Logo TV and Wow Presents, owned by the same company that produces RuPaul’s Drag Race have seen huge success in the last few years, with Trixie Mattel and Katya Zamolodchikova’s UNHhhheven being nominated for two Streamy Awards. With 526,000 and 1.36 Million subscribers respectively Logo TV and Wow Presentsare growing in success every day, by featuring some of our favourite Drag Race queens.\n\nBut drag queens haven’t just found this television success through World of Wonder and RuPaul, even watching my favourite cooking channel Bon Appétit on YouTube the other day I was amazed to see cooking videos with Shangela and Miz Cracker, or Shangela’s appearance in a recent advert for McDonalds. Most grandparents watch Mrs Brown’s Boyson the BBC and Everyone’s Talking about Jamie has been the talk of the West End, winning countless awards. Netflix originals such as Tales of the City feature Bob the Drag Queen and Katya Zamolodchikova, and Glow even helped us discover new drag queens, independent of RuPaul and Drag Race. Perhaps the highest profile impact that drag queens have made in recent media was the 2018, $36 million budget film A Star is Born, starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper and featuring Willam and Shangela.\n\nBut in actual fact the whole history of entertainment has always been intrinsically linked with drag, stemming from when women weren’t allowed to perform and male actors had to play female parts. This tradition is continued by pantomime dames, and other traditionally male roles, such as Edna in Hairspray always being portrayed by men, whether on stage or in films. For years, men have dressed up as women in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, inspired by Tim Curry’s portrayal of Dr Frank-N-Furter in 1975. Drag films such as Priscilla Queen of the Desert and Pink Flamingos are classics from our parents’ or grandparents’ times. Drag has always been present in mainstream entertainment, and its influence just seems to be growing and growing.\n\nDrag Values\n\nBut at its core, drag isn’t just about language, makeup, fashion, music or film. It is about love, acceptance and beauty in all forms. It is indisputable that drag and the culture surrounding it have impacted all of our lives through the ‘RuPaul Effect’, whether we know it or not, no matter our gender or sexual orientation. But as we reflect on this it is important to remember that drag has not always been the mainstream. A lot of people suffered terribly for this beautiful form of self expression to flourish or even be able to exist, and without them it never would have been able to touch our lives today. In the 20th Century dressing in drag was labelled a crime, even for women such as Dorothy Lawrence who in this country disguised herself as a man to be able to fight in the First World War. There was even once a time in America when you had to wear three pieces or more of gender appropriate attire at all times or you could be arrested for cross-dressing. In 1913 an article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle described a magistrate stating that ‘no girl would dress in men’s clothing unless she is twisted in her moral viewpoint’. Only thanks to the heroes who fought against this system are we free to express ourselves today. Because of these people, drag and its culture are about more than just glitter or screaming ‘Yaaas Queen’ at RuPaul’s Drag Race, they are a symbol of a century long struggle for freedom of self-expression.\n\nBut it is important to remember that this struggle is not over. All around the world and sometimes even right beneath our noses people are still fighting for the ability to express themselves freely, without fear of judgement or ridicule. In 2009, 67 men were arrested at a single private party in Saudi Arabia for cross-dressing and even in our own country we still have a long way to go; only a few months ago a drag queen in Manchester was attacked with a pool cue, and even queens who have found fame are not exempt. In 2018 Farrah Moan and Shea Coulee from Season 9 of Drag Race were accosted in a kebab shop in Newcastle and called ‘f*ggots’ and ‘walking STDs’.\n\nThe ‘RuPaul effect’is only the tip of the iceberg of a rich history and culture, so as we buy our tickets to Drag Con, tongue pop, ask our friends to ‘spill the tea’ or tune into the finale of Drag Race UK this week it is important that we take a minute to remember that while this beautiful art form continues to grow, this is only possible off the back of a brutal fight against oppression, fought by heroes to whom we must be eternally grateful. The continuation of this mainstreaming seems almost inevitable, and as the culture flourishes, it continues to spread love, beauty and joy to so many people. We are privileged to be able to enjoy this, but to do so we must accept all drag, and live by the values of love and acceptance it instils in us, never losing sight of where drag has come from, and the fight for equality that still takes place every day."
