        "text": "These days on RuPaul’s Drag Race, queens making their musical mark during their run competing on the show is an absolute essential. Whether they’re performing an original song in the talent show, slaying a verse in the final four performance or giving it Broadway in a Rusical – Drag Race queens have to prove their musical worth at some point or another. There’s always jokes about not ALL queens having to release music post-Drag Race (I’m looking at you, Tina Burner) but sometimes, Ru girls gift us with some absolute LGBTQ bangers. Here’s a round up of some of the best music to come from Drag Race queens after their time in the competition was over.\n\nI Adore U by Adore Delano\n\nAdore Delano, who’d previously competed on American Idol, felt like the first queen on RuPaul’s Drag Race who had the talent and look to fully make it as a successful crossover pop star. I Adore U is a perfect mix of electropop and rap that showcases how versatile Adore is musically.\n\nAmerican Apparel Ad Girls\n\nWillam, Courtney Act and Alaska coming together to cover Farrah Fawcett Hair by Capital Cities, aka one of the very best songs ever made, was a recipe for musical success from the off. The rewritten lyrics are as clever as the original’s, but full of Drag Race humour and queer references. Heaven!\n\nWerqin’ Girl (Professional) by Shangela\n\nShangela has star quality seeping out of her pores, and it radiates to the MAX on Werqin’ Girl, a song that was putting work bangers on the music map way before Britney Spears, Rihanna and Fifth Harmony. The way Shangela says “Move over amaCHORES” in her iconic accent is my reason for living.\n\nRubber Doll by Miss Fame\n\nIf there was ever going to be a drag queen you’d never expect to come out with one of the best pop bangers in Drag Race herstory, it would be Miss Fame. Rubber Doll is the kind of banger Britney Spears would have been begging to record in the late 00s. Immaculate!\n\nEcstasy by Courtney Act\n\nIt’s giving Selena Gomez and I’m living. This is pure pop heaven, and Courtney’s voice speaks for itself – easily one of the most powerful in all the Drag Race queens music genre.\n\nWeight by Latrice Royale\n\nThe first verse is one of the most legendary pieces of writing ever put to music and that is a hill I am willing to die on. The live performance Latrice did of it at the season seven finale warm up is ICONIC.\n\nLegs by Laganja Estranja\n\nThis is like a song Kesha would sacrifice a Victorian orphan to have recorded, but with Laganja on the mic it’s even better because she really can get her legs over head like a pretzel. And the rest!\n\nNails by Alaska\n\nNo one has spouted scripture as enduring as “If you’re not wearing nails, you’re not doing drag” like Alaska. Besides Ru herself, you’d be hard pressed to find as prolific and consistent a drag music artist as Alaska. She kills it nearly every time, but Nails is my favourite purely for the genius of “Cat scratch fever / Look like Sigourney Weaver” alone.\n\nMistress Violet by Violet Chachki\n\nEverything about Mistress Violet is done impeccably – it’s sleek, dark, sexy and fashion forward. Violet collaborating with Allie X on her own song is absolutely huge and we need a full album from them together.\n\nPurse First by Bob the Drag Queen\n\nBob really mastered the turning your Drag Race catchphrase into a banger here perfectly, and I hope they got the coin for it.\n\nThe Same Parts by Tatianna\n\nA genius move to turn one of the most iconic talent show performances ever into a bop. I love that The Same Parts is great whether it’s a spoken word piece or a pop banger.\n\nC.L.A.T.\n\nA bit of an exception to the post-show rule since CLAT came out just as season nine began to air, but it absolutely deserves a place in this round up. The four New York queens show exactly why the city always dominates Drag Race casts and the music scene.\n\nLevel Ya Pussy Up by Aja\n\nLevel ya pussy up! Level ya COOKIES up! Aja dominates on this absolute stone cold rap classic. The video game vibes and the savage lyrics are voguing heaven.\n\nCocky by Shea Couleé\n\nShea’s rap verse in Category Is is an all-time Drag Race best, so it was inevitable that her post-show single would go as hard as this. She absolutely destroys it in lyrics, delivery and style. It’s INSANELY good. Azealia Banks was shaking and crying. The Vixen nails her verse too.\n\nNow Or Never by Blair St Clair\n\nBlair went full pop princess for Now Or Never, serving vocals, production and a banging chorus and drop that the main girls would be gagging to record. It’s very Katy Perry in all the right ways.\n\nA Prueba De Todo by Valentina\n\nGirl we going ROSALÍA??? Valentina sings beautifully on this song that honestly the first time I heard I thought it was a cover. It’s that good. Such a banger.\n\nMy Pussy Is Like A Peach by Choriza May\n\nThe weirdest song on the list, but there’s a good case for it also being the best. It perfectly sums up everything great about Choriza May. Unexpected, hilarious, filthy and full of star quality and talent. So catchy and infectious.\n\nMoving Parts by Trixie Mattel\n\nTrixie’s country music is a beautiful contrast to the bangers Drag Race queens usually release in their music, and Moving Parts is easily her signature song. The chorus is outrageously well written.\n\nGod Save This Queen by Bimini\n\nI love that Bimini’s single release utilises everything that makes them so special and such an instant national treasure on God Save This Queen. The Sex Pistols-esque, riot grrrl vibe is perfect and stands them out from all other queens music post Drag Race.\n\nJantasy by Jan\n\nThe Rachel Berry of drag really had the audacity on this one didn’t she? She really had the nerve. Jantasy is ridiculous. It’s like being on speed for days. Manic! But, probably the best vocalist to ever go on Drag Race and Fantasy is eye-wateringly well sang – if you’ve got the stomach for it.\n\nHo Ho Ho Ho by Willam\n\nWillam is the undisputed queen of covers and parody when it comes to music from queens post-Drag Race, but it is her iconic Christmas banger Ho Ho Ho Ho that rises above the rest. I love the audacity, the filth and the rhyming of “rimming me” with “chim-er-ney”.\n\nOutside In by Tia Kofi\n\nWritten by the iconic duo that is Tom Aspaul and Little Boots, Outside In is easily one of the most chart ready and worthy songs ever released by a Drag Race alum. Tia serves main pop girl and pop vocals that will serve her excellently in a music career.\n\nBrown Cow Stunning by Monique Heart\n\nHello America! Brown Cow Stunning is a bit Drag Race girl single by numbers throughout its first verse, but then it kicks into its boppy chorus and Monique lays her pretty (brown cow) stunning vocals over a very danceable house beat. Definitely a serve.\n\nCome Through by Priyanka and Lemon\n\nA true viral hit, and with good reason. Come Through is the drag queen equivalent of Telephone by Lady Gaga and Beyoncé. Priyanka’s music has always had high production value and music videos that absolutely SERVE – but it is little old Lemon who elevates this track to legendary status thanks to the “straight up rapstress” serving the most fan-favourite verse to potentially ever come out of RuPaul’s Drag Race. Perfect way to end the round up, methinks\n\nFor all the latest Drag Race memes and Netflix news, drops and memes like The Holy Church of Netflix on Facebook.\n\nRecommended stories by this writer:\n\n• RuPaul’s Drag Race moving off Netflix for season 14 is the wrong decision – here’s why\n\n• Ok, this is the iconic rumoured cast for the upcoming Drag Race: UK Versus The World"
