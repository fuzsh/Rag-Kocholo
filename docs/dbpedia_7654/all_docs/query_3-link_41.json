        "text": "Loving and accepting yourself is easier said than done, no matter who you are or what you’re going through. But music can get you through pretty much anything. Thankfully, for members of the LGBTQ+ community, there are a lot of people (including some of our favorite musical artists) who have been there before and want to offer their support through their music. Sometimes the song you need is an angsty anthem. Other times you're happy as a clam and wanna pump your fists. And sometimes you need to sit in your feelings with a ballad. There are truly songs for every occasion.\n\nHere are the best LGBTQ+-inspired songs from the recent past that help spread the idea of love and acceptance of all people, no matter who they are or who they love, and some with lyrical tips for being an ally.\n\n\"Good Luck, Babe!\" by Chappell Roan\n\nDon't even think about suppressing those gay thoughts around Chappell Roan. The Missouri-raised artist, who has talked about growing up believing her sexuality to be a sin, is now about as unapologetic as they come.\n\n\"I'm Still Standing\" by Elton John\n\nNo matter what you've survived, this anthem will help you feel more than great about it.\n\n\"Never Been In Love\" by Will Jay\n\nLest we forget that the spectrum of asexuality is part of pride (did you know that Yasmin Benoit was the first ace Grand Marshall at NYC's March??) let's also vibe with this aromantic anthem.\n\n\"II Most Wanted\" by Beyoncé\n\nThe Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus duet is not necessarily a queer love song. It's not necessarily a romantic love song. The song is thought to be inspired by Thelma and Louise. Make of that what you will! One Genius annotation (again, make of that what you will) points out that Bey's mother-in-law married a woman in her 70s. The beautiful thing about music is that once it's out there it's ours to interpret, and if you want this to be an epic sapphic love song that's your prerogative!\n\n\"Pynk\" by Janelle Monae\n\nIf you want a more explicitly sapphic bop, look no further. Yes, this is the one where they're dressed as a velvet-y vag. \"Pink is the truth you can't hide,\" she says, after all.\n\n\"Gettin' Bi\" from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\n\nNow let's do a silly one! The musical television series has a lot of songs that are satirical and/or heartwarming. This high energy tune, sung by the recently out bisexual character Darryl whilst drenched in blue, pink, and purple lighting, tackles a lot of misconceptions about the sexuality in a fun and light way.\n\n\"Smalltown Boy\" by Bronksi Beat\n\n\"You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case/Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face\" Sometimes trading home and family for a new town and found family is necessary! It's sad, maybe bittersweet, and nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n\"True Colors\" by Cyndi Lauper\n\nYou with the sad eyes! Like many of the songs on this list, while the lyrics were maybe not intentionally about pride it's easy and so valid to make it about whatever. (Also, since I know a lot of you are thinking about it anyway: shoutout to the Glee cast version.)\n\n\"Love Me More\" by Sam Smith\n\nThis song is all about getting yourself out of a rut for whatever reason. It's not as loud as \"Unholy\" or even \"Stay With Me\" but sometimes that's exactly what we need! \"But lately, it's not hurtin' like it did before/Maybe I am learning how to love me more.\"\n\n/\n\n\"Lola\" by The Kinks\n\nOne of the first mainstream rock songs to be out and proud about its LGBTQ+ themes and a certified bop to boot! While it's not clear if the \"Lola\" in question is trans or cross-dressing but it ultimately doesn't matter. Gender is fake anyway!\n\n\"Ring of Keys,\" from Fun Home\n\nWhen Jeanine Tesori accepted the Tony Award for Fun Home, a coming-of-age musical based on Allison Bechdel's autobiographical graphic novel about her own coming out and, subsequently, her father's, Tesori said this: \"For girls, you have to see it to be it.\" That refers both to her career as a female composer, but also applies to the musical's \"I Want\" song. It took little Allison seeing an older queer woman at a diner, and feeling that pang of recognition inside, to understand what was possible for her life.\n\n\"Montero (Call Me By Your Name),\" by Lil Nas X\n\nBetween this and Sam Smith's \"Body Shop\" we're living in a fun time for explicitly and unapologetically queer anthems. After reclaiming country music with \"Old Town Road,\" he's reclaiming thin religious anti-gay arguments with lyrics like \"I'm not fazed, only here to sin/If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can.\"\n\n\"Grace Kelly,\" by Mika\n\nWhen you've \"gone identity mad\" just like Mika, this song is here for you. This song is about not putting yourself in a box and conforming to someone else's idea of who or how you should be. Its lyrics are defiant and angry but the tune is cheerful and confident, totally in control, which makes for a cathartic combo. (Also, if you're excited about the Wicked movie and haven't heard Mika's Wicked-ly talented collab with Ariana Grande called \"Popular Song,\" run don't walk.)\n\n\"Come To My Window,\" by Melissa Etheridge\n\nThe singer-songwriter's first hit post-coming out as a lesbian obviously became a gay anthem and iconic queer love song. \"What do they know about this love anyway,\" she sings. Sometimes that's the message you need. Screw the people who don't get it!\n\n\"All The Things She Said,\" by t.A.T.u\n\nOkay, this is a complex one. The members of the girl duo t.A.T.u were considered controversial to homophobic audiences because they would sing about wlw and make out on stage, and controversial to gay audiences because they were never in a relationship and therefore queer-baiting. One of the members, Julia Volkova, made some hella homophobic remarks in 2014. That was a whole thing. But you kind of can't deny the chokehold that their songs had on queer millennial girls. Sometimes you need angsty lyrics about how your crush is the only one that accepts you and makes you feel safe and seen.\n\n\"I Know A Place,\" by MUNA\n\nNow MUNA, on the other hand, is a band made up of three queer members who often use their music to inspire self-acceptance and assurance that safe spaces are waiting for you. The song was featured in Alex Strangelove and also The Carmilla Movie! Maybe you know them from the Eras Tour. Maybe you also know that the also covered Britney Spears's \"Sometimes\" on the Fire Island soundtrack. MUNA's music could be your whole Pride playlist, TBH.\n\n\"The Origin of Love,\" from Hedwig and the Angry Inch\n\nI think you kind of have to feel this song to get it. The film and stage musical (and iconic Riverdale episode) Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a complex, essential work of LGBTQ+ art. The song is about the relationship between two men, but it becomes almost epic in scale thanks to the mythological imagery in the lyrics.\n\n\"King for a Day,\" by Green Day\n\nThe parents in this song were not always accepting, but the song doesn't care. I just think it's important that Billie Joe Armstrong is a bisexual icon who wrote a ska song about giving gender roles the finger, okay????\n\n\"Sissy That Walk,\" by RuPaul\n\nHow can we not include a RuPaul song? From lyrics/life advice like \"Unless they paying your bills, pay them bitches no mind\" to \"And if I fly or if I fall/Least I can say, I gave it all\" this is premium inspirational material.\n\n\"The Lavender Song,\" by Kurt Schwabach and Mischa Spoliansky\n\nNot \"Lavender Haze,\" y'all, calm down. It's time for a history lesson! Also known as \"Das lila Lied,\" this is a German cabaret song about gay liberation that dates back to 1920. If you saw the movie Babylon last year and were surprised by how the lesbian lounge singer sang so openly about same sex attraction, know that songs like that did exist. This is one of them! In 2023, RuPaul’s Drag Race winner Jinkx Monsoon released a new cover of the song to fight anti-drag laws in the United States.\n\n\"Body Was Made,\" by Ezra Furman\n\nThis indie rock anthem is written in support of genderfluidity and desire that's far from heteronormative. More importantly, it's about how your body is yours and nobody's business but your own.\n\n\"Transgender Dysphoria Blues,\" by Against Me!\n\nWith a cheeky title, this song from Laura Jane Grace's band is very direct. Some LGBTQ+ songs make an effective use of metaphor. But trans listeners don't need to do any decoding here. It's about exactly what it sounds like. When she sings about having broad shoulders and \"no hips to shake\" that's pretty crystal clear.\n\n“Follow Your Arrow,” by Kacey Musgraves\n\nFans of Kacey’s music already know she’s never cared much about what other people think, and in “Follow Your Arrow,” she encourages other people do the same. With lyrics like “Make lots of noise / Kiss lots of boys / Or kiss lots of girls / If that’s something you’re into” and “Say what you feel / Love who you love / ’Cause you just get so many trips ’round the sun,” she uses this song to tell her fans to live for themselves.\n\n“You Need to Calm Down,” by Taylor Swift\n\nOne of the earliest singles from her Lover album, this song and music video (which included cameos from many members of the LGBTQ+ community, including the cast of Queer Eye) is a celebration of shutting down the haters who try to judge what other people are doing. “You are somebody that we don’t know / But you’re comin’ at my friends like a missile / Why are you mad? / When you could be GLAAD?” Taylor sings.\n\n“Same Love,” by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis feat. Mary Lambert\n\nIn this song, Macklemore raps about a time he questioned his own sexuality while addressing the fact that being gay doesn’t make anyone lesser than someone who is straight. In the chorus, Mary sings lines from her song “She Keeps Me Warm” about the love she has for another woman and how she’s unwilling to change who she is to make other people more comfortable.\n\n“Born This Way,” by Lady Gaga\n\nThis song is probably one of the biggest LGBTQ+ anthems of the past decade—and for good reason. Not only has Gaga become a gay icon herself, but this song is all about celebrating who you are because it’s who you were born to be—no matter what.\n\n“Girls Like Girls,” by Hayley Kiyoko\n\nIn “Girls Like Girls,” Hayley—who is openly gay and has been called “Lesbian Jesus” by fans—sings, “Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new.” Has anything ever been more true? In the end, it really is that simple.\n\n“Raise Your Glass,” by Pink\n\nSo much of Pink’s music is about self-acceptance, and this song is no different. In the chorus, she sings, “So raise your glass if you are wrong / In all the right ways,” and it’s all about being yourself.\n\n“We R Who We R,” by Kesha\n\nThis is another song that’s all about loving yourself for who you are. While Kesha doesn’t address the LGBTQ+ community directly, this song has definitely become an anthem anyway because it’s all about being who you are and making no apologies for it.\n\n“Girls/Girls/Boys,” by Panic! at the Disco\n\nBrendon Urie came out as pansexual in 2018, and in this song, he sings about love not being a choice because sometimes girls love girls and boys. In his words: “Girls love girls and boys / And love is not a choice.” Pretty simple to understand, right? If only the whole world felt that way!\n\n\"True Colors,\" by Cyndi Lauper\n\nTaking inspiration from her sister's coming out story, Lauper has no fears about speaking out for the LGBTQ+ community. In fact, this song about being true to yourself became such an anthem, she decided to co-found True Colors United, a non-profit organization whose focus is to end homelessness for LGBTQ+ kids. #amazing\n\n\"Bloom,\" by Troye Sivan\n\nWell, Troye clearly wasn't afraid to let the world know his preferred sexual position. This 2018 title track from his sophomore album is not only a great bop, but after hearing it, you'll definitely want this to make the rounds at your next (virtual) Pride party.\n\n\"Make Me Feel,\" by Janelle Monáe\n\nComing out as pansexual in 2018, Monáe proudly embraces her queer identity with this hit. Not only does it give the listener some truly funky vibes (after all, Prince did work on the tune with her), but she also made the point to feature on-again-off-again GF Tessa Thompson as her love interest in the vid.\n\n\"Strangers,\" by Halsey and Lauren Jauregui\n\nWhat happens when you get two proud bisexuals in the music studio? Fire, that's what. This 2018 anthem is not afraid to tell the demise of what used to be a sexually desirable romance. I mean, if the lyrics \"We're not lovers, we're just strangers / With the same damn hunger / To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all\" don't strike a chord, then what exactly does?\n\n\"Cool for the Summer,\" by Demi Lovato\n\nWell, Demi is never one to hide how proud she is of her queer identity, and this 2015 bop is just that. Telling the tale of a budding same-sex romance, Demi brings all the sexy and confidence to the perfect summer anthem.\n\n\"Take Me or Leave Me,\" by Idina Menzel and Fredi Walker\n\nUm, as if this isn't the most iconic Broadway duet in the last 25 years. Taken from the groundbreaking 1996 musical Rent, these powerhouse voices (and believe me... you'll be blown away) detail their pride for their truest identities—queerness and all.\n\n\"I Want to Break Free,\" by Queen\n\nAside from the band completely dressing up in drag throughout the iconic music video (can someone please get me all the costumes ASAP?), how could someone not include this on their Pride lists? I mean, the song is about letting all inhibitions go an being true to yourself.\n\n\"This Is Me,\" from The Greatest Showman\n\nSure, the movie might take some liberty at the creation of one of the most recognizable circuses worldwide, but with Keala Settle's powerful voice belting out words of empowerment, how can anyone not feel the need to live life as their truest selves? Technically this song isn't about gay pride at all. Sure, you could dig into the gender fluidity of the bearded lady character if you wanted, but I think it's a stretch. It's interesting. A lot of people thought that the titular character in Pasek and Paul's Dear Evan Hansen was gay too and his song \"You Will Be Found\" was about coming out, when in fact Dear Evan is straight and kinda narrow. Can P&P just write a regular-degular gay anthem already?? Clearly they have the chops!\n\n\"Dancing On My Own,\" by Robyn\n\nIt's pretty easy to see why this track has become so resonant within the queer community. With an iconic video, a pretty powerful repeated lyric, and great beats, it's the perfect anthem to sashay away with at your next Pride event.\n\n\"Beautiful,\" by Christina Aguilera\n\nSomehow Christina figured out exactly what we all needed to hear and crafted it into what is arguably one of the prettiest songs to ever exist. The message about loving ourselves, imperfections and all, has become a staple in the LGBTQ+ community and continues to be a source of strength for those who need just a little boost in queer faith."
