        "text": "'Tis the damn season — for a new Taylor Swift era.\n\nThe songstress surprised us all by revealing at the 2022 VMAs that her next release wouldn't be one of her rerecorded albums as previously assumed, but instead her much-anticipated 10th studio album, Midnights.\n\nLongtime fans know all too well that Swift loves her surprises and Easter eggs, and after two surprise drops with Evermore and Folklore, the mad woman herself has gone back to her release patterns of the past with an initial announcement and a slow trickle of information.\n\nLong story short, as we celebrate the release of Midnights — which in less than 24 hours became the most-streamed album in a single day (and later, for Swift, most-streamed artist) on Spotify and set the record for biggest pop album on Apple Music — EW has gathered all the information you need to know as you dive into the record.\n\nThe songs\n\nSwift poked fun at her Easter-egg-giving ways on Sept. 21, revealing on TikTok that she'd be unveiling one song title at a time, at random, in a video series cheekily called Midnights Mayhem With Me. The full track list has since been released:\n\n1. \"Lavender Haze\"\n\n2. \"Maroon\"\n\n3. \"Anti-Hero\"\n\n4. \"Snow on the Beach\" ft. Lana Del Rey\n\n5. \"You're on Your Own, Kid\"\n\n6. \"Midnight Rain\"\n\n7. \"Question…?\"\n\n8. \"Vigilante S---\"\n\n9. \"Bejeweled\"\n\n10. \"Labyrinth\"\n\n11. \"Karma\"\n\n12. \"Sweet Nothing\"\n\n13. \"Mastermind\"\n\nAdditionally, the bonus edition tracks were announced by Target on Oct. 13. They are: \"Hits Different,\" a strings remix of \"You're on Your Own, Kid,\" and a piano remix of \"Sweet Nothing.\"\n\nMidnights will mark a return to more personal subject matter, after Swift moved away from that a bit with her past two albums. In her note announcing the new record, she described it as \"the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.\"\n\n\"This is a collection of music written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams,\" Swift wrote. \"The floors we pace and the demons we face. For all of us who have tossed and turned and decided to keep the lanterns lit and go searching — hoping that just maybe, when the clock strikes twelve… we'll meet ourselves.\"\n\nTrue to the theme, after revealing the title of track 3, \"Anti-Hero,\" she also shared a behind-the-song featurette on Instagram in which she talked about the intimate nature of the piece, which she considers one of her favorites she's ever written.\n\n\"I don't think I've delved this far into my insecurities in this detail before,\" she said in the clip. \"I struggle a lot with the idea that my life has become unmanageably sized and, not to sound too dark, I struggle with the idea of not feeling like a person.\" She went on to tell fans not to feel bad for her and explained that \"Anti-Hero\" is a \"guided tour\" of all the things Swift tends to hate about herself.\n\n\"We all hate things about ourselves, and it's all of those aspects of the things we dislike and like about ourselves that we have to come to terms with if we're going to be this person,\" she said. \"So I like 'Anti-Hero' a lot because I think it's really honest.\"\n\nIn a subsequent explainer video, Swift discussed how her six-year relationship with actor Joe Alwyn inspired the album opener, \"Lavender Haze.\" She said she first heard the phrase while watching Mad Men, and upon looking it up she realized it was commonly used in the 1950s to describe being in love.\n\n\"Like, if you were in the lavender haze, then that meant that you were in that all-encompassing love glow — and I thought that was really beautiful,\" she said. \"And I guess theoretically, when you're in the lavender haze, you'll do anything to stay there and not let people bring you down off of that cloud.\"\n\nSwift continued: \"And I think a lot of people have to deal with this now, not just like 'public figures,' because we live in the era of social media, and if the world finds out that you're in love with somebody, they're going to weigh in on it. Like my relationship for six years: We've had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff, and we just ignore it. And so this song is about the act of ignoring that stuff to protect the real stuff. I hope you guys like it.\"\n\nYet another video revealed that the fourth track, \"Snow on the Beach,\" which features Lana Del Rey, was inspired by the \"cataclysmic, fated moment\" when you realize you're falling in love with someone at the same time as they're falling in love with you. Swift likened that realization to seeing snow falling on the beach. She also called Del Rey one of the \"best musical artists ever\" and said she'll \"be grateful for life\" for Del Rey's participation.\n\nThe 3 a.m. tracks\n\nBut wait... there's more! Hours after the album dropped on Oct. 21, Swift unleashed more chaos on her fans with seven more songs that she dubbed \"the 3 a.m. tracks.\"\n\n\"Surprise! I think of Midnights as a complete concept album, with those 13 songs forming a full picture of the intensities of that mystifying, mad hour. However! There were other songs we wrote on our journey to find that magic 13. I'm calling them 3am tracks,\" she wrote in a post announcing the news. \"Lately I've been loving the feeling of sharing more of our creative process with you, like we do with From The Vault tracks. So it's 3am and I'm giving them to you now.\"\n\nThe tracks — titled \"The Great War,\" \"Bigger Than the Whole Sky,\" \"Paris,\" \"High Infidelity,\" \"Glitch,\" \"Would've, Could've, Should've,\" and \"Dear Reader\" — are available to stream now.\n\nThough most of the songs see Swift again teaming up with Midnights collaborators such as Jack Antonoff, fans of Folklore and Evermore will be pleased to see Aaron Dessner's return here as co-writer and co-producer on \"The Great War,\" \"High Infidelity,\" and \"Would've, Could've, Should've.\" Dessner produced both of those aforementioned albums, but was, until now, absent from Midnights.\n\nWhen and where to buy\n\nThe album is now available to stream on Spotify and Apple Music. Physical copies of it — vinyl, CD, or cassette tape — can be purchased on Swift's website. Currently, there are four versions of the album available that come in the corresponding colors: Moonstone Blue Edition (the standard version), Jade Green Edition, Blood Moon Edition, and Mahogany Edition.\n\nAccording to Swift's website, each of the versions includes 13 songs, one of four collectible albums with unique front-and-back cover art, one of four unique collectible disc artworks, one of four unique marbled-color CD discs, and a collectible lyric booklet with never-before-seen photos. The standard edition vinyl and CD are also available in stores.\n\nBonus content\n\nSwift has a longstanding relationship with Target and is releasing a separate bonus edition of the album, which has been dubbed the Lavender Edition, to purchase there. As mentioned above, this edition includes three bonus tracks, two of which are remixes. The tracks are not going to be on the other editions of the album.\n\nProducers and collaborators\n\nThe credits and song lengths for Midnights appeared on iTunes on Oct. 18. Frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff cowrote 11 of the 13 songs with Swift, and she wrote one solo (\"Vigilante S---\"). Still another was written by her and Alwyn (\"Sweet Nothing\"), once again using the alias William Bowery. Other co-writers include Zoë Kravitz (\"Lavender Haze\"), Del Rey (\"Snow on the Beach\"), Mark Anthony Spears (\"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\"), Jahaan Akil Sweet (\"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\"), Sam Dew (\"Lavender Haze\"), and Keanu Torres (\"Karma\").\n\nIn the run-up to the album's release, Swift was mum about any potential collaborations, but a behind-the-scenes video showed her and Antonoff — who had a hand in producing tracks on past albums 1989, Reputation, Lover, Folklore, and Evermore — hard at work on Midnights, which he also produced with Swift.\n\nUpon Midnights' release, the album's credits revealed several famous faces, from Kravitz to Dylan O'Brien, who also provided surprising cameos to several tracks on the album.\n\nGenre\n\nSwift didn't release a single or any confirmation of what the album's genre would be before its release. Now that we've heard it, however, it's clear that Midnights is a return to the pop genre for Swift, after the more folk-alternative style of Evermore and Folklore. True to the album's aesthetic, though, the new record feels 1970s-inspired, with hints of the pop from that era sprinkled throughout.\n\nLyrics\n\nIn the lead-up to the album's release, Swift partnered with Spotify to unveil lyrics from Midnights on billboards around the world. The reveals kicked off Oct. 17 in New York, where the words \"I should not be left to my own devices…\" lit up Times Square. That was followed up the next day by a sign in London that read, \"I polish up real nice.\"\n\nOn a billboard in Sao Paulo, these lyrics were shared: \"Just like clockwork, the dominoes cascaded in a line.\" And, bringing it home, in Nashville: \"Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room?\" The final lyrics, revealed in Mexico City, were, \"Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out.\"\n\nSpotify also collaborated with Swift on a short video series to accompany the lyrics, in which she revealed five things that kept her up at night and helped inspire the Midnights album.
