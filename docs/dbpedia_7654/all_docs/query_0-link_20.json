        "text": "Hi everyone! i hope you all are good.\n\nFrom season 1 to 12, all the international forms of the show around the world, on All Stars and on every single version of the reality, we have seen a lot of references of Pop Divas on Rupaul's Drage Race.\n\nAnd i'm not talking about only songs of Pop Divas.\n\nRupaul starts her career as a singer oficially with her song \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\" from her first album \"Supermodel of the World\" (1993). Rupaul's career as a singer makes her a complete Pop Diva. She has 10 regular albumes, the last one it's \"You're a Winner baby\", and she always has included her songs on her show. I think it's so clever her strategy to use her music and show it on tv.\n\nOn the show we can listen on the lipsyncs, the music of Britney Spears, Rihanna, Cher, P!nk, Paula Abdul, Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera, and a lot of other talented persons. Some of them even have went to the show as a judge, making all gag about it.\n\nApart from lipsyncs, on the show exist something called \"Rusicals\", Maxi-Challenges where the queens have to perform just like on a Musical but a RPDR version. Two Rusicals that i wanna to highlight are: \"Cher, The Unauthorized Rusical\", and \"Madonna, The Unauthorized Rusical\". In both of them we can see different ages and styles of Cher's and Madonna's careers. I love Rusicals because we can be a little more close to the history and the progress of this Divas, being represented by a queen of the show. For me, the best of both worlds.You can check them here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwXp4geKjRE \"Cher, The Unauthorized Rusical\", Season 10.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyH9yZt2Yrs \"Madonna, The Unauthorized Rusical\", Season 12.\n\nWhy Pop Divas are so important to Rupaul's Drag Race, the queens and all the comunity? My point of view, is that they give us a safe space to express ourselvs. We can sing and dance and perform in general with her songs and we know that we are accepted for a lot of them. So many dragqueens grow up seeing the covers in magazines, dancing pop divas songs and dreaming to look like them someday. Pop divas are an inspiration, from the music to the way that they express with the comunity.\n\nLet me know what do you think about Pop Divas!"
