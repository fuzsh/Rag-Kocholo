        "text": "BE AWARE GIRLS ð donât put to much time or money in this, you are probably gonna loose anyways.\n\nI love this game, until today. Iâve spent so much money to upgrade both werk XP stations, and my wardrobe. Yesterday I spent another 85NOK so that I could upgrade my epic âMiss Vanjie Girlâ bodysuit to level 2 and have a better chance at winning against the others that have already upgraded it. I havenât seen any score higher than 13k before and the best fit was the âMiss Vanjie Girlâ clothes.\n\nWhat I didnât know was that I was gonna reach a whoooole new level, and now go up agains girls with a wardrobe score at 20k, and apparently clothing that takes more points than the epic/legendary âMiss Vanjie Girlâ clothes.\n\nSo I went from almost always winning with level 1 âMiss Vanjie Girlâ hair, level 3 uncommon âBabe Mackieâ dress, level 2 âMiss Vanjie Girlâ shoes to almost only loose with the same clothing but with the upgraded epic âMiss Vanjie Girlâ bodysuit.\n\nIâve had 5 wins today, of 20. And 4 of them were in the daily challenge. Imaging that, Iâve only won 1 of 10 challenges today after my upgrade. I gave it a try yesterday as well, I lost 3/3 challengesâ¦.\n\nThat is unbelievable!!! After giving this game so much time and money, to upgrade a clothing and SUDDENLY I CANT WIN ANYMORE.\n\nIâm furious, so sorry about my uppercase letters, but this is so not okay! Iâve been trying to take back my spot at 1st place in season 1, but I donât have a chance since the app decides who to win and who to loose in challengesâ¦. Now thereâs 3 hours until the season is ending, and if I canât take the 1st place after 3-4 weeks of challenges, spending hours a day and lots of money, which I probably donât make it to, I will delete this app. I will require compensations. This I ridiculous.. and it makes me so upset given the time and money I put in."
