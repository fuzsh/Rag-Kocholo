        "text": "RuPaul is the most successful drag queen in history (or, as they say on one of his television programs, \"herstory\") by a mile, and you don't get that title without being a marketing genius. He has turned dressing up as a woman and performing in a variety of ways into an empire over the years, one that now touches music, television, film, as well as a slew of products that bear his name and likeness. If he puts his mind and business acumen to it, he will succeed, and make a good living doing so.\n\nNow, the musician, author, producer and Emmy-winning TV host has decided it's time to look into the past for inspiration. He just released Remember Me: Essentials Vol. 1, which is much more than a best of compilation. For the project, Ru worked with fellow vocalists as well as remixers and producers to reimagine some favorites from his discography, adding in some previously unreleased material as well. This collection of reworkings isn't just about making a quick buck—it's purpose is to deliver a product to an audience that may just be learning who RuPaul is thanks to the incredible (and still growing) success of his reality program RuPaul's Drag Race, which is returning to Logo for its ninth regular season (and 11th overall) next month.\n\nI spoke with RuPaul about his new album and why an item like this is a brilliant marketing decision.\n\nHugh McIntyre: Congrats on the new release. What do you call this? Is it a remix package or a greatest hits compilation?\n\nRuPaul: It's all of the above. These are songs that I've revisited from my early career, and re-imagined them and re-performed them. Yeah, that's really what it is. I don't know if there's even a genre for that, but it is everything you said and more.\n\nMcIntyre: And you also added a few new songs as well, right?\n\nRuPaul: Yes. Yes, there are... Well they're actually some songs that were written back then that were never recorded. \"Mighty Love\" is a song that was written back then that was never recorded. Actually there was a demo of it, but I never put it out. And then \"Rock It (To The Moon)\" is a reworking of a song from my Starrbooty album. From 10 or 12 years ago.\n\nMcIntyre: So what made you decide to recreate and re-record these songs at this point?\n\nRuPaul: Well, I've always loved those songs, and there's a new audience who really haven't heard them. Part of my job and career has been to be a curator, and to point kids in the direction that they need to see things. They’re inundated with so much information, and this is a way for me to curate my back catalog so they can understand what's happening. I learned very early in my career as a businessman that someone turns 18 every day. They've never heard of bell bottoms, so what do you do? You sell them some motherf**king bell bottoms.\n\nMcIntyre: That's a good point.\n\nRuPaul: It's marketing 101.\n\nMcIntyre: I'm glad you brought that up because I was going to comment that your show, Drag Race, has exploded in the past couple years. What has that done for you musically in terms of sales and streams?\n\nRuPaul: Well, as years go on the music sales for everyone have declined. I do have an audience for that, but all of these kids are streaming this stuff. I do music because I love it. I've always loved it, and it's never been a big moneymaker. I don't get radio play, but the songs, my songs, get heard on our television show or in the promos for our television show. It's not really a big audience. I do it because I just love it.\n\nMcIntyre: Speaking of the trailer, I just watched the one for season nine and \"Rock It (To The Moon)\" is featured. Is that song going to be prominently featured throughout this season?\n\nRuPaul: Yeah, we put it here and there throughout the season. Yeah, sure. All of my catalog is used on the show, so again I don't get radio play. And listen, I'm not complaining. Most people don't radio play, but it's the only place where our audience can hear our music, my music.\n\nMcIntyre: Since it's such an important way of promoting the music, how do you schedule releasing an album or a remix package or a single before a new season of Drag Race comes out?\n\nRuPaul: Well, I'm always working on music. You know, when we film our show, I'm focused on filming the show, but when we're not filming the show, or I'm not filming another show, a different show, I'm working on different projects, but music is always a constant. I'm always writing songs and working with different people. And in fact, it's a way for me to stay busy and stay engaged and to be a touchstone for my creativity. I've always loved writing songs and working and collaborating with different musicians.\n\nMcIntyre: So the music on this collection bounces from \"Rock It (To The Moon),\" which is a contemporary electro song, but others have that 90s house sound. How much did you focus on updating versus changing and reworking?\n\nRuPaul: Well, all of my music really has to do with what I'm loving at the time, and I have a very eclectic pallet. I love jazz. I love dance music. I love electronic, and I love the 90s house stuff which has made a huge resurgence in recent years.\n\nBut honestly, my albums really reflect, mostly, what I'm listening to. And one of the big things that I really love is when I'm on the subway, or something, I like instrumental dance music. Or dance music. The genre called chopped and screwed, where they take the hook of something and turn it into whole song. I really love that. I love how truncated and abbreviated it is. It's just right to the point. It's like all thrills no fill.\n\nMcIntyre: That's supposed to be what pop music is a lot of the time, so that's fair.\n\nRuPaul: Yeah.\n\nMcIntyre: In terms of the artists featured on this album, the remixers and some of the vocalists, how did you go about choosing the people that would be a part of this?\n\nRuPaul: Well, I'm always searching for people to collaborate with, and it's sort of a rotating directory of people. So at any given time, whoever I gel with is who I'm going to collaborate with. It's usually people who I like what they do. It's really very simple. If I dig them and we get on really well, then I do something with them, and then do more with them. But over the years, I've collaborated with lots and lots and lots of people. Lots of people have different skill sets. I like to utilize those.\n\nMcIntyre: When I'm looking at your more recent catalog, some of it seems to be just your own work, while other releases seem to be songs that were written for Drag Race or feature contestants. Do you go out of your way to keep those two things somewhat separate when creating?\n\nRuPaul: Well, what I think what you're talking about, is for some of the Cover Girl albums, which are where the contestants will record something from my catalog. They're separate just by nature of the fact that I recorded years ago and then we'll put out an album with the girls doing it. But no, what I do is always really separate from those... I don't know what you call them. They're actually sort of soundtracks to the show. Well it's almost all soundtracks to the show. Yeah, we've done that twice.\n\nAnd then we have some one-off singles. We have a single from last season, “Read U, Wrote U.” Those are just one-offs, sort of camp companion pieces for the television show. Just in terms of marketing, today consumers want several tiers of value. Several levels of value. Where it's the product, the aesthetic, the language, the feeling, the lifestyle, so with our TV show, the music helps fill in part of that experience for the viewer. They get to hear the song, they get to see the song being made on television on our show, and then they get to go out and buy it. So that sort of integration has become commonplace for, not only television, but all businesses have to acknowledge that that's what the consumer wants.\n\nMcIntyre: You're now 20 years into your music career. I know you said...\n\nRuPaul: Well, yeah, but actually, I got the record deal with Tommy Boy 25 years ago, but before that I had been recording in my little punk rock band for 10 years before that, so we're going back 35 years.\n\nMcIntyre: Oh wow. So three and a half decades in, I know you said you love it, but what still inspires you and what's coming up next for you?\n\nRuPaul: What inspires me is that I love music. I love how technology has changed how you can make the music, and I love how the human ear actually has evolved, like with this genre chopped and screwed where you just do the chorus over and over. Years ago all songs used to have a preamble, and that went away. And then 20 years ago, people started doing away with longer verses and longer choruses and stuff. That's what's inspiring to me.\n\nWhere am I go with it? I don't know. I don't know. I'm planning some other releases this year. I don't know if it was last year or the year before, but I did three releases in one year once. And then other off-shoots and things like that. But, you know, I like to stay busy."
