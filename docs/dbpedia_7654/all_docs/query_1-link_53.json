Rowdy fun with the glamor of a Broadway musical.”\n\nThe “epic cast of drag, theater, and LGBTQ+ icons” (Entertainment Tonight) features Alaska Thunderf*ck (through 1/11/25), Jujubee, Jan Sport, Lagoona Bloo, J.

Then I realized being an actor is hard, so I became a Drag Queen. Now, after almost 20 years of drag, I've written myself into a musical. I think New York audiences are going to love this sweet and simple tale of Drag Queens being cunty to one another. What I’m trying to say is: dreams really do come true.\"\n\nThe design team includes Jason Sherwood (Scenic Design) Marco Marco (Costume Design), Adam Honore (Lighting Design), Drew Levy (Sound Design), and Aaron Rhyne (Projection Design).\n\nGeneral Management is by KGM Theatrical.
