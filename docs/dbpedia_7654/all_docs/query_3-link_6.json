        "text": "RuPaul Andre Charles, better known simply as RuPaul, is an American drag performer, actor, television host, and recording artist. RuPaul is well known for appearing in several films, and being the host and judge for his own popular reality television series RuPaul's Drag Race, for which he has received 14 Primetime Emmy Awards as of 2024.[2]\n\nRuPaul is considered to be the most commercially successful drag queen in the United States.[3] In 2017, he was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[4]\n\nDrag Name Origin[]\n\nRuPaul decided to keep her birth name RuPaul, but without Charles at the end.\n\nBiography[]\n\nRuPaul, birth name RuPaul Charles, was born in San Diego, California on November 17, 1960. He was named by his mother, Ernestine Charles; the \"Ru\" came from roux, which is the term for the base of gumbo and other creole stews and soups. Finding global success in the 90s and again in recent years with his TV shows, including RuPaul's Drag Race, and his oversized personality, RuPaul has become a beacon in LGBTQ+ communities.[citation needed]\n\nAt the age of 15, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia with his sister and her husband. There, he was studying at the School of Performing Arts - though never graduated - and worked in his family's business of selling used cars for six years. By the 1980s, RuPaul began crossdressing and was known to be a \"gender bender\", performing at Atlanta clubs either as a go-go dancer or with his new wave/punk band, RuPaul and the U-Hauls and later, Wee Wee Pole.[citation needed]\n\nAfter spending a brief time in New York City, RuPaul moved back to Atlanta and participated in underground cinema, starring in the Starbooty film trilogy alongside his roommate Lady Bunny and DJ Larry Tee. RuPaul decided that he would make a name for himself before moving to New York, pasting posters and selling postcards of himself that said \"RuPaul is Everything,\" among others, all throughout midtown Atlanta.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1987, RuPaul officially moved to New York City where he would become part of the burgeoning drag scene. RuPaul has said that he changed his image from \"punk drag\" to \"black hooker drag\" while in New York. He quickly befriended several Club Kids, a group of counterculture nightlife entertainers known for their flamboyancy and eccentricity, after Susanne Bartsch hired him to appear at her iconic parties. Here, RuPaul would meet Michelle Visage who would become his on-air sidekick and one of his closest friends. He continued to perform in clubs as a dancer and made many appearances at Lady Bunny's annual drag festival, Wigstock, in the East Village. His larger-than-life personality and ease on stage earned him popularity and he, along with Susanne Bartsch and Lady Bunny, became a staple within New York's nightlife. Before the decade was over, RuPaul would be hailed as the Queen of Manhattan.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul gained worldwide fame with the release of his 1993 album, \"Supermodel of the World\". The album's first single, \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\", reached the Top 50 of the pop charts and no. 2 on the dance club charts. The single was also nominated for the Best Dance Music Video award in the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards. In 1994, RuPaul landed a modeling contract as the first face of MAC Cosmetic's Viva Glam line. With his new \"glamazon supermodel\" drag caricature, RuPaul became one of the first drag queens to enter the mainstream and has subsequently become an icon of pop culture.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1996, he debuted his own TV talk show on VH1, called The RuPaul Show. Co-hosted by Michelle Visage, it was one of the first TV programs in the United States hosted by an openly gay person. His first guest was his number one icon and muse, Diana Ross. Other notable guests included Cher, Bea Arthur, and Nirvana while his show aired for 2 years. RuPaul continued his acting and music career throughout the 90s, though took a step back from the industry and moved to Los Angeles in 1998. Ready to return to show business, RuPaul released his fourth album, \"Red Hot\", in 2004 and starred in the 2007 film Starrbooty, which served as the fourth film in the Starbooty series.[citation needed]\n\nIt wasn't until 2009 when RuPaul truly made his mark on the cultural landscape with the debut of RuPaul's Drag Race, a reality TV game show that first aired on Logo. The success of the show has sparked several spin-off series including Untucked, RuPaul's Drag U, and RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars. RuPaul has been noted as having a large part in RuPaul's Drag Race 's continuous television success. By pioneering queer representation on television, many believe RuPaul to have essentially revolutionised the portrayal of the LGBTQ+ community on screen. He first won an Emmy for his work on the show in 2016, and one year later the show garnered 8 nominations, including Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first time in its 11-season run, and a second consecutive win for RuPaul in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Competition Program.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul is married to Georges LeBar, an Australian author and painter. The two met in 1994 at the Limelight nightclub in New York City, marrying in January 2017. Together, they live on a 50-acre ranch in Wyoming.[citation needed]\n\nMemorable Quotes[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nRuPaul was born at 7:58 PM PST.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul was kicked out of high school.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul was a part of an experimental band called The Now Explosion in the 70s, and a punk-rock band called Wee Wee Pole in the early 80s.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul can be seen in the B-52's music video for \"Love Shack\". RuPaul describes this as his big break, as it was his first prominent exposure to fame.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul was voted \"Queen of Manhattan 1990\" by club owners, promoters and DJs.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul scored four #1 singles from his debut album on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts, with Supermodel (You Better Work), A Shade Shadey (Now Prance), Back To My Roots and House Of Love. RuPaul becomes the first drag queen to make the Hot 100, reaching as high as #45.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul ended his affiliation with MTV shortly after the success of his debut album. His departure came after a live telecast of the 1993 VMAs, where he uttered negative remarks to co-presenter comedian Milton Berle. His representatives later made a public statement that his offense was provoked by Berle's vulgar comments and sexual assault backstage during the show.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul made a media comeback in 1996 after the tabloids dubbed him \"The Wicked Witch of MTV\" following the drama with Milton Berle. He appeared in an exuberant gown by fashion designer Bob Mackie, who has appeared as a guest judge on RuPaul's Drag Race, at the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul hosted his own variety show on VH1 called The RuPaul Show in 1996, notable as being one of the first national television programs in the United States to be hosted by an openly gay host.[citation needed]\n\nOn the week of RuPaul's 40th birthday in 2000, a replica statue of him was unveiled at Madame Tussaud's wax museum in New York City.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul was the surprise guest at the VH1 Divas 2000: A Tribute to Diana Ross in an all star lineup that included Donna Summer, Faith Hill, Destiny's Child, and Mariah Carey, performing Ross's hit song \"I'm Coming Out\".[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul is ranked #85 on E TV's \"101 Reasons The '90s Ruled\".[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul has appeared in five films with actress Stockard Channing in Smoke (1995), To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995), An Unexpected Life (1998) and The Truth About Jane (2000).[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul was featured in Lady Gaga's Christmas special Lady Gaga & the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular and did a duet of her song \"Fashion\".[citation needed]\n\nIn March 2018, RuPaul caused major controversy after his exclusionary comments regarding trans drag queens competing on RuPaul's Drag Race. He later backtracked and publicly apologized. The show has since included transgender and cisgender drag queens in the competition.[citation needed]\n\nOn March 16, 2018, RuPaul got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It is located in front of the World of Wonder offices on Hollywood Boulevard. He is the first drag queen to get a star.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul has been impersonated thrice on the Snatch Game, by Jessica Wild on Season 2, Trixie Mattel on All Stars 3 and Diamante Merybrown on España 2.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul, along with Raja, made an appearance in The Simpsons (Season 30 Episode 7), playing the character Miss Shante. He helps Marge to become confident being a drag queen.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul appeared in Taylor Swift's music video for \"You Need to Calm Down\".[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul appeared on SNL in February 2020.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul announced RuPaul's Drag Race Live! in 2019, a residency show in Las Vegas. It features a rotating cast of fourteen performers, which has included RuPaul's Drag Race contestants such as Aquaria, Yvie Oddly, Jaida Essence Hall, Asia O'Hara, Alexis Mateo, Coco Montrese, Trinity K. Bonet and Derrick Barry.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul's favourite colour is orange.[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul has done product collabs with a lot of brands including:\n\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop[5]\n\nCheez-It[6]\n\nChia Pet[7]\n\nChocoLab[8]\n\nColorevolution[citation needed]\n\nFisher-Price[9]\n\nFunko[citation needed]\n\nParty City[citation needed]\n\nSuperdrug[citation needed]\n\nRuPaul won a competition called \"Drag Race\" hosted by Chi Chi LaRue in 1986, in which she sang \"Star Booty\".[10]\n\nRuPaul revealed in the Episode 2 of All Stars 5, that her celebrity crush is Ed O'Neill from \"Married With Children\".\n\nRuPaul has her own Monster High Doll.[11]\n\nGallery[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Promo Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race All Stars Promo Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race UK Promo Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Down Under Promo Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race Promo Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race UK vs The World Promo Looks[]\n\nRupaul's Drag Race Global All Stars[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Spin-Off Series Promo Looks[]\n\nOthers[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nTitle Release Date Cover Art Supermodel of the World June 8, 1993 Foxy Lady October 29, 1996 Ho, Ho, Ho October 28, 1997 Red Hot September 21, 2004 Champion February 24, 2009 Glamazon May 3, 2011 Born Naked February 24, 2014 Realness March 2, 2015 Slay Belles October 23, 2015 Butch Queen March 4, 2016 Remember Me: Essential, Vol. 1 February 3, 2017 American March 24, 2017 Essential, Vol. 2 June 9, 2017 Christmas Party November 1, 2018 Queen of Queens April 29, 2019 You're a Winner, Baby January 10, 2020 MAMARU January 7, 2022 Black Butta January 6, 2023 Essential, Vol. 3 January 5, 2024\n\nBibliography[]\n\nTitle Release Date Cover Lettin it All Hang Out:\n\nAn Autobiography June 6, 1996 Workin' It!
