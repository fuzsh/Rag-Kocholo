        "text": "Ballroom culture, also known as 80s Ballroom, emerged in New York City during the 1980s. It is rooted in the LGBTQ+ community, particularly among African American and Hispanic queer individuals. The Ballroom scene provided a space for self-expression, creativity, and competition, blending elements of fashion, dance, music, and performance.[1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nBeginning in the late 20th century, African American and Hispanic drag queens began to organize their own pageants in opposition to racism experienced in established drag queen pageant circuits. Though racially integrated for the participants, the judges of these circuits were mostly white people.[1]\n\nDetailed history[]\n\nBallroom culture has its roots in the African American and Hispanic LGBTQ+ communities of New York City. It emerged in the 1960s as a response to discrimination and exclusion faced by these communities in mainstream society. Ballroom culture provided a safe and empowering space for individuals to express themselves, showcase their talent, and compete in various categories.\n\nThe ballroom scene initially revolved around drag balls, where participants would compete in runway walks, dance battles, and other performance categories. These events became a platform for individuals to celebrate their identities, express their creativity, and form chosen families within the community. Ballroom culture provided an escape from the challenges of everyday life and offered a supportive environment for LGBTQ+ individuals to flourish.\n\nThe ballroom culture gained broader recognition and visibility in the late 1980s and early 1990s through the documentary film \"Paris is Burning.\" Directed by Jennie Livingston, the film documented the lives and experiences of ballroom participants, showcasing their vibrant fashion, voguing dance style, and the rich culture of the ballroom scene. \"Paris is Burning\" brought ballroom culture to a wider audience, highlighting its influence on mainstream fashion, music, and dance.\n\nOver the years, ballroom culture has evolved and expanded, spreading to cities across the United States and around the world. It has influenced various art forms, including fashion, dance, music, and language. The culture has its own unique vocabulary, with terms like \"shade,\" \"reading,\" and \"voguing\" becoming widely recognized and used in popular culture.\n\nBallroom culture continues to thrive today, with vibrant ballroom events, competitions, and houses (families or support networks) active in numerous cities globally. It has also had a significant impact on mainstream fashion and pop culture, influencing runway shows, music videos, and red carpet looks.\n\nWhile ballroom culture has faced challenges, including appropriation and commodification, its resilience and cultural significance remain strong. It continues to provide a space for self-expression, celebration, and community-building, empowering LGBTQ+ individuals to embrace their identities, showcase their talents, and create their own definitions of beauty and style.\n\nVisuals[]\n\nHere are some key visual aspects of the 80s Ballroom aesthetic:\n\nExtravagant Outfits: Ballroom participants showcased their creativity and style through extravagant and elaborate outfits.
