        "text": "When Trixie Mattel first appeared as a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed 24-year-old on the seventh season of RuPaul’s Drag Race back in 2015, her entrance to the show’s backstage “werkroom” was met with bewilderment from her fellow competitors. “Drag queens always say, ‘Paint for the back row,’ but I paint for the check-cashing place down the street,” was how Mattel described her extreme—and to be fair, a little rough around the edges—beauty at the time, an approximation of the beloved Barbie dolls she’d grown up with as a kid in rural Wisconsin, mashed up with the cartoonishly exaggerated eyeliner of Divine. (Mattel was booted in the fourth episode, but made a brief return later that season; emerging as a fan favorite in the aftermath, she won a season of the franchise’s All-Stars off-shoot in 2018.)\n\nSeven years on, through a combination of charm, luck, a relentless work ethic, and an unpretentious willingness to throw it at the wall and see what sticks, Mattel is widely viewed as the most successful contestant ever to have graced RuPaul’s runway. Mattel—real name Brian Firkus—has built an empire that spans music, books, cosmetics, nightlife, podcasts, comedy web series, and, as of this year, a motel in Palm Springs. (Never one to miss a promotional opportunity, Mattel documented her foray into hospitality via an eight-episode series on Discovery+ that debuted last month.)\n\nWhen Mattel and I speak, it’s after midnight in Sydney, Australia, where she’s on a world tour with frequent collaborator and fellow Drag Race success story Katya. The pair are playing five consecutive nights at the city’s 2,000-seat State Theatre, some of the first in over 70 dates scheduled around the globe, stretching all the way to December. “It’s pretty crazy,” says Mattel, now back in her hotel room. “Well, it was particularly crazy tonight, as there’s a part at the beginning where this cloth is supposed to drop, and it didn’t drop. But you know, it’s not a drag show unless something seriously fundamentally wrong happens.”\n\nShe might be a bit fatigued after a busy week on the road—she apologetically takes a moment to start running herself a bath when I indicate we’re reaching the end of the interview—but Mattel’s sandpaper-dry humor is in full evidence. How is she finding it Down Under? “I mean, Australia is weird, but I’m from small-town Midwest America, so everywhere is weird to me. California is weird to me. I get to Australia and I’m like,” she puts on a thick country accent: “They don’t have hot dogs here?”\n\nThe real reason we’re talking, however, is that Mattel’s fourth studio album is about to be released. Titled The Pink & Blonde Albums, it’s a double-sider that pays tribute to the music Mattel was spinning most frequently during lockdown; a heady mix of new wave power-pop like Blondie and The Go-Gos and turn-of-the-millennium indie-pop courtesy of The Shins and Fountains of Wayne. Mattel is excited for the new record to drop, even if it comes as a surprise to her that it’s coming out the day after we talk. “Oh my God, it is tomorrow,” she says, her eyes widening.\n\n“I processed it so long ago,” she adds. “I recorded some of the songs four years ago, and I took the album art like two years ago. It’s not that I’m not excited, it’s just that I’ve already sort of birthed the baby, and now I’m showing people the baby. The hard part for me—and the most artistically fulfilling part—was making it, conceiving it, writing it. This part, where the fans get to hear it, it almost has nothing to do with me. Whether a billion people listen to it or one person listens to it, my experience making the record is kind of the same, you know?”\n\nMattel, who is half-Ojibwe, grew up in rural Wisconsin to a single mother and an absent father; after she was subjected to emotional and physical abuse from a homophobic stepfather, social services moved her to live with her grandparents at the age of 15. (It’s a period Mattel talks about in the documentary Moving Parts, which premiered at Sundance in 2019.) There, the fascination with music she first discovered as a kid—buoyed by her obsession with Michelle Branch, an artist who, in a full-circle moment, features on Mattel’s new album—was encouraged by her country musician grandfather, and Mattel eventually attended the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee to study musical theater, where she began dabbling in drag.\n\nWhen she sent off her audition tape for Drag Race, Mattel didn’t imagine combining her love for country music with her nascent interest in drag was even a possibility, let alone something that would ultimately become her signature. “I thought that putting on the wig and the dress was like pouring cement over the coffin of a music career,” she says, laughing. “The week before I submitted my tape for RuPaul’s Drag Race, I auditioned to play guitar and sing at the Potbelly Sandwich Shop down the street from my house on the east side of Milwaukee—and they passed.” Once that season of Drag Race rolled out, and she started getting booked for regular, increasingly lucrative gigs, she understood drag was the most realistic path to pursue. “I just took it as the universe sending me in a strange direction,” she says. “I had been to music school, where they had told us that 90% of us graduating were not going to have music careers, so if I could quit my day job to do drag, I thought, it’s pretty obvious I should follow this.”\n\nThe history of drag queens releasing music is checkered, to say the least. While RuPaul herself kicked things off with 1992’s “Supermodel (You Better Work)”—an irresistible pop banger so infectious that Kurt Cobain named it one of his favorite songs of that year—the cultural juggernaut of Drag Race has led most contestants to release their own music primarily as another revenue stream. (Unlike Mattel’s sincere country-pop, the usual route is to release something with innuendo-heavy lyrics, drenched in enough AutoTune to make even Cher flinch.) “I was working nightclubs for like $30 a gig, so I wasn’t going to show up and ask if I could soundcheck a guitar at the beginning and play a country song,” Mattel says. “Let’s be honest, the drunk gays just want Britney and they want it now.”\n\nMattel’s first album, Two Birds, was released in 2017, slowly climbing to number two on the Billboard Top Heatseekers charts; the follow-up a year later, One Stone, hit number one on the same chart, as well as number 10 on the Billboard independent albums chart. Where both leaned more heavily into the country sound that Mattel was initially inspired by—her hero is, unsurprisingly, Dolly Parton—her 2020 follow-up, Barbara, leaned instead into the sonic textures of pop, alongside touches of surf rock and new wave.\n\nThe Blonde & Pink Albums began, in part, when Mattel was locked down during the first wave of COVID, and found herself questioning not just who she was making music for, but which part of her identity was making the music to begin with. “In the past, I felt like I was using Trixie to perform the music—though I played them in drag, they were all about my real life,” she says. “With these songs, I was almost writing them for Trixie, and about that persona. Even ‘Goner,’ which is a little more autobiographical, is about how being Trixie changed some of the relationships in my life with friends and family.\n\n“It’s very strange when you realize so many of your own life experiences are drawn from a fake person,” she continues. “During COVID, when I stopped working, it was like, wow, I don’t really have a life outside of Trixie. All my friends, my hobbies, my work, everything is about cross-dressing and telling jokes and singing songs. I wasn’t overthinking it while I was writing the record, because I don’t really approach songwriting with an objective, and I don’t have a real idea of what I’m saying until I’ve said it, but when I finished this huge batch of songs, and I laid them out like runestones and tried to decide what it all meant, I realized it was about me responding to these dark times by listening to a lot more sparkly music, and I think that came through in the writing, and channeling that into Trixie.”\n\nThe Blonde & Pink Albums have only been out a few weeks, but both critics and Mattel’s fiercely loyal fanbase have noted it has an unusually sunny, upbeat vibe. The only outlier, perhaps, is “This Town,” a song featuring the Texas-based Americana musician Shakey Graves, which pays tribute to the small town in which Mattel grew up. “Small towns can be very beautiful and sweet and intimate, and they can protect you in a way,” she says. “But they can also facilitate a sort of darkness, as issues like domestic abuse and substance abuse are all just in front of everyone’s faces. Everyone knows everyone’s business and no one says anything. So that song was sort of a love letter to being from a small town.”\n\nIn early June, Mattel became the first drag queen ever to perform as a musical guest on late-night television, courtesy of Jimmy Kimmel (indeed, RuPaul herself has never had the honor). While Mattel’s relentless schedule meant she didn’t have much time to process its significance beforehand, when she stepped onto the stage to perform, something clicked. “I remember watching late-night television with my grandparents—we lived so far north we could barely get TV reception, but we would watch late-night performances,” she says. “When I was up there playing, it just occurred to me at that second that this song I’ve written about my hometown is going to play in my hometown tonight. It made the circle feel complete in a way that I was just not ready for.\n\n“I wouldn’t say I was crying, but it just really moved me,” she continues. “When you get to do cool things, you’re supposed to be like, ‘Oh, I always knew this would happen.’ But I truly never thought I would get to do these things, so when I was hit in the face with the reality of it really happening, it was impossible to even process.”\n\nIs Mattel carving out the time to process all of this? A cursory Google search makes it clear that she doesn’t have more than a few days off until the end of the year. “With the new book, the new record, Trixie Motel, Netflix, the podcast, the tours, I was sort of like, I don’t ever want to be this busy again, to be honest,” she says with a sigh. “I’m so grateful, of course, and it’s honestly made me a better performer than ever, as I can never really get too psyched out. If I just sat around all the time and then had one gig a month that was important, I would give myself an ulcer worrying about it, but you don’t really have time to reflect. You do it, and as soon as it’s done, you go to bed and do the next thing.”"
