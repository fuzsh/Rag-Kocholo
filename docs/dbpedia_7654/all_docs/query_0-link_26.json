        "text": "From this brilliant article\n\nhttp://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6480364/rupaul-drag-race-interview\n\nBecause you mention it… you have a new album coming out? Is that a brand-new album? What can we say about it?\n\nIt's a brand-new album and it's a bit of a departure because Lucian [Piane, who produced RuPaul's last three albums] has only done two songs on this record and I've visited some old friends. Like, I'm reunited with Eric Kupper, 22 years later. [Kupper produced RuPaul's debut album, Supermodel of the World, which includes RuPaul's iconic single \"Supermodel (You Better Work).\"]\n\nWow. Wow! Crazy!\n\nWell, 22 years from when we first got together. I think we did a few things on an album in the mid-'90s [Foxy Lady]. But yeah, he's great. He actually did the title track with me, \"Realness.\"\n\nEXCITED. I really can'y believe we're getting a new album already, I 100% was expecting to have to bop to Born Naked for another 2-3 years. It sounds like from the article they might and try and get one out next year!\n\nColour me can't wait!\n\nPerched for Mother Ru to bring the bops!\n\nI would not be averse to an album full of Sissy That Walk's which was my jam for the whole of last year (and got dragged for playing it on plug DJ). Glamazon was also a fucking good album.\n\nOh YES this makes me so happy, even if Born Naked was a bit of a misstep in my eyes.. It just didn't have the fire like Champion and Glamazon.. Glamazon is beyond incredible, that album is everything..\n\nYES to what Mikey said: I too want twelve versions of Sissy That Walk on this album. It stands as one of the best singles of 2014.\n\nSeriously, it is that good. Hollywood USA has been massacred for the new Covergurls album, which is a shame because that's my favourite RuPaul track.\n\nThe only noteworthy bop from either CoverGurlz album is Adore's take on Superstar (Courtney's Champion is alright..... but it's Courtney fucking Act). Tempest DuJour has butchered Sissy That Walk- so naturally I already hate her.\n\nHere's hoping that Ru has done another duet with her holiness Queen Visage. Let The Music play was a fabulous moment. Give me that confessional duet that I love.\n\nI'm so ready for this. Responsitrannity and Sissy That Walk are among the greatest songs ever recorded.\n\nBut does this mean the single that goes along with S7 will be from this album, not Born Naked? I fully expected Dance With U to destroy lives this season.\n\nI'm so ready for this. Responsitrannity and Sissy That Walk are among the greatest songs ever recorded.\n\nBut does this mean the single that goes along with S7 will be from this album, not Born Naked? I fully expected Dance With U to destroy lives this season.\n\nI was ready to get my life to Dance With U as well. It was meant for the runway segment. Not Ru paying it dust!!\n\nHere's hoping that Ru has done another duet with her holiness Queen Visage. Let The Music play was a fabulous moment. Give me that confessional duet that I love.\n\nFrom the Billboard interview:\n\n[Michelle] and I have another song on my album, the Realness album, and it's a lot of fun too.\n\nThis can only be amazing.\n\nI'm so ready for this. Responsitrannity and Sissy That Walk are among the greatest songs ever recorded.\n\nBut does this mean the single that goes along with S7 will be from this album, not Born Naked? I fully expected Dance With U to destroy lives this season.\n\nGlamazon was released whilst season 3 aired (even using Superstar for a main challenge), yet they still did Champion as the final video challenge so who knows.\n\nAnd good. I didn't feel Born Naked was strong enough to carry a few seasons on its own. It had a few OK songs and two great ones but not enough for more than 2 series runways and video challenges."
