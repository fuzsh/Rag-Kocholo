        "text": "When I was younger and just coming out, I depended on music to express my emotions. It often feels like few words can convey what individual and shared LGBTQ experiences are like, and many people — like myself — have looked to music for help. From Melissa Etheridge to Lady Gaga to Troye Sivan, we've long turned to both ballads and bops to express ourselves.\n\nUnfortunately, mainstream radio often doesn't take the time to curate playlists about our community. Though a song doesn't have to be expressly about a queer relationship to resonate with LGBTQ people — where would we be without Katy Perry's \"Firework,\" for example? – sometimes you just want to hear yourself included in the lyrics.\n\nThis playlist, however, is packed with color and emotion to celebrate our pride. Here are 40 tracks from our favorite LGBTQ musicians and allies — some happy and some reflective, but each about living in our own truth. Whether you're celebrating with family and friends, or just the personal victory of coming out to yourself, we'd like to pass on some of what our community has created over the years in the hopes that it shines a little rainbow into your day. You never know just what song is going to be the one that becomes your soundtrack. And remember, lip-syncing and booty shaking are always encouraged.\n\n1. ”Wut” by L1ef\n\nComing out can feel like a lot of things; some people burst forward and stomp down the runway of life and some have a bit more trouble flaunting their fabulous self. If you ever get caught feeling like a shrinking violet, pop your headphones in and let L1ef help you stomp it out like a sexy Pikachu (wait, what?).\n\n2. ”Q.U.E.E.N.” by Janelle Monae featuring Erykah Badu\n\nOur families can sometimes struggle to understand our LGBTQ identities, but let the Scissor Sisters boil it down for you: When you show them just how much happier you are being open with them, they’ll hopefully be glad to embrace you for the whole of who you are.\n\n5. ”Beautiful” by Christina Aguilera\n\nNo list of queer anthems is complete without Christina Aguilera’s best ballad, a swell of piano, vocals, and strings expressing just how beautiful each of us are because of our differences, not in spite of them.\n\n6. ”Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen\n\nThis is probably one of the most gorgeous songs ever recorded and it just happens to be an epic journey of a man discovering his queerness. Nobody has ever been able to match what Freddie Mercury was able to lay down vocally and we’ve never met anyone able to resist this track’s charms.\n\nThough not explicitly about queer experiences, this track has certainly found its place in the pantheon of LGBTQ pop smashes. The queer community is nothing if not infinitely strong.\n\n10. ”I Am What I Am” by Gloria Gaynor\n\nOriginally from the musical Les Cage Aux Folles, this Gloria Gaynor cover became a crossover hit. (In the show, it is performed by Albin, a drag queen and gay parent, who is thankful for his queerness and refuses to hide any facet of himself.)\n\n11. ”Proud” by Heather Small\n\nSmall’s legendary declaration of pride was iconically used in the pilot for Queer as Folk and has comforted many LGBTQ people since. Its lyrics and composition are both a throwback and endlessly contemporary.\n\nThe boy from Oz himself, Peter Allen, takes us to Rio in this playful song about bisexual urges and new love. Just the right amount of innuendo and sass adds to the fun piano-playfulness Allen is known for.\n\n19. ”I Love The Nightlife” by Alicia Bridges\n\nDon’t lie, you’ve never been to a wedding where this track wasn’t played. Now that LGBTQ people can get married, too — at least in America — this camp disco beat will finally find its way into its audience’s own nuptial bashes.\n\n20. ”Smalltown Boy” by Bronksi Beat\n\nThis track by Bronksi Beat is the kind of universal story many LGBTQ kids can relate to: of someone who is stuck in a small town, and tries to find their own tribe. That this song found a massive audience in 1984 is just proof of its emotional punch.\n\nAnother track about bisexuality from Peter Allen that found massive success within the ‘70s and ‘80s. Allen’s quintessentially queer style meets with a bit of a beach-y flavor that can bring you a little sunshine even in the coldest part of winter.\n\n24. ”Girls & Boys” by Blur\n\nWhat would this list be without “Girls & Boys,” one of the most iconic tracks from the ‘90s? If they ever make a movie of our life, please, please, please make sure they put this over a fabulous montage of queerness.\n\n25. ”Bi” by Living Colour\n\nEverybody loves you when you’re bi! Now that is a message we can get behind. This track is (blessedly) explicit about its themes and goals — and even comes with a video packed with LGBTQ subcultures to underline its point.\n\nIs this the most fun you can legally have on a song? We’re not sure, but this certainly does test the limit. It’s a track infused with the kind of queer happiness you could only find in the culture of the ‘90s.\n\n39. ”You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)” by Sylvester\n\nWhen you’re finally out to the world, it can feel exactly like this track sounds (mighty real). Sylvester’s smooth camp aesthetic helps this feel like the kind of daydream we want to always be having.\n\n40. ”Raise Your Glass” by P!nk\n\nOnce you’ve gotten through the storm of the first parts of the coming out process, it’s time to celebrate. So do as P!nk says and raise your glass to all the dirty little freaks who make this world such a colorful and unique place to be."
