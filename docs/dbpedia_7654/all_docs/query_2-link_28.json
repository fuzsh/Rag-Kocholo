        "text": "Dan Pashman: This episode contains mature subject matter.\n\nDan Pashman: Who is Bessie Smith addressing when she sings about her jelly roll?\n\nCourtney Thorsson: Anyone who she’s attracted to, male or female. As she puts it, \"Nobody can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine\", so she’s using this kinda domestic, feminized metaphor of baking a cake, right, for her sexual desirability and skill, I like a lot.\n\n[DESTINY’S CHILD “BOOTYLICIOUS”]\n\n[“MUST BE JELLY CAUSE JAM DON’T SHAKE LIKE THAT”]\n\n[PUBLIC ENEMY “CAN”T DO NUTTIN” FOR YA MAN”]\n\n[THE FLAMING LIPS “SHE DON’T USE JELLY”]\n\n[GALANTIS “PEANUT BUTTER JELLY”]\n\nMUSIC\n\nDan Pashman: This is The Sporkful, it’s not for foodies it’s for eaters, I’m Dan Pashman. Each week on our show we obsess about food to learn more about people. Today’s show is all about a food that has a long and important history in music: Jelly.\n\n[GALANTIS “PEANUT BUTTER JELLY”]\n\nDan Pashman: Why jelly? Well it is a fun and delicious food, but more importantly, as you’ll hear, jelly has been referenced in tons of songs across decades and genres, often with special significance in the Black community. When it comes to jelly and music, there’s a lot to talk about.\n\nDan Pashman: So, let’s start with some ground rules. We’re talking today about songs that reference jelly the food, or that use jelly the food as a metaphor. Which means ...we’re not talking about this song…\n\n[VAN MORRISON “AND IT STONED ME”]\n\nDan Pashman: Because Van Morrison is only referencing the great jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. And we will not be discussing this song:\n\n[THE MOUNTAIN GOAT “JAM EATER BLUES”]\n\nDan Pashman: Or this song …\n\n[PATTI LABELLE “LADY MARMALADE”]\n\nDan Pashman: This of course is \"Lady Marmalade\", but we aren’t talking about marmalade, or marmalade, or jam. We’re talking about jelly!\n\nDan Pashman: You know, they’re all made by cooking fruit with sugar, they’re all thickened by the natural pectin in the fruits, and often by adding additional pectin, which is a carbohydrate found in plants.\n\nDan Pashman: The difference between jam, jelly, and the like is mostly in how big the pieces of fruit are that you leave in there. Preserves have large pieces of fruit, or the whole fruits. Jam has pieces of fruit chopped or crushed or pureed in. Marmalade is typically made from citrus and has peels in it.\n\nDan Pashman: But to make jelly, you cook the fruit with sugar and then strain out all the fruit. The hallmark of jelly is that it is transparent. And the hallmark of a song about jelly is that it refers to that very specific, no bits or pieces, almost-see-through-it spread.\n\n[CAROLINA CHOCOLATE DROPS “YOUR BABY AIN’T SWEET LIKE MINE”]\n\n[BOB MARLEY “GUAVA JELLY”]\n\nDan Pashman: So today we’re looking at the jelly musical canon, but we’re not just looking at it: by the end of the episode, we’re going to contribute our own song to it. Yes, an original Sporkful composition. But for that, we need some help.\n\nDan Pashman: Hey, John.\n\nJohn DeLore: Hi, Dan.\n\nDan Pashman: Can you just like introduce yourself to Sporkful listeners, like what's your title. How do you want to be identified?\n\nJohn DeLore: My name is the Reverend John DeLore.\n\nDan Pashman: John DeLore is an extremely talented audio producer, editor, and engineer. He and I have been colleagues at a few different audio companies over the years. He’s also a musician …\n\nDan Pashman: That's like that's where you're the Reverend John DeLore you record under the name the Reverend John DeLore.\n\nJohn DeLore: That’s correct.\n\nDan Pashman: And you write music.\n\nJohn DeLore: Mm-hmm.\n\nDan Pashman: You understand melody ...\n\nJohn DeLore: Mm-hmm.\n\nDan Pashman: Tempo.\n\nJohn DeLore: Correct.\n\nDan Pashman: Harmony?\n\nJohn DeLore: Yes.\n\nDan Pashman: Here's what's going on John. All right?\n\nJohn DeLore: [LAUGHING]\n\nDan Pashman: We're doing a Sporkful episode where we take a food that has been referenced in many songs ...\n\nJohn DeLore: Okay.\n\nDan Pashman: Across many genres in many years.\n\nJohn DeLore: Okay.\n\nDan Pashman: And then we want the whole episode to culminate with an original song about the food.\n\nJohn DeLore: Hmm. Hmm, Hm, hm. So you want me to ask one of my friends to write it?\n\nDan Pashman: [LAUGHING]\n\nJohn DeLore: Before I say yes to this, Dan, I think it's important that I find out what the food item is.\n\nDan Pashman: Right, because you're an artist.\n\nJohn DeLore: Right. I don't just give my work away or to say yes to anything.\n\nDan Pashman: No, I understand. You have very high standards.\n\nDan Pashman: Okay. All right. You ready?\n\nJohn DeLore: Mm-hmm.\n\nDan Pashman: The food ... is ... jelly.\n\nJohn DeLore: Mmm.\n\nDan Pashman: John begrudgingly says yes to the assignment, so we leave him to it. Now it’s time for us to look at the history of jelly in music. Most of the well known jelly songs got popular because they’re performed by famous singers or bands. But there’s one jelly-related track that took a different path to stardom.\n\nDan Pashman: And that song? Well, there’s a bit of a story to that one.\n\nDan Pashman: Kevin describe yourself in college.\n\nKevin Flynn: Myself in college…. You know, it's funny, I was actually fairly shy\n\nDan Pashman: Like many a young introvert, Kevin Flynn spent a lot of his time online.\n\nKevin Flynn: It was a group of online friends and we were in this you know old I.R.C. channel. And this guy simply had this thing on his hard drive forever.\n\nDan Pashman: It was a song.\n\nKevin Flynn: He's like You know this funny weird old song. So I think that if I think back I believe the earliest I've heard it was probably 1996.\n\nDan Pashman: And that's like in an Internet chat room.\n\nKevin Flynn: Exactly, yeah. It was in an Internet chat room.\n\nDan Pashman: Were you like using Prodigy or AOL to access this chat room? Like was it a dial up connection? r\n\nKevin Flynn: Yeah, a Prodigy member. Dial up on Prodigy?\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nDan Pashman: So we're talking like a stone age. Internet stone ages.\n\nKevin Flynn: Oh yeah. And you know I specifically remember it took me like two and a half hours to download the song.\n\nDan Pashman: [LAUGHS]\n\nDan Pashman: A few years later, Kevin was in college. It was 1 or 2 in the morning and he was very drunk.\n\nKevin Flynn: I remember it perfectly and I don't know how, because like I said I was blitzed. I was in my little studio apartment over by San Diego State. I was sitting at my desk which was overlooking a little courtyard, drinking, you know laughing with friends and I found you know the old .mp3 I loaded it up and I just thought, let's let's do something funny with this.\n\n[DJ CHIPMAN AND THE BUCKWHEAT BOYZ “ PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME”]\n\nKevin Flynn: It was literally I'm gonna make this banana dance to the theme of this awful song and it almost just came together where the first half, it went exactly along with the beat of the music.\n\n[DJ CHIPMAN AND THE BUCKWHEAT BOYZ “ PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME”]\n\nKevin Flynn: And it was literally just throwing that together in flash you know with the cheesy pixelated graphics and the cheesy pixelated banner and that was kind of it. You know, this wasn't like a Mona Lisa creation. This was like an hour.\n\nDan Pashman: Kevin took his low fi video of a banana dancing to an inane song about peanut butter and jelly, threw it on a couple of message boards for laughs, and went to bed.\n\n[DJ CHIPMAN AND THE BUCKWHEAT BOYZ “ PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME”]\n\nKevin Flynn: Like two or three days later AT&T actually called and I still remember they basically were like, \"What in the hell are you doing. You guys have moved like two and a half terabytes of data in the past 24 hours. What is going on?\"\n\nDan Pashman: We’re talking two and a half terabytes in 2001! My whole computer back then had 850 MB of memory.\n\nKevin Flynn: I think at the time they thought we were like pirating something.\n\nDan Pashman: Pretty quickly, the viral hit got out of hand.\n\nKevin Flynn: I went through it. It was chaotic. It was crazy. You know, it was kind of fun. It was also kind of annoying, you know, just people contacting you 24/7. You know people finding your phone number.\n\nDan Pashman: At the time, Kevin was chatting with an online crush, a San Diego State classmate he hadn’t met in person. They started talking before the viral video, and she watched everything unfold.\n\nKevin Flynn: She was kind of in the same boat which is, what in the hell? Like what is this thing? And you know, I think she definitely helped me, where I'm like, I don't now what's going on. And then I would say probably within a year of it becoming popular, we ended up meeting.\n\nDan Pashman: Meanwhile, the dancing banana’s fame kept growing. It was featured on an NBC show called Ed. Then the FOX show Family Guy wanted to use it. FOX needed the rights to the song as well as the dancing banana, so they reached out to the original group that made \"Peanut Butter Jelly Time\" back in the 90’s, DJ Chipman and the Buckwheat Boyz.\n\nDan Pashman: The track didn’t get a lot of love when it was first released, and by this time the group had broken up. At least one band member had passed away. FOX called all over Florida, where the group was based, and they finally found the guy with the rights to the song.\n\nKevin Flynn: This guy said, “I don’t give an F what you do with that effing song. And hung up on them.”\n\nDan Pashman: [LAUGHS]\n\n[FAMILY GUY CLIP]\n\nCLIP (BRIAN): Aw, don't feel bad, Peter. Hey, I know what'll cheer you up.\n\nCLIP (PETER): I don't think I'm in the mood.\n\nCLIP (BRIAN): Are you sure?\n\nCLIP (BRIAN): [SINGS “PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME”]\n\nCLIP (PETER): Sorry, Brian. It's just not doing it today.\n\nDan Pashman: Today, Time Magazine estimates that Kevin’s video has been viewed a billion times. It’s one of the most widely circulated internet memes in history. Kevin only ever made money off the licensing deal with Family Guy. But he’s gone on to a successful career making video games. His license plate reads: PBJ TIME.\n\nDan Pashman: Why a banana?\n\nKevin Flynn: I just thought it was funny.\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nKevin Flynn: It's just kind of — it's kind of went, you know? You know the irony is I hate bananas.\n\nDan Pashman: Really?\n\nKevin: I truly do. I hate the smell of banana. [LAUGHS]\n\nDan Pashman: How do you feel about peanut butter and jelly?\n\nKevin Flynn: I am a fan. I'm a big peanut butter and jelly fan.\n\nDan Pashman: How do you like peanut butter and jelly?\n\nKevin Flynn: I like it chunky.\n\nDan Pashman: Chunky. And how do you layer the ingredients?\n\nKevin Flynn: Usually, one side peanut butter the other side jelly and you just kind of mash the ingredients together.\n\nDan Pashman: Which side up?\n\nKevin: Peanut butter.\n\nDan Pashman: Why?\n\nKevin: I don't know. Is there a right way?\n\nDan Pashman: Funny you should ask …\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nDan Pashman: I actually argue, Kevin for a thin layer of jelly on top and bottom with peanut butter in the middle.\n\nKevin Flynn: Really?\n\nDan Pashman: You get jelly on the bottom, which lands on your tongue, it accentuates the sweetness without having to add too much sugar. But also jelly on top which coats the roof of your mouth so that the peanut butter doesn't stick to it.\n\nKevin Flynn: Interesting. I'll have to try that.\n\nDan Pashman: There is one last part of Kevin’s story. Remember that college crush, the one he met online, who helped him keep it together when the PBJ Time video was blowing up?\n\nKevin Flynn: We started dating and then, you know, we ended up married. And we’ve been married for coming up on 13 years. We did Halloween at my house this year and I — you know I park my car out front, so obviously you know the license plate on the car is \"PBJ TIME\". And I kid you not. We had twenty five kids that came to the door that started singing \"Peanut Butter Jelly Time\" as soon as we opened the door. And you know, because apparently you know obviously they saw the license plate and then word spread through the school that, oh this is a peanut butter jelly time guy. And it's just is shocking to me, you know, these 10, 12, you know, 13-year-olds still know it and still are entertained by it.\n\nDan Pashman: So Kevin we're doing this episode. It's really all about jelly.\n\nKevin Flynn: Yes.\n\nDan Pashman: And we are ending this episode with an original musical composition that as of the conversation you and I are having right now, has not been written.\n\nKevin Flynn: I'm excited.\n\nDan Pashman: So help us out. Kevin give us a lyric, a jelly related lyric that we need to incorporate into our song.\n\nKevin Flynn: Oh my God. Can we talk about your new invention?\n\nDan Pashman: Okay, so you want to reference to to jelly on the bottom and jelly on the top, double jelly.\n\nKevin Flynn: I do. I think double jelly is the way to go. I think — I'm fascinated by this. I'm actually — I'm gonna tell my wife as soon as I'm done here. Let's try this for lunch, I wanna try this double jelly.\n\nDan Pashman: [LAUGHS]\n\nKevin FLynn: I'm scared and I'm fascinated by it.\n\nDan Pashman: All right. If meme comes out of this I get a cut, Kevin, just so we're clear.\n\nKevin Flynn: Okay. All right.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\n[DJ CHIPMAN AND THE BUCKWHEAT BOYZ “ PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME”]\n\nDan Pashman: So you get the idea of what we’re doing here. And yes, there are still a lot of jelly references in music we still have to cover.\n\nDan Pashman: But meanwhile, we need a song of our own. Kevin gave us the lyric “double jelly.” But that’s a far cry from a song. We need a lot more than that.\n\nDan Pashman: All right, Anne, Ngofeen, Sporkful producers extraordinaire.\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: What up? [LAUGHS]\n\nDan Pashman: What's wrong?\n\nAnne Saini: I gotta lower that level there.\n\nDan Pashman: Oh. What are you guys bringing to the table here? What can we count on you for? We're putting a band together.\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: I'm bringing some light pipes. [LAUGHING]\n\nDan Pashman: Okay. All right. All right.\n\nAnne Saini: What does that mean?\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: Also, known as singing.\n\nDan Pashman: Okay.\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: La la la la la. [LAUGHS]\n\nDan Pashman: Great. Anne, what can we count on you for?\n\nAnne Saini: Oh, I play a pretty mean rhythm guitar.\n\nDan Pashman: Oh! All right!\n\nAnne Saini: Dating back to things that we will not talk about.\n\nDan Pashman: Didn't you play like a Beatles cover band?\n\nAnne Saini: That's right.\n\nDan Pashman: All right. All right. We're getting the band back together.\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: All in the name of jelly.\n\nDan Pashman: There's just one important thing we've got to do if we can really put this band together and start working on the song. We have to pick a musical genre.\n\nAnne Saini: Mmm.\n\nDan Pashman: So we've had some internal conversations. We've narrowed it down to a list of four genres that we think would be good that we could hope maybe possibly mediocrely really pull off. And it would make it. And we've narrowed it down to four genres that we think we could pull off to a least a only somewhat embarrassing level of quality.\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: Mm-hmm. That's all we need. And that also will make for good songs. Yeah.\n\nAnne Saini: We have high standards.\n\nDan Pashman: So we have ...\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: [LAUGHS]\n\nDan Pashman: I'm writing this down on a piece of paper, pop, disco, bluegrass, showtunes.\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: Mm-hmm. Right.\n\nDan Pashman: So I've written them on piece of paper. And I'm gonna — [RIPPING PAPER] tear them into squares. Again, the options are disco, show tunes, bluegrass Americana, and pop.\n\n[RATTLING SOUND]\n\nDan Pashman: That's the paper ball.\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: Can you shake more vigorously? We really want them to mix.\n\nDan Pashman: Sure.\n\n[SHAKING VIGOROUSLY]\n\nAnne Saini: [LAUGHING]\n\nDan Pashman: All right. Here we go. Here we go. Reach in. Pick it up. Don't open it yet though.\n\n[HAND DRUM ROLL]\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: I've taken it out. I am unfolding the paper.\n\nDan Pashman: All right.\n\n[UNFOLDING PAPER]\n\nAnne Saini: Tension is palpable.\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: [LAUGHS]\n\nAnne Saini: I know what it is.\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: Show tunes.\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nAnne Saini: Oh no! Oh, I wanted disco!\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: [LAUGHING]\n\nAnne Saini: No! Can you draw again?\n\nDan Pashman: Oh man.\n\nNgofeen Mputubwele: Oh man, this is going to be ...\n\nDan Pashman: That is the only one that I was like, no.\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nMUSIC\n\nDan Pashman: Coming up, we call for musical reinforcements. Stick around.\n\n[JAMES TAYLOR ON SESAME STREET “JELLYMAN KELLY”]\n\nMUSIC\n\n+++ BREAK +++\n\nMUSIC\n\nDan Pashman: Welcome back to The Sporkful, I’m Dan Pashman. Hey, in a few weeks I’m moderating a panel at a food festival on Martha’s Vineyard. The whole thing’s called Martha’s Vineyard Flavors. It’s a whole weekend of talks, demonstrations, and delicious meals. And you can buy tickets to just one or a couple parts of the weekend, you don’t have to commit to the whole thing. It’s the first weekend in June, it’s gonna be fun and delicious and if you come, I can promise you'll eat well. So I hope you can be there. Get more info and tickets at MVMuseum.org. We’ll also put a link in the show notes. Thanks.\n\nDan Pashman: Okay, back to our musical odyssey, and I should say, this episode originally aired a few years ago, back when my friend John DeLore, the audio producer and musician, was working at Stitcher. Remember, he said he would help us write and record our song about jelly.\n\nDan Pashman: So I stopped by his desk to check in…\n\nDan Pashman: So John how’s it coming with the song?\n\nJohn DeLore: [LAUGHS] What reaction are you looking to get here? The honest one?\n\nDan Pashman: Yes, the honest one. [LAUGHS]\n\nJohn DeLore: You’re killing me. All right, you spun the wheel, you got show tunes. Okay? Like if you would’ve got something easy like folk or something, it’s like an acoustic guitar and vocal, but now you’re talking about like intense rhyme schemes You're talking about a chorus. You know?\n\nDan Pashman: Do you have anything else you’re working on, John?\n\nJohn DeLore: Yeah, Dan. Lots of things. Do you think I sit around this office waiting for people to ask for musical numbers?\n\nDan Pashman: Clearly, John was excited about our collaboration. So excited in fact that he handed me off to a friend of his.\n\nDan Pashman: So Allison, are you a fan of jelly?\n\nAllison Leyton-Brown: Love it. It’s my jam.\n\nDan Pashman: This is Allison Leyton-Brown, she’s a composer. She played me some initial ideas for how the song could go …\n\n[ALLISON LEYTON-BROWN TRYING OUT THE MUSIC]\n\nAllison Leyton-Brown: [HUMMING] Yeah, that kind of — you know, that feel?\n\n[ALLISON LEYTON-BROWN TRYING OUT THE MUSIC]\n\nAllison Leyton-Brown: Something like that.\n\nDan Pashman: So our jelly song is coming along, but there’s still a lot of work to do. In the meantime, there are more jelly songs to cover. Now, look, we knew when we embarked on this odessy, if we’re gonna do this episode, we have to talk about the 2001 hit by Beyonce’s original group, Destiny’s Child. Of course, I’m talking about \"Bootylicious\" ...\n\n[DESTINY’S CHILD \"BOOTYLICIOUS\"]\n\nDan Pashman: Which I think we can agree is one of the greatest jelly-related songs in history.\n\n[DESTINY’S CHILD \"BOOTYLICIOUS\"]\n\nDan Pashman: I’m sorry, but did you say that you don't like Beyonce?\n\n[RECORD SCRATCH STOP]\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: Ummm… Let me put it like this. I wouldn't pay to go to a concert. You know?\n\nDan Pashman: Got it.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: I don’t turn it off or anything when I hear Beyonce. I’m just not a major fan.\n\nDan Pashman: This is Professor Psyche Williams-Forson, chair of the Department of American Studies at the University of Maryland College Park and Beyonce skeptic.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: You know I'm about 12 years older. I mean, I’m more of a Jill Scott kind of gal, y’know?\n\nDan Pashman: Okay, Professor, we can chalk it up to generational differences and forget this moment ever happened. Now, we will get to Bootylicious. But in order to really understand that song, we first have to go way back to 1938, to one of the early references to jelly in recorded music. This is the Hipp Cats:\n\n[THE HIPP CATS “IT MUST BE JELLY”]\n\nCourtney Thorsson: What interests me about this particular recording, you hear that it's a \"call and response\" between two men talking about woman.\n\n[THE HIPP CATS “IT MUST BE JELLY”]\n\nCourtney Thorsson: So you get the kind of back and forth.\n\nDan Pashman: This is Professor Courtney Thorsson from the University of Oregon, who studies African American literature. She also joined Professor Williams-Forson and me. The two of them, along with three other chefs and professors, wrote a paper about the roles of Black women in food work.\n\nDan Pashman: Now, this back and forth in the song, the \"call and response\", also invokes “The Dozens”, that tradition of going back and forth with burns like, Yo mama jokes, that has a long legacy in Black American culture. But there’s one lyric that really jumps out in this 1938 Hipp Cats song. \"It must be jelly because jam don’t shake that way.\"\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: It doesn't take a lot of leaps to connect that particular metaphor for two Black women's bodies’ robust behinds and posteriors.\n\nDan Pashman: Now, some context here. The Hipp Cats’ track came out just as the Harlem Renaissance drew to a close. During the 1920s and 30s, as Black Americans moved from the south to cities, they faced pressure to be \"respectable\". That pressure to prove their worthiness came from white Americans, but it also came from within the Black community. Black organizations like the National Urban League discouraged Black people from eating certain foods in public, things like fried chicken and watermelon. Because of longstanding stereotypes from white Americans, there was a concern that eating foods by hand would make Black people look backwards, not “respectable”.\n\nCourtney Thorsson: The writers of the Harlem Renaissance are exploring all kinds of avenues of expression, many of which depart quite substantively from politics of respectability.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: Right. And the boundaries of being — I mean Josephine Baker, right?\n\nCourtney Thorsson: Mm-hmm.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: Let's let's be clear. So we have literature, we have music, we have clothing, we have photography.\n\nDan Pashman: And these songs using jelly, they fit into this history. These Black musicians are reclaiming the right to talk about bodies and sexuality as they choose, in the face of that pressure to be respectable.\n\nDan Pashman: And I did not know until I started researching for this episode how Jelly Roll Morton got his nickname.\n\nCourtney Thorsson: Mm-hmm,\n\nDan Pashman: I — if you would ask me I would have said, oh well probably like he was a kid and he loved jelly rolls and as his grandmother said I'm going to nickname you Jelly Roll and it's just you know and it stuck.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: Mm-hmm.\n\nDan Pashman: But am I right that that nickname actually has a very sexual connotation?\n\nCourtney Thorsson: Yes. Are you going to be the one to say it, Dan?\n\nDan Pashman: [laughs]\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nDan Pashman: I will be. Look this is a, you know — sure, yes. I mean, it's a reference to a specific part of a woman's anatomy.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: Mm-hmm.\n\nCourtney Thorsson: And his particular skill at oral sex.\n\nDan Pashman: Okay.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: Mm-hmm.\n\nCourtney Thorsson: That’s the apocryphal, sort of in jazz studies, the apocryphal story, like a legend, is that Jelly Roll Morton was named for his skill at performing oral sex on women.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: Mm-hmm.\n\nDan Pashman: Well, there you go.\n\nDan Pashman: So remember that banjo song I played a bit of earlier with the lyric, “Your baby may roll her jelly fine, nobody’s baby can roll it like mine.” That was one of the examples of jelly being used as a metaphor. In all these winking allusions, Professor Williams-Forson hears more than a clever use of innuendo. She hears people doing something very human, having fun.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: We tend not to think of Black people as willing sexual beings unless they are loose, licentious, over the top, etc. But various forms of sexual expression have been around since the dawn of time. Black people did experience joy.\n\nCourtney Thorsson: Yes.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: Right? Even during enslavement and during the Reconstruction Era and Jim Crow and on up through the through the ages. And so different kinds of play on words and metaphors are reflective of some of that joy. And I think that's an important element that we tend to overlook because we're so busy focusing on the licentious element as opposed to the joyful playful elements of Black lives.\n\nCourtney Thorsson: That’s right. I mean, that is maybe even and especially true for Black women.\n\nMUSIC\n\nDan Pashman: Case in point, the famous blues singer Bessie Smith. She actually uses the jelly metaphor earlier than that 1938 song. This one’s from 1923.\n\n[BESSIE SMITH “NOBODY IN TOWN CAN BAKE A SWEET JELLY ROLL LIKE MINE”]\n\nMUSIC\n\nCourtney Thorsson: But what Smith had done earlier is uses that jelly metaphor not to be the object of men’s talk and gaze but just to assert her own sexual desirability and sexual prowess.\n\nDan Pashman: Who is Bessie smith addressing when she sings about her jelly roll?\n\nCourtney Thorsson: Anyone who she’s attracted to, male or female. As she puts it, \"Nobody can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine,\" so she’s using this kinda domestic, feminized metaphor of baking a cake, right, for her sexual desirability and skill, I like a lot.\n\nDan Pashman: So that’s how jelly was used among Black musicians in the 20s and 30s. Then in the 40s, white musicians started using the metaphor. The most famous example comes from the Glenn Miller Orchestra, they’re an all white big band. You may know their song \"In The Mood\"?\n\n[GLENN MILLER “IN THE MOOD”]\n\nDan Pashman: In 1942 Glenn Miller had a hit with his version of \"It Must Be Jelly Cause Jam Don’t Shake Like That\". But his has a notable difference, it’s got very few lyrics. Earlier versions had lyrics like, “She's got a shape like Venus, pretty as a rose, where she comes from goodness knows.” Glenn Miller’s take just has this...\n\n[GLENN MILLER ORCHESTRA “IT MUST BE JELLY CAUSE JAM DON’T SHAKE LIKE THAT”]\n\nCLIP (GLENN MILLER): “Must be jelly cause jam don't shake like that.\n\nOh, mama, you're so big and fat ... “\n\nCourtney Thorsson: You know whether audiences did receive those very few lyrics as being about sex or not, fat is not necessarily designated as attractive, the way Glenn Miller puts those lyrics.\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: Right.\n\nCourtney Thorsson: It comes across as maybe silly or pejorative. Whereas there is no question that for the Hopp Cats, for Bessie Smith, for Destiny’s Child, that having an ample body is desirable. It’s celebrating a Black woman’s body as sexy and desirable as “Bootylicious”.\n\n[DESTINY”S CHILD “BOOTYLICIOUS”]\n\nDan Pashman: And that brings us back to where we started. 2001, \"Bootylicious\". So what does it mean for Beyonce to sing, \"I don’t think you’re ready for this jelly,\" all those years after Bessie Smith?\n\n[DESTINY”S CHILD “BOOTYLICIOUS”]\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: Any time women go against what is a cultural expectation, There's going to be tensions. So part of for me what what Beyonce is doing, we don't know at that moment that she's about to break out, but she knows it. Right? And she knows that in breaking out on her own, part of what has to be contended with is her body. Right? Because Black women's bodies have been criticized down through the ages. She has an idea of the brand that she's about to create and that's a brand that we haven't seen much of since the likes of Josephine Baker who was equally criticized for having a curvaceous body. So part of what to me Beyonce is doing with Bootylicious is breaking out to say, I'm reclaiming Black women's bodies\n\n[DESTINY”S CHILD “BOOTYLICIOUS”]\n\nPsyche Williams-Forson: She has given so many women, Black women, women of Latina descent, native white women — she's given women the permission to now see themselves on Sports Illustrated and other places and be celebrated for that. And she's done it but she's also following in a long tradition of that having been done.\n\n[DESTINY”S CHILD “BOOTYLICIOUS”]\n\nDan Pashman: So the whole idea of jelly as a stand-in for women's bodies, you can trace it from Bessie Smith to Beyonce. Then, in 2015, the genre took a turn.\n\n[RUPAUL FEAT BIG FREEDIA “PEANUT BUTTER”]\n\nCourtney Thorsson: If Destiny’s Child was taking back jelly as a term for women describing themselves as desirable, what you get in this track \"Peanut Butter\" is RuPaul and Big Freedia are using it to claim desirability for LGBTQIA people.\n\nDan Pashman: There’s more to unpack in this track. It has people playing The Dozens, where RuPaul says, \"Your sister’s on the corner selling peanut butter,\" also, it samples \"Peanut Butter Jelly Time\". And …\n\nCourtney Thorsson: And it also, like the blues, has the south in it. Right? Big Freedia, New Orleans Bounce queen. The original Peanut Butter is a Miami bass group, right? So they're sampling a Miami group, so it brings the south back in really forcefully.\n\n[RUPAUL FEAT. BIG FREEDIA “PEANUT BUTTER\"]\n\nDan Pashman: So Courtney as part of this episode that we're doing on jelly in music, it's used in music, we are going to culminate this episode with an original composition.\n\nCourtney Thorsson: [GASP]\n\nDan Pashman: [LAUGHS] That's right. You heard correctly. So we are in the process of trying to write and record a show tune about jelly. Can you give me a lyric that you would like to hear incorporated into our show tune about jelly? Take as much time as you need.\n\nCourtney Thorsson: Thank you.\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nCourtney Thorsson: A lyric for your show tune. Well, I definitely want the word cake in there, and then I guess we’re going to need to get icing in there, too.\n\nDan Pashman: So cake because a jelly roll is a type of cake. Why icing?\n\nCourtney Thorsson: So RuPaul’s use of peanut butter is, of course, because it’s spreadable. So icing shares that quality. It seems to me that icing is the next frontier in using the cake metaphor.\n\nMUSIC\n\nDan Pashman: That’s Professor Psyche Williams-Forson, chair of the Department of American Studies at the University of Maryland College Park, where she also teaches food studies, and we heard from Professor Courtney Thorsson, from the University of Oregon, whose work focuses on African American literature. Her book is called Women’s Work.\n\nDan Pashman: Now we’re almost ready for the big finale. While John, Allison, Anne, Ngofeen, and I get ready for the big finale, let's listen to another recent entry into the jelly canon. This is Chance the Rapper's 2019 song \"Ballin Flossin.\"\n\n[CHANCE THE RAPPER “BALLIN’ FLOSSIN”]\n\nDan Pashman: All right, John. We're back here in studio. Before we get to the song, that you've been working so hard on, I realized I never asked you, do you eve like jelly?\n\nJohn DeLore: Well, I mean, who doesn't like jelly?\n\nDan Pashman: Well, yeah. I mean, most people like it well enough.\n\nJohn DeLore: Right.\n\nDan Pashman: But I mean, like, maybe some people prefer jam or preserves?\n\nJohn DeLore: No, I mean, if you put it that way, I definitely prefer jelly over jams and preserves.\n\nDan Pashman: But how much do you really love jelly?\n\nMUSIC\n\nJohn DeLore: All I can say, Dan, is … [STARTS SINGING]\n\n“J-E-L-L-Y (The Jelly Song)”\n\nI give a jar of jam the respect it deserves\n\nAnd I save a bit of love for those ol’ fruit preserves\n\nBut my heart will swerve and lift\n\nIf you sift the fruit chunks out\n\nMy soul is uncontrollable...as I spread it all about...\n\nOh, Jelly puts the joy in my joyfullest refrain\n\nFruit and pectin is my jam, I spread it on my pain\n\nThat smooth consistency is the sweetest panacea\n\nCan it be that jelly is the key to keeping sane?\n\nCHORUS:\n\nJ-E-L-L-YYYYY\n\nWhy do I love it just like Romeo loves Juliet?\n\nJ-E-L-L-YYYYY\n\nWhy does it set my heart a-flying like a speeding jet?\n\nJ-E-L-L-YYYYY\n\nWhy does a spread of it on toast or muffin make me sweat?\n\nI’ll tell ya. But I don’t think you’re ready for this jelly yet!\n\nBefore peanut butter came along my jelly was just fine\n\nBut spread that peanut butter and the combo is sublime\n\nThe icing on the cake is the double jelly layers\n\nMake that sandwich mine -- It’s peanut butter jelly time!\n\nCHORUS:\n\nJ-E-L-L-YYYYY\n\nWhy do I love it just like Romeo loves Juliet?\n\nJ-E-L-L-YYYYY\n\nWhy does it set my heart a-flying like a speeding jet?\n\nJ-E-L-L-YYYYY\n\nWhy does a spread of it on toast or muffin make me sweat?\n\nWhy? Because!\n\nJelly is the elemental / essence of a fruit condensed /\n\nReduced until its effervescence / drives the primal senses senseless\n\nSealed in jars, my patience tested / pop the top and yes you guessed it!\n\nJelly simply can’t be bested\n\nJ-E-L-L-Y\n\nJ-E-L-L-Y\n\nJ….E….L….L….YYYYYYYYYY\n\nJelly can’t be bested!\n\nMUSIC\n\nDan Pashman: So that happened. Yeah, that happened. First of all, I want to thank the Reverend John DeLore and Allison Leyton-Brown for doing such and incredible job on that song. Now, I know what you're thinking.
