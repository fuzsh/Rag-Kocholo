        "text": "Violet Chachki is a drag queen, burlesque performer, aerial silks dancer, model, content creator, and the Season 7 winner of RuPaul's Drag Race.\n\nAfter winning her season, Chachki embarked on a world tour, at which point she became even more famous for her on-stage aerial feats and suspended burlesque performances (often in minimal outfits), her modeling, impeccable fashion sense (and discerning eye for style), as well as working with Dita Von Teese, Prada, Moschino and Vogue, among others.[4]\n\nDrag Name Origin[]\n\nViolet was originally named \"Blair\"; after having watched the 1996 movie Bound, she renamed herself after the film’s sensual, dark character \"Violet\" (Jennifer Tilly). The surname \"Chachki\" is an anglicized or phonetic spelling of tchotchke, a Yiddish word used to name a strictly decorative, small collectible item. Additionally, the word can be used to describe a beautiful young lady; thus, ironically, Violet Chachki can be translated as a \"violet-colored trinket\".[4]\n\nTrack Record(s)[]\n\nStatistics USA Season 7 Ranking: 1st Place\n\n(Winner) Maxi Challenges Won: 3 (Eps. 1, 10, 11) Mini Challenges Won: 1 (Ep. 10) Times as Team Captain: 0 Times in Bottom: 0 Episode Eliminated: N/A\n\nDrag Family[]\n\nViolet has a drag family originally out of Atlanta, Georgia, within which the most notable members are herself, her drag mothers, Genre Monster and Season 8 contestant Dax ExclamationPoint, and her drag sister, Brigitte Bidet.[5]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race[]\n\nInitially unpopular amongst the other Season 7 contestants due to her younger age (22 years in 2014) and perceived “snobbish” attitude, Violet was frequently picked last for team challenges. She showed some uncertainty with acting or comedy challenges, but quickly was viewed as a stunning fashion queen to watch-out for—Violet frequently placed highly (or won) during challenges involving fashion or modeling. Nevertheless, in Episode 2 (\"Glamazonian Airways\") of Season 7, the entire ensemble of queens performed a several-minutes-long musical number, in which she placed in the Top 3; her comedic portrayal of Season 5 contestant Alyssa Edwards during “Snatch Game” (Episode 6) proved that Violet could be entertaining, and improvise jokes and comebacks, despite being unsure of her own comedy prowess at the time.\n\nJust like fellow front-runner Ginger Minj, Violet won three important main challenges (the nude-illusion challenge on Episode 1’s \"Born Naked\"; paired with Katya on Episode 10’s \"Prancing Queens\"; and Episode 11’s Hello! Kitty themed runway, on \"Hello, Kitty Girls!\"). She was the only contestant on Season 7 who never placed in the bottom 2, thus she was never required to compete in a lip-sync battle nor was she at-risk of being eliminated. These facts, combined with her eye-catching looks, dry wit and unshakeable confidence, are all what ultimately won Violet Chachki the prize of “America’s Next Drag Superstar”. Her fellow Top Three runner-ups were Pearl and Ginger Minj. Chachki’s win was the series’ seventh crowning of a queen (Episode 14, \"Reunited\"), or the eighth, when considering Chad Michaels’ crowning win on the premiere season of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars (2012).\n\nMemorable Quotes[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 7[]\n\n\"Ooh la la la la-la-la-la la.\" (entrance quote)\n\n\"I am a one-of-a-kind collectible.\"\n\n\"I've seen Miss Fame's work.

For example, in 2013, when explicit photos of her were shown on Atlanta's \"Legendary Children\" photo exhibition.[4]\n\nSeason 10 winner Aquaria and her were the first drag queens to ever walk Met Gala’s red carpet.[4]\n\nThere's a rumor she stole Season 4 winner Sharon Needles crown.[11]\n\nShe later confirmed that while she was not the one who stole it, she did take photos with it.[12]\n\nPrior to Season 7, she worked in a pizzeria, as well as a dominatrix, while doing drag in a way that secured her a few titles in Atlanta, Georgia.[13]\n\nThe suitcase she was carrying during Season 7 Episode 2's \"Jet Set Eleganza\" runway was packed full of dildos and fetish gear. She intended to have it all bust out at the end of the runway but got axed last minute because it was a shortened runway sequence.[14]\n\nLike Roxxxy Andrews on Season 5, she had the longest gap between Maxi Challenge wins, both taking 9 competitive episodes to win their second challenge.\n\nThis was later broken by Season 15 contestant, Anetra, who took 10 competitive episodes to achieve their second win.\n\nShe was the first regular season winner to win 2 consecutive challenges.\n\nShe was followed by Jaida Essence Hall in Season 12.\n\nShe was the first regular season winner to have a shared win (with Katya)\n\nShe was followed by Bob The Drag Queen, Sasha Velour, Yvie Oddly and Symone.\n\nCoincedentally, she shared her win with the winner of her season's Miss Congeniality.\n\nFellow Season 7 contestant Max and her were the first contestants to impersonate alumni on \"Snatch Game\". She portrayed Alyssa Edwards from Season 5 and All Stars 2, even though her original plan was to play the fashion designer Donatella Versace.\n\nShe's the 2nd youngest Season 7 contestant, being only 11 days older than the youngest, Max.\n\nHer statistics throughout Season 7 are very similar to Aquaria's. She was safe from 4 and Aquaria for 5 challenges, both never landed in the Bottom 2, were at the Bottom 3 twice, won 3 challenges, won the ball challenge, won the last challenge, and were crowned \"America’s Next Drag Superstar\" at the age 22, being the 2nd youngest winners after Season 2 winner Tyra Sanchez, who won at the age of 21.\n\nViolet learned drag makeup from Miss Fame's YouTube videos.[12]\n\nAccording to fellow castmate Trixie Mattel, Violet was an alternate for Season 7 and only added to the cast due to a queen dropping out, similar to Season 12 winner Jaida Essence Hall.[15]\n\nViolet hit 2 million followers on Instagram on August 3, 2021.\n\nShe is the 3rd season 7 queen to hit 2 million followers after Katya and Trixie Mattel.\n\nViolet has a Podcast With Gottmik called No Gorge.\n\nViolet said that they brought another look for the \"Ugliest Dress Ever\" category but choose not wear because it \"because is just not ugly enough!\".[16]\n\nGallery[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 7[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 7 Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 8[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 8 Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race Season 2[]\n\nRuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race Season 2 Looks[]\n\nWerq The World Live[]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nEPs[]\n\nGagged (Tracklist: 1. \"Bettie\"; 2. \"Harlequin\"; 3. \"La Petite Mort\"; 4. \"Vanguard\"; 5. \"Show Off\").
