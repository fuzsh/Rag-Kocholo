        "text": "RuPaul Music\n\nRuPaul Charles\n\nWest Hollywood\n\nRuPaul Andre Charles (born November 17, 1960), best known as simply RuPaul, is an American actor, drag queen, model, author, and singer-songwriter, who first became widely known in the 1990s when he appeared in a wide variety of television programs, films, and musical albums. Previously, he was a fixture on the Atlanta and New York City club scenes during the 1980s and early 90s. RuPaul has on occasion performed as a man in a number of roles, usually billed as RuPaul Charles. RuPaul is noted among famous drag queens for his indifference towards the gender-specific pronouns used to address himâboth \"he\" and \"she\" have been deemed acceptable. \"You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just as long as you call me.\"[2] He hosted a short-running talk show on VH1, and currently hosts reality television shows called RuPaul's Drag Race and RuPaul's Drag U.\n\nRuPaul Musicâs tracks\n\nGlamazon by RuPaul Music\n\npublished on 2012-08-05T19:26:27Z\n\nPeanut Butter (ft.
