        "text": "When RuPaul first hit the mainstream in 1993 with the hit single \"Supermodel (You Better Work),\" it was the culmination of about a decade of work in music — from her time fronting the new wave band Wee Wee Pole to her years working the New York City nightlife scene as a club kid and dancer. \"Supermodel\" pushed RuPaul into the mainstream, giving her the opportunity not only to land cosmetics contracts and present VMAs, but also to get her brand out there.\n\nA talk show and some hosting gigs followed, and in 2009, Logo launched \"RuPaul’s Drag Race,\" a then mostly unheralded reality competition show hosted by the queen herself. Since then, the show has aired more than 200 episodes featuring more than 270 queens. (That’s not even including the girls from the international \"Drag Race\" spin-offs, of which there are many.) RuPaul has also continued her musical career, to date releasing a staggering 15 LPs, six compilation albums, 68 singles, and 42 music videos. In short, RuPaul’s musical cred is bonafide.\n\nThat musical legacy has trickled down to Ru’s TV family, too. Now in its 15th season, \"RuPaul’s Drag Race\" has introduced the world to a generation of incredible drag performers, including more than a few who have made their mark on the musical world. Today, most queens who make it to the end of their \"Drag Race\" season end up releasing a collaborative single as part of the show, like season 13’s \"Lucky\" or \"All-Stars\" season two’s \"Read U Wrote U.\"\n\nSome queens have gone beyond that, dropping solo LPs, fronting bands, and even touring arenas with their music. Here are nine \"Drag Race\" alums whose music has helped launch their second act.\n\nShea Couleé\n\nA stellar queen from Chicago, Shea Couleé first showed up on \"Drag Race\" in season nine, where she came in second behind Sasha Velour. She came back for \"Drag Race All-Stars\" season 5, which she won, and then took another stab at the crown for \"All-Stars\" season 7.\n\nThat season, she was able to showcase her musical talent with a stellar performance of \"Your Name.\" That song, along with a whole slate of other bangers inspired by Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, and Chaka Khan are on her latest record, 8, which she’s touring now. Couleé also will join five other \"Drag Race\" alum on a recently announced U.S. tour.\n\nBob The Drag Queen\n\nA true multi-hyphenate, Bob The Drag Queen is not only \"Drag Race\" season eight winner; he’s also a comedian, podcaster, actor, host and musician. Best known for tracks like \"Purse First,\" which he dropped the same day he won \"Drag Race,\" Bob's latest effort is a great listen, too. The six-song EP Gay Barz is filled with stellar club bangers that mix camp and hip-hop, showcasing Bob's true musical sensibility.\n\nTrixie Mattel\n\nYou can’t talk about musically successful \"Drag Race\" queens without talking about Trixie Mattel. While the \"All-Stars\" 3 winner makes a good portion of her income doing everything from refurbishing a hotel to curating and creating her successful cosmetics line, she still devotes time to her music.\n\nShe’s released four records — all of which are folksier and Fountains Of Wayne-inspired than anything else that’s come out of \"Drag Race\" — touring extensively around each, as well as a number of music videos. Some of her songs, like \"Mama Don’t Make Me Put On The Dress Again,\" can seem a little tongue in cheek, but Mattel backs it all up with legit musical skills, playing both the guitar and the autoharp quite well.\n\nAdore Delano\n\nFans loved Adore Delano on \"Drag Race\" season seven and that ardor only continued after the show. The performer’s musical career really started to take off with 2014’s Till Death Do Us Party, which reached No. 59 on the Billboard 200 chart. Subsequent punky dance records like 2016’s After Party, 2017’s Whatever, and 2021’s Dirty Laundry EP have helped Delano sell out venues around the world.\n\nDelano’s music bops all over the pop landscape, with tracks like \"Hello, I Love You\" merging Katy Perry styling with coyly bubblebum lyrics while the electro-tinged \"I Adore U\" would fit perfectly on a packed nightclub dancefloor.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnother \"Drag Race\" winner with a brazenly brash attitude and a heaping helping of musical talent, Alaska has released four albums, all with fairly spicy names. First came 2015’s Anus, followed by 2016’s Poundcake, 2019’s Vagina, and then 2022’s Red 4 Filth.\n\nAlaska’s singles have always been earworms, too, and she’s brought her \"Drag Race\" sisters along whenever she can. Kandy Muse features on \"Sitting Alone In The VIP,\" while \"Girlz Night,\" which found Rose and Jan dropping in with their girl group Stephanie’s Child. Alaska has even brought her talent to the theater, crafting \"Drag: The Musical,\" which sold out its entire debut run in 2022.\n\nWillam\n\nWillam might be one of the most controversial \"Drag Race\" contestants of all time, earning an early dismissal from season four after RuPaul accused her of breaking the rules behind the scenes. (Willam has since explained that she was getting illicit hotel visits from her husband during taping.)\n\nStill, she had a successful Hollywood career before \"Drag Race,\" with guest spots on numerous television procedurals. She’s only become more notable since, even snagging a speaking part in Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born. Her musical output has always been as sassy and tongue in cheek as she is. Her parody tracks like \"Aileen\" and \"Derrick\" skillfully tread the thin line between musical triumph and well-executed gag. She’s also been a part of two drag supergroups: DWV with Detox and Vicky Vox, and the AAA Girls with Courtney Act and Alaska.\n\nCourtney Act\n\nCourtney Act came to \"Drag Race\" fame after making the season six finale, where she’d ultimately lose to Bianca Del Rio. She’s been singing pretty much her entire career — she actually broke into entertainment by appearing on \"Australian Idol\" in 2003 — but much of her output has come since her \"Drag Race\" debut.\n\nLike her Australian sister Kylie Minogue, Act loves a soaring, inspirational club banger, as evidenced by singles like \"Kaleidoscope\" and \"Fight For Love.\" She released \"To Russia With Love\" in an effort to help shine a light on anti-gay purges in Chechnya.\n\nSince her \"Drag Race\" loss, Courtney Act has appeared on a variety of reality shows in both the UK and Australia, including \"Dancing With The Stars\" and \"Celebrity Big Brother UK,\" the latter of which she won.\n\nKatya\n\nKnown for her oddball humor, out-there drag, and frequent collaborations with Trixie Mattel, Katya came to \"Drag Race\" prominence on season seven before she returned to compete in \"All-Stars\" two. Her drag is half performance piece, half wacked out fashion show, and her drag persona is a sort of cold Russian uber-bitch.\n\nKatya's music follows suit, with much of her 2020 EP Vampire Fitness featuring songs in multiple languages as Katya channeled her favorite Russian nightclub singers. That’s not to say that the tracks don’t rip, though: \"Ding Dong\" is a certified earworm, Russian lyrics and all, while the breathy goth dance cut \"Come To Brazil\" (guest starring Alaska) has racked up over a million views on YouTube.\n\nPriyanka\n\nThe season one winner of \"Drag Race Canada,\" Priyanka charmed fans worldwide with her charming earnestness and musical prowess. After snagging the crown, she released her debut EP, Taste Test, as well as a slate of five music videos in support of the record. The clips combine into a story of super villain-infused murder mystery that culminates in a battle royale between Priyanka and \"Drag Race UK\" contestant Cheryl Hole. The whole thing is as goofy as it is danceable.\n\nFun fact: \"Come Through,\" which is a great and catchy song as its own, also features a guest verse from Priyanka’s \"Drag Race Canada\" sister Lemon. The song has become so beloved among fans that a one-hour mix of just that snippet of the song has almost 750,000 views on YouTube.\n\nListen To GRAMMY.com's Women's History Month 2023 Playlist: Swim In The Divine Feminine With These 40 Songs By Rihanna, SZA, Miley Cyrus, BLACKPINK & More\n\nIt's no secret that Filipinos can unapologetically belt out a song from Celine Dion, Whitney Houston or any pop diva on the mic. But beyond the viral videos of them singing their hearts out in malls or in their homes, the Filipino music scene is vibrantly filled with heart and emotions; and often taken over by powerful soloists like the Philippine pop princess Sarah Geronimo, balladeers like Martin Nievera or Morisette Amon, and acoustic/rock bands like Ben&Ben or Up Dharma Down that often sing about love, heartbreak and life.\n\nWithin the last decade, we've seen an evolution in the Philippine music scene: while solo stars continue to shine, pop groups have begun to take over the spotlight. The concept of pop groups have existed before in Philippine entertainment, however, were usually formed through variety shows or composed of actors and actresses — not necessarily pop idols that you can compare in other Asian music markets like Japan and South Korea.\n\nIt really wasn't until 2018, during the peak of third-generation K-pop, where we saw the beginning of first generation Pinoy pop idol groups. Inspired and influenced by the K-pop idol training system, some P-pop entertainment companies have begun implementing similar systems, or inviting Korean mentors who are active in the industry for any vocal and dance training needed.\n\nTwo of the most notable first-gen P-Pop groups are SB19 and BINI, who are at the forefront of bringing P-pop to a global audience. Five-piece boy band SB19 became the first Southeast Asian group to be nominated for a Billboard Music Award in 2021, and their 2023 single \"GENTO\" was approved for GRAMMY consideration last year. Meanwhile, eight-piece girl group BINI have earned the title as the Nation's Girl Group after a string of successful viral hits including \"Salamin, Salamin\" and \"Pantropiko\"; just this year, they made history as the first P-pop act to perform at KCON in Los Angeles.\n\nOf course, the P-pop universe wouldn't be complete without solo acts. P-pop fans love to celebrate the timeless discography of Sarah Geronimo or gush over Asia's pop heartthrob Darren Espanto, and there's always new individual talent proving that the scene is still thriving.\n\nAs major P-pop stars continue to make waves, there's tons of blossoming acts who are helping to raise the Filipino flag in the global music scene. In light of the bright future ahead, here are a mix of P-Pop groups and soloists you should check out.\n\nALAMAT\n\nIf the actual country of the Philippines were a pop group, it would be ALAMAT. The six member group — composed of Taneo, Mo, Jao, Tomas, R-ji, and Alas — under Viva Records values Filipino culture in their concepts.\n\nEach member hails from different regions of the Philippines and also speak different dialects from their respective regions. Using dialects and culture to their advantage, ALAMAT often incorporates traditional folk dances, instruments, and lyrics in their native languages; and blends them into the modern sounds of hip-hop, R&B and dance.\n\nBGYO\n\nFormed in 2018 and officially making their debut under Star Music in 2021 with \"The Light,\" the quintet composed of Gelo, Akira, JL, Mikki, and Nate are known as the \"Aces of P-Pop.\" The name BGYO even celebrates their heritage, as it's an acronym for \"Becoming the change, Going further, You and I, Originally Filipino.\"\n\nOften fusing pop sounds with R&B, the boy group isn't afraid to get quirky with their concepts — whether they're singing a ballad in suits or wearing vibrant oversized ones. As a result, their music is helping BGYO score big wins: Their single \"The Baddest\" made them the first Filipino act to top Billboard's Next Big Sound chart in 2021, followed by P-Pop Group of the Year at the TikTok Awards Philippines in 2022.\n\nKAIA\n\nDebuting under SB19's former label, ShowBT Philippines, KAIA is composed of members Angela, Charlotte, Sophia, Alexa, and Charice. The quintet officially made their debut in 2022 with their lead single \"BLAH BLAH\" — a powerful EDM-pop track that can be considered for your gaming playlist.\n\nThe name KAIA is a double entendre: a Cebuano word \"kinaiya\" meaning one's self and personality; and the Tagalog word \"kaya\" which roughly translates \"to be able to\" or \"can do.\" In other words, a P-pop girl group that can give you the extra boost when you need that sonic encouragement on the daily.\n\nInigo Pascual\n\nOne of the Philippine heartthrobs, Inigo Pascual is a suave and smooth pop soloist who aims to make you swoon with his R&B-pop serenades. His pop-doowop hit \"Dahil Sa'Yo\" off his solo debut of the same name became the first song to top the Billboard Philippines Top 20 chart in 2016.\n\nRight from his debut, the actor and singer/songwriter continued to soar in his career when he released his international single \"Options\" in 2019. Just last month, the chart-topping singer unveiled his latest project, Basta't Alam Kong Tayo 1, a three-track single-album under Republic Records Philippines.\n\nG22\n\nIf you already listen to K-pop, then you are familiar with the girl crush concept where the sounds are bass-heavy and the looks are all about dark outfits with smokey makeup. If that's up your alley, then check out G22.\n\nUnder Cornerstone Entertainment, the former quartet-turned-trio composed of members AJ, Alfea, and Jaz are known to be the \"Female Alphas of Philippine Pop.\" The trio officially made their debut in April 2022 with their first single \"BANG!\" which was then followed by their second single \"Babalik!\" in May. But don't be fooled by their powerful demeanors — the trio also has a light and soft side to themselves in their B-sides and singles too.\n\nVXON\n\nIf G22 is dubbed as the \"Female Alphas of Philippine Pop,\" then VXON are said to be the \"Monsters of P-pop\" — so don't be fooled by the pretty boy looks VXON may carry. They are a P-pop group that can balance bubblegum pop with beast-like concepts, as if you're watching the transformation of boys to men. But at their core, they're making music to capture your heart (see for yourself with their viral R&B hit \"Sandal\").\n\nMaking their official debut in January 2022, the group consists of five members: C13, Franz, Patrick, Vince and Sam. After a big first year — they won Favorite Rookie P-Pop Group at Nylon Manila's Big, Bold, and Brave Awards in 2022 — VXON have continued winning hearts, most recently delivering a series of swoon-worthy live sessions on their YouTube channel.\n\nMaymay Entrata\n\nA multi-talented soloist, Maymay embodies Filipino entertainment, a fun and vibrant breath of fresh air within the Philippine music scene. She takes pride in her Visayan roots and stays grounded from her humble beginnings, even naming and singing her songs in Visaya, Tagalog and English.\n\nFirst known as the season 7 winner of \"Pinoy Big Brother\" in 2016, Maymay has made a name for herself as a musical artist in the last couple of years. Signed under the same label as BINI and BGYO, Maymay is grandiose in her music, presenting a plethora of genres in her discography, from disco to dance pop to a little salsa with visuals that encapsulate inspiration from Filipino culture. \"Her journey is only going further as she teased her first and upcoming international single \"Paradise\" at the 'ASAP Natin 'To in California' concert earlier this month.\"\n\nPLUUS\n\nFormerly known as SBTCBoys, the six-member boy group composed of Theo, Gab, Justin, Yen, Haro, and JL made their debut in 2023 with their first EP +.Y.M. (stylized and read as Time). Steering away from the traditional lead single promotions, PLUUS broke boundaries by promoting three tracks at once with \"Amigo,\" \"My Time\" and \"Cross My Heart\" last year.\n\nThe trio of tracks also displayed PLUUS' wide array of talents: \"Amigo\" is a hip-hop-heavy dance pop track celebrating camaraderie; whereas \"My Time\" follows the personal stories of being an idol; and \"Cross My Heart\" is a love song about letting go. They've continued showing their versatility in 2024, with the airy single \"Universe\" and the thumping track \"Summotion.\"\n\n1st.One\n\n1st.One was already putting themselves on the map, and embodying their name, before they even made their official debut in July 2020; the month before, they became the first Filipino act to perform at the Seoul Music Awards. The six members — Ace, Max, Alpha, J, Joker, Jayson — debuted under the Philippine subsidiary of FirstOne Entertainment in South Korea with their single electronic pop single \"You Are The One (Ttak Maja Nuh).\"\n\nIf you're into the nostalgic sounds of second-gen K-pop, 1st.One may be your seamless transition into P-pop. But just like any other group, they've explored different sounds and concepts; earlier this year, the group switched it up and dropped their R&B slow jam single \"Dito\" that was choreographed by member Max.\n\nDIONE\n\n1st.One's sister group, DIONE (or stylized as D1ONE), also debuted in 2020, carrying that girl crush aesthetic with them. Some members of the group were first introduced as LUNA, a project trainee group under FirstOne Entertainment set to debut. Eventually, the quartet composed of Joyden, DK, Clara, and Ella released their digital single \"BLING BLING\" in April 2022.\n\nUpon their official debut, the quartet's image delivered expensive pop, soundtracking their luxurious, high-fashion looks with EDM-driven pop — somewhat reminiscent of the sounds of second-gen K-pop groups like 2NE1 and After School. Their music is fun, energetic and quite tantalizing.\n\nYARA\n\nFairly new to the game, YARA is oozing with charisma, from their rap flows to their dance moves. Signed under Sony Music Philippines, YARA consists of four members — Gelou, Rocher, Christa, and Kim — who blend rap, hip-hop and pop all together.\n\nDebuting in March 2023, the P-pop girl group released their first single \"Adda\" (short for \"Apat Dapat Dapat Apat\"). Earlier this year, the group revived the old school bubblegum pop song \"Bakit Papa?\" by variety show girl group Sexbomb Girls, and gave it an R&B twist. Their recent track \"Katawan Flow\" sees the group making the dancehall genre their own — hinting that their musical direction will always be unpredictable.\n\nMaki\n\nMaki isn't your typical idol pop singer, but that's exactly what makes him a promising soloist. He seamlessly blends alternative rock and pop together, triggering a listener to get in their feels along the way.\n\nWhen he's not dancing to BINI's \"Cherry On Top,\" you can often find Maki strumming a guitar, questioning various love-related situations. And it seems his approach is working: his latest release, \"Dilaw,\" topped the Billboard Philippines' Hot 100 and Billboard Top Philippines Songs for multiple weeks in July.\n\nCALISTA\n\nOfficially making their debut under Tyronne Escalante Artist Management and Merlion Events Production in 2022, CALISTA is working toward being the next P-pop greats. Carrying more of a girl crush vibe, CALISTA's sounds blend dreamy pop with 808 beats and R&B.\n\nOriginally debuting as a six-member ensemble with the trap-inspired pop single \"Race Car,\" the group has spent the majority of 2024 as a quartet comprised of Anne, Dain, Elle, and Denise. Their latest single \"Let Me Know\" has made its way around TikTok, helping them get one step closer to achieving superstar status.\n\nECLYPSE\n\nOriginally known as YAMA, ECLYPSE is fairly new, but definitely promising, to the P-Pop game. Comprised of six former participants of reality-survival show \"Top Class\" (Lex, Gilly, Dean, Clyde, Gab, Joshuel) and one who was announced as a member on the live-streaming app KUMU (Rave), the group have been forming since 2022 and made their official debut this year under GKD Labels.\n\nWhether they're taking on a light or dark concept, their sounds revolve around the EDM genre — a seamless fit for their tones and voices. If you're a fan of synths, harmonies and falsetto, this may be the group for you.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nSummer may be slowly edging toward fall, but the red-hot streak of this summer's musical output shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThis New Music Friday (Aug. 16), Post Malone goes country with his sixth studio album F-1 Trillion, Meghan Trainor adds four songs (and rearranges the track list) to the deluxe edition of her latest LP Timeless, and global girl group KATSEYE unveil their debut mini-album SIS (SOFT IS STRONG). Plus, Muscadine Bloodline share their fourth full-length The Coastal Plain and Nikka Costa drops Dirty Disco, her first album in eight years.\n\nWhen it comes to singles, there's just as many new songs to explore — from superstar collabs like ROSALÍA and LISA's empowered \"NEW WOMAN\" to the latest releases from Hozier and Peggy Gou.\n\nBelow, dive into eight more new releases from pop and K-pop to rap, rock, country, dance, and more.\n\nLady Gaga & Bruno Mars — \"Die With a Smile\"\n\nLady Gaga and Bruno Mars gave the world just 12 hours notice that they were dropping \"Die With a Smile\" this week, sending Little Monsters and Hooligans alike into a tizzy as they braced themselves for the surprise duet.\n\nMars' sensual vocals lead off the moony, apocalyptic love song, which marks Mars' first release since his GRAMMY-winning work with Anderson .Paak as Silk Sonic. Strumming an electric guitar, the 15-time GRAMMY winner vows, \"I, I just woke from a dream/ Where you and I had to say goodbye/ And I don't know what it all means/ But since I survived, I realized/ Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow.\"\n\nAs for Mother Monster's oeuvre, \"Die With a Smile\" lands somewhere between Joanne and \"Shallow\" as her fans wait impatiently for LG7. Not to be outdone, Gaga takes over on the second verse, supported by Mars' swooning harmonies as the duo crescendo the intensity of their devotion to meet the literal end of the world.\n\nLISA & ROSALÍA — \"NEW WOMAN\"\n\nOn New Music Friday eve, BLACKPINK member LISA added to her blossoming collection of solo bangers with \"NEW WOMAN,\" an empowering shapeshifter of a duet that sees her joining forces with ROSALÍA.\n\n\"Hit it when I serve/ B—, you better swerve/ Revving up my aura/ Focus on my mind/ Taking my time/ I'm a new woman, woman,\" the K-pop star proudly announces on the chorus of the song before Rosalía slams on the brakes to sing and rap her way through a sultry verse in her native Spanish that translates, in part, to \"I was born pure, yes/ Not an era will be a flop in my future/ W—, I'm Rosalía, I only know how to serve.\"\n\nThe accompanying Dave Meyers-directed video is filled with high-fashion looks (thigh-high boots on fire, that massive, floor-sweeping pearl necklace…or is it made of ball bearings?), Y2K nostalgia (flip phones!) and a bevy of quirky, genuinely off-beat moments that will be sure to help drive the conversation as LISA continues to establish herself — and her nascent LLOUD partnership under RCA Records — as a global force in control of her musical destiny.\n\nBenson Boone — \"Pretty Slowly\"\n\nFresh off \"Death Wish Love\" — his folksy contribution to the Twisters soundtrack — Benson Boone uses his newest single \"Pretty Slowly\" to celebrate his sudden rise as one of pop music's shiniest new stars.\n\nThe deceptively upbeat track's lyrics reflect on the dissolution of a relationship lost to all the recent, stratospheric changes in his life as he croons, \"Oh, how come all the best things fall apart/ And it started pretty slowly/ When you asked about the old me/ Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone/ Oh, I don't know/ I think I left him somewhere I no longer go.\"\n\nHowever, the song's accompanying music video acts as a both a victory lap in the wake of his debut album, Fireworks & Rollerblade, from earlier this summer and and energetic peek into the \"Beautiful Things\" breakout's high-octane live show — complete with thousands of ecstatic fans and his signature, onstage backflips.\n\nYG — 'Just Re'd Up 3'\n\nMore than a decade after his 2013 mixtape Just Re'd Up 2, YG adds to the series with the long-awaited Just Re'd Up 3.\n\nThe Compton native has released six other albums and a litany of other mixtapes and collaborative projects in the interim, and his decade-plus in the spotlight allows him to recruit a wide array of contemporaries for the two-disc LP — from Saweetie (\"SHE PRETTY\") and Ty Dolla $ign (\"IT'S GIVIN,\" \"RESCUE ME\") to Tee Grizzley and G Herbo (\"MALIBU\") and Lil Yachty and Babyface Ray (\"STUPID\").\n\nJean Dawson & Lil Yachty — \"Die For Me\"\n\n\"Die For Me,\" Jean Dawson's new collaboration with Lil Yachty, blends the experimental leanings of the L.A.-based polymath (and musical arranger on Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER) with the bubblegum trap rapper's one-of-a-kind flow — and the result is magnetic.\n\nSonically, the swirling track feels like a logical follow-up to Bad Cameo, the \"Poland\" rapper's recent collaborative album with James Blake. After Dawson warbles the hook (\"Don't show up at my funeral/ If you won't die for me\"), Lil Yachty grabs the mic for a blunt-force eulogy that demands repeated listening.\n\nMorgan Wade — 'Obsessed'\n\nMorgan Wade preceded her fourth album, Obsessed, with delicate, heart-on-her-sleeve singles like \"2AM in London\" and \"Time to Love, Time to Kill.\" Arriving almost a year to the day since her previous full-length Psychopath, the country upstart — and occasional Real Housewives of Beverly Hills guest star — is just as vulnerable on the rest of the album.\n\nShowing off her aptitude for laying bare emotional storytelling and heart-crushing nostalgia, Wade cleverly exposes her fragilities and regrets across the album's 14 tracks — whether she's gender-flipping Shakespeare and competing with Romeo on the forbidden \"Juliet,\" finding somber inspiration in fairy tales on the wistful \"Hansel and Gretel,\" or duetting with Kesha on the repentant \"Walked on Water.\"\n\nFalling In Reverse — 'Popular Monster'\n\nSeven years since 2017's Coming Home, Falling In Reverse are back with their fifth studio album, Popular Monster. The LP's rollout has been spread across nearly half a decade, with the title track being released as the lead single way back in November 2019. Six additional singles have followed in the lead-up to the long-awaited project, including collaborations with Tech N9ne and Slaughter to Prevail vocalist Alex Terrible (\"Ronald\") and Jelly Roll (\"All My Life\"), as well as a reimagined cover of Papa Roach's \"Last Resort.\"\n\nAnd while Popular Monster's cover art is plastered with frontman Ronnie Radke's 2012 mugshot for alleged domestic assault, the release is hardly a solo project. In fact, it's the first Falling in Reverse album to feature Max Georgiev on guitar, Tyler Burgess on bass and Luke Holland on drums. (Derek Jones, the band's late rhythm guitarist, also contributed to the title track before his untimely death in 2020 from a subdural hematoma.)\n\nDJ Snake & Fridayy — \"Complicated\"\n\nFridayy is practically begging to keep things simple on \"Complicated,\" his yearning, pulsating new collaboration with DJ Snake. \"Tell me what you want/ Girl, I want to know/ Please don't make it complicated/ We ain't gotta complicate it,\" he repeats over the DJ's hypnotic rhythms filled with Spanish guitar and distant jungle sounds.\n\nEventually, the three-time GRAMMY nominee's desperate pleas morph into an atmospheric echo as DJ Snake's handiwork takes center stage, plunging the track into a spellbinding synth breakdown that dances all the way to the finish.\n\nThe Latest Pop Music News & Releases"
