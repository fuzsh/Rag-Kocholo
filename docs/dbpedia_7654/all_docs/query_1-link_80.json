        "text": "RuPaul Andre Charles (born November 17, 1960) is an American drag queen, television personality, actor, singer, producer, and writer. He produces, hosts, and judges the reality competition series RuPaul's Drag Race and has received several accolades, including 14 Primetime Emmy Awards, three GLAAD Media Awards, a Critics' Choice Television Award, two Billboard Music Awards, and a Tony Award. He has been dubbed the \"Queen of Drag\" and is considered the most commercially successful drag queen in the United States, with Fortune saying that he is \"easily the world's most famous drag queen.\" In 2017, RuPaul was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.\n\nEarly life\n\nRuPaul was born in San Diego, California, on November 17, 1960, the son of Ernestine \"Toni\" (née Fontenette) and Irving Andrew Charles. His parents were both from Louisiana. When his parents divorced in 1967, he and his three sisters lived with their mother. He was raised in the Catholic faith and attended Patrick Henry High school.\n\nAt 15, RuPaul and his sister Renetta moved to study performing arts in Atlanta, Georgia. In the ensuing years, RuPaul struggled as a musician and filmmaker during the 1980s, where he worked at Atlanta's famed Plaza Theatre. In 1982, he debuted on an Atlanta public access variety show called The American Music Show, on which he made frequent appearances over the years. He also participated in underground cinema.\n\nIn the early 1990s, RuPaul worked the Georgia club scene and was known by his full birth name. He appeared for many years at the annual Wigstock drag festival and appeared in the documentary Wigstock: The Movie.\n\nCareer\n\nRuPaul achieved international fame as a drag queen with the release of his debut single, \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\", which was included on his debut studio album Supermodel of the World (1993). The music video was an unexpected success on MTV channels, as grunge and gangsta rap were popular at the time. The song peaked at 45 on the Billboard Hot 100. It charted on the UK Singles Chart, peaking on the top 40 at 39. The song found the most success on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where it peaked at 2. Radio airplay, heavy rotation of the music video on MTV and television appearances on popular programs like The Arsenio Hall Show popularized the song.\n\nHe became a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics in 1994, raising money for the Mac AIDS Fund and becoming the first drag queen to land a major cosmetics campaign. He later received his own talk show on VH1 called The RuPaul Show, which he hosted for over 100 episodes while co-hosting the morning radio show on WKTU with Michelle Visage.\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race was created in 2009 and has gone on to produce fourteen seasons in the United States. The show has also seen success internationally, with several international variants of the show being made, such as RuPaul's Drag Race UK and Canada's Drag Race. This has also inspired several spin-offs of the main show. He is also featured as a host on other reality television series such as Skin Wars, Good Work, and Gay for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul.\n\nIn fall of 2013, RuPaul joined forces with cosmetic manufacturers Colorevolution to launch his debut make-up line featuring ultra-rich pigment cosmetics and a beauty collection. Released alongside the line was a unisex perfume entitled \"Glamazon\". Talking to World of Wonder, RuPaul said: \"Glamazon is for women and men of all ages and preferences who share one thing in common: They are not afraid to be fierce. For me, glamour should be accessible to all, and I am committed to helping the world look and smell more beautiful.\" The line was exclusively sold on the Colorevolution website in various gift sets.\n\nRuPaul has made appearances in films, including Crooklyn (1994), The Brady Bunch Movie (1995), To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995), and But I'm a Cheerleader (1999), as well as television series, including Girlboss (2017), Broad City (2017), and Grace and Frankie (2019). He created and starred in the Netflix original series AJ and the Queen (2020). RuPaul has also published four books: Lettin' It All Hang Out (1995), Workin' It! RuPaul's Guide to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Style (2010), GuRu (2018), and The House of Hidden Meanings (2024). As a recording artist, he has released fifteen studio albums. He received a Tony Award for Best Musical as a producer for the musical A Strange Loop (2019).\n\nFor his work on RuPaul's Drag Race, he has received 12 Primetime Emmy Awards, becoming the most-awarded person of color in the history of the Primetime Emmys. In 2017, he was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world. Outside of film and television, he also continues to write and record music; he has released fourteen studio albums as of 2022, and received a Tony Award for Best Musical as a producer for the musical A Strange Loop.\n\nIn 2023, it was announced that RuPaul would be releasing a memoir, House of Hidden Meanings, through publisher HarperCollins in 2024.\n\nOther ventures\n\nPodcasting\n\nThe podcast RuPaul: What's The Tee? With Michelle Visage debuted on April 6, 2014. Ru-Paul co-hosts with longtime friend and fellow RuPaul's Drag Race judge Michelle Visage. The weekly show features their thoughts on topics including behind-the-scenes of RuPaul's Drag Race, life advice, beauty tips, and conversations with featured guests from the entertainment world.\n\nAudiobooks\n\nIn 2018, RuPaul was one of the actors who voiced the audiobook A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo.\n\nActivism\n\nRuPaul has been an active supporter of voter registration, producing a public service announcement supporting National Voter Registration Day and urging everyone to register.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRuPaul met painter Georges LeBar in 1994 at the Limelight nightclub in New York City. They married in January 2017. The two split their time between a home in Los Angeles and a 60,000-acre (24,000 ha) ranch in Wyoming.\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: RuPaul discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nSupermodel of the World (1993)\n\nFoxy Lady (1996)\n\nHo Ho Ho (1997)\n\nRed Hot (2004)\n\nChampion (2009)\n\nGlamazon (2011)\n\nBorn Naked (2014)\n\nRealness (2015)\n\nSlay Belles (2015)\n\nButch Queen (2016)\n\nAmerican (2017)\n\nChristmas Party (2018)\n\nYou're a Winner, Baby (2020)\n\nMamaru (2022)\n\nBlack Butta (2023)\n\nFilmography\n\nFilms\n\nYear Title Role 1987 RuPaul Is: Starbooty!
