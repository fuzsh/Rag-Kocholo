        "text": "American dormant video game publisher\n\nBAM! Entertainment, Inc. (formerly Bay Area Multimedia, Inc.) was an American video game publisher based in San Jose, California, that was founded by Ray Musci in October 1999.[1] BAM!'s partnership with Cartoon Network in 2000 led to the development of a number of licensed video games featuring Cartoon Network IPs, including The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, and Ed, Edd n Eddy.\n\nA 2001 distribution deal allowed French publisher Ubi Soft to distribute BAM!'s games internationally. BAM! suffered financial turmoil beginning in 2002, during which time the NASDAQ threatened to delist it from the stock exchange. The company sold off their London-based development studio to VIS Entertainment in 2003. BAM! acquired VIS in 2004 but was delisted from the NASDAQ. The company continued to publish licensed games until 2005, when the company went defunct after filing for bankruptcy.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFormation\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican entrepreneur Ray Musci founded Bay Area Multimedia on October 7, 1999.[2][1] The company signed a deal with Takara in April 2000 to localize and publish Transformers: Beast Wars Transmetals for the Nintendo 64 in North America as a rental-only release.[3] The company also signed distribution deals with Virgin Interactive and Victor Interactive Software to distribute Jimmy White's 2: Cueball and Contender 2 for the North American market.\n\nIn 2000, Bay Area Multimedia secured an exclusive licensing deal with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Cartoon Network to publish games based on Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, and Yogi Bear. The company also secured a licensing agreement with Franchise Pictures to publish video games based on their films.[4] A separate licensing agreement with Warner Bros. and DC Comics was also made for the licensing of Sgt. Rock.[5]\n\nExpansion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2000, the company was renamed BAM! Entertainment.[1]\n\nShortly afterward, the company opened an office in the United Kingdom to publish their games in Europe. They soon signed a deal with Ubi Soft in February 2001 for the distribution of BAM!'s games in the entirety of Europe except for the United Kingdom.[6] The company launched their first Palm OS titles Strike it Rich[7] and CardTopia[8] at the end of June 2001. From September onward, the company secured more publishing and licensing deals, including a deal to publish the Game Boy Advance port of Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars on September 17,[9] a licensing agreement with Spyglass Entertainment for a video game based on Reign of Fire on October 9 and 16[10][11]\n\nOn January 8, 2002, BAM! announced that their Cartoon Network partnership would expand to include Samurai Jack[12] and later and Ed, Edd n Eddy. Shortly afterwards, BAM! signed a five-year agreement with Aardman Animations to publish games based on Wallace and Gromit.[13] In February, the company announced a port of Driven as their first GameCube title.[14] and at the end of the month signed a publishing agreement with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe to release World Rally Championship in North America.[15] The SCEE agreement soon expanded to include Wipeout Fusion and Dropship: United Peace Force in March.[16] In June, a deal was made with Riverdeep for video games based on the Carmen Sandiego educational franchise.[17] In November, BAM! signed a publishing deal with Disney Interactive to release two Winnie the Pooh educational titles and My Disney Kitchen for the PlayStation.[18]\n\nFate and bankruptcy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2002, BAM! started to suffer from financial problems, which led to the NASDAQ threatening to delist the company.[19]\n\nIn April 2003, the company's London-based development studio was purchased by VIS Entertainment,[20] however, VIS later announced that the studio would close following the completion of its remaining projects.[21] In the same year, following the expiration of their distribution deal with Ubi Soft, BAM! entered into a new distribution deal with Acclaim Entertainment in August. Unlike the Ubi Soft partnership, the Acclaim deal included all PAL region countries. The deal ended after Acclaim's bankruptcy the following year.[22]\n\nIn 2004, BAM! acquired VIS Entertainment and fellow subsidiary State of Emergency Development. The NASDAQ finally delisted BAM!'s stock in the same year.[23] VIS Entertainment was placed into bankruptcy in April 2005; BAM! then sold the rights to VIS's State of Emergency 2 to DC Studios in May that year and filed for bankruptcy shortly thereafter.[24]\n\nGames\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Platform(s) Developer(s) 2000 Transformers: Beast Wars Transmetals PlayStation Takara Nintendo 64 The Powerpuff Girls: Bad Mojo Jojo Game Boy Color Sennari Interactive Dexter's Laboratory: Robot Rampage Game Boy Color Altron The Powerpuff Girls: Paint the Townsville Green Game Boy Color Sennari Interactive Yogi Bear: Great Balloon Blast Game Boy Color Taito Sgt.
