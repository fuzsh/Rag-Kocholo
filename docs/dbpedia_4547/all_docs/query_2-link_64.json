        "text": "It is a glorious time to be a gamer. In the past 10 years, gaming has grown by leaps and bounds. Not only has it become mainstream, competition has flourished. Top tier tournaments run by publishers now boast prize pools of millions in a bid to attract both participants and viewership. Increasingly, we are also seeing more local tournaments spring up to facilitate the growth of gaming communities to attract new players. While eSports are a great way to encourage the growth of gaming, I think that it only forms one part of the equation.\n\nRelated\n\nWhere gamers came to play\n\nBack in the day, before the rise of home consoles and gaming PCs, arcades were a place where many a gamer got their start. People would gather at their favourite arcade to challenge other regulars and pit their skills against each other to improve themselves. Over time, as the taste of gamers changed, LAN centres also became a place where people would play together. With a stable Internet connection, it was convenient for friends to meet for games such as Counterstrike or Dota without fear of bad ping. In fact, I picked up Dota at a LAN centre myself, with a friend teaching me the basics of the game while we played a game side by side. Arcades and LAN centres formed the basis for the growth of gaming communities, as places to meet new players who shared common interests. However, as console gaming and home gaming become more advanced and much cheaper, along with the development of broadband access, many gamers now choose to play in the comfort of their own homes. Today, we are playing more than ever, but seeing the people we play with less and less.\n\nGetting the fans together\n\nIn March, Blizzard Entertainment hosted a hands-on event for Overwatch in Singapore. The event saw 500 fans in attendance, with some fans even queuing 3 hours before the event’s official start time of 2pm, to snag goodies including an Overwatch t-shirt, backpack and poster. It may not have been a surprise to see this many fans for the event, since the game is still in closed beta, with many gamers not having the chance to try the game themselves. However, what was great to see was the fans chatting among themselves, getting to know each other better and enjoying the game together. Similarly, PlayStation held an event for Street Fighter fans in February, celebrating the launch of Street Fighter V. The event saw pro players Xian, Infiltration and Gackt in attendance, and those who attended had the chance to challenge them. While the attendance of the pro players might have been the draw, a beginners’ tournament on the sidelines also gave newcomers to the scene a chance to try their hand at the game.\n\nRelated\n\nThe community that plays together\n\nEven as we are seeing a resurgence in eSports tournaments worldwide, community events like Overwatch’s and Street Fighter V’s are equally as important. According to a Newzoo report, out of the 259 million people watching eSports, only about 16% of them take part in eSports competition. Not everyone aspires to become pro or to compete; some just enjoy playing the games. That’s why it is heartening to see publishers and gaming platforms running events like these. After all, these events are filling up a role that arcades and LAN centres used to fulfil. Community events provide a safe environment for more casual gamers to join the scene. There will definitely be a fair bit of competition involved, but when competition is not the main focus, it is a more relaxed environment for everyone to have fun. These events also provide a great way to introduce a friend or for the curious public to try out a game. Without the fear of failure, it makes it more accessible to everyone.It also allows players to put a face to a name. You might already enjoy playing with a certain player online; wouldn’t it be a great to meet the person offline as well? Perhaps most importantly, it allows for new community leaders and eSports pros to come onto the scene. Publisher and gaming platform led events will further inspire gamers to facilitate their own gatherings and tournaments, creating an organic growth cycle. After all, games are not built on prize pools. It is built on the gamers that make them great. Here’s looking forward to more community events."
