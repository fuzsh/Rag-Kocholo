        "text": "Sometimes, when we make things for brands, we get so wrapped up in how that we ignore why. Andrew Fatato and Dave Haller put together a beautiful guide (both inside and out) that digs into the latter. Big recc for hacks, newjacks, and anyone else rediscovering how to make things that sing.\n\nOne of the best and strangest career choices I ever made was letting Jeff Inman convince me to take a writing gig at a now- and tragically defunct weekly rag in Las Vegas. If you're a young writer, and you want more stories (both portfolio and life) than you know what to do with, apply for this. (Thanks Mike Prevatt for also letting Jeff convince you)\n\nTL;DR: I built a playable version of my resume in Roblox Studio and you can play it — or watch a playthrough — below. Meat and potatoes: I’m happiest when I make things. Especially fun things. Especially fun things that are historically non fun. Enter the brilliantly titled “Resume: The Game!” In this playable resume, you’ll run through a forested maze, piecing together my past work. At the end, you can embark on a side quest. But more on that later. I designed and coded the world into existence using Roblox Studio, created a series of billboards using the Adobe Creative Suite, and wrote and recorded an original score using GarageBand. A week ago, I had never opened Roblox Studio. Or composed a score in GarageBand. But I think all of that speaks to the work I love doing: Solving problems in the least beige way I can. Below you can watch a playthrough of the resume. But if you play “Resume: The Game!” you’ll be able to seek out a secret hot dog obstacle course I built at the end of the experience.
