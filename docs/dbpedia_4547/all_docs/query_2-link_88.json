        "text": "It's depressing to think about but I wonder how much time is left before Edge eventually goes away. Cause I feel like there's something that can't be substituted by other media in Edge (and print media in general).\n\nOnline publications can be overwhelming because of the sheer quantity of articles with varying qualities from great to terrible.\n\nVideo essays can be good, but sometimes it feels like I'm wasting my time listening to something I can read in much less time.\n\nI feel like we haven't heard bad signs about Edge like we have other magazines. I wonder if the magazine audience (which was previously splintered between different mags) has consolidated around Edge and that means it can be sustainable. I obviously don't know but I'd hate to see it go.\n\nThe future is the wealth of video essays by groups and individuals like MinnMax or Easy Allies, or by those who are with established news organizations like Gene Park and Jason Schreier. There are less and less orgs that want to fund a publication like Game Informer. Such is life.\n\nFor what it is worth, I miss it too.\n\nHonestly, I expect a lot of the video essay market to get eaten by AI content.\n\nWhen people can't tell the difference between the two, it won't matter. There are no protections in place to avoid erosion by AI and if there ever are they will come last to these social media spaces, meanwhile consumers persistently demonstrate that they do not care.\n\nLike I said, I loved that era of magazines, but aside from liking the physical objects, i mostly just like the feeling I had about games and coverage back then - much more innocent, much more fun, much less knowledgeable. It was a manufactured reality like Disneyland.\n\nI agree with pretty much everything Teeth said.\n\nI've got too much to say on this subject to put it all here, but if anyone is interested, I've written at length about the field's current woes: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/starf...urnalisms-orbital-decay-this-week-in-business\n\nAnd about the rose-tinted glasses people wear when looking back at its earlier eras:\n\nDoes the gaming press of old hold up today? | This Week in Business\n\nThis Week in Business is our weekly recap column, a collection of stats and quotes from recent stories presented with a…\n\nIf you want optimism for the future, I believe there will continue to be a place for B2B games journalism directed at people within the industry. I can see why consumers would jump to YouTube and Twitch for coverage that makes the hobby fun/exciting, but I think there is an essential need for coverage of industry issues and business performance that won't be filled by those platforms. The industry's major decision-makers aren't going to sift through a million stories about MCU rumors and Amazon Prime Day deals to find scraps of actual news that let them keep track of industry happenings.\n\nThe problem with the tradition gaming magazine model is that it no longer makes sense in our current internet-based world. Who wants to wait a month to read a review for a new game? You can watch live Twitch gameplay at any time and decide for yourself if you want to play it. There used to be dozens of new games revealed and previewed every month in these magazines. Now we are consistently dripped with these announcements every day. Again, who wants to wait?\n\nThat all said...\n\nI believe that there is still space for a more journalistic approach to the gaming magazine. Exclusive interviews with big developers, behind-the-scenes looks at the development process, rare insight into cancelled projects, etc. I believe there's also a demand for interesting long-form essays that dive into anything from the history of gaming to the oddities of this industry; niche consoles, weird ports, evolutions of genres.\n\nThis space is currently occupied by a handful of high quality YouTubers like Gaming Historian, Ahoy, Noclip, and many others I'm surely forgetting. Give me this kind of content in the form of a high-brow, artistically designed magazine and I would eat it up.\n\nI'm kinda wondering if Retro Gamer or Edge will go first; RG are like those retro Youtube videos that seem like they can go forever, like Sega Lord X or Game Sack on YouTube.\n\nEdge has always been kind of that high-falootin' boutique magazine to me, and I'd think there's always be an audience for that, but then again, it's still as simple as are there enough people buying it. My last issue was in the 320s and as much as I like flipping through 'em, the convenience of free on a screen just outweighed it.\n\nI think the UK print media is a bit different in that the country being smaller probably helps it be less of a black hole in cost.\n\nI think Edge and Retro Gamer have at least something that allows them to stand out. RG being it's more of a niche, targeted magazine, and Edge with its reputation. We have lost a lot of gaming magazines over the years, but the market also used to be quite saturated with magazines trying to go for the same audience, so it's hard to use it to gauge how well any survivors will do.\n\nFWIW Edge actually give you digital versions for free with the print copy subscription these days. They started with that earlier this year iirc.\n\nIt's just the nature of journalism today too unfortunately. I remember reading that the NYT employs 1600 journalists in its newrooms.\n\nThis is actually a bad thing because it means smaller outlets are dying and concentration is going to the big national outlets. It's a defunct monopoly, which is not good for a plurality of views, which is a big part of journalism.\n\nBut the NYT is one of the few newspaper that has convinced folks to pay for it in the digital era, so they have a more sustainable business model.\n\nPeople don't buy local papers anymore. The internet has replaced this, but the internet is ad-drive algorithmic model, which doesn't prize journalistic integrity, but \"clicks\". It's why Trump has sucked the air out of the national discourse, when important topics like education, energy, foreign policy get the ignored for Trump's latest social media gaffe. The former isn't sexy, doesn't carry clicks. But then we're left a more ignorant voting populace as well. One that can't name their representatives or know their local political situation. Yeah, work culture is also to blame here. Lack of time is a big issue.\n\nI think gaming podcasts and on demand video (YouTube documentaries/news focused) are the way to go. Being owned by a major outlet to provide news just doesn't work anymore. Individual startups who have their own YouTube channel/podcasts/vodcasts can find success in varying ways. And they don't have to necessarily answer to the big suits each quarter either. People like \"nakeyjakey\" only put out videos whenever they really have something thoughtful to say. That's another thing: you have more control over the pace you release content. I think a lot of writers who used to write for major gaming magazines/outlets were moving at a pace that wasn't really realistic with today's modern consumption habits.\n\nThe gaming audience has changed and so gaming writers (unfortunately) need to change too. Working for the suits just isn't going to cut it anymore.\n\nLook at \"Maximilian\": he is technically a FGC \"writer\". He makes his on vod content and answers to absolutely no one. He's found great success just by focusing on what he loves about the industry. Justin Wong is also doing the same. I literally watched his success happen in real time over the years. What a success story. Then there's \"Button Check\", \"anime illuminati\"... They all \"write\" for the FGC with their own slant. Not everyone will be able to pivot into this, but I think this is natural evolution to \"real journalism\" in some ways.\n\nI think everything you're saying is correct but I think it's a shame that in this process we are losing out on a degree of \"professionalism\" so to speak. There's a lot value in having writers who were trained to be writers and were forced to adhere to certain journalistic standards.\n\nFor the most part game journalism, publishers have been pretty biased/awful. For every good one they're about more bad ones, now we've moved to more independent resources. I don't necessarily feel, It's a bad thing whatsoever. We still have way more information than we ever were able to get years and years ago, we're not talking about a Nintendo fun club that came every two months that was bias just to Nintendo 35 years ago. It's always been that way though. There's always been some type of deception around ratings, rankings, and everything else coming from higher-ups for journalism publishers. We just have more avenues for information now. You just have to parse through it. Is it perfect no but it's better than it used to be.\n\nAs someone who has been an avid consumer of games journalism in all of its forms for most of my life, I think that there's a bit of revisionist history happening in some of the posts in this thread. There seems to be a sentiment among some that we get just as much quality information and coverage today as we did during the heyday of gaming magazines alongside the assertion that most of the work being done within those publications was of relatively low quality compared to today.\n\nI think the argument could be made that in the early '90s most gaming magazines were largely fan publications without particularly strict journalistic standards that they held themselves to. That's a fair assessment of that time, although it should be said that it was also just plain fun to see all of these different publications with their own style in that era. But I can safely say that we had access to more high quality coverage of the games industry in the late '90s and early 2000s when it comes to gaming publications. At least in my opinion.\n\nBecause at that time we had magazines like EGM, for example, doing some of their best work ever. Issues were still quite thick and packed with content, and the writing staff along with the editorial staff were all very talented and seasoned veterans by that point. Their reviews were very thoughtful and thorough, their previews were honest, and their feature articles were excellent. On top of that this was an era in which we also had tons of websites providing similarly high quality written content in a more timely manner than the magazines could provide, and with that came some of the earliest gaming podcasts as well.\n\nNow, nearly all of that type of coverage both online and otherwise is almost completely gone. Really think about it. How many places do you know of right now that have an actual staff of full-time writers and editors covering the industry and putting out long form content?\n\nRetro Gamer seems to be in pretty rude health. Very small team but a hardcore of loyal subscribers and potentially endless feature ideas. Edge is absolutely knocking it out of the park editorially, and just made it to issue 400. Everything ends eventually, but I have a sense they've got a fair bit in the tank still and they haven't seen massive pagination cuts or wild price hikes that usually signal the death spiral.\n\nI think the broader shift away from journalistic interrogation of this industry and into this weird melding of PR and coverage via streamers, YT is pretty grim. Some amazing essays on YT and real thoughtful people, but I picked up an old issue of NGC a few weeks back and (amid some of-its-time-2000s shit) the things that leapt out at me were 1) the proper independent tone of its news coverage. There was an opening news item completely laying into Nintendo of Europe for a terrible Gamecube launch, while sprinkling in some well-sourced info about where it goes next. And then, 2) the breadth of it. 100+ packed pages every month — beautifully written, funny, on point. As we've seen with pretty much the rest of our culture, the web just does not lend itself to that.\n\nReally think about it. How many places do you know of right now that have an actual staff of full-time writers and editors covering the industry and putting out long form content?\n\nMedia as a whole has declined in large part to instant demand. When audiences had to wait to hear the thoughts from their choice of outlet and that was the standard expectation for all outlets the wait wasn't so damning. Now, if your guy is late, you have 100 voices before him and so you get sucked in by the illusion. Dedicated viewers or readers will wait but most won't. The race to be first has eroded the ability for writers to generate deeper and more thoughtful reviews and discussion about games as whole. Games take so much more time to complete than a movie that rushing for interactions are at a stark contrast to the medium.\n\nI think this is why so many more games get a 10 and then we revise the history, its a shotgun approach when games really don't fit this kind of interpretation.\n\nRetro Gamer seems to be in pretty rude health. Very small team but a hardcore of loyal subscribers and potentially endless feature ideas. Edge is absolutely knocking it out of the park editorially, and just made it to issue 400.

As we've seen with pretty much the rest of our culture, the web just does not lend itself to that.\n\nSide note: I subscribe to Edge, but I also chuck some monthly money at podcasts I think capture some of that games mag spirit i.e. The Back Page and Watch Out for Fireballs. Nathan Brown, ex-Edge ed also does a v good Substack-type newsletter on the industry that is well worth a few quid a month.\n\nIt should be noted that none of the above things existed in the magazines you have pictured here.\n\nThese were enthusiasts-first, writers-maybe dudes who were flown out to press events on the publisher's dime, given carefully curated demos and pre-screened interviews and ready-made visual assets to publish. I love that era of gaming magazines (and have boxes of them kicking around), but I have no illusions that the preview and development coverage was almost exactly the same material that we see now in a press release and youtube video.\n\nThe reviews were fun (and often frivolous) the preview coverage was primarily reconstructing press kit bullet points and laying out press kit photos. We still have that stuff now, it's just not going through a middle dude.\n\nHonestly, the harder hitting \"actual\" journalism came at the beginning of the death of print mags. The media-savvy critical analysis too. All that was mid-2000s when podcasts began and navel gazing and peek-behind-the-curtain got enough of the people in the games media to take a look at where they are and where they came from and realize \"we should probably be better\".\n\nLike I said, I loved that era of magazines, but aside from liking the physical objects, i mostly just like the feeling I had about games and coverage back then - much more innocent, much more fun, much less knowledgeable. It was a manufactured reality like Disneyland.\n\nBam bam boom"
