        "text": "Clear browsing data stored on your device\n\nTo clear your Microsoft Edge browsing data, first decide if you want to delete the data only on the device you're currently using, or across all synced devices. To clear browsing data just on the device you're currently using, make sure sync is turned off. If you want to clear browsing data on all synced devices, make sure you are signed in and sync is turned on. Items that are synced will be cleared across all synced devices.\n\nTo turn off sync:\n\nSelect Settings and more .\n\nGo to Settings > Profiles > Sync and select Turn off sync.\n\nTo clear your browsing data in Microsoft Edge:\n\nSelect Settings and more > Settings > Privacy, search, and services .\n\nUnder Delete browsing data > Clear browsing data now, select Choose what to clear.\n\nUnder Time range, choose a time range from the drop-down menu.\n\nChoose the types of browsing data you want to clear (see the table below for descriptions).\n\nFor example, you may want to remove browsing history and cookies but keep passwords and form fill data.\n\nSelect Clear now.\n\nClear browsing data stored in the cloud (if you’ve turned on sync or personalization)\n\nTo manage and delete data saved in the Microsoft cloud, see the privacy dashboard. On the privacy dashboard you can view or delete your data. Data that you delete on the privacy dashboard won’t be deleted from your device.\n\nTo learn more about how to stop sharing your data with Microsoft, see Microsoft Edge, browsing data, and privacy."
