What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask for your driver’s license or other identifying information.\n\nHow do we review this application?\n\nYou agree that we can review your criteria to determine which products you qualify for and how much credit we will give you. Further, you agree that we will give you the product and pricing you qualify for.\n\nWhat should you do once you receive your new card?\n\nAs soon as your new card arrives, please confirm with us that you received it. You can confirm your card by using one of many convenient methods that we provided with your card.\n\nIf you do not confirm your card, your requests for certain services may be delayed, such as:\n\nBalance transfers\n\nOverdraft Protection\n\nWells Fargo Online®\n\nATM access\n\nFurther, you may also be denied access to your Account.\n\nWhat is the minimum credit limit?\n\nThe minimum credit limit is $1,000.00.\n\nHow might we manage credit limits if you have multiple Wells Fargo Credit Card accounts?\n\nIf you are applying for an additional card, then you agree that we can distribute your credit limits between each card if:\n\nYou already have a Wells Fargo Credit Card account that has no current balance, and\n\nYou have not used the Wells Fargo Credit Card account for any reason within the past six months.\n\nPlease note: You can change or re-distribute your credit limits on your own by calling Customer Service any time at the number listed on the back of your card. Certain restrictions may apply.\n\nHow do we calculate your variable APRs?\n\nA variable APR is an interest rate that varies with the market based on the U.S. Prime Rate. To calculate your variable APR for each billing period, we use the U.S. Prime Rate and add a margin.\n\nHow We Determine the U.S. Prime Rate\n\nEach billing period, we use the U.S. Prime Rate that the Wall Street Journal publishes in its Money Rates section three business days before your billing statement’s closing date. When more than one U.S. Prime Rate exists, we use an average. If the U.S. Prime Rate is not published or available (temporarily or permanently), we use a substitute index that we believe is similar to the U.S. Prime Rate. We do so at our sole discretion.\n\nAs of 08/14/2024, the U.S. Prime Rate is 8.50%.\n\nHow We Calculate Your Variable APR\n\nWe use the following margins:\n\nFor purchases and balance transfers: We add either 11.74%, 16.74%, or 21.74% to the U.S. Prime Rate. Your creditworthiness determines the percentage we use. The Maximum APR is 29.99%.\n\nFor cash advances and overdraft protection advances: We add 22.74% to the U.S. Prime Rate. The Maximum APR is 29.99%.\n\nWe reserve the right to change terms, APRs, and fees at our discretion by following your Agreement and as allowed by applicable law.\n\nPlease note: You may not qualify for the lowest APRs described. We review your credit report, information provided in your application, and other available relevant information to determine your APRs.\n\nHow do we apply your payments?\n\nMinimum Payment\n\nGenerally, we process your minimum payment in the following order:\n\nLower APR balances (such as Purchases)\n\nHigher APR balances (such as Cash Advances)\n\nAmounts in Excess of the Minimum Payment\n\nIf you pay more than your required minimum payment, generally we apply the excess first to the higher APR balances and then to lower ones.\n\nHow does Overdraft Protection work?\n\nYou can choose whether to link your Account to your Wells Fargo checking account for Overdraft Protection. To enroll, visit us online at: www.wellsfargo.com/credit-cards/features/overdraft-protection/.\n\nIf you choose to enroll, you can link to an account where you are either the sole owner or a joint owner.\n\nJoint Checking Accounts\n\nIf you link to a joint Wells Fargo checking account, then you are responsible for all Overdraft Protection Advances from your credit card, including interest and charges. This responsibility applies regardless of who:\n\nWrites the check,\n\nPurchases items with the debit card, or\n\nEngages in any other transaction that causes the overdraft\n\nWhen Interest Charges Begin\n\nInterest will begin to accrue on each date that an advance is made.\n\nCredit Card Confirmation Required\n\nYou must confirm that you received your credit card. If you do not confirm your card, no money will transfer to cover the overdraft. Please allow up to three business days to fully enable your Overdraft Protection service once you confirm your credit card. Refer to the Agreement for details. You may be able to protect your Account against overdraft with other less costly options.\n\nFor more information about Overdraft Protection, please visit the following webpages:\n\nUsing Your Card for Overdraft Protection:www.wellsfargo.com/credit-cards/features/overdraft-protection/\n\nOther Overdraft Protection Options:www.wellsfargo.com/checking/overdraft-services/\n\nHow do we verify information from phone service providers?\n\nYou agree that we may contact your past, present, and future phone service providers to verify information that you gave us including any phone numbers against their records about you (such as name, address and account status).\n\nHow and why can we contact you?\n\nYou agree that we have your consent to contact you at any phone number, email address, or mailing address you provide for any Wells Fargo account or at any number that you call us from or at any number that we obtain by other means. If you provided a phone number(s), you agree that you are authorized to provide this phone number(s) and agree to receive calls and text messages from Wells Fargo at this number(s) for all your current and future Wells Fargo products and services. This does not give Wells Fargo permission to call or text you for marketing purposes. Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies. Automated systems, including prerecorded or artificial voice may be used.\n\nWhat happens if your contact information changes?\n\nYou must promptly contact us if you change any of the contact information you provided us. This information includes your:\n\nName\n\nEmail addresses\n\nMailing address\n\nPhone numbers\n\nHow is the credit card law different for Ohio residents?\n\nNotice: The Ohio laws against discrimination require that all creditors make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers, and that credit reporting agencies maintain separate credit histories on each individual upon request. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission administers compliance with this law.\n\nHow is the credit card law different for married Wisconsin residents?\n\nNotice: If you are married, by submitting your credit card application you are confirming that this credit card obligation is being incurred in the interest of your marriage and your family. No provision of any marital property agreement (pre-marital agreement), unilateral statement under 766.59 of the Wisconsin Statutes, or a court decree under 766.70 adversely affects the interest of the creditor unless the creditor, prior to the time the credit is granted, is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement or decrees or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision. If the credit card for which you are applying is granted, you will notify the Bank if you have a spouse who needs to receive notification that credit has been extended to you.\n\nHow does the 20,000 Rewards Points bonus work?\n\nHow You Qualify\n\nYou qualify for the 20,000 Rewards Points bonus when you make at least $1,000 in net purchases that post to your account within 3 months from the date you opened your account. A net purchase is the amount that remains after any returns or credits.\n\nWhen You Redeem Rewards Points Bonus\n\nYour Rewards Points bonus posts to your Account within one to two billing periods after you earn it.\n\nWhat Does Not Earn Rewards Points Bonus\n\nCash Advances and Any Kind of Equivalents\n\nATM transactions\n\nCash advances\n\nMoney orders\n\nPre-paid gift cards\n\nTraveler’s checks\n\nWire transfers\n\nBalance Transfers\n\nBalance transfers\n\nSUPERCHECKSTM\n\nDisputes and Illegal Transactions\n\nDisputed or illegal purchases\n\nPurchases that violate these Terms or Addendum, or Credit Card Account agreement terms\n\nFees and Interest\n\nAny fees or interest that post to your Credit Card Account, such as:\n\nAnnual or monthly fees\n\nLate fees\n\nReturned payment fees\n\nGambling Transactions\n\nAny gambling transactions you make, including:\n\nBets or wagers made online\n\nCasino gaming chips\n\nLottery tickets\n\nOff-track wagers\n\nFor a complete summary of the Rewards Points Program, refer to Part 2 of this document, Summary of the Wells Fargo Rewards® Program Terms and Conditions and the Wells Fargo Autograph Visa® Card Addendum.\n\nWhat is Cellular Telephone Protection?\n\nAs a cardholder, you may be able to receive Cellular Telephone Protection.
