The name is based on his initials, J. San, being a play on Jason and the Argonauts. Argonaut first developed a relation with Nintendo when they presented a method of defeating the Game Boy copyright protection mechanism.[1] This led to both companies working on a prototype flight simulator called SNESGlider. Nintendo published Argonaut's Game Boy action game X in 1992. Full development of SNESGlider then entered production, and San convinced Nintendo to make custom hardware for it. The hardware became the Super FX chip and the game became Star Fox, released in 1993. Nintendo would then publish the Argonaut-developed Stunt Race FX in 1994. Argonaut then started development of Star Fox 2 and got far into development before Nintendo shut it down. The most likely reasons for this are the game looking primitive by then-current hardware standards and Nintendo making Star Fox 64 in-house without their involvement. Argonaut then pitched a 3D platformer starring Yoshi but this was rejected. The project eventually evolved into Croc: Legend of the Gobbos. Argonaut would continue to develop games and chips for other companies until going bankrupt in 2004 and forced to liquidate their assets, effectively shutting themselves down.\n\nIn all five games, the first Star Fox was represented, with Fox and, starting with Melee, Falco appearing as fighters.

Website idSoftware.com Article on Wikipedia id Software\n\nId Software LLC (spelled id Software) is an American video game publisher and developer. The origin can be traced back to the late 1980s when John Romero and Tom Hall met as employees of Softdisk. Together with Lane Roathe, another employee, that named themselves Ideas from the deep. At this time, Romero met another employee, John Carmack, who invented a way to create fluid screen scrolling on PC and created a demo that plagiarized Super Mario Bros. 3 titled Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement. All of them ended up working on a full demo of Mario 3 for PC and sent it to Nintendo. While Nintendo was impressed, they turned it down as they had no interest in putting their properties on anything but their own hardware at the time. Around this time, Scott Miller of Apogee software caught wind of these events and wanted to hire the group. He staged a guerilla recruitment process by sending several \"fan\" letters in rapid succession that the group discovered came from the same address. This was necessary because Softdisk screened all mail and his formal letters would have been thrown out. Romero, Hall, Carmack, and several other Softdisk employees ended up jumping ship to Apogee where they formally became id Software. They ended up developing several iconic franchises, including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3-D, Doom, and Quake. The development of Quake in particular was notoriously stressful due to creative differences, with Romero and Carmack having a growing animosity for each other. This resulted in Romero and other staff members leaving the company around the same time. Still, the remaining members marched on and continued to make a steady output. In 2009, id was acquired by Zenimax Media as a subsidiary, with Zenimax itself being acquired by Microsoft in 2021.\n\nThe Doom Slayer from the id developed Doom franchise appears as a Mii costume, specifically using his design from Doom Eternal.\n\nindieszero[edit]\n\nindieszero Corporation, Ltd.
