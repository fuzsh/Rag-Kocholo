        "text": "During your first year of study, you will build a strong foundation in IT fundamentals, including networking, database development, programming, and systems analysis and design, before specialising in game development, which will see you build skills in computer graphics programming, multimedia design and information visualisation.\n\nTopics include:\n\nGame Engines and Graphics using Unreal game Engine (UE5)\n\nUnity game engine\n\nGame asset creation\n\nGame design\n\nMobile game development\n\nGame project management\n\n3D graphical production\n\nYou will also have the chance to apply technical skills and creativity to wider productions, software and interfaces, studying areas such as:\n\nUser Experience\n\nSoftware Development Tools\n\nProgramming\n\nPython and Java – highly sought after skills in the Australian job market¹.\n\nIn your final year you will put your skills into practice through our ICT Capstone Project.\n\nYou may have the opportunity to work directly with an industry client, drawing on the technical expertise gained throughout your studies and applying professional skills in a real-world setting to produce and deliver an artefact for your client.\n\nYou will enjoy access to dedicated learning hubs where you can connect and collaborate, giving you the full workplace and project experience.\n\n1Deloitte Access Economics, ACS Australia’s Digital Pulse 2021\n\nBalance your creativity with expertise in information technology, and benefit from our partnership with video gaming giant, Epic Games. You can be assured you’ll be taught the most up-to-date gaming skills and practices in demand by the gaming industry, as well as other sectors, including health, business, defence and education.\n\nEpic makes the world’s most popular and widely used Unreal game Engine. As the first university in Australia to gain academic partnership status in their internationally renowned Unreal Academic Partnership Program, we’re offering you the opportunity to develop broad skills in game and software development, preparing you to bring the next generation of games to market.\n\nIn addition to developing technical expertise, you will also complete a unique series of collaborative, work-integrated courses, reinforcing the concepts learnt in the classroom in a supportive practice environment. Non-technical skills are also integrated into your learning to develop the qualities highly valued and sought after by industry. Topics include design thinking, system requirements, system design and agile development, and project management.\n\nIn your final year you may have the opportunity to work directly with an industry client – from brief through to project delivery – with our ICT Capstone Project. Upon graduation, this allows you to demonstrate your ability to deliver work to industry standard, and to the satisfaction of a client.\n\nMost of our IT undergraduate programs share a common first-year, so choosing this degree offers ultimate flexibility. Should you wish to pursue a different specialty after completing your first-year, you can switch to an alternative IT program and receive credit for the courses completed. Start now, decide later.\n\nAs a UniSA student, you will have unique access to work placement opportunities, overseas study tours and exchanges, networking events, internships, guest speakers and more.\n\nOur campuses are equipped with state-of-the-art facilities including modern lecture theatres, libraries, workshops and laboratories, as well as spaces that simulate real work environments.
