        "text": "After two years of holding the event online, in 2022 we were able to hold the real event at Makuhari Messe with visitors for the first time in three years.\n\nHowever, it was not a 100% holding format in 2022. The effects of the spread of the new coronavirus infection still remained, and the event had to be held under various restrictions such as the size of the venue, restrictions on the number and age of visitors allowed in the venue, and new visa (visa) rules for foreigners entering Japan.\n\nDespite these restrictions, the venue was filled with exhibitors and game fans who had been waiting for the show to be held for real, and the excitement and excitement returned to Makuhari Messe. The high evaluation of the exhibition by exhibitors and visitors alike made us realize once again the high demand and importance of holding a real exhibition under any circumstances. This year, for the first time in four years, the entire Makuhari Messe will be used.\n\nThe exhibition will be held for four days from Thursday, September 21 to Sunday, September 24, with a Business Day and Public Day.\n\nWhile some measures to prevent infectious diseases will continue, the number of people allowed in the exhibition hall will be greatly relaxed, and the rules for exhibitors' booths will also be revised.\n\nIn 2023, age restrictions will also be lifted, allowing admission for children under 12 years old, and family-friendly exhibition areas will be restored. In addition, a new corner will be set up and a cosplay area will return to Makuhari Messe for the first time in four years. By expanding the content that can be experienced at the venue, we will be able to provide visitors with even more value from the real event than last year.\n\nOnline contents will continue to be implemented as last year, including official programs, TGS VR, and a special Steam page. The TGS Forum and Business Meeting areas held on Business Day will also be online compatible.\n\nGaming is now more than just entertainment content, and its technology is attracting attention and being implemented outside of the gaming industry. The era in which the gaming ecosystem and technology is leading the world is just around the corner.\n\nTOKYO GAME SHOW 2023 is the place where all the world's games come together. We hope that a wide range of game-related companies will exhibit at the show, and that we can work together as pioneers of the times.\n\nFebruary 2023"
