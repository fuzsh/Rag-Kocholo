        "text": "The fact that mall retailers are struggling is nothing new â€“ retailers like Walmart and Amazon have been taking big bites out of specialty stores for years.\n\nTo start: Season 3 of Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" features a number of mall stores that no longer exist, including candle store Wicks 'N' Sticks (filed for bankruptcy in 2006) and teen retailer Chess King (which closed for good in 1995).\n\nWet Seal\n\nThis once-trendy retailer for young women's clothes, founded in 1962 as Lorne's and renamed Wet Seal in 1990, struggled for much of the last decade. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2015 after closing 338 stores. In 2017, the company closed its remaining 171 locations.\n\nWet Seal now operates an online-only business.\n\nLimited, Too\n\nThis store was created as a junior spinoff of the popular Limited brand. In the mid-2000s, all stores were either shuttered or eventually re-named under the Justice brand.\n\nSharper Image\n\nOnce-iconic mall staple Sharper Image, seen here in a 2002 episode of \"Will & Grace,\" filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2008 and closed all its locations.\n\nEsprit\n\nAlong with Benetton sweatshirts, Esprit sportswear was a big get for 1980s teens. In February 2012, Esprit announced that it planned to close all retail stores in North America.\n\nBenetton\n\nKnown for its socially conscious ad campaigns and bright color palettes, this store brought out the Euro-fashionista in 1980s mall rats. The brand has since shuttered all of its U.S. locations, though it has an online store and a brick-and-mortar presence abroad.\n\nHere, Luciano Benetton poses in a store window at the height of the brand's U.S. popularity.\n\nHenri Bendel\n\nThis trailblazing accessories store was once known for discovering designers before they made it big. Under the ownership of L Brands (the same parent company as Victoria's Secret), all physical locations were closed by January 2019.\n\nSam Goody\n\nSam Goody was the place to be for music back in 1984, at least as evidenced by this Ray Parker, Jr. event promoting his single, \"Ghostbusters.\"\n\nMost stores became FYE locations after Sam Goody filed for bankruptcy in 2006, though curiously, two locations still exist: one in Medford, Oregon, and one in St. Clairsville, Ohio.\n\nZany Brainy\n\nToy retailer FAO Schwarz, under significant competitive pressure from Walmart and Target, began the process of shuttering its Zany Brainy stores in 2003.\n\nKB Toys\n\nKB Toys (or Kay Bee), then one of the largest U.S. toy retailers, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2008. The company closed about 460 stores, many in malls.\n\nCompUSA\n\nFounded in 1984 as Soft Warehouse in Addison, Texas, CompUSA announced the closure of all its stores in 2007.\n\nSystemax, Inc. bought the brand, along with 16 CompUSA retail stores, in 2009 for $30 million. Those stores were rebranded under the TigerDirect name in 2012.\n\nCompUSA, back in the day\n\nHere, then-chairman and CEO of Microsoft Bill Gates signs copies of Windows 98 inside a CompUSA store in San Francisco.\n\nFlorsheim Shoes\n\nOnce America's most iconic shoe retailer, Florsheim's filed for bankruptcy in 2002. You can still buy shoes from the company, but it no longer offers mall stores.\n\nLinens 'n Things\n\nHome goods retailer Linens 'n Things, founded in 1975, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2008 and ultimately won permission to close its 371 remaining brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nThe Linens 'n Things website ceased operations in 2018.\n\nRobinsons-May\n\nRobinsons-May, seen here in December 2005, was acquired by Federated Department Stores that same year. Its locations have since been rebranded as Macy's.\n\nDiscovery Channel Store\n\nThis odd edu-tainment concept owned by Discovery Holdings closed its 103 mall stores in 2007.\n\nCircuit City\n\nOriginally founded in 1949 as Wards Company, electronics retailer Circuit City went bankrupt in 2008, closed its retail locations in early 2009, and sold its brand name to Systemax.\n\nThe retailer's website ceased operations in 2012, ending the use of the Circuit City name, though there are plans to revive the brand as a store-within-a-store model.\n\nMervyn's\n\nOnce a Los Angeles staple, Mervyn's filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and liquidated all its stores.\n\nHecht's\n\nHecht's department stores, founded in Baltimore in 1857 and seen here in the 1950s, was rebranded as Macy's in September 2006.\n\nHecht's: The going-out-of-business sale\n\nHere, a shopper looks through the clearance section of Hecht's in 2006 during one of the store's going out of business sales.\n\nCoconuts\n\nTrans World Entertainment rebranded most of its Coconuts Music & Movies locations into FYE stores in 2006. Just one Coconuts location remains: in Evansville, Indiana.\n\nHere, actress Jennifer Love Hewitt poses for a picture during a 1998 promotional appearance at a Manhattan Coconuts Music & Movies.\n\nFilene's Basement and Syms bankruptcy\n\nFilene's Basement, once well-known in Boston for its yearly wedding dress sale, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2012. It since made a minor online-only comeback.\n\nHollywood Video\n\nOnce large movie-rental chain Hollywood Video filed for bankruptcy in 2010 (for the second time!) and shuttered all its 2,415 stores.\n\nWaldenbooks' final days\n\nThis photo was taken in the final days of Waldenbooks' 2011 liquidation sale.\n\nThe Wiz\n\nSomebody finally beat The Wiz, the electronics store seen here in a 1998 photo. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1997. P.C. Richard & Son purchased the remnants of the company for $1.8 million in 2003."
