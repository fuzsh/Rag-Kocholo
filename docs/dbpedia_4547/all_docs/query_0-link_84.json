        "text": "By justaviking - Wow, iClone 7 is finally here. That means, among other things, it's time to start a new \"corner\" where I can many miscellaneous postings that don't warrant a thread of their own.\n\nI am really excited about iC7. Wow! Lots of \"Wow!\" in this release.\n\nTo start my random posts, I need to share a new feature I requested and didn't even realize was released until today.\n\niC7 supports the $TIME variable for Substances. That opens a world of possibilities.\n\nI wish they'd send an email to the originator of Feedback Tracker Issues when it changes status. I was randomly skimming over old Issues I submitted, when the \"Released\" status of this one caught my eye. I tested it, and it does indeed work!!!\n\nhttps://www.reallusion.com/FeedBackTracker/Issue/Support-the-TIME-variable-for-animated-Substances\n\nWhat does this mean? Why care about the $TIME variable? Well, you know we can apply videos as textures, so you can have an animated texture. The $TIME variable allows a Substance to change over time, so you can actually have an animated Substance.\n\nI will attempt to attach the \"Clouds.sbsar\" file. I'll have to cheat on the file extension. Download the file, and change the extension back to \"Clouds.sbsar\" and have fun.\n\nHere is a sample video.\n\nTo experience this yourself, simply add a cube (or any other shape) to an iClone project, apply the \"cloud\" substance, and press Play.\n\nWhat besides clouds?\n\n- Caustics on the bottom of your swimming pool (there is a sample that came with Substance Player v5).\n\n- Rain on a window.\n\n- Many possibilities.\n\nTHANK YOU, Reallusion development team, for making this work.\n\nP.S.\n\nHere is a free \"caustics\" substance you can also try: https://share.allegorithmic.com/libraries/23 By justaviking - <Placeholder>\n\nBy Galfridus - Indeed a cause for celebration. Thanks for pointing out this important update Justaviking.\n\nI quickly tested some of my content from the old substance power 200 pack items and things like waves, water droplets, tunnel, burnt film etc. Now perform correctly with their animations.\n\nAlong with the great stuff in the new substance pack their is much to explore and enjoy.\n\nGeoff.\n\nBy Kelleytoons - But no video textures on characters still, right?\n\nTHAT I don't understand, as it would open up SO many possibilities (crying, getting bloody or diseased, etc. etc). Why is that still impossible? By justaviking - Greetings fellow iCloners.\n\nI have a couple information, educational, and entertaining resources I'd like to share with you today.\n\nFILMMAKER IQ\n\nI really enjoy John Hess's \"Filmmaker IQ\" videos about the film industry. I love his informative explanations supported by clear graphics and hands-on (\"practical\" or \"live\") demonstrations. I may have mentioned him before, but when I saw a familiar avatar in the comments section, I decided to come here and give him a shout-out.\n\nThis one seemed particularly relevant, given recent discussions about DOF.\n\nThe Science of Deep Focus and the Hyperfocal Distance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hdbx1yD4ns\n\nHere is another great one about how the same script can be acted and directed quite differently.\n\nHow a Director Stages and Blocks a Scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FBnSmbafC8\n\nCHANNEL CRISWELL\n\nThis is a new site (to me). I've only watched a couple of his videos, but I particularly enjoyed the first one I saw. I've heard about \"color\" in movies many times, mostly because I enjoy watching the bonus features on the DVDs I buy. This video, I thought, had excellent examples to go with the narrative explanation.\n\nColour in Storytelling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXgFcNUWqX0\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBy thebiz.movies - Hey JustaViking,\n\nI've also watched that video lately and have been having a good time using LUTs to get a look I want for a desaturated 70 crime klinda flick. After watching the video I realized I was needing to re texture several of my characters, sets and props. I felt like such a production designer!\n\nalso liked this info graphic from studiobinder (linked)\n\nBy justaviking - @Biz - I'm glad my little post was timely for you, even if it did result in more work for you.\n\nThe image you posted and the page you linked to look vaguely familiar; I think I've seen it before, but quite a long time ago. I'll have to give it a good viewing. Thanks for sharing it. By animagic - Interesting, and timely, about the use of colors. With LUT now available, I want to do more with that in my next movie.\n\n@Kelly: You CAN replace character textures with video (could already in iClone 5). I just tried it and you still can. Didn't it work for you? By Kelleytoons -\n\nanimagic (7/31/2017)\n\n@Kelly: You CAN replace character textures with video (could already in iClone 5). I just tried it and you still can. Didn't it work for you?\n\nI wish I could tell you what I was thinking or what I had tried when I couldn't do this -- perhaps I was in Character Creator (haven't tried to see if it works there) or maybe I was just hallucinating, but I could have sworn I tried to do this and couldn't and then, quite a bit later (maybe as long ago as a month) I tried it again and found out I *could* do it. So I have no explanation (although it's nice to be able to do so).\n\nBy paulg625 - I watched several of the Film maker IQ videos, haven seen the Studio binder. thanks. can't ever learn enough.\n\nthebiz.movies (7/26/2017) Hey JustaViking,\n\nI've also watched that video lately and have been having a good time using LUTs to get a look I want for a desaturated 70 crime klinda flick.

I felt like such a production designer!\n\nalso liked this info graphic from studiobinder (linked)\n\nBy justaviking - I was doing some cleaning out of various beta s/w and stuff, and now have two dumb installation questions...\n\n3DXchange complains about needing to install iClone 7:\n\n- I uninstalled an older version of iC7 first, then installed the latest release of iC7\n\n- Then uninstalled my 3DXchange and installed the newest 3DXchange\n\n- So why would it complain about not having iC7 installed?\n\nMy Pirate Lady is missing:\n\n- After doing the above, I also uninstalled and then installed the latest cut of CC2\n\n- I thought I installed all the iC7 \"content\" stuff, but I'm not finding the pirate lady (I know I had her on my system once)\n\n- Did I miss something? (Obviously, I guess. I just don't remember where/how she showed up.)\n\nYes, you might accuse me of being a bit lazy. I just did this for the iClone suite and THREE other suites of authoring software. It was surprisingly exhausting keeping track of all the downloads, uninstalls, installs, patches, and on and on.\n\nI will look around again for the Pirate Lady, and probably reinstall iClone 7 again. Maybe a good solid reboot will help too, now that some of the dust is settling. Maybe a cup of coffee and a cookie would help. But any pointers would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nBy Rampa - Many people have gotten 3DX to stop saying that by re-installing iClone after 3DX is installed. Go figure!\n\nCheck for pirate lady in your order history in your RL account. She seems to go missing a lot. By duchess110 - There was a RLHumanCore.dll I believe that was required and if I recall doing it the way you have might have taken it out.\n\nI would suggest uninstall all.\n\nInstall ic7\n\nreboot\n\ninstall cc2\n\nreboot\n\ninstall 3dx change reboot.\n\nI am sure if you search it is mentioned somewhere.\n\nHope this helps you out I know reinstalling can be a right pain.\n\nEdit\n\nThis is what I was referring to it is in the comments replies on the feedback tracker\n\nhttps://www.reallusion.com/FeedBackTracker/Issue/Unexpected-message-Please-install-iClone-7-first-at-startup By justaviking - Thanks, Duchess.\n\nI think that's it exactly; I unisntalled 3DX beta after installing iC7.\n\nIf I had done all the uninstalls first, then all the installs, it would probably have been clean.\n\nI'll just reinstall iC7; that sounds like it will fix it, per the notes in Feedback Tracker.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYup, that's all it needed... uninstall and reinstall iC7.\n\nI was concerned about going in circles, with 3DXchange wanting iC7 installed first as a prerequisite. At least it's been that way in the past.\n\nAfter verifying 3DXchange no longer complains, I installed the iC7 Resource Pack for extra fun.\n\nNow to finish tracking down my missing pirate.\n\nThanks again.\n\nBy wires - The Lady Pirate was provided as a CC character, and an iClone character, only to those who purchased the Early Access packet. Sometime during the EA testing she turned up in a Resource Pack update, but only as an iAvatar. She was not included in the final public release of either iClone or CC.\n\nMany assets that were provided for testing during both the Beta and EA phases were also not included in the final releases, but if you made a Backup of all the resources then just copy the missing items over to the final version.\n\nBy justaviking - Thanks, Gerry. I was thinking along those lines.\n\nI'm pretty sure I did have her on my system for a while, but when I noticed she was gone, I was having trouble finding exactly where (which build or email) she came from. It's not a big deal, as I wasn't planning a major \"lady pirate\" movie, but I noticed her absence and it made me curious, and it's always nice to have everything, and I hate losing stuff that way.. My \"uninstall\" may have wiped her out (though I did a nice backup first).\n\nI've got so many irons in the fire right now, I'll just have to see if my curiosity (and the challenge of restoring her) get me sufficiently motivated. By justaviking - SIGGRAPH 2017 --- Wow!\n\nI was watching through this playlist. Lots of \"simulation\" stuff that doesn't direclty apply to iClone.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHFiqDkNCp1gaKu4HQwL9-S3eIDmAHIUw\n\nMOST OF ALL FOR ICLONE USERS (so far)...\n\nWow!!! - check out this character control (walking/running) neural network.\n\nAs someone who has always been vexed by foot-sliding in iClone, I was very impressed.\n\nAnd then at 4:19... Wow! again... he \"naturally\" spread out his hands for balance.\n\nWow!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ul0Gilv5wvY?list=PLHFiqDkNCp1gaKu4HQwL9-S3eIDmAHIUw\n\nI saw another really cool \"walking\" video from last year (SIGGRAPH, I think). I see them and dream of them being in iClone. Maybe some day (hopefully for far less than $1200 though).\n\nBy Rampa - The source code is available for that locomotion system. So maybe! By justaviking -\n\nRampa (8/8/2017) The source code is available for that locomotion system. So maybe!\n\nThat's interesting.\n\nAnd with Python scripting in iC7... hmmm... tantalizing.\n\nI have some ideas of what I'd like to try with Python scripting in iClone, but nothing near that level. It would be cool, though, wouldn't it. By Kelleytoons - It's not the coding that's the issue, but the database. They are suggesting it's a pretty huge database (which is kind of how neural networks work). My guess is that if this ever was to get into production the cost would be to hook into their database (i.e. the game would link into that database so they could get money for each use). In any case, it really has zero application to iClone. By justaviking - So... speaking of Python...\n\nI have started down the dangerous path of learning Python scripting. It's quite easy to read (I knew that already), but when you don't know all the syntax yet, it still takes a little while.\n\nI'm using Blender as my training ground. I actually have a specific task I'd like to automate, and considering I'm on my second (partial) evening, I'm feeling pretty good. Sometimes the Blender interface can feed the commands right to you in one of the windows, other times you can use Blender's Python console window to help with the command options, but sometimes there are still more options and input fields than what are immediately apparent. For example, \"select_all()\" is a toggle, just like the \"a\" hotkey, so you have to use \"select_all(action='SELECT')\" to actually ensure you select everything, regardless if something was already selected or not.\n\nSo between logical guesses (which sometimes work) and a bit of Google, I'm making progress. Yeah, feeling good, but now it's time to double-check that I've saved what I learned and get ready for bed.\n\nBy Kelleytoons - Good for you -- immediate feedback is one of the hallmarks of scripting, and one that accelerates the learning curve. I wish I had had that kind of ability back when I first started programming (we used punch cards and had to wait UNTIL THE NEXT DAY to even know if our program had run, let alone what it did. OTOH, it leads to pretty rigourous hand checking techniques). By justaviking -\n\nI Try Not to Stare\n\n...but...\n\nPeople are Strange\n\nSometimes when I'm sitting in a conference room at work, and the meeting starts to drag on a bit, I find myself looking at people. Then I think about making them in Character Creator. And that's when I come to the conclusion that if I was able to make faithful reproductions of some the people I see around me, people here would laugh and mock the avatars.\n\nConsider the eyebrows. They are all over the place. Low ones. High ones. Slanted ones (like Spock in the original Star Trek pilot episode). Some are not much more than a tuft of fuzz near the area above the nose (whatever you call that area). The females tend to be much more creative than the males (who at most, might trim them). Some women shave off the natural ones (I'm sure) and then paint on fake ones. Some are obviously fake, and would look like very bad art work in Character Creator. Some are high and arched, leading to a look of perpetual surprise! (Or maybe a nod to the McDonald's golden arches logo.)\n\nA number of men are bald (naturally or not), and some have very shiny heads. It seems more noticeable on the the black guys, but several of the white guys are pretty shiny too. One of the black guys, I swear, puts car wax on his head. If I made an avatar with a head that reflective, nobody would believe it.\n\nAnd basic things, like the shape of the head. This is most noticeable on the bald guys, of course. Some almost have a ridge, running front-to-back, with flat sides, like a roof. Some are lumpy and not even symmetrical (much like Linus, in the Peanuts cartoons). I've see a couple that are amazingly round, like Charlie Brown. Even on people with hair, the forehead can be nearly vertical or drastically slanted back.\n\nOne guy, from the side, had the flattest back of the head I've ever seen. From the base of the neck to the peak of his head (yes, the highest part of his head might have been very close to the back.) From the side, I swear, he looked like the statues on Easter Island. I was so tempted to try and take a photo, because if I ever made an avatar with a head shaped like that, you'd never believe it.\n\nThen you get into chins and necks. Very few people (at least where I live) have a flat, horizontal area under their chin. At least not after the age of 20. Even in-shape and thin people tend to have that chin/neck area that is more of a 45-degree angle that goes from the chin to below the Adam's apple.\n\nAnd, yes, there is no shortage of overweight people. Necks. They would be very difficult to model and get to behave correctly.\n\nThe amazing thing is, they are not freaks. The beautiful variety of people is a wonderful thing that enriches our world, but so many of our \"normal\" avatars fall into a very narrow range with limited variation in shapes and sizes.\n\nYup, some meetings drag on and on, so my mind wanders. I find myself looking at people, textures and surfaces, shapes, lighting (even in conference rooms). Sigh....\n\nI've been thinking of writing this for many days (off and on), and finally decided to write it and get it out of my system.\n\nSomeone please tell me I'm not the only one. Please?\n\nBy wires - Looks like a very serious case of iCloneitis, I'm sure that professional help is available if needed. By Pixtim - Hahaha! Justaviking, i love you! !\">: D!\n\nYour message made me laugh a lot! I just think you're an artist stunned by the diversity of the world.\n\nFinally, our thinking is much less free than we believe.\n\n), je donnais l'exemple suivant : Si vous dessinez une main ultra réaliste\">When I gave drawing lessons (I do not know how to draw, but I still give drawing lessons .. life is strange sometimes ), I gave the following example: If you draw an ultra realistic hand in profile and tense, very flat. Nobody will consider that your drawing is just ... a hand stretched flat profile view ... it looks like nothing ... and certainly not a hand!\n\nIn many cases, the special effects can not be as reality would be, peronne would believe it ... And moreover, some stories that happen in reality could not be the subject of a film at all. .. everyone would find that silly, abusive .. grotesque!\n\nSo the faces .... is what you have already experienced to make a picture of you from the front, to cut your portrait in the middle and to make a symmetry on one side .. and then on the other. .. it's pretty surprising!\n\nSo when we look carefully at the people around us .... we find ourselves quickly in the heart of an alien brotherhood, and it's very funny! \">\n\nWe have as many visual habits as habits of life ... By Kelleytoons - Dennis,\n\nI know *exactly* what you mean -- except not just about people. I did 2D animation for a decade or so after I was heavily into 3D, and I knew I was \"back\" in 3D when suddenly everything I looked at in the world around me I started thinking \"how would I model/light/animate that?\"\n\nIt's definitely an occupational hazard. SMH, I just shrug it off and say to myself \"stop analyzing and appreciate life for what it is.\" And then I go back and say \"but if I put a directional light over here just so, and then that park bench I have is pretty close to what I'm seeing here with a bit of Speedtrees thrown in...\" By mark - Marvelous observation Dennis!!!!\n\nBy justaviking - @Gerry - I know I need help. That's why I'm here.\n\n@Pixtim - I'm glad my strange confession made you smile. Thanks for the \"hand\" example. I believe it. Also, I've seen examples of the asymmetry in people's faces. The activity you suggested (mirroring the left/right halves of the face) does reveal that we are surprising unsymmetrical.\n\n@KelleyToons - You are right, it is an occupational hazard. (More below.)\n\n@Mark - Nice to see you here, too.\n\nRe Occupational hazard - A few days ago two people were commenting in the Substance Designer/Painter forums. One talked about \"critiquing\" real-world photographs, like you would normally pick apart a rendering. Then he has to stop and remind himself that he's looking at an actual photograph. In response, a guy confessed to stepping outside, looking up, and saying the clouds look wrong and the sky color is off. (He maybe needs to get away from his computer and step outside a bit more often.)\n\nBut seriously, this happened to the director of the Iron Man movies when they were working on the first one. In a \"preview\" meeting one day, the director complained about the computer-generated Iron Man suit being too reflective and it wasn't believable. However, the director was looking at the real suit, not the CG-rendered one. That was a key moment for the director; when he realized the computer graphics were truly mature.\n\nOne more story (for now)...\n\nSkin color. (Why does this feel like such a sensitive topic these days? I'll bravely press on anyway, without worrying too much about my choice of words.) I am blessed to be in a very diverse work environment, and as I said in my previous post, I get time to make observations during some long-running meetings.\n\nBy the way, I'm white. \"Viking.\" Norwegian ancestry. Hopefully this isn't a big surprise to anyone. But I'm not going to be one-sided on this subject.\n\nI have often noticed the strong color contrast between the back of the hand and the palm on some of the black guys. It seems I notice that more on the males than the females; I'll have to think about that some. I have some variation in my own hands, but not nearly as stark as the brown/pink contrast on some guys. It's not universal, though. But the point being I would be hesitant to paint that much of a contrast on the hands of a black avatar, even though it is quite common.\n\nDon't worry, it's the white guys too. As a kid with a 16-color box of Crayola crayons, it was difficult to color people who looked like me. \"White\" wasn't correct, not even for me in the winter time (and it didn't show up much on white paper anyway - what a waste of a crayon in the box). So the next obvious choice was \"pink.\" Uh, no. That's for the inside of bunny ears, not for skin. Well, a few weeks ago I saw this guy that could have been colored using the white and pink crayons. His arms and hands were so white. No, he wasn't an albino, but my goodness he was white, almost like some versions of Dracula in the movies. That changed, though, when it came to his face. It was pink. I swear, literally pink. I have never before in my life seen a person you could color - accurately - using the white and pink crayons.\n\nTo make a good avatar, though, variation in skin tone is crucial . We are not one color. Hands, arms, neck, and across the face, we vary. And we have various birth marks and moles and veins and wrinkles.\n\nTo close. I want to share one semi-political comment. In the noble quest for gender and racial equality, which I cannot imagine opposing, it somehow became \"insensitive\" to notice our differences. That really irritates me. Tall, short, male, female, black, white, brown, thick, thin, hairy, bald... just because we see superficial exterior differences does not make us bad people. We should be able to enjoy those differences, not pretend they don't exist. How boring it would be if we were all the same, like robots off an assembly like. No thank you. I much prefer the variety and diversity, and wish it was easier to talk about such things without being nervous.\n\nBy mark -\n\nTo close. I want to share one semi-political comment.

I like the head shots, as they also show how asymmetrical real faces are, something often overlooked in modeling.\n\nI took one of them, Pantone 63-6 C, and created a head in CT8. I then refined it further in CC 2.0.\n\nI think it's also a good resource for those who want to practice their head-making skills.\n\nEDIT: Legal requirement: Photography by Angelica Dass (www.angelicadass.com) By justaviking - @Gerry - Thanks for the interesting resource. I haven't gotten a good look at it yet, but I look forward to delving into it more deeply.\n\n@Tony - I would say there are some generalities, mostly along demographic lines, such as where people were born and raised. Those generalities tend to be include cultural differences that go with those demographics that tend to affect politics, food, and other such preferences. More of a factor at work, though, is people's employment background and job function. People who work in finance, project management, manufacturing, maintenance, engineering, sales, etc., seem to fall into different viewpoints and perspectives, some of which are justified by their responsibility to the company. I find that those differences to be the ones that make it easier or more challenging to work with someone. I spent many years as an \"outside consultant\" and I often found myself bridging gaps within the companies where I consulted, and putting aside any humility, I often helped \"translate\" between internal organizations and healed many long-running conflicts by deciphering what people \"meant\" as opposed to what was \"heard\" by those across the table. Lots of re-wording and many analogies often helped break down communication barriers. But I've never had race or gender be an actual obstacle I've had to overcome.\n\n@Schemer - Hmm, lopsided ears. Now I have something to look for tomorrow.\n\n@Animagic - Nice work on the avatar. By TonyDPrime -\n\njustaviking (11/30/2017) @Gerry - Thanks for the interesting resource.

By justaviking - Thanks, Gerry.\n\nI'm doing fine, but Pinhead was a bit distressed.\n\nHere is a close-up of the prop:\n\nIt is amazing how many things can be discovered even by making such a simple little prop, but it made a great test-case for developing a good start-to-finish workflow. It's still not a well-optimized asset (no pun intended), but (again, no pun intended), the number of details and steps can be amazing.\n\n- Blender modeling\n\n- Proper scaling\n\n- Hidden geometry\n\n- High-poly and low-poly meshes\n\n- Triangulation and decimation of meshes\n\n- Blender modifiers and edge loops and hard edges\n\n- Doing all the above Blender stuff in an optimal sequence\n\n- Multiple materials\n\n- Color ID maps (especially with respect to different materials)\n\n- FBX vs. OBJ file formats\n\n- Scanning\n\n- Textures and Substances\n\n- Painting and material selection\n\nAll these things, and more, become considerations in making a high-quality prop. This particular one does not embed everything I've been practicing and stringing together the last couple of days, but I think I have a real good handle on it.\n\nFor example, briefly, there are distinct pros and cons to using multiple materials in Blender, versus using vertex color painting to make an ID map, especially when you export to Substance Painter, and that's one of the times you really want to export as FBX rather than OBJ. Yeah, so many moving parts. But fun.\n\nBy justaviking - a) I am writing in response to this post in the \"Filmmaking versus Animation\" thread: https://forum.reallusion.com/FindPost354832.aspx\n\nb) You don't have to read that entire thread but plead to read at least the one post I linked to.\n\nc) This could, and probably should, become its own thread, but I'm not quite ready to start it yet. But I wanted to step out of the established thread for this side conversation.\n\nI am going to reference one of my own projects. Not to boast, since I know it's full of flaws, but I think I can use it as a good foundation on which I can make some comments.\n\nANIMATING TO A SCRIPT:\n\nIn this case, I wrote the script, nearly in its entirety, before starting any significant iClone work. So in that case, I was animating to a script.\n\nI did some technical proofs-of-concept before getting too far into the project, but I did not do any storyboarding I went straight from script to iClone.\n\nBRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE SCENE:\n\nA man has kidnapped a lady. Until now, we haven't really known why, or what the connection was between them. In the scene immediately preceding this one, her boyfriend (Pinhead) was asking for help in rescuing her, and that person suggested Pinhead tell him more about the kidnapper. That is where we cut to this scene.\n\nIt should start at T=19:27 and run to 21:07 (1min 40sec)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnASRNU8vn4&feature=youtu.be&t=1167\n\nFILMMAKING CHALLENGES:\n\nA core feature of this \"film\" is it was a semi-musical format, using *existing* songs. That meant I had limited control over the duration in some places. It also made the script writing very challenging in places. There were a couple songs I really, really wanted to use, and the lyrics were perfect, but the genders were wrong. You can't have your leading man sing with a female voice half-way through the movie. It really made me appreciate a filmmaker who can have custom-written music, performed specifically for his movie.\n\nANIMATION CHALLENGES:\n\nBecause it involves singing to a music track, the normal audio-to-viseme method would not work - the music interfered with the words. It also meant the text-to-speech method would not work because the speed and timing would change drastically. My solution was to speak/chant the words into my microphone in time with the music for audio-to-viseme generation. It still took a lot of viseme cleanup to make it better. I think I did a pretty good job of cleaning up a few songs, and some parts turned out pretty well. The song in this scene represents a mediocre \"singing/viseme\" result. (A couple others were left in a horrible state because I of the project's deadline date.)\n\nMY FILMMAKING CRITIQUE - POSITIVE:\n\nThis scene is a bit of backstory and exposition, but I had to explain WHY the villain kidnapped her. I thought I did a reasonable job of it. (Others may disagree, of course.)\n\nI think most the \"acting\" is reasonable. I still like most of the basic gestures and hand and body motions in terms what the director (me) wanted.\n\nIs \"acting\" in this sense a filmmaking or an animation critique? Consider when she gasps and covers her mouth at 20:35 as she realizes this is all the result of a romantic obsession. I call that \"directing and acting\" which I think puts it into the filmmaking category.\n\nMY FILMMAKING CRITIQUE - NEGATIVE:\n\nMy wife really thought I got too \"dark\" as the scene faded out. Not in terms of the lighting, but it may have implied an even darker turn of events than I intended. I wanted her to be in a certain amount of peril, but no, he is not going to rape her.\n\nAt 20:03-20:08 I wanted her to follow his hand motions because I thought that would be a natural thing to do. I think I overdid that a bit (I'm calling that a \"director's\" error, not an animation error.)\n\nI'm mostly satisfied with my camera work. There is always room for improvement, but overall I'm okay with it.\n\nMY ANIMATION TECHNIQUE - POSITIVE:\n\nRepeating myself, I am generally pleased with the main \"acting\" animations - the hand motions and most of the head motions.\n\nI was also quite pleased with the \"physical\" interaction between the characters, such as when he grasps her hands at 20:52 and also when she pushes back against him at 20:57. The hand interaction is not perfect, but acceptable to me (especially if you don't go frame-by-frame).\n\nMY ANIMATION TECHNIQUE - NEGATIVE:\n\nWell, that could fill a book.\n\nThe faces are largely expressionless. This scene was typical of my lack of \"eyebrow\" and other facial animations. I did it in small places, but again it fell victim to one person working on a large project with a deadline. It sure would have been a great time to have Faceware to capture all the emotional acting without all the painstaking animation.\n\nThere is also a lack of \"life\" when they aren't doing any specific acting. They typically become mannequins when they are waiting their turn to talk. The standard \"idle\" motions wouldn't work, but some breathing would be nice, and any small motions to add some life.\n\nI also cheated where the villain \"walks\" forward at 20:42. He just slides forward. That's partly because I still find it challenging to have avatars walk short distances and stop at precise locations. In a different scene I tweaked a similar \"glide,\" adding a touch of up-and-down motion to the body, which still isn't perfect but is a big improvement to a simple translation.\n\nLighting was close to default lighting. Sadly, that was one of the main things I wanted to do a better job on when I started the project, but it got left on the back burner again.\n\nMy \"jail cell\" set has some very rudimentary textures. What I used helps tell the story, but they are certainly nothing to be proud of.\n\nAnd the shadows! I had trouble with them. They were so blocky. In some scenes they were even worse than in this scene. Part of that was my fault, I'm sure, but it also shows again the huge improvements made from iClone 5 to iClone 7.\n\nHair. The girl's hair had no physics, and goes into her body. The villain's hair it a bit too big for his head, but I couldn't simply scale it down or it had other problems. This predated Character Creator with conforming hair.\n\nCLOSING:\n\nI don't know if this added to the \"filmmaking versus animation\" discussion or not. Feel free to comment here, especially agreeing or disagreeing with my comments in this post.\n\nYou can also critique my video if you wish. Technically, most of my iClone videos end with what I would call a \"pre-vis\" quality. As a personal focus, I'd rather tell a decent story with low-quality video than the inverse. As a film, I feel the first third or so is rough, and could use some editing to make it tighter, and at least one of the songs is sort of forced into the script and should maybe be cut out, though I'm pretty satisfied with the \"film\" aspects of the second half (relative to the vision I had).\n\nBy Delerna - am going to have tea and watch a movie shortly but just wanted to make a few quick comments now. I think I am going to watch and read this again and maybe post some more thoughts at some stage.\n\nFor me the biggest thing is yes, you are right this is full of flaws but wow, I watched that whole video and you had me wanting to see what was going to happen. My wife also came in and saw part of it and she enjoyed what she saw. For me perfect animation is not necessary, so long as it is reasonable and works with the story then that is good enough. Especially for us who are trying to learn how to make interesting videos.\n\nObviously once I get effective with that then that is when I would work harder and spend more time on improving my animation. But telling a story well makes up for animation that is not perfect. I have seen many professional cartoon videos where that has happening. I have also seen plenty where the animations and graphics are astounding but the story was rubbish and I quickly stopped watching it. So in my opinion, telling stories well is what I need to spend the time on first up.\n\nOne more thing, I agree with you about storyboards. There are uses for it I think but I think its primary purpose is to assist large teams to all see the story in the same way. It takes time to do it but that time is worth it for a large team. When I am the only one doing the story then I know what it is I am working on so instead of spending time doing storyboards I will just work on my project\n\nAnyway. Off to tea\n\nBy Spiny Norman - By Kelleytoons - Dennis,\n\nI'll watch later -- way too early for me to get my eyes open enough at the moment -- but something you mentioned (and then Delerma also echoed) reminded me of something important and it's OT. You mentioned your wife commented on your work.\n\nI find it's incredibly helpful to get feedback from my harshest critic, my significant other. Since we've been married for over 30 years you'd think we might think alike, but she offers such a different outlook on things, particularly my animation, that it nearly always causes me to rethink and, yes, change things even though my first response is \"well, she doesn't get it\".\n\nFor those of us who are one-man shops, having this kind of feedback from a trusted friend (one who won't completely tear you a new one :&gt is invaluable. Unless they are just really into animation or your work, it's unlikely you can involve them early (which would be the most helpful) but you ought to for sure at least let them have a look at the \"final\" product -- and then take that into serious consideration.\n\nWhile there is a lot of \"we need to be true to ourselves\" the simple fact is that the opposite sex in particular sees things differently -- viva la difference, as Spencer Tracy once said, but taking that into account will make your work SO much better it isn't even funny. If my own wife hasn't seen and approved what I've done the job isn't finished. By Kelleytoons -\n\njustaviking (1/19/2018) a)\n\nThe faces are largely expressionless. This scene was typical of my lack of \"eyebrow\" and other facial animations. I did it in small places, but again it fell victim to one person working on a large project with a deadline. It sure would have been a great time to have Faceware to capture all the emotional acting without all the painstaking animation.\n\nThere is also a lack of \"life\" when they aren't doing any specific acting. They typically become mannequins when they are waiting their turn to talk. The standard \"idle\" motions wouldn't work, but some breathing would be nice, and any small motions to add some life.\n\nI also cheated where the villain \"walks\" forward at 20:42. He just slides forward. That's partly because I still find it challenging to have avatars walk short distances and stop at precise locations. In a different scene I tweaked a similar \"glide,\" adding a touch of up-and-down motion to the body, which still isn't perfect but is a big improvement to a simple translation.\n\nLet's leave aside things which iClone has improved natively (shadows, hair physics, textures in the cell and even lighting -- GI has solve many, if not most, problems with interiors in that regard). Folks will still have issues with the rest, because we are most familiar with people we notice if their behavior, facial or body movements aren't \"authentic\". I've talked about this elsewhere, but I do think we approach the uncanny valley nowadays, and it's a slippery slope, because the more real we get the more folks notice these things. In something like this particular video we are apt to \"cut it some slack\", just as when we watch 2D animation we don't need for it to even behave the laws of gravity or anything approaching normal.\n\nBut the more \"normal\" something looks the less we are likely to ignore it when it doesn't go all the way, and I think this is going to continue to plague us now that our tools are very sophisticated. IOW, we've all seen what good facial stuff looks like now, and whether you have Faceware or whether you've just not spent a lot of time in the facial editor, folks are going to be unforgiving if it doesn't look that way.\n\nI also think the comment about the actors waiting for their turn to talk: oddly enough, this is also true of real people who don't understand that acting is also reacting. But we can take a clue from the actor's workshop and understand it's just as important (maybe more so) to show our actors reacting to the speaker as it is to get the speaker right.\n\nAs for the last comment, about getting small movements -- this is where I think mocap works the best. I don't like using it for \"big\" motions but just for standing around and moving slightly. I find using my iPisoft setup for these things adds a TON of realism (plus it's easy to do).\n\nBy uncwee -\n\njustaviking (1/19/2018)I am writing in response to this post in the \"Filmmaking versus Animation\" thread: https://forum.reallusion.com/FindPost354832.aspx\n\nANIMATING TO A SCRIPT:\n\nIn this case, I wrote the script, nearly in its entirety, before starting any significant iClone work. So in that case, I was animating to a script.\n\nANIMATION CHALLENGES:\n\nBecause it involves singing to a music track, the normal audio-to-viseme method would not work - the music interfered with the words. It also meant the text-to-speech method would not work because the speed and timing would change drastically. My solution was to speak/chant the words into my microphone in time with the music for audio-to-viseme generation. It still took a lot of viseme cleanup to make it better. I think I did a pretty good job of cleaning up a few songs, and some parts turned out pretty well. The song in this scene represents a mediocre \"singing/viseme\" result. (A couple others were left in a horrible state because I of the project's deadline date.)\n\nThank you for pointing out your animation problems that inhibit you from (perfectly) following your \"Kidnap\" script.\n\nMy goal is improve my animation skill so that....(One Day I'm Handed a Script) and consistently meet deadlines.\n\nThe Pinhead projects is perfect for this.\n\nI like the \"Kidnap\" story and would practice....\n\nAfter blending mocap, removing the robotic animation, (Add secondary animation) and follow the script.\n\nI'd practice the fist part and not move forward until I get it right.\n\nIMO: Animation is the key to how well you tell any story.\n\nThere is a wealth of information on \"How To's for Storytelling\", but NOT for \"How to Do the Animation\" (with iClone)\n\nThank you for sharing this.\n\nBy justaviking - Thanks for the replies.\n\nI was trying to quote some of your comments and make specific replies, but the forum is having trouble getting the formatting right (even after pasting into and out of Notepad to remove any text formatting). So I'll be a bit more random in my responses...\n\nFirst of all, thank you for the kind comments about the \"story\" and the \"characters.\" Although I do care about the technical aspects, I personally put \"story\" first, and then the remainder usually suffers from a deadly combination of lack of time and lack of skill. But your ability to endure the technical shortcomings and enjoy the story means a lot to me, so thanks again.\n\nSpiny Normal has a way with words, and made some amusing comments, such as his colorful description of the landscape. I agree. There are trees floating a meter above the ground, and other issues too. That was the first landscape I ever tried to sculpt, and I did manage to make a \"cliff by the sea\" which was important to the script. But the rest of it is, once again, only a pre-vis quality. The road is simply a textured plane added over and over again. It tells the story, but that's about it.\n\nIf you watch some of the exterior scenes at the theater, you might notice a fire escape stairway comes and goes. I thought it would be a good addition, but I didn't get it added to all my scenes consistently. This is where the ability to externally reference an object (like we can with some textures) would be great. Then I could update the master item, and all my scenes would inherit the updated copy the next time I render. For a while I thought Pinhead should tie a rope to the fire escape and around his waist, in case he fell, (and especially for Alura to hold onto), but thinking about the technical issues of trying to animate a rope took it out of the script. And there's a bit more peril without the safety rope, so I guess that's okay anyway.\n\nThe \"singing\" idea was chosen as a conscious decision to \"do something different.\" The movie \"Mama Mia\" used a similar concept with classic Abba songs.\n\nPinhead and Viking do indeed have a backstory. I used Viking (Lars) in a previous Pinhead video, and Viking was literally stabbed in the back and nearly died. In that story, you learn that Viking was a \"special forces\" military guy who is now more like a private detective. It was a lot of fun to reference that, and hopefully I did it in a way that didn't require you to see the earlier movie. It was also fun to show that they were childhood friends, though it's a bit amusing that they haven't changed clothes in at least 25 years. LOL. Once again, time limitations - and the lack of Character Creator - pushed me into simply scaling their bodies a bit.\n\nI'm glad the voice acting was acknowledged. One of my daughters did the voice of Alura, and I think she did a fine job. A a coworker (Mo) did the villain. I recorded Mo in a conference room at work, and in a couple places you can hear the footsteps of people walking by in the hall. Later, wearing headphones and listening to Mo and me talking between takes, was quite an experience. The contrast between our voices was so astounding, and wow, my voice sounds so wimpy next to his. And that laugh of his, piped directly into my ears, I loved it. I didn't know Mo very well at the time, and was unsure about asking him to do a voice-over for my video (and he's a big, intimidating guy). As you can imagine, he's been told before that he should do some \"voice acting\" and was very excited about it. It was also interesting to \"direct\" someone I didn't know very well, but I made myself do it, and he responded wonderfully as we did several takes of each scene. He also provided some great suggestions and inspiration on a couple of lines. We both got a bit of amusement that he, a black guy, was doing the voice-over of a white character. His only complaint was he didn't like when I named the villain \"Vernon.\" I think Mo felt the name was a bit lame. Oh well. As an actor, he had to accept it (even though he could crush me with his bare hands if he wanted to, LOL).\n\nRegarding feedback from friends and relatives... I find they can be both your harshest critics and they can also be overly kind.\n\nThanks again for the comments. I love conversations like this, including critiques. I better go eat now before my lunchtime is over. By uncwee -\n\njustaviking (1/19/2018) ...But your ability to endure the technical shortcomings and enjoy the story means a lot to me, so thanks again.\n\nNo... Thank You! Please continue sharing your work.\n\nYour work keeps my head on straight.\n\nI will take any story... any thought or idea... and practice the animation (to get it correct).\n\n...then everything comes together (following any script).\n\nYour work shows me exactly what animation problems I face using iClone to follow a script.\n\nI personally put \"story\" first, and then the remainder usually suffers from a deadly combination of lack of time and lack of skill.\n\nFrom my Weakness (Point of View):\n\nI refuse to put anything first, second, third, etc..\n\n\"I know the better I learn to animate... the better I can tell any story and follow any script.\"\n\nI know my weakness (Animating)...and will work on it, relentlessly.\n\nI have a long way to go and a lot to learn...\n\nThanks Again.\n\nBy justaviking -\n\njustaviking (1/19/2018) For a while I thought Pinhead should tie a rope to the fire escape and around his waist, in case he fell, (and especially for Alura to hold onto), but thinking about the technical issues of trying to animate a rope took it out of the script. And there's a bit more peril without the safety rope, so I guess that's okay anyway.\n\nANIMATING TO A SCRIPT\n\nBack to that idea, I thought about my \"rope\" story and it reminded me that sometimes the script has to adapt to budget, technical, and schedule constraints.\n\nWhether in animation or live filming, everything has a cost. That city-wide car chase scene that damages 300 vehicles is expensive in both worlds.\n\nOn a positive note, sometimes being forced to rewrite something results in a better product in the end. What you don't show (but allude to) can be as important as what you do show. And replacing a 3-minute scene with a 20-second scene might improve the pace and timing.\n\nOr, on a negative note, it might cause you to cancel the project and shop for a new script. So it's always good to try and think those things through in your pre-production meetings, even if you are the only person in the room.\n\n@Uncwe\n\nEven when my work can serve as an example of mistakes to avoid, I'm okay with that.\n\nRegarding not putting one aspect of a project ahead of the other, it's a great goal, but I don't think it's physically possible to focus on everything at one time, especially as an individual. Especially if you don't want your 5-minute video to take a year to produce. It's also a matter of passion and personal interest. Some people love lighting, or camera work, or editing, or clothing, or modeling props.

I want to gain the animation experience to follow these changes.\n\nBy justaviking - @Uncwe - I think I understand what you're saying. You want to be more productive with iClone, right? All I can suggest is to spend serious time with it. I find it is becoming a larger and larger application, and that's both a blessing and a curse.\n\niClone can do so much, and do it well, but It's difficult to be proficient in everything it has to offer. Some of the features require a bit of a deep-dive, such as the new PopcornFX plug-in. Even time-saving features like Faceware require some time and practice before you get the good results it is capable of producing.\n\nGood luck, and always remember there are a lot of kind people here to help answer questions (when they're not busy reading my long-winded posts). By uncwee -\n\njustaviking (1/19/2018) @Uncwe - I think I understand what you're saying. You want to be more productive with iClone, right?\n\nYes.\n\njustaviking (1/19/2018)I am writing in response to this post in the \"Filmmaking versus Animation\" thread: https://forum.reallusion.com/FindPost354832.aspx\n\nWhen you posted this...... the thread contains massive info for film making ideas.\n\njustaviking (1/19/2018)\n\nANIMATING TO A SCRIPT:\n\nIn this case, I wrote the script, nearly in its entirety, before starting any significant iClone work. So in that case, I was animating to a script.\n\nWhen I saw this... I'd hope the justaviking thread would contain \"Animation\" talk of \"How-To\"...follow a script using iclone animation tools.\n\nThank You for the advice.\n\nBy Delerna - Time.\n\nYes for me that is the thing that controls what I do for what it is that I am trying learn.\n\nI have stated that I don't think high quality animation is that important for good story telling. It's not that I don't think that good animation is not important. Movies with good interesting stories, high quality graphics and excellent animation are definitely the best movies.\n\nIt's just for me at the moment high guality animation is not the most important thing. I am already confident that if I put enough time into it I can do reasonably good animation.\n\nI have spent a lot of time in the past working on animation without worrying too much about good graphics and interesting story telling because I could not do neither and I needed to learn how to use iClone and part of that is animating things. I am now reasonably confident with what I can do there but I am at the point now that I am not at all confident I can make an interesting story of my own.\n\nNow, in order for me to get there I need to practice how to make interesting stories, part of which is doing animations that help tell the story, but not necessarily doing great looking animation. That is why I say things like I have seen many cartoon movies with very simple graphics and animations that I totally loved watching. That's why it is learning how to create good stories that I am focussed on for now and that's what I want to spend my time on and not slow down my learning process for that by spending too much time doing what I am confident that I can already do if I put enough time into it. I know I am not going to be able to make a movie I can publish professionally. I am in the learning process of how to make interesting movies, once I feel comfortable with my abilities on that then maybe one day in the future I will be able to write a story that I think might make it to the professional world? I don't think I ever will (getting too old for one thing) but if I ever did, If I felt the story I am working on was worth the effort to perfect everything as much as I can, then that is when I would spend my time on everything for that movie.\n\nSo, the point I am trying to make in my comments is not that animation perfection is not an important task for making movies.\n\nRather, for us work work as one person movie makers, it is that we each need to work according to what it is we are trying to learn or achieve.\n\nAnyone who is confident with story telling but not animation then maybe animation is what they need to spend the majority of their time on.\n\nAnyone confident with animation but not story telling then learning to tell stories is what they should spent the majority of their time on.\n\nAnyone confident with animation and story telling but not graphics..........\n\nIf you are fortunate enough to be effective with all of it then doing all of the above to make movies for professional release maybe what you should spend your time on.\n\nBut in the first 3 cases doing videos and showing them here between us who are all trying to learn the things needed to make good videos can be enjoyable or poor for us to watch.\n\nThe video might help us to improve our own abilities regardless of whether they are good or bad.\n\nAlso comments made by others can assist our improvement regardless of whether we agree or disagree with their comment.\n\nGoing above what I wanted to say in this next comment but\n\nI have seen so many times, so called expert animators coming here telling us how stupid we all are for posting our low level videos and hoping to see good comments.\n\nWell pthhhhhhhhhhh to them. If we were as expert as they think they are then maybe we wouldn't be posting our videos here. Maybe we would be working at publishing them professionally.\n\nFinally I just want to thank the people and express my appreciation for the help they have provided in posts such as here and in filmmaking verses animation and so many other topics.\n\nThe comments made have assisted me with getting started with learning to tell good stories. Will it work for me? I don't know, I shall see.\n\nBy justaviking -\n\nuncwee (1/19/2018)\n\njustaviking (1/19/2018)\n\nANIMATING TO A SCRIPT:\n\nIn this case, I wrote the script, nearly in its entirety, before starting any significant iClone work. So in that case, I was animating to a script.\n\nWhen I saw this... I'd hope the justaviking thread would contain \"Animation\" talk of \"How-To\"...follow a script using iclone animation tools.\n\nThank You for the advice.\n\nI hope I didn't disappoint you too badly, but you do make a good point.\n\nLet me see if I can at least begin to partially address it, and perhaps others will join it.\n\n(Maybe someone will even decide they have something useful enough to post that it justified starting a dedicated thread.)\n\nFirst, are you animating your own script or someone else's?\n\nAnd, are you animating for someone else (probably, but necessarily, the person who wrote the script) or for yourself?\n\nAssuming you are doing this for someone else, then some for of storyboarding and/or mock-ups will be valuable. You want to be sure you have a common vision.\n\nStoryboard or not, you then want to assess:\n\n- The length of the video\n\n- The sets, environments, and props required... indoor, outdoor, number of locations\n\n- How many characters are needed\n\n- Are special skills needed that you haven't used before (PopcornFX, PhysX, Global Illumination, and other tools like Blender or Photoshop)\n\n- How much time are you willing to dedicate to the project, and maybe even actual money (for props, etc.)\n\nThen... start.\n\nShare your work in progress (WIP) to ensure you and your \"customer\" are still aligned.\n\nI'm not sure what else to say. In general, you need to make projects. Start small and simple. Gradually add complexity (more/better lighting, PBR props, special effects, character-to-prop interaction, character-to-character interaction, speaking, facial animation, blending motions... the list goes on and on). You can do all that with one and two-minute projects. Then when a script comes along, you'll have the skills available to make nearly any movie you can envision.\n\nAN EXAMPLE OF ANIMATING TO SOMEONE ELSE'S SCRIPT\n\nLastly, and I should have thought of this earlier, I have animated to someone else's script.\n\nThis was done for someone who was launching a real estate services web site, and they wanted a few introductory and explanatory videos, 30 to 60 seconds long.\n\nWe spent a fair amount of time working on the look of the spokes person... hair style, dress, body style, etc.\n\nThe wrote the script, I made a few minor suggestions (some incorporated, some rejected), and I did the animation.\n\nThis was done in iClone 6 with Character Creator.\n\nI will say there are things I would like to do over again, and some things I would like to change, but overall it was a success.\n\nHere is one of the 30-second spots:\n\nThat video is in a playlist:\n\n- Videos 1-6 are 60-second clips (\"Rev B\")\n\n- Videos 7 and 8 are 30-second clips\n\n- Videos 9-14 are \"Rev A\" of videos 1-6\n\n- Videos 15 and 16 include technical bloopers\n\n- Video 16 is the very first WIP\n\nAnimation (technical) notes:\n\n- All hand-animated. No motion capture. No facial capture.\n\n- Interactions with the web pages was a fun challenge\n\n- Issues with the hair and dress (see blooper videos) made it a challenge\n\nFilmmaking notes:\n\n- Originally, it was envisioned to have a much grander \"fly-in\" with the camera. At least that is what I envisioned, and I think the customer liked the idea too. But it took too much time, and for a short \"web\" video, it risks losing the viewer before the video even started. You can't have the opening scene from \"The Sound of Music\" for a 60-second commercial. So the opening segment was drastically shortened, which was a good call. By uncwee - ...delete By uncwee -\n\nFirst, are you animating your own script or someone else's?\n\nNeither\n\nAnd, are you animating for someone else...\n\nNo.\n\nFrom the Start....\n\nI'm not trying to write a story, movie, nor film.\n\nMy goal is simple to understand, yet difficult (For ME) to achieve.\n\nI get great satisfaction when \"Animation\" comes together for a specific \"Idea\".\n\nIt doesn't matter what the animation is... so long as I make it fit that specific need.\n\nYour Kidnap story or rampa's Kitchen Scene story... or any story / script.\n\nExample 1: (Animate Upper Body Motion)\n\nNow Change upper body motion.\n\nAdding secondary animation.\n\n(Animate - NOT blend mocap)\n\nExample 2: (Animate Lower Body Motion)\n\nNow Change lower body motion.\n\nAdding secondary animation.\n\n(Animate - NOT blend mocap)\n\nExample 3: (Full Body Motion)\n\nA simple walk..... stumble and fall.\n\nNow animate the character... Standing Up.\n\nAdding secondary animation.\n\n(NOT Blend mocap to stand up).\n\nLearning these steps would allow me to quickly blend mocap and (Adjust it properly)\n\nNow I'm ready to follow a script.\n\n...was hoping seasoned iclone users would show me (A Better Way) to produce awesome iclone animation.\n\nBy animagic - The reason (for me) to start out with a story is to keep things interesting for myself.\n\nAnd while animating the story, I am confronted with problems/challenges I have to solve (how do I animated this or that). I learn by trying to solve those animation challenges. This is the opposite of leaning in a systematic way. Of course, there is nothing against that if that fits your learning style.\n\nI got some rudimentary animation training, but never in character animation, and it took my a long time before I could produce something worthwhile. And, still, every new movie is a learning opportunity.\n\nI will now talk a bit about the script. The other thread revealed some differences in opinion between Dennis and me about structure. To clarify, I'm not against structure, I just don't believe that there is a single fits-all story structure. However, for longer projects, I do write a script, which you can think of as a blueprint of sorts for the movie. It is not the movie itself, but it helps you focus. When you work alone, and there is nobody to tell you what to do, the script is a great help, because it will tell you the next step and keep you straight. While working on your script, you can also envision how you are going to visualize this or that.\n\nWhich brings me to another point: the action has to take place somewhere, and I find it helpful to have a model of the environment. It's like in a storyboard, but for me it's easier to just do something in iClone rather than trying to draw.\n\nIt's way past my bedtime, but as you can see there are many ways in which to approach a movie. And, sometimes, it's good to challenge yourself to the extreme, as Dennis has done for his Pinhead contribution. By justaviking - @Uncwee - I am not sure there is a solid, linear answer to \"How to animate.\" There are so many aspects and layers to the task. Different people have different workflows.\n\nI do suggest watching some of Reallusion's webinars, if you haven't' already.\n\nhttps://www.reallusion.com/customersupport/user/webinar_archive.html\n\nThe \"iClone 7.1 Curve Editor Fun\" webinar is the one that was mentioned a couple of times in the \"Filmmaking versus animation\" thread.\n\nActually, you may already be on the correct path more than you realize. Pick a task, and try to accomplish it. It could be almost anything:\n\n- Pick up a coffee cup and take a drink (without animating the coffee - at least not the first time)\n\n- Walk up a stairway\n\n- Shake hands with another character\n\n- Give a short, but emotional speech with lots of facial expressions\n\n- Walk around a kitchen, from the fridge to the sink\n\n- Practice lighting (sit by a campfire at night, and office space, a romantic dinner, burning desert sun...)\n\nThen start combining those things. If you can do that, you're ready for almost anything.\n\nAs you work on each individual skill, and encounter issues or questions, come to the forum with specific questions.\n\nAdditional thoughts:\n\n- Showcase what you're best at\n\n- Work on your greatest weakness\n\n- Try something you've never done before\n\n@Animagic,\n\nThough we have differing approaches, I think we're still fairly close in many regards. Some of it might be more \"in our heads\" versus \"on paper,\" but our thought processes might be similar.\n\nTo be clear on one thing (you probably understand me, but there are others reading too), I've made it abundantly clear that I generally favor the concept of \"structure,\" especially when writing longer stories, but I'm not promoting \"The One\" magical structure for writing. I don't think there is one specific format that ensures success. But the longer and more complex a story is, the more useful it is to have a roadmap to help you not get lost and improve your odds of success.\n\nYour methodology has worked well for you, as I've enjoyed your stories.\n\nBy uncwee -\n\njustaviking (1/20/2018) @Uncwee - I am not sure there is a solid, linear answer to \"How to animate.\"\n\nIt makes since to start with a story or script. It keeps one grounded.\n\nTake your Kidnap video:\n\nYou first animation...\n\n1. Remove the \"Robotic\" motions.\n\n2. Add \"Secondary\" motions.\n\nThese two steps would bring new life to that video.\n\nNobody talks about animation steps.... only say.... look here. Why?\n\nCan you remove the \"Robotic\" motions and add \"Secondary\" motions?\n\n...if so, is the reason you did not perform this steps is because of (Lack of Time)?\n\nI'm hoping you can perform these steps and \"Explain how you would initiate them.\"\n\nBy Kelleytoons - (Character) Animation steps:\n\n1. Any voice work first (why? Because it's much harder to add/refine the proper lip sync if other animation is present with the face).\n\n2. Facial emotion next (why? Because if you are moving the character around you can't get the face right unless you trick it with something like a face-attached camera)\n\n3. Body motions next.\n\n4. Hand motions last (hand positions support body and face motions to tell the story)\n\n5. Now set camera angles and positions -- you don't want the camera moving at all while you are animating your character.\n\nNote that any or all of the above \"rules\" can be violated -- one might, if one knows the camera is not going to show a character's face, set up the camera shots first and then, from another camera that doesn't move around, you can do the above steps -- but in general these are good guidelines for doing character animation. It's what we follow for 2D work, and serves well for 3D.\n\nHow you do any or all of the above depends on the tools you have -- if you have Faceware, for example, you'd be foolish not to at least lay down a first pass at lip sync with it. Same goes for body mocap -- while it may never be the end product, if you have a good mocap setup you will want to use it whenever possible to capture subtle and natural body movements. But those specifics CAN be found on various tutorials linked to here and elsewhere. By uncwee - Kellytoons,\n\nThanks for the steps.\n\nFor step 3... Body motions.\n\nIf you didn't have a mocap system in place... Blending mocap sounds like the way to go.\n\nBut, how would you add secondary animation to each clip?\n\nMaking sure the end result has no robotic behavior.\n\nBy Kelleytoons - You're basically asking \"how do I animate?\" because whether it's body motions, or a car moving along the screen, the mechanics are the same.\n\nWith body motions you move a limb, move some amount of frames, move it again (more properly you move parts of the limb at different speeds and at different frames). With the curve editor you set the right curves so the motion works correctly (although you *can* do this manually -- a curve editor just reduces the work and amount of keys necessary to create the proper motion.\n\nAll of this is true with or without mocap, and with or without other motions from libraries. It's just the basics of animating, and the first thing you should learn and practice (even with just a simple sphere -- as I said, the principles are exactly the same).\n\nThere are some AMAZING books on doing all this, but the one that should be in EVERY SINGLE ANIMATOR'S POSSESSION is Richard Williams' The Animator's Survival Kit (I'll put an Amazon link to it at the end). This book is the bible for ALL animators, and if an animator doesn't have it (or, worse, has never heard of it) I immediately know they are no animator but an amateur who WANTS to be an animator (nothing wrong with that, but if you are serious you will need this book).\n\nI have TWO copies -- my first is basically worn out (it's fallen apart over the years) although I keep it because my notes in it I don't feel like duplicating. I am never without one within arm's reach.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Animators-Survival-Kit-Richard-Williams/dp/0571202284\n\nBy uncwee - Kellytoons,\n\nThank you for responding. I need to explain that I have practiced animation for quite some time now.\n\nI know how to animate... secondary motion...with ease.\n\nI'd really like to apply what I've learned.... using iclone animation tools.\n\nMy problem is:\n\nUnable to find any... controllers on iclone avatars.\n\nUnable to switch (rotation) Euler to TCB and (position) Position_XYZ to Bezier.\n\nDon't look forward to actually animating.... bone by bone.\n\nBone by bone would take forever.\n\nAm I missing something here? Is this how one would actually animate (Characters) in iclone?\n\nBy toystorylab - THE ANIMATORS SURVIVAL KIT as pdf:\n\nhttp://www.floobynooby.com/pdfs/The_Animators_Survival_Kit.pdf\n\nBy uncwee - Kellytoons,\n\nMy question to you was...\n\nuncwee (1/20/2018)\n\nhow would you add secondary animation to each clip?\n\nMaking sure the end result has no robotic behavior.\n\nUsing iclone animation tools.\n\nBone by bone?\n\nBy Kelleytoons - No shortcuts to good animation.\n\nThe curve editor helps, though. I assume you've bought that. By wires - Me thinks that uncwee has been swooooping around here before. By Kelleytoons - Gerry,\n\nYipes -- have I been fooled? Usually I pick up on it MUCH sooner.\n\nIn any case, either way, I am done with that particular conversation.

I have come up with a basic script that I think will be an interesting short story that will show some capabilities of the new popcorn magic partical effects as well as some of the original partical effects. I'm hoping it will only take me a few weeks to complete it but it remains to be seen if I will be good enough to make it well By TonyDPrime - A few years back doing some 2D-art, messing around for a laugh I sent a 1 page comic to a group of friends, one of which who actually draws and does 2D art work for a living also.\n\nHe told me that I had jumped right in to the characters to soon, and that I should always open with a description of the environment to bring the reader in to the setting (i.e. a pic of the environment scene...).\n\nWhether it's true or not I don't know, but I had never considered it.\n\nAlso, GIFs are terribly fun to watch....LOL...so much for script!\n\n-Regards all!

Getting together for a Skype wasn't entering in to the equation, so that meant mails, mails and even more mails.\n\nIt also meant that Alley and I had to constantly upload/download project files, props etc. and this became major issue Nr.2. iClone is not designed for easy cooperation work. Each and every person working on a project needs to own every asset involved in order to even be able to render out a draft video clip for proofing by others. For this reason we were forced to use mostly default assets and assets obtained as freebies or converted through 3DXchange, although we did end up having to both purchase several items for the projects.\n\nMystery Manor was produced in 2007 using iClone 2.0/2.5 and had a running time of 25 mins. including credits, and we were both very happy that 3DXchange 1.0 had been released before we started work.\n\nThe voice talents all came from members of the unfortunately now defunct Video Friends Forum - VFF. The script/story board provided by Brian was, to say the least, visually complicated and we had to remind him that we weren't using the same resources as I L&M - a situation that repeated itself in the following projects.\n\nAlley and I did some rough setups before we got the final voice files, and that's when things REALLY started to nudge me to asking questions such as \"Why are you doing this to yourself, you're a sane person?\", \"This isn't going to work, when are you going to admit it and give up?\"\n\nWe are talking iClone 2.0/2.5 that had just added Clone Cloth, talking Avatars and Linkage between Objects and Characters. Animating Characters, sliding feet and all, still was a very difficult task, and the amount of usable motion file was at a very minimum for what we needed. Putting a 25 min. video together was still a very daunting adventure that, IMHO, worked very well in the end.\n\nThere was much tearing of hair and a fair amount of frustration on my part during the production, but with a lot of visual \"tricks\", and a minimum of SFX we ended up not only with what Brian had expected, but with something that was in the end a great learning experience for all involved.\n\nAlley was the driving force during the production, and she was never lost in finding a solution to a supposed impossible task. She was also able to \"sell\" Brian small changes to the story board when we just knew that it wasn't going to happen in iClone as it was at that time.\n\nIn all the 3 productions demonstrated not only the difficulties of having a very small team doing everything, but also offered each of us the possibility to \"Go the Mile\" with what we had at hand and make it work.\n\nI can imagine just what we could have done with \"Mystery Manor\" in iClone 7 - I still have all my old project/prop/avatar files, who knows.\n\nBy mark - I had to animate to a script for this commercial project last year. Very simple as you can see...but they did allow me a little creative freedom to add some silly touches of my own...\n\nBy Kelleytoons - Gerry,\n\nYou mentioned one thing and I'm curious to do some checking from others far more knowledgeable here (my knowledge of DRM is sketchy to say the least, since I think I've bought everything in the world RL has ever sold): can't folks work on files with DRM stuff in them? I thought that what happened was there was a watermark on the items (so no renders) but otherwise you could indeed work with them. Perhaps I'm way off track here, though.\n\nIf the watermark is the only issue then content sharing isn't such a big deal, as the person who owns the content could do the final render. But if there is no way to open and/or share things with watermarks, then it's obviously a bigger concern.\n\nNowadays, aside from CC, nearly all the assets I buy are from Daz -- just superior quality/price/theming -- and those wouldn't be an issue sharing other than morally (but a \"share\" for a community or group project shouldn't be a moral issue per se as long as the final render was done by the owner -- again, I'm open for discussion on this but if a set or prop is used merely as a \"placeholder\" for someone doing other work, I can't really even see a moral position as a problem there).\n\nMostly just curious -- my days of collaborating are long past. By wires - Mike,\n\nThe problems that we ran in to using DRM assets really forced both of us to own the items.\n\nAlley did all of the final renders and music mixes, I delivered scenes/projects containing DRM locked assets for the final edit. We had decided from the beginning that the final render would be done by one person in order to keep the quality of the video as high as possible, and to avoid any Codec problems. I uploaded all my completed project files for Alley and she needed to have ownership of the content to do the render.\n\nOn the other hand she produced scenes that also contained DRM content that I didn't own, so it didn't matter who did the final render - that person needed to own every asset used in the production. Trying to do a preview render of a scene containing DRM locked items isn't possible, so again the person needed to own everything included.\n\nThis is one of the greatest problems that prevents iClone from becoming a software for use in truly professional group projects - each and every person involved in the production needs to have a purchased copy of every asset on their PC to make it work.\n\nBy Kelleytoons - Okay, but Gerry, you seem to be saying what I was saying -- namely, that folks who didn't own the assets could work with them just fine, but it's only the person doing the final render that needs them.\n\nWith the realtime nature of iClone, I don't know why you'd even need to do a preview, although you could (and with DRM you usually just get some words that won't interfere with judging what needs to be adjusted). Again, I don't see this as a problem in production as long as the final producer owns all (which sounds right anyway).\n\nBut, as I said, I won't collaborate anymore, so it's more of an intellectual discussion for me (my curiosity extends to a lot of things I will never do :&gt By wires - Just to clarify the situation regarding the use of \"Trial\" DRM locked assets in iClone. A user can test the assets for as long and often as he/she wishes - the same user can not however save a project file containing said assets.\n\nThe following message appears when attempting to save such a project:\n\nFor any user contemplating participation in a collaboration project, be aware that you will need to purchase any and all assets that may be used in any part of the production that you are working on.\n\niClone is, and will remain, a one-person production tool - except for the rich.\n\nBy Kelleytoons - Ah, gotcha. Thanks for the clarification.\n\nYeah, they ought to at least allow a proxy type setting (that's what we used to do in our production work -- not so much for DRM but just for resources. I still don't understand why iClone doesn't manage memory better -- if you hide an object it ought to reduce the memory requirements, particularly if there are no physics on that object). By animagic - It is not advertised, but RL has/had an option to purchase assets that can be shared, at least they used to if I recall correctly. That might have been for an educational setting. By Spiny Norman -\n\nNot putting down anyones posts here but, there seems to be a confused notion that professional 'scripts'\n\ncontain full shot breakdowns and are a complete written description of the film.\n\nI believe this stems from the 60's/70's trend of printing books of so-called 'shooting' scripts of various\n\nfamous films.\n\nAlthough in some cases these were, actual reproductions of real shooting scripts, somehow this became the\n\nassumed norm for scriptwriting amongst the uninitiated.\n\nAsk any professional writer what happened after they handed in a script with anything but the teeniest,\n\nabsolutely vitally necessary, shot recommendation and after they stop shaking, they may be able to tell\n\nyou, wide eyed, through clenched teeth…\n\nThe 'shooting' script is nearly always the same script that all members of cast and crew possess, but with\n\ncopious notes about shots/ camera lenses/ lighting where applicable/ and camera moves, often compiled by\n\nboth director and the lighting cameraman; but certainly by the director.\n\nSometimes they come in a two page format with storyboards on one page and description on the other, but\n\nagain only for the director and lighting cameraman.\n\n(It is these annotated scripts together with a full shot list that are put together and released as 'shooting'\n\nscripts although the formatting is often changed to make a more readable experience.)\n\nMost of the time from pre-production up to post-production, the script is a sparse description of where we\n\nare and when, dialogue and occasional important moves…\n\nI'll include here, an excerpt from Harold Pinters award winning script of 'The Servant'. This is the script that\n\nthe director is given. What happens to it next, is what makes the difference between a good director, and a 'great' one!..\n\nThe Servant\n\nExterior. Knightsbridge Square.

Other than that, I think your comments were good.\n\nIn my mind, when I think of a \"script\" I am usually thinking of the \"spec script\" format, which has a bare minimum of \"directing\" in it. In that context, camera shots and notes to the actors (parentheticals, typically) should be used very sparingly and only when necessary. You are writing a story, and it is up to the director to \"envision\" how it will be told and what it will look like.\n\nShooting and planning scripts are different beasts indeed. Thank you for pointing that out. They can be used to highlight different locations, special effects, camera setups, and other items that can affect cost and other important things.\n\nThanks again for pointing out that there are different types of scripts for different purposes.

I was 7 minutes into it, when budgeting revealed that my costs for professional voice actors would amount to, at the least $7000….\n\n(amateur voices…amateur acting! The End.)\n\n(Sad smiley face.)\n\n(I am saving up…)\n\nMy only interest is in long form/or 'extraordinary' short form projects. So at present, I am working on a script based on a 12 page short story. As the story was a first person recollection, I am having to change everything to a third person perspective. I am not so much re-writing, as writing the stuff that my character thought was unimportant to his perception of what he thought was happening to him. There are only 2 characters so voices are no longer a problem…I am 3 pages into the story, 4 pages into the script and 8 minutes into the project ( …the story has a slow build like 'Chinatown' or Taxidriver'…where, by the time you understand what is going on, it's already too late.). I am hoping to bring this in at around 60'ish minutes….but if it flies like I think it might…it may run longer?..\n\nHere is a completed segment of my first ever IClone' project, (started in 5, tweaked in 6, abandoned…because of production issues….See above.) …the sound is shit…and there is much that needs tweaking…but I can't wait till I have the $$$ to get my voices….(justaviking, get all those others from our previous posts to have a look…This is what I am trying for…and better,,,) I have had a problem with IClone ever since I added Faceware, and have been unable to do anything… I have been waiting 2 weeks and still no solution!

I can't speak for anyone else, but I create worlds…I just wish my operating system and my software would let me get on with that?…\n\nBy Kelleytoons - Can I give you some practical advice from someone who has worked with actors for many, many decades now? Actors LOVE to act, and there are many, MANY talented folks out there who, while not making a living at acting, love to practise their craft and are quite good at it even if they've never made a dollar.\n\nThat's why every single city, town, burg or whistlestop here in the U.S. has community theater. Where I live (where \"active\" adults live in restricted communities) there are also acting \"groups\" in every little development (so hundreds within 60 miles). I don't know if you live in this country or not, but I have to believe that this desire to act extends across cultures and countries.\n\nFor us here all you have to do is go to one of the tryouts they have four or five times a year, where these \"non-professionals\" act for the pure joy of it. Only a few will get picked, and even of those who do many will want to act for you. Bring along your portable recorder (nowadays the small digital ones that fit in a pocket are superb at capturing voices) or, if you have Faceware, your cellphone (which is plenty for the video needed) and have them record your script for you. Better, get their names and numbers and arrange times for you to come out to meet them (they are doing you a favor) to record your stuff.\n\nThere are no end of very good voice actors out there -- our own little group (recorded in my community of less than around 800 people, so out of that I found 10-15 very good voice actors) was so good Fox offered us a contract (actually two, but that's a long story). If those voices are good enough for American television, then you can find similar or better ones yourself. Do NOT let the lack of voice actors stop you, as it's one of the easiest things to solve. By wires - There are a lot of talented voice actors available on TMUnderground.\n\nBy justaviking - +1 to what KelleyToons said.\n\nThe various computer-generated voices may have their place, but don't replace people.* Even a person of moderate talent can be more than adequate for most projects, especially if there is something distinctive about his or her voice.\n\nBe sure you use some decent recording equipment in a nice, quiet location with limited echo. There are some microphones** in the $80-150 range that will do a nice job (far superior to the junk that's built into a laptop). Lately I've used a walk-in closet as a recording studio because all the clothes help absorb any echo. Even then, I still run it through Audacity (free audio software) to remove any remaining background hiss. I've been quite pleased with the results.\n\n*Computer-generated voices\n\nOne personal exception for me has been \"Pinhead,\" but that's only because he started that way, and to me his \"flat delivery\" was, at times, part of his charm. Even when other characters used live voices, I sort of liked Pinhead using Text-to-speech (TTS). Having said that, I understand people who don't have a 7-year history with Pinhead wouldn't understand that, and it is nice to have him be able to emote better. I've even used my own voice a couple of times (modified a bit using Audacity), so I probably won't go back to TTS.\n\n** Microphones\n\nI have a Samson Meteor mic (~$70 at Best Buy or Amazon).\n\nPro - Very beautiful (looks like a piece of art), very sensitive. Note that there is a threaded base, so you can mount it on a boom or mic stand if you don't want to use the folded legs (which have nice rubber non-slip pads that work well).\n\nCon - My main complaint is it is almost too sensitive, and too omnidirectional, so it easily picks up echo and background sounds. It also lacks a gain control (recording level) knob, so you can only adjust that in your recording software (again, I use Audacity). The \"volume knob\" is for headphones if you want to monitor the recording session.\n\nThe Blue Yeti mic is one I'd probably buy if I didn't already have my Samson mic ($110 at Best Buy or Amazon).\n\nPro - Three \"sensitivity patterns\" to select from to help pick up or minimize sound from different directions, a gain control button, and lots of good reviews. This one can also be mounted on a boom or mic stand.\n\nCon - Costs more than the Samson\n\nBy Kelleytoons - I have the Yeti -- it's kind of the universal computer mic nowadays, and works very well (I constructed, for around $30, a sound box for it so I can record decent audio with it in my computer room, which otherwise has terrible acoustics).\n\nBut I also like very much the sound you can get from the portable digital recorders -- I have both a Zoom and a Tascam that produce superb sound, and can be taken anywhere. The Zoom is what we recorded ALL our audio for for the Fox show, and it was more than adequate.
