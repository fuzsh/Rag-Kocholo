Our latest data shows a significant increase in consumer spending among Visa cardholders during the Opening Ceremony Weekend.\n\n“We’re particularly pleased to see the uptick in spending at French small businesses after we helped 13 million of them digitize over the last 4 years in Europe and connected them to spectators through the Visa Go app.\n\n“The increased engagement of younger generations, which we see in the travel data, is also an exciting finding and shows the reach and relevance of the Games today and into the future.”\n\nVisa’s responsibility to provide payment systems for the Olympic and Paralympic Games requires a robust and venue-specific plan combined with large-scale operations. Working hand-in-hand with the Organizing Committee for the last three years, Visa has built a custom payment network across Paris and beyond, which ensures Visa contactless payments are accepted at 3,500 points of sale across 32 Olympic venues and 16 Paralympic venues.\n\nVisa has launched the Visa Go app to connect spectators and tourists with local businesses during the Games.
