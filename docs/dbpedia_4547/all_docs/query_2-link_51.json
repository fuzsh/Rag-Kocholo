        "text": "Introduction\n\nI go to a lot of garage/rummage sales in search of gaming gems. Frequently, I'll see a box of old PC games that are a buck each and say \"I'll give you $5 for the whole box\". It was through a transaction like this that I acquired a copy of Crime Wave. It's a N.A.R.C. rip-off for the PC that was released in 1990 by the now defunct Access Software. The game itself was alright for the time. The box art, however, is the worst that was ever made. It's bad on many levels. The covers are comical and the description could win a Bulwer-Lytton award. I can't imagine anyone looking at it and thinking \"I want to shell out $50 for this\", I feel ripped-off getting it for ~25 cents.\n\nRoughly three years ago GameSpy did a Top 10 Worst Covers list. Everything on that list was from a console game otherwise I don't see how they could have missed this one. I looked at everything on that list and I don't think they can touch this atrocity.\n\nYes, I'm aware that the Angry Video Game Nerd did a similar review of an ad for Crime Wave. I posted this in 2006 when he was still the Angry Nintendo Nerd. I highly doubt he's seen this article.\n\nFront Cover\n\nHere's the front cover in all its glory (click on thumbnail for full-size image). There's a lot going on so we need to dissect into manageable chunks of badness.\n\nFirst off, we have an extremely lame guy in a pink karate uniform. Oh, and a killer mullet. Since everyone else in the game is apparently armed with automatic weapons it seems that karate guy is in for a bit-o-trouble. The will of the warrior doesn't stand much of a chance against burning hot 9mm rounds traveling a couple hundred miles per hour.\n\nNext up is a painter carrying one of the aforementioned automatic weapons. I bet he's named \"Gus\", call it a hunch.\n\nThen there's the crazy guy set against a large explosion. He appears to be the \"head\" bad-guy going out in a blaze of glory ala Scarface. Whatever he's yelling is in some broken mix of English and what he spoke as a young up-and-coming criminal. I imagine his insane rant contains the word \"paco\" several times.\n\nFront Insert\n\nFront Insert\n\nBack Cover\n\nRelated\n\nAll source code and software on this site is distributed under The MIT License (copyright 2000-2024 Hugues Johnson) unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll other content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll opinions on this site reflect my personal views and do not represent views of my current, or any former, employer.\n\nSite theme is based on Bootstrap licensed under The MIT License.
