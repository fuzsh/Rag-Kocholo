        "text": "Video games contain representations, and these can have effects on players, for example on the ways they understand certain concepts or see certain places. The purpose of this thesis is to delve into how Japan is represented in video games. With that target in mind, the video game Ôkami (Clover Studio, 2008) for Nintendo&#39;s Wii console has been analyzed as a case study, and the potential effects of its representations have been reflected on. In order to carry out this work, the context of the Japanese popular culture industry has been considered, while the particular perspective of a Japanophile has been adopted. The first concept refers to the combination of enterprises responsible of popularizing Japanese culture internationally through products (with manga, anime and video games as leaders) since the last years of the 20th century. Regarding Japanophiles, they are understood in this thesis as the most avid (non-Japanese) consumers of those products who, carried by a &#39;Japan...\n\nThe following abstract is aimed to put into question how both the Japanese and Western gaming industries have differentiated themselves so much today, offering game systems and narratives that vary widely from each other. In the history of the medium, this differentiation was initially established because some semiotic and mechanic elements were identified to identifiable Japanese or American market tastes. Most of the time, the reasons that have been made to explain this difference within the medium have relied on either essential cultural differences or market determinism based on historical preferences. However, this paper argues that these differences aren't just formed due to specific cultural images or economic reasons, but mainly because of the formation of an identity discourse on the industry that has ghettoized specific formulas of player engagement to some cultural regions or supposedly minority groups. In the case of Japanese video games, we argue that several design conventions on the part of Japanese game designers have led to a paradigm that is unique to their cultural context. This paradigm can be distinguished from the one prevalent in the West because it has usually favored games that rely more heavily on the use of what we call “explicit narratives” to contextualize their rules, which have been solidified into several known “game genres” like the JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Game), the “Visual Novel” and others. This paradigm was also highly influential in creating other genres that are ubiquitous in the medium today, specially during the era of the Japanese industrial dominance of the 80's and 90's. This model also encompass semiotic elements that are either textually related to other forms of Japanese media or have been used almost exclusively on Japanese video games. However, its presence has been reduced significantly today, to the point that it has become representative of games developed exclusively by the Japanese video game industry, even though it might be found outside that region. More so than that, it has been integrated within a bigger cultural discourse that identifies several forms of cultural artifacts as extensions of Japan into Western popular culture. Throughout this paper, we will explore the main elements that characterize this paradigm, including the concept of explicit narratives, and their manifestation on specific games. Finally, we will analyze its current influence on the development of the modern image of Japan, both in gamer consumer culture and the overall gaming industry today.\n\nThis article examines the development of the game industry in Japan and South Korea with particular attention to the role of the government in fostering a creative industrial sector. Although the Japanese game industry achieved market-oriented growth until the 1990s, the government's involvement in the industry became salient after the new millennium. Games were positioned as main sources for creating internationally competitive media contents, and the government has provided environments where innovative companies and individuals can develop their skills and expertises and intensified the protection of intellectual property rights overseas. Unlike Japan, the development of the game industry was sustained by intensive government intervention in South Korea. The government changed the basic perception of the industry from a negative amusement industry to a positive cultural industry to be fostered for the new millennium. Then, the government set up an affiliated organisation that undertook a wide range of measures from technological upgrading, managerial and human resource development, global connections, and education. Thus, the Korean state still intends to foster a strategic industry but its manner of commitments became comprehensive and flexible.\n\nUnlike other designed artefacts, video games are not commonly considered in relation to the cultural context of their creation. This lack of attention means that the impacts of these games, as embodiments of particular cultural ideas on the people who play them outside their country of origin, have not been investigated. Responding to this absence of scholarship, the following thesis uses a design history based analysis of Japanese video game producer Nintendo to illustrate the depth and degree to which games can embody and communicate cultural ideas. From this perspective, a number of Nintendo’s games can be seen as responding to their cultural surroundings as they are informed by, and provide a means to compensate for, several different forms of Japanese longing. Firstly, the Super Mario games respond to a desire to engage with the childlike, providing a means to satisfy a yearning for a playful and light-hearted encounter, made largely unavailable in Japan due to the pressures of education and adulthood. Secondly, the Legend of Zelda games build upon a longing to connect to a pre-modern environment, using a tactile connection with nature and a sense of community to enable a feeling of closeness to a past world separate from stressful contemporary urban Japanese lifestyles. Thirdly, the MOTHER/Earthbound games respond to a desire for authenticity, creating an unconventional reality to stimulate a genuine emotional connection that is more fulfilling than those typically experienced in contemporary Japan, where mediated and artificial relationships abound. Finally, the Metroid games satisfy a longing to connect with a stable and understandable future, in response to a number of fears uniquely pertinent to modern Japan. The impact of these embedded Japanese needs on the people who play them cross-culturally can be recognised by looking at the nostalgic culture which surrounds these games in the West. With the development of this sentimental retrospective view, a link has been created to the games’ inherent Japanese cultural qualities, causing these aspects to shape individuals’ nostalgic interactions. As the culture of video game nostalgia has been formed around the practice of crafting artefacts that borrow from the past but reconfigure it as part of a creative design process, through analysing the form and character of the objects which result, it is possible to see the way that they have been informed by the sentiments of Japanese longing central to the games. Through this examination it becomes clear that these Japanese cultural ideas have been internalised and then subsequently utilised by individuals in the West to fulfill their own desires. Combining case studies of Nintendo’s four most significant game series, an examination of Nintendo’s historical development, and an investigation into fan-created nostalgic works, this thesis uses a design history based analysis to illustrate how video games can exist as a reaction to their cultural surroundings and how this nature has an enduring impact on the people who play them.\n\nIn recent years, a huge amount of research has been undertaken to properly assess the development of the videogame medium on both a global and a local scale, with works that attempt to frame its history as a transnational process first and as a set of locally distinct frameworks of production and consumption second. A huge portion of that work has been dedicated to assessing the proper impact of Japanese videogames in the world, both as culturally neutral (or mukokuseki) products and as pieces of a particular media environment that is unique to Japanese pop culture. With this goal in mind, authors like Picard (2013), Pelletier-Gagnon (2015) and Navarro-Remesal and Loriguillo-López (2015) propose the usage of local terminologies to describe the elements that set apart Japanese gēmu from the rest of their counterparts. These works are useful to approach Japanese videogames as multi-faceted commodities, but also open new questions pertaining to their behavior and reception depending on the context that they operate on. Moreover, it highlights the importance that interpretation has whenever Japaneseness is brought up as a significant component of a videogame’s character. This proposal will tackle these new enquiries by suggesting that interpretation from both players and producers alike is highly influenced by the segmentation of gameplay preferences as well as the sociological hierarchization that it’s at play in the medium. These forces (which are determined by both market pressures as well as sociocultural and political expectations) determine the sense of foreignness that certain Japanese games develop when they begin to circulate. From this distinguishing process, a sense of belonging to a ludic tradition emerge within communities and becomes the main instrument through which certain elements (from tiny design factors to entire game genres) get to be assigned as part of a specific culture or media environment. Throughout this presentation, I will outline the way in which this sense of tradition is brought upon in discussions around the medium, and attempt to identify its roots in the story of the industry and in the unequal dialectic existing between the Japanese design scene and the supposedly all-encompassing Western scene.\n\nThis thesis will give an insight into how contemporary Japanese Video Game media communicate cultural exchange between eastern and western society. Through discussion of the cultural exchange between both east and west through games will allow a deeper understanding of the function that computer and video games serve in today’s society of both young and old from both cultures. Video Game style and aesthetics will be discussed in conjunction with the work of Anne Allison on the globalization of Japanese Popular Culture. In this study, the roles and forms that that ‘style’ takes in Video Games, both aesthetically and mechanically, will be of key interest. It will be suggested that through the various forms in which style is articulated through video game aesthetics and play, allows for a platform upon which cultural exchange and influence to occur. The layout of the thesis is based on four case studies, and the way in which each communicates a ‘style’ (As defined in the thesis), and how this style facilitates cultural exchange and speaks of cultural history. Each chapter will be pertinent to a different aspect and way in which the discussed ‘style’ articulates. ‘Style as Experience’, ‘Style as the Center of Production’, ‘Style as Retrospection’ and finally, ‘Style is Playable’ all make use of case studies of four Japanese made video game series which are popular both at home and abroad. These games have been selected as each has an appearance of the ‘Superflat’, in that they do not appear to have any overt cultural origin. Through this thesis, we shall illustrate the ways that these games do articulate cultural values and in turn lead to an exchange between players who play these games and the developers who make them."
