        "text": "In a significant update to its Camera app, Apple has introduced a new feature in iOS 18 that allows users to continue playing audio, including music, podcasts, or other sounds, while recording videos. This feature, which was previously unavailable, has been highlighted in various posts and discussions across social media platforms.\n\nThe new setting, located in Settings > Camera > Record Sound, is turned on by default, ensuring that audio playback will not pause automatically when recording video. However, it’s worth noting that these recordings are limited to 1440p resolution at 30 frames per second with mono sound. For stereo sound, users are advised to use AirPods while recording.\n\nThis update has been met with positive feedback from users, who appreciate the ability to multitask with their audio and video recording. The feature is part of the broader iOS 18 update, which also includes improvements in Safari’s Distraction Control, updates to the Photos app, and new customization features.\n\nThe community stability score for iOS 18.1 Developer Beta 1 is reported to be 7/10, indicating a generally positive reception among users, with particular strengths noted in battery life, temperature management, and device speed.\n\nThis latest update from Apple continues to enhance the user experience, providing more flexibility and control over the iPhone’s camera functionality."
