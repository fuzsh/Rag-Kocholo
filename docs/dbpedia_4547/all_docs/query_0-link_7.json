        "text": "or “Stretched hands and limber imaginations”\n\nI. Unimpotant Discoveries\n\nI’m a fan of games on original hardware nowadays. Despite this, I came to emulators around 2013 fully aware of their value. Strictly speaking, being jobless, on a shoestring budget, and a burgeoning anti-capitalist ideologue in college will highlight that value without even a second thought. But from that point, I moved backwards. I reverted back from the Tech-Head’s obsession with trying to make all manner of emulators work on my PC into the Romantic’s desire to return to those same consoles that the emulators are merely copying.\n\nI’m not really much of a collector of anything. I have collections, but always have a stopping point that prevents true obsession. I stopped getting trading cards when the new cards became mundane to me. Games stopped when I ran out of immediate shelf space. Clothes… at least slowed down when my closet and drawers became overly cluttered. Albums when the burden of the physical media’s space became too cumbersome to justify. Video game consoles must earn my respect to stay present. Because of this, my penchant for the kitsch & warm familiarity of original game hardware had to be squared against my distaste for the retro game market as it exists.\n\nAnswers came to me in part because I spent time searching them out. Everdrive make top-of-the-line flash carts even for consoles for whom such a thing was not really available before, such as the Nintendo 64. The Xstation is an incredible hardware modification to the original PlayStation that replaces the often-faulty laser disc reader with a Micro SD card slot. The PlayStation 2, ever temperamental, has an exploit through memory cards that allows the launching of a custom firmware on the machine without a cracking the machine itself. This custom firmware allows the USB slots on the front to be used as god intended. The Wii’s Nintendont program allows for an easy and function-loaded build of GameCube emulation that doesn’t have me anchored to my computer like Dolphin does. The Sega Dreamcast is itself its own solution to the question I was toying with. Do you have a disc drive & disc burning software? Enjoy your Dreamcast collection. And if you have a disc wallet? You have figurative shelf space for your physical media. Congratulations!\n\nBut there was something else to this recognition of old hardware’s value. And I discovered it vis a vis the Sega Genesis. I had given away a Sega Genesis I had gotten pre-retro game media / shelf-of-games-YouTuber boom, but I was compelled to keep one controller — something told me I could probably make use of this.\n\nI kept on my modified Nintendo Wii from 2006 the Genesis Plus GX emulator and a collection of .wad files of Genesis games that were provided through the now defunct Wii Virtual Console service. In a word, I have Genesis games. I have an original Genesis controller, too. Certainly, my two separate Wii Classic Controllers would suffice to perform the act of playing any and all Sega Genesis games. And on top of that, the 2nd version of the Wii Classic Controller, with handles and further spaced out analog sticks, would be infinitely more comfortable than the deformed boomerang of the original 3-button Genesis controller that I owned. The higher functions of my brain — those married to reason and concerned with sense — acknowledge how out-moded and out-classed the Sega Genesis controller is and has been for a long time. But again emerged the pernicious romantic in me — enamored with authenticity, plump with the imagination of how these games are meant to be experienced, and strangest of all, harboring a quiet affection for the Genesis’ dumbass boomerang. And in my $25 purchase of a Raphnet Megadrive/SMS controller to Wiimote adapter (v2) (pictured below) I found within me a hidden truth — I love janky video game controllers. I love them, and I miss them.\n\nII. The Grooming Of Gamepads — A Brief History\n\nGames need gamepads. It doesn’t matter if your game is Dwarf Fortress or Pong. Whether requiring the full range of input provided by a keyboard & mouse or something so simple that the commands of “up” and “down” mapped to a couple of buttons would suffice. The very factor of interactivity that is integral to games of all stripes necessitates a medium through which said interactivity can be conducted. As games got more complex, the gamepads got more complex in kind. The history of games as a medium can be gleaned cursorily through examining only gamepads, and I can prove this.\n\nThis is not exhaustive, of course, but it is chronological, and it’s easy to see what I’m meaning to communicate here. In only 2 decades, we went from the now-primitive joystick + button arrangement of the Atari 2600 to the complicated mélange of buttons, sticks, and pressure-sensitive triggers that were the defining qualities of Microsoft’s original Xbox controller, nicknamed “The Duke”, for its kingly size.\n\nIntuitively, you can sense, if not materially see, the development of video games’ complexity through these selections. Games needed more inputs, so here are more buttons on the front of the controller. The front gets crowded so we move buttons from the “face” (front) of the controller to the “shoulders” (top). Games begin to incorporate 3D movement so we begin to include analog sticks that allow for a full 360 degrees of circular motion in 3D space as opposed to the 8 directions possible with the directional pad. With the development of the Nintendo’s Wii (gamepad not pictured), controlling a video game with bodily motion and pointer controls similar to a computer’s mouse became available avenues of control consideration.\n\nThrough this lens of interpretation, it’s plain to see that the development of gamepad technology has been about the growth of options in the face of increasing sophistication. Console developers want desperately for their hardware to not ever be unsuited for any game experience, so the gamepad has become a canvas on which all features must be painted. This has had an interesting consequence for gamepads in the 21st century, one which I will attempt to illustrate here.\n\nI mentioned before that gamepads made a remarkable jump in the 2 decades between the Atari 2600 and the Original Xbox, and, in a way, I find it equally remarkable how little has changed since. This is what this hastily-made chart is meant to illustrate. Nintendo, always attempting to push hardware beyond mere technical spec upgrades, has always been given to funky controller designs, be that the Wiimote & Nunchuck, the Wii-U Gamepad, or the function-heavy and mutable Nintendo Switch Joycons. But what’s special, is that for all aforementioned examples, the console also provided an alternative “Pro Controller” model meant to emulate whatever Microsoft and/or Sony were doing with their gamepads at the time. It’s a way to hedge bets and to temper complaints about the default idiosyncratic gamepad design. You don’t like whatever screwiness Nintendo is doing with their default console gamepad? Get a more normal “pro controller” and your problem is solved. And on top of that Nintendo gets a few extra bucks from the consumer. It’s a win-win — for Nintendo mostly.\n\nMicrosoft and Sony have been hammering at the same gamepad ergonomics until it becomes a forgone conclusion what each company’s gamepad will look like. Obviously the Sony PlayStation Dualshock, Sony’s most unchanging and ubiquitous hardware peripheral, will be unchanged since its launch in 1997. Why mess with the formula? Why mess, in the opinions of fans, with perfection? The aforementioned Xbox Duke, the original gamepad of Microsoft’s original Xbox console, was one of the last times a widely released, first-party gamepad was a real “mistake”. Derided as bulky, unwieldy, unsightly, and awkward, it was one of the rare times a company, within the timeline of one hardware lifecycle, had decided on a full controller re-design. This re-design replaced the Duke not 2 years after the launch of the Xbox. In 2005, Microsoft adapting the principles laid out in the Duke and cleaning them up led to the critically acclaimed, currently-reigning Gold Standard in controller design, the Xbox 360 gamepad. Since then, as illustrated above, they haven’t messed with the formula. I don’t think about Microsoft as a game company much. I think about The Duke a lot.\n\nIn scanning around, on Reddit I found this image of The Duke next to a standard gamepad for the Sega Dreamcast:\n\nThere’s a tinge of sadness in this image. These are holdovers from a lost era. Some of the last gamepads to be widely circulated by their respective hardware’s parent company that dared to some level of eccentricity with absolutely no contingency in their back pocket. The Duke was quickly discontinued and the Dreamcast lived a prosperous but brief North American shelf life of less than 2 years. The GameCube also had the pluck to have a weird, wonderful gamepad, but it sold so badly as to cause Nintendo to change their entire hardware philosophy to place them out of direct, technical competition with Microsoft and Sony. I don’t think the lack of success of these consoles is due to their respective gamepad — that’s reductive — but it was the last chance for outward quirkiness to reign before the PlayStation 2 sold 155 million copies and decided that gaming was gonna be fully, wholly, and totally mainstream now. The Sixth Generation of Consoles was the last time weirdness without apology was allowed to thrive. I miss that. I miss when the only question about a controller wasn’t just if the 2 analog sticks are horizontally or diagonally oriented. Maybe not every gamepad was perfected adapted to every game experience, but dammit, there was personality. And with respect to this idea, let’s address some love letters to those controllers so bursting with idiotic bluster that you couldn’t help but wanna hug them.\n\nIII. Tributes To The Stupid Gamepads I Love\n\nSega Genesis\n\nLook at this stupid boomerang. You know what people forget about this thing? How wide it is. It’s like gripping a steering wheel in your hands. And what do they do with all of that? 3 buttons and a D-pad. One more button than the NES controller — amazing respect to space efficiency there. But the comfort and ergonomics of the controller is there. It feels like a sturdy piece of, admittedly old, tech. And, appropriately for the Sega Genesis, it has the feel, in its buttons, of the switches and triggers on an Arcade Cabinet. It’s rough, it’s limited, but it feels distinct to itself. And I appreciate that.\n\nLater iterations would introduce 3 additional face buttons and slim the grip a little bit, which is fine for producing greater versatility and maybe even increasing comfort. But I dunno, the redesign always smacked of a “too-little-too-late” correction. The Genesis was limited in its input in the face of the SNES, for sure, but most of the games on the console were built with these limitations in mind. Slapping three more face buttons on the controller is certainly a method of handling the issue, but it’s a bit slapdash & wasn’t too widely adopted by software developers, for fear of alienating those with only the original gamepad. So here we are staring face-to-face with a silly little gamepad from an entirely less-serious time.\n\n2. Nintendo 64\n\nIt’s incredible I’ve gotten this far without discussion of the Nintendo 64’s infamous “Trident-head” gamepad. History makes the context of this controller a bit clearer, but it’s like explaining how the infrastructural weakness of the Twin Towers allowed 9/11 to be the disaster it was. In the end, you’re just giving further context to terrorism.\n\nIn the end, I think it’s worth critiquing the N64 controller as a blunder, sure, but also to give it its due flowers. The Z button, located on the back, almost like the trigger of a gun, must be responsible for at least some of the success of Goldeneye and Perfect Dark as first person shooters on the console. The analog stick, as given to failure as it may have been, proved its incredible level of sophistication to me only when I played launch title Pilotwings 64 on it back in 2019. The smallest jostle of it would lead to a proportionally minute shift in my character’s flight trajectory while using the glider or plane. Ocarina Of Time and Majora’s Mask’s use of the C-buttons as item select feels like an inspired alchemist’s transmutation of gold from coal. And changing the positioning of your hands on the gamepad depending on whether the game you’re playing is 2D or 3D is a kooky idea that I don’t think should be replicated, but I appreciate it having happened at least once. On top of that, playing Mischief Makers on the original N64 gamepad feels like the only way the game should be experienced. Navigating Marina with the D-pad and activating her jetpack thrusters in any direction with the C-buttons is somehow even more inspired than Legend of Zelda’s use of them. The D-pad feels good too; it’s absolutely massive, for some reason.\n\nIn the interest of transparency, I rarely use my original N64 gamepad anymore, opting instead for RetroBit’s Tribute64 gamepad, which nicks the “turtle shell” look of the Sega Saturn 3D pad, which is its own honorary little freak in our gallery of weirdos:\n\nDespite this, there is still an affection I harbor for the original design, as much as the analog stick has come to frustrate me, at times. And if ever I play a game that wants for the D-pad play configuration, I’m compelled to return to the original. This is both a mark of genius, in understanding how 2D games were not rendered obsolete by 3D games. But also a mark of idiocy, in creating a control that is so binary in its utility. Later controllers, and certainly the modern standard gamepad, is required to have functionality both 3D and 2D games baked-in, and that really began in earnest with the N64, it just took a bit of extra work to get the bumps in that execution smoothed out. I give credits to the pioneers, though, especially when that pioneer was so singular in its functionality within its time.\n\n3. Nintendo GameCube\n\nThe enduring popularity of the GameCube’s controller has almost made me want to discount it from the running here, but I simply have spotlight how great this is. And the reason I wanna talk about it is because it’s obvious from just looking that it’s greatness is not in following convention. The GameCube controller breaks just about every rule of symmetry, evenness, and functionality and instead hones in entirely on ergonomics, comfort, and practicality. Outside of first-person shooters (which are best served by a mouse anyway), this is the perfect gamepad for playing games. The grooves in the plastic around the analog stick give emphasis on 8-directional movement while still providing full 360 motion. The irregular button and stick sizes are proportional to those button’s respective importance and commonness of use. The analog triggers are still the best ever made and make Super Mario Sunshine and Metroid Prime notably more fun than it would be with lesser shoulder buttons. The GameCube controller is funk the right way. It’s not the perfect gamepad in terms of making “on-paper” sense or working for every game ever made, but when it works, nothing is better. It syncopates like Bootsy. And people still use it for Smash Bros. nowadays. Nintendo will sell first-party Gamecube-style gamepads for use on the Nintendo Switch, just so Super Smash Bros. Ultimate can play just that little bit more like Super Smash Bros. Melee on GameCube. And if that’s not a testament to a lasting and unique breed of success, I don’t know what is.\n\n4. Sega Dreamcast\n\nWas there ever any doubt? The Sega Dreamcast gamepad is much like the console that hosts it — wonky, quirky, super cool, loaded with features that were ahead of its time… and utterly maladapted to the world it came into back in 1999. The pad in particular screams out for a second analog stick underneath the face-buttons but it just… isn’t there. I think such a change could have been a factor in helping facilitate a longer life for the Dreamcast, but more than likely the result would have been the same. But stripped of historical retrospect, we’re just left with this weird little (huge) gamepad. Plastic braille-style bumps on the analog stick, an early instance of analog triggers, wire exiting the bottom, and two big slots on the top of it to insert memory cards that can display images in the middle of the controller. It’s almost as though the Dreamcast did everything “wrong” with its controller, but still the console has its devotees.\n\nTruth told, the controller is a hard sell, but I like it a lot. It feels entirely itself in almost every way. And how it feels is pretty good. Chunky buttons, big thick grip, nice heft, good stuff. And outside of Bangai-O, Shenmue (surprisingly), and the absolute weirdness of FPS’ on the console, in my experience, most Dreamcast games meet the Dreamcast gamepad where it’s at. It’s chunky but expressive, as far as a gamepad can be, at least. And it’s got spunk to do all of that. What is that exactly? Exist, mostly. But man, look how cool it is? Do you not think it’s cool? Is there a better ambassador for Y2K-era aesthetics in the world of video game consoles than the Dreamcast? I think not. And I love it for that.\n\n5. Wii Classic Controller\n\nThe Wii Classic Controller Pro and its sleek handlebar design do not qualify like this little freak does. The Wii Classic Controller asks a vital question. “What would happen if you took the Super Nintendo’s traditional and effective gamepad and modernized it?” Alternatively, it proposes boldly, “What if the N64, but normal?” It delivers only partially on both premises.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that this little guy does not feel like the SNES gamepad. It should, it wants to, but it doesn’t. It feels like goofy plastic. And, in a classic move, has the wire exiting the bottom instead of the normal top. Bless. The analog sticks are the true gaff here — they’re entirely too close together. Should you actually want to use both of them, it’ll feel weird like no other dual-analog controller does. And that stick on the right was meant to sub in for the C-buttons on the N64 controller and that simply doesn’t work. Once again the N64’s jank controller strikes its terroristic mayhem again. You simply can’t emulate something that probably wasn’t a great idea in the first place.\n\nAll sorts of things about this are quirked up. The 1st triggers are half-hearted analog (later discontinued in the Pro model because no one cared and no games used it) and the 2nd triggers are tiny, clicky buttons. The face buttons all feel super soft & squishy. The thing can’t work unless plugged into a Wiimote. There’s a button on top of the controller which has no function at all except to maneuver a bit of plastic in the back of the gamepad. This was intended for… something at some point, but it never materialized. So in the original Wii Classic Controller their lives the shadow of what could have been. Complete with the text “RVL-005 PAT. PEND.” Truly fascinating.\n\nIf I’m using a Wii Classic Controller I use the original — not necessarily because it’s better, but because it’s niftier. In the famous words of Marge Simpson; “I just think it’s neat”. It brings a unique ergonomic feel, the closeness of the analog stick — an Achilles heel on paper — is one of the foundations of its character. Super Mario 64 never felt quite like it does on this snicklefritz. Would I prefer to use my Retrobit or even the original N64 controller for the task — probably! But the novelty factor of the Wii’s original Classic Controller provides its own niche sort of appeal.\n\n6. The Duke\n\nHow could I not? King of the freaks, the final inheritor of the jank throne, the end all & be-all of silly-ass gamepads. The original Xbox Duke Gamepad. Maybe it’s not the weirdest or worst controller ever — but it is certainly one of the weirdest to be distributed so widely and so modernly.\n\nIn truth, I don’t own a Duke because I don’t own an Original Xbox. If I had an Original Xbox, I would use The Duke exclusively. My adoration for it is simply to great to even think to neglect it. I mean, look at this — a case study in missing the mark fabulously. The intention here was to make a normal gamepad, I can see that. They just… didn’t. The orientation of the buttons is weird. It’s like someone took the gamepad in Microsoft Paint and hit the skew effect. The analog sticks have that diagonal orientation that would become industry standard, but they have weird imprints on them that are for… comfort? I guess? Why are they different sized imprints? The D-pad, if you could even call it that, looks like a vague, melted piece of plastic. Like an AI generated image of what a D-Pad should properly look like. The Xbox logo takes up a solid 20% of the controller’s most valuable face real estate. What is normally the “select” button is labeled “back”. There are two white & black buttons without labeling as high up on the controller as physically possible before they begin to fly out into space. That all aside, the sheer size of this lad is remarkable.\n\nThere’s little more to say for The Duke. Microsoft quickly abandoned it, but history will not forget it. It’s one of gamepads that’s most on-its-face ridiculous while still being technically functional, as opposed to something like the Atari Jaguar controller. It announced itself loud, and then slunk out the backdoor before the party was even half over. It’s an icon and a symbol of a bygone era of dumbass, loveable, gamepads. For that, I simply must give The Duke its flowers.\n\nThere are more that could be mentioned, especially if I wanted to delve into the pre-NES world, but I’ll let these 6 selections speak volumes of the nature of my affection. I appreciate that which flies the freak flag. And it’s a flag we don’t seeing flying from too many major gaming peripherals anymore, why is that? It might just be that games grew up.\n\nIV. The Best & Worst Of Ages\n\nGaming has become indescribably rich as a medium. To those cultural stenographers not keen on measuring the minutest pulses of artistic ambition of games from the Super Nintendo on, the worlds presented in games like Red Dead Redemption 2, The Witcher 3, and The Last Of Us may come as a surprise. The cinematic, dramatic, narrative, and aesthetic ambitions of games extend even to the works of smaller development teams, let alone the expectation of prestige that comes with a large company name attached. Arguments of times past about the validity of video games as an artistic medium seem hopelessly out of step with reality — the proof is almost inalienable. Throw a stone in the direction of any GOTY list from the last decade and you’ll likely find something of meaningful artistic distinction.\n\nThis is all to say that games have reached their maturation. Most people play games, even if casually, and every self-referenced gamer of any worth has at least a small cache of games whose artistic value they uphold as a paragon of the medium. Whether that’s something as dusty as Myst or as shiny and new as Baulder’s Gate 3 — there are valid choices under any given rock you choose. And they extend backwards for decades.\n\nBut almost organically as a result of this, gaming has fewer places left to grow. Not since 1998 has 3D gaming been revelatory. Not since 2003 have open-worlds been novel. Not since 2009 have moral choice systems been obscure. And the question of when quality video game narratives became something at least reasonably common is a subject of at least some debate, the only settled question of the debate being that it at least has happened by now. I love and cherish many games of the last decade, but their groundbreaking qualities are slim at best. Inventive certainly, but ground can only broken once. In turn, their caution and attention to detail grows in its magnitude until, I assume, even indie studio toss-offs of a certain caliber will glimmer with a polished sheen that would make any given PS2 game weep.\n\nGames on the whole are arguably better than they were 20 years ago. Games on the whole are also arguably infinitely less interesting than 20 years ago. There is an obvious something — an indescribable je na sais quoi that comes with being formative. For however thoroughly a thing gets iterated on, there is a spark that is achieved — knowingly or not — through breaking ground. This is why, despite the fact that I do, in the pure facts n’ numbers sort of sense, prefer A Hat In Time to Banjo-Kazooie, I would count the latter as more fascinating. One is pure iteration — however beautifully done — the other maintains its off-the-shelf freshness even 26 years later despite the obvious hallmarks of age. That’s spirit — intangible and inimitable. A spirit that Banjo-Kazooie spiritual successor Yooka-Laylee lacked, by the way.\n\nThe comfortable maturation of the games medium yields many meaningful dividends; games look better, run better, regularly exercise artistic muscles, and do not shy away from pretention as readily as the time period that saw this cover change for Ico’s North American localization:\n\nBut in this spirit, what can lay claim to being Ico itself, but Ico? Ico is not great in a vacuum alone; it is great because it dared what it dared in the nagggingly bro-ish gaming culture of 2001. Not 2023. Not even 2007. But 2001. It’s daringness as integral to its identity as its “hold hands with Yorda” button. If anything, that super badass North American cover was simply to concede any ground whatsoever to the bros that ran the popular consciousness of gaming at this point. Had they gone with the Giorgio de Chirico inspired original cover concept perhaps the butterfly effect would have prevented the continued existence of G4 into the 2010s— who knows?\n\nTo cut a potentially enteral digression short — games had more chutzpah back in the day. I don’t say better designed, I don’t say prettier, I don’t even say more inventive — but chutzpah is the order of the hour in times of becoming. Gaming isn’t really becoming anymore, not so far as I can see. Quality as people say 2023 was regarding video games, the nominee list for GOTY saw nothing but iteration. And within that framework — minor innovations, I’m sure. But this slowing of progress is natural — it’s simply not sustainable to good health to keep the rate of change of a teenager up into one’s 30’s. Similarly games have slowed their rate of change down and are now free to reap the benefits of 40+ years of video game design knowledge and create some solid, quality games. And the gamepad — the mediator of the experience — has settled in a similar fashion. Solid — but lacking chutzpah. We’re not looking at a future of “Dukes” and Dreamcasts; we’re likely going to see the same general gamepad tendencies we’ve been seeing for over a decade now. And should an aberration come along, it’s likely to be turned on so violently as to be scrapped before reaching market. Such was the fate of the vaporous original PS3 “boomerang” controller debuted in 2005 but never publically released:\n\nAs we must put to rest the tumult of our adolescence, so to should we accept that the “Boomerang” was probably a dumb idea that was wisely never put to market. But if there’s something that my life hence lived has proven it’s that the spirit of teenage-hood is wasted on the teenager. And as important as it is to stabilize, so too is it important to carry that spark of imagination and inspiration that characterizes the very brightest of the adolescent experience. Maybe gaming will never produce more freak gamepads like it did in the past, and I can accept that, but that doesn’t mean I have to be celebrating its stodgy adulthood like it’s a perfect progress, either."
