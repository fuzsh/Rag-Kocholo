        "text": "The choice of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Kamala Harris’ choice for her Vice President running mate may have surprised some Democrats, but some strategists see it as a winning electoral game plan.\n\nWalz, 60, the second-term governor is a former congressman, high school educator, football coach and 24-year National Guard member, rising to the rank of command sergeant major. He is also chair of the Democratic Governors Association. He was first elected governor in 2018 and re-elected four years later.\n\nHis selection over other candidates, including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, may well help to bolster the Midwest ‘blue wall’ in what may be a close election.\n\nThe plain-spoken Walz is not an easily recognizable figure in national politics, but recently made headlines when he tagged the Trump team as “weird,” a term which has stuck.\n\nHe is also known for his ability to appeal to and win over rural, conservative voters. Inexplicably, but perhaps predictably, GOP Sen. J.D. Vance said the choice of Walz “highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.”\n\nOn social media, Walz said Vance has no idea what makes small-town America tick: “I grew up in a small town. (Nebraska). J.D. Vance is dead wrong about what makes small-town America tick. Small towns don’t work because everyone is closed-minded and prejudiced. They work because people mind their own damn business. J.D. Vance seems to have a real problem minding his.”\n\nFor his part, Donald Trump’s reaction on a text to financial supporters, with capital letters, no less, was that “TIM WALZ WILL UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH! and open our borders to the worst criminals imaginable, and rubber stamp Kamala’s GREEN NEW SCAM and light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire.”\n\nWhy he would claim Walz would burn trillions of dollars is anyone’s guess.\n\nWeird is all I can say.\n\nBy contrast, many political observers say Walz’s popularity among progressives and labor activists is matched by his standing with many political centrists and blue-collar workers.\n\nHe has also championed reproductive rights, increased funding for childcare with the nation’s most significant child tax credit and spoken out against book bans. Other legislation passed during his term was cannabis legalization and expansion of background checks for purchasing firearms.\n\nHarris and Walz will begin a campaign swing through seven so-called battleground states, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nIn other news, reaction was swift and hypercritical of the former president over his response to pointed questions at the National Association of Black Journalists recent session, where he apparently refused to be fact-checked in real time. Then, he provoked widespread outrage when he questioned the racial background of Kamala Harris, claiming she only recently claimed she was black – an outlandish, obtuse, and inherently racist comment that was widely criticized, even by a Fox News talk host.\n\nIt was another instance of profound and shameful disinformation by the man known to be a pathological liar. It was quickly ridiculed in the same way Vance’s quip about ‘childless cat ladies’ landed and both comments are destined for the political hall of shame as classic self-inflicted, perhaps fatal wounds.\n\nThe debate fiasco for the Trump team also garnered headlines. First, claiming he didn’t need to debate on ABC on the previously agreed-to date of Sept. 10, since voters knew who they both were; then he backtracked and tried to get Harris to agree to debate on Fox News with a live, Trump-friendly audience present. In the end, it appears the main candidates may not debate, (unfortunately) with a potential vice presidential debate still up in the air.\n\nAnother interesting sidebar in Trump World for the past couple of weeks has been the attempt to back away from the radical GOP plan for remaking our system of governance known as Project 2025. We will examine the often unbelievable aspects of this ‘plan’ in future columns, but his lame attempt to disassociate himself from a scheme conceived by dozens of his associates and the right-wing Heritage Foundation strike me as cowardly and laughable.\n\nI want to give kudos to all those who took part in our presentation, with Colorado Public Radio, of the film “Undivide Us” at the SteamPlant Annex, followed by facilitated discussions of our deep political divides, their causes and how to heal them. It was one of several held around the state in hope of helping voters see past the partisan noise and disfunction. Hope it helps.\n\nFinally, in response to a couple of comments on Facebook I was made aware of by AVV staff, one of which foolishly accused me off being a ‘propagandist,’ I have to wonder yet again how some people cannot tell or understand the difference between a straight-up reported news story and an editorial – which is what this column is. Frustrating and in a way, laughable itself.\n\nThank you for reading my Musings column and for the support of Ark Valley Voice‘s independent journalism.\n\nEditor’s note: Musings is an opinion column written by veteran journalist Dan Smith."
