        "text": "Here's how the Dow fared\n\nSan Francisco Fed president: US economy could \"continue to deteriorate\"\n\nSan Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly acknowledged Monday that there are concerns about whether the US economy will “continue to deteriorate and softening will turn into weakness.”\n\n“We don’t see that right now,” she said Monday, speaking at an event hosted by the Hawaii Executive Collaborative. Last month’s unexpectedly weak jobs report isn’t convincing her that the central bank needs to make any urgent moves. “We’re slowing but not falling off a cliff,” added Daly, who is voting on monetary policy decisions this year.\n\n“I’ll be watching very carefully to see if the next labor market report continues to suggest that kind of same number or same dynamic, but that could also reverse.” Her general sense from recent conversations with business owners is that “firms are not laying workers off, firms are simply slowing their pace of hiring.” If the state of the economy was deteriorating, you’d see more layoffs, she said.\n\nShe suggested that a rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting would be merited but declined to share how big a cut she feels could be appropriate.\n\nS&P 500 sheds $1.3 trillion in value Monday\n\nThe S&P 500 declined sharply by Monday’s market close, despite easing off its session lows.\n\nThe benchmark index lost a whopping $1.3 trillion in market value on Monday, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nTrack S&P closing levels\n\nDow and S&P 500 notch worst day since 2022\n\nStocks ended a turbulent trading session on a dour note as investors feared that the US economy is on shaky legs.\n\nThe Dow plunged 1,034 points, or 2.6%. The S&P 500 dived 3% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 3.4%.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow and benchmark S&P 500 index notched their biggest daily percentage loss since 2022, when the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate-hiking cycle helped send the S&P 500 into a bear market.\n\nMonday marks just the 15th time the Dow has shed more than 1,000 points in a single session, according to FactSet data.\n\nAlso on Monday, Japanese stocks suffered their biggest daily losses since 1987 as fears about a US economic slowdown sent shock waves through global markets.\n\nOil prices fell. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the US benchmark, settled at $72.94 a barrel. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, settled at $76.30 a barrel.\n\nDowndetector reported that popular online trading platforms including Fidelity, E-Trade and Robinhood ran into technical difficulties Monday as investors rushed to shed stocks.\n\nThe US market’s losses on Monday extend the market’s steep selloff on Friday, after a dreary July jobs report rattled Wall Street.\n\nTraders see a 85% expectation that the Fed will cut rates by half a point the next time it reconvenes, in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nSome experts, including famed Wharton professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel, have called for the Fed to call an emergency meeting to cut rates before then. The central bank last took such action in March 2020, at the onset of the Covid pandemic.\n\nStill, other economists and investors have argued that the market is overreacting to recent economic data, with some even recommending Monday’s carnage as a buying opportunity.\n\n“Evidence certainly points to a slowing economy. But slowing and slow are two very different points,” Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, wrote in a Friday note. “Lower prices certainly can have a massive psychological effect. But investors need to step back and look at the fundamental story, which still remains decent.”\n\nAs stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.\n\nWhy the stock market was vulnerable to a pullback\n\nTraders received news that the labor market is slowing at a less-than-ideal time for Wall Street.\n\nHere are some key factors that made the market exposed to a pullback, according to RBC Capital Markets.\n\nStocks tend to perform poorly during the summer months, since there aren’t many economic data releases or events to catalyze gains for the market. Investors also tend to take off for vacation, resulting in less trading volume and spiking volatility.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris pulled ahead of her rival, former president Donald Trump, in election betting markets last week. That’s notable because the S&P 500’s performance has closely correlated with Trump’s trend.\n\nA measure of everyday investors’ sentiment is just below a mark that has signaled a short-term peak in the stock market in recent years.\n\nStocks pare some losses Monday mid-morning\n\nStocks clawed back some of their earlier losses Monday mid-morning.\n\nThe Dow tumbled 893 points, or 2.4%, after plunging more than 1,000 points earlier in the session. The S&P 500 declined 2.6% and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 3.3%.\n\nCNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven barometers of market sentiment, fell to an “extreme fear” reading.\n\nThe VIX, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped to 43 after surging to more than 60 at its highs.\n\nAt least interest rates will be lower soon\n\nThe one silver lining from Monday’s market action is that it likely cements the first interest rate cut in September.\n\nIt also raises the odds that the Federal Reserve could roll out an even bigger rate cut than anticipated. That would usher in lower borrowing costs on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards.\n\nThe Fed’s latest policy statement, released at the conclusion of its July policy meeting last week, said the central bank is now wary of any risks to the US job market, and suggested that inflation has become less of a concern in recent months. The Fed is now attentive to both sides of its so-called dual mandate of stabilizing prices and maximizing employment.\n\nThere is one more jobs report before the Fed’s September 17-18 meeting, and if unemployment rises even higher, the central bank may need to cut more aggressively.\n\nA recession ‘rule’ has been triggered\n\nFriday’s dismal jobs report triggered a well-known recession indicator developed by American economist Claudia Sahm, who worked at the Fed for more than a decade.\n\nThe “Sahm rule” posits that whenever the unemployment rate as a three-month average rises 0.5 percentage points from the lowest point in the past 12 months, that means the economy is in the early signs of a recession.\n\nSince January, it has risen by 0.6 percentage points.\n\nBut some economists say lingering effects from the Covid-19 pandemic have rendered many rules useless.\n\n“I’m very hesitant to use the ‘R’ word (recession), because I don’t think we’re there; but this is something to keep our eye on,” Elizabeth Crofoot, senior economist at labor analytics firm Lightcast, told CNN after the release of the July jobs data."
