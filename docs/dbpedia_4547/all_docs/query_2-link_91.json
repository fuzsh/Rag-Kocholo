        "text": "I was never really in to E3.\n\nEspecially not in the past decade, when it was nothing more then hype manufacturing for announcements for a trailer to be dropped, that announces a game that might get released in 2027.\n\nAnd which will be playable in 2030 after 3 years of patches.\n\nBut even before modern gaming was ruined I was never really in to E3.\n\n@bippity_bop I was in a certain retro game community that had heard of the unreleased Sega CD game Citizen X, and to us DLC meant \"d-licking clown\" after what one member described as their interpretation of one character in the game (and seen in screenshots in original development era coverage in magazines like EGM).\n\nThat was, a mime or clown or such seen in the FMV's, and this forum member gave their interpretation of what the clown was miming. And it stuck in the community.\n\nMan we had it soo good back then, psone, ps2, and dreamcast, for me that 3 console is the peak of gaming ðŸ˜ƒ\n\nNes and snes is like the start of gaming when it becomes good enough (atari 2600 games kind of suck), nintendo 64 is good too but the games available is just too small compared to others console. Nintendo and rare 1st party games on n64 rules though."
