        "text": "One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the magazines that were available at the time, both game-specific magazines and digital/creative magazines have a wealth of information.\n\nGames Industry Magazines\n\nOccasionally you can be lucky enough to find a whole magazine specifically dedicated to Game Development but they can be few and far between.\n\nUnfortunately, most are now defunct but one excellent title remains until the time of writing: Wireframe magazine, if you are in a position to support this magazine I would strongly recommend it.\n\nTitle Publisher Notes Develop NewBayMedia UK Magazine which was published from August 1996 Until November 2017 Game Developer UBM Tech US Magazine which was published from March 1994 until July 2013 - Note that the free pdfs online do not have the full content such as adverts inside GameMaker Future Publishing UK magazine dedicated to Game Modding and Development. Only 1 issue was published in October 2003 before it became a supplement for the PC Format magazine (which also didn’t last long) Journal of Computer Game Design Self Published From June 1987 until 1993 when it rebranded to Interactive Entertainment Design Wireframe Raspberry Pi Press From November 2018 and lasted until January 2023 (70 issues)\n\nGameMaker Magazine\n\nGameMaker was a very unique magazine published in the UK on October 2003, it was a game development and modding magazine targetted at the general public!\n\nSadly the topic was deemed too niche and only one issue was ever published before it became a section of PC Format magazine for two issues (159 & 160) and then a stand along supplement distributed along with the magazine for a further 3 issues until it was replaced in issue 165 by a Doom 3 supplement instead.\n\nIf anyone has the 4 GameMaker supplement magazines from issue 161-164 then please get in contact we would love to see them!\n\nIssue Name Description 1 WARCRAFT 3 The basics of creating a map in the Warcraft 3 Map Editor with a hero (Hercules) an enemy (Hydra) and victory conditions 1 UNREAL TOURNAMENT 2003 Introduction to Unreal Editor 3.0, using brushes to carve out maps, adding textures, lighting and even creating moving platforms 1 MAKE A MOD General advice from Kieron Gillen about modding games such as the scope of the project and how to recruit other modders 1 NEVERWINTER NIGHTS Introduction to the BioWare Neverwinter Nights Toolset for creating a simple adventure game including scripting and adding factions 1 ADVENTURE GAME STUDIO Introduction to AGS to create a simple point-and-click graphic adventure game with scripts and background music 1 THE SIMS Briefly covers tools like SimShow, Facelift, HomeCrafter, Transmogrifier, Blueprint, Career Creator and how to replace the radio station MP3 files 1 HALF-LIFE/COUNTER-STRIKE Brief introduction to the Value Hammer Editor 1 THE GAME FACTORY PRO Create a very simple snowboarding game (similar to ski free) in The Game Factory Pro 1 HISTORY OF MODDING Covers the history of game modding such as “Adventure”, “Ms Pac-Man”, “Castle Smurfenstein”, “Team Fortress” etc 1 GRAND THEFT AUTO: VICE CITY Introduction to modding GTA Vice City, using tools such as CROA, ZModeler, CarEd 1.4, IMG Tool 1.3, ViceTXD 1 RAILROAD TYCOON 3 Create a very simple map in Railroad Tycoon 3 with the built-in editor including adding a volcano with the Paint Terrain tools 1 3DS MAX AND UNREAL ED Tutorial for getting a 3D Studio Max model into UT2003 including fixing textures with Photoshop rigging with Character Studio 3 and exporting with ActorX 1 FLIGHT SIMULATOR 2004 Using GMax to create custom aircraft and scenery for Flight Simulator 2004 1 NVIDIA CHARACTER DESIGN Article by Daniel Hornick, Hubert Nguyen and Curtis Beeson from Nvidia 1 MILKSHAPE Tutorial for creating a 3d man with a gun that can be imported into Unreal Tournament 1 QUAKE III Detailed guide for how to create a level in Quake 3 using Q3Map2Toolz 1 LOW POLY MODELLING Creating a low poly model of a cartoon character in 3D Studio Max 5\n\nJournal of Computer Game Design\n\nThe “Journal of Computer Game Design” was founded by Chris Crawford, a well-known game designer and developer, in June 1987 . The journal’s primary focus was on computer and video game design. It was one of the first publications to provide insights and discussions on the art and science of game design.\n\nIt cost $30 a year to subscribe and the journeals were released every other month, it was the first attempt to foster a community around game design ;\n\nThe journal featured articles, essays, and discussions about various aspects of game design, development, and theory. It covered topics such as game mechanics, narrative design, player engagement, and industry trends. No programming or asset development articles were posted it was purley for game design.\n\nThe “Journal of Computer Game Design” ceased publication in the early 1990s. While it had a significant impact during its existence, it was succeeded by other publications and academic efforts dedicated to game design and development.\n\nRelevant Articles\n\nAll the articles are now freely available on Chris Crawford’s website in a well categorized manner so there is little benefit to repeating that work here, if you are interested in early articles about game design then head over there now!\n\nWireframe Magazine\n\nWireframe is an excellent magazine that blends developer interviews with practical tutorials such as how to implement various game mechanics in programming languages such as python or even C programming for the original Game Boy!\n\nThey even release all the issues they make free on their website in pdf form for everyone (not just subscribers).\n\nSadly Wireframe magazine is no longer producing new magazines after issue 70.\n\nYou can view all the issues on their official website: Issues — Wireframe Magazine\n\nRelevant Articles\n\nIt is worth reading the entire Wireframe issues cover-to-cover but the most important section for game development is the “Toolbox section of the magazine.\n\nHere is a table of the articles most relevant to both modern and retro game development:\n\nIssue Name Description 1 Design principles An Atari veteran on the philosophy of game design (Howard Scott Warshaw) 1 City Craft

know about are listed in the table below.\n\nTitle Publisher Run Notes Computer Gaming World 1981-2006 USA Magazine that ran from 1981-2006 EDGE Future UK magazine that contained interviews with game developers and even adverts for Development Kits GamesTM Highbury 2002-2018 UK Magazine that contained interviews with Game developers reached 213 issues GameBytes 1992-1994 MS-DOS based application for an interactive magazine released on BBS between 1992-1994 https://www.dosgames.com/gamebytes.php PC Gamer Future 1993-present Long Running UK Magazine dedicated to PC Gaming, sometimes has game developer and modding content PSi2 Thin Ice Media (Datel) 2000-? This occasionally contains top quality articles about Homebrew and Game Development for the Playstation 2 Retro Gamer Live/Imagine/Future 2004-present Long running UK Magazine dedicated to Retro games, often has interviews with game developers Super Pro Paragon Publishing 1992-1994 Super Nintendo Magazine that had some interviews related to game development such as the interview with Brain Fargo of Interplay\n\nGameBytes (1992-1994)\n\nGameBytes was a very unique magazine as it wasn’t published in a traditional sense, it was released for free online on Bulletin Board Systems, it was also unique in its format as it was an actual interactive MS-DOS Application!\n\nOver its relativly short life span it obtained some very interesting articles related to the Game development industry, including multiple reviewes of the Computer Game Developers Conference in 1994.\n\nYou can experience the magazines online through an emulator on DOSGames.com.\n\nEDGE Magazine\n\nThe magazine EDGE published its first issue on August 19th 1993 with a focus on going more in-depth on technical details such as how games are made, technical aspects and development issues . It targeted multiple console/PC platforms (Mega Drive, SNES, Amiga etc) and is famous for hiring many of the engineers at Rare due to their advertisements (Dr Doak is one example of someone who applied thanks to an EDGE advertisement).\n\nFor their news sections they would “borrow” from Japanese magazines such as “Weekly Famitsu” and US magazines such as “EGM” .\n\nPSi2 Magazine\n\nPublished by Thin-Ice Media (Owned by Datel) it was the only non-official Playstation 2 magazine to include a playable CD every issue.\n\nEach CD would contain a few Action Replay Cheats and save games that can be applied to a few select games, it formed as a good advertisement to Datel’s Action Replay product.\n\nWhether it was always intended to be just another advertisement route for Datel or not, it ended up having a good run of 38 issues or just over 3 years on High Street shelves!\n\nRelevant Articles in PSi2\n\nAs Psi2 was an unofficial magazine published by Datel it was a good magazine for news about development topics and homebrew along with general game reviews and news. Here is a table of the most relevant articles for the topic of the site (game development and homebrew)\n\nIssue Name Description 18 Linux PS2 PSi2 interviews developers such as Charles Cecil to find out if the PS2 Linux kit can revive the “bedroom coder”. They are pretty harsh on the kit and outright say its only beneficial for people learning to porgram and that its better to learn on Windows with Visual Studio and DirectX 18 Yabasic Appeal The editor asks for readers Yabasic games/programs to be put on next issues cover disk 18 Indie day Interview with indie developer Vis entertainment who developed games like Tom & Jerry Fists of Fury on N64 19 Developer files; Europe History of DMA Design (GTA 3), Lost Boys (Knights), Bizarre creations (Fur Fighters), Amuze (Headhunter), Criterion (Burnout) 19 Indie day Interview with indie developer Runecraft founded in 1997 with 120 employees 20 One step beyond Interview with Beyond games they mention they have a game engine called “Brainstom” which they used for Motor Mayhem and Hot Wheels which apparently has networking capabilities 20 A Week in the life of Runcraft Lays out the day to day work of the art development of Runecraft while they develop games for the PS2 such as Premier manager. They use photoshop for tecturing but its unclear what software they use for 3D modelling as the screenshots are too low-res but possibly 3DS Max. 20 Indie day Interview with Pivotal games on their game Desert Storm 21 A Week in the life of Kuju 21 Indie day Interview with Argonaut games\n\nPSi2 Magazine CDs\n\nSome of the Magazine CDs/DVDs contained Video content on behind the scenes information for upcoming games, such as interviews with developers and even yabasic games with source code.\n\nIssue Number Content 19 Yabasic Tetris by Marc Gale (Xalthorn) 20 Yabasic Asteriods Lab X by Christopher Rankine 21 Yabasic Bats in the Lab by Christopher Rankine 21 Trailers for Auto Modellista, Red Dread Revolver, Dino Stalker, JoJo’s Bizare Adventure and others 22 Behind the Scenes of V-Rally 3 23 Talking about the Mechanics of The Thing 28 Trailer of travel documentaries from Pilot Guides to places like Mexico, Spain, India (Pilot Film and Television Productions Home Page) 29 The Making of Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness\n\nCreative Magazines\n\nCreative Magazines related to topics such as art/3d graphics and even web development are just as valuable a source as gaming magazines for the time as they would often talk about industry events and software that were often used by game developers.\n\nTitle Notes 3D Artist UK magazine published by Imagine Publishing from 2009 until December 2019 3D World Global magazine from ? and still going today Computer Artist USA magazine From 1994 until at least 1997 published by PennWell Publishing Company Computer Arts UK magazine from 1995 until 2020 but was also published globally Computer Graphics World USA magazine from 1977 until 2022 published by PennWell Publishing Company Cre@teOnline UK Magazine from 2000 until ?

This really is a shame as they are one of the best resources to see the state of the art in 3D graphics at a particular point in time.\n\nSince this website is dedicated to real-time applications of computer graphics the most useful years are from the 90s onwards when colourful 2D and 3D graphics become possible on consumer hardware.\n\nThe magazine is formed of 80+ pages of content, some of which are adverts (interesting CG tool adverts however!) and the following main content sections:\n\nEditor’s Note - Also available fully on their Website\n\nLetters - Published user letters sent to the magazine (Only in physical Magazine)\n\nSpotlight - News and Products (Also on Website)\n\nTech Watch - Interesting articles (Only in physical Magazine)\n\nPortfolio - Presumably Not got copyright permission from individual authors for publishing on their website\n\nUser Focus\n\nProducts - Also available on their Website\n\nRelevant Articles\n\nThe table below focuses on the articles related to Game Development, the list is still a WIP:\n\nIssue Title Author Notes 1990-06 Visualizing Math Lisa Stapleton May give interesting information used by early 3D game developers 1990-06 Stereo 3D Phillip Robinson Very early article on Stereoscopic 3D (does it mention Master System 3D?) 1990-12 Silicon Graphics Straddles PC\\Workstation Market Unknown Early SGI articles are always interesting 1991-02 A Real-Time Stroll Unknown Early real-time graphics from 1991 1991-03 The Video Toaster Unknown Later became Lightwave3D 1991-05 3D from the Ground Up Unknown Might have interesting technical details 1991-06 Algorithmic Advancements Peter Sorensen These algorithms influenced CG and game developers 1991-10 Painting in 3D Barbara Robertson Early 3D painting technology 1992-03 Virtual Reality Arielle Emmett 1992-03 Multimedia Development Unknown Games are multimedia so might be an interesting article for a 1992 perspective 1992-05 Let the Games Begin Diana Phillips Mahoney 1992-05 The market for virtual reality Unknown Early VR tech 1992-07 SIGGRAPH ‘92 Preview Unknown Would be good to see what was shown at SIGGRAPH 1992 1992-11 Modeling Made Easy Caren D.

Not all issues included free full products but the ones that did were generally worth picking up, but of course it was always an older version of the products as an incentive to upgrade to the latest versions.\n\nIssue Free Product Notes 1 Monitest Windows 3.1 Application to highlight areas of phosphor damage to a CRT 1 Picture Publisher 3.1 2D Image editor by MicroGrafx 1 WinImages: Morph V1 Tool by Black Belt that allows you to morph a 2D image into an animation as a standard .AVI movie or .FLC file that can be played with AAPLAY 1 Imagine 3.0 Complete 3D program worth £500 121 Shade 7 Designer LE 122 Carrara Studio 2.1 122 TaxCalc Lite 123 Cleanerzoomer 1.0.1 PC only, removes artifacts from images 136 Bryce 5.0\n\nCre@teOnline Magazine\n\nWeb Designer Magazine (UK)\n\nWeb Designer Magazine was a popular UK magazine purely dedicated to Web development, it was a relaunch of a previous magazine called Practical Internet and was known by the lengthy title Practical Internet Web Designer from issue 86 until dropping the prefix altogether by issue 95 in 2004.\n\nIt was initially published by Highbury House until they went into receivership on January 20th 2006 where it was bought by Imagine Publishing, which eventually it was sold to Future Publishing and then discontinued at issue 293 [confirmation required].\n\nTotal-Web-Design\n\nStrangely for a magazine dedicated to Web Development, there was no website for the magazine or even its sister title Practical Web Projects. This changed in mid-late 2004 when they bought the domain www.Total-Web-Design.com to represent both magazines.\n\nWeb Designer issue number 97 (from August 2004) had a behind the scenes look at the creation of the website, Luckily the Wayback machine has an archive of the website which you can view here: Total Web Design\n\nEditors\n\nIt was edited by Thomas Watson from the rename of Practical Internet in 2003 until issue 101 where it was taken over by Mark Hattersley in issue 104. Issue 102-103 did not have a named editor and was simply signed off by The Web Designer Team.\n\nIssues\n\nEach issue had a main focus but they all contained tutorials for a wide variety of software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, PHP and Flash.\n\nThe issues we know about are listed in the table below:\n\nNumber Date Title 86 2003-10 Create Amazing Websites 87 2003-11 Sound and Vision 88 2003-12 Futuristic Web Design 89 2004-01 2004’s Most influential Designers 90 2004-02 Build Brilliant Flash Games 91 2004-03 Dreamweaver Power Tips 92 2004-04 Think like a Webmaster 93 2004-05 ? 94 2004-05 ? 95 2004-06 The Perfect Web Site Makeover 96 2004-07 Make your site sticky 97 2004-08 Photoshop Secrets 98 2004-09 Build Amazing Sites that Work 99 2004-10 Power Up Dreamweaver 100 2004-11 100 professional Web Design Tips 101 2004-12 Design on a Budget (Web Designer Man!) 102 2005-01 Get Your work Noticed 103 2005-02 Hit the Web Template Jackpot 104 2005-03 Dreamweaver vs Golive 105 2005-04 Pocket Web site Design 106 2005-05 RSS 107 2005-06 Stunning Website Construction 108 2005-06 Create an online community\n\nWD Game Related Tutorials\n\nThe magazine had plenty of interesting web programming and graphic creation content, but as the focus of this site is on games development here is a list of the Game related tutorials.\n\nMost of these are for Flash game development but there are also a few Pixel Art tutorials for photoshop mixed in for good measure.\n\nIssue # Category Author Title 95 Flash Lee Groombridge Create a cool games console interface 95 Flash Robert Firebaugh Learn how to animate characters in flash 95 Flash Mark Shufflebottom Create an intro animation with Flash MX 2004 96 Photoshop Andy Stewart Create A Perfect Pixel Art House In Photoshop 96 Photoshop Zooey Ball Build An Animated Pixel Art Cityscape 97 Flash Darren Richardson Create an interactive animated flash quiz 101 Flash Mark Shufflebottom Create a stunning flash animation with Swift 3D\n\nWeb Designer issue 101 also had a behind the scenes look at the website for Myst IV Revelation which was implemented in Flash MX 2004 and provided a game-like experience.\n\nWeb Techniques\n\nWeb Techniques was a US magazine that started in February 1996 and ran until February 2002 when it rebranded as New Architect.\n\nRelevant Articles\n\nIssue Date Name Author March 1997 An Internet Game Server In Java Andy Wilson March 1997 Programming Web Games in C Andrew Davison March 1997 A Java-Based High-Score Server Neil Bartlett March 1997 Extending VRML with Realspace Sue Wilcox\n\nProgramming magazines\n\nThere is a lot of overlap between game development and general programming, so many game programmers in the industry would have subscriptions to general programming magazines such as the ones we have in this section.\n\nTitle Notes MSDN Journal Windows Development Journal from Microsoft from March 2000 - November 2019 Develop (The Apple Technical Journal) Apple development journal from 1991-? OS2 Developer IBM OS/2 Programming magazine from 1989-?\n\nGeneral PC Magazines\n\nThere are many magazines related to the PC both past and present, however only a few of them have interesting articles about game development, the ones we know about are listed in the table below.\n\nTitle Notes PC Magazine Occassionally had a few articles related to game development or programming\n\nPC Magazine (UK)\n\nPC magazine called itself “the independent guide to IBM-standard personal computing” and was available from April 1992 until it ceased publication in 2002.\n\nIssue # Title Author Notes VOL 13; NUMBER 21 (1994) Power Programming: Real Games for Windows Thielen, D Not available online VOL 15; NUMBER 14 (1996) Power Programming: Using Microsoft’s high-speed Direct Draw API in an arcade-style action game Grell, G.\n\nPC Plus\n\nIssue # Title Author Notes ISSUE 126 (1997) Programmers World: Reviewed this month are a library of useful program source code for Delphi, a DirectX toolkit for VB game programmers, and MSDN\n\nReferences"
