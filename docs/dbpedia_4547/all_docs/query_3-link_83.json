        "text": "Target Circle is a voluntary loyalty program. By joining or using Target Circle you agree to these Target Circle Terms and the Privacy Policy then in effect, including but not limited to the Financial Incentive Program disclosure in Section 6. Target may update the Target Circle Terms or make any changes to the Target App or to the Site at any time without notice. You agree to any updates to the Target Circle Terms by continuing to participate in the program.\n\nIn the Target Circle Terms, these words are defined as follows:\n\nTarget Circle is a loyalty program offered by Target Corporation.\n\nTarget Circle Terms are these terms that govern the Target Circle program.\n\nTarget Circle Deals are Target Circle-specific discounts and promotions that will apply automatically to your purchase when you identify as a Target Circle member at checkout.\n\nTarget Circle Rewards are rewards which can be earned by Target Circle members.\n\nTarget Circle Bonus is a personalized offer that you may get while being a member of Target Circle either to receive additional savings or promotional items or to earn Target Circle Rewards.\n\nTarget Circle Card (formerly RedCard) means Target Debit Card, Target Credit Card, Target™ Mastercard®, and Target Circle Card Account (Target Circle Card Reloadable Account).\n\nCommunity Giving Program is the program which provides Target Circle members the opportunity to earn and cast votes to help direct where Target makes its Donation to Nonprofits.\n\nNonprofits are the nonprofit organizations selected by Target for the Community Giving Program.\n\nDonation is the charitable donation Target makes to Nonprofits in the Community Giving Program.\n\nVoting Period is the time period during which Target Circle members can cast votes for Nonprofits in the Community Giving Program.\n\nReceiving Target Circle Benefits\n\nWhen you are a Target Circle member, in order to receive, earn and redeem the Target Circle benefits, you need to provide your first and last name and a valid email address in your Target account. In order to receive birthday rewards, you also need to provide your birthday (month and day) in your Target Circle account.\n\nTo earn Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes, you must identify yourself as a Target Circle member when you make a purchase at Target. When you make a purchase in Target stores, you can identify yourself as a Target Circle member at checkout by entering your mobile telephone number (provided that you have already enrolled as a member by providing your first and last name and a valid email address, as stated above, and have provided a valid U.S. mobile telephone number in your Target Circle account), by scanning the Wallet barcode in the Target App, or by paying with the Target Circle Card connected to your Target Circle account. As of January 18, 2023, Target Circle Cards can no longer be connected to a Target Circle account. If you connected your Target Circle Card to your Target Circle account prior to January 18, 2023, you can continue to use that Target Circle Card to identify yourself as Target Circle member as long as you do not change the Target Circle Card number connected to your Target Circle account. You need to provide a valid United States mobile telephone number in your Target account if you want to use your mobile telephone number to identify yourself as a Target Circle member at checkout. When you make a purchase on Target.com or in the Target App, you can identify yourself as a Target Circle member by signing into your Target account before you place your order.\n\nFor in-store transactions, if you identify yourself as a Target Circle member in a single transaction using multiple identification methods (e.g., provide your telephone number and pay with the Wallet) that are not associated with the same Target Circle account, Target Circle benefits will be awarded to and/or redeemed from only one of the associated Target Circle accounts, which will be determined at Target’s sole discretion.\n\nTarget Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes do not expire as long as you are actively participating in the Target Circle program. Target Circle Rewards will expire if you have not earned or redeemed any Target Circle Rewards for one year. As of September 28, 2023, if you have only provided a mobile telephone number, but have not completed your enrollment as a Target Circle member by providing your first and last name and your email address to associate with your account, then you will no longer be eligible to earn any new Target Circle Rewards; any Target Circle Rewards accumulated prior to September 28, 2023 will remain available for redemption (subject to the one-year expiration timeframe) if you complete your enrollment. If you do not participate in Target Circle for more than one year, Target reserves the right to expire any uncast Community Giving Program votes and/or delete your Target Circle account without notice to you. Neither Target Circle Rewards nor Community Giving Program votes will be reinstated if they expire. Community Giving Program votes may expire before the end of any particular Voting Period.\n\nOne Target Circle membership is permitted per guest. Your membership and any Target Circle benefits, including Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes, are non-transferable and are subject to future Target Circle Terms. Neither Target Circle Rewards nor Community Giving Program votes can be combined or transferred between Target or Target Circle accounts.\n\nTarget Circle may be used only for personal, family and household purposes. You agree that you will not use Target Circle for business or commercial purposes. Resellers are expressly excluded from Target Circle. If you purchase items in violation of these Target Circle Terms, including purchasing items for resale, Target reserves the right to not award Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes, to deduct improperly awarded Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes, and/or to terminate your participation in Target Circle.\n\nTo the extent that you sign up for any benefit via an offer from a third party, any fees paid to such third party may be non-refundable and will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth by the third party, and disclosed to you, at the time of sign up.\n\nOpting out of Target Circle and forfeiture of Target Circle Benefits.\n\nIf you no longer wish to be a Target Circle Member, you can opt out of Target Circle here. Opting out of Target Circle will not serve as cancellation of any Target Circle Card or Target Circle 360™ membership, if applicable to you; those cancellations are handled separately. Please call Target Card Services at 1-800-659-2396 for information about cancelling your Target Circle Card. To cancel your Target Circle 360 membership, please go to the Membership section of your Target account page.\n\nIf you opt out of Target Circle, any accumulated Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes will be deleted and you may not have access to other Target Circle benefits. If you later re-join Target Circle, any deleted Target Circle Rewards or Community Giving Program votes will not be reinstated.\n\nIf you or Target delete, suspend or close your Target Circle account or your Target account, any accumulated Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes will be deleted and you may not have access to other Target Circle benefits. Any deleted Target Circle Rewards or Community Giving Program votes will not be reinstated. In the event of any abusive or fraudulent activity related to Target Circle, and/or any violation of these Target Circle Terms, as determined in our sole discretion, Target reserves the right to make any adjustments to your Target Circle account and/or terminate your participation in Target Circle at any time.\n\nIf you enroll or participate in Target Circle using an invalid telephone number, such as a toll free number, international telephone number, invalid area code or invalid exchange, Target reserves the right to delete Target Circle Rewards, Community Giving Program votes and any other Target Circle benefit associated with the invalid telephone number. Target will not reinstate any deleted Target Circle Rewards, Community Giving Program votes or other Target Circle benefits if a valid telephone number is subsequently provided.\n\nTarget reserves the right to change, limit, modify or terminate Target Circle, the Target Circle Terms, and/or your membership, for any or no reason, at any time, with or without notice.\n\nTarget Circle Deals\n\nMany Target Circle-specific discounts and promotions, known as Target Circle Deals, will apply automatically to your purchase when you identify as a Target Circle member at checkout.\n\nTo redeem your Target Circle Deals in store, you may use your Wallet on the Target App on your mobile device, a printout of your barcode (photographs of barcodes will not be accepted) or enter the valid telephone number you provided for your Target Circle account. To redeem your Target Circle Deals on Target.com or the Target App, you must be logged in to your Target Circle account at checkout.\n\nFor any item, only one item level Target Circle Deal will apply and one category level Target Circle Deal will apply. Storewide Target Circle Deals or Target Circle Bonuses can be applied with item and category level Target Circle Offers. No more than one manufacturer coupon (paper or digital) can be combined with other discounts on any item, unless otherwise stated. Target Circle Deals may be valid in store and/or online, which will be stated in the terms of the Target Circle Deal. Each Target Circle Deal may be subject to a maximum number of items per transaction and/or uses per Target Circle member. Target Circle Deals are void if prohibited by law. Target Circle Deals expire at 11:59 PM (Pacific) on the stated date of expiration, unless otherwise noted. The Target Circle Deal value may not exceed the value of the item purchased. Target Circle Deals cannot be applied with a competitor price match; see Target’s Price Match Policy for full details. Target Circle Deals cannot be applied to previous purchases. All Target Circle Deals may not be available at all stores due to product availability. All Target Circle Deals have no cash value.\n\nTarget has the right to remove or cancel deals from Target Circle at any time and for any reason without notice.\n\nFor Target Circle Deals with a percentage discount, the actual savings may vary based on the item price at each store.\n\nThe numbers shown for total savings at the individual and global level for Target Circle Deals are specific to each account and do not reflect combined totals or the impact of any returns or exchanges that may be associated with those transactions.\n\nAll Target Circle Deals are subject to local and state laws and regulations. Such deals may be restricted or void in some locations. Target shall have no liability for the impact such laws or regulations may have on the ability to utilize such deals.\n\nAll descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products and prices described or depicted on Target Circle are subject to change at any time without notice.\n\nPricing, promotions and availability of items appearing in Target Circle Deals may vary by store location. Not all items are available in all markets. Descriptive, typographic and photographic errors are subject to correction and Target shall have no liability of any kind for such errors.\n\nTarget Circle Bonus\n\nA Target Circle Bonus is a personalized offer that allows a member of Target Circle either to receive additional savings or promotional items or to earn Target Circle Rewards. These general terms apply to each Target Circle Bonus. Target Circle members can find any available Target Circle Bonus, including the dates and details for the specific Target Circle Bonus, on Target.com or in the Target App.\n\nFor any Target Circle Bonus to receive additional savings or promotional items:\n\nTo access any available Target Circle Bonuses, you must sign in to your Target Circle account and activate the Target Circle Bonus that you want to use on your Target Circle Deals page; Target Circle Bonuses will not be applied at checkout unless you choose to apply it to a specific transaction.\n\nOnly a Target Circle Bonus that is on your Target Circle Deals page and is valid at the time of purchase can be redeemed. If you print your barcode and a Target Circle Bonus expires or is canceled before you redeem it, that Target Circle Bonus will not be valid.\n\nTo redeem Target Circle Bonuses, you may use the Target App on your mobile device or a printout of your barcode. Photographs of barcodes will not be accepted. You may also redeem Target Circle Bonuses using the valid telephone number you provided for your Target Circle account.\n\nTarget Circle Bonuses may be valid in store and/or online, which will be stated in the terms of the Target Circle Bonus. Each Target Circle Bonus may be subject to a maximum number of items per transaction and/or uses per Target Circle member. Target Circle Bonuses are void if prohibited by law. Target Circle Bonuses expire at 11:59 PM (Pacific) on the stated date of expiration, unless otherwise noted. The Target Circle Bonus value may not exceed the value of the item purchased. Target Circle Bonuses cannot be applied with a competitor price match; see Target’s Price Match Policy for full details. Target Circle Bonuses cannot be applied to previous purchases. All Target Circle Bonuses may not be available at all stores due to product availability. All Target Circle Bonuses have no cash value.\n\nTarget has the right to remove or cancel Target Circle Bonuses at any time and for any reason without notice.\n\nFor Target Circle Bonuses with a percentage discount, the actual savings may vary based on the item price at each store.\n\nThe numbers shown for total savings at the individual and global level for Target Circle Bonuses are specific to each account and do not reflect combined totals or the impact of any returns or exchanges that may be associated with those transactions.\n\nAll Target Circle Bonuses are subject to local and state laws and regulations. Such bonuses may be restricted or void in some locations. Target shall have no liability for the impact such laws or regulations may have on the ability to utilize such bonuses.\n\nAll descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products and prices described or depicted in connection with Target Circle Bonuses are subject to change at any time without notice.\n\nPricing, promotions and availability of items appearing in Target Circle Bonuses may vary by store location. Not all items are available in all markets. Descriptive, typographic and photographic errors are subject to correction and Target shall have no liability of any kind for such errors.\n\nFor any Target Circle Bonus to earn Target Circle Rewards or other incentives:\n\nYou must activate the Target Circle Bonus, make qualifying purchases or complete qualifying actions as stated in the specific bonus, and identify yourself as a Target Circle member to receive the stated Target Circle Rewards or other incentives stated in the terms of the Target Circle Bonus.\n\nA qualifying purchase for purposes of a Target Circle Bonus is a transaction that meets all of the purchase requirements described in your bonus, such as a minimum purchase threshold or the use of a Target service (e.g., Drive Up or Order Pickup). A qualifying purchase excludes all items that do not earn Target Circle Rewards, as listed elsewhere in these Target Circle Terms.\n\nA pre-ordered item is eligible for a Target Circle Bonus only if it is shipped during the stated Target Circle Bonus period. Online, Same Day Delivery, Order Pickup and Drive Up purchases are eligible when the order is placed within the Target Circle Bonus period, but credit for the purchase isn’t received until the items ship or are ready for pickup, respectively. If qualifying purchases are returned, reversed or canceled, this may cause the transaction to no longer qualify for a Target Circle Bonus, which will be determined by Target in its sole discretion.\n\nFor any Target Circle Bonus with minimum purchase thresholds, the amount is calculated before other discounts (other than Target Circle Deals and sale prices) and taxes are applied. Your purchase subtotal should be more than the required purchase threshold to qualify.\n\nExcept for online orders that include Target Plus™ items or use the Same Day Delivery service, an online order qualifies as one purchase transaction even if items in the order are delivered separately or you use the Order Pickup or Drive Up service for some or all of the items in the online order. Online orders can include both Target Plus items and Target.com items. For purposes of a Target Circle Bonus, the Target Plus items and the Target.com items are separate purchase transactions and each purchase transaction is eligible to be a qualifying purchase. If you use the Same Day Delivery service, the Same Day Delivery items are a separate purchase transaction from any other items in the online order, and each purchase transaction is eligible to be a qualifying purchase.\n\nPlease allow 24 hours for your Target Circle Bonus to advance after in-store purchases. For online or Target App purchases, you will see your Target Circle Bonus advance once your order ships, is picked up or is delivered by a shopper if you use the Same Day Delivery service. Non-transaction Target Circle Bonus progress will reflect within 24 hours from the completion of the qualifying action.\n\nFor any Target Circle Bonus that awards Target Circle Rewards, Target reserves the right to deduct any Target Circle Rewards earned from a Target Circle Bonus from your Target Circle account if you no longer qualify for the Target Circle Bonus due to the return, reversal or cancelation of qualifying purchases or are no longer deemed to have completed the qualifying action.\n\nTarget Circle Bonuses are valid only for the fully enrolled Target Circle member who received the bonus and cannot be shared, copied or transferred. Limit one Target Circle Reward per Target Circle member per Target Circle Bonus. Not all Target Circle members receive Target Circle Bonuses and Target Circle Bonuses may vary. You must be a member of Target Circle at the time you make qualifying purchases or complete qualifying actions, respectively, and at the time the Target Circle Rewards are added to your Target Circle account. All other Target Circle Terms remain in effect, including the circumstances in which Target Circle Rewards expire.\n\nTarget Circle Rewards\n\nAs a member of Target Circle, you are eligible to earn Target Circle Rewards.\n\nTarget Circle Rewards can only be redeemed for certain merchandise or services at Target. Target Circle Rewards have no cash value and cannot be redeemed for cash.\n\nOnly purchases made at Target stores or online at Target.com or in the Target App or specified qualifying actions at or specified by Target are eligible to earn Target Circle Rewards.\n\nTarget Circle Rewards are not earned on the following:\n\nadult beverage purchases;\n\npurchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter;\n\npurchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, and Target Optical;\n\npurchases made on the Shipt App and tips for shoppers;\n\npurchases made from Target through third-party sites such as Google Express;\n\npurchases of Target GiftCards;\n\npurchases of Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards;\n\ntaxes, bottle deposits, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges;\n\npayment of any Target Circle Card balance, debit card cash withdrawals at checkout and payments for insufficient funds;\n\nprior purchases; or\n\nwhere otherwise prohibited by law.\n\nOther restrictions may apply to earning Target Circle Rewards.\n\nTo redeem Target Circle Rewards you will need a Target Circle account, including your telephone number if you joined Target Circle by providing your telephone number. Once your Target account profile is complete, you can redeem Target Circle Rewards. To redeem on your next purchase in Target stores, elect to apply the Target Circle Rewards in your Target Circle account, and then either provide your mobile telephone number (if you provided your mobile telephone number) or scan your Wallet in the Target App during checkout. To redeem on Target.com or the Target App, apply the Target Circle Rewards to your next online order during checkout on Target.com or the Target App.\n\nWhen you elect to redeem Target Circle Rewards, the entire amount will be applied to your next purchase as a Target discount. You cannot elect to apply only a portion of your Target Circle Rewards to a purchase. If your purchase is less than the amount of the Target Circle Rewards you have applied, the remaining amount may be unavailable for a second transaction until the first transaction has completed processing.\n\nTarget Circle Rewards are applied to the total purchase amount after all other discounts have been applied to the purchase transaction, except that if you use your Target Circle Card to pay for the purchase, any applicable Target Circle Card 5% discount will be applied to the transaction after the Target Circle Rewards are redeemed.\n\nTarget Circle Rewards cannot be redeemed for the following:\n\nadult beverage purchases;\n\ndairy product purchases;\n\npurchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter;\n\npurchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, Target Optical and Target Plus Partners;\n\nSame Day Delivery purchases, purchases made on the Shipt app and tips for shoppers;\n\npurchases made from Target through third-party sites such as Google Express;\n\npurchases of Target GiftCards;\n\npurchases of specialty gift cards and Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards;\n\npurchases fulfilled via email (for example, video game digital downloads and digital specialty gift cards);\n\ntaxes, bottle deposits, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges;\n\npayment of any Target Circle Card balance, debit card cash withdrawals at checkout and payments for insufficient funds;\n\nprior purchases; or\n\nwhere otherwise prohibited by law.\n\nOther restrictions may apply to redeeming Target Circle Rewards.\n\nIf you return an item that was part of a purchase in which you redeemed Target Circle Rewards, the amount of your redeemed Target Circle Rewards will be credited to your Target Circle Rewards balance (up to the value of the returned item), and any remaining refund amount will be refunded according to Target’s return policy. If items that earned Target Circle Rewards are returned, the associated Target Circle Rewards may be removed from your Target Circle Rewards balance. Target reserves the right to take your Target Circle Rewards to a negative balance (i.e., a balance in your account of less than zero Target Circle Rewards). In such event you will not have redeemable Target Circle Rewards until the balance of Target Circle Rewards in your account is greater than zero.\n\nBeginning April 7, 2024, Target Circle members will no longer earn Target Circle Earnings rewards (the former name of Target Circle Rewards) at a rate of 1% of the eligible purchase amount every time a member uses a non-Target Circle Card form of payment. Any previously earned Target Circle Earnings rewards will roll over as Target Circle Rewards on the same terms and conditions as existed at the time they were received, subject to all other requirements set forth in these Target Circle Terms.\n\nFor Target Circle members who had a 1% Target Circle Earnings rewards balance as of September 4, 2019, the unspent earnings were transferred to an eGiftCard which can be found in your Target account or in the Wallet in the Target App. The eGiftCard does not expire and can be redeemed for merchandise or services other than gift cards and prepaid cards at Target stores or on Target.com but cannot be redeemed for cash or credit except where required by law. View the eGiftCard for terms and conditions.\n\nTarget Circle Digital Manufacturer Coupons\n\nManufacturer coupons are digital manufacturer coupons available through Target Circle. Each coupon is valid for a single use per Target Circle account, and savings do not stack with paper manufacturer coupons. The terms and conditions applicable to each coupon will vary and will be stated at the time of adding the coupon to your Target Circle Deals page.\n\nTo access any available coupons, you must sign in to your Target Circle account and activate the coupons that you want to use on your Target Circle Deals page; coupons are not applied at checkout unless you choose to apply it to the specific transaction.\n\nOnly those Target Circle coupons that are activated on your Target Circle Deals page at the time of purchase can be redeemed. If you print your list and a coupon expires or is canceled before you redeem the coupon, that coupon will not be valid.\n\nTo redeem Target Circle coupons, you may use the Target App on your mobile device or a printout of your barcode. Photographs of barcodes will not be accepted. You may also redeem coupons using the valid telephone number you provided for your Target account.\n\nTarget has the right to remove or cancel coupons from Target Circle, and from your Target Circle Deals page, at any time and for any reason without notice.\n\nFor coupons with a percentage discount, the actual savings may vary based on the item price at each store.\n\nThe numbers shown for total savings at the individual and global level for Target Circle coupons are specific to each account and do not reflect combined totals or the impact of any returns or exchanges that may be associated with those transactions.\n\nAll Target Circle coupons are subject to local and state laws and regulations. Such offers may be restricted or void in some locations. Target shall have no liability for the impact such laws or regulations may have on the ability to utilize such offers.\n\nAll descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products and prices described or depicted on Target Circle are subject to change at any time without notice.\n\nPricing, promotions and availability of items appearing in Target Circle coupons may vary by store location. Not all items are available in all markets. Descriptive, typographic and photographic errors are subject to correction and Target shall have no liability of any kind for such errors.\n\nBirthday Reward\n\nWhen your birth date is included in your Target account, on or near your birthday you will receive a birthday reward. The reward can be accessed either in the Target App or on Target.com. The reward will contain the full details on how to redeem the reward, and will include any applicable redemption restrictions and expiration date. Birthday rewards given will vary and are limited to one award per year per Target Circle account.\n\nCommunity Giving Program\n\nTarget may run multiple local Community Giving Programs. By participating in Target Circle you have access to one Community Giving Program associated with your preferred store location as designated in your Target account settings. In each Community Giving Program, Target will make a Donation to be allocated among Nonprofits. Eligibility of the Nonprofits will be determined by Target in its sole discretion. Multiple store locations may be tied to a single Community Giving Program. The Nonprofits, Donation amount and Voting Period may vary by Community Giving Program. The allocation of the Donation among the Nonprofits for each Community Giving Program will be based on the percentage of votes each Nonprofit receives during the applicable Voting Period for that Community Giving Program. With respect to each Community Giving Program, the list of participating Nonprofits, the dates comprising the applicable Voting Period, and the Donation to be divided among the Nonprofits can be seen by logging on to and viewing the Target Circle voting screen on the Target App or at Target.com/circle.\n\nAs a member of Target Circle, every time you make an eligible purchase and identify yourself as a Target Circle member, you earn one vote. Only purchases made at Target stores or online at Target.com or in the Target App are eligible to earn Community Giving Program votes.\n\nVotes are not earned on a purchase transaction that is comprised only of one or more of the following: adult beverage purchases; purchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter; purchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, and Target Optical; purchases made on the Shipt App and tips for shoppers; purchases made from Target through third-party sites such as Google Express; purchases of Target GiftCards; purchases of Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards; taxes, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges; payment of any Target Circle Card balance, debit card cash withdrawals at checkout and payments for insufficient funds; prior purchases; or where otherwise prohibited by law.\n\nTo cast Community Giving Program votes, follow the instructions located under Target Circle benefits in your Target account via the Target App or Target.com/circle. You must have access to internet through your own device to participate. You must be a Target Circle member in good standing to participate. Votes have no cash value and do not represent an actual donation to any Nonprofit; rather, they are just the means to vote for allocation of the Donation from Target in each Community Giving Program. Target’s tally of votes is final. Each vote is intended for one-time use by you. If Target detects any inappropriate conduct related to votes or votes made outside the above guidelines, votes may be disregarded. In the event any aspect of Target Circle, including the voting, is disrupted in any way, Target reserves the right to allocate the Donation for any affected location in a fair and equitable manner, as determined by Target.\n\nFrom time to time, Target may provide the opportunity to cast Community Giving Program votes to direct additional or supplemental Donations. These opportunities may have terms and conditions in addition to or different from those provided in the Target Circle Terms. Unless otherwise stated, the Target Circle Terms will apply to any such opportunity.\n\nTarget Circle 360 is a subscription program that offers the benefits described in these Target Circle 360 Terms in addition to additional offers, deals and benefits to be determined by Target in its sole discretion. By joining Target Circle 360 you agree to these Target Circle 360 Terms and the Privacy Policy then in effect. Target may update the Target Circle 360 Terms or make any changes to the Target App or to the Site at any time without notice. You agree to any updates to the Target Circle 360 Terms by continuing to participate in the program.\n\nIn the Target Circle 360 Terms, these words are defined as follows:\n\nTarget Circle 360 Terms are these terms that govern the Target Circle 360 subscription program, including the Target.com Terms & Conditions.\n\nTarget Circle 360 Membership\n\nOne Target Circle 360 membership is permitted per guest. Your membership and any Target Circle 360 benefits are non-transferable and are subject to future Target Circle 360 Terms.\n\nTarget Circle 360 may be used only for personal, family and household purposes. You agree that you will not use Target Circle 360 for business or commercial purposes.\n\nTarget reserves the right to change, limit, modify or terminate Target Circle 360, the Target Circle 360 Terms, the associated benefits and/or your membership, for any or no reason, at any time, with or without notice.\n\nIf you no longer wish to be a Target Circle 360 Member, you can cancel your Target Circle 360 membership by visiting the Membership section of your Target account page. Canceling Target Circle 360 will not serve as cancellation of your Target Circle membership or any Target Circle Card, if applicable to you; those cancellations are handled separately. If you no longer wish to be a Target Circle member, you can opt out of Target Circle here. Please call Target Card Services at 1-800-659-2396 for information about cancelling your Target Circle Card.\n\nThe membership fee for Target Circle 360 is non-refundable. In addition, to the extent that you sign up for any benefit with a third-party partner, any fees paid may be non-refundable and will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth by the third-party partner, and disclosed to you, at the time of sign up.\n\nAutomatic Renewal of Membership Fees\n\nBy authorizing Target to process your payment for a Target Circle 360 membership fee and Target Circle 360 membership fee renewals, you accept all of these terms, conditions, limitations and requirements.\n\nWhen you sign up for a Target Circle 360 membership (or at the end of your free trial membership, if appliable), Target will process your payment for the first Target Circle 360 membership fee. On the day your Target Circle 360 membership is automatically renewed, Target will process your payment for the Target Circle 360 membership fee renewal. Your Target Circle 360 membership will remain in effect until it is canceled.\n\nThe cost of a Target Circle 360 membership is disclosed at the time you sign up for a Target Circle 360 membership, and the fee is nonrefundable. To prevent the automatic renewal of your Target Circle 360 membership fee, you must cancel your membership before your membership is set to renew.\n\nOnly valid credit cards or a Target Debit Card can be used to purchase a Target Circle 360 membership. You cannot use a debit card, other than the Target Debit Card, to pay for a Target Circle 360 membership. Target GiftCards may be used as payment for the initial Target Circle 360 membership purchase; however, a valid credit card or Target Debit Card will still be required when you first sign up, and will be used to pay for membership renewals. Third-party installment plans (e.g., Affirm and PayPal® Pay in 4), PayPal® and Apple Pay® cannot be used to pay for Target Circle 360 memberships at this time. You are responsible for any fees or charges that your bank or financial institution may apply.\n\nThe amount of each Target Circle 360 membership fee renewal will be billed to the credit card or Target Debit Card you authorize for the initial Target Circle 360 membership purchase, and your card will be billed on the day your membership renews. If we are unable to process your payment for a membership fee renewal, your Target Circle 360 membership will not be renewed and will expire.\n\nIf there are changes related to the cost of the membership, we will notify you through the email address associated with your Target.com account. If we are unable to renew your Target Circle 360 membership with the payment card you used when you started your membership, we will attempt to renew your membership by charging another payment card in your Target.com account for your Target Circle 360 membership renewal. If we successfully update your membership with a different payment card, that payment card will be used for future Target Circle 360 membership renewals unless you change the payment method.
