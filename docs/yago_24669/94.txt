Charles VII (1403 † 1461), called The Victorious, king of France from 1422 to 1461, son of Charles VI and Isabeau of Bavière.

The effigies of Charles VII and his wife, Marie of Anjou, were destroyed in 1793. However, their bust effigies are represented in the Basilica Saint-Denis. They were restored from vestiges saved. The bust of Charles VII and Marie d'Anjou were returned beside the recumbent effigies of Charles VI and Isabeau of Bavière in the cathedral of Saint-Denis in the late 1990s. Installed on columns, husband and wife are depicted face to face.
