        "text": "The marriage of King Richard II and the seven or eight year-old Isabella of Valois took place at Calais. Isabella was the daughter of Charles VI, King of France and Isabeau of Bavaria. Richard was near thirty years old but the marriage went ahead because it was part of a peace treaty between the English and French Kings. ยน\n\nKing Henry attempted to build an alliance with John, the Duke of Burgundy who was involved in a power struggle with the Armagnacs for control of France. John was acting as regent due to the poor mental health of the French king, Charles VI. Henry sent an embassy to Paris to discuss terms. ยน\n\nIn 1414 France was in the midst of a civil war between the Burgundians and the Armagnacs. While Charles VI, the French king, had joined the Armagnacs, Henry V, the English King, saw an opportunity to reclaim lost lands in France and came in on the side of the Burgundians. Henry's plan was to invade France but he needed a good reason. He gave the French king a list of demands including the French throne, the restoration of the Angevin empire and the hand of the French king's daughter in marriage. If the demands were not be met Henry would go to war. Henry could claim the French throne through a claim first made by his great-grandfather King Edward III that started the Hundred Years War.||In August of 1415, invasion plans were completed and Henry's army met at Portchester Castle where they boarded ships to take them across the English Channel to France."
