However, their bust effigies are represented in the Basilica Saint-Denis. They were restored from vestiges saved. The bust of Charles VII and Marie d'Anjou were returned beside the recumbent effigies of Charles VI and Isabeau of Bavière in the cathedral of Saint-Denis in the late 1990s. Installed on columns, husband and wife are depicted face to face.\n\nCharles VII and Marie d'Anjou © Philippe Berthé / Centre des monuments nationaux"
