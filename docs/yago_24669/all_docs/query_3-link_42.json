        "text": "1444.\n\nWith the struggle in France moving against them in the 1440s, the English wished to use a marriage negotiation for Henry VI to obtain a settlement. At Tours in May 1444, Suffolk (William de la Pole) promised to surrender Maine in exchange for a two‚Äêyear truce and Henry was betrothed to Margaret of Anjou, niece of Charles VII of France. The break in hostilities lasted only until 1449 when Charles attacked Normandy."
