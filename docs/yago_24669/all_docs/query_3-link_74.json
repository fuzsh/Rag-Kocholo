        "text": "CHATEAU OF LOCHES\n\nTHE CHATEAU\n\nThe Château of Loches is located in the Loire Valley in France. It was constructed in the 9th century, 500 meters above the Indre River, and dominates the town of Loches.\n\nThe château was designed and occupied by Henry II of England and his son, Richard the Lionheart during the 12th century. The castle withstood the assaults by the French king Philip II in their wars for control of France. It was eventually upgraded into a huge military fortress.\n\nLater kings enlarged the building in the Renaissance style converting it from a fort to a hunting lodge. Loches was the most important town in the southern Touraine, so in medieval times the court came here frequently. The castle would become a favorite retreat of Charles VII of France who gave it to his mistress, Agnès Sorel, as her residence.\n\nLoches was later converted for use as a state prison by his son, King Louis XI who had lived there as a child but preferred the royal castle at Amboise.\n\nThe power of this fortress contrasts with the grace of the Royal Apartments whose façade overlooks the Indre River and the medieval town of Loches.\n\nAs you enter, the rooms of the Royal Apartments are themed to coordinate with the people Charles VII, then Jeanne d'Arc, Agnès Sorel, and Anne de Bretagnes prayer room.\n\nTHE WOMEN\n\nJoan of Arc\n\n1412-1431\n\nBackground\n\nThe French king, Charles VI, acceded to the throne in 1380, but from 1392 was accused of mental insanity and therefore was later called Charles the Mad. The struggle for regency among several of Charles's relatives resulted in a civil war. As well there was a long-standing and on-going feud with the Dukes of Burgundy. England's King Henry V took advantage of this and in 1415 invaded France.\n\nAfter the Battle of Agincourt, Charles was forced to relinquish Normandy to Henry and recognize him as heir to the throne of France in the Treaty of Troves in 1420. However, both died in 1422.\n\nCharles VII of France, claimant to the crown as the son of Charles VI (called the Dauphin), now had the support of the south of France behind him. The north of France supported England's next king, Henry VI.\n\nIn 1428, with the siege of Orléans, the French seemed defeated.\n\nJoan of Arc tapestry\n\nIn the little village of Domrémy, on the border between Lorraine and Champagne, a teenage girl named Jeanne d'Arc, believing she had been given a divine mission, demanded that the Duke of Lorraine give her the soldiers and resources necessary to get to Chinon and the dauphin. Granted an escort of five veteran soldiers and a letter of referral to Charles by the governor of Vaucouleurs, Jeanne rode to Chinon, where Charles was in residence, arriving there on 10 March 1429.\n\nWhen Jeanne arrived at Chinon, Charles had decided to test her and disguised himself as one of his courtiers. He milled around with all of them. Jeanne, dressed in men's clothing, entered the chamber and immediately identified him, bowed low to him and embraced his knees, declaring \"God give you a happy life, sweet King!\" Despite attempts to claim that another man was, in fact, the King, Charles was eventually forced to admit that he was, indeed, the king.\n\nCharles VII of France, and Jeanne d'Arc\n\nThereafter Jeanne referred to him as \"Dauphin\" or \"Gentle Dauphin\" until he was crowned in Reims four months later. After a private conversation between the two (during which, Charles later stated Jeanne knew secrets about him that he had voiced only in silent prayer to God), Charles became inspired, and filled with confidence. But he didn't act immediately.\n\nAfter the take-over of the city of Orléans, Charles received Jeanne d'Arc again in the Castle of Loches. Here she finally convinced him to proceed to Rheims and take the crown.\n\nThe room where Jeanne d'Arc met with Charles VII on June 3 and 5, 1429.\n\nCredits: Loches blog by F. Hagnere.\n\nWall plaque in Loches regarding Jeanne d'Arc\n\nCredit: Days on the Claise blog by Susan.\n\nJeanne d'Arc then set about leading the French forces at Orléans, forcing the English to lift the siege and thus turning the tide of the war. After the French won the Battle of Patay, Charles was crowned King Charles VII of France on 17 July 1429, in Reims Cathedral.\n\nJeanne was later captured by the Burgundians who handed her over to the English. Tried for heresy she was burned at the stake on 30 May 1431. Charles VII did nothing to save the one to whom he owed his throne.\n\nPlace des Pyramides\n\nParis, France\n\nOther Monuments to Joan of Arc:\n\nSaint Joan of Arc statue, Notre-Dame Cathedral, Paris\n\nSaint Joan of Arc statue, Orléans, France\n\nSaint Joan of Arc chapel, Cathedral of Rheims\n\nAgnès Sorel\n\n1421-1450\n\nUnder the reign of Charles VII, Agnès Sorel (1420-1450), also known as the Lady of Beauty, stayed in the Royal Apartments. She was the first official mistress of a King of France. She met the king around 1443, when she was part of the household of the Duchess of Lorraine, the Queen's sister.\n\nAgnès Sorel was known as the Dame de beauté and was a mistress of King Charles VII of France.\n\nThe daughter of a soldier, Jean Soreau, and of Catherine de Maignelais, Sorel was 20 years old when she was first introduced to King Charles. At that time, she was holding a position in the household of Rene I of Naples, Charles' brother-in-law. As reflected in art of the day, she was an extraordinarily beautiful young woman, and was also extremely intelligent. The French king was immediately smitten by her charms and took her as his mistress; he even gave her the Château de Loches (where he had been persuaded by Joan of Arc to be crowned King of France) as her private residence.\n\nStained glass window, Agnès Sorel at Loches\n\nCredit: Days on the Claise blog by Susan.\n\nSoon, her presence was felt at the royal court in Chinon where her company was alleged to have brought the king out of a protracted depression. She had a very strong influence on him, and that, in addition to her extravagant tastes, earned her a number of powerful enemies at court.\n\nSuspicious Death\n\nAgnès gave birth to three daughters: Marie de Valois, Charlotte, and Jeanne de France. [Charlotte's son, Louis de Brézé, seigneur d'Anet, would in turn marry Diane de Poitiers, herself ultimately a famous royal courtesan.] While pregnant with their fourth child, she journeyed from Chinon in deep midwinter to join Charles on the campaign of 1450 in Jumièges, wanting to be with him as moral support. There, she suddenly became ill and died on 9 February at the age of 28.\n\nWhile the cause of death was originally thought to be dysentery, scientists have now concluded that Agnès died from being poisoned by mercury, making it likely that she was a victim of murder.\n\nCharles' son, the future King Louis XI, had been in open revolt against his father for the previous four years. It has been speculated that he had Agnès poisoned in order to remove what he may have considered her undue influence over the king. It was also speculated that French financier, noble and minister Jacques Coeur poisoned her, though that theory is widely discredited as an attempt to remove Coeur from the French court.\n\nDuring the Revolution, soldiers of the Indre, whose historical knowledge was not as great as their revolutionary zeal, took Sorel's tomb to be royal. They gashed the cover, violated the contents and dispersed her remains. The alabaster monument was restored in Paris under the First Empire.\n\nEach time I visited, her tomb was standing, alone, in one of the rooms. The cover fascinated me. The recumbent figure of Agnès lies with angels over her head, and lambs at her feet.\n\nFrom an old account published in 1926:\n\nThe body of Agnès Sorel was, according to her own request, transported to Loches and buried in the choir of the Collegiate Church of St. Ours, where it rested for many years. The beautiful tomb was first placed in the church, but was later removed to the tower where it stands to-day and where Agnes still reigns in beauty. Upon a sarcophagus of black marble is a reclining figure, modest and seemly, the hands folded upon the breast, two lambs guarding the feet, while two angels support the cushion upon which rests the lovely head of la belle des belles, whose face in life is said to have had the bloom of flowers in the springtime. The inscription upon the tomb is:\n\nHere lies the noble Damoyselle Agnès Seurelle, in her life time Lady of Beaulté, of Roquesserie, of Issouldun, of Vernon-sur-Seine. Kind and pitiful to all men, she gave liberally of her goods to the Church and to the poor. She died the ninth day of February of the Year of Grace 1449. Pray for her soul. Amen.\n\nTomb of Agnès Sorel\n\nTomb of Agnès Sorel\n\nIn 2005 French forensic scientist Philippe Charlier examined her remains and determined that the cause of death was mercury poisoning, but offered no opinion about whether she was murdered. Mercury was sometimes used in cosmetic preparations and this could therefore have been the reason for her death. It was at this time that her tomb was moved to the church of Saint-Ours (\"Collégiale Saint Ours\") in Loches.\n\nAnne de Bretagne\n\n1477-1514\n\nAnne de Bretagne\n\nMarble, by Jean Boucher (1870-1939)\n\nAnne of Brittany, Duchess was also known as Anne de Bretagne. [In the Breton language, her name is Anna Vreizh.]\n\nAnne, a Breton ruler, was to become queen to two successive French kings.\n\nShe was born in Nantes, Brittany on 25 January 1477 to Francis II, Duke of Brittany and Margaret of Foix. Her maternal grandparents were Queen Eleanor of Navarre and Gaston IV, Count of Foix.\n\nAnne de Bretagne was the godmother of our ancestor, Anne de Montmorency (also of the Foix family), and was named for her. Click the link Montmorency to read of him.\n\nUpon her father's death, Anne became sovereign Duchess of Brittany, Countess of Nantes, Montfort and Richmont and Viscountess of Limoges. In her time, she was the richest European woman.\n\n1st Marriage\n\nAnnes first marriage was arranged to be Maximilian I of Austria, considered to be the most suitable candidate. Her marriage with Maximilian, which took place at Rennes by proxy on 19 December 1490, conferred upon Anne the title Queen of the Romans, but proved to have serious consequences.\n\nThe French regarded it as a serious provocationit not only violated the Treaty of Verger (the King of France not having consented to the marriage) but, also;\n\nit placed the rule of Brittany in the hands of an enemy of France.\n\nThe marriage also proved ill-timed: the Habsburgs were too busy in Hungary to pay any serious attention to Brittany. The spring of 1491 brought new successes by the French general La Trémoille, and Charles VIII of France came to lay siege to Rennes.\n\nWhen Maximilian failed to come to his bride's assistance, Rennes fell.\n\nEngagement to Charles VIII\n\nAnne became engaged to Charles in the vault of the Jacobins in Rennes. Then, escorted by her army (ostensibly to show that she had willingly consented to the marriage), Anne went to Langeais to be married. Austria made diplomatic protests, claiming that the marriage was illegal because the bride was unwilling, that she was already legally married to Maximilian, and that Charles was legally betrothed to Margaret of Austria, Maximilian's daughter.\n\nWedding at Langeais\n\nThe second marriage of Anne of Brittany occurred in the great hall of the château on 6 December 1491. This marriage to King Charles VIII effected the permanent union of Brittany and France.\n\nWedding of Charles VIII and Anne de Bretagne\n\nAt the Château of Langeais, Loire, France\n\nAnne de Bretange, at 15 years of age, was not happy with the politically arranged marriage, which began badly. She and her cortège arrived for the wedding carrying two beds. After her marriage, she and the king often lived apart.\n\nCharles VIII of France\n\nCredits: Bibliothèque Nationale de France, 16th century\n\nShe was anointed and crowned Queen of France at Saint-Denis on 8 February 1492. She was forbidden by her husband to use the title \"Duchess of Brittany\", which became a bone of contention between them.\n\nAnne ended up being pregnant for most of her married life, and lived primarily in the royal castles of Ambois, Loches and Plessis, or in the towns of Lyon, Grenoble or Moulins (when the king was in Italy). With Charles VIII's conquest of Naples, she became Queen of Sicily and titular Queen of Jerusalem.\n\nWith Charles VIII's conquest of Naples, she became Queen of Sicily and titular Queen of Jerusalem. The regency powers during this time when he was in Italy were exercised by his sister, Anne of Beaujeu.\n\nThis marriage produced four living children, none of whom survived early childhood:\n\nCharles Orland (11 Oct 1492  16 Dec 1495). A healthy and intelligent child, he was doted on by his parents, who both suffered terrible grief when he died suddenly of the measles.\n\nThe tomb for this child and his next younger brother, Charles, lies in St. Gatien Cathedral, Tours, France.\n\nCharles, who lived for less than a month.\n\nFrancis, who died almost immediately after birth.\n\nAnne, who also died almost immediately after birth.\n\nTomb of Charles-Orland and Charles\n\nCredits: Michel Colombe (1506).\n\nThese tragedies caused a great deal of pain to Anne, who prayed openly for a son after the death of Francis.\n\nWindow view at the Château de Loches.\n\nCredit: Days on the Claise blog by Susan.\n\nIn one of the oldest parts of the château are the bedroom and oratory of Anne of Brittany. From these rooms there is a lovely view of the Indre and of the old town with its steep gables, crenelated roofs, and picturesque chimneys. The walls of the little oratory are richly decorated with exquisite carvings of the Queen's devices, the tasseled cord and the ermine, which even a coat of whitewash has not deprived of their beauty.\n\nOratory of Anne de Bretagne at Loches\n\nCredits: Stock Photos.\n\nAnne of Brittany with Sts Anne, Ursula, and Helen\n\nCredits: Jean Bourdichon.\n\nDetail of Anne of Brittany with the saints.\n\nCharles died in 1498, two and a half years after his retreat from Italy, as the result of an accident. While playing jeu de paume (tennis) in Amboise he struck his head on the lintel of a door. A few hours later, he fell into a sudden coma, and then died.\n\nWhen Charles died, Anne was 21 years old and childless. Legally, she was now obliged to marry the new king, Louis XII; however, he was already married, to Charles VIII's sister, Joan. On 19 August 1498, at Étampes, she agreed to marry Louis if he obtained an annulment from Joan within a year. If she was gambling that the annulment would be denied, she lost, for Louis's first marriage was dissolved by the Pope before the end of the year.\n\nIn the meantime, in October 1498, Anne returned to rule Brittany. Among other official tasks, she ordered production of a coin bearing her name. She took the opportunity to tour the Duchy, visiting many places she had never been able to see as a child. She made triumphal entries into the cities of the duchy, where her vassals received her sumptuously.\n\nThird Marriage - Louis XII\n\nAnne married Louis XII on 8 January 1499. She wore white, setting a precedent for future brides. No longer a child, but rather a dowager queen, she was determined to ensure the recognition of her rights as sovereign duchess from now on. Although her new husband exercised the ruler's powers in Brittany, he formally recognized her right to the title \"Duchess of Brittany\" and issued decisions in her name.\n\nAnne bore nine children by Louis XII, only two of them not stillborn or miscarried:\n\nClaude of France (14 October 1499 -20 July 1524).\n\nAs Duchess, Anne fiercely defended the independence of her Duchy. She arranged the marriage of her daughter, Claude, to Charles of Luxembourg in 1501, to reinforce the Franco-Spanish alliance and ensure French success in the Italian Wars. But her husband, King Louis XII, broke off the marriage when it became likely that Anne would not produce a male heir. Instead, he arranged a marriage between Claude and the heir to the French throne, Francis of Angoulême, his cousin. Anne was determined to maintain Breton independence and refused until death to sanction the marriage, pushing instead for Claude to marry Charles, or for the Duchy to be inherited by her other daughter, Renée. All of that was thwarted after her death, and her daughter, Claude's, marriage to the king's choice, Francis, took place the year after Anne died. Her father had resolved \"to marry his mice to none but the rats of his own barn\" [the king's words].\n\nRenée of France (1510-1575) married Ercole II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara.\n\nAnne was a highly intelligent woman who spent much of her time on the administration of Brittany. She was described as shrewd, proud and haughty in manner. She made the safeguarding of Breton autonomy, and the preservation of the Duchy outside the French crown, her life's work, although that goal would prove failed shortly after her death.\n\nShe was also a patron of the arts and enjoyed music. A prolific collector of tapestries, it is very likely that the unicorn tapestries now on view at The Cloisters museum in New York City were commissioned by her in celebration of her wedding to Louis XII. She also commissioned a book of French manuscripts (a Book of Hours), known as The Great Hours of Anne of Brittany. She also instituted the Queen's Maids of Honour at the court.\n\nAnne de Bretagne, as Queen, receiving from\n\nAntoine Dufour, a book in praise of famous women.\n\n1506, at the Musee Dobree near Nantes, France.\n\nAnne kept a box of gemstones and would randomly pick one and give it to her visitors.\n\nAt her marriage to Charles VIII, aged 15, Anne was described as a young and rosy-cheeked girl; by the time of her marriage to Louis, aged 22, after seven pregnancies with no surviving children, she was described as pale-faced and wan. By the end of her life, at 36, she had been pregnant 14 times, with seven of the children stillborn. Of the remaining seven, only two girls survived childhood. She spent as much time as possible with her children.\n\nDeath\n\nAnne failed to survive the winter of 1513-1514, dying of a kidney-stone attack at the Château of Blois on 9 January 1514. She was buried in the necropolis of Saint Denis. Her funeral was of exceptional length, lasting 40 days, and inspiring all future French royal funerals until the 18th century. The Requiem for Anne was probably composed by the famous composer Johannes Prioris.\n\nAccording to her will, her heart was placed in a raised enamel gold reliquary, then transported to Nantes to be deposited, on 19 March 1514, in the vault of the Carmelite friars, in the tomb made for her parents, later being transferred to the Saint-Pierre cathedral. The reliquary of the heart of the Anne, Duchess of Brittany is a box oval, bivalvular, made of a sheet of gold pushed back and guilloched, articulated by a hinge, broadside of a gold cordelière and topped by a crown of lily and clover.\n\nAnne's will also conferred the succession of Brittany upon her second daughter, Renee. This was ignored by her husband, who confirmed Claude as Duchess and married her to Francis.\n\nLoches town hall and the city gate.\n\nCredits: Loches blog by F.
