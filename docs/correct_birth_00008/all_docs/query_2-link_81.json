        "text": "11/25/22\n\nFirst, thank you for the depth and clarity of your writing. It is inspiring. A day or two ago I decided to revisit Down in the Groove as though it was a new Bootleg Series volume with outtakes. The standout cut was “Shenandoah” that includes an unidentified mandolin player. Why do you think even obscure (and much maligned) Dylan albums can become the subject of interesting if not joyful rediscovery?\n\n—Bill Herbert\n\nBob Dylan likely played “Shenandoah” with “Spider” John Koerner in Dinkytown in 1959 or 1960. I’ve never heard a bad version of the song—the melody is just too stirring, even utopian. It speaks for an America where all people feel at home, and it’s a wind of peace of mind blowing through Down in the Groove. It’s just what you say: like a forgotten gem rescued by an archivist.\n\n11/25/22\n\nI expect you’ll be writing about it in detail at some point, but any early remarks on Dylan’s Philosophy of Modern Song? I haven’t yet read it, and probably won’t for a while (I can ill-afford hardcovers, let alone the cost of shipping one to South Korea) but the excerpts have me excited – his depiction of the (possible) author of “Strangers in the Night” “playing his way across the Middle East during the early forties, at one point teaching Iran’s Shah Reza Pahlavi how to correctly swing dance” with its unexpected, perfect placement of the adverb, absolutely kills.\n\nAn unrelated question: was your “flat out unambiguously idiot error” in Mystery Train describing the character who delivered The Godfather‘s devastating line “they’re animals, let them lose their souls” as (if I recall correctly) “carefully off-screen”?\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nI’ll be writing on Philosophy on/in my Fosbury to launch my Substack newsletter and don’t want my thoughts to get stale by posting them in advance.\n\nYes I think off-screen, or not distinguishable in the crowd around the table, but what’s the error there?\n\n11/25/2022\n\nRobert Christgau recently stated that he considers The Funk Brothers to have achieved a feeling in their mutual chemistry that almost no other studio group did, and that the only ones who nearly matched them were The Wrecking Crew at certain points, as well as Al Green’s musicians in the early ‘70s, with The Rolling Stones coming close in their own way in the mid ‘60s. I’d like to know your own take on this particular question.\n\n—Ben Merliss\n\nThe Youngbloods. Booker T and the MGs. A thousand doo-wop groups, but above them all Dion and the Belmonts “I Wonder Why.” After the mid ‘60s, individual virtuosity undermined group identity and a single sound—realizing one’s true self as separate from or over a group replaced the Beatle-ideal of realizing oneself as part of a group. The idea that all individuals are incomplete was replaced by the belief in self-perfection. Thus, guitar solos—as opposed to Phil Manzanera’s accents in Roxy Music’s “More Than This,” which mean more to me, open up a deeper emotional well, than anything Jimi Hendrix ever played.\n\n11/10/22\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the passing of Jerry Lee Lewis? According to his seventh (!!) wife, he was at peace when he went.\n\nI thought, “The last man standing from the Golden Age of Rock and Roll.” But then, I remembered Pat Boone. Although he is reportedly very nice to his fans and still has a weekly show on Sirius, to quote Casey Kasem, “Fucking ponderous!”\n\n– Erik Nelson\n\nI don’t count Pat Boone, even though his first album was the first “rock & roll” album I ever owned—my parents gave it to me for Christmas, my father explaining that he seemed to be “a more solid citizen” than Elvis. Though my mother had already bought me the “Hound Dog” 45.\n\nI will have an item on Jerry Lee in my return Real Life Rock column, though I don’t know when that will be. I think his wife saying he died at peace is hilarious. I wonder if we could say that about the two (at least) dead wives who preceded her?\n\n11/10/22\n\nThe arrival of Jerry Lee Lewis was the cause of great confusion at the Pearly Gates. The thought in everyone’s mind was,”I could have sworn Stagolee was Black.”\n\nThey asked Billy Lyon about it and he said, “I’ve never seen the man before in my life, but he can keep his hat.”\n\n– Robert Fiore\n\nAnd everybody else said, “Just like we thought Elvis was white.”\n\n11/10/22\n\nHi Greil, all my best wishes for a continued recovery. I am now making my way through Barry Jenkins’ The Underground Railroad and I think it’s harrowing and brilliant. If you’ve seen it, I’d love to hear your take. What spurred my question this morning is the recent conversation about “Sail Away.” The second “chapter” of The Underground Railroad is a chilling illustration of that “sales pitch” for slavery in its conception of an idyllic refuge for escaped slaves that isn’t so idyllic (it’s like a Twilight Zone episode). I wonder if the mystical railroad in Jenkins’ film is the real Mystery Train, headed for the promised land or another fool’s paradise.\n\n– Charlie Largent\n\nI stopped watching when the slave (I am not going to use the currently mandated euphemism ‘enslaved person’) was burned alive for the amusement of the white diners, both because the exact scene had already been used in 12 Years a Slave and because, to be honest, it was just too ugly. It wasn’t so called slave porn, which implies a certain attraction. I can’t watch rape scenes either.\n\nWhat you say about the presentation of South Carolina as the escaped slave utopia is acute and deep. Yes, the Undeground Railroad, Whitehead’s or historical, is the real mystery train, and the latter might actually have been in the back of Junior Parker’s or Sam Phillips’s head when they wrote/recorded the song.\n\n11/10/22\n\nHi Greil. I know you don’t typically have much use for questions like these—or, alternatively, have all the time in the world for questions like these! Like, if that’s what you think, just fly with it. They are for you!—But, seriously now: having just seen Tropical Fuck Storm on the final show of their recent US tour, is there any reason to believe they are not currently the best band on the planet?\n\n– Edward Hutchinson\n\nI haven’t been lucky enough to see Tropical Fuck Storm—I do love that name. I’m not sure they’ve played the Bay Area. I did see Gareth Liddiard’s previous band the Drones in Brooklyn sone years back and even though the band was clearly jet-lagged and Liddiard more flu than human they lit fires all over the place and I left feeling like I could fly. I see no reason why on any given night they couldn’t make anyone else seem small, compromised, cowardly, and redundant. But what about the show you saw? Where, how, what?\n\n11/10/22\n\nRe: resemblance of Elvis to a Greek god, I shot this on our family’s first Memphis visit in December 2010.It’s at the Downtown Memphis Welcome Center. Fit for the Uffizi?\n\nThanks for the decades of inspiration, Greil. Just today I watched the ’68 comeback w/my Elvis obsessed daughter and showed her the corresponding part of Mystery Train, which opened up that whole world for me about 40 years or so ago. On our same Memphis visit, she got to spend the night in his bedroom at Lauderdale Courts—worth a dozen Graceland tours. None of it would have happened without your book.\n\n– Vern\n\nThat’s it.\n\nThe Lauderdale Courts story is priceless. Still, it makes me curious what a night there goes for.\n\n11/10/22\n\nIf you were not you, but still most everything you are (but not renowned, as I am thinking could happen to a person with a similar skill set but different circumstances), would you ever write to this site to ask a question? You note that you wish we would talk about our experiences more than asking what you think. However, the heading is Ask Greil, why not Tell Greil? My suspicion is that the built-in respect for your work, and your place, makes conversation difficult (impossible), unless my self-advertisement is confessional enough to start a chat about the oddness of success and failure. I have written you before and been, first and foremost, happy to see my name and the words I carefully (but also with an error that embarrasses) typed. And then I feel a bit vain about this pride.\n\nMy question is: what is your view of this column and (because you mentioned it when you were in the hospital) what does it provide for you? I enjoy it immensely but am not sure why, or possibly I do not want to know why. It is like a presentation of democracy where we are shown that every voice matters and that this is also clearly not true.\n\nThank you for staying alive.\n\n– David\n\nIt says ‘Ask Greil’ which means you ask, I respond, and sometimes people answer back. More and more, when people write in with opinions, or doubt or disagree with mine, or are raving about a show or a song and are putatively asking me what I think, my response has been, say more, tell me more, what happened? If this succeeds ultimately, this—whatever it is—will be a forum, and as has already happened people aren’t asking but, in your word, telling. And when people ‘ask’ in order to get someone who supposedly matters to tell them what to think, render a cosmic judgement, or confirm their choice, that’s when I reply, if I’m not too exasperated not to just do so, go away. But what do you think? Who cares what I think, especially when you already have ideas?\n\n11/10/22\n\nI don’t know if you know the critic Alfred Soto, or look at his site, but in a recent post he had some nice words about Under the Red, White and Blue:\n\n“Greil Marcus’ 2020 rumination on The Great Gatsby and American myth is one of my favorite recent books. Approaching Scott Fitzgerald’s novel as the ur-text for self-creation, Marcus regards West Egg as another region in The Old, Weird America, indulgent of a bootlegger whose ridiculous affectations mesmerize anyone willing to put suspicions aside. The Tom Buchanans are a thuggish presence always, a reminder that some men and women belong and some don’t and they don’t mind reminding you. “It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or those other races will have control of things,” Tom explains to narrator Nick Carraway without a trace of irony, for to have a ironic sense is to recognize when you—inevitably—won’t have control of things.\n\nI regard The Great Gatsby and Citizen Kane as companion pieces. Men from Nowheresville who transforms himself through industry and an implacable will into Somebody, Jimmy Gatz and Charles Foster Kane don’t recognize or recognize faintly their hollowness; this congeries of industry and will is all they got. Think of Ronald Wilson Reagan of Dutch, Illinois. Remember every hustler, amiable and amoral, and those sainted bootstraps. Here’s Marcus on one of Fitzgerald’s prophetic passages:\n\n“No one ever captured the promise of American life more beautiful than Fitzgerald did in that passage. That sense of America is expressed so completely—by billboards, by our movies, by Chuck Berry’s refusal to put the slightest irony into ‘Back in the U.S.A.,’ by the way we try to live our lives—that we hardly know how to talk about the resentment and fear that lie beneath the promise. To be an American is to feel the promise of a birthright, and to feel alone and haunted when the promise fails. No failure in America, whether of love or money, is ever simple; it is always a kind of betrayal, of a mass of shadowy, shared hopes.’\n\nBesides a robust defense of Baz Luhrmann’s 2013 adaptation and best film, Marcus finds correspondences: the blues, W.E.B. Du Bois, a political moment when thousands of Tom Buchanans on Twitter and YouTube find audiences for their racism. Whiteness is not a color—it’s a status, an honorific conferred by the dominant race who have control of things…”\n\n– Chuck\n\nThanks for this. I hadn’t known Soto before. It’s interesting that his long quote, which came off of the Dutch-sailors paragraph in Gatsby, is from Mystery Train, rather than my book on the book, Under the Red White and Blue (2020), which he’s ostensibly writing about. It just speaks for a love and fascination for what Fitzgerald accomplished and where his writing has been and where it’s going.\n\n11/10/22\n\nWhile reading your review of Peter Guarlnick’s Careless Love and your thoughts on the limits of biography vs myth, I thought of a World War I novel you reviewed. A soldier is describing the sudden death of a comrade, what it was like to see the light go out of his eyes, when another trench mate says, “Well he can’t have felt much could he?” “I don’t know what he felt,” the soldier says bitterly, the author making you hear and feel the bitterness, “I only know what I felt.” Can’t tell whether I’m quoting it correctly because I’ve forgotten the name of the book and author of one of the only Undercover-reviewed books uncollected on this site. Do you remember the book (which I read and lost) or the quote? It’s not only moving in it’s own right but was also part of my learning to be a critic.\n\n– Kevin Bicknell\n\nI think that was from a piece on The Great War and Modern Memory but I’m not sure and, I know this is odd, I’m not able to bend down to pull out the drawer where the Rolling Stone issues with my book column are to find out.\n\n11/10/22\n\nHi, Greil, I’m glad that you’re doing better. I’ve visited your Undercover columns over the years and read several books that you reviewed. It would be great to have a collection of your book writings from the 1980s on. Are there any crime novels from the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s that you like as well as The Chill and The Last Good Kiss? Thanks for your time.\n\n– RSE\n\nAll superseded by The Sopranos and the more unhinged episodes of Criminal Intent.\n\n11/10/22\n\nI don’t know if you’d agree with me sir, but when I heard the backing track of the Beatles’ “Rain” at its original speed it acquired a new air of mystery for me. I don’t love the song as I earlier mentioned, but I do like the musicianship which is on fuller display. I find it interesting to think about how it could have ended up differently as a song than it did. If you’re willing to give it a listen, I would be interested to know your own view.\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\nPlease don’t call me sir.\n\n11/10/22\n\nDo you think there is a serious case to be made for Desire being Bob Dylan’s most coherent and accessible album, and therefore possibly his most successful one from a popular music perspective? I’m not talking about success in terms of album sales, or even in terms of impact, but simply in terms of producing an album as a singular coherent artistic statement. It contains some of his most underrated work—“Black Diamond Bay,” “Romance in Durango,” “One More Cup of Coffee,” and the majestic “Sara,” The overlong “Joey” is the only one that I could do without. I understand that it is nowhere near as ground-breaking or influential as the mid-60s trilogy, but the atmosphere and consistent flavour of the album is something that I do not get with any other Dylan record. It is comforting and relaxing, like sitting next to an open fire. I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on an album that, to my mind, is a little overlooked.\n\n– Dean McBride\n\nI thought at first you said “a little overcooked,” which Desire is to me, but I’m not here either to tell people not to like something or to validate their taste.\n\nWhat about “Isis”? It may not be all that it could be on the album, but on the Rolling Thunder tours it was shocking how much it brought out of the singer, who performed it not as something he himself had written but as a visitation. Or for that matter “Hurricane,” which may be terrible songwriting (“And the all-white jury agreed!’) but hits like Carter’s left hand?\n\n11/10/22\n\nHey Greil,\n\nI have a Reissue of the Anthology of American Folk Music, which came with all the original sleeves and stickers from the front cover.\n\nOne of the stickers says “Got Folk,” and has a picture of Harry Smith drinking a glass of milk. This sticker has reviews of the album, one of which is attributed to you: “This is Gansta Folk, post traumatic art far from the shores of Lake Wobegon,” but I cannot find where it was said/published by you.\n\nThe only somewhat viable reference for this quotation that I can find is here.\n\nIn this article the text looks like it’s coming from the author, and not from you, even though you are mentioned just before and just after the quote.\n\nIs this a misquotation, or did you say this somewhere else?\n\n– Rich Soni\n\nI never wrote that, and never saw the sticker you mention. In the article you link to, which I’d never seen either, it’s clearly the writer’s characterization of something I wrote about Dock Boggs.\n\n11/10/22\n\nIf you could recommend a book or article on the early ’60s New York folk scene that the Coen Brothers’ Inside Llewyn Davis tried and failed to inhabit, what would it be?\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\nSuze Rotolo’s A Freewheelin’ Time and Dylan’s sections on the Village in Chronicles. Dave Van Ronk’s book and his articles, especially on Elektra Records, in the folk music magazine Caravan, which you can find online.\n\n10/27/22\n\nOne thing that has always bugged me about Randy Newman’s “Sail Away” is that we all know the real sales pitch for slavery was “Get on this boat or I’ll kill you.” One thing you’d have to say for chattel slavery, if you had to say anything for chattel slavery, is that its victims were never misled about the nature of their catastrophe. What I have recently come to realize though is that the real world equivalent of “Sail Away” was sung more times than you can count, but it was sung in retrospect rather than as a come on. It was sung by a white man nostalgically yearning for a plantation he himself never could have had masquerading in blackface and a clown suit as a reluctantly freed slave yearning for a lost paradise.\n\nI think that if Newman’s pitchman had been selling America to my great grandfather the pitch would have been, “Say, Guido, you look like you’ve got a strong back. How’d you like to live in a rich country?” My maternal great grandfather was German, so the pitch would be more “You’re doing pretty well for yourself here Fritz, but how’d you like to get your hands on the REAL money?” What my family found in America was a golden door, with the words written above it, “Civil Service Exam Given Here.” In the end the true American paradise is not Randy Newman’s “Sail Away” but Uncle Dave Macon’s.\n\nReading the accounts of Bob Dylan’s Greenwich Village parties in Folk Music I had the same feeling I had watching Todd Haynes’ Velvet Underground movie or the books of Eve Babitz, which is that the only way I could have ever gotten into those worlds was with a badge and a warrant. Of course, even those of us who are neither lovely, talented nor interesting can listen to the records and read the books.\n\n– Robert Fiore\n\nI can feel the same about the golden gates barring unschooled and the unhip from the golden gates of Babitz-Lomax-Factory Land. I love the way you put it. You’ll have to tell me what Uncle Dave’s “Sail Away” is—you mean “Sail Away, Ladies” or something more metaphorical?\n\nThere are documented but still likely apocryphal stories told by supposedly Africa-born American slaves that precisely match Newman’s pitchman tale. To me it’s more a parable about and send-up of American exceptionalism—so stirringly dramatized by the gorgeous movie music strings—and a Twain-like celebration of hucksterese before it’s about anything else. But while African slaves captured by Arab and African raiders and traders and then brought to port cities understood what slavery in their own world was, no one could have been prepared for the Middle Passage, the sudden emergence into an entirely new world, the overwhelming sense of displacement that, behind the formal argument, lies DuBois’s ideas about twoness and double consciousness in The Souls of Black Folk.\n\n10/27/22\n\nWho is your favorite bassist in popular music as you have lived it?\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\nCharlie McCoy on Bob Dylan, John Wesley Harding.\n\n10/27/22\n\nI am really enjoying your new book. I was especially pleased with you inclusion of “Ain’t Talking.” I think it is a masterwork. I wonder why it has not received the acclaim of so many other Dylan songs.\n\nThanks\n\n– Rich Whalen\n\nMaybe because in the course of telling a long story filled with vague allusions and abstractions he never raises his voice. Those were the qualities that drew me in from the first time I heard it and their pull has never lessened, but unlike many other Dylan songs (and like some others, such as “Going, Going, Gone”), it doesn’t announce itself, doesn’t begin with a verbal or musical fanfare.\n\n10/27/22\n\nCongratulations on Folk Music. This might be the most trivial question you will ever be asked about it, but I laughed when you wrote of “O Superman,” “this was her ‘Gimmie Shelter,’ her ‘Anarchy in the UK,’ her ‘Sugar, Sugar,’ her ‘Hey Ya’—it’s the end of the world, and it’s catchy.” I’ve never in your work come across a mention of the Archies before. I love “Sugar Sugar,” I grew up with it, and its catchiness is self-evident (I’ve also held to my belief over the years that “O Superman” has more than a little bit of bubblegum in it)—is there anything you can say about its end-of-the-worldness? Are you a fan of “Sugar Sugar”? How did it play to you when it first came on the radio?\n\n– scott woods\n\n“Sugar, Sugar” and the end of the world: because in it’s own fun fun fun way it’s so complete. As with the other songs in that little list, as it plays nothing exists outside of it. That’s less solipsistic than nihilistic. And you could say the same about Hanson’s “MMMBop.”\n\n10/27/22\n\nThere is something about Folk Music that is like the most wonderful book ever published. First of all, it is really pretty. The colors of the cover, the design of the words FOLK MUSIC, the physical feel and read of the book is noteworthy. The chapter “Murder Most Foul,” crescendo; off of the earth, and gets what really happened to JFK, perfectly. This is a book that radiates relevant brilliance; it’s a plow. Thank you Greil. The heavens opened up and the light shined thru your remembering heart, to us.\n\n– Alan Berg\n\nDear Alan,\n\nI’m so glad it reached you.\n\n10/27/22\n\nYou’ve published a good number of books, but there’s one obvious omission: a collection of your early rock criticism—the reviews you published in Rolling Stone, Creem, and The Village Voice. To be sure, a few have appeared in your Dylan collection and your Let it Bleed review was in Ranters and Crowd Pleasers, and a lot of the ones I remember are on your site (your double review of This Year’s Model and Little Criminals, your put-down of Aja, your great Fairport Convention piece, Excitable Boy, Some Girls, Rumours, among others) but, still…this seems like something some publisher would have been interested in at some point. Did you not want to do it?\n\n– Chuck\n\nThere are a number of ways to look at this. Not everything I wrote from late 1968, when I first published anything (a review in Rolling Stone), until late 1969, when, with a piece on Let It Bleed and a David Bailey book of photos looking back at Swinging London I finally found out what writing could be and what I could do about it, not everything was very good. Some of it, then and after, in Creem and the Village Voice, was lousy. And there was a lot of it.\n\nSome years ago a since-retired editor at Harvard proposed a collection of my uncollected elsewhere pieces over the years. I spent a month or two going through stuff and even with radical culling what I came up with was far too long for a book. We talked about two, one to 1989, one after. But what I wanted was a picture both more specific and broad. I wanted a book collecting the six years of book columns I wrote for Rolling Stone from 1975 to 1980, good bad and indifferent, I wanted a book collecting all of my music columns from Interview, from 1992 to 2008 (with a lot of breaks). I wanted books in long conversations with a subject. And more.\n\nNothing has come of any of these notions. I don’t know if any is a good idea, if anyone would want to publish such books, or read them. I have at least one more book I’ve committed to write. I’m not sure I want to devote a year or more, working with an editor on a day to day basis, to looking back.\n\n10/27/22\n\nLast month [9/9] I asked a question about a photo of a blackface performance where the audience also appeared to be in blackface. Yesterday I went back and took a photo to send to you. My best guess is that it was some type of pageant? Either way, here’s the photo.*\n\n– Nick\n\nI asked the great folklorist Dick Spottswood what he thought.“The photo looks like cast members posing on stage for a publicity shot,” he said. Eric Lott, author of Love and Theft, the best modern book on blackface performance, sees it similarly:\n\n“Not convinced it’s an audience. Looks as much like a stage backdrop as it does back of the house. Who can tell? Lots of film/stage occasions with raucous multitudes all in blackface. Still, it’s odd. Let’s all be black for a while? Some kind of Darius James phantasmagoria (which it always is anyway)? Vibe and beard on central clown call to mind Bing Crosby in blackface celebrating Abe Lincoln in Holiday Inn, an instance of New Deal blackface per Mike Rogin. I wish he were still here to talk with us about it.”\n\n*Photo not for publication -ed.\n\n10/27/22\n\nRobert Christgau on his own question blog recently stated that with s couple of exceptions the early music of the Byrds has not aged too well overall. Knowing that you included both Mr. Tambourine Man and Turn! Turn! Turn! in your desert island list from Stranded, I’d like to know your own present day view on the Byrds of the ’65 to 67 ‘period.\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\nGlorious.\n\n10/22/22\n\nI’ve just finished reading your rich, discerning, delightful Folk Music. Terrific on every page, with your usual stunning details (as example, the long footnote on the fate of James Kennard, Jr, p. 148); and by the way, thank you for the quotes from D. H. Lawrence and Machiavelli. Your pages on “Only A Pawn in Their Game” ended with a sentence, though, that did confuse me: “the last verse returned to Medgar Evers, for his funeral, with the same last line carried by every verse now on his tombstone: ONLY A PAWN IN THEIR GAME.” I asked myself: does he mean on Evers’s tombstone? In the last verse Dylan sings: “But when the shadowy sun sets on the one/That fired the gun/He’ll see by his grave/On the stone that remains/His epitaph plain…”. I have always heard it as the epitaph being written on the gravestone of “the one that fired the gun.” Is there ambiguity here? With best wishes for health, & deep respect.\n\n– Chip Hughes\n\nYou’re right. That’s the theory of the song: every one is a pawn of the rich and powerful, and the assassin is presumed to be, as the song classifies it, a “poor white.” But I always heard it as I wrote it: those words on Medgar Evers’s tombstone. That’s apparently not what Dylan meant to say, but to me, analyzing my own response, that’s where the momentum of the recording truly carries the song—past Dylan’s sociology and into tragic irony.\n\nThank you for your kind and heartening words on the book.\n\n10/22/22\n\nI’ve finished with Folk Music … another GM keeper, that’s for sure! I do have a question, though: did I overlook an explanation for how the images/illustrations (on front cover of dust jacket/inside with each chapter) connect to the appropriate song? Didn’t see anything in the notes or index either. They are all puzzlers, especially the pipeline with “Desolation Row”… thanks.\n\n– Joe Specht\n\nWith the exception of people running up the Grassy Knoll for “Murder Most Foul,” I was in the dark too. Max Clarke, the artist, keyed the images to the chapters, but I think without any real finality. I puzzled and puzzled, finally sort of tying the black elevator repairman and the woman with her little boy dressed up like a cowboy for “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll” (something about a black man on his knees and a white person with a gun?) but it was a real swirling mystery. I couldn’t be happier with it all.\n\n[See Max Clarke’s Instagram page.]\n\n10/22/22\n\nHi Greil, I hope your recovery is going well. I enjoyed your interaction with Valerie Harms about Elvis. It’s obvious why young girls of the time were so excited by him: he radiated sex and rhythm and an exotic, dangerous, rebellious energy that was unstoppable… Besides which, he was a pretty good singer, and Scotty, Bill, and DJ were not too shabby either. Valerie says that he was so handsome and represented a new masculinity, which is true, but there was also a new androgynous quality and a beauty more than handsomeness that he exuded (In Love Me Tender, I think Richard Egan is handsome, Elvis is young and beautiful), and it’s this homoerotic component to his appeal that makes things complicated and problematic for his male fans. Growing up in the early ’70s, I bought every one of Elvis’ RCA albums (my first exposure to EP was my mom’s Camden Flaming Star LP—she must’ve thought he was Greek because his name ended in S), but I just could not bring myself to buy A Date with Elvis—just cut too close. It’s tough being a straight male—in those less enlightened times—obsessed with a performer whose fans are mostly screaming young girls. That may be one of the reasons you and your male classmates were jealous of the girls in your school who were free to go and see Elvis and unabashedly express their excitement (desire) for him. You wrote quite insightfully about this in Mystery Train in one of the footnotes where you relate a dream in which Elvis and his band were in a peepshow reel, and also, I think it’s in Mystery Train, where you compare Elvis to George Reeves as Superman as far as their respective costumes presenting an illusion of power/strength covering a sordid weakness. Your anecdotes about your classmates were sad and fascinating—now I know why “Second Hand News” sounds like Buddy Holly avoided his fate and snuck into a recording studio in 1977. Have you ever watched the TV show Monk? It’s set in the Bay Area and Randy Newman does the theme song. It’s a lot of fun. Stay well.\n\n– Peter Danakas\n\nPeople used to joke with Elvis that he looked like a Greek god. Elvis, not unfamiliar with statues of Apollo, agreed. Maybe that’s why your mother might have thought he was Greek, if she did. Growing up, I always thought the sexiest thing Elvis ever did was “Don’t.” These were not gender issues that I understood. It was a fantasy that just by listening to the song at a party girls would react to an ordinary boy who was silently singing along just as they would to Elvis. Years later a woman told me I was wrong: the real open sesame song was “I was the One.” As it was the B-side of “Heartbreak Hotel,” which I wasn’t crazy about and didn’t own—and singles were not included on albums—when she said that, I didn’t even know the song. I listened. I don’t know if she was right or not, but what a song.\n\n10/22/22\n\nRIP to Art Laboe, one of the great voices of radio and one of the indefatigable heroes of rock & roll. I never was privileged to hear him on the air, but he’s a legend to all of us who love the music, as well as the legacy of vintage-era radio.\n\n– David W. (Chicago)\n\nArt Laboe. A legend. I was shocked to find him taking prisoners’ requests in Rachel Kushner’s novel The Mars Room in 2018—could this be real? Was he really still alive? A working DJ in his 90s when everyone else of his generation was gone?\n\nI never heard him either, being in Menlo Park when I first heard rock ‘n’ roll on the radio, but friends and I swooned in around 1959 or 1960 when the local station ran an oldies weekend and we listened obsessively to the lost, forgotten, all but entombed music from a few years before. When I bought the first Oldies But Goodies album, so much of it assembled out of LA R&B and doo-wop little heard outside of California, I was almost mystically transported when I saw that one of the tracks went back not to 1955 (the first Chuck Berry record), or even 1954 (the first Elvis record), but eons before, in 1952–as if it had been recorded in a secret studio in the Great Pyramid, that hot new sound of the Land of the Pharaohs. It was so displacing. But thanks to what Laboe could get his hands on cheaply he rewrote the history of Los Angeles, 45 by 45.\n\n10/22/22\n\nWondered if you’d read this. Any thoughts on the project? Outstanding nominees for long-term deep-freeze preservation?\n\n– Andrew Hamlin\n\nJohnny Cash’s recording of Robert Service’s “The Cremation of Sam Mcgee.”\n\n10/22/22\n\nDid you ever read Dave Van Ronk’s autobiography and if so, what is your view on it?\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\nHe was a great storyteller, sometimes on himself, as with his description of hearing “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” for the first time: “I could not even talk about it.” Elijah Wald did a very good job.\n\n10/22/22\n\nHello Greil, I am enjoying your new book. Great stuff. Hope there are many more for you to write. Recently, I came across a YouTube clip of the post-Jim Morrison Doors performing and it was painful to listen to Ray Manzarek try to sing “Love Me Two Times.” No one could sing ’em like Jim. The Doors did record a couple of albums after Jim died and I know they were not well received. Could today’s AI voice cloning bring Morrison’s voice back and re-record vocals on those songs? I don’t know if the songs were any good and Jim’s not here to re-write them either. But one miracle at a time. Next century will see the Beatles return via AI?\n\n– Jim Stacho\n\nI hope not. Much prefer to raise Ray M. from the dead and let him try again.\n\n10/12/22\n\nMr. Marcus, I am hoping you could provide some insight into the Masked Marauders album cover. In the October 1969 “review” published in Rolling Stone, the album cover is a cropped photograph of Sharon Tate and Ferdy Mayne taken by Roman Polanski on the set of The Fearless Vampire Killers; and was published in the March 1967 edition of Playboy. Do you recall how and why that particular image was used? I’m also curious if there was any feedback to that being used since her death had occurred only two months earlier? Or, did the fact that the photo was of Sharon completely go over everyone’s heads? The album itself has models recreating the photo and my assumption has been that permission to use the photo could not be obtained. If you have any information about the actual reason the photo wasn’t used for the album, I would like to know that as well.\n\nI apologize if I’ve just bombarded you with questions about a subject you haven’t thought about in years.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n– Kristen\n\nAfter I wrote the Masked Marauders piece, I got together with Robert Kingsbury, the Rolling Stone art director, to work out a jacket design. I was still the Records editor at the paper, and I wanted to hold the fake review for a very large records section I was planning for October. I brought in the Sharon Tate image, from a Playboy spread on Roman Polanski’s The Fearless Vampire Killers—the threatening hand (Polanski’s) held over her as she’s taking a bath just seemed horribly prescient. In horrible taste, but irresistible, and in 1969 Rolling Stone was not selling good taste. At the time, we almost always used an album jacket to visually cue a review, so this went in. It ran as one of as many as twenty regular reviews, along with several full page featured reviews, just dropped into the section.\n\nI was not involved with the actual Warner Bros. album. That cover was bland compared to the Rolling Stone design, but half-decent taste won out, plus there would have been no possibility of permission to use the still, given the circumstances.\n\nI’m amazed at the misinformation online about this little parody that could. Nothing is correct, especially Wikipedia. And I think about it often enough: on a shelf just to the side of the bed in our house is a little array of photos, including one from a 2013 episode of Rock Center with Brian Williams about how he’d been fooled into buying the album (the picture shows him holding a copy, Masked Marauders pianist and composer Langdon Winner seated at a piano, and me) and believed every word of the original review, thus warping his entire personality to the point that he perpetrated a hoax of his own and ruined his career.\n\n10/12/22\n\nLoving the new Dylan book, but I don’t quite understand what you mean when you write of “See That My Grave Is Kept Clean” that Dylan “drops all of Jefferson’s most colorful verses—there are no coffins, no church bells. I don’t need that, the song says now.” But Dylan does sing those verses in the version on the first album, no?\n\n– James Penha\n\nThat’s a huge error and I can’t remotely explain it. It doesn’t make sense on the page, never mind the album. Thank you for pointing it out, and it’ll be corrected down the line, but I’ll spend the day with stones in my shoes for penance.\n\n10/12/22\n\nWill there be any live events in NYC for the new text on ‘Bob in Seven Songs’?\n\n– Lee Kaufman\n\nUnhappily no. At least not this year.\n\n10/12/22\n\nWhen I asked you sometime back who your favorite crime writers were after Ross Macdonald I actually meant it literally as in who you liked who came after him. But I guess that would constitute asking for a list so I’ll let that pass. Even so…\n\nWhat’s your opinion on the work of Elmore Leonard? I remember one critic (David Yaffe I think) claiming Bob Dylan’s Chronicles Vol. 1 was closer in the spirit of its prose to Leonard’s work than more obvious literary comparisons.\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\nWell-plotted but interchangeable and forgettable, in the sense that with, whatever title, you can go many pages in before realizing you’d already read it. They make better movies than books.\n\n10/12/22\n\nHoward Hesseman died earlier this year. A two-parter then: 1. Did you ever see The Committee live during their SF heyday with Hesseman, Peter Bonerz, Roger Bowen, Carl Gottlieb et al? If so, any reflections or reminiscences? 2. Johnny Fever resonated as a recognizable if fading ’70s stereotype. And WKRP did predict and lament the disappearance of sui generis radio personalities in favour of corporate programming. Sure, it’s great that youtube can help us can relocate Wire performing “The 15th” on German TV in 1979. But when one encounters Stanley Elkin’s The Dick Gibson Show, Donald Fagen’s chapter on Jean Shepherd in his Eminent Hipsters memoir, or Peter Wolf midnight footage in the recent WBCN documentary, it can’t help but register that “you had to be there” at a certain time and place to appreciate the legendary local deejays of yesteryear fully (in the decades prior to satellite radio). It’s far harder to unearth archival evidence of same, save via anecdote and rumour. We all have our regionally lost-forever favourite deejays; could you possibly discuss a few of yours? Thanks.\n\n– Craig Proctor\n\nI started going to The Committee in the fall of 1963, when I was 18, the year it opened; I’d stopped going by the time Howard Hessman was part of it. The original cast included the goofy and charismatic Larry Hankin, the moonlighting folk singer Hamilton Camp, the sometime Beat poet Gary Goodrow, and my favorite, the scowling and cynical Scott Beach.\n\nYou had to be 21 to get in, but they were pretty lax. I had a very effective fake ID—my drivers license got smeared when I was thrown into a pool and it was easy to change my birth year from 1945 to 1942. They checked me and then ignored whoever I was with. It was wonderfully inventive and full of what seemed like unscripted comebacks and wisecracks. It was cross cultural, filling the gap between the heroic Beat years and the emergence of the Acid Test and Fillmore bands a couple of years later.\n\n10/12/22\n\nI concur with your response to Ben Merliss regarding Get Back. Do you have any thoughts on Peter Jackson’s hinting at another Beatles project?\n\n– Theresa Kereakes\n\nNo.\n\n10/12/22\n\nI wrote two reviews “for” Rolling Stone, and got nice replies, one hand-written, but they were unsolicited and a bit late, and did not meet the fate of your first offering to that organ. One was of Ram (I loved it); the other was of Slow Train Coming—I loved a lot of it but mostly loved what voice he had on it. I thought for a while I could write about music, but then I read Mystery Train and realized I should leave that for the real ones. (I did have two reviews published in Creem, though.)\n\nAnyway, Dylan ruined my life. Because of him, I started writing songs, and I thought I could make it as a singer-songwriter, since my songs had some worth. So I abandoned a “promising” career in academic philosophy and moved from Toronto to… L.A. and other towns. But through no fault of his, I could NOT make it in music. Of course I kept writing songs, I couldn’t help it. And ended up adjunct-teaching in philosophy… I think failure is a subject that is under-explored.\n\n– John Kearns\n\nI was not long ago asked to give a lecture on failure. I’d never given it much thought. But it was fun. I started with all the terrible albums Neil Young made in the eighties and his agreeing, but saying he did it on purpose, to drive his listeners away, create a new audience, and for himself a new reason to make music. “Failure guarantees success,” he said. Of course, he had a lot to fall back on. But as an adjunct—are your classes satisfying? Do you learn new things, including what you don’t know and don’t understand, from your students or from the act of teaching itself?\n\n10/12/22\n\nIn your desert island list for Stranded, you recommended the American version of the Beatles’ Revolver claiming that the “golden rain” of “And Your Bird Can Sing” was one of the songs that saved the album from its pretensions. However “And Your Bird Can Sing” was actually one of three Lennon songs excluded from the American release. I do understand it was decades ago when you wrote what you wrote (and I wasn’t even born at the time), but I would like to ask if it was possible you were thinking of “She Said She Said” or “Tomorrow Never Knows” instead, if you do in fact still prefer the original American release.\n\nAlso, I know you don’t care for “Dr. Robert” or “Rain” (which I have mixed feelings about myself since I wish Lennon had sang “When the rain comes,” instead of “If the rain comes”) but regarding “And Your Bird Can Sing,” do you think it would have improved the American Revolver if it had been retained instead of being released on Yesterday And Today?\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\nI don’t know.\n\n10/12/22\n\nWere you aware of Randy Newman as a songwriter at all before he started making albums himself? Based on the two Ace Records anthologies (On Vine Street and Bless You California) his specialty was not so much writing singles for others as writing album tracks for them.\n\n– Robert Fiore\n\nI’m not familiar with those albums—will have to track them down. He did write a lot of B-sides.\n\n10/12/22\n\nI read somewhere (wish I could cite the source, but it’s been a while) that during the sessions for There’s A Riot Goin’ On, Sly Stone was getting so drugged out that the sessions were in danger of collapse, so his friend Bobby Womack stepped in and helped get it over the finish line. Womack has long been an underrated favorite of mine, a terrific soul singer-songwriter (his usual persona: a sexist pig who gets his comeuppance and learns his lesson…until next time…), a splendid gospel/r&b guitarist and a man who seemed to show up in plenty of unexpected places and leave his mark, which lends credence to the Sly story. Riot contains a number of musical departures (apart from the obvious thematic ones) from previous Family Stone records, so I’m inclined to credit some of that to Womack. Do you know anything about this, and can you shed any light on what his specific contributions were?\n\n– Jim Cavender\n\nJoel Selvin’s Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History* is the best source for this. Bobby Womack certainly crafted Riot with Sly more than any other principal. But they were both a mess at the time, and later both attempted to get out from under legal pressure by embarking on a tour, which soon collapsed, as a form of “performing therapy.” But when you listen to the album, you hear many voices, all woven together. You hear the presence and the statement of a group as well as of its creator. Whether that’s studio trickery, and it’s really just Sly and Bobby with the doors locked, I don’t know.\n\n*Newly reissued\n\n10/12/22\n\nI have read War and Peace. It was so long ago that I remember almost nothing of the book itself. Napoleon, the dumb genius of the Russian peasantry. Stuff like that. And the lead character was named Pierre, which to me was the name of a Quebec defenseman, not a Russian aristocrat.\n\nBut what I do remember vividly was the experience of reading it. In the beginning, it’s just depressing and discouraging. It’s like you’ve been at it for days, and you’ve barely made a dent into this enormous pile of book. And then—you get sucked in. And you can’t leave it alone. It turns out to be a compulsive page-turner. You have to speed through the occasional digressions, as Tolstoi expounds his peculiar historical theories—but you do that so you can be with these people again, and find out what happens to them.\n\n– Daniel F McIlroy\n\nThat’s what it’s all about, isn’t it? Richard Powers’s The Time of Our Singing had the same effect on me—I did not want to let go of the characters, which meant that when any of them died—and in the course of the book, three out of the five principals do—it was unbearable, an unacceptable loss, especially of the father, who unlike his wife and son doesn’t die violently—I just broke down. Though unlike with your War and Peace the book had me from the first pages. What you’re talking about reminds me of as unalterably painful an artistic moment as I know: the end of the movie version of Dr. Zhivagao, when Julie Christie disappears into the Stalinist crowd as Omar Sharif so desperately tries of get off the bus from which he’s glimpsed her, and never gets close. You can feel that way when you finish a great book: that no matter how many times you reread it, you will never feel that sense of loss as keenly as you do in that instance. Except that’s the magic of literature: it isn’t true. You can feel it, and just as strongly. The end of Philip Roth’s I Married a Communist, that last paragraph, the real last paragraph—if only he’d cut that pointless last sentence, which undercuts what he’s already done, and betrays a kind of uncertainty about what he’s already done, a writer just slightly afraid of his own words. Roth once told me I understood that book better than anyone except he himself, but in this case I think I understand it better. Not that he’s around to argue the point.\n\n9/29/22\n\nSad to learn that Joe Bussard has passed away. His enthusiasm and knowledge of those great 78s was truly something to behold… Always got a buzz watching Desperate Man Blues, even the bonus footage had me on the floor esp when he demos how to clean a 78 with a horse brush.\n\nIf Huck Finn hadda collected records this is kinda how he woulda been.\n\nSafe journey and thanks for all you gave.\n\n– Rockman\n\nWe talked on the phone a few times. His enthusiasm burnt up the line. And without him the world would no longer know “France Blues.”\n\n9/29/22\n\nI flat-out stole your name.\n\nThe all-powerful, all-knowing specter of a villain in my first and only spec script I ever wrote which, naturally, was never produced—while, shockingly, got me signed with an agency—was named Greil Marcus. I was young and came across your name somewhere? Vanity Fair, maybe? Can’t recall. But I’ve always loved it and, forgive me, used it in a piece of fiction.\n\nIt’s a badass name, man.\n\nxoxo,\n\n– Ste7en\n\nYours is not the only villain my name has played. Matthew Robbins’s 1981 Dragonslayer features the leader of a vile cult—Christianity—that means to replace pagan magic with its own—and with the end of pagan magic comes the end of dragons. This is Albert Salmi as me—Matthew and I saw each other all the time then.\n\n9/29/22\n\nYou say that you didn’t understand girls’ reactions to Elvis. When he first sang in my high school auditorium in Texas, the boys all hated him. He was a different type of masculinity. For us girls he was magnificent. So handsome and sexy. The best. I got to meet him several times and I wrote a book (of course) called Tryin’ To Get to You, my favorite song.\n\n– Valerie Harms\n\nWhen Elvis came to Oakland in 1956 and one of our 6th grade female classmates down the Peninsula in Menlo Park actually went the boys made fun of her because secretly we were insanely jealous that she had the nerve to do it and we didn’t. Not long after both of her parents were killed in a car crash and her devotion to Elvis spiraled out of control, ultimately consuming her life and making expected relationships impossible, at least into her forties. So it was a double-edged sword. She won, but paid a terrible price.\n\nMy mother had already bought me the “Hound Dog”/”Dont Be Cruel” 45 but the next year “All Shock Up” became the first record I ever bought. Still have it, of course. Little did I know that when I went to Menlo Atherton High in 1959, Jeff Buckingham, who with other brothers ruled the school, was compiling a rockabilly collection that would eventually serve as a Bible for his little brother Lindsey.\n\n9/28/22\n\nCongratulations on Folk Music. I bought an early copy at the Politics and Prose bookstore.\n\nWould you consider Double Life of Bob Dylan, as well as Clinton Heylin’s other books on Dylan recommended reading?\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\nGreat store.\n\nNo.\n\n9/29/22\n\nIt passed me by when it was released, but I recently discovered Bob Dylan’s version of “He’s Funny That Way” from the 2018 album Universal Love: Wedding Songs Reimagined (which, according to Wikipedia, “features wedding songs with gender-specific terms adjusted to refer to the same gender as the singer”—figure that one out). Conceptually, the album’s a bit of a cheat—I suppose someone, somewhere, danced to Big Brother and the Holding Company’s “I Need a Man to Love” at their wedding, but I’d hardly call it a “wedding song” and anyway, most classic wedding songs (“Can’t Help Falling In Love,” “We’ve Only Just Begun,” “Just the Way You Are” etc.) tend to be gender-neutral to begin with—but its heart is in the right place. Like Detective Fin Tutuola once said: “Gay marriage—it’s about time.”\n\n“He’s Funny That Way” is an interesting choice—written as “She’s Funny That Way” to be sung by a man, Billie Holiday changed the pronouns and popularized it. There’s a line in the song that’s key—in the original lyrics: “I can see no other way/And no better plan/Than to end it all and let her go/To some other man.” Holiday changed the lyric to “let him go/to some other gal” which sounds awkward. Dylan sings it as “let HIM go/to some other MAN,” rescuing the rhyme and removing any doubt about the perspective: this can’t be heard as a man singing as a woman (“Dink’s Song,” “House of the Rising Sun”); the narrator is, simply and unambiguously, a gay man.\n\nWhich is just a long-winded way of saying it’s a relief that Dylan seems to have put all that anti-gay Old Testament shit he was spouting in the ’80s behind him—maybe due to his love for his daughter, who’d have her own same-sex wedding. Plus, Dylan’s “He’s Funny” is good! He sings it with just the right mix of pride and disbelief at his good luck (still can’t touch Billie, of course).\n\nI always thought my own pick for a wedding song would be either “Let It Be Me” or “Out of Left Field,” but that ship has sailed. If I may pry, what did you and your wife choose?\n\n-steve o’neill\n\nYou may not pry.\n\n9/29/22\n\n1. Now that you’ve seen Get Back, what is your full and and unvarnished opinion of it?\n\n2. What do you think are the best/most important film(s) or documentary(ies) on the Beatles? (I personally don’t believe you’d have to frame it as a list in order to give an answer. One example or two in your own fashion would I think be consistent with your rules here.)\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\n1. A wasted opportunity.\n\n2. A Hard Day’s Night.\n\n9/29/22\n\nAs I continue to study and appreciate music, especially albums, I have found that the songs that I initially dismiss eventually become the songs that have the most long lasting impact on my appreciation for that album, work, or artist.\n\nAs I write this out, I am realizing this idea is reminiscent of “The stone that the builder refused shall be the cornerstone”… (Psalm 118:22, e.g. Bob Marley).\n\nTonight I experienced this when all of a sudden “This Song of Love” by Middle Georgia Singing Convention No. 1 revealed itself in all its glory, just as Smith probably intended.\n\n“If you were with Harry you could discover something new every moment, and it was in complete disguise.” ~ Harvey Bialy\n\nHave you experienced examples of this phenomena? Do you have any thoughts on why this happens?\n\nP.S. Hope your recovery, and integration back into home life is going well\n\n– Rich Soni\n\nI’m not sure what you’re asking. Of course on countless occasions I’ve heard a recording in different times or circumstances than before and it’s been utterly changed. I can think of many examples, some of which I’ve already written about on this site. But in terms of discovering something new—I think of Alexander Trocchi speaking of Guy Debord and London—Debord was no Londoner, apart from his love for Thomas de Quincy’s Confessions of and English Opium Eater—of how he could take you down some nothing side street and reveal its history, its architectural uniqueness: “He could discover a city.” And in the same vein, Ed Ward, the late Fresh Air music historian and the second Rolling Stone Records Editor, one day walking my wife and myself through Berlin, which we’d visited many times—I was there when the wall was built—and opening up the place as if we’d never seen it at all.\n\n9/28/22\n\nHave you ever seen Lana Del Rey in concert? If so did she live up to or surpass your expectations based on how much you love her records?\n\n– MeW\n\nNo.\n\n9/29/22\n\nA while back you mentioned you never saw the Kubrick film A Clockwork Orange. It actually got me thinking about all the literature I’ve never read. The Postman Always Rings Twice, Lost Horizon, The Invisible Man, Gone With the Wind, Oliver Twist, and so many others I know from the (mostly) Hollywood films of the 1930s & ’40s. Have you read all of these novels? What about the Bhagavad Gita? Voltaire? Zora Neale Hurston? Kant? Nietzsche? Wittgenstein? I’m jumping around but you get my drift. Are there any significant holes in what you’ve read?\n\n– Steve Canson\n\nThe most significant hole in anything I’ve read came with War and Peace. I had my father’s old Modern Library edition. When I got to the end the last two pages were missing. And by that time I was so numbed I didn’t look elsewhere to find out what I was missing.\n\nAs far as 1,000 page novels go I’ll take The Count of Monte Cristo anytime. Though I have a friend who’s currently walking around with a t-shirt with the cover of one of Karl Ove Knausgård’s My Struggle books—that six-volume 3,600 page novel—and the headline “FINISHED!” on top. I read the second and then the first in the hospital and am now a bit into number three, though after watching Pistol I took a break to reread Steve Jones’s Lonely Boy, which I liked just as much.\n\n9/29/22\n\nRE: Blowin’ In the Wind\n\nI think I prefer John Fogerty’s “Wrote a Song for Everyone” (not necessarily a better song):\n\n“Saw the people standing,\n\nThousand years in chains\n\nSomebody said it’s different now,\n\nLook it’s just the same.”\n\nHope you are well.\n\n– Bo Brynerson\n\nCan’t argue with that. And it’s such a realistic song. What it’s really about is that the answers aren’t blowing in the wind: there are no answers, and even if there were, you can’t get them across: “Wrote a song for everyone/And I couldn’t even get to you.” You make me wonder if, somewhere in its genesis, it’s an answer record to “Blowin’ in the Wind.”\n\n9/29/22\n\nLike many others have stated, I’m glad to hear you’re doing better. As a thank you for all that you’ve done, here’s my favorite cover of one of your favorite pop songs (don’t let the opening riff fool you, although fair warning: I can’t hear the song now without it). (Oh, and if you like this, they also do a killer cover of “Nothing Compares 2 U” on the same album.)\n\n– James L.\n\nThanks for this. Not a bad idea, but I prefer “Pretty Vacant” as done by the Pistol Sex Pistols. I’m sorry the Sex Pistols themselves didn’t do it. But that show is truly gripping, and when the band plays, especially as the story goes on, it’s inspiring. People in the crowd are as transformed as, sometimes, the Johnny Rotten character is. It’s completely convincing that this is something new under the sun, that people realize that, that it sets them free.\n\n9/18/22\n\nDo you think Philip Roth deserved a Nobel Prize in literature before Dylan.\n\n– Jacob Zeder\n\nYes. If only for his whole body of work, for doing his most ambitious and deeply, paradoxically patriotic, work near the end of his life and career with American Pastoral, I Married a Communist, The Human Stain, and The Plot Against America. Put that with Portnoy’s Complaint, Sabbath’s Theater, and The Great American Novel, and you have more than enough to say that if Roth had never been born the country and the world would be impoverished.\n\nLike Bob Dylan, Roth had a long fallow period through and out of the eighties, with pointless mirror novels about, in essence, whether he existed at all. It goes back to The Counterlife—all this teasingly autobiographical board/game puzzle fiction. But he came out of it like an avenger.\n\nWhy not? I was told by someone in a position to know that for years before Dylan was named in 2016 he was the only American who had been seriously considered since Toni Morrison: Roth and Joyce Carol Oates never really came up. I find this a little hard to believe, since Louise Gluck was named just four years later. Maybe Roth was passed over because it was known he would most likely be unable to travel to be present to accept the award (a year or so later he had to turn down the $1 million Jerusalem Prize, which had to be accepted in person—“Oh,” he said when he was informed that he had been elected unanimously, “there goes another million”). Little did the Swedish Academy suspect that Dylan would prevaricate about acknowledging his selection at all and send the American ambassador to Sweden to read his initial—and eloquently hilarious—acceptance statement, Patti Smith for the formal award ceremony, and a cocktail jazz-themed taped Nobel Lecture on his favorite Great Novels based on Cliff Notes: another way of accepting the prize while also turning his back on it. But the prize made the Academy look good, broke the mold more effectively than the award for Dario Fo, and, if it really did nothing for Dylan, thrilled countless first-rank novelists who might themselves have been considered, from Salman Rushdie, who ought to win this year if not next year, and Kazuo Ishiguro, who won in 2017, and, though I never read anything to say so, likely Peter Handke, who won in 2019, and who probably bought his last Bob Dylan album in 2020, when Rough and Rowdy Ways came out.\n\nI felt bad for Philip Roth when the 2016 announcement was made. I know personally how much he wanted it. I felt bad for the world. But I also felt good for Bob Dylan and the world. That he didn’t miss a step afterward, but in his own way topped himself (which does not mean here what it means in Britain), is a kind of proof that it was a, if not the, right choice.\n\n9/18/22\n\nI’m certain you’re aware by now of the recent return of Creem. Although you wrote for them several years ago, were you in any way involved in its return? And should we expect to see articles from you with them anytime in the future?\n\n– Richard Crane\n\nIf you count around 47 years as several, you lead a very fast life. I have nothing to do with the new Creem and have no plans to write for them. The Creem documentary isn’t bad, though.\n\n9/18/22\n\nThe recent tragic killing of [Teenage Head guitarist] Gord Lewis brought the Frankie Venom statue debates in Hamilton back to mind: Zappa in Vilnius. John Lennon in Havana. Chuck Berry in St. Louis. Freddie Mercury in Montreux. Bon Scott in Fremantle. Rory Gallagher in Ballyshannon. Phil Lynott and (two of) Luke Kelly in Dublin. Ron Hynes in St. John’s. Glenn Frey in Winslow, Az. Etc. Wondering what you make of “rock statuary”. Merely kitsch or something more? Appreciably different than the statues of Glenn Gould in Toronto, Lou Costello in Paterson or Willie Stargell outside PNC Park? Bearing in mind that a parcel of purists would automatically deem there to be nothing less R’N’R; or “punk” than having one’s feet cast in cement.\n\nJamie Reid getting the museum treatment was inevitable, though I guess no one was imagining that with any certainty in 1977.\n\nTake care, thanks.\n\n– Craig Proctor\n\nThe very idea of a statue of Glenn Frey has me reeling. His name on a nightclub, sure. An alley or cross street, ok. Even a library. But unless he’s on horseback in full 19th century military dress, to compound the absurdity, it’s an image my brain simply will not accept. And we can take that down the line. Except for sports heroes at their stadiums or home town neighborhoods, where they’d probably be vandalized or carted off to someone’s man cave.\n\nIn “Take it Easy,” Frey and the rest of the Eagles were playing fictional characters in a drama that began on the side of of a road in Winslow, Arizona. Should there be a statue of Atticus Finch in Maycomb, Alabama, if it existed, instead of a statue of Harper Lee in New York, where she wrote To Kill a Mockingbird? Say, in Christopher Park in Greenwich Village, Lee sitting on a bench with Truman Capote? The possibilities are endless.\n\nI could definitely go for Jamie Reid on a side street near Buckingham Palace. He’s 75; let him go up while he can see it.\n\n9/18/22\n\nI love your love for “Up Around the Bend.” John Fogerty packs more joy into one “OOOH” than most artists manage in a lifetime.\n\nMy favorite has always been “Lodi,” in no small part because my dad used to sing it to me with the words changed to “Oh Lord, stuck in Novi again”—Novi being the Detroit suburb next to the one where I grew up, and it fits the song in more ways than one.\n\nI always assumed contemporary critical consensus toward CCR was almost universally positive. I was born well after they broke up so I can only go by what I’ve read, but even Rolling Stone, whose supposed indifference toward CCR was the basis for the question you fielded about the group last month, appears to have published glowing reviews for Green River/Willy and the Poor Boys/Cosmo’s Factory when they were released. What’s your recollection of how most critics viewed them during their prime?\n\n– Ben S.\n\nI didn’t know anyone who didn’t think they were wonderful. Their string of hit singles was so rich every one was a surprise with its radical shifts in rhythm and subject: war, a turn in the road, a dead end town, and the ultimate mystery: cross-tie walkers.\n\n9/18/22\n\nWhat do you make of Joe Biden referring to MAGA folks as “semi-fascists.” Does the “semi” throw you off the way it does me? Is it a wise move politically?\n\n– Jeremiah\n\nI’d prefer “new” or “present-day”—“neo” always sounds wishy washy to me. But what he said did what he presumably wanted. It drew a line. It shocked Republicans to hear their own reality thrown back in their faces. The horror, the horror!\n\n9/18/22\n\nI have read your writing over the course of many years, and thank you so much for all your thought provoking and nuanced criticism. And just to note I also went through open heart surgery a decade ago, and it took much time and energy to recover, but it also became a significant period for rest and reflection.\n\nI was wondering if you were familiar with a podcast called Bandsplain hosted by Yasi Salek?\n\nEach episode is a roughly two-hour critical overview of a musician/band’s recording career. Listening to an episode on Randy Newman (with guest critic Molly Lambert) sent me back to his early “classic” LPs, and to Mystery Train. It was interesting to hear a discussion by two women writers in 2021/2 on Newman’s work, and they did raise points about how his fandom (for his core output) skews male and white, and likely of a certain age. But then again, his widest audience (knowingly or not) would be for his animation soundtracks.\n\nI am wondering if you had any thoughts about Newman’s impact as a writer (well, lyricist, primarily) today given the 21st C context that is often resistant to the labyrinthine ironies, contradictions, and satirical voicings that are so often foregrounded in the (especially early) work?\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts.\n\n– Martin Patrick\n\nI have no evidence, or first person testimony, or biographical confirmation, but I think Randy Newman, while primarily influencing himself in his writing (I’ve done enough, I can get away with a little sloppiness here v. that was good enough, but if you compare it to “Uncle Bob’s Midnight Blues” it’s really a cheat), has probably effected a lot of people in many fields in terms of concision, setting up zingers that don’t feel like zingers but like a slightly more stressed continuation of ordinary talk. Musicians, sure. But also novelists, journalists, filmmakers, and more. Elvis Costello, obviously, especially early on—and absorbing Newman’s skepticism about all things under the sun and his misanthropy in a way that vastly expanded the landscape of punk while drawing on older British traditions that, so to speak, made John Osborne a member of Monty Python. Denis Johnson. Maybe Rachel Kushner and Dana Spiotta. Songwriters who learned how get in and get out, how to say everything while seemingly saying nothing: isn’t Townes Van Zant’s “Waiting Around to Die” a Randy Newman song with a lazy rhythm? And isn’t that what a lot of Randy Newman songs are about, from “Uncle Bob,” again, to “A Few Words in Defense of Our Country”?\n\n9/18/22\n\nGreil, I just wanted to apologize for my nonsensical comments about “Blowin’ in the Wind”… I completely misremembered the lyrics (at my age it’s dangerous to rely solely on my memory), and I thought the “some people” referred to the oppressors not the oppressed. An Elvis version of “Over the Mountain” would be great, but I think listening to “Tryin’ to Get to You” and “Blue Moon” back to back is as close as we can get. Take care of yourself.\n\n– Peter Danakas\n\nDoesn’t matter. I think it still works.\n\n9/9/22\n\nHistorical accounts of the ’60s consistently blame the Manson murders and the Altamont tragedy for the end of the counterculture movement. Although it’s clear these events were major blows to the youthful innocence that was a cornerstone of the era, the hippie movement seems to have continued in some form well into the ’70s, and indeed the effects of it are still being felt to this day. When it is stated that these events were the end of the counterculture movement, what are they actually referring to as “ending”? Did these events feel like an ending to those who were around to experience them?\n\n– Luke Cross\n\nI don’t know about the end of the counterculture, which was always a construct. Culture is culture, as Chuck D once said, and Theodore Rozak’s CC invention was just another way of drawing lines. I don’t remember anyone referring to the Manson murders—the spectacularized ones—as the end of anything: R. Crumb thought they were the apotheosis, where it had been heading all along. But in terms of the era, the time, what people had already historicized as it was happening, there’s this real-life dialogue from Altamont, at about three in the afternoon, before anyone had died but when fantasies of turning the crowd into an army to conquer Berkeley or it turning into a fascist mob to devour itself were already rampant:\n\nPerson one: What an ending!\n\nPerson two: To what? The sixties?\n\nPerson one: No! To my book on the sixties!\n\n9/9/22\n\nAt the risk of starting this message on a rather obsequious note (however unintentionally), I’m in the midst of reading Mystery Train, and it’s the finest piece of pop culture criticism I’ve had the pleasure of reading—truly a brilliant piece of writing.\n\nAnyway, to my question (and hopefully it’s not too loaded): Would you consider Harry Styles’ recent breezy summer hit “As It Was” to be a masterpiece of modern pop music? Personally, I think it is one of the finest pop songs of the last ten years as it is instantly recognizable, has an irresistible hook, understated but highly polished production, and at 2 minutes 47 seconds in length leaves me wanting just a little more, but glad that it doesn’t outstay its welcome. It would be great to know your thoughts.\n\nMany thanks,\n\n– Dean\n\nThe production and arrangement are lovely, irresistible, but too much like a hundred other records to stand up over much time: I doubt if anyone will be playing it next summer. But the voice is paper-thin and incapable of expression. For me it’s all over by the time he comes in, and that’s under 15 seconds. This is a better Justin Timberlake number, and his voice is paint thinner.\n\n9/9/22\n\nThis week I went to an antique store and came across a photo of a blackface performance presumably from the early 20th century. It was particularly startling because the audience (or a group of people who appeared to be the audience) were all in blackface as well. Have you ever heard of a show with an audience like this?\n\n– Nick\n\nI asked Eric Lott, likely the greatest living authority on the subject: that’s not something he ever came across. Around 1900-20 it was common at large functions, like a company Christmas party, for various people to black up, just another costume on a festive occasion, but not the whole crowd. But in the 1930s black audiences were still cheering black blackface performance—that is, black people darkening their skin and drawing huge white lips around their mouths. Are you looking at blackface performers and a black audience? Want to send in the picture?\n\n9/9/22\n\nHello from Maine… A sincere thank you for your upcoming publication, Folk Music: A Bob Dylan Biography In Seven Songs. I can’t wait to read the book.\n\nA respectful question: will signed copies be available to order? From a long time reader of your work… All my thanks and well wishes.\n\n— Maurice Harmon\n\nAt bookstores where I do readings—if I do. If and when there’s a schedule of events it’ll be posted on the site.\n\n9/9/22\n\nGlad you are home and doing better. I hope your wife is well also. A quick thought and question.\n\n1. With your book coming out and Bob’s coming out, how about a joint book tour? If that would ever happen, I would pay whatever the ticket price.\n\n2. Have you ever commented on the so called cowpunk scene of the ’80s? (The Blasters, Dwight Yoakam, Los Lobos.)\n\n– James Proctor\n\nBob? Bob who? Oh, that one. No, I don’t see that happening. I’m sure he’s free and would jump at the chance, but I’m not going to be traveling for a while.\n\nDwight Yoakam has grown on me over the years, but I still think he’s a better actor.\n\nLos Lobos have made interesting records here and there but not enough.\n\nI loved the Blasters. I loved the sweat all over the cover of their first album. There’s comment on the band and Dave Alvin in Real Life Rock and the reprint of a Facebook post from Alvin in More Real Life Rock.\n\n9/9/22\n\nApologies to AG readers who may be tired of those taking a scalpel to “Blowin’ In The Wind,” but the comment from Billy [8/31] got me to actually read the lyrics to the song, and that gave me reason to climb on. In 40+ years of listening to and seeing Dylan, I don’t think I ever bothered to read those words. Why would you? They’re clear as a dinner bell on the record, and they’ve been quoted in a galaxy of writing. But when I did look at them in print, something about the song hit me like a hammer on my toes: The song could be conversation, not monologue.\n\nThe part I always found, well, maybe not clumsy, but too old-timey was the little rhythmic trick of starting the verse lines with “Yes, and…” But suddenly, I see that phrase as essential, because now I imagine each line is an interjection into another person’s speech. Someone asks the first rhetorical (“how many roads”) and then emphasizes his or her concern by adding the second (“how many seas”). Having raised some attention in the town square or tavern, a second person stands up and joins in, perhaps only trying to upstage the first, but beginning with agreement: “Yes! and…” then continuing with their concern about cannonballs.\n\nEach subsequent line of verse now seems like another person has walked up to the group with their point to make. Who are they? The line about mountains sounds like a Jewish voice to me. The next, about people being free, could be a black woman, or maybe a Honduran who just walked to Texas only to be bused to Washington. It’s an old ashamed white man, maybe, who talks about turning his head. You could insert anyone you want into the play, and you can change the time and place of the gathering a hundred different ways. You could even score it into a hack Hamilton (“Blowin’! comes to Broadway”).\n\nHave you ever read any of Dylan’s songs this way, where what seems to be the voice of one could be the voice of many? I can recall him describing conversations, but not voicing groups.\n\nNow, back to the parlor game: If we put the lines into the mouths of characters, the word to choose over “some” might be “my.”\n\n– Glenn Burris\n\nThat’s a marvelous notion. It matches, reinforces, the open and metaphorically inclusive nature of the song. Recently another contributor here made the same suggestion about “Lo and Behold!” which makes sense if you just look at lyrics and not how the song is sung, which is irrevocably in one voice—but you can hear different voices in “Blowin’ in the Wind.” I wish I’d thought of that: it would be two more pages in the opening chapter of my Folk Music, which is “Blowin’ in the Wind.”\n\nAs for ‘my people,’ I think that would be taking appropriation a bridge-on-the-River-Kwai too far.\n\n9/9/22\n\nRe: your thoughts on Bob Dylan’s “clumsy” line in “Blowin’ In The Wind”: I don’t share that view. I’ve always liked that line and don’t detect clumsiness in it. To me, “How many years can some people exist before they’re allowed to be free”—like the entire lyric of the song—scans and sounds like the writing of a raw untutored kid formulating a vision for a new type of art, feeling his way toward it, and, with “Blowin’ In The Wind,” making a big leap forward in his quest. Of course he’s not “there” yet—nowhere near there really—but my god is he ever on his way.\n\nOn the other hand, if one were to insist that the line in question had to be changed, it occurs to me that you could replace “some” with “a” without doing damage, and some might even find it an improvement: “How many years can a people exist before they’re allowed to be free.” What do you think?\n\nTo bolster this idea, see this pertinent, brief discussion about the use of the phrase “a people,” which, to me, is enlightening in this context.\n\n— Pete Fehrenbach\n\nI think you’ve got it, all around, first with your argument that ‘some’ is both ok and a sign of a writer finding his feet, and in suggesting ‘a’ as a substitute. That immediately struck me as not only right but deep, because while black people or African-Americans are not commonly referred to as a ‘people,’ Jews are: and this links blacks and Jews as outsiders. As Dylan points out in Chronicles, Minneapolis when he arrived in 1959 was notoriously anti-Semitic (Jewish doctors really couldn’t practice there)—it’s not as if it would have been a rumor to him. So thanks.\n\n9/9/22\n\nThe Beatles are now releasing a 63-track outtakes collection of Revolver. This is an album I adore as much as any but when will this fucking end?? Should it? (The rub is that I will listen and possibly adore it even more. Maybe it’s just the idea itself that makes me queasy.)\n\nBased on a short entry I think you wrote in Real Life Rock, I know you weren’t crazy about Get Back. Any general thoughts on endless Beatles regurgitations?\n\n– Terry\n\nWho knows? I’d like to know. At least on paper. Is there a track list out there?\n\n…[Later the same day] Saw the track list. All alternate takes of released songs. I can live without more versions of “Rain” or “Dr Robert,” which I never cared about anyway.\n\n9/9/22\n\nHi Greil, I’m glad you’re feeling better, and hope your health continues to improve. I appreciate you taking time out to accept and respond to all of us while you’ve been going through this ordeal. What kind of music have you been listening to while recuperating?\n\nI was thinking about the lyrics of “Blowin’ in the Wind”—I like “some people” because it sounds kind of accusatory/judgemental…implying “some people” don’t get it. One of Dylan’s lyrics I just noticed was “Tomorrow is a Long Time” when I was listening to Dion’s version, where it says “heart softly pounding”…can anything pound softly? An inadvertently humorous lyric is Johnnie and Joe’s “Over the Mountain”: “she’s passed the wind that’s blowing loud.” Did Mel Brooks co-write the song? Has anyone commented on this before? I’ve often thought a book of “reviews” of songs Elvis should have covered would have been fun. Couldn’t you see “Patches” as part of EP’s That’s the Way It Is set? Have you gotten into the reaction videos on Youtube? Some of them are pretty interesting—young African-Americans hearing/seeing “Papa was a Rolling Stone” for the first time, or being exposed to Elvis’s 1968 performances, and just not knowing the context…whether it’s a concert or a movie, or what. Then being subjected to the 1977 Elvis as Charles Laughton “Unchained Melody,” which seems kind of cruel to show an unsuspecting young viewer. You discussed this performance with someone a while ago. I’ve seen it several times over the years, but this time I noticed for the first time (I’m sure it was edited from the TV special, or from my memory) how casually and viciously cruel Elvis is to poor Charlie Hodge, who is just loyally and lovingly escorting him to the grand piano, which is covered with amusement park red cups of Coke,\n\nso that Elvis can offer his message of love and longing to Thanatos.\n\nAnyway, I’ve taken up to much of your time. Thanks for all your great work over the years, and your patience. I hope you continue getting better and stronger.\n\n– Peter Danakas\n\nI’d love to hear Elvis do “Over the Mountain.” I can’t believe those lyrics are in the song. Johnny was a very attentive guy. I doubt that would have passed his lips. So to speak.\n\nMessage from Greil (8/31/22)\n\nAfter nearly four months I am out of the hospital and doing what I can to stay out. I deeply appreciate the encouragement and affection from all who’ve written in to offer it.\n\n8/31/22\n\nWell, school starts tomorrow (I teach high school) and I am finishing my American Studies syllabus while enjoying the Spotify Mystery Train playlist on shuffle.\n\nHigh school juniors were mostly born in 2005-6. They were literally babies when Taylor Swift’s first album came out.\n\nI am thinking of using some of Mystery Train later in the year, when we talk about modern popular culture—and what it replaced. I wonder, though. If you were trying to teach Gen Zers about the music that they won’t hear while following their folks through Trader Joe’s, what might you focus on? Would you talk about the Sun Sessions? Robert Johnson?\n\nNot asking you to plan my course, I promise! Just curious what you think about when you think about music and Gen Z.\n\nThanks and take care.\n\n– Pat\n\nI have granddaughters, 14 and 11. The younger one especially loves Lana Del Rey, but my sense is that they will respond to anything they hear and like regardless of its provenance—or especially without provenance, without the burden of knowledge and presumed importance.\n\nThat brings up the question of teaching, or music in a teaching environment, which is precisely about the burden of knowledge and presumed importance. Given that, at least from the picture drawn in Mystery Train, I’d say go for what might seem, on paper, the most distant, anomalous, and foreign (“the past is a foreign country”): Robert Johnson. His music has been shocking people into self-recognition for going on ninety years—people who philistine cultural critics might assume had nothing in common with a young and itinerant black man from Mississippi and Memphis in the 1930s. Without flogging Bob Dylan’s name (that is, without mentioning it, just framed as a typical response from people hearing Johnson from way back then to last year) you might want to read his comments on first hearing Johnson (who he’d never heard of) in 1961, in his Chronicles (“I immediately differentiated between him and anyone else I’d ever heard”). Then play the music and ask people to respond. Don’t expect people to like it or respond at all. Most might not. But if you can draw your students out, so they understand there is no mandated or incumbent response, you might be surprised at what you hear. Does this music sound familiar? Odd? Strange? When would you guess it was made? Why listen to it now?\n\nFor more reading, for them or for you, Brother Robert: Growing Up with Robert Johnson, by Annye C. Anderson.\n\n8/31/22\n\nMany thanks for this column, it’s provided much joy and has been a wonderful source of discovery.\n\nI agree, “How many years can some people exist?” is clumsy af. Still, how else could Dylan have phrased such a sentiment?\n\n– Billy\n\nI’m stumped. I’ve fooled around in my head with “our people” and just “people” but they don’t work. Any more ideas?\n\n8/31/22\n\nDo you think Mark Ribowsky’s book on Hank Williams improves on Colin Escott’s, which you once recommended in your notes for Mystery Train? I know I gave you my opinion already but this is your turf and I’d still like to know yours. Also what other books by Ribowsky stand out to you besides the Spector bio? (If his Temptations bio is one of them, I’m fine with that sir.)\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\nI haven’t read it—didn’t know of it. There are fine moments in the Escott book, but my favorite on Hank Williams is a few pages in John Fahey’s How Bluegrass Music Destroyed My Life and Chet Flippo’s book.\n\n8/31/22\n\nHope your recovery is going well.\n\nYou have been on my mind lately as I have been doing some research for a podcast on the ‘old weird’ brand many of us have mutually come to admire. Lots of that passion is rooted in some of the graffiti you have left along the railroad tracks of the Smithville/Kill Devil Hills Line. This is not unlike the the sign from The Walking Dead leading to Terminus, that initially reads “SANCTUARY FOR ALL COMMUNITY. FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARRIVE SURVIVE,” but is defaced by Rick Grimes to instead heed “NO SANCTUARY.”\n\nAs Mary says:\n\n“The signs… they were real. It was a sanctuary. People came and took this place. And they raped. And they killed. And they laughed! Over weeks… but we got out. And we fought and we got it back and we heard the message! You’re the butcher… or you’re the cattle.”\n\nSpeaking of cattle, well at least of the land of cattle… Texas’s Stevie Ray Vaughan is often the first name dropped when I try to have a conversation about the blues with pretty much anyone. Am I missing something, or is this perhaps the biggest tragedy of the genre? I cannot say anything about SRV except he is a proficient guitar player. But, even then, there are much more compelling listens, even within Texas Blues (Pee Wee Crayton comes immediately to mind).\n\nFor some reason, I cringe inside whenever Stevie Ray Vaughan is brought up. Am I missing something? Why does he often live at the seat of guitar gods next to Jimi Hendrix? In my book, he is the Demiurge of the blues.\n\n– Rich Soni\n\nI feel exactly the same. There’s no there there.\n\n8/31/22\n\nAfter reading your essay on Inherent Vice, I dreamed of hearing the music of The Doors in the film adaptation. I didn’t and assume it is because they weren’t hip enough for PT Anderson. I would love to hear what you thought of the movie. I have also searched and failed to find your responses to Scorsese’s NO DIRECTION HOME and ROLLING THUNDER and am even more eager to hear your take on them. (I just read your take on Creedence of the 24th and it exemplifies why you are my favorite critic. Your words generate the same excitement in me that Pauline Kael’s do.)\n\n– Robert Puccinelli\n\nThere’s only one stray reference to the Doors in Inherent Vice—some cover band in a club playing I don’t remember what—“Strange Days”? “People are Strange”? And probably too expensive to license the real thing even if the production company wanted it. And the movie is terrible.\n\nI wrote a piece about the first public screening of No Direction Home, at the Telluride Film Festival, in the Australian film journal Studies in Documentary Film [recently posted here]. At the same time Don DeLillo and I had a public conversation on the film and his novel Great Jones Street, which is also on this site.\n\nI didn’t write about Scorsese’s Rolling Thunder Revue film because my favorite part—other than the stunning performance of “Isis”—was the Michael Murphy interview—fictional character transposed out of Tanner 88 into another movie—and I couldn’t get a handle on it. With the Criterion Collection DVD with fine liner notes by Dana Spiotta I may take another crack at it.\n\n8/31/22\n\nFrom reading Expecting Rain I get links to Ask Greil… and came upon the “Blowin’ in the Wind” questions, in response to which u declare a line “clumsy writing.”\n\nHe was what? 21 when he wrote it?\n\n21! I think you thinking that is kind of ridiculous thinking .\n\nMy question is, what if political right leaning people enjoy your books and have similar taste and loves for the same type of music you write about? Does that annoy you in any way?\n\n– James O’ Donnell\n\nYour question reminds me of an incident during the free and liberating punk years in San Francisco, 1977-83 or so, when I was having the time of my life DJing at a big noisy club when two women about 20 came up and said “Play some of that great nigger soul music we know you love.” I was so shocked and appalled I had no idea what to say or do. I don’t remember what I did say or do. But what you’re talking about is hardly on that level. Given that my politics have always been rooted in the New Deal and the Free Speech Movement and that that has informed every book I’ve written, I find what you’re suggesting a little unlikely. No one has ever said to me anything like “I liked this or that and given that your politics are so fucked up I can’t understand why.” I doubt if anyone ever said to Philip Roth, “The Plot Against America is total bullshit, a typical sentimental liberal fantasy, but I read it three times because the writing is so exquisite.” And none of that is happening on the level of thugs playing Nirvana’s’ “Polly” while committing rape and torture, something that drove Kurt Cobain mad: If my music which was made to show the world what evil is not by saying it’s bad, which is meaningless, but by acting it out, by showing that it is a human choice, like Dostoyevsky did, produces not good but more evil, what is there left to do but never write or sing another song?\n\n8/31/22\n\nIt may be me, because evidently he’s a national treasure (see Jody Rosen’s piece in The Sunday Times Magazine) but I don’t like Willie Nelson. I admit in the late ’70s I was attracted to his misterioso western Red Headed Stranger and the elegant Stardust, but even those have curdled for me over the years. Even though I have no reason to believe he’s anything but sincere, he just seems phony to me. And I find his singing flat. I don’t remember you ever saying anything about him one way or another so I was wondering, has he ever done anything for you?\n\n– Chuck\n\nThere was a time when his standards album sounded good. That was perhaps before he applied his basic lachrymose runny-nose singing to whatever he goes near, thus becoming the most self branded and boring singer on the planet.\n\n8/26/22\n\nYou referred to RJ Smith’s upcoming Chuck Berry biography as “shockingly good.” Why shockingly? And did you ever have occasion to speak with Chuck?\n\n– Craig Zeller\n\nThat RJ was able to unearth so much, and weave it into an increasingly complex set of stories is not shocking. It’s that without ever saying anything of the sort he comes away with a sense that the greater story is not transparent, and that becomes the source of the shocking depth he is able to draw out of it.\n\nIn 1969 Cal invited CB to deliver a lecture at the student Union and he accepted. I was in grad school there and went, along with a full house. As we were all waiting, I noticed a handsome well-dressed man trying to open one of the outside glass doors to the room. I went over, opened the door, said “Welcome to Berkeley,” shook his hand, and walked him to the podium. He began by saying he had agreed to give a lecture and take questions: “The lecture—eh. The questions—Ahhhh.” And then he talked about everything. Rolling Stone’s photographer, the late Baron Wolman, was there: one of his pictures from that day is on the cover of RJ Smith’s book. I taped it and transcribed it and we ran it in Rolling Stone without permission or complaint.\n\n8/26/22\n\nWhat is your view on David Leaf updating and re-publishing The Beach Boys and the California Myth next month?\n\n– Ben Merliss\n\nI have no view. When the book came out originally I thought he didn’t know what he was talking about. I had two grandfathers in San Francisco during the earthquake. One lived in Golden Gate Park before moving to San Jose and the other was a marshal. Californians generally consider life in California real life. I never heard the terms ‘California myth’ or ‘California dream’ growing up. We learned all about the Gold Rush but also that the real California gold was agriculture. Avocados. Grapes and raisins. Oranges and stone fruit. Alien seed pods…\n\n8/26/22\n\nMy favorite Voight role is Jonas Hodges, a 24 heavy who directed a coup against Hillary stand-in Cherry Jones and then spent the rest of his time sulking because nobody realized what a patriot he is. So maybe not Trump, but how about Rudy?\n\n– Kevin Bicknell\n\nGroucho Marx.\n\n8/26/22\n\nHope mid-August finds you feeling better.\n\nWith the Kingston Trio making an appearance in Ask Greil, some may be interested to learn what Elvis sounded like while being backed by them. It seems in mid-1966 Presley and pals taped some typical-for-the time folk music sing-alongs, accompanied by sharp acoustic guitar, among them Kingston Trio staples “500 Miles” and “Blowin’ In The Wind“:\n\nNo “Tom Dooley,” though.\n\nRCA found the reel at Graceland in the 1990s and released portions on their collector imprint: In A Private Moment (Follow That Dream, March 16, 2000).\n\nThose acoustics sounded familiar, and after some digging I discovered they were singing to an instrumental album: Sing A Song With The Kingston Trio (Capitol SKAO-2005, November 15, 1963).\n\nThis unusual disc first appeared as “the glamour of JFK’s New Frontier” was about to end.\n\nFunny world.\n\n– Johnny Savage\n\nWhat a great discovery. Now, if they could just get all those other people off the tracks so you could hear Elvis…\n\n8/26/22\n\nThis past weekend I happened across Inside Llewyn Davis, possibly the only Coen production I’d missed in its initial release. The leads do a fine job, though the Coen’s odd-ball-in-and-out approach has worn a bit thin at this point. I was too lazy to look, but if you reviewed or in any way discussed this one I’m willing to bet you thought the performances were way off. That doesn’t really come home until the very end, when an unidentified Bob Dylan takes the stage. The rest sound like ’70s singer-songwriters rather than participants of the early ’60s folk movement. If anything, Oscar Isaac sounds like Dave Matthews more than Dave Von Ronk.\n\nJust wondered what your take was.\n\n– Derek Murphy\n\nI did write about it, in Artforum. Your comparison to ’70s singer-songwriters and Dave Matthews—I wish I’d thought of that.\n\n8/26/22\n\nI think of you as someone who isn’t hobbled by a lot of “shoulds.” That is, I think you follow your tastes and curiosities—in terms of what you listen to, what you read, what you watch, and what you teach—without any anxiety about being comprehensive. (I imagine, for example, that if you taught a course in noir literature and movies, you’d teach the books and movies that interest you, and you wouldn’t feel obliged to include anything just because other people consider it canonical.)\n\nBut I’m curious as to whether this is true, or if I’m to some extent creating an imaginary Greil Marcus in my head.\n\n– Cyrus Robertson\n\nI hope it’s true.\n\n8/26/22\n\nI hope you are well, Mr. Marcus.\n\nI have read Mystery Train and Invisible Republic/The Old Weird America. In both, you discuss the Band in the context of America. Have you ever written anything, or do you wish to say something, that addresses the fact that they are four fifths Canadian?\n\n– Jonathan Ryshpan\n\nI hate it when people say, “That’s in the book,” but I do talk about this quite a bit in Mystery Train. I don’t really discuss their Canadianness—what a musical paradise Yonge St. in Toronto was in the early ’60s, or Robbie on the reservation, let alone what he learned about crime and subterfuge from his mobbed-up Toronto uncle—but their attraction to America as The Place, the Source, is a main theme. And the title of the chapter I hope suggests that they were pilgrims to the USA.\n\n8/26/22\n\nDo you remember the first time you heard The White Album—or what it was like living with that album in the days or months after it was released? If so, I would love to hear about it.\n\nTake care and I hope you feel better soon.\n\n– Andy\n\nEndless talk. Speculation. The labyrinth of songs. Favorites changing by the day. Holier than thou put down by a New York Times critic saying it was inferior to the new Blood Sweat and Tears album (the appalling pretentious second one that replaced Al Kooper with the horrible David Clayton Thomas) and Jann Wenner’s capture of the Times critic: “Either he is deaf or he is evil.” Days organizing themselves around “Helter Skelter,” “I’m so Tired” (waiting for that ripped guitar note at the end), and the titanic “Yer Blues.” Realizing that “Back in the USSR” is wonderful and has lasted because “California Girls” is wonderful and has lasted.\n\nAnd what does it mean that the immortal versions of “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” which was undeniable from the start, are those made without George? The live performance with Paul singing and Clapton playing? The big band session (and thank God, but how did they keep that camera hog G.E. Smith away?), where at the end Prince swallows the earth?\n\nMaybe more than any other Beatles album it makes you realize how much was lost.\n\n8/24/22\n\nI hope you are comfortable and recovering. I’m spending some time with Real Life Rock, and I note that even then you saw through Rudy Giuliani— it is strange that many of us had always seen [him] for what he has shown himself to be—but for many others he seemed heroic—even before his catastrophic judgement before the towers fell. (see, e.g., Real Life Rock, 9/17/2001, entry 10.) So, a question: I don’t think I’ve read anything by you about bullies, and specifically the mentality of bullying and the culture that supports it. I would put it to you that the Republican Party as it exists today resembles the culture of the townsfolk in High Noon, terrified into submission by a bully. Your thoughts?\n\n– Bill Altreuter\n\nI don’t think the Republican Party is cowed by Donald Trump. Within the party he is a legitimate political actor promoting fascist morons in primaries, and Republican voters vote for them because they embody their anti-democratic values and make them, the voters, feel like empowered political actors. As I’ve said many times, I don’t believe support for democracy in this country, except perhaps in very special and circumscribed periods of time, has ever exceeded 65 percent and is usually much lower. Democracy is a burden. You have to make choices and defend them. Many people would prefer that all decisions be made for them like the dictator Trump thought he was and seeks to become. This is far beyond bullying.\n\nOn a personal, physical, verbal level, of course he’s a bully—though omitting the physical, so was George W. Bush with his renaming of everyone around him to make sure they understood he owned them. Combine bigotry and racism and all around contempt—as one person put it, Trump really does believe he’s the best person ever born—and you have a killer, which again is far beyond a bully. It’s forgotten, or ignored, that along with his other crimes and depredations, Trump, with the. Operation of Bill Barr, left office as a serial killer. No one had been executed in the Federal system for years before Trump: he had 13 people killed, the ultimate exercise of power, in his last year, including six after his defeat, as a thumb in the nose to anti-death penalty Joe Biden.\n\nJohn Hamm tells a story about encountering Trump and Bill O’Reilly at parties, and the way the two of them would dominate the room, pushing people aside, breaking up conversations, insulting people around them or who approached them, as “tall guys” flaunting tall guy power: physically intimidating people, just as Trump, in his debate with Hillary, lurked over her like Boris Karloff. It didn’t work with him, Hamm said, “because I’m a tall guy, too.” But he found it fascinating to watch.\n\n8/24/22\n\nYou introduced me to the writings of Hannah Arendt. It was a 1978 (I think) review in the Village Voice of her book The Life of the Mind which, if I remember correctly, you had problems with. Since that review isn’t on your site, would you say a few words about her work?\n\n– Chuck\n\nThe philosophy section of Arendt’s posthumously published The Life of the Mind seemed to sink under the weight of her never-abandoned worship of Heidegger: when she was his student, her lover, truly great philosopher, Nazi, anti-Semite, and who, after his Denazification, in an interview that was not to be published until after his death, still proclaimed “Only a god can save us,” and he wasn’t talking about a spirit in the sky. The timidity, her claims of ignorance—anything to avoid the stain that covered him like a suit.\n\nI encountered Arendt and On Revolution (still, for me, her best book, the most suggestive, the most made of story-telling, in its way kin to Camus’s The Rebel) in 1966, the same year I read Pauline Kael’s I Lost it at the Movies. I think I’ve always associated them: two Jewish women much smarter than they were supposed to be, outraging people who were supposed to know what they were talking about, but with their hard-boiled and yet gorgeous prose leaving their detractors and enemies in the dust (though especially Eichmann in Jerusalem they nearly destroyed Arendt).\n\nNot all of her books have lasted. I don’t think The Origins of Totalitarianism holds water; I think Norman Cohn’s The Pursuit of the Millennium is far more convincing. Homo Faber has a concept that is far too weak to sustain a whole book. Men in Dark Times is a concept that animates all of her best work and yet the book is missing something, some spark—compared to Eric Ambler’s prewar thrillers about Europe descending into barbarism like Cause for Alarm and Journey into Fear it feels hollow.\n\nThe touchstones for me remain On Revolution, Between Past and Future (one of the great phrases of 20th century romanticism), and Eichmann in Jerusalem. The latter especially can take your breath away with its argument that the determinative purpose of the Nazi regime was the "
