        "text": "I was talking to Jim Hynes the other day at Bud’s Farmhouse Coffee (hands down, best coffee in town) about a recording session he had been hired for in New York City (Jim plays trumpet, you know) by Grammy Award winner Charles Pillow, a wildly talented multi-instrumentalist and professor of jazz saxophone at the Eastman School of Music. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, the session has been delayed by several weeks (or months) by the dreaded omicron variant.\n\nHas there ever been a more awkwardly named illness in human history? Omicron variant, indeed.\n\nHave you noticed that “delta omicron” is an anagram for “media control”?\n\nI think coronaviruses should be named using the hurricane convention. You know, go from A to Z, using ethnically diverse first names and alternating gender. Virus Albert. Virus Bernadette. Virus Cyrus. Virus Diana. Virus Emilio. Virus Freyde. Virus Gene. Virus Hermione.\n\nSpeaking of Charles Pillow recording sessions, my wife gave me a record player for Christmas, plus a couple of new records to add to my considerable LP collection.\n\nOne of the new records is Whitney Houston’s album of Christmas songs. One cut on the record, “Who Would Imagine a King,” is credited to Knoxville’s own Triple H, Mr. Hallerin Hilton Hill.\n\nIt’s a curious album, oddly over-produced in a way that muddies the water of what should be a perfectly clear reflecting pond. It took me back, by contrast, to Whitney Houston’s very first presence on vinyl. Do you remember it?\n\nThat’s a trick question. Whitney Houston’s first recorded song was called “Memories.”\n\nDaughter of Cissy Houston (the soulful gospel singer and a back-up vocalist for Elvis Presley), Whitney’s debut appeared on an album called \"One Down,\" produced in 1982 by the avant-garde bassist Bill Laswell with his band named Material. It’s indicative of where I was coming from that I knew Laswell’s work frontwards and backwards when \"One Down\" came out, but I had never heard of Whitney.\n\nThe Village Voice music critic Robert Christgau wrote that “Memories” was “one of the most gorgeous ballads you’ve ever heard.”\n\nIt’s hard to believe Whitney passed away a decade ago. Feb. 11, 2012. COVID-19 somehow makes everything seem like it happened in another lifetime. In another world.\n\nMaterial was always an amorphous consortium of artists, more an idea circus than a band, but always orbiting Laswell’s nucleus. On a Material record, you might encounter anyone from Wayne Shorter to William S. Burroughs, Bootsy Collins, Henry Threadgill, Johnny Lydon, Bernie Worrell, Nile Rodgers, or Nona Hendryx. Material was as unpredictable and indefinite as a band could be. Like a cloud. And Whitney fell like a gentle rain from that cloud.\n\n“Memories” is hauntingly prescient, now that it can be heard as a distant memory. In 1982, it was prophetic.\n\nSomething in the song hooked me instantly ... probably the sax breaks by Archie Shepp that wove the song together. Or its quintessential New Yorkness. Or the gut-wrenching lyrics:\n\n“Memories can hang you up and haunt you / All your life, you know / Get so you cannot stay / And yet cannot go.”\n\n“Hey, I could find out where you’ve gone today / I feel so unhappy / Streets seem so empty now / I want you, I want you with me.”\n\n“Maybe I’ll find someone to get you off my mind / Take me away from here / And leave it, leave it all behind.”\n\nWith lyrics by Hugh Hopper, and music by Laswell and Brian Eno, the most influential record producer of the 1980s (Talking Heads, U2, King Crimson, David Bowie, Jon Hassell, Daniel Lanois, etc.), “Memories” is the kind of song that anchors a cultural era, even if the era completely ignores it.\n\nThe era of 1982 was much more focused on songs by Prince, the Eurythmics, Michael Jackson, Donna Summer, and Marvin Gaye. Then Whitney flew in under the radar and upstaged them all with her sheer fearless depth and beauty.\n\nDance theater\n\nThe year \"Memories\" was released, I took part with Momix in a fascinating experiment in dance theater, and I licensed the song for use in the experiment.\n\nMost people have never seen it, but there is a notation system for dance called Labanotation. On paper, it looks like a mix of hieroglyphics and stenography. In theory, you can create a “score” for a dance work, no matter how complex. In the same way a symphony can be scored, every movement and gesture of a George Balanchine ballet or a Twyla Tharp duet for mounted police can be scored in Labanotation.\n\nTo test Labanotation’s applicability to experimental and avant-garde dance, the Dance Notation Bureau in New York City engaged five dance companies to create new dance works for five college dance departments around the United States. Five scribes were dispatched to “score” the new dance works. Then after the choreographing process, the scores were shuffled among the participating colleges, and their dance companies were asked to stage the new works with only the Labanotation scores as a guide.\n\nIn our case, Momix was paired with the dance department at City College of New York. We had a month to work on a new piece. As was our wont, we decided not to spend time at CCNY’s Harlem studios. Instead we brought the 12-person CCNY company up to Washington Depot in northwest Connecticut, 100 miles from Harlem in more ways than one, where Momix was based. We had a 22-room Victorian house, and a repurposed carriage house for a dance studio.\n\nWorking with college dance students was not our thing. Not at all. So we suddenly had 12 inner-city kids living in our remote artist colony ... kids who had never been out of NYC. Every shadow, every spider, every meal scared the you-know-what out of them. And they had no vocabulary to grasp what we were about, theatrically, dance-wise or artistically. They might as well have been in China ... until I played \"Memories.” Then Whitney Houston provided the vocabulary.\n\nAfter two weekends in the country, we finished \"Children on the Hill,\" a 20-minute piece for nine dancers, to tell a tale of urban solitary confinement turned inside out.\n\nThe score started with “Memories” in total blackout, followed by a slow dub by Nigerian guitarist Sunny Ade, three pieces by soft-pedal pianist Harold Budd, and ending with \"Si Chatoillieux\" by Robert Palmer and Adrian Belew. It was, in a word, unusual.\n\nWe intended to make a piece that would tie Labanotation in knots. But several months after the piece debuted at City College, its score was sent to the University of Hawaii’s dance department, and in a performance a few weeks later, they recreated the Momix/CCNY piece perfectly. Labanotation worked.\n\nExcept for one thing. It couldn’t convey emotion. Steps and gestures, yes. But emotions, not so much. The emotion of “I feel so unhappy” was lost in the hieroglyphics. And the revelations bestowed on young CCNY dancers by the depths of Whitney’s voice, they didn’t make it to Hawaii.\n\nNuance lives in Harlem, not in Honolulu. And nuance is what this article is about.\n\nMarcel Marceau\n\n2022 also marks the 15th year since the passing of the most nuanced performer the stages of this world ever knew. His birth name was Marcel Mengel. But the world knew him as Marcel Marceau. He adopted a French name to mask his Jewish identity. That says it all somehow. And his name change was as effective as the white makeup he wore as a mime.\n\nMarceau was only 16 when the Nazis occupied France. After he fled his home in Strasbourg on the border with Germany, he joined the organized underground resistance to lead hundreds of orphaned Jewish children to safety in Switzerland.\n\nHe told the kids he was taking them on vacation in the Alps, and he kept them quiet through long nights hiding in forests with his enchanting, silent storytelling.\n\nMarceau risked his life on three of these expeditions. And he paid a terrible price for the children’s freedom. His own father was arrested by the Nazis, sent in a packed boxcar to Auschwitz, and killed in a gas chamber.\n\nMarceau’s wartime legend includes a story of an encounter with a unit of German soldiers who were somehow convinced by the talented mime that he was leading a large assault group when, in fact, he was alone. The 30-man German unit surrendered to Marceau.\n\nAfter the war, Marceau studied theater in Paris at Charles Dullin’s School of Dramatic Arts at the Sarah Bernhardt Theater in the Châtelet district, now known as the Théâtre de la Ville, just across the Seine from Notre Dame. One of his teachers was the innovative actor and mime Jean-Louis Barrault.\n\nBarrault starred in Marcel Carné’s classic film “Children of Paradise,” about the originator of French mime arts, Baptiste Deburau. Monty Python's Terry Gilliam called it \"one of those films we'll never see again. It's a movie that ends without resolution.\"\n\nThe film was made during the Nazi occupation, so at the same time Marceau was leading orphans to Switzerland, Barrault was making film history with Carné in one of the most remarkable movies ever produced about theater and theater people.\n\nIt's my absolute favorite movie experience. The first time I saw \"Les Enfants du Paradis\" was at the Oak Ridge Playhouse, in Gene Eichler's Saturday morning Janus Studios foreign films series. I was 15. Later I saw it about 10 times at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nForty years ago, right after the CCNY project, Momix performed at the Sarah Bernhardt/Théâtre de la Ville for 1,600 people every evening for three weeks in a row. Marceau and Barrault, both in their 60s then, were big fans. One of my most treasured memories of that time is from a misty afternoon at the Tower of St. Jacques with Marcel and Jean-Louis, talking about the differences between Momix and Sankai Juku, the Japanese butoh dancers we shared the stage with. They called Sankai Juku the “mimes of death” and Momix the “mimes of joy.”\n\nTo be fair, the Jukes were much better mimes than Momix. Our work wasn't mime at all. We were just having a good time. Sankai Juku was all business.\n\nBarrault and Marceau now rest in the same Parisian cemetery as Baptiste Deburau. And my fear about the future is that kids will not learn about them.\n\nI bet if I asked all the Oak Ridge High Schools students who were in the cast and crew of “Clue” last month, “Do you recognize these faces?” and showed them photos of Barrault and Marceau, no one would say \"yes.\" Not one.\n\nPhotos of Marcel Marceau without his mime makeup are rare. He was famous for throwing photographers out of any theater he performed in. But here are a few very special treasures, taken by a gifted photographer named Marilyn McKinley who, as an arts administrator in Lima, Ohio, was the first person to book a performance by Momix when the group was getting started.\n\nFor several years in the 1990s, Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio flew Marceau in for several weeks to teach at their resident Goldstone/Johnson School for Mimes.\n\nMcKinley and Marceau had a barrier-breaking relationship which granted her a rare candid access to the reclusive artist. He told her she was good at taming people with her camera.\n\nMcKinley thanked Marceau with a surprise formal dinner on stage at the end of one summer session, attended by the mime school's faculty and students, complete with oriental rugs, fine silver, china, tables and chairs.\n\nWhen he walked in, Marceau stood still for a minute, then quipped: \"I didn't know you were so sophisticated.\"\n\nThat highlights the deepest loss we have suffered from this horrendous SARS CoV-2, the abyss that lies now between us and the foundations of our culture. The abyss gets deeper every day.\n\nCulture, as embodied in concerts, plays, museum exhibits, poetry readings, art auctions, dance performances, operas, ballets, and surprise dinners on a stage, is utterly dependent on continuity. And COVID has shot continuity to smithereens.\n\nWhen ruptures like COVID happen, enormous chunks of common cultural inheritance go down the drain. It's like an Antarctic ice shelf that breaks away and disintegrates.\n\nJust look at what COVID has done to civic discourse. Or interpersonal discourse. Or internal discourse! It's a film that ends without resolution.\n\nAnother lifetime. In another world.\n\nJohn Job is a longtime Oak Ridge resident and frequent contributor to The Oak Ridger."
