        "text": "December 11, 2007\n\nTelling it like it is, from the once, if not future, Dean of Rock N' Roll Criticism\n\nSeptember 17, 2010\n\nA great collection of columns from the Village Voice and elsewhere by one of the founders of serious pop criticism.\n\nApril 12, 2020\n\nEarly Christgau, before he abandoned rock. Some Consumer Guides in their infancy, some interesting articles/think pieces on the state of rock and the counterculture, some insightful artists profiles (Tull, Creedence, Zappa, etc, oh and lots of Beatles & Stones), some gossip, and some stuff about Dylan I skipped.\n\nAugust 20, 2023\n\nVery interesting to see opinions and attitudes from the time and what has held up and where long-term musical interests have varied from what Christgau thought would be longer lasting.\n\nJanuary 6, 2018\n\nGood selection of Christgau's early writings for the Village Voice and Newsday. Especially interesting for contemporary reviews of albums. I'm used to reading criticism written 10, 20, 30 years after the fact, after time and distance has made it impossible to really *hear* those albums without all of the accumulated baggage. His enthusiasm for the New York Dolls, for example, who had yet to release their debut album, is thrilling. Now of course critics love the Dolls b/c they epitomize glam and presage punk, but in 1972 Christgau loved them unequivocally b/c they played old-fashioned, straight-ahead rock 'n' roll, which was presumed to be dead after 'Sgt. Pepper' turned rock 'n' roll into Rock (i.e., popular music with artistic pretensions.)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\n\"Repetition without tedium is the backbone of rock and roll\" the author writes of Chuck Berry, and this collection of essays and analysis shows that it is also the foundation of effective criticism; Christgau's unending ability to always poke pop culture's pressure points never ceases to impress"
