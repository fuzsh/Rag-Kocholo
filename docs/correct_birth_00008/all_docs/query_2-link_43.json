        "text": "“For now, [Matt] Gaetz seeks to project a victor’s air of comity. ‘I am not some Lord of the Flies nihilist,’ he said in a recent interview.”\n\n–New York Times, 29 January 2023\n\nPresumably Times reporter Robert Draper means “comity” in the sense of “courtesy and considerate behavior toward others” rather than “an association of nations for their mutual benefit” — after all, as The American Prospect‘s David Dayen and others have pointed out, most of the alleged concessions that Gaetz and his fellow bomb-thrower Republican House holdouts got out of their not-since-the-Civil-War 15 speaker ballots is precisely the kind of budgetary and investigative terrorism Kevin McCarthy and his supposedly less radical GOP establishment have long clearly salivated over the first place. “In today’s Republican Party,” Dayen reiterates, “everyone is a hi-jacker.”\n\nWe’ll be living the perilous effects non-stop for at least the next two years even if DeSantis and Trump miraculously manage to cancel each other out, so it makes good sense that democracy-loving anti-fascists would want to present a united front and defend decadent Western values and AP African American studies against the ever-encroaching tide of illiberal authoritarianism and conspiracy-peddling paranoia just like Volodomyr Zelensky and his courageous countrypeople taught us.\n\nBut you know what? That really really really doesn’t mean we all have to love the exact same record albums. Sounds obvious, right? Yet in my onetime mentor turned Village Voice co-editor turned Pazz & Jop poobah co-emeritus Robert Christgau’s annual Dean’s List essay — the only year-capping pop analysis I came across in the year he turned 80, now that Slate’s Music Club has seemingly been put out to pasture — he wishes his rundown of 2022 favorites “would signal a flowering of aesthetic comity in the anxiety-prone little world of rock criticism,” then goes on to lament that “the critical comity I wish I could celebrate at this fraught historical juncture has not been forthcoming.” Beyond, at least, the facts thats lots of critics seemed to really really really like the Beyoncé album’s homage to bygone dance-club styles, and that four other albums (by Kendrick Lamar, Rosalía, Big Thief, Alvvays) wound up in various orders near the top of various other lists he saw.\n\nAfter decades of him highlighting the same general theme from every conceivable angle, I still don’t understand what Christgau thinks is to be gained by music critics filing extremely similar best-of ballots — a sense of community in a post-pandemic very-online era of atomization and social distance, I suppose? So to put it another way, I still don’t understand how me preferring different albums from you means we don’t share a sense of community. Especially when the lists Christgau’s comparing aren’t critics polls per sé but rather what he himself admits are “journalistic branding” exercises mapping out aesthetic perimeters of publications from print mags like Rolling Stone and websites like Pitchfork on down. Lists by committee may well serve a purpose, but I’ll never trust them; if you don’t show me the math, I wonder what you’re hiding. Admittedly, rock critic polls aren’t what they used to be back in the days when the Dean and I ran one. But though he mentions the facebook-originated, 349-voter, not-just-critics Pazz & Jop Ripoff Poll, he intentionally or obliviously ignores the 187-voter Uproxx Music Critics Poll and 43-voter Expert Witness Poll (named for a later post-Voice iteration of his own Consumer Guide.)\n\nFor what it’s worth, the 2022 album that Christgau asserts most “inspired something like universal acclaim” appeared on just 12.6% of Pazz & Jop Ripoff Poll ballots, 41.7% of Uproxx ballots and 48.8% of Expert Witness ballots — 143 out of 579 ballots total, which is to say just under one out every four poll participants considered it one of the year’s ten best (though presumably both some Beyoncé voters and non-Beyoncé voters filed ballots in more than one poll, more or less balancing the teeter-totter.) Whatever acclaim that is, it ain’t universal — no matter how many Grammys she brings home on Sunday night.\n\nBob opts for editorial-we publication lists over all of those, and not only because the polls themselves are mere shadows of what 494-voters-in-2006 Pazz & Jop used to be. “A professional journalist since 1964,” he explains, “I do retain a fondness for the increasingly chimerical notion of publication — now predominantly web-based I know, aware that I’ve lost that battle even if five households in my 16-unit building still get the newsprint New York Times delivered.” (So do I — both weekdays and Sundays, on my veritable driveway in Austin not New York, at least during those periods when the car-delivery person hasn’t quit yet and they’re not still trying to find and train a new one, or when the new one hasn’t figured out which house has our street address highly visible right between the garden and the curb, goddammit. A newspaper employee in and frequently since the mid ’70s, I miss the days when actual teenagers could deliver the paper on foot or bikes, like my brothers and I used to with the Detroit Free Press. But to make that cost-effective, you need more people who want actual newsprint.)\n\nAnyway, back to the point at hand, here’s Frank Kogan via email: “‘comity’ seems an even worse word than ‘consensus’ for ‘some records show up on enough people’s lists to to place high in more than one poll’; think a better def’n would be ‘we try to pay at least some attention to what each other – and others – are listening to.’ Of course, if that attention is paid, the result would be some overlap, and the overlap shows up on eyo [eddytor’s note: i.e., end of year] polls – but I’d say, given the glut of availability, the amount of same choices the eyo polls get is about right, and anything more would be phony.”\n\nMore Frank, in a followup email: “Why is ‘comity’ [American Heritage: ‘An atmosphere of social harmony’] defined as ‘enough different critics – who differ enough in emphasis and taste that they veer towards different publications – esteem some of the same music enough that the music they esteem in common makes it to more than one end-of-year poll’ rather than, say, ‘enough critics esteem some of what’s on the charts, enough so that some of it makes it into more than one end-of-year poll’? Not that that’s a good definition of comity either, just why the emphasis on fellow critics? But of course the charts have a narrow range, some of what’s on the charts is bad music, some of what’s on the charts is oppressive music (whether bad or good, and there’s always the question of whether or how much you can count good music that’s oppressive as good) – why not ditto for what other critics think is good (since critics don’t have a monopoly on taste and virtue, and tend to be similar in social class and category and have been socialized into a similar intellectual subclass, and why would our micro subclass have a monopoly on virtue?), that some of it is bad music and some of it is oppressive? Wouldn’t ‘comity,’ or at least genuine engagement, include challenging or differing from other citizens and critics? And why would ‘comity’ be putting similar albums on a list, as opposed to singles and tracks?” After all, obviously, plenty of artists these days don’t even appear on albums.\n\nAnd why should “comity” necessarily mean listening to and deciding among the same the same A-list artists as all the other critics, much less non-critics — “When looking at other people’s lists, seems to me that ‘comity’ could be/would be looking for the idiosyncratic stuff more than at the big names – I mean, if I want to get to know someone’s taste.” Frank points out. “Anyway, I feel similar enough to Xgau in sensibility and goals and visceral makeup to assume that none of these questions are ones he hasn’t thought of himself, but I’m wondering why his own wrestling with them doesn’t inform his year-end commentary.” Finally: “To get all Richard Rorty on you, what can pull us together as intellectuals* (the spaghetti** part of Contingency, Irony, and Spaghetti) isn’t having the same set of songs, or a common set of texts, or the same God, or the same ten commandments, or a supposed common procedure for knowing supposedly objective supposed reality, etc. etc., but a commitment to getting to know one another.” (“*Not to mention as people **Okay, solidarity.”)\n\nIf anything, with thousands upon thousands of releases out there to choose from, I’ve always tended to be suspicious that critics’ year-end lists wind up intersecting even as much as they do — It implies laziness to me, or follow-the-leader, or lack of curiosity, none of which sins I’m entirely immune to myself. Getting ready to close the door on 2022 by finalizing a list I’ve been publicly tinkering with here since September, I’ll confess that recommendations of other human beings, critics included (Kogan and Christgau included!) do indeed inspire me to listen to albums that wind up among my favorites per annum. Which again, is no less evidence of “comity” than if I liked Beyoncé’s Dean’s List #2 Renaissance half as much as the Chicago house music and Giorgio Moroder/Donna Summer records it plays blatant tribute to. (As is, I’d probably rank her 2022 album, Kendrick Lamar’s and Rosalía’s in the B-to-low-B+ range, Big Thief’s Dean’s List #3 so-what college folk-rock closer to C-. If I heard Alvvays, I must not’ve paid attention.)\n\nOne thing I can say for sure is that I’ve never loved anywhere near as much music from (mostly but not entirely sub-Saharan) Africa as I did in 2022 — four albums in my top 10, four more in my top 20, several more in the top half of 120 including immigrants to the US, UK, and Canada. Indigenous America, indigenous Australia, the Middle East and Brazil are also prominently represented. And there’s plenty of jazz, though that’s hardly without precedent from me in recent years.\n\nMetal, too — though not in the top 30, where SpellBook alone just barely squeak in. And a notable number of both metal bands (Neptune Power Federation, Sonja, Tower, Messa) and metal-adjacent bands (Goat, Coughin’ Vicars, Mysterines) are co-ed. Tallying women and frequently foreign-born people of color populating Rolling Stone and Pitchfork lists, Christgau risks great-replacement-theory accusations by declaring “there are way too many white guys left in the world for their musical ‘future’ to be quite that scant”; no doubt he’s right, but white males, especially young ones, aren’t exactly logjamming my own list, either. Allowing for the Dean’s “minor errors and categorical quibbles inevitable,” under 60 (I’m 62 myself) and in the top 75, I see just Bright Dog Red (on their fifth album), Deca (tenth), SpellBook (second), One More Grain (fourth in 16 years), maybe Oneida (somewhere between 15th and 20th), Tomasz Dabrowski (fifth or sixth), probably Black Space Riders (seventh), and Yard Act (first.) Which is to say the second highest newish white boys place 63rd.\n\nSeveral more shake out between 76 and 120, so they’re absolutely out there. But just because I’m crazy enough to stretch my list to 120 albums (and/or EPs) doesn’t mean I don’t know those placements make them, let’s say, somewhat marginal. 89-year-old Willie Nelson’s Dean’s List #4 A Beautiful Time, it pains me to say, also wound up way down there in Margin Land (sorry, but even here in Austin, most of the songs just weren’t special enough to outlast the initial throat-lumps of their approaching-life’s-end concept.) But like Christgau’s, and evidently unlike Rolling Stone‘s and Pitchfork‘s, my list is well-stocked with senior citizens and other oldsters standin’ on the verge: Kahil El’Zabar 69 as of New Year’s Eve, David Murray 67, Sun Ra Arkestra led by Marshall Allen 98, Allen Ravenstine 72, Hieroglyphic Being 50, David Krakauer 66, Theo Parrish 51, Voivod average age 54 not counting a newish bassist, Oliver Lake 80, Louis Sclavis 69, Tim Berne 68, Metrolight featuring two probably mid-50s-ish Death of Samantha alumni, Brötzmann Graves Parker average age 77 if William Graves hadn’t died at 79 in 2021, Nightingales led by Robert Lloyd 62, J.D. Allen 50, Trouble frontman Eric Wagner dead at 62 in 2021, Jesters Of Destiny led by Bruce Duff 67, Young Gods led by Franz Treichler 61.\n\nEven if I missed a couple, which wouldn’t surprise me, that’s quite a rollcall. That it’s entirely male bugs me a little, especially given the gender differential in life expectancy; that the album I almost definitely heard the most this year, Flesh of My Flesh by my 53-year-old spouse and 14-year-old daughter’s duo the Mothermold, was disqualified for conflict of interest reasons since I’m the roadie and cameraman (cool cover photo, no?) doesn’t let me off the hook. Nor that Lady Wray is 43 and Iara Rennó 45. But that most of the women on my list — four (plus one-third of Phelimuncasi) in my top 10; no-boys post-post-punk bands Bas Jan, Horsegirl, Panic Shack, Wet Leg, Arre! Arre! in my top 40; 10 or so country divas further down; etc. — are under 40 (at least four country divas just barely) probably only means the future is female. Fine with me, as long as females in the future’s driver’s seat aren’t Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, Kari Lake, Kristi Noem, Kellyane Conway, Ginni Thomas, Giorgia Meloni and Moms For Liberty.\n\nWhich brings us back to our fraught historical juncture, and why which albums are better than which other albums is just about the last thing we should spend our time arguing over that this point. Which, again, doesn’t mean we need to agree about them, either. Diversity rules! All I know is that I probably listened and re-listened to the albums below more than my favorite albums from any year in recent memory — mostly on shuffle at first, then eventually from beginning to end if I liked them enough. I can’t guarantee anybody else will love them, but that’s not what I’m here for. And who knows? Somebody else might."
