        "text": "Others wrote more beautiful things — tweets, posts, notes on the fly, via text, on our Flyboy, Greg Tate. Track it all down. Get to know him that way first, then read his books, and articles if you can find them.\n\nI met Greg years ago though I can’t count him as a close or distant friend. Greg Tate knew and was respected by a multitude of people and artists. When his Village Voice columns began to circulate, and then his book, Flyboy in Buttermilk most of us carried the book around in our bags everywhere.\n\nI am a poet so naturally reading Greg Tate made sense. I knew his brother, Brian Tate, a musician as well, slightly better but both of them were edgy. Cutting edge. Free.\n\nThey got that edge from their parents (Florence and Charles E. Tate), and this made me understand Greg’s writings and life. His parents were civil rights activists from Dayton. They were in double deep in the struggle of Black self-determination. When Florence was doing cultural work in Washington D.C., I got to know her best, luckily.\n\nSo losing another member of the Tate fam is a big deal from where I stand. Their family, shall we say, stood (and stands) for something, and they stood (and stand) firm, in Babylon, so to speak.\n\nI have spent the day looking for Greg’s words, via interviews. I was lucky to find some. If you want to find out why he was so dope and fly a writer, track down his many writings, especially, Flyboy in Buttermilk, the timeless classic.\n\nHere is Tate from 2013 as interviewed by Camilla Goodson in Callaloo, an African American cultural journal:"
