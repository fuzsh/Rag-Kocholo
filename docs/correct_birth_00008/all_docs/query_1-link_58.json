        "text": "[A] Please do not take too literally thoughts I had churning out an all-nighter, one of my very first Voice columns as I recall, at a time when few were aware that the Kinks did anything worth their while after \"You Really Got Me,\" the divine \"Waterloo Sunset\" included. In late March when I was writing I greatly admired and probably overrated Village Green. On the other hand, they were the first band I saw live--in Detroit, with a woman I remember warmly who had almost no idea who they were--after breaking up with Ellen Willis, and as I recall were fun enough although I was in no condition to judge. As for Something Else, I only own it on vinyl and doubt I've played it in 50 years, though I also would guess I'd enjoy it if I ever did. You obviously love the Kinks and have every right to, although I found most of their post-'73 output pretty wan (as I recalled and then double-checked in the first CG book). For me they were a pretty darn good band for seven-eight years who wrote one of the most beautiful songs in the English language. Were a guest to request them I'd pull something out, vinyl perhaps included.\n\n[Q] I'm interested in knowing more about the symbiosis between what you may call a \"biographical correlation\" and the actual musical quality of a record. Do boring correlations dim its effect and dull its sonic innovations? Do forgettable melodies and an overall lack of refinement, vigor, or humor decrease your interest in the person or persona behind them? And knowing very well that persona could be a false reflection of the person, whether by deception or projection, how do you make sure that these correlations still matter, even when they're falsities? Furthermore, I'm curious to know if you read a novel I sent you almost two years ago when I had a fan fever during the pandemic and squarely decided upon it as a suitable birthday gift, steered by your adoration for the American naturalist novel Sister Carrie and knowledge of Bohemia. I was so affected by it, yet dismayed at how many people perceive the Goncourt Brothers as undercooked Zolas. -- Omar Qutteineh, Amman, Jordan\n\n[A] There probably is such an artist, but that's exactly the kind of personal factoid you can't pick out of thin air. You have to trip over it as you pursue a related matter. I sat here musing for a few minutes and got nowhere. Dinah Washington, whose '76 vinyl twofer I once recommended in passing, might be worth a shot. As for one-offs, you could say Have Moicy! Doesn't really count but I say it does. Hoboken Saturday Night is a good one (and also not truly a one-off), but not in that league. Less fun, but you could put Hanging Tree Guitars on the short list too. And now I'll stop before I sprain my brain.\n\n[Q] Inspired by their representation in the Consumer Guide and my dedicated and repeated listens to every recommended album I could find, I have solidified my top 10 favorite instrumental jazz artists. \"Representation\" entails that these artists garnered the most reviews in the CG, and earned (many) high marks. Specifically, there are eight non-vocal jazz artists in the CG that qualify. I rounded it to ten for neatness: I searched the A+ thru A- databases to declare Art Blakey as the most deserving of the ninth entry--placing above David Murray for 8th--and added my own sentimental/childhood favorite, Vince Guaraldi, for the tenth.\n\nSonny Rollins\n\nThelonious Monk\n\nCharlie Parker\n\nOrnette Coleman\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nJames Carter\n\nMiles Davis\n\nArt Blakey\n\nDavid Murray\n\nVince Guaraldi\n\nQuick follow up: I have an extensive Louis Armstrong collection. I omitted him from the list because I consider him a \"hybrid.\" LA is among my top 20 favorite artists on a list paradoxical to the one sent. -- Adam S. Fenton, Menifee, California\n\n[Q] Hi, Bob. Hope you and Carola are doing well. I need your advice. It's becoming more difficult to get into (or even keep up with) pop music these days. For whatever reason, things just aren't clicking as fast and intense for me as they used to. There are exceptions, obviously. Olivia Rodrigo scratches the itch every time. By and large however, I feel mentally fatigued and ambivalent about a lot of new tunes I hear regardless of genre. These feelings started about a year ago, but have only gotten stronger. At 35, I know I've aged out of a large chunk of the pop demographic. But I don't want to lose touch. Music enriches my life too much for me to just give up on it and retire to the tunes of yesterday. Nostalgia is a no-go for me. How do I get out of this rut? -- Jon LaFollette, Speedway, Indiana\n\n[A] Generalizing about The State Of Pop Music is a fool's game I have no desire to play, but it's definitely the case that (a) people do sometimes just lose their taste for the new stuff and (b) that it evolves for a multiplicity of economic, sociopolitical, and technological reasons. What I certainly am willing to say is that if I'm a crucial source of guidance for you and some of my recent enthusiasms aren't ringing your chimes for one reason or another, maybe I've just outlived my usefulness for you. Owning thousands of albums and spending as much time with my music-loving wife as I do, I can certainly say that playing Arto Lindsay's Mundo Civilizado certainly made breakfast feel like a feast yesterday morning and that I'll probably be digging out a less certain pick soon. Then there's one more thing: jazz. I'd bet plenty that there are lots of jazz artists you barely know at all. Explore that avenue for a while. Spotify makes it so easy, but buying a few likely-sounding CDs would be even better.\n\n[Q] Your name popped up a few times in the last couple of days (mid-June, 2024) in the various obits for late no-wave skronker James Chance, most if not all due to the altercation between the two of you back in the late '70s--referred to variously as fisticuffs, a violent assault, overblown, among other descriptors. I was wondering if seeing your name alongside his brought up any memories or thoughts of the time, his impact or lack thereof, etc. He's before my time though I'm at least cursorily familiar with his work--I went back and read your reviews of his output, which all seem to be from after said incident. Was it difficult to be objective after such an interaction? It's certainly a bit more visceral than say, Lou Reed calling you a toefucker onstage. -- Adam, Arlington, Massachusetts\n\n[A] I didn't know Chance or whatever we are to call him had died until I received your query, but for sure much worse people have lived to 71, like for instance Donald Trump. When I was first aware of Chance, decades ago now, I thought he was a jerk as a person but a not altogether uninteresting musician, as in this review: \"Bohemias are always beset by ambitious neurotics who hawk their obnoxious afflictions as if they're the future of the species, which is why in theory James White's music is better without the words: you get the jagged rhythms and tonic off-harmonies without being distracted by his 'ideas.' But in fact the music is so (deliberately) stunted it needs a voice for sonic muscle, and James's lyrics do have a certain petty honesty and jerk-off humor. 'I Don't Want to Be Happy' should separate the believers from the spectators quite nicely. B+\" (Yes, Chance did sometimes call himself \"White.\") But I am sorry I have to go into the Artists Space incident yet again, which I once did when Thurston Moore was writing a book he never sent me when it was published. For sure no blood was involved no matter what it says in Bernard Gendron's From Montmartre to the Mudd Club. Anyway, it happened at a nonprofit-I-think downtown spot called Artists Space where my then-young friend Perry Brandston was doing the sound, with his stepfather Bob Stanley and mother Marylin Herzka, both very close friends and both now deceased, in attendance. One \"cool\" thing Chance liked to do was stride or clamber out into the audience and hit people--not hard, he was a shrimp, just annoying taps. But when he chose Marylin as one of his targets, Bob Stanley, an excellent painter with zero tolerance for \"avant-garde\" BS, waded onto the floor and to the rescue until, as I recall it, whatever passed for security goons at Artists Space pulled him off. Whereupon I entered the fray, which is to say I sat on Chance until I in turn was either pulled off or persuaded to desist. So to repeat: despite what Gendron reports third-hand, no blood was shed.\n\n[A] Sorry, but you just asked me to do three-four days of work--part of my secret as a critic is that I don't jump to conclusions. But I can tell you that The Immortal Otis Redding has been an all-time favorite of mine for more than half a century and I still remember returning to King and Queen with great pleasure a few years ago. And should you choose to make the effort, which if you're so interested you probably should, check out my site, where several other Otis albums are graded and others listed in a complimentary way.\n\n[A] \"Clinically depressed\" is a diagnosis I've most likely evaded, but that doesn't mean I've never been blue for a substantial period, in what seems to categorized as situational depression. I write about it in detail in the college chapter of Going Into the City. Two factors pertained: one, my loss of the born-again Christian faith that promised me eternal life, and two, my growing hunch that the only girlfriend I'd ever had (and also, although I didn't know it at the time really, quite a catch--many of my male high school classmates liked her too, yet somehow the Christian nerd and youngest member of his class won her heart) wasn't quite the perfect creature I'd initially believed her to be. So for two years at all-male Dartmouth I walked around with a knot of romantic disillusion and existential anxiety cramping my gut. I literally could not take a deep breath. Only then one day early in my junior year I took a breath and it went all the way down. A big relief. I continued to suffer from both existential uncertainty and romantic disillusion. But I was over the worst of it. I finally broke up with my gf a few months after I graduated, and I was right. But I have no doubt she deserved better than I found myself able to give her.\n\n[Q] On October 18, you tweeted a defense of Israel citing a well written piece which postulated that the hospital bombing committed one week after 10/7 was actually not committed by Israel. You stated that prior to this evidence, you were \"profoundly disturbed\" that such a thing could happen. So now here we are, over half a year later, after tens of thousands of deaths and countless hospital bombings which have all undeniably been committed by Israel--and you haven't said a single word? It's one thing for you to have stayed quiet on the issue completely, but you only speak up when Israel can be protected? Bob, what is wrong with you? How are you not profoundly disturbed as the death toll of innocent civilians reaches nearly 40,000 with no clear end in sight? The last thing I ever expected from my decades of following your works was for you to be so spineless. I refuse to believe you only actively stand for something when the narrative suits your desires. -- Brandon Sparks, America\n\n[A] Anyone but a genuine expert who writes about the appalling Gaza war risks being incomplete and probably wrong. I cited that hospital bombing story because that early there seemed some reason for hope that the war would resolve itself with a modicum of sanity. It wasn't yet clear just how appalling Netanyahu would prove to be--or, I will add with my hands shaking, Hamas either. The \"lots\" I know is too little and in public at least I intend to say as little as possible. I've long believed in a two-state solution and this war is easily the cruelest and most gruesome international conflict of my adulthood. But it hasn't yet turned me into a full-bore anti-Zionist, because as an American of German extraction with many dozens of Jewish friends, I've spent too much of my life taking anti-Semitism seriously to put it on any sort of back burner now.\n\n[A] Of course a schlocky band can come up with a first-rate song. I love that soundtrack--it's among my most-played albums even though it never came out as a physical. So I hereby recommend it to anyone who's never heard it, and yes, the movie is also terrific. Lady Antebellum benefited enormously in this context by providing the soundtrack with its title song. They also distinguished themselves by changing their name to Lady A in 2020 after being bombarded with criticism for the pro-Civil War implications of their name. Shortly thereafter (Wikipedia's is a good source on the details) they found themselves in a lengthy dispute with a Black blues singer yclept Lady A, legal name Anita White. Sampling White's top five blues/bluesy songs on Spotify, she's actually damn good--in my opinion better by far than Lady Antebellum/Lady A the country warhorses.\n\n[Q] I was wondering as to your thoughts on the question of whether \"problematic\" lyrics can actually enhance the quality of a song. I love a lot of the pre-war Delta blues, but a majority of those songs have questionable lyrics when it comes to male/female relations. But for some reason the violence and sexism, are to me integral to the songs' quality. Perhaps this is because blues often has an eerie or desolate atmosphere which fit such lyrics. On the other hand, I am put off by a lot of hip hop for its use of \"bitch\" and its casual violence towards women. Even though hip hop at times boasts a similar atmosphere as blues. At the end of your review of the debut Ramones album you make the statement: \"This makes me uneasy. But my theory has always been that good rock and roll should damn well make you uneasy.\" You use \"Midnight Rambler\" as example of a good kind of uneasy. Yet you draw the line, understandably, at \"Brown Sugar.\" How do we make these distinctions? -- Bojan, Leerdam, The Netherlands\n\n[A] I have no doubt that my Christian upbringing played an active role in shaping my humanism. \"Love thy neighbor\" was definitely a watchword at First Pres even if not all the parishioners lived by it. Also, my church library was one of the first places I found books about ideas, and I read several of them, which helped make me an intellectual, though I always preferred both fIction and books about baseball. But given the extent to which the leftist humanism of dozens upon dozens of my Jewish friends moved me in that direction, I identify more with that strain of secular humanism. As for the name \"Christgau,\" there's a Danish brand of coffee called Christgau--an empty bag of it hangs from my office door. Then again, so does the remains of an envelope addressed to Rabbi Robert T. Christgau. In either German or Danish or maybe both the suffix \"gau\" seems to mean something like region or county, and I seem to recall that under Hitler certain states or geopolitical entities were called \"gaus.\"\n\n[A] An entire chapter of my memoir, Going Into the City, is about Dartmouth, and I assume you would find it enlightening. In NYC I was only allowed to apply to three colleges plus a CUNY, and I no longer remember whether Cornell and Hamilton wanted me, but Dartmouth gave me a scholarship, maybe because I had a great-uncle who attended on a football scholarship, didn't graduate (blew a knee, for one thing), then became an alumni association heavy of some sort; he was also a drunk who was run over by a bus in Cooper Square a few blocks from where I've resided for half a century. So he might have helped. In addition my College Boards were off the charts though my high school grades weren't, and math chairman although not-yet-prexy John Kemeny called me in to bawl me out for choosing the \"gut' Math 3-6 option instead of Math 1-2 because it was the easiest \"science\" \"sequence\" and all I wanted to do was study literature and philosophy, which I then did for four years. My grade average was good-not-great because I have no knack for foreign languages--cum laude and Phi Bet but not by much. But I absorbed a lot of literature and philosophy there and made a few lifelong friends in English Honors and on the fringes of what passed as the undergraduate bohemia. I was the youngest member of my class.\n\n[Q] A couple of years back I was going through a Vampire Weekend phase propelled partly by your writings. During such time I came across young Ezra's blogspot page titled Internet Vibes, in which he aimed to \"categorize as many vibes as [he] can.\" The web page offers plenty of insight into the young man's character, his humor and quirks, his musical and intellectual inquietudes--and it did turn me on to some interesting music. On October 12, 2005, he posted \"CRITICAL BEATDOWN,\" defending Billy Joel's music and sensibility against your judgements, going through some of your Piano Man reviews, and concluding that you are a \"1-ST CLASS POSEUR,\" a \"CLASSIC TYPE-A HATER,\" and that \"GRADING ALBUMS like HOMEWORK is LAME,\" amongst other reflections about criticism in general. No antagonizing intended, I just wondered if you were ever aware of this, and about your view of Ezra's maturation and development as a songwriter, human, etc. which I understand seeps as subject of your reviews of his. -- Ignacio Nuez, Santiago, Chile\n\n[A] We have similar tastes. Doing a best of '68 list would be a week's work I am reluctant to undertake, but I can say that the only album on the list I think of as way overrated is Cream's Wheels of Fire and a replay might conceivably change that (and I'm not a big fan of Jefferson Airplane's Crown of Creation either). But the only ones I'm pretty sure I've played for pleasure or something like it--usually what I'll call unnecessary research comparison--since say 2015 are, in guesswork descending order: Cheap Thrills, Beggars Banquet, Electric Ladyland, The White Album, At Folsom Prison, and conceivably Songs of Leonard Cohen. Not sure I own or therefore know In the Groove. (Motown didn't mail out review copies back then.)"
