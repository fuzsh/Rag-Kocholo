First is a subset of the full-fledged autobiography: I Am a Big Deal and This Happened to Me. Second is a specialty of hangers-on, who home in on a single personage, and journalists, who spread themselves around: Fame: An Inside View. Third is the song of the unsung hero: My Adventure. Number four became a growth sector as fiction and confessional veered into one of their half-assed affairs: My Battle with (and Triumph Over!) Dysfunction.\n\nIt’s absolutely possible to work up a fine book from any of these templates. But none of them is for me. I’m a rock critic for Chrissake, only a teensy bit famous no matter how much of my small pond I hog, who decided early on that intimacy with the truly famous would mess up his response mechanisms and analytic equilibrium. Between my hitchhiking miles and my slum apartments, I’ve had my share of adventures, but nothing all that spine-chilling or at all epic. I’ve never overdone drugs or alcohol. Although I write more about fucking than some think appropriate, the nearest I come to a sexual kink is how healthy my appetite is. And although my rebellion against my parents’ values was painful and decisive, I was never anything like abused or neglected. As writers go, I’m a fairly normal guy.\n\nSome might hold that if my life has been interesting enough to write about, it cannot have been normal. As a democrat in all things, I say that’s snobbish baloney. All lives are interesting—how interesting depends on the telling. To choose a single example from my favorite art form, consider John Prine’s Donald and Lydia, in which a fat arcade cashier and a buzzcut PFC dream all too separately of a sexual bliss Donald tries his hand at in the latrine. These lost kids wouldn’t be much fun at a party. But their story is riveting, and all I can say to anyone ill-informed enough to argue that that’s because their lives are abnormally sad is, If only. It’s probably truer that my own life has been abnormally happy. But since I know many others who enjoy their work and cherish their spouses, I’d postulate instead that Prine’s tale and mine both fall within normal range. Like most people, I grew up by resolving conflicts and overcoming difficulties less gothic than the dysfunction-hawking norm. What’s abnormal about me is every good critic’s stock in trade—my sensibility, honed by the excess of thought I’ve put into my history, my values, and my prose. My zeal at pursuing the fundamental human task of incremental growth is the main reason I get to peddle my ideas about popular music. And it’s also why I get to publish a memoir.\n\nRight, I’m the Dean of American Rock Critics. I was present at the creation of an influential strain of cultural discourse that some believe presaged postmodernism, if that’s a selling point. Without half trying, I’ve met more famous people than Donald or Lydia could dream. Trying with all my might, I’ve reviewed more record albums than most people could stand. I’m a renowned editor and respected teacher who’s published millions of words and five books. All these accomplishments pack enough intrinsic interest to generate some stories worth repeating and some ideas worth hammering home. The informed celebration of popular culture has been a mission for me, and a memoir is a great place to evangelize about it. It’s also the perfect place to expand on the theoretical differences that separate me from my compeers old and young. And of course, it’s where I get to put some backstory into those values I put so much thought into.\n\nBut I’m more normal than the strange job I made up for myself. My life paralleled a lot of American lives before the Janus-headed quants of the banking and computer industries worked their more-is-less wham-jam on the national weal. It was the explosion of popular culture as both biz and way of art that made rock criticism inevitable, not vice versa. Plenty of baby boomers swam against the suburban tide to reclaim the urban center and then gentrify it past the tipping point. Plenty busted out of the born-again straitjacket like Hugh Hefner and Martin Luther King before them. And plenty found the meaning of their lives in an eros that endures. One of the secrets of rock criticism is that all of us were well-situated to get on top of these cultural developments sensibility-wise, and I in particular had quite the leg up. Not only did my urban journey suit a music whose first major history was called The Sound of the City, my religious angst suited a music invented mostly by restless Christians. So did a 1942 birth date that made me a little younger than the rock and roll artists who lit up the ’50s and a little older than the boomers who stormed the ’60s.\n\nBut let me get on my soapbox here. This being American popular music, race greatly complicates the story. Crucial though it was that the cities Charlie Gillett praised were centers of commerce and hot-beds of hippiedom, the post-Great Migration demography in which the term urban music would become a polite way to signify black music was much more to the point. Most of the white Christians who jump-started rock and roll were Southerners hell-bent on the sin and salvation they equated with the music cannonading out of the new black radio stations. Most of their black Christian counterparts adapted gospel usages that put a big fat extra layer of African retention on rock and roll’s all too fifty-fifty blues-meets-country origin myth. And while African-American baby boomers were buoyed somewhat by the so-called affluent society, capitalism cheated them so callously that they conceived themselves as the black power generation instead.\n\nRomantic marriage—a possibility first explored by the original Romantics that’s run parallel to free love in twentieth-century bohemia and proved the preferred domestic arrangement of the ’60s counterculture and its children—plays an even larger role in this book than the church and the city. But at first it was a clumsier fit with rock and roll. Shortsightedly, early rock criticism was so busy kicking out the sociosexual jams that it scorned what was called moon-June-spoon sentimentality, and love songs along numb-come-yum or crave-brave-save lines are tricky to bring off even today. Nevertheless, rock generated Our Songs that knew something about love from the beginning—to limit myself to a mere half dozen: Chuck Berry’s You Never Can Tell, the Lovin’ Spoonful’s Darling Be Home Soon, John Lennon’s Oh Yoko!, Bonnie Raitt’s Good Enough, Ashford & Simpson’s Is It Still Good to Ya, Marshall Crenshaw’s Monday Morning Rock. And as the music turned out, its mesh with romantic marriage was uncanny. Conceived for teenagers, rock was so fixated on the generation gap that it produced an unprecedented plethora of songs about getting older—and older. As it kept on coming, it demonstrated that a lifetime spent with your first true love was a less naive proposition than cynics claim.\n\nThe main way marriage impacted my vocation, however, was intellectually. That’s why I feel deprived when, for example, Christopher Hitchens or Ed Sanders or Richard Hell—all of whose recommended memoirs share ground with mine, and all of whom have their reasons—fail to indicate how their wives changed their lives and I bet their work. My ’60s partnership with Ellen Willis wasn’t a marriage—Ellen didn’t believe in marriage. But I pursued it as I would have a marriage. And since Ellen was both a rockcrit elder and a conceptual dynamo, she set me on the path I’ve followed ever since. But that path had more bumps and twists than she cared to map out, with me or anyone else. So instead my chief guide has been my legally wedded wife of four decades, Carola Dibbell, who’s also a fine rock critic when I can kid her into it. And in the end, her aesthetic ideas and perceptions enriched mine more decisively than Ellen’s shaped them. No banal bow to discretion or cool could tempt me to minimize the place of these relationships in my life, or to mince words about them either. They constituted an emotional education more action-packed than my professional progress, and more of a challenge too. Having found all too little writing with useful information to offer in this crucial matter, I’ve tried to provide a little myself. Till death do us part, my marriage is my most satisfying achievement.\n\nTo sum up, then: I Am Not a Big Deal and This Happened to Me Anyway. I hope my story is representative enough to engage readers with only marginal interest in my small claim to fame. But I’m also aware that it wouldn’t have come to market if I wasn’t some kind of deal—in particular, someone whose appetite for music fuels a knack for aesthetic response, conjecture, theory, and value judgment others find enlightening, useful, and good for a laugh. The biographical info serves to flesh out the critical work, and should—although I’ve edged away from the first person over the years, I certainly don’t abstain from it, and consider any critic who makes too big a show of objectivity a professional liar. I write what I’m proud to designate my journalism as a specific individual whose identity is out front, a thinking human being with all the contradictions, limitations, and biases mortality entails.\n\nSince I’m a critic, however, it had better also be true that works of art themselves have changed my life—otherwise, why bother? So I’ve paused the narrative occasionally to focus in on some music or a book or two very different pairs of poems or in one pivotal period a movie and a painting. Especially in my teens and early twenties, these were life-changers and then some—I spent years thinking about Crime and Punishment, Vacillation, Jules and Jim, and that Tom Wesselmann nude whose title I don’t even know—and the later books loom large for me too. All That Is Solid Melts into Air is a bible for a worldwide host of left-humanist intellectuals who will never delve that deep into Faust themselves, and Sister Carrie, The Man Who Loved Children, and Mumbo Jumbo all flout propriety with a boldness that frees their fans to ascribe just as much value to Plastic Ono Band, Marquee Moon, and Looking for the Perfect Beat. But because I love pop for its abundance most of all, I could have picked altogether different records—half a century of grading albums Consumer Guide-style has left me too aware of how much is out there to waste precious cred on pantheon construction. So having put myself in the historical mood by matching the music in my CD changer to the era I was writing about, I geared my critical interludes to what sounded good as I worked and meshed with the way the story was going.\n\nSome consider criticism parasitic, and I agree that it’s secondhand—it recycles the energy generated by humans who have made the most of the deep-seated human need to conjure something out of nothing, to add order and beauty to the inchoate world that radiates out from each of us. But in every culture some humans are better at this than others, and as cultures get more complex, the art they produce starts seeming pretty inchoate itself. So criticism conjures order and beauty from that. What sells it is sensibility—a brew of genre knowledge, general knowledge, aesthetic insight, moral passion, palpable delight, prose style, more prose style, and what-have-you. But always lurking in the background is judgment. Judge not, that ye be not judged, I was warned by Presbyterians who judged plenty themselves, and as the firstborn son of a father with an ego, I was inclined to do as they did, not as they said. Only then I made judgment a discipline, and by the time I’d reviewed two or three thousand albums—I’m at five times that now—I’d gotten pretty matter-of-fact about it. The trick is waiting for the music to come to you or finding out that it doesn’t, then resisting the temptation to fib about the process. This is more exciting work than is often assumed. But it’s also harder. To the eternal Opinions are like assholes—everybody’s got one, I just say, Yeah, but not everybody’s got ten thousand of them. It distresses me that the wit of this riposte so often fails to impress the asshole I’m talking to.\n\nI love narrative so much I originally aspired to write novels and then reportage; I love narrative so much I’ve written a memoir. But since I turned out to be a discursive kind of guy, it’s part of my brief to furnish an informed assessment of the critical genre I helped invent and the journalistic culture that made it possible. Hence I’ve incorporated many abstractions into my tale. Most of these are good English words that I explain in context or employ conventionally enough, but two demand extra elucidation. The first is contingency, a term I latched on to as an eighteen-year-old who’d abandoned his faith in Jesus Christ and finally found something else to believe in—namely, nothing, or was it everything, or maybe what the anti-Christian Nietzsche called the transvaluation of all values, only he meant something different (because while I agreed and in fact still agree that joy is more moral than pity, I was never quite callow or callous enough to reject compassion per se the way Nietzsche did to get a rise out of us and Ayn Rand did to get laid. That’s why I became a leftist when I grew up, and remain one). I explain contingency three different ways: once in the college chapter, once in the ’60s chapter, once in the Voice chapter. That more or less gets it—finalizing the idea would betray its spirit. Nuff said? In a contingent world, mais oui.\n\nThe other abstraction at issue is theory of pop, which as I’ve noted in the introductions to each of my previous non-Consumer Guide books was never a theory at all, although Willis and I called it that in conversation and might have formulated a real one had we stayed together. Here’s how I put it in 1997: I worked from a ‘theory’ of pop that was more an elaborate hunch. In essence it asserted the aesthetic and political equality of not just ‘folk,’ not just ‘popular,’ but crass and abject ‘mass’ culture. Naive, defensive, and/or self-evident although the point may now seem, it felt essential in a reflexively hierarchical cultural environment to argue that rock and roll was ‘art’ every bit as worthy as the English lit of my baccalaureate and the jazz, classical, and folk to which it was invidiously compared. And as I went on in 2000: These hunches, which I shared with hundreds of thousands of contemporaries who never got them into print, have had a strange history. There’s a sense in which they now enjoy more currency in academia, where they inform the cultural studies movement, than in rock criticism, where the old anti-‘commercial’ tendencies mocked throughout this book have been bulked up into a worldview by the runaway growth of what I call semipopular music. (Oh yeah, semipopular music. Er, music more popular in form than in market share. At least when it starts out. Under the rubric alternative, now also an established image-making strategy that informs many of the brands ambitious young musicians concoct for themselves. Stubbornly, I believe semipopular music can be bigger and better than such strategies and also more perverse and ironic.)\n\nI should also mention that in this century, confusingly in my opinion, the term pop has been absorbed by the anti-rockism debate that began in Britain shortly before Going into the City ends. From the beginning I found this kerfuffle asinine, mostly because I’d always thought rock was pop. But under the terminological circumstances I’d best emphasize that the concept of pop was not a major rock-critical preoccupation in the ’60s. Instead, even those of us who cared about pop focused on an amorphous counterculture with which all rock critics identified, usually from the margins. To a person we celebrated and critiqued the vagaries of hippies, radicals, space cadets, weekend potheads, and under-assistant West Coast promo men as reflected in the art form that fed their heads. In an America where most rock musicians of any status had been folk musicians not long before, rock criticism was soon dominated institutionally by simplistic folkie notions of authenticity and the folkie assumption that the music business was bad until proven otherwise and probably after. The term rock, as opposed to both pop and rock and roll, became a metonym for this counterculture.\n\nWillis and I didn’t think it was so simple, especially since we didn’t regard commercial as a self-evident insult. The mere fact that the theory of pop we failed to finalize was pro-commercial set us apart—especially since we were also unusually explicit about our political proclivities. But as Creem came along to challenge Rolling Stone and the alt-weeklies sorted themselves out, we picked up allies—although by then we weren’t a we, with Willis devoting her theoretical energies to the women’s movement while I parceled out letter grades as the Dean of American Rock Critics. Pop didn’t work out as well as we’d hoped, that’s for sure. But as cynical reactionary moneybags launched a counterattack on idealistic counterculture lazybones that necessitated, among other vile maneuvers, new degrees of corporate integration in the culture industry itself, our political fantasies worked out even worse. That was the real problem.\n\nWith a little noodging from my friends, I decided I had a memoir to write in 2007, the year after I was offed by the Arizonans who’d overrun New York’s self-proclaimed weekly newspaper. But since I lacked both a raconteur’s comprehensive recall and a raconteur’s willingness to make shit up, I knew my memoir wasn’t going to be written from memory except in the most general way, especially given how much bildungsroman there’d be in it. Once I bore down, buried details from fifty and sixty years back did rise to the surface, and I had already told some stories many times. But so as not to make shit up, I imposed guidelines. Most important, I kept dialogue to a minimum. In a few cases—I don’t even care if she’s Jewish, I was just thinking about you—I’m as positive as can be that the wording is precise, and even that doesn’t mean I’m right. But at the very least I’m sure that what little quoted speech I retained for pace or drama meets the accepted journalistic standard of scrupulous good-faith approximation. In addition I double-checked key exchanges and nailed down stray details whenever the relevant principal was alive and findable, interviewing dear friends and people I hadn’t conversed with in half a century. Sometimes they had no memory of the incident that meant so much to me, and sometimes they concurred with my account. But in some cases they corrected me on matters large and small and almost always they provided context I had forgotten or never known. I should also add that I respect discretion enough to have changed a few names, although not many.\n\nIn addition to rereading many touchstone books, I delved into auxiliary history (special thanks to Chris Miller on Dartmouth, Alice Echols on the women’s movement, the tendentious but thorough Kevin Michael McAuliffe on the Voice, and a search engine that will remain nameless on matters large and small). My published journalism provided recollections, facts, and the occasional scrap of language, as did my unpublished journalism. My old friend Larry Dietz lent me his complete bound Cheetah. Notebooks from my early twenties were essential to the chapter called American Studies. And I read a lot of my own letters—to Ellen Willis and Greil Marcus and my parents and my college girlfriend and my well-organized Dartmouth classmate Bill Hjortsberg (who’d prefer that I and probably you call him Gatz). I also examined letters from all these people and many more. The college correspondence alone took me two weeks to plow through, and provided a major chunk of that chapter’s material—most decisively as regards my callow and clumsy romantic progress, malfeasance, and travail. And that requires more exegesis.\n\nAs indicated, I first conceptualized my life by isolating the four themes adduced above: religion, popular culture, romantic marriage, and going into the city itself. But schemas seldom work out as planned. Going into the city proved more substratum than theme, and religion, while formative, faded from my story not too long after it faded from my life. Popular culture as concept and content, on the other hand, has been my intellectual reason for being, nourishing almost everything I write and in my backpack whenever I foray into such territory as Jimmy Carter, yogurt, or banksta crap. And of course, the pursuit of romantic marriage has proven equally foundational.\n\nI don’t mean just emotionally or intellectually in the way already described, although this is where I should report that the recall of the storyteller I married is all over the final third of a book I decided to end with our hard-gained parenthood. I mean that the emotional growth was also intellectual growth, and that this is especially true insofar as sensibility is intellectual. Both my emotional capacities and my critical acuities were shaped and enlarged not just by Ellen but by my college sweetheart and several other women I cared for. But all of us still had a lot to learn, and the marriage proper dwarfed all the earlier love and growth that made it possible. The therapeutically correct thing to say now is that Carola and I have a lot to learn even so—that the process is never-ending. And in the sense that life starts changing as fast when you’re eighty-five as when you’re fifteen, that’s all too true. But only in that sense. How far we’ve come right now is our joy, our pride, and the reason I ended up writing so effusively about my rather vanilla love life. OK, maybe it was just the excuse. I do think the stories are pretty good.\n\nSince I’m hardly self-effacing in print, my regular readers get this. In the ’10s, when I got to know my fanbase via the commenting community generated by the Expert Witness iteration of the Consumer Guide, I wasn’t surprised to find that this self-selecting band of aging male music obsessives—a type whose male chauvinism goes back to the blues boys of the ’60s—were a lot more into their wives than demography would predict. They too know the intellectual and aesthetic benefits of the uxorious way of knowledge—the way it compels you to understand, enjoy, and occasionally adore at a higher level of empathy and intensity. There are other ways to gain such listening skills, of course. But the self-renewing enthusiasm of my marital relationship obviously has its correlative in my continuing musical engagement. That’s why I think romantic marriage is so suitable for rock critics like me—and her. In the manner of the musicians we love, we’re just trying to carve out some room, explore a few ideas, and have a little fun without ever lying about what feels truest to us. We’re inspired by these artists’ all-out emotion and all-in turns of phrase, their sweet sincerity and ungodly jokes, their starry eyes and reluctant compromises and normality and determination to go on. I’ve spent my life trying to pass those truths on.\n\nOne of my favorite rock and roll songs ever is Jessie Hill’s Ooh Poo Pah Doo, a 1960 hit I first heard or maybe just noticed on a reissue that came in the mail in 1986. That kind of belated discovery happens to critics more than it does to almost anybody, and in this case it helped that the critic in question had taken it upon himself to dance his one-year-old daughter to sleep every night—finally a girl who could follow his lead! Hill’s record is famous for its title and beloved for its groove, as it should be. But its genius moment is a single climactic line: I won’t stop tryin’ till I create a disturbance in your mind.\n\nMe neither.\n\n1\n\nTHE EIGHTY-HOUR WEEK\n\nIn my Manhattan dining room hangs a framed enlargement of a family snapshot my dad inscribed Asbury Aug. ’40. Let’s guess it was taken Saturday, August 3, the day after laughing Virginia’s twenty-third birthday. She’s my mom and quite a looker: curly brown hair surrounding a heart-shaped face with a bow mouth and big brown eyes. Gamely she stands midair on a platform of crossed arms provided by her lean and beaming blue-eyed George, still a fair-haired boy at twenty-four, and a beer-gutted, pipe-clenching older guy believed to be the mysterious Uncle Wally. A slighter and swarthier figure of a man peers around his athletic son-in-law while steadying his daughter from behind: my beloved grandfather Tom Snyder, cherishing his sole offspring as always and as always enjoying whatever entertainment comes his way. Dad wears trim trunks, Mom a fetching one-piece. From the canopied boardwalk in the background, three well-dressed elders smile down upon the fun.\n\nA lifetime later, my parents’ sexiness in this photo still awes me. They look like they’re having one of those perfect days nobody gets enough of. Thinking about it, I recognize that this reach for heaven is temporary and if you want to get technical about it an illusion. Sexually, as my father will confide when I’m twenty-four myself, the earth didn’t move for Virginia until two years after they started trying (which was, believe it, their wedding night). Historically, World War II is on its way to America, and although my father won’t join up, he’ll put in four years of eighty-hour weeks as a New York City fireman and continue to labor just as hard firefighting and moonlighting until he retires from the NYFD in 1961. Yet as a rock critic I refuse to deny the reality of that illusion.\n\nMy parents’ youthful aura isn’t an act—it springs from an innate vitality they’re making the most of. Married not quite a year after five years of putting it off, their imitation of teenagers in love is convincing because in love they remain. As the O’Jays put it in one of the many songs to have a go at the idea, these young marrieds are living for the weekend, achieving a liberation so fleeting some would hold it’s no liberation at all. But one aim of my vocation is to map such liberations, which for many Americans are the main thing the pursuit of happiness means. Because my parents settled just a few miles from where their not-so-distant ancestors got off the boat, they were a little less American geographically than their fellow Germans who migrated into the heartland. And by that token they were also more urbane, very much New Yorkers—luckily for me, highly intelligent ones. But even after they started subscribing to The New Yorker soi-même in the ’70s, they were never sophisticates. They still equated the pursuit of happiness with a day at the beach, although by then it was Robert Moses’s Jones in Nassau County rather than Bruce Springsteen’s Asbury Park on the Jersey Shore. I’ve put in many eighty-hour weeks thinking about all the things that might mean.\n\nFor as far back as our scant family lore goes, all the Christgaus and all the Snyders were New Yorkers. My surname is apparently Danish—there’s a snapshot of my globe-trotting maiden aunt Mildred in front of a Christgau Kaffe ad at a bus stop in Denmark to prove it. But my Christgau forebears were German—Schleswig-Holstein, my dad ventured. North German for sure. Protestant. My mom’s side were Snyders who arrived as Schneiders. South German for sure. Catholic. We assume both sides were first-wave immigrants. My father’s people still spoke a little German when I was a kid, and supposedly the first American Schneider was born on the boat in New York Harbor in 1860, though since he squeezed eleven kids in before Grandpa Tommy was born in 1888, maybe not. Tommy did like to tell stories.\n\nBoth families were from Ridgewood, on the Queens side of the Brooklyn-Queens border. When Clara Helmke married George Lawrence Christgau in 1908, they bought a brownstone off Fresh Pond Road that remained Christgau until Aunt Mildred moved to a senior residence in Flushing in 1995. The Snyders were more footloose; after my mom married, Williamsburg-raised Tommy led his Kitty even deeper into Queens—to a neat, upwardly mobile little apartment in Forest Hills, which he decorated by gluing photos clipped from Better Homes and Gardens to burlap-covered wood. The two clans were very different and very stereotypical—the North Germans stiff-necked, the South Germans fun-loving. My mother marveled that my dashing dad could have come out of that family. But don’t infer hostility there; my mother was an agreeable woman who kept her smarts sheathed. An only child, she brought her parents to Christmas with the Christgaus—Mom and Pop, they were called by their children and then their grandchildren—where Tommy’s presents were the main event. Sometimes he’d backbite coyly about how cheap the Christgaus were, and I’m sure they tsk-tsked over his spiked Manhattans, easy tears, and spendthrift ways. But such conflicts were muted and rare. These were placid, ordinary people.\n\nYet as I delve deeper I wonder how placid and ordinary they really were. Since I’m about to bombard you with a bunch of names that will disappear from my tale as fast as Uncle Wally’s, I’ll simplify things by organizing possible exceptions in the outline form I was taught in elementary school. I’m pretty sure this is the first time I’ve employed that tool in my professional writing career.\n\n1. Above all, intermarriage, in which my mom and dad had plenty of company. Protestants marrying Catholics may not seem like much in the twenty-first century, but in the early nineteen hundreds it was verboten—so much so that when Protestant only child Catherine Neu married Catholic letter carrier Thomas Snyder, her printer father fled New York, emigrating with her mother to San Francisco. Two of Tommy’s siblings married Protestants and converted, and one of their kids married a Catholic, and on the Christgau side my paternal great-grandfather Henry Christgau, who owned a bar on Spring Street off the Bowery, wed an Irish girl after my great-grandmother died. Then there was Tommy’s legendary stepbrother Leppy, orphaned child of a Jewish family next door who Tommy told us had been raised by his own mother. Then he went his own way. That was a strange story.\n\n2. A modicum of madness. One of Tommy’s brothers spent half his life in Queens Village’s notorious Creedmoor, and a sister tried to gas herself with her husband after he had a heart attack (she failed, he didn’t). Also, both my grandmothers suffered nervous breakdowns, Clara Christgau after a second daughter named Ruth died in infancy, Kitty Snyder after Tommy was arrested in a Times Square men’s room circa 1952.\n\n3. Failure to propagate. By my count, Tommy and his many siblings had only four children among them. What I know about his family setup is: father hardworking steamfitter, mother hardworking saint, thirteen children, four dead in infancy. So maybe things weren’t as colorful as Tommy made them sound when he wetly whispered Williamsburg tales to his firstborn—that is, me—in front of the electric fireplace in Forest Hills. In any case, no one in his enormous family had more than two kids and many were childless for reasons unknown. Some Catholics they were.\n\n4. A miracle. The German migration to Ridgewood from Dutchtown on the Lower East Side was sparked on June 15, 1904, when some thousand would-be picnickers from St. Mark’s Lutheran Church on East 6th Street burned to death or drowned after a criminally ill-maintained excursion boat called the General Slocum caught fire on the East River in one of the worst naval disasters in history. About three hundred survived, including my grandmother, Clara Helmke, and her cousin, Etta Tinken. Supposedly Clara made it ashore carrying her shoes above her head. They were, after all, her best shoes.\n\n5. Lives in the arts.\n\na. Tommy started frequenting Broadway shows as soon as he had some silver in his pocket in the ’00s and kept it up once installed as a postman at the now boarded-up Stuyvesant Station on 14th Street near Avenue A. One of his stories recalled the time he and his sister Betty sang at a party for society bandleader Vincent Lopez, and I have a framed photograph of him entertaining the Christmas revelers at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the white-shoe law firm where he took a post-retirement messenger’s job after failing to find late-life employment as an interior decorator. Tommy is tomming a little—acting the fool for posh straights happy to give it up to someone better at blowing off steam than they are. But he’s also showing off, and he’s also having fun. I figure he’s regaling the swells with a song lost to history called, he always announced, Hyman Goodman Was a Scootsman, although usually he rolled his pants up to simulate a kilt for that one, and in this picture he can’t because he’s holding a cocktail.\n\nb. In his youth my dad was taken up by an arty unmarried cousin of his mother he called Aunt Louise, who lived off a small annuity and liked to paint. Enjoyed classical music, too, I was told. I never saw a smidgen of that in my dad. But Louise could be why he read Thomas Wolfe and Kenneth Lewis Roberts. Or maybe it was the Leopold Schepp Foundation fellowship that insisted he abjure trashy magazines.\n\nc. My dad summered as a teenager with the former Etta Tinken and her husband, George Sturmer, in Rhinebeck, north of the city. This Uncle George—there were many Uncle Georges—was an electrician who owned a gas station. He was also the head of the volunteer fire department and the local bootlegger. Many decades after I learned this, a nonagenarian family friend phoned me out of the blue and told me something even more surprising: that before moving upstate George Sturmer was a high-living limo driver for the Broadway stars. Whenever we visited the Sturmers in the ’50s, I thought they were even more boring than Mom and Pop. Appearances are deceiving? By then they were? Or both?\n\nI feel obliged to bring up this marginally remarkable stuff because I’m so invested in the idea of the ordinary. What’s always given me something special to write about is a gift for finding the putatively ordinary complex, fascinating, and inspirational, often in terms typical of the bohemian folkways that informed my journey from Queens back to the Lower East Side, where Clara spent her girlhood, Tommy delivered the mail, and I’ve lived my entire adult life. That’s not all I do as a critic, but it’s near the center of it. My friend Greil Marcus once wrote a terrific book about Bob Dylan’s Basement Tapes that was initially called Invisible Republic and then underwent a title change after its central conceit caught the literary fancy: The Old, Weird America. I prefer the invisible republic notion myself. In fact, shortly after the book appeared I wrote a Willie Nelson piece that ended: If Bob Dylan seeks to capture what Greil Marcus has dubbed ‘the old, weird America,’ then Willie Nelson is after the enduring, commonplace America. One is as great a mystery as the other.\n\nSo the story I have to tell is a lucky one of a commonplace and, in the unlikely event that later generations are as lucky economically as mine, enduring kind—as I like to say, a democratic kind. Of course I struggled—whenever someone doesn’t, figure a poorer person put in the time for them. As it happens, I underwent considerable spiritual torment on my way to a critical semi-populism more optimistic than most, just as I underwent serious spells of loneliness on my way to a life partnership that means more to me than"
