        "text": "Mondo Melodia–distributed by Ark21/ UMVD.\n\nYou obviously know more about this stuff than I do. For over a year I’ve contemplated writing a piece about what is now indie, which would involve doing research of exactly the sort your question involves. I’ve rejected the idea mostly because it seems too damn specialized, although given how many protestations of virtue go into these questions maybe I should. My basic suspicion is that deals vary so much that any generalization is difficult if not impossible. Independent distribution is such a threatened business that distribution in itself can no longer be a test of whether you’re indie or not. In this particular case I’d want to talk with the heads of Artemis, Bloodshot, and Ark 21, all relatively accessible guys, and see what they have to say. My information has RealWorld going through Narada. Is Narada in turn Virgin/EMI? Oops, missed that. Does anybody really want us to know? Often I think not.\n\n> >From: OvrwrkdB\n\n> >Date: Saturday, July 06, 2002 10:04 PM\n\nIn your section of reviews of albums by the Who, you called The Who Sell Out “their only great album” and yet, you gave Who’s Next an A, downgraded from your original grade of A+. Isn’t this a contradiction? Or is there a further explanation at work here ?\n\nThe brief answer is that for a long time I’ve found it surprisingly hard to listen to the Who. In the ’70s book I rankWho’s Next seventh, although I think it was my number one in the zeroth or first Pazz & Jop. Now it would certainly dip below Blue, John Prine, ZOSO, the long-lost Cry of Love, probably the even longer-lost Motel Shot, and others. I put it on for the first time in at least a decade as I began writing this, and it certainly sounds good. But in the ’80s it became clear–I edited a great piece by Mick Farren that made the argument very strongly–that the Who had turned into (very nearly) the worst kind of art-rock band, and with benefit of hindsight all that synth noodling and Daltrey emoting on Who’s Next makes me a little nauseous. Anyway, I always loved The Who Sell Out best of all.\n\n> >From: Mark D. Bradford\n\n> >Date: Monday, July 08, 2002 7:13 AM\n\nOne of the most startling things I’ve ever read about/by any critic, was an interview Dave Marsh gave not long ago in which he talked about how upset he was when Harry Chapin died. Harry Chapin. They had to agree to disagree about Harry’s records, but they’d been good friends, anyway. (Maybe there’s more–or less–to that. I wouldn’t know.) Somewhat similarly, Pauline Kael once talked about having been very friendly with Jean Renoir (or Sam Peckinpah?), and how painful it was for both of them when his work went into decline. Have you ever been in a comparable position?\n\nI believe friendship is more important than music, which is probably why I have so few friends who are musicians, the only “famous” ones people I knew long before they were “famous”–Roy Nathanson, who I met when he was Ray Dobbins’s 21-year-old boyfriend, former Mofungo bassist Robert Sietsema and that circle, some salsa musicians who I’m connected to via a niece-and-nephew who managed a band and then opened a club in San Juan, a few jazz players who are friends of my trumpet-moonlighting brother-in-law. In those cases I’ve sometimes reviewed records anyway, since omitting them would read wrong in the CG code that anything omitted isn’t worth my while. I once panned a Phil Ochs record and then got to know him doing political work in the ’60s–he quoted my meanest comment (“couldn’t play the guitar any worse were his right hand webbed,” I think) in his press kit and died owing me five bucks. And God knows I’ve really liked a few of the musicians I’ve met. But in general this sort of thing doesn’t happen to me. And I always wonder about journalists, especially critics, who form close relationships with lots of musicians. Bad for the work, seems to me. I hate saying negative things about people I like. But I grit my teeth and do it anyway, as pungently as possible.Less general topic: Can. Erstwhile part of the Euro-“progressive” problem, with occasional, largely unrealized hints of a solution. You reserved judgment in ’70s CG book, and panned Soon Over Babaluma, made roughly two years after their semi-improvised Stockhausen synthesis began to decay into tuneful air conditioning. But unlikeaficionados who prize the earlier, “sprawling” Tago Mago, I prize it only for the singularly unsprawling (and never equaled by them) lead cuts on what was once Side 1: three abrasive tracks-resembling-tunes that cross-reference Stockhausen via Fun House rather than Miles Davis (who was listening to a lot of Stockhausen himself, actually; cf. “Calypso Frelimo”). Bullshit?\n\nI‘ll try to dig out Tago Mago and play those three tracks. But I put enough time into that band to be highly dubious. Their instrumental tone and rhythmic feel always seem at least somewhat wrong to me. I’ve listened to too much jazz to settle for less.\n\n> >From: Chris Feik\n\n> >Date: Monday, July 08, 2002 10:06 PM\n\nWhy is Lionel Trilling one of your heroes?\n\nTo be honest, I almost never look at Trilling anymore–he certainly isn’t up there with Raymond Williams, Pauline Kael, A.J. Liebling, or for that matter my friend Marshall Berman, who has most of his virtues, a much broader frame of reference, and none of the half-conscious snobbery that’s such a drag on Trilling’s moral/political impulses. But Trilling stood out back in the New Criticism days (which I always maintained presaged text-first poststructuralism far more than the pomo crowd generally admits) for insisting that literature was always more than text, and the clarity and grace of his prose put him on another level from his lit-crit contemporaries. Stylistically he makes a nice corrective to the knottiness of Williams, who together with Kael I regard as the greatest critic of the 20th century (that I’ve read). Without having rechecked either, I’d guess I’d still feel more agreement with Trilling on Jane Austen than with Edward Said, even though recent readings of Persuasion and Mansfield Park very much brought home Said’s criticism of the unacknowledged sociopolitical underpinnings of Austen’s enlightened civility.\n\n> >From: George Koo\n\n> >Date: Monday, July 08, 2002 10:51 PM\n\nWhat do you feel about DJ culture? DJ Shadow, Cut Chemist, X-ecutioners, etc. Do you feel that they are legitimate artists or just creative opportunists?\n\nI think DJ Shadow is some kind of visionary genius, like Kid Koala’s album a lot, and was completely delighted by Koala in the context of Bullfrog earlier this year. But for the most part I think there’s too much technique and not enough content in DJing. Musically it strikes me as being a little like drum solos or African percussion ensembles–usually I want more.\n\n> >From: Dave Q\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 09, 2002 3:32 AM\n\nHi Dean! You are truly God-like and I know all your books inside out and back to front–as a writer you are without peer. (The Dave Mason section in the ’70s CG book is the best comedy writing I have ever seen.) However, this question is directed to the “critic” more than the “writer”–does it ever bother you that many of the acts dismissed as “meltdown” or “D-” in earlier CGs have gone on to be revered and subject to massive critical re-estimation (e.g. Black Sabbath, Tim Buckley), while others who you championed (e.g., various singer-songwriters) have vanished without trace, and their records aren’t even in print anymore? When current bands that you like cite Rush, Japan and Montrose as “influences” does it elicit a benign chuckle, or a Homer Simpson forehead-slap, or do you see it as more depressing evidence that civilization really is ending? I’m just wondering how this affects writers in general as we’re in a unique period in history where the pioneers of a sub-genre (rockcrit) are still active but have now been around long enough to see what effect their ideas have had on pop music, or pop music discourse at least.\n\nIt’s never occurred to me that ’70s AOR/art-rock is responsible for the shallowness of today’s pop, such as it is. Studio virtuosity has been a law unto itself in pop since before the rock era.\n\n> >From: Astral Weaks\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 09, 2002 1:07 PM\n\nWhat was it like at the inception of rockcrit, back in the mid-’60s? And did you still think that you would be doing it today?\n\nWe were making it up as we went along and made a lot of mistakes along the way, but the best of us were onto something of tremendous importance intellectually. I thought it would always be part of what I did, didn’t imagine it would be all of it.\n\nWhat do you feel that the field has gained and lost since then?\n\nIt’s gained professionalism and a body of knowledge, and lost inspiration (an organic maturing process) and freedom (I blame capitalism).\n\nWhat do you feel about the apparent decline in standing critics have had with labels since the ’70s? The way I’ve read it, labels used to be more than happy to sponsor junkets and give out records, while today they won’t even send out anything due to fear of critical piracy and leaks.\n\nAll us early rock critics made our own rules because we were the only game in town. That meant among other things that if we wanted to write actual criticism, we could. Soon, although less soon than might have been predicted, both editors and imitators realized it was possible to prepare a less demanding rock-journalistic product, and true critics have been embattled ever since. As for the record companies, all celebrity journalism has been subjected to similar constrictions. Celebrity journalism feeds off access to fame, an easily controllable commodity. The more writers out there, the less access you have to give them to get what you want.\n\nHave you ever objected to the winning album/single in the Pazz and Jop poll? If so, what, why, and who did better?\n\nI thought Imperial Bedroom and the Arrested Development album were bad choices and said why at the time.\n\nDo you remember how much your first Rolling Stones concert tickets cost?\n\nFive bucks Canadian, I believe–maybe four. I never had to buy them again.\n\nWord association/opinions on:\n\nRichard Goldstein & Sgt. Pepper.\n\nHe was wrong. He’s wrong about Eminem too.\n\nDennis Wilson\n\nDead.\n\n“Now Sounds”\n\nWhat are they?\n\nThe latest Stones tour.\n\nI’m not going unless somebody begs.\n\nWes Anderson\n\nSeems pretty good, prefer Mira Nair.\n\nThe “new” NYC/Brooklyn scene.\n\nI’m too old for scenes, but I’m sorry I haven’t seen more of the bands.\n\n“The Osbournes”\n\nGood show that portends many worse shows.\n\nEmo\n\nNot what it should be.\n\nThe absence of bass players in some of today’s best bands.\n\nSleater-Kinney seems to motorvate without, but I can’t think of another one offhand.\n\nAnthony DeCurtis\n\nDetested his priggish, status-conscious Lester Bangs piece.\n\nUncut magazine\n\nIs that about foreskins?\n\n“Punk Chic”\n\nThe only Chic I ever liked had Bernard Edwards in it.\n\nSound Opinions\n\nOpinions are like brains–everybody’s got one.\n\nClear Channel Communications\n\nMay they go out of business in ignominy without further compromising my 401k.\n\nAmericana\n\nI’ve crossed the country by automobile 10 times and would love to do it again.\n\nSeo Taji, the inventor of hardcore Korean “Pimp-Rock.”\n\nI have a thing against pimps.\n\n> >From: Robert B. Tomshany\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 09, 2002 4:36 PM\n\nIf it’s OK to ask about your daughter Nina, I’d like to inquire about her reactions to being reared by two professional writers and exposed to a huge amount of music. You’ve commented on Nina’s musical acuity before, and I’m sure you’ll do so again, but now that she’s fast approaching full-fledged adulthood I wonder whether she might express her talent by making music herself? Or, having two writers for parents, might she be more interested in a literary career, whether writing about music or something else? Also, if she seems clearly headed in one of these two directions, how does she see her relationship to these fields–art/show business on the one hand, or literature/journalism on the other?\n\nNina shows no interest in being a writer, although she attributes her large vocabulary to growing up around us. She’s a pretty talented musician, but so far hasn’t been inclined to pursue that either. Insofar as she thinks about a career in music, she thinks about the biz or the studio. But she’s just finished her junior year in high school. Really, who knows?\n\n> >From: Chris Feik<bcm@iasorecords.com>\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 09, 2002 7:40 PM\n\nWhy do you reckon that Afropop has had such little influence on rock/pop emanating from the English-speaking world, whereas reggae/dub influenced the sound and feel of everything from Clapton to the Clash to Ace of Base?\n\nReggae’s less foreign. It’s r&b-derived. It’s in English, an attraction never to be discounted. It comes from the Americas. And the rhythm’s easier–a distant cousin of the polka via ska, I’ve long believed. It’s really hard to imagine the Bellamy Brothers doing a competent mbalax or soukous rip.\n\n> >From: Martin Miller\n\n> >Date: Wednesday, July 10, 2002 12:39 AM\n\nFirst, I would like to say that I have enjoyed your opinions on music for almost 20 years now and eagerly await your Consumer Guide column every month. I’m writing to ask your opinions on several albums that you’ve mentioned in passing but haven’t given a grade to due to fact that the records were released as imports or they existed before your Consumer Guide column was established. Anyway here’s the list:\n\nBlue Cheer, Oh Pleasant Hope\n\nA late-’69 release that got a B+ and I haven’t heard since approximately 1980, if then.\n\nAdverts, Crossing the Red Sea\n\nA Greil Marcus fave I never got (he does like those Britpunk bands with women in them)–I think the Adverts boil down to “Gary Gilmore’s Eyes.”\n\nBeach Boys, Pet Sounds\n\nA good record that never meant anything to me personally–I prefer any early GH, also Wild Honey and many other late-’60s early-’70s albums.\n\nDel Shannon, Further Adventures of Charles Westover\n\nSilly record.\n\nThe Serpent Power\n\nA solid A-, now available on CD.\n\nMoby Grape, Wow\n\nB plus at the time, I play the Legacy twofer.\n\nJefferson Airplane, Crown of Creation\n\nTheir best album, I thought at the time, although my initial dislike of them reasserted itself bigtime around 10 or 15 years ago.\n\nSoft Boys, Underwater Moonlight\n\nSounded good when I checked it out mid-’80s and I think I replayed the CD reissue, but you know, Robyn Hitchcock definitely ain’t my guy.\n\nSwamp Dogg, Total Destruction to Your Mind\n\nMy introduction to Jerry Williams, an A- at the time that I wouldn’t swear has maintained there.\n\nStreets–English punk compilation on Beggars Banquet label\n\nA minus.\n\nAny studio or compilation album by Cream, Them, or the Yardbirds with a grade A- or higher\n\nMy fave Cream album is Goodbye, second Fresh Cream, certainly no other A minuses there, and I’ve never liked the Yardbirds on more than a cut-by-cut basis despite many attempts to enlighten myself; maybe it’s that Mickey Most thing, or maybe it’s the singing and songwriting, eh?\n\nChrysalis, Definition\n\nI remember the band name, vaguely.\n\n> >From: Rodney Taylor\n\n> >Date: Wednesday, July 10, 2002 6:31 AM\n\nOne of the things that I like about you is that your ears can appreciate both the Backstreet Boys and Sonic Youth. Do you think this reflects your having grown up when “popular” and “quality” weren’t seen as mutually exclusive categories, and do you see any kind of generation divide among rock critics (not to oversimplify or anything)? Do you think today’s rockcrit establishment, by and large, would have liked Elvis P. at the time, or would they have preferred folk or jazz purity?\n\nI think there’s no more important issue in rock criticism than the one you suggest–the idea that popular means bad not only is hell on good criticism, it’s a perversion of why and how rock criticism started. As with the novel, where a similar mindset leads arbiters to conclude that Walter Abish is more important than Bruce Sterling, what makes all but the most abstract subcultural rock work descends from the same kind of formal grounding that made Chuck Berry popular almost half a century ago. Yet the opposite is a working assumption of most young critics, especially the more adventurous ones, adventurous and smart being far from the same thing. That said, I think a lot of what’s popular today is very bad indeed. I only listen to the radio when I’m in the same room with my daughter, don’t recognize half of what’s played, and rarely feel much impulse to dispense with my ignorance. And that said, the best show I’ve caught all year, easy, was by Pink. We’ll see whether Orchestra Baobab/Super Rail Band matches up.\n\n> >From: Charles Carlino\n\n> >Date: Wednesday, July 10, 2002 8:32 AM\n\nWhat do/did you have against Laura Nyro’s music anyway? Be as short or long-winded as you want.\n\nHyperromanticsm generally turns my stomach, as do earth mothers. She did write some good tunes, though.\n\nIn an old review of an Essra Mohawk album, you said: “When she calls herself a ‘full-fledged woman,’ it sounds like ‘pool player’s’ woman, which given her persona makes more sense.” What did you mean by “given her persona?” She’s a mysterious figure, sure, but what exactly is her persona?\n\nAll I knew or know about Essra Mohawk is that album, which suggested (as I recall, and what I don’t recall is whether morbid curiosity tempted me to put on the reissue, so we’re talking 32 years ago) hyperromantic earth mother more likely to dig macho jerks than pencil-necked geeks. Although come to think of it most pool players aren’t exactly musclebound.\n\n> >From: Jim McGaw\n\n> >Date: Wednesday, July 10, 2002 5:46 AM\n\nI’ve always been curious about the number of times you generally listen to a CD/album before grading it, and whether that number of spins has gone up or down over the years. Due to the nature of your job, it must be frustrating that you simply don’t have the time–unlike a casual fan–to listen to some of your favorite CDs over and over again.\n\nIf you’ll read the intros to my CD books, you’ll see that not having time for my favorite music has long been the biggest drawback to this job. Nevertheless, the figures remain the same: at least three listens for an HM or written pan of any sort, at least five for anything that makes the body of the CG, and those are the low-end figures. That means spins, not dedicated listens–a lot of it is just processing while I do something else. But it does take time.\n\nAre there many artists whose catalogues you’ve completely reassessed in terms of your critical reception–and how has getting older played a part in all that? (Example: You once included Frank Sinatra in a “Meltdown” list, but years later gave a few of his reissues/compilations an A or A-.)\n\nPeople keep asking me this question and the answer is always the same: one hallmark of my work is that I don’t write about something until I know what I think. This means I don’t change my mind much, although I might if I had more time to relisten, I suppose. I do change it a little. As for Sinatra, he sucked in the ’80s. Also, hyperbole and cognitive dissonance are fun.\n\n> >From: Paul Hayden\n\n> >Date: Thursday, July 11, 2002 9:43 AM\n\nIn the past 5 to 10 years, which artist has pleasantly surprised you the most, and which artist has disappointed you the most?\n\nThe rough answer to that question would probably be the past 20 years’ two most durable and prolific artists, with the possible confusing exception of Youssou N’Dour, whose quality is more tied up in live performance: Prince and Sonic Youth. I thought Prince could keep going forever, and while he may yet, he’s definitely slowed down in the past five years. From anybody else his recent output would be more than acceptable; from him it seems barrel scrapings. Sonic Youth, after presaging and then riding the grunge wave, basically abandoned the eternal evil teen thing and began to make some of the most beautiful adult rock ever: Experimental Jet Set, A Thousand Leaves,NYC Ghosts and Flowers. I’m not so sure about the new one, Murray Street. But this was music no one anticipated and many young and old failed to get.\n\n> >From: Steve Farneth\n\n> >Date: Thursday, July 11, 2002 11:51 AM\n\nHave you had a chance to listen to the new Springsteen recordings yet? What do you think? Is this going to be a great, elaborately arranged rock album worthy of the ghosts he’s asking us to dance with or will it be self-conscious and written entirely in metaphor?\n\nI got invited to some listening sessions and tried to make one but couldn’t. “Elaborately arranged” is never a big plus by me, not even with six pieces, so I hope they’re not.\n\n> >From: Chuck Tahirali\n\n> >Date: Friday, July 12, 2002 12:34 PM\n\nHaving just read the pieces written by RJ Smith and Simon Frith for Don’t Stop ‘til You Get Enough, it is interesting to note the contrast between Mr. Frith’s apparently hard-won lesson (“As an editor Christgau taught me that self-expression is not a matter of writing what comes into your head but working and working on words until they say what you want them to mean”) and Mr. Smith’s pointed remembrances of the editor’s candor and spontaneity (“Bob Christgau doesn’t think the way other people do; he doesn’t filter his thoughts like most folks”).\n\nI find myself wondering: Which approach, if either, predominates when you create your capsule music reviews? What is the ratio of CG reviews that are, more or less, spontaneously composed (that write themselves, so to speak) to those that inspire or require constant refining, re-working and re-writing? Is enthusiasm for the music the determining factor (one way or the other)?\n\nThe answer to that is simple. In speech, I’m notoriously candid. As a writer, I’m notoriously slow. CG capsules are generally worked, worked, and reworked, which is one reason their syntax is so dense. On the other hand, I’m always trying to catch ideas or conceits or free associations on the fly as I listen, and have been known to drink a midnight beer to get one flowing.\n\n> >From: Stan\n\n> >Date: Sunday, July 14, 2002 9:09 AM\n\nWhat are your top five concerts of all time?\n\nI’ll leave this concert question out of the list compendium and answer off the top of my head: Big Brother at Monterey 1967, Luamba Franco at Manhattan Center 1984 (1983?), supposedly a subpar show, Hüsker Dü late at Gildersleeves in front of about eight people in 82-83, Clash at Leeds 1977, and, oh hell, Coltrane joined by Eric Dolphy on the encore at the Village Gate I believe in September 1962. Those were great ones–there are dozens more. A real list would require a week of listmaking, consultation, and thought.\n\nWhat artist/group(s) do you never miss when they come to New York?\n\nThere’s no one I absolutely don’t miss–stay home a weekend for, or miss a big deadline for. Very close, however, are my two favorite live bands: Youssou N’Dour et Super Etoile and Los Van Van.\n\nWith MP3s becoming so dominant, and CDs stuffed with filler, do you soon see an end to the “album” era?\n\nI think the LP may die and may not–probably not, they’re too useful for the DIYers who are the future of music. Either way, I don’t think MP3’s will have much to do with it. Some other Net technology might.\n\nHappy belated birthday to the greatest of all time! Will Robert Christgau retire at 65? 70? And if so, are there any critics with somewhat similar tastes that you would recommend to us folks who love good music but won’t have the time to sift through it all?\n\nI have no expectation of retiring, because I’m not going to stop loving music or needing to earn a living–I’m not rich or even well off and never will be. If the LP does die that could change. So could a layoff–the newspaper business isn’t necessarily eternal either.\n\nI know you listen for 8-12 hours each day. That’s an incredible amount of time. So, which do you do first–pee, or put on some music?\n\nPee.\n\n> >From: Stanley Whyte\n\n> >Date: Sunday, July 14, 2002 5:01 PM\n\nLooking back on your Stranded essay 24 years later, if you were asked to do it again would you stand by your choice or would you pick a different album? Or does picking one single album to while away the years on a desert island make sense anymore?\n\nPicking one album to while away the time on a desert island never made sense. It was just an excuse to write a long essay about something you love and get paid for it. See my introduction to the Da Capo edition of Strandedfor further elucidation.\n\n> >From: Andrew Lapointe\n\n> >Date: Monday, July 15, 2002 1:09 PM\n\nHow did you acquire the title “Dean of American Rock Critics”? Do you think there is a hierarchy in rock criticism?\n\nAs I’ve explained many many times, I appointed myself Dean of American Rock Critics when slightly soused at a 5th Dimension press party, I believe in early 1970. It seemed to push people’s buttons, so I stuck with it. There’s obviously no official hierarchy within rock criticism–only real academies can do that. But if you mean to ask whether I think some rock critics are better than others, you’re damn straight I do. Don’t you?\n\n> >From: Shy-but-fun-lovin\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2002 1:40 AM\n\nIs the ‘g’ in your name silent?\n\nNo.\n\nYour prose has always been quite dense yet economical. Does it take a lot of time to get those sentences ‘just right’?\n\nYes.\n\nWill you ever be able to live down a reasonably favorable (“Okay stuff”) Uriah Heep review you wrote back in ’73?\n\nAlready have.\n\n> >From: Vic S.\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2002 5:00 AM\n\nYou’ve often said that Erotica is Madonna’s best album. Do you still feel this way, ten years later, and do you think it will undergo a reevaluation from the critical establishment since it was brushed aside in the controversy over her Sex book? Do you think Madonna’s legacy will include her musical achievements or only focus on her (over-discussed) “iconic value”?\n\nYes, I still think Erotica is Madonna’s best album–not counting Immaculate Collection, of course. And yes, I think her music will at the very least stand alongside her iconic value historically–an issue discussed at some length in the Madonna essay in Grown Up All Wrong.\n\nDo you think you would like or appreciate Radiohead more if a female voice was singing the songs? If it was a Thelma Yorke instead of Thom?\n\nThe right woman’s voice might make a difference, I suppose, though the portentous structures are no plus and I have a hard time imagining a woman writing those lyrics–unless it was Thalia Zedek or, to go back some, Nina Hagen, in which case I’ll take Thom, thanks.\n\nFor such a world-music aficionado, I am surprised that to my knowledge you’ve never discussed the world’s most prolific artist, Indian playback singer Lata Mangeshkar (or even her sister, Asha Bhosle, who was the subject of that Cornershop song). What is your opinion of their voices and/or work, if you’ve heard any? And if you haven’t, if you can tell me your address, I’d be more than happy to send you some samplings!\n\nThe only Bollywood album I’ve ever really cottoned to is the Luaka Bop Vijaya Anand, which I seem to have mislaid. I appreciate those sopranos in principle, but the reality is too much for me after three-four cuts\n\nIn a hundred years, who do you think will still be remembered from the latter half of the 20th century in popular music? And what about in a thousand years (if our civilization is still around then)?\n\nIn a hundred years the top candidate is clearly James Brown, but I believe many others will survive–it’s already been nearly 50 for the Berry-Presley-Penniman-Lewis-Charles-Diddley generation, and they’re not going anywhere. A thousand years is anyone’s guess. I hope there’s an inhabited planet in a thousand years, and that my great-greats-to-the-nth still have recorded sound. If so–James Brown! And also the Five Satins’ “In the Still of the Night.”\n\n> >From: MXcR245Fmx\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2002 7:58 AM\n\nI’ve been rock-critical as a job for five years. The first four for a small weekly and then just over one year ago, the rock writer at the local daily offered me a job. As I had just dropped out of the philosophy program at my local university and was facing what seemed like an unholy mountain of student-loan debt, I accepted the higher paying gig. I also do a fairly small amount of work for a few scattered mags of varying repute.\n\nNow here’s the thing, the senior music writer (let’s call him Mentor, very sarcastically) is ten years older than me. I’m only 25, so he’s still relatively young. Over the last few months especially, he’s quite obviously been trying to make me irrelevant. Where we earlier had sort of traded off on assignments (it was never equal, but I was at least getting a small piece of the action), he now takes everything for himself, except for the geezers and the “nobodies.” For the most part, I do prefer talking to the less-than-famous and turning over strange rocks to discover something new underneath. But my Mentor has explicitly shut me out of major happenings where there has been lots of cheddar to go around. At first I thought he was trying to make sure I paid my dues (despite having slogged it out for nearly all of my adult life), and I could accept that. But it’s become quite obvious that he feels threatened by me and my zesty youth and is trying to bury me. The thing is, I have no desire to usurp him. I just want a fair shake.\n\nAs someone who has aged gracefully in such a youth-obsessed industry, do you have any advice on how to confront my Mentor without him thinking I’m trying to push him into the Home for Aged Rock-Crits?\n\nNot knowing the quality of your work or the quality of his, I can’t answer that question. More than you seem to think depends on that. But I can say that there clearly aren’t enough gigs to go around, so that this kind of problem arises over and over. I’m glad you think I’ve aged gracefully, but I have not the slightest doubt (because every once in a while some younger colleague can’t resist telling me so) that my complete lack of interest in finding a more age-appropriate calling sticks in the craw of hundreds of people who think they could do my job as well as I do–or better, for finger-on-the-pulse reasons.\n\n> >From: Tim Powis\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2002 8:03 AM\n\nHow much do you need to know about music–the nuts & bolts stuff: harmony, chord changes, counterpoint & all that–to be a music critic?\n\nI don’t know shit about that stuff, and I’m a music critic. Long ago I thought knowing that stuff actually hurt criticism, and long ago it did–too often Jon Landau, a conspicuous offender, missed the forest for the trees. Now I’m very sorry I don’t know scads more than the dribs and drabs I’ve picked up over the years. When Alex Ross makes a harmonic argument for Radiohead, I wish I could tell exactly how unusual and exactly how relevant the details he adduces are. And of course, it’s a damn useful addition to one’s descriptive and analytic arsenal if you have the perspective not to take it too seriously–as Jon Pareles does, to choose just one example.\n\n> >From: Mike Tapscott\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2002 10:55 AM\n\nI’ve been an admirer of yours for some time. One thing that’s puzzled me though, is your reaction to certain “alternative bands” like the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, or Wilco. I’ve wondered why you seem to have violent reactions to what they’re doing sometimes. Is it because you believe these groups are repeating things that have been done in the past? These seem to be some of the more innovative groups out there, and yet you still seem to prefer the Strokes or the Old 97s.\n\nWhat can I say? I think their “innovations” are pretty secondhand. Tricky and DJ Shadow and the Latin Playboys do the same kind of stuff much more daringly and totally. I didn’t think Mercury Rev or the Flaming Lips had much on the ball songwise before, and I don’t think they’re any great shakes at soundscaping either. If I sound vehement about it, that’s polemical. Everybody else is kvelling. If nobody else cared, I wouldn’t have to.\n\n> >From: Chuck McCain\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2002 11:36 AM\n\nWhat was the first album and single you ever bought?\n\nGood question with an answer that would embarrass me if I got embarrassed about such things. First single: Doris Day, “Secret Love” (loved the B side, “Deadwood Stage”). First album: an Eydie Gorme record with “St. Louis Blues” on it that I either traded or sold to Mrs. Mulvihill across the street a few years later.\n\nIf Greil Marcus decided to publish a new Stranded with all new essays from the surviving writers from the first, in addition to pieces from younger writers and people that didn’t get the chance the first time around, what album would you write about?\n\nToday, Sonic Youth’s A Thousand Leaves (still reeling from that breakup piece in the Voice), or some Afropop compilation. Tomorrow, something else.\n\nHow come no label has reissued One Kiss Leads To Another by Hackamore Brick? Being as big a Ramones fan as I am, I’d love to see if it is as good as Marcus said it was in Stranded.\n\nDon’t worry about it–it’s not as good as Greil Marcus says it is. Neither is the Lora Logic album.\n\nWho the hell was Jo-Jo Dancer anyway?\n\nI’m absolutely convinced it’s Charles Aaron, and I don’t admire him for lying about it. Then again, what he wrote sucked too.\n\nAny early calls on contenders for Pazz & Jop this year?\n\nI never speculate in print about Pazz & Jop for fear of skewing the results.\n\n> >From: Yon\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2002 11:53 AM\n\nCould you please tell me if you still hate Abba, as you hated them in the ’70s when they were active? What do you think about your colleagues like John Rockwell, Joel Vance, Greg Shaw and others who thought Abba were brilliant?\n\nAbba still don’t ring my chimes, although their expertise is undeniable if you like that kind of thing and their cultural status lends them a certain charm–that Australian movie with the Abba soundtrack a few years back was terrific, and the music helped. I supposed the right comp might be some kind of Honorable Mention, but last time a best-of came through, I found myself getting bored pretty fast much beyond “Waterloo” and “Dancing Queen.” As for disagreeing critics, so what?\n\n> >From: J. Bennett\n\n> >Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2002 2:33 PM\n\nBack in 1977 you wrote a Consumer Guide discussing the albums of 1967. Would you ever consider doing a similar column on 1968? Of particular interest would be your thoughts on The White Album and Van Morrison’s Astral Weeks, two notorious critics favorites conspicuously absent from the rock library lists in your Consumer Guide books.\n\nAs I keep saying, lists are work, Jack. If somebody offered me enough money, I can imagine undertaking such freelance tasks. But I doubt they will, and I have plenty of other projects to keep me busy. I like The White Album, but it’s too McCartneyesque to be a favorite, and have never cottoned to Astral Weeks.\n\n> >From: steinar storlokken\n\n> >Date: Wednesday, July 17, 2002 10:30 AM\n\nIn a recent interview you mentioned the Beatles among your top 5 artists. Is it pure listening pleasure, or cultural/historical significance that places them in front of, for example, the Clash and the Stones?\n\nI play the Beatles more than any other ’60s group to this day, and also more than the Clash or the Sex Pistols.\n\nYou have been widely known to be a huge Stones and Clash fan. Has your regard for these bands fallen, and, if so, why?\n\nMy regard for the Stones has fallen only insofar as I don’t find their vision as bracing as I did up through, say,Some Girls. I still love the Clash, though I don’t play them much because they don’t suit my lifestyle.\n\nIs the omission of the Basement Tapes in the Core Collection an error?\n\nThe Basement Tapes certainly belongs in any core collection (although, actually, not all the Band cuts are all that).\n\nHow does your favorite album of the ’90s rank among the greatest albums of all time?\n\nMy favorite albums of the ’90s mean less culturally than those from previous decades, but more personally, because recent music is always one of the things that keeps me alive.\n\nDo you still think Double Dee and Steinski is an A+, or do you think it sounds dated in the wake of more sophisticated DJ-ism?\n\nI still love Double Dee and Steinski. I still love Buchanan and Goodman’s “The Flying Saucer,” too.\n\n> >From: Carrie & Mark\n\n> >Date: Wednesday, July 17, 2002 1:44 PM\n\nEver consider retirement? I sure hope not. I don’t know what I’d do without my monthly Consumer Guide.\n\nI’m currently helping to care for four elder relatives aged 84, 86, 91, and 94. This is a great lesson in mortality, and by these ages I assume I will have retired–people do well outlive their competence these days. On the other hand, my father, who held down three or more jobs when I was growing up, was forced into retirement by the 1975 New York City budget crisis and did OK. I sometimes chuckle ha ha ha to think how impossible that would be for me economically, another thing that’s changed these days–I envy my father that option. I’d be delighted to work less hard than I do, afford to travel more than I can, and write what I want even more precisely and variously than is permissible even at the Voice, which obviously grants me enormous autonomy. All that said, I don’t foresee chucking the Consumer Guide unless the album-music biz model breaks down more than I think likely.\n\nHas your daughter had an effect on your listening habits? Has she turned you on to anyone you might’ve missed?\n\nMy daughter exposes me to music I wouldn’t ordinarily pay much mind to, but since her main passions are teenpop and salsa, neither a genre I love, there isn’t all that much direct influence. She certainly turned me on to the great Pink, however–as soon as the first video was on MTV. And she made me to go to my first Backstreet Boys concert, which had enjoyable repercussions even if they’ve now gone down the tubes.\n\nHow much do you use the Internet as a music source? Not for downloading of course, but as a source of information, buying music, etc.\n\nThe speakers on my computer haven’t worked for over a year. Anybody wanna come to my house and figure out what’s wrong, then give me a downloading tutorial that works for my fully unloaded, four-gig, Windows 98 computer? On the other hand, I frequently buy CDs on the Net. It’s clearly the easiest way to find obscure stuff–just pop the title into Google if the usual suspects don’t have it. And for information I use the Net constantly, many times a day. Google is one of my favorite modern conveniences. It beats spellcheck by a mile.\n\nEditor’s note: Several of the participants in this survey asked Robert some variation on one of the following three questions: 1) What are your favorite albums and singles of the ’90s? 2) What are your favorite albums of the ’60s? 3) What are your all-time favorite jazz records? Here, he tackles them all in one shot, along with a few other list-oriented queries. (Thanks to the following participants who asked for lists or were beaten to the punch with their questions: Scott Bassett, the Betatronix Gang, Charles Bromley, Joe Elsa, Kurt Jaeckel, Jim Ross, Vic S., John Tiglias, and Joe Yanosik.)\n\nI’m gonna deal with the rest of the list questions here, but first I’d like to say a few things about lists in general. I love lists, and that love is a source of my own peculiar cult status. It’s the reason I started Pazz & Jop, the reason I started the A lists in the back of the CG books. But let’s be clear–as Nick Hornby has made a mint proving (hey, give me some), lists are very boy. You should have seen me arranging my baseball cards, keeping Peter Tripp’s top 40, devising my pathetic top 10s of girls in Flushing High School at a time when I’d never had a single date (which, for the record, was all of my time in Flushing High School). This is why Greil Marcus attracts fans who write avant-garde theater pieces based on his critical fantasies and I get guys asking for my favorite albums by knuckleballers. Second, done properly, lists are work (as are grades, you think I just know about lots of records I don’t tell anyone about?). The reason I didn’t do a ’90s core library, much to the dismay of my editor and many reviewers, is that we were on a tight deadline and I wasn’t about to squeeze one out in less than the week I didn’t have, which is what the ’80s core library took. I’m not about to do that work here, either, except for some relistening on the ’90s and then ’60s top 10, which was fun. I love excuses to play records I love."
