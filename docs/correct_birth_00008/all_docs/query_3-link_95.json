        "text": "He's more right than wrong, on balance. One of the few (only?) that 'got' \"Exile on Main Street\" right away. Right on with some music from Africa that no one else bothered to listen to, like King Sunny Ade and Fela and Anthologies. So, some points in his favor.\n\nHe just needed to get out of NYC more often. It must do something to your brain if you think the NY Dolls and Ramone are 'A\" bands, and you don't make time listen to, for example, Gene Clark, John Martyn or Bruce Cockburn....\n\nI just sold my copy of this, I tried for years to get into it. Not for me.\n\nI don't have angst for Christgau. I like to read his comments on occasion. Everyone is a music critic, it's what we do as music geeks, realized or not. There is some decent work on that list. Shocked to see Sonic Youth on there. They had something to say back when on him, actually have this single.\n\nOne of the things that makes critiquing his A+ albums list for its exclusions difficult is that his tastes have changed somewhat over time, and he is not very good at all with updating his opinions on his website. For instance, on his 50 greatest albums from the recent RS poll, Joni's Blue and the VU S/T both made it, along with many other albums that don't earn A+'s on his site like Specialist in All Styles and Tha Carter III. So we can safely assume all those are A+'s now. But the site still lists them as A's or A-'s. I think he'd add a lot of albums to the A+ list now that aren't on there, and probably take a couple away (I recall him mentioning at once point that A Salty Dog was not an A+ at all anymore).\n\nI think he's an incredible writer and listener of music. Don't always agree with his taste and sometimes find his selections too driven by his progressive politics, which I mostly share, but which I don't require to be as present in the artist's music and lyrics. But what he's accomplished with his reviews is unique and also addictive. You can learn so much on his site, and there is always more to uncover.\n\nGuilty of that as well. While I’m always happy to see something I love get great reviews, I’m completely entertained by a well written contrary opinion. Kind of like when Siskel & Ebert were in agreement on a bad film and just ripped it to shreds. Their disagreements when one liked it and the other didn’t were always great fun but watching them poke at something together was even better. Same with Christgau. He usually didn’t waste too many words on records he hated either.\n\nFrom this A+ list those that are in my library and my take on those...\n\nThe Clash: London Calling [1980, Epic] A+\n\nThe Robert Cray Band: Strong Persuader [1986, Mercury] B+\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival: Willy and the Poorboys [1969, Fantasy] A+\n\nMiles Davis: Jack Johnson [1971, Columbia] B+\n\nDerek and the Dominos: Layla [1970, Atco] A+\n\nBob Dylan: Love and Theft [2001, Columbia] B\n\nBob Dylan: Modern Times [2006, Columbia] C\n\nBob Dylan/The Band: The Basement Tapes [1975, Columbia] C+\n\nVan Morrison: Moondance [1970, Warner Bros.] A+\n\nPrince: Sign o' the Times [1987, Paisley Park] B\n\nProcol Harum: A Salty Dog [1969, A&M] B\n\nThe Rolling Stones: Exile on Main Street [1972, Rolling Stones] A+\n\nSly & the Family Stone: There's a Riot Goin' On [1971, Epic] A-\n\nBruce Springsteen: Born in the USA [1984, Columbia] A-\n\nSteely Dan: Pretzel Logic [1974, ABC] A+\n\nRod Stewart: Every Picture Tells a Story [1971, Mercury] A+\n\nTelevision: Marquee Moon [1977, Elektra] B-\n\nThe Who: The Who Sell Out [1995, MCA] C+\n\nLucinda Williams: Car Wheels on a Gravel Road [1998, Mercury] A+\n\nNeil Young: After the Gold Rush [1970, Reprise] A+\n\nNeil Young: Rust Never Sleeps [1979, Reprise] A\n\n“Automatically got rave reviews“? Come on! The implication would be that every follow up to a well regarded debut would „automatically“ get rave reviews. Which absolutely isn’t the case.\n\nBecause sometimes „A“ is followed by „B“. As in backlash!\n\nThat said, „Funeral“ may be my favourite AF album. Still I think up to and including „Reflektor“ all of their albums range between excellent and very good.\n\nWhile I think that Robert Cray is a talented and likable fellow, I don't rank any of his recordings anywhere as highly as I do recordings of Muddy Waters or Howlin' Wolf in their prime. He is carrying a torch for the blues, and I am glad he is doing so.\n\nJoe Louis Walker is someone I highly respect as well, and is still making great records.\n\nI used this website to codify my \"Top 100\" albums.\n\nTop 100 Greatest Music Albums\n\nI need to revise this a little bit but I'd say the A+ rating doesn't go much past the 30s. This doesn't show all my A+ albums as I only allowed one album per named artist. I'd say the Beatles has a couple more as does Dylan, the Stones, Prince and Neil Young.\n\nAs for Christgau, I agree with a lot of his choices. I disagree with some as well. I read his column in Creem religiouslyin the 70's and early 80's. I'm not sure how influential he is too me, but I've always enjoyed his sense of humor. He could write a review of the same album with the same opinion as someone like Dave Marsh and he wouldn't sound like a sanctimonious P.O.S. just an opinionated one.\n\nIt's not so much that I disagree with Christgau's preferences--sometimes I agree with him, sometimes I don't--but I've always found his little capsule reviews to be superficial and unenlightening, aimed more at trying to make clever quips than saying anything meaningful about the music. I continue to be surprised that so many people seem to take \"the Dean\" so seriously. Everyone's got an opinion, but his never come across as being particularly well considered.\n\nI \"like\" his review of Duran Duran (I don't totally agree)\n\nDecade [Capitol, 1989]\n\nLiars till the end, they pretend their decade didn't end around 1984-'85, when U.K. new pop conquered the world and went phfft. But the best-of proves it. First side's all anyone needs of the brightly tuneful meaninglessness that made them video stars, and after side two cut one, \"The Reflex,\" they sink into an anonymity relieved only by the greatest record they never made, Nile Rodgers's \"Notorious,\" and the softcore closer \"All She Wants.\" Sometimes I think the little girls don't understand a damn thing.
