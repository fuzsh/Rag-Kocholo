        "text": "Care to guess if this was yet another difficult, transitional year for music journalism? The story may be the same as in years past, but that also means music writing still thrives. As to why and how? Because itâs happening everywhere.\n\nRolling Stone had a year that theyâre going to be happy to forget. The fallout from the UVA rape story included a mea culpa in the Columbia Journal Review, followed by bewilderment when the magazine seemingly didnât respond until July when managing editor Will Dana departed. If that wasnât bad enough for the mag, their parent company announced a round of layoffs over the summer which included senior writer and king of rock liner notes David Fricke. Billboard had a better but mixed year, suffering a round of layoffs in May, but also posting good traffic numbers to its site and making headway with branded content, which is going to be part of the future whether purists like it or not.\n\nMeanwhile, a pair of publication sales had different dynamics to them. NYC institution The Village Voice went through yet another sale, while indie rock bible Pitchfork was gobbled up by Conde Nast. P4K is obviously in a different position than The Voice, as itâs still a significant taste maker and online destination, so itâll be interesting to see how it changes, if it does at all.\n\nGrantland wasnât so lucky, getting its plug pulled by ESPN in October. Among other things, Grantland was a place for great cultural think pieces, musical and otherwise, so it was no surprise when a number of other outlets sang its praises and mourned it.\n\nSelf-styled Dean of Rock Crits Robert Christgau had an interesting summer. It started with his perch at Cuepoint/Medium being threatened as he was told that he could only keep writing for them if he did it for free, which isnât exactly a winning strategy for a full-time writer. Luckily, he soon found a new paying home at Noisey/Vice for his column. Sasha Frere-Jones also had a period of transition as he left his long-time staff job at The New Yorker in January to become an editor at Genius.com, a website that annotates rap lyrics, and then moved to contract work for them and then to take up a more traditional post at the L.A. Times.\n\nSo where are other writers going for safe haven? Into the virtual world, but not the places that youâd expect. While newsrooms face the gloom of ever-dwindling numbers, online curation offered some hope and employment for writers/editors to help guide readers through the morass of web content. Apple Music hired music writers as curators, but there are even more opportunities for writers in social media. Snapchat turned part of itself into a news hub, so much so that some publications now have their own team to work with the service, though some places are finding that working with SC might mean a drop in web traffic.\n\nNot one to fall behind, Facebook developed their own news service with Instant Articles, though the initial offering didnât have any music mags as part of the mix. Google and Twitter are also getting in on action, starting up their own âinstant articlesâ services for mobile users.\n\nInstagram was already a favorite destination for artists, so itâs no surprise they are getting in the curation game too, and started up their own @Music service to single out known and unknown performers. Instagram is also becoming a more and more important space not just for photos but for written content as well, detailed in this thoughtful New York article by Kyle Chayka. The lesson here? Any smart publication should have some kind of social media guru on staff to keep up with and take advantage of the changes in the field, which are happening even as youâre reading this right now.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that 2015 was a banner year for music writing in book form. First off, we had a stack of impressive titles from writers you should know and should be reading, including Robert Christgau, Banning Eyre, Nelson George, Richard Goldstein, Peter Guralnick, Jessica Hopper, Greil Marcus, Michaelangelo Matos, Kris Needs and Lisa Robinson among others. Then on top of that, weâve also had a flurry of musicians and industry people adding their stories to the mix, including Eddie Argos, Carrie Brownstein (best one Iâve seen), Elvis Costello, John Fogerty, Philip Glass, Kim Gordon, Rick Hall, Bill Kreutzmann, Willie Nelson, Patti Smith and Cynthia Weil.\n\nSomething notable about the following list is a number of pieces collected here came about as responses to other articles. Thatâs becoming an ongoing trend as noted in last yearâs music writing round-up. Years ago, these kind of responses might have been a few sentences in the letters section, but some writers and editors have decided more and more that these issues were important enough to turn into articles, thus creating a wider conversation. Some might think of this as inter-magazine/publication sniping and navel-gazing, but I say that all of us are better for having these discussions out in the open.\n\nAll of this fine work is proof of something: Music journalism is still alive. The practicality of calling it a full time job is getting harder as each day goes by, but it still exists and sometimes thrives, even if many times itâs not happening in places youâd traditionally think. As long as there are spaces out there for communication, arguments, fights, rants, think pieces and such, we should all be grateful and embrace it, regardless of the source.\n\nAnd speaking of being grateful, I know itâs an ongoing mantra, but itâs important to repeat: If you really do love music and the writing around it, when you run across a good piece of writing, donât be silent about it. Share it with anyone you think might appreciate it. Let the writer know how much you liked it, especially since they rarely get feedback. Youâre part of the process whether you know it or not, so why not feed it and help it grow?\n\nMatt Daniels, âThe Most Timeless Songs of All Timeâ (Polygraph, August 2015)\n\nAlong with the expert number crunching and dazzling interactive graphics that would make Upshot or FiveThirtyEight jealous, you get some fascinating analysis as Daniels plows through Billboard and Spotify data, figuring out where everyone from Etta James to Daft Punk fit in. And as for perspective, âAccolades, Grammys, and cultural dominance mean nothing to future generations...â and âthe artists who have cult followings and underground appeal: itâs a signal for some undefined musical quality thatâs impossible for a hit song to replicate.â And whatâs the prime example of a truly timeless song? A: âNo Diggityâ by Blackstreet.\n\nEmilie Friedlander, âThe World Doesnât Need More Female Music Criticsâ (Fader, June 2015)\n\nStarting off as a riff on Anwen Crawfordâs piece in The New Yorker âThe World Needs Female Rock Criticsâ (which is also worth your time), Friedlanderâs provocatively-titled piece makes the wise and worthwhile argument that we all need to first appreciate the great women writers who are out there already. In case any editors out there are wondering where to find them, she cites the wonderful âBinders Full of Women Writersâ Facebook group and includes a Google Spreadsheet at the end where other women writers can add their names and contact info. At the time of this writing, itâs up to 265 entries.\n\nEriq Gardner, âAretha Franklin Judge Shows No R.E.S.P.E.C.T. for First Amendment (Analysis)â (Hollywood Reporter, September 2015)\n\nThe mother of all divas can still stir people at age 73 (as she proved recently at the Kennedy Center) but that doesnât always mean that sheâs always on the side of the angels. Reâs attempt to block a documentary sheâs in â but doesnât hold rights to â raises some serious legal issues about the over-reach of artistâs rights and sets a dangerous precedent, just like the âBlurred Linesâ case.\n\nMeaghan Garvey, âThe Evolution of Playing Music In Your Carâ (Complex, February 2015)\n\nGreat idea for an article, isnât it? From hi-fi to FM to cassettes to 8-track tapes to CDâs to MP3 players to satellite radio to streaming services to smartphones/apps, you get to relive this important part of music history and how we experienced a lot of the music we loved... or hated.\n\nSasha Geffen, âThe Sun Kil Moon Problemâ (Consequence of Sound, June 2015)\n\nAny of us who are Sun Kil Moon fans (hand raised here) have to live with the fact that Mr. Kozelek can be a jerk, especially on stage. Green takes him to task for berating women at shows and wonders what the right response from promoters and fans should be.\n\nMarc Hogan, âHave We Reached Peak Vinyl?â (Stereogum, July 2015)\n\nSubtitle: âSome worry the formatâs nearly decade-long revival is a bubble about to burst.â Even with the format making a comeback among hipsters, collectors and audiophiles, vinyl faces many issues, including production problems, production delays, a lack of manufacturing plants and price increases. Nevertheless, some indie labels remain bullish about the format.\n\nPatterson Hood, âThe Southâs Heritage Is So Much More Than a Flagâ (New York Times, July 2015)\n\nIn the wake of the Charleston church shooting in June and the resulting controversy over the Confederate Flag, there are few people who could make a better case for the complex, contradictory nature of Southern culture than the Drive-By Truckersâ frontman. Patterson is the son of a Muscle Shoals band fixture and was born in the same town as blues/jazz avatar W.C. Handy, only a few miles away from where Sun Records founder Sam Phillips was born. While heâs proud of his Southern musical heritage, heâs not blind to the horrible, murderous racist history that came behind it too (his great-great-grandfather fought in the Confederacy).\n\nJessica Hopper, âGals/other marginalized folks: what was your 1st brush (in music industry, journalism, scene) w/ idea that you didnât âcountâ?â (Twitter, August 2015)\n\nAfter one of the best music books of the year (The First Collection of Criticism by a Living Female Rock Critic), Hopper further proves her mettle by starting with a loaded question on Twitter and evolving it into a fascinating, extended conversation, showing the power of that medium that few have mastered, drawing input from other exceptional writers and artists.\n\nSarah Jaffe, âWhy Feminism Needs Punkâ (Dissent, Spring 2015)\n\nDetailing Slits co-founder/guitarist Viv Albertineâs book Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys: A Memoir, Jaffe explores the changes not just of being a girl in a boyâs domain but also how to live a consistently rebellious life after you stop doing music. In so doing, Jaffe makes the point that Albertine shouldnât just be an inspiration to young girls and would-be musicians: âFeminism today could use a punk moment. It has become buttoned-up and sanitized, in thrall to capitalist ideals of success and the endless rehashing of narrow debates.â\n\nMaura Johnston, âWimpy White Dudes With Guitars Ruined American Idolâ (The Concourse, May 2015)\n\nFor any of us who didnât like American Idol but were fascinated by its power, Johnston guides us through its decline, bit by bit. Even past the whole premise of the show, sheâs right to say that the clichÃ©d male divas, questionable judges, questionable winners and competition via YouTube sank the show. Then again, even a ratings bonanza like this is bound to get stale after a while.\n\nJames Stafford, âWill the Grammy for Record of the Year be âThe Record of the Yearâ?â (Diffuser, February 2015)\n\nMany Grammy categories are a joke, but for music fans who do watch the ceremony and like to handicap their favorite acts, youâre always left wondering the hell theyâre talking about with âRecord of The Yearâ (vs. âSong of the Yearâ). So... âthe Record of the Year does not need to be a single, nor does it need to sell well or even make the charts. All that matters is âartistic and technical achievement.ââ And as Stafford reminds us, in Grammy history, many of the greatest records that had the most influence arenât necessary the ones that get the nod. Then again, hindsightâs 20/20, right?\n\nKatherine St. Asaph, âprotips for thinkpieces, pt. 2â (Tumblr, October 2015)\n\nComing off of an Awl piece about why guys are bothered/confused by Joanna Newsom, St. Asaph has a bone to pick with the original articleâs critique. Why canât a writer compare a woman artist to another woman without coming off as sexist? When that happens âit removes from the critical conversation those whose primary reference points for music are women, who unsurprisingly tend to be... other womenâ and âit removes female artists from the critical conversation.â All of which makes you wonder how much good that kind of PC-think actually does when itâs applied all the time.\n\nAllison Stewart, âAlternative nationâs last stand: Lollapalooza 1995, an oral historyâ (Washington Post, August 2015)\n\nStrange to think that itâs so distant now, but the pioneering music festival broke and created so many rules that theyâre ingrained in the touring market now to the extent that itâs hard to appreciate. Seeming to be a communal paradise of the alt-nation and the genres surrounding it, hereâs where it came crashing down thanks to egos and fatigue. Along with the Lolla honchos, we hear the story from Sonic Youth, Jesus Lizard, Pavement, Hole, Sinead OâConnor (who left the tour) and Cypress Hill. There are arrests, band rivalries, sucky shows, line-up changes and more.\n\nJames Trew, âHow Casio accidentally started reggaeâs digital revolutionâ (Engadget, December 2015)\n\nThe fascinating story of how a goofy, cheapo little plastic toy-like keyboard created history not only in reggae but also in hip hop and beyond. The bouncy little rhythm is so cheesy and simple that youâre sure youâve heard it dozens of times (and you probably have). Whatâs more, it took Casio decades to realize they had stumbled upon a goldmine with this tiny preset.\n\nJeff Weiss, âReady To Die: Three Days of Drugs and Disintegration With the Grateful Deadâ (Noisey, August 2015)\n\nIt was a dizzying year for Deadheads. Nothing really captured the messy, odd vibe of their Chicago bow-out better than this extended report (a drug-fueled piece of New Journalism that Dr. Gonzo would appreciate), which includes the authorâs culture blooming into a Deadhead (years after Garcia died) leading up to the bizarre, time-wrapped spectacle of the Deadheads gathering for one last massive tailgate at the âFare Thee Wellâ shows.\n\nRobin Yassin-Kassab, âThe Sound and the Fury: How Syriaâs Rappers, Rockers and Writers Fought Backâ (Guardian, November 2015)\n\nIn the wake of a horrifying civil war that has pit a murderous regime against a bastardized and blood-thirsty Islamic cult, the Syrian people who chose to stay in their country have struggled to maintain their lives by creating their own little communities which are under constant threat. Here, the stories come from a number of artists that ultimately left Syria and tell their story from overseas as they watch others jockey for position in their native land."
