My own translation was made from the copy of the 1634 Sommium at Columbia University, where I have been a member of the University Seminar on the Renaissance for many years. The Columbia University copy, which lacks the title page and dedication, is presumably one of those circulated after 1630 by Jacob Bartsch, Kepler's son-in-law, before the Dream\n\nwas completed in\n\n1634 by Kepler's son, Ludwig.

One such composition, written by Kepler in 1593, dealt\n\nwith the following question: How would the phenomena occurring in the heavens appear to an observer stationed on the moon? Kepler had hit upon this ingenious device in an effort to overcome the deep-rooted hostility to the Copernican astronomy. According to Copernicus, the earth moves very swiftly. But the people who live on the earth do not see or hear or feel this movement. Yet they can watch the moon perform various motions.\n\nThese lunar motions, however, would escape detection by an ob-\n\nserver located on the moon, for the simple reason that he would be participating in those motions. Since the lunar motions would not be apparent to an observer there, by the same token the terrestrial motions are not noticed by observers here. ‘This seems to have been\n\nthe basic theme of Kepler’s 1593 dissertation (see Appendix C).\n\nIt was never presented at a Tübingen disputation, however, because Veit Müller, the professor in charge of those academic exer-\n\ncises, was so unalterably opposed to Copernicanism that he refused\n\nto permit Kepler's theses to be heard.' This rebuff did not dishearten the young student to the point of tearing up his work in disgust and throwing it away. On the contrary, he kept it and\n\nbided his time until he would no longer be under the control of a\n\nreactionary\n\nand\n\nunsympathetic\n\nprofessor.\n\nThis\n\nearliest draft\n\n1. See Kepler's Note 2 on the Dream; and Gesam. Werke, XIII, 39:242-44.\n\nXVI\n\nhas\n\nXVII\n\nIntroduction\n\nnot survived—it was not mentioned in the first catalogue of Kep-\n\nler's manuscripts.?\n\nThat earliest draft was apparently left undisturbed for sixteen\n\nyears, during which\n\nall sorts of things happened\n\nto Kepler, both\n\ngood and bad. Among the good things was his appointment as Imperial Mathematician. In this capacity he lived at Prague, which was then the capital of the Holy Roman Empire. There he became friendly with Wackher von Wackenfels, an official whose hobby was astronomy. The two friends frequently debated a variety of\n\nscientific questions,\n\nsharply\n\nbut amicably.?\n\nAs\n\na consequence\n\nof\n\nsuch a good-natured disagreement Kepler pulled his 1593 student\n\ndissertation out of a drawer and resumed work on it after a lapse of sixteen years.\n\nIn a public letter he remarked:\n\n“Last summer we engaged in\n\nthese discussions to such an extent . . . that... I even founded a new astronomy, as it were, for those who live on the moon and,\n\nto put it plainly, a sort of lunar geography.\" * Kepler's “lunar geography,\" as he calls it here, was written in 1609, since the public letter containing the remark just quoted about “last summer”\n\nbears the date April 19, 1610.5 This second stage of Kepler's work\n\nhas been misdated, presumably because the Dream, or Posthumous\n\nWork on Lunar Astronomy, as it was finally entitled, opens with a reference to the year 1608. But that is the year in which Kepler\n\nimagines an event to have taken place about which 1609.\n\nhe wrote\n\nin\n\nOrdinarily Kepler refers to our book in its final form as the Dream. But in his Note 134 on the Drea he says: “. . . when I wrote the Lunar Astronomy, the declination of the magnet from the meridian was in some repute as though it were suitable for de-\n\ntermining the longitudes\n\nof places everywhere.”\n\nHowever,\n\nWil-\n\nliam Gilbert's Magnet, which was published in 1600 and which was read by Kepler a few years later, caused him to reject magnetic\n\ndeclination as a reliable indicator of the longitude of a vessel in the open water.? Hence, so long as Kepler still believed in an infallible 2. Royal\n\nSociety of London,\n\nPhilosophical\n\nTransactions\n\nprinted, New York: Johnson, 1963). 3.

A manuscript copy of this second stage was taken from Prague in 1611 and involved Kepler in the serious trouble which he recalls in his Note 8 on the Dreaz:. When that trouble finally came to an end, Kepler decided to have the Work printed so that everybody could see how maliciously his ad-\n\nversaries had misinterpreted it while it was still in manuscript. Having\n\ndecided to publish the book, Kepler proceeded\n\nthe 223 explanatory Notes\n\nmentioned\n\nabove, which\n\nto add\n\nare almost\n\nthree times as long as the whole text of the Dream proper. In his heading over the Notes Kepler says that they were “writ-\n\nten in order between the years 1620 and 1630.” As the initial year, however, “1620” must be regarded as a convenient approximation\n\nrather than as a precise determination. The trouble which Kepler recalls in his Note 8 was the legal prosecution of his mother on\n\ncharges of witchcraft. The poor old woman was saved from being put to death, in all probability, only by the steadfast and skillful\n\nintervention of her devoted son, the Imperial Mathematician. Hav-\n\ning obtained his mother’s acquittal, Kepler went home where\n\nhe was then living, in November,\n\nfriend, Matthias Bernegger\n\n1621.\n\nHe\n\nto Linz,\n\nwrote\n\nto his\n\n(1582-1640), on December 4, 1623:\n\n“Two years ago, as soon as I returned to Linz, I began to recast my\n\nLunar Astronomy, or rather to clarify it by means of notes.” 7 Ac-\n\ncording to this statement, then, Kepler started to write the Notes late in 1621, not in 1620. But there are excellent reasons for believing that he felt more inclined to work on the Notes only after the death of his mother on\n\nApril 13, 1622.8 In his Note 8 he speaks of “last year’s journey,” undertaken on his mother’s behalf. Although he began this journey in the closing months of 1620, he himself says about 1621, “I spent the whole\n\nyear on my\n\nmother’s\n\n7. Gesam. Werke, XVIII, 143:9-10. 8. Ibid., 212:572. 9. Frisch, VIII, 878:20.\n\ntrial.” ® Hence\n\nthe reference\n\nin\n\nXX\n\nIntroduction\n\nNote 8 to “last year\" applies to 1621. Accordingly we shall not be far wrong if we conclude that Kepler actually commenced the Notes in 1622 (or at the very earliest, late in 1621) rather than in 1620, the initial year given in the heading over the Notes. The terminal year, 1630, given in the heading, stands on an entirely different footing, since the heading itself was probably composed in that very same year. On April 22, 163o, Kepler wrote from Zagan, where he then had his own printing press, to his friend Philip Müller: “My employees were hampered by my ab-\n\nsence. Therefore, instead of the Ephernerides\n\n[for which Kepler\n\nevidently had to be present in person on account of the greater complexities involved], they printed the Lunar Astronomy, together with the Notes. There are six sheets already.\" ^ Kepler's absence from Zagan, to which he here refers, was caused by a trip\n\nlasting perhaps a month, from early March to early April, 1630. His\n\ncharacteristic habit of constantly introducing changes in his handwritten material '! makes it entirely credible that the closing Notes\n\nwere really written in 1630. At any rate, in Note 179 Kepler mentions his Reply to Jacob Bartsch’s Letter, a work which he composed late in 1628 and published early in 1629.\n\nIf we now glance back briefly over what has already been said, we see that our book was written in three very different periods of Kepler's life. When he was a student at Tübingen, he composed a\n\ndissertation about the moon in 1593. In 1609, when he was engaged in playful astronomical altercations at Prague, he added the Dream framework. Between 1622 and 1630, years darkened by somber tragedy, both personal and national, he drafted the Notes. In 1623,\n\nhe wrote a letter which he later used as the Geographical Appendix to the Dreamz, his Notes on the Geographical Appendix were apparently composed after he moved to Silesia in 1628. In the final version of the Dreamz, therefore, we have a document in which, as\n\nthough it were his swan song, Kepler reviewed the various phases\n\nof his long and turbulent life, and the successive stages in his intellectual development. Nowhere else in such brief compass is to be\n\nfound Kepler’s own account of his stormy career, one of the main\n\npathways leading to that awesome force which is modern science.\n\nWhen\n\ntextbook\n\nBernegger requested him to recommend suitable\n\nfor use in the\n\n10.

This will provide the fare for us who are being chased off the earth [by the Catholic CounterReformation] as we travel or migrate to the moon. To that little book I am appending Plutarch’s Face in the Moon, newly translated [from the Greek] by me.” '? Kepler made these poignant\n\nremarks on March 2, 1629. His were Written in 1630, since in futed an error “26 years ago in On October 8, 1630, Kepler trip. “In the meantime,” we Bartsch,\n\n“he\n\nleft me\n\nNotes on his translation of Plutarch one of them he said that he had remy Optics” of 1604.\" departed from Zagan on a business are told by his son-in-law, Jacob\n\nas supervisor\n\nand\n\ndirector\n\nof the\n\nprinting\n\noperation at Zagan. In accordance with his instructions and with me in charge . . . the major part of his Lunar Astronomy was\n\nprinted. He\n\nhad conceived it long before, and prior to his depar-\n\nture he proofread and enlarged it. On account of the unorthodox speculations included in it, he called it his astronomical Dream. Before [the printing of] it was finished down to the very last word, that greatest of men, who devoted himself to the study of the heavens with a zeal that was virtually miraculous, fell into his very last sleep. . . . In the belief that it would be criminal if the work which had been begun was destroyed, I continued to put . . . the Dream through the press.\" !* How much of the Dreamz was Bartsch able to put through the press? By April 22, 1630, Kepler reported, six sheets of the Dream\n\nwere printed. By October 8, 1630, he had corrected the proofs and added something to the Dream, presumably the Geographical Ap-\n\npendix. After Kepler’s death on November 5/15, 1630, Bartsch fin-\n\nished putting through the press what had been set up in type. This\n\ndid not, however, constitute the complete book. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Dream was ready to be shown to\n\ninterested persons. Thus on May 5, 1631, Bartsch wrote from Luban, his birthplace, to Philip Müller (1585-1659), Kepler's friend and Bartsch's former professor of astronomy at Leipzig University:\n\n12. Gesam.

For on account of his business he has been away\n\nfrom home quite often. . . . Had I not left that one copy at Luban\n\nthen, and were it not here with me now, I would still be unable to send you a copy. For I found that all the other copies had been left\n\nbehind at Zagan in a little box amid that very confusing\n\ndisorder\n\n[caused by the war], while here at Luban I looked for them in vain among the other books. Through my brother, then, you will receive a copy which has lost its freshness through being read by many people here. l'll send you another copy on cleaner paper soon. I have not yet been able to add the title page and dedication.” 13\n\nThen on June 19/29, 1631, Bartsch professor: “You will receive a copy paper . . . from my brother.\" !!

Nevertheless, if it hasn't yet come into your hands, I'll send it to\n\nyou, for I still hope to get it.” !? However, Galileo never saw Kep-\n\nler's Dreanı, so far as we know.\n\nIn 1634 Ludwig Kepler, son of Johannes Kepler and his first Wife,? was in Frankfurt/Main.

Through\n\nthe efforts of a son striving to enhance his deceased father's reputa-\n\ntion, Kepler's Dream, having acquired the requisite title page and dedication at Frankfurt, was finally published as a complete book\n\nIn 1634.74 To\n\nGalileo’s correspondent,\n\nGiovanni\n\nPieroni, we\n\nmay\n\nrecall,\n\nKepler’s Dream seemed “strange and bizarre.” A biographer of Kepler considered it a satire (presumably on the basis of Kepler’s\n\nNote 56 on the Dream).\n\nSuch reactions explain why the Latin\n\ntext has been reprinted only once, and why even partial translations were so long delayed. Ihe Dream was not the only book in which Kepler covered his contributions to science with unconventional wrappings repulsive to many readers. But the greatest minds\n\nof the succeeding generations tore these wrappings apart and benefited from Kepler's discoveries. In those days acknowledgment of\n\nsuch indebtedness was not the universal practice. To track down the influence of Kepler's Dream on the soaring scientific advances\n\nof the later seventeenth century would throw added light on the tortuous process by which the modern mind came into being. 20. Susanna Reuttinger became Ludwig Kepler's stepmother by marrying Johannes Kepler as his second wife on October 3o, 1613 (Caspar, Kepler, tr. and ed. Hellman, p. 222; Frisch, VIII, 809:6-7).\n\n21. Of the children born to Johannes Kepler and his second wife, only four\n\nsurvived their father's death in 1630.\n\n22. The prices of many common commodities and the wages of certain catego-\n\nries of workers, in southern Moravia, mainly during the years 1627-1633—midway in the Thirty Years? War—have been extracted from material in the archives at Krumlov (Kromau) by Erich Sloschek, “Lebensmittelpreise während des Dreissig-\n\njährigen Krieges,” Deutscher Verein für die Geschichte Mährens und Schlesiens, Leitschrift (1935), 37:161-63. 23.

But I do not know what omen this dream brought with it. To us, his children, it certainly was very mournful, although for him the outcome of this omen was pleasant enough, even greatly desired. For when this Dream was written and in press, my father fell into a\n\nsleep (alas!) that was heavy, or rather fatal. His soul flew above the lunar to the ethereal region (we hope) and left us, his children,\n\nnot only exposed to the wounds of war and the miseries of this life but almost destitute of all worldly wealth.?

Kepler died while he was on a trip undertaken in an unsuccessful effort to collect the interest due him on two promissory notes, which he held in exchange for money that he had deposited at 6 per cent interest in the Treasury of the Estates of Upper Austria.\n\n6\n\nThe\n\nDream\n\nthe Dream was undertaken by Jacob Bartsch, M.D., my very famous and learned brother-in-law, who was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Strasbourg. But he too was stricken by a fatal disease and died before the work was finished. In the meantime I returned to Germany from a trip which I had taken with a certain Austrian baron.’ For two years I had heard no news about the condition of my relatives. From Frankfurt I wrote to them in Lusatia to let me know whether they were still alive and how they were faring. Lo and behold, my stepmother, an impoverished widow with four orphans, comes to me at a turbulent\n\ntime and in a place most inconvenient on account of the high cost of living.

Yet it was taken literally by at least one reader, who must have overlooked Ludwig Kepler's\n\nprevious statement that, like his father, his brother-in-law, too, was stricken\n\nby a\n\nfatal disease. On June 19, 1677, Gerard de Vries (1648-1705), professor of philosophy and theology at Utrecht University, delivered a lecture on moon-dwellers, in which\n\nhe said:\n\n“[The\n\nDream]\n\nwas\n\nKepler's\n\nlast work\n\non\n\nearth,\n\nand\n\nbefore\n\nhe\n\ncould publish it, he himself was shrouded in perpetual darkness. Kepler's son-inlaw, Jacob\n\nBartsch, a most\n\nfervent supporter\n\nof his father-in-law's\n\nopinions,\n\nhad\n\nscarcely undertaken to continue the publication when he, too, was swept away by death. . . . Since\n\nthese\n\ndevelopments\n\nwidow\n\nwith children, and\n\nson, he could scarcely be convinced burdened\n\nwere\n\nfamiliar to Ludwig\n\nKepler,\n\nJohannes'\n\nby the appeals of his stepmother,\n\nby his regard\n\na poor\n\nfor his father's reputation,\n\nto\n\nlift a finger to complete the printing of the book, which had been begun. He was frightened (as he himself admits) by the unexpected death of his father and brother-in-law, and he was afraid that, together with them, he would\n\nbe banished\n\nto the moon.” The foregoing passage was printed by De Vries when he added his own Dissertatio de lunicolis to his edition of Daniel Voet's Physiology (ed. Utrecht, 1678, pp. 268-69; ed. Utrecht, 1688, pp. 253-54).\n\nDe Vries’ comments about Ludwig Kepler's fear that if he undertook to finish\n\nthe printing of the Dream, it would\n\nfinish him, would\n\nundoubtedly\n\nhave attracted\n\nless attention had they not been repeated by a widely read author who enjoyed an immense reputation. Pierre Bayle (1647-1706) took De Vries quite seriously in the\n\narticle\n\non\n\nJohannes\n\nKepler\n\nin his famous\n\nDictionaire\n\nhistorique\n\net critique\n\n(Rotterdam, 1697, II, 231-32). By passing through many editions in the original French as well as in translation, Bayle’s Historical and Critical Dictionary broadcast De Vries’ aspersions on Ludwig Kepler very widely.\n\nThe Dream\n\n7\n\nenhance this reputation by his own talent, he should nevertheless preserve it to the best of his ability. Hence I could not refuse this request, but instead I have made it my goal.’\n\nYet a patron is still lacking for this work. Surely one will hardly\n\nbe found among the military. They are now little interested in the\n\nastronomy of the lunar ball, being rather compelled to watch out lest they be blown to bits or injured by musketballs and cannonballs. ‘Therefore I could find no one worthier than you, Most Illustrious Prince, whose patronage this work might enjoy. You are\n\nhighly proficient in the study of mathematics;* you are far re-\n\n5. This expression of Ludwig Kepler’s attitude was correctly emphasized by Abraham Gotthelf Kastner (1719-1800), the historian of mathematics and poet, as the effective answer to De Vries (Geschichte der Mathematik, Gottingen, 17961800, IV, 307). 6. 'The proficiency attained by Philip of Hesse-Butzbach in mathematical studies\n\nmay\n\nbe seen in the letter which\n\n(Gesam.\n\nWerke, XVIII,\n\nical observations to the wanted Kepler's advice and less labor.

Philip also in solving spherical triangles with greater precision reply Kepler recalled that he had previously shown the of computing, as well as the difficulties hindering the per-\n\nfection of observational instruments (Gesam. Werke, XVIII, 148:13-23). In his Note 179 on the Dream, Kepler referred to the Landgrave’s sunspot observations, which he described in another work (see fn. 303 on Kepler’s Note 179). Kepler transferred these observations from a flat surface to a three-dimensional sphere when he visited Butzbach, October 6-19, 1627 (Walther, Arch. f. bess. Gesch. u. Alt., 11:369; Frisch, VIII, 909:27-28). In his Admonition to Astronomers Concerning the Rare and Remarkable Phenomena of the Year 1631 (Leipzig, 1629; Frankfurt/Main, 1630), Kepler called attention to the chromatic aberration produced by the lenses in telescopes used for observing sunspots, and then addressed the Landgrave as follows: “Your simple tube without lenses will, I am sure, not be idle. It 1s\n\nso constructed that on its white screen it can show this round\n\nspot’s diameter\n\nquite conveniently measurable even with a pair of compasses. Then, if to this measurement is applied the diameter of the aperture through which the sun’s rays are admitted, the result will be absolutely correct and free from the distortion which is caused by the lower concave lens in a telescope\" (Frisch, VII, 594:1016).\n\nThe Landgrave was not concerned exclusively with celestial problems. In the spring of 1625, for example, he transmitted to the Tubingen professor Wilhelm Schickard (1592-1635) a “Roman foot” which had been brought from Rome, “and he indicated that there it was regarded as the true ancient” measure (Epistolae W. Schickarti et M. Berneggeri mutuae, p. 43). Feeling that the procedures\n\nof land-surveyors were\n\nerroneous in some\n\nrespects, the Landgrave\n\npublished\n\na\n\nHighly Necessary and Basic Reform of Some Harmful Errors Which Have Gradually Crept into tbe General Practice of Land Surveying (Hochnötige unnd gründliche Reformation etlicher in gemeinem ublichem Feldmessen nach und nach eingeschliechener schädlicher Irrtbumbe, Giessen, 1625).\n\n8\n\nThe\n\nDream\n\nmoved from the turmoil of war;7 and you favored my father, while he was still alive, with your very kind patronage.\" Hence the orphans, with firm faith, trust that you will not deny your patronage to them and to this work.” Through me they humbly commend themselves and this Dream to your Most Illustrious Highness. With most zealous prayers they beseech almighty God graciously to deign to preserve your Most Illustrious Highness, together with your Most Illustrious Spouse,\" sound in body and mind, and to avert every hostile attack and military molestation from your domain. 7. Although Philip of Hesse-Butzbach tried valiantly to safeguard his realm from the horrors of war, the damage actually inflicted is vividly exemplified in the report printed by Walther, Arch. f. bess. Gesch. u. Alt., 11:359-61. 8. In a discussion with the Landgrave, Kepler must have communicated hıs en-\n\nthusiasm for logarithms, which had recently been invented, and he presented his\n\nown ideas on the subject\n\nhis Thousand Logarithms\n\n(Gesam.\n\nWerke, XVIII,\n\n(Marburg,\n\n131:38-39). Then, in dedicating\n\n1624) to Philip, Kepler humorously pointed\n\nout in a punning poem that the book’s thirty propositions balanced the Landgrave’s gift to him of thirty pieces of silver (Gresam. Werke, XVIII, 151:145-46; IX, 277, 279:18). Presumably this gift was one of the “benefactions” which Kepler had received from Philip in 1621, and which he recalled six years later in a letter addressed to Philip's nephew, George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt (Gesam.\n\nWerke, XVIII, 323:44-45). Philip gave Kepler fifty more silver Reichstalers in gratitude for the dedication, and suggested that Kepler should explain how to use the logarithms (Gesam. Werke, XVIII, 214:11-14; Walther, Arch. f. bess. Gesch.\n\nu. Alt., 11:370-71). This explanation, Kepler's Supplement to tbe Thousand Logaritbms (Marburg, 1625), was likewise published at the expense of the Landgrave, to whom it was dedicated (Gesam. Werke, XVIII, No. 1006:18-27; IX, 353). In 1629 Kepler \"extolled the truly generous prince and the bountifulness with which he far overcame the harshness of these times and my original reluctance.

There is no evidence that Philip of Hesse-Butzbach extended his patronage to the Dream. Pointing in the opposite direction is Ludwig Kepler's statement on the title page that the work was \"printed . . . at the expense of the author's heirs.\" 10. After the death of his first wife, Philip of Hesse-Butzbach married Christina Sophia, marchioness of East Friesland, on June 2, 1632 (Walther, Arch. f. bess.\n\nGesch. u.

Their\n\nactions universally recalled precedents found in Bohemian history. Stimulated by the widespread public interest, I turned my attention to reading about Bohemia, and came upon the story of\n\nthe heroine Libussa,'* renowned for her skill in magic. It happened\n\none night that after watching the stars and the moon, I went to bed and fell into a very deep sleep. In my sleep I seemed to be reading a book brought from the fair. Its contents were as follows. My\n\nname is Duracotus\n\n(1). My\n\ncountry 1s Iceland\n\n(2), which\n\nthe ancients called Thule.» My mother was Fiolxhilde (3).

Just as the rule of the Emperor\n\nRudolph\n\nwas challenged by his younger\n\nbrother Matthias, so Libussa, a female ruler of the Bohemians, faced an uprising by\n\nmales. This tale was lovingly told and retold by narrators of that people's history. Yet it is tempting to think that Kepler “came upon the story of the heroine Libussa,\" third ruler of the Bohemian people, at pp. 4-7 in the first complete edi-\n\ntion (Hanau, 1607) of the Bohemian Chronicle by the earliest Czech historian, Cosmas of Prague (d. 1125).

This unqualified identification of ancient Thule with Iceland was later modified by Kepler: “Scholars deny that our Iceland is ancient Thule, but they point\n\neither to the Shetlands or to Telemark, a district in Norway\" p. 169; Frisch, VIII, 119: 12-11 up).

Condemned by these laws, not a few persons (8)\n\nhave perished in the chasms of Hekla (9). My mother never told me my father’s name\n\n(10). But she said he was a fisherman who\n\ndied at the ripe old age of 150 (when I was three) in about the sev-\n\nentieth year of his marriage (11). In the earliest years of my boyhood my mother, leading me by the hand and sometimes hoisting me up on her shoulders, often used to take me up to the lower slopes of Mt. Hekla (12). These\n\nexcursions were made especially around St. John’s Day, when the\n\nsun is visible all twenty-four hours, and there is no night (13). Gathering some herbs with many rites, she cooked them at home\n\n(14). She made little bags out of goatskin, which she filled and carried to a nearby port to sell to the ship captains (15). This is how\n\nshe earned her living. Once, out of curiosity, I cut a bag open. Suspecting nothing, my mother was about to sell it, when out fell the herbs and linen cloth\n\nembroidered with various symbols\n\n(16). Because I had deprived\n\nher of this little income, she angrily made me, instead of the bag, the property of the skipper in order to keep the money. On the next day he unexpectedly sailed out of the harbor, and with a favorable wind steered approximately toward Bergen in Norway (17). After a few days a north wind sprang up (18) and drove the ship between Norway and England. He headed for Denmark and\n\npassed through the strait, since he had to deliver a letter from a bishop in Iceland to the Dane, Tycho Brahe (19), who lived on the\n\nisland of Hven. The tossing of the boat and the unaccustomed warmth of the air (20) made me violently sick, for I was a youth of fourteen. When the boat reached shore, he put me and the letter\n\nin the hands of an island fisherman (21). Expressing the hope that he would return, he sailed away.\n\nWhen I delivered the letter, Brahe was quite delighted and began to ask me many questions (22).!9 These I did not understand,\n\nsince I was unacquainted with the language except for a few words\n\n(23). He therefore instructed his students, whom he supported in\n\ngreat numbers 16.

I was no less ready to talk than they\n\nwere to ask. For I marveled at many unfamiliar things, and they wondered about the many novelties I related about my country. Finally the skipper returned to take me back. When he failed, I was very happy (26). I was delighted beyond measure by the astronomical activities,\n\nfor Brahe and his students watched the moon and the stars all night with marvelous instruments (27). This practice reminded me of\n\nmy mother, because she, too, used to commune with the moon constantly (28). Through this opportunity, then, I, who had come from an entirely destitute background in a half-savage country, acquired knowledge of the most divine science, and this knowledge paved\n\nmy way to greater things.\n\nFor, after spending several years on this island, I was finally overcome by a desire to see my country again. I considered that it would not be hard for me, with the knowledge I had acquired, to\n\nrise to some position of importance among my backward people.\n\nHence,\n\nhaving paid my\n\nrespects to my\n\npatron, who\n\npermission to depart, I went to Copenhagen.\n\ngave me his\n\nI found\n\ntraveling\n\ncompanions, who gladly took me under their protection because of my familiarity with the language and the region. Five years after I had left, I returned to my native land. What delighted me first on my return was to find my mother still active and engaged in the very same pursuits as before. The fact that I was alive and important put an end to her prolonged\n\ngrief over the son she had lost through her impetuosity. At that\n\ntime autumn was approaching (29), to be followed by those long nights of ours, since during the month in which Christ was born\n\nthe sun barely rises at noon and sets again at once\n\n(30). On ac-\n\ncount of this interruption in her work my mother clung to me and did not leave my side, no matter where I went with my letter of recommendation. Sometimes she asked about the countries which I had visited, and sometimes about the heavens. She was deliriously happy that I had become acquainted with that science. Comparing\n\nwhat she had learned with my remarks (31), she exclaimed that now she was ready to die, since she was leaving behind a son who would inherit her knowledge, the only thing she possessed (32).\n\n14\n\nThe Dream Since I am by nature most eager to acquire new knowledge, I, in\n\nturn, questioned her about her arts and her teachers of those arts\n\namong a people so remote from all the others. Then one day,\n\nchoosing the time for her narrative, she went over the whole story from the very beginning, about as follows:\n\nAdvantages have been conferred, Duracotus my on all those other regions to which you went but also try, too. To be sure, we are burdened with cold and other discomforts, which I feel only now, after I have you about the salubriousness of the other lands.\n\nson, not only on our coundarkness and learned from But we have\n\nplenty of clever persons (33). At our service are very wise spirits (34.), who detest the bright light of the other lands and their noisy\n\npeople. They long for our shadows, and they talk to us intimately. Among them there are nine chief spirits (35). Of these, one is especially well known to me (36). The very gentlest and most innocuous of all (37), he is evoked by one and twenty characters (38). By his help I am not infrequently whisked in an instant to other shores (39), whichever I mention to him; or if I am frightened\n\naway from some of them on account of their distance (40), by in-\n\nquiring about them I gain as much as if I were there in person (41).\n\nMost of the things which you saw with your own eyes or learned by hearsay or absorbed from books, he related to me just as you did. I should like you to become my companion on a visit, particularly, to that region of which he has spoken to me so often. Quite remarkable are the things which he tells about it. The name she\n\nuttered was \"Levania\" (42).\n\nWithout any delay I agreed that she should summon I sat down, ready to hear the entire plan for the trip tion of the region. It was already spring. The moon, crescent, began to shine as soon as the sun set below\n\nher teacher. and descripbecoming a the horizon,\n\nand was in conjunction with the planet Saturn in the sign of the Bull (43). My mother went away from me (44) to the nearest crossroads (45). Raising a shout, she pronounced just a few words (46) 1n which she couched her request. Having completed the\n\nceremonies, she returned (47). With the outstretched palm of her right hand she commanded silence, and sat down beside me (48). Hardly had we covered our heads with our clothing (49) (in accordance with our covenant) when the rasping of an indistinct\n\nThe\n\nDream\n\n-\n\nand unclear voice became audible (50). It began at once as follows, albeit in the Icelandic tongue.\n\nTbe\n\nDaemon\n\n($1)\n\nfrom\n\nLevania\n\n(52)\n\nFifty thousand German miles (53) up in the ether lies (54) the\n\nisland of Levania. The road to it from here or from it to this earth is seldom open (55). When it is open, it is easy for our kind (56),\n\nbut for transporting men it is assuredly most difficult and fraught with the greatest danger to life (57). We admit to this company\n\nnobody who is lethargic, fat, or choose those who spend their horsemanship or often sail to hardtack, garlic, dried fish, and\n\ntender (58).!* On the contrary, we time in the constant practice of the Indies, inured to subsisting on unappetizing victuals (59). We es-\n\npecially like dried-up old women (60), experienced from an early age in riding he-goats at night or forked sticks or threadbare cloaks, and in traversing immense\n\nexpanses of the earth. No\n\nmen\n\nfrom Germany are acceptable; we do not spurn the firm bodies of\n\nSpaniards (61). Great as the distance is, the entire trip is consummated in four hours at the most (62). For we are always very busy, and agree\n\nnot to start (63) until the moon begins to be eclipsed on its eastern\n\nside.*® Should it regain its full light while we are still in transit, our\n\ndeparture becomes futile. Because the opportunity is so fleeting, we\n\ntake few human\n\nbeings along, and only those who\n\nare most\n\nde-\n\nvoted to us (64). Some man of this kind, then, we seize as a group and all of us, pushing from underneath, lift him up into the heavens\n\n17. The preferred body type would be thin, made so by constant physical exercise or by a lean diet. The autobiographical reference is unmistakable, even though Kepler once described himself as “like a tender household puppy.” For he\n\nwent on at once to say that his “body is agile, dry, and well proportioned. His diet\n\nis certainly just like that, for he loves to gnaw on bones and hard bread crusts.\n\n. . . He drinks little, and is satisfied even with the cheapest foods\" (Frisch, V, 483:3-6). “I enjoy the taste of bitter and sour things. I take pleasure in walking over rough ground, up hills, and through thickets. Apart from my studies, I neither have nor desire the spices of life, and when they are offered to me, I reject them,\" he told his patron, Herwart von Hohenburg, the Chancellor of Bavaria (Gesam. Werke, XIII, 311:257-60; cf. XVII, 86:258). 18. The very busy daemons remind us of Kepler's remark that \"he was annoyed at the waste of the smallest amount of time\" (Frisch, V, 477:26 up).\n\n16\n\nThe\n\nDream\n\n(65). In every instance the take-off hits him as a severe shock (66), for he is hurled just as though he had been shot aloft by gunpowder to sail over mountains and seas (67). For this reason at the\n\noutset he must be lulled to sleep immediately with narcotics and opiates (68). His limbs must be arranged (69) in such a way that his torso will not be torn away from his buttocks nor his head from his body, but the shock will be distributed among his individual\n\nlimbs. Then a new difficulty follows: extreme cold (70) and impeded breathing (71). The cold is relieved by a power which we are born with\n\n(72); the breathing, by applying damp\n\nsponges to\n\nthe nostrils (73). After the first stage of the trip is finished, the pas-\n\nsage becomes easier (74). At that time we expose their bodies to\n\nthe open air and remove our hands (75). Their bodies roll themselves up, like spiders, into balls which we carry along almost entirely by our will alone (76),” so that finally the bodily mass pro-\n\nceeds toward its destination of its own\n\naccord\n\n(77).” But this\n\nonward drive is of very little use to us, because it is too late (78). Hence it is by our will, as I said, that we move the body swiftly along, and we forge ahead of it from now on lest it suffer any harm\n\nby colliding very hard with the moon. When the humans wake up,\n\nthey usually complain about an indescribable weariness of all their\n\nlimbs, from which they later recover well enough to walk (79).\n\nMany additional difficulties arise which it would be tedious to enumerate. On the other hand, we suffer no harm at all. For as a\n\ngroup we inhabit the earth’s shadows (80), whatever their length.\n\nWhen they reach Levania, there we are as though disembarking from a ship and going ashore (81). Up there we quickly withdraw into caves and dark places (82), lest after a short while the sun\n\noverpower us in the open, and drive us out of the living quarters we had chosen, and force us to follow the retreating shadow (83). Up there we are granted leisure to exercise our minds in ac-\n\ncordance with our inclinations. We consult with the daemons of that area and enter into a Jeague. As soon as a spot begins to be free\n\nfrom sun (84), we close ranks and move out into the shadow. If it 19. Kepler's use of stu here and in his Note 76 resembles his use of that word\n\nin the Epitome (Gesam. Werke, VII, 296:27) and in the Cosmographic Mystery (Gesam. Werke, VII, 93:44).\n\n20. For Kepler’s contribution\n\ninertia, see Appendix I.\n\nto the development\n\nsecond\n\nof the modern\n\nedition\n\nof the\n\nprinciple of\n\nThe Dream\n\n17\n\ntouches the earth with its apex, as generally happens (85), we rush\n\ntoward the earth with our allied forces.?' This we are permitted to do only when mankind sees the sun in eclipse. Hence it happens that solar eclipses are feared so much (86). I have said enough about the trip to Levania. Next I shall talk about the nature of the region itself, starting like the geographers with its view of the heavens.\n\nThe fixed stars look the same to all Levania as to us (87). But its\n\nview of the movements\n\nand sizes of the planets is very different\n\nfrom what we observe here, so that its entire system of astronomy\n\nIs quite diverse.\n\nJust as our geographers divide up the sphere of the earth into\n\nfive zones on the basis of celestial phenomena, so Levania consists of two hemispheres (88). One of these, the Subvolva, always enjoys its Volva, which among them takes the place of our moon. The other one, the Privolva (89), 1s deprived forever of the sight\n\nof Volva (90). The circle which separates the hemispheres passes\n\nthrough the celestial poles, like our solstitial colure, and is called\n\nthe divisor (91).\n\nIn the first place I shall explain what is common to both hemispheres. All Levania experiences the succession of day and night as\n\nwe do (92), but they lack the variation that goes on all year among us (93). For throughout the whole of Levania the days are almost\n\nexactly equal to the nights, except that each day is uniformly shorter than its night for the Privolvans, and for the Subvolvans\n\nlonger (94). What varies in a period of eight years will be men-\n\ntioned later on. To produce equal nights at each of the poles, the sun is hidden half the time and shines half the time ?? as it travels\n\naround the mountains ?? in a circle (95). For Levania seems to its\n\ninhabitants to remain just as motionless among the moving stars as\n\ndoes our earth to us humans\n\n(96). A night and a day, taken to-\n\ngether, equal one of our months, since at sunrise in the morning al-\n\nmost an entire additional sign of the zodiac appears on any day as compared with the previous day (97). For us in one year there are 21. These “allied forces\" are “the daemons of that area,\" the moon. :2. As Kepler later explains (p. 18, below), the alternation of summer tcr “is scarcely felt near the equator,” whereas it \"is felt much more\n\nand winnear the\n\npoles, where the sun is present or absent in alternating periods of six months.\"\n\n23. At regular intervals the mountains Kepler's lunar observers.\n\non the moon\n\ncome\n\nbetween\n\nthe sun and\n\n18\n\nThe\n\nDream\n\n365 revolutions of the sun, and 366 of the sphere of the fixed stars,\n\nor more accurately, in four years, 1461 revolutions of the sun but\n\n1465 of the sphere of the fixed stars. Similarly, for them the sun revolves 12 times in one year and the sphere of the fixed stars 13 times, or more precisely, in eight years the sun revolves 99 times and the sphere of the fixed stars 107 times. But they are more famil-\n\niar with the nineteen-year cycle, for in that interval the sun rises\n\n235 times, but the fixed stars 254 times (98). The\n\nsun rises for the middle\n\nor central Subvolvans\n\nwhen\n\nthe\n\nmoon appears to us in its last quarter,?* but for the middle Privolvans when we have the first quarter. What I say about the middle must be understood as applying to complete semicircles drawn through the poles and the middle at right angles to the divisor.\n\nThese may be called the Midvolvan semicircles (99).\n\nHalfway between the poles there is a circle corresponding to our terrestrial equator, by which name it too may be denoted. It twice intersects both the divisor and the Midvolva in opposite points. At all places on the equator the sun at noon passes almost exactly overhead daily, and exactly overhead on two opposite days of the year. For all the others, who live on either side of the equator toward the poles, the sun deviates from the zenith at noon (100). On Levania.they have also some alternation of summer and winter. But the contrast is not to be compared with ours, nor does it always occur, as with us, in the same places at the same time of year. For within a period of ten years their summer shifts from one part of the sidereal year to the opposite part in any given place.\n\nThe reason is that in a cycle of nineteen sidereal years, or 235\n\nLevanian days, summer occurs winter just as often, but forty year they * have six summer months (102). This alternation\n\ntwenty times near the poles and times at the cquator (101). Every days, the others winter, like our is scarcely felt near the equator,\n\nbecause in those places the sun deviates no more than 5° back and\n\n24. Exactly the opposite is true: the sun rises for the mid-Subvolvans when the\n\nmoon appears to us in its first quarter, not in its last quarter. The mid-Subvolvans believe that the hour is midnight when the moon is new for us (see Kepler's Note 111). Hence for them the sun rises when the moon, as seen from the earth, enters its first quarter. 25. Kepler's illos refers to the moon-dwellers, not to the poles, which have only two days a year, one summer and the other winter, each six months long.\n\nThe Dream\n\n19\n\nforth to either side. It is felt much more near the poles, where the sun is present or absent in alternating periods of six months,\n\nas is\n\nthe case among us on earth for those who live near either of the poles. Hence the sphere of Levania, too, is divided into five zones,\n\ncorresponding somewhat to our terrestrial zones. But their tropical\n\nzone, like their arctic zones, contains scarcely 10°. All the rest belongs to zones similar to our temperate zones (103). The tropical zone passes through the middle of the hemispheres, with half of its\n\nlongitude in the Subvolva and the other half in the Privolva.\n\nThe intersections of the equatorial and zodiacal circles create four cardinal points, like our equinoxes and solstices. These inter-\n\nsections mark the start of the zodiacal circle (104). But from this start the motion of the fixed stars in the order of the signs is very\n\nswift, since they traverse the entire zodiac in twenty tropical years (a tropical year being defined as one summer and one winter). For us this traversing takes almost 26,000 years (105). So much for the first motion. The theory of the second motions is for them no less different from what appears to us, and is much more complicated for them\n\nthan for us. The reason is that all six planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,\n\nsun, Venus, Mercury) exhibit, besides the many inequalities which they have in common with us, three others for them. Two of these irregularities are in longitude; one is daily, the other has a period of eight and a half years. The third is in latitude, with a period of nineteen years. For the mid-Privolvans have the sun at their noon, other things being equal, bigger than when it rises, and the Subvolvans smaller (106). Both agree in believing that the sun diverges by some minutes from the ecliptic back and forth now\n\namong these fixed stars, now among those (107). These oscillations\n\nreturn to the original position, as I said, in a period of nineteen years. Yet this deviation takes a little more time for the Privolvans,\n\na little less for the Subvolvans (108). And although the sun and the\n\nfixed stars are assumed to advance uniformly in the first motion around Levania, nevertheless, the sun barely progresses in relation to the fixed stars at noon for the Privolvans, whereas for the Subvolvans it is very fast at noon. The reverse is true at midnight. Hence the sun seems to make, as it were, certain jumps in relation\n\nto the fixed stars, separate jumps every day (109).\n\n20\n\nThe\n\nDream\n\nThe same statements hold true for Venus,\n\nMercury,\n\nand Mars;\n\nin the cases of Jupiter and Saturn, these phenomena are almost ımperceptible (110).\n\nFurthermore the diurnal motion is not uniform even at the same hour every day. On the contrary, it is slower at times not only for the sun but also for all the fixed stars, while at the opposite season of the year at the like hour of the day it is faster (111). Moreover, that retardation shifts throughout the days of the year, so that sometimes it occurs on a summer day, sometimes on a winter day, which in another year had experienced the acceleration, one cycle being completed in a period of a little less than nine years (112). Hence the day sometimes becomes longer (through a natural retardation, not as with us on the earth through the unequal division of the natural day), and sometimes the might, in turn, be-\n\ncomcs longer (113)\n\nBut if the retardation occurs for the Privolvans during their night, its excess over their day is increased; on the other hand, if the retardation falls in their day time, then their night and day approach more closely to equality, which is reached once in nine\n\nyears. The converse is true for the Subvolvans (114).\n\nSo much for the phenomena common to the hemispheres.\n\nThe Hemisphere\n\nwhich\n\nin a certain way happen in\n\nof the Privolvans\n\nNow as for what concerns the individual hemispheres separately, there 1s an enormous contrast between them. By its presence and absence Volva gives rise to quite different spectacles. Not only that, but the common phenomena themselves produce very divergent effects on the two sides. As a result, the Privolvans’ hemisphere may perhaps more properly be called non-temperate, and the Subvolvans’, temperate. For among the Privolvans night lasts fifteen or sixteen of our natural days. It is made frightful bv as deep in uninterrupted darkness as we have on a moonless night, since it never receives any light even from Volva’s rays . Consequently evervthing turns stiff with ice and frost (115). abetted by very sharp and very strong winds (116). Day follows, as long as fourteen of our day s or a little less (117). During this time the sun\n\nThe\n\nDream\n\n21\n\nis quite large (118), and moves slowly with respect to the stars (119). There are no winds (120). The result is immense And thus, in the interval of our month or the Levanian day, and the same place is exposed both to heat fifteen times hotter our African, and to cold more unbearable than the Quiviran.??\n\nfixed heat. one than\n\nIt should be especially noted that the planet Mars sometimes ap-\n\npears almost twice as big to the Privolvans as to us (121); to the mid-Privolvans this happens at midnight, and to the other Privol-\n\nvans at some particular moment of the night for each.\n\nThe Hemisphere\n\nof the Subvolvans\n\nIn making the transition to this topic, I begin with the frontiers-\n\nmen who inhabit the divisor circle. What is peculiar to them 1s that the elongations of Venus and Mercury from the sun seem much bigger to them than to us (122). Moreover, at certain times Venus\n\nlooks twice as big to them as to us (123), especially to those of them who live near the north pole (124).\n\nBut the most beautiful of all the sights on Levania 1s the view of its Volva. This they enjoy to make up for our moon, of which\n\nthey and likewise the Privolvans are completely deprived\n\n(125).\n\nFrom the perennial presence of this Volva this region is termed the Subvolvan, just as from the absence of Volva the other region is called the Privolvan, because they are deprived of the sight of Volva. To us?” who inhabit the earth, our moon, when it is full and rising and climbing above distant houses, seems equal to the rim of\n\na keg; when it mounts to mid-heaven, it hardly matches the width\n\nof the human face. But to the Subvolvans, their Volva in midheaven (a position which it occupies for those who live in the center or navel of this hemisphere) looks a little less than four times longer in diameter than our moon does to us. Hence, if the disks are compared, their Volva is fifteen times larger than our moon (126). However, to those for whom Volva always clings to the\n\nhorizon, it presents the appearance of a mountain on fire far away.\n\nConsequently, just as we differentiate between regions according\n\n26. See Appendix J. | 27. Reading Nobis instead of Notis (1634 Somnium, p. 16).\n\n22\n\nThe\n\nDream\n\nto the greater and smaller altitudes of the pole, even though we do\n\nnot see the pole itself with our eyes, so this same function 1s per-\n\nformed for them by Volva, which, although it is always visible, differs in altitude from place to place. For, as I said, Volva stands directly over the heads of some of them; in other places it is seen low down near the horizon; and for the rest its altitude varies from the zenith to the horizon, while re-\n\nmaining forever constant in any given area (127). Yet they, too, have their own\n\npoles\n\n(128). These\n\nare located,\n\nnot at those fixed stars where our celestial poles are (129), but\n\naround other stars which for us mark the poles of the ecliptic. These poles of the moon-dwellers in a period of nineteen years\n\ntraverse small circles around the poles of the ecliptic (130) in the\n\nconstellation of the Dragon and, at the other extremity, in the Swordfish (Dorado), Sparrow (Flying Fish), and the Greater Nebula. Since these poles of the moon-dwellers are about a quadrant’s distance from their Volva, their regions can be delimited\n\nboth according to the poles and according to Volva (131). Hence\n\nit is clear how much more convenient their situation is than ours. For they indicate the longitude of places with reference to their\n\nmotionless Volva\n\n(132), and the latitude with reference both to\n\nVolva and to the poles (133), whereas for longitudes we have nothing but that most lowly and barely perceptible declination of\n\nthe magnet (134).\n\nTheir Volva remains fixed in place, then, as though it were attached to the heavens with a nail. Above it the other heavenly bodies, including the sun, move from east to west (135). There is never a night in which some of the fixed stars in the zodiac do not\n\npass behind this Volva and emerge again on the other side (136). But the same fixed stars do not do so every night (137). All those which are within a distance of 6° or 7° from the ecliptic take turns (138). The cycle is completed in nineteen years, after which the first stars return (139).\n\nTheir Volva waxes and wanes no less than our moon does (140). In both cases the cause is the same: the presence of the sun or its\n\ndeparture. The length of time involved is also the same, if you look\n\nto nature. But they measure it in one way, and we in another. They consider a day and a night the interval in which their Volva\n\nThe Dream\n\n23\n\npasses through all its waxings and wanings. This is the interval which we call a month. On account of its size and brilliance Volva is practically never, not even at new Volva, hidden from the\n\nSubvolvans (141). This is true in particular for those who live near\n\nthe poles and are deprived of the sun during that time. For them Volva turns its horns upward at noon in the inter-Volvan period\n\n(142). For in general, for those who live between Volva?® and\n\nthe poles on the mid-Volvan circle, new Volva is the sign of noon;\n\nthe first quarter, of evening; full Volva, of midnight; ?? the last quarter, of returning sunlight (143). For those who have Volva as\n\nwell as the poles located on the horizon and who live at the inter-\n\nsection of the equator with the divisor, morning or evening occurs\n\nat new Volva and full Volva, noon or midnight at the quarters. Let these remarks provide the basis for conclusions regarding those\n\nwho live in between (144).\n\nIn the daytime, too, they distinguish the hours in this way ac-\n\ncording to the various phases of their Volva; for example,\n\nthe\n\ncloser the approach of the sun and Volva to each other, the nearer is noon for the mid-Volvans, and evening or sunset for those at the\n\nequator. But at night, which regularly lasts as long as fourteen of our days and nights, they are much better equipped to measure\n\ntime than we are. For besides that series of Volva’s phases, of which we said that full Volva is the sign of midnight at the midVolvan circle, Volva itself also distinguishes the hours for them. For even though it does not seem to have any motion in space (145), nevertheless, unlike our moon, it rotates in its place (146)\n\nand displays in turn a wonderful variety of spots, as these spots move constantly from east to west (147). One such revolution, in\n\nwhich the same spots return (148), 1s regarded by the Subvolvans as one hour of time (149); it is equal, however, to a little more than one of our days added to one of our nights (150). This is the only uniform measure of time (151). For, as was pointed out above;?? the sun and stars move non-uniformly about the moon-dwellers\n\nevery day. This non-uniformity is revealed very clearly by this ro28. Here Kepler uses Volva as a compact expression to designate that place on\n\nthe moon which has 29. When Volva midnight. See fn. 24, 30. See pp. 19-20,\n\nVolva directly overhead (see Kepler's Note 127). is full, the moon is new, and the mid-Subvolvans above. above.\n\nhave\n\ntheir\n\n24\n\nThe Dream\n\ntation of Volva*\n\nif it is compared with the distances of the fixed\n\nstars from the moon (152).\n\nSo far as its upper, northern part is concerned, Volva in general\n\nseems to have two halves (153). One of them is darker and covered with almost continuous spots (154). The other is a little lighter\n\n(155), being interpenetrated by a bright belt (156) which lies to the north and serves to distinguish the two halves. In the darker half the shape of the spot is hard to describe. Yet on the eastern side (157) it looks like the front of the human head cut off at the shoulders (158) and leaning forward to kiss a young girl (159) ina long dress (160), who stretches her hand back (161) to attract a leaping cat (162). The bigger and broader part of the spot (163),\n\nhowever, extends westward (164) without any apparent configuration. In the other half of Volva the brightness is more widely diffused (165) than the spot (166). You might call it the outline of\n\na bell (167) hanging from a rope (168) and swinging westward (169). What lies above (170) and below (171) ?? cannot be lik-\n\nened to anything (172).\n\nBesides distinguishing the hours of the day for them in this manner, Volva also furnishes no obscure indication of the seasons of\n\nthe year to anyone who is observant, or who is unaware of the arrangement of the fixed stars. Even when the sun is in the sign of the Crab (173), Volva clearly displays the north pole of its rotation. For there is a certain small dark spot\n\n(174)\n\nwhich\n\nis stuck\n\n(175) in the middle of the bright area above the figure of the girl. From the highest and uppermost part of Volva (176) this spot moves toward the east, and then as it drops down\n\nover the disk,\n\ntoward the west (177); from this side it again turns eastward to-\n\nward the top of Volva, and thus it is perpetually visible at that time\n\n(178). But when the sun is in the sign of the Goat, this spot is nowhere to be seen since the entire circle with its pole disappears behind the body of Volva.\n\nIn these two seasons\n\nof the year the\n\nspots travel westward in a straight line (179). But in the interven-\n\ning seasons, when the sun is in the sign of the Ram * or the Bal-\n\n31. Here Kepler is contrasting the uniformity of the earth's axial rotation with the non-uniformitv of the other celestial motions as observed from the moon. 32. These two numbers (170 and 171) were interchanged in the 1634 Somnium. 33. Ariete, misprinted Oriente in the 1634 Somnium, p. 21.\n\nThe Dream\n\n25\n\nance, the spots either drop down or climb up crosswise in a somewhat crooked line. These facts show us that, while the center of the body of Volva remains stationary, the poles of this rotation revolve on an arctic circle once a year around the pole of the moondwellers (180).*4 More careful observers notice also that Volva does not always retain the same size. For at those hours of the day when the heavenly bodies travel fast, the diameter of Volva is much bigger, so that then it altogether exceeds four times the diameter of our moon (181). What shall I say now about the eclipses of the sun and of Volva? Eclipses occur on Levania too, and they occur at the same moments as solar and lunar eclipses here on the globe of the earth, although obviously for the opposite reasons. For when a total eclipse of the sun is visible to us, for them Volva is eclipsed. In turn, when our moon is eclipsed for us, the sun is eclipsed for them (182). Nevertheless, the correspondence is not complete. For they often see partial eclipses of the sun when no part of the moon is blacked\n\nout for us (183). On the other hand, they not infrequently miss eclipses of Volva when we have partial eclipses of the sun (184).\n\nVolva is eclipsed for them when it is full, just as is the moon for us when it is full; but the sun 1s eclipsed at new Volva, as it is for us at\n\nnew moon (185). Since their days and nights are so long, they ex-\n\nperience very frequent darkenings of both bodies. For whereas among us a large percentage of the eclipses passes on to our antipodes, their antipodes, because they are Privolvans, see absolutely none of these phenomena, which are all witnessed by the Subvolvans alone. They never see a total eclipse of Volva (186). However, for\n\nthem the body of Volva is traversed by a certain small spot (187)\n\nwhich\n\nis reddish\n\naround\n\nthe rim\n\n(188)\n\nand black in the middle\n\n(189). Entering from the eastern side of Volva, it leaves by the western edge (190), following the same course as the natural spots\n\nof Volva, while surpassing them in speed (191). It lasts one-sixth of\n\na Levanian hour or four of our hours (192).\n\nA solar eclipse is caused for them by their Volva, just as it is for\n\n34. Kepler's above.\n\nillorum: means\n\n\"theirs\"\n\n(ie.\n\nof the\n\nmoon-dwellers),\n\nas in fn.\n\n25,\n\n26\n\nThe\n\nDream\n\nus by our moon. This phenomenon is inevitable since Volva has a diameter four times bigger than the sun’s.”” As the sun crosses from the east through the south beyond the motionless Volva to the west, it very often passes behind Volva, which thus occults the sun’s body partially or totally. Even though an occultation of the sun’s entire body is frequent, it is nevertheless quite remarkable be-\n\ncause it lasts several of our hours (193), while the light of both the\n\nsun and Volva is extinguished at the same time.?? This is a grand\n\nspectacle for the Subvolvans. For under other circumstances their nights are not much darker than their days on account of the bril-\n\nliance and size of Volva, which is always present, whereas in a solar eclipse both luminaries, the sun and Volva, are quenched for them. Yet among them solar eclipses have the following peculiar feature. Hardly has the sun disappeared behind the body of Volva than, as happens quite frequently, bright light arises on the opposite side. It is as though the sun expanded and embraced the entire body of Volva, whereas at other times the sun appears just as many\n\ndegrees smaller than Volva\n\n(194). Therefore complete darkness\n\ndoes not always occur, unless the centers of the bodies are almost\n\nexactly aligned (195) and the condition of the intervening trans-\n\nparent medium is suitable (196). Nor, on the other hand, is Volva extinguished so suddenly that it cannot be seen at all (197), even though the sun is entirely hidden behind it; the only exception\n\ntakes place at the middle moment of a total eclipse (198). But at the beginning of a total eclipse in certain localities on the divisor\n\nVolva still shines, like an ember which continues to glow after a flame has been put out. When Volva, too, ceases to shine, the middle of the total eclipse has arrived (for if the eclipse is not total, Volva does not cease to shine). When Volva resumes its shining (at the opposite localities on the divisor circle) the sun also approaches visibility. Thus to a certain extent both luminaries are ex-\n\ntinguished at the same time in the middle of a total eclipse (199).\n\nSo much for the phenomena in both hemispheres of Levania, the Subvolvan and the Privolvan. From these phenomena, even with35. Kepler is comparing, not the actual diameters, but the apparent\n\ndiameters as\n\nthey would look to an observer on the moon. 36. The light of the sun is extinguished because that body is (apparently) passing behind Volva, which is opaque. Volva’s light is extinguished at the same time because the side then visible to an observer on the moon is turned away from the sun, the source of Volva’s light.\n\nThe Dream\n\n27\n\nout my saying anything, it is not difficult to infer how much the\n\nSubvolvans differ from the Privolvans in all other respects.\n\nFor although the Subvolvan night lasts as long as fourteen of our\n\ndays and nights, nevertheless by its presence Volva lights up the\n\nland and protects it from the cold. Indeed, so huge a mass, so intense a brilliance cannot fail to impart warmth (200). On the other hand, even though a day among the Subvolvans has the sun irksomely present for fifteen or sixteen of our days and nights, nevertheless it is a smaller sun, whose strength is not so dangerous (201). Ihe luminaries, being joined, pull all the water to\n\nthat hemisphere (202), where the land is submerged so that only a tiny quantity of it protrudes (203). By contrast the Privolvan\n\nhemisphere is dry and cold because all the water has been drawn off (204). However, when night begins for the Subvolvans and day for the Privolvans, the hemispheres divide the luminaries between them, and therefore the water is divided ? too; the fields of the Subvolvans are drained, whereas the moisture provides the Privolvans with some slight relief from the heat (205). The whole of Levania does not exceed fourteen hundred German miles in circumference, that is, only a quarter of our earth (206). Nevertheless, it has very high mountains (207) as well as very deep and wide valleys (208); to this extent it is much less of a\n\nperfect sphere than our earth is. Yet it is all porous and, so to say,\n\nperforated with caves and grottoes everywhere (209), especially in the Privolvan region (210); these recesses are the inhabitants’ principal protection from heat and cold (211). Whatever 1s born on the land or moves about on the land (212) attains a monstrous size. Growth is very rapid. Everything has a short life, since it develops such an immensely massive body (213). The Privolvans have no fixed abode, no established domicile. In the\n\ncourse of one of their days they roam in crowds over their whole sphere, each according to his own nature: some use their legs, which far surpass those of our camels; some resort to wings; and some follow the receding water in boats; or if a delay of several more days is necessary, then they crawl into caves. Most of them are divers; all of them, since they live naturally, draw their breath very slowly; hence under water they stay down on the bottom, 37. The misprint dividantur in the Somnium\n\ndividuntur by Frisch (VIII, 38:15 up).\n\n(1634 ed., p. 25) was corrected to\n\n28\n\nThe\n\nDream\n\nhelping nature with art (214). For in those very deep layers of the\n\nwater, they say, the cold persists while the waves on top are heated up by the sun (215); whatever clings to the surface is boiled out by the sun at noon, and becomes food for the advancing hordes of wandering inhabitants (216). For in general the Subvolvan hemisphere is comparable to our cantons, towns, and gardens; the Privolvan, to our open country, forests, and deserts. Those for whom breathing is more essential introduce the hot water into the caves through a narrow channel in order that it may flow a long time to reach the interior and gradually cool off. There they shut themselves up for the greater part of the day, using the water for drink; when evening comes, they go out looking for food (217).\n\nIn plants, the rind; in animals, the skin, or whatever replaces 1t,\n\ntakes up the major portion of their bodily mass; it is spongy and porous. If anything ts exposed during the dav, it becomes hard on top and scorched: when evening comes, its husk drops off (218). Things born in the eround—they are sparse on the ridges of the mountains—generally begin and end their lives on the same day, with new generations springing up daily. In general, the serpentine nature is predominant. For in a wonderful manner they expose themselves to the sun at noon as if for pleasure; yet they do so nowhere but behind the mouths of the caves to make sure that they may retreat safely and swiftly (219). To certain of them the breath they exhaust and the life they lose on account of the heat of the day return at night; the pattern is the opposite of that governing flies among us (220). Scattered evervwhere on the ground are objects having the shape of pine cones. Their shells are roasted during the day. In the ev ening when, so N say, they disclose their secrets, they beget living creatures (22 Relief from the heat in the Subvolvan hemisphere IS prov ded chiefly by the constant cloud cover and rain (222), which sometimes prevail over half the region or more (223).\n\nWhen I had reached this point in my dream, a wind arose with the rattle of rain, disturbing my sleep and at the same time Wiping out the end of the book acquired at Frankfurt.

Moreover, lantis, whence he\n\nof the philosophers in this branch of literature. over into Africa when he was getting ready to in the same western ocean Plato fashioned Atsummoned imaginary aids to military valor?\n\n1. For his knowledge of the history of Scotland, like most of his contemporaries, Kepler relied on George Buchanan's Rerum Scoticarum historia (Edinburgh, 1582), as may be seen in Kepler's Note 11. To support the view that pre-Roman Gaul and Britain spoke identical or closely related languages, the renowned Scottish historian, in Bk. II, analyzed place names: \"Not a few are derived from ‘dur,’ a word which meant ‘water’ among the ancient Gauls and Britons . . . . In Gaul,\n\nDurocotti . . .\" (1582 ed., fol. 23, ll. 67-71). In Buchanan's history of Scotland,\n\nthen, Kepler came across the name of this important Gallic town, which was mentioned in Julius Caesar's Gallic War (vi.44), Strabo (iv.194), and Ptolerny’s Geography (ii.9.12, viii.s.6). It was this Gallic place name that suggested “Duracotus” to Kepler.\n\n2. In Bk. vi of his dialogue on the Republic, Cicero portrayed one of his interlocutors as arriving in Africa, where he then proceeded to have the famous\n\n\"Dream of Scipio.\"\n\n3. While successfully repelling an invasion by the armed forces of the fabulous 30\n\nKepler’s Notes on the Dream\n\n31\n\nFinally, Plutarch, too, in his little book on The Face in the Moon;\n\nafter prolonged discussion ventures out into the American ocean and describes to us such an arrangement of islands as a modern geographer would probably apply to the Azores, Greenland, and the territory of Labrador, regions situated around Iceland.5 Every island Atlantis, described by Plato in his Timaeus, 24E-25D, and I08E, 113C-121C, Athens' military prowess rose to a peak. Plato\n\nin his Critias, attributed the\n\nstory to an old Egyptian priest, however, not to a dream.\n\n4. The Face in the Moon, the most valuable discussion of the earth’s satellite to\n\ncome down to us from antiquity, will be cited hereafter for the sake of brevity as Moon. 5. Kepler's regionibus circum Islandiam sitis is not an addition to the Azores, Greenland,\n\nand\n\nLabrador,\n\nbut is in apposition\n\nto those\n\nthree\n\nplaces. They\n\nwere\n\nKepler's candidates to be the modern equivalents of three islands mentioned by\n\nPlutarch, and were turned by him into \"regions situated around\n\nhe had already selected it as the scene of his Dream.\n\nIceland,\" because\n\nWhat Plutarch characterized as a myth, not a dream, starts with an island \"whose distance from Britain is a run of five days as you sail toward the west; at\n\nan equal distance from it and from one another, three other islands extend for the most part in the direction where the sun sets in the summertime” (Moon, g940F941A).\n\nNevertheless, Plutarch's statement that “he is telling nothing\n\nbut a fable\"\n\nwas ascribed to his modesty by Kepler in Note 97 on his Latin translation of Plutarch's Moon. Moreover, Kepler said, Plutarch's \"start and topography, which we find in agreement with the actual facts,\" are such that \"he could hardly have written in this way merely from an unfettered imagination.\" Had Plutarch designated the Mediterranean area as the starting point of his five-day voyage, Kepler “would have believed him to be talking about the Hesperides or even the Azores. But because he chose Britain, he certainly seems to be referring to Iceland and three islands lying around it.\" The identification of these three islands baffled Kepler, however, because he believed Plutarch's topography to be \"in agreement with the\n\nactual\n\nfacts.\"\n\nThus,\n\nof the\n\nthree\n\nplaces\n\nnamed\n\nin\n\nKepler'\n\nNote\n\n2 on\n\nthe\n\nDream, Labrador was known not to be an island (that is why Kepler called it a\n\nterritory), and the Azores lie far south, not northwest, of Iceland. Hence, of the three, only Greenland was kept when Kepler later wrote Note 97 on his transla-\n\ntion of Plutarch's Moon. 'There he coupled with Greenland two other which have since disappeared from our atlases. The geographers on whom lied were the best of his time. But after only a little more than a century ploration of the New World, their knowledge of the recently discovered\n\nislands he reof exlands\n\nwas understandably far from accurate. In reality, then, Kepler had no sound basis\n\nfor equating Plutarch's \"great continent\" with the New World. When Kepler spoke of Plutarch “venturing out into the American ocean,\" he was, of course, using a modern term that had been coined in the previous century to honor Amerigo Vespucci. For an analysis of Kepler's comments on Plutarch's Moon, see\n\nEduard Ebner, Geographische Hinweise und Anklange in Plutarchs Schrift “De facie in orbe lunae\" (Munich, 1906), especially pp. 73-80.

Kepler’s translation of Plutarch’s Moon into\n\n32\n\nKepler's Notes on the Dream\n\ntime I reread this book by Plutarch, I am exceedingly amazed and keep wondering by what chance it happened that our dreams or fables coincided so closely. For with my quite reliable memory I recall the origins of the individual parts of my tale, because they did not all come to me from reading this book. I have a very old document which you, most illustrious Christopher Besold,® wrote\n\nwith your own hand, when, in the year 1593, on the basis of my essays,’ you formulated about twenty theses concerning the celestial\n\nphenomena on the moon ? and showed them to Veit Müller, who then regularly presided over the philosophical disputations, with the\n\nthought that you would engage in a debate over them if he approved.? At that time I had not yet seen the works of Plutarch. Later I came across the two books of Lucian's True Story? writ-\n\nten in Greek, which I chose as my means of mastering the language. I was helped by my enjoyment of the highly daring tale,\n\nLatin is scheduled to be included in Gesam. Werke, XII, when that volume is ready; meanwhile it can be consulted in the 1634 Sommium, pp. 97-184, and Frisch, VIII, 76-123. 6. Christopher Besold (1577-1638) entered Tübingen University when he was\n\nfourteen years old. Twelve months later he was awarded a bachelor's degree, and\n\nin 1593, when his older fellow-student, Kepler, gave him some ideas about the moon to be used in an academic disputation, he was a candidate for the M.A. Having obtained this degree on September 5, 1593, he went on to study law. Six\n\nyears later he received his doctorate in that subject. He joined the faculty of Tübingen University as professor of law in 1610, and taught there for the ensuing quarter of a century. \"You were once my faithful teacher,\" Besold reminded Kepler in a letter written in 1605 (Gesam. Werke, XV, 130:4). Although Besold and\n\nKepler sometimes disagreed on basic issues, they nevertheless remained the best of\n\nfriends. For example, when Kepler's only sister, Margaret, was being wooed, Kepler asked Besold for information about the suitor (Gesazz. Werke, XV, 316-17). When Besold published his thoughts about the New World, Kepler was one of the three persons to whom he dedicated the book (Gesam. Werke, XVII, 283:1415; 313:9; 495). For Besold’s record as a student, see Matrikeln . . . Tübingen, I, 682, and for his part in the trial of Kepler's mother as a witch, sce Edward Rosen, \"Kepler and Witchcraft Trials,\" The Historian (1966), 28:447-50. 7. One of Kepler's essays maintained that the first motion, or apparent daily ro-\n\ntation of the heavens, is merely an appearance caused bv the actual rotation of the earth (Gesam. Werke, I, 9:16—17; see fn. 177, below). 8. Since Besold's theses concerned the moon, they were based not on the essay\n\nmentioned in fn. 7 which I wrote . . XIII, 39:243-44; cf. 9. See Appendix\n\n10. The\n\nbut, as Kepler put it, on \"the disputation concerning the moon . but which Besold was prepared to defend\" (Gesam. Werke IV, 199:5-9). C, \"Kepler's Lunar Dissertation of 1593.\"\n\nTrue Story was included\n\nTurner of Lucian's Satirical Sketches\n\nin the recent English translations by Paul\n\n(Baltimore:\n\nPenguin\n\nBooks, Ltd.,\n\n1961).\n\n)\n\nKepler’s Notes on the Dream\n\n33\n\nwhich nevertheless offered some intimations concerning the nature of the entire universe, as Lucian himself announces in his introduction.’? He, too, sails out past the Pillars of Hercules into the ocean\n\nand, carried aloft with his ship by whirlwinds, is transported to the\n\nmoon.'^ These were my first traces of a trip to the moon, which\n\nwas my aspiration in later times.’* At Graz, in the year 1595, I first encountered Plutarch's book, to which my attention was directed\n\nby reading Erasmus Reinhold's commentary on Peurbach’s Theories.^ At Prague, in the year 1604, I quoted extensively from r1. Here\n\nKepler attaches great weight to a very slender thread in Lucian's\n\nde-\n\nsign. While the satirist did faintly profess to be \"exhibiting a not uninformed view,\" he admitted that “nothing I say is true. Moreover, I am writing about things which I have neither seen nor felt nor heard from others. Besides, they do\n\nnot exist at all, nor can they even have come into being. Hence my readers must not in the least believe them\" (True Story, Secs. 2, 4). 12. Lucian “once started out from the Pillars of Hercules and headed into the western ocean\" (True Story, Sec. 5); \"suddenly a whirlwind arose, spun the ship around, and lifted it up\" (Sec. 9); the ruler of the land to which he was carried \"said that that land was the moon, which shines down on us\" (Sec. 11). 13. Hence, in the lunar dissertation which Kepler wrote in 1593, astronomical observers were already on the moon. At that time Kepler had not yet conceived the idea of transporting an observer from the earth to the moon. That idea was\n\nthe principal feature of the Dream framework, which Kepler built in 1609 around\n\nhis student dissertation of 1593. 14. George Peurbach (1423-61) wrote an introduction to astronomy under the title New Theories of tbe Planets, which was first published about a dozen years\n\nafter his death. This highly popular textbook was later reissued with explanatory commentary by Erasmus Reinhold (1511-53), who inserted an essay of his own on “The\n\nLight\n\nof the Moon\"\n\n(\"De\n\nilluminatione\n\nlunae\").\n\nHere\n\nReinhold\n\nsaid:\n\n“With regard to the matter composing the moon's body, there are many different\n\nopinions of various philosophers, which students will look up in Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and others.\" It was this remark of Reinhold's that directed Kep-\n\nler's attention to Plutarch's Moon.\n\nKepler called “Reinhold’s commentary on Peurbach's Theories very learned and worthy of being read carefully by students of astronomy\" (Gesam. Werke, II, 204:15-17). It was Kepler's judgment that “in this one little book there is more illumination than in all” the writings of a celebrated contemporary, Joseph Justus\n\nScaliger\n\n(Frisch, VIII,\n\n275:27-28).\n\nIn the first edition\n\nof Reinhold's\n\nPeurbach\n\n(Wittenberg, 1542), as in many other early printed books, the pages are not numbered. Instead, the gatherings or signatures are indicated by letters of the alphabet,\n\nwhile the leaves or folios within each signature are numbered as a separate group. In the\n\n1542\n\nedition, the reference\n\nto Plutarch\n\noccurs\n\non the verso\n\nof folio\n\n5 of\n\nsignature T (Tsv). In the second edition (Wittenberg, 1553) the reference to Plu-\n\ntarch occurs at fol. 163v. Since fol. 164, not fol. T6r, is cited by Kepler (Gesam. Werke, II, 203:26, 237:40), he used the second edition (as was pointed out by Hammer in ibid., 450). It is likely that Kepler studied Reinhold carefully in con-\n\nnection with his new duties in 1594 as the teacher of mathematics and astronomy\n\n34\n\nKepler’s Notes on the Dream\n\nPlutarch in my Optical Part of Astronomy. Nevertheless, the 1slands mentioned by Plutarch in the ocean around Iceland were not\n\nresponsible for my choice of Iceland as the starting point of my\n\ndream. Among\n\nthe reasons, however, there was the following. At\n\nthat time there was for sale in Prague Lucian's book about the trip to the moon, as translated into the German language by Rollenhagen’s son; !* bound with it were the stories of St. Brendan '' and\n\nSt. Patrick's Purgatory ?? in the earth beneath Mt. Hekla, the Ice-\n\nlandic volcano.!® Moreover, since Plutarch, in accordance with the belief of pagan theology, located the purgatory of souls on the moon,? I decided that when I set out for the moon I would most at Graz. In a letter of 1599 Kepler cited a proof used by Reinhold in his \"Light of\n\nthe Moon,\" the essay in which Kepler first saw Plutarch mentioned as a source of information about the moon (Gesam. Werke, XIII, 340:36-37; 419).\n\n15. Kepler wrote the epoch-making work in which he laid the foundations of\n\nmodern\n\noptics while\n\nhe was\n\nliving in Prague.\n\nBut\n\nthe treatise was\n\npublished\n\nat\n\nFrankfurt/Main in 1604. It bore a typically long title in fourteen lines, the first six of which mean: “Additions to Witelo, in which the Optical Part of Astronomy 1s Expounded.” When citing it, Kepler sometimes called it, as he does here in Note 2, the Optical Part of Astronomy, but usually he referred to it more\n\nOptics. He included in it fourteen quotations from Plutarch’s Moon\n\nbriefly as his\n\n(see Appen-\n\ndix D). 16. George Rollenhagen (1542-1609), in his time a very widely read German poet, was the rector of a school at Magdeburg. In that city, in 1603, his son, Gabriel, published Vier Bücber wunderbarlicher . . . Reysen (Four Books about Wonderful Journeys), Lucian’s True Story being the third item. For the literature concerning George Rollenhagen, see Eli Sobel, Publications of the Modern Language Association (1955), 70:762-80. For a study of Gabriel Rollenhagen's life and work, see Karl Theodor Gaedertz, Gabriel Rollenbagen (Leipzig, 1881). 17. St. Brendan the Navigator has been aptly called the Odysseus of Ireland.\n\nMany old pagan stories were attached to his name and given an edifying Christian\n\nflavor.
