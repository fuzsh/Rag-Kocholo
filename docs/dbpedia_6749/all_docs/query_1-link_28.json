This reflects their respective importance.\n\nEveryone should go to primary school, and it lays the foundation for all further education. But in an economy that is increasingly dominated by knowledge and driven by innovation, we should not shy away from asking the question about how to train someone to produce, rather than reproduce, knowledge.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,018,785\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#3\n\nLike many professors, I have my theories on how best to guide someone to a PhD. Testing such hypotheses is hard because there is little to no systematic data collection. I therefore decided to start at the top: Nobel laureates. There are few and their careers are well-documented. Collecting data on Nobelists is a task that can be managed by a sole (grantless) researcher.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,018,785\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#4\n\nEconomics\n\nI first focused on winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics, because that is the discipline I know. I constructed the academic family tree: Who studied with whom. The results astonished me. Eighty-two out of 87 Nobelists share a common ancestor, often quite a recent one.\n\nEsther Duflo and Daniel McFadden are fourth-generation Nobel laureates. Both furthermore have a great-great-grandprofessor who won Nobel Prizes, hers in economics, his in physics.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,018,785\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#5\n\nThe central-most academic ancestor is surprising too: Karl Knies. The end of the 19th century saw the Methodenstreit or ‘method wars’ about the nature of economics. Austrians argued for theory and a narrow scope, Germans for empirics and a wide range of topics. The Austrians won the battle.\n\nEconomists preferred rigour over realism for a long time. But while the Austrians were busy with their elegant theories, the Germans were training young economists. A generation of young Americans studied with Professor Knies at the University of Heidelberg. They laid the foundations of the leading PhD programmes in the USA.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,018,785\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#6\n\nThe Germans lost the battle, but they won the war. Economics is now empirical, studying any and every topic in the social and behavioural sciences and some in the natural sciences and humanities too.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,018,785\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#7\n\nWhat makes a winner?\n\nFrom here, I turned to the more important question: How to win a Nobel Prize? You first need to be nominated. The right to nominate rests with a random sample of economics professors around the world, all economics professors in the Nordic countries, and previous laureates – whose opinion probably carries some weight with the committee. Nominations are confidential, but there are lists of candidates.\n\nComparing those who could have won to those who did reveals that the best strategy is to have a Nobelist among your students. In a remarkable number of cases, the student won the Nobel Prize before the professor. Having studied with a Nobel laureate also improves your chances. Studying under a Nobelist reduces the probability of winning, which is conditional on being worthy – but presumably improves the chance of being considered.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,018,785\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#8\n\nNobel lineage\n\nFinally, I cast the net wider and studied all four scientific Nobel Prizes (there are some intriguing links to the peace prize, but for the purposes of this study they were excluded). A total of 696 out of 727 Nobel laureates are part of the same academic family. Some of these connections go way back.\n\nEmmanuel Stupanus is the common ancestor of 668 Nobelists. Stupanus was a professor in Basel in the 17th century. He argued against empirical evidence.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,018,785\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#9\n\nJoseph Thomson, who won the physics prize in 1906 for his research on conducting electricity in gas, has 227 enNobeled descendants.\n\nHis professor, Lord Rayleigh, won in 1904, but it was Thomson who trained a generation of ground-breaking scientists, including six Nobelists (Aston, Bohr, Born, Bragg, Davisson and Rutherford) and other famous ones, such as Robert Oppenheimer. Thomson did not just instil excellence in research in his students. He also taught them how to train the next generation."
