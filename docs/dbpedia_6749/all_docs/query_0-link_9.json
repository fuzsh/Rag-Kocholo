        "text": "Biography\n\nBauhin studied botany at the University of TÃ¼bingen under Leonhart Fuchs (1501â1566). He then travelled with Conrad Gessner, after which he started a practice of medicine at Basel, where he was elected Professor of Rhetoric in 1566. Four years later he was invited to become the physician to Frederick I, Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg at MontbÃ©liard, in the Franche-ComtÃ© where he remained until his death. He devoted himself chiefly to botany. His great work, Historia plantarum universalis, a compilation of all that was then known about botany, remained incomplete at his death, but was published at Yverdon in 1650â1651.[1]\n\nBauhin nurtured several botanic gardens and also collected plants during his travels. In 1591, he published a list of plants named after saints called De plantis a divis sanctisve nomen habentibus.\n\nJohann Bauhin died in MontbÃ©liard."
