This is my academic genealogy. As we go back in time, it becomes difficult to identify what should be considered an acceptable degree. It is also difficult to assign an unique advisor to each student. In the following, I have basically followed the Mathematics Genealogy Project, and most of my data is from there. The table below has 63 data rows and 86 data columns, so you will need to scroll around to see it. The time scale is approximate, and every person gets a block in time roughly since his (everyone here is male, I think) highest degree to his student's highest degree, the granularity is a decade. If a person has advised more than one student, his genealogy is traced only on the leftmost occurrence.
