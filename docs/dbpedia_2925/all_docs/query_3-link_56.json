(Stephen Baxter — Santa Cruz Local file)\n\nDec. 13-15 / Online, by phone and at The Dream Inn, 175 West Cliff Drive, Santa Cruz\n\nThe California Coastal Commission on Dec. 14 is expected to consider a $4.78 million fine for the Rio Del Mar Beach Island Homeowners Association.\n\nCoastal Commission staff alleged that the association has long blocked access to a quarter mile of public walkway along the beach and has not completed habitat restoration it agreed to do in 1980. Most houses in the neighborhood are vacation homes, the report stated.\n\nCommissioners are also set to consider a $500,000 fine for owners of a house next to the homeowner’s association. The home allegedly blocked access to a walkway and included an unpermitted seawall, according to the report.\n\n—Jesse Kathan\n\nCoastal Commission to consider updates to city, county coastal plans\n\nOn Dec. 15, the California Coastal Commission is set to consider changes that Santa Cruz city leaders proposed to the city’s Local Coastal Plan. The changes to the Downtown Plan, approved by the Santa Cruz City Council in October, increase height limits and allow rooftops bars, pools and gardens. The amendments also pave the way for a proposed six-story hotel on Front Street. Coastal Commission staff have recommended approval of the changes, according to a staff report.\n\nSeparately, the commission is set to decide on changes to Santa Cruz County’s Local Coastal Plan. The proposed changes align with the county’s Sustainability Update, which would allow for more housing in Live Oak and other urbanized areas of the county outside of cities. Commission staff proposed some amendments to the proposed changes, which would then go to Santa Cruz County leaders for approval.\n\n—Jesse Kathan\n\nTo participate: The meeting will be held at The Dream Inn, 175 West Cliff Drive, Santa Cruz. It will also be streamed online and by phone at 415-904-5202.

(Tyler Maldonado — Santa Cruz Local file)\n\nPajaro flood survivors soon will be able to apply for money from a $20 million state grant secured by Monterey County leaders.\n\nOn Dec. 6, Monterey County supervisors decided that $10 million of a $20 million state grant would go to individual residents and business leaders who suffered losses in the March 11 Pajaro River flood. The application process has not yet been outlined.\n\nThe remaining $10 million will help pay for other projects that include:\n\nGrants to community organizations that serve Pajaro: $2 million.\n\nPajaro Library community space and elevator: $3.5 million.\n\nStreet safety and a Pajaro community sign: $2 million.\n\nPajaro parks: $1.2 million.\n\nIn community meetings this fall, many Pajaro residents and business owners demanded more direct aid from the $20 million grant. The original county staff proposal was $6 million in direct aid. About 40 Pajaro residents attended the Dec. 6 supervisors meeting and many pushed for a larger share.\n\n—Fidel M.

(Stephen Baxter — Santa Cruz Local)\n\n12 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 12 / Online and at 809 Center St., Santa Cruz\n\nThe Santa Cruz City Council on Dec. 12 is set to discuss the final draft of the city’s Housing Element.\n\nThe Housing Element of the city’s General Plan locates where more homes will be allowed. City leaders must satisfy state-mandated, housing production targets in the next eight years. City staff have submitted versions of the plan to state authorities since May. State officials have indicated that they will approve the plan after the city formally submits it, city staff said.\n\nThe final plan includes changes from the original draft, including locations where developers could build homes for “extremely low income” residents as defined by state income limits. The latest draft does not include anticipated new student housing at UC Santa Cruz because of state feedback that dorms don’t count towards the city’s housing goals.\n\n—Jesse Kathan\n\nLicense plate cameras up for approval\n\nThe Santa Cruz City Council on Dec. 12 is slated to reconsider a request for grant money to install 14 license plate readers on city streets to help police investigations.\n\nThe cameras would check license plates against a “hot list” of vehicles that are stolen or otherwise associated with a crime, police said. Many other cities including Watsonville have similar cameras.\n\nThe city council on Nov. 28 delayed a decision on whether to lease the cameras because of some residents’ concerns. Council members pledged to work with Santa Cruz police leaders to refine rules on how the cameras would be used.\n\n—Jesse Kathan\n\nCouncil to weigh request for 908 Ocean St. environmental report\n\nA proposed development at 908 Ocean St. could include more than 350 homes, shops and a parking garage. (BDE Architecture)\n\nThe Santa Cruz City Council on Dec. 12 is expected to discuss whether to order an environmental impact report for a proposed development with more than 350 homes at 908 Ocean St.\n\nThe proposed four-acre development could include two three-story buildings and a five-story building. Studios, apartments and commercial space are proposed.\n\n—Jesse Kathan\n\nTo participate: Join on Zoom or call 833-548-0276, meeting ID 946 8440 1344.

At its Dec. 12 meeting, the supervisors are expected to decide whether to use the money to fund the Crisis Now program for three years.\n\nThe program would expand the county’s Mobile Emergency Response Team that deploys mental health professionals to people in crisis. It also would enable a 988 mental health emergency call center to directly send teams to emergencies without law enforcement. The money also would help create a facility for youths in mental health emergencies.\n\nThe county would pay the nonprofit group Recovery Innovations International to consult on the development of the program.\n\n—Jesse Kathan\n\nFelton pump track agreement\n\nThe proposed pump track would replace a volleyball court and part of a lawn at Felton Covered Bridge County Park. (Santa Cruz Mountains Trail Stewardship)\n\nThe Santa Cruz County supervisors on Dec. 12 will consider a county agreement with the nonprofit Santa Cruz Mountains Trail Stewardship to design and build an asphalt pump track at Felton Covered Bridge County Park. The nonprofit would pay for the design and construction of the pump track and the county would maintain it, according to the agreement.\n\nThe proposed track would replace a volleyball court and part of a lawn. The project is exempt from a state law requiring environmental study of new construction, according to a county staff report.\n\n—Jesse Kathan\n\nTo participate: Join on Zoom or call 669-900-6833, meeting ID 8 899 4924 0497.
