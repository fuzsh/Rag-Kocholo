A .4 Bv Bruce Van Allen By JOHN ROBINSON Sentinel staff writer SANTA CRUZ Even as officials posed and offered congratulations at a Pacific Avenue ground-breaking ceremony Wednesday, the project itself was in a crisis. The hoopla over the El Centro Mercado and Hotel, a Community Housing Corp. project located across from the new Logos bookstore site, hid a growing concern among backers. They needed to find enough City Council votes to pass an emergency measure to meet a funding deadline .\n\nThe problem surfaced Friday when bank lawyers refused to accept part of the CHC contract with the city. Wording of the contract had to be changed, which required a 5-2 vote from the council to place it on the By JOHN ROBINSON Sentinel staff writer SANTA CRUZ George Ow Jr. has always been quick to pull out his checkbook when it comes to giving money to community groups. So when Ow proposed a controversial Longs Drugs store development it was only natural, he says, that such groups would, in turn, support him. Opponents, however, claim that Ow's generosity has bought political support, including that of City Council members, and that Ow has received special treatment from the city .\n\n\"When the people in the neighborhoods say that if George Ow had not been involved, that if the proposal had come from the Longs corporation (it would have failed), I agree. It would have been dead in the water,\" said Councilman Scott Kennedy. The Longs project is not dead in the water, but remains afloat after the City Council voted 4-2 Wednesday to allow a zoning change from residential to commercial. The pivotal votes were cast by Kennedy and fellow progressive councilman Neal Coonerty, who voted for the project over strong neighborhood opposition. Dennis Wheeler, a member of the Westside Neighborhood Alliance, said, \"It's clear political favoritism is alive and well in the city of Santa Cruz .\n\nWe knew that Please see LONGS DRUGS A10 agenda for emergency consideration. Normally that wouldn't be a problem, given the political split of the council. But with the absence of Councilwoman Jane Yo-koyama Tuesday, the progressive council majority found itself depending upon the votes of councilmen Louis Rittenhouse and John Mahaney who refused to hear the matter. The council majority responded by holding a special Wednesday night meeting in hopes Yo-koyama would return. But Mahaney said the council could hold all the meetings it wanted Please see EL MERCADO A5 77 Bush tries to lighten the gloom Panetta assails budget as a retread of the '80s By ALAN FRAM The Associated Press WASHINGTON President Bush unveiled a $1.52 trillion budget on Wednesday that would lighten tax loads for families and businesses in hopes of easing the recession's \"winter's gloom.\" He would boost spending on many programs for children and road construction but cut back in other areas ranging from the post-Cold War military to mm mm Medicare checks paid to doctors and hospitals .\n\nAnaylsis of president's budget proposal Page D6 The federal deficit would rise to about $400 billion, half again as large as last year's re A.

Felton bridge covers a span of time cord shortfall of $269 billion. Bush urged Congress to \"lay aside partisanship\" and speedily enact his election-year spending plan in order to \"get the economy moving again.\" After setting a March 20 target for action in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, he visited GOP legislators Wednesday and asked them to \"help communicate with the American people\" to win support for his program, according to lawmakers. But majority Democrats, who have their own ideas for reviving the economy, zinged barbs at the spending blueprint for fiscal 1993 as it arrived at the Capitol .\n\nAs for Bush's deadline for action, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, scoffed, \"We don't operate that way.\" House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, DCalif, chided Bush for presenting a budget that he said \"reflects the shortsighted priorities of the 1980s\" and continues high deficits. \"I hope the president will cooperate with the Congress in developing a budget and economic program that looks to the future rather than the past,\" Panetta said. Bush would throw the financial might of the government at a wide collection of programs in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. For example, the Head Start pre school program for poor children would grow by $600 million next year to $2.8 billion, the fight against AIDS would grow from $4.4 billion to $4.9 billion, and highway building would grow from $17 billion to $19.2 billion .\n\nLaw enforcement efforts against illegal drug use would grow by $443 million to $8.6 billion, spending on cleanups at federal Energy Department facilities would increase $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion, and there would be a $200 million increase to $2.2 billion for NASA's planned space station. But to help pay for the expansion of some initiatives, 246 domestic programs would be eliminated and 84 others would be trimmed.

The clip-clop of horse-drawn buggies moving along its wooden planks long ago gave way to car wheels. Car wheels have long since given way to bicycle and skateboard wheels .\n\nThe clip-clop of horses remains. Believed to be the tallest covered bridge in the United States, its lofty redwood trusses were constructed across the San Lorenzo River in 1892. The bridge provided the only way into Felton across the river and the gateway to the San Lorenzo Valley. During its 100 years, the bridge has been saved from demolition by high- application for National Register of Historic Places listing. It was originally built, at a cost of $4,677, as an open-span truss and later covered by a 37-foot high roof and board and batten siding .\n\n\"That's why it's so high,\" said Jeff Oberdorfer, a Santa Cruz architect who designed the bridge's renovation in the 1980s. The design is a mixture of Pratt-Warren Truss construction with steel tension bars and sway bracing. It may be the last covered bridge constructed entirely of redwood, Oberdorfer said. In 1938, the Felton bridge was slated by the state highway department to be replaced by a concrete bridge. At the request of citizens, the high way department obligingly left the old bridge and built a new one a half mile to the north .\n\nThe wooden bridge was closed to car traffic that same year. When the state abandoned the bridge, it gave it to Santa Cruz County. But that transaction somehow was apparently lost in bureaucratic memory until the early 1980s, when then Supervisor Joe Cucchiara asked that the county Historical Commission research the bridge ownership, according to Oberdorfer. In the 1950s, the Felton Fire Department undertook the maintenance and repair of the bridge. The fire department volunteers used funds from an Please see BRIDGE A5 Cash speeds work on three county parks Page A5 way crews who planned a concrete replacement, battered in storms, abused by vandals and rebuilt to its historic look .\n\nNowadays, its wooden planks are used by local teens, who sit in the windows above the river.

Glenn Hoover, 26, of Santa Cruz, was fixing cars at the Unocal 76 station in Scotts Valley when customer George Bein, 88, of Scotts Valley, was felled by an unknown ailment at about 11 a.m. Hoover's co workers found a lifeless Bein on the ground near the station's air pump, where Bein was apparently preparing to fill his tires. \"He was out. He wasn't breathing .\n\nHe looked dead,\" said attendant Brian Parker. Parker yelled for his co-workers to call 911 and asked if anybody there knew how to administer CPR. Hoover, without answering, emerged from the mechanic's bay and \"brought the guy back,\" said Parker. \"The first thing I knew everybody was yelling 'Call and 'Does anybody know Hoover said. Hoover checked Bein's neck and wrist for a pulse .\n\n\"I was really scared because he had no vital signs at all,\" said Hoover, who has no formal CPR training but said he learned the basics from public service announcements, books and \"toying it on my girlfriend. \"You never think you're going to have to use it.\" After receiving mouth-to-mouth resuscita vn tion, Bein began to breathe again, said Hoover. \"I just did the best I could do under the circumstances,\" Hoover said.
