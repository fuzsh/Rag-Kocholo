        "text": "Huddersfield Architects Christopher Marsden, 28 August 2020 Introduction (revised 1/7 July 2019)\n\nAn A-Z listing of architects and architectural practices of the Huddersfield district and architects with Huddersfield district works.\n\nThe listing started as an appendix intended for the multi-agency Buildings of Huddersfield project (formally a HLF project) as a student’s contribution against fee remission. The collection of notes has continued long after the hours required.\n\nNotes in entries have been collected from diverse sources, but not (with a few exceptions) from the Huddersfield Corporation building registers and deposited plans. Sources are generally given.\n\nI hope entry data will lead readers to reading of the sources, further reading and searches.\n\nThe intention was to collect information such as practice names, training, works and dates (in the style of Brodie, Directory of British Architects 1834-1914) and more with personal information such as marriages, masonic connections and bankruptcies.\n\nBrodie and Edward Law’s web pages have been raided and acknowledged. It is obvious that the listing’s most famous architects, such as George Gilbert Scott, Edgar Wood and Frederick Gibberd are hardly referenced at all as I have nothing to add to the published directories, monographs and journal articles. Local tradesmen such as joiners who became architects have as much info included as possible.\n\nsome architects have, for various reasons, been of particular interest to me so their listing entries may only hint at the unpublished notes I have and local archive resources. These include:\n\nAndrew Buck Kenneth Findlater Campbell Willie Cooper Norman Culley Charles Fowler Clifford Hickson Edward Hughes John Kirk Ben Stocks\n\nOther architects are so obscure that little if anything has been included apart from a partial name. Some entries may be duplicates or variants.\n\nMany names will be missing and entries woefully incomplete — this is a work in progress. I will have repeated errors and introduced my own. All corrections and updates gratefully received.\n\n16 houses in three blocks on Storth Estate for Linthwaite UDC Tender Yorkshire Post 21 March 1914\n\n14 houses on Winget Avenue, Cowlersley (Storth Estate) tenders Yorkshire Post 8 July 1919\n\nMaking streets at Milnsbridge for Linthwaite UDC tenders Yorkshire Post 2 June 1923\n\nCinema on corner of Bradford Road and Flint Street TENDERS The Bioscope 8 March 1928\n\nLinthwaite Labour Club, Winget Avenue, Cowlersley stone laying Leeds Mercury 2 February 1931\n\nMarr Q2 1903\n\nJohn Samuel Alder FRIBA (1847-1919)\n\nb 13 Jan 1847, Birmingham. d 28 October 1919, Kensington\n\nHis family moved to West Malvern, Worcestershire, where, as a young man, he became Clerk of Works in his father’s building firm. Was articled in 1867 to the Hereford and Malvern architects, Haddon Bros, and remained as an assistant till 1872.\n\nBetween 1872 and 1883 he was Chief Assistant to Frederick Preedy (1820-1898) London based architect and stained glass designer, making a significant contribution to the design of Preedy’s later work. Then assistant to Robert Curwen. He commenced independent practice in London in 1886. Did work for some of his Preedy’s clients after his death.\n\nAlder studied with the Architectural Association and visited France and Italy where he made many sketches.\n\nAlder gained a reputation for combining sound building with economy to produce elegant, uncluttered churches. His work, distinguished by a masterly handling of light and space, was in demand at the end of the great period of suburban church building before the First World War. Most of his commissions came from within the Diocese of London.\n\nInvented a concrete mould system, “Grass Crete’ that allowed grass to grow through (HDE 5 August 1970)\n\n“An architect greens the parking lot\n\nOne evening British architect Jack Blackburn sat in his kitchen, staring at an egg crate. \"| thought, 'That's the answer,'\" he recalls. Two-and-a-half years later, Blackburn, utilizing the shape of that crate, came up with \"Grass Crete,\" a way of making grass grow in parking lots.\n\nBasically, he devised a concrete surface with evenly spaced four-leaf clover holes. After sodding, grass grows from the openings. Autos and trucks can't damage the protected roots of the grass.\n\nOne of the first places it was tried was a parking lot in London Airport, which Blackburn (right, with the sales manager of a lawn mower firm) recently visited. Today, Grass Crete covers three million square feet of England. In the U.S., it is being tried in Los Angeles and Baton Rouge, La.\n\nThe 60-year-old Blackburn, who has designed everything from lavatories to crematoria, is pleased about the possibility of cosmeticizing the world's cities. But just as significant, reports Blackburn, one urbanologist has found that 25 square\n\nyards of Grass Crete throw off enough oxygen to keep one person alive for a full year.” People 25 August 25 1975 Vol. 4 No. 8\n\nFormed in 1970 Grass Concrete Limited is a privately owned UK company http:/Awww.grasscrete.com 3 October 2016\n\nMarried to Jessie with 2 children\n\nHDE 22 May 1962, 22 March 1967, 2 May 1967, 31 July 1967\n\nBlackmoor & Mitchell Withers, practice of circa 1862-1869 William Blackmoor & John Brightmore Mitchell-Withers (1838-1894)\n\nObits Mitchell-Withers; Builder v66 17 March 1894\n\nAddresses: St James Street, Sheffield & Church Street, Rotherham\n\nSt Stephen’s Church, Rashcliffe (1862-4) Tenders,Hudderstield Chronicle 11 October 1862 Foundation stone Huddersfield Chronicle , 28 March 1863; pg. 8.

One of the best-known Leeds architects, Mr. W. S Braithwaite, of May House, died last night, after a long illness. Mr. who was 68 years of age started practice as an architect on South Parade, Leeds, when was twenty-five. During his long professional career designed many public buildings in the city. For several years architect to the Leeds Education Committee, was responsible for many schools and institutions, including the Home for the Blind, Blenheim Walk. He was also quantitative surveyor the Education Committee for some time, and carried out the quantitative work in connection with the Leeds Training College. He was the architect for the secondary schools at Elland and Castleford, and for the Penistone Grammar School, under the West Riding Education Committee, for which he also erected the Storthes Hall Asylum. The Poulton School, Morecambe was also his work. Many Leeds factories were designed by him, as well as public baths. He was also architect to the Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society. The Lawnwood Crematorium was his work. A number of chapels in Leeds were built to his designs, including the Tempest Road Chapel, which was destroyed fire last year. The firm in which Mr. Braithwaite was senior partner (he took Mr. H Jackman into partnership some three years ago) is now carrying out amongst other work, the reconstruction of the Tempest Road besides the erection of a temperance hall at Rawdon and the extension of Leeds Meat Markets. Mr Braithwaite’s one hobby was ecclesiastical music. He was chairman of the North-West Leeds Liberal Association for many years. He leaves a widow, two sons and three daughters.

Campbell was nominated for this appointment, and for substantial; personal reasons, Mr Campbell has finally decided not to accept the honour conferred upon him by the Belfast Corporation. Intimation of that decision has been duly forwarded.\n\n“The appointment, which is worth £800 a year and emoluments, was offered on Tuesday last to Mr. Campbell.

The ceremony was witnessed by a large assembly, and the greatest interest was manifested in the proceedings. The building is being erected from designs prepared by Mr K. F. Campbell, M. Inst. C.E. borough engineer, on a site in Church Walk, which has been acquired from Sir J. W. Ramsden on favourable terms, the area being 5,840 square yards.\n\n1921 The day after the council ratified his resignation (20 April 1921) an appreciation appeared in the Huddersfield Daily Examiner...\n\nMR. K. F. CAMPBELL’S WORK IN HUDDERSFIELD.\n\nOn the resignation of borough engineer by the late Mr. Dugdale Mr. Campbell was on November 26 1897, unanimously selected as his successor out of a large number of highly qualified candidates. The appointment has been amply justified by nearly a quarter of a\n\ncarrying out the work. This was accomplished in the short space of ten weeks. He also gave voluntary assistance in the designing and erecting of buildings for the Y.M. C.A. as an adjunct to the hospital.\n\nThe Bradley Sanatorium (Corporation Section) for tuberculous patients was erected from Mr. design and under his supervision, and was first used as an auxiliary hospital for wounded soldiers.\n\nRoad engineering has become a speciality, and is a matter of national as well as local importance. Reference to recent works carried out on the primary roads will speak of Mr. Campbell’s ability and up-to-date knowledge on this subject.\n\nDuring the period of over twenty-three years in which Mr. Campbell has served the town the works committed to his charge have totalled two and a half millions sterling. In all these big things his unostentatiousness and regard for the public interest as against any private pressure has been noteworthy. His Parliamentary experience and knowledge of the procedure of Government departments with which public bodies come so frequently in touch have been of great value, whilst his devotion to duty and capacity for hard work have always been noteworthy. In carrying out large undertakings of a kind for which many other towns have engaged specialists Mr. Campbell has undoubtedly saved the town large sums of money. He has never courted popularity — and has always taken great pride in his work. He has had invitations to more highly paid posts than Huddersfield but has voluntarily remained to complete his work here. That work will remain a testimony to his valuable services\n\nMr Campbell, after accepting pressing invitations from friends who are members of the I.CE (U.S.A.) to visit the Massachusetts experiments on sewerage disposal, is starting private in London so as to be in touch with several provincial towns in which he is well Known. In common with his many good friends in Huddersfield and neighbourhood, we wish him great success in his new career.\n\nHuddersfield Daily Examiner 21 April 1921 p4\n\nDied 24 Downs Road, Beckenham, 14th June 1939, intestate, a widower without issue or parent.\n\nThomas Carter, fl 1850s.\n\nAddresses:\n\n4 New Street,\n\nBuilding news v58, 7 Feb 1890, p221 Rocdale Observer 21 Aug 1971, p10 Victorian Society Annual 1993, p18-26 Portraits BAL Photographs Collection Building News v58, 7 Feb 1890, p202 RIBA Nomination Papers F v4 p33 RIBA Nomination Papers fiche reference: 81/E2 BAL Biography File\n\nSource Brodie Directory of British Architects 1834-1914\n\nThe most illustrious of our local architects, William Henry was the son of Henry Crossland, a stone merchant and quarry master. In the 1850s the family lived at Longwood House, Netheroyd Hill, where the father had conducted extensive quarries since 1845 when the Ramsden estate let of a quarry at Cowcliffe to \"a respectable stone merchant®.\"\n\nBy 1856 Crossland was a pupil in London with the celebrated architect George Gilbert Scott. It is probable that this favourable opening may have come about through the connection of the Rev. J Bateman, Vicar of Huddersfield from 1840 to 1855, with Scott. Bateman had known Scott from his youth’, when Scott's father had been Bateman's tutor, and could have made a recommendation, or an introduction might have been effected when Scott came to Huddersfield in 1852 to design St. Thomas's Church, Longroyd Bridge, for the Starkey family.\n\nCrossland is said to have practised in Huddersfield though no evidence has been met with to confirm this. If it was so then it is probable that it was between 1856, when he was in London, and 1861, when he was in practice in Halifax. In 1863 he was working in Leeds and by 1870 he was in London, and receiving the patronage of the Ramsden family.\n\nOne of his earliest designs must have been Netheroyd Hill Church of England Schools at Cowcliffe which he designed gratuitously, whilst still a pupil in London\n\nAug 1867-1873 HC references checked\n\nLOCAL WORKS. Cowcliffe and Netheroyd Hill Church of England Sunday School Opening Huddersfield Chronicle 29 March 1856\n\nresident agent to the estates of Thomas Thornhill, Esq , of Fixby. He was educated under Mr. James Clegg,of Rastrick, and, in 1823, was articled to Mr. Thomas Dinsley, of this town, surveyor, with whom he afterwards remained about two years. He then opened an office in the Packhorse-yard, and, about 1839, removed to the offices now occupied by the firm in New-street.\n\nMr. Crowther's early years were chiefly spent in making township surveys and valuations, under the Poor Law Act, 1834, laying out and constructing turnpike roads ; the construction of Longwood Reservoirs (Huddersfield having previous to this been supplied by wells and pumps) ; the making of reservoirs for manufacturing purposes; and the utilisation of water power upon surrounding streams. In the commencement of railways in this district, about 1840, Mr. Crowther was very extensively engaged in the pioneer work of selecting and laying out lines, at a time also when there was no ordnance map to assist in such a difficult country. Amongst many lines were the “Huddersfield and Manchester,\" and the “Leeds and Dewsbury.\" which are now part of the London and North-Western system. He was also engaged on many of the principal sales of property in the district. In recent years he laid out and made plans and working sections of the Farnley Branch and Kirkburton Railways; and in the preparation of many Parliamentary schemes affecting this district.\n\nPassing rapidly on we come to the great work of his life, viz., the designing (in conjunction with Mr. Hawksley) and construction of the Huddersfield Waterworks, which are now closely approaching completion, and which rank amongst the finest of such works in the kingdom. Amongst other things he was largely engaged in arbitration and the settlement of claims under the \"Railway Clauses\" and \"Land Clauses Consolidation Acts. Until April of last year his great activity and enemy continued unimpaired, when an attack of anginae pectoris compelled him to withdraw from all work where any bodily exertion was required. He died, as before stated, at a quarter to seven on Saturday, the 22nd instant, having succumbed more from the severity of the weather than the illness from which he was suffering.” Huddersfield Chronicle 29 January 1881 Funeral report and obituary Huddersfield Chronicle 29 January 1881 Buried in the family vault attached to Zion Chapel, Lindley\n\nProbate under £30,000\n\nGeorge Henry Crowther b c1843-1913 Born Fixby c1843 son of George Crowther d1881\n\nDied 6 March 1913\n\nAddresses of Crowther and Son, New Street Huddersfield Chronicle 23 June 1866\n\n38 New Street (1911)\n\nHome Fitzwilliam Street (1871 census) land agent & surveyor Thornhill Road (1891 census) civil engineer & surveyor Thorn Hill, Edgerton (1911 census) Thornhill (1913)\n\nShortlisted for post of Surveyor to Huddersfield Improvement Commissioners Huddersfield Chronicle 23 June 1866\n\nMarr Louisa Heron, Huddersfield 1869.\n\n“The death took place yesterday, his residence, Thornhill, Edgerton of Mr Charles (sic) Henry Crowther, principal of the firm G. and G.

He subsequently acted in several enclosure surveys including Stainland (1816), Golcar (1820), Whitley (1821), Netherthong (1826) and the Graveship of Holme (1828). Additionally when one of the Commissioners for the Longwood and Deanhead Enclosure died he was appointed to the post.\n\nHe surveyed a proposed turnpike road from Saddleworth to Shepley Lane Head via Holmfirth in 1819 and the line of the Halifax to Huddersfield Turnpike in 1823, a pursuit in which he was widely employed as appears from the following extract from a letter1/7 of 28th March 1823 from John Lister Kaye of Denby Grange to John Broughton of Thornton, near Skipton:\n\nif you want a surveyor who has been much employed in road surveying and making, I would recommend Thomas Dinsley, of Huddersfield, who has given great satisfaction in the accuracy of his levels and concomitant expenses in the survey and\n\nletting [of] fourteen miles of new road in this neighbourhood (from Marsden to Horbury Bridge) which has done him infinite credit.\n\nWith recommendations like the foregoing it is little wonder that Dinsley prospered. In 1838 he qualified as a Commissioner under the Act for the Lighting and Cleansing of the town of Huddersfield, and when he died in 1843 he left some £5,00019. He is buried in Holy Trinity burial ground.\n\nWhilst he is best remembered for his plan of the town of Huddersfield of 1825, he produced at least two others, one in 1828 for the Waterwork's Commissioners and another which was purchased by the Lighting and Cleansing Commissioners for twenty guineas in 1841. Other plans from his hand are for the sale of estates in Stainland and Old Lindley, no doubt in connection with the Stainland Enclosure of 1816, one relating to the Golcar Enclosure, one of the Huddersfield Water supply in 1819, and in 1824 for an intended Turnpike road from Wakefield to Denby Dale.\n\nBuried at Holy Trinity 29 July 1843\n\nFrederick Whittaker Dixon 1854-1935\n\nB Oldham Q2 1854 D Southport 16 Nov 1935 aged 81\n\nAddresses Windsor Road, Oldham (1892) Clegg Street, Oldham (1892) Oldham & Manchester (1903) Trevelyan Building, Corporation-street, Manchester (1897, 1903) Trevelyan Building, Corporation-street, Manchester and Oldham (1904) Vivian Street, Oldham (1926)\n\nsouthport from c1895 Hotel Windsor, Lord Street, Southport (1935)\n\nCareer\n\nWith E Potts and G Pickup of Potts, Pickup & Dixon of Manchester 1880-1889 (Lloyd's List 20 July 1889)\n\nFrom 1906 F W Dixon and Son Arbitrator in an Accrington masons strike (Lancashire Evening Post 2 July 1890)\n\nStood as Liberal candidate for Westwood Ward, Oldham Town Council Manchester Courier 25 February 1892\n\nElected to Southport Council 1904.

The brewery manager there in 1928, Rex Berry, had just secured a post in his real trade as architect for the Council in another and much larger town in the West Riding of Yorkshire. So Rex, with his wife Bertie and their two children, Dennis and Michael, packed their belongings and moved away fo live in a fine stone house in Huddersfield. They were good friends of my father and mother, and we regarded Dennis and Michael as cousins. Our two families often visited each other, had picnics together, went on trips to the seaside and abroad together, and remained on good terms until well after World War II, when the Berry family migrated to Rhodesia. After that, we never saw them again...\n\nhave already told you that my mother was called Enid Heppenstall, and that at the age of eighteen or nineteen she suffered the disease of alopecia, losing all of her lovely red hair. She was born in 1898, to a father who was a tailor, having a shop and rooms next to the Station Hotel in Boothferry Road. He was called Frederick Heppenstall, and was one of five children who were raised in the Station Hotel. I have no photograph of him, but I have two interesting mementoes: a coat hanger and a clothes brush, both bearing details of him and his tailoring trade. His father Icon, my great grandfather, was the landlord of that hotel, and perhaps its part- owner. In 1901 Icon was to do a business deal with a large Brewery firm by the name of S. Allsopp and Sons, whereby he acquired not only the North Street brewery, but also several of the public houses in and around Goole which it served. At the entrance to our North Street brewery, he had painted on the large black double doors the sign:\n\nICON HEPPENSTALL & SON, WINE AND SPIRIT MERCHANTS.\n\nThe chosen son was Harry, my great uncle. I never knew great grandfather Icon, because he died during World War I; but I was to see plenty of Uncle Harry. He became an architect, and worked in Huddersfield. He lived in a fine house, with several servants and a wife whom I knew as Aunt Annis. We visited him many times, sometimes staying the weekend and exploring the old Victorian house; it had three Stories and a basement, and many exciting rooms at attic level. He would occasionally come by train to Goole, and walk briskly down Boothferry Road from the Station, to check on the brewery and its management. The brewery would present him with a small but steady income.\n\nI found him a most cheerful man, who would entertain me by doing quick sketches of cowboys on the edges of his daily paper. He had a less entertaining habit of poking a finger in one’s ribs and squeaking like a spitting cat. He lived to the ripe age of 82, spending his last year or so in my bedroom (we moved into the brewery house when I was about twelve; I moved to a smaller bedroom when he came). My mother nursed him through this final period of his life.\n\nAutobiography of JohnTurner\n\nMarried Alice Maud Mary Priestley\n\n“My husbands grandfather came from England to US.

He qualified as an architect in 1925 and then became a partner making the firm Stocks, Sykes and Hickson.\n\nHickson was a member of the Territorial Army (Duke of Wellington’s Regiment), and retired with the rank of captain. From 1935 to 1942, he served in the Special Reserve of Officers of the Royal Engineers.\n\n“Captain Clifford Hickson, F.R.I.B.A., of Messrs.

This means that the work preparing the scheme will be set in motion immediately. The scheme calls for nearly the complete reconstruction of the centre Huddersfield based on possible future population of 200,000 with provision for new arterial roads, including by-pass to carry heavy east to west traffic, number of modern flats, new commercial buildings and new Industries. The report recommends that with regard to new industries and commercial buildings the Chamber of Commerce should approached, and connection with the replanning of shopping centres, the Huddersfield Chamber Trades should be consulted.\n\nThe report also states that the problems of traffic movement the central area will require to be carefully considered and recommends that ail through traffic and also public service vehicles should be excluded from the central shopping area, which Shall thereby be converted into precinct In which the shopping and business public can walk about comfort and freedom. The report also calls for survey the present housing conditions in the central area of the town and recommends that particulars should be obtained from the Housing Committee of their proposals in regard clearance schemes. Where large-scale demolitions are proposed it would helpful if the views of the tenants displaced were obtained whether they would like to be rehoused in the same locality or be transferred to a housing estate the suburbs of the town: also their views on the question of flats versus houses.\n\nThe report recommends that the theatre and amusement organisations and amateur societies, the licensed trade, religious bodies end the education authority should consulted. Maps, schedules and models are prepared which will show the results of the surveys, and these will the subject an exhibition before the scheme finally adopted the Council.

The sad event took place yesterday morning, death resulting from pneumonia. The deceased, who had reached an advanced age, was never married. He resided in Fitzwilliam-street, and was so reserved as to have but few intimates. At the same time he was a gentleman of much kindliness and culture, and his duties, which brought him into contact with many prominent citizens, were always carefully discharged. Deceased was a Churchman, being a regular attendant at the Parish Church. To many people his death will be a matter of deep regret.

Lilian Kirk?\n\nson Frederic ‘Fred’ Kirk, architect, b c1860, d 1/7 September 1914\n\nJohn Kirk was born in 1817 and baptised at Queen Street Wesleyan Chapel, the son of John and Elizabeth Kirk, who had moved to Huddersfield from York. John Kirk senior is noted in 1830 as a joiner at ‘top of green , no doubt close to the area of the present day Kirk's Yard, off Trinity Street. Both he and his second wife died in 1843, leaving three children, a son, John junior, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, both under the age of ten. John who was already married with two infant sons probably had to take immediate responsibility for his two sisters, and certainly they were living with his family in 1851. The census of that year would seem to indicate that he was prospering for he is described as a master builder employing thirty men. He had been brought up as a joiner, and the move to builder is a natural and understandable progression, though indicating an organisational and entrepreneurial flair. The move to architect is more difficult to understand, and it may have been that the building enterprise was not as successful as appears. The thirty employees quoted in the census could be somewhat misleading, as labour would be engaged for specific works\n\nDewsbury and James at Huddersfield. At the time of his death in March 1886 he was the oldest architect in Huddersfield, and almost certainly the most prolific. He designed several chapels in the Huddersfield area, as the following list shows, but he was responsible also for others at Skipton, Calverley, Pudsey, Dewsbury, Heckmondwike, Shipley and Wombwell, and for churches at Dewsbury and Thornton Hough on the Wirral.\n\n14 Huddersfield Weekly Chronicle, 13.3.1886. 15 Huddersfield Chronicle, 28.5.1853. 16 Huddersfield Chronicle, 3.3.1855. 17 Huddersfield Weekly Chronicle, 13.3.1886. 18 Huddersfield Weekly Chronicle, 13.3.1886.\n\n©Edward Law http://homepage.eircom.net/~lawedd/ARCHITECTS.htm\n\nJohn Kirk & Sons c1850-c1914\n\nAddresess Offices on John William Street and moving to offices previously occupied by the Telegraphic Company at the corner of Lion Arcade (1859) Huddersfield Chronicle 10 December 1859 Corner shop of Lion Arcade (Yorkshire Post 1 July 1911) New Street (Yorkshire Post 1 July 1911) Market Place (1914)\n\nWORKS. 1850 Baptist Chapel Lockwood Huddersfield Chronicle 27 April 27, 1850; pg. 7\n\nJohn Kirk, “builder” makes a cabinet for display of local products for the Great Exhibition Huddersfield Chronicle , March 22, 1851; pg. 4\n\nJuly, 1852, new Lodge Room at the Rose & Crown.

Nowadays, Mr Lunn —who is son of Mr. J. E. Lunn, chairman of the Huddersfield Housing Committee—is in practice on his own account in the town, but has also had experience in the United States. He was the offices of Messrs, Wald and Corbett in New York City, and was engaged on an 84-storey skyscraper. One of his own projects is a National Library, a sort of British Museum-cum-Bodleian. It was with designs for such a scheme that he was Finalist for the Soane Medallion. Mr. Lunn was trained at Liverpool University's School of Architecture, where also took course in Civic Design, There he graduated as B.Arch., secured his A.R.1.B.A. and was awarded the Graduate Scholarship in Arts; becoming also Finalist for the Rome Scholarship. His new survey, which will occupy six weeks or so has for its aim to institute a comparison: between the historical growth the buildings of the three capitals—Paris, Rome, Vienna—and show the way they are meeting the common problem in modern development..

For the past three years he was chairman of the Bronte Society, and lately on the Council of the Leeds Thoresby Society. He was also member of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society, the Newcastle Society Antiquaries, and the Oakwell Hall Preservation Committee. He was one the founders and secretary the old Leeds Musical Union, and member of the Leeds Philharmonic Society. Yorkshire Post 25 June 1938\n\nFrederick Moorhouse, d. 1898\n\nThe period during which he practised in Huddersfield was short; he was known to be working in Halifax from 1822 to 1827, and is noted in Huddersfield in 1830 and 1831, though it is probable that he moved to the area in 1828 when his three local churches were all being built. His output included a number of churches over a very wide area, many of which were commissioned by the Church Building Commissioners.\n\nLike W H Crossland, arguably the most talented of Huddersfield architects, Oates was the son of a quarry owner, and the knowledge of stone working and the properties of the material would be a most useful asset for the architect.\n\nOf his secular work in Huddersfield the Lockwood Baths have been defaced from an aesthetic view, but the Huddersfield and Upper, Agbrigg Infirmary, his final building remains a fitting memorial to an outstanding talent. The design for the infirmary was selected by competition, and Oates's obituary (Halifax and Huddersfield Express 28 May 1831) records \"he bore away the palm from some of the most celebrated architects of' the day particularly at the Huddersfield Infirmary.\n\nThe minutes of the Infirmary contain what little evidence is known of Oates in Huddersfield; shortly before his death in May 1831 he was living at Springwood when the practice was known as Oates, Pickersgill & Oates. The two surviving partners, his brother Matthew and Thomas Pickersgill completed the works which the firm had in hand, but practised in York.\n\nAn episode which shows the stature of Oates is recorded in the Infirmary minutes when in 1830 the Committee were asked to consider the following letter:-\n\nMarch 16 1830, Springwood, I beg to inform you that I will attend the meeting of the Committee of the Huddersfield & Upper Agbrigg Infirmary on the evening of Thursday next the 18th inst. when I hope the Committee will take into consideration the circumstances of the Longwood Edge stone introduced by Mr Joseph Kaye contrary to his agreement instead of' the Radcliffe delf stone & decide whether the same shall be permitted to remain or must be taken down. lam sir, yours very respectfully, John Oates. To J C Laycock Esq.\n\nWe have already noted Oates's background which would enable him to detect the deception, and the credit which accrues to him is not from the detection of the departure from specification, but rather in pursuing the matter. Joseph Kaye (qv), the celebrated Huddersfield builder, was already a man of some standing, a major employer in the town and not without influence. He was in fact on the Committee of the Infirmary, and Oates had worked extensively with him on three churches. To have pursued the matter appears as the action of a principled and fearless man. The decision of the Committee \"that Mr Oates the architect and under his directions the Clerk of Works are hereby instructed to see the terms of the contract and the specification strictly observed\", reflects well on that body.\n\n1869 work on Lascelles Hall brewery for Richard Durrans court case Chronicle 23 July 1870\n\nSt Marks School Room, Longwood Heights Opening bazaar Huddersfield Chronicle 6 April 1872\n\nNoted as an architect in the town from 1843 to 1872, he was a member of the family which founded the present building firm of John Radcliffe & Son in the early years of the 19th century.\n\nIt is possible that he worked extensively with the building firm, for in the local papers which through the 1860s carried advertisements for the letting of contracts by architects there is only one instance for James Radcliffe, in 1869, when he was letting the rebuilding of Bankhouse Mill, Milnsbridge. About 1844 he had produced plans for enlarging a mill dam associated with John Whitacre's Woodhouse Whitacre had about that time been' commissioning a new mill, and although the names of several parties who were involved in the planning are known, Radcliffe was not amongst them. He was, however, involved with some of the ancillary works; in 1845 he presented estimates for completing eight cottages at Woodhouse mill, and the year before for a \"willey-place\" — a room for a willowing-machine. In the 1850s he acted for the Thornhill estate. We may imagine from what few details we do know of him that he was another of the mill architects, in the mould of James Leech, aclass of architect for whom little evidence appears.\n\nMarr Mary Ann (b c1820 Almondbury, d 17 July 1867 aged 47) Huddersfield Chronicle - Saturday 20 July 1867\n\nIsabella b c1842 Ellen b c 1843 Honoria b c1845 Clara b c1847 Albert Shaw b c 1849 James Alfred b c 1850 John W b c1854 George Ab c1858\n\n29 West Yorkshire Record Office C296/233.\n\n©Edward Law http://homepage.eircom.net/~lawedd/ARCHITECTS.htm\n\nS Radcliffe, fl, 1868.

It consists of 43 square and 4 oblique arches. The skew arch over the Bradford road is constructed on the very quick angle of 37 degrees 30 minutes and 39 feet from the road line, to the line of the rails; with a versed sine of nine feet 6 inches, and a chord line of 67 feet. We understand that even this extremely quick angle is not the extent to which, by strict geometrical principles, an oblique arch can be constructed.\n\nThe directors had a beautifully finished model of this bridge placed in the dining room of the George Hotel, and also on the left of the chairman during dinner there was hung a highly finished geometrical drawing, 4 ft. 6 in. by 2 ft. 6 in., executed by Josephus J. Roebuck, contractor's assistant, (who delineated and superintended the whole of the oblique bridges on the contract) and which we heard named as ranking amongst the first class a drawing, and of equal merit as a delineation of an oblique arch. It consists of plan, elevation, and four sections, and sectional elevations, showing almost every outward stone In the bridge, and fully proving if that there are few operations of art to which the man of science can apply his speculative principles with such effect as in the erection of an oblique arch.

In examination by Mr. Pope, official receiver, the debtor stated that he was for six years managing director the Lascelles Hall Brewery Co., Limited, at a salary of £150 year, which appointment kept up to 1894. The company then went into voluntary liquidation, and he executed a deed of assignment to a trustee. His liabilities were £4,500, and were mainly in connection with debts which he had made himself personally liable for as managing director of the brewery. Mr. J. F. Dyson, Queen-street, Huddersfield, was the trustee. His assets had realised £320, but no dividend had been paid. He afterwards went to London and purchased the White Swan, for which paid £3,500. Prior to becoming interested in the brewery had carried on business as architect at Blackburn for some 25 years. His son persuaded him to go into the brewery business, in which he invested some £11,000. When the business was turned into a company received £11,000 in fully paid shares, addition to becoming managing director £150 a year. He then came to London, and answer to advertisement he purchased the White Hart, the value of which, he alleged, was misrepresented. He now owed £4,301 15s 5d, of which £1,099 7s 9d was unsecured, and the assets were £629 12s.—The examination was concluded. Preston Herald 7 March 1896,\n\nTHE AFFAIBS OF W. STEPHENSON VABLEY, LATE OF LASCELLES HALL At the London Bankruptcy Court to-day, a sitting was held before Mr. Registrar Hope for the public examination of W. Stephenson Varley, described as of the \"White Hart,\" Old- street, St. Luke's, formerly of Lascelles Hall, near Huddersfield, managing director. In examination by Mr. Pope, Official Receiver, the bankrupt stated that he was for six years managing director of the Lascelles Hall Brewery Company (Limited), at a salary of £150 a year, which appointment he kept up to March, 1894. The company then went into volun-tary liquidation, and he executed a deed of assignment to a trustee. His liabilities were £4,500, and were mainly in connection with debts which he had made himself personally liable for as managing director of the brewery. Mr. J. F. Dyson, Queen- street, Huddersfield, was the trustee. His assets had realised £320, but no dividend had been paid. He afterwards came to London, and purchased the \"White Swan,\" for which he gave £3,500. Prior to becoming interested in the brewery he had carried on business as an architect at Blackburn for some 25 years. His son persuaded him to go into the brewery business, in which he invested some £11,000 When the business was turned into a company he received £11,000 in fully paid shares, in addition to becoming managing director at £150 a year. He then came to London, and in answer to an advertisement he purchased the \" White Hart,” the value of which, he alleged, was misrepresented.

At a sitting of the London Bankruptcy Court, held to-day, before Mr. Registrar Hope, this bankrupt attended for public examination, applying to pass upon accounts showing gross liabilities £4,301 15s. 5d., of which £1,099 7s. 9d. is unsecured, and assets £629 12s. 4d. In reply to Mr. C. A. Pope, Official Receiver, the bankrupt stated that for upwards of 25 years he had carried on business as an architect at Blackburn. He gave that up about seven years ago, being induced by his son to join him in the purchase of a brewery carried on at Lascelles Hall, and known as the Lascelles Hall Brewery. At that time he had a capital of £11,000, with which he was able to purchase the brewery, but as a matter of fact his son had a half share in it with him. Witness subsequently took over the whole concern, and sold it to a company that was promoted with a capital of £25,000, and registered as the Lascelles Hall Brewery Company (Limited). For his interest in the concern witness received £11,000 in fully-paid shares of the company, and was appointed managing director at a salary of £150 a year. He denied that he had made himself personally responsible for goods supplied to the company, but stated that prior to its formation he had purchased goods to the value of £4,500 in order to keep it going. After the voluntary liquidation of the company in March, 1894, witness personally executed a deed of assignment to Mr. J. F. Dyson, accountant, Huddersfield. He believed that the assets had realised only £320, and that no dividend had been paid. He then left the neighbourhood and removed to London, took the White Hart public-house, St. Luke's, which he purchased for £3,500 and carried on down to the failure. The value of that house was misrepresented to him ; the takings were put to him at £290 a month, but they had never exceeded £240, and witness was consequently unable to keep up his payments, with the result that the receiving order was eventually made against him. Further accounts being required by creditors, the hearing was adjourned to enable them to be furnished by the bankrupt.

After leaving Newcastle and a brief stay in Leeds he went to London, where he worked with several leading building firms and became involved in the erection of important public buildings, such as the British Museum and the Houses of Parliament.\n\nIn 1844 he was articled to an architect's office for twelve months. After having completed his articles at an architect's office, he had become connected with the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott. In this position ‘he erected many public and private buildings in various parts of the country’, which occupation kept him away from London for lengthy periods. In 1861 in Brecon where he acted as clerk to the works he decided to stay in the town, married, and set up his own business as an architect. He lived in Brecon until the middle of the 1870s, when he moved to Wandsworth where he died aged 66.\n\nWalton was one of the lesser-known radical politicians of working-class origin in the mid-Victorian era. He was a prolific author of newspaper contributions on most political and social questions of his time, with a particular interest in land and parliamentary reform.
