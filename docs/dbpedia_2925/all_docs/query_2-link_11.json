        "text": "A wood-sided, gable-roofed structure sheltered a Pratt-truss bridge, with a single span of 140 feet and a height of 35 feet. According to the National Register of Historic Places (1976), it was \"...one of the tallest covered bridges in the U.S.\" (See William J. Murtagh, National Register of Historic Places, Washington, DC: US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 1976)], p. 75.)\n\nThis bridge was renovated during the Depression Era, in 1938, to accommodate pedestrian traffic."
