        "text": "BEN LOMOND >> After years of falling into disrepair, a historical downtown church is once again serving the community, as the new family medicine office of Dr. Steven Leib.\n\nKnown as “Wee Kirk,” the former Presbyterian church was built about 1891 by lumber mill owner James Pierce. Pierce, who planned much of Ben Lomond’s early development, offered the church to any denomination that would buy it. He intended the building, now listed by Santa Cruz County as a historic resource and the San Lorenzo Valley’s oldest church, to serve the public, said Lisa Robinson, San Lorenzo Valley Historical Society president.\n\nThe Central Street building was last used as a church in 1968, and has since changed owners multiple times. Most recently, it was used as storage for an online bath and spa boutique.\n\nVivian Leib said when she and her husband bought the property in February, the building needed extensive repair, such as new flooring and ceilings. The couple hired carpenters and painters, but managed the project themselves, working 18-hour days while still managing an office in Scotts Valley.\n\nRepairing the church was a labor of love, she said.\n\n“Every decision that went into the place, we thought of it historically,” said Vivian Leib, who said even the old-fashioned exam tables were chosen to keep a consistent look.\n\nFamily feel\n\nThe Ben Lomond couple, who lives in a restored Victorian farmhouse, enjoys a vintage aesthetic, said Steven Leib. They repaired the church’s bell tower and stained glass windows, adorned with some of the valley’s early settlers.\n\n“It’s got the Norman Rockwellian feel, but it’s not the old-fashioned medicine,” said Steven Leib, who said his practice focuses on preventing chronic diseases such as diabetes using advanced tools.\n\nWanting to practice family medicine in a small town, Steven Leib began his career taking over for Felton’s Dr. Ashby Steele, then an 81-year-old country doctor, he said.\n\nSteele built his practice by focusing on relationships, an approach that has stayed with Leib, who has since worked in the San Lorenzo Valley for more than 25 years, he said. Leib said moving his practice to Ben Lomond allows him to continue working with his wife, who manages the office, and also bring his dog, Mollie, to work. The family feel brings comfort to patients, he said.\n\nVivian Leib said the patients are her neighbors, and when they call, they don’t bother introducing themselves.\n\n“Certainly no one would give me their client number, and often times not even their last name,” she said. “And sometimes I even know them by their voice.”\n\nLarger trend\n\nThe Leibs, with Lisa Robinson’s help, are seeking to list the building on the national registry of historic places. San Lorenzo has five places on the list, including the San Lorenzo Valley Museum and the Felton Covered Bridge.\n\nRobinson said the Leib’s project is part of a larger trend of historic building remodels in the valley, including Felton’s Cremer House, a former hotel recently reopened as a restaurant.\n\nAt the San Lorenzo Valley Museum, where she is the collections manager, Robinson said she’s seen an uptick of visitors who have bought Victorian homes and are seeking historic photos to aid their remodel.\n\n“These types of buildings really rebuild the community,” Robinson said. “They’ve been around for over 100 years, 120 years. I think people are becoming more aware this is part of the valley’s history.”"
