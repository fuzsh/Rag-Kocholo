        "text": "Santa Cruz County, California Bridges: SCBG Railway Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nMarch 2014 (37.03379 Degrees, -122.05809 Degrees) San Lorenzo River Bridge\n\nYou can tell the role railroads played in the development of Santa Cruz County because of the number of railroad bridges that are still around. Today's bridge is now part of the Santa Cruz, Big Trees, and Pacific Railway (SCBG). We have seen a few old railroad lines being reused as tourist trains like the wine train in Napa and the SCBG. Today's bridge can be identified as location #3 on the map below.\n\nThe bridge consists of a steel plate through girder span and a Warren through truss span over the San Lorenzo River. This bridge was built in 1906 and was used for carrying everything from fresh strawberries to lumber and it's now a passenger train.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: SCBG Railway Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: State Route 9 Highway Bridge and SCBG Railway Bridge across Rincon Gulch\n\nMarch 2014 (37.00556, -122.04500) Rincon Gulch Bridges\n\nA concrete T girder highway bridge and a timber trestle railway bridge were built side by side across Rincon Gulch in Big Trees State Park.\n\nThe Rincon Gulch Highway Bridge (36 0037) carries State Route 9 on a three span T girder superstructure with two column bents that were built in 1930 and retrofitted with infill walls in 1996.\n\nThe timber trestle bridge includes a steel girder span over a dirt road that rests on a steel tower pier to help support the near side.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: State Route 9 Highway Bridge and SCBG Railway Bridge across Rincon Gulch by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: SR17-SR1 Cnnnection Separation\n\nMarch 2014 (36.99039 Degrees, -122.02141 Degrees) SR17-SR1 Connectors\n\nYou get to Santa Cruz either by driving west through the mountains on SR17 or by driving along the coast on SR1. The SR17-SR1 Connector Separation (36 0069L/R) is a pair of precast girder bridges that carry traffic over SR1. They were built in 1958 and seismically retrofit in 1996. It looks like the bridges have bin-type abutments, which means they have curtain walls that hide the slope and abutment. The open barrier rail makes the bridges look older. Probably open barrier rail was the architectural treatment for bridges near the coast.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: SR17-SR1 Cnnnection Separation by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Riverside Avenue Bridge across the San Lorenzo River (2)\n\nJanuary 1983 (36.9678 Degrees, -122.0189 Degrees) Riverside Avenue Bridge\n\nCity workers using a crane on the Riverside Avenue Bridge try to loosen a log jam. The photo was taken during one of the storms of 1983 that caused the San Lorenzo River to flood.\n\nDate: January 3, 1983\n\nPlace: Santa Cruz City\n\nSource of Information: Graham Hill Water Treatment Plant\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Riverside Avenue Bridge across the San Lorenzo River (2) by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: South Marsh to Hummingbird Island Ford across a tributary of Elkhorn Slough\n\nOctober 1997 (36.824025 Degrees, -121.73945 Degrees) South Marsh Ford\n\nA ford is an inexpensive bridge designed to carry people across bodies of water when they are below flood stage and to survive vehicles during flood stage. We have studied fords in India and also in many rural parts of California where there is no money to build a bridge.\n\nToday's ford carries pedestrians from South Marsh to Hummingbird Island across a tributary of the Elkhorn Slough. We can see a transmission Tower from the nearby Moss Landing Power Plant, which is nearby at the beach.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: South Marsh to Hummingbird Island Ford across a tributary of Elkhorn Slough by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Grant Street UC across State Route 1\n\nJune 2007 ( 36.9862 Degrees, -122.0237 Degrees) Grant Street UC\n\nSurprisingly, although the epicenter of the 1989 M7.1 Loma Prieta Earthquake was in Santa Cruz County, almost all the bridge damage was 60 miles to the north in San Francisco and Alameda Counties. There were only two state bridges that were damaged in Santa Cruz County besides the Struve Slough Bridge that we studied on March 8, 2014. These were the Corallitos Creek Bridge and today's bridge, the Grant Street Undercrossing. However, the damage to these bridges was much less serious than at Struve Slough and it was quickly repaired. There were also several county bridges that were damaged during the 1989 Earthquake. More information on bridge damage during the Loma Prieta Earthquake can be found in theUSGS Professional Paper 1552-B Highway Systems.\n\nThe Grant Street UC (36 0075) is a four span precast I girder bridge on two-column bents. During the earthquake the expansion joints banged together spalling some concrete (see photo above), the bearing keeper plates were knocked off at the abutments (see photo below), and the embankments around the abutments settled, which damaged the bridge approaches.\n\nA repair contract was written after the earthquake (see figure below) and the bridge was also seismically strengthened with an infill wall retrofit in 1996. However, some of the earthquake damage can still be seen today (see figure at bottom).\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Grant Street UC across State Route 1 by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Powder Works Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nMarch 2014 (37.01049 Degrees, -122.04384 Degrees) Powder Works Bridge\n\nTwo miles north of downtown Santa Cruz on the San Lorenzo River is the Powder Works Bridge. A paper mill was built at this location in 1860 but the area gained renown as the site of an explosives plant that began operations in 1864. The US Library of Congress writes:\"The Powder Works Bridge is the second oldest of twenty-one extant Smith truss covered bridges in the United States. It was built in 1872 for the California Powder Works, the first powder mill on the Pacific Coast, and is one of the last vestiges of the company's extensive manufacturing complex that occupied the site from 1861 to 1914. The bridge is an excellent example of the early work of the Pacific Bridge Company, a nationally significant bridge engineering firm.\n\nIn 1924 the property was purchased by the Freemasons and turned into Paradise Park with picnic grounds and brightly painted houses.\n\nThe Powder Works Bridge is a 180 ft long two span timber truss covered bridge. It is currently being considered by the National Park Service as a National Historic Landmark. The Felton Covered Bridge that we studied on March 18, 2014 is registered as a historic place, but it was rebuilt and moved and so it wouldn't qualify as a historic landmark. Since the Powder Works Bridge is on private land, it's up to the park residents to decide if they want their bridge to become a famous landmark.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Powder Works Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Cabrillo Highway (SR-1) Bridges across the San Lorenzo River\n\nMarch 2014 (36.98500, -122.02667 Degrees) Cabrillo Highway Bridges\n\nOne last pair of bridges across the San Lorenzo River. The Cabrillo Highway (State Route 1) Bridges (36 0071L/R) are 4-span T beam bridges that share a single set of pier walls. The bridges were built in 1956 and were never renovated or retrofitted. They are 230 ft long with a pair of 80 foot spans over the river.\n\nSanta Cruz County seems like a land lost to time. There were a lot of bridges built 50 to 100 years ago, but nothing much has been built recently. There are no major highways and it's a long, difficult drive on two lane roads to get in and out of Santa Cruz County. The Google earth photo below shows the county is between the San Gregorio and the San Andreas Faults, which have pushed up the land and created the San Lorenzo River between them.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Cabrillo Highway (SR-1) Bridges across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Wood's Lagoon Bridges\n\nMarch 2014 (36.96778, -122.00278) Wood's Lagoon Bridges\n\nA little east of the mouth of the San Lorenzo River is Wood's Lagoon, which is crossed by two bridges. The Murray-Eaton Street Bridge (36C0108) is a 544 ft long, 9-span precast girder bridge that was built in 1963. The spans are 60 ft long and sit on two column bents with large caissons. Next to the highway bridge is the SCBG Railway bridge with precast box girder spans on tapered pier walls and with similar caissons, which were made by filling soldier pile cofferdams with concrete.\n\nWood's Lagoon was turned into a protected harbor for yachts and other small craft. The two bridges look similar enough to suggest they were built by the same contractor, maybe at around the time they were building the harbor.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Wood's Lagoon Bridges by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: SCBG Railway Bridge across Soquel Creek\n\nMarch 2014 (36.97321 Degrees,-121.95347 Degrees) SCBG Railway Bridge\n\nFollowing the Southern Pacific Railroad to the east we arrived in the town of Capitola and at an unusual Pratt deck truss bridge with a curved bottom chord. They must have had a compelling reason for building the truss under the deck: perhaps because the deck was so high and there was little ship traffic below. The truss span is 140 ft long and sits on pier walls at each end.\n\nThere was discussion of this unusual bridge on the Bridgehunter Website. One writer called it a 'Fishbelly Deck Truss' and said that it was used when an existing substructure was reused but required a stronger (and deeper) truss in the center of the span. A narrow gauge railroad was being built across Soquel Creek in 1874 but this deep structure was probably a replacement for the original bridge, perhaps built at the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe tracks and bridges are now owned by the Santa Cruz, Big Trees, and Pacific Railway, although I don't believe they currently provide service into Capitola. Perhaps that's why people walk on the track with such impunity.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: SCBG Railway Bridge across Soquel Creek by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: SCBG Railroad Bridge across Capitola Avenue\n\nMarch 2014 (36.97393 Degrees, -121.95321 Degrees) SCBG Railroad Bridge\n\nEast of yesterday's truss bridge is a tall timber trestle bridge with a reinforced concrete span over Capitola Avenue. The superstructure looks like a precast box girder, similar to the span over Wood's Lagoon. It is supported by precast concrete pile extensions that are similar to the timber trestle substructure. Probably the concrete span was built more recently than the trestle bridge.\n\nI tried to take a better photo of the timber trestle but found I was invading the privacy of someone in their backyard. A strange thing about Capitola is that it is very touristy, but the residents defiantly build their yards, gazebos, and breakfast tables in plain view of the tourists, like an indigenous people who live their lives in front of anthropologists.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: SCBG Railroad Bridge across Capitola Avenue by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: North Aptos Underpass across State Route 1\n\nMarch 2014 (36.97556 Degrees, -121.90556 Degrees) North Aptos Underpass\n\nEast of Capitola, the railroad line runs like a sine wave between Highway 1 and the Pacific Ocean before finally crossing the highway at a 52 degree skew on a two span through girder bridge. The North Aptos Underpass (36 0012) is a 147 ft long bridge that was built in 1946 and retrofitted in 1996.\n\nThe plate girders sit on tall rocker bearings. It appears that the retrofit increased the abutment and pier wall seats so if the rocker bearings were to fall forward, the girders would still be supported.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: North Aptos Underpass across State Route 1 by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California County: Union Pacific Railroad Bridge across Aptos Creek\n\nMarch 2014 (36.97644 Degrees,-121.90391 Degrees) Aptos Creek Underpass\n\nAfter carefully avoiding roads and rivers east of Capitola, the railroad line abruptly crosses Highway 1, Soquel Drive, and a couple of rivers in a series of complicated, multi-level alignments. Today's Union Pacific Railroad Bridge (36C0077) crosses over Aptos Creek on deep plate girders (supported by steel piers on concrete pier walls). The end span crosses over Soquel Drive on a blue through girder span (see photo below).\n\nThe design looks so haphazard, that I would have thought it was a temporary arrangement, except that both alignments have been at this site for over 80 years. The span over Soquel Drive is about 70 ft long and the whole alignment (measured on Google earth) is about 240 ft long.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California County: Union Pacific Railroad Bridge across Aptos Creek by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Union Pacific Bridges\n\nMarch 2014 (36.97583 Degrees, -121.89778 Degrees) Union Pacific Bridges\n\nToday's blog presents several Union Pacific railroad bridges that cross roads, rivers, and expressways as we continue southeast through Santa Cruz County The first bridge is the South Aptos Underpass (36C0069) a single span steel stringer bridge on seat type abutments that crosses over Soquel Drive (see photo above). This bridge is 65 ft long and it was built in 1924.\n\nThe next bridge is a 3-span steel plate girder structure with a very deep and long center span across Valencia Creek.\n\nThe next bridge carries the Union Pacific railroad back across State Route 1. The South Aptos Underpass (36 0003) is a 2-span, 89 ft long steel stringer bridge that was built in 1948.\n\nJust east of the South Aptos Underpass the railroad tracks descend below grade and are crossed by Rio Del Mar Blvd on the Aptos Overhead (36C0114). Continuing to the east, the tracks are carried by several timber trestles over ravines that drain into the Pacific.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Union Pacific Bridges by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Glenwood Drive Bridge across Bean Creek\n\nMarch 2014 (37.09734,-121.99634 Degrees) Glenwood Driver Bridge\n\nWe return to northwest Santa Cruz County to look at bridges that were overlooked in our study of San Lorenzo River and railroad bridges. As can be seen in the photo above, this area is covered in thick green mosses due to the heavy fogs that sit along the coast.\n\nToday's bridge carries Glenwood Drive over Bean Creek. Its a reinforced concrete closed spandrel arch bridge that was built in 1915 and eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The Glenwood Drive Bridge (36C0048) is 44 ft long with a 20 ft arch span and 12 ft long approaches.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Glenwood Drive Bridge across Bean Creek by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Cabrillo Highway Bridge across Soquel Creek and Wharf Road\n\nMarch 2014 (36.98333 Degrees, -121.95833 Degrees) Cabrillo Highway Bridge\n\nIt took me several tries before I found a way under this big arch bridge that carries State Route 1 across Soquel Creek. The bridge is over 100 ft wide and includes four arch ribs that are 126 ft long that soar 50 ft above the creek. It was built in 1947 by Caltrans and seismically retrofitted in 1995.\n\nThe arch is just one span of the 324 ft long Soquel Creek and Wharf Road Bridge (36 0013) that includes several slab spans (see photo below). A careful retrofit would be required to ensure the large demands on the arch doesn't damage the short columns of the slab bridge.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Cabrillo Highway Bridge across Soquel Creek and Wharf Road by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Stockton Avenue Bridge across Soquel Creek\n\nMarch 2014 (36.97243 Degrees, -121.95287 Degrees) Stockton Avenue Bridge\n\nContinuing eastward we arrived at a 3-span haunched box girder bridge across Soquel Creek. The Stockton Avenue Bridge (36C0110) is 138 ft long with an 85 ft long center span. The bridge was designed by D.M. McPhetres and built in 1934 by the Leo Cardwell Construction Company.\n\nThis bridge crosses the creek right at its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. The bridge is 30 ft wide including traffic lanes, shoulders, and sidewalks. It's supported on wide pier walls with an architectural facade on the outside face that supports the lampposts. The haunched girders and open banister railing along with the piers and lampposts provides a pleasing appearance to this old bridge.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Stockton Avenue Bridge across Soquel Creek by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Soquel Drive Bridge across Aptos Creek\n\nMarch 2014 (36.97631, -121.90366 Degrees) Soquel Drive Bridge\n\nContinuing to the east we arrived at a long arch bridge across Aptos Creek. The Soquel Drive Bridge (36C0075) was built in 1928 and sits under the Union Pacific Railway Bridge. The roadway bridge is 253 ft long with a 136 ft long center span. Like the previously studied Stockton Avenue Bridge, this structure was designed by D.M McPhetres but it was built by the Thompson Brothers. Both bridges are eligible for the National Register of Historical Places.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Soquel Drive Bridge across Aptos Creek by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Aptos Creek Fire Road Bridge across Aptos Creek\n\nMarch 2014 (37.00139, -121.90667 Degrees) Aptos Creek Fire Road Bridge\n\nContinuing upstream on Aptos Creek we arrived at the Forest of Nisene Marks State Park. In the park was what looked like an old Bailey Bridge (36P0015) on concrete abutments across the creek. The bridge must have been put up by the park rangers. It was built in 1955 and it's 73 ft long.\n\nA big subdivision is being built around the park and so I had a hard time finding the bridge because they were building houses across the old forest roads going into the park.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Aptos Creek Fire Road Bridge across Aptos Creek by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Green Valley Road Bridge across Casserly Creek Tributary #1\n\nMarch 2014 (36.98778, -121.77694) Green Valley Road Bridge\n\nContinuing east across Santa Cruz County we arrived at the Green Valley Road Bridge (36C0117). This is a single-span closed spandrel arch bridge that was built in 1915. The bridge is 24 ft long and 21 ft wide. I saw a lot of poison oak along the river banks so I didn't climb down to get a better photo.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Green Valley Road Bridge across Casserly Creek Tributary #1 by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧"
