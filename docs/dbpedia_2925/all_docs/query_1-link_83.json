        "text": "Permits have been issued for the construction of a large mixed-use building at 4112 Lancaster Avenue in Haverford North, West Philadelphia. The development will stand four stories tall and will hold 37 residential units, with a commercial space to be situated on the ground floor, as well as a green roof, which allowed developers to build to a greater density. The building will total 43,791 square feet of space and will cost an estimated $6,767,831 to build.\n\nConcrete work has begun for the foundation at the 13-story One uCity Square in University City, West Philadelphia, after months of excavation. Designed by ZGF Architects and developed by Ventas Inc., the project is a key component of the 14-acre uCity Square development that will span multiple blocks. The building will eventually rise 250 feet tall and will feature office and lab space with Century Therapeutics and Integral Molecular, as well as retail space.\n\nConstruction is nearing completion at a three-story multi-family project located at 2509 Grays Ferry Avenue in Graduate Hospital, South Philadelphia. The development will hold four luxury residential units, each one counting three bedrooms. Eileen and Gary Schwalb are the listed owners.\n\nPermits have been issued for the construction of a multi-family structure at 1825 Diamond Street in the Temple University area in North Philadelphia. The development will stand three stories tall and hold five residential units. Designed by KCA Design Associates, the building will hold 7,240 square feet of space and cost an estimated $1 million to build. 1825 Diamond Street LLC is the listed owner.\n\nConstruction at the Drexel College of Nursing and Health Professions in University City in West Philadelphia has been underway for the past few months, and the steel structure currently rises high enough to start making an impact on the skyline. Designed and developed by Wexford Science & Technology LLC, the 185-foot-tall structure will feature a fa√ßade with a mix of staggered glass of varying shades. The structure now rises seven stories tall, just past halfway on the way to its eventual 12-story height. The building is a part of the 14-acre uCity Square project that will dramatically raise the profile several city blocks."
