        "text": "LINDENTHAL\n\nAt the peak of his career, Gustav Lindenthal would be hailed as “the Nestor” (as had Cooper before him) and also would become known as the “dean” of American bridge engineers, but his life seemed to be a constant striving to establish and maintain himself as precisely those things while holding fast to a dream that was never to be realized, even though he invested in it vast amounts of time and energy. Lindenthal was born in 1850 in Brünn, a manufacturing city in the Austro-Hungarian province of Moravia that, renamed Brno, became a part of Czechoslovakia after World War I. What appears to be incontrovertible about his background is that he was the oldest son of a large family born to a cabinetmaker and his wife, and that Gustav received a formal education through about age fourteen. The details of his further education have recently been revealed to be even more uncertain than one might gather from a close reading of standard biographical works like The National Cyclopedia of American Biography, where he is said to have been “educated at the Provincial College in Brünn and the Polytechnic schools in Brünn and Vienna.” We may speculate that Lindenthal himself was the original source of such information, and, further, that his claim of having been “educated at” a school may have meant little more than having used the library and attended some public lectures there. However, it was natural to assume from the wording that the connection had been somewhat more formal.\n\nThe issue of Lindenthal’s education was raised to a higher consciousness, however, in a 1991 article in The New Yorker that dealt mainly with Lindenthal’s masterpiece, the Hell Gate Bridge, upon which he was working at the same time that he wrote so authoritatively on the Quebec Bridge competition and related professional matters in Engineering News. The writer of the New Yorker article, Tom Buckley, revealed that none of the schools contacted in Brünn or Vienna could find any record of a Gustav Lindenthal’s ever having been a student in the 1860s or early 1870s. According to a memoir of him published in the Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers five years after his death, Lindenthal was educated at the Polytechnicum College in Dresden, Germany, but that may have been merely an error based on his receiving an honorary degree from this institution in 1911. Long before then, his career had reached the point where the amount of formal education he had received mattered little in practical terms, for he had risen to the very top of his profession. But it may well have mattered to the man himself, or to his rivals.\n\nWhat does seem certain is that young Gustav “received practical training from 1866 to 1870,” for at the age of sixteen or so he “was put to work as a mason and carpenter,” and “also worked in a machine shop.” Perhaps he was forced to help support the family rather than enroll in school, but “the home soon became too confining for him,” according to a tribute published in his hometown on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, and he ran away to Vienna “to start a life of his own.” So young Lindenthal appears to have left home at about the age of twenty to make something of himself in Vienna, where he became an assistant in the engineering department of the Austrian Empress Elizabeth Railroad. Two years later, he joined the Union Construction Company, which was engaged in building an “incline plane and railroad,” and the next year, 1873, he joined the Swiss National Railroad as a division engineer in charge of location and construction. Without a formal engineering degree, however, Lindenthal would have seen his future limited in Europe, and he emigrated to America, where self-educated engineers like James B. Eads and apprenticed ones like Octave Chanute could still, in the young profession, rise to considerable heights.\n\nAmong Lindenthal’s first jobs in America was that of a journeyman stonemason, in which he found himself “working for several months on the foundation of the memorial granite building of the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia” for the 1876 World’s Fair. Lindenthal was to be remembered by his daughter as a man who “stood a little over six feet tall and was solidly built,” and who “wore a mustache and a beard from the time he was a young man.” His physical characteristics and his European experience, along with the self-determination of an immigrant wanting to make something of himself in the land of opportunity, no doubt helped him before too long become “an assistant engineer in the erection of the centennial exhibition permanent buildings in Philadelphia,” a position that he would hold for the next three years. The judgment haltingly expressed by Buckley in The New Yorker—that “it appeared that the most eminent bridge designer of his time had been, in a sense, an impostor”—seems too harsh, for in the 1870s it was still possible to establish oneself as a professional on the basis of performance rather than college degrees. Indeed, the judgment seems to have been too harsh even for Buckley, who had just sung the praises of the engineer’s Hell Gate Bridge, and who now seemed to want to soften the impact of the revelation:\n\nLindenthal was neither the first immigrant to these shores nor the last to invent or to embellish his accomplishments or his ancestry—some did it to erase a criminal past, to free themselves from unhappy marriages, or simply to create new, more agreeable, and, perhaps, truer versions of themselves. His ersatz degrees doubtless opened doors, but he would have been quickly booted back onto the street if he had not been able to do the work. What his deception concealed, in fact, was the extraordinary intelligence, energy, and self-discipline that enabled him to teach himself mathematics, engineering theory, metallurgy, hydraulics, estimating, management, and everything else a successful bridge designer had to know—not to mention, in his case, English.\n\nWhether Lindenthal ever proffered “ersatz degrees” may never be known, but it may indeed have been a “truer version” of himself that enabled him to become the engineer with the grandest dreams on the continent. These dreams were to be articulated in his adopted language in technical papers, prospectuses, tracts, letters, and a steady stream of words which belie the conventional wisdom that engineering and writing are alien endeavors. Indeed, Lindenthal, like virtually all great engineers before and after him, was a master of the pen and pencil as well as of bridge design, which should not be surprising. The dream of a bridge, which typically takes its first tangible shape in the form of a pencil sketch, would win no financial or political support were its engineer not able to flesh it out in words that convey not only the technical excitement of the project but also its benefit to the community of investors, merchants, politicians, and people generally.\n\nAfter the Centennial Exhibition closed, Lindenthal began working for the Keystone Bridge Company on projects in Chicago and Pittsburgh. This experience, in turn, enabled him to become, in 1879, bridge engineer in Cleveland with the Atlantic & Great Western Railroad. Like many a young engineer of his time, Lindenthal thus followed a peripatetic career among the expanding railroads and bridge-building companies. However, shortly after he turned thirty, he decided to strike out on his own and returned to Pittsburgh to set himself up in private practice. There was plenty of work for a confident and competent engineer; many of the railroads needed help in carrying out surveys, designing and constructing new bridges, and replacing their old wooden-truss bridges with wrought-iron ones more capable of supporting the increasingly heavy locomotives that had come into use. Through such work Lindenthal came into contact with many of the most prominent engineers of the time.\n\n1\n\nAmong the long-standing bridge needs in Pittsburgh was a crossing of the Monongahela River to reach the city’s South Side. In the early nineteenth century, that need was provided by ferry service, but in 1810 a bridge charter was obtained, and by 1816 a fine covered wooden bridge was in place. This bridge was the work of Lewis Wernwag, whose earlier Colossus Bridge across the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia has been called “an American engineering superlative.” Although the Colossus had a single clear span of more than 340 feet, which certainly contributed to its being referred to as “the most stunning and visually compelling engineering structure built in the early United States,” the Monongahela bridge had eight much more modest spans of 188 feet each. Fire, however, the fate of many a covered bridge, destroyed the Colossus in 1838, and the wooden superstructure of the Pittsburgh bridge in 1845.\n\nJohn Roebling thus was given the opportunity to build his first wire-suspension bridge to carry a road as opposed to a canal, and he was able to complete the structure especially quickly by employing the original masonry piers, which had not been harmed in the fire. Though Roebling’s bridge was a great success at first, “in the course of time it became very shaky and loose, and its continuous swaying and creaking convinced every one that it was becoming unsafe for travel.” In fact, the Pittsburgh suspension bridge was so flexible that at times of high water riverboat captains could arrange to have the headroom under one of its eight spans increased by a foot or two by hiring teamsters to position heavy wagons on the spans on either side of the one under which they wished to sail. As roadway traffic grew increasingly heavy, however, the large deflections and vibrations of the bridge became unacceptable, and in 1880 a new suspension bridge with larger spans was commissioned. After the new piers were under construction, the bridge company reconsidered its plans, and looked to something other than a suspension bridge, which “would not be subject to undulations and would be capable of enduring the constantly increasing traffic without limitation of load or speed.” Lindenthal himself may have pointed out the limitations of the suspension-bridge design, and he was invited by the directors and managers of the company to prepare alternative plans. He was subsequently awarded the commission for a new type of bridge of European design.\n\nThe Colossus of 1812, a wooden bridge of uncommon span (photo credit 4.1)\n\nThe Smithfield Street Bridge in Pittsburgh was Lindenthal’s first important design project. Its principal structural form is now technically known as a lenticular truss, because it is lens-shaped, but was then called a Pauli truss, after its German inventor, Friedrich August von Pauli. The structural principle under which it functions is not unlike that of Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s Saltash Bridge, built across the Tamar River in southwestern England in the 1850s, in which a top tubular member and a suspended chain act in opposing ways to produce a self-equilibrating truss, a variation on the bowstring girder that Eads described. Lindenthal’s adaptation of the Pauli design was of a much lighter construction, however, because of the use of steel in some of its parts, and it showed “the triumph of architectural skill over the gross bulkiness that in the past was considered inseparable from an adequate amount of strength.” In fact, Lindenthal’s “use of steel instead of iron wherever possible was based upon economy as much as anything,” and the decision saved about 5 percent of the bridge’s total cost of $458,000. As originally completed in 1883, the Smithfield Street Bridge carried a single roadway on two main spans of 360 feet each through towering portals with iron-fringed roofs. In 1891, as Lindenthal had made provision for in his original design, a second roadway was added on the already wide piers and a third set of lenticular trusses was erected, thus providing separate roadways for trolley and horse traffic. The original Victorian-style portal motif was retained after widening, though it was changed in 1915 to the less ornate dual-portal cast-steel design that exists on the bridge today, and the Smithfield Street Bridge remains one of Pittsburgh’s most significant landmarks.\n\nThe original portal design of Pittsburgh’s Smithfield Street Bridge (photo credit 4.2)\n\nThe widened Smithfield Street Bridge, with a less ornate portal (photo credit 4.3)\n\nAn etching of the original portal design of the “new bridge at Pittsburg” dominated the front page of Scientific American for September 22, 1883, with a profile of the bridge relegated to a rather small inset engraving. Approaching a bridge like this one from Smithfield Street, or approaching Pittsburgh’s Point Bridge, whose functional towers provided even more imposing portals to the main span, must have been an experience not unlike the one Victorian travelers encountered upon entering the crystal palaces that housed the world’s fairs of the 1850s and 1860s. In fact, Lindenthal had been inspired—if not constrained, as all engineers are—by the style and technology of his own time, which in this case included the buildings for the Centennial fair in Philadelphia.\n\nAmong the curious features of the Scientific American story of the new bridge was the opening note that the cover engraving was made “from an excellent photograph by S. V. Albee, for a copy of which we are indebted to Mr. Alex. Y. Lee, C.E., of Pittsburg.” That the engineer Lee’s name was prefixed and suffixed in ways that Albee’s was not suggests the status of the engineer, if not the profession itself, at the time, at least in Scientific American. All the more notable, therefore, is the fact that the “chief engineer, Mr. Gustavus Lindenthal,” who was identified as the source of the particulars about the bridge, had no initials following his name. Evidently, at this early and important stage in his career, not only had Lindenthal not Americanized his given name but, more significantly, he seems not to have conveyed to the reporter that he held any such degree as C.E. Indeed, if anything, Lindenthal seems to have kept the reporter from making such an assumption—as well he might have. Lindenthal’s engineering achievements were and would be his credentials.\n\nIn addition to his bridge over the Monongahela, Lindenthal also built one over the Allegheny River, at Seventh Street in Pittsburgh. This was a suspension bridge with four cables that employed not wire but chains composed of eyebars to hold up the roadway. The eyebar chains were suspended in pairs one above another from either side of the towers, and they were interconnected with bracing. Lindenthal may have been influenced in the design by the Point Bridge, completed in Pittsburgh in 1877, which also employed trussed chains to support its roadway. This scheme gave a considerable degree of stiffness to the chain structure, so that the relatively flexible roadway suspended from it was not subject to the degree of deflection and vibration that had been found unsatisfactory in wire suspension bridges. This preference for the use of eyebars rather than wire cables for suspension bridges was to be central in some of the debates Lindenthal would have with other engineers when he became involved in the design of bridges for New York City. Although Lindenthal’s Seventh Street Bridge was to be replaced about a decade before the death of its engineer, it was, along with the Smithfield Street Bridge, one of the major structures erected in the 1880s in America.\n\nWhereas the Brooklyn Bridge, which was completed in 1883, dwarfed Lindenthal’s Pittsburgh bridges and thus captured the imagination of the wider public, his engineering reputation was firmly established, albeit principally in one locality. He had received the Rowland Prize from the American Society of Civil Engineers for his paper on the Monongahela bridge, which he read before the society in 1883, and he was well established as an engineer not only of bridges but also of unique forms of transportation like the inclined railroads used for moving wagons and streetcars along the steep slopes in and around Pittsburgh. Lindenthal, however, appears to have wanted to be more than an important engineer in Pittsburgh or among his colleagues in the American Society of Civil Engineers. One way of gaining wider recognition would be to design and build a bridge larger than the Brooklyn Bridge, then the largest anywhere in the world. If Pittsburgh did not need such large bridges, New York did, and spanning the Hudson River was a problem whose solution everyone would appreciate for its grand achievement. This would place its engineer in the category of a Roebling, if not higher.\n\n2\n\nAccording to his own account, almost fifty years after the incident, Lindenthal was approached in the fall of 1885 by Samuel Rae, assistant to the vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, regarding the “practicability of a railroad bridge across the Hudson River.” Being a “very able engineer with a penetrating and cautious mind,” Rae also consulted other engineers over the situation at New York:\n\nThere was keen competition among the railroad companies for Western traffic. The New York Central Railroad Company advertised a direct entrance, with four tracks, to the heart of Manhattan, while the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the other railroads terminating in New Jersey were handicapped and had to transfer their passengers across the Hudson River by ferries. A tunnel under the Hudson River had been started at Hoboken, N.J., but it was intended only for small [railroad] cars and local traffic. A larger tunnel for locomotives and standard cars appeared objectionable because of the smoke, which was then a subject of daily complaint in the tunnels of the New York Central Railroad.\n\nAs Rae also noted, the situation favored an immense bridge with open-air railroad tracks. In the wake of the Tay Bridge failure, however, the Firth of Forth cantilever design of Fowler and Baker had succeeded the suspension-bridge design of the discredited Bouch, and so a cantilever had also been talked about for the Hudson River, which was about three thousand feet wide and very deep at New York. However, there were serious questions whether a pier would be allowed in the river, and whether the depth of the foundations might be practical. Having “given thought to the matter before,” Lindenthal turned to a suspension-bridge design for New York, and he was convinced that it was technically possible. He reported as much to the Pennsylvania Railroad in the spring of 1886, but Lindenthal’s integrated approach, which included a terminal plan, was prohibitively expensive for a single railroad to finance. Thus the North River Bridge Company, with Lindenthal as chief engineer, was organized in 1887 to seek financial support from several railroads, which would share the bridge and terminal facilities. This seemed like a very promising enterprise, for the otherwise uninterrupted transcontinental tracks then terminated in New Jersey, just across the river from New York, which was the ultimate destination of an enormous volume of passengers and freight. The closest bridge across the Hudson River was at Albany, over 150 miles north. Construction of the cantilever bridge at Poughkeepsie, about sixty miles upriver, had just begun, and ferry service between New Jersey and New York was slow, expensive, and subject to interruption by the weather. Furthermore, there was “annoyance and even danger to the landed passengers on the overcrowded and nasty streets” of New York City, which also housed the offices of Engineering News, the trade journal that was then poised to grow and expand its influence under the vision and energy of its new editor, A. M. Wellington.\n\nArthur Mellen Wellington, born in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1847, was the son of a physician. He attended the Boston Latin School, and he learned engineering not through formal education but as an assistant in the Boston office of John B. Henck, himself a self-made engineer. Henck, born in Philadelphia in 1815, was self-educated until he entered Harvard, from which he was to graduate first in his class in 1840. He remained in Cambridge to serve as principal of Hopkins Classical School for a year before moving to the University of Maryland, where he spent a year as a professor of Latin and Greek. After five more years in a similar position at the Germantown Academy, and with a growing family, he returned to Boston to enter the employ of Felton & Parker, Civil Engineers. After a couple of years there, he left to join in a partnership with the engineer William S. Whitwell. Henck eventually set up his own consulting offices in Boston to do general engineering work, which included work on street railways, the Charles River Basin, and the development of Boston’s Back Bay district. In 1865, he became head of the Civil Engineering Department of the newly established Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a position he held until 1881.\n\nThough Wellington was introduced to engineering in Henck’s firm in Boston, the young man did not wish to remain in that city. He took and passed an examination for assistant engineer in the U.S. Navy, but the war ended before he could assume such a position. Wellington then went to Brooklyn, New York, where he joined the Park Department under Frederick Law Olmsted, who with Calvert Vaux had laid out Prospect Park. Wellington apparently had wanderlust, however, and he began to work for a succession of railroads, beginning as a transitman on the Blue Ridge Railroad in South Carolina and working himself up from assistant engineer, principal assistant engineer, and locating engineer to engineer in charge. However, when railroad construction was suddenly stopped during the panic years of 1873 and 1874, Wellington found opportunities for engineers scarce. On his application for membership in the American Society of Civil Engineers, he wrote: “1874–78, was engaged in miscellaneous professional, business and literary occupation more interesting than lucrative and not always particularly interesting.” According to one who knew him, however, he was later to refer to this “period of enforced idleness—so far as idleness was possible to a man of his restless energy—as a blessing in disguise.”\n\nOne of the outlets for Wellington’s energy was explicating his experience with railroad construction in books. His first dealt with the very important task of computing how much earth needed to be moved to construct a railroad, a key factor in its cost. The same year this book was published, 1875, Wellington began his “great work, and that by which his fame as an engineer would be established, The Economic Theory of the Location of Railroads.” It was in this work, first published in 1876 as a series of articles in the Railroad Gazette and in 1877 as a book, that Wellington’s famous definition of engineering appeared:\n\nIt would be well if engineering were less generally thought of, and even defined, as the art of constructing. In a certain important sense it is rather the art of not constructing: or, to define it rudely, but not inaptly, it is the art of doing well with one dollar, which any bungler can do with two after a fashion.\n\nWellington’s success as a writer brought him opportunities, and in 1878 he became principal assistant to Charles Latimer, chief engineer of the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio Railroad. After three years at the “Nypano,” as Latimer’s company was known, Wellington went to Mexico to become first engineer in charge of location and surveys for that country’s national railroad, and later assistant general manager and chief engineer in charge of location. He again grew restless, however, and in 1884 he returned to the United States to become one of the editors of the Railroad Gazette, a position for which his practical experience was invaluable. In January 1887, he left the Gazette to join Engineering News as one of the editors-in-chief and as part owner. According to another of the editors, “the influence of his energy and ability was at once seen in every department of this journal. Within two years its subscription list had more than doubled.”\n\nThe juxtaposition of Wellington’s name and the word “energy” was ubiquitous, and he seemed always to be looking for new challenges. In the summer of 1892, instead of taking his usual vacation, he stayed in New York and “devoted his leisure to working out some ideas in thermodynamics which had occurred to him years before,” which led to the invention of an efficient engine whose development “became the all-absorbing work of his life, and in his earnestness and zeal all thought of care for his health was forgotten.” As he spent more and more time on his invention, he worked less and less on writing and editing, finally giving up work at Engineering News entirely in May 1894. He soon thereafter embarked on the European rest trip his physicians had advised earlier, but he became acutely ill while in Norway. Though he recovered sufficiently to return to America, his health again failed, and he died in April 1895, from overwork, according to those who knew him most closely.\n\nGustav Lindenthal could not have helped interacting with Wellington during the course of his editorship at Engineering News, for that journal was to follow closely the great bridge project of which Lindenthal dreamed. Among the first public mentions of a new plan for a New York City bridge over the Hudson River, which was then also known as the North River (as opposed to the South or Delaware River), appears to have been a letter that ran in mid-1887 in a newspaper in Philadelphia, the hometown of the Pennsylvania Railroad. According to Engineering News, and most probably according to editor Wellington, it was “from a man whom [sic] we happen to know is eminently qualified to discuss the subject on the great question of how to eliminate the Hudson river from the New York terminus problem.” Though the letter-writer was not identified, it was almost certainly Lindenthal, whose name in 1887 was quite unlikely to be meaningful to New Yorkers generally, but who may very well have himself fed the letter to Wellington. The subject of the letter was itself of immense interest, however, and it was quoted at length. As in most preliminary reports of engineers setting out a complicated problem and a proposed solution, both were stated concisely:\n\nAre the proposed tunnels under the river the proper remedies for the present inconveniences? The projected tunnel is estimated to cost $11,000,000 for two tracks. But two tracks would not begin to accommodate the passenger business of a single railroad, much less all that now terminate on the Jersey side. The Pennsylvania Railroad alone would require four tracks for its steadily increasing business. There should be not less than six tracks, requiring six tunnels.… Six mud tunnels for necessarily slow trains with noisy, cramped terminals, from which dampness could not be excluded for $33,000,000, with no assurance that this amount would be sufficient, and with the certainty of great expenditures for maintenance and repairs, for tunnels must be pumped dry, ventilated, and perhaps thoroughly lighted. This is certainly not the kind of improvement that New York City is most in need [of], and it is not the kind of terminal railroad station which could meet the ever growing demands for greater convenience, safety, comfort and expeditious travelling.\n\nProgress by 1882 on a Hudson River tunnel begun in 1874 (photo credit 4.4)\n\nImagine now, in a central part of New York City, within a stone’s throw of its greatest avenue, a grand, imposing station, combined with every convenience and comfort of a first-class hotel, with numerous tracks and platforms, accommodating thirty trains at one time, arriving and departing, having all the elevated railroads running their trains directly into this station. Then imagine a massive stone viaduct and lofty columns supporting a six-track roadbed, through and over blocks of buildings to a magnificent bridge over the North river, leaping with a single span over its entire width, without a pier or other obstruction and with a clearance above highest tide of 140 ft., carrying six tracks. Then imagine the six tracks continued on a viaduct and gently descending to the level of the country in New Jersey to connections with all existing railroads and for future lines that will be built. No doubt such imagination may seem fantastic and profitless, though everybody will grant, were it possible to realize such a project, it would be a grand and eminently useful undertaking. But such a project can be realized. It is perfectly feasible and practicable to execute it at less cost than the proposed tunnels with corresponding terminals. The matter has been studied with the greatest possible care for a number of years, and all conditions have been weighed impartially and soberly. There cannot possibly be objections to a bridge spanning North river without a pier in the river and at such a height as to allow the largest steamers to pass under it freely. Bridge engineering has progressed so much that such a large bridge can be built with greater facility to-day than it was possible for the Brooklyn Bridge when it was proposed.\n\nLater that year, Lindenthal prepared a four-page report on this solution of his to the problem, which he copyrighted in 1887 under his own name and had privately printed “not as a publication, but simply for convenience of the promoters of the project and for their exclusive use.” His booklet was entitled The Proposed New York City Terminal Railroad, Including North River Bridge and Grand Terminal Station, in New York City, and the bridge was only one part of the integrated scheme. Six train tracks would be constructed on viaducts “high above the houses” of New York City between a huge bilevel Terminal Station, located “as close as convenient to the principal hotels,” which then meant somewhere above Eighteenth Street and near Sixth Avenue, and the “great North River Bridge,” also referred to as the Hudson River Bridge. Since at the time the Hudson could be considered the “most important water highway in the United States,” any obstruction of it by bridge piers was out of the question. Thus Lindenthal proposed bridging the river “between established pier lines with a single span, 2,850 feet long and 145 feet above high tide.”\n\nLindenthal’s proposed North River Bridge compared with the Brooklyn, Forth, Poughkeepsie, and Eads bridges, drawn to scale (photo credit 4.5)\n\nAs with all responsible engineering proposals, Lindenthal’s report included an estimate of cost and a projection of revenue based on use. Since “surveys, plans and estimates for the entire project” had been made, and since, “except for its magnitude,” the work was “as definite and free from experimental features as any other railroad or bridge project,” Lindenthal must have been confident in his estimate of $23 million for the terminal station, viaducts, bridge, four miles of railroad, and a tunnel through Bergen Hill in New Jersey. When the cost of acquisition of the right of way was added, the total cost of the project was estimated to be $37 million. He projected that eight railroads, including the Pennsylvania, could run their trains directly to the Grand Terminal Station, collectively carrying about sixty thousand passengers per day plus freight. At ten cents each, those passengers alone would bring revenue of over $2 million annually. Because the expenses of operating the system were expected to be covered by the railroads using it, the overall plan looked like a sound moneymaking proposition. Lindenthal dated his report “New York, October, 1887,” and identified himself not with letters such as C.E., denoting a college degree, but with the descriptive declaration “Gustav Lindenthal, Civil Engineer, of Pittsburgh, Pa.,” which he certainly had established himself to be.\n\nWhereas the North River Bridge was only one part of his Grand Terminal plan, it was the component that was to capture the attention of engineers, financiers, and laypersons alike, and to remain Lindenthal’s unrelenting dream for almost five decades. The first formal professional presentation of his bridge plans appears to have occurred at a New York meeting of the American Society of Civil Engineers on the evening of January 4, 1888, which was described in a report in The New York Times the following morning. That the speaker was identified as “Prof. Lindenthal” confirms that he was not then widely known in New York, but the reporter may possibly have used the academic title in the belief that no other was appropriate for the author of “an exhaustive paper on ‘The North River Bridge Problem’ ” whose reading “consumed over three and a half hours,” even though the speaker “confined himself to the salient points of the general project.” Nevertheless, Lindenthal, who may have done little to discourage the professorial image, apparently could not pass up an opportunity to criticize New York’s Brooklyn Bridge, pointing out “enough defects in the East River Bridge to test the faith of any understanding mortal compelled to cross that iron thoroughfare in the course of his business.” There seems little doubt that Lindenthal wanted to better the great achievement of Roebling and to build the greatest bridge in the world. Though he estimated then that it would cost no more than $15 million, he admitted in a report only three months later that the total railroad project might reach $50 million.\n\nIn his talk, Lindenthal also argued against a tunnel, which many engineers favored because of the great width of the river. Indeed, a tunnel was the greatest immediate threat to the realization of his dream, and he had concluded his report by citing the clear advantages of a bridge over a tunnel: “Utility, the greatest convenience, plenty of light and air, absence of smoke and noise shall be the leading features.” Even though there had been some success with driving tunnels under water—Marc Brunel’s tunnel under the Thames River in London having been completed over four decades earlier—there remained a general aversion to going underground and under a river in the dark for a mile or so, and bridges were the communication link of choice—if their costs could be afforded. However, a tunnel beneath the Hudson was already under construction, and the competition between tunnels and bridges would remain real and ever-present.\n\nIn the meantime, there was growing public interest in an interstate bridge. In late 1887, citizens of New Jersey had asked Congress to authorize and direct the president to appoint a commission of army engineers to look into the matter. This appeared to be the first “public move in a very ambitious project,” according to Engineering News, which was sanguine in spite of the project’s involving an “amount of money, for construction and real estate, that would have made a previous generation stand aghast at its mere mention.” The journal that expressed on its masthead an interest in “all new engineering works or designs, large or small, of interest from their magnitude, novelty, or originality,” believed in Lindenthal’s dream, however, for the country then had “engineers capable of surmounting all the physical difficulties of the problem, and a people rich enough to pay for it, just as soon as the necessity is really felt for such a structure—and that time approaches.” The necessity was already felt by the likes of Lindenthal, of course, but the time when enough others would feel it was to approach and recede for decades.\n\nTo complicate things further, rumor had it that some railroad men were becoming interested in developing plans for a bridge across the Hudson between Steven’s Point, in Hoboken, New Jersey, and somewhere near 42nd Street, on Manhattan Island. Their scheme differed from Lindenthal’s in several respects. For one, it was to carry “wagon-ways, foot-ways, and a cable road system,” in addition to a good number of railroad tracks. For another, it was to be a cantilever bridge, with a maximum span of 780 feet and a headway of 165 feet above the water. The rumor had it that “no engineer has yet made plans, otherwise than to say it was feasible,” which was certainly believable, since the cantilever bridge with multiple 548-foot spans was then under construction over the Hudson at Poughkeepsie and the 1,710-foot spans of the Firth of Forth bridge were nearing completion in Scotland.\n\nAnother group of investors was seeking approval for a bridge between Fort Lee, New Jersey, and the section on the New York side of the river known by its Dutch name, Spuyten Duyvil. They wished to place one or more piers in this relatively narrow part of the lower Hudson River, but steamboat operators were already complaining about the piers at Poughkeepsie, where the tides were not nearly so tricky as they were in the river around Spuyten Duyvil, past which tows of sixty to a hundred barges stretched out “anywhere from 200 or 300 feet to nearly a mile” (though the latter estimate was very possibly a zealot’s hyperbole). Thus the stage was set for battles on several fronts, not only between the advocates of tunnels and those of bridges but also between proponents of cantilever and suspension designs, and, as always, between builders of bridges and operators of tugs and ferryboats, with all manner of variation in detail. These battles, not unfairly likened in emotion and intensity to those between the sheep- and cattle-herders of the Old West, would also rage in various forms and at various strategic locations for the next few decades.\n\nTrue to its promise to give early publication to plans for new engineering works, Engineering News soon ran serially the details of Lindenthal’s design, introducing them as the first item on the first page of the first issue of 1888 with assurances that the cost was “certainly not so formidable an obstacle for to-day as was that of the Brooklyn bridge for 1868,” and that “there is probably no one on either side of the ocean who could be counted on more confidently to deal successfully with the intricate engineering problems involved than Mr. Lindenthal.” His reputation—at least to editors of, and hence to readers of, Engineering News—seems to have been well served by his technical tracts and lectures of earlier years.\n\nA profile diagram, with horizontal scale compressed five times more than that of the vertical, showed the bridge in context, complete with the proposed tunnel through New Jersey’s Bergen Hill and the terminal with two track levels in New York City. An undistorted drawing of the bridge itself appeared above uniform scale drawings of the Brooklyn, Firth of Forth, Poughkeepsie, and Eads bridges. Unlike the chains used for his Seventh Street Bridge in Pittsburgh, Lindenthal proposed braced steel-wire cables enclosed in steel envelopes to “protect them absolutely against rain and weather.” The stiffening trusses of the roadway proper were “principally designed to form the frame work for two large horizontal wind trusses [to] make the bridge safe against the most violent tornadoes,” and the bridge was so designed that four additional railroad tracks could be added “at any time in the future, should it become necessary, making a double deck bridge.” Actually, the first bridge to connect New York and New Jersey was still over forty years away, but it would share a remarkable number of features with Lindenthal’s late-Victorian dream.\n\nLindenthal’s plans, as published in Engineering News, showed him to have given considerable thought and effort to the great bridge. In addition to describing the technical details, his report kept returning to the architecture of the bridge, especially to the form of the towers, they being “the most prominent feature” of the structure. He acknowledged that the largest suspension bridges then built all had stone towers, but he cited the recent replacement of the cracked stone towers of the Niagara Gorge Suspension Bridge with metal ones, and explained that, “for bridge towers 500 ft. high, wrought iron or low steel is without question the most suitable material.” The towers of his bridge would have columns shaped “for the double purpose of good appearance and to produce initial strains in the bracing between them, by which the rigidity of the towers is enhanced.” The bracing itself was so arranged also to form “a grand and lofty portal” through which the train tracks would pass.\n\nLindenthal’s New York City Terminal Railroad scheme, drawn with an exaggerated vertical scale and showing the proposed bridge and tunnel through Bergen Hill in New Jersey (photo credit 4.6)\n\nEngineering News was understandably proud to publish a “very liberal extract” from Lindenthal’s paper, which it described as “the first definite description of a work which has at least a very fair chance of becoming the greatest of its kind on this continent, or in the world.” This proponent of great schemes assured its readers that the fact that “some such structure will be built over the North River is as certain as any event still in the future can be,” adding that its prospects were especially good because “it certainly has that solid basis which was so sadly lacking in the Panama canal scheme” that recently had been effectively abandoned by the French. Engineering News concluded its introduction to one of several extracts with optimism, for, “fortunately, engineering difficulties do not by any means vary in direct ratio with magnitude, as the cost does, and there seems to be little in the proposed design which previous experience does not indicate to be entirely practicable.” Unfortunately, editor Wellington and engineer Lindenthal both seem to have underestimated the importance of nontechnical factors, which perhaps vary to an even greater extent with magnitude than does cost. The political and mercantile complications and competitions that accompanied such technically solid great projects as the Eads and Brooklyn bridges were evidently forgotten, at least by some, in the late 1880s in New York.\n\nLindenthal himself also seems to have worried less about general opposition to the plan than he did about attacks on the aesthetic integrity of his design. Considering the “architectural excellence of the bridge” to be of the “highest importance,” he ridiculed the “hackneyed phrase” that “correctly designed structures have an innate architectural beauty, requiring no adornment, unless perhaps that of a well selected color of paint.” Lindenthal pointed to various bridges (some recently completed) that he saw as embodying the best of engineering and architecture in a single structure:\n\nThe graceful suspension in Buda Pesth (without question the finest existing specimen of this class of bridge-architecture), the early bridges in Paris, and a few over the River Rhine were built by engineer-architects, when the field of engineering did not yet justify exclusive devotion to one specialty, to the neglect of other branches of the science of building. But for the taste and stubborn persistence of the late Capt. Eads, the St. Louis bridge would have been built so as to be not the finest specimen of a metal arch-bridge architecture in this country, which it is, but on the plans of the old Omaha bridge, now worn out, and soon fit only for the scrap heap.…\n\nThe standpoint of utility has, in our time, become with many almost the only professional point of view for judging of the merit of engineering work, so that the incentive for better things is wanting. A good deal of the blame is with the engineering schools. There is not one text book, to the author’s knowledge, in the English language, on “Bridge Architecture,” and no attempt is made to teach the students even the rudiments of good designing. It is thought to be of more consequence to furnish an elegant graphical solution of the strains in a polygonal truss, or in the invention of a new formula for the very least weight of iron in a bridge, than to design with a decent regard for pleasing appearance, and for the feeling of fellow men and the opinion of posterity.\n\nAn early version of Lindenthal’s Hudson River Bridge design, with the Brooklyn Bridge in the background (photo credit 4.7)\n\nHis apparent contempt for engineering schools may perhaps have stemmed partly from his own disappointment or private embarrassment at not having been more formally educated, and partly from the realization, based on his own achievements, that formal education was not a sine qua non for creating good bridge engineering and architecture. That Lindenthal had established himself so well by building significant bridges in Pittsburgh appears to have given him a self-confident, if not arrogant, belief that he was the pre-eminent American bridge engineer, and so entitled to serve as an arbiter of taste for another city’s bridges. He went on to relate anecdotes of being told by a railroad manager how, “every time he hears of a new project for a larger bridge,” he feared another “common hideous looking structure” would go up. When another gentleman spoke to him of “recklessly vulgar structures,” Lindenthal defended engineers by arguing that they “cannot always do as they please and public sentiment must be educated” in appreciating “better things.” He left little doubt that he was referring in particular to a “shameful conglomeration of iron structures as are found in New York and Brooklyn,” which deserved better:\n\nIt is certainly true that if the New York Harbor, acknowledged to be the most beautiful in this country, should be defaced by a utility bridge of shabby appearance, it would be an unpardonable offense against the civilization of mankind. A pleasing architectural appearance of the bridge [proposed] was therefore held to be worthy of as much study as the engineering features, and the design aims to combine them in the best manner attainable out of a variety of designs made for the purpose.\n\nLindenthal expected his digression to be “pardoned in view of the importance of the project.” Years later, his apparent inability to compromise on any front, functional or aesthetic, was blamed for the great dreamer’s ineffectualness in getting the North River Bridge plans approved. But whereas Lindenthal was talking aesthetics, others were talking politics and economics, each of which was a sine qua non of great bridge building. And perhaps the biggest obstacle of all was the almost strictly technical decision as to whether a suspension bridge of the record span he proposed was indeed practicable. As the great bridge over the Firth of Forth neared completion, the cantilever type was day by day gaining support. In the end, it was Lindenthal himself who publicly raised the issue of a suspension versus a cantilever bridge.\n\nProposed cantilever bridge over the Hudson River (photo credit 4.8)\n\n3\n\nThe full title of the long paper Lindenthal read before the American Society of Civil Engineers was “The North River Bridge Problem, with a Discussion on Long Span Bridges.” Many pages of Engineering News in the months of January and February 1888 were given over to Lindenthal’s solution of the bridge problem, but many more for the month of March were devoted to his discussion. His definition of a “long span bridge” was one whose structural metal (concrete bridges were not even under consideration) was at least as heavy as the traffic it was designed to carry. There were four types of bridges most suitable for long spans, he asserted: the suspension bridge, which, after Eads, he termed a suspended arch; the erect arch, which was the familiar kind; the continuous girder, of which the Britannia tubular bridge was an example; and the cantilever.\n\nFirst discussing the cantilever, Lindenthal pointed out that the type generally lacked rigidity under fast railroad trains, unless it was built with great height and depth, as over the Firth of Forth, at the sacrifice of headroom near the piers, which he thought unacceptable in the Hudson River. In addition to some more technical objections that he raised, he finally condemned cantilever bridges then built for “their general ugliness of appearance.” Such aesthetic concerns, according to Lindenthal, “may not be of much consequence for a railroad bridge off in the woods, but even then it would not be more expensive to build them with an eye to better appearance, if for no other reason than to set a good example in imitative engineers.” Among the things he found objectionable in contemporary cantilever bridges were the “indiscriminate use of eyebars and bulky compression sections in the same chord lines and the irregularity of truss frames,” which he thought to be “as needless as it is ugly looking.” He concluded his diatribe against cantilevers by alluding to two recently built ones in certain unnamed large cities. One of these bridges was the one in Philadelphia over Market Street, whose design was defended in a letter to the editor in a subsequent issue of Engineering News. The writer admitted that “cantilever fever” was prevalent at the time, but that Lindenthal was in fact “entirely ignorant of the special conditions of the case” which led to the bridge that he so criticized. Later in his own career, in fact, Lindenthal would argue precisely that some special conditions caused him to design an unusual bridge in an unusual location, but that continuous girder span was still then far in the future.\n\nLindenthal’s discussion of arch bridges was quoted at considerable length from the 1868 report of Eads, including many of his illustrations, and his arguments were presented by Lindenthal as being as true in 1888 “as they were then, and as they always will be.” The discussion of suspended arches, or suspension bridges, was the longest. Whereas Eads had, of course, found the erect arch superior to the suspended, Lindenthal concluded just the opposite—namely, that the suspension bridge presented “the most favorable conditions of stability and rigidity.” Such a diametrically opposed conclusion from one engineer who had just agreed so much with the other with regard to the erect arch is not so much a contradiction as a demonstration of the complexity of the issue. In fact, there are in bridge design, as in all engineering problems, so many competing objectives and contrary constraints that in the final analysis the decision can be purely a question of personal preference and aesthetic taste, taking into account any special conditions at the bridge location. One engineer, because of his prejudices, might choose to design an arch rather than a suspension bridge for a particular site, whereas another might do just the opposite. Both bridge designs might be equally safe and reliable, but they might not have the same functional, aesthetic, and economic qualities.\n\nIn Lindenthal’s case, he was so committed to the suspension concept for bridging the Hudson River that he turned the argument naturally and not unfairly to his use. Lindenthal admitted, for example, that it was “a popular assumption that suspension bridges cannot be well used for railroad purposes,” and further conceded that throughout the world there was only one suspension bridge then carrying railroad tracks, Roebling’s Niagara Gorge Bridge, completed in 1854, over which trains had to move slowly. However, rather than seeing this as scant evidence for his case, Lindenthal held up as a model the “greater moral courage and more abiding faith in the truth of constructive principles” that Roebling needed to build his bridge in the face of contemporary criticism by the “most eminent bridge engineers then living.” In Lindenthal’s time, three decades later, it was not merely a question of moral courage; “nowadays bridges are not built on faith,” and there was “not another field of applied mechanics where results can be predicted with so much precision as in bridges of iron and steel.” He did not promise such precision in the cost of his suspension bridge, however, and concluded his discussion by revealing an estimated cost of “approximately $15,000,000,” which still might have seemed more dreamlike than the bridge itself.\n\nIn the meantime, the legislatures of New York and New Jersey had become involved again. In 1868, the New-York and New-Jersey Bridge Company had been chartered under the laws of New Jersey, which allowed one or two piers in the river as long as there was a thousand-foot clearance between them and a clear height of 130 feet in the center. With the renewed interest in a bridge, there was also renewed interest in getting the New York Legislature to pass a law so that cooperative progress could be made. There was, however, opposition on the New York side among supporters of a bridge farther up the Hudson River, nearer Albany. Early in 1888, a bill was introduced into the New York Legislature, but Engineering News, which by then had become an outspoken proponent of Lindenthal’s plan, if not a downright mouthpiece of his, criticized the proposed legislation:\n\nIt plainly contemplates the erection of a cantilever, and stipulates for the placing of one pier in the river channel, neither of which should be permitted unless found absolutely necessary, even if the cost be considerably increased. If there be one place in the world where a mere “utility structure” should not be permitted, but where dignity and beauty of form should be a controlling feature, it is over the North River at New York, and in that and other respects the suspension type seems to us to have great advantages for the location.\n\nBy midyear, federal legislation was also being proposed that would authorize a bridge company to build, within ten years of the approval of plans by the secretary of war, what was effectively a suspension bridge, for no piers were to be in the river. Among the promoters of the scheme were Lindenthal and Henry Flad, whose reputation, based on the Eads Bridge, was impeccable. As the wheels of Congress turned, there was considerable public discussion of the matter. With at least two bridge proposals competing for government approval, an editorial in The New York Times was optimistic that “we shall have a bridge across the Hudson into this city ere the century closes.” Though the editorial did not mention Lindenthal by name, he was clearly being paid attention to: “An engineer of Pittsburgh, who makes bridges a specialty, has succeeded in gaining the ear of capitalists, and his calculations meet with respectful consideration from those who ought to know.” The Times seemed to be alluding to the editors of Engineering News, but the newspaper itself had some reservations about his design: “The picture of this greatest of all wonders of bridge making offers much the same beauty of curve in the main span as the East River Bridge and more grace of outline in the towers, though the openwork steel construction of the latter compare unfavorably with the granite piers at Brooklyn.” In fact, the open steel towers recalled unfavorably—to the editorial writer, at least—the Eiffel Tower, then under construction in Paris.\n\nAs The American Architect and Building News emphasized, the problem was not so much the length of Lindenthal’s proposed bridge, for the “much-talked-of bridge over the English Channel would be 20 miles long.” Furthermore, the longest bridge in the world was New York’s elevated railroad, which consisted of a thirty-three mile-long “continuous bridge.” What distinguished Lindenthal’s proposal was the length of its main span, almost three thousand feet between two gigantic towers. Some readers of other publications were not so understanding. In the year following the public explication of the plans, London’s The Engineer carried a critical appraisal by Max Am Emde. Lindenthal responded in a lengthy article in Engineering News, showing the more blunt and acerbic side of his personality, which included a tendency toward ad-hominem argument and sarcasm. Regarding the availability of information about the strength of steel wire for bridge cables, Lindenthal was critical of Am Emde’s lack of knowledge: “Ignorance of it is inexcusable in an engineer, and unpardonable in a critic.” And regarding the weight and number of trains that would be present at any given time, Lindenthal pointed out that “the bridge is not intended for use as a storage yard for loaded freight cars.” This was an especially important point in designing bridges on the scale Lindenthal had proposed, and his argument that such bridges would be heavily loaded over their entire floor only during testing or with “special discipline” enabled him and subsequent American bridge engineers to design relatively light structures for their size, thus making them economically feasible, if potentially structurally unstable.\n\nLate-nineteenth-century proposal for a railway bridge over the English Channel (photo credit 4.9)\n\nEnglish engineers, on the other hand, still remembering the Tay and watching the Forth Bridge grow, remained sensitive to the consequences of too light a structure. That there was a rivalry in fact as well as in judgment between engineers on the two sides of the ocean was brought home by Lindenthal’s closing his defense with the assertion that, in building bridges, American contractors had already established that they could hold their own with “contractors from England and other parts of the world.” When the Forth Bridge opened in March 1890, Engineering News would also appeal to national pride: “If English and Scotch railways can afford to bridge the Firth of Forth … the great trunk lines of this country and the City of New York combined should surely afford to bridge the North River.” The Brooklyn Bridge had for too short a time “stood unrivaled among bridge structures for its length of span,” and the North River bridge project was an opportunity for American engineers once again to “eclipse the latest effort of the Old World’s engineers.”\n\nLindenthal’s great bridge may have brought him some prominence among railroad executives and readers of Engineering News, but two years after his report he was still a newcomer to New Yorkers generally. This was evident, for example, in a front-page story in The New York Times that described the thirty-five-foot-long model being made to help convince representatives of the federal government to “take hold of the project and build a national bridge,” since private capital seemed impossible to raise and both New York and New Jersey were balking at the price tag. In one place in the story, the “Pittsburgh man” had his first name misspelled “Gustave,” and in another his surname was given as “Lilienthal.” In spite of, or perhaps to overcome, such misnonymity, he seemed to take his case wherever there was an audience, which in 1889 included the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Toronto. Lindenthal, furthermore, like Eads and Roebling and Baker before him, and like the builders of the greatest bridges after him, understood that different audiences had to be addressed in different ways. Politicians in Washington might best be swayed with a tangible model, but scientists meeting in Toronto would more likely listen to reason couched in terms of anthropology and natural science and of units of time approaching the scales used in geology.\n\n“That facility and rapidity of communication is a primary cause of civilization is recognized as an axiomatic truth,” Lindenthal began, and he proceeded to demonstrate that through practice his rhetoric was coming to be as sharp as his science: “The art of bridge building is ancient; the science of bridge building is modern.” He traced the development of bridge types, concluding that the suspension bridge was “as old as mankind itself, perhaps even older,” and he showed himself capable of scientific thinking in the Darwinian mode:\n\nZoölogists tell us of the methods employed by apes in crossing streams. Failing to find a fallen tree to act as a beam or truss bridge, or failing to find meeting tree branches forming a sort of cantilever bridge, apes, we are told, form a chain by hanging together hands and tails, and suspended thus over a stream from tree to tree, the rest of the tribe climb along this living bridge from shore to shore. The strength of the chain with its weakest link, was, in this case, the weakest monkey; and there can be little doubt that occasional failures of such living bridges must have engrafted that bit of wisdom early on our anthropological ancestors. Modern bridge engineering, based on mathematical deductions, could not improve it.\n\nA popular view of a possible stage in the evolution of bridges (photo credit 4.10)\n\nThe address was also full of technical details about strength and economy, demonstrating Lindenthal’s rational approach to bridge design and sound judgment about it that would, decades later, influence favorably the best of those engineers who would work under and learn from him. Engineers who would not heed the lessons of the master, especially with regard to a sense of natural and artifactual history, would find themselves embarrassed.\n\nNear the end of his address to the scientists, Lindenthal asked rhetorically of his dream, “How long will such a bridge last?” And he answered:\n\nIf well maintained under the most competent engineering superintendence, there is no reason why it should not last as long as the Egyptian pyramids. They were built of more perishable material than steel and iron, provided iron and steel are kept well painted and free from rust. Rust and man are indeed the only destructive agencies for such a structure. No tornado could blow the structure over. No earthquake could shake it down, unless it were so great that the rock would cave and split, and swallow up the North River.\n\nHe also recognized, however, that there was a potentially more destructive force, and Lindenthal began to slip into a political mode that was out of character for this address but would become more and more a part of his rhetoric in his later years. Some of his observations were prophetic; in his desire for aesthetically pleasing bridges he found a silver lining even in the clouds of war.\n\nMan is more destructive to structures than decay and rust. The necessity of war may bring about the destruction of large bridges in the future as it has in the past. This may not always be an unmixed evil, if inferior structures are destroyed and rebuilt by grander ones. The taste and desire for architectural harmony is growing, though as yet the standpoint of utility, without regard to appearance, is too prominent in most of our bridge structures.\n\nAs Benjamin Baker, near the end of his lecture on the Forth Bridge, had invoked and quoted Thomas Pope, so Lindenthal closed his address by recalling that Pope, “an ingenious and ambitious shipwright,” had eighty years earlier designed a gigantic wooden bridge, “partly cantilever, partly arch,” that would have crossed the East River between New York and Brooklyn in one eighteen-hundred-foot span. At the time, Pope had exhibited a model of his bridge, which was never realized. But, rather than see in the story of Pope a fatal paradigm for his own endeavors, Lindenthal saw hope. Pope had also proposed a single-span bridge to cross the North River, which he described, as he did other of his bridge plans, in “quaint verse”:\n\nThomas Pope’s early-nineteenth-century proposal for a bridge across the East River between New York and Brooklyn (photo credit 4.11)\n\nLike half a rainbow rising on yon shore,\n\nWhile the twin partner spans the semi o’er,\n\nAnd makes a perfect whole that need not part\n\nTill time has furnished us a nobler art.\n\nLindenthal took it upon himself to take over Pope’s dream and to fulfill it in a more modern material and form. He believed that he was indeed a master of the “nobler art” that had evolved into an “exact science” by the end of the nineteenth century, and he was resolute. Determination alone, however, does not build bridges.\n\n4\n\nIn the early spring of 1890, a bill was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives, and by early summer in the Senate, authorizing the North River Bridge Company to begin construction within three years, and requiring it to complete the structure within ten years after it was begun. With the approval of Washington, no further action by the notoriously contentious state legislatures was needed, nor was it sought, though it might have helped generate more solid local support for the bridge. In the meantime, the Consolidated New York & New Jersey Bridge Company had been formed out of the old 1868 charter issued by New Jersey and a more recent one issued by New York. The consolidated company did not have the federal authority needed to cross the interstate waterway, however, and so Lindenthal’s North River company seemed to have the edge. Engineering News, comparing the two companies, noted that Consolidated had plans of which “the public has never seen even an outline,” although there were newspaper reports that “the big bridge is started.”\n\nIn fact, a ground-breaking did occur on Christmas Eve, 1891, but “the circumstances attending the ceremony of turning the first sod were somewhat inauspicious,” for there was a pouring rainstorm, and the New York dignitaries and New Jersey delegates never did meet because of unclear directions to the site. However, even though some temporary trusswork was erected over an excavation for a tower on the Bergen County line, the company was believed to have had very little capital to proceed much further. It was reasonable to speculate, in fact, that Consolidated was hoping to have its charter bought out by the North River Bridge Company. Engineering News ridiculed the “spectacle” of “a few hackfuls of projectors trying in vain to find each other in the open country, turning over a single sod in a pouring rain storm,” but the journal was dead serious when it commented that it would be “sorry, indeed, to see any bridge design carried out in which symmetry and dignity of appearance are ignored, or in which the river channel is needlessly obstructed.” But two bridge companies continued to lay claim to charters for a Hudson River Bridge, and the similarities with the situation in St. Louis almost three decades earlier were not lost on close observers.\n\nThere is often a good deal of uncertainty as to exactly where a great bridge will be built, not the least for reasons connected with raising the capital. Among the most costly of items can be the purchase of land for the piers, anchorages, and approaches to the bridge, and if the location of these was fixed too early in the planning stage, real-estate speculation could increase the cost manyfold. Thus, as Engineering News pointed out in comparing the styles of the rival companies:\n\nThe North River Bridge Co. is wise enough to see that before an enterprise involving the expenditure of from $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 can be honestly and successfully launched something besides printer’s ink and wind is necessary. In enterprises of a great magnitude like this, everything depends, not upon the sale of isolated small blocks of stock to an uninformed public, but upon convincing great capitalists of the feasibility and future of the project. Before the latter can be done every detail of the plan must be worked out, every item of cost estimated upon sound data and traffic problems so carefully and exhaustively studied that the scheme can successfully stand the searching inquiry into its intrinsic merits that capitalists will surely inaugurate before putting money into it. It is worse than folly to invite general investment before this is done. And wide publicity of the exact location of proposed terminals and of other construction details is just the thing the business man will not seek until he has secured a considerable portion of the real estate necessary for his purposes. Nor will the promoter of a bona fide bridge take active steps in raising capital until he is fully informed as to the total cost of his scheme.\n\nAs an engineer, Lindenthal may have been cautious to a fault, for good engineering also involves decisiveness and an ability to fix on best estimates and go ahead with the business of raising money and turning sod. The strategy of detailed engineering analysis and uncertainty of location, as articulated in the journal that had virtually become Lindenthal’s soapbox, was not exactly working. To give a sense of the obfuscation and the concomitant confusion that in some cases may have been deliberately introduced by both bridge companies during the years from 1886 to 1890, the location of the bridge was reported in various sources as terminating in Manhattan: “near Desbrosses St.” … “somewhere between Seventieth and Eightieth streets” … “at about Sixtieth St.” … “between 10th and 181st Sts.” … “between Washington Heights and Spuyten Duyvil” … “at Fourteenth-Street” … “at Fort Washington”… “at any point in the city of New-York” … “near 13th St.”… “about Forty-second St.”\n\nFinancial conditions turned poor in 1893, and the prospects for any bridge across the Hudson looked bleak, especially as talk of tolls began to worry the railroad companies, among others. Cost of use was a real concern, for in early 1894 President Grover Cleveland had vetoed a bill that had passed Congress and that appeared to authorize the Consolidated New York & New Jersey Bridge Company to charge tolls on mail that passed over the proposed structure. The bill was vetoed also because it allowed for piers in the river, but they were still considered essential by those who did not believe a single span, suspended or not, to be possible.\n\nWith rival factions continuing to propose conflicting solutions, Cleveland appointed a commission of engineering experts “to recommend what length of span, not less than 2,000 ft., would be safe and practicable for a railway bridge across the Hudson River, between 59th and 69th Sts.” The board comprised Louis Gustave F. Bouscaren, William H. Burr, Theodore Cooper, George S. Morison, and Colonel C. W. Raymond, “all well known to American engineers.” Bouscaren had been born on the island of Guadeloupe in 1840 and was an 1863 graduate of France’s Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures. He had, among many other accomplishments, strengthened the cables of Roebling’s suspension bridge across the Ohio River at Cincinnati, and had built a railroad bridge across the Ohio that was at one time the longest truss span in the world. Burr, born in Watertown, Connecticut, in 1851, was an 1872 C.E. graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute who had taught at Rensselaer, worked as assistant to the chief engineer of the Phoenix Bridge Company, and taught civil engineering at Harvard before joining the faculty at Columbia. Cooper was, of course, at the peak of his career. Morison, born in Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1842, was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard, from which he was an 1863 arts graduate and an 1866 law graduate. Though admitted to the New York Bar in 1866, he never practiced the legal profession. He did go on to gain extensive experience in bridge designing and building, however, beginning in 1867 with work in Kansas City under Octave Chanute on the bridge over the Missouri River at Kansas City. On his own, Morison had been engaged in many bridge projects, including the Cairo Bridge over the Ohio River, which was among the longest bridges in the world in the 1880s. Charles Walker Raymond had been born in 1842 in Hartford, Connecticut, and graduated in 1860 from the newly formed Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, where his father was professor of English language and literature, and entered West Point the following year. He had a distinguished career with the Corps of Engineers, including charge of the Mississippi River levees and work on important harbor improvements, and would go on to play a key role in supervising the design and construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company’s improvements in, under, and around New York City. It was Raymond (who had shown an early talent for mathematics) who was to draft the analytical discussion of the theory of suspension bridges contained in the report of the board over which he presided.\n\nWithin three months of its appointment, the board reported that it was “of the unanimous opinion that a cantilever span of 3,100 ft. in the clear could be built and would be a safe structure,” but it would cost in excess of $50 million to cross the river thus without a pier. A pier in the center of the river would reduce the spans to two thousand feet and cut the cost of the bridge’s superstructure in half, but the foundations would have to be dug to 260 feet below the water, which not only would be dangerous for the workers but also would add an uncertain amount of $10 million or so to the cost. A suspension bridge, with six tracks and a span of thirty-one hundred feet, could be built, it was thought, for about the same amount as the shorter-spanned cantilever. Furthermore, if a lighter bridge was acceptable, a safe but more flexible suspension bridge could be built for about $30 million. On balance, taking into account the uncertainty associated with digging deep foundations, the board concluded in favor of a suspension bridge.\n\nAnother board of experts had been appointed earlier in 1894 by the secretary of war to look into questions relating to building bridges over navigable streams and, in particular, into the question of “the maximum length of span practicable for suspension bridges,” and to look into matters of “strength of materials, loads, foundations, wind pressure, oscillations and bracing.” The board comprised three members of the Corps of Engineers—then Major Raymond, and Captains William H. Bixby and Edward Burr—and its report acknowledged Lindenthal, Wilhelm Hildenbrand, and Leffert L. Buck, “for information and valuable suggestions.” Appendixes were contributed by Lindenthal (on temperature strains in hinged arches) and Josef Melan (on the theory of the stiffening girder). Clearly, the board of army engineers had gone into considerable technical depth in the nine months it took to prepare its classic report, which treated in detail matters of oscillation and other causes of failure in suspension bridges, and thus provided “one of the most valuable and instructive engineering investigations of the day … in a field that has hitherto been practically unexplored,” according to Engineering News. The conclusion of the board was that a six-track suspension bridge of thirty-two-hundred foot main span was practicable at an estimated cost of $23 million, and that traffic in 1894 warranted such a bridge, although it should be so constructed that its capacity could be increased in the future, as needed. In addition to addressing the Hudson River problem, the board had looked at the more general feasibility question, and concluded also that it was possible to build a suspension span as long as 4,335 feet.\n\nThough the report of the army engineers removed technical objections to the suspension bridge, it did not fully dispose of financial objections. Indeed, even Engineering News admitted that, whereas it had been projected that there was rail traffic enough to cover the actual construction cost, it was not clear that the bridge could “attract a traffic sufficient to pay the interest on its cost.” The Consolidated New York & New Jersey Bridge Company challenged the objections to a pier in the river, and also questioned whether the foundation for such a pier had to be dug so deep and therefore had to be so expensive as was feared, but the secretary of war continued to rule in favor of a suspension bridge. The argument for a cantilever did not end, however, in part because of the success of the Forth Bridge and in part because of the vulnerability of the suspension-bridge type to attack. Traffic on Brooklyn Bridge was an ongoing problem, aggravated in part by the structure’s inability to carry heavy engines, thus requiring that cable cars be used on the bridge, and switching them about at the terminals presented an endless scheduling and capacity problem. To make matters worse, the bridge that had been held up as the counterexample to the persistent belief that suspension bridges could not carry railroad traffic, John Roebling’s Niagara Gorge Bridge, was in the process of being replaced—and a cantilever was being proposed. The forty-year-old landmark bridge was showing signs of wear, and the weight of railroad trains had increased considerably since it was built. In reporting this development, the praise of Engineering News sounded faint indeed:\n\nTo Mr. Roebling belongs all the credit for teaching engineers how to use wire in this form in a railway bridge; and that his connections were faulty in the light of modern practice, and that his stiffening truss was no such truss at all, does not detract from his boldness as an engineer and the services he performed in developing the manufacture of wire in this country.\n\nThe cantilever was well suited to the eight-hundred-foot span over the Niagara Gorge, and it would be the “cheaper, stiffer, and better structure,” admitted Engineering News, but the suspension bridge was still the bridge of choice for spans on the order of three thousand feet.\n\nThe recent competition for a bridge over the Danube at Budapest was cited as an indication that “engineers are only now beginning to more carefully study the principles and details of suspension bridge construction.” Indeed, first prize in that competition went to a thousand-foot-main-span wire-cable suspension bridge, but the design did not receive the bonus prize money that would have been awarded had the cost of the bridge not exceeded $1 million. In fact, the bridge—whose land spans looked like the side aisles of a Gothic cathedral, and whose tollbooths were built over the anchorages, also forming pedestals for equestrian statues—was estimated to cost almost twice that amount. Second and third places went to some very handsome cantilever designs, one of which looked like a suspension bridge in profile, and each of which was estimated to cost under $1 million. Of the remaining seventy-odd designs that were submitted from Europe and America, three additional ones were bought for possible use in Budapest. Among these was a chain suspension bridge, the only design of its kind submitted. This bridge and the top three winners were illustrated in Engineering News in 1894; the journal unfortunately used words alone to describe some others, “which seemed to be intended only to furnish amusement to the jurors in their arduous work”:\n\nOne design for a one-span bridge at Eskuter shows curiously curved trusses, freely resting on abutments. The widely separated chords of the trusses are stiffened by enormous rings, and are ornamented by a legion of saints’ statues. The wagon traffic moves over a suspended roadway, while the foot passengers climb over the bold curve of the top chord. Another fantastic design consisted of an iron tube of 1,020 ft. span, made up of Mannesmann tubes placed parallel and connected with each other by iron bars, riveted in spirals to the tubes.\n\nAs Engineering News was to editorialize, on the occasion of the replacement of the Niagara Gorge Suspension Bridge with a stiffer steel structure, “there is no knowing to what flights over space the bridge of the future may attain.” Money was admitted to be the limiting factor. In bridging the Hudson, the question was not of money alone, however, for the secretary of war would simply not approve a cantilever design with a pier in the river. The Consolidated New York & New Jersey Bridge Company thus asked Theodore Cooper, its consulting engineer, to prepare specifications for a suspension-bridge design. Since he had never designed such a bridge himself, his specifications only covered such things as the load the bridge was to carry, the foundation conditions, and materials of construction. Bidders were invited to select the geometrical outlines, and Cooper’s firm leaned toward the design of the Union Bridge Company, which guaranteed to build for no more than $25 million a 3,110-foot span with “immense rigid trusses” supported by twelve cables. The design was that of Charles MacDonald, organizer and president of Union, who had been born in Ontario, Canada, in 1837. After working on surveys for the Grand Trunk railroads, he entered the United States in 1854, immediately began studies at Rensselaer Institute, and received a degree in civil engineering in 1857. Among much other railroad and bridge-building experience, Mac Donald supervised the design of the great cantilever bridge across the Hudson at Poughkeepsie, but his suspension-bridge design for the New York crossing was an unharmonious concoction.\n\nLindenthal’s North River Bridge Company was denying rumors that it was going to relinquish its charter, which was to expire in mid-1895, “unless something were done by that time showing the sincere purpose of the company to construct the work for which they have obtained powers.” The company claimed that “work had quietly commenced some time ago upon the New Jersey anchorage,” and that it had spent more money acquiring property and advancing the plans than its rival. In fact, according to a cornerstone reportedly snatched from the jaws of destruction almost a century later by Lindenthal’s grandson, ground was indeed broken on June 8, 1895, and the first foundation masonry was laid at the site of the Hoboken anchorage, opposite Manhattan’s 23rd Street. What was needed back then, however, was not ceremony but $21 million for the bridge proper and $15 million for property and accessories, which was admitted to be “an enormous sum of money, and the financiering of the bridge far exceeds in difficulty the engineering problems presented, unprecedented as these last are.”\n\nIn the meantime, support was growing for completing construction of a tunnel under the Hudson, since the bridge companies continued to focus on elevated approaches, which was the costlier method of getting railroads into the city. Late in 1897, an editorial in Engineering News accused the bridge promoters of failing “to appreciate the fact that it is the suburban traffic, and practically that alone, on which their structures must depend for income” from tolls. The journal, which after the death of Wellington had no longer simply embraced Lindenthal’s ideas, had become a voice of reason. In a letter challenging the editorial, Lindenthal simply reiterated his position on the bridge, which pretty much everyone by then knew, or was expected to know. But there were alternatives.\n\nThe Hudson Tunnel Railroad Company had been chartered in 1873, and ground was broken the following year. There were to be two tunnels, each containing a single track, but opposition lawsuits delayed the work until the end of the decade, and work was stopped in 1882, after over a million dollars had been spent but no more money could be raised in America. John Fowler and Benjamin Baker were approached in late 1887 and asked if they thought the tunnels could be completed for the amounts American contractors were estimating—namely, $900,000 for one tube and $1.2 million for the other. After consulting European tunnel engineers, and after a visit to the unique New York site by Baker, who inspected the books of the contractors to understand the cost of American labor, the designers of the incomplete but already famous Forth Bridge gave their support to the Hudson River tunnel scheme, which brought $1.5 million of British money into the project.\n\nBy the turn of the century, tunnel projects in and around New York were inextricably associated with the names of William Gibbs McAdoo, an entrepreneurial lawyer from Georgia, and Charles Matthias Jacobs, a Yorkshire-born, privately tutored, and apprentice-trained engineer who had come to America in 1889 and subsequently designed tunnels for rapid transit and gas lines under New York’s East River. An exact contemporary of Lindenthal’s, Jacobs had become involved with Hudson River tunnels in 1895. As Jacobs and McAdoo were demonstrating the feasibility of tunneling under the Hudson, electric-traction locomotives were being developed, obviating the objection that smoke would choke passengers in the tunnels. Thus the Pennsylvania Railroad decided to build its own rail tunnels under the river, thereby removing themselves as the most significant potential supporter of Lindenthal’s bridge. In the meantime, over the past decade, Lindenthal had become established and well known as a consulting engineer in New York. In 1902, he found himself appointed by reform mayor Seth Low as the city’s commissioner of bridges; this necessarily redirected his attention from the North to the East River, which was contained wholly within the city of New York. But intracity and intrastate politics could complicate bridge design and construction at least as much as interstate issues.\n\n5\n\nEven before the Brooklyn Bridge was formally opened in 1883, there were calls for additional bridges between Manhattan Island and Long Island, on which the then separate city of Brooklyn was located. A new bridge was proposed to connect New York with Brooklyn’s Williamsburg section. Another was proposed farther north; here the presence in the river of Blackwell’s Island reduced the size of spans needed, while an approach convenient to Brooklyn’s City Hall was still possible. A charter for a Williamsburg bridge was obtained in 1892 by Frederick Uhlmann, whose interest appears to have been in extending the Brooklyn elevated railways into New York; this would have been a lucrative endeavor, given the congestion on the nearby Brooklyn Bridge, which was being loaded to its limit. When an East River Bridge Commission was formed, it bought out Uhlmann’s charter and appointed L. L. Buck as chief engineer to design a bridge capable of carrying an elevated railway as well as trolley cars.\n\nLeffert Lefferts Buck was born in Canton, New York, in 1837 and received bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the local college, St. Lawrence, before attending Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He graduated in 1868, his studies having been interrupted by the Civil War, which he entered as a private in the Sixtieth New York Infantry. After a period as assistant engineer on New York’s Croton Aqueduct project, he worked on railroad bridges and other engineering projects in Peru, Mexico, Aruba, and many locations around the United States. He oversaw the rebuilding of various parts of Roebling’s Niagara Gorge Suspension Bridge during the period 1877—1886 and, later, its replacement with an arch, which had superseded the cantilever proposal. He became chief engineer of the Williamsburg Bridge project in 1895 and would continue in that capacity until the bridge was opened in 1903 as the largest suspension bridge in the world, with a central span of sixteen hundred feet—four feet six inches longer than the Brooklyn Bridge. Its approaches were to be so long that the entire length of the bridge would stretch for seventy-two hundred feet, between Clinton Street in Manhattan and Roebling Street in Brooklyn.\n\nLeffert L. Buck, chief engineer of the Williamsburg Bridge (photo credit 4.12)\n\nWhen plans for the Williamsburg Bridge were first published in Engineering News, in 1896, it was criticized “from an aesthetical point of view,” and there appeared to be considerable visual discontinuity associated with the roadway at the towers, which were nothing like the monumental stone towers of the Brooklyn Bridge. Indeed, the shift at the towers from an above-deck truss to an under-deck truss made the truss itself look as if it had been severed by some angled guillotinelike device. In spite of this image, Buck’s towers were remarkable in that they were all steel, and they were defended by Engineering News, which was “utterly opposed to false ornamentation in similar structures and to any attempt to disguise the real materials of construction or the chief lines of stress.” The journal did admit, however, that, “in a monumental work of this character, in the center of a great city, good taste in design and proper ornamentation must be considered; and if a more pleasing effect can be secured … the effort should certainly be made and is worth the added cost.”\n\nIn his report to the commissioners in September 1896, Buck asserted that the bridge could be completed by January 1, 1900, at a cost of $7 million, which compared very favorably with the $15-million final price tag of the Brooklyn Bridge. With regard to the cost, Engineering Newscriticized the commissioners for being overly frugal with the salary of the chief engineer, upon whose “judgment, skill and experience the safety and convenience of the great numbers who will use the bridge for generations to come, depend solely.” Buck’s salary was $10,000 per year, whereas “the same commission pays out about $75,000 for two and one-half years’ work of a legal counsellor.” The editorial went on to anticipate what Lindenthal would say of Cooper a decade later—namely, that the low compensation granted engineers was a reflection of the “ignorance of the true value of the engineer” in such a large project, and it was “humiliating to the whole profession of engineers.” The question of the compensation of engineers versus lawyers was especially keen at the time, because an injunction had been sought against the commissioners, who had limited bidding to those who could supply steel made by the “acid open-hearth process,” as specified by Buck. The court refused to issue the injunction, and Engineering News praised the decision, concluding, “An engineer may not be infallible in his decision of engineering questions; but we shall make no gain by setting a lawyer to review his decision.” An engineer like Buck was receptive to criticism, however, and the lines of the deck were much improved in a revised view of the bridge published later in the year. Though it retained the straight-cable profile on the land-based spans, because they were to be supported from below as girders and not suspended from the cables, the deck had achieved a continuity that Buck’s earlier sketch had lacked. Whether the Williamsburg Bridge would be seen as a graceful swan or as an ugly duckling beside the Brooklyn Bridge would be largely a matter of taste.\n\nSketch of an early design detail for a tower and the roadway of the Williamsburg Bridge (photo credit 4.13)\n\nSince a suspension bridge was required by the legislation authorizing the crossing, a cantilever could not be considered, even though it might have been more economical. However, economic considerations rather than aesthetic ones did strongly influence the appearance of the Williamsburg Bridge, especially with regard to its towers and cables, among the most costly components of any suspension bridge. Furthermore, economic and technical design factors are often intertwined. The decision, for example, to have the cables come straight down from the towers to the anchorages, and not support the land spans, meant shorter and lighter cables could be used, thus reducing their size and thereby their cost. Had stone or masonry towers been employed, they would have had to be very wide and heavy, in order to accommodate all the rails and roadways that would have had to pass through them. Employing lighter steel towers made smaller foundations (very costly components of any bridge) possible, and much time and cost were saved. “Roughly speaking, masonry towers would require foundations twice as large, would cost five times as much, and would take three times as long to build,” according to a contemporary report. Moreover, using steel towers meant they could be built taller, thus allowing the cables to have a deeper curve; they did not have to be stretched so tight, and so could be smaller in diameter. Economic considerations also led to the choice of steel viaducts rather than masonry arches for the bridge approaches.\n\nThe construction of the Williamsburg Bridge was well under way when its administration was passed from a board of commissioners to the newly appointed commissioner of bridges, Gustav Lindenthal, on January 1, 1902, ending Buck’s role as chief engineer. Though Lindenthal must have had severe reservations about the design and appearance of the Williamsburg Bridge, he avoided talking about them in his brief official address at the dedication ceremonies, in which he announced that the bridge was ready for traffic, on December 19, 1903. He simply described the monstrosity he had inherited as “the heaviest suspension bridge in existence, and the largest bridge on this continent.” In comparing the Williamsburg to the Brooklyn Bridge, he noted that the newer structure was twice as strong—something New Yorkers would have appreciated, since the limitations on the strength of the Brooklyn Bridge had curtailed the commuter traffic across it for some time. Nevertheless, it was the older bridge that was the architectural success: “The imposing and stately stone towers of the Brooklyn bridge give that structure the appearance of great strength, but in the steel towers of the new bridge, and in all its other elements, a greater power of resistance is hidden.”\n\nThe Williamsburg Bridge, upon its dedication in December 1903 (photo credit 4.14)\n\nRather than dwell on comparisons, however, Lindenthal spoke of the future of bridges. His words were prescient:\n\nSo far as engineering science can foretell with confidence, this colossal structure, if protected against corrosion, its only deadly enemy, will stand hundreds of years in unimpaired strength.…\n\nOur city will be pre-eminently the city of great bridges, representing emphatically for centuries to come the civilization of our age, the age of iron and steel. A time must come, not many generations distant, perhaps not more distant than the crusades in the past, when the building of such colossal structures will cease because the principal material of which they are molded, that is, iron and steel, will not be [any] longer obtainable in sufficient quantity and cheapness. When the iron age has gone, the great steel bridges of New York will be looked upon as even greater monuments than they are now.\n\nGustav Lindenthal, as he appeared when he was commissioner of bridges for New York City, 1902–03 (photo credit 4.15)\n\nFor all of Lindenthal’s grand projections into the future, the Williamsburg, along with many other New York bridges, would be in danger of collapsing long before the century was out. Forgetting his caveat about a bridge’s “only deadly enemy,” corrosion, New York and many other cities would during times of fiscal crisis neglect and defer maintenance of bridges like the Williamsburg to an alarming degree.\n\nEven when the Williamsburg was young, there were problems with it. Within three years of its completion, headlines reported that, because it had “such a liking for the Borough,” the bridge was “slipping to Brooklyn.” Evidently, the bridge had been “out of place since it was built,” but it was only then becoming known that “efforts to correct it had failed.” According to The New York Times, “a piece of engineering computation of the utmost nicety” was taking into account every ounce of material in the structure to determine the needed adjustment, so that the heavy cars of the elevated railroad could be allowed to run over it. Studying, straightening, and strengthening the Williamsburg Bridge continued on and off for about a decade. Two additional supports were added under each of the (unsuspended) land spans, and additional steel was added to the deck so that it could carry the heavier subway cars that had been developed since the bridge was designed. In fact, something similar was going to happen to many of the bridges around the world, because of changing conditions and philosophy, as articulated in 1911 by one of the engineers involved with the Williamsburg Bridge strengthening project:\n\nMr. Buck designed the bridge on the theory that traffic should adapt itself to the bridge; we are now proceeding on the theory that such a bridge should adapt itself to traffic and that it should be as good as any other for traffic purposes, and not be a weak link. Mr. Buck designed the bridge for small locomotives drawing trailers. To-day, in a six-car train, there are generally four motors, all heavier than any of the old locomotives. The trolley cars also have increased in weight. The bridge is perfectly able to carry its traffic to-day, but as it now stands it would be inadequate for the future. Ten-car steel trains will probably be run through the subway loop, for one thing, and for such conditions we must provide.\n\nBuck had, however, designed a sound if unattractive bridge for the conditions he knew and under the conditions he worked. When some corrosion was discovered on the wrapping of the cables, they were uncovered in 1921 and found to be well preserved, and the steelwork generally to be in “perfect condition.” At that time, Engineering News-Record, which had in 1917 been formed of a merger of Engineering News with the Engineering Record, noted that this condition of the cables “gave fair assurance that main parts of the great New York suspension bridges have an indefinite length of life.” Indeed, the journal was tempted to say, they had an “unlimited life,” if properly cared for:\n\nSuch bridges, in other words, are not subject to perceptible decay, and so far as corrosion is concerned they may remain free from measurable deterioration if intelligent inspection and maintenance are applied. As we look at the ancient stone bridges of Europe we reflect with wonder and admiration on their endurance through the ages; yet it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that our great steel bridges may survive as long.\n\nIntelligent inspection and maintenance are more readily called for than provided, however, as has been discovered in more recent years. Times and conditions change. Even the great stone monuments of Europe have been found to be susceptible to increasingly acidic environments. Inspection can uncover deterioration, but arresting or reversing it is another matter. Yet, in the early years of this century, when vehicle emissions were not even dreamed to pose the threat to stone and steel that we know them to today, bridges continued to be designed for the conditions of the time. And there were many bridges to design.\n\n6\n\nIf the Williamsburg Bridge was well under way when Lindenthal became commissioner of bridges in 1902, two other East River crossings were not. Both the Blackwell’s Island Bridge, farther north, and the Manhattan Bridge, to be constructed between the Brooklyn and the Williamsburg, were still on the drawing board. (Though the foundation for the Brooklyn tower of the Manhattan Bridge had actually been contracted for, this in no way meant that changes could not be made in the design of the towers themselves or the general superstructure.)\n\nShortly after a city ordinance authorizing a third bridge across the East River between Brooklyn and Manhattan was signed by the mayor early in 1900, bonds amounting to $1 million were issued, engineering work was begun, and bids for foundations were invited by early March. Since the Manhattan Bridge, as it was called from the beginning, was to be located wholly within the city of New York, the process was relatively efficient. The design had been largely completed when Lindenthal took over as bridge commissioner.\n\n"
