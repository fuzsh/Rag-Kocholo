        "text": "ARTS-UG 1001 First-Year Arts Workshop: Adaptation, Performance and Analysis (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn this course students will learn methods for making imaginative and engaging performances from a variety of literary sources. Through a journey of text analysis we will create performances inspired by a variety of sources including short stories, poems, newspaper articles, interviews, and essays. This course will introduce students to the basic tools of literary and performance analysis, adaptation, and devised theater techniques. Readings may include texts by Italo Calvino, Jorge Luis Borges, Philip K. Dick, T.S. Eliot, Madeline L’Engle, George Orwell, as well as excerpts from newspaper articles or scientific journals. Techniques for the creation of solo performance as well as small and large group collaboration will also be introduced. Students with an interest in a variety of arts practices (theater, dance, music, visual arts, media arts, etc.) are encouraged to participate; no previous experience necessary.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1007 Keeping It Real: Realism in Writing and Acting on Stage (4 Credits)\n\nSince the terms Realism and Naturalism were first applied to plays by writers like Ibsen or Strindberg, the attempt to create a semblance of everyday life on stage has defined and sometimes dominated Western drama, even by inspiring other styles and movements in reaction. This course will explore the forms and purposes - the how and the why - of these “realistic” approaches to theater, both from a literary and a performance perspective. With the 19th Century movement in visual arts and literature as background, and contemporary equivalents in other media as context, we will ask what is particular about Realism as a way of seeing or defining the “real”? What perspectives and assumptions does it use to recreate the details of lived experience, and what does a theater audience experience? We will look at some classic 20th Century English-language theatrical examples (e.g. Miller, Hansberry), alongside contemporary pieces that draw from them (Baker, Hudes, Lee). Acting and directing texts from Uta Hagen and Harold Clurman, as well as writing about associated acting styles (such as “The Method”), will guide our work. Through rehearsing scenes and critical analysis, students will interrogate the techniques and their assumptions, asking what they now might offer us, in a culture suffused in “reality TV” and filmed recreations of the \"real\". The class will then create and perform their own scenes inspired by and/or critiquing this tradition.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1009 Voicing the Text (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn this class we study vocal and performance technique, as well as the art of rhetoric and persuasive communication. We will put these two studies together to practice and investigate how to communicate thought and evoke pathos, understanding and action from our audiences. Students will discuss, analyze and perform texts from classic and modern plays and poetry, as well as ancient and contemporary political texts. This course will ask questions such as: What is the difference between texts that are intended to be heard versus texts that are intended to be read? How do the musical qualities of the voice (such as tone, timbre and inflection) affect the content and reception of the message? How does a performer give voice to a playwright's words? How do our vocal habits affect our ability to communicate clearly? How can we each use our natural voice to its best and most profound effect?\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1011 Voicing the Text (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nNow more than ever young people need to know how to use their voices in a way that will have the greatest impact on the listener. In this class we study vocal and performance technique and the art of persuasive communication. We will put these two practices together to investigate how to most effectively communicate in order to evoke pathos, understanding and action from our audiences. Students will discuss, analyze and perform texts from classic and modern plays, ancient and contemporary politicians and youth activists . This course will ask questions such as: What is the difference between texts that are intended to be heard versus texts that are intended to be read? How do the musical qualities of the voice (such as tone, timbre and inflection) affect the content and reception of the message? How does a performer give voice to a playwright's words? How do our vocal habits affect our ability to communicate clearly?

During the semester we investigate what makes for joyful, effective, and exciting rehearsal, striving to develop a process that is as powerful as any performance. How do we make the events of the play happen \"in the room?\" How do we take responsibility for what our character says and does from the first read-through? How do we connect with poetic or complicated language? How do we speak and listen from the same \"place?\" What is the purpose of \"table work?\" How do we make authentic physical choices? As we pursue these questions, we engage with several of the actor's technical and artistic challenges and focus on developing the acting instrument through voice and speech, physicality, and style work. We begin with Shakespearean monologues to build a common vocabulary, and move to modern and contemporary scene work.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1013 Acting: Rehearsing the Play (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis class approaches acting from the belief that an actor's job is learning how to rehearse.

We begin with Shakespearean monologues to build a common vocabulary, and move to modern and contemporary scene work that culminates in a public presentation—giving each student the chance to share his/her work with an audience. Students must wear appropriate rehearsal clothes and will be asked to rehearse outside of class time.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1014 Something to Sing About: Acting in Musical Theatre (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThe “American Musical” as it has evolved over the last century has become a remarkable model of interdisciplinary practice. From its early iterations and influences in burlesque, vaudeville, and operetta to the complex contemporary amalgams of book, music, lyrics, and dance, the American musical has proven a rich crucible for the exploration of identity and culture, form and content, and ideas and emotions. This arts workshop will offer actors a technical foundation for acting in musical theater. We will deal broadly with the history of musical theater in context by exploring both the process by which actors engage with musical material and the development and aesthetics of the form. Participants will work on songs and scenes taken from the giants of musical theater including: Rodgers & Hammerstein, Kander & Ebb, Stephen Sondheim, and more. How do we merge the receiving nature of acting with the giving nature of singing? How do we “justify” the decision to sing at all? Our survey of the evolution of musical theater will ask: What does the history of the American musical tell us about our cultural history? What do musicals teach us about the interdisciplinary nature of living in the arts? All students in this course must be comfortable and confident singing actors. Everyone will be required to rehearse outside of class time, complete written and analytical assignments, and commit to a public presentation at the end of the semester. In order to be accepted into this course, attendance at the first class is mandatory for all, including registered students.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1019 His Advice to Players: Shakespeare in Perform. (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\n“Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines.” – Hamlet, (III.ii) Taking our cue from Shakespeare himself, this course will introduce students to methods of approaching the text from an actor’s perspective. We will investigate several interpretive techniques that help the performer make the connections between the text, mind, and body. Special focus will be given to the development of a strong vocal instrument and bold interpretive choices that embrace the muscularity of the language. We will explore the structure of the language and how the structure helps the performer make sense of the complexities within the text as well as specific choices related to character and action. The course will also feature a screening component where we examine the range of interpretation of the plays as demonstrated in the work of actors and directors by viewing contrasting versions of the same scene from video and film. Students will work on speeches and scenes from the canon and present their work in class. Students will also keep a journal and attend performances of a Shakespearean play in New York City.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nARTS-UG 1020 Character Creation for Performance (4 Credits)\n\nCharacter portrayals in theatre and film allow the audience to see the world through the eyes of both the familiar and the unfamiliar. This workshop will focus on the craft and technique of character acting for performance using a variety of acting and improvisational theatre exercises to hone and polish full-bodied, multi-dimensional character portrayals. Voice and movement techniques help ground and center the body so actors can find the physical gestures needed to transform themselves to perform characters as well as to find the ways to develop character voices. The connection between body and voice is explored in the experiential practice in this workshop as well as specific training in comedic timing. Readings of plays and monologues with a focus on characters will include works by documentary theatre artists, playwrights and solo performers such as Jean Giraudoux, Anna Deveare Smith, Eric Bogosian, Eve Ensler, Moises Kaufman, and Dale Orlander-Smith. Research projects look at several twentieth-century characters?performers, humorists, writers and monologists?including but not limited to Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ruth Gordon, Danitra Vance, Lily Taylor, Lord Buckley, Eddie Izzard, Richard Pryor, Judy Holiday, Quentin Crisp, Lily Tomlin. Previous study in one or more of the following is helpful: acting, movement theatre, improvisation, comedy or voice. Loose comfortable clothing is a must.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1023 Advanced Shakespeare Scene Study: Roman Tragedies (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn this course we will continue to build on the basic foundation of text analysis for actors through in-depth scene study of Shakespeare’s Roman tragedies. Students will work on a variety of scenes in addition to speeches and soliloquies. We will also consider the works in their historical and political context. The course will culminate in a workshop presentation of scenes and speeches from the plays. This course is intended for students with a prior background in acting and Shakespeare; it assumes a basic knowledge of Shakespearean text analysis from an actor’s point of view (an understanding of how rhythm, scansion, punctuation, operative words, etc. inform the possibilities of meaning). Readings include Julius Caesar, Coriolanus, Antony and Cleopatra,Titus Andronicus.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nARTS-UG 1024 Classical Theater Intensive: Shakespeare in Performance (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nWorking with Fiasco Theater, the principal goal of this intensive class is to give students training in a variety of acting and performance techniques for the classic stage. Each class session will be divided into workshops, which will focus on such topics as: voice and speech, stage combat, clown, working with verse, physical metaphor, and ensemble games. The second half of the class sessions will involve collective rehearsal of excerpts of one Shakespeare play. This intensive will be appropriate for all students interested in the performance of Shakespeare. All students will participate in all activities, but the focus of each student can include a diversity of roles. For the Summer 2021 session, the exact course work will be created by the professors and students together, based around the to-be-determined balance of in person and online classes.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1027 Performing the Real: Solo and Alternative Performance (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis is a class in solo performance composition for performers, dancers and students interested in performance art and its histories. Participants develop a solo performance through exercises using memory, movement and written and visual imagery, and explore the associative strategies of collage and pastiche as methodologies for structuring material. The solos emerge from a process involving improvisation, composing, and revision of material. Readings include performance texts by prominent artists, essays on performance, and video viewings, which foreground the tendency in performance to explore subjectivity and identity in light of social and political critique. Required texts include Jo Bonney\"s Extreme Exposure and Lenora Champagne\"s Out from Under: Texts by Women Performance Artists . Additional readings are assigned and posted on NYU Classes . Assignments include creating a solo performance from the material developed in class, along with a written analysis of two live solo or alternative performances, and an oral presentation. Strategies learned in this class are also useful for composing group work.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1029 Creating Drama from Character (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis course will immerse students in the process of using in-depth character exploration and an ensemble process as the basis of dramatic storytelling. Embracing the intimate constraints of the digital realm, students will work together to develop character-based scenes by combining improvisation and playwriting, taking playwright/filmmaker Mike Leigh's \"improvised play\" and \"drawing from life\" as a particular model. We will also be analyzing (and sometimes trying out) a variety of contrasting practices and theories of ensemble creation in the US, Britain and South Africa, comparing earlier models (the Serpent Players, Joint Stock, the Wooster Group) with contemporary companies, some of which continue Leigh's approach. The class will draw on instructor Ian Morgan's experience developing and producing character-driven ensemble work, including work by Mike Leigh and Tectonic Theatre Project, at Off-Broadway's The New Group, and will include visits from master practitioners.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1031 Scenic Design in the Performing Arts: Theatre,Dance, Film and Television (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis course is an introduction to the principles and practice of theatrical scenic design. The vocabulary of visual imagery is woven into a history of theater, décor, and architecture and is developed through the practice of graphic communication—the disciplines of drawing, painting and model-building necessary for the expression of visual ideas in architecture, set, and lighting design. We explore how theatrical texts communicate in three-dimensional spaces and designs that respond to the author, director, and musical form (musical theater and opera). Students are expected to complete a series of scenic designs in models and two-dimensional presentations. Exercises integrate the principles of composition, value, color pattern, geometric form, and rhythm in the creation of three-dimensional shapes within a theatrical space—as in the sequence of acts or scenes in a drama. We deal in depth with the discipline of design skills, drafting and presentation craft as well as the reality of shop fabrication and load-in at the studio or theater. Although this is not a course in art direction for film and/or television, we discuss the differences in design for theater, film, and television.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1032 Directing for the Twenty-first Century (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nWhat is direction? What informs it? Given the seismic changes taking place around the world concerning technology, communication, politics, and climate, what are the implications concerning stage direction in the 21st century? This course examines the emergence of the stage director in Western theater practice, how the craft of directing has evolved since the last century, and some of the ways the role is being questioned and deconstructed in the United States. We will begin with an examination of event structure and analysis of material. Special emphasis will be given to rehearsal frameworks that cultivate an understanding of the collaborative nature of directing as well as build equitable and inclusive spaces fostering generosity, encouragement, and risk-taking. Throughout the course particular attention will be given to the relationship between form and content, modes of spectatorship, and the premises and assumptions informing interpretive choices. Students will analyze productions with specific attention to the relationship between form and content; present and observe creative work using a vocabulary for critical analysis; and keep a journal responding to readings. Readings may include work by practitioners and theorists such as Claudia Alick, Nicole Brewer, Young Jean Lee, Madeline Sayet, Liz Lerman, and Aleshea Harris.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1037 The Open Voice (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis arts workshop is co-taught by Annie Piper, yoga and qigong instructor, and Jessie Austrian, voice and speech teacher. In it we will study vocal technique for actors in a truly interdisciplinary manner using the physical practices of vinyasa yoga and qigong, the voice techniques of Cicely Berry, Chuck Jones and FM Alexander, and readings from ancient and contemporary philosophers and poets. Every class will fully engage the body, voice and mind, ultimately seeking to unify these three components of the self so that each student can use his or her unique instrument most efficiently and effectively. This course will ask questions such as: What does it means to “be present” as performers, creators, public speakers and citizens? How can a performer use his/her vocal instrument in the most open and free manner? How do we listen on stage? How can we each be at the center of our own rehearsal process? How do individuals form a collective ensemble? What is mindfulness? Students will explore these questions both intellectually and physically throughout the semester. Students must attend the first class in order to stay enrolled, and are required to wear movement clothes and bring a yoga mat to the first and every class.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1038 Something to Sing About: Acting in Musical Theatre (2 Credits)\n\nThe “American Musical” as it has evolved over the last century has become a remarkable model of interdisciplinary practice.

Each morning will be divided into workshops, which will focus on such topics as: voice and speech, stage combat, clowning, working with verse, physical metaphor, writing and adapting songs for Shakespearean performance, and ensemble games. The afternoon will involve collective rehearsal of the Shakespeare play to be performed on the last day. This intensive will be appropriate for all students interested in the performance of Shakespeare, and attention will be paid to providing opportunities for those most interested in directing or designing as well as acting. All students will participate in all activities, but the focus of each student can include a diversity of roles.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1045 Oral History, Cultural Identity and The Arts (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nOral history is a complex process in the creation of artistic projects across disciplines: documentary film, theatre, book arts, exhibitions, interactive websites, public radio, etc. This course offers training in interviewing and editing techniques, and looks at the ethics and impact of \"truth-telling\" on the people we interview, their families and friends, ourselves and the culture at large. Research explores the ways artistic projects informed by oral history have impacted popular culture and contributed to the larger discussion about race, ethnicity, gender, identity and what makes up a community. Readings, listening to public radio documentaries, and viewing films will be used to address the balance of accuracy and expressive forms in reflecting the realities and integrity of the people represented while staying true to the vision of the artist. Readings include (but are not limited to): Art Spiegelman\"s Maus I & II; works by Studs Terkel including Working; listening to audio and reading slave narratives from Remembering Slavery project recorded in the 1930s, (Smithsonian); Crossing the BLVD, Lehrer/Sloan; Anna Deveare Smith, and projects that address the issues about accountability, the power of listening, poetry from oral histories, and oral narratives that form a collective history. For final projects students create collaborative or solo work in the discipline of their own training; theatre, artist books, dance/movement, photography, poetry, music, radio, audio art, film or video.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1050 Performing Stories: East Meets West (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn this course we create characters inspired by history, memory, dreams and world lore through challenging exercises that fuse Eastern contemplative traditions and Western theatrical improvisation. Students learn how to access different aspects of themselves to enhance their own creative process and create a uniquely authentic theatre. Each session begins with a guided sitting meditation followed by vocal exercises and physical warm ups, based on Taoist exercises and Western dance techniques. Our character work is inspired by the Buddhist tradition of \"mindfulness/awareness\" practice, in which we place ourselves totally in the present moment. We work in solos, duos and groups, amended by Covid restrictions, gradually adding costumes, props and music. Open to theater students, dancers, musicians, visual artists, writers, techies—all those interested in discovering their own source of deep invention. Readings include Chögyam Trungpa's Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior and excerpts from Dharma Art (now titled True Perception), John Welwood's Ordinary Magic and Pema Chodron's The Wisdom of No Escape.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1052 Native American Traditions and Arts (4 Credits)\n\nNative Americans have been villainized and romanticized, studied and collected for five hundred years, yet they appear as mysterious and elusive to the modern world as they did to Christopher Columbus. Who are these people who have been the original inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere for over forty thousand years and yet continue to be the most misrepresented and misunderstood Americans? We will compare and contrast the perceptions of Native and Non-Native people and study the effects that they had on one another through sharing our own cultural experiences through our music, art, poetry, and humor. We will learn about the intricate tapestry of American history and culture that we take for granted and perhaps in the process learn more about who we are. Readings include Indian Givers, Jack Weatherford; Custer Died for Your Sins, Vine Deloria, Jr.; Genocide of the Mind, Marilo Moore, ed.; Sacred Objects and Sacred Places, Andrew Gulliford and Last Standing Woman, La Duke.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1054 Writing Beyond Our Borders: Creation and Representation in U.S. Theater (4 Credits)\n\nIn this arts workshop, students will explore the process and politics of creation and representation in U.S. theater. Through engagement with leading theater-makers and writing their own scenes, students will explore the complexities and challenges of expanding representation in theater, focusing on questions such as: What is the responsibility of a theater-maker in creating characters from identities or cultures traditionally underrepresented in U.S. theater? How do our choices as storytellers impact perceptions of individuals and groups both here and abroad? How can we empower ourselves to create without censorship, while engaging with integrity in complex, challenging dialogues around equity, diversity and inclusion in process and product? We will engage with works and visits from professional theater-makers dealing with these issues in their work, and explore the process of creating characters whose backgrounds and experiences do not match one's own (meaning most of them). Students will choose plays to read and respond to based on instructor recommendations and connections to their own work and interests. No prior writing or theater experience necessary.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1058 The Contemporary Broadway Musical: Rent to Hamilton (and Beyond) (4 Credits)\n\nLocated at the intersection of songwriting, storytelling, creativity, and commerce, the Broadway musical is one of New York City’s most significant and singular cultural artifacts. While this art form has a long and storied history, it continues to evolve dramatically in terms of aesthetics, audiences, content, and economics. In this arts workshop (open to artists, producers, and fans), we will take a look at some of the most influential shows to play the Great White Way over the last twenty-five years, with a focus on both how they are constructed and how they have impacted the field (and society). How does a musical get made? How do librettists, composers, and lyricists synthetize their visions to speak with one creative voice? How does a show like Hamilton become a worldwide phenomenon, and what keeps a hot property like Spider-Man from reaching its potential? Shows examined will include: Rent and The Lion King (shows that serve as the unofficial gateway to this new generation); Passing Strange and In the Heights (and the ground-breaking 2008 season); The Book of Mormon (and its film precursor South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut); Spider-Man; Fun Home; and yes, Hamilton. Weekly responses will include original scenes (or songs), casting breakdowns, design proposals, and other creative output, as well as some traditional essays.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1065 Performing Comedy (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis course explores the practices, principles and aesthetics of comedic performance. Questions examined include: What makes something funny? Why do audiences laugh? What is the relationship between performer and audience in comedy? How does a performer get the laugh without ‘asking’ for it? How is humor specific to certain cultures, historical periods, genders or age groups? Are any elements of humor universal? Does the nature of performing comedy change from medium to medium? The course investigates these questions through readings, lectures, discussion and experiential exercises. Students are challenged to synthesize theory, historical traditions, and practical application into viable comedic performances. Students will experiment with this synthesis through discussing, analyzing, rehearsing and performing scenes/monologues drawn from major comic traditions including: masked forms (such as Greek Old Comedy and Commedia dell’Arte), high comedy (like the comedies of Shakespeare and Moliere), low comedy (such as the slapstick of Charlie Chaplin, Mel Brooks, as well as modern sketch, improv and stand-up comedy) and that which defies easy categorization (such as Monty Python or Sacha Baron Cohen). The course will culminate in a public presentation, allowing students to share select comedic performances with an audience. Students are expected to rehearse outside of class time.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1066 Performing Objects (4 Credits)\n\nPuppets and objects used in performance collectively fall under the term \"performing objects.\" What is it about inanimate objects brought to life that has compelled storytellers across the globe for centuries? In this course we will explore the potential for movement and story in a variety of materials and objects. How might the qualities of materials and objects inform story, character or event? Throughout the course we will also consider performing objects in a variety of contexts including religious ceremony, political activism, cultural celebration and popular theater. Case studies may include Indonesian shadow plays, Japanese bunraku, Peter Schumann's Bread and Puppet Theater and Victorian English toy theaters to name a few. In each study we will examine the aesthetics of objects as well as the relationship between manipulators and objects and how these values and dynamics change depending on the context and circumstance of performance. Students will create original solo and ensemble performances.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1070 Equal Exchange: Arts Based Collb W/Immgnt Yth (4 Credits)\n\nCourse meets Mondays on-site in Brooklyn; students interested in this course should not schedule anything after 2:30 on Mondays. First 2 Monday classes are training and orientation sessions and will be held at NYU; all Wednesday classes will be held at NYU. This course looks at the intersection of art, culture and identity by bringing together NYU students and immigrant high school students to collaborate on the creation of original, inter-disciplinary performance work. Students will work on-site at the Brooklyn International High School (BIHS) which has a student body from 43 different countries. The course will focus on the development of arts-based techniques using movement, creative writing, oral history, music, and theatre to create an open dialogue in a multi-cultural setting. NYU students will learn how to transmute this dialogue into theatrical forms as we work toward final performance. Wednesday classes will be spent discussing readings and planning our work with students at BIHS. We will think and talk about how culture and identity are both influencing and influenced by the matrix of social forces operating in society. Readings will focus on the role of artists in mediating community interactions, community arts pra ctices and the use of the arts for social change. Readings may include Games for Actors and Non-Actors (Boal), Local Acts (Cohen-Cruz), essays on the Community Arts Network and We Are All Suspects Now, (Nguyen). Prior experience and interest in the performing arts, media and/or writing is helpful. Students who wish to take this course but do not have prior experience in the above should contact the instructor before registering.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1080 Site-Specific Performance: Art, Activism & Public Space (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis course looks at the development of site-specific performance with a special emphasis on projects that engage with social issues and include activist agendas. \"Site-specific\" is a term frequently associated with the visual arts but since the Happenings of the '60s and '70s, a body of work termed \"site-specific performance\" has evolved as highly structured works of art that are designed around, for or because of place and associated communities. As site artists confront the matrix of social forces, changing political policies and overlapping communities that relate to a given site, their aesthetics, creative process and goals have shifted. How are they blurring the lines between art and activism, art and urban renewal, art and real life? This arts workshop will emphasize making site work by completing a progressive series of studies, using various artistic mediums. We will also be reading about and viewing site work by seminal artists in this field. This course is recommended to adventurous students with interests and some training in at least one of the following mediums: dance, theatre, spoken word poetry, media, photography and/or visual art. Readings include texts by Maaike Bleeker; Jan Cohen Cruz; Bertie Ferdman, among others.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1090 Participatory Performance: Artists, Audiences and Civic Engagement (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nBeginning from the premise that by its nature theater is inherently participatory, this arts workshop explores a wide spectrum of participatory/interactive performance with an emphasis on contemporary practices and their potential for civic engagement. Specific attention will be given to the relationships between artist, event and spectator-participant as well as forms of interactivity and the spectrum of engagement they provide. What does it mean to participate? How does participatory performance affect the role and process of the writer, director, designer, performer, and audience member? Who is in the audience? What are the ethical concerns of these evolving and increasingly popular practices? Throughout the course students will engage as creators as well as audience-participants as we examine these relationships and questions. We will investigate the work of artists and companies using participatory forms to explore such concepts as democracy, citizenship, and systems of privilege including Aaron Landsman (City Council Meeting), Dread Scott (Dread Scott: Decision), dog & pony dc, Epic Theatre Ensemble and others. The course will also address the issues raised by working cross-culturally and frameworks for artists to consider the political and philosophical implications of making work in, with, about and for diverse communities. Theoretical texts may include readings by Claire Bishop, Nicolas Bourriaud, Augusto Boal and others based on student research interests. The course culminates in an in-class sharing of short participatory performances-in-progress created by students individually or in groups based on intersections with their own research and practices.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1105 Awareness in Action: Listening to the Body (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nAwareness is the key to making changes in our body and mind. In this class we will be listening to the communication from our bodies and honoring our body’s wisdom. Our body constantly communicates important information that when we listen we can make profound changes in both our body and consciousness. Body educator Elaine Summers states, “As you learn to concentrate and listen to all your voices, not only your physical one, but the creative consciousness and the psyche as well, you gain the power to use all your innate abilities.” This experiential workshop uses the methods of The Alexander Technique, The Feldenkrais Method, Kinetic Awareness and its predecessors to increase awareness in the body/mind. The developers of these methods recognize that by using focused attention to sense the body in motion and at rest muscular tension and poor body habits can be released. These techniques are valuable for anyone who wants to gain more freedom of expression, range of motion, comfort, concentration and presence in their work, art and daily lives. The course is designed for the student who is ready to commit to the in-depth process of investigation that is required. Essays and final project will reflect personal interest and include class readings. Readings include Mirka Knaster’s The Knowing Body, Bone, Breath and Gesture Practices of Embodiment, Don H. Johnson and selected readings.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1106 The Knowing Body: Awareness Techniques for Performers (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nBody awareness, by listening to the body's communication with mindful attention, increases one's ability to strip away any physical and mental interference which can impair performance. Interference often appears as stiff, held muscles, poor body habits and interrupted concentration. You will learn somatic or body awareness methods which are vital to the creative process and honor inner wisdom. Performance is viewed in terms of posture, breath, tension/effort, energy/presence, concentration, body behaviors/habits and mind/body integration. You must be prepared to perform a solo piece of your choosing (or a activity to be observed) by the third week of class and work on it throughout the semester. Kinetic Awareness, The Alexander Technique, meditation, visualization and Eastern energy systems are learned and applied to your performance work. Open to performing arts students who wish to deepen their relationship to their bodies and draw on inner reserves. Readings include Knaster's Discovering the Body's Wisdom, Steinman's The Knowing Body, Crow's The Alexander Technique as a Basic approach to Theatrical Training.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1107 Body Wisdom: Anatomy through Experience (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nWe are all body users. Whether we are texting a friend on our iphone, running a marathon, playing in a band or acting in a play, we need to understand the body’s full capacity. Enhanced body or kinesthetic awareness of our muscles and bones allows us to move and perform with more confidence, safety and expression. But how do we gain the most efficient use? In this body awareness class we will explore muscles and bones in movement and at rest, the use of tension, learn about respiration and its importance to function, and study the nervous system and stress response. Using the body awareness method, Kinetic Awareness you will investigate your own body with focused attention, movement and touch. You will integrate kinesthetic experience with factual and visual information. Class is divided between experience and lecture. Olsen’s Body Stories: A Guide to Experiential Anatomy and Irene Dowd’s Taking Root to Fly: Articles on Functional Anatomy are required texts along with selections from Dimon’s Anatomy of the Moving Body and The Anatomy Coloring Book.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1110 The Art of Play (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nWe know that for children play is more than just fun; it is the work through which they develop. But what about when adults play? Through play we find our freedom, spontaneity, and our aesthetic. What is there in human beings that enables us to play? Why is play considered an innate capacity of people from the beginning of recorded history? What qualifies as play? When does play become art? In this course, everyone plays and in doing so examines the historic and contemporary uses of play as a potentially universal impulse of humans, across generations, time and space. Play’s capacity to create and sustain community will be considered. We will examine play as it is reflected through theories of child development, dramatic improvisation, fine art, politics, social construction and identities, music, religion and spirituality, literature and social media. Students will examine the necessity of play in their own child and adult lives—the creative spirit, the adventurer, the empathic connection with humanity, and laughter, too. Books may include: Nachmanovitch’s Free Play, Bettelheim’s The Uses of Enchantment, Huizinga’s Homo Ludens, and selected readings from Lorca, Nietzche, Piaget, Postman, Solomon.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1115 Creative Arts Therapies: Supporting and Transforming Communities through the Arts (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis arts workshop is a survey course in the creative arts therapies with particular focus on dance, music, art and drama therapy. The workshop provides a strong introduction to the theory and practice of the creative arts therapies. We consider applications of the creative arts therapies across the lifespan and different clinical populations and as clinical intervention to promote social justice. \"The course is taught by a working clinician and includes lectures from other working creative arts therapists. For students interested in pursuing a graduate degree in the creative arts therapies and for artists interested in applied arts and community-engaged arts practice.

As movement artists/scholars, we will investigate questions invigorating contemporary experimental dance/performance, body/mind integration, and embodied knowledge. This workshop, reconfigured to acknowledge the particular experiences of art-making in today’s complex circumstances, assumes a double notion of the “everyday”: exploring the pedestrian actions/sounds/words of our “real lives” and recognizing them as art material; and creating Daily Dance (Music, etc.), committing to working (almost) every day, locating and developing our individual movement/sound/technical vocabularies, creating work from our experiments and experiences. Guided by improvisation, we will search for what feels authentic and consider what authenticity involves or implies. We will explore what is “natural” about our materials and examine their conscious/unconscious cultural underpinnings. We will make scores, studies, and interarts performances alone and with witnesses and collaborators/participants. Studio practice will be supported by critical, reflective, and historical writings from the arts, autobiography, creativity theory, philosophy, technology. Sources may include John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Miguel Gutierrez, Anna Halprin, Laurence Halprin, Ben Highmore, Allan Kaprow, Carl Lavery, Linda Montano, Haruki Murakami, Bruce Nauman, Georges Perec, Yvonne Rainer, Susan Rethorst, M.C. Richards, Anne Truitt, Marcia Tucker.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1207 Post Modern Dance: Turning Dance Upside Down (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn this workshop, we depart from traditional dance composition courses by focusing on the concepts, strategies, and actions that occupy contemporary experimental choreographers. We spend most of our time in the studio, moving through physical warm-ups structured to prepare ourselves for developing dance material informed by live performances, videos, guest appearances, and readings by and about dance-makers, from the first post-modernists of the1960s through those continuing their lineage and those exploring completely different paths. We consider dance as an element of interarts performance; work joining dance and technology; dance-making as social activism and an opportunity to explore worldly and sociocultural phenomena; site-specific choreography; and improvisation as both an autonomous movement practice and a way to generate movement for choreography. We borrow, of course, from what students bring to the workshop: their individual dance histories as well as their interests and desires. Readings may include essays by Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Ralph Lemon, Simone Forti, Jonathan Burrows, Miguel Gutierrez, André Lepecki, Allan Kaprow, Thomas DeFrantz, Will Rawls, and Nancy Stark Smith.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1208 Making Dances in The 21St Century (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nDance composition is, simply, the process through which an artist selects and organizes movements. Less simply, it encompasses not only the interaction with other art forms but the expression of and resistance to cherished, or at least familiar, personal and cultural beliefs about how the body makes meaning. What is ?the body?? What are the relationships of our movements, our experiences, our philosophies, our aesthetic frameworks and choices? In this workshop, we will grapple with these questions in the archive and the studio. We?ll read works by and about twentieth? and twenty-first?century choreographers and make dances that take off from their concepts, strategies, and actions. We?ll welcome students? explorations of principles outside Western concert tradition; we?ll welcome however they wish to move, however they wish to move us. Readings may include essays by Lawrence Halprin, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Yvonne Rainer, Robert Dunn, Elena Alexander, and others.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1209 The Art of Choreography (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIt was the modern dance choreographer Martha Graham who said, “We are all born with genius. It’s just that most people lose it in the first five minutes.” This class helps the student get back his or her original choreographic ability. We will study the elements of dance—time, space and energy—and, each week, explore a different aspect of the choreographic process. The students, through improvisations and short movement studies, will discover their movement vocabulary. Each dancemaker will find their own individual choreographic voice while being introduced to some of the major twentieth century choreographers. By nature we are all dancers, with or without years of training. Choreographic process, whether one wishes to be a choreographer or not, is a superb model for thinking, assembling and creating. A digital media component teaches students to incorporate video into their work. The final performance is in a theatrical setting with lights, simple costume and possibly video. Readings will include What is Dance? by Roger Copeland and Marshall Cohen (eds.), The Art of Making Dances by Doris Humphrey, The Intimate Act of Choreography by Blom and Chaplin, and Space Harmony by Rudolph Laban. To view a clip of the final performance from last year, visit YouTube, The Art of Choreography.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1210 Scores and Structures for Dance and Performance: Making the Process Visible (4 Credits)\n\nThis workshop offers students of all levels options for creating performances using compositional scores: maps, blueprints, games, and other structures which typically focus the artist on the creative process and produce art reflecting its (experimental) origins. This approach has a rich history: Dadaists and Surrealists of the early 20th century and practitioners of visual, literary, and performing arts since the early 1960s have developed strategies challenging Western art-making traditions, focusing on compositional structure and its relationship to how a piece makes meaning. In this workshop, we will explore and activate some of these strategies and processes to make performances, moving from ideas through actions, using scores variously leading to pre-determined or unpredictable material. We will experiment with models for building scores and structures including chance operations, indeterminacy, improvisation, and works derived from images, objects, intuition, and memory. We will view live and recorded performances; we will support our studio practice with critical, theoretical, reflective, and historical readings by artists and scholars across artistic and academic disciplines. Sources may include John Cage, Yvonne Rainer, Merce Cunningham, Sally Banes, Richard Kostelanetz, Lawrence Halprin, Allan Kaprow, Steve Paxton, Joan Jonas, Simone Forti, Raymond Queneau, and Georges Perec.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1211 Making Dance: Space, Place and Technology (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn this workshop, students will explore the possibilities of dancing across spatial categories, making dances in \"real\" and digital space. Taking our cues from contemporary experimental and primarily post-modern choreographers, we will examine how our arts practices and beliefs about bodies and space are linked to evolving ideas and cultural systems; we will ask questions that tug at the assumptions of what dance is, what bodies are, what space is, and how these elements are significant as components of choreography and of our dance experiences. We will make and watch dances ranging from low-tech works to high-tech experiments. In addition to making dances, we will read about contemporary dance, technology, and other practices and disciplines (e.g., architecture, philosophy, neuroscience), view performances of choreographers and visual artists, and meet with practitioners engaged in the questions and practices of our study. We will join with CultureHub, an organization housed at La MaMa E.T.C. (one of New York’s most noted experimental theaters) and working at the intersection of art, technology, and community. Readings might include work by Gaston Bachelard, Victoria Hunter, Matthew Frederick, Merce Cunningham, Steve Paxton, Andrew Gurian, Yi-Fu Tuan, and other artists and scholars. The course is open to all students: anyone interested in dance and/or technology is welcome. Note: all workshop members will be expected to participate as movers!\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1212 World Dance and Global Perspectives (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nDance reflects cultural heritage and is a key to understanding diverse societies. In this arts workshop, students explore dance as it appears on several continents. Dance can be seen as encoded forms of a society's religious, artistic, political, economic, and familial values. Readings cover issues of globalization, fusion and authenticity. Migration, missionaries, trade routes and the diaspora have led to the creation of new dance forms like \"Bollywood\" and \"Tribal\" that are a synthesis of earlier forms. Students are introduced to different dance forms through selected readings, rich collection of video footage and studio practice often lead by various guest artists. After a brief warm-up, the class learns simple steps, floor plans and rhythms from the music and dance cultures being studied. Students choose a dance form as their project and themselves become researchers, performers and creators of new forms.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1220 Choreography: A Field Guide for Dance (4 Credits)\n\nThis class is a guide through the works of choreographers who can teach us the elements of making dance and enable us to create our own movement identity. The psychological storytelling of Martha Graham, George Balanchine's blazing neo-classicism, the chance field dances of Merce Cunningham, Twyla Tharp's humorous inversions, the deconstructions of William Forsythe, Mathew Bourne's gay Swan Lake, and the powerful Black gospel songs of Alvin Ailey are observed through video and readings. After a warmup of technique and improvisation, the student begins with small movement studies, leading to group studies of increasing complexity, with teacher and students responding with supportive feedback. New this semester will be a section, \"Dance as Protest,\" which explores texts such as Hot Feet and Social Change: African Dance and Diaspora Communities. We will study the movie In the Heights, where Afro-Caribbean dance, ballet, contemporary and hip hop convey ideas about community and representation. Texts include The Intimate Art of Choreography and \"Dance in the Age of Black Lives Matter.\" Students can have studied dance or simply wish to move and compose using their body and imagination. Student works in a final performance in the theater will be recorded.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1221 Dancing in the Here and Now: Making Dances, Knowing Bodies (4 Credits)\n\nBoth dancing and everyday movement offer continual opportunities for embodied experience. Those who regularly dance or engage in movement practices such as yoga, jogging, cycling, and walking typically develop an appetite, even a need, for moving and the breadth of experience it brings. Whether you already feel this appetite or want to explore embodied experience for the first time, this Arts Workshop offers the opportunity for deep investigation of movement, focusing on active and contemplative exploration of bodies in space and time. We will be guided by several research strands linked to the existence and power of embodiment, noting experimental choreographer Susan Rethorst’s term, “the body’s mind”: ways of knowing (individually, culturally) through our bodies. Through many movement options, including dancing and somatic practices, walking and other everyday actions, and personal/cultural/political movement histories, we will encounter or create relationships between what we do and who we are. In the studio and elsewhere, we will consider how our lives as movers, and our sense of ourselves as embodied, bring us into contact with others—walkers, dancers, friends and family—and with our spaces, places, and sociocultural worlds. In this course (open to anyone with/without previous training), our research-in-action will be supported by interdisciplinary scholarship engaged with dance, embodiment, space, everyday culture, phenomenology, environmental studies, and life writing. Readings may include works by Thomas DeFrantz, Anna Halprin, Victoria Hunter, Einav Katan, Marcel Mauss, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Andrea Olsen, Steve Paxton, Georges Perec, Yvonne Rainer, Susan Rethorst, Kathleen Stewart, and Yi-Fu Tuan.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1225 Creating a Performance from The Ground Up: An Interarts Production Workshop (4 Credits)\n\nThis Gallatin Arts Workshop offers students the luxury of a full semester to focus on a single, collaborative performance. Students will work individually and together on creating performances—developing them from initial ideas, images, or sketches of existing material (movement, text, sound/music) through multiple perspectives and stages, including generation, conception, planning, rehearsing, responding, revising, performing, documenting. Students will work on their own projects, watch and respond to progressive drafts, and participate in fellow artists’ projects in activities from research through performance. They will then work together collaboratively to join their individual projects, creating an interarts performance. Workshop participants will be guided through conducting research in their work’s development; this research will include investigation that takes place in the studio as well as textual/archival explorations of their field, the creative process, collaboration, and the history of interarts performance. Students will be urged to understand, through individual practice, strategically designed assignments, and regular revisions of material, their own aesthetic inclinations and influences. Readings about creativity, specific arts/performance forms, and interarts performance might include work by or about Lawrence and Anna Halprin, Allan Kaprow, Sol LeWitt, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Ben Highmore, and the contributions of Fluxus, OuLiPo, and the Judson Dance Theater.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1230 Dance Theater and Performance: An Interdisciplinary Investigation (4 Credits)\n\nThe course will introduce students to the field Dance Theatre both by retracing its influences, as well as experimenting with compositional elements and creating work in class. We will start with the major performance traditions from which Dance Theatre grew: modern dance, mime, physical theatre, postmodern dance, butoh and performance art. This highly interdisciplinary studio course will benefit students in a variety of fields, among them music, design, the visual arts, scenography, as well as dance and theatre. Readings will include texts by: Eugenio Barba, Peter Brook, Michael Chekhov, Royd Climenhaga, John Martin, Rudolf Laban, Mary Wigman, Doris Humphrey, Nobert Servos, Konstantin Stanislavsky, Jerzy Grotowski, among others. Examples of artists we will discuss include Anna Sokolow, Kurt Jooss, Pina Bausch, Bill T. Jones, Anne Bogart, DV8, and Jan Fabre among others. Students will also learn, rehearse, and do informal class showings of repertory pieces.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1251 Collective Curating (4 Credits)\n\nThis course will explore curatorial theory and practice toward a collaboratively produced exhibition of contemporary painting. Tracing the changing role of the curator in assembling art and argument, our work will culminate in an exhibition installed in The Gallatin Galleries. Working with local artists toward an emergent thematic premise, we will follow and examine the steps of exhibition-making to understand their intellectual underpinnings, historical import, and political urgency. The practical tasks of mounting an exhibition will include studio visits, work lists, shipping and delivery, exhibition design and installation, graphic design, and public programming. Throughout, we will expand the possibilities of the collective teaching gallery, emphasizing the relations between theoretical and material processes in thinking with (and in) exhibitions.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1270 Excavating Titus Andronicus: Exploration and Embodiment (4 Credits)\n\nShakespeare’s Titus Andronicus is a tragedy of extreme proportions, notorious for its portrayal of ceaseless violence, death, and mutilation driven by desires for power and revenge. In this Gallatin Arts Workshop, which will culminate in a performance of several scenes of the play, students will delve into the work from multiple perspectives. These include the text itself; its literary, historical, and cultural antecedents; its contemporary implications; and, especially, the ways to animate these discoveries—and reciprocally contribute to them—through studio practice joining dance, movement, and theater. This Practice as Research offers students opportunities to explore their characters, to broaden their ideas and experiences of performance itself, to understand embodied knowledge as critical and performative, and to develop their acting skills. A collaborative Arts Workshop, Excavating Titus Andronicus will be led by Prof. Leslie Satin, dancer/choreographer and performance scholar, and by guest artists Prof. Christian Billing and Prof. Campbell Edinborough, theater and performance artists and scholars from the University of Hull in England, with visits to the class from Gallatin scholars and practitioners in theater and literature. Readings will include Titus Andronicus, excerpts of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, critical literature on these texts, and literature on dance, performance, space, and embodiment.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1275 Delicious Movement: Time Is Not Even, Space Is Not Empty (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nTaught by NYC-based movement-based, interdisciplinary artist Eiko Otake, this course contemplates metaphorical nakedness and human and bodily experiences of time and space. Through movement study, reading, writing, and discussion the class will be a place of both collective and individual learning. Students will examine how being or becoming a mover reflects and alters each person's relationships with challenges of the current world, with history, and with other beings. Topics of study include atomic bomb literature and Fukushima nuclear disaster. We will acknowledge how distance is malleable and how going to places is an act of choreography and self-curation. Questions we will explore include: How do various art works deal with witnessing and archiving history? How does art help humans to survive massive violence and understand other people's experiences? How does art-making help people to deal with historical and personal trauma? How does honing one's aesthetic contribute to constructing own thoughts and critical views? Reading, movement reviews and journal entries are required every week. Journals are graded by how they reflect homework assignments. Students will work on final projects, which would complement the syllabus. The instructor is available for individual consultation throughout the course. Students are strongly encouraged to nurture their own rigor. No previous dance training or movement study is necessary to take this course.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1305 Contemporary Music Performance I (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis course is designed to help students develop a better understanding of music by presenting the opportunity to experience music as a musician. Students learn basic music theory, develop rudimentary musicianship skills, and use that experience to compose, rehearse and perform original compositions in a wide range of pop and jazz idioms. Students work in small groups to develop both individual and group-composed pieces. These pieces are composed and performed live as well as utilizing digital audio workstation software. The course culminates with a semester-end recital of works written and performed by students.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1306 Contemporary Music Performance II (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nAlthough this course is designed as a continuation of Contemporary Music Performance I, it is open to any student with a rudimentary music background. The course focus is on helping students further develop their skills and understanding of popular music by having the opportunity to experience music as a musician. Students brush up on basic music theory, musicianship skills, and write, rehearse, and perform original ensemble pieces on a weekly basis. The goal is for each student to be able to gain valuable experience as a composer and performer of contemporary music in a wide range of pop and jazz idioms. Within a coordinated remote setting, students will have the opportunity to work in small groups to develop both individual and group composed pieces. The course culminates with a professionally produced online video presentation of works written and performed by students.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1316 Playing Jazz (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis workshop is designed for student musicians with the knowledge and skills of basic musicianship who want to learn to play jazz or extend their present ability to play jazz. Students learn the fundamentals of improvisation: scale and chord structures, modes, chord progressions, rhythmic applications, song forms and options for organizing an improvisation such as creating a melody out of melodic fragments, scale fragments, and sequences. We listen to great jazz performers to hear examples of good improvisation, proper phrasing and jazz styles. Students attending the workshop gain a working musical vocabulary in the language of mainstream jazz. This workshop offers students a solid starting point, whether they want to play professionally, for personal enjoyment or simply to broaden their knowledge of what it takes to play jazz.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1320 Creating Music, Composing Worlds (4 Credits)\n\n\" Any great work of art \" revives and readapts time and space, and the measure of its success is the extent to which it makes you an inhabitant of that world \"\" Leonard Bernstein. \"This class will explore the connection between the history of ideas and composing music. Through the use of digital tools for music creation, students will explore the interplay between music, and other arts including but not limited to: painting, writing, poetry, as well as sciences, math, and history. The class will explore music as a form of thought, as a technical practice, as language and as art. We will examine music from diverse eras and styles such as Gregorian chant, electronic dance music, minimalism, twelve-tone, rap, rock and hip-hop. \"Students will compose musical responses to selected readings that demonstrate how experiences gained in one area can be useful to another. This class will also provide students with a foundation in music theory, music production, notation and composition. \"Selected readings in the class will include Music, Beauty & the Brain (Part 2): The Golden Mean in Music, American Mathematical Society, Silence , John Cage, Visual and Acoustic Space , Marshall McLuhan, Ambient Music , Brian Eno, The Theory and Practice of Electronic Music , Miller Puckette, Poetics of Music in the Form of Six Lessons , Igor Stravinsky, Rap, Minimalism and Structures of Time in Late Twentieth-Century Culture , Susan McClary, The Sound Studies Reader , Jonathan Sterne.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1325 Songwriting (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nSong is the oldest musical form established in all eras and cultures. Ancient Greek and African musicians used song for recreation, to preserve communal memory and to link the visible world with the invisible. Music making was rooted in mythology, legends and folklore and was associated with gods, ancestors and heroes. The musician, through his/her technique, had to be able to combine sounds and images through the use of voice, gesture, dance, and instruments to form a musical reminiscence. In this workshop, songwriting will be explored as both a musical and cultural practice. Each student will develop songwriting techniques through the study of historical, cultural and musical aspects of songwriting.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1326 Music Creation and Sound Practice (4 Credits)\n\nEdgard Varèse called his music “organized sound.” John Cage composed silence. Charles Mingus gave a concert featuring the children of his band mates playing instruments they didn’t know behind a curtain to mock the avant-garde noises of free jazz. Is all sound music? (Are sound and music synonymous?) This course is an introduction to music creation and performance, not bound by genre or method, designed for several types of student: those who have studied music, self-taught self-directed musicians, and artists from other fields who want to understand music from the inside. Music will be presented as an inherently interdisciplinary field, medium, and practice, as we investigate contemporary and historical ideas about the relationship of sound to music. Students will experience different ways to conceive of sound through a hands-on exploration of the fundamentals of music making, including aural training, tonal theory, the digital audio workstation, and sound theory. Readings include selections from Tara Rodgers’ “Pink Noises,” Kodwo Eshun’s, “More Brilliant than the Sun: Adventures in Sonic Fiction,” John Cage’s “Silence: Lectures and Writings,” and Pierre Schaefer’s “In Search of a Concrete Music.” Coursework includes short written and/or oral responses, and the creation of several short musical response pieces. The final project is the creation and presentation of a new work and a written Statement that describes the intent and methods behind it.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1340 Beyond Syntax: Exploring Words and Music (4 Credits)\n\nHow can we integrate words and music to resonates in a deeper way? How do we make our songs more lyrically alive and our words more singable? In this course we will investigate a structural approach to a “whole language” strategy for creating text/music pieces. ­Beginning with written material generated from in-class writing prompts, students will learn to decode words as sounds and turn them into music by looking at hard and soft stresses, notating phrases and pauses musically (and phonologically) and attaching pitches. The process of underscoring poems and stories will also be investigated, giving attention to the magical way music can heighten mood and affect the meanings of words. No formal musical training is required for this course but musicians who love words and writers who love music are welcome. Readings will include essays by poets Denise Levertov, Robert Pinsky, Robert Haas, James Fenton and essays in the semiotics of music. My own work (archived in NYU’s Fales Library), which explores a range of these strategies with my band The Jazz Passengers and singers Elvis Costello, Mavis Staples and Debbie Harry will also be discussed.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1341 Creating a Full-Length Text/Music Performance and Recording (4 Credits)\n\nIn this course, students will explore the complexities of traditional and non-traditional \"song\" form. They will decode words as sounds, underscore poems and stories, use improvisation structures in games to generate musical and/or lyric material, and work with collage recording influenced by sampler use. Through collaborative processes, students will use their unified text/music language to create a full length performance or recording. Each student will produce either a complete (20 minutes or more) performance, record an EP, create an installation piece that involves text and music, or develop a new mixed form. New source material will come from in-class writing prompts and various improvisation games. Readings by or about modern performers including Meredith Monk, John Zorn, Kendrick Lamar and The Art Ensemble of Chicago will provide models for various strategies. \"We will also engage with books about the recording process from the 331/3 series. Theoretical investigations will also include works by Rita Aiello, Jenefer Robinson, John Cage, and George Lewis. It is suggested that students have completed ARTS-UG 1340.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1345 Music Improvisation: Concepts and Practice (4 Credits)\n\nThis course guides undergraduate students through fundamentals strategies of music improvisation. Our goal is to apply these methods to various and diverse formal structures, musical styles, performance settings, sonic environments, and collaborative formats. It is open to students with a proficient level of experience singing and/or playing an instrument (producers and computer musicians interested and capable in live performance are welcome) and will best serve students who have experimented with or seek to further use music improvisation as a fundamental part of their creative approach. \" For the theoretical part of the course, students will learn about improvisation through critical literature, exploring its multiple conceptual, historical, and \"cultural contexts. For the practice part, students will be guided through creating, rehearsing, and collectively performing original music. The course will culminate in an informal, public final performance of students' original music.

We will ask what it has meant politically and socially, and we will explore what it has meant on the edges of and outside of Western traditions. \"Music will include pieces by composers such as Monteverdi, Gabrielli, Mozart, Haydn, Strauss, Ives, and John Cage. Topics for discussion will include thinking about chamber music through the lens of aesthetics, Marxism, feminism, postcolonialism, and postmodernism. Readings will be historical and critical and may include works by Kofi Agawu, Eduard Hanslick, Susan McClary, Theodor Adorno, Joseph Kerman, Lawrence Kramer, Leo Treitler and others. This class will offer a low pressure and supportive environment in which to rehearse and work together on pieces of music using small groups of musicians. The class may also attend a concert or visit instrument or music manuscript collections at area museums.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1375 Microphone Fiends: Hip Hop and Spoken Word (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nFrom Gil Scott-Heron, Sonia Sanchez and the Last Poets to Slick Rick, Queen Latifah and Public Enemy.

Workshop verse for the page and the stage. Research, write, record, produce and perform original work and the verse of inspiring underground wordsmiths, while critically examining texts by and about legends from the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Arts Movement and the Hip Hop Generation we are shaping here and now.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1380 Woodstock at 50 (4 Credits)\n\nThis course is an examination of the ways in which the Woodstock festival became an enduring legend and how today’s festivals like Coachella, Bonnaroo and Burning Man compare. In August of 1969, against the backdrop of the Vietnam War and Civil Rights Movement, a half-million young music lovers and rock musicians made history together on an upstate New York dairy farm. In this course, music journalist Rona Elliot, a member of the Woodstock production team, and journalist/educator Karen Curry, will explore the many faces of Woodstock. How did a festival that was fraught with logistical challenges become a measure for festivals moving forward? What effect did it have on commercialization and monetization within the music industry? How did it influence the music industry, music journalism, fashion, lifestyle, etc.? What systems of privilege made a festival of its kind possible? What values of 60s countercultures did it embrace? The three-week course will consist of lectures, screenings, guest speakers and readings, including books by festival creator Michael Lang and music journalist Ben Fong-Torres. It will examine how Woodstock affected the careers of artists like Carlos Santana, Joe Cocker, Crosby Stills Nash and Young, Joan Baez, Richie Havens, and Jimi Hendrix. Students will hear from several key players who created the festival, members of the staff and, some of the musicians who graced that legendary stage. The final may take various forms depending on the concentration and skills of the students. It might be a fifteen-page paper or a short video, podcast, photo essay or other multimedia presentation developing one of the ideas raised in the course.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1405 Drawing and Painting (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis workshop is designed to provide both beginning and advanced students with studio experience in drawing and painting. A variety of media will be used, including acrylic paint. The problem of visual conversion will be addressed as will the distinction between “what is seen and what is known” (Picasso). In addition, by way of critiques, discussions and gallery visits, the student will explore the problem of visual “form” and aesthetic judgment. Selected works produced during the semester will be shown in the Gallatin arts studio on the 4th floor of 1 Washington Place.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1406 Drawing in the Expanded Field (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nDrawing has long been considered a foundational element in the study of art. In the 20th century, drawing has also become a medium that exists front and center in the practice of many contemporary artists. While previously it was understood as a preparatory tool, now it is seen as a final destination. The very question of what constitutes drawing has been redefined by artists who have pushed the bounds of the term. This course will consider activities in our everyday life that touch on aspects of drawing (writing, diagrammatic language, notation, mapping). We will also think about the ways drawing has been taught traditionally, and to consider what associations the medium carries today from this history. The question of what constitutes drawing will be approached through process and concept much more than as defined by medium, and the course focuses on an expanded, experimental approach to drawing. Assignments will often be a response to a wide variety of artistic mediums where there exist resonant relationships (dance, installation, land art, architecture, sculpture, and performance, among others). Students will work in conventional drawing media (pencil, paper, eraser, ink) but will also explore how other media can expand the idea of what \"drawing\" might mean. Although this is a studio course, there is a rigorous reading/research component as well. Texts are assigned for discussion regularly and students will do individual presentations to the class based on focused research topics.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1407 Introduction to Painting I (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nBasic technical and conceptual principles of painting through in-the-studio practice. The relationship between form and content (technique and concept) is informed by art history and theory. Therefore, such processes as palette orientation, paint manipulation, and canvas preparation are determined by their appropriate use according to chosen time.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1408 Drawing: Body and Narrative (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThe aim of this course is to examine and challenge representations of the body and how the body is used in constructing narratives through the medium of drawing. Students who are interested in making art that either tells stories or works against the narrative form, will have the opportunity to develop their ideas and skills in a challenging studio class. In addition to rigorous projects and reading assignments, we will look at and discuss the work of artists such as William Kentridge, David Shrigley, Charles Gaines, Charles White, Kara Walker, Robin Rhode, Ida Applebroog, Raymond Pettibon, and Kathe Kollwitz. In this course, students will work on both proposed projects and in-class drawing workshops dedicated to life drawing, using a variety of wet and dry media on various surfaces. In exploring the relation between bodies and narrative, we will ask: what is the relation between mimesis and narrative, and how is the narrative form used to produce history? Is it possible to create artwork outside of narrative? What is the role of a ‘narrator’ in the visual arts and how can this role be complicated? What are we to make of the ways that the revealing of one narrative may obscure others? Readings include essays by Michel Foucault, Fredric Jameson, Hayden White, Kara Walker, Jeff Wall, and William Kentridge.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1409 Painting II for Non-Majors (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn this workshop, students expand the skills and techniques initiated in Introduction to Painting. This course will focus on portraiture and realism, with emphasis on representation and the effects of the human figure in various settings and narratives. Additionally, contemporary ideas and practices will be incorporated into the class along with group and individual critiques.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1410 Outdoor Painting and Drawing (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nBy combining drawing and painting outdoors, in a variety of sites around New York, with the study of art making theory in the studio, this course provides a firm base not only for making art, but for understanding complex art movements like cubism, abstract expressionism and pop art, among others. The use of several sites within New York City as the subject matter for our creative work outdoors and in the studio provides us with significant options to produce unmatched, highly original and inventive imagery by converting sources into pictorial elements. Use of particular visual art media outdoors facilitates convenient, rapid use of sources. Other art materials are more suitable for work in the art studio. The most important component of art making, how sources can trigger conversion into visual art form, is an intrinsic part of this course.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1411 Expanding Drawing Between Head and Hand (4 Credits)\n\nThis course introduces drawing, the articulation of space and objects with a dual emphasis on \"observational study and alternative interpretations, uses and functions of drawing. Some of the \"alternative modes of drawing students will explore are, and drawing with ideas, drawing with \" the body, with text, with a stylus, with equations that can be plotted or drawn beyond both the \"frame of a sheet of paper and the physical reach of the artist. The course will address foundational visual literacy, pictorial syntax and fundamental technical and conceptual \"problems, while introducing strategies toward the decomposition of images and perspective \"through traditional and nontraditional observational drawing.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1415 Advanced Drawing (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThe class will focus on advanced techniques in drawing. Through workshops and individual assignments, students will be able to build upon their skills in the technical aspects of drawing, such as line, gesture, tone, etc.; develop conceptual strategies and learning how to revise and improve on their ideas; study, looking at, and discussing the work of established artists to gain an understanding of the contemporary world of creativity in the visual realm and to place their own ideas in a context; and speaking about and responding to (or critiquing) each other’s work. Responding to and raising questions and concerns in a productive manner about whatever topic we tackle. In addition, there will be reading assignments throughout the term.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1420 Rites of Passage into Contemporary Art Practice (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nModern art has been a balancing act between control and letting go. This course focuses on the psychological interface between the two, the “liminal” zone. We will survey modern artists’ techniques for tapping sources of creativity, including Dada collagists’ free-associations; Surrealists’ automatic writing, doodles, and “cadavres exquises”; and Abstract Expressionists’ embrace of chaos. We will engage in simple exercises: doodling, speed drawing, painting an abstract mural as a group, keeping a liminal journal, collaging, and exploring ritualistic techniques. We will follow up with discussions, take a trip to the Met to dialogue with an African oracle sculpture,and conclude the course reexamining modern art in light of the inner journey threshold drama each of us has taken during the course. Readings include van Gennep's Rites of Passage, Chipp's Theories of Modern Art, R.D. Laing, Federico Garcia Lorca on duende, Victor Turner on liminal, Mircea Eliade on Shamanism Techniques of Ecstasy, James Elkins on alchemy and art, and Frida Kahlo's journal.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1425 Discovering Manhattan: Drawing and Painting in the Spirit of the Modern Art Pioneers (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThis workshop explores images of New York City as envisioned by various schools of modern art, including Ashcan, Bauhaus, Futurist, Dadaist, Pop, and High Tech, and by the artists of the modern period, including Sloan, Mondrian, Hopper, Marin, Brancusi, O'Keefe, Duchamp, Grooms, and Koons. While foraging in galleries, students create their own art works riffing on the masters; sketching in Times Square with the garrulous attitude of Reginald Marsh; drawing a skyscraper in an ecstatic John Marin breath; creating a Dadaist collage by rifling through bins with Arman and Duchamp. The workshop concludes with a collaborative mural project and a final paper analyzing various strategies of expression whereby modern artists discovered the meaning of Manhattan. Through a process of appropriation, imitation, and parody, students are thus encouraged to re-enact the process of \"discovering Manhattan,\" to engage in a dialogue with the city, and thereby to discover their own artistic voices. Readings include E.B. White's ineffable Here is New York , Al Ginsberg's outrageous \"Howl,\" Robert Henri's Art Spirit , as well as excerpts from Natalie Edgar's \" The Club (who met at the Cedar Tavern on 13th and University) anchored by Federico Garcia Lorca's Surrealist \"Duende\" from his \"Poeta en Nueva York\" lecture.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1431 Of Fire and Blood: Art-making, Culture and Mythology in Mexico (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nA rich landscape of art and culture flourished in Mexico for thousands of years beginning with the Olmec civilization at around the second millennium before Christ. With the arrival of the Spaniards in 1519, a new hybrid culture resulted from the fusion of Iberian and Native American cultures. This Arts Workshop will examine the art, culture and mythology of Mesoamerica, combining it with hands on art making. It will move chronologically in the following manner: the Olmec culture; Teotihuacan, or the City of the Gods; the Toltecs of Tula, and Quetzalcoatl the “Feathered Serpent”; the hyper-religiosity of the Aztecs; and, lastly we will read almost the entire text of the Popol Vuh, the Mayan creation myth of the universe, a highly visual and almost hallucinatory document once pushed underground for centuries. Topics throughout the course will include: astrology/astronomy and calendrical dating; religion, shamanism, and ecstatic experience; mythology, and cosmological belief; human sacrifice, and finally beliefs dedicated to vampirism. It is beneficial that students have a cursory understanding of art making. Techniques such as collage, 3-D model making, drawing and painting, will be utilized as well as working from a live model. A final exhibition will be created to show students work to the NYU community.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1432 The Mexican Muralists and Their Indigenous Influences, and the American Artists They Influence (4 Credits)\n\nThis art workshop will focus primarily on the three major muralists, Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siquieros, and examine the influences that informed their work such as the indigenous cultures of the Aztecs and the Mayans, folk artists such Guadalupe Posada and his depiction of human skeletons in quotidian settings, art movements such as Surrealism and Dadaism, and radical political movements at home and abroad. We will also discus how their work directly impacted American artists they influenced and who later went on to become seminal artists themselves such as Jackson Pollack, Robert Motherwell, Philip Guston, and Georgia O'Keeffe. Important questions will be considered such as: how do economic imbalances and radical politics shape the way one creates art? How does race and racism determine the way we view art and the makers of art?\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1435 Artists' Books (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nAs an alternative to the politics and limitations of studio practices, artists’ books since William Blake’s Songs of Innocence and of Experience have allowed artists to experiment with conceptual ideas, visual and literary materials, as well as production practices. This course will begin with the precedent that Blake set, and investigate the numerous manifestations of the artist’s book. Course material will consider exhibitions and special libraries, and will look at the work of artists and collectives such as Ed Rucha, Cobra, Guy Debord, Fluxus, and Andy Warhol, to name a few. In responding to this material, students will also work on a final project and produce their own artist’s book.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1437 Fashion as Art: Contemporary Collaborations (4 Credits)\n\nPresently, the distinctions between fashion and art have begun to fray, revealing a dynamic cultural nexus that has propelled new concepts, processes, materials and modes of presentation. Artists, designers, curators and critics alike recognize the wide-ranging appeal of locating fashion within Fine Art and vice versa. This malleable exchange between the two mediums is illuminated in landmark exhibitions like Alexander McQueen's Savage Beauty and in the profusion of artist to brand collaborations that continue to transform the fashion world. In this arts workshop, students will have the opportunity to explore fashion as art through a range of material investigations. Questions that the course will engage include: how has the confluence of fashion and Fine Art both challenged and enriched the cultural significance of dress, shifting the industries course and altering the way the world sees value, gender and even identity? \"Additionally, how can merging these mediums expand and enhance one's own studio practice? Students can choose from a variety of mediums, including, but not limited to: illustration, painting, collage, textile design, sculpture, photography and performance. This course is open to students of all artistic backgrounds with an interest in expanding their experiences in visual culture and the visual arts.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1440 Technology Art and Public Space (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nThe course explores the emergence of Social Practice Art and the role of Interactive Communications Technologies (ICTs) in artistic contributions to political dialogue and community building. Students will create a large scale, collaborative public artwork in New York City (most likely digital projections) using mapping and social media technologies. Students will learn about artwork and artists who engage social issues and communities through their practice to create civic dialogue. With case studies, readings, and discussions, the course will focus on the interaction between the public and the artist; the use of aesthetics to convey cultural and political values; and Social Art Practice Art tactics, such as collaboration, antagonism, and activism. The course will examine historical antecedents, including notions of The Citizen Artist, as well as public art, street art, and community arts movements; and the transformational role that ICTs have played in enabling socially-oriented artworks beginning in the 1930’s. Readings for the course include: Rosalyn Deutsche, Evictions: Art and Spatial Politics; Dolores Hayden, The Power of Place; Malcolm Miles, Art, Space, and the City; Nato Thompson, Seeing Power: Art and Activism in the 21st Century; and Cameron Cartiere, The Everyday Practice of Public Art: Art, Space, and Social Inclusion.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Gallatin Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nARTS-UG 1444 Arts of Intervention: Social Practices in Public Spaces (4 Credits)\n\nThe worlds of art and political activism each have highly developed theories and practices that engage audiences in critical dialogue through acts of intervention in public spaces, including virtual \"public\" spaces, where political ideology is both produced and enacted. Within the field of art such practices have increasingly been put into the genre-category of \"social practice,\" whereas within the field of political activism it is often referred to as \"artistic activism.\" In this course, we will explore the historical and theoretical roots of both, and you will develop work that falls within either, or both, of these categories. We will investigate a variety of social forms that can be utilized as containers for your ideas, and consider how the idea of public space has evolved over time, up to and including considerations of virtual public space. We will research and produce projects about complex social sites of power such as The Classroom, Th"
