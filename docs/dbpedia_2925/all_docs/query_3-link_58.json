        "text": "Yes, they certainly are! Dental implants are prosthetic tooth roots that Dr. Felton places in your jaw.\n\nAfter a period of healing, implants secure several types of replacement teeth, including single crowns, a bridge of several new teeth, dentures, and fixed arches of teeth using the All-on-4® procedure.\n\nAll of these options will make biting and chewing much easier, give you back an attractive smile, and even help your jawbone remain strong and healthy. We’ll be happy to discuss all your implant options at your initial consultation.\n\nYes! Felton Dentistry would like to be your one-family dentist office serving every member of your crew. For over 35 years, Dr. Felton has helped Richmond area patients maintain bright smiles and optimal oral health.\n\nWhether your little one needs their first dental visit ever, your teen’s teeth need straightening with Invisalign, or you would like to have restorative dental work – we can do it all.\n\nPatients love our variety of cosmetic dental treatments. We provide many ways for you to achieve a beautiful new smile and more confidence. Our services include dental veneers, Invisalign®, teeth whitening, cosmetic bonding, tooth contouring, and crown lengthening.\n\nDepending on your specific needs and goals, any of these treatments can be used by themselves, or we can design a custom smile makeover with a combination of treatments.\n\nThe best defense against cavities is a daily dental hygiene routine. You’ll want to spend about 2- 3 minutes brushing, and we highly recommend an electric toothbrush that can get to those hard-to-reach places a regular toothbrush can’t. Flossing once a day is critical to removing bacteria between your teeth.\n\nYour diet can also play a role in whether you get a cavity. Watch the amount of sugar you eat. Sugar can be found not only in candy, but in fruits, crackers, and chips as well. Be sure to brush your teeth thoroughly after eating sugary or sticky foods like peanut butter.\n\nPeriodontal or gum disease is inflammation and infection of the gums and supporting bone. It’s important to treat gum disease because left unchecked, it can cause permanent damage to your jawbone and possible tooth loss.\n\nIt’s possible to prevent or stop periodontal disease through regular visits and recommended treatment plans. Once in advanced stages, surgery may be required.\n\nIf you’re experiencing some of the following symptoms, we’d encourage you to set up an appointment with our office for an exam, so that we can start treating you before it gets worse:\n\nMany people don’t go to the dentist regularly for a number of reasons. It could be they don’t have dental insurance, or they have a fear of the dentist, or they don’t see anything wrong with their teeth and therefore, don’t see a need to go.\n\nWhile this might seem to be saving them money, in the long run, they may end up paying for serious dental issues down the line.\n\nFortunately, we have several payment options if you aren’t covered by insurance and if you are, most allow for at least one visit per year, so you take advantage of those benefits.\n\nIf you’ve avoided the dentist because of anxiety, we make it a point in our office to create an inviting, comfortable environment where you can receive dental treatment stress-free.\n\nAdditionally, dental problems may not become noticeable until the disease has advanced. Tooth decay and gum disease may not show symptoms for a while, but a dentist can detect these much sooner and help you avoid costly treatments, or tooth loss, in the future."
