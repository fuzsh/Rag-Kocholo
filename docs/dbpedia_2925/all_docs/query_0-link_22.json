His extensive experience with public process and regulatory permitting enables him to focus on consensus-building in the early phases of a project. Mr. Amodeo is a 25-year Commissioner on the Boston Landmark Commission and heavily involved in the Boston preservation community. As a passionate traveler, his experiences have inspired his designs; John strives to celebrate the individual history, culture and natural environment in each of his projects.
