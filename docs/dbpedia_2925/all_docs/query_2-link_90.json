        "text": "There’s something so irresistibly charming about an old, covered bridge. Hand-built and often featuring intricate designs, covered bridges are exquisite works of architectural art. These structures are a beautiful reminder of a bygone era, but are becoming increasingly harder to find. But they do exist, and the ones that are still standing are resplendent relics worthy of your awe and admiration. Below you'll find the most historic and charming covered bridges across the country. Let these stunning structures inspire your next bucket-list-worthy adventure.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMosby Creek Covered Bridge - Cottage Grove, Oregon\n\nNestled in Cottage Grove, Oregon -- Covered Bridge Capital of the World -- Mosby Creek Covered Bridge is a winsome white structure that's beautiful in its simplicity. The oldest covered bridge in Oregon's Lane County, Mosby Creek Covered Bridge is the only span that is still part of Cottage Grove's roadway infrastructure. Built in 1929, this covered Howe truss bridge spans 90 feet over Mosby Creek and is open to vehicular traffic. It was added to the National Registrar of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nWawona Covered Bridge - Yosemite National Park, California\n\nThere are so many reasons to visit Yosemite National Park: the incredible waterfalls, the picturesque valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, and vast wilderness that includes the country's most fascinating flora and fauna. There's a man-made attraction in this national park, too, and it's a covered bridge that fits right in with its old-growth surroundings. Wawona Covered Bridge is located at the south fork of the Merced River; this bridge was built in 1857, but it didn't get its covered cladding until 1879. At the time of its construction, it was the only direct route to the Yosemite Valley, one that even Ralph Waldo Emerson took -- and we have no doubt it inspired him.\n\nBridgeport Covered Bridge - Nevada County, California\n\nBuilt in 1862, the Bridgeport Covered Bridge is the oldest covered bridge in California and a true architectural marvel. At 230 feet long, the Bridgeport Covered Bridge is the longest in existence. (New York's Old Blenheim Bridge previously held this title, but sadly, it was destroyed in 2011.) The bridge was once a particularly important link in the western United States when silver mining was at its height. Today, Bridgeport Covered Bridge is a beautiful reminder of a bygone time and, given its location inside California's South Yuba River State Park, a perfect setting for hiking and other amazing outdoor recreation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nFelton Covered Bridge - Felton, California\n\nStanding 60 feet long and 35 feet high, California's Felton Covered Bridge has the distinction of being the tallest covered bridge in the U.S. This unique bridge is situated within a beautiful park and has long attracted visitors to the area with its intriguing history, fascinating construction, and lovely surroundings. Built in 1892 and restored in 1987, this beautiful bridge invites visitors to step back in time -- literally. Though you can't drive on the bridge anymore, pedestrians can stroll through at the eponymous Felton Covered Bridge Park.\n\nCampbell's Covered Bridge - Greer, South Carolina\n\nCampbell's Covered Bridge isn't simply a covered bridge; it's an entire covered bridge scene that unfolds like something out of a painting. Between the bold red structure (the last remaining covered bridge left in South Carolina, in fact), stunning surroundings (especially in the height of fall foliage), and trickling stream and waterfall, Campbell's Covered Bridge might just be the most picture-perfect covered bridge in the country.\n\nRoseman Covered Bridge - Winterset (Madison County), Iowa\n\nThere's perhaps no place more famous for covered bridges in America than Winterset, Iowa. This area in Madison County inspired the eponymous film that put covered bridges -- specifically, Iowa's covered bridges -- on the cultural radar in the U.S. The special bridge, built in 1883, is the same bridge where Meryl Streep invites Clint Eastwood to her home in the romantic saga, and it's one of those filmic settings that is even more spectacular and charming in person.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nHumpback Covered Bridge - Covington, Virginia\n\nThere's no covered bridge in the country as unique or aptly named as Virginia's Humpback Covered Bridge. When you reach the center of Humpback Covered Bridge, you might notice an unusual arc shape in the structure. Built in 1857, the site is Virginia's oldest still-standing covered bridge and a favorite site for photographers and outdoor enthusiasts alike.\n\nAda Covered Bridge - Ada, Michigan\n\nBuilt in 1867, Ada Covered Bridge is a classic beauty that crosses the Thornapple River. Due to the Thornapple's propensity for flooding, farmers used to leave wagons full of stones on the bridge during high waters in order to hold it to the foundation. Today, it offers a calm and charming way to cross the Thornapple River in Ada -- because truly, can you imagine a lovelier scene?\n\nCaine Road Bridge - Ashtabula, Ohio\n\nIn Ashtabula County, Ohio, Caine Road Bridge is a relatively new addition to the country's covered bridge scene. The first Pratt truss-style bridge in Ohio, it was built in 1986 to honor Ashtabula County's 175th Anniversary. The 124-foot long bridge traverses the west branch of the Ashtabula River and is a glorious work of architectural art that, while not one of the Buckeye State’s oldest, has the distinction of being the first Pratt truss bridge in Ohio. Add it all up, and Caine Road Bridge is a beguiling beauty sure to capture your heart.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nSachs Covered Bridge - Gettysburg, Pennsylvania\n\nIn Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Sachs Covered Bridge is a ruby red beauty that is irresistibly, undeniably charming -- and quite historic, too. One of the most beautiful sights in Pennsylvania, Sachs Covered Bridge has stood proudly on Waterworks Road since 1852. Just 11 years after it was built, during the Civil War, both the Union and Confederate Armies would march across the bridge. The Confederate Army passed through the picturesque bridge as it retreated after the Battle of Gettysburg, in fact! Of course, given the gruesome nature of this iconic Civil War battle, it's said that numerous soldiers perished on this bridge -- by hanging. As a result, Sachs Covered Bridge is rumored to be one of the most haunted places in Pennsylvania, with the ghosts of Gettysburg lingering to this day.\n\nNewfield Covered Bridge - Newfield, New York\n\nOne of 30+ covered bridges in New York, Newfield Covered Bridge stands out for numerous reasons. Taking two years to complete, the Newfield Covered Bridge dates all the way back to 1853, making it the oldest in the state. The bridge connects across the Finger Lakes wine region, one of New York's most naturally lush and lovely areas. And speaking of connectivity, while many New York covered bridges have long closed to traffic, the Newfield Covered Bridge of Tompkins County actually happens to be the oldest covered bridge in New York still open to motor vehicle traffic, which is quite a claim to fame. For pedestrians, though, if you take the time to pull over after driving across the Newfield Covered Bridge, you'll find a series of staircases that will lead you down to overlooks around and under the bridge that offer glorious views of the West Branch Cayuga Inlet.\n\nFlume Covered Bridge - Fanconia, New Hampshire\n\nThe Flume Gorge is a fantastic trail to see some of New Hampshire's most unique rock formations and features. The Flume itself is a natural gorge that extends 800 feet from the base of Mount Liberty, and while this area is naturally dazzling, it's the iconic Flume Covered Bridge that steals the show. New Hampshire once had close to 400 covered bridges, though that number has dwindled to around 50. The eponymous Flume Covered Bridge is not only visually stunning, it's one of the oldest in the state, adding a story book whimsy to this naturally gorgeous area.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nArthur A. Smith Covered Bridge - Colrain, Massachusetts\n\nCovered bridges are well-represented in New England, but there is perhaps no bridge most iconically New England than Arthur A. Smith Covered Bridge. Spanning across the North River, this Burr truss bridge was originally built in 1869 across the Fox River, moving to its current location in 1896 after flooding. Over the years, it has been beautifully restored and is now open to bicycles and pedestrians. While fall is certainly lovely in this region of the country, seeing this red bridge amid the snowy Massachusetts landscape is absolutely sublime.\n\nAM Foster Covered Bridge - Cabot Plains, Vermont\n\nThere's an embarrassment of riches when it comes to covered bridges in Vermont, but AM Foster Covered Bridge stands out for all the right reasons. The AM Foster Covered Bridge was built in 1988 by Richard Spaulding and named after his great-grandfather who had owned the land, Maple Glen Farm, in Cabot. Not only is the bridge located near Vermont's iconic Cabot Creamery, this bridge will take you across part of Vermont's famous cheese trail. Vermont cheese, peak foliage, and a historic bridge -- this is the ultimate Green Mountain State experience.\n\nArtist's Bridge - Newry, Maine\n\nFormally known as the Sunday River Bridge, this beautiful bridge earned its nickname because it is the the most photographed and painted covered bridge in Maine. The bridge is an 87-foot Paddleford Truss, and was closed to traffic in 1958 when a new bridge was built downstream.
