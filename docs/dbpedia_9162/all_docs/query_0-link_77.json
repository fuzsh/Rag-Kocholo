        "text": "A time phrase is something that gives details of the time that something happened. It might be a single word or a complete phrase. Some examples of time phrases are tomorrow, at 2pm, five hundred years ago, and in the meantime.\n\nWhen a time phrase adds information to an independent clause or sentence that follows it then it should be followed by a comma. If the phrase or sentence comes before the time phrase then it shouldn't have a comma before it.\n\nExample 1:\n\nCorrect: Five hundred years ago, there were no grammar books.\n\nIncorrect: Five hundred years ago there were no grammar books.\n\nCorrect: There were no grammar books five hundred years ago.\n\nIncorrect: There were no grammar books, five hundred years ago.\n\nExample 2:\n\nCorrect: Yesterday, there was no new news.\n\nIncorrect: Yesterday there was no new news.\n\nCorrect: There was no new news yesterday.\n\nIncorrect: There was no new news, yesterday.\n\nIn general, the rules around commas and time phrases are as follows:\n\nIf the time phrase comes before an independent clause or sentence, use a comma after the time phrase.\n\nIf the time phrase comes after an independent clause or sentence, no comma is necessary.\n\nExample 1:\n\nCorrect: Last week, my husband and I went to the movies.\n\nIncorrect: Last week my husband and I went to the movies.\n\nExample 2:\n\nCorrect: A hundred years ago, women in the United States gained the right to vote.\n\nIncorrect: A hundred years ago women in the United States gained the right to vote.\n\nExample 3:\n\nCorrect: The Roman Empire fell centuries ago.\n\nIncorrect: The Roman Empire fell, centuries ago.\n\nExample 4:\n\nCorrect: I have an appointment at three o’clock.\n\nIncorrect: I have an appointment, at three o’clock.\n\nThe comma rule also applies to independent clauses that are not their own sentences. Sometimes independent clauses are tied to other clauses.\n\nFor example:\n\nCorrect: Go to sleep, and tonight, Santa will bring you toys.\n\nCorrect: Go to sleep, and Santa will bring you toys tonight.\n\nIncorrect: Go to sleep, and tonight Santa will bring you toys.\n\nIncorrect: Go to sleep, and Santa will bring you toys, tonight."
