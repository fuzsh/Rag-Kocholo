        "text": "Image credit: Thinkstock\n\nThe images that form in your mind as you read -- we call them \"brain movies\" -- can be more exciting and memorable than a Hollywood film. More to the point for teachers, guiding your students to visualize as they read is an engaging and enjoyable way to boost comprehension and retention.\n\nLearning to create brain movies can help students make sense of complex nonfiction subject matter and \"see\" the characters, setting, and action in stories. Teachers who use our strategy tell us their students seem to have more fun -- and success -- as they read. These anecdotes are supported by research showing that students who are taught to develop mental imagery of text do better than control groups on tests of comprehension and recall.\n\nThe research basis for the usefulness of transforming text into mental images can be found in Allan Paivio's dual coding theory, which holds that cognition consists of both a verbal system for language and a nonverbal, visual-spatial one for images. By creating mental images from the words on a page or screen, we tap into both the verbal and visual-spatial representational systems, making abstract concepts more concrete and thus more meaningful and memorable.\n\nFrom Text to Brain Movies\n\nVisualizing while reading is a strategy that should be explicitly taught. The assumption that children are naturally imaginative may not be true for all students, and even those with vivid imaginations may need guidance in applying the active process of making brain movies to improve their understanding of what they read. Follow these steps to introduce brain movies to your students:\n\nSelect a book, poem, or reading passage with vivid, sensory-rich language to read aloud.\n\nIntroduce words or concepts that may be new to students before reading, and share photographs, websites, and other images to help set the stage.\n\nAsk students to share examples of movies based on books they've read, and lead a discussion about the difference between reading the book and watching the movie. Emphasize that as we read or are read to, our imagination creates its own brain movie.\n\nRecommend that as you read the selected passage, students create their own brain movies based on the text by imagining the characters, setting, and action. Suggest that some students may find it easier to visualize if they watch you as you read, close their eyes, or gaze out the window.\n\nRead with inflection and emphasis on striking language.\n\nWhen you are done reading, pause to let students finish translating the text into brain movies. Then ask for volunteers to share their favorite imagery or scene.\n\nDiscuss how students' experiences helped them relate to the story and create their brain movies. How are the characters like them or people they know? How are they different? How is the setting of the story similar to and different from their neighborhoods and places they have visited?\n\nNote how many people find that visualizing what they read helps them to understand and remember the subject matter.\n\nEncourage students to continue conjuring movies in their minds as they read. Emphasize that creating brain movies requires reading carefully and attentively. And suggest that if they have a hard time visualizing a passage, they should reread it and look up any unfamiliar words.\n\nExamples of Brain Movies in Action\n\nTeachers who've used this strategy in their classrooms share these examples and tips for enhancing its effectiveness:\n\nShare Brain Movies to Extend the Learning\n\nFlorida teacher Kelly Rose introduced brain movies to a literature circle of fifth graders, beginning with the powerful language of poetry. After guiding students to picture the images in their minds as they read and reread the poems, Ms. Rose then asked them to share what they visualized. \"We found that our brain movies were all different, and by sharing our movies, we were able to remember even more details from the poem,\" she says.\n\nEmphasize Vivid Language for Young Writers\n\nWorking with elementary students learning English as a second language, Georgia teacher Melissa Smith shares reading passages that demonstrate how writers choose their words carefully to help readers create brain movies. She then guides students to picture their own stories in their minds as they write, which helps identify the details and striking language that will tell their stories most effectively.\n\nLet Students Choose Their Own Material\n\nGiving students a choice in what they read can make it easier to teach how to create mental imagery. They are more likely to be engaged in and derive meaning from reading they enjoy.\n\nFor Further Reading\n\nFor more details and examples on using brain movies in your classroom, see author Donna Wilson's 2012 article (doi: 10.1002.TRTR01091) in The Reading Teacher (available by subscription, perhaps through your school or district). Mark Sadosky's article Mental Imagery in Reading summarizes some of the research supporting this strategy. For more visual strategies to support meaning making and retention, see our book BrainSMART: 60 Strategies for Increasing Student Learning.\n\nHow might brain movies support other reading comprehension strategies for your students?"
