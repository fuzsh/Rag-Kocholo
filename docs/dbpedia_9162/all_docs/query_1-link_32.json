        "text": "65, Dir. Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, 2023, 93 mins, HD\n\nThis was such a stupid movie. I so hate stupid films like this, they make my head hurt. If it had been based on some obscure, horribly dated 1930s pulp sci-fi story, I wouldn’t be surprised: if that had been the case, and had the film been shot with that 1930s art deco/retro sci-fi feel there might have been some fun to be had, but unfortunately it looks and sounds woefully generic. What DOES surprise me is that such a stupid, hackneyed script riddled with T-Rex sized plot holes was deemed worthy of a film with a $45 million budget (even if that does seem small change compared to the wild spending typical in Hollywood).\n\nI suppose its some kind of an achievement- how dumb and boring it is, considering its plot- I mean, an astronaut crashing onto a planet of dinosaurs? How could it fail? The pitch meeting must have been a doozy with the cash registers ringing in everyone’s heads, but then somebody (oh, wouldn’t you know it, Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, who just happen to be the directors, too) went and wrote the script and, oh boy, all the energy and fun and promise of the thing just bled out. The execution in no way matches the promise of that pitch (I expect the studio heads must have thought, “hang on, this isn’t what we greenlit”, when the finished film was screened). Maybe its something to do with having twelve producers.\n\nThe basic premise, well, I still can’t quite figure it out, why they went the way that they did. If they’d written about an astronaut in the near future returning home but whose ship suffers from a dodgy Hyperdrive or happening to fall into a wormhole, hence being thrown back in time to Earth just prior to the end of the dinosaurs (a sort-of reverse of the plot of Planet of the Apes) then maybe I wouldn’t have been rolling my eyes quite so much. We could accept the American accent, the use of English words like “shit” etc wouldn’t seem so anachronistic being spoken by an Ancient alien from a far-off world, the chance that the planet he lands on conveniently has breathable atmosphere and normal gravity…. if he’s a human from the future all of that is taken care of already.\n\nI know, I know, I’m overthinking it, but this stuff troubled me all through the film. The astronaut’s arc is that he had to leave his family behind while he did this carrier job, his daughter was ill and died while he was away, and now he’s left stranded on an alien planet and quelle surpise a young girl is the only other survivor, and he has to deal with his loss and protect this surrogate daughter who has lost her parents and… well, its pretty woeful how the coincidences and arcs set themselves up. I mean, it just so happens that they’ve crashed on Earth on the eve of the asteroid crashing into the Earth that triggers the extinction event that wipes out the dinosaurs. You have to imagine the astronaut shaking his head at his bad luck… of all the days and all that planets to crash into, I have to crash into this one, on THIS day…\n\nI know, I know, its only a movie. But I’ll be damned if I have to keep on excusing such nonsense as this just because, well, its only a movie. Can’t these guys making these films make them better, have an ounce more ambition or skill other than nailing a great pitch and then dropping the ball trying to make it into a movie? Adam Driver is a better actor than this film deserves, and the young actress playing the girl Koa, Ariana Greenblatt, is so good she nearly steals the movie from him, they aren’t phoning anything in here, but they have little to work with. Its a wonder there’s any drama at all as they stumble from one plot-hole/crisis to another. The fact they manage to eventually reach the escape ship, but before they can launch it falls down the mountain to land wrong way up, only to be put right side up by a T-Rex during a gunfight (!) so that they can launch barely seconds ahead of the asteroid impact… You. Cannot. Believe. Your. Eyes. Well, I guess I did so that you, dear reader, don’t have to."
