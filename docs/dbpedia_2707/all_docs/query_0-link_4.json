        "text": "In the 1870s, the celebrations of the centennial of the Revolutionary War inspired nationwide interest in the founding of the United States. One of these inspired patriots was John Austin Stevens (1827-1910), whose grandfather was an original member of the Cincinnati. Stevens was ineligible for the Cincinnati, since his father was not the eldest son. Stevens was not permitted to officially participate in the centennial celebrations at Philadelphia. He wrote the president-general of the Cincinnati to request extended membership but was denied. Steven’s rejection from the Cincinnati based on his birth spurred him to investigate the feasibility of founding a like society that offered wider membership.\n\nHis immediate purpose of starting a new society was to have a group to take part in the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. On December 18, 1875, at the library of the New-York Historical Society, Stevens met with Major Asa Bird Gardiner, Professor of Military Law at West Point to discuss his idea. On February 22, 1876, Stevens called an organization meeting to announce the formation of Sons of the Revolution and invited persons interested in membership. The name was inspired by the example of the revolutionary group “Sons of Liberty.” There were few responses to his initiative.\n\nHowever, in 1883, the new organization was successfully established. On December 4th of that year Stevens hosted a dinner in the Long Room of Fraunces Tavern to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Washington’s farewell to his officers on December 4th, 1783. On this occasion forty guests signed the constitution of the Sons of the Revolution. Membership was open to all male descendants of officers, soldiers, and certain others who were in federal or state service during the Revolution.\n\nOn April 18, 1884, the certificate of incorporation under the laws of the State of New York was signed by thirteen men. On May 2, 1884, Judge George C. Barrett signed the certificate of incorporation. Frederick Samuel Tallmadge was elected president. By 1887, there were over 400 members. The Society formally amended its incorporation documents on December 3, 1889 with language that eventually formed the basis for the preamble to the Society’s Constitution which today guides the Society’s mission.\n\nThe most publicly visible act of SRNY was the purchase and restoration of Fraunces Tavern® at 54 Pearl Street in New York City. As early as 1887, SRNY attempted to acquire Fraunces Tavern, and in 1904 the owners agreed to sell the property. SRNY was able to afford the purchase because of the bequest of property and funds from Frederick Samuel Tallmadge, who died on June 20th of that year after serving two decades as our second president. SRNY took title in July.\n\nIn 1905, SRNY hired William H. Mersereau, an architect from Staten Island, to restore the Tavern to its 18th century appearance.\n\nThe grand opening of Fraunces Tavern® Museum was held on December 4, 1907, the anniversary of the Washington’s Farewell to his officers. Fraunces Tavern® was opened as a museum, restaurant and the headquarters for SRNY. A tablet placed on the exterior of Fraunces Tavern, a stained-glass window of Apostle Paul inside St. Mark’s Church in-the-Bowery, and the celebration of Frederick Samuel Tallmadge’s birthday (January 24th) every year by the Society all recognize his long service and generous contributions to our mission."
