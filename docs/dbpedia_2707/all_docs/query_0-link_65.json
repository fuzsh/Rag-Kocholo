        "text": "Evacuation Day marked the final British evacuation from New York City in 1783, after seven years of occupation. The evening culminated in a festive dinner given by Governor George Clinton, honoring George Washington and his officers at Samuel Fraunces‘ tavern. Evacuation Day remained a New York City holiday into the 1910s, with celebrations rivaling those of the Fourth of July. Celebrate as George Washington did that night, by raising your glass for the very same thirteen toasts given at the first Evacuation Day Dinner at Fraunces Tavern on November 25, 1783."
