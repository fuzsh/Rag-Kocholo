        "text": "We don't always consider the powerful impact that the War of Independence had on the physical landscape of 18th century America â much less how those impacts might still be seen and felt today. Join Professor David C. Hsiung for fascinating insights into the lasting legacies of the Revolution on the natural world, including deforestation at Valley Forge, raids that seized animals but also produced some surprisingly \"positive\" effects, and lead musket balls left on battlefields that may only now be poisoning the land.*\n\nThanks to the Paul Revere House for collaboration and promotion.\n\nThis lecture was recorded as part of Fraunces Tavern Museum's Evening Lecture series on Monday, July 15, 2024.\n\n*The views of the speakers are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Sons of the Revolutionâ in the State of New York, Inc. or its Fraunces TavernÂ® Museum.\n\nIt is a truism that Lower Manhattan has been America's town square since its founding in 1524, even though its history is much deeper. Virtually every aspect of global, local and national significance can be in some manner traced to this Downtown stage. Some have been forgotten and some have been transformative in our culture and many have fallen between. This is both a project in urban archaeology and a way of describing the city over time. It Happened Here captures the multiple and overlapping stories that are woven throughout our city's life. It embraces America's history as the museums, monuments and memorials that dot its streetscape do. It highlights many of the concerns, events, and places that the people who lived, fought, worked and visited here thought were important at their moment in time.\n\nThe July 4, 2024 program at Fraunces Tavern Museum was the fifth prequel event leading up to the United Statesâ upcoming 250th birthday and a 4-day It Happened Here celebration the weekend of July 4, 2025. This year's event included speakers on the following topics: Lower Manhattan: The Most Historic Spot in the Unites States; Upcoming Anniversaries: United States's 250th and New York's 400th; Fraunces Tavern: Its Revolutionary Story; The Promise of Liberty: An Authentic Originalism; Lafayette: A Hero's Return - Commemorating the 200th Anniversary of Marquis de Lafayette's Grand Tour of the United States in 1824; First Reading of the Declaration of Independence in New York and the Destruction of the Statue of King George III.\n\n*The views of the speakers are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Sons of the Revolutionâ in the State of New York, Inc. or its Fraunces TavernÂ® Museum.\n\nPerhaps no single day in US history was as threatening to the survival of the nation as August 24, 1814, when British forces captured Washington. This unique moment might have significantly altered the nation's path forward, but the event and the reasons why it happened are often forgotten. In this lecture, Dr. Robert Watson explores the British campaign and American missteps that led to the fall of the capital city, but also tells the redeeming stories of the courageous young clerks and the bold first lady who risked their lives to save priceless documents from the flames, including the Constitution. Join Dr. Watson for the shocking, behind-the-scenes story of the British attack on Washington and the rebuilding of the capital and nation.*\n\nThanks to The Society of the Second War with Great Britain in the State of New York and The State of New York Society, United States Daughters of 1812 for co-sponsoring this event.\n\nThis lecture was recorded as part of Fraunces Tavern Museum's Evening Lecture series on Monday, July 8, 2024.\n\n*The views of the speakers are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Sons of the Revolutionâ in the State of New York, Inc. or its Fraunces TavernÂ® Museum.\n\nThe opening of Fraunces Tavern Museum's new special exhibition, Lafayette: A Hero's Return, was celebrated with featured lecturer GÃ©nÃ©ral de Brigade Vincent de Kytspotter, PhD, Head of the French Defense Mission to the United Nations. This lecture speaks to Marquis de Lafayette's role in the American Revolution, the powerful Franco-American military alliance, and the lasting changes it brought about.*\n\nThis lecture was recorded as part of Fraunces Tavern Museum's special exhibition opening on Monday, June 24, 2024.\n\n*The views of the speakers are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Sons of the Revolutionâ in the State of New York, Inc. or its Fraunces TavernÂ® Museum.\n\nWhat did âthe pursuit of happinessâ mean to our nationâs founders and how did that famous phrase become the foundation of our democracy?\n\nThe Declaration of Independence identifies âthe pursuit of happinessâ as one of our unalienable rights, along with life and liberty. In his new book, National Constitution Center President and CEO Jeffrey Rosen profiles six of the most influential foundersâBenjamin Franklin, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Alexander Hamiltonâto show what pursuing happiness meant in their lives.\n\nIn this lecture Rosen not only elucidates the meaning of the Declarationâs famous phrase, but also takes us on a revelatory journey into the minds of the Founders, providing a deep, rich and fresh understanding of the foundation of our democracy.*\n\nThis lecture was recorded as part of Fraunces Tavern Museum's Evening Lecture series on Monday, May 13, 2024. Note that there is some minor sound distortion in this recording.\n\n*The views of the speakers are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Sons of the Revolutionâ in the State of New York, Inc. or its Fraunces TavernÂ® Museum.\n\nMartha Washingtonâs worst memory was the death of her husband. Her second worst was Thomas Jeffersonâs awkward visit to pay his respects subsequently. Indeed, by the time George Washington had died in 1799, the two founders were estranged. But that estrangement has obscured the fact that for most of their thirty-year acquaintance they enjoyed a productive relationship. In this lecture, Francis D. Cogliano considers the significance of one of the most important but understudied personal relationships of the founding era: the connection between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson that spanned three turbulent decades.\n\nThis lecture was recorded as part of Fraunces Tavern Museum's Evening Lecture series on Monday, April 8, 2024.\n\n*The views of the speakers are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Sons of the Revolutionâ in the State of New York, Inc. or its Fraunces TavernÂ® Museum."
