        "text": "There are several tax-beneficial ways to contribute, either directly or through tax-deferred accounts, appreciated assets, donor-advised accounts, or bequests. Whether you wish to give in memory, honor, or tribute of a person and/or provide funding through the planned giving of assets, the Fraunces Tavern Museum staff and Board are available to speak with you about the many ways to help support the Museum’s mission. This includes the Long Room Association Planned Giving Society, which is designed to recognize members who have documented an intended bequest or other planned gifts with an estimated value of $100,000 or more.\n\nLearn more about Planned Giving and the Long Room Association.\n\nTo be in a position to sustain our mission, we need to substantially increase our Museum Endowment and Building Maintenance Endowment Funds and have set a goal of increasing them to $10 million by 2026 (our Nation’s 250th anniversary). Each quarter, the Society will be updating a panel situated inside the Museum, recognizing everyone who has contributed $1,000 or more to this campaign.\n\nLearn more about the 250th Anniversary Campaign.\n\nDue to the age and complexity of our five historic buildings, we incur significant ongoing maintenance costs. Moreover, your support is needed to proceed with several urgent capital projects to protect their structural integrity. Please consider making a tax-deductible donation towards Fraunces Tavern Museum or becoming a Museum Member.\n\nLearn more about supporting Fraunces Tavern Museum.\n\nLearn more about the Museum Membership program.\n\nAs descendants of Revolutionary heroes our mission is to perform our duty of keeping before the public mind the memory of the services of our ancestors, and of the times in which they lived, and of the principles for which they contended through our programming and events. We meet regularly for fundraisers, historical events, community outreach, and fellowship events.\n\nLearn more about joining SRNY.\n\nAnnual Dues Payments\n\nSRNY membership dues are paid annually. Dues notices are sent annually in November. Dues must be received on or before January 1st of each year.\n\nLearn more about how to pay your annual dues."
