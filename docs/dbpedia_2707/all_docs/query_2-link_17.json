It documents the Museum’s own experience with the collections care remediation process so that other institutions may use this Museum’s success story as a model for their own collections care issues.The Fraunces Tavern Museum, located in New York City, is best known as the site where George Washington bade farewell to his officers at the end of the American Revolutionary War. The lineage group, the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York (SRNY) purchased the Tavern in 1904 and opened it as a museum in 1907 where SRNY members could preserve their Patriot ancestors’ possessions. With the purchase and preservation of Fraunces Tavern, the collection has grown for over 100 years and artifact donors encompass not only SRNY members, but the general public.",
