Presumably men were drinking, and presumably men were eating. Then, in a flash, an 18-pound cannonball bounded in from above, splintering the roof and eventually resting in a corner of the half-demolished bar.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

In this building, rebels planned the Boston Tea Party and George Washington gave a goodbye toast to his troops.\n\n“To be the first customers at Fraunces Tavern, we couldn’t give up that opportunity,” lawyer Mike Carroll, told The New York Times. “It means we’re here before George Washington.”\n\nPutting Carroll’s, um, creative logic aside, it appears that the “George Washington drank here” slogan may prove just as popular as “George Washington slept here.”\n\nPorterhouse Group co-owner Oliver Hughes will open the adjoining restaurant in the next few weeks, but has already set the place up to function as a “proper Irish bar.” Hey, an enemy of the British is a friend of Fraunces Tavern.\n\nClick for What Twitter Taught Us: A Social Network Cannot Kill Morgan Freeman"
