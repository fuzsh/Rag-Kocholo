        "text": "First Location on Broadway, New York City\n\n—\n\nOn May 1, 1788,1 the Department of Foreign Affairs with Jay still as Secretary, along with the War Office under Secretary Henry Knox,2 moved from Fraunces Tavern to a house on Broadway.3\n\nThe first location of the Department of Foreign Affairs on Broadway was in the general area shown here.\n\nThe exact location of the house is not known. According to Gaillard Hunt, however, it was on the west side of Broadway near the Battery.4 It is clear that Jay’s residence was located in this area,5 which may indicate that his office was nearby. Whatever its exact location may have been, it long ago was destroyed to make way for the commercial development of that street.\n\nThe house was owned by Walter Livingston,6 a first cousin of Jay’s wife.7 Livingston had been a Member of the Continental Congress in 1784 and 1785, and he was one of three Commissioners of the United States Treasury from 1785 to 1789.8\n\nThe Department occupied two rooms, “one of which the Secretary reserves for himself and the Reception of such Persons as may have Business with him, and the other for his Deputy and [two] Clerks.”9 Rent for the house was paid by the Government at the rate of $625 (f250) a year, plus taxes of $4485.10"
