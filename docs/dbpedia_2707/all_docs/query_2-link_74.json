        "text": "Don't expect squirrel pie.\n\nFraunces Tavern, which has been in business on and off for 239 years, is to reopen by July 4. Under the new lease, the Sons of the Revolution, owners of the landmark at 54 Pearl Street, will exercise unusual control over the restaurant, right down to cuisine, which must be ''primarily American.''\n\nThe lease requires that the restaurant be called Fraunces Tavern, but the landlord retains all claims on the ''Fraunces Tavern'' trademark. It calls for the proprietors to invest money in rehabilitating the building, to keep the restaurant open on weekends and to set aside space on the menu for historical notes about the tavern, where, in 1783, Gen. George Washington tearfully bade farewell to his officers after the Revolutionary War.\n\nBut the Sons will not push ye envelope too far.\n\n''To try to tell an operator that they have to run a Colonial tavern is not realistic,'' said Robert N. McKay, chairman of the organization's real estate committee. ''That's not what Wall Streeters want to eat. Today, people don't want to eat squirrel pie.''\n\nKeeping that in mind, some West Indies dishes will be added to the menu in honor of Samuel Fraunces's birthplace, said Michael S. Rakusin, one of the new proprietors.\n\nThat should be fine, said Peter Figdor of the law firm Salans Hertzfeld Heilbronn Christy & Viener, who represented the Sons of the Revolution in the transaction. ''If they're conducting a first-class operation, there's going to be a fair amount of latitude,'' he said.\n\nMr. Rakusin, a certified public accountant in Staten Island, used to own the Chelsea Cafe on West 27th Street and formerly had a share of Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South. His partners at Fraunces Tavern are Vincent J. DeSimone, chairman and chief executive of DeSimone Consulting Engineers in Manhattan, and Damon D. Testaverde, an investment banker in Staten Island.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
