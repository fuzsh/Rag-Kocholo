        "text": "They may not be turning off all the lights at the historic Fraunces Tavern this week, but the lower Manhattan restaurant will be closed for a while.\n\nThe museum on the second floor will remain open, but the dining areas will be closed starting Thursday because of a landlord-tenant dispute.\n\nAfter holding down the last 64 years of a 240-year run, the Norden family said it’ll be packing it in — they’ve been evicted.\n\n“We’ve been on a month-to-month lease for nine years now,” said Bob Norden, who took over the restaurant from his dad, Bob Sr., in 1960. “They have not been gracious with me, to say the least.”\n\nThe “they” in question is the landlord, the non-profit Sons of the Revolution, which not only owns the legendary pub where George Washington is known to have bade farewell to his officers in 1783, but four other buildings on the block.\n\nRobert McKay, chairman of the organization’s real-estate committee, said the spat is all about cash.\n\n“We’re obviously seeking a reasonable rate of return, a quality operation, and a cooperative relationship,” McKay said from the Sons’ offices atop the tavern.\n\nMcKay provided court papers that said Norden was in arrears by some $160,000 — an amount Norden claimed was largely based on the $10,000 a month the Sons tacked on to his base rent of $15,000, a hike he says he never signed off on.\n\nThe organization said it is in contact with five prospective operators.\n\nThe tavern — headquarters of the departments of War, Treasury and Foreign Affairs in the 1790s when the Big Apple was the nation’s capital — has not been dark since 1975, when an FALN bombing left four dead and 55 injured."
