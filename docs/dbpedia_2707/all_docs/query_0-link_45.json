The collections at Fraunces Tavern Museum focus on the culture and history of Colonial America, the American Revolutionary War, and the Early Republic. The 8,000-piece object collection consists of furnishings, communication documents, personal artifacts, and art. Objects range from tables and teacups to paintings and letters. About 400 collection objects are regularly on exhibit to the public in the Museum's exhibitions and galleries. Public Programs support the exhibitions and include monthly evening lectures, seasonal walking tours, reenactments, an annual book award, and guided weekend tours of the Museum. Our School Programs have been developed to compliment the New York State curriculum for grades 4th-7th. Students participate in programs led by trained professional staff and volunteers that include interactive activities and learning exercises that promote critical thinking and encourage the awareness of different perspectives. Students achieve this through discussion, inquiry-based learning, as well as the exploration of tavern life and the lives of various people from the American Revolution.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://frauncestavernmuseum.org\n\nExternal link for Fraunces Tavern® Museum\n\nIndustry\n\nMuseums, Historical Sites, and Zoos\n\nCompany size\n\n2-10 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nNew York, NY 10004\n\nType\n\nNonprofit\n\nFounded\n\n1907\n\nSpecialties\n\nAmerican Revolution, Revolutionary War, George Washington, Historic Site, Colonial New York City, History Museum, Early Republic, United States Federal Government, United States Department of Foreign Affairs, United States Department of State, United States Treasury, United States Department of War, Birch Trials, Black Loyalists, Black Patriots, School Programs, Collections, Lectures, Tours, and 18th Century"
