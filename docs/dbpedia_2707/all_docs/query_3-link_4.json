        "text": "In this lecture, Tyson Reeder traces early America's rocky beginnings, when foreign interference and political conflict threatened to undermine its aspirations and ideals, even its very existence. Spanning the period from the Revolution to the War of 1812, and focusing particularly on the career of James Madison, it reveals a nation adjusting to rancorous partisan politics, aggravated by the untested and imperfect new tools of governance and the growing power of media.*\n\nThanks to The Society of the Second War with Great Britain in the State of New York and The State of New York Society, United States Daughters of 1812 for co-sponsoring this event.\n\nJoin Sons of the Revolution℠ in the State of New York, Inc. to celebrate the signing of the United States Constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring special guest and speaker Tom Hand*. Hand is the author of An American Triumph: America’s Founding Era Through the Lives of Ben Franklin, George Washington, and John Adams, which was an honorable mention for the 2024 Fraunces Tavern Museum Book Award.\n\nJoin licensed tour guide Bruce Racond to uncover Central Park’s hidden Revolutionary War history! This walking tour explores some of Central Park’s most beautiful but least-known areas—including the grounds of historic forts and other sites from the war. You’ll encounter great vistas, hear captivating stories, and see vivid images and maps transporting you back to the 18th century as you experience the history of the land that would become Central Park.\n\nJoin licensed tour guide Bruce Racond to uncover Central Park’s hidden Revolutionary War history!
