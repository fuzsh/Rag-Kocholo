        "text": "Fraunces Tavern, located in Manhattan’s Financial District, is New York’s oldest and most historic bar and restaurant. It is a landmark building immersed in rich history where locals and travelers alike submerge themselves back into the colonial period of downtown Manhattan.\n\nThe tavern is now Irish owned by Eddie and Dervila Travers, who in partnership with the Porterhouse Brewing Company have revamped the old tavern and made it into what it is today. The Porterhouse Brewing Company opened Ireland’s first brewpub in Dublin in 1996 and spearheaded the now booming craft brewing movement in Ireland.\n\nSince Samuel Fraunces first opened the doors in 1762, Fraunces Tavern has welcomed weary travelers and thirsty traders from all across the globe.\n\nBuilt in 1719, Fraunces Tavern was an elegant residence for merchant Stephen Delancey. In 1762, Samuel Fraunces bought the building and transformed it into one of the most popular places in a city that was a political hotbed of thought and action. Named the Queens Head Tavern, after England’s Queen Charlotte, it became known as Fraunces Tavern as Fraunces’ reputation as a great cook spread throughout the city.\n\nOn December 4, 1783, nine days after the British evacuation, George Washington delivered his emotional speech to his officers in the Long Room. In more recent times, Superstorm Sandy devastated the facility but under Mr. and Mrs. Travers’ leadership, the tavern is now more successful than ever.\n\nToday, the tavern honors that history by continuing the legacy of America’s most famous innkeeper and brings you the most memorable tavern experience you can imagine. Mr. and Mrs. Travers, along with their dedicated staff, pride themselves on serving the finest food and drink, supporting local producers and offering a huge selection of America’s best craft beer, wine and whiskey as well a selection from around the world.\n\nWhat is unique about the tavern is the atmosphere it creates. With live music every weekend there is always something to look forward to at this famous colonial building,\n\nFraunces Tavern has an abundance of rooms available to the public, each with different characteristics to suit a customer’s needs. The luxurious Washington Room is suitable for up to 24 guests and is perfect for formal dining and conference meetings. The Dingle Whiskey bar is named after the picturesque town of Dingle in South Kerry, and is Fraunces Tavern’s most intimate room, home to over 200 whiskeys and complete with a cozy fireplace among eight oversized leather chairs.\n\nFraunces Tavern has its own dedicated sports bar, Lafayette’s Hideout which can hold up to 90 people. With its own entrance off Water Street it is easily accessible to the general public.\n\nFraunces Tavern covers all major sporting events, becoming one of the Financial District’s leading sports bars before the European Soccer Champion ships in the summer of this year. All games from the tournament will be shown exclusively live.\n\nThe tavern also has a restaurant which does not disappoint. Its wide ranging brunch, lunch and dinner menus offer a mix of fine dining and heartwarming meals in a quaint and welcoming atmosphere. The chicken pot pie is something of a signature dish in the tavern and is not to be missed.\n\nFraunces Tavern is located at 54 Pearl Street in New York. Reservations for the restaurant can be made on 212-968-1776 or by email on [email protected].\n\nPatrick’s Day Weekend HQ\n\nThe Fraunces Tavern headquarters weekend kicks off on Wednesday, March 16 with a TapTakeover from Southern Tier, an American brewing company famous for its craft ales and lagers. This event kicks off at 5 p.m. so get down to the tavern early and start St. Patrick’s weekend as you mean to go on!\n\nWednesday also sees the continuation of the March Madness NCAA Basketball first round games which will be shown in the sports bar. Happy hour which includes food and drink specials is from 4-7 p.m.\n\nDig out your green attire on March 17 and do your best Irish jig down to the tavern where Sean McNally and his band will play live from 6 p.m. until late. McNally has a regular spot at the tavern every Sunday, but make sure to catch this special event where the best traditional Irish music will be played all evening. March Madness will continue to be shown live in the Hideout Bar with happy hour from 4-7 p.m.\n\nFriday, March 18 is when your St. Patrick’s weekend headquarters steps things up a level! By now it is officially the weekend and Fraunces Tavern has more live music from the Raging Hornpipes from 6-9 p.m. followed by a deejay playing favorite hits until late. Happy hour again from 4-7 p.m. and more March Madness games in the Hideout.\n\nSaturday at Fraunces Tavern there will be live music all day long. Join us at headquarters for a jazz brunch with Emily Asher’s Garden Party Trio. These guys play in the tavern every Saturday and anyone who has seen them before will tell you that they are well worth a listen. Allen Gogarty will play folk rock from 6-9 p.m., followed by a DJ till late. Premier League soccer and March Madness basketball will be shown in the sports bar.\n\nMarch 20, Sunday, wraps up the weekend, but a fun filled day is in store. It will start early in our sports bar which will show the Manchester Derby soccer game from 11 a.m., followed by more March Madness basketball games. The area around the tavern is going to be a hive of activity as the United Airlines NYC Half Marathon will finish outside the tavern."
