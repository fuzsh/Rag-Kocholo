        "text": "Battery Park  In August of 1775, King George III declared that the colonies are in a state of open and avowed rebellion. During the same time period, the New York Provincial Congress knew that the cannons in Battery Park were at risk and should be secured. Under orders of the Provincial Congress and at night, Captain John Lamb with about sixty men began dismantling them. The British ship, the HMS Asia, under the command of Captain George Vandeput detected the activity and sent a barge-load of men to investigate. After a warning shot was fired from the barge, Lambs men returned fire, killing one of the men on the barge. In retaliation, the HMS Asia open fired on the battery.\n\nThis opening volley marked the beginning of hostilities on the Hudson. The event caused major panic in New York City and demonstrated how easily the city could be attacked from the harbor.\n\nAlthough the only historic remains that can be found in todays Battery Park date back to the War of 1812, an early morning walk along the waters edge clearly shows its strategic importance. Walk from the west side of the park near Fort Clinton and go east. One can see the Hudson River with the New Jersey Coast in the distance, as well as, Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. Continue walking to the east. One can see the East River with Staten Island, Governors Island and Long Island in the distance.\n\nThe British occupied much of what can be seen from Battery Park for the better part of the Revolutionary War, including Battery Park itself and the area occupied by the buildings that can be seen to the north.\n\nIn the short walking distance from Battery Park to Fraunces Tavern, one historically traverses the beginning of the Revolutionary War in 1775 to the end of the war in 1783.\n\nBuilt in 1719 as a residence, and later turned into a tavern, Fraunces Tavern has played a part in events before, during and after the American Revolution:\n\nBefore the Revolution, Stephen Delancey and his family enjoyed the life of a prosperous mercantile family in an elite New York City neighborhood.\n\nLater, ambitious entrepreneur Samuel Fraunces established one of the finest dining and drinking establishments in New York City, and George Washington became a frequent guest.\n\nRebels met and planned what would become the American Revolution, while being served by tavern-keeper Samuel Fraunces.\n\nGeorge Washington wept as he bade farewell to his officers in 1783, at the close of the Revolution, in the tavern's Long Room.\n\nAfter the Revolution, John Jay, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and Henry Knox, the Secretary of War, and the staff of the Department of Treasury, worked and made decisions that affected the direction of the new nation, when the federal government rented the tavern as cabinet offices from 1785 to 1787.\n\nToday, Fraunces Tavern is a museum and is a recommended stop for a longer visit to New York City. The Museum, founded in 1907, is dedicated to the study and interpretation of early American history and culture. They offer changing exhibitions, period rooms, tours, public programs and publications. The Long Room is now an example of a late 18th century tavern dining room. The Davis Center displays colorful reproduction, Revolutionary War flags. Special events are held on George Washington's Birthday, Flag Day and the Fourth of July.\n\nFederal Hall  The hall is at the intersection of Broad Street and Wall street, about five blocks north of Fraunces Tavern just past the New York Stock Exchange. The original Federal Hall that stood here during the 18th century was the first capital building of the United States and the location where George Washington was sworn in as the first President of the United States.\n\nOn Federal Hall is an engraving that shows a praying George Washington. The engraving reminds us that Washington was a person who was not above asking for Gods blessings and support. Although he is shown praying in solitude, he often asked his officers to join him in prayer.\n\nIn July 1776, John Page wrote:\n\nWe know the race is not to the swift\n\nnor the battle to the strong.\n\nDo you not think an angel\n\nrides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?\n\nThis was John Pages explanation for the many Revolutionary War events where one is at a complete loss to explain the logic behind decisions that were made or events that took place. Many of these occurred along the banks of the Hudson River and are upcoming stops on this road trip. Could they have not been the answer to George Washingtons prayers?\n\nAlso, on Federal Hall is an engraved plaque in the shape of the state of Ohio. Ohio was founded by circumstances created by the Revolution. One of the problems that Congress had throughout the war was raising funds to pay the soldiers. One of the ways they devised was to give them land in exchange for the money they were owed. As the marker explains, Ohio was founded by a group of soldiers who accepted this arrangement.\n\nTrinity Church  Anchoring the west end of Wall Street on Broadway is Trinity Church, which was chartered in 1697. From the entrance to the church one can get a peek at the beauty that lies inside. On the south side of the entrance to the church, there is a memorial to Alexander Hamilton and the many other officers of the Revolutionary War that are interred in the graveyard including Richard Montgomery and Horatio Gates, both Major Generals in the Continental Army. Alexander Hamiltons grave can be seen from Rector Street that is about a half block south on Broadway and another half block west on Rector Street:\n\nAlexander Hamilton began his involvement with the American Revolution while he was a student at Kings College (now Columbia University). He formed an artillery company in 1775 and became the company commander when he was commissioned a Captain in 1776. He served under George Washington at the battles of Long Island, Harlem Heights, Trenton and Princeton. In March 1777, at the age of 20, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and became George Washingtons Aide-de-Camp and served as Washingtons trusted advisor for four and a half years. In July 1781, he served under Lafayette and participated in the siege at Yorktown. After the Revolution, Hamilton helped lead the efforts to create a constitutional convention and served as the first Secretary of the Treasury under President Washington.\n\nRichard Montgomery was a veteran of the French and Indian War and was one of the first generals commissioned in the Continental Army. In 1775, he served under Philip Schuyler, the commander of the Northern Department of the Continental Army, in the expedition against British-held Quebec. When Schuyler became ill, he took command of the expedition and was killed leading a winter assault against the well-defended fortress of Quebec.\n\nHoratio Gates was also a veteran of the French and Indian War and was among the first generals commissioned in the Continental Army. He was popular with congress and they sent him to replace Schuyler as commander of the Northern Department of the Army after the American retreat from Fort Ticonderoga in 1777. He was in command during the Battles at Saratoga and was given credit for the victory. In 1780, congress made him commander of the Southern Department of the Army, but his reputation suffered after his flight from the battlefield at Camden, South Carolina, and he was replaced by General Nathaniel Greene. He later resurrected his reputation and rejoined Washington at Newburgh. After the Revolution, he served in the New York legislature.\n\nSaint Pauls Chapel  If time permits, the chapel is among two other Revolutionary War sites that can be found about five blocks north on Broadway. It was built in 1766 and is the oldest public building in Manhattan. During the Revolution, the church remained fiercely loyal to the British Crown and was spared the great conflagration of 1776 when the British invaded the city.\n\nAfter the war, George Washington attended services here while New York City was the capital of the United States. A special service was held on his inauguration day, April 30, 1789.\n\nThe chapel, which is a block from the former site of the World Trade Center, became a sanctuary after the 2001 attack on the Twin Towers. Today, the chapel is also a memorial to the sacrifice made by the 911 firefighters, police and other public servants and volunteers.\n\nOn the opposite side of the former World Trade Center is the West Side Highway: This route follows the same general route that some of the American forces under the command of George Washington would use on August 30, 1776 to retreat from the British who were just across the East River on Long Island. The day before, Washingtons Army was on Long Island with its back against the East River. They were completely surrounded and outnumbered by the British who could have easily achieved victory two days earlier on August 28th, but General William Howe, Commander of the British forces, had inexplicably halted the British attack. On the next day when the British were ready to capture the Americans, the attack was delayed by a fierce whirlwind  a northeaster storm (noreasters are unusual in the summer). On the evening of the 29th, Washington left the campfires burning while he ferried the entire army across the East river under the cover of a heavy fog. He reported that the fog seemed to settle in a peculiar manner over both encampments.\n\n225 years after the American escape from Manhattan, the West Side Highway would once again be an escape route for Americans under attack by terrorists on September 11, 2001.\n\nCity Hall Park  About a block further north of St. Pauls is City Hall Park. During the war, this area was the home of thousands of American prisoners. Conditions in the prisons were atrocious. Some were so over-crowded that all could not lie down and sleep at the same time.\n\nIn front of city hall is a statue of Nathan Hale. He was an American spy assigned to New York City after the Battle Long Island. He volunteered for the job at the request of George Washington. Hale disguised himself as a Dutch schoolmaster and slipped behind British lines. On September 21, 1776, he was recognized by a New Hampshire relative, the Tory Samuel Hale. Official papers found on his person revealed him as a spy and the next morning he was led to the gallows. His final famous words: I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.\n\nBowling Green  On your return to Battery Park on Broadway, Bowling Green is about two blocks south of Trinity Church. In 1770, after the British Parliament repealed the Townshend Tax, the colonists of New York, in celebration, erected a statue of King George III at Bowling Green. Six years later, the statue would become raw material for the making of bullets. It was pulled down by soldiers after George Washington had the Declaration of Independence read to them on July 9, 1776.\n\nA short distance from Bowling Green was Fort George. The fort was built to protect the harbor but had little effect against the British Navy. After the British evacuated the city, the American flag was raised at the fort with a 13-gun salute. That evening, a fireworks display was reported to exceed every former exhibition in the United States.\n\nBreakfast in New York City  The Battery Park Café can be found at 2 Washington Street, just off Battery Place on the northeast side of Battery Park. For breakfast, they feature several breakfast platers and the coffee is great.\n\nENROUTE TO FORT LEE, NJ\n\nThe high ground near 125th Street, Harlem Heights, is where the Continental Army would regroup and set up defensive positions for the next encounter with the British, but they would also retreat from this position after the British made an end-around move to flank the American position from the northeast.\n\nOnto Fort Lee, NJ"
