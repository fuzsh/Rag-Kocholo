        "text": "AKC Museum of the Dog\n\nReturning to New York in 2019, The American Kennel Club Museum of the Dog is the only museum in New York City dedicated to our canine companions.\n\nThe AKC Museum of the Dog preserves, interprets, and celebrates the role of dogs in society and educates the public about the human-canine bond through its collection of art and exhibits that inspire engagement with dogs.\n\nCombining fine art with high-tech interpretive displays, the Museum of the Dog’s return home hopes to capture the hearts and minds of its visitors. The Museum offers rotating exhibits featuring objects from its 1,700-piece collection and 4,000-volume library.\n\nhttps://museumofthedog.org/\n\nAlice Austen House\n\nAlice Austen (1866 - 1952) captured a changing New York City in more than 7,000 photographs taken mostly around the turn of the twentieth century. Austen documented her life on Staten Island and went onto the streets of Manhattan to photograph the activities of immigrants and the working class. She was versatile and forged her own path beyond the restrictive Victorian expectations for women. Austen was a master tennis player, an early advocate for women riding bicycles, founder of the Staten Island Garden Club, and is said to be the first woman on Staten Island to own a car.\n\nA vibrant cultural center, the Alice Austen House keeps the daring spirit of the early American photographer alive by presenting changing exhibitions of Alice Austen's pioneering historic photographs and of contemporary photography, providing education programs for students, and offering a range of cultural programs for the public.\n\nIn June 2017 the Alice Austen House, where Austen and her life partner, Gertrude Tate, lived together for nearly 30 years, marked its national designation as a site of LGBTQ history. The museum's listing on the National Register of Historic Places was amended to include LGBTQ history as an area of significance. This was an achievement of the NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project, funded through a grant from the New York State Historic Preservation Office and made possible by the National Park Service.\n\nhttp://aliceausten.org/\n\nAmerican Museum of Natural History\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History is one of the world's preeminent scientific and cultural institutions. Since its founding in 1869, the Museum has advanced its global mission to discover, interpret, and disseminate information about human cultures, the natural world, and the universe through a wide-ranging program of scientific research, education, and exhibition.\n\nThe Museum is renowned for its exhibitions and scientific collections, which serve as a field guide to the entire planet and present a panorama of the world's cultures.\n\nhttps://www.amnh.org/\n\nBard Graduate Center Gallery\n\nBard Graduate Center Galley presents pioneering exhibitions on decorative arts, design history, and material culture. Our research-driven exhibitions are organized with leading scholars, curators, and institutions from around the world, and showcase a rich array of objects comprised of loans from public and private collections, many never before on view in New York City. With a commitment to investigating under-recognized topics in history of design, our exhibitions provide a critical framework for understanding the context in which historical and contemporary objects were made, used, collected, and displayed. These investigations, in turn, lead us to a fuller understanding of the present through the lens of the past.\n\nhttps://www.bgc.bard.edu/\n\nBrooklyn Museum\n\nWith roots dating back to 1823, the Brooklyn Museum is one of the oldest and largest museums in the United States, with a collection representing nearly every culture, ranging from some of the most important ancient Egyptian works in the nation; to the arts of the Pacific Islands, Asia, Africa, and the Islamic world; to American and European art; to international contemporary works. The Brooklyn Museum is home to the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, the only facility of its kind in the country.\n\nPhoto courtesy of the Brooklyn Museum\n\nhttp://brooklynmuseum.org\n\nBushwick Starr\n\nThe Bushwick Starr is an Obie Award winning not-for-profit theater that presents an annual season of new performance works. We are an organization defined by both our artists and our community, and since 2007, we have grown into a thriving theatrical venue, a vital neighborhood arts center, and a destination for exciting and engaging performance. We provide a springboard for emerging professional artists to make career-defining leaps, and we are a sanctuary where established artists come to experiment and innovate. We are also a neighborhood playhouse, serving our Bushwick, Brooklyn community's diverse artistic needs and impulses.\n\nhttps://www.thebushwickstarr.org/\n\nCenter for Jewish History\n\nThe Center for Jewish History in New York City illuminates history, culture, and heritage.

The Georgian style house, begun in 1748, was built of field stone by Frederick Van Cortlandt (1699 – 1749) on the plantation that had been owned and farmed by his family since 1691. Frederick intended the house to be a home for him and his wife Francis Jay and daughters Anna Maria, 14 and Eve, 13. His sons James, 22, Augustus 21, and Frederick, 19 were not intended to be permanent residents of the house. Sadly, Frederick died before his new house was completed. In his will written in 1759, Frederick left the house to his son, James Van Cortlandt (1727 – 1781) and a life-time tenancy to his widow, Frances Jay Van Cortlandt (1701-1780).\n\nThe Van Cortlandts were a mercantile family prominent in New York affairs. Frederick's father Jacobus established a thriving wheat growing and processing business on the plantation including a grist mill for processing the wheat into flour and a fleet of shallow draft boats to carry the flour from the south end of his lake down Tibbet's Brook and out to the Harlem and Hudson Rivers to market. During the Revolutionary War, the house was used by Rochambeau, Lafayette, and Washington.\n\nhttp://www.vchm.org\n\nWhitney Museum of American Art\n\nVisit the Whitney Museum of American Art, the defining museum of American art from the twentieth century to today.
