        "text": "An Irish couple who own New York's oldest bar loved and frequented by Leonardo DiCaprio said taking over the historical landmark was like \"buying the Taj Mahal\". Eddie Travers, 46, and Dervila Bowler, 44, from Co Meath, acquired Fraunces Tavern, situated on Pearl Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, in 2011.\n\nThe bar and restaurant, established in 1776, is New York's oldest standing structure, the city's oldest bar, and the fifth oldest in the country, known as the watering hole for many of the founding fathers. It served as George Washington's headquarters, a venue for British peace negotiations, and housed federal offices in the Early Republic.\n\nThe fourth owners in 100 years, Eddie and Dervila employ 68 staff to man the 9,000 sq feet Tavern housing five bars and have entertained tens of celebrities from Leonardo DiCaprio to Annie Murphy, Ron Howard, and Katie Taylor.\n\nRead more:Ed Sheeran visits New York Irish pub that's re-opened after more than three years\n\n\"We did a huge renovation when we took it over and stripped everything back to expose the original walls, floors, and ceilings,\" Eddie told IrishStar.com. \"We brought in furniture from Ireland including church pews from Co Wexford and a bowling alley from Dublin which now make up the tables in our main bar. It was a big operation.\n\n\"After COVID, too, we renovated the upstairs room and turned it into a piano bar which has been a big success. We used designer O'Donnell O'Neill who designed the Guinness Storehouse to work on it. Our beverage director used to work in The Gravediggers in Glasnevin in Dublin, where he's from. We have a lot of Irish staff, too.\n\n\"We host Irish music at the weekends which is something we introduced straight off the bat. At the start, it was just my wife and I, a bartender, a server, and three musicians who didn't even want to any money off us because there was nobody there but we said, Don't worry, they'll come. Six weeks later you couldn't get a seat at the bar.\n\n\"Leonardo DiCaprio lives in the area so he always pops in with friends. He gives people tours of the bar - you'd think he owned the place! Nobody pays attention to him though, that's why he comes back, we don't make a fuss.\n\n\"Annie Murphy from Schitts Creek is a regular, too. She's a very nice woman. Ron Howard comes for Thanksgiving, Law and Order has been filmed here, and Katie Taylor came in after winning her fight in Madison Square Gardens.\n\n\"As my wife and I are from Co Meath, we were delighted when legendary manager Sean Boylan stopped by to pour a few pints behind the bar, as did Derry footballer and GAA pundit Joe Brolly.\"\n\nEddie followed some friends to New York in 1998, one of whom got him a job in Tír na nÓg in Midtown where he worked for six months. He then set up a restaurant with another friend in the Bronx before opening Brendan's Bar and Grill on 35th Street, where he worked for 10 years. It sadly closed down after the pandemic.\n\nHe and Dervila met at a local GAA dinner dance when he was home one weekend. They did long distance for over a year before she came to join him in the Big Apple.\n\nFraunces Tavern fell into their hands when Porterhouse Brewing Company in Dublin acquired it and while buying interior from Eddie's father in Ireland, learned the pair were looking for a restaurant in the city.\n\n\"In New York, it's who you know, and that's how we ended up getting the Tavern,\" Eddie explained. \"I'd never met the Brewing Company guys but they asked me straight off if I wanted to go into business with them. I said they didn't know me, and their answer was they'd done business with my dad for 25 years, so that was enough for them.\n\n\"We'd come close to getting restaurants but it hadn't worked out then bam, this turned up right at my door, and it was huge. An American friend said it was like buying the Taj Mahal - that's how important this building was.\n\n\"George Washington gathered his troops there to thank them for their service after the British troops left America. Before that, when the British were leaving New York, they found out George Washington was having meetings in the Tavern and threw cannonballs at the bar and destroyed it. It's quite literally been through the wars.\"\n\nThat incident wasn't the only blow the Tavern has suffered in its time. A year into their ownership, Hurricane Sandy struck, causing a huge amount of damage and closing the business for six weeks while it was still finding its feet.\n\n\"The hurricane nearly put us out of business,\" Eddie admitted. \"The first I knew about it was when I switched my phone on at 3am and saw the headline, historic Fraunces Tavern overrun by water. A man drowned in the street, that's how deep the water was around the building.\n\n\"There was around 8ft of water out the front and the electricals in the basement had all gone. It was a worrying time. We had to cancel on 1,000 people who'd booked in for Thanksgiving but when we reopened, thankfully, locals came back. They've been very supportive and made every effort to visit the place.\"\n\nThe Tavern has curated its food and drinks menu as a tribute to its decadent past, with customers able to tuck into a Chicken Pot Pie and sip on a Presidential Punch while taking in the cozy and opulent surroundings.\n\nNext, Eddie and Dervila, aim to add two more traditional whiskey rooms to The Dingle Whiskey Bar named after late partner, Oliver, and brand ambassador for Dingle Distillery, Mary. In the meantime, they are enjoying being publicans at the infamous spot, as well as being parents to their eight-year-old daughter, Lydia.\n\n\"I'm an Irish guy owning Fraunces Tavern but it's always been owned by immigrants, and hospitality comes naturally to the Irish,\" Eddie added. \"We don't get taught how to be hospitable - we just are.\""
