        "meta_description": "Continue on Broad to the intersection with Pearl street, which was also once water’s edge, named for the iridescent mother-of-pearl oyster shells along the shore. \r\n \r\nOn your right, at the corner of Pearl and Broad, stands Manhattan’s oldest surviving building, Fraunces Tavern. Those yellow bricks were actually brought over by the early Dutch settlers, and some pretty amazing things have happened within these walls. If it’s open, you can go in for a drink or to browse the museum upstairs.\r\n \r\nThe Tavern was used as a meeting place by a secret society, the Sons of Liberty, whose members included Paul Revere, John Hancock, and Sam Adams. They were the group who dressed as Indians and dumped that tea in Boston Harbor. And while the Boston Tea Party is in all the history books, they actually did the exact same thing here in New York.\r\n \r\nIf you’ve seen the musical, Hamilton, you may recall that he stole some cannons from the British, then used them to fire on a British warship. What’s not in the musical is that the ship returned fire, sending a cannonball through this Tavern’s roof.\r\n \r\nThe Tavern owner, Samuel Fraunces is credited with discovering and foiling an assassination plot by one of General Washington’s own bodyguards, who was then hanged for his mutiny, sedition and treachery.\r\n \r\nToward the end of the war, when the British had firm control of the city -- and the tavern -- weekly meetings were held here to record the names of black slaves who had escaped from their American owners and fought with the British as free men.  When the British fled, they took over 3000 of those freed slaves along, relocating them safely to Canada.\r\n \r\nThen, on Evacuation Day, as the British sailed off, George Washington and others gathered here for a celebratory dinner which concluded with thirteen toasts, one for each colony.\r\n \r\n“To the United States of America…. To the Continental Army… To the memory of those Heroes who have fallen for our Freedom… May the remembrance of this day be a lesson to Princes… May Justice support what courage has gained… May America be an Asylum of the Persecuted of the Earth… “\r\n \r\nIt was also here, days later, that Washington, who those present say was “suffused in tears,” formally said farewell to his officers, taking each in turn by the hand:\r\n \r\n“With a heart full of love and gratitude I now take leave of you. I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosperous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable.”\r\n \r\nAnd after the war, when New York served briefly as the US Capital, Alexander Hamilton founded and operated the Department of the Treasury in this building.\r\n \r\nBut in the early 1900’s, Fraunce’s Tavern faced the wrecking ball.  Just in time, it was purchased and restored by the Sons of the Revolution, a fraternal organization whose membership can all trace their ancestry back to men who fought the revolution, and includes eight US presidents.\r\n \r\nAnd while Evacuation Day celebrations have faded away in New York, the Sons of the Revolution still gather here, every year, to fill their glasses and give those same thirteen toasts:\r\n \r\n“To the United States of America…. To the Continental Army… To the memory of those Heroes who have fallen for our Freedom… May the remembrance of this day be a lesson to Princes… May Justice support what courage has gained… May America be an Asylum of the Persecuted of the Earth… “\r\n \r\nPut the door to  Fraunces Tavern on your right and walk to the end of the block.",
