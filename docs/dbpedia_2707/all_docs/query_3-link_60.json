        "text": "The Great Saunter is open to everyone, including children under 18 accompanied by an adult who accepts full responsibility. Children do not have to register or wear a bib to walk. Exceptions are youth groups, such as students, scouts, and teams. The leaders of these groups should contact us at Support@shorewalkers.org.\n\nWe encourage participants to consider their own and their children’s fitness before joining, but of course there is no requirement to complete the walk. You can join and walk only as far as feels right for you.\n\nBy mail in the U.S. and Canada to the shipping address on file. If you are outside the U.S. or Canada, you will pick up your bib inside Fraunces Tavern on the morning of the event from 7 to 8 a.m. We don’t offer day of registration so be sure to pre-register to reserve your bib.\n\nWe walk around the shoreline of Manhattan – up the west side and down the east side – staying as close to the waterfront as possible. This is an interactive map of the route, which you can use to navigate.\n\nHere’s how to use the map:\n\n● On your mobile phone, navigate to the Great Saunter page on the Shorewalkers website and click “View Mobile Map”; Bookmark the page in your browser for easy access while you’re walking the route.\n\n● The map will show your location while you walk (as a blinking blue dot) if you enable location services on your internet browser and give permission for the page to access your location. Open the map and follow the instructions.\n\n● We suggest bringing a portable battery pack to charge your mobile device during the walk.\n\nYou can also pick up a paper map on the day of the event.\n\nConsult your physician if you have any concerns about completing a long-distance walk. To train, we recommend building your endurance by walking regularly, and increasing your distance over time. It may be helpful to find a training program (search “how to train for long-distance walking”).\n\nTracking your miles can also help, using whatever method you prefer, whether it’s your favorite app or just a notepad. Shorewalkers has a group on the Strava app and the free version is all you need to track your walks.\n\nGiven the paved surfaces and the long distance (you may take more than 64,000 steps to complete the Saunter), lighter shoes, like running or trail shoes, may be better than hiking boots. We recommend that you test your shoes during your training and go with those that are most comfortable for you. We also suggest a change of socks at the halfway point to minimize blisters by keeping your feet dry."
