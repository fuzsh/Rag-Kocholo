        "text": "There are a lot of restaurants in New York City, but one that’s distinctly unique is Fraunces Tavern. This is the oldest restaurant in NYC, the second oldest in New York, and thought to be the oldest standing building in Manhattan. The first building on the property was constructed in 1671 by the Mayor of New York, and the current structure was put up in 1719. Amazingly, it’s been standing ever since, and now serves as both a restaurant and museum!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Fraunces Tavern is still a functioning restaurant. In fact, you can rent the Sons of Liberty Tasting Room for a private event through RestauRent! There’s also a museum there that displays Revolution-era memorabilia and art.\n\nDid you know the incredible history of Fraunces Tavern? As the second oldest restaurant in New York, it sure has a fascinating story.\n\nWant more New York in your inbox?\n\nGet the latest on things to see, do, and eat around New York!\n\nspinner\n\nThank you!
