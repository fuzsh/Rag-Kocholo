The Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York, Inc. are set to commemorate the birthday of Frederick Samuel Tallmadge, the second President of the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York, whose generosity enabled the Society to acquire Fraunces Tavern in 1904, at Fraunces Tavern Museum, on Monday, January 27th.

The evening will include a presentation on the Battle of Golden Hill and its repercussions, given by Barnet Schecter. The Battle was a clash between British soldiers and the Sons of Liberty and their supporters that occurred on January 19, 1770, in the city of New York in which several were wounded. The incident occurred six weeks before the Boston Massacre.

Schecter is a historian and author of several books including The Battle for New York and George Washington’s America. His talk will be followed by a Q & A.

A reception will be held in the current Fear and Force exhibit, which illustrates New York City’s Sons of Liberty activity leading up to the Revolutionary period.

Tickets are available for $50, $35 for those age 35 and under.
