        "text": "Following his grandmother’s death, Leo stopped growing and this was a time when his future as a footballer became threatened. Looking recognizably smaller, doctors eventually diagnosed Lionel Messi as suffering from a growth hormone deficiency disease. In fact, everyone in his household, including Newell’s coaching staff, became worried about his stunted growth. They saw Lionel looking like a Dwarf when compared to his teammates of the same age group.\n\nIn late 2000, Newell’s Old Boys issued an ultimatum for Barcelona to prove their commitment to sign Lionel Messi. They stood the chance of losing him on that fateful day of the deadline. While rushing to meet up this deadline Carles Rexach, who had no paper him, went against standard procedures and signed Lionel Messi’s first Barcelona contract on a napkin.\n\nLionel Messi’s biography is not just a story of athletic prowess; it’s an epic odyssey that charts the rise of a boy from Rosario, Argentina, to the zenith of global football. This narrative captures the essence of Messi’s journey, marked by early challenges, familial support, and an unwavering dedication to his craft.\n\nThrough this exploration, we uncover the milestones, personal life, and the ethos that define Messi, providing a comprehensive look at the life of a man whose feet have written some of the most unforgettable chapters in the history of football, illustrating his evolution from a promising young talent to a world-renowned legend.\n\nTo whet your autobiography appetite, here is a cradle-to-rise gallery — a perfect summary of Lionel Messi’s Bio.\n\nYes, you and I know fans compare him to the Legendary Cristiano Ronaldo; on the favourite question — Who is the GOAT in football?\n\nDespite the accolade, we realize only a few have seen a detailed but summarized version of Lionel Messi’s Life Story. We have it all cooked for you. Now, without further ado, let’s begin.\n\nThe Childhood Life of Lionel Messi:\n\nFor starters, Lionel Messi’s favourite nickname is “Football’s GOAT.” He was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, to his parents Celia María Cuccittini and Jorge Horacio Messi.\n\nIn case you didn’t know, Lionel Messi is the third out of four children born to his Dad, a steel factory manager, and Mum, who once worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop in Argentina.\n\nLa Pulga grew up in Rosario, the largest city in the central Argentina province of Santa Fe. He spent his early years mostly alongside his three siblings.\n\nSpeaking of his blood kinfolks, Messi’s eldest brother is Rodrigo. Matias Mess is his immediate senior. Lastly, his younger sister is Maria Sol Messi.\n\nLionel Messi Family Background:\n\nThe Barcelona legend comes from a tight-knit, football-loving household. From a cost-of-living standpoint, Jorge and Celia María once suffered a lack in the late 1980s because of massive stagnation in Argentina.\n\nA few years after Messi was born, the South American country was on the brink of economic collapse. This was due to Argentina’s inability to pay its debt.\n\nFor this reason, hyperinflation, devaluation of the Peso, and riots became the order of the day.\n\nLionel Messi’s family were among the victims of this economic crisis, which shook nearly all middle-class households. The truth is, Jorge and Celia María, along with three million other Argentines, struggled with work.\n\nLionel Messi Family Origin:\n\nFirst and foremost, the Atomic Flea is more European than Argentine. This is because his grannies – Antonio, Celia-Olivera, Rosa Maria, and Eusebio aren’t from the South American country.\n\nMessi is of Italian and Spanish descent from his father’s side through his paternal grandparents – Eusebio Messi and Rosa Maria Pérez.\n\nBoth grandma and grandpa were once immigrants to Argentina. They have family roots traced to the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia.\n\nLeo has only Italian ancestry from his mother’s side through his maternal grandparents – Antonio and Celia Oliveira Cuccittini.\n\nLionel Messi Untold Biography – The Football Story:\n\nGrowing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, La Pulga developed a passion for playing football from an early age.\n\nBack then, he played constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías. Even his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi (who later became professional footballers) played with him.\n\nWho Discovered Lionel’s Talent?\n\nAt the age of four, Lionel Messi’s grandmother, Celia Oliveira Cuccittini, recognized his potential and saw an unrivalled destiny in the little boy.\n\nIt was something unmatched even though his elder brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, taught him how to kick the ball.\n\nAmong everyone in the family, Celia Oliveira Cuccittini was the only one at the time who wanted to see Messi become a footballer.\n\nTo that end, she personally took the kid to his first football training session at Grandoli’s local football club. While there, Celia Oliveira Cuccittini goaded her grandson with the words:\n\n“LITTLE LIONEL,…. ONE DAY, YOU WILL BECOME THE BEST FOOTBALLER IN THE WORLD,”\n\nSo great was Grandma Celia Oliveira’s support. She not only persuaded Messi’s parents to buy him his first pair of football boots but tasked the then-coach of the local club to include her grandson in the match squad.\n\nThe Grandoli Test:\n\nMessi and his family once came to watch a match where a group of boys – a little above his age played.\n\nHis entire household was also there to watch Rodrigo and Matías, who were also featured in the game BUT NOT Lionel.\n\nIn that match, coach Salvador Aparicio noticed he was a player short. To complete his team, he told a smallish-looking Leo Messi to come to play with his bigger boys. After much persuasion from his parents, La Pulga joined.\n\nThe first time the ball came to Lionel, he just let it pass by. The second time, he controlled it and started running across the pitch, dribbling past everyone crossing his path – even his big brothers.\n\nFrom that moment of brilliance, he immediately became a part of Salvador Aparicio’s team. Working for his first-ever coach, Lionel became instrumental in helping his side win his first-ever trophy. Behold, the Atomic Flea holding the first honour to his name.\n\nEarly Career with Newell’s Old Boys:\n\nDescribed as someone with supernatural abilities, coach Aparicio vowed to take Messi to a bigger academy so he could make a legend out of the local kid.\n\nAt that time, Lionel’s Dad, Jorge, volunteered to become his trainer – all in the name of providing pastoral care to his son.\n\nA lifelong supporter of Newell’s Old Boys – together with his family – Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old.\n\nPainfully, just at the time he was trying to settle with Newell, his grandmother Celia Oliveira Cuccittini died. Let us not forget this is the woman who discovered his talent.\n\nCoping with Grief – The Death of his Grandmother:\n\nIt was hard for Messi to deal with the passing of someone who fought her way to get him into football. Her death happened shortly before his eleventh birthday.\n\nSince the loss, the Argentine began celebrating his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky – all in tribute to his grandma.\n\nFor the six years he played for Newell’s, he scored almost 500 goals. In fact, Lionel was a member of a set of boys called “The Machine of ‘87.” This was a near-unbeatable youth side whose nickname came from their year of birth – 1987.\n\nFans knew this group of boys to regularly entertain crowds. They performed ball tricks during the half-time of their first team’s home games.\n\nTo date, the Machine of 87 still maintains a WhatsApp group and looks up to Lionel as their leader.\n\nLionel Messi Disease Story:\n\nAfter his grandmother’s death, Leo stopped growing. At that time, the youngster’s future as a professional player became threatened.\n\nIn fact, everyone in his household, including Newell’s coaching staff, became worried about his stunted growth. They saw Lionel looking like a Dwarf when compared to his teammates of the same age group.\n\nRecognizably smaller, doctors eventually diagnosed Messi as suffering from a growth hormone deficiency disease. This was what restricted his growth.\n\nTruly, it was hard for his Dad to cater for his continuous medical bills. Back then, Jorge Messi’s health insurance could only cover two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost around $1,000 per month.\n\nIn a bid to support, Newell’s agreed to contribute but later abandoned their promise to poor Messi.\n\nThe God of football intervened as his grandparents (from his father’s side), who lived in Catalonia, sourced a way to get treatment for him with FC Barcelona.\n\nLionel Messi Biography – Road to Fame Story:\n\nIn their quest to get a club to help him treat his disease, Lionel Messi’s paternal grandparents – Eusebio Messi and Rosa Maria Pérez – had luck in convincing a prominent member of FC Barcelona’s management.\n\nAt the age of 13, FC Barca offered Messi the chance to have his medical bills covered by the club.\n\nThis came after Eusebio and Rosa told them stories of their grandson who has similar talents to legendary Argentinian footballer – the late Diego Maradona.\n\nAt first, it was FC Barca’s team director, Charly Rexach, who quickly pushed to sign him. Sadly, the Barcelona board of directors refused. At the time, soccer rules didn’t permit European clubs to sign foreign players of Leo’s age.\n\nThe Story of Lionel Messi’s Napkin Contract:\n\nOn 14 December 2000, Newell’s Old Boys issued an ultimatum for Barcelona to prove their commitment to Messi or else stand the chance of losing him.\n\nOn that fateful day, Carles Rexach – while rushing to meet up the deadline – and with no paper at hand, signed Lionel Messi’s contract on a napkin.\n\nEarly Life in Spain:\n\nIn February 2001, Lionel Messi’s family picked up their bags and moved across the Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. The entire household lived in an apartment near Camp Nou.\n\nSadly, Lionel Messi – in his first year – rarely played with his FC Barca academy mates due to a transfer conflict between Newell’s Old Boys and the Catalonia club.\n\nIn fact, Leo was only permitted to play in friendlies and in the Catalan league. Without much football, the poor boy struggled to integrate.\n\nTo make matters worst, he even became more reserved – not willing to talk at all. Lionel was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was a chronic loner.\n\nHomesickness and Re-Integration:\n\nLionel Messi’s immediate family members, except his Dad, were on a limited stay in Spain. As time went on, the youngster began suffering from homesickness.\n\nThis illness came after his mother moved back to Rosario with Rodrigo, Matias, and María Sol. Poor Leo stayed in Barcelona with his father and other distant relatives.\n\nAfter a year of waiting to play good football with La Masia (Barca’s youth academy), Messi, in February 2002, got an OK to enrol in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF).\n\nPlaying in all their competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were 2010 FIFA World Cup winners Gerard Piqué and Cesc Fàbregas.\n\nMedical Treatment, Farewell to Best Friends and Olympic Triumph:\n\nAt age 14, after Messi finalized his growth hormone treatment, he became an integral part of Barcelona’s Baby Dream Team. This was a side labelled as Barca’s greatest-ever youth.\n\nAt the time, Messi had just started playing constantly. He received an offer to join Arsenal. His friend – Cesc Fàbregas – went to join the Gunners. Gerard Piqué soon left for Man United. Lionel refused to leave, choosing to remain in Barcelona instead.\n\nLeo announced his name to the world in the year 2005 during a FIFA World Youth Championship. He finished the tournament with the Golden Ball, Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal.\n\nLionel Messi Biography – The Success Story:\n\nMoving back with Barca, he rapidly progressed through the club’s ranks – catching the eyes of Frank Rijkaard, who made him become steady with the club’s senior team. After his first training session with the big boys, Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi.\n\nThe fact that the Brazilian soccer legend called him “little brother” eased Lionel’s transition into the first team, which had notable players like Samuel Eto’o.\n\nDid you know?… Lionel made his debut with FC Barcelona’s first team during a friendly against José Mourinho’s Porto.\n\nHis impressive performance at the game won him positive ratings from sportswriters and fans. Since then, Leo has had many successful seasons, a feat which has fetched him more than 34 trophies for Blaugrana.\n\nSince his rise to fame, the football legend has won the World Player of the Year award six times.\n\nBecause Lionel has done so much — produced so many magic moments — won so many trophies, and scored so many goals, he is now referred to as Football’s GOAT. Alexia Putellas joins him as female and male players, with most Ballon d’Ors in a Barcelona shirt.\n\nTo tell the Truth, Lionel Messi is just impossible to replace. The rest, as we say, of the football legend will always be history.\n\nLionel Messi Love Story with Antonela Roccuzzo:\n\nInspired by the childhood sweetheart concept, the Argentine has an incredible tale about his relationship life.\n\nBack in the 1990s – in his hometown of Rosario – Leo naturally became inseparable from Antonela Roccuzzo. In this section, we’ll tell you how they found love.\n\nBoth sweethearts meet through one boy, the Argentine’s childhood friend Lucas Scaglia. He is Antonela Roccuzzo’s cousin.\n\nLucas Scaglia (now a footballer) is the same age as Leo. Back then, the boys found fun in playing at Rosario Beach.\n\nDuring one of such childhood amusement days – precisely in 1992 – Lionel found his future wife. From that moment, Antonela Roccuzzo and Leo had promised to be with each other – even as small as they were.\n\nWe have here, a piece of early evidence on – possibly – the day both met.\n\nOn their first day of the meeting, Messi asked his friend Lucas Scaglia “Who’s that?”. He replied… “She is my Cousin!” Leo later (at age nine) wrote eight-year-old Antonella a love letter in which he exclaimed:\n\n“ONE DAY, YOU AND I WILL BE BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND.”\n\nAntonela Roccuzzo’s Boyfriend before Marriage to Lionel Messi:\n\nFootball fans believed she and Messi were total childhood sweethearts. The truth is, this wasn’t the case. Distance once spoilt their relationship.\n\nIn case you didn’t know, Lionel Messi’s wife Antonela Roccuzzo got involved with another boy.\n\nThis happened during the heat of the Argentine’s battle with his growth hormone deficiency disease in Spain. It was a time Lionel Messi’s family left Rosario to Spain to have him treat his disease while playing for FC Barca.\n\nDuring that time, Leo and Antonela broke up. This happened after she later gave up hopes of seeing her man. Antonela Roccuzzo moved on and began dating this boy you see here.\n\nSeven years after Leo’s parents took him to Spain, he decided to reach out to his forgotten girlfriend.\n\nThe truth is, that Messi and Antonella’s relationship only got serious in 2007. During that time, she left her boyfriend – a poor boy – who refused to hold back his words.\n\nDid you know?… Antonella’s ex-boyfriend dealt with his heartbreak in a gentle-man fashion. In his words he told a local Argentine newspaper;\n\n“ANTONELA ROCCUZZO, NOW MESSI’S WIFE, DUMPED ME, BUT AT LEAST SHE (ANTONELA) DIDN’T LEAVE ME FOR ANY OLD BLOKE. I AM HAPPY SHE DUMPED ME FOR NO OTHER THAN THE GREAT LIONEL MESSI…”\n\nLa Pulga re-claimed his girlfriend, and after two years, he made his romance public. Three years later, both Messi and Antonella agree to become husband and wife.\n\nOn 30 June 2017, they got married at a luxury hotel in Rosario with parents and family members of both lovers – numbering about 260 guests – attending.\n\nAs I created Lionel Messi’s Bio, he has three sons. Thiago Messi (born 2nd of November 2012), Mateo Messi (born 15th of September 2015), and Ciro Messi (born 10th of March 2018).\n\nJudging by what you see below, you’ll agree with me he is a family man to the core.\n\nLionel Messi’s Personal Life:\n\nThe GOAT is a highly sensitive person who hates noise. He is the type who values the power of silence, especially in his home.\n\nFor this, Lionel prefers to live in a forested area in a Barcelona village – just away from the busy city centre. To defeat noise, he bought all his neighbour’s houses – a revelation made by his ex-teammate Ivan Rakitic.\n\nDid you know?… Even aeroplanes are not permitted to fly over Lionel Messi’s House – something that doesn’t happen anywhere else in the world.\n\nAccording to AS Football, Messi once raised a case against the Barcelona-El Prat airport. This resulted in the diversion of their runway so as not to interrupt his siesta with noise from planes.\n\nLifestyle Facts:\n\nAway from his activities on the pitch, Leo is a loving father and good husband. He belongs to the category of those who prefer to live a decent life – in his mansions just with his family and dog.\n\nSo far as we know, the Argentine uses his money to build big houses and buy automobiles.\n\nLionel Messi has multiple cars, and notable among them are Audi Q7 (€69m), Ferrari 335 S Spider Scaglietti (€32m), and Maserati GranTurismo, which costs €90,000.\n\nLionel Messi Family Life:\n\nEven with his fame, the Argentine maintains close ties to his Argentine hometown of Rosario – even to the extent of preserving their accent.\n\nLionel kept ownership of all his family’s old houses, even though they were worn out. This is evidence of his humble beginnings. Here, we’ll break down facts about his parents and extended household.\n\nAbout Lionel Messi’s Father:\n\nKnown as Jorge Horácio Messi, he once worked as a manager for an Argentine steel factory during Lionel Messi’s childhood.\n\nAs a man of foresight, he left his job to begin coaching his son – when Leo was four. This happened at the local football club, Grandoli.\n\nJorge Horácio has been with his son through thick and thin. These days, he serves as his agent, a role he has filled for decades.\n\nHe was the brain behind advising his son to stay in Barcelona to avoid legal disputes. This happened after Lionel’s relationship with the club got soured just after the coming of Ronald Koeman.\n\nSo far so good, Jorge Horácio has successfully managed his son’s empire. Also to note, Lionel Messi’s father is a divorcee – meaning he is no longer with his wife Celia Cuccittini.\n\nAbout Lionel Messi’s Mother:\n\nOften known as Celia María Cuccittini, she once worked as a part-time cleaner. These days, she manages her son’s personal matters and the Messi charity foundation.\n\nLeo enjoys a close relationship with his mum, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder.\n\nLionel Messi’s Mother’s Controversy:\n\nCelia María once caused a squabble by turning up to her son’s wedding in a white dress. This made her look similar to her daughter-in-law, Antonella Roccuzzo.\n\nAccording to Argentina’s culture, it is extremely offensive for anyone other than the bride to wear white during a wedding ceremony.\n\nAlthough, information passed in the buildup to the event reveals her dress should be “dark”. Despite that, she defied Argentine traditions. Celia’s actions made the family of Antonella Roccuzzo and Leo’s not to be on speaking terms.\n\nAbout Lionel Messi’s Brother – Rodrigo Messi:\n\nBorn on the 10th day of February 1980, he is the eldest sibling – 8 years older than the Barca legend.\n\nLike other members of his immediate family, Rodrigo is very much active in managing some aspects of Lionel’s professional business. He takes charge of Messi’s daily schedule and publicity.\n\nAbout Lionel Messi’s Brother – Matias:\n\nBorn on the 10th day of February 1980, he is the second eldest sibling in the family. Like Lionel’s mother Celia María, Matias helps to manage his brother’s foundation.\n\nUnfortunately, he has once been on the news for a negative reason. In 2016, Matias committed the crime of illegally possessing a gun.\n\nAs punishment, the local authorities ordered him to teach football classes in his native Argentine city for a whole year.\n\nAbout Lionel Messi’s Sister – Maria Sol:\n\nFor many who didn’t know, she is the only female and baby of the family. Maria Sol Messi grew up being treated like a queen by her elder brothers.\n\nAccording to reports, she had never seen Lionel dance until he rocked his body at her fifteenth birthday party. Maria Sol manages her brother’s store.\n\nLionel Messi’s Cousins, Aunts, and Nephews:\n\nA 2011 Genealogical research made by Diari Segre reveals the Football Legend has a fourth cousin.
