        "text": "Lionel Andrés Messi, otherwise known as Messi, is a 36-year-old world-renowned soccer player. Like Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi has a remarkable fan following, and is arguably the best player in the world, unless you’re speaking to a Ronaldo fan. Lionel Messi has many accolades to be proud of, including a record six Ballon D’or awards (he is the only player to win this award four times in a row!) and six European Golden Shoes.\n\nLionel Messi, unlike many other soccer players, spent the majority of his career at a single club, FC Barcelona. His legacy at Barcelona began at the age of 13 when he joined their youth academy, La Masia. Messi made his first-team debut for Barcelona at the age of 17 in 2004, marking the start of a remarkable career that saw him become integral to Barcelona’s success. Over his 17-year tenure at the club, Messi won numerous titles, including 10 La Liga titles, 7 Copa del Rey titles, and 4 UEFA Champions League titles. Moreover, within La Liga, Messi holds the record for the most goals, with 474, along with the most hat-tricks, 36. In 2021, Messi left Barcelona and joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) before making a move to Inter Miami CF in 2023. His impact on the field continues to be felt globally, as he breaks records and influences the game.\n\nLionel Messi’s Workout and Diet\n\nUnlike his former La Liga rival Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi isn’t known for his weight lifting regimen. However, according to most of his coaches, Messi’s sole focus is to increase agility and linear speed. As a result, his workout consists of a variety of plyometric-style workouts, including the pillar bridge-front, lunges, hamstring stretches, and pillar skips. After each workout, Messi focuses on rehydration and cool-down cardio for five to 10 minutes. How does Messi maintain his rigorous workouts when it comes to nutrition and fuel? Most of Messi’s dietary regimen comes from Italian nutritionist Giuliano Poser’s input. In 2014, based on the recommendation of Poser, Messi focused on the switch to five key foods: Water, olive oil, whole grains, fresh fruit and fresh vegetables.\n\nMessi’s Top Recipe\n\nMessi’s best-loved recipe was shared by FC Barcelona’s website and consists of roasted chicken with root vegetables. The recipe can be found below.\n\n30g olive oil\n\nSalt\n\nFour smashed garlic gloves\n\nOne onion\n\nOne bunch of carrots\n\nOne leek\n\n700-800g potatoes\n\nFour chicken thighs\n\nFresh thyme\n\nA Day in the Life of Lionel Messi"
