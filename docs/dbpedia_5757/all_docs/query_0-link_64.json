        "text": "The football world is celebrating Lionel Messi’s 37th birthday, with his iconic moments and accomplishments being the major highlights of the day.\n\nThe Argentine born on June 24, 1987, in the city of Rosario, has had over two decades of legendary football.\n\nIt all started when the forward joined the Barcelona first team from the club’s youth academy in 2004. He quickly rose to prominence, emerging as the best young player on the planet in 2005. That same year, he won the U20 World Cup and the Golden Boot.\n\nAs his popularity grew, he was equally relentless in his brilliance. He won gold at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, and grabbed his first Ballon d’Or the following year.\n\nThe Inter Miami captain has eight Ballon d’Or awards to his name today (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023).\n\nWhile at Barca, Messi had a memorable career, scoring 672 goals, winning 35 trophies including two trebles, and 48 hat-tricks.\n\nHe left the Spanish club in 2021 and joined French side Paris Saint Germain, where he won three trophies. He scored 32 goals before leaving PSG for Inter Miami in 2023. He equally has one trophy with the MLS club.\n\nLionel Messi is considered one of the greatest footballers in the world. He has won almost all major trophies that exist, including the World Cup, as well as the Copa America which Argentina hope to defend their title in this year."
