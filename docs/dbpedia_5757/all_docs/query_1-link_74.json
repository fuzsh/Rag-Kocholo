His father, Jorge Messi, was a steel factory worker, and his mother, Celia, was a part-time cleaner. Messi's family had to endure several hardships during his childhood.

However, Messi's talent was evident from a young age, and his family recognized his potential. Messi's father became his coach, and he trained Messi tirelessly.\n\nMessi's talent caught the attention of local football clubs, and he was invited to join the youth team of Rosario's Newell's Old Boys.

He helped Barcelona win numerous titles, including the Champions League, La Liga, and the Copa del Rey. Messi's performances were electrifying, and he quickly became a fan favorite.\n\nIn 2008, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or award, which is given to the best football player in the world. Messi went on to win the award a further five times, making him one of the most successful players in the history of the game.\n\nMessi's career was not without its setbacks. In 2013, he suffered a hamstring injury that kept him out of action for several weeks. However, he recovered from the injury and continued to perform at the highest level.\n\nIn 2014, Messi helped Argentina reach the World Cup final, but they were beaten by Germany.
