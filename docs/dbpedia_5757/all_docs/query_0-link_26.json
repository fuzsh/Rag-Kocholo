        "text": "The specificity of my personality can be summed up by my nostalgic yearning for my roots – a “paradise lost” which is also a source of energy and vitality. My power is linked to memory. I inhabit a present which draws sustenance from the past, from continuity and timelessness. The power of memory can either be dynamic or static. The consciousness of an inaccessible past can either immobilize me in melancholy and nostalgia, or shine as an ideal which motivates me to recreate a new harmony. My attitude and approach to the past are of key importance. If I think of it as a refuge, my obsession with it may be such that my progress is impeded. If, on the contrary, I think of it as a starting point or launching pad for my comprehension of the human condition, I will integrate it into my self-realization process. I possess a potential for great maturation and wisdom.\n\nI am relatively slow-moving and may feel protected from the outer world by an armor of education, family surroundings (my most cherished environment), and social status. For this reason, I tend to limit the scope of my activities to a single well-defined sphere, and, within the boundaries I have established, release the entire spectrum of my rich and varied emotional expression. Sometimes I may feel overwhelmed by the prospect of situations which will introduce me to unfamiliar factors and elements; I see them as intrusions. Before I judge an event, a person, or a thing, I attempt to absorb it into my private universe. Of a fairly subjective and introverted turn of mind, I define everything in terms of the sensation it arouses in me as my consciousness embraces it. This predominance of sensation gives my extreme sensory finesse. My perceptions are intense, keen, penetrating right to the heart of people and things. My imagination, which is a function of my perceptions, is also lively, colorful, and prolific.\n\nBecause I am sometimes self-centered, attentive to and protective of my inner self, I may tend to withdraw into my shell when I encounter aggression from the outer world. As a result, I may sometimes become distant and secretive. My tendency to be rather short-tempered and easily offended, a classic flaw, is also the consequence of my need for protection and security. Despite my sensitivity, and my ability to be genuinely virtuous, I am not always gentle. My outbreaks of hostility are all the more wounding because of their rarity. However, more than aggressiveness, my stubbornness, slow insistence, and undying determination are the extremes which may complicate my life.\n\nOnce again, the family setting is vitally important to me. My attachment to my family in general and my mother or a mother figure, in particular, is deep. The way I resolve (or has resolved) the transition to adulthood and independence will be crucial to my well-being, both in terms of my inner harmony (the sensation and sensitivity which comprise my identity) and in terms of my romantic relationships.\n\nDue to the influence of Sagittarius (the Centaur-Archer) rising, Lionel Messi, like the half-animal, half-human Centaur, has a dual, ambivalent nature, vagrant and capricious. It is natural for Lionel to be simultaneously conventional and rebellious. Lionel can happily submit to society and convention for a time, only to emerge committed to rugged individualism, or vice-versa. Lionel’s inner attachment to an ideal of liberty and emancipation does not prevent Lionel from adopting a sociable, pleasant attitude at social events. This dichotomy in Lionel’s personality grants Lionel such useful social skills as adaptability and poise, but inside, Lionel faces a quest for Lionel’s true identity and consciousness. Lionel’s primary psychological task is to maintain the harmony reigning between the two entities dwelling within Lionel. Lionel must not limit Lionel to being either one or the other. Lionel will achieve true psychic and existential stability by personifying a blend of these two behavioral tendencies. When Lionel is comfortable with Lionel’s individuality, Lionel can radiate optimism and energy; flexible and elastic, Lionel will delight in any change or unpredictability, without losing sight of Lionel’s long-term purposes. Eminently social, Lionel will express Lionel’s true nature by becoming deeply involved with groups and taking on duties and responsibilities as a member. Lionel will enjoy Lionel’s ability to infuse them with Lionel’s idealistic enthusiasm and visions for the future. Lionel’s special gifts for dealing with energy make Lionel apt to occupy a position of great social responsibility.\n\nLionel Messi is dynamic. He needs to attract admiration and release his excess energy.\n\nLionel Messi derives great rewards from every source of pleasure or creation (physical, artistic, or emotional). He has a penchant for speculation.\n\nAt the time of Lionel Messi’s birth, his rising sign was located in Sagittarius (the Archer), while the sun was passing through the sign of Cancer (the Crab). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide his personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of his character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nImpetuosity – Sensitivity – Enthusiasm – Imagination – Group spirit – Eccentricity – Impressionability – Savings and thrift – Analytical mind – Worldly concerns – Obstinacy – Projection – Premonition.\n\nTorn between Lionel Messi’s desire for independence and freedom and an undeniable need for security, he could have trouble finding an inner balance in the early part of his life. He is attracted by novelty and change and tempted by travel and exploration but also loyal to a small circle of interests and friends.\n\nHe is sometimes daring, sometimes cautious.\n\nAs an adult, Lionel Messi will probably achieve security and self-confidence when he creates his own home. At that point, all of his considerable resources will blossom: his mind will be open to intuitive intelligence emanating from his unconscious, and his fertile imagination will become a source of joy and creativity.\n\nBorn in the three days prior to the new moon’s appearance, Lionel Messi is said to be of the “balsamic moon” type. This soli-lunar configuration gives him a spiritualistic character closely attached to generous humanitarian ideals. He is sometimes sorely tried to limit himself to the narrow scope of individual ambition.\n\nIndeed, he aims for a humanitarian ideal which would include the outcasts and the unfortunate. He fervently hopes the meek will inherit the earth. To bring about this ideal, he is likely to seize every resource placed at his disposal: physical effort, money (if he has it), speech, his writings, and his poetic or artistic talents. However, he should be wary of his unconscious guilt feelings.\n\nActually, there is no reason for him to devote himself to his mission entirely; a simple daily effort should suffice to express his philosophy and free his conscience. Usually, the three days preceding the new moon will be time in the monthly lunar cycle most favorable to his activities and his general energy level."
