        "text": "By Luke Guevara\n\nMarch 2nd, 2023\n\nEver since I could remember, my Argentine heritage has been a key component of my life. Constantly pestering my grandfather and dad all about the nation, their experiences, and most importantly to me, football. My father remembers sneaking out to a football game in Argentina, witnessing the passion and raw emotion of fans who would later riot after a loss. On December 18th, 2022, these same family members crowded around the TV, watching, hoping, and praying for our nation’s victory. But in my head, all I wanted was a Messi victory. The Argentine superstar had his humble beginnings with Argentina and Barcelona around the time I was born. He quickly ascended the ranks of football (soccer for Americans) scoring goal after goal, securing trophy after trophy. I had been in awe of his ability since a young boy, and following his journey, I felt a deep connection to the completion of his dream. When the battle was over, and he raised the trophy, I couldn’t hold back the tear which had formed in my eye. His victory had surpassed football and the hopes of a nation, and instead proved to the world that anything is achievable through hard work and determination.\n\nOn June 24th, 1987, Lionel Andrés Messi was born in Rosario, Argentina. Son of Jorge Messi and Celia Cuccittini, the boy was named after American rhythm and blues artist Lionel Richie. From a young age, Messi showed a great aptitude for football and began playing on his first team, his father’s club Grandoli, at age five. As he grew, and his talent was recognized within his city, Messi began playing for Newell’s Old Boys, a more renowned and distinguished club for slightly older children.\n\nIt was around this time Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, a jarring discovery for any child, but especially one with such athletic prowess. A common misconception is that height doesn’t affect a footballer’s success. To some degree, this is true, as historically successful footballers have been fairly short. Garrincha, Xavi, Maradona, and many other legends within the sport were 5’7 and below. However, headers act as an important mechanic which demands an inherent height advantage against the opposing players. Messi’s deficiency also meant he would be weaker and his strength would be much harder to build. Even with this disadvantage, Messi’s superior vision, finishing, and passing abilities made him the town’s football celebrity.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Planet Football\n\nYet he remained widely unknown to scouts and clubs. When a football agent contacted Carles Rexach, an FC Barcelona scout, about a talent in Argentina, he expected to visit an older teenager with intriguing talent. He was likely disappointed when he learned Messi was just 13. After much persuasion from the Argentine scout, Rexach flew the young boy out to Barcelona to test his talents and evaluate his skill. Messi was placed in a match with boys, nearly men, years older than him and vastly larger than him. Rexach, in awe, told the Coaches Voice that he had “never seen anything like it. He did incredible things for a kid his age – the same things he still does match after match now, but at that size”. After months of playing in Barcelona friendlies and Rexach pleading with higher-ups to sign the boy, Messi and his father were anxious to return home. He had been injured with a broken fibula and saw little hope in being signed. It was just days later that Rexach would sign Messi a professional contract on a napkin at a Tennis club in Barcelona. A year after this signing, Rexach would enjoy the fruits of his labor as the head coach of the club.\n\nIn 2003, At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi suited up and played in his first friendly with the club. The boy played alongside a footballing legend, the Brazilian Ronaldinho: a World Cup, Copa América, and Champions League winner. In 2005, 17-year-old Messi scored his first goal in a Barca kit, assisted by his footballing godfather, Ronaldinho. The rising star would spend a dedicated twenty years of his life playing for the club, going from star boy to veteran. Messi amassed a monstrous 672 goals in 778 games, along with 269 Assists, helping to win the club 35 trophies and, most importantly, 4 Champions Leagues. He additionally destroyed the record for most goals in a calendar year (previously held by Gerd Muller with 85), netting 91. In his time with the club, Messi had contested a position for greatest of all time. But his legacy was still disputable. He was tied in Ballon D’ors with his unpronounced rival, Cristiano Ronaldo. He had never won a World Cup or a Copa América. He had never led his nation to victory, aside from his youth years, which made his case lackluster when compared to others greats, like the late Argentine, Maradona. That was before 2021.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of UEFA\n\nIn 2021 Messi was signed by prolific Ligue 1 club, Paris Saint-Germain, as Barcelona’s money troubles prevented them from keeping him. It seemed that after this decision, Messi sought not to contest the GOAT debate, but to make his case undisputable. That year, Messi championed his Argentina international team to its first Copa América since 1993, a feat even Maradona couldn’t achieve. Messi performed so well this year in fact, he added another Ballon Dor to his collection with 47 goals and assists, surpassing his rival. Even with this stellar performance, the next year would prove to be even more important. Messi had a slow start to his club season, with around 8 goals before the break for the World Cup. A 35-year-old Messi was the captain of a young team (the only other veteran starter being Di Maria) that was brimming with talent and passion, yearning to bring glory to their nation. This passion was so overwhelming, Argentine Midfielder Alexis De Paul is quoted as saying, “I’d go to war for Messi if he asked me to”. This was Messi’s last chance at greatness, as he had declared he would not be competing in the cup again. And Messi performed like it. After a heartbreaking upset in the first round of the group stage to Saudi Arabia, the team absolutely scorched their way to a France vs. Argentina final. In a thriller of a match, after two crucial Messi goals, and a hattrick for the French Kylian Mbappé, the Argentine team pulled through in penalties. Messi ended the Cup with seven goals and three assists, championing the nation to its first World Cup victory since Maradona’s in 1986. Additionally Messi earned his second career Golden Ball, an award given to the best player of the tournament.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of CNN"
