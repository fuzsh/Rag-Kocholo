        "text": "Lionel Messi is an Argentine professional footballer.\n\nHe plays as a forward and captain both Inter Miami C.F. and the Argentina National Football Team. Considered the best player in the world and regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards and a record six European Golden Shoes. He has spent his entire professional career with FC Barcelona, where he has won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League (1992) titles and six Copas del Rey. Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (1992) (8). He has scored over 900 senior career goals for club and country.\n\nAn Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2005 (2005), finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the Beijing 2008: Games of the XXIX Olympiad (2008). After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a 2006 FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament.\n\nAs the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil (2014), for which he won the Golden Ball, and the Copa América 2015 (2015) and Copa América Centenario (2016). After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia (2018), and a third-place finish at the Copa América Brasil 2019 (2019). In the 1/8 finals match of 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia (2018) against the future winner of the tournament, France National Football Team, Messi gave two assists, but the Argentines lost with a score of 3:4 and ended their participation in the tournament.\n\nOn July 10, 2021 the Argentina National Football Team beat Brazil in the final of Copa America 2021 (2021) with a score of 1:0. Thus, Lionel Messi won his first trophy with the national team. He also became the tournament's top scorer (shared with Luis Fernando Díaz from Colombia).\n\nIn the final match of 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar (2022) against France in the first half, Messi opened the scoring from the penalty spot. Regular time ended with the score 2:2, at the beginning of the second extra period Messi put Argentina ahead. However, Kylian Mbappé managed to level the score from the penalty spot, scoring his third goal of the game (3:3). In the penalty shoot-out, Messi was the first to beat for Argentines and converted his shot. As a result, the Argentines won the series with a score of 4:2 and became three-time world champions. Messi was named the best player of the match and was also named the best player of the tournament overall."
