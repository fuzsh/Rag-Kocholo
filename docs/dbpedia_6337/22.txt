Japan missed out on a medal and finished fifth in the men's 4x100-meter relay at the world athletics championships Saturday, marred by a faulty baton handoff.

Japan's team of Ryuichiro Sakai, Hiroki Yanagita, Yuki Koike and Abdul Hakim Sani Brown clocked 37.83 seconds, 0.07 behind bronze medalist Jamaica.

The United States claimed gold in 37.38 seconds, 0.24 ahead of silver medalist Italy as Noah Lyles completed a sprint treble, adding to his 100- and 200-meter wins.

Japan finished out of the medals in this event for the third consecutive major international competition, following the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and last year's world championships.

Japan took bronze at both the 2017 and 2019 world championships.

"I turned around when I received the baton (from Koike), so I could hardly accelerate," Japan's anchor runner Sani Brown said. "Getting to run in this relay final will be a good experience for me going forward."

In other events on the championships' eighth day, Japan's Nozomi Tanaka placed eighth in 14 minutes, 58.99 seconds in the women's 5,000-meter final won by Kenya's Faith Kipyegon (14:53.88).
