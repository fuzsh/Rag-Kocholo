In 1948, the all-male Jamaican athletic team won for the first time gold, silver and bronze medals at the Summer Olympics in London and again in 1952 in Helsinki.

These incredible successes were not signs of smooth sailing, for it was not until 1968 in Mexico that Jamaican male athletes succeeded in winning a bronze medal. Later Donald Quarrie won gold and silver at the 1976 Montreal games, which marked a turning point for Jamaica's male athletes.

The trend continued mainly to the incomparable Usain Bolt who won gold in all his events at Beijing in 2008, London in 2012 and Rio in 2016.

The success of Bolt and other medal winning athletes has given Jamaica the reputation today as a producer of world class short distance runners.

Here is a table that lists Jamaica's Olympic gold medal male athletes in track and field events from 1948 to 2012.
