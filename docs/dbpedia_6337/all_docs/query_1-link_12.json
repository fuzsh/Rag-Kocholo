Taylor has served USA Basketball on a variety of occasions. She started off as a court coach at the 2018 USA U18 National Team Trials and then won gold as an assistant with the 2021 U19 World Cup Team. Taylor won gold as an assistant coach for the USA Women's National Team at the 2022 FIBA World Cup and as head coach for the 2022 USA Basketball Women's U18 National Team in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 2023, she added a fourth gold medal to her USA Basketball resume with a spotless 7-0 record as the head coach of the American U19 team at the 2023 FIBA World Cup.\n\nDiving\n\nAustralian divers Kurtis Mathews and Jaxon Bowshire became first-time Olympians this summer.

Pickrem will compete individually in the 200m breast and 200m IM after securing a pair of top-two finishes at Bell Canadian Swimming Trials in May.

He finished third in the final in 1:43.97 and was one of the two athletes to run sub 1:44 twice during the trials.\n\nJacob Wooten added another spot in the field for Team USA with a second-place finish at the qualifying event.
