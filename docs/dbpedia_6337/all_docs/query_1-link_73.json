        "text": "Sir Brendan Foster CBE (Honorary MEd, 1976)\n\nSir Brendan Foster is a British former long-distance runner. He has competed in three Olympic Games, most notably winning a Bronze medal in the 10,000 metres at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.\n\nHe was awarded BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1974 after winning a Gold medal in the 5,000 metres at the European Championships and breaking the 3,000 metres World Record on his home track, Gateshead International Stadium.\n\nHaving taken part in the Round the Bays Race in 1979, a city to coastal route in New Zealand, Brendan envisioned bringing a similar experience to the North East and decided to establish the Great North Run. 12,264 runners joined the start line for the first race in 1981 and since then it has become a highlight in the North East’s sporting calendar, welcoming 60,000 participants annually – from professional athletes to amateur runners raising money for worthy causes.\n\nEd Coode MBE (BSc Marine Biology 1997)\n\nEd Coode is a former British rower, who has represented Team GB at two Olympic Games. Ed rowed to victory at the 2004 Olympics in Athens winning a Gold medal in the men’s coxless four. Prior to this, he competed in Sydney at the 2000 Olympics rowing in the coxless pair and narrowly missed out on a Bronze medal.\n\nEd has also won two World Championships during his rowing career, first in 1999 and again in 2001.\n\nHe was part of the Newcastle University Boat Club during his time at university and played a crucial role in establishing the inaugural ‘Boat Race of the North’ on the River Tyne between Newcastle and Durham boat clubs, which has since become an annual fixture.\n\nEd announced that he was retiring from rowing in 2004 and went on to qualify as a solicitor.\n\nHe was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2005 New Year Honours for his services to sport.\n\nRowers Tom Ford (BA Geography & Planning, 2014) and James Rudkin (BA Politics & History, 2015), were part of the men’s eight who won a Bronze medal, whilst Emily Ford (BA Fine Art, 2017) competed in the women’s eight.\n\nDuring their time at university, they were all part of the Newcastle University Boat Club (NUBC). Tom was captain of the men’s team in 2014, the following year James was captain of the men’s team and Emily was captain of the women’s team.\n\nTom first represented Team GB whilst still at university competing in the men’s eight at the U23 World Rowing Championships in 2013. James has been part of the team from an early age, competing at junior levels. They both joined the senior team in 2017. Since then, they have become double world champions winning Gold at both the 2022 and 2023 World Rowing Championships.\n\nEmily joined the senior team a year after graduation in 2018 and made history at the World Championships at Belgrade in 2023, when she and teammate Esme Booth became the first British women to qualify two boats for an Olympic Games at the same regatta.\n\nThe trio will be heading to Paris to compete in this year’s Games alongside fellow alumni Lola Anderson, Will Stewart and James Robson, marking a record number of Newcastle University graduates representing Great Britain's rowing team at an Olympic Games. We wish them all of the best of luck!\n\nPhoto credit: Benedict Tufnell\n\nJonathan Edwards CBE (Honorary DCL, 2001)\n\nJonathan Edwards is a British triple jumper, who won a Gold medal at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney and Silver at the 1996 Games in Atlanta.\n\nHe is renowned for breaking the world record for the triple jump (not once but twice!) at the World Champions in 1995, jumping 18.29 m. He was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year for this exceptional performance.\n\nHe was awarded an MBE in 1996 and a CBE in 2001 for his achievements.\n\nJonathan retired in 2003 and since then has regularly appeared on television as a sports commentator and presenter.\n\nBaroness Tanni Grey-Thompson DBE, DL (Honorary DCL, 2005)\n\nBaroness Tanni Grey-Thompson is a former British Paralympian who has competed in five Paralympic games, winning a staggering 11 Gold medals, 4 Silver and 1 Bronze.

At her final Paralympic Games at Athens in 2004, Tanni won two Gold medals in the 100 metres and 400 metres wheelchair races.\n\nTanni announced her retirement in 2007 after a successful career of holding over 30 world records. She was awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019.\n\nTanni has been a key advocate for disabled sport. In recognition of this, she was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1993 for service to athletics for the disabled. She was later appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2000 and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 2005, both for services to disabled sport. In 2010, Tanni became a life peer titled Baroness Grey-Thompson of Eaglescliffe in Stockon-On-Tees.\n\nSusannah Rodgers MBE (BA Modern Languages, 2005)\n\nSusannah Rodgers is a British Paralympic swimmer who has represented Team GB at two Paralympic Games - London 2012 and Rio 2016.\n\nAt her Paralympic debut in London, Susannah won 3 Bronze medals in the 400 metres freestyle, 100 metres freestyle, and 4x100 metres freestyle relay. She built on her success at the following Games in Rio winning a Gold medal in the women’s 50 metres butterfly S7 and Bronze medals in the women’s 400 metres and 50 metres freestyle.\n\nThroughout her career, Susannah has won a total of 30 international medals.
