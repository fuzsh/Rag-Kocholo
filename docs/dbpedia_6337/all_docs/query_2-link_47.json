        "text": "Chris Day\n\nMen's Track & Field 5/17/2023 2:13:00 PM by Chris Day\n\nArceneaux, Heide earn RMAC Athlete of the Year honors\n\nCMU track & field squads combine for 39 All-RMAC certificates\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.— Sierra Arceneaux and Dawson Heide both earned conference athlete of the year honors as a group of 29 Colorado Mesa University track and field athletes combined to win 39 All-Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference honors, officially announced by the conference this week.\n\nArceneaux was named as the RMAC Women's Track Athlete of the Year for the second straight year as the only Maverick to have ever receive the honor. Heide was selected as the RMAC Men's Field Athlete of the Year becoming the first Maverick man to receive a RMAC major track & field award. Those awards were selected by a vote conference's head coaches.\n\nThe All-RMAC honors are strictly based on athletes' finish at the RMAC Championships, which were contested Apr. 28-30 in Chadron, Nebraska, but were officially bestowed in conjunction with the announcement of the major award winners. The top three finishers in each individual event and each member of the winning relay teams earn first team honors while the fourth through sixth place individual finishers and the runner-up relay team members are named as Second Team All-RMAC performers.\n\nArceneaux, a redshirt senior from Aurora, Colorado, successfully defended her RMAC titles in both the 100 and 200-meter dashes and led the conference's season-long performers list in both of those events as well as the 400 meters. She also qualified for the NCAA Championships in both the 100 and 200 and was a provisional NCAA qualifier in the 400-meter dash and 4x100-meter relay. Her season-best 100-meter time was 11.49 seconds (11.52-altitude adjusted), just off her own school-record of 11.45, set en-route to the 2022 RMAC title.\n\nShe also set new school-records of 23.33 and 55.52 seconds in the 200 and 400 meters this year and helped the Mavs set a NCAA provisional qualifying time in the 4x100-meter relay. She did not run the 400 at the RMAC meet.\n\nHer 200-meter time ranks fifth in Division II this season.\n\nHeide, a redshirt junior in outdoor eligibility, set a new Maverick record of 7,207 points in the decathlon to win the Maverick Invite and qualify for next week's NCAA Division II Championships as the No. 5 seed.\n\nHis record score also led the RMAC season-long performance list.\n\nWith national qualification already assured, Heide did not contest the decathlon at the RMAC Championships but did score and earn Second Team All-RMAC honors in both the javelin throw and 110-meter hurdles, placing fourth in both events with marks of 55.10 meters (180-9) and 14.50 seconds, respectively.\n\nAll-RMAC Honors\n\nThe Maverick women, who set a program scoring record of 102 points, combined to win four events at the RMAC Championships and had First Team All-RMAC honorees and medalists in nine different events. Mica Jenrette won her third straight RMAC heptathlon title while Josie Coffey won a third career RMAC title in the high jump, her first outdoor win. Meanwhile, Jordan Burnett took second in the 400 meters while Kira MacGill (5K), Jordan Brockman (long jump), Kiana Jackson (triple jump) and Heather Yackey (discus throw) all took third.\n\nBrockman also earned three of CMU's six Second Team All-RMAC honors placing fifth in the high jump and in the heptathlon and sixth in the 100-meter hurdles. Averie Griffith placed fourth in the that event while MacGill was sixth in the 1,500 meters. Freshman Katie Thomson also earned her initial all-conference honor with a sixth place finish in the heptathlon.\n\nMeanwhile, the Maverick men took a program-best second at the RMAC Championships while scoring a program-record 125 ½ team points. They combined to earn 24 All-RMAC honors, including seven first team plaudits in six different events.\n\nJavelin champion Cameron Kalaf led that group while his freshman teammate Gavin Korkeakoski took second in that discipline. Meanwhile, Zace Buckhold earned first team honors in both the triple jump (second) and high jump (T-3rd) and added a fourth place finish and a Second Team All-RMAC honor in the long jump. Elijah Williams (100m), Zayden Davis (110m Hurdles) and Kelsey Montague (400m Hurdles) also earned First Team All-RMAC honors with bronze medal-winning performance in their respective events at the RMAC Championships.\n\nThe aforementioned Heide also earned two All-RMAC honors while Kade Christen and Williams both earned Second Team All-RMAC honors alongside Beau Thornton and Teo Casados in the 4x100-meter relay. Christensen also earned an individual honor, taking sixth in the 100-meter dash.\n\nTriston Charles (5K), Becker Ell (Pole Vault) and Hayden Riley (Shot Put) also joined Heide as fourth place finishers while Justin Blanton (400m), Logan Hafey (400m Hurdles), Mark Testa (3K Steeplechase), Eddie Kurjak (High Jump) and Justin Thompson (Long Jump) all placed fifth. Spencer Purnell also took sixth in the triple jump.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\nZace Buckhold\n\nJumps\n\n6' 1\"\n\nRedshirt Sophomore\n\nJr.\n\nTeo Casados\n\nSprints/Hurdles\n\n6' 1\"\n\nSophomore\n\nSo.\n\nTriston Charles\n\nDistance\n\n5' 8\"\n\nRedshirt Sophomore\n\nR-So.\n\nZayden Davis\n\nSprints/Hurdles\n\n6' 3\"\n\nRedshirt Sophomore\n\nJr.\n\nBecker Ell\n\nPole Vault\n\n5' 9\"\n\nSophomore\n\nSo.\n\nDawson Heide\n\nMultis\n\n6' 0\"\n\nRedshirt Senior\n\nR-Jr.\n\nCameron Kalaf\n\nThrows\n\n6' 3\"\n\nRedshirt Freshman\n\nSo.\n\nEddie Kurjak\n\nJumps\n\n6' 8\"\n\nSophomore\n\nSo.\n\nKelsey Montague\n\nSprints\n\n5' 8\"\n\nRedshirt Sophomore\n\nJr.\n\nSpencer Purnell\n\nJumps\n\n5' 9\"\n\nRedshirt Senior\n\nR-Sr."
