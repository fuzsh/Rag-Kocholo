The NCAA West Preliminary Round is scheduled for May 22-25 in Fayetteville, Ark.\n\nNorth Dakota's 2024 Summit League Outdoor Champions\n\nJustice Dick, 800m, 1:50.69\n\nLuke Labatte, 3,000m Steeplechase, 8:50.89\n\nJadyn Keeler, 3,000m Steeplechase, 10:28.86\n\nPost-Meet Notes\n\n* North Dakota finished the outdoor conference meet with three Summit League champions.

With the win, she not only earned All-Summit League honors but also broke her own school record in the process, shattering her record of 10:35.60, which she set at Stanford earlier this season.\n\n* On Saturday, Justina Esangbedo earned the bronze in the triple jump with a PR leap of 39-9 1/4 (12.12m). Her jump not only earned her the bronze, but also broke the school record of Jennifer Parent, who set the record at 39-7 3/4 (12.08m) at the 2022 Summit League Outdoor Championships.\n\n* Labatte won the 3,000-meter steeplechase on Friday night, winning the title in 8:50.89. With the win, he successfully defended his steeplechase titles from the 2022 and 2023 Summit League Outdoor Championships and became the first steeplechase runner to become a three-time champion at the meet since Jeff Mettler of South Dakota did it from 2012-14."
