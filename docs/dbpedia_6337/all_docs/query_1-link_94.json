        "text": "Aug. 8, 2008\n\nGo to the 'Marquette and the Olympics' home page\n\nBy: Michael Wittliff, Marquette Athletics Media Relations\n\nOn the 100th anniversary of John Brennan's participation in the 1908 Olympic Games in London, former Golden Eagle Dwyane Wade is making the trip with the U.S. men's basketball team to Beijing for the XXIX Olympiad.\n\nThe past century has seen a good number of current and former Marquette student-athletes achieve greatness in the Olympic Games. Ten athletes have participated in the Summer Olympics while numerous others have been involved in the Winter Games.\n\nJohn Brennan, a native of Ireland, was Marquette's first Olympic athlete when he traveled with the United States' delegation to London in 1908. This was a large feat for a man from Ireland who wanted badly to strike a blow to prestige of the British Empire.\n\nThat year the U.S. Olympic Trials were held in Chicago and Brennan impressed the U.S. Olympic Committee enough to be added to the roster for a trip across the Atlantic. At the trials, Brennan finished second in the broad jump (long jump) and won the hop, skip and jump (triple jump) by a fairly large margin.\n\nBrennan's first event in London was the broad jump in which he placed fifth with a distance of 22-6 1/4. The U.S. champion in each event was considered among the favorites to bring home a medal and it was Brennan's hope to win a gold in the hop, skip and jump. But the results in the marathon, the premier event of the competition, threw an interesting twist to the rest of the games for him.\n\nBrennan did not compete in the marathon but fellow Irish-American Johnny Hayes did. Hayes trailed Italian Dorando Pietri entering the stadium for the conclusion of the run but Pietri collapsed three times before being helped across the finish line by spectators. Upon a protest by the U.S.O.C., Hayes was awarded the gold medal and an evening of celebration by the U.S. delegation continued into the late hours of the morning.\n\nBrennan was happy to see Hayes win the marathon and celebrated alongside throughout the night. Unfortunately for Brennan, however, was the fact that the hop, skip and jump was at 10 a.m. the next morning. The event ended up being one of only three track and field events in which the U.S. did not claim a medal (The U.S. competed in 22 track and field events overall).\n\nTwenty years later in 1928 the Walter brothers, Jack and Pete, from Listowel, Ont., participated with the Canadian Olympic team in Amsterdam but it was not until 1932 that a Marquette student-athlete would bring home an Olympic medal.\n\nThe Olympic Games were held in Los Angeles in 1932 and Marquette sprinter Ralph Metcalfe looked to be the favorite in both the 100- and 200-meters after sweeping the events at the Olympic Trails. Metcalfe ended up finishing second in the 100, giving Marquette it's first Olympic medal following a heavily reviewed finish in which it appeared as though he broke the tape slightly ahead of fellow American Eddie Tolan. Metcalfe also brought home a bronze medal in the 200 after a wrongly staggered starting line put him a few yards behind the competition to start the race. Metcalfe took those disappointments in stride as he prepared for the next Olympic Games.\n\nIn 1936 at the Berlin Olympics, Metcalfe finally captured a gold medal, running a leg on the 4x100 relay team with fellow sprinter Jesse Owens. Metcalfe once again won silver in the 100, finishing second to Owens in one of the most highly publicized races in Olympic history.\n\nA second gold medal for a Marquette athlete came in 1952 when former basketball player Frank McCabe helped the U.S. win the basketball tournament in Helsinki by defeating the Soviet Union in the championship game.\n\nHigh jumper Ken Wiesner, a three-time NCAA champion in the event, also traveled to the Olympics in Helsinki, capturing a silver medal.\n\nIn 1956, John Bennett, who won two NCAA titles in the broad jump during his time at Marquette, brought home a silver medal from Melbourne with a jump of 25-2 1/4, the seventh total medal for a former Marquette athlete.\n\nIn those Melbourne Olympics and in the 1960 Games in Rome, Dale Lewis, who had played for the Marquette football team, competed in Greco-Roman wrestling but did not place either year. Lewis had left Marquette after one year to join the Marines and it was there that he learned to wrestle, making the 1956 Olympic squad only six months after taking up the sport. Upon his discharge from the military, Lewis enrolled at the University of Oklahoma and ended up winning two national titles on the mat before becoming a professional wrestler in the American Wrestling Association.\n\nFailing to receiving an invitation from the U.S. Olympic basketball team for a try-out, Alfred \"Butch\" Lee participated in the 1976 Olympic Games as a member of the Puerto Rican National Team. The U.S. realized they had made a mistake by excluding Lee after he scored 35 points and almost single-handedly defeated the U.S. team before ultimately falling in the final seconds, 95-94.\n\nThis year Marquette will once again be represented in the Olympics by former men's basketball player Dwyane Wade, a bronze medalist at the 2004 Athens Games. Olympic basketball in the 2008 Beijing games will run from Aug. 9-24 and hopefully conclude with another gold medal for a former Golden Eagle.\n\nMarquette Summer Olympians: 1908-2008\n\n1908 London\n\nJohn Brennan, Track and Field\n\n1928 Amsterdam\n\nJack Walter, Track and Field\n\nPete Walter Track and Field\n\n1932 Los Angeles\n\nRalph Metcalfe, Track and Field (silver and bronze medals)\n\n1936 Berlin\n\nRalph Metcalfe,Track and Field (gold and silver medals)\n\n1952 Helsinki\n\nFrank McCabe, Basketball (gold medal)\n\nKen Wiesner Track and Field (silver medal)\n\n1956 Melbourne\n\nJohn Bennett Track and Field (silver medal)\n\nDale Lewis Greco-Roman Wrestling\n\n1960 Rome\n\nDale Lewis Greco-Roman Wrestling\n\n1976 Montreal\n\nAlfred \"Butch\" Lee Basketball\n\n2004 Athens\n\nDwyane Wade Basketball (bronze medal)\n\n2008 Beijing\n\nDwyane Wade Basketball\n\nThose in Milwaukee who are interested in learning more about Brennan, Bennett and Metcalfe can view an exhibit dedicated to Marquette Olympians in the lobby of the Raynor Memorial Libraries on Marquette's campus."
