        "text": "The United States traditionally is the gold standard at the Olympic Games.\n\nEntering the 2024 Games, the U.S. had the most total medals, including the most gold. Those numbers are increasing daily at the 2024 Paris Olympics as members of Team USA reach the top of the podium.\n\nHere's a look back at each of those gold-medal wins for Team USA in Paris.\n\nJennifer Valente — Cycling, women's omnium\n\nShamier Little, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Gabby Thomas and Alexis Holmes — Track & Field, women's 4x400m relay\n\nParis 2024 Summer Olympics\n\nWatch all the action from the Paris Olympics live on NBC\n\nChristopher Bailey, Vernon Norwood, Bryce Deadmon and Rai Benjamin — Track & Field, men's 4x400m relay\n\nMasia Russell — Track & Field, women's 100m hurdles\n\nRai Benjamin — Track & Field, men's 400m hurdles\n\nRai Benjamin took the lead halfway through the 400m race and ran with it, winning gold with a season-best score of 46.46 seconds. Norway's Karsten Warholm came in second (47.06) and Brazil's Alison dos Santos in third (47.26).\n\nOlivia Reeves — Weightlifting, women's 71kg\n\nAt only 21 years old, Olivia Reeves won Team USA's second-ever gold in women's weightlifting and broke the Olympic record in the snatch at 117kg. The last American female weightlifting gold was won by Tara Nott-Cunningham in 2000. Colombia's Mari Leivis Sánchez earned silver, and Ecuador's Angie Paola Palacios Dajomes took bronze.\n\nMelissa Jefferson, Sha'Carri Richardson, Twanisha Terry, Gabrielle Thomas — Track & Field, women's 4x100m relay\n\nSha'Carri Richardson led Team USA to victory in the womens' 4x100m relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg. Richardson, Melissa Jefferson, TeeTee Terry and Gabby Thomas finished with a time of 41.78 seconds. Great Britain came in second at 41.85 seconds, with Germany third at 41.97 seconds.\n\nGrant Holloway — Track & Field, men's 110m hurdles\n\nGrant Holloway stormed across the finish line in his signature event, the 110m hurdles, winning his first Olympic gold in 12.99 seconds. Team USA's Daniel Roberts came in second (13.09), with Jamaica’s Rasheed Broadbell finishing third, less than three thousandths of a second behind Roberts.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone — Track & Field, women's 400m hurdles\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone dominated the 400m, notching a back-to-back Olympic gold and breaking the world record for a sixth time. McLaughlin-Levrone set a time of 50.37, with American Anna Cockrell winning silver at 51.87 and the Netherlands' Femke Bol in third at 52.15.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall — Track & Field, women's long jump\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall leaped her way to gold — her first Olympic medal — landing a distance of 7.10m in the women's long jump. Reigning champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany took silver with a jump measuring 6.98m. Team USA's Jasmine Moore earned bronze at 6.96m.\n\nSarah Hildebrandt — Wrestling, women's freestyle 50kg\n\nSarah Hildebrandt upgraded her Tokyo bronze in the women's freestyle 50kg event in Paris, earning her first Olympic gold medal. She defeated Cuba's Yusneylys Guzmán Lopez 3-0. Hildebrandt was initially slated to wrestle India's Vinesh Phogat, who beat Guzmán Lopez 5-0 in the semifinals, but Phogat was disqualified ahead of the finals for weighing 100 grams above the 50kg limit.\n\nQuincy Hall — Track & Field, men's 400m\n\nWith mere tenths of a second to go, Quincy Hall sprinted to the front of the pack in the final stretch of the men's 400m. He ran a personal best of 43.40 seconds, with Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith finishing in second at 43.44 seconds and Zambia's Muzala Samukonga in third at 43.74 seconds.\n\nChloe Dygert, Kristen Faulkner, Lily Williams, Jennifer Valente — Cycling Track, women's team pursuit\n\nThe women's pursuit team raced past New Zealand on the velodrome to win gold. Chloe Dygert, Kristen Faulkner, Lily Williams and Jennifer Valente put up a time of 4:04.306, days after Faulkner — who initially did not even qualify for the Olympics — took gold in road cycling and became the first American to win a road race medal in 40 years. Great Britain placed third.\n\nAmit Elor — Wresting, women's freestyle 68kg\n\nAt only 20 years old, Elor became America's youngest Olympic wrestling champion. She clinically dispatched her opponents — 10-2, 8-0, 10-0 — and wrestled to victory against Kyrgystan's Meerim Zhumanazarova in the final, winning 3-0.\n\nGabby Thomas — Track & Field, women's 200m\n\nGabby Thomas dominated the women's 200 meter final, upgrading her 2020 Tokyo bronze to a gold with a time of 21.83. Thomas was the prohibitive favorite after Jamaican rival Shericka Jackson withdrew from the race. The newly crowned 100m Olympic champion Julien Alfred came in second with a time of 22.08, and Team USA's Brittany Brown earned bronze (22.20).\n\nCole Hocker — Track & Field, men's 1500m\n\nIn an upset, Cole Hocker outran Britain's Josh Kerr and Norway's Jakob Ingebrigsten in the 1500m track meet. Hocker set a new Olympic record of 3:27.65. Kerr came in second (3:27.79), and Ingebrigsten finished fourth (3:28.24) behind American Yared Nuguse (3:27.80).\n\nCaroline Marks — Surfing, women's shortboard\n\nCaroline Marks surfed to victory in Tahiti, winning gold — her first Olympic medal after finishing in fourth place at the Tokyo Games. Marks secured a score of 10.50 over Brazilian Tatiana Weston-Webb, who took silver with a 10.33.\n\nValarie Allman — Track & Field, women's discus throw\n\nValarie Allman successfully defended her title as reigning champion of women's discus at the Olympics. The Delaware native's fourth throw, measuring at 69.70 meters, won her the gold medal. China's Feng Bin and Croatia's Sandra Elkasević each landed a throw of 67.51 meters, placing second and third, respectively.\n\nNoah Lyles — Track & Field, men's 100m\n\nNoah Lyles is now a gold-medal winner and the world's fastest man. He earned the hardware and the title by winning the men's 100m in a photo finish with a time of 9.79 seconds. The time was a new personal best to just barely edge Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by just five-thousandths of a second. Lyles is looking to become the first man to win gold in the 100m and 200m at the same Olympic Games since Usain Bolt.\n\nRegan Smith, Lilly King, Gretchen Walsh, Torri Huske — Swimming, women's 4x100m medley\n\nThe U.S. women's 4x100m medley relay team of Torri Huske, Gretchen Walsh, Regan Smith and Lilly King set a world record in 3:43.69 — and maintained world domination in swimming over rival Australia. The U.S. set the mark with a time of 3:49.63, easily defeating Australia, which finished second in 3:53.11. The win in the final swimming event of the Games gave the American swimming teams eight total golds in Paris, one more than Australia.\n\nBobby Finke — Swimming, men's 1500m freestyle\n\nIt was another gold medal and a new world record for Bobby Finke. The 24-year-old Floridian won his second-straight gold in the men's 1,500m freestyle, doing so in a record time of 14:30.67. That topped the previous mark of 14:31.02 set in 2012 by China's Sun Yang.\n\nKristen Faulkner — Cycling Road, women's\n\nKristen Faulkner became the first American rider in 40 years to win a medal in the women's cycling road race. The 31-year-old Alaska native completed the 158-kilometer (98-mile) route in a time of 3:49:23, finishing 58 seconds clear of her nearest competitor. Faulkner is the first American to win a road race medal of any color since the 1984 Los Angeles Games.\n\nScottie Scheffler — Golf, men's\n\nScottie Scheffler has now won a green jacket and a gold medal this year. The 2024 Masters champion won the men's individual stroke play golf tournament after shooting a -9 under final round of 62. He had nine birdies in the final round, setting an Olympic record for 72 holes at 19-under 265.\n\nRyan Crouser — Track & Field, men's shot put\n\nIt was an unprecedented threepeat for Ryan Crouser. He became the first Olympian to win a third-consecutive gold medal in men's shot put, making history with a 22.90m throw. The 31-year-old previously won gold at the 2016 Rio Games with an Olympic record throw of 22.52m. He broke that record at the Tokyo Olympics with a 23.30m throw.\n\nRyan Murphy, Nic Fink, Gretchen Walsh, Torri Huske — Swimming, mixed 4x100 medley relay\n\nThe United States 4x100m medley relay team won gold in record time. The winning time of 3:37.43 broke the world record of 3:37.58 set three years prior by Britain in the event’s Olympic debut. Ryan Murphy swam a 52.08-second time in backstroke, Nic Fink came in at 58.29 seconds in breaststroke, Gretchen Walsh took 55.18 seconds in butterfly and Torri Huske sealed gold with a 51.88-second time in freestyle.\n\nKatie Ledecky — Swimming, women's 800m freestyle\n\nThe Katie Ledecky 800m dynasty continues. The Team USA star captured her fourth-straight Olympic title in the women's 800m freestyle event, winning in a time of 8:11.04. With nine total gold medals, including three in Paris, Ledecky is now tied with swimmer Mark Spitz, track star Carl Lewis, Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina and Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi for second-most in Olympic history behind Michael Phelps (23).\n\nSimone Biles — Gymnastics, women's vault\n\nSimone Biles' Olympic medal count has reached double digits. The most decorated American gymnast of all time added to her total and her legacy by winning gold in women's vault. On her first vault, she performed her new signature skill, the Yurchenko double pike and scored a 15.700. She earned a 14.900 on her second vault for a total score of 15.300. That was more than enough for her 10th Olympic medal, which includes seven golds, one silver, and two bronze.\n\nVincent Hancock — Shooting, men's skeet\n\nThe master defeated the student. Vincent Hancock won his fourth Olympic gold medal in men's skeet by defeating Conner Prince, a first-time U.S. Olympian who Hancock coaches. Hancock hit 58 out of 60 shots to Prince's 57, including each of his last 26 targets. Hancock also won skeet gold at the Olympics in 2008, 2012 and 2021 and is the only skeet shooter to take the Olympic gold more than once.\n\nLee Kiefer, Lauren Scruggs, Jacqueline Dubrovich — Fencing, women's team foil\n\nTeam USA earned its first-ever team gold in Olympic fencing, besting Italy in a 45-39 final. In the women's individual foil Tuesday, Lee Kiefer placed first and Lauren Scruggs second. This is the first time the U.S. has won two fencing golds at the same Olympics.\n\nKate Douglass — Swimming, women's 200m breaststroke\n\nKate Douglass secured her first Olympic gold, setting an American record for the 200m breaststroke (2:19:24) and beating out South Africa’s Tatjana Smith, the 2020 champion. This marks Douglass’ third Olympic medal in the Paris Games.\n\nSimone Biles — Gymnastics, women's individual all-around\n\nSimone Biles' incomparable performance earned her a second Olympic all-around gold, making it the sixth straight Olympics where the U.S. has claimed the title. Biles is now the oldest women's gymnastics champion since 1952, and the first to win two all-around golds. Sunisa Lee, who won the individual all-around at the 2020 Tokyo Games, placed third. Brazil's Rebeca Andrade placed second.\n\nNick Mead, Justin Best, Michael Grady, Liam Corrigan — Rowing, men's four\n\nNick Mead, Justin Best, Michael Grady and Liam Corrigan powered the U.S. to gold in the men's four with a time of 5:49.03.
