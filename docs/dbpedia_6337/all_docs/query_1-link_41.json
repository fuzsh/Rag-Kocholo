Many critics say the Algerian should not be competing at the Games.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner, who won the 1976 men's decathlon as Bruce Jenner, says the ordeal has \"hurt\" the competition.\n\n\"This issue has hurt the Olympic Games so much. … Everyone's talking about it,\" Jenner told Fox News' \"The Story\" Friday, adding it has taken away from other accomplishments.\n\nJenner said Khelif should not be in a women's category.\"I hate to be so downright rough … but we have to have rules and regulations, and it has to come down to DNA,\" she said, saying those with XY chromosomes should be in a men's competition.\n\n\"I think the Olympic committee did absolutely the wrong thing by letting [Khelif] compete,\" Jenner added. \"Shame on the IOC for not protecting the integrity of women's sports, and shame on the IOC for not protecting the safety of women's sports.\n\nPosted by Ryan Morik Share\n\nOlympic sprinter finishes race, turns back to help opponent who collapsed\n\nThe spirit of the Olympics was on full display during the first day of the track and field events in Paris Friday.\n\nLaotian sprinter Silinia Pha Aphay and Lucia Moris of South Sudan were side by side in the first heat of the women’s 100-meter prelim, competing for a top three spot to advance to the first round.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Pha Aphay noticed around the halfway mark that Moris, who was in the lane next to her, had gone down.\n\nPha Aphay crossed the finish line with a season best of 12.45 seconds, but it wasn’t enough to crack the top three. But that didn't matter.\n\nPha Aphay turned back to check on Moris, who appeared to be grabbing her right leg while shouting in pain. Pha Aphay ran over and called out for medics, who eventually rushed to Moris' side before carrying her off the purple track on a stretcher.\n\n\"We are athletes,\" Pha Aphay said, via The Post. \"We are 100 meters — the same. All 100 meters athletes have to know how being hurt feels. And this is a big competition. It’s a big dream to come here. But you get hurt here.
