        "text": "Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nWhen the Olympics end, athletes don't repeat the highly regimented parade of the opening ceremony. For the closing, they sort of wander in, mingling with other nationalities. It's all part of a plan hatched 65 years ago by a teenager. Despite being credited with saving the Games from disaster, for decades, few people knew his name.\n\nIn the closing ceremony, the athletes walk \"en masse and in no particular order,\" officials for the Tokyo Games said, making the final parade much more casual and easygoing than the highly scripted opener. In Sunday's ceremony, Olympians wandered in, chatting with other delegations and pausing to take photos together, blending national colors.\n\nSo, why did the often stodgy Olympics decide to accept randomness?\n\n\"The idea of having all the athletes parade in no order comes from a young Chinese man, John Ian Wing, an apprentice carpenter in Australia for the 1956 Games in Melbourne,\" Tokyo organizers said in their notes for the closing ceremony. \"Before these Games, the athletes had always marched behind their flag-bearer, as at the Opening Ceremony.\"\n\nThe idea was sparked by an international crisis\n\nThe 1956 Melbourne Games famously teetered toward chaos rather than unity as international discord spilled over into the athletes' showcase. In Europe, post-war tensions hit a new peak as the Games began, with the Soviet Union sending tanks into Hungary to crush a national uprising. Elsewhere, Egypt and Israel were at the center of the Suez Crisis, prompting boycotts by Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon. China also boycotted because of the inclusion of Taiwan (as \"Formosa-China\").\n\nEven before the Games began, organizers had faced calls to cancel the Olympics. Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands also boycotted. Some countries who participated ordered their athletes not to mix with other delegations in the Olympic Village, according to the Olympic Museum in Germany.\n\nThen came the infamous \"Blood in the Water\" water polo match — a contest between Hungary and the Soviet Union that turned vicious. As violence broke out in the water, the scene threatened to become an all-out brawl among athletes and team officials.\n\n\"The match had to be stopped,\" historian David Wallechinsky told NPR. \"There was a famous photograph of one of the Hungarians emerging from the pool, with blood streaming down his face.\"\n\nThe Soviet force had arrived in Hungary in early November — the same time as the Summer Olympics, which were aligned with the Southern Hemisphere's seasons.\n\n\"The Hungarian Olympic team only heard about the developments back home after arriving in Melbourne,\" as Katie Cella has written for NPR, \"and then promptly tore down the Hungarian flag with the communist insignia in the Olympic Village, raising the free Hungarian flag in its place.\"\n\nWith the Olympic ideals of camaraderie and respect in jeopardy, organizers faced a quandary about how to conclude the Games.\n\nAn anonymous letter suggests ''only one nation''\n\nWith the Melbourne Games threatened by disarray, Wing, a 17-year-old Australian of Chinese descent, wrote to organizers with his idea for how to end the Olympics peacefully.\n\n\"I was observing all what was going on and it saddened me to see politicians were using the Olympics for their political gains and the athletes were a 'pawn' in their game,\" Wing later said. \"It was pointless to scream and shout at politicians because it goes in one ear and out the other ear. But I remembered an old saying, 'The pen is mightier than the sword.' \"\n\nThe goal for the final parade, Wing said in his letter to Olympics officials, should be for the athletes to walk together — as \"only one nation.\"\n\nKirk McKoy/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nWing sent his anonymous letter to Sir W.S. Kent Hughes, chairman of the Melbourne organizers' committee. He wrote: \"I believe it has been suggested that a march should be put on during the Closing Ceremony, and you said it couldn't be done. I think it can be done.\"\n\nIf all countries' athletes march together, Wing said, \"there will be only one nation. War, politics and nationality will be all forgotten.\" He added, \"Well you can do it in a small way. ... No team is to keep together, and there should be no more than two team-mates together.\"\n\nHughes liked Wing's idea — and it was adopted, just one day before the closing ceremony was to take place.\n\nWing succeeded in helping the Melbourne Olympics close out on a positive note. But his identity remained a mystery for decades. After being identified and contacted by an Australian journalist in 1986, he was honored by International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch. A street in the Sydney 2000 Olympic Village was named after him.\n\n\"I didn't put my name or address to the letter in case someone thought it was a daft idea,\" Wing said, according to comments published by the Olympic Museum. After his idea became a new Olympic tradition, he opted not to tell anyone, thinking they wouldn't believe him.\n\nOlympics go from bloody to the ''Friendly Games''\n\nWing also wrote a second letter to Hughes, giving his name and address but asking to remain anonymous. It was that note that, once discovered, publicly uncovered Wing's identity.\n\nWing later said that Hughes acknowledged his contribution in a unique way. Shortly after the Olympics were over, Wing told The Age newspaper, he was in his father's restaurant when a waiter told him he had a visitor. There, a man in formal attire handed him a plastic case, containing an Olympic bronze medal.\n\n\"It is from Mr. Kent Hughes,\" the man said as he left.\n\nThanks to Wing's innovation and the calm that had pervaded the Games before the tussle between the Soviet Union and Hungary, the Melbourne Olympics soon came to be known as the \"Friendly Games.\"\n\nWhen the intermingled athletes marched into the stadium in Melbourne for the closing ceremony, a huge sign above them declared: \"The 1956 Olympic race is run. May all who have been present go forth to their homelands and may the Olympic spirit go with them.\"\n\nWally Skalij/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nTOKYO — They were called the \"COVID Olympics.\" The \"pandemic Olympics.\" The \"anger Olympics.\" Many Japanese people were upset to host such a huge and risky event in the middle of the pandemic, and many outside observers were surprised it happened at all.\n\nBut as the Tokyo Games close out inside these quiet and largely fan-less venues, records were set, history was made, and heartwarming moments of underdogs prevailing were streamed onto smartphones and beamed to televisions in homes around the world.\n\nNPR's team in Tokyo put together our favorite moments of the Games, where participants showed their athleticism, sportsmanship, and what motivated them to compete.\n\nYou can jump to a moment here:\n\nAllyson Felix becomes the most decorated woman and U.S. athlete in track and field history.\n\nTwo high jumpers decide to share gold.\n\nU.S. shot putter Raven Saunders defies the ban on podium protests.\n\nU.S. wrestler Tamyra Mensah-Stock cries holding the U.S. flag.\n\nSimone Biles mounts a comeback after withdrawing to focus on mental health.\n\nU.S. gymnasts band together and take silver in the team event.\n\nCaeleb Dressel is taking home five gold medals in swimming.\n\nKatie Ledecky defies doubters early in the Olympics and finishes on top.\n\nA runner falls in a 1,500 meter race — and still wins.\n\nA 14-year-old Chinese diver scores two perfect 10s.\n\nJapan makes a statement in skateboarding's Olympic debut.\n\nU.S. women's basketball takes its seventh gold medal in a row.\n\nA Tunisian swimmer mounts an upset and shocks the swimming world.\n\nJapan wins gold in the sport of Karate as it makes its Olympic debut.\n\nAllyson Felix becomes the most decorated woman and U.S. athlete in track and field history\n\nThe gold medal U.S. track star Allyson Felix earned on Saturday in the 4 x 400 meter relay marked a huge milestone — it made her the most decorated U.S. athlete in track and field history.\n\nFelix has won 10 other Olympic medals and competed in five Olympics.\n\nThe night before, she won a bronze medal in the individual 400 meter race, breaking the record for the most Olympic medals for a female track and field athlete.\n\n\"This one is very different, and it's very special. And it just took a lot to get here,\" Felix said after the race.\n\nShe said she knew there were people who doubted whether she could make the team this time around, let alone medal. But on Friday, the 35-year-old went out and ran the second-fastest 400 meter race of her career.\n\nPatrick Smith/Getty Images\n\nTwo high jumpers decide to share gold\n\n​​It was the moment that melted hearts around the globe. Two high jumpers competed for hours but neither bested the other. Instead of heading into a tie-breaking jump off Qatar's Mutaz Essah Barshim asked \"Can we share the Gold?\"\n\nWhen the answer came back yes, Italy's Gianmarco Tamberi jumped into Barshim's arms on the track. Both had suffered through near career ending injuries, both had come back at their best. Through years of competition the two became close friends. On the podium together they clasped hands and raised them in the air.\n\n\"I know for a fact that for the performance I did, I deserve that gold. He did the same thing, so I know he deserved that gold,\" Barshim said afterward. \"This is beyond sport. This is the message we deliver to the young generation.\" A message of sportsmanship and love.\n\n\"You can't believe the emotion, the dream, of a gold medal to somebody who sacrificed his entire life for this and it was just amazing and sharing with a friend is even more,\" Tamberi said.\n\nIna Fassbender/AFP via Getty Images\n\nU.S. shot putter Raven Saunders defies the ban on podium protests\n\nU.S. shot putter and silver medalist Raven Saunders was a social media sensation at the Tokyo Games with her \"Hulk\" persona and larger-than-life personality. She used her platform to represent her multi-faceted identity as a Black gay woman who'd struggled with depression so deeply that she contemplated suicide.\n\nShe also became the first Olympian to defy Rule 50 at the Tokyo Games. That rule bars competitors from protesting on the podium. When her medal was around her neck and the gold medalist from China's anthem was complete, Saunders briefly crossed her arms above her head in the shape of an X. She said it represented the \"intersection where all oppressed people meet.\" Afterward U.S. fencer Race Imboden accepted his bronze medal with a small \"x\" drawn on the back of his hand to protest Rule 50.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee is under increasing pressure to change the rule, critics call it a violation of competitors' rights to free speech. Olympic organizers at first said they were looking into Saunders' gesture on the podium. But the inquiry was suspended when Saunders got the devastating news that her mother had died days after her medal ceremony.\n\nTom Pennington/Getty Images\n\nU.S. wrestler Tamyra Mensah-Stock cries holding the U.S. flag\n\nU.S. wrestler Tamyra Mensah-Stock won the women's 68-kilogram freestyle final, becoming the first Black woman — and only the second woman — to take gold in Olympic wrestling for the U.S.\n\nShe was competing against Nigerian athlete Blessing Oborududu.\n\nMensah-Stock said she hopes her boundary-breaking win can help inspire the next generation of wrestlers.\n\n\"These young women are going to see themselves in a number of ways and look up and go, 'I can do that, I can see myself'. Look at this natural hair. Come on. Man, I've got my puffballs out, so they can know that they can do it too,\" Mensah-Stock said. \"I know the future for women's wrestling is bright and growing immensely.\"\n\nAfter her win, she made a heart-shaped gesture with her hands and hugged her coaches. Then, she held a large U.S. flag over her head.\n\n\"I'm feeling very happy and I keep trying not to cry, but it keeps happening,\" she said, according to a release from Team USA. \"I just want to go into a dark room and cry, but I'm crying from joy.\"\n\nAdrian Wyld/AP\n\nSimone Biles mounts a comeback after withdrawing to focus on mental health\n\nU.S. gymnastics star Simone Biles triumphantly returned to competition on the last day of women's artistic gymnastics, winning a bronze medal after taking time she needed for her mental health.\n\nEarlier in the Games, Biles withdrew after the first vault of the team final, saying she didn't feel confident that she could perform and didn't want to risk an injury or a medal for the team. She said she was dealing with a terrifying phenomenon known as the \"twisties,\" when a gymnast feels lost in the air, and received an outpouring of support from her team, other athletes, and fans.\n\nBiles also withdrew from the individual all-around final, and three of the four individual apparatus finals.\n\n\"It wasn't easy pulling out of all those competitions. I physically and mentally wasn't in the right headspace and I didn't want to jeopardize my health or my safety because at the end of the day it's not worth it,\" Biles said. \"My mental and physical health is above all medals that I could ever win.\"\n\nWhen she competed on the beam, she was still dealing with the twisties — but altered her routine so they didn't affect her as much.\n\n\"I wasn't expecting to walk away with a medal. I was just going out there to do this for me and whatever happens, happens,\" Biles said after the competition. She added that it \"just meant the world to be back out there.\"\n\nMartin Bureau/AFP via Getty Images\n\nU.S. gymnasts band together and take silver in the team event\n\nWhen Biles pulled out of the team final, her teammates fully supported her decision.\n\nIt also posed a huge challenge for them. Mid-competition, the three first-time Olympians had to come up with a new plan to get through the difficult gauntlet of events, all the while worried about their teammate and friend.\n\nAnd they stepped up. Jordan Chiles took Biles' place on the uneven bars and balance beam and Sunisa Lee competed on the floor exercise.\n\nAt the end of the night, the gymnasts had pulled off a stellar showing without the cornerstone of their team, second only to the group from Russia.\n\n\"There was definitely a lot of emotions going through all of our heads, but I'm really proud that we were able to step up to the plate and do what we needed to do,\" said Lee. \"It's very hard to lose a teammate, especially at the Olympic Games, so I was really proud of all of us.\"\n\nLee also took home a gold medal in the individual all-around final, where Biles had been a favorite to win before she pulled out.\n\nMaddie Meyer/Getty Images\n\nCaeleb Dressel is taking home five gold medals in swimming\n\nU.S. star swimmer Caeleb Dressel, 24, came into these Olympics with high expectations but no individual Olympic medals. He's leaving with three golds in individual events and two golds in relays.\n\nDressel broke his own world record in the 100 meter butterfly and was part of a world record-setting team in the 4x100 medley relay.\n\nHe set Olympic records in the 100 meter freestyle and the 50 meter freestyle — a mad sprint that is just one length of the pool. And he led off the gold medal-winning men's 4x100 meter freestyle relay.\n\n\"I think the U.S. has been so dominant for so long, to put my stamp on the sport is very special,\" he said on the last day of Olympic swimming.\n\nTom Pennington/Getty Images\n\nKatie Ledecky defies doubters early in the Olympics and finishes on top\n\nWhat Dressel did in Tokyo, Ledecky did at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. She had her breakout Games, winning four golds — three of them individual — and becoming invincible in the eyes of the world. Of course no one is truly that; athletes, as we've learned so well at these Games, are human beings. And so when Ledecky finished second and fifth in her first two Tokyo events, the \"what's wrong with Katie?\" narrative emerged.\n\nThe answer, of course, was nothing. She ended up winning two gold medals and two silvers — a sublime haul for any athlete. But through Ledecky, we were reminded again about the weight of Olympic expectations.\n\n\"Every move you make is being watched and judged,\" she said, \"and as much as we say that we try to ignore it, I think some of that is just trying to keep that positive mindset and move forward.\"\n\nThose are words of wisdom, and good advice for Dressel as he approaches Paris 2024 and the likely expectation that he'll be invincible.\n\nMichael Steele/Getty Images; Jewel Samad/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA runner falls in a 1,500 meter race — and still wins\n\nDutch runner Sifan Hassan had just entered the final lap of her 1,500-meter heat, where she was a medal favorite. Suddenly, the runner in front of her fell, bringing her down too.\n\nWith 11 runners in front of her and a huge gap to make up, Hassan stood up and started reeling them in. On the final straightaway, she passed five of the fastest runners in world, winning the heat.\n\n\"Believe me, it was horrible, but sometimes I think bad things happen for good. When I fell down I said to myself, OK life doesn't always go the way that you want,\" she said. \"After that I felt like somebody who drank 20 cups of coffee. I couldn't calm myself down.\"\n\nShe went on to win bronze in the final — a medal she wouldn't have without managing to pull off the near-impossible in the qualifying race. She also took gold in the 5,000 meters and the 10,000 meters.\n\nTom Pennington/Getty Images\n\nA 14-year-old Chinese diver scores two perfect 10s\n\n14-year-old diving prodigy Quan Hongchan competed in her first Olympics, and already attained perfection.\n\nAnd she did it twice, with two dives that received unanimous perfect scores from the judges' panel in the 10-meter platform event.\n\nThis was her first international competition. When it became clear she was the winner, her coach lifted her in the air as she laughed and smiled.\n\n\"I was a little nervous, but not very, just a little bit,\" she said, and thanked her parents watching back home in China. \"I want to thank them for encouraging me, encouraging me to relax and telling me to just go for my dives freely because it doesn't matter whether I get a medal or not.\"\n\nIn a third dive, she earned six 10s and one 9.5. Since the two highest and two lowest scores are discarded to calculate the final score, it was also effectively a perfect dive.\n\nJapan makes a statement in skateboarding's Olympic debut\n\nDespite the fact that Japan officials frown on the sport and there are signs around Tokyo warning \"No Skateboarding,\" teen athletes from Japan won three gold medals and a silver medal in the skateboarding competitions that debuted during the Games. They dominated in a sport that originated in Southern California.\n\nDuring the first ever Olympic street skateboarding contest, 22-year-old Yuto Horigome won gold. In the neighborhood where he had grown up, Horigome expertly flipped his board in the air, sailing over staircases and gliding on rails. He executed a difficult \"nollie 270 noseslide,\" flipping his board, then sliding it down the rail on its nose.\n\nThe following day, 13-year-old Momiji Nishiya became Japan's youngest gold medalist ever when she won the women's street skateboarding competition.\n\nIn the park skateboarding contest, Sakura Yosozumi, 19, claimed gold, soaring through the valleys and up walls of the curved concrete course. She grinded her board on the lip of the course, and soared over it with mid-air tricks, rotating 540 degrees. Afterwards, she told reporters her family had built a small skatepark for her at home, and that's where she practiced to get good enough to win the gold medal.\n\nYosozumi scored slightly higher than her teammate, Kokona Hiraki. The 12-year-old earned the silver medal in the park skateboarding competition.\n\nU.S. women's basketball takes its seventh gold medal in a row\n\nThere seem to be two certainties about women's basketball at the Olympics: The U.S. won't lose a game and will win gold. Both of those happened again in Tokyo. The U.S. rolled through the tournament winning all six games it played and earning its seventh gold medal in a row. The U.S. has now won a remarkable 55 Olympic straight games dating to the 1992 Barcelona Games.\n\nThe team was led by a powerhouse group of WNBA stars including Diana Taurasi and Sue Bird (who won their fifth gold medals — the first basketball players to do so), Brittney Griner (who scored a record 30 points in an Olympic gold medal game), Breanna Stewart, A'ja Wilson, Tina Charles and Sylvia Fowles.\n\nDawn Staley won her first gold medal as a coach, having won three golds as a player.\n\nWhile the lineup will inevitably be different at the Paris Games in 2024, it seems very likely that the U.S. will find a way to win and be golden again.\n\nMaddie Meyer/Getty Images\n\nA Tunisian swimmer mounts an upset and shocks the swimming world\n\nAn 18-year-old Tunisian managed to pull off a surprise upset in the 400 meter freestyle swimming event, winning the fifth gold medal ever for his country.\n\nAhmed Hafnaoui erupted in jubilation when he realized he won in the extremely tight race, pumping his fists and placing both hands on his brow as he took in the victory.\n\nHe seemed genuinely shocked at the result: \"I just can't accept that — it is too incredible.\"\n\nHafnaoui came into the race with the slowest qualifying time of the eight swimmers — but he touched the wall first, beating out Australia's Jack McLoughlin by just 0.16 seconds. Kieran Smith from the U.S. took bronze, about a half-second behind the winner.\n\nWhen Hafnaoui was asked by NBC how he kept his lead, he simply said: \"I don't know, I just put my hand in the water, that's it.\" The swimmer seemed at a loss for words. Shaking his head, he said, \"it's a dream that became true.\"\n\nElif Ozturk Ozgoncu/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nJapan wins gold in the sport of Karate as it makes its Olympic debut\n\nAfter decades of trying for Olympic inclusion, Karate made its debut at the Tokyo Olympics. Three-time world champion Ryo Kiyuna rewarded his native country with a gold medal.\n\nKiyuna won men's kata, one of two martial arts disciplines contested at these Games (the sparring event \"kumite\" was the other) that's particularly mesmerizing. It involves a lone competitor executing highly stylized and controlled movements and crisp, violent punches against an imaginary opponent. Some of the moves are punctuated by fierce screams.\n\nKiyuna's victory was memorable for two reasons: he's a native of Okinawa, where karate originated centuries ago; and on the medal stand he held a framed photo of his mother, who died two years ago.\n\n\"I felt I wanted to report my triumph to [her]\" he said afterwards.\n\nAs dramatic as karate's debut was, it's the only one of these Olympics' new sports (climbing, surfing, skateboarding and 3-on-3 basketball are the others) that won't be on the program at the next Summer Games in 2024, in Paris. For Karate fans, it's an unfortunate decision, especially since the martial art is popular in France and throughout the world.\n\nJeff Pachoud/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHome field advantage is known in sports for giving athletes competing on their own turf an edge over their opponents. It seems to still hold true even at the highest levels of competition, including the Olympics.\n\nJapan, who is hosting this year's games, has far surpassed its gold medal count from the previous Summer Olympics in Rio in 2016.\n\nData shows, almost without exception, that Olympic athletes from the host country end up on the podium more often and take home more gold medals in the summer games than they did when they were competing away from home.\n\nBut if all the Olympians are sleeping on the same cardboard beds, eating the same Olympic Village food, training on the same equipment and duking it on the same course or in the same swimming pool, why do some athletes have an edge over others?\n\nIt turns out there are lots of reasons home team athletes get a boost. And in the Olympics in particular, the deck is stacked even higher in favor of the host country.\n\nHome field advantage is real, athletes and experts say\n\nOne of the biggest pluses to competing at home is the positive energy from a supportive crowd, athletes say. (That is somewhat out the window at this year's Olympics, where fans were banned from entering facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n\nBriana Scurry, a former goalie for the U.S. women's national soccer team, said playing in the U.S. during the 1996 Summer Olympics helped the squad beat China to win gold that year.\n\n\"We had 76,000 people at the final in Athens, Georgia, all cheering for us. And China had, literally, a little tiny section of red up high in the nosebleed seats,\" she said.\n\nThree years later, during the 1999 Women's World Cup in California, Scurry said the home field advantage pushed the team to play better again. During the final, Scurry herself made an iconic save in the game-deciding shootout, deflecting the ball with her fingertips, helping the team win the championship.\n\n\"[The] times where I haven't really felt exceptionally energized, if I think about it, are the times usually when we weren't the home-based team. We were overseas and playing,\" she said.\n\nLoading...\n\nAnother factor that can hurt athletes from different places, especially other countries, is travel. International competitions such as the Olympics often require long flights across multiple time zones, which can give athletes jet lag and impact their sleep.\n\nForeign athletes may also be unaccustomed to the food and training equipment available at the competition. Even the weather, such as the oppressive humidity right now in Tokyo, may throw off a competitor used to a different climate.\n\nFor some athletes, though, the disadvantage to playing away may be more nebulous. It could simply be the feeling of being off in a new place.\n\n\"When we compete at home, we're comfortable. We're familiar with our surroundings, and that gives us some confidence. We know our course. We know the stadium we're performing in. We know the crowds that are there are generally cheering, hopefully, for us to do well,\" said Tim Baghurst, director of FSU COACH, the athletic coaching center at Florida State University.\n\n\"Now flip that, and you go somewhere where maybe the crowd base is more hostile. You haven't prepared the same way. Maybe the equipment to warm up isn't available that you're usually used to warming up with. Now we have that uncertainty of, 'maybe I'm not prepared for this.' And that little bit of doubt creeps in,\" he added.\n\n\"Theoretically it should be no different, but we know that it is.\"\n\nOlympic host countries get an even bigger boost\n\nThe home field advantage is dialed up even higher for the Olympics, where host countries are afforded additional benefits to help their athletes succeed.\n\nCompetitors from host countries have to meet lower qualification standards than their foreign peers, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nThat may contribute to the phenomenon of host countries sending much bigger squads to their Olympics than the previous summer games when they competed abroad.\n\nLoading...\n\nJapan got yet another benefit this year thanks to an Olympic rule change. A new policy adopted by the The International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2016 allows the organizing committee for the host country to propose several new sporting events for their games.\n\nIt meant that baseball and softball, karate, skateboarding, sports climbing and surfing — all popular sports in Japan — were Olympic events in Tokyo. And Japanese athletes have already medaled in four of the five sports, at times crushing the competition.\n\nHistory shows host countries perform better\n\nIn every Summer Olympics since 1952, with two exceptions, the host country has won more medals than it did in the previous summer games.\n\nSo far this year, Japan nabbed 10 more medals than it did in 2016. In the 2008 games in Beijing, China won 100 medals, 37 more than it took home in 2004. (Finland, in 1952, and the United States, in 1996, saw their medal counts drop at home.)\n\nHost countries not only win more medals; they take home the top prize more often, too. Since 1952 only two countries (including Finland, again) have failed to improve on their previous gold medal counts when they hosted the summer games.\n\nWith the Tokyo Olympics still underway, Japan has already bested its 2016 gold medal tally. Brazil took home seven golds in 2016, more than double its previous haul.\n\nLoading...\n\nBaghurst, the Florida State University professor, says it pays for host country athletes to do well. It likely means more money for the IOC and the host country through merchandise and other sales. It also makes for a buzzier, more enjoyable competition for that country's citizens, who not only have to put up with the disruptions caused by the Olympics but also may want to take part in what is a rare, even patriotic-feeling, event.\n\n\"When there is success in an event at home, more people are talking about it, more people are coming to watch\" he said. \"It just increases that fervor and interest in what's going on.\""
