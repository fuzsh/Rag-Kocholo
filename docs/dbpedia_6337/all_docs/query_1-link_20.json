The U.S. has won the most gold medals of any country in Olympics history and had the most in the past three Summer Olympics.\n\nAnd the U.S. didn't disappoint, coming away with 40 gold medals – tied with China for most overall. The USA came away with a record-setting haul of 126 total medals.\n\n➤ Get Olympics updates in your texts!
