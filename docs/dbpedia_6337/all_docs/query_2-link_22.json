        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (theACC.com) – The Atlantic Coast Conference continues to dominate the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Over the first half of the games, the ACC leads all conferences throughout the NCAA and would rank second among all countries, trailing just the United States.\n\nOver the course of the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, ACC student-athletes have combined to win 58 medals, including 20 gold, 22 silver and 16 bronze. Stanford leads all NCAA institutions with 22 total medals, while Virginia ranks second with 13 and California is tied for third with eight. Eight ACC member institutions have claimed at least one medal while 17 of the ACC’s 18 members have a participating representative at the Olympic Games.\n\nThroughout the weekend, the ACC continued to dominate the La-Defense Arena pool. Swimmers from ACC member institutions contributed to two separate world records over the weekend, including the women’s 4x100-meter medley relay and the mixed 4x100-meter medley relay. The women’s medley relay featured Stanford’s Torri Huske and Regan Smith alongside Virginia’s Gretchen Walsh. Huske and Walsh also swam on the mixed medley relay team and teamed with Cal’s Ryan Murphy.\n\nIn addition to winning gold medals in the pair of medley relays, Stanford alum Katie Ledecky won her ninth career gold medal in the women’s 800-meter freestyle, moving into a tie for second place for the most gold medals ever by an American athlete.\n\nOn the track, Stanford’s Grant Fisher became just the second American to medal in the 10,000-meter run in the past 60 years.\n\nThe ACC has launched a microsite dedicated entirely to the 2024 Olympic Games and covering the participants with ties to the league. With links to stories, school-specific coverage, medal tracking, social media and more, the ACC will provide comprehensive coverage throughout the Olympic games. The site also includes an ACC Olympic spot which can be found HERE.\n\nA full list of Olympians with ties to the ACC can be found HERE.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the medals won by those affiliated with the league members of the ACC as of August 1:\n\nGold Medals (20*)\n\nJack Alexy, USA – Cal (Men’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay)\n\nKatharine Berkoff, USA - NC State (Women’s 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nKate Douglass, USA - Virginia (Women’s 200m Breaststroke)\n\nKate Douglass, USA – Virginia (Women’s 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nChris Guiliano, USA – Notre Dame (Men’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay)\n\nRyan Held, USA – NC State (Men’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay)\n\nTorri Huske, USA – Stanford (Women’s 100m Butterfly)\n\nTorri Huske, USA – Stanford (Mixed 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nTorri Huske, USA – Stanford (Women’s 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nMatt King, USA – Virginia** (Men’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay)\n\nLee Kiefer, USA – Notre Dame (Women’s Individual Foil)\n\nLee Kiefer, USA – Notre Dame (Women’s Team Foil)\n\nVivian Kong, Hong Kong, China – Stanford (Women’s Épée)\n\nKatie Ledecky, USA – Stanford (Women’s 800m Freestyle)\n\nKatie Ledecky, USA – Stanford (Women’s 1,500m Freestyle)\n\nRyan Murphy, USA – Cal (Mixed 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nRegan Smith, USA – Stanford (Women’s 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nGretchen Walsh, USA – Virginia (Mixed 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nGretchen Walsh, USA – Virginia (Women’s 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nEmma Weber, USA – Virginia (Women’s 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nSilver Medals (22)\n\nJack Alexy, USA – Cal (Men’s 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nKassidy Cook, USA – Stanford (3M Synchronized Springboard Diving)\n\nKate Douglass, USA – Virginia (Women’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay)\n\nKate Douglass, USA – Virginia (Women’s 200m Individual Medley)\n\nCaileigh Filmer, Canada – Cal (Women’s Eight Rowing)\n\nChris Guiliano, USA - Notre Dame (Men’s 4x200m Freestyle Relay)\n\nTorri Huske, USA - Stanford (Women’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay)\n\nTorri Huske, USA – Stanford (Women’s 100m Freestyle)\n\nKatie Ledecky, USA – Stanford (Women’s 4x200m Freestyle Relay)\n\nOllie Maclean, New Zealand – Cal (Men’s Four Rowing)\n\nPaige Madden, USA – Virginia (Women’s 4x200m Freestyle Relay)\n\nSimone Manuel, USA – Stanford (Women’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay)\n\nSimone Manuel, USA – Stanford (Women’s 4x200m Freestyle Relay)\n\nRyan Murphy, USA – Cal (Men’s 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nSydney Payne, Canada – Cal (Women’s Eight Rowing)\n\nDiana Shnaider, Italy – NC State (Women’s Tennis Doubles)\n\nRegan Smith, USA – Stanford (Women’s 100m Backstroke)\n\nRegan Smith, USA – Stanford (Women’s 200m Butterfly)\n\nGretchen Walsh, USA – Virginia (Women’s 100m Butterfly)\n\nGretchen Walsh, USA – Virginia (Women’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay)\n\nAbbey Weitzeil, USA – Cal (Women’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay)\n\nBronze Medals (16*)\n\nKatharine Berkoff, USA – NC State (Women’s 100m Backstroke)\n\nGrant Fisher, USA – Stanford (Men’s 10,000m Run)\n\nHans Henken, USA – Stanford (Men’s Sailing Skiff)\n\nAsher Hong, USA – Stanford (Men’s Team Artistic Gymnastics)\n\nNick Itkin, USA - Notre Dame (Men’s Individual Foil)\n\nKatie Ledecky, USA – Stanford (Women’s 400m Freestyle)\n\nHeidi Long, Great Britain – Virginia (Women’s Eight Rowing)\n\nPaige Madden, USA – Virginia (Women’s 800m Freestyle)\n\nBrody Malone, USA – Stanford (Men’s Team Artistic Gymnastics)\n\nRowan McKellar, Great Britain – Cal (Women’s Eight Rowing)\n\nEsther Muhari, Hungary – Notre Dame (Women’s Épée)\n\nRyan Murphy, USA – Cal (Men’s 100m Backstroke)\n\nChristian Tabash, USA – Cal (Men’s Eight Rowing)\n\nNaya Tapper, USA – North Carolina (Women’s Sevens Rugby)\n\nHattie Taylor, Great Britain – Syracuse (Women’s Eight Rowing)\n\nEmma Weyant, USA - Virginia** (Women’s 400m Individual Medley)\n\n** Matt King and Emma Weyant are being recognized by the NCAA as ACC Olympic medal winners, despite transferring from the University of Virginia.\n\nOthers (3)\n\nHunter Armstrong, USA - Cal (Gold - Men’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay)\n\nHunter Armstrong, USA – Cal (Silver – Men’s 4x100m Medley Relay)\n\nRalf Bissdorf, USA - Boston College (Gold - Women’s Team Foil)\n\n*Hunter Armstrong, who was a part of Cal’s postgraduate training group, was also a member of both of Team USA’s Men’s 4x100-meter relay and 4x100-meter medley relay teams that won the gold medal but is recognized by the NCAA as representing Ohio State where he graduated from and swam for two seasons.\n\n* Ralf Bissdorf, assistant coach for Boston College, served as the head coach of Team USA’s women’s foil team that won the gold medal. However, the International Olympic Committee does not award medals to coaches. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee is proud to recognize the efforts of America’s finest coaches with the Order of Ikkos. The medallion is a symbol of excellence in coaching as represented by athletes’ achievement as an Olympic or Paralympic Medalist.\n\nAbout the ACC\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference, in its 72nd year and 18 members strong, stands as one of the most competitive and revered intercollegiate conferences in the nation. ACC members including Boston College, Cal, Clemson, Duke, Florida State, Georgia Tech, Louisville, Miami, North Carolina, NC State, Notre Dame, Pitt, SMU, Stanford, Syracuse, Virginia, Virginia Tech, and Wake Forest are dedicated to upholding the league's founding values of academic excellence, athletic competition at the highest level, and integrity.
