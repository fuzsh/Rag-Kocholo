        "text": "America's brightest stars are heading to France this summer.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics will see athletes from summer sports convene on the biggest stage.\n\nThe full list of qualified athletes at the 2024 Games is complete, as nearly 600 American competitors have punched their tickets to Paris.\n\nHere are 12 of the top athletes who will be heading to Paris:\n\nSimone Biles, gymnastics\n\nLast time we saw Biles at the Olympics, she was battling the \"twisties.\" Biles overcame the mental block to earn a bronze medal on the balance beam, which gave her seven career Olympic medals in gymnastics. Competing in Paris would be unprecedented, but it's a dream that Biles is pursuing. Biles, who turned 27 in March, won her ninth all-around title at the U.S. Championships in June 2024, dominated at the U.S. trials and will become the oldest U.S. Olympic female gymnast since 1952.\n\nSuni Lee, gymnastics\n\nA breakout star from the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Lee has faced various obstacles since her Olympic debut. She began college at Auburn University just weeks after winning three Olympic medals. Then, a kidney-related condition briefly slowed her down. But Lee is back and ready to chase more medals in Paris. The Minnesota native, who turned 21 in March, is in the midst of her prime athletic years.\n\nKatie Ledecky, swimming\n\nIf it feels like Ledecky has been around for a while, it's because she has. Ledecky burst onto the swimming scene in 2012, when she won her first Olympic gold in the 800-meter freestyle at just 15 years old. In three Olympic runs, Ledecky has seven gold medals and three silver medals. She owns world record times in the 800- and 1500-meter freestyle. At 27 years old, Ledecky still has plenty of time to keep adding to her loaded résumé. She needs one more gold medal to tie the all-time female record, held by American Jenny Thompson.\n\nCaeleb Dressel, swimming\n\nSince Michael Phelps retired, Dressel has stepped up as the face of men's American swimming. He has seven Olympic gold medals, including five from the Tokyo Games. He was perfect in the pool last time around, with gold medals in the 50m freestyle, 100m freestyle, 100m butterfly, 4x100m freestyle and 4x100m medley. The 27-year-old Florida native will be back for more in Paris.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson, track and field\n\nRichardson will make her long-awaited Olympic track and field debut in Paris. She was slated to headline the American field in 2021, but a failed drug test late in the process kept her at home. Now back after winning gold in the 100m at the 2023 world championship and U.S. trials, Richardson is primed for a standout performance this summer.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone, track and field\n\nAfter debuting as a 17-year-old high schooler at the 2016 Olympics, McLaughlin-Levrone won her first medals in Tokyo. She earned two golds — the 400m hurdles and 4x400m relay. The New Jersey native skipped the 2023 world championships due to a knee injury, but will compete in her third Olympics this summer as she turns 25.\n\nNoah Lyles, track and field\n\nLyles made headlines over the winter for his comments about American sports stars claiming to be world champions. But it's an argument he could make because, well, he's literally a world champion. Lyles won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay at the 2023 world championships, making him one of the favorites heading into Paris.\n\nA'ja Wilson, basketball\n\nThere isn't much that Wilson hasn't won in her career. The Las Vegas Aces star is a two-time WNBA champion, two-time WNBA MVP, two-time WNBA Defensive Player of the Year, 2017 NCAA champion and 2020 Olympic gold medalist. At just 27 years old, you can count of Wilson to keep adding to her list of accolades this summer in Paris as part of the women's basketball team.\n\nDiana Taurasi, basketball\n\nFor the sixth time, Taurasi will be on the Team USA Olympic women's basketball team. The 42-year-old star debuted in 2004 while in the midst of her rookie WNBA season. Now, 20 years later, she seeks a sixth straight gold medal. If the Americans win again, Taurasi would be the first player to win six straight golds in basketball. While she might not play a central role on the court, her presence off the court will be invaluable.\n\nLeBron James, basketball\n\nDon't call it a comeback. The NBA's all-time scoring leader will make a return to the Olympics after making his last appearance in 2012. He has two gold medals and a bronze on his résumé, but James and other NBA stars will team up to form a loaded squad in Paris. Even though he's just months away from turning 40, James is the main attraction in what will likely be his final rodeo for Team USA.\n\nJayson Tatum, basketball\n\nWhile James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant lead the older generation of men's basketball stars, Tatum headlines the younger stars. The Boston Celtics forward won his first NBA Finals in June -- and now he's seeking a second Olympic gold. Tatum made his Olympics debut in Tokyo three years ago, playing the sixth man role for the Americans. He scored 15.2 points per game in Japan, second on the team behind Durant.\n\nSara Hughes, beach volleyball"
