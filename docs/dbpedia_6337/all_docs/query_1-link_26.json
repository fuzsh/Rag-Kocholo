        "text": "The weight of the gold medal around her neck ended Gretchen Walsh's wait.\n\nThree years after failing to qualify for the Olympic Games in Tokyo, she finished the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris with a gold medal hanging around her neck, her second of the Games.\n\nThe Nashville native and Harpeth Hall graduate helped the U.S. women's 4x100 medley relay team of herself, Regan Smith, Lilly King and Torri Huske take home gold and set a world record in 3 minutes, 49.63 seconds on Sunday afternoon. Walsh swam the butterfly leg in 55.03 seconds, the fastest split in history, in her sixth and final event.\n\nWalsh's first Olympic experience resulted in four medals — two golds and two silvers — and two world records.\n\n\"This has been such a surreal week,\" Walsh said. \"There's been a lot of highs, a lot of lows, but that was the best way to end it.\"\n\nHer parents, Robert and Glynis Walsh, were there for all of it.\n\n\"Their life flashes in front of you,\" Glynis told The Tennessean after Gretchen broke the 100 fly world record in June. \"I can picture Gretchen being 4 years old with her silly little swimming cap on making all of these funny faces.\"\n\nHere's a list of how Gretchen Walsh fared at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris:\n\nFirst in 4x100 women's medley relay (world record, 3:49.63)\n\nFirst in 4x100 mixed medley relay (world record, 3:37.43)\n\nSecond in 4x100 free relay (U.S. record, 3:30.20)\n\nSecond in 100 butterfly (55.63 seconds)\n\nFourth in 50 free (24.21 seconds)\n\nEighth in 100 free (53.04 seconds)\n\nWhat else did Gretchen Walsh do at Olympic Games in Paris?\n\nShortly after her sister, Alex Walsh, was disqualified after finishing third in the 200 IM, Gretchen teamed with Huske, Ryan Murphy and Nic Fink to set a world record in 3:37.43 in the 4x100 mixed medley relay. Walsh swam the butterfly leg while earning her first gold medal.\n\nSISTER ACT: Alex, Gretchen Walsh went from floating in Nashville pools to Olympic Games Paris 2024\n\nFYI: Gretchen Walsh: Olympics swimming record holder in Paris 2024 with sister Alex what to know\n\nIF YOU BUILD IT: How Polly Linden helped build Harpeth Hall swimmers into Olympic contenders\n\nWalsh teamed with Kate Douglass, Huske and Simone Manuel to take silver in the women's 400-meter freestyle relay, setting a U.S. record time of 3:30.20.\n\nHer second-place finish in the 100-meter butterfly, which she lost by four-hundredths of a second to Huske, came on the heels of two record-setting performances in June. Her time of 55.18 in the event at the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials in Indianapolis set a world record. Walsh broke the Olympic record with a 55.38 during a semifinal in Paris.\n\nEarlier Sunday, she was fourth in the 50 free.\n\n\"When those girls were swimming, they were so dominant that I often would do fun things like break them up . . . divide up the relays equally so they could race each other,\" Harpeth Hall swim coach Polly Linden told The Tennessean in June. \"Otherwise they just blew everybody away.\"\n\nPaul Skrbina is a sports enterprise reporter covering the Predators, Titans, Nashville SC, local colleges and local sports for The Tennessean.
