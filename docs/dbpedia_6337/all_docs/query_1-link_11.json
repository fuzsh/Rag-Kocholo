        "text": "The oldest form of organized sport is track and field athletics, comprised of as many as 25 distinct events. While the sport was established by the late 1800s in many countries, it wasn’t until the Olympic Games were revived in 1896 that interest in athletics spread worldwide. The sport was contested at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens as a men’s only event. Women’s track and field event’s debuted at the 1928 Amsterdam Games.\n\nMen’s track events include the 100-, 200-, 400-, 800-, 1,500-, 5,000-, and 10,000-metre runs; the 3,000-metre steeplechase; the 110- and 400-metre hurdles; and the 400- and 1,500-metre relays. Field events include the high jump, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, shot put, discus throw, hammer throw and javelin throw. The decathlon combines 10 track and field events. The only difference in women’s track and field is a 100-metre hurdles event rather than 110-metres. And women compete in a heptathlon, which includes seven events, rather than 10.\n\nTrack and field champions from the United States include Eddie Tolan, Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis in the 100-metre sprint, Wilma Rudolph in all three sprints and Florence Griffith Joyner in the 100- and 200-metres. Lee Evans and Michael Johnson set world records in the 400-metres. Harrison Dillard, Glenn Davis and Edwin Moses were standout in hurdles, while Al Oerter is legendary in the discus throw and Jesse Owens and Bob Beamon in the long jump event.\n\nPara track and field events have been contested at every Summer Paralympics since the first games in 1960. The United States dominated para track and field events from 1964 to 1996.\n\nCharlie Moore won Olympic gold in the 400-meter hurdles and went on to a career as a businessman, the athletic director at Cornell University and in philanthropy. He passed away on Oct. 8 at age 91.\n\nParalyzed from the waist down after a skiing accident, Chris Waddell went on to compete in seven Paralympic Games, winning 13 medals and becoming the most decorated male monoskier in U.S. history.\n\nAlthough not the prototypical sprinter, Eddie Tolan almost always finished where sprinters wanted to be: first.\n\nBetty Robinson was humble and usually showed her Olympic medals only when asked, but now they will be on display at the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum.\n\nGeorge Poage, the standout runner from Wisconsin won two bronze medals at the St. Louis 1904 Games, becoming the first Black American to win an Olympic medal.\n\nWith a technique he had not used since his youth, James Connolly finished first in the triple jump at Athens 1896.\n\nOnce ostracized for having the courage to stand for his beliefs, half a century later track star John Carlos has embraced his role as a survivor.\n\nRelive Team USA highlights from the London 2012 Olympic Games."
