        "text": "The Olympic Games are in full swing from Paris!\n\nFor a full rundown of all the events each day, we have a full breakdown of everything airing, along with where and how to watch. Every Olympic event will be streaming live on Peacock.\n\nWhen it comes to the medal count, the United States is the favorite to win the most medals. China is unlikely to overtake the U.S. in the overall medal haul, but has a chance to win more gold medals than the Americans.\n\nSo which country is leading in medals as of the sixth day of competition? Here is a look at the Olympic medal count (and keep reading for some Team USA highlights from Day 6).\n\nHere is the full leaderboard, last updated July 28 at 5 p.m.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what events Team USA has won medals in and the athletes involved:\n\nThe last Summer Olympics in which the United States did not top the gold medal table was in 2008 in Beijing. Countries always get a medal bump being the host nation, and France is expected to almost triple the number of gold medals it won in Tokyo.\n\nParis Summer Olympics 2024\n\nTeam USA Highlights: Day 6\n\nTHE GOLDEN GIRL\n\nThe U.S. was the first nation to win five straight women’s all-around Olympic gold medals when Suni Lee prevailed at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nMake it six, as Simone Biles is bringing home another gold.\n\nThe 27-year-old star claimed her sixth career gold medal with a 59.131 overall score in Thursday's women's gymnastics all-around final, just days after winning gold in the team event.\n\nBiles won the event in the 2016 Olympics, making her the third woman to ever win all-around gold twice -- but the first to do it eight years apart. She is the oldest women’s all-around Olympic gold medalist since Maria Gorokhovskaya in 1952 (age 30).\n\nAnd also adding to Team USA's medal was Suni Lee, who finished third. The defending gold medalist in all-around from Tokyo nailed her uneven bars routine, coming just behind Algeria's Kaylia's Nemour with a score of 14.866. Though Lee wobbled on the beam, she recovered and finished cleanly.\n\nDOING NY PROUD\n\nTwo Olympians from the New York City area represented their hometowns proud on Thursday, and will be bringing home gold medals as a result.\n\nIn swimming, Kate Douglass won the women's 200m breaststroke, setting an American record en route to her first-ever gold medal. She now has medals of every color: Douglass was part of the 4x100 freestyle relay for Team USA that finished second earlier in the week, and she also has a bronze from the 200m individual medley from the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe Pelham, New York, native swam for the Chelsea Piers Athletic Club in Stamford, Connecticut, from 2017 to 2019.\n\nLauren Scruggs, from Queens, helped back-to-back gold medal individual champ Lee Kiefer to headline the slate of U.S. women in the foil fencing gold medal match Thursday afternoon. Jacqueline Dubrovich, of New Jersey, and replacement athlete Maia Weintraub, who went to Princeton, joined Kiefer and Scruggs on the piste in Paris.\n\nThe U.S. has been competing in team fencing events since 1904, and it had never won a gold medal — on either the women's side or the men's side.\n\nScruggs, a 21-year-old Harvard student, and the rest of the U.S. women's foil fencers defeated China (45-37) in Thursday's quarterfinal and hammered Canada (45-31) in the semis, setting them up for a gold medal match with Italy, a stacked team with three of the five world's best. Team USA won 45-39.\n\nThe silver win made Scruggs the first Black athlete to medal for the U.S. in an individual women's fencing Olympics event.\n\nScruggs said she wants to inspire young Black fencers and show “that they have a place in the sport.”\n\nLEDECKY STANDS ALONE\n\nWith a silver in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay Thursday night, Katie Ledecky collected the 13th medal of her stellar career to become the most decorated female in swimming history and U.S. Olympics history.\n\nIn her next-to-last event of these games, Ledecky broke the mark she shared with fellow Americans Dara Torres, Natalie Coughlin and Jenny Thompson. The 27-year-old now has eight golds, four silvers and one bronze over four Olympics, with every intention of swimming on to Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nChances are, she'll have this record all to herself by the time she completes the Paris Olympics.\n\nOnly Michael Phelps has more American Olympics medals, with 28 total.\n\nLedecky still has one more race and chance at a medal in Paris, the 800m freestyle medal event on Saturday, Aug. 3.\n\nStephen Wade of the Associated Press contributed to this report."
