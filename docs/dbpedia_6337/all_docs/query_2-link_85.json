St. Louis\n\nAfter holding the first two editions in Europe, the Games headed across the Atlantic to the United States.

London\n\nThrough the first three Olympics, athletes could enter as individuals or members of teams. But from the London Games, all participation was limited to those chosen by each country's National Olympic Committee (NOC).

Pole vaulters Shuhei Nishida and Sueo Oe placed second and third, respectively, but in one of the great stories in Olympic lore, cut their medals in half, soldering together a half-silver, half-bronze medal for each.\n\n1940 : Tokyo Olympics canceled\n\nXII. Tokyo\n\nTokyo was awarded the 12th Olympic Games at the IOC Congress in July 1936.
