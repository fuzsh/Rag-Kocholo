        "text": "Erik Fish took up swimming in the early 1960s and first represented Canada on the international scene at the 1970 Commonwealth Games, where he won a bronze medal in the 100 metre backstroke. He was selected for the nationâ€™s delegation to the 1972 Summer Olympics, where he captured bronze in the 4x100 metre medley relay alongside Bob Kasting, Bill Kennedy, Bill Mahony, and Bruce Robertson. He was also eliminated in the semifinals of the 100 m backstroke. His only other major international tournament was the 1973 Summer Universiade, where he failed to reach the podium, and then retired from active competition shortly thereafter. A graduate of Yale University, where he was a student from 1969 through 1974, he earned a law degree from the University of Toronto in 1978 and is, as of 2013, a partner at Beard Winter LLP in Toronto, Ontario, where he has practiced since 1998."
