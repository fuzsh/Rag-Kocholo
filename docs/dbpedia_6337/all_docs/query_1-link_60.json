        "text": "Highlights - and Lowlights - From a Century\n\nOf Olympic Competition and Commerce\n\n1896 ATHENS\n\nTickets to the Games cost about 16 cents.\n\nThe U.S. team, which had been expecting a two-week training period in Greece, discovers competition begins the day after its arrival. No one, apparently, had considered the differences between the American and Greek calendars.\n\nJames Connolly of the U.S. wins the first medal of the modern Olympic era, in the triple jump.\n\nSilver medals (gold being considered less valuable at the time) and crowns of olive branches are awarded for first place; bronze medals are given to second-place finishers. There are no medals for third place.\n\n1900 PARIS\n\nEvents take place over a two-month period. Track and field competition is held in a park on grass; swimming events are held in the Seine River.\n\nRay Ewry of the U.S. wins three gold medals (the new first-place prize), the first of eight, in the standing high jump, standing long jump and standing triple jump. All three events are discontinued after 1912.\n\nWomen compete for the first time, in golf and tennis.\n\n1904 ST. LOUIS\n\nThe Games are upstaged by the St. Louis World's Fair. Few Europeans attend; athletes from England, France and Sweden stay home.\n\nIn 23 events in track and field, the U.S. takes 22 gold medals, 22 silvers and 20 bronzes.\n\nGeorge Poage of U.S. is the first black athlete to compete in the Games; he wins a bronze medal in the 400-meter hurdles.\n\n1908 LONDON\n\nThe Games last from April to October. For the first time, entries are allowed only by nation -- not by individuals.\n\nAn Italian, Doando Pietri, collapses before he can reach the finish line of the marathon. He is helped across the finish line and declared the winner -- until a protest by the U.S. is upheld. The British press labels the Americans poor sports.\n\n1912 STOCKHOLM\n\nThe first Olympics to build facilities much as we know them today, including a 22,000-seat stadium and a new swimming pool.\n\nBoxing is excluded because the sport is banned in Sweden.\n\nWomen compete for the first time in swimming and diving.\n\nJim Thorpe of the U.S. wins the decathlon and pentathlon, as well as the title of \"greatest athlete in the world\" from King Gustav. The next year, however, he is stripped of his medals when the IOC learns he had received a small sum for playing baseball. Seventy years later, his records are reinstated, and his medals returned to his family.\n\n1920 ANTWERP\n\nThe Games, the first after World War I, are poorly attended. King Albert of Belgium is said to remark: \"All this is quite nice -- but it certainly lacks people.\"\n\nThe Olympic motto -- \"Citius, Altius, Fortius,\" or \"Swifter, Higher, Stronger\" -- is introduced as the Olympic oath, which is recited in all future opening ceremonies.\n\nThe Olympic flag, with five interlaced rings, makes its debut. The rings symbolize the fraternity of nations; the colors -- blue, yellow, black, green and red on a white background -- are found in the flags of the countries participating in the Games.\n\nPaavo Nurmi of Finland, famed for running with a stopwatch in hand, makes his Olympic debut, winning three gold medals -- the first of his nine golds and 12 medals overall -- in the 100,000-meter run, the cross-country run and the team cross-country run. The cross-country events are later discontinued.\n\n1924 PARIS\n\nThe International Olympic Committee, solidifying its position as the final authority of the Games, prohibits host countries from adding events at will.\n\nScotland's Eric Liddell and England's Harold Abrahams, later of \"Chariots of Fire\" fame, win the 400-meter run and 100-meter dash, respectively. Liddell withdraws from the 100 meters because the race is scheduled for a Sunday, as portrayed in the film; but his decision was made months before the Games -- not at the last minute, as the film suggests.\n\nJohnny Weismuller wins the first of five gold medals in two Olympics. He will go on to play Tarzan in Hollywood.\n\n1928 AMSTERDAM\n\nFor the first time, a flame is lighted in the main stadium and burns throughout the Games.\n\nWomen, for the first time, are allowed to compete in track and field events.\n\n1932 LOS ANGELES\n\nThe victory platform is introduced; athletes now mount a trilevel stand to receive their medals, followed by the raising of their national flags and playing of the winner's national anthem.\n\nThe first Olympic Village is built for athletes -- but only for men. Women stay at the Chapman Park Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard.\n\nMildred \"Babe\" Didrikson of the U.S. dominates the women's events, winning --and setting world records in -- the 80-meter hurdles and javelin, and taking a silver in the high jump.\n\nThe Games make a profit -- $213,877.19 -- which is donated to the city and county.\n\n1936 BERLIN\n\nHitler doesn't come to power until after the Games are awarded to Germany, but he embraces the Olympics as a means of promoting Nazism. Calls in the U.S. and Europe for a boycott of the games are rejected.\n\nThe tradition is begun of lighting the Olympic flame in Greece and carrying it, by means of a torch, to the host city.\n\nThe first games to be televised. This was done on an experimental basis, in and around Berlin only, with a total of 138 viewing hours and 162,000 viewers. Three cameras were used -- but only one could be used live, and only if the sun was bright enough.\n\nJesse Owens is the star of the Games, winning four gold medals: in the 100- and 200-meter dashes, long jump and 4x100-meter relay.\n\n1948 LONDON\n\nGermany and Japan are banned from the Games, the first after World War II.\n\nAge makes little difference: Twelve years after her first Olympic appearance, Holland's Francina Blankers-Koen, a 30-year-old mother of two, wins four gold medals, in the 100- and 200-meter dashes, the 80-meter hurdles and the 4x100-meter relay. Meanwhile, 17-year-old Bob Mathias of the U.S. wins the decathlon. When asked how he plans to celebrate, Mathias answers: \"I'll start shaving, I guess.\"\n\nAlice Coachman of the U.S. wins the high jump, the first black woman to earn a gold medal.\n\n1952 HELSINKI\n\nThe Soviet Union joins the Games for the first time. A separate Olympic Village , with special security measures, I built for the Soviet-bloc athletes.\n\nEmil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia wins three gold medals, in the 5000-and 10,000-meter runs and the marathon; his wife, Dana, wins the gold medal in the javelin.\n\n1956 MELBOURNE\n\nThe Summer Games, held for the first time in the Southern Hemisphere, take place form Nov. 22 to Dec. 8.\n\nThe Suez crisis and the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary prompt several countries to boycott the Games. The semifinal water-polo match between Hungary and the Soviet Union turns into a bloody affair, with the Russians eventually forfeiting after falling behind 4-0.\n\nIn the closing ceremonies, the athletes, for the first time, enter the stadium together, rather than as members of national teams.\n\n1960 ROME\n\nMedals for the first time are awarded with a ribbon or chain.\n\nIn track and field, Olympic records are set in every men's event except the 5,000-meter run, 20 kilometer walk, 110-meter hurdles and javelin.\n\nWilma Rudolph of the U.S. wins three gold medals: in the 100- and 200-meter dashes and 4x100-meter relay.\n\nCassius Clay, who later changes his name to Muhammed Ali, wins a gold medal as a light heavyweight.\n\n1964 TOKYO\n\nThe first games to be held in Asia. Organizers receive 3.5 million requests for the 60,000 seats available for the opening ceremonies.\n\nThe results of events, for the first time, are officially determined by electric time-keeping and photo-finish equipment.\n\nBilly Mills of the U.S., a virtual unknown in track and field, wins the 10,000-meter run, in what is widely regarded as the greatest upset in Olympic history.\n\nJoe Frazier, future heavyweight champion, and Bob Hayes, future Dallas Cowboy, win gold medals in boxing and track and field, respectively.\n\n1968 MEXICO CITY\n\nFemale athletes, for the first time, are required to take sex tests to ensure that they are, in fact, females.\n\nBob Beamon, in his first attempt in the long jump, wins the gold medal with a leap of 29 feet 2.5 inches, breaking the world record by almost two feet. His mark stands for 23 years.\n\nHigh jumping is never the same: Dick Fosbury of the U.S. wins the gold medal with his unorthodox technique of turning his back to the bar, the so-called Fosbury Flop.\n\nThe first live telecast -- in color -- of the Games.\n\nTommie Smith and John Carlos of the U.S. -- gold and bronze medalists, respectively, in the 200-meter dash -- are suspended by the U.S. Olympic Committee and expelled from the Olympic Village after raising their hands on the victory stand in a Black Power salute.\n\nMexico City's altitude, 7,573 feet above sea level, proves a blessing to distance runners from East Africa and a curse to much of the rest of the field.\n\n1972 MUNICH\n\nTerrorists kill 11 Israeli athletes, prompting calls to halt the competition. But Avery Brundage of the U.S., President of the International Olympic Committee, declares: \"The Games must go on.\"\n\nMark Spitz of the U.S. wins seven gold medals in swimming, the most gold medals won at a single Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. suffers its first basketball loss in Olympic history -- to the Soviet Union -- after 62 consecutive victories, dating back to 1936. The team refuses to accept its silver medal, however, because of a dispute over timekeeping at the game's end.\n\n1976 MONTREAL\n\nThe city initially estimates the Games will cost about $300 million. But labor disputes and soaring construction costs leave Montreal $1 billion in debt.\n\nTwenty-eight African nations boycott the Games, the first in a series of major boycotts of the Olympics.\n\nNadia Comaneci of Romania scores the first perfect \"10\" in gymnastics in Olympic competition. She goes on to score seven \"10s\" and win three gold medals.\n\n1980 MOSCOW\n\nThe U.S. and 62 other nations boycott the Games to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.\n\nSebastian Coe and Steve Ovett of Britain are heavily favored to win gold medals in the 800- and 1,500-meter runs, respectively. They do win gold -- but in each other's event.\n\n1988 SEOUL\n\nNorth Korea boycotts the Games after insisting that it has the right to host half of the competition.\n\nBen Johnson of Canada wins the 100-meter dash -- but is disqualified after testing positive for steroids. The gold medal goes to Carl Lewis of the U.S.\n\nGreg Louganis wins two gold medals, in springboard and platform diving, becoming the first man to successfully defend both titles.\n\nTennis, after 64 years, returns to the Games.\n\n1992 BARCELONA\n\nSouth Africa returns to the Games in the wake of apartheid's fall.\n\nThe crumbling Soviet Union competes as the Unified Team, a collection of republics. Germany, meanwhile, competes as a single team.\n\nThe first Summer Games to avoid a boycott since 1972.\n\nProfessional basketball players compete for the first time, including America's Dream Team.\n\nGail Devers of the U.S. wins the 100-meter dash by one one-hundredth of a second, the closest finish in the history of the modern Games.\n\n1996 ATLANTA\n\nThe centennial Games of the modern Olympic era.\n\nA record 197 countries -- including a record number of women athletes, about 3,800 -- are scheduled to participate.\n\nThe average high temperature in Atlanta in late July: 88 degrees."
