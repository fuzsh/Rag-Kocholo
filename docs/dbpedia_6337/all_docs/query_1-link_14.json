        "text": "01 ! 02 ! 03 !\n\nAlain Bernard is a swimmer who has competed for France. He competed at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympic Games. He won a total of four medals throughout his Olympic career, including an individual gold in the men's 100 metres freestyle at Beijing 2008. He also attained the world record after winning the 2008 European Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands with a time of 47.50.\n\nBeijing 2008[]\n\nAt the French Championships, Bernard qualified for the Olympic Games in Beijing in the 50 m freestyle (with a time of 21.69) and 100 m freestyle (47.82).\n\nBefore the relay, Bernard taunted the American swimming squad. He and the rest of his French team ended up in second place behind the American team by 0.08 of a second. Coming through the anchor leg with a commanding lead slightly less than a bodylength, Bernard was caught in the final strokes by Jason Lezak, whose anchor leg of 46.06 seconds was the fastest relay time in the event's history.\n\nThe close defeat left Bernard \"wounded,\" according to his coach[1]; however, he rebounded to claim the Olympic title in the men's 100 metre freestyle final, with Lezak tying his position with Brazil's César Cielo Filho for the bronze. Bernard became only the second Frenchman to win the gold medal in swimming, after Jean Boiteux dominated the 400 metres freestyle at Helsinki 1952. He also finished third in the 50 m freestyle final behind Cielo and his compatriot Amaury Leveaux, producing two medalists for the French swimmers in the final for the first time in history.\n\nHe has a shark tattoo on his right hip.\n\nLondon 2012[]\n\nBernard failed to qualify for the 50 and 100 metres freestyle at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, finishing only fifth in both events during the French Championships four months earlier. He competed at his second Games as a member of the men's 4x100 metres freestyle relay team for France, swimming only during the heats. With the Frenchmen beating the Americans for their first-place triumph, Bernard became the first Frenchman to have received two gold medals in swimming.[2][3]\n\nOlympic Results[]\n\nYear Event Rank 2008 Men's 50m freestyle Men's 100m freestyle Men's 4x100m freestyle relay 2012 Men's 4x100m freestyle relay\n\n2008[]\n\nDiscipline Round Time 50 metres freestyle Heats 21.78 Semifinal 21.54 Final 21.49 100 metres freestyle Heats 47.85 Semifinal 47.20 WR Final 47.21 4x100 metres freestyle relay Heats 3:12.36\n\n(Reserve) AR Final 3:08.32\n\n(46.73 split) AR\n\n2012[]\n\nDiscipline Round Time 4x100 metres freestyle relay Heats 3:13.38\n\n(48.31 split) Final 3:09.93\n\n(Reserve)\n\nService in the French Gendarmerie[]\n\nBernard has been a volunteer in the Gendarmerie since 2008 and was until recently attached to the Groupement blindé de gendarmerie mobile based in Versailles-Satory in the Yvelines department."
