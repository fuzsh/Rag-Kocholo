        "text": "Zach BacharContributor I\n\nMedal Count 2024 Olympics: Updated Standings, Highlights After Day 6\n\n0 of 4\n\nBleacher Report\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics continued on Thursday as the sixth day of action wrapped up.\n\nMedals were handed out in events such as shooting, swimming, kayaking, and gymnastics. Other events included basketball, table tennis, water polo, beach volleyball, surfing, handball, badminton, and more.\n\nSimone Biles continued her dominance by winning gold in the all-around final, although she wasn't the only member of the United States to secure a medal. At 27 years old, she became the oldest all-around Olympic champion since 1952.\n\nHere's an updated look at the medal standings as well a few highlights from Biles and the rest of Thursday's competition.\n\nUpdated Medal Standings\n\n1 of 4\n\nJamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nThursday's Updated Overall Medal Standings\n\n1. United States - 37 Total (9 Gold, 15 Silver, 13 Bronze)\n\n2. France - 27 Total (8 Gold, 11 Silver, 8 Bronze)\n\n3. China - 24 Total (11 Gold, 7 Silver, 6 Bronze)\n\n4. Great Britain - 20 Total (6 Gold, 7 Silver, 7 Bronze)\n\n5. Australia - 18 Total (8 Gold, 6 Silver, 4 Bronze)\n\n6. Japan - 16 Total (8 Gold, 3 Silver, 5 Bronze)\n\n7. Italy - 16 Total (5 Gold, 7 Silver, 4 Bronze)\n\n8. South Korea - 12 Total (6 Gold, 3 Silver, 3 Bronze)\n\nFull medal standings via Olympics.com.\n\nRemaining Thursday Schedule\n\n4 p.m. ET\n\n3x3 Basketball Women's Pool Play: Canada vs. France\n\n4 p.m. ET\n\nBeach Volleyball Women's Pool Play: United States vs. China (NBC)\n\n4:05 p.m. ET\n\nMen's Cycling BMX Racing\n\n4:15 p.m. ET\n\nWomen's Cycling BMX Racing\n\n4:35 p.m. ET\n\n3x3 Basketball Men's Pool Play: Serbia vs. France\n\n5:05 p.m. ET\n\n3x3 Basketball Men's Pool Play: United States vs. Latvia (NBC)\n\nSimone Biles Wins Another Gold\n\n2 of 4\n\nJamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nBiles became the first American athlete to win the all-around gold medal at the Summer Olympics more than once and is also the first woman to win two titles in the individual all-around since Věra Čáslavská in 1968.\n\nHer day started strong with an impressive vault score of 15.766 thanks to her Yurchenko double pike.\n\nHowever, she struggled on the uneven bars and recorded a score of 13.733. She bounced back on the balance beam before securing her spot on top of the podium with an incredible floor routine.\n\nU.S. teammate Suni Lee was also able to earn a bronze medal, as she shined on the uneven bars with a 14.866 score.\n\nLee and Biles previously earned a gold medal during the team final on Tuesday, and they were both able to make it to the podium once again.\n\nU.S. Advances to Round of 16 in Beach Volleyball\n\n3 of 4\n\nTHOMAS SAMSON/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe United States men's beach volleyball pairing of Andy Benesh and Miles Partain secured a victory over Brazil in three sets on Thursday, finishing with a record of 2-1 in pool play and earning a spot in the playoffs.\n\nPartain and Benesh, at 22 and 29 years old respectively, represent the youngest U.S. Olympic beach volleyball team in history. They'll be attempting to end a medal drought for the United States, as the country hasn't recorded a men's beach volleyball medal since 2008.\n\nAfter losing their opening match against Cuba, the pair won two consecutive contests to advance.\n\n\"We found our mojo again,\" Benesh said, via USA Today's Mark Gianotto. \"It'll be back for eternity. We're super happy with the style we played with today and we're going to continue that.\"\n\nKate Douglass Wins First Gold Medal\n\n4 of 4\n\nX"
