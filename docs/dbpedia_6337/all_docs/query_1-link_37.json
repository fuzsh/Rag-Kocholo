        "text": "Spectators at the Defense Arena, the Parisian venue for swimming competitions that ended on Sunday, are getting used to seeing records broken. Three world records were broken by the USA and China in the 1,500 freestyle and the men's and women's 4x100 relays.\n\n1.500m freestyle\n\nIn the 1,500m freestyle, Bobby Finke, winner of this event at Tokyo-2020, set a world record, breaking the 14.30 barrier, with 14.30.67, breaking the previous best of 14:31.02 set by China's Sun Yang in London in 2012.\n\nThis world record is the second in these games, after China's Zhanle Pan in the 100m freestyle (in doubt for australian swim coach).\n\nThe contest was between the United States and Italy, who were neck and neck with Bobby Finke holding a slight lead. At 3.88 seconds, silver went to Italy's Gregorio Paltrineri and at 8.96, bronze to Ireland's Daniel Wiffen.\n\n4 x100 Relay men\n\nChina wins gold in the men's 4x100 relay and achieves another world record with Zhanle Pan, who has already achieved another world record in these same games and who was the last relay and the fastest of the team formed by Jiajun Sun, Haiyang Qin and Jiayu Xu. The total time was 3.31.58.\n\nXu, the 100m backstroke silver medallist, gave China the lead after the opening leg, with Qin ensuring they also turned first after the breaststroke. But France came surging back, thanks to a sizzling butterfly leg from Maxime Grousset.\n\nSilver went to the United States, with a time of 3.31.62, in a team of Ryan Murphy, Nic Fink, Caeleb Dressel and Hunter Amstrong; and bronze to France, with 3.31.62, in a team that included French idol and Defense Arena king Leon Marchand, adding a bronze medal to his four golds in Paris, along with Yohan Ndoye-Brouard, Maximme Grousset and Florent Manaudou.\n\n4x100 Relay Women\n\nAnd in the women's 4x100 relay final there was a new world record, for the United States, with a time of 3:56.40 that gave gold to the team made up of names that have featured heavily in these games such as Regan Smith, Lily King, Gretchen Wals and Torri Huske.\n\nSilver went to Australia, with 3:54.81, in a team of Kaylee McKeown, Jenna Strauch, Emma McKeon and the world record Mollie O'Callaghan, while bronze, with 3:56.34, went to China, with Letian Wan, Qianting Tang, Yufei Zhang and Junxuan Chang.\n\nKing extended the USA's lead over the Canadians with the highly fancied Australian team in third. Walsh, silver medallist in the 100m butterfly, opened up an unsurmountable lead before Huske, who won gold in the 100m fly and silver in the 100m freestyle, made sure of the world record and the gold with a strong anchor leg.\n\nThe US leads the medal table in this event with 11 golds and it has won a medal at every Olympic Games, with the exception of Moscow 1980, which they boycotted.\n\n100 m freestyle women\n\nIn the women's 50m freestyle, the gold went to Sweden's Sarah Sjoestroem, who added that gold to the one she won in the 100m and who yesterday broke an Olympic record.\n\nBehind the Swede, in what is her fifth Olympic Games, was Australia's Meg Harris, 26 seconds behind for silver, and China's Yufei Zhang, 49 seconds behind for bronze."
