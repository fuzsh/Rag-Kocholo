The team rallied from a 27-point deficit headed into the final day of the three-day meet.\n\nBattle flexed his strength over the weekend by medaling in all three throwing events he competed in behind two golds and one silver. He began the weekend on Friday by setting a Centennial Conference Outdoor Championship record throw of 54.84 meters in the hammer for his first career gold in the event. He then earned his second his second gold medal of the weekend after winning a competitive discus event with a throw of 43.66 meters. Battle finished off his weekend with a by earning silver in the shot put with his personal best throw of 15.85 meters. He was named the Most Outstanding Field Performer of the Meet and swept the Men's T&F Field Athlete of the Year Awards dating back from the indoor season. Battle was the third-straight Bear to be named the most outstanding field performer at Outdoor Championships as he followed in the footsteps of Griffin McMann and Nick Galbraith.\n\nTobin gave the Bears a glimpse into the future with a dynamic showing over the weekend to cap a sensational collegiate debut season. He won the gold medal in the 200 meters in school record-setting fashion on his time of 21.65 that topped the previous 21.81 mark by Brandon Evans in 2006. Tobin added a gold in the 4x400 while garnering bronze medals in the 100 meters plus 4x100 relay. He was the second-straight Bear to be named outdoor track & field rookie of the year after former Ursinus student-athlete Brody Myers earned it in 2022.\n\nMaloney finished his Ursinus career in style by winning his first gold medal in the 110-meter hurdles after taking down both the Ursinus and Centennial Conference Championship Meet record on his time of 14.61. He edged the previous mark for the meet by .4 that was set in 2011 and school record that was set in 2010. Maloney swept the hurdle races for the Centennial Championship season following a photo-finish win for the 60-meter indoor hurdles and has medaled in every 110-meter hurdle race at the Centennial Championships during his career.\n\nTabor helped power the Bears on the track by winning his first collegiate individual gold medal for the outdoor championships during the 400 meters with his personal best time of 48.37. He also earned bronze in the 200 meters with a personal best time of 21.90.\n\nThe 4x400 team that consisted of Tobin, junior Collin Ney, senior Payton Stanziani, and junior Devon Greaves locked up the Bears Centennial title in style by taking down the 21-year old Centennial Conference Meet Record for the event on their time of 3:18.69. The four currently hold the fourth-fastest time for the relay in the metro region and will look to become the second-straight Bears 4x400 squad to compete in the NCAA Championship Meet.\n\nGreaves earned second team honors behind his silver medal in the 400-meter hurdles with a personal best time of 55.61. Sophomore Ken Komatsu added his first All-Centennial honor in his first season with Ursinus for the pole vault after clearing the bar at 4.10 meters.

He bested the previous mark of 5,223 set by Jon Dickson back in 2008.\n\nIn addition to his heroics in the 4x400 relay, Stanziani won the bronze medal in the 400 meters to earn honorable mention status on his time of 49.14. Sophomore Mason Jolivette earned his first individual medal in the 400 meter hurdles with his time of 55.66 while freshman James Sims III had a great showing in the high jump behind his mark of 1.85 meters to earn the bronze medal.\n\nA trio of throwers earned honorable mention status as well after all winning bronze medals. Sophomore Tom Wood earned his first outdoor medal with a bronze for the shot put on his personal best mark of 14.67 meters while classmate Chase Shaneman did the same in the javelin with his throw of 50.06 meters. Senior Tim Holzapfel garnered his first career medal in the event after recording a career best throw of 53.13 in the hammer. Holzapfel also topped the original Centennial Conference championship meet record.\n\nHolzapfel was also the Ursinus representative on the All-Centennial Sportsmanship team.\n\nUrsinus returns to action on Monday, May 15th as they will begin their final push for more NCAA Qualifiers at the Widener Last Chance Meet.\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
