In the five games, he totaled 26 points, 11 rebounds and six assists while shooting 55 percent (11-of-20) from the floor. His best came came in Great Britain's lone victory, a 90-58 win over China in the last of five games.

He also had eight points on 4-of-7 shooting, two rebounds and two assists in 25 minutes against Australia. In addition to the win against China and a loss to Australia, Great Britain lost games to Russia, Brazil and Spain at the Olympics.\n\nAfter playing his college basketball at Villanova from 1999-03, Sullivan has gone on to a successful professional and international career back in Europe.

She was chosen under her country's \"Rising Star\" program to be its representative in the 5000 meters in London, and Reid tallied a time of 15:27.41 to finish 15th in her preliminary heat of the event. This year, Reid had the fastest Olympic qualifying time in the 1500 meters - 4:03.96 - of any Canadian athlete but was forced to withdraw from the country's Olympic trials due to an injury.\n\nSince making her Olympics debut in 2012, Reid has continued to have success on an international stage. She competed at the IAAF World Championships in Moscow in 2013 and posted a time of 4:10.90 in her heat of the 1500 meters. Reid also placed 12th in the 3000 meters with a time of 9:19.67 at the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Portland, Ore. earlier this year.

It started with her winning her first national title in cross country and leading Villanova to its second consecutive national championship. During the indoor season, Reid anchored the Wildcats to an NCAA title in the distance medley relay and finished second individually in the 3000 meters. Her best was still to come, as she became the first woman in history to win both the 1500 meters and the 5000 meters in the same year at the outdoor NCAA Championships. Reid also doubled up in winning both events at the BIG EAST Championships that year. She swept the Mid-Atlantic Region Athlete of the Year awards in cross country, indoors and outdoors in 2010-11, and was also named the winner of the prestigious Honda Sports Award for both cross country and track & field.

Reid owns the fastest time in school history on a 6000 meter cross country course as well, with a mark of 19:34 which was recorded at the NCAA Mid-Atlantic Regional her junior year.\n\nThere was another list of accomplishments for Reid during her time at Villanova which was equally impressive to her efforts in competition: her academic achievements. Reid was a first team Academic All-American for both the 2010-11 and 2011-12 school years. She was also named the USTFCCCA National Scholar-Athlete of the Year in both cross country (2010, 2011) and track & field (2011).
