        "text": "Deb Kiner | dkiner@pennlive.com\n\nSummer Olympics memorable moments\n\nAssociated Press\n\n1912 Jim Thorpe\n\nIn Stockholm, Jim Thorpe won gold medals in the pentathlon and decathlon. He also played football and professional baseball and basketball. He lost his Olympic medals because he was paid to play two seasons of semi-professional baseball before the Olympics, violating the amateurism rules. The International Olympic Committee restored his medals in 1983, 30 years after he died. As a teenager he attended Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle.\n\nAssociated Press\n\n1936 Jesse Owens\n\nThis Aug. 11, 1936, file photo shows America's Jesse Owens, center, salutes during the presentation of his gold medal for the long jump, after defeating Nazi Germany's Lutz Long, right, during the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Naoto Tajima of Japan, left, placed third. Owens won four gold medals at the Olympics in Berlin in the 100 meter, 200 meter, 4x100 meter relay and long jump.\n\nAssociated Press\n\n1948 Alice Coachman\n\nAlice Coachman, (center), of Albany, Ga., stands on the winner's section of the Olympic podium at Wembley Stadium, Wembley, England, Aug. 7, 1948, to receive the gold medal for winning the women's high jump. At left is D.J. Tyler of Great Britain, who placed second, and at right is M.O.M. Ostermeyer of France who placed third. Coachman was the first African-American woman to win an Olympic gold medal.\n\nAssociated Press\n\n1952 Emil Zatopek\n\nBritish athlete Christopher Chataway falls near the end of the men's final 5000 meters event at the Summer Olympic Games on July 24, 1952, in Helsinki, Finland. Going on to win in Olympic record time is Emil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia, followed by Alain Mimoun of France and German bronze medal winner Herbert Schade. Zatopek is the only person to win those three distance races in the same Olympics.\n\nAssociated Press\n\n1960 Wilma Rudolph\n\nWilma Rudolph setting an Olympic record during the 1960 Olympics in Rome. She was called 'the fastest woman in the world.' She won three gold medals in the 100 meter, 200 meter and 4x100 meter relay.\n\nAssociated Press\n\n1960 Adebe Bikila\n\nEthiopia's Bikila Abebe, center, leads in the final stages of the Olympic Marathon, in Rome, Italy, Sept. 10, 1960. He is closely followed by Morocco's Abdesian Rhadi, right. Adebe ran barefooted and was the first black African Olympic champion.\n\nAssociated Press\n\n1960 Knud Enemark Jensen\n\nDenmark's Knud Enemark Jensen, 23, is shown on the starting line as the 100-kilometer (62-mile) Olympic trials get underway in Rome, Aug. 26, 1960. Jensen collapsed and died during that team time trial road race. It may have been the first Olympic doping case. The team trainer said he had given Jensen Roniacol (nicotinyl alcohol).
