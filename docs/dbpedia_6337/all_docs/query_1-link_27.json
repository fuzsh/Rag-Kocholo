        "text": "Collection Story\n\nGoing for Gold\n\nBlack Women and Olympic Gender Parity\n\nThe modern Olympic Games debuted in 1896 in Athens, Greece—without women athletes. The Games’ founder, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, believed including women’s sports would be “impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic, and improper.\"\n\nMisconceptions about women’s physical capabilities and an emphasis on their roles as wives and mothers severely limited athletic opportunities for women in the nineteenth and into the twentieth century. The first white American women athletes competed at the Paris Olympics in 1900, and the first African American women—Tidye Pickett and Louise Stokes—competed in track and field at the 1936 Games in Hitler’s Germany (Pickett and Stokes made the 1932 Olympic team but were kept from competition). When American society has been reluctant to encourage women’s athletics, African American women have been at the vanguard of sporting opportunities for all.\n\nSummer 2024 marks 100 years since the 1924 Games in Paris where women were only 3% of participants. Paris 2024 will be the first Olympic Games where one in every two athletes is a woman. And quite contrary to de Coubertin’s opinion, everyone watches women’s sports. In honor of this historic moment of gender parity, it is fitting to highlight some of the game-changing women Olympians featured in the National Museum of African American History and Culture’s collection.\n\nTRACK AND FIELD\n\nWomen first began competing in Olympic track and field at the 1928 Games in Amsterdam. But when athletes dropped to the track exhausted—as athletes often do—after finishing the 800-meters final at world record pace, onlookers were scandalized. The International Olympic Committee concluded that 800 meters was far too strenuous for women—physically and mentally—and the distance was removed from the women’s Olympic program for the next 32 years. The 1960 Rome Olympics were the first Games in which women were once again permitted to race more than 200 meters.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1984, the Tennessee State University Tigerbelles—under famed track and field coach Ed Temple—produced 40 Black female Olympians and won 23 Olympic medals, including 13 gold. The Tigerbelles’ dominance is even more impressive in that it took place before the passage of the Title IX legislation that secured equal opportunities in education for women and men. While not intended to primarily address sports, Title IX is now widely interpreted as providing equity in athletic opportunities.\n\nOpportunities for women athletes to compete in sports were few in the early twentieth century, but historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) often provided such outlets. Since track and field was socially associated with “manliness,” Black women athletes were encouraged to lean into their femininity to refute criticisms that were often steeped in misogyny, racism, and/or homophobia. Coach Temple required his athletes to style their hair and makeup before media appearances and maintain an attractive bodyweight; the TSU Tigerbelles were to be “foxes, not oxes.” The Tigerbelles’ willingness to do so—combined with their undeniable success on the track and pressure to prevail in medal counts during the Cold War—made them media darlings, and preserved women’s track and field for future generations. The Tigerbelles helped secure African American women’s place in track and field when the nation was, at best, uninterested in women’s sports.\n\nAt times, African Americans’ athletic success has brought them significant social influence. In 1956, Wilma Rudolph and fellow Tigerbelles Mae Faggs, Isabelle Daniels, and Margaret Matthews were the first all-African American women’s team to win an Olympic track and field relay medal. Like thousands of Americans in the twentieth century, as an infant, Rudolph was paralyzed by polio. Rudolph wrote in her self-titled autobiography, “my doctor told me I would never walk again. My mother told me I would. I believed my mother.”\n\nIn 1960, Rudolph became the first American woman to take three track golds at a single Games. A homecoming parade in Clarksville, Tennessee was scheduled in her honor following the 1960 Olympics, with the expectation that it would be segregated. Rudolph refused to attend. When the city relented, Wilma Rudolph Day was the first integrated public event in Clarksville. Rudolph’s success on the track enabled her to push for integration in Clarksville, and win!\n\nSummer 1968 was a breakout Olympics for another member of the Tigerbelles, Wyomia Tyus. Tyus took the 100-meter gold, setting a world record of 11.08 seconds, becoming the first sprinter—woman or man—to win back-to-back golds in the 100-meter (she won gold during the previous Olympics in Tokyo in 1964).\n\nWhile Tommie Smith and John Carlos’ raised-fist protest atop the podium after medaling in the 200-meter has become synonymous with the 1968 Olympics, Tyus staged her own protest a day before. Instead of her Team USA white track shorts, Tyus wore dark shorts, intentionally breaking uniform protocol as an act of protest. However, since media outlets in the mid-twentieth century often neglected to cover African American women’s sports, no one seemed to notice. Tyus’ accomplishments on the track and her solidarity with the Olympic Project for Human Rights (OPHR) went largely unacknowledged.\n\nOn October 20, the all-African American women’s 4x100 relay team—Wyomia Tyus, Margaret Bailes, Barbara Ferrell, and Mildrette Netter—won gold, setting a world record of 42.88 seconds. In an interview following their dominant performance, Tyus spoke for the relay team, dedicating their victory to Smith and Carlos who had been suspended from Team USA and expelled from the Olympic Village. African American women athletes were present and engaged in the Mexico City Games, but their political statements in support of the OPHR were largely overlooked. When asked if she believed Smith and Carlos’ protest obscured her performances and politics, Tyus remarked, “It’s either that or the fact that I’m a Black woman.” Now, more than a half century later, Wyomia Tyus is gaining more recognition for her activism as well as her athleticism.\n\nBASKETBALL\n\nThe popularity of women’s basketball has reached an all-time high in the United States this year with the electrifying success of players like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, 2020 gold medalist A’ja Wilson, and four-time gold medalist coach Dawn Staley. This new attention has been a long time coming! Women’s basketball debuted at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal—40 years after the men began playing at the 1936 Berlin Games.\n\nMany hoops fans may not remember Lusia “Lucy” Harris-Stewart, but she was arguably one of the best women’s basketball players in American history. A three-time All-American and three-time Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) national champion at Delta State University, she averaged a whopping 25.9 points and 14.4 rebounds per game. In 1976, the 6’3” center averaged 31.2 points and 15.1 rebounds per game. She scored the first points in women’s Olympic basketball history and led Team USA basketball to its first silver medal as the team’s leading scorer and rebounder. In 1976 she was one of four Black athletes on the team’s twelve-person roster.\n\nDuring the 1977 National Basketball Association (NBA) draft, Harris-Stewart was selected as the 137th overall pick in the 7th round by the NBA’s New Orleans Jazz. Harris-Stewart, however, made the personal choice to start a family rather than play in the men’s league. About her decision, Harris-Stewart said, “I don’t regret not going, not even a little bit.” She remains the only woman ever to be officially drafted by the NBA. In 1992, Harris-Stewart was the first Black woman and first women’s collegiate player inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2024, Team USA women’s basketball team looks to win a record eighth consecutive gold medal in Paris with a 12-person roster that is nearly 67% Black.\n\nSOCCER\n\nBriana Scurry is the only African American woman goalkeeper in Team USA women’s soccer history. In 1996—the first year women’s soccer became an Olympic sport—Scurry and eight other players went on strike to secure pay equity; while the men’s soccer team would receive monetary bonuses for any medal, the women’s team would only receive a bonus for gold. After reaching a settlement, with a bonus for any women’s medal, the players ended the strike and the U.S. Women’s National Team (USWNT) won gold.\n\nBriana Scurry was a goalkeeper for the women’s national team for most of the time between 1994 and 2008. Scurry made a crucial save during penalty kicks in the iconic 1999 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Women’s World Cup final that secured the gold medal and helped popularize soccer in American culture. Scurry was also on the silver-medal team during the 2000 Olympics and won her second gold medal at the 2004 Olympics in Athens.\n\nAccustomed to being the first and only African American on soccer teams throughout her life, the two-time Olympic gold medalist was also one of the first out LGBTQ+ persons in women’s professional soccer. She had a stellar career with the USWNT before a traumatic brain injury abruptly sidelined her in 2010. When debilitating headaches placed her on disability, Scurry, devastated, sold her gold medals to help make ends meet. Eventually, she recovered her medals and obtained insurance coverage for surgery to treat her headaches. In 2018, Scurry was the first Black woman and the first female goalkeeper inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame. She has remained involved in sports as a motivational speaker and an advocate for Traumatic Brain Injury and mental health support, equal pay, and queer pride.\n\nSWIMMING\n\nAt the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Simone “Swimone” Manuel became the first African American woman to win an individual swimming medal, taking gold in the 100-meter free. Her victory, in addition to ranking her as the best in the world, caused many African Americans to swell with pride.\n\nIn the United States, segregation and redlining have historically cut off access to neighborhood pools making it difficult for African Americans to learn to swim in a controlled environment. This is ironic given the close relationship Black communities have with aquatics across the African Diaspora. In Manuel’s first professional brand partnership with the competitive swimwear company TYR Sport in 2018, she made history as the first athlete to have an inclusion rider in their contract. The rider ensures that TYR will “extend meaningful opportunities to traditionally underrepresented groups and that diversity be reflected in the creative efforts she pursues with the brand.” Examples include TYR providing Black hair and makeup artists for its product photo shoots. Manuel has also partnered with various institutions to provide water safety and swim lessons regardless of one’s ability to pay. Manuel’s skill in the pool and justice work at large will ensure that in the future of competitive and recreational swimming, African Americans will not be an anomaly.\n\nWhile training for the Tokyo Olympics, despite not initially being believed by her coach and others, Manuel dealt with extreme fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. The unique pressures of being a prominent, singular African American woman professional swimmer during the nation’s racial reckoning took their toll. Black women have not always been believed when expressing concerns about their health. But in 2021, Manuel was medically diagnosed with overtraining syndrome and took time away from the sport to heal.\n\nSwimone looks to make another big splash this summer in Paris, competing in the 50-meter free and on the women’s 4x100 meter freestyle relay team.\n\nAfrican American women athletes have often succeeded as the first and the only in their sports while battling racism, gender discrimination, and other social inequalities. Successes in their respective arenas have transcended sport, leading to victories in the broader society—like Olympic gender parity—while highlighting injustices that persist. These are just a few examples of the game-changing African American women represented in the NMAAHC’s collection who have overcome immense obstacles in their personal lives and athletic careers in pursuit of Olympic triumph. The nation is better for their records of Olympic dominance as well as their contributions to social justice.\n\nWhere, historically, compounding discrimination has restricted their opportunities to compete on a level playing field, American women athletes are competing, excelling, and reclaiming their time and their health. During the Summer Olympics and beyond, fans continue to celebrate the unique experience of being simultaneously Black, woman, athlete, and American.\n\nView objects relating to Women Olympians in the NMAAHC’s collection.\n\nWritten by Melanie Taylor, Curatorial Assistant\n\nPublished on July 22, 2024\n\n1964 Women’s Track and Field Olympic Team Trials Program\n\nCollection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gift of 1964 Olympic Silver Medalist Marilyn E.
