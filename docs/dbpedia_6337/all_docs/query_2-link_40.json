        "text": "In the blink of an eye, the 2024 Paris Olympics are already heading towards the finish line with 11 full days of action already in the books.\n\nIt's been a tremendous Olympic Games for the United States so far, as they're atop the medal count at 86 and have now taken a 24-22 gold medal lead over China through this week and a half of athletes from around the world competing at the highest level.\n\nThere's been an abundance of storylines for the U.S., whether it's Katie Ledecky breaking records in the pool becoming the most decorated United States woman athlete ever with nine gold medals and 14 in her trophy case and setting world records in the process, track star Noah Lyles becoming the fastest man in the world by winning the closest 100-meter dash race in 44 years (0.005 seconds) and earning his first ever Olympic gold medal and so much more.\n\nThen you have North Jersey native Scottie Scheffler -- the No. 1 ranked golfer in the world -- making a miraculous come-from-behind victory in the final round of Men's Golf by tying a course record and shooting a 62 on Sunday afternoon to win the gold medal.\n\nWith Day 11 coming to an end, here's the medal tracker for the 12 countries with double digit medals, where things stand for the United States and marquee events to look forward to for the U.S. prior to the Closing Ceremony on Sunday night.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics Medal tracker\n\nAs mentioned above, the United States has been atop the medal leaderboard a majority of these Olympic Games. However, the one area to keep an eye on has to be the gold medal race, with U.S. now overtaking China with 24 gold medals at the conclusion of the 11th day of the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nHeading into Tuesday evening on the east coast, the current medal tracker is as follows:\n\nUnited States: 86 medals (24 gold, 31 silver and 31 bronze)\n\nChina: 58 medals (22 gold, 20 silver and 16 bronze)\n\nFrance: 48 medals (13 gold, 16 silver and 19 bronze)\n\nGreat Britain: 46 medals (12 gold, 15 silver and 19 bronze)\n\nAustralia: 35 medals (14 gold, 12 silver and nine bronze)\n\nJapan: 29 medals (11 gold, six silver and 12 bronze)\n\nSouth Korea: 26 medals (11 gold, eight silver and seven bronze)\n\nItaly: 26 medals (nine gold, 10 silver and bronze bronze)\n\nNetherlands: 19 medals (eight gold, five silver and six bronze)\n\nCanada: 18 medals (six gold, four silver and eight bronze)\n\nGermany: 17 medals (eight gold, five silver and four bronze)\n\nBrazil: 13 medals (two gold, five silver and six bronze)\n\nGold medal events to watch going forward for United States\n\nThe USA women's gymnastics team wrapped up a very successful trip to the 2024 Paris Olympics with gymnasts Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles taking the silver and bronze medals respectively in the Women's Floor Final on Monday.\n\nWith the U.S. and China going back and forth ever so slightly in the gold medal tally, there's plenty of ways the United States can give themselves an advantage over the final five days of action.\n\nHere's a list of where the U.S. should and will likely take advantage in the gold medal category in the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nWomen's Olympic Basketball\n\nPerhaps no fellow team or individual is more favored to win a gold medal in the rest of the 2024 Olympics than the United States Women's Basketball Team (USWBT).\n\nTeam USA went undefeated in the group stage (3-0) and won all three contests by double digits to extend their winning streak to an unfathomable 58 games dating back to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.\n\nThe group is loaded with talent from top to bottom, with a mix of veterans and young stars that include MVPs such as A'ja Wilson and Diana Taurasi and New York Liberty's own Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu.\n\nAnything but a gold medal for this team would be a complete and utter shock given they've taken home gold every year since 1996.\n\nMen's Olympic Basketball\n\nThe second clear and obvious choice is also on the hardwood with the United States men's basketball team.\n\nLed by future Hall of Famers LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, Team USA is the runaway favorite to win gold with one of the best teams ever assembled.\n\nAfter cruising to a 122-87 victory over Brazil in the quarterfinal matchup on Tuesday night, the U.S. will now face Serbia in the semifinals on Thursday with a spot in the gold medal game on the line.\n\nThere's an argument that could be made that the United States toughest test will come in that gold medal match, facing either Germany or France, both who have top-tier NBA players on their rosters to compete with them.\n\nWhile an upset could come in the gold medal game on Saturday afternoon, the odds are quite low given this current roster on Team USA and that they've claimed in four straight Olympics and in seven of the last eight Olympic Games dating back to the Dream Team in 1992 (won bronze medal in 2004).\n\nTrack and Field\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone\n\nWith more track and field medals being awarded over the final week, one of the big-time favorites has to be McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nThe New Brunswick, New Jersey native made history on Tuesday afternoon, running the fastest ever 400-meter hurdles in an Olympic Semifinals (52.13 seconds), also a personal record, setting up a must see race between her and Netherlands' Femke Bol in the 400-meter Final on Thursday afternoon.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone got her Olympics underway in the first round of the Women's 400-meter hurdles on Sunday with a time of 53.60 seconds, winning by 1.66 seconds over Morocco's Ennadi Noura, who came in at 55.26 seconds.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is understandably the runaway favorite to earn the gold in the Women's 400-meter hurdles Final later this week with Bol likely being her toughest competition.\n\nShe also factors in to play a key role in the Women's 4x400-meter Final on Friday where she can earn herself and Team USA another gold medal.\n\nNoah Lyles\n\nLyles was the talk of the town on Sunday night, winning the aforementioned Men's 100-meter dash and ringing the bell to achieve the first gold medal of his career.\n\nWith the 27-year-old track star continuing his hot start to the Olympics by qualifying for the Men's 200-meter Final on Thursday after a win in Round 1 of the Men's 200-meter on Monday, he's the runaway favorite to win his second gold of the 2024 Paris Olympics come August 8 at 2:30 p.m. eastern time.\n\nThere's also a chance for a third gold medal, as Lyles is a part of the 4x100-meter Relay team with the Final coming on Friday, August 9 at 1:45 p.m. eastern time.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson\n\nRichardson fell just short of her first ever gold medal as she earned silver in the Women's 100-meter Final last weekend.\n\nFortunately for the 24-year-old track icon, she'll have another shot to lead Team USA to gold in the Women's 4x100-meter Relay Final on Friday, August 9 at 1:30 p.m.\n\nIf Richardson and Lyles both earn gold in their respective relay events, it could potentially be what pushes the United States over the top for the most gold medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics."
