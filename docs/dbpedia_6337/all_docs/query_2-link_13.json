        "text": "Women's long jump – 2:00 p.m. ET\n\nAmerican superstar Tara Davis-Woodhall is no stranger to winning, but she has a large task ahead of her as she continues her quest for her first Olympic medal. With two former world champions in the field alongside Davis-Woodhall, as well as her two American teammates, these women will have to leave it all on the runway as they go for gold.\n\nMEDAL FAVORITES:\n\nMalaika Mihambo (GER)\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall (USA)\n\nIvana Spanovic (SRB)\n\nTHE AMERICANS:\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall\n\nJasmine Moore\n\nMonae’ Nichols\n\nMen's javelin – 2:25 p.m. ET\n\nWith the reigning Olympic gold and silver medalists set to compete in the men’s javelin final, all eyes will be on who will claim the top step of the podium, and whether any athlete can unseat the two powerhouses. Medal contender Max Dehning was surprise elimination.\n\nMEDAL FAVORITES:\n\nNeeraj Chopra (IND)\n\nJakub Vadlejch (CZE)\n\nAnderson Peters (GRN)\n\nMen's 200m – 2:30 p.m. ET\n\nThe fastest man in the world has one chance to join track and field legends in the men’s 200 final. Noah Lyles will attempt to sweep the 100m and 200m gold, a feat that hasn’t been accomplished since Usain Bolt. Standing in his way are his American teammates Kenny Bednarek and Erriyon Knighton, as well as key competitor Letsile Tebogo, who got the better of Lyles in their semifinal match-up. Lyles’ quest all comes down to this race.\n\nMEDAL FAVORITES:\n\nNoah Lyles (USA)\n\nKenny Bednarek (USA)\n\nLetsile Tebogo (BOT)\n\nTHE AMERICANS:\n\nNoah Lyles\n\nKenny Bednarek\n\nErriyon Knighton\n\nWomen's 400m hurdles – 3:25 p.m. ET\n\nIn what very well may be the race of the Olympics, all eyes will be on Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Femke Bol as the two women compete in the women’s 400m final. With world records falling like dominoes before McLaughlin-Levrone and Bol the only woman capable of catching her, expect fireworks for the final in Paris.\n\nMEDAL FAVORITES:\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone (USA)\n\nFemke Bol (NED)\n\nRushell Clayton (JAM)\n\nTHE AMERICANS:\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone\n\nAnna Cockrell\n\nJasmine Jones\n\nWomen's 4x100m Relay Round 1 – 5:10 a.m. ET\n\nOne of the biggest surprises of the games so far has been the withdrawal of several key Jamaican sprinters, raising questions over who will take to the track as part of the juggernaut’s women’s 4x100 relay team. With a lightning quick pool of athletes for the United States to chose from, the first round will give the world the first glimpse over which women will have a chance to lock the gold.\n\nMEDAL FAVORITES:\n\nUnited States\n\nJamaica\n\nGreat Britain\n\nMen's 4x100 relay Round 1 – 5:35 a.m. ET\n\nAfter a strong showing in the individual men’s 100m, with all three athletes making it to the final and Lyles taking home gold, there is little surprise that the United States is the favorite going into the men’s 4x100m relay. With rosters yet to be announced, perennial powerhouse Jamaica and defending Olympic champion Italy stand as the biggest threats to the U.S. as the first round gets set.\n\nMEDAL FAVORITES:\n\nUnited States\n\nJamaica\n\nItaly"
