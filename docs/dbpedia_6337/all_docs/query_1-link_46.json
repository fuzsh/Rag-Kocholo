        "text": "1928 Amsterdam Summer Games\n\n3,014 Athletes, 46 Countries, 109 Events\n\nWith double the number of women that had competed at the 1924 Paris Games, an increase in nations, and the introduction of the Olympic flame, the Amsterdam Games were poised to be successful. Australian rower Henry Pearce epitomized this success, when he stopped his boat in the middle of a quarterfinal race to allow a family of ducks to cross his path. Pearce went on to win the race, and eventually the gold medal.\n\nSwimmer Albina Osipowich (Brown '33) won two gold medals in Amsterdam. She set an Olympic record of 1:11.0 en route to the gold in the 100-meter freestyle and helped set a world record in the 4x100meter freestyle relay. It should be noted that Osipowich is the League's first woman to participate in the Olympics, though she was in high school at the time. Osipowich continued to swim as a hobby at Brown. She later married Brown hoopster Harrison Van Aken '36.\n\nJohn S. Collier (Brown '29) won the bronze medal in the 110-meter hurdles. Henry Russell (Cornell '26) helped the United States equal a world record and win the gold medal in the 4x100-meter relay. Frederick Morgan Taylor (Dartmouth '25) followed up his 1924 gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles with a bronze medal in 1928.\n\nSabin Carr (Yale) set an Olympic record of 139 1/4 in the pole vault to win the gold medal. In 1927, Carr had become the first pole vaulter to clear 14 feet. B.V.D. Hedges (Princeton '30) won the silver medal in the high jump. The next track and field medal coming from a Princetonian would come 64 years later, at the 1992 Barcelona Games.\n\nThe Amsterdam Games featured the Olympic debut of fencer Norman Armitage (Columbia '30). Armitage didn't learn to fence until the beginning of his undergraduate days. He took this limited knowledge and extended it to its fullest capacity, competing in six Olympics (1928, 1932, 1936, 1948, 1952, and 1956). Were the 1940 and 1944 Games held and not cancelled due to World War II, Armitage probably would have ended his career as an eight-time Olympian. The current record for most Olympics competed in is nine."
