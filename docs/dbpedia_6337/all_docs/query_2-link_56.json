        "text": "June 25, 2024\n\nEUGENE, Ore. – Monmouth University track and field alum Allie Wilson '18, '19M will represent Team USA at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris this August.\n\nWilson ran a season best time of 1:58.32 and placed second in the women's 800m final after winning both of her heats in the first round and semifinals earlier at the Team USA Olympic Trials at Hayward Field on the University of Oregon's campus.\n\n\"I knew I had a chance,\" Wilson said following the race aired live on NBC. \"Given the depth of the 800m talent in this country, it was not going to be a small feat to make this team. I'm so honored.\"\n\nSitting in fourth entering the final straightaway, the Wallingford, Pa. native overtook LSU's Michaela Rose and Stanford's Juliette Whittaker to solidify her spot inside the Olympic standard time of 1:59.30. Nia Akins (first place, 1:57:36) and Whittaker (third, 1:58.45) will join Wilson in Paris as automatic qualifiers for the United States in the event.\n\nWilson becomes the third Monmouth athlete ever to qualify for an Olympic roster. Christie Pearce (formerly Rampone) competed for the U.S. women's soccer team four times at the world games from 2000-2012 and won three gold medals after playing for the Hawks from 1993-96. Wendy Boglioli attended Monmouth from 1973-76 and represented the United States at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal. Boglioli received a gold medal in the 4x100 freestyle relay, which set the World and Olympic Records, and a bronze medal in the 100-meter butterfly.\n\nThis year's USATF Indoor 800m champion, Wilson looks to continue her strong season on the world's biggest stage. She will make her Olympic debut on Friday, Aug. 2, in the first round that will air live on NBC and Peacock."
