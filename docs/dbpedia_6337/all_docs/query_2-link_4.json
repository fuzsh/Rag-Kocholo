        "text": "Courtney Lindsey and Kyree King helped Team USA’s 4×100-meter relay secure a spot in the men’s final and a chance to earn the country’s first medal in the event in two decades, but they likely won’t get a chance to actually race in the ultimate heat — despite Lindsey’s 8.88-second burst to finish the final leg.\n\nThe pair of American sprinters — 25 and 30 years old, respectively, and competing in their first Olympics — are expected to get swapped out of the event for Noah Lyles and Kenny Bednarek once the pair of top sprinters complete the men’s 200-meter final Thursday afternoon in the 2024 Olympics, according to NBC.\n\nTeam USA won its heat with a time of 37.47 seconds, 0.47 seconds ahead of South Africa, and was nearly a full second better than any country in the second heat, with China’s relay team taking that race in 38.24 seconds.\n\nNear the end of the third leg, King helped Team USA jump ahead of Great Britain and Italy, before Lindsey took the baton and finished the final stretch — the anchor leg typically reserved for Lyles, who took gold in the 100-meter race earlier in the Olympics — in 8.88 seconds.\n\nBut the event nearly turned disastrous after the first handoff between Christian Coleman and Fred Kerley, according to the Associated Press.\n\nColeman needed to grab Kerley’s wrist with his left hand while passing off with his right in order to keep their exchange intact, and while that dropped Team USA to fourth for the next stretch of the event, King and Lindsey helped them to recover — and then win convincingly.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS\n\nThe final results and medal count from the Paris Games\n\nJordan Chiles’ Olympic bronze not returned despite ‘conclusive’ evidence\n\nLuana Alonso returns to training after Olympics featured abrupt retirement\n\nWeightlifting medalist Emily Campbell tears into Paris’ Olympic Village\n\nThe Post’s 10 best moments of the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nIf Team USA earns a medal in the final, it’d mark their first in this Olympics event since 2004, when they lost to Great Britain in the final by one-hundredth of a second and took silver in Athens with a lineup of Shawn Crawford, Justin Gatlin, Coby Miller and Maurice Greene.\n\nSince then, there has been the failed baton exchange of 2008, when Darvis Patton couldn’t shift possession to Tyson Gay.\n\nThere was the silver medal in 2012 that was rescinded after Gay’s doping ban.\n\nThere was the 2016 disqualification — after making the final — and three years ago, in Tokyo, Team USA didn’t even make it to the final for the first time since the infamous Patton-Gay exchange.\n\nThis time, though, the men’s team made the final without two of their top sprinters, and now they’ll be tasked with shifting around a first-place relay lineup and keeping that time, or anything close to it, intact.\n\nAnd if that happens, a lengthy medal drought could end."
