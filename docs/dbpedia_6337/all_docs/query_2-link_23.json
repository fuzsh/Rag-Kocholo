        "text": "Former Clemson men's track and field athlete Rojé Stona set an Olympic record in the discus throw to win gold at the Paris Olympics on Wednesday.\n\nStona recorded a throw of 70.00 meters in the fourth round to win Jamaica's first Olympic gold for the event and the 2024 Games. He surpassed Lithuania's Mykolas Alekna, who set the Olympic record in the second round with 69.97.\n\n\"This is what I've been preparing for. This is what I dreamed of,\" Stone told the Jamaica Observer. \"To come here and actually do it, it's one of the best feelings of my life.\"\n\nThis is Stona's first Olympic medal. He is the fourth Clemson track athlete to win an individual gold medal and is the first male track athlete since Shawn Crawford in 2004 to win a gold. Stona, who graduated from Clemson in 2022, is the 25th Tigers athlete to earn a medal at the Olympics.\n\nWhile at Clemson, Stona was named the 2019 ACC champion in discus, was the runner-up at the 2022 NCAA Championships and earned All-American honors three times. He holds the school's record in discus with a throw of 65.11 in 2022.\n\nClemson has six athletes representing the university at the Paris Olympics. The list includes: Veronica Fraley (United States, women’s track, Natoya Goule (Jamaica, women’s track), Hal Hershfelt (United States, women’s soccer), Kailen Sheridan (Canada, women’s soccer), Aleksandra Stoilova (Australia, women’s track) and Stona.\n\nMORE: Why Dabo Swinney used Noah Lyles winning Olympic performance to motivate Clemson football\n\nDerrian Carter covers Clemson athletics for The Greenville News and the USA TODAY Network.
