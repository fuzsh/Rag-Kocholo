Nothin says yummie like a squirrel enjoying a large insect snack!

He also recently caught a katydid...that was truly gross stringy guts everywhere. He threw out the parts of the katydid he didn't like but he eats the entire cicada even most of the wings. He chased the cicada for about 15 min. He knew exactly what it was when he heard the wings. The video misses the first part where he eats the head and the wings are still flapping. I feel bad for the bug, but you can tell he is really enjoying his meal. Any one know about the nutritional value of cicadas?

He also has recently decided he really likes Jujube fruit Ziziphus zizyphus ....any one know if the seed inside is ok? it seems like an extract of the seed could be a sedative but pecan shows no sleepiness from eating one.

Thanks,

Julia

Yes, high in protein but also probably high in phosphorous....which could unbalance their c/p ratio...at least in waxworms. So he probably shouldn't eat to many.....luckily they are not to easy to catch! He caught 2 in the last two weeks.
