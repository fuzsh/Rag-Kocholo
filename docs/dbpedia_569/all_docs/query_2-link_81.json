        "meta_description": "Ziziphus mistol or mistol is a spiniferous tree of the family Rhamnaceae, that belongs to genus Ziziphus, natural (and very abundant) of certain areas of Gran Chaco, South America. The word 'mistol' derives from colonial era Spanish, from the word 'mixture' (mezcla) since it was believed that mistol was a hybrid between species of genus Schinopsis because of the likely color of its wood to Spaniard colonists' perception.
