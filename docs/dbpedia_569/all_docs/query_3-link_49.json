( 2006 ) proposed the name Ziziphus jujuba as the correct scientific name of the species for conservation against the para-tautonym Ziziphus zizyphus (L.) H. Karsten. 16\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Chinese jujube (Rhamnaceae; Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) is a deciduous fruit-bearing tree that is among the oldest domesticated tree crops, with evidence of cultivation going back over 7000 years. 1\n\nJujube, also called Chinese date, red date, or Tsao, is native to China. It originated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, and has been cultivated in China for more than 4,000 years and currently, there are 700 to 800 jujube cultivars. The plants traveled beyond Asia centuries ago and today are grown to some extent in Russia, northern Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and the southwestern United States. Jujube seedlings, inferior to the Chinese cultivars, were introduced into Europe at the beginning of the Christian era and carried to the U. S. (North Caroline) in 1837. 4,13\n\nJujube was cultivated at the USDA agricultural station in Chico, Californa, in 1908, where selections were identified and distributed throughout southern states. 1\n\nDescription\n\nDespite its limited cultivation in the United States, some cultivars of Chinese jujube have been shown to be well-adapted for production in Florida. Their rapid growth, prolific production, and resistance to abiotic stress suggest they may have at least some commercial potential, especially for small, local markets, including those that serve an Asian clientele. 1\n\nJujube is a deciduous ornamental fruit tree 15 to 30 ft in height with very hard, strong wood. Branches are zigzagged with paired spines (Fig. 4,8) in young trees. Depending on the cultivar, tree growth habit varies from broad spreading canopies to very narrow and upright. 3\n\nThe jujube can be easily confused with the Indian jujube (Z. mauritiana Lam), which is a tropical plant of the same genus, whereas the Chinese jujube is a cold-hardy deciduous plant. 3 It is a rugged tree, drought tolerant, has few pests, and grows well on poor soil. The jujube is a worthwhile addition to the home garden because, even when neglected, it produces heavy crops of good quality. 17\n\nSo sorry,\n\nyour browser\n\ndoes not support this\n\nvideo\n\nVideo: 10:24\n\nGrowing jujubes v1\n\nGrowth habit\n\nAs the growing season commences, each node of a woody branch has the possibility of producing one to ten branchlets, with older branches producing the most branchlets. Most of these branchlets are deciduous, dying in winter and falling from the plant in spring. Here and there a robust shoot might appear instead of a branchlet and this shoot becomes part of the permanent structure of the tree. Shoot of intermediate vigor are half-deciduous, losing only their distal portions at the end of the season. 9\n\nBranching in jujube trees is complicated, with 4 types each having different functions: primary (extension), secondary (side branches), mother-bearing (MB, fruiting spur), and fruit-bearing (branchlet). There are also (principally) 2 types of buds, main and secondary, and these occur at each node in primary, secondary and MB branches. The main bud of the primary branch will keep expanding the tree canopy with primary and MB branches, while the secondary buds can produce secondary branches. In secondary branches the main bud can produce primary or MB branches, and secondary buds can form fruiting branchlets. In MB branches, the main bud can produce primary or MB branches, and secondary buds the fruiting branchlets. The MB branch grows very slowly, only 0.04-0.08 in. (1-2 mm) pa, and can produce several branchlets each season. 14\n\nLeaves\n\nThe small, ovate or oval leaves are 1-2 inches long and a shiny bright green. In the autumn, the leaves turn bright yellow before falling. There are usually two spines at the base of each leaf. Some spines may be hooked while others are long daggers. Virtually thornless cultivars are known. As the growing season commences, each node of a woody branch produces one to ten branchlets. Most of these are deciduous, falling from the plant in autumn. 13\n\nFig. 4 Fig. 5 Fig. 6\n\nFig. 4. Z. jujuba (Jinjolero, azufaifo), Hojas de una rama muy joven; espinas nodal/axilares, Avda de La Libertad, Albatera\n\nFig. 6. Foliage at Ammuguda Railway Station, Hyderabad\n\nFlowers\n\nFlowering occurs on fruiting spurs which give rise to a cyme inflorescence bearing numerous, small yellow perfect flowers. 1\n\nSmall, inconspicuous, yellow flowers grow in clusters of one to half a dozen or more in leaf axils of the growing branchlets. Flower buds are initiated the same year the flowers open. The plants have an extended blossoming period that continues sporadically throughout the growing season, with the first blossoms to mature being those closest to the base of a branchlet. Individual flowers, however, are receptive to pollen for only a day or less. 9\n\nFig. 12\n\nFig. 12. Flores en antesis, cultivado, Camino de la Azarbe de Patricio, Albatera (Provincia de Alicante, EspaÃ±a)\n\nFlowering and Fruiting of Chinese Jujubes in Florida, HortScience pdf\n\nJujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) Flowering and Fruiting in the Southwestern United States, HortScience pdf\n\nPollination\n\nJujube types may be characterized by the time of day that they flower, which falls into one of two types. One type is open between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m., the other between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., and flowering time is acutely affected by weather, especially ambient temperature. 1\n\nCross-pollination always increases fruit set and improves fruit size, quality, and seed development. Some home gardeners have pollination problems in the United States. Until a thoroughly jujube fruit pollination and fruit set study has been completed, it is recommended to plant two cultivars for cross-pollination. 3\n\nFruit\n\nFruits are between a cherry and a plum in size, roundish-egg shaped like small plums (sometimes round or pear-shaped). The amount of flesh is very variable between selections. The skin is bright green and shiny when the fruit is mature â at this stage (Fig. 1) the flesh is crisp, sweet, with an apple flavour; if left on the tree, the skin begins to brown in a few spots, the brown areas coalesce to completely cover the surface, then the fruit begins to dry and wrinkle; by the time it is fully ripe the jujube is a rich red-bronze and most resembles a prune or dry date â hence the name Chinese date. The texture now is chewy and resembling a date, and the taste has improved (Fig. 2). 12\n\nJujube fruits have a high concentration of sugar (about thirty percent fresh, about seventy-five percent dried), and one elongated pit. 9\n\nFig. 18 Fig. 19 Fig. 20\n\nFig. 21 Fig. 22\n\nFig. 18.

Diagram of common jujube seed (Z. zizyphus) and its internal structure\n\nVarieties\n\nCurrently, there are 700 to 800 jujube cultivars in China, including fresh eating, drying, multipurpose (good for both drying and fresh eating), candied, and ornamental. In the U.S., jujube cultivars are very limited. They include Frank Meyerâs cultivars, cultivars recently imported from China or other jujube growing countries, those released from the USDA Chico breeding program, and a few selections from seedlings across the country. 4\n\nCultivars Recommended for Florida, University of Florida\n\nJujuba, Fruit for the Reluctant Gardener! Just Fruits And Exotics\n\nHarvesting\n\nHarvesting can begin as soon as the green fruits develop a few brown spots on the skin â they will then fully ripen off the tree; if you have dry conditions, then leave them on the tree to ripen and harvest them as they fall to the ground. The fruits ripen gradually (over a month or more) and not all at once, and should be picked or shaken every few days over this period. 12\n\nIn humid climates, fruits should be picked when starting to turn brownish-red and dried either in a solar dryer and/or in an oven at 115 Â°F (45 Â°C), stirring. If not picked, rain and humid weather can cause the skin to crack, and then fungi can develop in the cracks. 12\n\nSo sorry,\n\nyour browser\n\ndoes not support this\n\nvideo\n\nVideo: 4.27\n\nHow to grow and harvest jujubes v2\n\nPropagation\n\nPropagation is by seed, suckers, or grafting. Young plants transplant easily. 1\n\nSeed propagation is fairly easy. Jujube seeds have a hard, rough, pointed outer shell which has a distinct suture line aligned from end to end. This shell needs to be removed to facilitate reliable germination; the best way is to carefully align the suture in the blades of a pair of secateurs and cut firmly â the seed usually comes out unscathed from this operation! 12\n\nFruiting on grafted plants starts after 2-4 years; seedlings may take 3-7 years. The first few crops do not give a true indication of eventual fruit size. Although trees are usually self-fertile, fruits are bigger and more numerous with cross pollination. 12\n\nJujube (Ziziphus jujuba) Grafting, New Mexico State University pdf\n\nClimate\n\nThe trees have been described as having a low chilling requirement (<400 hours) and perform well in protected cultivation. Moreover, they have a higher heat unit requirement to break dormancy, being one of the later fruit trees to leaf out in Florida. 1\n\nEstablished trees are cold tolerant to -20Â°F (-29Â°C), yet they grow well in hot, humid conditions. 1\n\nPlanting\n\nJujubes can grow and set fruit well in a wide range of soil conditions, from sandy to loam to clay, and from acidic to alkaline (pH 5.0-8.5). Jujubes can survive in barren soils. 4\n\nJujubes should be set out 10 to 15 feet apart since they require high light intensities for good production. Upon setting out new, bare root trees, top the plant to 3 or 4 feet and remove all side branches to leave only a whip. New, stronger branches will emerge from each bud just below the point where the old branches were pruned. 13\n\nPruning\n\nFruit is borne on the current season's growth, hence there is no danger of pruning off fruiting wood; pruning should concentrate on removing dead or dying wood, and keeping the tree open and well ventilated. Initially it may be wise to select a framework of 3-4 branches in a pyramid form. 12\n\nJujube Training and Pruning Basics, New Mexico State University pdf\n\nIrrigation\n\nThe trees can survive extremely dry weather and will set fruit in wet years, which makes them good backyard or landscape trees. 3\n\nFertilization\n\nThe fertilizer rates applied to jujubes have not been formally published. It is currently unknown what nutrient requirements and timing are specific to Florida. The use of proprietary NPK plus trace element fertilizers, such as 12.4.8 plus trace elements, provides a convenient approach to fertilizing. 1\n\nHeavy applications of quick-release nitrogen should be avoided because this can increase fruit drop. 1\n\nFood Uses\n\nThe fresh jujube fruit is generally crisp like an apple, with similar texture, but generally not as juicy. The spongy flesh has a flavor reminiscent of apple or Asian pear with sweetness and a tangy aftertaste. The flavor and less-foamy texture improve as the tree ages. 1\n\nThe ripe fruits are eaten fresh, dried like dates, boiled with millet and rice, stewed, baked, pickled, glaceÃ©d, or used as coffee substitute.
