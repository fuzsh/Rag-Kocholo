        "text": "Our wrinkly mystery “nuts” in the wrinkly fruit last week were from jujube or Chinese date,Â Ziziphus zizyphus (older: Ziziphus jujuba).\n\nJujube have interesting fruit.\n\nAt first the fruit look (and smell) like a oval apple.\n\nOver time the fruit become reddish brown and wrinkly, as you can see towards the top in this photograph.\n\nOnce dried, they look like dates.\n\nInside the fruit is a “nut” or “pit” rather like from an olive. It turns out that I mislead you last week because this is not really the seed.\n\n(Illustration by L.H. @ USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database)\n\nAs you can see from this drawing, inside the “nut” are two seeds lying side by side. It would require a sharp knife and patience to get them out.\n\nThe tree looks somewhat like a spindly pear tree and has similar growth habits. It is deciduous in the winter and requires a brief chill to properly set fruit. Although originally from Asia, they do grow in the low deserts of Arizona.\n\nHave you ever seen a jujube? Did you try the fruit? What did you think of it?"
