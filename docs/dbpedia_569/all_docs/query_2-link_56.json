        "text": "What Is Jujube Fruit?\n\nJujube fruit has been eaten and used in traditional medicine for over 3,000 years. Today, it is popular all over the world.\n\nJujube fruit (Ziziphus jujuba) is also known as the Chinese date, jujube, or red date. The plant is native to China and has been grown in the U.S. for more than 175 years.\n\nThe jujube fruit ranges in shape from round to pear-shaped. It may be as small as a cherry or as big as a plum. It has a thin, edible skin and whitish flesh. When ripe, the fruit turns dark red. After turning fully red, the fruit begins to wrinkle and soften, but it is still edible.\n\nJujube vs. dates\n\nWhile it may also be known as the Chinese or red date, the jujube fruit is not a date. It's a species of ziziphus in the buckthorn family.Â\n\nThe date palm tree belongs to the arecaceae family and grows in Southwest Asia, North Africa, Australia, Mexico, South America, southern Africa, and the U.S.\n\nJujube Fruit Benefits\n\nJujube fruits have been used in traditional medicines for thousands of years. More research is needed to clarify its effects on people.\n\nHigh in antioxidants. Jujube fruits are a rich source of compounds such as flavonoids, polysaccharides, and triterpenic acids. Some of these compounds have antioxidant properties.\n\nAntioxidants are substances that may prevent or delay types of cell damage, including damage caused by chemicals called free radicals. Youâre exposed to free radicals from air pollution, cigarette smoke, and sunlight. Your body also makes free radicals during normal metabolic processes.\n\nMay improve sleep. Chinese jujube is used in traditional medicine to help promote sleep. Early research suggests that this may be due to the antioxidant properties of the fruits.\n\nMay help with digestion and constipation. Jujube has high fiber content. A 100-gram serving of dried jujube has 6 grams of dietary fiber.\n\nYou should aim for 25 to 35 grams of fiber a day. A diet thatâs high in fiber has many benefits, including:\n\nPrevents constipation\n\nMakes you feel full for longer, which can help you with weight loss\n\nHelps improve your blood sugar levels\n\nReduces your risk of diseases like colorectal cancer\n\nLowers your cholesterol, which lowers your risk of heart disease\n\nJujube fruit extract may also help to relieve constipation. A small study found that those who took liquid jujube extract had improved constipation symptoms compared to those who took a placebo.\n\nMay boost immunity. Jujube fruit may be able to boost your immune system, as itâs rich in vitamin C.\n\nDepending on the size of the fruit, eating one to three jujube fruits will meet the daily vitamin C recommendations of 90 milligrams for men and 75 milligrams for women.\n\nSide Effects of Jujube Fruit\n\nOne of the traditional medicinal uses of jujube is as a laxative. While thereâs been little research on its laxative effect on people, you may want to be careful with the amount of jujube fruit that you eat.\n\nExperts say that you may also want to avoid eating the fruit if you take antidepressant drugs like venlafaxine. It may interact with such drugs.\n\nEarly animal studies have found that jujube extract may interact with some seizure medications, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, and phenytoin.\n\nTalk to your doctor if youâre taking any of these medications and also want to eat this jujube fruit or its extracts.Â\n\nHow to Eat Jujube Fruit\n\nYou can eat jujube fruit raw. Fresh ones are sweet and have an apple-like texture.\n\nThe fruit is also commonly found dried. These dried Chinese jujubes are known as red dates. The dried fruits can be eaten directly, but theyâre also often cooked into soups and tea. Dried red dates can be used in place of raisins or palm date fruits in cakes and other desserts.\n\nJujube fruits can also be roasted, smoked, soaked in liquor, candied, juiced, and made into jams and spreads.\n\nJujube Tea\n\nJujube tea is a a type of tea made from dried jujube fruit. Like eating the fruit on its own, putting it in tea may ease constipation, boost your immune system, and help you sleep.\n\nJujube tea nutrition\n\nThis type of tea has vitamin C, polyphenols, potassium, iron, and B vitamins.\n\nHow to make jujube tea\n\nYou can make a tea with only dried jujube fruit, or add spices and other ingredients like cinnamon and ginger."
