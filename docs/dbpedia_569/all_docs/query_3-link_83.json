        "text": "Morphological characteristics of Ziziphus jujuba accessions, including ‘Ilbon’, were investigated to verify the possibility of ‘Ilbon’ as a breeding material. ‘Ilbon’ has smaller leaves and fruits and a lower total soluble solids content compared to the major Z. jujuba accessions. However, total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity were highest in ‘Ilbon’ among the Z. jujuba accessions. In addition, ‘Ilbon’ could produce intact seeds and seed productivity of ‘Ilbon’ was highest compared with major Z. jujuba accessions. Principal component analysis and clustering analysis using the morphological characteristics of Z. jujuba accessions have been classified them to geographical origin. In particular, ‘Ilbon’ was clearly distinguished from the major Z. jujuba accessions. Therefore, ‘Ilbon’, which has the highest seed productivity and functional component, will be used as a material for cross breeding and will promote genetic study of Z. jujuba."
