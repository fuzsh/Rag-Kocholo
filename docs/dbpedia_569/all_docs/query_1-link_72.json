        "text": "Fighting against dandruff.\n\nThey are generally linked to an inflammatory reaction caused by the proliferation of the Malassezia fungus. These reactions are also promoted by the sensitivity of the scalp following the use of intolerable care products and skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. The molecules present in the jujube bark extract act specifically on these causes of dandruff. Indeed, betulinic acid and ursolic acid have excellent anti-inflammatory properties. It has been observed that the saponins contained in the jujube bark extract cleanse the scalp and hair of impurities and scales by preventing the production of sebum and slowing down the production of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), responsible for triggering itching.\n\nA study tested a shampoo containing 1% jujube bark extract on volunteers with dandruff. A second group used a shampoo without the extract as a control. Those in the Jujube group noticed a decrease in dandruff within 72 hours of using the shampoo and 37% less dandruff after six days.\n\nPreventing oxidation reactions.\n\nThe bark extract contains jujubosides, a type of saponin that provides intense antioxidant protection while strengthening and revitalizing the scalp. It's no coincidence that this tree is considered one of the easiest to grow and maintain in good health: it indeed tolerates all weather conditions, from drought to torrential rains. One of the reasons could be these saponins, creating a sort of armor against all conditions that attempt to damage it."
