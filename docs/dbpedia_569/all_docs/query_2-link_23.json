        "text": "Overview\n\nDeciduous tree growing to 10m by 7m at a fast rate\n\nIt is in flower from April - May, and the seeds ripen in October\n\nThe flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female organs) and are pollinated by insects. Self fertile\n\nSuitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils\n\nSuitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils\n\nNeeds full sun\n\nIt prefers well drained soil\n\nCan grow in nutritionally poor soil\n\nTolerates drought\n\nCharacteristics\n\nform: Deciduous tree\n\nlayer :Lower canopy\n\nhabit: Suckering with new plants from underground runners\n\nheight x width (m): 10 x 7\n\nProducts\n\nFruit: First cultivated in China for its fruit over 4000 years ago. Although the fruit from this tree is very popular in China today, it is largely unknown in the west. Fruit is round, somewhere between the size of a cherry and a plum, an is dark red when ripe. Delicious fruit, slightly apple -like in flavour, and reportedly highly valued medicinally. Can also be eaten dried. Some research conducted in Japan has shown that jujube increases immune-system resistance\n\nFlowers: Fairly low key and small, with five inconspicuous yellowish-green petals. Attractive to some insects\n\nLeaves and twigs: Leaves are glossy green with a finely toothed margin. Branches can have spines\n\nFunctions, behaviours\n\nResponds well to coppicing\n\nPrefers an open loam and a hot dry position\n\nTrees form a deep taproot\n\nWhere the climate suits it, the plant can escape from cultivation and become invasive\n\n​Best in hot and somewhat dry climates in full sun.​"
