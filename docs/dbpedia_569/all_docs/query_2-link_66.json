It has become naturalized in tropical Africa, India, China and the Mediterranean where it is commercially important. 1\n\nOrigin and Distribution\n\nThe Indian jujube is native from the Province of Yunnan in southern China to Afghanistan, Malaysia and Queensland, Australia. It is cultivated to some extent throughout its natural range but mostly in India where it is grown commercially and has received much horticultural attention and refinement despite the fact that it frequently escapes and becomes a pest. 2\n\nLeaves\n\nLeaves variable, alternate, in 2 rows, oblong-elliptic, 2.5-6 x 1.5-5 cm, with tip rounded or slightly notched base; finely wavy-toothed on edges, shiny green and hairless above; dense, whitish, soft hairs underneath (Fig. 6). 3\n\nThe major veins in the leaves are nearly parallel (Fig. 22). 10\n\nFig. 7 Fig. 8 Fig. 9\n\nFig. 8. Branches of Indian jujube typically zigzag, with a thorn and leaf at nearly every angle 10\n\nFlowers\n\nInflorescence axillary cymes, 0.4-0.8 in. (1-2 cm) long, with 7-20 flowers; peduncles 0.07-0.11 in. (2-3 mm) long; flowers 0.07-0.11 in. (2-3 mm) across; pedicels 0.11-0.3in. (3-8 mm) long; calyx with 5 deltoid lobes, hairy outside, glabrous within; petals 5, subspathulate, concave, reflexed. 3\n\nFlowers of the Indian jujube are small and inconspicuous, greenish-white, and emit an unpleasant odor. 10\n\nFig. 13 Fig. 14 Fig. 15 Fig. 16\n\nFig. 13. Fleurs de jujubier (flowers)\n\nFig. 15. Z. mauritiana flowers\n\nFig. 16. Rhamnaceae (buckthorn family) Z. mauritiana flowers close-up\n\nPollination\n\nPollen of the Indian jujube is thick and heavy. It is not airborne but is transferred from flower to flower by honeybees (Apis spp.), a yellow wasp (Polister hebraeus), and the house fly (Musca domestica).\n\nThe cultivars 'Banarasi Karaka', 'Banarasi Pewandi' and 'Thornless' are self-incompatible. 'Banarasi Karaka' and 'Thornless' are reciprocally cross-incompatible. 2\n\nFruit development takes 4 months in early cultivars to 6 months in late ones. 3\n\nFruit\n\nFruit a drupe, globose to ovoid, up to 2.4 x 1.6 in. (6 x 4 cm) in cultivation, usually much smaller when wild; skin smooth or rough, glossy, thin but tough, yellowish to reddish or blackish; flesh white, crisp, juicy, subacid to sweet, becoming mealy in fully ripe fruits. Seed a tuberculate and irregularly furrowed stone, containing 1-2 elliptic brown kernels each 6 mm long. 3\n\nFruiting starts after 3-5 years and is usually very abundant. 3\n\nAt maturity, fruits are generally light yellowish orange to almost brown in color. Many people say that when these are eaten fresh, they have flavor somewhat resembling that of a green apple. Older fruits which have been allowed to sit for a few days before being eaten often will have a flavor almost like a date. 5\n\nFig. 19 Fig. 20 Fig. 21\n\nFig. 19. Fruit developing.\n\nFig. 20. Z. mauritiana, Bue Maria, Gorongosa National Park. Habitat: Disturbed area In shade of trees on wooded rocky outcrop.\n\nFig. 21. Ponsigue (Z. mauritiana) in Margarita island.\n\nHarvesting\n\nThe crop ripens intermittently from July through October. Under favorable circumstances, a tree may produce crops exceeding 100 pounds. Change in color is the primary factor for determining fruit maturity. The fruit can be stored for about a week at room temperature. Dried fruit will keep for several months. 6\n\nPropagation\n\nThe Indian jujube is widely grown from seeds, which may remain viable for 2 1/2 years but the rate of germination declines with age. Superior selections are grafted or budded onto seedlings of wild types. Vegetative propagation of highly prized varieties was practiced near Bombay about 1835 but kept secret until 1904, and then was quickly adopted by many people. Ring-budding has been popular in the past but has been largely superseded by shield-budding or T-budding. Grafted plants are less thorny than seedlings. 2\n\nTo select seeds for growing rootstocks, the stones must be taken from fruits that have fully ripened on the tree. They are put into a 17 to 18% salt solution and all that float are discarded. The stones that sink are dipped in 500 ppm thiourea for 4 hours, then cracked and the separated seeds will germinate in 7 days. Seeds in uncracked stones require 21 to 28 days. If seeds are sown in spring, the seedlings will be ready for budding in 4 months. 2\n\nCulture\n\nZ. mauritiana is a hardy tree that copes with extreme temperatures and thrives under rather dry conditions. Fruit quality is best under hot, sunny and dry conditions, but there should be a rainy season to support extension growth and flowering, ideally leaving enough residual soil moisture to carry the fruit to maturity. It is known for its ability to withstand adverse conditions, such as salinity, drought and waterlogging. 3\n\nPruning\n\nPruning should be done during the first year of growth to reduce the plant to one healthy shoot, and branches lower than 30 in (75 cm) should be removed. At the end of the year, the plant is topped. During the 2nd and 3rd years, the tree is carefully shaped. Thereafter, the tree should be pruned immediately after harvesting at the beginning of dormancy and 25 to 50% of the previous year's growth may be removed. Sometimes a second lighter pruning is performed just before flowering. There will be great improvement in size, quality and number of fruits the following season. 2\n\nFertilizing\n\nTrees should be fertilized two to three times a year with a good quality complete fertilizer for good growth and fruiting and the heaviest fruit production occurs during the early spring months. 5\n\nIrrigation\n\nDuring hot weather and also in the period of fruit development, irrigation is highly beneficial. Water-stress will cause immature fruit drop. 2\n\nPests/diseases\n\nNo serious pests or diseases bother the jujube in Florida. 6\n\nFood Uses\n\nFruit is eaten fresh or dried and can be made into a floury meal, butter, or a cheeselike paste, used as a condiment. Also used for candy making and pickling. The fruit is a good source of carotene, vitamins A and C, and fatty oils. A refreshing drink is prepared by macerating fruits in water. In Indonesia, young leaves are cooked as a vegetable. 3\n\nIf one has an abundance of fruit, it can be frozen for long periods without any deterioration of quality. 5\n\nThe India Jujube, Fifty Tropical Fruits of Nassau\n\nMedicinal Properties **\n\nLeaves, fruits and bark are used medicinally. Pounded roots are added to drinking water and given to poultry suffering from diarrhoea and to humans for indigestion. 3\n\nOther Uses\n\nIn India, the leaves are also gathered to feed tasar silkworms; tasar silk, highly prized, is the only silk commercially exploited in the tropics. 3\n\nIn India, Z. mauritiana trees are a host for the lac insects, Kerria lacca, which are found on the leaves and make an orange-red resinous substance. The purified resin makes the high-quality ber shellac that is used in fine lacquer work and to produce sealing wax and varnish. 3\n\nZ. mauritiana yields a medium-weight to heavy hardwood easy to work and takes a high finish. It is hard and strong. The wood is used for general construction, furniture and cabinet work, tool handles, agricultural implements, tent pegs, golf clubs, gun stocks, sandals, yokes, harrows, toys, turnery, household utensils, bowling pins, baseball bats, chisels and packaging. It is also suitable for the production of veneer and plywood. Basically, any product that needs a durable, close-grained wood can be made from it. 3\n\nThe bark, including the root bark, has served in tanning; when pounded and mashed in water, it yields brown and grey or reddish dyes. 3Other Edible Ziziphus species:\n\nChinese Jujube (Z. jujuba)\n\nGeneral\n\nThe name ‘Ziziphus’ is often erroneously written as Zizyphus. The generic name is derived from the latinized version of the Arabic vernacular name ‘zizouf’ for Z. jujuba. 3\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Indian Jujube, Archives of the Rare Fruit Council of Australia\n\nThe Indian Jujube, Tropical Fruit News, RFCI\n\nBiology and Control of Indian Jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana): A Weed to Watch in Florida Pastures and Natural Areas, University of Florida pdf\n\nList of Growers and Vendors"
