Ashkanani\n\nAbstract\n\nZiziphus, locally known as sider or ber is a multipurpose tree species used for food, fodder, and medicine and desertification control in arid lands. It is one of the worldÂ’s most nutritious plant rich in vitamins, minerals and amino acids. It is well known for its multipurpose attributes, wide adaptability towards the arid environment and ease of establishment. It tolerates a wide range of environmental conditions and needs less water for its growth and establishment. As one of the true native species of Arabia, Ziziphus spina-christi and Z. numularia are growing in Kuwait as native plants along with the exotic plants. Next to the date palm, it is an important fruit crop that is highly adapted to the environmental conditions of Kuwait and being cultivated mainly for fruit production and landscaping. However, being an old native desert crop of Arabian countries, this plant species has not received much attention among the researchers. Recently, an introduction trial on improved cultivars of Z. mauritiana for fruit production and Z. xylopyrus for desertification control, selection of superior genotypes among the local Z. spina-christi, and research on the development of clonal propagation technology via plant cell tissue and organ culture have been carried out at the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR). The field performance of both the introduced species of Ziziphus in Kuwait proved it to be a drought tolerant multipurpose plant species that can be grown in Kuwait for fruit production, desertification control and other environmental protection programs to enhance the biodiversity in addition to its food, fodder and medicinal values.\n\nCitation\n\nSudhersan, C. and Ashkanani, J.H.
