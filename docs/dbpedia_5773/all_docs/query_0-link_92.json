        "text": "From The Field Operation K-Matrix: God Impersonates the Personal Self For Perfect Manifestation of Unlimited Potential For Unification on Earth /Quantum Time Digital Poise & Entanglement with Brahman\n\n“Our universe is an idea of God. All began with the wish of God that a cosmos with thinking beings should be there. He spoke a mantra (ELI) and the multiverse was started. Consciousness is the center of the universe from which everything is developing…On earth, there will be a golden age in the future, based on the association of spirituality and science..And God’s light will flood through all people, (…) all love each other, they will laugh and be happy.”\n\n– ‘Das Urwort/The Physics of God, Michael König, German Quantum Physicist and Mystic\n\nVerily know the Supreme One to be Bliss. (Brihadaranka Upnanishad)\n\n“Therefore, says the divine Teacher, it is the knowledge at once of the field and its knower, ksetra-ksetrajnayor jnanam, a united and even unified self-knowledge and world-knowledge, which is the real illumination and the only wisdom. For both soul and nature are the Brahman, but the true truth of the world of Nature can only be discovered by the liberated sage who possesses also the truth of the spirit. One Brahman, one reality in Self and Nature is the object of all knowledge”. – The Field and its Knower, Essays on Gita, Sri Aurobindo\n\n‘Embryo[Hiranyagarbha] which, in the beginning, poured forth upon the universe a stream of gold.’ – Atharva Veda /In Quantum Cosmology this point or embryo or seed is to be regarded as the point of singularity from which universe exploded into being.\n\n“The Primordial Power and the Supreme Brahman are identical. You can never think of the one without the other. They are like the gem and its brilliance. One cannot think of the brilliance without the gem, or of the gem without its brilliance. Again, it is like snake and its wriggling motion. One cannot think of the wriggling motion without the snake, or of the snake without its wriggling motion. These are two aspects of Reality: Purusha and Prakriti- He who is the Purusha is also Prakriti. Both are the embodiment of Bliss.” — Sri Aurobindo\n\nWhat’s there inside a fruit?\n\nPulp\n\nWhat’s inside the pulp?\n\nSeed\n\nWhat’s inside the seeds after you smash the endosperm and the cotyledons?\n\nNothing\n\nHow can the tree sprout from that nothing and create the pulp-fiction of lives?\n\nThe mystery unravels when we know the true essence – The Sat from which everything in the universe emanates and creates different forms, shapes, colours, tastes in varying proportion and degrees –each bearing the same essence folded in the chit (consciousness) to give a desired result or outcome through an unique experience which is the function of the cosmic principle of ananda. Everything we see, hear, taste and touch bears the sat-chit-ananda but beneath the dual surface of things. Reality is far deeper than the surface impression it projects, to understand it, to acquire knowledge about it, one has to worship the Sat (The Absolute Being) with complete surrender. Science gives you a rationale about the surface of things, metaphysics takes you a little further, religion takes you nowhere, art helps you wonder on the spectacle and it’s mysteries, and only spirituality can take you towards the perfect destiny (Destiny Matrix)\n\nRemember the Divine Essence is Sat –the Brahman which has no beginning no end –that is Santana Dharma –it’s the Eternal Dharma\n\nReligion is hand-crafted and manmade to suit their supremacy – it carries the superficial aspects of the divine essence.\n\nThe totality of the creation is Santana dharma – that which is forever is the Brahman in things. The unmanifest can be in two or more places at the same time (uncertainty principle) but when it manifests you locate it in one place – Learning from the Double-Split experiment? Brahman is Brahman – Life Divine!\n\nWhat is Spirituality? It’s inherent causality of experience to acquire the true learning power which doesn’t discriminate between things in the world but probes into it with full faith in one’s ability to know and become the Knower.\n\nThe true essence – the Brahman of which the universe is made of is Brahman only – it’s devoid of any qualities (nir-guna Satya) – when you observe or measure you add qualities to it be it mass or colour or shape or size.\n\nOnly interactions between the Observer and the Object of Observation brings it to reality – we are observers observing the universe so it exists for us – we perceive it in a certain way and our perception creates the reality around us.\n\nThis is the new science of spirituality – the process of Observation is based on complex mathematical functions which we still are not fully aware of – because to probe it we have to go outside this multiverse and become the Ultimate Observer – The Master Magician!\n\nThat’s not the work given to us! Though the creation exists for us – we are co-creators in this conscious universe – our aim is to align ourselves with the essence – The Sat to experience the Brahman – The All Absolute Supreme Being who has fathered us to take in his arms all that we are and will be.\n\nReality cannot be defined by statistical probability or by use of random number generators – it’s subtler than the WIMP we are trying to locate in the LHCs. But, our approach is right and if we are awakened beings then the true Sat will unfold slowly as the bud labours through the night to fulfill it’s flowering like a dance to the sun in the dawn of offering! This is what I meant by ‘inherent loveliness’ in things – it gives us hope without which no resurrection is possible!\n\nWe resurrect our lives – our new understanding is a rebirth\n\nBiologically the cells are communicating with the Field of Energy – exchanging information we need to be aware of it!\n\nWhen a system attains harmony i.e. it organizes itself it’s entropy becomes low – to create that state in us we need to activate our will-force to harness the positive power of the mind – it’s the matrix of all matter – the mind is also the body in the gross terms containing the tejas (fire), Apas (water) and Annam (food) and when the positive energy inflow passes into the mind of the cells through Kriya we create stability in our quantum system.\n\nThe Divine permeates your body, your mind\n\nOur trillion cell- phones are ringing simultaneously\n\nExchanging data with the Field\n\nConnect your own way that’s your unique kriya to attain Samadhi or liberation\n\nEvery call is answered – smile upon a smile takes sadness away\n\nIt’s a promise: “Whosoever knows me,” says the Godhead, “as the unborn who is without origin, mighty lord of the worlds and peoples, lives unbewildered among mortals and is delivered from all sin and evil…Whosoever knows in its right principles this my pervading lordship and this my Yoga, unites himself to me by an untrembling Yoga…I destroy for them the darkness which is born of the ignorance.” – The Supreme Word of Gita, Essays on Gita, Sri Aurobindo\n\n-J"
