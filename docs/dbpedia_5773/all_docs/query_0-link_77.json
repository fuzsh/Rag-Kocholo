        "text": "Today’s topic is Chitteswari Durga Temple in Cossipore. Which temple will you go to and why? Small guide for you. Thirty-three million gods and goddesses! The main deity is “Maa Kali”. Majority of Bengalis are Shakta. People from to the bottom of the society majority are Kali devotees. Sri Ramakrishna also worshiped Kali. Temples of Kali are everywhereMany people call this temple ‘Sarbamangala Temple’. “Maa Kali” who is “Maa Durga” is a variation of the same mother.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThe Mythical Stories Behind Chitteswari Durga Temple\n\nAt that time, Ramprasad Sen worked at Durga Charan Mitra’s zamindari seresta. Once a month, Ramprasad would visit his Halishahar’s house by boat from kolkata. On the way to ganga baksha (through Ganges river).On the way, he’d sing one song after the next, which was a hymn composed by Sadhak Ramprasad Sen.\n\nThe sound of Ramprasad’s song reached the Chitteswari Durga Temple. But Devi could not hear that song properly. Devi Chitteswari said directly to Ramprasad, “What are you singing? I can’t hear well! He retorted to the goddess, “If you want to listen to the song, turn your face to the Ganga!” Devi did not further engage in the discourse. Then she stood facing the Ganges. Since then, Chitteswari’s face has been slightly inclined towards the Ganges.\n\nDurga Charit(দূর্গা চরিত): Chitteswari Durga Mandir\n\nI am talking about the famous and religiously empowered Adi Chitteswari Durga Temple in Cossipore, which dates back to the time of the notorious dacoit ‘Chitteswar Ray’, who ruled the area around Kalikatta, Gobindapur, sutanuti in the early 16th century. But then his heart changed, and in the course of this change, he laid the stones of the temple that is now the oldest Durga Temple in Kolkata.\n\nThe Dacoit, known as “Chitte”, used to steal from wealthy zamindar and chieftain families and distribute the proceeds to the needy. kashiswar roy chowdhuri shared this information. He is the person in charge of keeping an eye on what’s going on at the Chitteswari Durga Temple. Chitte’s life of incessant robbery and his prayer to Durga went hand in hand. The Chitteswari Durga Temple was established in 1610 and is situated in Kolkata’s Cossipore area, right next to the Gun and Shell factory. The temple is painted in a vibrant yellow and red color scheme. One of the temple’s most notable features is its age. It is often said to be older than the city itself.\n\nIf Kolkata was born on August 24, 1686 (the date on which an official of the British East India Company named Job Charnock arrived on these shores), then the Chitteswari Durga Temple would be older. However, the Calcutta HC has already ruled out Charnock as Kolkata’s founder. So, the exact age of Kolkata remains a mystery.\n\nThe main deity is Durga in the center, flanked by Hanumana on one side and Shiva on the other, and she is in the form of Maa Shitala. A charming corner of the temple is home to the trio of jagannath, balaram, and subhadra, along with the eternally serene Lokenath baba. A small room for Radha and Krishna is located at the far end of the temple, near the exit. At the back of the temple is a seldom-used Shamshaan or crematorium, which used to be frequented by tantrikas and the heads of owls, dogs, monkeys, snakes, and frogs. A large neem tree, thought to have stood for centuries, is still standing near the Shamshaan.\n\nWhere\n\n‘The presence of the tiger serves as a reminder that this area was once entirely forested, and traversing these areas in the middle of the night could be life and death.’ describes kashiswar roy chowdhuri.\n\nDuring the time of Chitte, the goddess was a recluse, as Durga was not worshiped by dacoits, who were usually followers of Kali. However, the offering of human flesh to appease Durga was unprecedented, according to Chowdhuri. After Chitte’s death, the goddess was lost for a long period of time, until her idol was discovered by a sadhu named Nrisingha Brahmanachari, who constructed a small shelter for the idol. Subsequently, the zamindar of the area approached Brahmachari, offering to build a temple that would be worthy of her worship.\n\nHe is said to have passed the baton of the zamindari to his son, Nrisingha Brahmachari, who in turn passed it on to his son, Manohar Bose, in 1610 for the construction of a huge new temple. This temple is still standing today. Nrisingha Bharachari kept the temple running for many years before handing over the baton to his son, Roy Chowdhuri, who is now represented by the family of Kashiswar. Some say that Nrisingha braharachari was Gobindaram mitra, while others say that he was Manohar Bose.\n\nNow\n\nDurga Puja is a time of celebration and festivity, with the temple filled with a festive atmosphere. But at other times, it’s a time of serenity with the Durga, who is never immersed in water. It’s a place where you can sit, reflect, and pray in peace, taking a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.\n\nYou May also Like\n\nEtymology of Dum Dum Nager Bazar’s Crowded Surrounding Place Names – Part 2\n\nEncore Audio Visual of Chitteswari Durga Temple"
