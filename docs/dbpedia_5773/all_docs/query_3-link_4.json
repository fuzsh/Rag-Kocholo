        "text": "Sri Aurobindo\n\nSri Aurobindo to Dilip\n\nVolume 3. 1936 â 1937\n\nA Few Words\n\nOn 9th April and 4th May 2007, within a gap of one month, Revered Satprem, the heart and soul of âMira Aditiâ, and his spiritual companion. Respected Sujata Nahar, left their mortal bodies. Their sudden withdrawal from the physical world came as a shock to all of us who were close to them and were associated in their endeavours. We remember the assurance given by Lord Krishna in the Gita (2-23):\n\nNainang Chindanti Shastrani Nainang dahati pavakah\n\nNa chainang kledayantapo Na Shoshoyati marutah\n\nWeapons can never cleave nor fire burn\n\nNeither water drench nor wind desiccates the soul.\n\n(Translation DKR)\n\nHence they are immortal and will inspire us always. We the ashramites of Harikrishna Mandir, pay our homage to both of them.\n\nWe are glad that overcoming all the hurdles we are able to publish the Volume III of âSri Aurobindo to Dilipâ containing letters written during the period 1936-1937. Like the previous two volumes the letters are equally illuminating and inspiring. We hope the discerning readers will find these letters invaluable for their Sadhana and inspiration.\n\nOriginally we had planned to bring out the entire correspondence between Sri Aurobindo and Dadaji (as Sri Dilipkumar Roy is lovingly called by his disciples and admirers) in three volumes only. Later on seeing the enormity of the correspondence we have decided to bring them out in four volumes. We regret that we could not procure all of Dadajis original letters written to Sri Aurobindo. But Sri Aurobindoâs answers reveal the subject matters and queries raised in Dadajiâs letters to him. In the history of spirituality, there is no parallel to such letters between the Guru and the disciples. The discipleâs sincerity, frankness, truthfulness, the desire to know Truths and his high intelligence touching various aspects of life are expressed through the subject matter of these letters. Similarly Guruâs unbound love for the disciple and divine wisdom has made these letters immortal. In 1951, the Mother assured Sri Dilipkumar in a letter: âSri Aurobindo always considered you as a part of his realisationâ.\n\nAfter Sri Aurobindo had gone into seclusion, it was the general belief that Sri Aurobindo was lost in Bramhan Con- sciousness and therefore of no use to ordinary people. Through these letters the world came to know that in spite of severe sadhana to bring down the Supramental, Sri Aurobindo was not unconcerned with the day to day problems of humanity. The general idea was that Sri Aurobindo was a serious person. Dadaji was the pioneer who dared to crack jokes with him and we the common people came to know Sri Aurobindoâs beautiful human side and personality through these letters.\n\nI conclude with a prayer that Sri Aurobindoâs vision of the great descent will come true and our human nature change as foretold by the great sage.\n\nâTo raise the world to God in deathless light...\n\nTo change the earthly life to life divine.â\n\nSavitri XI.I.692\n\nOr in the words of Sri Dilipkumar\n\nAnd the glorious denouement will come because the âarchitect of immortalityâ cannot possibly fail as the omnipotent leader of human destiny has been urging us onward sleeplessly to fulfill man with the crown of Supramental consciousness on the glorious heights where.\n\nâThe Spirit shall look out through Matterâs gaze,\n\nAnd Matter shall reveal the Spiritâs face.â\n\nSavitri XI.I.709\n\nShankar Bandyopadhyay\n\nHarikrishna Mandir, Pune\n\nEditorial\n\n1936-1937 â In many ways these two years were very significant.\n\nFor Sri Aurobindo. I have not counted but I think that he wrote a maximum number of letters in 1936: Terrible night the last! (...attacked... by the demon of correspondence.} Night after night have to write letters, letters, letters, not to speak of other things. Such as preparing something for the Arya Publishing House otherwise the house will collapse, as they have been long without a fresh book. Apart from writing explanations of the poems sent up by some of the disciples. And what about his own work: The descent of the Supermind? To a query from a disciple, Sri Aurobindo answered: Tail is there â but no use without the head.\n\nFor Dilipda. He was immersed in melody, music and prosody. Not only was he experimenting in new metres and writing inspired poetry but he was also inspiring others. Moreover, in 1936, although his swings of mood continued they became a little less frequent and a bit less long in the slough of despond. He was shaping up to become the later Dadajiâ. In 1937, with Sri Aurobindoâs and Motherâs full consent he went to Calcutta. And... and there he found the voice... as though the new melody had taken a human form to propagate itself â destinyâs seal was upon it. She was Hashi (Uma Bose). Like Dilip da she too was born on a 22 January 1921, and discarded her human body on 22 January 1942 at the age of 21 years.\n\nFor the world. It is one of the well-known laws of the occult that whenever a great Truth or Light descends a corresponding power of darkness rises up to obscure the Truth or in general, to twist the Truth and make it serve the falsehood. Sri Aurobindo had seen it. His endeavour was to bring down the highest Truth which no falsehood or lie could ever touch, but which will go on doing its work. Such is the Power of Truth he contemplated. And fixed it in the earthâs atmosphere for the flowering of evolution.\n\nThe dark that rose each time was made of the same stuff â cruelty and violence â but put on different masks. This was the time of dictators, big or small, that filled the world, Europe having the greater share. With technological advance the killing spree became exponentially geometrical. It was unbridled licence to kill. Their acts are too well known for us to repeat here. A League of Nations was set up to stop aggression but the horrific devastation of WWI was still too vivid, and Western leaders preferred compromise and appeasement to confronting the agressors.\n\n1936-1937 were, I dare say, the last years of the old world order.\n\nOnly a scientist knows the value of the equipment in his laboratory. The Ashram was Sri Aurobindoâs and Motherâs laboratory. All creatures great and small were part of it. Yes, not only humans. Cats and dogs, cows and bullocks, Blackie the crow, Richardâs donkey, none were left out. That is why I have tried to give a short bio-data of the person whose name, however insignificant, has cropped up. Well, it has been difficult to procure a reliable bio-data for everybody. Yet, I have been acquainted with them! What will happen when I am gone can be easily guessed. A great big thanks goes to my sister Suprabha for obtaining what has been obtained.\n\nI shanât hold you up any longer from Sri Aurobindoâs delightful ways of imparting knowledge.\n\nSujata Nahar\n\nMarch 2007\n\n1936\n\n1\n\nJanuary 2, 1936\n\nVery remarkably smooth and strong and flowing â your metre. Enjambments are supposed to break the lyric flow and wholeness of the stanza structure, but they do not do so here, only carry over the stream into its next curve.\n\nThe letter progresses but like a crab: I had to recast the first part last night and tonight there was too much correspondence, etc. to do. However Part I cannot fail to be soon finished, for it is all there in my head or, to speak with a greater physical accuracy, formed above it. Nirvana by the way is not Nirvanic, it is only mute and withdrawn till it is overtaken by Harmony. It canât go out by itself because it is pardanashin1 and needs a male Harmony to protect it.\n\n2\n\nJanuary 3, 1936\n\nI did not answer your letter at 5 because it was only afterwards that I saw it and at that time Mother had gone out to meet the Governor, so it was impossible to read it to her and get an answer. I also read it cursorily at first and it did not seem to me that you attached much importance or seriousness to the desire of these people for Yoga. It was only after I read it again that I noticed your insistence on an answer by 5 oâclock, but it was too late. I suppose as you speak of their being in Calcutta by Monday they must have gone tonight. If by any chance they have not, they can come to the Meditation tomorrow. If either of them is serious, it is rather strange that they should come in this rushing fashion â American hustle? â to find a Guru; it is the rush that spoiled their chance, for we happened to be in a rush also. So many people are likely to be coming now and it is only if they are serious in their coming that they have any probability of getting in sideways. The American got his opportunity because he was very earnest and insistent. I hope you will get over the sadness, for this is not a sufficient cause for it.\n\nYour four sonnets2 are very fine â your sonnets always are â in form and colour and feeling. It was a great pleasure to read them.\n\n3\n\nJanuary 4, 1936\n\nThe Mother is sending the Conversations for Mohini Mohan. You will have to tell him that there are no letters, only these conversations. Recent photographs donât exist as none have been taken for some fourteen years past and more. Those we have are still older, and the present copies canât be given free as we have now to bring them from France at a heavy cost and they get exhausted soon and we have constantly to make fresh orders.\n\nYour account of Bose and his father is interesting. Let us see what he makes of himself â and the self-conscious engineer also.\n\nI feel it difficult to say anything about Raihanaâs Christ and Krishna. The attraction which she says people feel for Christ has never touched me, partly because I got disgusted with the dryness and deadness of Christianity in England and partly because the Christ of the gospels (apart from a few poignant episodes) is luminous no doubt, but somewhat shadowy and imperfectly constructed in his luminosity; there is more of the ethical put forward than of the spiritual or divine man. The Christ that has strongly lived in the Western saints and mystics is the Christ of St. Francis of Assisi, St. Teresa and others. But apart from that, is it a fact that Christ has been strongly and vividly loved by Christians? Only by a very few, it seems to me. As for Krishna, to judge him and his revealing tradition by the Christ figure and Christ tradition is not possible. The two stand in two different worlds. There is nothing in the latter of the great and boundless and sovereign spiritual knowledge and power of realisation we find in the Gita, nothing of the emotional force, passion, beauty of the Gopi symbol and all that lies behind it, nothing of the many-sided manifestation of the Krishna figure. The other has other qualities; there is no gain in putting them side by side and trying to weigh them against each other. That is the besetting sin of the Christian mind, even in those who are most liberal like Dr. Stanley Jones3; they cannot get altogether free from the sectarian narrowness and leave each manifestation to its own inner world for those to follow who have the inner drawing to one or the other. I have always refrained from these comparisons in my published writings in order to avoid this error. What I feel personally is for myself â I canât ask others to conform to my measure.\n\nThe Gopis are not ordinary people in the proper sense of the word â they are extraordinary by their extremeness of love, passionate devotion, unreserved self-giving. Whoever has that, however humble his or her position in other respects (learning, power presentation, scholarship, external sanctity, etc, etc.) can easily follow after Krishna and reach Him; that seems to me the sense of the symbol of the Gopis. There are many other significances, of course â that is only one among the many.\n\n4\n\nJanuary 13, 1936\n\nSubhash4 has written to me another letter in which he warns me darkly against âblind faithâ in Gurus. I donât think though that I have been blind about you but I do admit I believe in Guruâs lead provided the Guru appeals one. You appeal to me â that is all. So why should he want to deflate faith as against reason which so often fails to get us anywhere?\n\n[Subash Chandra Boseâs letter, dated 23.12.35 was from Vienna. He wrote,] âYour letter of 19.8.35 reached me on the 20th September. It was very clear and I understand your mind now. Of course I think in a contrary direction. You are honest in what you think and I am equally honest. The question is who is right.\n\nThe retirement of Anil Babu [Anilbaran] and yourself from active life has pained me so much that I cannot forget it. My fault is that I expected so much from both of you.\n\nIt is no use trying to argue with you. You are quite blind. Reason is but the slave of your faith. When I think how a person of your calibre can surrender his reasoning in this way, I feel like despairing of my country. Everywhere we find the same thing. You regard Sri Aurobindo as God incarnate. So many regard Mahatma Gandhi in the same light. My own mother â whose sincerity I cannot doubt â has a guru whom she regards as God incarnate.\n\nI am sorry you did not get my book. It was sent as early as February. I can send you a copy again â but I am afraid it will not reach you. You can understand the reason. What shall I do?\n\nOur ways are apart â but let us continue to be friends. Maybe, one day we shall meet â who knows?\n\nYours in love, Subhasâ\n\nDespair not â the letter is still flowing on my head (I mean the rest of it or of them) before it flows in inksome lines on paper.\n\nAs for the desperate Subhash, why the deuce does he want everybody to agree with him and follow his line of conduct or belief? That is the never realised dream of the politician; we, incarnate Gods, Gurus, spiritual men, are more modest in our hopes and are satisfied with a handful or, if you like, an Ashramful of disciples, and even we donât ask for that, they come, they come. So are we not nearer to reason and wisdom than the political leaders? Unless of course we make the mistake of founding a universal religion, but that is not our case. Moreover, Subhash upbraids you for losing your reason in blind faith, but what is his view of things except a reasoned faith; you believe according to your faith, which is quite natural, he believes according to his opinion, which is natural also, but no better, so far as the likelihood of getting at the true truth of things is in question. His opinion is according to his reason? So is the opinion of his political opponents according to their reason, yet they affirm the very opposite idea to his. How is reason going to show which is right? The opposite parties can argue till they are blue in the face, they wonât be anywhere nearer a decision. In the end he prevails who has the greater force or whom the trend of things. favours. But who can look at the world and say that the trend of things is always (or ever) according to right reason â whatever this thing called right reason may be? As a matter of fact there is no universal infallible reason which can decide and be the umpire between conflicting opinions, there is only my reason, your reason, Xâs reason, Yâs reason, multiplied up to the discordant innumerable. Each reasons according to his view of things, his opinion, that is, his mental constitution and mental preference. So what is the use of running down faith which after all gives something to hold on to amidst the contradictions of an enigmatic universe? If one can get at a knowledge that knows, it is another matter; but so long as we have only an ignorance that argues, well, there is a place still left for faith â even, faith may be a glint from the knowledge that knows, however far off, and meanwhile there is not the slightest doubt that it helps to get things done. Thereâs a bit of reasoning for you! Just like all other reasoning too, convincing to the convinced, but not to the unconvincible, i.e., who donât agree with the ground upon which the reasoning dances. Logic, after all, is only a measured dance of the mind, nothing else.\n\n5\n\nJanuary 15, 1936\n\nIt is a very beautiful song8 [âFaithfulâ] and an admirable translation.\n\nAs to the point that puzzles you, it only arises from a confusion between the feeling of the devotee and the observation of the observer. Of course, the devotee loves Krishna because Krishna is lovable and not for any other reason â that is his feeling and his true feeling. He has no time to bother his head about what in himself made him able to love, the fact that he does love is sufficient for him and he does not need to analyse his emotions. The Grace of Krishna consists for him in Krishnaâs very lovableness, in his showing of himself to the devotee, in his call, the cry of his flute. That is enough for the heart or, if there is anything more, it is the yearning that others or all may hear the flute, see the face, feel all the beauty and rapture of this love.\n\nIt is not the heart of the devotee but the mind of the observer that questions how it is that the Gopis were called and responded at once and others â the Brahmin women, for instance â were not called or did not respond at once. Once the mind puts the question, there are two possible answers, the mere will of Krishna without any reason, what the mind would call his absolute divine choice or his arbitrary divine caprice or else the readiness of the heart that is called and that amounts to adhikÄrÄ«-bheda [variation in the readiness]. A third reply would be â circumstances, as for instance, the parking off the spiritual ground into closed preserves. But how can circumstances prevent the Grace from acting? In spite of the parking off, it works â Christians, Mahomedans do answer to the Grace of Krishna. Tigers, ghouls must love if they see him, hear his flute? Yes, but why do some hear it and see him, others not? We are thrown back on the two alternatives, Krishnaâs Grace calls whom it wills to call without any determining reason for the choice or rejection, his mercy or his withholding or at least delaying of his mercy, or else he calls the hearts that are ready to vibrate and leap up at his call â and even there he waits till the moment has come. To say that it does not depend on outward merit or appearance of fitness is no doubt true; the something that was ready to wake in spite, it may be, of many hard layers in which it was enclosed, may be something visible to Krishna and not to us. It was there perhaps long before the flute began to play, but he was busy melting the hard layers so that the heart in its leap might not be pressed back by them when the awakening notes came. The Gopis heard and rushed out into the forest â the others did not or did they think it was only some rustic music or some rude cowherd lover fluting to his sweetheart, not a call that learned and cultured or virtuous ears could recognise as the call of the Divine? There is something to be said for the adhikÄrÄ«-bheda. But, of course, it must be understood in a large sense â some may have the adhikÄra [fitness] for recognising Krishnaâs flute, some for the call of Christ, some for the dance of Shiva â to each his own way and his natureâs answer to the Divine Call. adhikÄra cannot be stated in rigid mental terms, it is something spiritual and subtle, something mystic and secret between the called and the Caller.\n\nAs for the swelled head, the theory of Grace may no doubt contribute to it, though I should imagine that the said head never felt the Grace but only the magnanimity of its own ego. The swelling may come equally in the way of personal effort as by the craving for Grace. It is fundamentally not due to either, but to a natural predisposition to this kind of oedema.\n\n6\n\nJanuary 16, 1936\n\nYour letter on Grace. I will have to ponder it carefully. It seems to me now-a-days that it is best to silence this fellow mind somehow. It can understand practically nothing yet wants to prove everything with its blunt-spade. How to do it though? Last night I tried hard to meditate from 7.30 p.m. to silence this mind, etc. But got so fed up with the attempt that dropped off to sleep and too much sleep was the result after which I always feel seedy â as I do today. How to convert this activism in me to silence? That is the problem truly! Can you give some real advice, and better still some force? After such attempts I feel always listless verging on depression but I have resolved not to allow my depression to lead me to despair but strike it as I see it is all but useless to try to get out of the grip of this depressing fellow. My cold too has rein-forced it. However I wonât complain. I have prayed a lot today â some comfort to dwell on that â though Krishnaprem advocates the Upanishadic attitude âAwake! Ariseâ and not trust too much to Divine Grace. Raihana on the contrary believes in Grace. Hike to do that but find nothing which encourages me to such a faith, nor find any strength to entrust myself to the Upanishadic path of self-help. Anyhow try to send me a little force. What more can you do â since our mentality and ÄdhÄrs are so obstinately dark and unluminous not to be able to be up so much spiritually. However â cheeri â oh Guru â a la Cambridge. Could not do much meditation for the past two days with Mother thanks to this awful nuisance of cough â that is another irksome obstacle on top of my enough obstacles and to spare.\n\nP.S. I sometimes marvel how this fellow Krishnaprem has got so much strength with an indifferent guru, while we have so little of it with a really wonderful guru!\n\nTo envy whom? A strong adept with an indifferent guru or a weak aspirant with a wonderful guru? Ah, there is the rub.\n\nLet us not exaggerate anything. It is not so much getting rid of mental activity as converting it into the right thing. Krishnaprem has mental activity, but it is a mind that has gone inside and sees things from there, an intuitive mind; I have mental activity (in the midst of silence) whenever necessary, but it is a mind that [has] gone up and sees things from above, an overmind action. What has to be surpassed and changed is the intellectual reason which sees things from outside only, by analysis and inference â when it doesnât do it rather by taking a hasty look and saying âso it isâ or âso it is notâ. But you canât get the inner or upper mind unless this old mental activity becomes a little quiet. A quiet mind does not involve itself in its thoughts or get run away with them by them; it stands back, detaches itself, lets them pass without identifying itself, without making them its own. It becomes the witness mind watching the thoughts when necessary, but able to turn away from them and receive from within and from above. Silence is good, but absolute silence is not indispensable, at least at this stage. I do not know that to wrestle with the mind to make it quiet is of much use; usually the mind gets the better of that game. It is this standing back, detaching oneself, getting the power to listen to something else other than the thoughts of the external mind that is the easier way. At the same time one can look up, as it were, imaging to oneself the Force as there just above and calling it down or quietly expecting its help. That is how most people do it, till the mind falls gradually quiet or silent of itself, or else silence begins to descend from above. But it is important not to allow the depression or despair to come in because there is no immediate success; that can only make things difficult and stop any progress that is preparing.\n\nThe cough must be got rid of.\n\nKrishnapremâs objection to Grace would be valid if the religionists mattered, but in spiritual things they donât. Their action naturally is to make a formula and dry shell of everything, not Grace alone. Even âAwake, Ariseâ leads to the swelled head or the formula â canât be avoided when Mr. Everyman deals with things divine. I had the same violent objection to Gurugiri [profession of a guru], but you see I was obliged by the irony of things or rather by the inexorable truth to become a Guru and preach the Guruvada [the school of thought in which the help of the Guru is indispensable for spiritual life]. Such is Fate.\n\nShall send Force. But donât wrestle too much; go slowly and let the Force work.\n\n7\n\nJanuary 20, 1936\n\nI note the offer for the houses â a chance, but I suppose the tussle will be over the price. I hope that the idea of the just value will be pitched higher when Dhir makes the critical valuation, the idea in the mind of the seller counts for much in determining that in the mind of the buyer and the price after all is what the seller is prepared to give for the object â market or no market. However, we will see.\n\nI donât think you understood very well what Mother was trying to tell you. First of all she did not say that prayers or meditation either were no good â how could she when both count for so much in Yoga. What she said was that the prayer must well up from the heart on a crest of emotion or aspiration, the japa or meditation come in a live push carrying the joy or the light of the thing in it. If done mechanically as a thing that ought to be done (stern grim duty!), it must tend towards want of interest and dryness, and so be ineffective. It was what I meant when I said I thought you were doing Japa too much as a means for bringing about a result â I meant too much as a device, a process laid down for getting the thing done. That again was why I wanted the psychological conditions in you to develop, the psychic, the mental â for when the psychic is forward, there is no lack of life and joy in the prayer, the aspiration, the seeking, no difficulty in having the constant stream of bhakti and when the mind is quiet and inturned and upturned there is no difficulty or want of interest in meditation. Meditation, by the way, is a process leading towards knowledge and through knowledge, it is a thing of the head and not of the heart; so if you want dhyÄna, you canât have an aversion to knowledge. Concentration in the heart is not meditation, it is a call on the Divine, on the Beloved. This yoga too is not a Yoga of knowledge alone â knowledge is one of its means, but its base being self-offering, surrender, bhakti, it is based in the heart and nothing can be eventually done without this base. There are plenty of people here who do or have done Japa and base themselves on bhakti, very few comparatively who have done the âheadâ meditation; love and bhakti and works are usually the base â how many can proceed by knowledge? Only the few.\n\nWhat the Mother spoke of was not self-analysis nor dissection. Analyses and dissection are mental things which can deal with the inanimate or make the live dead; they are not spiritual methods. What the Mother spoke of was not analysis, but a seeing of oneself and of all the living movements of the being and the nature, a vivid observation of the personalities and forces that move on the stage of our being, their motives, their impulses, their potentialities â an observation quite as interesting as the seeing and understanding of a drama or a novel, a living vision and perception of how things are done in us which brings also a living mastery over this inner universe. Such things become dry only when one deals with them with the analytic and ratiocinative mind, not when one deals with them thus seeingly and intuitively as a movement of life. If you had that observation (from the inner spiritual, not the outer intellectual and ethical viewpoint), then it would be comparatively easy for you to get out of your difficulties; for instance, you would see at once where this irrational impulse to flee away came from and it would not have any hold upon you. Of course, all that can only be done to the best effect when you stand back from the play of your nature and become the Witness-Control or the Spectator-Actor-Manager. But that is what happens when you take this kind of self-seeing posture.\n\nHowever, since you fear it will be dry or painful (an idea of the non-understanding intellect like your old confusion of the supramental as if it were the same thing as the cold aloofness of the illusionist Brahman instead of a sublimation of light, dynamism â joy, love and Ananda), we will say no more of it. An easier method of the heart? You believe in traditional ideas of Yoga â well, according to traditional ideas also, the one easiest method is that of bhakti, reliance, self-giving, bhakti, nirbhar, samarpaá¹.\n\nWhat still stands in your way â for it was and is growing towards that in you, is an old confusion in mind and vital. The heart says âI want bhaktiâ, the mind says âNo, no, let us have reasonâ, the vital says, âNonsense, I canât surrenderâ. What you need is to quiet down that confusion created by the mindâs past samskaras and either fix on the one thing or harmonise. Bhakti is the basic force, knowledge, strength and joy in the Divine is the result â that is the harmony proposed in this Yoga. But in either way, if either is done, then Peace becomes easily possible.\n\nP.S. Jayantilalâs design is excellent. Mother will tell Lalita9 about the table harmonium.\n\n8\n\nJanuary 21, 1936\n\nVairagya is certainly one way of progressing towards the goal â the traditional way and a drastic if painful one. To lose the desire for human vital enjoyments, to lose the passion for literary or other success, praise, fame, to lose even the insistence on spiritual success, the inner bhoga [enjoyment] of yoga, have always been recognised as steps towards the goal â provided one keeps the one insistence on the Divine. I prefer myself the calmer way of equality, the way pointed out by Krishna, than the more painful one of Vairagya. But if the compulsion in oneâs nature â or the compulsion of oneâs inner being forcing its way by that means through the difficulties of the nature is on that line, it must be recognised as a valid line. What is the thing that has to be got rid of in that case is the note of despair in the vital which responds to the cry you speak of â that it will never gain the Divine because it has not yet got the Divine or that there has been no progress. There has certainly been a progress, the greater push of the psychic, this very detachment itself from other things always growing somewhere in you. The thing is to hold on, not to cut the cord which is pulling you up because it hurts the hands. To keep the one insistence if all the others fall away from you.\n\nIt is evident that something in you, perhaps continuing the unfinished curve of a past life, is pushing you on this path of vairagya and the more stormy way of bhakti â in spite of our preference for a less painful one and yours also â something that is determined to be drastic with the outer nature so as to make itself free to fulfil its secret aspiration. But do not listen to these suggestions of the voice that says, âYou shall not succeed and it is no use tryingâ. That is a thing that need never be said in the Way of the Spirit, however difficult it may seem at the moment to be. Keep through all the aspiration which you express so beautifully in your poems; for it is certainly there and comes out from the depths, and if it is the cause of suffering â as great aspirations usually are in a world and nature where there is so much to oppose them â it is also the promise and surety of emergence and victory in the future.\n\n9\n\nJanuary 22, 1936\n\nYou stick to your intellectual ethical version of the inner self-vision? Dry? policeman? criminal? Great Lord! If it were that, it would cease to be self-vision at all â for in the true self-vision there is no policemanship and no criminaldom at all. All that belongs to the intellectual-ethical virtue and sin dodge which is only a mental construction of practical value for the outward life but not a truth of real inner values. In the true self-vision we see only harmonies and disharmonies and set the wrong notes right and replace them by the true notes. But I say that for the sake of truth, not to persuade you to start the self-vision effort; for if you did with these ideas of it, you would inevitably start it on the policeman basis and get into trouble. Besides, evidently, you prefer in the yoga to be the piano and not the pianist, which is all right but involves total self-giving and the intervention of the supreme musician and harmonist. May it be so.\n\nI am glad to know that your vital has been frightened into acquiescence in self-giving â even if only by the imaginary horror of being obliged to become the policeman of your self. But to explain why these contradictions existed in you one has to have recourse to this very business of harmonies and disharmonies and the inner knowledge. You were in fact a piano played on by several pianists at a time each with his own different musical piece to play! In plain words and without images every man is full of these contradictions because he is one person, no doubt, but made up of different personalities â the perception of multiple personality is becoming well known to psychologists now â who very commonly disagree with each other. So long as one does not aim at unity in a single dominant intention, like that of seeking and self-dedication to the Divine, they get on somehow together, alternating or quarrelling or muddling through or else one taking the lead and compelling the others to take a minor part â but once you try to unite them in one aim, then the trouble becomes evident. One element wanted the Divine from the first, another wanted music, liberation, poetry, a third wanted life at its best, a fourth wanted life â well, not at its best. Finally there was another element which wanted life not at all, but was rather disgusted with it and wanted either a better (diviner) life or something better than life. It was this element evidently that created the vairagya and in the struggle between that and the life-partisans a black element stole in (not one of the personalities, but a formation, a dark intrusion from outside), which wanted to turn the whole thing into a drama or tragedy of despair â despair of life but despair of the Divine also. That has to be rejected, the rest changed and harmonised. That is the only true explanation of the whole difficulty in your nature.\n\n10\n\nJanuary 24, 1936\n\nI had only a one-sided account which I know to be unreliable. What you say confirms what I had always thought must be the truth of the matter.\n\n11\n\nJanuary 24, 1936\n\nSome comments here, anything for a sport, what?\n\nNothing much to comment. What he [Krishnaprem] says â the central thing â is very correct, as always; the position of all who have any notion of spirituality, though the religionists like Jones and the Christ-lover on board ship seem to find it difficult to get to it. But though Christ and Krishna are the same, they are the same in difference, that is indeed the utility of so many manifestations instead of there being only one as these missionaries would have it. But is it really because the historical Christ has been made too much the foundation-stone of the faith that Christianity is failing? It may be something inadequate in the religion itself â perhaps in religion itself; for all religions are a little off-colour now. The need of a larger opening of the soul into the Light is being felt, an opening through which the expanding human mind and heart can follow. I have not read Stanley Jones, but I should not be surprised to find there is some justification for the feeling of sickness. I donât know why so many Christian writers have a way of writing and preaching which gives a sense of unpleasant unctuousness, a very small dish of religious emotion swimming in a too fat oil of holiness â as if the Pharisees17 and Sadducees18 had not only crucified Christ but laid the grip of their ecclesiasticism and Pharisaism on the religion also. Excuse the culinary simile â a little sport, as you say â and my growl is quite private.\n\n12\n\nJanuary 29, 1936\n\nAgain a pious and peaceful day â though worked hard at musical composition â new strains are coming â which had to be recorded â thanks to Motherâs flowers of blessing day before yesterday for musical composition. Truly fine and original stuff is coming! Strange! But strangest â that this peace should continue. A sort of incipient stillness near the heart which had given me so much trouble. Have been thinking of Mother gratefully all day practically.\n\nThis incipient stillness near the heart is a sign of great promise. Very glad to hear of it and of the continued peace.\n\n13\n\nJanuary 30, 1936\n\nMountain of proof, so music was interrupted â but not piousness. Herewith my savant friend Professorâs postcard. Please write about the sale of my record as Chandicharan seems suspiciously like cheating us as he simply wrote, âÄpnÄder record moter opar bhÄloi bikray hatchhe jÄnbenâ [Please note that your records are selling quite well.] Rather lukewarm that, yet many others are saying the records are selling like incandescent cakes. However âwaitons,â what?\n\nI am ready for any amount of suspicion with regard to that admirable businessman Chandicharan. But till he shows his hand, waitons.\n\nBut please send me the two photos (1) yours (2) Motherâs for Professor. He sent Rs.3, remember?\n\nYes; but you did not notice my little note about the rupees â there were only two in the envelope when I opened it. Also I asked you what was to be done about the photos, but I understand now that they have to be sent to you.\n\nA poem of Nishikanta: fine stuff, isnât it?\n\nYes, it is very fine.\n\nDay before yesterday I was calmly telling him how Russell in his latest book In Praise of Idleness has predicted with almost irrefutable logic the coming collapse of the war-mad Europe seized with lunacy born of horror on the one hand and greed on the other. But just listen a bit: âWe are all more aware of our fellow-citizens than we used to be, more anxious, if we are virtuous, to do them good (like Raihanaâs Dr. Jones, what?) and in any case to make them do us good. (As in Abyssinia, what?) We do not like to think of anyone lazily enjoying life, however refined may be the quality of his enjoyment. We feel that everybody ought to be doing something to help in the great cause â whatever it maybe â the more so as so many bad men are working against it and ought to be stopped. We have not leisure of mind, therefore, to acquire any knowledge except such as will help us in the fight for whatever it may happen to be that we think important.â (Essay on âUseless Knowledgeâ)\n\nWhat will the rational Subhash, who holds all irrational faith suspect say of this rational cynicism directed against his darling activism which is so often, alas, but a respectable cloak of arrivisme and oftener an outlet for that restlessness, which the West is now getting tired of, many actually preaching the gospel of idleness which is a concomitant of culture and often of the best and lovable type?\n\nPoor Subhash! But he is a politician and the rationality of politicians has perforce to move within limits; if they were to allow themselves to be as clear-minded as that, their occupation would be gone. It is not everybody who can be as cynical as a Birkenhead19 or as philosophic as a C. R. Das22 and go on with political reason or political humbug in spite of knowing what it all comes to â from arrivisme in the one and from patriotism in the other case.\n\nAlso listen, enjoy a little, what? Russell further writes:\n\nâWhen the indemnities were imposed, the Allies regarded themselves as consumers: they considered that it would be pleasant to have the Germans work for them as temporary slaves, and to be able themselves to consume, without labour, what the Germans had produced. Then, after the treaty of Versailles had been concluded, they suddenly remembered that they were also producers, and that the influx of German goods which they had been demanding would ruin their industries! They were so puzzled that they started scratching their heads, but that did no good, even when they all did it together and called it an International Conference. The plain fact is that the governing classes of the world are too ignorant and stupid to be able to think through such a problem, and too conceited to ask advice of those who might help them.â Well, what would Subhash as a ruling patriot say to this! How support his reason? All these meeting-makers are reasonable people, arenât they?\n\nYes, but human reason is a very convenient and accommodating instrument and works only in the circle set for it by interest, partiality and prejudice. The politicians reason wrongly or insincerely and have power to enforce the results of their reasoning so as to make a mess of the worldâs affairs â the intellectuals reason and see what their minds show them, which is far from being always the truth, for it is generally decided by intellectual preference and the mindâs inborn education-inculcated angle of vision â but even when they see it, they have no power to enforce it. So between blind power and seeing impotence the world moves, achieving destiny through a mental muddle.\n\nLastly, O Guru, Russell shows the devastating logic that Europe is heading straight for shipwreck, thanks to her âlunacyâ born of greed and terror: âWhen a nation, instead of an individual is seized with lunacy, it is thought to be displaying remarkable industrial wisdom.â Quâen dites-vous?\n\nSeized with lunacy? But that implies that nation is ordinarily led by reason? Is it so? Or even by common sense? Masses of men act upon their vital push, not according to reason â individuals too mostly, though they frequently call in their reason as a lawyer to plead the vitalâs case.\n\nA little literature: Prof. Mohini Mohan did demur a little at first to my too wide vocabulary, whereto I demurred that now so many who used to say formerly that I used difficult words have discovered suddenly that it is Åabdasampad. I am pleased now that he recognises the artistry I aim at in choosing from a wide range of words which he calls Åabder jÄdu (the magic of words). Prithwisingh too now-a-days admits this though formerly he too used to demur. I feel often a little newness in expression vocabulary, etc. is at first a little baffling and unwelcome to many hommes de bonne volontÃ©. For I am not conscious of pedantry, I wrote to Professor, only the words which to them seem a little unusual come to me very easily (believe me) and I like Åabdasampad, a wide vocabulary and new rhythms and metres even at some (temporarily I feel) risks. A little self-defence rather complacent maybe, but not too much as this Professor knew me very little before and is already talking in a different strain, what?\n\nAnything new has always to fight its way to recognition â the first impulse of the human minds is to reject it.\n\n14\n\nJanuary 31, 1936\n\nIt appears the Mother had arranged for the photographs after getting the derelict rupee and thought they must have reached you, so she said no more about it; hence my reiteration. Anyhow I suppose you have the photos now. As for the rupee note, it must have dematerialised and flown away somewhere.\n\nI dare say Thomson may be right about the inability of the great B. P. [British Public] to appreciate a detail picture of Bengali life. It is too unfamiliar â Russia is different, it is at least semi-occidental, but everything here would be strange and new. That ought to be in its favour but possibly on the Continent, it would be. But the B.P. would accept the new, I think, only if it was striking, romantic or dramatic. This story is not that; it is too quiet, fine and subtle in its touches. However, let us hope for a miracle and waitons.\n\nRe. handwriting, in spite of your outraging my pride of first without second in that matter by giving Mahendranath28 a higher place, I admit you have some reason for this verdict. Even in English I am often at sea for long minutes before I arrive at the full and exact text of his letters. But may I mutter that you also are at least in the running. I have racked my head to discover what the human character is full of which even he himself does not know, I am still in dark ignorance on this matter. It is not only that your ra and cha and even ka and dha are often almost as identical as Siamese twins, but when you go out of your way to introduce some Telugu letters into the Bengali language, you drive at least one poor reader to a despair of unsatisfied curiosity. However I deciphered all but that one mysterious thing â at least I believe so.\n\nYou seem to be unlucky in your outrage whether musical or monstrous. Better luck next time.\n\nP.S. Not much time today, so keeping K. P. till tomorrow.\n\n15\n\n1936 (?)\n\nYesterday at Pavitraâs I met Mother. [She asked] to sit on a chair â but I sat at her feet and then came back in a delight. Hence this poem [came] forth in a song â then and there in a few minutes. It is in my new metre â with free enjambments.\n\nExceedingly beautiful â the metre also is admirable, adapted to express this kind of flow of feeling...\n\n16\n\n1936\n\nNishikantaâs poem âRaj-Hansaâ Ã la Jaydeva in laghu guru metre is truly a marvellous success: magnificiently easy and beautiful in rhythm as well as fine poetry. I agree with you that he has justified the laghu guru metre altogether, sustaining a perfect naturalness and fluency throughout such a long poem. His. skill as a rhythmist is truly remarkable.\n\n17\n\n1936\n\nX. writes, âCanât you get Sri Aurobindo to comment on it?â It is some sort of spiritual surrealism and I donât know if I have succeeded! Do let me have even a monosyllabic comment if you have no time for more.\n\nVeda\n\n1. Milk within mighty breasts for a mute child\n\nBorn of the inmost Womb is the light beyond!\n\nFrom the teatâs mouth to a clinging mouth pass all\n\nThe glowing Godheads â sages that burn wide\n\nShrink to a blinded bliss in giant arms\n\nTo suck the Whiteness hung in the highest blue!\n\nAwful!\n\n2 Soaring towards the White that has no end â\n\nO Swan, plunging\n\ninto the Vast, the Pure â\n\nThyself the vastness and the Purity â\n\nLook not beyond for ever, turn back and shine,\n\nA Lord of rays that cleave to the core of things,\n\nA sun whose fingers touch truth everywhere!\n\n(referring to the last line:) This line is good. The others fail to arrive.\n\n3. Lost lover of the glimmering herds of the Sun,\n\nThe brute is stretching his slow neck of night.\n\nEyes of gold frame covered with lids that are rock\n\nHunger for a lightning stroke: O Thunderer Hand,\n\nSee the pale arms of the abyssâs prayer â\n\nTwo horns of a moon upon a black bullâs head!\n\nNeck stretching! The stanza might have succeeded in being very good if it had forestalled that success by succeeding in being very bad.\n\n(Referring to the underlined words:) I see no justifying reason for this awkward internal rhyme.\n\nA variant of the opening two lines of 3 is:\n\nThe belly of the brute is a caverned Day,\n\nHorror!\n\nMate of the Immense whose navel is the Sun.\n\nIs this more in tune with the spiritual surrealism of the poem?\n\nDilip, I have sent you two dissyllables instead of one mono-syllable and some sentences besides. My stiff silence should have been eloquent enough. What the deuce is this neck-stretching Muse that has rapped him by the neck, anyway?\n\nIf you insist on monosyllables here are two that express my attitude Ã lâAmÃ©ricaine, âGreat snakes!â\n\n18\n\n1936\n\nVery glad to hear of the flood of aspiration. No harm in being interested or engrossed â it is a general spirit of offering that has to grow up.\n\nThe old Adam is always an obstinate chap, one can only press him out slowly, though now and then a big push nearer towards the door can be made. The thing is to get him nearer and nearer to the exit.\n\nBut what has the condition of the world to do with Grace? Grace is an individual affair. What the seers say is not that the world is a monument of divine Mercy or Grace, but that the Grace is waiting behind for one who turns from its ignorance or fully to the Divine.\n\nanityam asukhaá¹ lokam imam prÄpya bhajasva mÄm [This world is full of misery and ephemeral: so turn to worship me. Gita, 9.33]\n\nOf course we hope to initiate a better world here, but that is another matter. The individuals or some individuals first â afterwards the world may ask for its chance.\n\n19\n\n1936\n\nThe increase of âpeace and purityâ I have been feeling of late â I had asked if that was any index to our growing ability to serve the ÄdarÅa [ideal] of our august guru.\n\nCertainly it is a very good index â peace and purity are the bases of the height and the opportunity for the luminosity of my ÄdarÅa and their increase cannot but help to make it more garimÄmoy [glorious].\n\n20\n\nJanuary 1936\n\nMother does not wish to sell the houses for so small a sum. I am writing to Prithwisingh that she wants a lakh as the minimum; it would be better to wait than to sell for so little.\n\nI know nothing of Saurinâs coming back, except for Eshaâs writing in her letter to Jyoti that she will send [something?] she has to send with Saurin. He has not written for permission, nor has he received any. He wrote that his sadhana is going on very well there, so I donât know why he wants to come. When he writes for permission, the answer is not likely to be in the affirmative.\n\nI am sorry the old reaction to the japa has recurred. Perhaps the mind is doing it too much as a means for a result. The japa is usually successful only on one of two conditions â if it is repeated with a sense of its significance, a dwelling of something in the mind on the nature, power, beauty, attraction of the Godhead it signifies and is to bring into the consciousness, that is the mental way â or if it comes up from the heart or rings in it with a certain sense of feeling of bhakti making it alive, that is the emotional way. Either the mind or the vital has to give it support or sustenance. But if it makes the mind dry and the vital restless, it must be missing that support and sustenance. There is of course a third way, the reliance on the power of the mantra or name in itself, but then one has to go on till that power has sufficiently impressed its vibrations on the inner being to make it at a given moment suddenly open to the Presence or the Touch. But if there is a struggling or insistence for the result, then this effect which needs a quiet receptivity in the mind is impeded. That is why I insisted so much on mental quietude and on not too much straining or effort â to give time to allow the psychic and the mind to develop the necessary condition of receptivity â a receptivity as natural as when one receives an inspiration for poetry and music. It is also why I do not want you to discontinue your poetry â it helps and does not hinder the preparation because it is a means of developing the right position of receptivity and bringing out the bhakti which is there in the inner being. To spend all the energy in japa or meditation is a strain which even those who are accustomed to successful meditation find it difficult to do â unless in periods when there is an uninterrupted flow of experiences from above.\n\n21\n\nFebruary 8, 1936\n\nI am doubtful what to say about your proposal. Ramchandra has secured a remarkable series of successes, but he has not an accommodating character and there might be friction. His cures also depend upon a military obedience and docility in the patient which is not common in the Ashram; it is not that he has not been successful in most cases but in some he has failed and in several cases the treatment has been cut short half-way by a quarrel. Now according to his own statement to begin his treatment and to drop it half-way is worse than not to have the treatment at all. Moreover, it is hernia and I am not aware whether he has ever successfully tackled such a case. There are several causes for hesitation in saying Yes.\n\nThe case of cancer (Davidâs mother) is still in its first stages. Ramchandra himself wrote to me that he would have been more confident if they had called him in five months earlier and he told David that in case of cure it could be said only after three monthsâ treatment. I have not heard that the cancer is cured; but there has been a remarkable improvement in a very short time of the worst attendant symptoms and in the general health. R-s own opinion was some time ago that the [?] above the navel (which is the cause) had gone or were going but he was afraid of an evolution downward towards her anus rete of which they were signs; these signs have also now diminished. That is where matters stand and it does not amount yet to a cure.\n\nFor the goitre, that appertains or rather appertained to Raju (the garagistâs) mother, but it was only one item of a general breakdown of the organism which made R. himself unwilling to take the case. It was only a sceptical sarcasm of Dr. Andre29 about his âhigh powerâ homeopathic medicines (high power means an almost minus quantity of medicine in a flood of dilution) that stung him to the quick and made him blurt out that he engaged to cure her in a month. He prayed to us for an extra amount of force so that his bluff might not land him in an ignominious defeat, and strangely enough his boast seems to have been fulfilled to the letter. This disorganised old creature has been put together, can eat heartily, digest, function and walk without the tendency to sudden collapse with which she was troubled, is free of [? ] and headache; her senile dementia has gone and she is chatting coherently and paying visits. R., the family and herself are all agreed that she is cured in every respect and she is off the sicklist. The goitre was in a few days reduced so that it was only somewhat visible in a particular position (this was the family report as I saw it); afterwards it disappeared from the report column; I took it that it was cured and R. spoke of it as cured; I donât know if it was an absolute disappearance.\n\nOn the face of it Ramachandra is remarkable. As far as I can see he has succeeded in the most extraordinary way in cases outside, Godard, Mme Montbrunâs mother, Rajuâs mother, Davidâs mother, where his dominating mental personality could dominate, suggest, instil faith, convey the force; in the Ashram he has met more mental, and vital resistance and been therefore less startlingly successful, though he has produced a rapid effect in several cases. I have seen myself with these outside patients that whenever he indicated the symptoms he wanted cured and I put the force, the success was precise and immediate and the general action also rapid and decisive. In the Ashram I have been able to get equal or sometimes superior results (e.g. instantaneous cure without medicines) only in cases where the faith and reliance were complete. That is how things stand. I am still watching â seeing for instance how far he succeeds in cases like Rajangamâs30. I do not know yet whether he would be able to cure in the same way as in those cases a purely physical lesion like hernia.\n\n22\n\nFebruary 9, 1936\n\nIt is a pity you are [troubled] with houses just before the 21st. However, the Mother agrees to lift the burden off your shoulders. But a legal assignment is not advisable, because that would mean having to pay heavy taxes twice, first at the time of assignment and again at the time of sale. What you can do is to make a verbal statement to Prithwisingh before the Mother stating that you have no more to do with the houses and all affairs about them must go to the Mother and be decided by her and also give him a legal power of attorney for transacting all business connected with the property. Duraiswami will be here on the 21st and stay for two or three days, so he can draw up the power. To execute it will then be your last house property trouble. Mother does not propose to use any demolishing thunder but simply to get rid of these dumb and motionless but troublesome elephants for as good a price as we can get and set aside the sum for the house to be built here. All this can be done after the 21st; meanwhile being assured of relief you can breathe freely and blow from your mind house, repairs, tenants and the whole show in one liberating puff of the Brahman.\n\n23\n\nFebruary 9, 1936\n\nKrishnapremâs letter to Dilip dated 9 February 1936:\n\nâI fully agree with the doctrine of adhikar but that must not be confused with any former scheme of current in society or invented by the mind. It is much more subtle than that. Let sister Raihana try to impart her love for Krishna to others. In some cases she will succeed in others not and this will be only partially due to her own limitations, because even the greatest, Krishna, Buddha, Christ, could only succeed in some cases and in others could produce no effect. This is adhikar-bheda whether you like the word or not, but it has nothing to do with castes, races or creeds. At any given time some will listen to the flute and some will not â because they are not ready. But why argue? She has found Krishna. He will teach her in her heart whatever she should know.\n\nAs for your other friend Subhash, what is all this bother about? Certainly I donât advocate blind faith. True faith is not blind though the interpreting mind may weave a tissue of partial untruths about the vision just as the same mind may weave a tissue of falsehood around the bare datum of a sense perception, e.g., mistaking a post for a man. St. Paul called faith âthe evidence of things unseenâ. Evidence, not mere mental belief. As a man gradually purifies his nature so his faith will shine more clearly, free from the misunderstandings of the mind. A sectarian believes in all sorts of silly things. It is not his faith that is at fault (I am talking of real faith, mind you) but his poorly developed mind which misinterprets the data given by his faith. We must purify our minds till they can grasp the object of our faith without covering it up with all sorts of silly superstitions. But if we abandon faith we shall be lost, for faith is just the evidence for a higher level of knowledge. It is a thread let down from that higher level and if we turn our back on it we shall just wander contentedly about on the level at which we are. That is what most so-called rationalists do. We must use faith as they do a thread in saving men from shipwreck: they fire a rocket across carrying a light thread. That having been grasped it is used to pull over a stout cord, that â a thin rope and that â a stout hawser which will carry men across.\n\nAs for Gurus as âincarnate Godsâ as Subhash ridicules it, well, why not? All men are incarnate Gods for one thing â only they know it not; for another, if I can see the God in some man either because he has seen It in himself or because through him a Light has shone for me, why should any one get annoyed? Presumably because he has not seen God anywhere himself, is it not?\n\nâMaâ sends her love. She read the Hindi poem you sent Raihana and your Bengali translation, and liked them both very much. She says that being a Bengali she liked the Bengali version best.\n\nLove always from yours affectionatelyâ\n\nKrishnaprem\n\nOf course, Krishnapremâs view about the canalisation of Niagara is my standpoint also. But for the human mind it is difficult to get across the border between mind and spirit without making a forceful rush or push along one line only and that must be some line of pure experience in which, especially if it is the bhakti way, one gets easily swallowed up in the rapids (did not Chaitanya at last disappear in the waters?) and goes no farther. The first thing is to break into the spiritual consciousness, any part of it, anyhow and anywhere, afterwards one can explore the country to which exploration there can hardly be a limit; one is always going higher and higher, getting wider and wider; but there is a certain intense ecstasy about the first complete plunge which is extraordinarily seizing. It is not only the bhaktaâs rapture, but the jnaniâs plunge into Brahma-Nirvana or Brahmananda or release into the still eternity of the Self that is of that seizing and absorbing character â it does not look at first as if one could or would care or need to get beyond into anything else. One cannot find fault with the Sannyasi lost in his laya [annulation of the individual soul in the Infinite] or the Bhakta lost in his ecstasy; they remain there probably because they are constituted for that and it is the limit of their leap. But, all the same, it has always appeared to me that it is a stage and not the end; I subscribe fully to the canalisation of the Niagara.\n\nAdhikara is, of course, a matter of the psychology and the soul and the nature, it has nothing to do with any outer or artificial standards.\n\nThen as to the Avatar and the symbols. There is, it seems to me, a cardinal error in the modern insistence on the biographical and historical, that is to say, the external factuality of the Avatar, the incidents of his outward life. What matters is the spiritual Reality, the Power, the Influence that come with him or that he brought down by his action and his existence. First of all, what matters in a spiritual manâs life is not what he did or what he was outside to the view of the men of his time (that is what historicity or biography comes to, does it not?) but what he was and did within; it is only that that gives any value to his outer life at all. It is the inner life that gives to the outer any power it may have and the inner life of a spiritual man is something vast and full and, at least in the great figures, so crowded and teeming with significant things that no biographer or historian could ever hope to seize it all or tell it. Whatever is significant in the outward life is so because it is a symbol of what has been realised within himself and one may go on and say that the inner life also is only significant as an expression, a living representation of the movement of the Divinity behind it. That is why we need not enquire whether the stories about Krishna were transcripts, however loose, of his acts on earth or are symbol-representations of what Krishna was and is for men, of the Divinity expressing itself in the figure of Krishna. Buddhaâs renunciation, his temptation by Mara, his enlightenment under the Bo-tree are such symbols, so too the virgin birth, the temptation in the desert, the crucifixion of Christ are such symbols, true by what they signify, even if they are not scrupulously recorded historical events. The outward facts as related of Buddha or Christ are not much more than what has happened in many other lives â what is it that gives Buddha or Christ their enormous place in the spiritual world? It was because something manifested through them that was more than any outward event or any teaching. The verifiable historicity gives us very little of that, yet it is that only that matters. So it seems to me that Krishnaprem is fundamentally right in what he says of the symbols. To the physical mind only the words and facts and acts of a man matter; to the inner mind it is the spiritual happenings in him that matter. Even the teachings of Buddha and Christ are spiritually true not as mere mental teachings but as the expression of spiritual states or happenings in them which by their life on earth they made possible (or at any rate more dynamically potential) in others. Also, evidently, sectarian walls are a mistake, an accretion, a mental limiting of the Truth which may serve a mental, but not a spiritual purpose. The Avatar or Guru have no meaning if they do not stand for the Eternal; it is that that makes them what they are for the worshipper or the disciple.\n\nIt is also a fact that nobody can give you any spiritual realisation which does not come from something in oneâs own true Self, it is always the Divine who reveals himself and the Divine is within you; so He who reveals must be felt in your own heart. Your query here simply suggests that this is a truth which can be misinterpreted or misused, but so can every spiritual truth if it is taken hold of in the wrong way â and the human mind has a great penchant for taking Truth by the wrong end and arriving at falsehood. All statements about these things are after all mental statements and at the mercy of the mind that interprets them. There is a snag in every such statement created not by the Truth that it expresses but in the mindâs interpretation. The snag here (what you call the slip) lies not in the statement itself which is quite correct, but in the light in which it may be taken by igrnorant or self-sufficient minds enamoured of their ego. Many have put forward the âown selfâ gospel without taking the trouble to see whether it is the true Self, have pitted the ignorance of their âown selfâ against the knowledge of the Guru or made it or something that flattered and fostered it the Ishta Devata31. The snag in the worship of Guru or Avatar is a sectarian bias which insists on the Representative or the Manifestation but loses sight of the Manifested; the snag in the emphasis on the other side is the ignoring of the need of them or belittling of the value of the Representative or Manifestation and the substitution, not of the true Self one in all, but of oneâs âown selfâ as the guide and light. How many have done that here and lost the way through the pull of the magnified ego which is one of the great perils on the way! However that does not lessen the truth of the things said by Krishnaprem, only in looking at them one must put each thing in its place in the harmony of the All which is for us the expression of the Supreme.\n\n24\n\nFebruary 13, 1936\n\nOf course I bear the mad genius as a disciple. What you say about his dancing seems to be the general opinion â this excellence did not appear on the photograph which indicated an entire lack of the beauty and classic style of Udayshankarâs dances. But photographs are often deceptive. Of course it is quite possible to be an idiot and a genius at the same time â one can, that is to say, be the medium of a specialised and specific force which leaves the rest of the being brute stuff, unchanged and undeveloped. Genius is a phenomenon sui generis [of its own peculiar kind] and many anomalies occur in its constitution by Nature.\n\nAs to the offer of your tenantâs relative we had better wait till Prithwisingh comes. But the offer does not seem acceptable.\n\n25\n\nFebruary 14, 1936\n\nDr. Ramachandra gave me his correspondence (re. goitre of Rajuâs mother) with you to read. Then it appears you have finally agreed it is cured. This evening he told me Rajangamâs hydrocele is all but cured! True?\n\nI asked him en passant (rather struck by the last miracle, as I have never yet heard medicaments curing hydrocele) whether hernia too can then be cured. âOh, yesâ quoth he in the sweetest voice. I told him I had been operated on and the hernia reappeared. âCould such a case be cured?â I asked. He smile angelically and said, âOf course!â âHave you cured any hernia case?â I asked uncertain how to take his angelicity. âNot one, hundreds,â he said seraphically this time. I said, âShall I then write to Sri Aurobindo and Mother? Will you give me a trial if they help?â âWith pleasure, take your chance â and it is of course Motherâs force,â he added last of all.\n\nWhat do you think of that? It seems from the correspondence you sent special force (re. Raju) as R. was committed. He has not been committed till now re. Dilip who I hope is a slightly better chappie than the octogenarial decrepit lady? Shall I get him committed and then let him appeal to you frantically or will you consent without that and help as you helped with Rajuâs mother? Tell me frankly â to cut a long story short â if hydrocele and goitre can be cured may not hernia too be given a trial? Who knows? etc.\n\nYours wistful.\n\nVery private\n\nMy correspondence with R. as regards Rajuâs mother cannot have been about goitre, but about the whole case â goitre was only one of a dozen disastrous illnesses that she had; goitre was the least of them while you seem to give it the whole place. I know that the other ailments including senile imbecility and a habit of collapsing sideways when she walked are cured, because the family so certify. About the goitre I told you what I heard; I take it as cured because it was reduced to a minimum when I last heard of it and afterwards dropped out of the list of ailments reported in daily. About Rajangamâs hydrocele I know nothing except that some time ago he reported a great improvement â since then I am without news from the front and Rajangam himself has told me nothing.\n\nAs for R-s assurances about hernia, they seem to me angelical but indefinite, I know nothing about the capacity of homeopathy to cure hernia even acting as a means for the Force. As for the hundreds of cases of hernia that he has cured, you must not forget that he has lived and studied in America! The only thing to do is for me to ask him whether he is really prepared to take your case. All he said to you was about taking your chance â which is not too encouraging â generally when he is confident about a case, he is more ebullient in his expressions than that. However I will write to him and see.\n\n26\n\nFebruary 19, 1936\n\nI have read Nishikantaâs poem. He has a remarkable gift of music and language and of skilful weaving of sound and work. The comparison with Swinburne32 imposes itself and the resemblance is very striking â it is as if Swinburne had migrated into the Bengali language. The danger of such writing is a too great facility and an excess of sound and language over significance. In order to equal or surpass Tagore he has to develop a power of deep feeling and deep significance equal to his other powers and arrive at a perfect equation or balance between sound + language and sense. In the greatest poets every line, every phrase tells. Tagore himself does not by any means always arrive at that perfection, but at his best he does. Smaller poets also when they arrive at their best do it by this fusion, even though it is achieved at a lower height and it is by the poems in which they so succeed that they take their place in poetic literature among the immortals. Nishikanta of course often does that and his work is then truly remarkable.\n\nAbout the box for the tambura the best will be if you speak to Amrita who will arrange with Yogananda.\n\n27\n\nFebruary 20, 1936\n\nThat is all right. The power of attorney will have to be drawn up so that all affairs connected with the houses will be covered and you will be delivered from all farther trouble on that score. Duraiswamy will see to it.\n\nAll right about the second pranam and Sarat Chatterji. I hope you will dismiss the headache instanter â it may be only a house headache perhaps and now that that pressure is removed shall disappear!\n\nAs for money-grabbing I fear all countries are like that nowadays â it is an âeconomicâ world we are living in â with a very badly upset economy, a world governed by Mammon but Mammon suffering from overeating and a bad chronic stomach-ache. Perhaps there is hope of better things in that stomach-ache.\n\n28\n\nFebruary 20, 1936\n\nI am afraid this highly informal way of signing Duraiswamiâs draft wonât go down with legal-minded people. I am afraid you will have to take the trouble of either writing it with your own hand or typing it and then signing. Forms are forms â gue voulez-vous [what would you]?\n\nI struggled with Mahendraâs philosopho-aesthetic flourishes but after much slipping and stumbling about amid tails and curls and arabesques could only form a speculative idea of his meaning. I have kept these formidable documents for farther study.\n\nCouldnât yet finish K. P. comments which became longer than I wanted. Better luck tomorrow.\n\n29\n\nFebruary 22, 1936\n\nBut why allow these houses still to weigh heavily upon you? In essence you are relieved of them and they or their weight should be now only the impression of a past Maya?\n\nAs for Harin and his names â well that was to be expected. It is his usual method and tune when one fails to please him. But the final effect with most people is likely to be the same as with Arindam.\n\nI hope you got through all right with the American visitors. I donât know if they have heard Indian music before or learned to understand and enjoy it â if so, they ought to prove responsive.\n\n30\n\nFebruary 26, 1936\n\nThe only thing to do with this impulse to go is to throw it away. It is nothing but a push from the forces which want you to fail and want the Yoga and the work to fail; whenever they see that some forward movement is going on, they get restless and push their way in through this old habit of sadness and despondency. As they could not use the old excuses for clouding the darshan time, they took this affair of the property as a basis. But if you clear your mind from their suggestions, you shall see that the whole thing is quite flimsy. That men are attached to money or possession is a thing known ever since humanity began its course. That when one gives up money or property, there will be plenty of âfriendlyâ voices to say: âDonât do it, donât do it â too rash, too foolish.â â that too is an old experience and inevitable. What is there in all that to trouble you and make you want to renounce sadhana and the Godward will? The trouble of the property is going to be taken off your shoulders, so there is no cause for depression there. Again your giving of the houses and your going away are two opposite acts and cannot go together. One is an act of faith, love, confidence, self-giving â the other is just the opposite, a movement away from the Divine, away from the Mother. How can the two be compatible?\n\nUntil you allowed these suggestions to sadden you â and sadness always opens the way to the old trouble, if it is not rejected â you were going on very well; the psychic basis was growing and strengthening itself and that is the main thing to do now. The psychic basis once strong enough, all the old remnants of vital weakness or attachment would fall off of themselves without trouble. But what these despondencies do is to reawaken the painful struggle and tapasya â as evidenced by your letter of the morning about the dinner, etc. There is no use in reviving that â it is a painful method of struggling out of the vital evil and it is not quicker than the easier and less painful way.\n\nYou have to get back to the psychic feeling and attitude. That is the only thing to be done.\n\nP.S. I do not see any harm in the social invitation in itself; if there is any vital froth, it will blow itself away in time. To pursue Yoga seriously is all right, of course.\n\n31\n\nFebruary 1936 (?)\n\n(Duhamel33 wrote in an article that he was deeply impressed by the music of Doctor Dilip Kumar Roy, which was the best of all Eastern music he had heard. Overjoyed by such a tribute from one of the greatest living writers of the west Dilipda sent the article to Sri Aurobindo.)\n\nDuhamel is interesting and he has written very nicely about you â but he seems to have given you an official title!\n\nNishikanta has indeed bloomed out, but with his great facility of diction and rhythm he must be careful to keep his substance up to the mark as he did in the sonnets. Facility was the [rule] of Swinburne and did much to diminish the possibility of sustained perfection in Shelley.\n\nI am glad to hear and see that you are maintaining the quiet of the mind and walking steadily and smoothly and finely... [Incomplete]\n\n32\n\nMarch 2, 1936\n\nThis poem of Nishikanta he asks me to send up to you. On re-reading it I am a little mystified as to its import. He told me what it meant, still it wasnât quite clear to me. The sound, rhythm, etc. are fine enough indeed, but what about its drift?\n\nTell us what impression it makes on you. We like it for its word-portraiture, yet what is the portrait it achieves? Quâen dites-vous? And would you call this a symbolic poem or a colourful mystic one? What?\n\nI suppose it would be called a symbolic vision â it is not a mystic one. Not that a poem cannot be symbolic and mystic at the same time. For instance Nishikantaâs English poem of the vision of the Lion-flame and the Deer-flame, beauty and power, was symbolic and mystic at once. It is when the thing seen is lived and gets, as it were, an independent vivid reality of its own which exceeds any symbolic significance that it is mystic. In the symbolic poem the mind is more active and the reader wants to know what it means to the mind, as you do with this one, but as minds differ, the poet may attach one meaning to it and the reader may find another, if the image used is at all an imaginative one, not mentally clear and precise. In the mystic poem the mind is submerged in the vividness of the reality and any mental explanation falls far short of what is felt and lived in the deeper vital or psychic response to the poem. This is what Housman in his book tries to explain with regard to Blakeâs poetry though he misses altogether the real nature of the response. What the poem suggests to me is the miraculous Divine Power (Kali) in the night of Time (Ignorance?) standing beside the occult consciousness, in that night (the Cake) and doing her miracles there. I donât know whether that was Nishikantaâs own conception.\n\n33\n\nMarch 5, 1936\n\nI do not know whether your proposed holiday will have the result you suggest. Anyhow we will keep it hanging in the clouds for the gods to deal with it.\n\nWhat is most important is that you should not rush away throwing behind you your aspiration and your spiritual life and indulging dark suggestions of death and defeat. To go in that way or that mood would be disastrous and must be avoided altogether.\n\nFor the rest we will make an effort for the real relief and see â for after all that is the only solution?\n\n34\n\nMarch 8, 1936\n\nWhat Krishnaprem writes (I have not read it yet) is perfectly true that purification of the heart is necessary before there can be the spiritual attainment. All ways of spiritual seeking are agreed on that. Purification and consecration are two great necessities of sadhana. It is not a fact that one must be pure in heart before one can have any Yogic experience at all, but those who have experiences before purification is done run a great risk. It is much better to have the heart pure first, for then the way becomes safe. Nor can the Divine dwell in oneâs consciousness, if that consciousness is obscure with impurity. It is for the same reason that I advocate the psychic change of the nature first â for that means the purification of the heart, the turning of it wholly to the Divine, the subjection of the mind, of the vital passions, desires, demands, of the physical instincts to the control of the inner being, the soul. What Krishnaprem calls intuitions I would describe as psychic intimations or, as some experience it, the voice of the soul showing the outer members what is the true thing to be done. Always, when the soul is in front, one gets the right guidance from within [as to] what is to be done, what avoided, what is the wrong thing or the true thing in thought, feeling, action. But this inner intimation emerges in proportion as the consciousness grows more and more pure.\n\nI never intended that Sarat should stay here; he came for darshan and sat down here without a âby your leaveâ. I allowed him to remain for a while to see if he got any profit out of it; afterwards came his repeated illness and he somehow stuck on till one. What I meant by some concrete method was things like repetition of a mantra, pranayama, asana, etc. He has been doing these things even here or some of them at least; it is the only thing he really understands (or misunderstands?); but purification of the heart he has not been capable of doing. What I mean by subtle methods is psycho-logical, non-mechanical processes â e.g., concentration in the heart, surrender, self-purification, working out by inner means the change of the consciousness. This does not mean that there is no outer change â the outer change is necessary but as a part of the inner change. If there is impurity and insincerity within, the outer change will not be effective, but if there is a sincere inner working, the outer change will help it and accelerate the process. What use is Saratâs eating less except for his bodyâs health? But if a man seeks to restrain and get rid of his greed for food or attachment, (not by starvation, though) then he is doing something useful to his sadhana.\n\nJashwantâs case is different. His main stumbling-block was ambition, pride, vanity, the desire to be a big yogi with occult powers. To try to bring down occult powers into an unpurified mind, heart and body â well, you can do it if you want to dance on the edge of a precipice. Or you can do it if your aim is not to be spiritual but to be an occultist, for then you can follow the necessary methods and get the help of the occult powers. But the occult spiritual forces and masteries can be called down or [can] come down without calling only if that is quite secondary to the true thing, the seeking for the Divine, and if it is part of the Divine plan in you. Occult powers can only be for the spiritual man an instrumentation of the Divine Power that uses him, they cannot be the aim or an aim of his sadhana. I donât know who started Jashwant on this false path or whether he hit on it himself; many people here have a habit of doing yoga according to their own ideas without caring for the guidance of the Guru â from whom, however, they expect an entire protection and success in sadhana even if they prance or gambol into the wrongest paths possible.\n\nOf course, renunciation of sex is indispensable for the purification you seek â the heart must be pure and consecrated to the Divine. There must be no turn left that side. As for food, well, that is not so much a purification of the heart as of the vital in the physical, but it is of course very helpful to get control there. The purification of the heart is the central necessity, but a purification of the mind, vital and physical is also called for. But the most important thing for purification of the heart is an absolute sincerity. No pretence with oneself, no concealment from the Divine, or oneself, or the Guru, a straight look at oneâs nature and oneâs movements, a straight will to make them straight. It does not so much matter if it takes time; one must be prepared to make it oneâs whole life-task to seek the Divine. Purifying the heart means after all a pretty considerable achievement and it is no use getting despondent, despairful, etc., because one finds things in oneself that still need to be changed. If one keeps the true will and true attitude, then the intuitions or intimations from within will begin to grow, become clear, precise, unmistakable and the strength to follow them will grow also. And then before even you are satisfied with yourself, the Divine will be satisfied with you and begin to withdraw the veil by which he protects himself and his seekers against a premature and perilous grasping of the greatest thing to which humanity can aspire.\n\n35\n\nMarch 9, 1936\n\nYour whole-hearted acceptance of the Vaishnava idea and Bhakti becomes rather bewildering when it is coupled with an insistence that love cannot be given to the Divine until one has experience of the Divine. For what is more common in the Vaishnava attitude than the joy of Bhakti for its own sake? âGive me bhaktiâ, it cries, âwhatever else you may keep from me. Even if it is long before I can meet you, even if you delay to manifest yourself, let my bhakti, my seeking for you, my cry, my love, my adoration be always there.â How constantly the Bhakta has sung, âAll my life I have been seeking you and still you are not there, but still I seek and cannot cease to seek and love and adore.â If it were really impossible to love God unless you first experience him, how could this be? In fact, your mind seems to be putting the cart before the horse. One seeks after God first, with persistence or with passion, one finds him afterwards, some sooner than others, but most after a long seeking. One does not find him first, then seek after him. Even a glimpse often only comes after long or fervent seeking. One has the love of God or at any rate some heartâs desire for him and afterwards one becomes aware of Godâs love, its reply to the heartâs desire, its response of the supreme joy and Ananda. One does not say to God, âShow your love for me first, shower on me the experience of yourself, satisfy my demand, then I will see whether I can love you so long as you deserve it.â It is surely the seeker who must seek and love first, follow the quest, become impassioned for the Sought â then only does the veil move aside and the Light be seen and the Face manifest that alone can satisfy the soul after its long sojourn in the desert.\n\nThen again you may say, âYes, but whether I love or not, I want, I have always wanted and now I want more and more, but I get nothing.â Yes, but wanting is not all. As you now begin to see, there are conditions that have to be met â like the purification of the heart. Your thesis was, âOnce I want God, God must manifest to me, come to me, at least give glimpses of himself to me, the real, solid, concrete experience, not mere vague things which I canât understand or value. Godâs Grace must answer my call for it, whether I yet deserve it or not â or else there is no Grace.â Godâs Grace may indeed do that in certain cases, but where does the âmustâ come in. If God must do it, it is no longer Godâs Grace, but Godâs duty or an obligation or a contract or a treaty. The Divine looks into the heart and removes the veil at the moment which He knows to be the right moment to do it. You have laid stress on the bhakti theory that one has only to call his name and he must reply, he must at once be there. Perhaps, but for whom is this true? For a certain kind of Bhakta surely who feels the power of the Name, who has the passion of the Name and puts it into his cry. If one is like that, then there may be the immediate reply â if not, one has to become like that, then there will be the reply. But some go on using the Name for years, before there is an answer. Ramakrishna himself got it after a few months, but what months! and what a condition he had to pass through before he got it! Still he succeeded quickly because he had a pure heart already â and that divine passion in it.\n\nIt is not surely the Bhakta but the man of knowledge who demands experience first. He can say, âHow can I know without experience?â but he even goes on seeking like Tota Puri34 even though for thirty years, striving for the decisive realisation. It is really the man of intellect, the rationalist who says, âLet God, if he exists, prove himself to me first, then I will believe, then I will make some serious and prolonged effort to explore him and see what he is like.â\n\nAll this does not mean that experience is irrelevant to sadhana â I certainly cannot have said such a stupid thing. What I have said is that the love and seeking of the Divine can be and ordinarily is there before the experience comes â it is an instinct, an inherent longing in the soul and it comes up as soon as certain coverings of the soul disappear or begin to disappear. The next thing I have said is that it is better to get the nature ready first (the purified heart and all that) before the âexperiencesâ begin rather than the other way round and I base that on the many cases there have been of the danger of experiences before the heart and vital are ready for the true experience. Of course, in many cases there is a true experience first, a touch of the Grace, but it is not something that lasts and is always there, but rather something that touches and withdraws and waits for the nature to net ready. But this is not so in every case, not even in many cases, I believe. One has to begin with the soulâs inherent longing, then the struggle with the nature to get the temple ready, then the unveiling of the Image, the permanent Presence in the sanctuary.\n\nP.S. All this is of course only an answer couched in mental terms to your one objection or inability to conceive how one can love God without having first known Him or had experience of Him. But mental reasoning by itself leads to nothing â it is something in yourself that has to see and then there is no difficulty. Fortunately, you are moving near to that. Nor would I trouble at all about this point, if you did not make of it a support for depression and despair. Otherwise it would have no importance, since with one idea or with the other one can arrive at the goal because the soul drives towards it.\n\n36\n\nMarch 10, 1936\n\nIt was never my intention to suggest that there was only a faint hope of your sadhana depending on the if of surrender. I have always said the contrary, that since your soul wants the Divine truly, you are sure to reach him; only if you give up â and that is why I strongly object to these despondencies apart from the suffering they inflict, because they try to drive you to that â can it be frustrated or rather postponed to a far future.\n\nWhat I wrote was in answer to your statement about your former idea of the Yoga that if one wanted the Divine, the Divine himself would take up the purifying of the heart and develop the sadhana and give the necessary experiences. I meant to say that it can and does happen in that way if one has trust and confidence in the Divine and the will to surrender. For such a taking up involves oneâs putting oneself in the hands of the Divine rather than trusting to oneâs own efforts alone and it implies oneâs putting oneâs trust and confidence in the Divine and a progressive self-giving. It is in fact the principle of sadhana that I myself followed and it is the central part of the Yoga as I envisage it. It is, I suppose, what Ramakrishna meant by the method of the baby cat in his image. But all cannot follow that at once; it takes time for them to arrive at it â it grows most when the mind and vital fall quiet.\n\nWhat I meant by surrender was this inner surrender of the mind and vital. There is of course the outer surrender also, the giving up of all that is found to conflict with the spirit or need of the sadhana, the offering, the obedience to the guidance of the Divine, whether directly if one has reached that stage, or through the psychic or to the guidance of the Guru. I may say that prÄyopaveÅana [a very long fast generally leading to death] does not seem to me to have anything to do with surrender; it is a form of tapasya of a very austere and to my opinion very excessive kind, often dangerous. But what I was speaking of in my letter was the inner surrender.\n\nThe core of this inner surrender is trust and confidence in the Divine. One takes the attitude, âI want the Divine and nothing elseâ. (I do not know why you should think that you can be asked to give up that â if there is not that, then the Yoga cannot be done.) âI want to give myself entirely to him and since my soul wants that, it cannot be but that I shall meet him and realise him. I ask nothing but that and his action in me to bring me to him, his action secret or open, veiled or manifest. I do not insist on my own time and way; let him do all in his own time and way, I shall believe in him, accept his will, aspire steadily for his Light and presence and joy, go through all difficulties and delays relying on him and never giving up. Let my mind be quiet and turn to him and let him open to it his Light; let my vital be quiet and turn to him alone and let him open it to his calm and joy. All for him and myself for him. Whatever happens, I will keep to this aspiration and self-giving and go on in perfect reliance that it will be done.â That is the attitude into which one must grow; for certainly, it cannot be made perfect at once; mental and vital movements come across; but if one keeps the will to it, it will grow in the being. The rest is a matter of obedience to the guidance when it makes itself manifest â not allowing oneâs mental or vital movements to interfere.\n\nIt was not my intention to say that this way is the only way and sadhana cannot be done otherwise â there are so many others by which one can approach the Divine. But this is the only one I know by which the taking up of the sadhana by the Divine becomes a sensible fact before the preparation of the nature is done. In other methods the Divine action and help may be felt from time to time, but it remains mostly behind the veil till all is ready. In some sadhanas the Divine action is not recognised; all must be done by tapasya. In most there is a mixing of the two; the tapasya finally calling the direct help and intervention. The idea and experience of the Divine doing all belongs to the yogas based on surrender.\n\nBut whatever way is followed, the one thing to be done is to be faithful and go to the end. You have so often taken that decision â stand by it, do not let the storms of the vital quench the aspiration of your soul.\n\n37\n\nMarch 10, 1936\n\nAll can be done by the Divine, the heart and nature purified, the inner consciousness awakened, the veils removed, if one gives oneself to the Divine with trust and confidence â and even if one cannot do so fully at once, yet the more one does 80, the more the inner help and guidance comes and the contact and the experience of the Divine grows within. If the questioning mind becomes less active and humility and the will to surrender grow in you, this ought to be perfectly possible. No other strength and tapasya are then needed, but this alone.\n\nP.S. There was no question of publishing the letter. It was only for Noliniâs record book that he wanted a copy.\n\n38\n\nMarch 11, 1936\n\nI can only hope that this depression and the suggestions it brings will pass away soon. You were making very good progress before it touched you. There is no impossibility in the purification of the heart which was the thing you were trying for and when the heart is purified, other things which seemed impossible before become easy â even the inner surrender which now seems to you impracticable. I at any rate will go on trusting in your spiritual destiny until the performance of what you describe as âthe miracleâ.\n\n39\n\nMarch 13, 1936\n\nI am glad the cloud is lifting and hope to find it lifted altogether soon. It is the usual experience that if the humility and resignation are firmly founded in the heart, other things like trust come naturally afterwards. If once the psychic light and happiness, which is born of these things is founded, it is not easy for other forces to cloud that state and not possible for them to destroy it. That is the common experience.\n\n40\n\nMarch 13, 1936\n\nI did not expect that you would take what I wrote as a description of your personal ideas and feelings â if I had intended that I would certainly not have written in that way. As I usually do when I put things in the form of a mental reasoning, I took the idea dealt with and brought out its logical implications. I never meant that it had taken that form in your own thoughts and feelings about the Divine â any more than when I put the imaginary rationalistâs position with regard to God, which obviously could not be yours, as in that case you would never have thought of Yoga. I am sorry however that I put the thing in a way which could be misunderstood as personal sarcasm and still more that anything written by me should have so much disturbed you and prevented your recovery from depression. I hope that you will dismiss from your mind the idea that I meant anything like that.\n\nI shall try to give you all the help in my power. I do hope that you will be able to get rid of the idea of personal impossibility or unfitness for reaching the goal â for it is not true and this feeling must be surely the cause of the feeling of suffering when you meditate.\n\n41\n\nMarch 17, 1936\n\nI have no objection to your favouring Walking Language Thomson (it is as good a classic as the journey of Flying Vishwanath Gopal) with a letter. The one you have written will do, I think. But the postscript you propose wonât do, for it might make him think that you are admitting the truth of charges against me and justifying my conduct only on the around of my being above human judgments. That would be dangerous, for we donât know what he may have heard â there are some pretty lurid things going about European! Pondicherry e.g. that in the Ashram there is a sedulous culture of ritual immorality, left-hand Tantrik orgies, myself leading the life of a debauchee, etc., etc. It may be something else he has heard, but his distress is a sad and ominous sign. So no postscript, please â or if any only a line to say that it occurs to you that perhaps he has heard some of the wilder gossips current in certain circles in Pondicherry but you cannot believe a man of his standing and culture would give these absurdities any credence.\n\n42\n\nMarch 22, 1936\n\nThere is no rule excluding emotion from the field of Yoga unless of course it is a Yoga of pure knowledge and nothing else. Emotion is necessary for Bhakti, so it must find a place in any Yoga in which Bhakti is a necessary element. So your increase of emotion does not disqualify you for Yoga. Also cold calm is not the thing aimed at by the sadhak or attained by the siddha [accomplished yogi]. Cold calm is possible to certain kinds of Asuras, but the divine Calm is not cold; it is a basis for Light, Power, Love, Ananda and these are not things that take root in the ice. So there too fear is groundless.\n\nAs for the turning of all to the Divine, that is a counsel of perfection for those who want to go fast and far and so donât care to carry any baggage. But otherwise friendship whether between man and man or man and woman or woman and woman is not forbidden â provided it is the true thing and sex does not come in and also provided it does not turn one away from the goal. If the central aim is strong, that is sufficient.\n\n43\n\nMarch 25, 1936\n\nI was unable to get through the whole of Nishikantaâs poem tonight, so I could not give the opinion he wants at once. I shall try to do it tomorrow. His dream poem also waits. I canât yet say definitely about the whole; for I have been able to read as yet with the necessary care only the first half â the opening pages I find truly remarkable for the truth and power of their description of these things (here the blind and dark opposition of the physical and subconscient nature to the Divine Light). I shall however give my opinion on both, but... [incomplete]\n\n44\n\nMarch 26, 1936\n\nWhat happened is a thing that often happens and â taking your account of it â it reproduced in your case the usual stages. First, you sat down in prayer â that means a call to the Above, if I may so express it. Next came the necessary condition for the answer to the praye"
