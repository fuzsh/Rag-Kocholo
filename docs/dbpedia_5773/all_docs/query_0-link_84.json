        "text": "Kamalakanta took his fathers profession. To meet ends, he also started a small school. But it was his songs which made him famous. To be precise, he earned fame as a singer-poet. The Maharaja of Bardhaman, Tej Chandra, asked Kamalakanta to be his Guru and appointed him as a court advisor.\n\nBy then Kamalakantas devotion towards Kali became well known. He composed many devotional love poems dedicated to the Mother. Kamalakanta in a way followed Ramprasad Sens footsteps, both in his poetry and in his lifestyle. Kamalakantas poems depict Maa Kali as the epitome of heroism; in the poems she appears as a force beyond any kind of bondage and/or limitation. Ramakrishna Paramahansa was born as Gadadhar Chattopadhyay in the year 1836......more Bamakhyapa was born in 1837 near Tarapith in the village of Alta.... more He was also one of the first known Kali devotees who through all his life seek for Maa Kali’s grace and blessings....more Ramprasad was born in a village named Halisahar in 1723 to a Tantric Vaidya family...... more"
