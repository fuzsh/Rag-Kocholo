        "text": "Summary:The famous eighteenth-century poet Ramprasad Sen (1718-75), an ardent devotee of the Mother Goddess Kali as well as a much-admired court poet of the Nadia king Maharaj Krishnachandra Ray (1710-83), sang his own lyric in a fit of mystical ecstasy \"I’ll now gobble you up, (Mother) Kali\" (Ebar Kali tomay khabo). While the Kalisadhak (no Ṛisi or Saint, 16) Sen could not devour the dark deity but instead was consumed by her maternal love, Dr. Samanta, a native Bengali educated and employed in the US and the author of the book under review, appears to have conjured up a modern Kali Kalkattawali, to use a popular homely description in Hindi of the primordial goddess of West Bengal’s megacity Kolkata."
