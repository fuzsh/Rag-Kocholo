Finally, Ramprasad found work in Calcutta as an accounting clerk but he could not prevent his mind from trailing off and thinking of the Divine Mother Kali. He could not help but write down the passionate songs onto blank pages in the back of the account book. When some of his fellow employees saw that he was writing songs into the account book, they complained to the manager. But when the manager read Ramprasad's soul-stirring songs to Ma Kali, he recognized the spiritual greatness in him. The manager asked Ramprasad to go home and devote all his time to worshipping the Divine Mother and compose his songs. He would continue to pay his monthly salary.\n\nRamakrishna Paramahansa was born as Gadadhar Chattopadhyay in the year 1836......more Bamakhyapa was born in 1837 near Tarapith in the village of Alta.... more He was also one of the first known Kali devotees who through all his life seek for Maa Kali’s grace and blessings....more Ramprasad was born in a village named Halisahar in 1723 to a Tantric Vaidya family...... more"
