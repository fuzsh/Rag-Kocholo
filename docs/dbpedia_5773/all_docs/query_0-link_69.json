        "text": "About this poem\n\n\"Fragment. Where's The Poet?\" is a poem by John Keats. In this piece, Keats reflects on the role and state of the poet in the modern world. The poem suggests a sense of disillusionment and disconnection, questioning the poet's place in a society that may not fully appreciate or understand the poetic vision. Eliot's work often explores themes of modernity, isolation, and the challenges faced by artists in the changing landscape of the 20th century.\n\nReport Comment\n\nWe're doing our best to make sure our content is useful, accurate and safe.\n\nIf by any chance you spot an inappropriate comment while navigating through our website please use this form to let us know, and we'll take care of it shortly."
