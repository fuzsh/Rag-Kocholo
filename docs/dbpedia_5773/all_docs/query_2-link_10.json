        "text": "Sant Tukaram\n\nJai Jai Ramakrishna Hari Bhakta Tukaram (also known as Sant Tukaram Maharaj) was an extraordinary saint in 17th-century Maharashtra. He is among the foremost of the saints of the Varkari devotional tradition. He composed close to 4,500 devotional poems, called Abhangs. He also popularized community-oriented worship with Kirtans. His Abhang songs were devoted to Lord Vitthala of Pandharpur. Lord Vitthala is the form by which Sri Krishna is worshipped in Maharashtra. The other names for the Lord are Panduranga, Vithoba and Pandharinatha. Bhakta Tukaram was born in the year 1608 at a village called Dehu in Poona district of Maharashtra. His family deity was Lord Vithoba of Pandharpur. The Lord pulled Tukaram towards Himself by putting him through severe misfortunes. He lost his parents at the age of 17. His sister-in-law also died about this time, and his elder brother renounced the world seeking salvation. Debtors would not repay whatever was due to him, and creditors wo\n\nAkka Mahadevi\n\nOm Sri Guru Basavalingaya Namah Akka Mahadevi was a prominent saint of the Lingayat/Veerashaiva faith during the 12th century. She composed around 430 Vachanas (a form of spontaneous mystical poems). The term Akka (\"elder Sister\") is an honorific given to her by great Lingayat saints such as Basavanna, Siddharama and Allamaprabhu as an indication of her contribution to the spiritual discussions held at the \"Anubhava Mantapa\". She is seen as an inspirational woman for Kannada literature and the history of Karnataka. She considered Lord Shiva ('Chenna Mallikarjuna') as her husband, ('madhura bhava' form of devotion). Born in the 1130 in the small hamlet of Uduthadi, Karnataka, Mahadevi was initiated into the worship of the Shivalinga at the age of ten and considered herself betrothed to Lord Shiva. She spent her adolescence in His worship and composed Vachanas that spilled over with fervent longings for her Beloved, whom she called, “Chenn\n\nSant Eknath\n\nRama Krishna Hari! Panduranga Hari! Sant Eknath was among the great rishis of Maharashtra who brought about a great spiritual renaissance during the difficult period of Islamic rule. He was a prominent Marathi Sant, scholar and religious poet of the Varkari Sampradaya. The life of Eknath acted like a bridge between his predecessors Jnaneshwar and Naamdev and his successors Tukaram and Ramdas. His teachings of philosophy and practice are a synthesis of the quest for the eternal and transcendent while living within the imminent. This great saint was born sometime around 1530 AD in Paithan, Maharashtra in a Brahmin family which had brought forth great teachers in the past. Eknath’s father, Suryanarayan, and mother, Rukmini died shortly after his birth, hence Eknath was brought up by his grandparents, Chakrapani and Saraswatibai. Throughout his childhood Eknath devoted his time significantly to devotional practices. When about twelve years old, Eknath heard about a man n\n\nArunagirinathar\n\nVettrivel Muruganakku Haro Hara Arunagirinathar was a great saint-poet who lived during the 15th century in Tamil Nadu, India. He was the creator of Thiruppugazh (meaning \"Holy Praise\" or \"Divine Glory\"), a book of poems in Tamil in praise of Lord Murugan (son of Lord Shiva). His devotional songs, coming straight from his heart out of deep experience of Lord Murugan have greatly contributed to awakening God-consciousness in society, and continue to be greatly popular to this day. Arunagiri was born during the 15th century in Thiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu. He spent his youth in pursuing a life of debauchery. His sister always gave whatever she earned to make her brother happy, and he frequently visited the devadasis. Since he was enjoying his life in dissipation, he started to suffer from various diseases. At one point of time, she lost all her wealth in satisfying her brother's needs. But he continued to pester her for money. To keep him happy, she said\n\nSant Soordas\n\nJai Sri Krishna Surdas was a very prominent devotional saint during the 16th century. Even though he was blind by birth, he composed three poetic masterpieces in Braj Bhasha, the local language of Vrindavan. He is considered to be the foremost of the p oets the Sri Vallabha Sampradaya designates as its Aṣṭachāp. Surdas was born in Siri village near Delhi in 1478 A.D. Being blind by birth, the world including his parents, were unkind to him. In this miserable state, Surdas one day heard a group of singers passing by his house, and realised the great joy of music. At the tender age of six, he followed them. However, the group was not pleased with the idea of being burdened with the blind boy and abandoned him at a lake where they rested for the night. Surdas was now truly alone. The young boy had a natural instinct to survive and by the age of 14 he had developed a keen sixth sense, and was known as the miracle boy. One night, Surdas dreamt of Lord Krishna and pe\n\nAnnamacharya\n\nOm Namo Narayanaya Annamacharya (also called Annamayya) was a 15th-century saint and is the earliest known musician to compose songs called Sankirtanas in praise of Lord Venkateswara of Tirupati. He is the first known composer in Carnatic music. The musical form of the keertana songs that he composed are still popular among Carnatic music concert artists, and have strongly influenced the structure of Carnatic music compositions. He is widely regarded as the \"Telugu Pada Kavita Pitamaha\". Annamacharya was born on Vaisakha Suddha Pournami in the year Sarwadhari (May 22, 1408) in Tallapaka, Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh. I t is said that desiring a male child, the parents of Annamayya went on pilgrimage to the shrine of Venkateswara on top of the hill Venkatadri and met with an unusual experience. Within the precincts of the temple they saw in a vision, the ‘nandaka’ sword, and in due course were blessed with a son in answer to their prayers. The story about the my\n\nJagadguru Adi Shankaracharya\n\nBhava Shankara Deshika me Sharanam! Around the beginning of the middle ages (1,500 years back), India was witnessing a near collapse of the glorious and ancient Vedic civilisation. The utility of the Vedas was reduced to just performance of a wide range of rituals with the narrow objective of fulfillment of desires - in other words only the Karma Kanda portion was being practiced. The magnificent Jnana Kanda portion (the Upanishads ) - the cream and actual essence of the Vedas which deals with solutions for the ultimate mysteries, was completely overlooked and almost forgotten. Buddhism and Jainism took birth as a reaction against the excess emphasis on rituals. However in their opposition to Karma Kanda, they made the great mistake of outright rejection of the Vedas. In this way, they were devoid of the most beautiful message of the Upanishads - Oneness of Consciousness - the source of Infinite Bliss and Wisdom. One of the fundamental principles of Buddhism is that there is n\n\nGuru Parampara\n\nSri Gurubhyo Namah Out of several scores of men, some with sufficient stock of good Karma once in a while get a call from the Beyond. They then look up to the heavens for answers to the eternal questions - What is the mystery behind life & death? Who is the One with such a gigantic intellect for having designed such an enormously complex creation? What is my relationship with the Lord of all?.... Among several scores of such men, very few with huge stock of good Karma get to start \"The Quest\". They set out in search of a Guru - the human embodiment of all that is sacred, holy, all-knowing and all-loving. In other words, the Guru is considered God in human form. Once a man has recognized his Guru, he surrenders whole-heartedly to the Guru, serves him lovingly, learns the deep mysteries from him, and ultimately realizes the Supreme Truth himself. Among the many precious jewels on the crown of Bharat Mata, the most brilliant is this holy Guru-Shishya tradition, whi"
