        "text": "The review article provides an overview of the cultural developments of the indigenous Kirat Limbu community. The report comprehensively analyzes verifiable facts and evidence. It considers cultural, linguistic, historical, archaeological, and anthropological viewpoints. According to the Sanskrit book Yoginitantra, Kirat Limbu originated in Kushdesh, Africa. Persian history identified traces of Kirat Limbu's ancestors in Mesopotamia. Linguistic evidence also connects Kirat Limbu's ancestors to the Mesopotamian Lepmu race, which parallels Greek mythology. The history demonstrates that Kirat from that region with Shiva/Saba. They arrived at Saptasindhu and developed the Sindh-Harappan civilization, uncovered in excavations. They worshipped Shiva, Pashupati, and Shakti. Mundhum claims that their journey to Nepal took place via India's Ganga lowlands and Tibet China. When they first arrived in Himalayan Nepal, their beliefs were Shaiva and Shaivatic-Bon. Hinduism developed after Aryan accepted Shaiva, renamed Sanatan, and introduced the Brahmin-dominated caste system. As a result, some Kirats became Hindus (Kshatriya). Kashi Limbu abolished wearing the threads Janai and Kshatriya castes for Kipat right but retained native Shivaism under the Yahang, Thebasam, Mundhum, Sattehang, and other names. Another branch imported Buddhist-Bon from Tibet to Nepal under Yuma/Lhasahangma. Thus, the Kirat Limbu beliefs and culture have evolved due to reciprocal influence and assimilation.\n\nAmong the Rai of Eastern Nepal, the recitations pronounced during shamanic rituals include countless references to the natural and sacred topography of the landscape and to aspects of the natural habitat inhabited by the performers. For every Rai group, often even for every clan of it, these references are “localized” to a great extent and therefore every social entity has its own way of being “rooted” in their natural and sacred environment. In a Post-Doc project by the Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) and the Department of South Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies of the University of Vienna, I explore these connections in great detail with a focus on the Dumi Rai, an ethnic group settling in the northern parts of Khotang district in Eastern Nepal. By re-travelling the pronounced ritual journeys together with the shamans and knowledgeable elders within the real topography, these mental or “recitational” travels are mapped onto the real world. Using GPS technology and different means of multimedia documentation of the visited places and the related ritual texts, a wide array of information is gathered in a database that will eventually be worked into different kinds of multimedia publications. By complementing the data collected in the rural areas of Eastern Nepal with findings gathered among the diaspora Rai communities in other parts of Nepal and foreign countries, the influence of such concepts onto the understanding of the Rai’s own ethnic identity can be investigated. This experimental project was still underway at the time the paper was given in 2012 and some of its preliminary findings, methods and possible uses were discussed.\n\nNepal School of Anthropology, as envisioned by the founding members, is now to be realized, for which required ground work appears to have been in place. Potentials for building institutional infrastructure, availability of critical mass willing to embark on the journey, and more importantly clarity of vision among the members appear to make it all possible. Nevertheless, it has to be done not only because it is doable, but because it is indeed a historical obligation placed to current generation of anthropologists. Now is the time to walk the talk and deliver what is committed.\n\nBackground: Nepal is very rich in castes, ethnic groups and languages that have their own traditional and ritual practices on health care system. Among them, Kewrat is a multilingual group of people living in eastern Terai region of Nepal and its adjoining part of Bihar and West Bengal of India. Their mother tongues are either Surjapuri, Angika or Bengali. Different studies on ethnobotany have been conducted in Nepal but the study on Kewrat community has not been conducted till the date and this study was conducted among the Surjapuri speaker of Kewrat community."
