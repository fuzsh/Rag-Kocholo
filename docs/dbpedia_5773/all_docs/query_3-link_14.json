The name is derived from the Hindi gadar and the Sanskrit gandhdra^ a sheep, the Sanskrit name being taken from the country of Gandhara or Kandahar, from which sheep were first brought. The three main shepherd castes all have functional names, that of the Dhangars or Maratha shepherds being derived from dhan^ small stock, while the Kuramwars or Telugu shepherds take their name like the Gadarias from kuruba^ a sheep. These three castes are of similar nature and status, and differ only in language and local customs. In 1911 the Gadarias numbered 41,000 persons. They are found in the northern Districts, and appear to have been amongst the earliest settlers in the Nerbudda valley, for they have given their name to several Plages,\" as Gadariakheda and Gadarwara. The Gadarias are a very mixed caste. They themselves say that their first ancestor was created by Mahadeo to tend his rams, and that he married three women who were fascin- ated by the sight of him shearing the sheep. These belonged to the Brahman, Dhimar and Barai castes respectively, and became the ancestors of the Nikhar, Dhengar and Barmaiyan subcastes of Gadarias. The Nikhar subcaste are the highest, their name meaning pure. Dhengar is probably, in reality, a corruption of Dhangar, the name of the Maratha shepherd 1 This article is based on information collected by Mr. Hira Lai in Jubbulpore, and the author in Mandla. I. Gei notice 2. Sut divisio 3 4 GADARIA PART caste. They have other subdivisions of the common terri- torial type, as Jheria or jungly, applied to the Gadarias of Chhattlsgarh ; Desha from desk, country, meaning those who came from northern India ; Purvaiya or eastern, applied to immigrants from Oudh ; and Malvi or those belonging to Malwa. Nikhar and Dhengar men take food together, but not the women ; and if a marriage cannot be otherwise arranged these subcastes will sometimes give daughters to each other. A girl thus married is no longer permitted to take food at her father’s house, but she may eat with the women of her husband’s subcaste. Many of their exogamous groups are named after animals or plants, as Hiranwar, from hiran^ a deer ; Sapha from the cobra, Moria from the peacock, Nahar from the tiger, Phulsungha, a flower, and so on. Others are the names of Rajput septs and of other castes, as Ahirwar (Ahir) and Bamhania (Brahman). Another more ambitious legend derives their origin from the Bania caste. They say that once a Bania was walking along the road with a cocoanut in his hand when Vishnu met him and asked him what it was. The Bania answered that it was a cocoanut. Vishnu said that it was not a cocoanut but wool, and told him to break it, and on breaking the cocoanut the Bania found that it was filled with wool. The Bania asked what he should do with it, and Vishnu told him to make a blanket out of it for the god to sit on. So he made a blanket, and Vishnu said that from that day he should be the ancestor of the Gadaria caste, and earn his bread by making blankets from the wool of sheep. The Bania asked where he should get the sheep from, and the god told him to go home saying ^ Ehdn, Ehan, Ehdn^ all the way, and when he got home he would find a flock of sheep following him ; but he was not to look behind him all the way. And the Bania did so, but when he had almost got home he could not help looking behind him to see if there were really any sheep. And he saw a long line of sheep following him in single file, and at the very end was a ram with golden horns just rising out of the ground- But as he looked it sank back again into the ground, and he went back to Vishnu and begged for it, but Vishnu said that as he had looked behind him he had lost it. And this was 11 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS 5 the origin of the Gad aria caste, and the Gadarias always say ^ Ehdn^ Ehdn^ as they lead their flocks of sheep and goats to pasture. Marriage within the clan is forbidden and also the union 3. M: of first cousins. Girls may be married at any age, and are sometimes united to husbands much younger than themselves. Four castemen of standing carry the proposal of marriage from the boy’s father, and the girl’s father, being forewarned, sends others to meet them. One of the ambassadors opens the conversation by saying, * We have the milk and you have the milk-pail ; let them be joined.’ To which the girl’s party, if the match be agreeable, will reply, “Yes, we have the tamarind and you have the mango ; if the panches agree let there be a marriage.” The boy’s father gives the girl’s father five areca-nuts, and the latter returns them and they clasp each other round the neck. When the wedding pro- cession reaches the bride’s village it is met by their party, and one of them takes the sarota or iron nut-cutter, which the bridegroom holds in his hand, and twirls it about in the air several times. The ceremony is performed by walking round the sacred pole, and the party return to the bride- groom’s lodging, where his brother-in-law fills the bride’s lap with sweetmeats and water-nut as an omen of fertility. The maikar or small wedding-cakes of wheat fried in sesamum oil are distributed to all members of the caste present at the wedding. While the bridegroom’s party is absent at the bride’s house, the women who remain behind enjoy amuse- ments of their own. One of them strips herself naked, tying up her hair like a religious mendicant, and is known as Baba or holy father. In this state she romps with her companions in turn, while the others laugh and applaud. Occasionally some man hides himself in a place where he can be a witness of their play, but if they discover him he is beaten severely with belnas or wooden bread-rollers. Widow- marriage and divorce are permitted, the widow being usually expected to marry her late husband’s younger brother, whether he already has a wife or not. Sexual offences are not severely reprobated, and may be atoned for by a feast to the caste- fellows. The Gadarias worship the ordinary Hindu deities and 6 GADARIA PAR 4. Reli- gion and funeral rites. 5. Social customs. . Goats nd sheep. also Dishai Devi, the goddess of the sheep-pen. No Gadari may go into the sheep-pen with his shoes on. On enterim it in the morning they make obeisance to the sheep, an( these customs seem to indicate that the goddess Dishai Devi is the deified sheep. When the sheep are shorn and thi fleeces are lying on the ground they take some milk fron one of the ewes and mix rice with it and sprinkle it ove the wool. This rite is called Jimai, and they say that it i feeding the wool, but it appears to be really a sacrificia offering to the material. The caste burn the dead whei they can afford to do so, and take the bones to the Gange or Nerbudda, or if this is not practicable, throw them int( the nearest stream. Well-to-do members of the caste employ Brahmans fo ceremonial purposes, but others dispense with their services The Gadarias eat flesh and drink liquor, but abstain fron fowls and pork. They will take food cooked with wate from a Lodhi or a Dangi, members of these castes having formerly been their feudal chieftains in the Vindhyan Dis tricts and Nerbudda valley. Brahmans and members o the good cultivating castes would be permitted to become Gadarias if they should so desire. The head of the caste committee has the title of Mahton and the office is hereditary the holder being invariably consulted on caste questions ever if he should be a mere boy. The Gadarias rank with those castes from whom a Brahman cannot take water, but above the servile and labouring castes. They are usually somewhal stupid, lazy and good-tempered, and are quite uneducated Owing to their work in cleaning the pens and moving abou1 among the sheep, the women often carry traces of the peculiai smell of these animals. This is exemplified in the saying ‘ Ek to Gadaria^ dusre lahsan khael or ‘ Firstly she is c Gadaria and then she has eaten garlic\" ; the inference being that she is far indeed from having the scent of the rose. The regular occupations of the Gadarias are the breed- ing and grazing of sheep and goats, and the weaving o country blankets from sheep’s wool. The flocks are usuall}/ ^ ^ The word Dishai really means probable that she was originally the direction or eaidinal point, but as the sheep itself, goddess dwells in the sheep-pen it is 11 GOATS AND SHEEP 7 tended by the children, while the men and women spin and weave the wool and make blankets. Goats are bred in larger numbers than sheep in the Central Provinces, being more commonly used for food and sacrifices, while they are also valuable for their manure. Any Hindu who thinks an animal sacrifice requisite, and objects to a fowl as un- clean, will choose a goat ; and the animal after being sacrificed provides a feast for the worshippers, his head being the perquisite of the oiSSciating priest Muhammadans and most castes of Hindus will eat goat’s meat when they can afford it. The milk is not popular and there is very little demand for it locally, but it is often sold to the confectioners, and occasionally made into butter and ex- ported. Sheep’s flesh is also eaten, but is not so highly esteemed. In the case of both sheep and goats there is a feeling against consuming the flesh of ewes. Sheep are generally black in colour and only occasionally white. Goats are black, white, speckled or reddish-white. Both animals are much smaller than in Europe. Both sheep and goats are in brisk demand in the cotton tracts for their manure in the hot-weather months, and will be kept continually on the move from field to field for a month at a time. It is usual to hire flocks at the rate of one rupee a hundred head for one night ; but sometimes the cultivators combine to buy a large flock, and after penning them on their fields in the hot weather, send them to Nagpur in the beginning of the rains to be disposed of. The Gadaria was formerly the bete noir of the cultivator, on account of the risk incurred by the crops from the depredations of his sheep and goats. This is exemplified in the saying : AMr^ Gadaria^ Pdsi^ Yeh tinon satyandsi^ or, ' The Ahir (herdsman), the Gadaria and the Pasi, these three are the husbandmen’s foes.’ And again : Ahlr^ Gadaria^ Gicjar^ Yeh tinon chdhen ujar^ or ‘The Ahir, the Gadaria and the Gujar want waste land,’ that is for grazing their flocks. But since the demand for manure has arisen, the Gadaria has become a popular personage 8 GADARIA PART in the village. The shepherds whistle to their flocks to guide them, and hang bells round the necks of goats but not of sheep. Some of them, especially in forest tracts, train ordinary pariah dogs to act as sheep-dogs. As a rule, rams and he-goats are not gelt, but those who have large flocks sometimes resort to this practice and afterwards fatten the animals up for sale. They divide their sheep into five classes, as follows, according to the length of the ears : Kanari, with ears a hand's length long ; Semri, somewhat shorter ; Burhai, ears a forefinger's length ; Churia, ears as long as the little finger ; and Neori, with ears as long only as the top joint of the forefinger. Goats are divided into two classes, those with ears a hand's length long being called Bangalia or Bagra, while those with small ears a forefinger's length are known as Gujra. While ordinary cultivators have now taken to keeping goats, sheep are still as a rule left to the Gadarias. These are of course valued principally for their wool, from which the ordinary country blanket is made. The sheep ^ are shorn two or sometimes three times a year, in February, June and September, the best wool being obtained in February from the cold weather coat Members of the caste commonly shear for each other without payment. The wool is carded with a kamtha^ or simple bow with a catgut string, and spun by the women of the household. Blankets are woven by men on a loom like that used for cotton cloth. The fabric is coarse and rough, but strong and durable, and the colour is usually a dark dirty grey, approaching black, being the same as that of the raw material. Every cultivator has one of these, and the various uses to which it may be put are admirably described by ‘ Eha ' as follows : ^ ‘^The kammal is a home-spun blanket of the wool of black sheep, thick, strong, as rough as a farrier's rasp, and of a colour which cannot get dirty. When the Kunbi (cultivator) comes out of his hole in the morning it is wrapped round his shoulders and reaches to his knees, ^ The following particulars are taken ed., p. 219.

By- and -by he has a load to carry, so he folds his kammal into a thick pad and puts it on the top of his head. Anon he feels tired, so he lays down his load, and arranging his kammal as a cushion, sits with comfort on a rugged rock or a stony bank, and has a smoke. Or else he rolls himself in it from head to foot, like a mummy, and enjoys a sound sleep on the roadside. It begins to rain, he folds his kammal into an ingenious cowl and is safe. Many more are its uses. I cannot number them all. Whatever he may be called upon to carry, be it forest produce, or grain or household goods, or his infant child, he will make a bundle of it with his kammal and poise it on his head, or sling it across his back, and trudge away.” Wool is a material of some sanctity among the Hindus, s. Sancti It is ceremonially pure, and woollen clothing can be worn by Brahmans while eating or performing sacred functions. In many castes the bridegroom at a wedding has a string of wool with a charm tied round his waist. Religious mendicants wear jatas or wigs of sheep's wool, and often carry woollen charms. The beads used for counting prayers are often of wool. The reason for wool being thus held sacred may be that it was an older kind of clothing used before cotton was introduced, and thus acquired sanctity by being worn at sacrifices. Perhaps the Aryans wore woollen clothing when they entered India. Gadba, Gadaba.^ — A primitive tribe classified as Mundari i, Descri] or Kolarian on linguistic grounds. The word Gadba, structure Surgeon-Major Mitchell states, signifies a person who carries of the loads on his shoulders. The tribe call themselves Guthau. They belong to the Vizagapatam District of Madras, and in the Central Provinces are found only in the Bastar State, into which they have immigrated to the number of some 700 persons. They speak a Mundari dialect, called Gadba, after their tribal name, and are one of the two Mundari tribes found so far south as Vizagapatam, the other being ^ This article is compiled from an Report on Bastar (Selections from the excellent monograph contributed bySur- Records of the Government of India in geon-Major Mitchell of Bastar State, the Foreign Department, No. 39 of with extracts from Colonel Glasfurd’s 1863). lO GADBA PART the Savars.^ Their tribal organisation is not very strict, and a Bhatra, a Parja, a Muria, or a member of any superior caste may become a Gadba at an expenditure of two or three rupees. The ceremony consists of shaving the body of the novice, irrespective of sex, clean of hair, after which he or she is given to eat rice cooked in the water of the Ganges. This is followed by a feast to the tribe in which a pig must be killed. The Gadbas have totemistic exogamous septs, usually named after animals, as gutdl dog, angwdn bear, dungra tortoise, surangai tiger, gumal snake, and so on. Members of each sept abstain from killing or injuring the animal or plant after which it is named, but they have no scruple in procuring others to do this. Thus if a snake enters the hut of a person belonging to the Gumal sept, he will call a neighbour of another sept to kill it. He may not touch its carcase with his bare hand, but if he holds it through a piece of rag no sin is incurred. Marriage is adult, but the rule existing in Madras that a girl is not . permitted to marry until she can weave hex- own cloth does not obtain in the Central Provinces.^ As a rule the parents of the couple arrange the match, but the wishes of the girl are sometimes consulted and various irregular methods of union are recognised. Thus a man is permitted with the help of his friends to go and carry off a girl and keep her as his wife, more especially if she is a relation on the maternal side more distant than a first cousin. Another form is the Paisa Mundi, by which a married or unmarried woman may enter the house of a man of her caste other than her husband and become his wife ; and the Upaliya, when a married woman elopes with a lover. The marriage ceremony is simple. The bride- groom’s party go to the girl’s house, leaving the parents behind, and before they reach it are met and stopped by a bevy of young girls and men in their best clothes from the bride’s village. A girl comes forward and demands a ring, which one of the men of the wedding party places on her finger, and they then proceed to the bride’s house, where the bridegroom’s presents, consisting of victuals, liquor, a cloth, 1 India Ce^isns Repo'^t (1901), p. ^ Madras Census Report (1891), p. 283. 253. II RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND FESTIVALS IT and two rupees, are opened and carefully examined, '^^any deficiency is found, it must at once be made good, pair eat a little food together, coloured rice is applied to their foreheads, and on the second day a new grass shed is erected, in which some rice is cooked by an unmarried girl. The bride and bridegroom are shut up in this, and two pots of water are poured over them from the roof, the marriage being then consummated. If the girl is not adult this cere- mony is omitted. Widow- marriage is permitted by what is called the form, by which a few grains of rice coloured with turmeric are placed on the foreheads of the pair and they are considered as man and wife. There is no regular divorce, but if a married woman misbehaves with a man of the caste, the husband goes to him with a few friends and asks whether the story is true, and if the accusation is ad- mitted demands a pig and liquor for himself and his friends as compensation. If these are given he does not turn his wife out of his house, A liaison of a Gadba woman with a man of a superior caste is also said to involve no penalty, but if her paramour is a low-caste man she is excom- municated for ever. In spite of these lax rules, however, Major Mitchell states that the women are usually very devoted to their husbands. Mr. Thurston ^ notes that among the Bonda Gadabas a young man and a maid retire to the jungle and light a fire. Then the maid, taking a burning stick, places it on the man’s skin. If he cries out he is unworthy of her, and she remains a maid. If he does not, the marriage is at once consummated. The application of the brand is probably light or severe according to the girl’s feelings towards the young man. The Gadbas worship Burhi Mata or Thakurani Mata, 3^ Rei who is the goddess of smallpox and rinderpest. They offer feUefs to her flowers and incense when these diseases are prevalent festiva among men or cattle, but if the epidemic does not abate after a time, they abuse the goddess and tell her to do her worst, suspending the offerings. They offer a white cock to the sun and a red one to the moon, and various other deities exercise special functions, Bhandarin being the goddess of agriculture and Dharni of good health, while ^ Ethfiographic Notes in Southern India, p. 22. 12 GADBA PART disposal le i. Bharwan is the protector of cattle and Band Devi of men from the attacks of wild beasts. They have vague notions of a heaven and hell where the sinful will be punished, and also believe in re -birth. But these ideas appear to be borrowed from their Hindu neighbours. When the new rice crop is ripe, the first-fruits are cooked and served to the cattle in new bamboo baskets, and are then partaken of by men. The ripening of the mango crop is also an im- portant festival. In the bright fortnight of Chait (March) the men go out hunting, and on their return cook the game before Matideo, the god of hunting, who lives in a tree. In Madras the whole male population turn out to hunt, and if they come back without success the women pelt them with cowdung on their return. If successful, however, they have their revenge on the women in another way.^ On festival days men and women dance together to the music of a pipe and drum. Sometimes they form a circle, holding long poles, and jump backwards and forwards to and from the centre by means of the pole ; or the women dance singly or in pairs, their hands resting on each other’s waists. A man and woman will then step out of the crowd and sing at each other, the woman reflecting on the man’s ungainly appearance and want of skill as a cultivator or huntsman, while the man retorts by reproaching her with her ugliness and slatternly habits.^ The dead are buried with their feet to the west, ready to start for the region of the setting sun. On their return from the funeral the mourners stop on the way, and a fish is boiled and offered to the dead. An egg is cut in half and placed on the ground, and pieces of mango bark are laid beside it on which the mourners tread. The women accompany the corpse, and in the meantime the house of the dead person is cleaned with cowdung by the children left behind. On the first day food is supplied to the mourners by their relatives, and in the evening some cooked rice and vegetables are offered to the dead. The mourning lasts for nine days, and on the last day a cow or bullock is killed with the blunt head of an axe, the performance of 1 Madras Census Report (1891), p. 2 Report on the Dependency of Bastar, 253- p. 37. n OCCUPATION AND MODE OF LIIUNG 13 this function being hereditary in certain families of the cavSte. Some blood from the animal and some cooked rice are put in leaf-cups and placed on the grave by the head of the corpse. The animal is cooked and eaten by the grave, and they then return to the cooking shed and place its jawbone under a stick supported on two others, blood and cooked rice being again offered. The old men and women bathe in warm water, and all return to the place where the dead man breathed his last Here they drink and have another meal of rice and beef, which is repeated on the following day, and the business of committing the dead to the ancestors is complete. Liquor is offered to the ancestors on feast days. The caste are cultivators and labourers, while some are 5 . oc employed as village watchmen, and others are hereditary /c7/X’/-bearers to the Raja of Bastar, enjoying a free grant of living land. They practise shifting cultivation, cleaning a space by indiscriminate felling in the forest, and roughly ploughing the ground for a single broad -cast crop of rice ; in the following year the clearing is usually abandoned. Their dress is simple, though they now wear ordinary cloth. Forty years ago it is said that they wore coverings made from the bark of the kuring tree and painted with horizontal bands of red, yellow and blue.^ A girdle of the thickness of a man’s arm made from fine strips of bark is still worn and is a dis- tinguishing feature of the Gadba women. They also carry a circlet round their forehead of the seeds of kusa grass threaded on a string. Both men and women wear enormous earrings, the men having three in each ear. The Gadbas are almost omnivorous, and eat flesh, fish, fowls, pork, buffaloes crocodiles, non-poisonous snakes, large lizards, frogs, sparrows, crows and large red ants. They abstain only from the flesh of monkeys, horses and asses. A Gadba must not ride on a horse under penalty of being put out of caste. Mr. Thurston ^ gives the following reason for this prejudice : — ‘‘ The Gadbas of Vizagapatam will not touch a horse, as they are palanquin- bearers, and have the same objection to a rival animal as a cart-driver has to a motor-car.” They will eat the leavings of other castes and take food from all except the impure ones, ^ Report 071 the Dependency of Bastat\\ - Rtfutop’aphh Notes in Southern p. 37 - India, p. 270. 14 GANDA PAR IDistri- tion ana gin.

Only the lowest caste: will eat with Gadbas, but they arc not considered as impure and are allowed to enter temples and take part in lehoiou; ceremonies. Ganda. — A servile and impure caste of Chota Nat^pui and the Uriya Districts. They numbered 27S.000 per.som in 1901, resident largely in Sambalpur and the Uiiya States but since the transfer of this territory to Bengal, only ahoul 150,000 Gandas remain in the Central Provinces in Raipur Bilaspur and Raigarh. In this Province the Gandas have become a servile caste of village drudges, acting as watchmen weavers of coarse cloth and musicians, Phej aie looked on as an impure caste, and are practically in the same position as the Mehras and Chamars of other District.s. In C’hota Nagpur, however, they are still in some places recognised as a primitive tribe,^ being generally known here as Pan, i’ah or Chik. Sir H. Risley suggests that the name of G.inda may be derived from Gond, and that the Pans may uiigiu.dly have been an offshoot of that tribe, but no connection between the Gandas and Gonds has been establi.shcil in the fentral Provinces. The subcastes reported differ entirely from thoM- ren n'ded in Orissa. In the Central Provinces they are mainly occupa- tional. Thus the Bajna or Bajgari are those who act as musicians at feasts and marriages; the Mang or Mangia make screens and mats, while their women serve as mid- wives ; the Dholias make baskets ; the Dorns skin cattle and the Nagarchis play on Jiakkams or drums. Panka is also re- turned as a subcaste of Ganda, but in the Central Provitu<-s the Pankas are now practically a separate taste, aiul toiisist of those Gandas who have adopted Kabirpanthisni and have thereby obtained some slight ri.sc in status. In Bengal Sir H. Risley mentions a group called Patrndias, or slaves and menials of the Khonds, and di.sctisscs the Patradias as follows : — “ The group seems also to include the dc-cendants of Pans, who sold themselves as slaves or were ,sohl as Mcrias or victims to the Khond.s.

The bride and bridegroom are shut up in this, and two pots of water are poured over them from the roof, the marriage being then consummated. If the girl is not adult this cere- mony is omitted. Widow-marriage is permitted by what is called the tzka form, by which a few grains of rice coloured with turmeric are placed on the foreheads of the pair and they are considered as man and wife. There is no regular divorce, but if a married woman misbehaves with a man of the caste, the husband goes to him with a few friends and asks whether the story is true, and if the accusation is ad- mitted demands a pig and liquor for himself and his friends as compensation. If these are given he does not turn his wife out of his house. A liaison of a Gadba woman with a man of a superior caste is also said to involve no penalty, but if her paramour is a low-caste man she is excom- municated for ever. In spite of these lax rules, however, Major Mitchell states that the women are usually very devoted to their husbands. Mr. Thurston ^ notes that among the Bonda Gadabas a young man and a maid retire to the jungle and light a fire. Then the maid, taking a burning stick, places it on the man’s skin. If he cries out he is unworthy of her, and she remains a maid. If he does not, the marriage is at once consummated. The application of the brand is probably light or severe according to the girl’s feelings towards the young man. The Gadbas worship Burhi Mata or Thakurani Mata, S; Reii who is the goddess of smallpox and rinderpest. They offer to her flowers and incense when these diseases are prevalent festival among men or cattle, but if the epidemic does not abate after a time, they abuse the goddess and tell her to do her worst, suspending the offerings. They offer a white cock to the sun and a red one to the moon, and various other deities exercise special functions, Bhandarin being the goddess of agriculture and Dharni of good health, while 1 Eihno'^rayuL Notes in Southern India, p. 22.

Numbers of formal bonds have come before me, whereby men sold themselves for a lump sum to enable them to marry.” The above quotation is inserted merely as an interesting historical reminiscence of the Pans or Giindas. The Gandas have exogamous groups or septs of the usual 3, M; low-caste type, named after plants, animals or other inanimate objects. Marriage is prohibited within the sept, and between the children of two sisters, though the children of brothers and sisters may marry. If a girl arrives at maturity without a husband having been found for her, she is wedded to a spear stuck up in the courtyard of the house, and then given away to anybody who wishes to take her. A girl going wrong with a man of the caste is married to him by the ceremony employed in the case of widows, while her parents have to feed the caste. But a girl seduced by an outsider is permanently expelled. The betrothal is marked by a present of various article.s to the father of the bride. Marriages must not be celebrated during the three rainy months of Shrawan, Bhadon or Kunwar, nor during the dark fortnight of the month, nor on a Saturday or Tuesday. The marriage- post is of the wood of the mahua tree, and beneath it are placed seven cowries and seven pieces of turmeric. An elderly male member of the caste known as the Sethia con- ducts the ceremony, and the couple go five times round the sacred pole in the morning and thrice in the evening. When the bride and bridegroom return home after the wedding, an image of a deer is made with grass and placed behind the 1 The human sacrifices of the Khonds were suppressed about 1S60.

The bridegroom then throws a toy arrow at it made of grass or thin bamboo, and is allowed seven shots. If he fails to knock it out of her ear after these the bride’s brother takes it and runs away and the bridegroom must follow and catch him. This is clearly a symbolic process representing the chase, of the sort practised by the Khonds and other primitive tribes, and may be taken as a reminiscence among the Gandas of their former life in the forests. The remarriage of widows is permitted, and the younger brother of the deceased husband takes his widow if he wishes to do so. Otherwise she may marry whom she pleases. A husband may divorce his wife for adultery before the caste committee, and if she marries her lover he must repay to the husband the expenses incurred by the latter on his wedding. The Gandas principally worship Dulha Deo, the young bridegroom who was carried off by a tiger, and they offer a goat to him at their weddings. They observe the Hindu fasts and festivals, and at Dasahra worship their musical instruments and the weaver’s loom. Being impure, they do not revere the tulsi plant nor the banyan or pipal trees. Children are named on the sixth day after birth without any special ceremony. The dead are generally buried from motives of economy, as with most families the fuel required for cremation would be a serious item of expenditure. A man is laid on his face in the grave and a woman on her back. Mourning is observed for three days, except in the case of children under three years old, whose deaths entail no special observances. On the fourth day a feast is given, and when all have been served, the chief mourner takes a little food from the plate of each guest and puts it in a leaf-cup. He takes another leaf-cup full of water and places the two outside the house, saying ‘ Here is food for you ’ to the spirit of the departed. The Gandas are generally employed either in weaving coarse cloth or as village musicians. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of their instruments, the dancers generally being two young boys dressed as women. They have long hair and put on skirts and half-sleeved jackets, with hollow anklets round their feet filled with stones to 11 GANDHMALI ' 17 make them tinkle. On their right shoulders are attached some peacocks' feathers, and coloured cloths hang from their back and arms and wave about when they dance. Among their musical instruments is the sing-hdja^ a single drum made of iron with ox-hide leather stretched over it ; two horns project from the sides for purposes of decoration and give the instrument its name, and it is beaten with thick leather thongs. The dajia is a wooden drum open on one side and covered with a goat-skin on the other, beaten with a cane and a bamboo stick. The timki is a single hemispherical drum of earthenware ; and the sahnai is a sort of bamboo flute. The Gandas of Sambalpur have strong criminal tendencies which have recently called for special measures of repression. Never- theless they are usually employed as village watchmen in accordance with long-standing custom. They are considered as impure and, though not compelled actually to live apart from the village, have usually a separate quarter and are not permitted to draw water from the village well or to enter Hindu temples. Their touch defiles, and a Hindu will not give anything into the hands of one of the caste while holding it himself, but will throw it down in front of the Ganda, and will take anything from him in the same manner. They will admit outsiders of higher rank into the caste, taking from them one or two feasts. And it is reported that in Raipur a Brahman recently entered the caste for love of a Ganda girl. Gandhmali,^ Thanapati. — The caste of village priests of the temples of Siva or Mahadeo in Sambalpur and the Uriya States. They numbered about 700 persons in the Central Provinces in 1911. The caste appears to be an offshoot of the Malis or gardeners, differentiated from them by their special occupation of temple attendants. In Hindustan the priests of Siva's temples in villages are often Malis, and in the Maratha country they are Guraos, another special caste, or Phulmalis. Some members of the caste in Sambalpur, however, aspire to Rajput origin and wear ^ This article is compiled from Sarangarh, and Satyabadi Misra of the papers by Mr. Jhanjhan Rai, Tabslldar, Sambalpur Census office. VOL. Ill C i8 GANDIIMALI the sacred thread. These prefer the designation of Thana- pati or ‘ Master of the sacred place/ and call the others who do not wear the thread Gandhmalis. Gandh means incense. The Thanapatis say that on one occasion a Rajput prince from Jaipur made a pilgrimage to the temple of Jagannath at Puri, and on his return stopped at the celebrated temple of Mahadeo at Huma near Sambalpur. Mahadeo appeared before the prince and asked him to become his priest ; the Rajput asked to be excused as he was old, but Mahadeo promised him three sons, which he duly obtained and in gratitude dedicated them to the service of the god. From these sons the Thanapatis say that they are descended, but the claim is no doubt <juitc illusory. The truth is, probably, that the Thanfipatis arc priests of the temples situated in towns and large villages, and owing to their calling have obtained considerable social estimation, which they desire to justify and place on an enduring basis by their claim to Rajput ancestry ; while the Gandhmalis are village priests, more or less in the position of village menials and below the cultivating castes, and any such pretensions would therefore in their case he quite untenable. There arc signs of the cessation of intermarriage between the two groups, but this has not been brought about as yet, probably owing to the paucity of members in the caste and the difficulty of arranging matches. Three functional subdivisions also appear to be in process of formation, the Pujaris or priests of Mahadeo's temples, the Bandhadias or those who worship him on the banks of tanks, and the Mundjhulas ^ or devotees of the goddess Somlai in Sambalpur, on whom the inspiration of the goddess descends, making them shake and roll their heads. When in this state they arc believed to drink the blood flowing from goats sacrificed in the temple. P'or the purposes of marriage the caste is divided into exogamous groups or hargas, the names of which are usually titles or designations of offices. Marriage within the barga is prohibited. When the bride is brought to the altar in the marriage ceremony, she throws a garland of jasmine flowers on the neck of the bridegroom. This custom resembles ^ I^rimd-jhitliina^ to swinj^ the head. II garpagari 19 the old Swayamwara form of marriage, in which a girl chose her own husband by throwing a garland of flowers round his neck. But it probably has no connection with this and merely denotes the fact that the caste are gardeners by profession, similar ceremonies typifying the caste calling being commonly performed at marriages, especially among the Telugu castes. Girls should be married before adoles- cence and, as is usual among the Uriya castes, if no suitable husband is forthcoming a symbolic marriage is celebrated ; the Thanapatis make her go through the form with her maternal grandfather or sister's husband, and in default of them with a tree. She is then immediately divorced and disposed of as a widow. Divorce and the remarriage of widows are permitted. A bachelor marrying a widow must first go through the ceremony with a flower. The Gandh- malis, as the priests of Mahadeo, are generally Saivas and wear red clothes covered with ochre. They consider that their ultimate ancestor is the Nag or cobra and especially observe the festival of Nag-Panchmi, abstaining from any cooked food on that day. They both burn and bury the dead and perform the shrddhh ceremony or the offering of sacrificial cakes. They eat flesh but do not drink liquor. Their social position is fairly good and Brahmans will take water from their hands. Many of them hold free grants of land in return for their services at the temples. A few are ordinary cultivators. Garpagari.^ — A caste of village menials whose function it is to avert hailstorms from the crops. They are found principally in the Maratha Districts of the Nagpur country and Berar, and numbered 9000 persons in 191 1. The name is derived from the Marathi gar, hail. The Garpagaris are really Naths or Jogis who have taken to this calling and become a separate caste. They wear clothes coloured with red ochre, and a garland of rudrdksha beads, and bury their dead in a sitting posture. According to their tradition the first Garpagari was one Raut, a Jogi, who accompanied a Kunbi malguzar on a visit to Benares, and while there he ^ Based on notes taken by Mr. Hira.

Reli- ion. prophesied that on a certain day all the crops of their village would be destroyed by a hailstorm. The Kunbi then be- sought him to save the crops if he could, and he answered that by his magic he could draw off the hail from the rest of the village and concentrate it in his own field, and he agreed to do this if the cultivators would recompense him for his loss. When the two came home to their village they found that there had been a severe hailstorm, but it had all fallen in the Jogfs field. His loss was made good to him and he adopted this calling as a profession, becoming the first Garpagari, and being paid by contributions from the proprietor and tenants. There are no subcastes except that the Kharchi Garpagari are a bastard group, with whom the others refuse to intermarry. Marriage is regulated by exogamous groups, two of which, Watari from the Otari or brass-worker, and Dhankar from the Dhangar or shepherds, are named after other castes. Some are derived from the names of animals, as Harnya from the black-buck, and Wagh from the tiger. The Diunde group take their name from diundi^ the kotwar^s ^ drum. They say that their ancestor was so named because he killed his brother, and was proclaimed as an outlaw by beat of drum. The marriage of members of the same group is for- bidden and also that of the children of two sisters, so long as the relationship between them is remembered. The caste usually celebrate their weddings after those of the Kunbis, on whom they depend for contributions to their expenses. Widow -marriage is permitted, but the widow sometimes refuses to marry again, and, becoming a Bhagat or devotee, performs long pilgrimages in male attire. Divorce is per- mitted, but as women are scarce, is rarely resorted to. The Garpagaris say, “ If one would not throw away a vegetable worth a damri (one-eighth of a pice or farthing), how shall one throw away a wife who is cubits long.” A divorced wife is allowed to marry again. The caste worship Mahadeo or Siva and Mahabir or Hanuman, and do not usually distinguish them. Their principal festival is called Mahi and takes place on the first day of Poush (December), this being the day from which • ^ Village watchman. II OCCUPATION 21 hailstorms may be expected to occur ; and next to this Mando Amawas, or the first day of Chait (March), after which hailstorms need not be feared. They offer goats to Mahadeo in his terrible form of Kal Bhairava, and during the ceremony the Kunbis beat the ddheka^ a small drum with bells, to enhance the effect of the sacrifice, so that their crops may be saved. When a man is at the point of death he is placed in the sitting posture in which he is to be buried, for fear that after death his limbs may become so stiff that they cannot be made to assume it. The corpse is carried to the grave in a cloth coloured with red ochre. A gourd containing pulse and rice, a pice coin, and a small quantity of any drug to which the deceased may have been addicted in life are placed in the hands, and the grave is filled in with earth and salt. A lamp is lighted on the place where the death occurred, for one night, and on the third day a cocoanut is broken there, after which mourning ends and the house is cleaned. A stone brought from the bed of a river is plastered down on to the grave with clay, and this may perhaps represent the dead man’s spirit. The occupation of the Garpagari is to avert hailstorms, and he was formerly remunerated by a customary contribu- tion of rice from each cultivator in the village. He received the usual presents at seed-time and harvest, and two pice from each tenant on the Basant-Panchmi festival. When the sky is of mixed red and black at night like smoke and flame, the Garpagari knows that a hailstorm is coming. Then, taking a sword in his hand, he goes and stands before Mahabir, and begs him to disperse the clouds. When en- treaties fail, he proceeds to threats, saying that he will kill himself, and throws off his clothes. Sometimes his wife and children go and stand with him before Mahablr’s shrine and he threatens to kill them. Formerly he would cut and slash himself, so it is said, if Mahabir was obdurate, but now the utmost he does is to draw some blood from a finger. He would also threaten to sacrifice his son, and instances are known of his actually having done so. Two ideas appear to be involved in these sacrifices of the Garpagari. One is the familiar principle of atonement, the blood being offered to appease the god as a substitute 4. Oc tion. 22 garpagari PART for the crops which he seems about to destroy. But when the Garpagari threatened to kill himself, and actually killed his son, it was not merely as an atonement, because in that case the threats would have had no meaning. His intention seems rather to have been to lay the guilt of homicide upon the god by slaying somebody in front of his shrine, in case nothing less would move him from his purpose of destroying the crops. The idea is the same as that with which people committed suicide in order that their ghosts might haunt those who had driven them to the act As late as about the year 1905 a Gond Bhumka or village priest was hanged in Chhindwara for killing his two children. He owed a debt of Rs. 25 and the creditor was pressing him and he had nothing to pay. So he flew into a rage and exclaimed that the gods would do nothing for him even though he was a Bhumka, and he seized his two children and cut off their heads and laid them before the god. In this it would appear that the Bhumka’s intention was partly to take revenge on his master for the neglect shown to him, the god's special servant. The Garpagari diverts the hail by throwing a handful of grain in the direction in which he wishes it to go. When the storm begins he will pick up some hailstones, smear them with his blood and throw them away, telling them to rain over rivers, hills, forests and barren ground. When caterpillars or locusts attack the crops he catches one or two and offers them at Mahabir's shrine, afterwards throw- ing them up in the air. Or he buries one alive and this is supposed to stay the plague. When rust appears in the crops, one or two blades are in like manner offered to Mahabir, and it is believed that the disease will be stayed. Or if the rice plants do not come into ear a few of them are plucked and offered, and fresh fertile blades then come up. He also has various incantations which are believed to divert the storm or to cause the hailstones to melt into water. In some localities, when the buffalo is slaughtered at the Dasahra festival, the Garpagari takes seven different kinds of spring- crop seeds and dips them in its blood. He buries them in a spot beside his hearth, and it is believed that when a hail- storm threatens the grains move about and give out a humming sound like water boiling. Thus the Garpagari has II OCCUPATION 23 warning of the storm. If the Garpagari is absent and a storm comes his wife will go and stand naked before Mahabir’s shrine. The wives know the incantations, but they must not learn them from their husbands, because in that case the husband would be in the position of a or spiritual preceptor to his wife and the conjugal relation could no longer continue. No other caste will learn the incanta- tions, for to make the hailstones melt is regarded as equivalent to causing an abortion, and as a sin for which heavy retribution would be incurred in a future life. In Chhattlsgarh the Baiga or village priest of the abori- ginal tribes averts hailstorms in the same manner as the Garpagari, and elsewhere the Barais or betel-vine growers perform this function, which is especially important to them because their vines are so liable to be injured by hailstorms. In ancient Greece there existed a village functionary, the Chalazo phulax^ who kept off hailstorms in exactly the same manner as the Garpagari. He would offer a victim, and if he had none would draw blood from his own fingers to appease the storm.^ The same power has even been imputed to Christian priests as recorded by Sir James Frazer : “ In many villages of Provence the priest is still required to possess the faculty of averting storms. It is not every priest who enjoys this reputation ; and in some villages when a change of pastors takes place, the parishioners are eager to learn whether the new incumbent has the power {ponder) as they call it. At the first sign of a heavy storm they put him to the proof by inviting him to exorcise the threatening clouds ; and if the result answers to their hopes, the new shepherd is assured of the sympathy and respect of his flock. In some parishes where the reputation of the curate in this respect stood higher than that of the rector, the relations between the two have been so strained in consequence that the bishop has had to translate the rector to another benefice.” \" Of late years an unavoidable scepticism as to the Garpa- garfs efficiency has led to a reduction of his earnings, and the cultivators now frequently decline to give him anything, or ^ Dr. Jevons, Introduction to the ^ The Golden Bough, 2nd ed. vol. i.

Some members of the caste have taken to weaving newdr or broad tape for beds, and others have become cultivators. The Garpagaris eat flesh and drink liquor. They will take cooked food from a Kunbi, though the Kunbis will not take even water from them. They are a village menial caste and rank with others of the same position, though on a somewhat lower level because they beg and accept cooked food at the weddings of Kunbis. Their names usually end in 7 idth, as Ramnath, Kisannath and so on. Gauria.^ — A small caste of snake-charmers and jugglers who are an offshoot of the Gond tribe. They number about 500 persons and are found only in Chhattlsgarh. They have the same exogamous septs as the Gonds, as Markam, Marai, Netam, Chhedaiha, Jagat, Purteti, Chichura and others. But they are no doubt of very mixed origin, as is shown by the fact that they do not eat together at their feasts, but the guests all cook their own food and eat it separately. And after a daughter has been married her own family even will not take food from her hand because they are doubtful of her husband’s status. It is said that the Gaurias were accustomed formerly to beg only from the Kewat caste, though this restriction is no longer maintained. The fact may indicate that they are partly descended from the unions of Kewats with Gond women. Adult marriage is the general rule of the caste and a fixed bride-price of sixteen rupees is paid. The couple go away together at once and six months afterwards return to visit the bride’s parents, when they are treated as outsiders and not allowed to touch the food cooked for the family, while they reciprocally insist on preparing their own. Male Gaurias will take food from any of the higher castes, but the women will eat only from Gaurias. They will admit out- siders belonging to any caste from whom they can take food into the community. And if a Gauria woman goes wrong with a member of any of these castes they overlook the matter and inflict only a feast as a penalty. 1 This article is based on papers by of Schools, Bilaspur, and Bhagwan Mr. Jeorakhan Lai, Deputy Inspector Singh, Court of Wards Clerk, Bil^pur. II GAURIA 25 Their marriage ceremony consists merely in the placing of bangles on the woman’s wrists, which is the form by which a widow is married among other castes. If a widow marries a man other than her husband’s younger brother, the new husband must pay twelve rupees to her first husband’s family, or to her parents if she has returned to them. If she takes with her a child born of her first husband with permission to keep it, the second husband must pay eight rupees to the first husband’s family as the price of the child. But if the child is to be returned as soon as it is able to shift for itself the second husband receives eight rupees instead of paying it, as remuneration for his trouble in rearing the baby. The caste bury their dead with the feet to the south, like the Hindus. The principal business of the Gaurias is to catch and exhibit snakes, and they carry a damru or rattle in the shape of an hour-glass, which is considered to be a distinctive badge of the caste. If a Gauria saw an Ojha snake-charmer carrying a damru he would consider himself entitled to take it from the Ojha forcibly if he could. A Gauria is forbidden to exhibit monkeys under penalty of being put out of caste. Their principal festival is the Nag-Panchmi, when the cobra is worshipped. They also profess to know charms for curing persons bitten by snakes. The following incantation is cried by a Gauria snake-doctor three times into the ears of his patient in a loud voice : “ The bel tree and the bel leaves are on the other side of the river. All the Gaurias are drowned in it. The breast of the koil ; over it is a net. Eight snakes went to the forest. They tamed rats on the green tree. The snakes are flying, causing the parrots to fly. They want to play, but who can make them play ? After finishing their play they stood up ; arise thou also, thou sword. I am waking you (the patient) up by crying in your ear, I conjure you by the name of Dhanvantari ^ to rise carefully.” Similar meaningless charms are employed for curing the bites of scorpions and for exorcising bad spirits and the influence of the evil eye. The Gaurias will eat almost all kinds of flesh, including pigs, rats, fowls and jackals, but they abstain from beef. 1 The Celestial Physician. 26 GA URIA PART II Their social status is so low that practically no caste will take food or water from them, but they are not considered as impure.

Risley states that they are a fishing and cultivating caste of Chota Nagpur and Central India, who attend as musicians at weddings and festivals and also perform menial ofTiccs of all kinds.\" In Bastar they are described as an inferior caste who serve as horse-keepers and also make and mend brass vessels. They dress like the Maria Gonds aiKl subsist partly by cultivation and partly by labour.^ Dr. Ball dc.scribc.s them in Singhbhum as gold-washers and musicians. Colonel Dalton speaks of them as “ An extra- ordinary tribe, foul parasites of the Central Indian hill tribes and submitting to be degraded even by them. If the ChandfiLs of the Puranas, though descended from the union of a Brahmini and a Sudra, are the lowest of the low, the Ghasias are Chandals and the people further south who arc called Pariahs are no doubt of the same distin- guished lineage.” * This .'irticle is com})iIc<l pnrtly from ^ Central Proz>znces Gazetteer {iSyi), papers l)y .Munsiiis Pyare l.al Misra and p. 273.

The Ghasias generally, however, appear now to be a harmless caste of labourers without any specially dcgiading or repulsive traits. In Mandla their social position and customs are much on a par with those of the Gonds, fiom whom a considerable section of the caste seems to be derived. In other localities they have probably immigrated into the Central Provinces from Bundelkhand and Orissa. Among their subdivisions the following may be mentioned : the Udia, who cure raw hides and do the work of sweepers and are generally looked down on; the Dingkuchia, who castrate cattle and ponies ; the Dolboha, who carry dhoolics or palanquins ; the Nagarchi, who derive their name from the nakkdra or kettle-drum and are village musicians ; the Khaltaha or those from Raipur ; the Laria, belonging to Chhattisgarh, and the Uria of the Uriya country; the Ramgarhia, who take their name from Ramgarh in the Mandla District, and the Mahobia from Mahoba in Bundelkhand. Those members of the caste who work as grooms have become a separate group and call themselves Sais, dropping the name of Ghasia. They rank higher than the others and marry among themselves, and some of them have become cultivators or work as village watchmen. They are also called Thanwar by the Gonds, the word meaning stable or stall. In Chota Nagpur a number of Ghasias have become tailors and are tending to form a separate subcaste under the name of Darzi. Their septs are of the usual low-caste type, being named after animals, inanimate objects or nicknames of ancestors. One of them is Panch-biha or ‘ He who had five wives,' and another Kul-dip or ‘ The sept of the lamp.' Members of this sept will stop eating if a lamp goes out. The Janta Ragda take their name from the mill for grinding corn and will not have a grinding-mill in their houses. They say that a female ancestor was delivered of a child when sitting near a grinding-mill and this gave the sept its name. Three septs are named after other castes : Kumharbans, descended froni a potter ; Gandbans, from a Ganda ; and Luha, from a Lohar or blacksmith, and which names indicate that members of these castes have been admitted into the community. Marriage is forbidden within the sept, but is permitted II MARRIAGE 29 between the children of brothers and sisters. Those 4. Mar- members of the caste who have become Kabirpanthis may also marry with the others. Marriages may be infant or adult A girl who is seduced by a member of the caste is married to him by a simple ceremony, the couple stand- ing before a twig of the iimar^ tree, while some women sprinkle turmeric over them. If a girl goes wrong with an outsider she is permanently expelled and a feast is exacted from her parents. The boy and his relatives go to the girl’s house for the betrothal, and a present of various articles of food and dress is made to her family, apparently as a sort of repayment for their expenditure in feeding and clothing her. A gift of clothes is also made to her mother, called ditdh-sdri^ and is regarded as the price of the milk with which the mother nourished the girl in her infancy. A goat, which forms part of the bride-price, is killed and eaten by the parties and their relatives. The binding portion of the marriage is the hhdnwar ceremony, at which the couple walk seven times round the marriage -post, holding each other by the little fingers. When they return to the bride- groom’s house, a cock or a goat is killed and the head buried before the door; the foreheads of the couple are marked with its blood and they go inside the house. If the bride is not adult, she goes home after a stay of two days, and the gauna or going-away ceremony is performed when she finally leaves her parents’ house. The remarriage of widows is permitted, no restriction being imposed on the widow in her choice of a second husband. Divorce is per- mitted for infidelity on the part of the wife. Children are named on the sixth day after birth, special names being given to avert ill-luck, while they sometimes supersti- go through the ceremony of selling a baby for five cowries tions. in order to disarm the jealousy of the godlings who are hostile to children. They will not call any person by name when they think an owl is within hearing, as they believe that the owl will go on repeating the name and that this will cause the death of the person bearing it The caste generally revere Dulha Deo, the bridegroom god, whose altar stands near the cooking place, and the goddess Devi. 1 Ficus glonierata. 30 GHASIA PART :cupa- >cial ms. Once in three years they offer a white goat to Bura Deo, the great god of the Gonds. They worship the sickle, the implement of their trade, at Dasahra, and offer cocoanuts and liquor to Ghasi Sadhak, a godling who lives by the peg to which horses are tied in the stable. He is supposed to protect the horse from all kinds of diseases. At Dasahra they also worship the horse. Their principal festival is called Karma and falls on the eleventh day of the second half of Bhadon (August). On this day they bring a branch of a tree from the forest and worship it with betel, areca- nut and other offerings. All through the day and night the men and women drink and dance together. They both burn and bury the dead, throwing the ashes into water. For the first three days after a death they set out rice and pulse and water in a leaf cup for the departed spirit. They believe that the ghosts of the dead haunt the living, and to cure a person possessed in this manner they beat him with shoes and then bury i'an effigy of the ghost outside the village. The Ghasias usually work as grass-cutters and grooms to horses, and some of them make loom-combs for weavers. These last arc looked down upon and called Madarchawa. They make the kimch or brushes for the loom, like the Kuchbandhias, from the root of the babai or khas-khas grass, and the rdchh or comb for arranging the threads on the loom from the stalks of the bharru grass. Other Ghasias make ordinary hair combs from the kathai, a grass which grows densely on the borders of streams and springs. The frame of the comb is of bamboo and the teeth are fixed in either by thread or wire, the price being one pice (farthing) in the former case and two in the latter. The caste admit outsiders by a disgusting ceremony in which the candidate is shaved with urine and forced to cat a mixture of cowdung, basil leaves, dub^ grass and water in which a piece of silver or gold has been dipped. The women do not wear the choli or breast-cloth nor the nose-ring, and in some localities they do not have spangles on the forehead. Women are tattooed on various parts of the body before marriage with the idea of enhancing their ^ Cynodon daitylon. 1 ! ai/ASIAS AND KAYASTHS 31 beauty, and sometimes tattooing is resorted to for curing a pain in some joint or for rheumatism. A man who is temporal ily put out of caste is shaved on readmission, and in the case of a woman a lock of her hair is cut. To touch a dead cow is one of the offences entailing temporary excommunication. They employ a Brahman only to fix the dates of their marriages. The position of the caste is vc‘ry low and in some places they are considered as impure. The Ghasias are very poor, and a saying about them is * (Nitjsit: ki Jindaj^i hasia^' or ‘ The Ghasia is supported by his sickle,’ the implement used for cutting grass. The Ghasias are perhaps the only caste in the Central Provinces outside those commonly returning themselves as Mchtar, who con- sent to do scavenger s work in some localities. The caste have a peculiar aversion to Kayasths and s. gi will not take food or water from them nor touch a Kayasth’s bedding or clothing. They say that they would not serve a Kayasth as horse-keeper, but if by any chance one of them was reduced to doing so, he at any rate would not hold his master’s stirrup for him to mount To account for this hereditary enmity they tell the following story : On one occasion the son of the Kayasth minister of the Raja of Ratanpur went out for a ride followed by a Ghasia sais (groom). The boy was wearing costly ornaments, and the Ghasia s cupidity being excited, he attacked and murdered the child, stripped him of his ornaments and threw the body down a well. The murder was discovered and in revenge the minister killed every Ghasia, man, woman or child that he could lay his hands on. The only ones who escaped were two pregnant women who took refuge in the hut of a Gfinda and were sheltered by him. To them were born a boy and a girl and the present Ghasias are descended from the pair. Therefore a Ghasia will eat even the leavings of a Gdnda but will accept nothing from the hands of a Kayasth. This story is an instance of the process which has been called the transplantation of myth. Sir H. Risley tells a similar legend of the Ghasias of Orissa,^ but in their case it was a young Kayasth bridegroom who was killed, and before dying he got leave from his murderers to write a ^ /V/Yvi a7td Cttsi€s of Hcny;ai^ art. Cihasi. 32 C7//0S/ V \\ K r letter to his relatives informing them of his death, on con- dition that he said nothing as to its manner. But in the letter he disclosed the murder, and the Ghasias, who could not read, were duly brought* to justice. In the Ratanpur story as reported from Bilaspiir it was stated that ‘‘ Some- how, even from down the well, the minister’s son managed to get a letter sent to his father telling him of the murder.” And this sentence seems sufficient to establish the fact that the Central Provinces story has merely been imported from Orissa and slightly altered to give it local colour. The real reason for the traditional aversion felt by the Ghasias and other low castes for the Kayasths will be discussed in the article on that caste. Ghosi.^ — A caste of herdsmen belonging to northern India and found in the Central Provinces in Saugor and other Districts of the Jubbulpore and Nerbudda Divisions. In 19 1 1 they numbered 10,000 persons in this Province out of a strength of about 60,000 in India. The name is said to be derived from the Sanskrit root glmsh, to shout, the word ghosha meaning one who shouts as he herds his cattle. A noticeable fact about the caste is that, while in Upper India they are all Muhammadans — and it is considered to be partly on account of the difference in religion that they have become differentiated into a separate caste from the Ahirs — in the Central Provinces they are nearly all Hindus and show no trace of Muhamma- dan practices. A few Muhammadan Ghosis are found in Nimar and some Muhammadans who call themselves Gaddi in Mandla are believed to be Ghosis. And as the Ghosis of the northern Districts of the Central Provinces must in common with the bulk of the population be descended from immigrants from northern India, it would appear that they must have changed their religion, or rather abandoned one to which their ancestors had only been imperfectly proselytised, when it was no longer the dominant faith of the locality in which they lived. Sir D. Ibbetson says that in the Punjab the name Ghosi is used only for Muhammadans, and 1 This article is based partly on a paper by Khan Bahadur Imdad Ali, Pleader, Damoh. n (1^//0SI 33 is often applied to any cowherd or milkman of that religion, whether Gujar, .-Vhir or of any other caste, just as Goala is used for a Hindu cowherd. It is said that Hindus will buy pure milk from the Musalman Ghosi, but will reject it if there is any suspicion of its having been watered by the latter, as they must not diink water at his handsd But in Bcrar IhdhmaiH will now buy milk and curds from Muhammadan milkmen. Mr. C'rookc remarks that most of the Ghosis are Ahirs who have been converted to Islam. To the east of the rnited Province.^ they claim a Gujar origin, and here they will not eat beef themselves nor take food with any Muham- madans who consume it. They employ Brrdunans to fix the auspicious times for marriage and other ceremonies. Tiic Ght>sis of Lucknow have no other employment but the keeping of milch cattle, chiefly buffaloes of all kinds, and they breed buffaloes.\" This is the case also in Saugor, where the Ghn^is arc said to rank below ordinary Ahirs because they breed and tend buffaloes instead of cows. Those of Nar^inghpur, however, arc generally not herdsmen at all but ordinary cultivators. In northern India, owing to the large number of Muhammadans who, other things being equal, would prefer to buy their milk and ^/u from co-religionists, there would be an opening for milkmen professing this faith, and on the facts stated above it may perhaps be surmised that the Ghosi caste came into cxLstence to fill the position. Or they may have been forcibly converted as a number of Ahirs in Berar were forcibly converted to Islam, and still call themselves Muhammadans, though they can scarcely repeat the Raima and only go to mosque once a year.® But when some of the Ghosis migrated into the Central Provinces, they would find, in the absence of a Musalman clientele, that their religion, instead of being an advantage, was a positive drawback to them, as Hindus would be reluctant to buy milk from a Muhammadan who might be suspected of having mixed it with water ; and it would appear that they have relapsed naturally into Hinduism, all traces of their profession of Islam being lost. Even so, how- ^ Punjab Census Report (iSSi), Ghosi. para, 272. Crooke’s 7'ribes and Castes, art. ^ yrom a note by Mr. Hira Lai. VOL. m 34 GHOSI PART ever, in Narsinghpur they have had to abandon their old calling and become ordinary cultivators, while in Saugor, perhaps on account of their doubtful status, they are restricted to keeping buffaloes. If this suggestion turned out to be well founded, it would be an interesting instance of a religion being changed to secure a professional advantage. But it can only be considered as a guess. A parallel to the disadvantage of being unable to water their milk without rendering it impure, which attaches to the Ghosis of the Punjab, may be adduced in the case of the Telis of the small town of Multai in Betul District Here the dairyman’s business is for some reason in the hands of Telis (oilmen) and it is stated that from eveiy Teli who engages in it a solemn oath is exacted that he will not put water in the milk, and any violation of this would be punished by expulsion from caste. Because if the Hindus once found that they had been rendered impure by drinking water touched by so low a caste as the Telis, they would decline any longer to purchase milk from them. It is curious that the strict rule of ceremonial purity which obtains in the case of water has apparently no application to milk. In the Central Provinces the Ghosis have two subcastes, the Havelia or those living in open wheat country, and the Birchheya or residents of jungle tracts. In Saugor they have another set of divisions borrowed from the Ahirs, and here the Muhammadan Ghosis are said to be a separate subcaste, though practically none were returned at the census. They have the usual system of exogamous groups with territorial names derived from those of villages. At their marriages the couple walk six times round the sacred post, reserving the seventh round, if the bride is a child, to be performed subsequently when she goes to her husband. But if she is adult, the full number may be completed, the ceremony known as lot pata coming between the sixth and seventh rounds. In this the bride sits first on the right of her husband and then changes seats so as to be on his left ; and she is thus considered to become joined to her husband as the left part of his body, which the Hindus consider the wife to be, holding the same belief as that expressed in Genesis. After this the bride takes some child of the household into her lap II GOLAR 35 and then makes it over to the bridegroom saying, ‘ Take care of the baby while I go and do the household work/ This ceremony, which has been recorded also of the Kapus in Chanda, is obviously designed as an auspicious omen that the marriage may be blessed with children. Like other castes of their standing, the Ghosis permit polygamy, divorce and the remarriage of widows, but the practice of taking two wives is rare. The dead are burnt, with the exception that the bodies of young children whose ears have not been pierced and of persons dying of smallpox are buried. Children usually have their ears pierced when they are three or four years old. A corpse must not be taken to the pyre at night, as it is thought that in that case it would be born blind in the next birth. The caste have bards and genealogists of their own who are known as Patia. In Damoh the Ghosis are mainly cart- drivers and cultivators and very few of them sell milk. In Nimar there are some Muhammadan Ghosis who deal in milk. Their women are not secluded and may be known by the number of little rings worn in the ear after the Muham- madan custom. Like the Ahirs, the Ghosis are considered to be somewhat stupid. They call themselves Ghosi Thakur, as they claim to be Rajputs, and outsiders also sometimes address them as Thakur. But in Saugor and Damoh these, aspirations to Kshatriya rank are so widespread that when one person asks another his caste the usual form of the question is ' What Thakur are you ? ' The questioner thus politely assumes that his companion must be a Rajput of some sort and leaves it to him to admit or deny the soft impeachment Another form of this question is to say ‘ What dudh, or milk, are you ? ' Golar,^ Gollam, GoUa, Gola, Golkar. — The great shepherd caste of the Telugu country, which numbers nearly million of persons in Madras and Hyderabad. In the Central Provinces there were under 3000 Golars in 1901, and they were returned principally from the Balaghat and Seoni Districts. But 2500 Golkars, who belonged to Chanda and were classified under Ahirs in 1901, may, in view of the 1 This article is compiled from OfEce, and Madho Rao, Deputy In- papers by Kanhya Lai of the Gazetteer spector of Schools, Balaghat. 36 GOLAR PART information now available, be considered to belong to the Golar caste. Some 2000 Golars were enumerated in Berar. They are a nomadic people and frequent Balaghat, owing to the large area of grazing land found in the District. The caste come from the south and speak a dialect of Canarese. Hindus liken the conversation of two Golars to two cocks crowing at each other.^ They seem to have no subcastes except that in Chanda the Yera and Nana, or black and white Golkars, are distinguished. Marriage is regulated by the ordinary system of exogamous groups, but no meaning can be assigned to the names of these. In Seoni they say that their group-names are the same as those of the Gonds, and that they are related to this great tribe ; but though both are no doubt of the same Dravidian stock, there is no reason for supposing any closer affinity to exist, and the statement may be explained by the fact that Golars frequently reside in Gond villages in the forest; and in accordance with a practice commonly found among village communities the fiction of relationship has grown up. The children of brothers and sisters are allowed to marry, but not those of two sisters, the reason stated for this prohibition being that during the absence of the mother her sister nurses her children ; the children of sisters are therefore often foster brothers and sisters, and this is considered as equivalent .to the real relationship. But the marriage of a brother's son to a sister’s daughter is held, as among the Gonds, to be a most suitable union. The adult marriage of girls involves no stigma, and the practice of serving for a wife is sometimes followed. Weddings may not be held during the months of Shrawan, Bhadon, Kunwar and Pus. The marriage altar is made of dried cowdung plastered over with mud, in honour perhaps of the animal which affords the Golars their liveli- hood. The clothes of the bridegroom and bride are knotted together and they walk five times round the altar. In Bhandara the marriages of Golars are celebrated both at the bride’s house and the bridegroom’s. The bridegroom rides on a horse, and on arrival at the marriage-shed is presented by his future mother-in-law with a cup of milk. The bride and bridegroom sit on a platform together, and 1 Balaghat District Gazetteer (C. E. Low), p. So. II GOLAR 37 each gets up and sits down nine times, whoever accomplishes this first being considered to have won. The bridegroom then takes the bride’s little finger in his hand and they walk nine times round the platform. He afterwards falls at the girl’s feet, and standing up carries her inside the house, where they eat together out of one dish. After three days the party proceeds to the bridegroom’s house, where the same ceremonies are gone through. Here the family barbers of the bride and bridegroom take the couple up in their arms and dance, holding them, and all the party dance too. The remarriage of widows is permitted, a sum of Rs. 25 being usually paid to the parents of the woman by her second husband. Divorce may be effected at the option of either party, and documents are usually drawn up on both sides. The Golars worship Mahadeo and have a special deity, Hularia, who protects their cattle from disease and wild beasts. A clay image of Hularia is erected outside the village every five or ten years and goats are offered to it. Each head of a family is supposed to offer on the first occasion two goats, and on the second and subsequent ones, five, seven, nine and twelve goats respectively. But when a man dies his son starts afresh with an offering of two. The flesh of the animals offered is consumed by the caste-fellows. The name Hularia Deo has some connection with the Holias, a low Telugu caste of leather-workers to whom the Golars appear to be related, as they have the same family names. When a Golar dies a plate of cooked rice is laid on his body and then carried to the hmmng~gkdt The Holias belonging to the same section go with it, and before arrival the plate of rice is laid on the ground and the Holias eat it. The Golars have various superstitions, and on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays they will not give salt, fire, milk or water to any one. They usually burn the dead, the corpse being laid with the head to the south, though in some localities the Hindu custom of placing the head to the north has been adopted. They employ Brahmans for religious and ceremonial purposes. The occupation of the caste is to breed and tend buffaloes and cattle, and they also deal in live-stock, and sell milk, curds and ghi. They were formerly addicted to dacoity and cattle-theft. They have a caste 38 GOLAR PART II panchdyat^ the head of which is designated as Mokdsi- Formerly the Mokdsi received Rs. i 5 on the marriage of a widow, and Rs. 5 when a person temporarily outcasted was readmitted to social intercourse, but these payments are now only occasionally made. The caste drink liquor and eat flesh, including pigs and fowls, but not beef. They employ Brahmans for ceremonial purposes, but their social status is low and they are practically on a level with the Dravidian tribes. The dialect of Canarese spoken by the Golars is known as Golari, Holia or Komtau, and is closely related to the form which that language assumes in Bijapur ; ^ but to outsiders they now speak Hindi. ^ Linguistic Survey of India, vol. iv.

In 19 ii the Gonds were three million strong, and they are increasing rapidly. The Kolis of western India count half a million persons more than the Gonds, and if the four related tribes Kol, Munda, Ho, and Santal were taken together, they would be stronger by about the same amount. But if historical importance be considered as well as numbers, the first place should be awarded to the Gonds. Of the whole caste the Central Provinces contain 2,300,000 persons, Central India, and Bihar and Orissa about 235,000 persons each, and they are returned in small numbers from Assam, Madras and Hyderabad. The 50,000 Gonds in Assam are no doubt immigrant labourers on the tea-gardens. In the Central Provinces the Gonds occupy two main tracts. The first is the wide belt of broken hill and forest country in the centre of the Province, which forms the Satpura plateau, and is mainly comprised in the Chhindwara, Betul, Seoni and Mandla Districts, with portions of several others adjoining them. And the second is the still wider and more inaccessible mass of hill ranges extending south of the Chhattlsgarh plain, and south-west down to the Godavari, which includes portions of the three Chhattlsgarh Districts, the Bastar and Ranker States, and a great part of Chanda. In Mandla the Gonds form nearly half the popu- lation, and in Bastar about two-thirds. There is, however, no District or State of the Province which does not contain some Gonds, and it is both on account of their numbers and the fact that Gond dynasties possessed a great part of its area that the territory of the Central Provinces was formerly known as Gondwana, or the country of the Gonds.^ The existing importance of the Central Provinces dates from recent years, for so late as 1853 it was stated before the Royal Asiatic Society that at present the Gondwana high- 1 The country of Gondwana pro- Nerbudda valley to the south and perly included the Satpura plateau and west, a section of the Nagpur plain and I. Nm bers ai distribi lion. 2. Goi wana. 42 GOND PART lands and jungles comprise such a large tract of unexplored country that they form quite an oasis in our maps/' So much of this lately unexplored country as is British territory is now fairly well served by railways, traversed almost throughout by good roads, and provided with village schools at distances of five to ten miles apart, even in the wilder tracts. riva- The derivation of the word Gond is uncertain. It is the and given to the tribe by the Hindus or Muhammadans, of as their own name for themselves is Koitur or Koi. General Cunningham considered that the name Gond probably came from Gauda, the classical term for part of the United Provinces and Bengal. A Benares inscription relating to one of the Chedi kings of Tripura or Tewar (near Jubbul- pore) states that he was of the Haihaya tribe, who lived on the borders of the Nerbudda in the district of the Western Gauda in the Province of Malwa. Three or four other inscriptions also refer to the kings of Gauda in the same locality. Gauda, however, was properly and commonly used as the name of part of Bengal. There is no evidence beyond a few doubtful inscriptions of its having ever been applied to any part of the Central Provinces. The principal passage in which General Cunningham identifies Gauda with the Central Provinces is that in which the king of Gauda came to the assistance of the ruler of Malwa against the king of Kanauj, elder brother of the great Harsha Vardhana, and slew the latter king in A.D. 605. But Mr. V. A. Smith holds that Gauda in this passage refers to Bengal and not to the Central Provinces ; ^ and General Cunningham's argument on the locality of Gauda is thus rendered extremely dubious, and with it his derivation of the name Gond. In fact it seems highly improbable that the name of a large tribe should have been taken from a term so little used and known in this special application. Though in the Imperial Gazetteer\"^ the present writer reproduced General Cunning- ham's derivation of the term Gond, it was there characterised as speculative, and in the light of the above remarks now seems highly improbable. Mr. Hislop considered that the name Gond was a form of Kond, as he spelt the name of ^ Rarly History of India^ 3rd ed. p. 337. 2 Gondwana. GOND WOMEN GRINDING CORN. II DERIVATION OF NAME 43 the Khond tribe. He pointed out that k and g are inter- changeable. Thus Gotalghar, the empty house where the village young men sleep, comes from Kotal, a led horse, and ghar, a house. Similarly, Koikopal, the name of a Gond subtribe who tend cattle, is from Koi or Gond, and gopal, a cowherd. The name by which the Gonds call themselves is Koi or Koitur, while the Khonds call themselves Ku, which word Sir G. Grierson considers to be probably related to the Gond name Koi. Further, he states that the Telugu'people call the Khonds, Gond or Kod (Kor). General Cunningham points out that the word Gond in the Central Provinces is frequently or, he says, usually pronounced Gaur, which is practically the same sound as god^ and with the change oi G to K would become Kod. Thus the two names Gond and Kod, by which the Telugu people know the Khonds, are practically the same as the names Gond and God of the Gonds in the Central Provinces, though Sir G. Grierson does not mention the change of ^ to in his account of either language. It seems highly probable that the designation Gond was given to the tribe by the Telugus. The Gonds speak a Dravidian language of the same family as Tamil, Canarese and Telugu, and therefore it is likely that they come from the south into the Central Provinces. Their route may have been up the Godavari river into Chanda ; from thence up the Indravati into Bastar and the hills south and east of the Chhattlsgarh plain ; and up the Wardha and Wainganga to the Districts of the Satpura Plateau. In Chanda, where a Gond dynasty reigned for some centuries, they would be in contact with the Telugus, and here they may have got their name of Gond, and carried it with them into the north and east of the Province. As already seen, the Khonds are called Gond by the Telugus, and Kandh by the Uriyas. The Khonds apparently came up more towards the east into Ganjam and Kalahandi. Here the name of Gond or Kod, given them by the Telugus, may have been modified into Kandh by the Uriyas, and from the two names came the English corruption of Khond. The Khond and Gondi languages are now dissimilar. Still they present certain points of resemblance, and though Sir G. Grierson does not discuss their connection, it appears from his highly 44 GOND PART .tory interesting genealogical tree of the Dravidian languages that Khond or Kui and Gondi are closely connected. These two languages, and no others, occupy an intermediate position between the two great branches sprung from the original Dravidian language, one of which is mainly repre- sented by Telugu and the other by Tamil, Canarese and Malayalam.^ Gondi and Khond are shown in the centre as the connecting link between the two great branches. Gondi is more nearly related to Tamil and Khond to Telugu. On the Telugu side, moreover, Khond approaches most closely to Kolami, which is a member of the Telugu branch. The Kolams are a tribe of Wardha and Berar, sometimes considered an offshoot of the Gonds ; at any rate, it seems probable that they came from southern India by the same route as the Gonds. Thus the Khond lan- guage is intermediate between Gondi and the Kolami dialect of Wardha and Berar, though the Kolams live west of the Gonds and the Khonds east. And a fairly close relation- ship between the three languages appears to be established. Hence the linguistic evidence appears to afford strong sup- port to the view that the Khonds and Gonds may originally have been one tribe. Further, Mr. Hislop points out that a word for god, pcn^ is common to the Gonds and Khonds ; and the Khonds have a god called Bura Pen, who might be the same as Bura Deo, the great god of the Gonds. Mr. Hislop found Kodo Pen and Pharsi Pen as Gond gods,^ while Pen or Pennu is the regular word for god among the Khonds. This evidence seems to establish a probability that the Gonds and Khonds were originally one tribe in the south of India, and that they obtained separate names and languages since they left their original home for the north. The fact that both of them speak languages of the Dravidian family, whose home is in southern India, makes it probable that the two tribes originally belonged there, and migrated north into the Central Provinces and Orissa. This hypothesis is supported by the traditions of the Gonds. As stated in the article on Kol, it is known that Rajput dynasties were ruling in various parts of the Central Provinces ^ Linguistic Survey^ Munda and Dravidian Langtiages^ iv. p. 285. 2 Notes, p. 15. 46 GOND PART produce served for the maintenance of the ruler’s household and headquarters establishment. Often the site was on other sides bordered by dense forest which would afford a retreat to the occupants in case it fell to an enemy. Strong and spacious forts were built, with masonry tanks and wells inside them to provide water, but whether these buildings were solely the work of the Gonds or constructed with the assistance of Hindu or Muhammadan artificers is uncertain. But the Hindu immigrants found Gond government tolerant and beneficent. Under the easy eventless sway of these princes the rich country over which they ruled prospered, its flocks and herds increased, and the treasury filled. So far back as the fifteenth century we read in Firishta that the king of Kherla, who, if not a Gond himself, was a king of the Gonds, sumptuously entertained the Bahmani king and made him rich offerings, among which were many diamonds, rubies and pearls. Of the Rani Durgavati of Garha-Mandla, Sleeman said : Of all the sovereigns of this dynasty she lives most in the page of history and in the grateful recol- lections of the people. She built the great reservoir which lies close to Jubbulpore, and is called after her Rani Talao or Queen’s pond ; and many other highly useful works were formed by her about Garha.” "
