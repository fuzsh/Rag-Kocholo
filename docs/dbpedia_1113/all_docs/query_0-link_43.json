        "text": "× The Drowsy Chaperone\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison\n\nBook by Bob Martin and Don McKellar\n\nDirected by Valerie Joyce\n\nMusical Direction by Nancy Moser Collins Miles\n\nChoreography by Stephen Casey\n\nApril 24 to May 5, 2024\n\nThe 2006 Tony nominated Best Musical The Drowsy Chaperone is an “exquisitely honed hymn to the forgotten musicals of yesteryear” ( Variety ). The show opens with a morose theatre lover who cheers himself up by playing for the audience a record of his favorite musical, a fictional 1928 show. As the record plays, the stage is transformed into an impressive Broadway set, and a parody of a 1920s musical comedy is performed. The theatre lover, invisible to the musical actors, comments on the story, the acting, and the music during the show. Filled with rollicking dance numbers and exuberant songs, The Drowsy Chaperone will delight audiences with its love of musicals from the past.\n\nRecommended for ages 13+\n\nPlease be advised that groups (ten tickets or more) are not available for purchase online. To purchase group tickets, please call the Group Sales Manager at (610) 282-1100 x1737"
