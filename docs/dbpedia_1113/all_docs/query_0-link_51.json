        "text": "Description\n\nWinner of 5 TONY Awards (including Best Book and Best Original Score), The Drowsy Chaperone is a caricature of the Jazz age musical featuring multiple show stopping song-and-dance numbers, all while poking fun at the conventions and devices of musical theatre.\n\nYour semi-recumbent tour guide will take you on an ecstatic excursion through his favorite musical, replete with lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a rather dim hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an inebriated chaperone.\n\n*** NOTE: There is currently construction outside the main entrance to the theatre. The box office is open during the usual hours. Access to the box office is available through Clet Dining Hall or via temporary walkway (due to be installed by Friday, April 15) to Lobby exterior doors. ***"
