        "text": "The production, The Drowsy Chaperone, is a jovially musical full of bright fun colors and a comical parody of the American Musical Theatre circa the ‘20s. The production had managed to place me in the appropriate era through the use of costume and sound design. The works of Kayla Lopez, as the Costume Designer and Josh Azoulay, as the Lighting Designer, all, respectfully, contributed to my overall “willing suspension of disbelief”, as an audience member. Both the lighting and sound design, worked\n\nGender Stereotype is a Generalisation made towards a specific gender. Gender steriotypes in theatre are generally wrong and are over exadurated to help portray a story and the ideas of the author or director to the audience. But sometimes they have positive connotations and help tell another sub text story about the character. Much ado about nothing one of Shakespeare best works thought to be writed around 1598. It is a comedic play flowing the stories of 2 lovers that end up in all kinds of trouble\n\nSaturday, November 21st I attended Stage III’s production of the musical The Drowsy Chaperone at the Beaudoin Theater in Siena Campus’ Foy Hall. In order to keep productions interesting for all members of the audience, Stage III productions differ each year. So, Stage III production genres vary each year, as no genre of play or musical is repeated within the same year. The musical direction in Stage III’s The Drowsy Chaperone was by Dr. Timothy J. Reno, while the music and lyrics were by Lisa Lambert\n\nGender Stereotype is a generalization made towards a specific gender that makes a simplistic generalization about their attributes, differences or roles of that group of people. Gender stereotypes in theatre are generally over exaggerated to help portray a story and the ideas of the author or director to the audience this helps build the character and the plot line while helping the audience understand or make comparisons between real world and theatrical world stereotypes. The directors can use\n\nThe group presentation topic that Missy, Alli, and I decided to work on was Body Image. Particularly the female body image portrayed in media and how it can affect young girls and women alike. The materials we’ve chosen so far are a speech given by Jennifer Aniston on women’s bodies and The diary of Anne Frank. We have also chosen People magazine, because of their “tips and tricks” for weight loss and makeup, plus our own experiences as women(People). They are easily alike in the matter that they\n\nI attended the musical Drowsy Chaperone that was performed at Saint Peter’s University in the Roy Irving Theater. I arrived to the theater at about 7:45 pm and the musical was supposed to start at 8pm. The musical was a casual manner, so I dressed comfortably in jeans and a sweatshirt. I did not know what to really expect from the musical because prior to seeing Drowsy Chaperone I had never seen a musical live before. I did hear from some of my classmates who seen the musical previously that the\n\nI stand backstage in the wings, waiting for my entrance. It’s opening night of The Drowsy Chaperone, and I’m playing the role of Trix the Aviatrix. I’m slightly panicking. I don’t know what to expect from eight hundred new eyes watching me from the audience. The orchestra starts up. My friend grabs my arm, and tells me to “break a leg”. I make my entrance. I stand on a platform in the doorway of the set, high enough to make eye contact with the people sitting in the back of the balcony. I can feel\n\nWhile I have gone to a few live events, the only theatrical one that I seem to remember was the one live event I paid the least attention to. In my junior year of high school, everyone in our year who was taking the Shakespearean English class took a field trip to the Tennessee Shakespeare Company that operated out of a building located about fifteen minutes from my school. The aim of the field trip was to learn more about Shakespeare from a perspective based more on producing and acting, rather\n\nthis paper. The Crucible is about events that have taken place during the Salem Witch Trials and addressing the terrors that can result of mob psychology in society (UT Austin, 2018). The next show put on at UT Austin was a musical called The Drowsy Chaperone, a fun comedy about the era of jazz\n\nProlouge Once upon a time… Wait a minute, no, this is not your cliche fairy tale. It doesn’t have a princess and a dashing prince who fall for each other after overcoming some stupid obstacle like a poison apple or sleeping curse. I’ve read those stories, but it’s all the same, everyone gets a happy ending except for the villain. That’s going to change right now because this is my story, and my fairy tale certainly doesn’t end with everyone getting their happy ending. This is the story of Cinderella"
