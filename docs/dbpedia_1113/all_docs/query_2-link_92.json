        "text": "For anyone who loves musical theater, and especially for anyone who loves the history of musical theater, Alhambra Theatre & Dining's latest show, \"The Drowsy Chaperone,\" is a delight.\n\nThe musical, which won five 2006 Tony Awards and seven Drama Desk Awards, including best musical, offers, in a play within a play, a delightful send-up of a typical musical of the 1920s. That was a time when, with rare exceptions (\"Show Boat\"), silly, cliched plots were used as a way to get from one song to the next.\n\nPresenting \"The Drowsy Chaperone,\" the fictitious 1928 musical, is Man in Chair, a lonely middle-aged man who takes comfort in listening to Broadway cast albums. So he plays his vinyl copy of \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" for the benefit of the audience and as he does the show materializes in his apartment. Occasionally he lifts the needle on his record player and the cast freezes. Then he fills in the audience about the backstory of various performers.\n\nThere's a well-to-do, lovestruck young bachelor, a beautiful show girl, her soused \"chaperone,\" a Latin lover, a couple of comic gangsters, an extravagant Broadway producer and his ditzy girlfriend, a distinguished hostess and her loyal servant, a harassed best man who can't remember to make arrangements for the big wedding that's about to take place and an aviatrix. All of this is played quite effectively for laughs.\n\nThe music manages to be both stirring and comical, like \"As We Stumble Along,\" a big ballad that Man in Chair characterizes as a \"rousing anthem to alcoholism.\"\n\nThe Alhambra's excellent cast is headed by Joel Newsome, a Broadway veteran who is winsome and touching as the Man in Chair.\n\nCharlie Patton: (904) 359-4413"
