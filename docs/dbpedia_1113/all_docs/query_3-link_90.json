        "text": "During Black History Month, Sinneh J. Koroma Jr., United South High School assistant principal, spoke to a group of USHS students. Koroma’s theme for this year’s presentation was \"African-Americans and the Civil War.\" In his presentation, Koroma stated that \"blacks contributed to the creation of a free nation before they had freedom for themselves.\"\n\nKoroma also emphasized how important it is for all students to set their goals early in life. Black History Month took shape in 1926 when Dr. Carter Godwin Woodson and other African American and white scholars believed that Americans should reflect on the history and contributions of African Americans.\n\nThe fourth-grade Webelos Scouts from Pack 201, chartered through United Day School, visited with City of Laredo Mayor Raul G. Salinas to finalize the requirements to earn their Citizenship Activity badge.\n\nThe Webelos are working on their Citizenship Activity Badge. As part of the badge, the scouts were required to visit with a community leader to find out about his duties. They scouts were given lots of choices regarding various community leaders here in Laredo -- these boys unanimously chose to meet Salinas. They were interested in finding out about him, what the mayor does, what made him decide to become the mayor, what he did before he was mayor, whether he has to travel, has he ever met with any famous people and whether he has met the president.\n\nAs part of the citizenship badge, the scouts also needed to learn what they could do to be a better citizen here in Laredo, they had to do a community service project, they had to know the name of the president, vice president and governor. They also had to demonstrate how to hang the flag and how the flag should be respected, explain the rights and duties of a US citizen, repeat the Pledge of Allegiance from memory and explain in their own words what the pledge means.\n\nThe meeting with Salinas was last requirement for the scouts to earn their badge. The scouts will be awarded their Citizenship Activity badges at a banquet next month.\n\nThe Webelos Den leaders are John Paul and Dr. John Kilburn\n\nPack 201 Webelos Scouts are: Eddie Castillon, Robert \"Bo\" Kilburn, Enrique Medina, Brennan Mohrer, Devin Mulchand, and Jack Paul. Not pictured is Alex Guerrero.\n\nThe National Center for Educational Achievement (NCEA), a department of ACT, named UISD’s Trautmann Elementary School in its 2010 NCEA Higher Performing Schools List for Texas.\n\nThe list identifies elementary, middle, and high schools that have consistently outperformed their peers that serve similar student populations and recognizes their achievement in bringing more students to college and career readiness than expected.\n\nSchools on the list are identified by one of two measures: academic growth of students at the school and/or absolute achievement of students at the school using the TAKS' Commended Performance level. The measures exemplify not only those schools that are able to improve their student performance from previous years but also those schools that push their students beyond the Met Standard (passing) level - a level that is typically too low to accurately measure student preparedness for postsecondary learning. NCEA's identification of Higher Performing Schools is more selective than the Texas Education Agency's Exemplary or Recognized list and comprises fewer than 10 percent of public schools in the state.\n\nTrautmann Elementary Principal, Cynthia Rodriguez, was elated with the news that her campus had achieved NCEA recognition.\n\n\"I’m thankful for the exceptional staff that that I have. Thanks to them we are able to make extraordinary strides with our students,\" she said.\n\nTaylor Peters, United Day School's Teachers of Tomorrow Club president, handed a check to Nellie Trust, Friends of the Library representative last week after a very successful fundraising campaign initiated at the school.\n\n\"It is with great pleasure that we present a check to the Friends of the Library for $1,250 for the purchase of 50 new books,\" Peters said.\n\n\"The Teachers of Tomorrow Club decided to participate in the Friends of the Library fund drive in November of this school year,\" said Tracy Doan, teacher-sponsor of the club.\n\nShe said the club president had a meeting with all of the members and decided by vote to take on this worthy project. To start off, the members shared the responsibility of making presentations to each homeroom class. The goal of the project was to request that all 473 United Day School students donate $1 toward the purchase of books.\n\nThe Teachers of Tomorrow officers and members collected and counted the money that was brought in over a period of six weeks. Every count ended in the tabulation of how many books could be purchased. The project caught fire as it proceeded and after the final tabulation, the members had collected $1,250.\n\n\"The students knew that this amount would bring in 50 new books for the new city libraries,\" Doan said.\" Every student in the school as well as staff members participated in this worthy cause.\"\n\nAccepting the check, Trust thanked the students for their commitment and hard work.\n\n\"Countless library patrons will benefit from your decision to help our community in this manner,\" Trust said. \"You can feel very proud of your commitment to enhance literacy in our city and surrounding areas.\"\n\nForms for the adoption of books or the purchase of bricks can be found at the Laredo Public Library (call 795-2400). The book adoption is $25 and the brick purchase is $50.\n\nPictured, front row: Laredo Public Library Director, Maria Soliz; students, Sofia Perez, Katarina Sierra, Vanessa Flores.Pictured, back row: Taylor Peters (club president), Tracy Doan (club sponsor), Sophia Pena, Ana Gaby Medina, Aleza Trevino, Analy Rechy, Rita Peters (school principal) and Nellie Trust, Friends of the Library representative."
