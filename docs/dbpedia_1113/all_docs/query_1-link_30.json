        "text": "The Plot\n\nMPO leaps into another hit musical â€“ The Drowsy Chaperone, by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, directed by Karen Pankhurst.\n\nMPO's next production, to be performed after Easter in 2024, is a hit Broadway musical THE DROWSY CHAPERONE, which carried off 5 Tonys in New York and was nominated for several awards in London and the USA It's a very funny send-up of 1920s Hollywood musicals, with an implausible plot, even more implausible characters, and some great music and dancing from the Jazz age. The entire show is set in the apartment of a slightly sad musical theatre fan who decides to play his favourite LP (the show!) and behold, it comes to life before his eyes in his own living room.\n\nThe story concerns a wedding. The Drowsy Chaperone of the title (\"Drowsy\" is an American euphemism for drunk) has the job of keeping the bride, a Broadway star who is giving up fame and the footlights to get married, away from her bridegroom, an oil heir, on their wedding day. Needless to say, she fails.\n\nThe star's producer, one Mr Feldzieg (no relation to the famous Zeigfeld!) is hell-bent on preventing the wedding, as he will be bankrupted following the loss of his biggest star. Several jovial gangsters, disguised as pastry chefs, are also trying to frustrate the match. They work for an anonymous third party who has invested a lot of money in the show. They intend to punish Feldzeig if he fails.\n\nThe plot is further enlivened by the antics of the groom's Best man, George (played by a girl), a latin lothario, Adolpho and a wannabe Broadway star, Kitty.\n\nMost of the MPO regulars are in the show, along with some talented newcomers. They are being worked hard by director Karen Pankhurst. This is her second show. She directed last year's highly enjoyable \"Everything Goes\" and has featured in several successful MPO productions.\n\nThe \"Drowsy Chaperone\" plays in the Milborne Port Village hall from April 3-6, the week after Easter.\n\nThe box office will open on March 1st. Tickets can only be bought online at www.mpopera.co.uk\n\nDon't miss. Book the date!"
