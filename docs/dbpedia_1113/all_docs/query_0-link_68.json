        "text": "by Bastrop Opera House\n\nMay. 03 - May. 19\n\nFridays-Saturdays\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is a loving send-up of the Golden Age musical, featuring one show-stopping song and dance number after another. With the house lights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life and The Drowsy Chaperone begins as the man in the chair looks on. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight.\n\nWinner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score.\n\nDirected by Kelsey Layton.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone\n\nby book: Bob Martin & Don McKellar, music & lyrics by Lisa Lambert & Greg Morrison\n\nBastrop Opera House\n\nFridays-Saturdays,\n\nMay 03 - May 19, 2024\n\nBastrop Opera House\n\n711 Spring Street\n\nBastrop, TX, 78602\n\nMay 3 - 19, 2024\n\nBastrop Opera House, 711 Spring Street\n\nTickets $25, available online HERE\n\nCTX Live Theatre is a project — or maybe no more than a hobby, bordering on a quiet obsession — devoted to supporting live narrative theatre in Central Texas.
