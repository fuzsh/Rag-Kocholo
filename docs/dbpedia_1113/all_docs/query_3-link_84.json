The affair is complicated by a stable of broad characters, including a sputtering impresario who wants to derail the marriage, two midget-sized gangsters dressed as pastry chefs, a funny-accented lothario, assorted babes, an addle-brained dowager and, of course, the drowsy (meaning, permanently tipsy) chaperone.\n\nEntertaining parodies or winking revivals of flapper-era shows are nothing new. But this show, which won a bunch of Tony Awards for its 2006 Broadway production, separates the performance from the context. At frequent moments, the music-lover lifts the needle from the record and the cast freezes while he inserts chat-to-audience commentary that alternates between smirking and loving.\n\nThat’s about it, in a blithe, though frantic one-act performance that lasts about an hour and 40 minutes and ends in a colossal finale involving an aviatrix who swoops in from nowhere to resolve the plot, such as it is.\n\nSince it’s a musical within a play, there’s no apparent need to develop characters beyond their fiercely precise duties as mechanicals in bits and production numbers. And this touring production is stupendously precise, without a word or gesture that hasn’t been carefully choreographed. The scenic changes that seem to bloom out of nowhere or explode from disappearing walls merit the Tony Award set designer David Gallo received, and the frequently garish costumes demonstrate why the show snagged a Tony for Gregg Barnes’ costume designs.\n\nThe show also took Tonys for best book (Bob Martin and Don McKellar) and best score (Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison). Well, fine: It’s a tight, smart show and the songs — dominated by production numbers — are pretty swell, though you won’t be humming them on the way home.\n\nThe performers are all first-rate at what they do, but the only one who connects on a human level is Jonathan Crombie as the apartment-dwelling “Man in Chair,” who is both warmly engaging and witty, but also vaguely sad — someone whose only joy is vicarious. Of the rest, locals will recognize Georgia Engel, who played Ted Baxter’s whisper-voiced girlfriend on the “Mary Tyler Moore Show,” and will marvel that she hasn’t changed a bit, even when repeatedly spewing vodka on her butler’s face.\n\nThe others are talented musical-theater pros, including Andrea Chamberlain as the foxy altar-bound starlet, James Moye as the limber-limbed lothario and Nancy Opel as the pixilated chaperone.\n\nIn all, they deliver a breezy night that fulfills what the show’s narrator yearns to get from a musical — to be carried away for a few hours.\n\nWhat: “The Drowsy Chaperone”\n\nWhere: Ordway Center for the Performing Arts, 8 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturdays, 2 and 7:30 p.m. Sundays through March 30.\n\nTickets: $70-$48 at www.ordway.org or call 651-224-4222\n\nCapsule: You won’t get drowsy.\n\nOriginally Published: March 19, 2008 at 11:01 p.m."
