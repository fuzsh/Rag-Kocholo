        "text": "The Ogunquit Playhouse was honored to have the Tony Award winning librettist and lyricist of The Drowsy Chaperone, Lisa Lambert in the audience for the Opening Night of the “Musical Within a Comedy,” onstage now through June 26th. The cast, crew and honored guests met at Five-0 Shore Road Restaurant in Ogunquit for a delightful celebration following the exciting Opening Night performance. Lisa Lambert expressed great enthusiasm for the Ogunquit production, exclaiming how much she enjoys watching different casts put their own personal stamp on her creation and that “Carson Kressley was just wonderful!”\n\nIn addition to the 2006 Tony Award, Lisa Lambert received the Drama Desk, Outer Critics Circle and Backstage West Garland awards for her work on The Drowsy Chaperone. This unique musical all started when Second City, (the Toronto/Chicago based sketch comedy and improv company) performers Bob Martin and Janet Van De Graaff fell in love, got engaged and asked their songwriter friend Lisa Lambert to be a best man at their wedding. Instead of the traditional bachelor party Lampert enlisted Don McKellar, Greg Morrison and a team of theatrically-minded colleagues to create and perform a 40-minute original musical called The Drowsy Chaperone and named the lead characters ‘Bob Martin' and ‘Janet Van De Graaff' (the show's bride and groom). After the presentation, Bob joined his cast of friends on stage and, now famously, quipped: “What a wonderful show. I have some notes.” Those notes would be the beginnings of the “Man in Chair,” the character who sets the framework for, The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nThe Ogunquit production stars Carson Kressley making his stage debut as Man in Chair and Georgia Engel reprising her Broadway role as Mrs. Tottendale. Broadway veteran Liz Larsen co-stars as the Drowsy Chaperone. Lisa co-wrote the music and lyrics with Greg Morrison, winning the Tony in 2006. Helming the production for Ogunquit is Director Casey Hushio, who was part of the original Broadway creative team. The show is receiving rave reviews, calling Carson “Perfect” and Georgia, “Excellent!”\n\nCarson Kressley is cast as the Man in Chair, an obsessive fan of old musicals who imagines performers coming to life in his shabby apartment whenever he plays one of his favorite cast recordings. Throughout the show the musical bursts to life as the Man in Chair continuously brings the audience in and out of the fantasy. Kressley is probably best known for his Emmy Award winning work on the breakout Bravo network hit, \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" as well as for hosting the critically acclaimed and Lifetime's highest rated reality show, \"How to Look Good Naked.\" His new show, “True Beauty” is on ABC, Monday nights this summer.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone also features Georgia Engel, reprising the role of Mrs. Tottendale, the role she created for the original Broadway production. Georgia is best known to audiences as Georgette Baxter from the “Mary Tyler Moore Show,” for which she received two Emmy nominations. She has had a very successful Broadway and Television career, including four more television series, most notably in the recurring role of Pat McDougal in the CBS comedy “Everybody Loves Raymond.”\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is on stage June 9 through June 26. The season continues with The Sound of Music, June 30 through July 24; Sunset Boulevard, July 28 through August 14; Monty Python's Spamalot, August 18 through September 11; Chicago, wraps up the Playhouse season, September 15 through October 24 featuring Sally Struthers in the roll of Matron “Mama” Morton.\n\nThe Ogunquit Playhouse is America's Foremost Summer Theatre producing the finest Broadway musicals each season, with performances Tuesday through Sunday, from June 9 to October 24, 2010. Main Stage tickets prices range from $49-$67 per show. Gift Certificates and Season Subscriptions are also on sale now.
