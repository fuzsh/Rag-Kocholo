Of course the phrase ‘gay wedding’ has a different meaning now… but back then it just meant fun. That’s all this show is – fun!” says the Man in Chair as he reads the record cover of his favourite musical from 1928, The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nThis fictitious musical is the foundation for the real 2006 Broadway hit of the same name, running at the Phoenix Theatre throughout November.\n\nInternationally renowned director and choreographer Jacques Lemay agrees that it’s the perfect antidote to the stresses of everyday life. “If you’re wanting to escape reality and have a good belly laugh, this show is the perfect solution for you,” he says. “The Drowsy Chaperone is pure and simple escapism.”\n\n“It’s a fun pastiche of old Broadway and the music is really quite lovely,” says Lemay. As well as directing and choreographing theatre students in the play, Lemay is currently teaching stage combat to fourth-year performance students this term as a new Adjunct Professor at the Department of Theatre.\n\n“It’s remarkably both nostalgic and current, as we watch the parody of the past through the eyes of the imaginative, agoraphobic and slightly sarcastic narrator, the Man in Chair, who’s stuck here in the present.” (Shown right: Douglas Peerless in Phoenix production)\n\nThe real magic of The Drowsy Chaperone is derived from the transformation of the Man in the Chair’s shabby one-room apartment where he listens to his records and escapes into the glamorous world of his musicals — in this instance, the glittering world of movie stars, highfalutin’ mansions, fantastical weddings, and of course, menacing pastry chef gangsters.\n\nCollaborating to create this illusion is a stellar design team of UVic alumni, including set designer Bryan Kenney (MFA ’12), costume designer and PhD candidate Graham McMonagle (MFA ’17) (costume designs shown left and right), and lighting designer and professor Patrick Du Wors (BFA ’02). Another PhD candidate, Nancy Curry, is the music supervisor and vocal coach, and two current fourth-year students are sound designer Eva Hocking and stage manager Emily Lindstrom. Indeed, The Drowsy Chaperone is the biggest song-and-dance show the Phoenix has presented in well over a decade: so much so that an entire set of dance shoes were needed for the 19-person cast!\n\n“The entire department has been anticipating this production since it was announced last spring,” says Department Chair Allana Lindgren. “Jacques has such an impressive history — from the Royal Winnipeg Ballet to the opening ceremonies of two Olympics and the Commonwealth Games — [so] we know are in good hands.”\n\nEight years before it was the five-time Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, The Drowsy Chaperone was a skit performed at a stag party for the marriage of two Toronto actors, Bob Martin and Janet Van De Graaff. If the names and the plot sound familiar, those names are still reflected in the characters of the soon-to-be-betrothed couple in this musical-within-a-play.\n\nBob Martin, the groom (the actor, not the character), enjoyed the performance so much, he joined the writing team of Don McKellar, Lisa Lambert, and Greg Morrison, creating the iconic central character of the Man in Chair which he performed himself (shown below right). The Drowsy Chaperone was then remounted for the Toronto Fringe Festival, winning rave reviews and attracting the support of Toronto über-producer, David Mirvish. Since then, it has been performed everywhere from Broadway to London’s West End, making toes tap and capturing the hearts of musical lovers around the world.\n\nJust reported this week in the Globe and Mail, Bob Martin is working on a sequel to The Drowsy Chaperone! “We have a very specific thing that we’re planning to do to follow up Drowsy,” says Martin, who was inspired after recently reprising the role of ultimate musical-theatre fan Man in Chair to host a revue in New York. “I think Man in Chair will be back, but it will probably be a different show.” Also in the works, Martin is working on musical version of The Princess Bride!\n\nAnd while the show is based on a fictional musical, the Broadway nostalgia parodied in The Drowsy Chaperone is very real, as Theatre historian Anthony Vickery will discuss at the free Preshow Lecture on Friday, November 9 (see events below).\n\nUltimately, the Phoenix production — complete with a custom-built propeller plane — will literally do, as the Man in Chair says, “what a musical is supposed to do: it takes you to another world.”\n\nPHOTOS: Photography for the Phoenix Theatre production of The Drowsy Chaperone is by Dean Kalyan with thanks.

Kathleen Greenfield is the Co-Artistic Director of SNAFU Dance Theatre, who directed Concord Floral this summer and also teaches at SKAM School of Performing Arts.

At PEEK-SHOW, Victoria performing artists present excerpts from new or developing works and each group is provided with only 7 minutes to present whatever art has been brewing in the back in their mind, itching to come out!\n\nThe Wonderheads, including co-founder and alumna Kate Braidwood (BFA ’03), is now offering workshops across the region to share their expert skills in physical theatre, mask-making, and performance. The Storytelling Body workshop on November 25 will be part of the Impulse Theatre's PEEK-FEST.\n\nAt the You Show at Intrepid Theatre, fourth-year student Megan Chandler presents Running From and To, from November 30 to December 1 about a Chinese immigrant who struggles to find acceptance in Canada as he faces new challenges in English and comes to terms with the life from which he ran away. Also at Intrepid, alumnus Charles Ross (BFA '98) presents a double-bill of his One-Man shows, including Lord of the Rings and the TV show, Stranger Things. Both shows are directed by TJ Dawe (BFA '97), and presented on December 13.\n\nOpening up in Kingston, Ontario, retired professor Dr. Jennifer Wise's version of Aristophanes' Birds has been produced at Queen's University's Dan School of Drama, running until November 17. Since retiring last year, Dr. Wise has seen several of her plays produced across the country. Sounds like a busy retirement!\n\n----\n\nWant more alumni stories?
