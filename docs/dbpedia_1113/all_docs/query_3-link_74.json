        "text": "By Lynn Venhaus\n\nFeaturing an indelible performance by Naima Randolph as the traumatized Catharine Holly in an impeccably staged “Suddenly Last Summer,” this year’s Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis’ centerpiece created a vivid atmospheric contemplation on mental health, homophobia, and the truth.\n\nThese topics often associated with the playwright are still thought-provoking in contemporary times, some 66 years after he wrote it in New York City and first presented off-Broadway in 1958 as a 90-minute one-act, double-billed with “Something Unspoken.”\n\nOne of Williams’ most haunting and lyrical works, “Suddenly Last Summer” is best known for the melodramatic 1959 movie starring three future legends –Elizabeth Taylor as Cathy and Katherine Hepburn as Violent Venable, both Oscar-nominated for their performances, and Montgomery Clift as Dr. “Sugar,” and those shadows loom large.\n\nThe screenplay, a Williams’ collaboration with Gore Vidal, differs from the play in opening it up to show scenes at the beach, and other scenes, characters, and subplots were added. This being through a ‘50s lens, they had to remove explicit references to homosexuality. It’s a different world today in terms of taboos, although people still use each other, and issues raised persist.\n\nHowever dated the material, director Tim Ocel doesn’t downplay the inferences. He is a master at interpreting Williams’ artistry, making it relatable for a modern audience.\n\nAlong with producer Carrie Houk, a master caster and the festival’s executive producer, he has put together a powerhouse ensemble, who brings to life many dark elements of human nature – including greed, deception, delusion, desire, desperation, and dominance.\n\nJust as he did in a stunning “A Streetcar Named Desire” in 2018 and meticulous “The Night of the Iguana” in 2019, both at The Grandel, Ocel’s retelling is fresh and visionary, emphasizing the horror of a tragic death that is framed like a fascinating murder mystery and gripping courtroom drama.\n\nOh, what a tangled web we find the Venable family in when they reinforce lies over truth. At the domineering matriarch’s mansion in the affluent Garden District of New Orleans in 1936, brain surgeon Dr. Cukrowicz, aka “Dr. Sugar,” is summoned there to review her niece’s case.\n\nThrough her wealth, the bitter Violet hopes to keep Cathy institutionalized and have a lobotomy performed, so that a scandalous family secret won’t be exposed. She has kept her in a private mental asylum since she returned from Europe.\n\nViolet’s cherished son, Sebastian, a closeted gay poet, has been brutally killed while on vacation in Spain, accompanied by his cousin instead of Mommie dearest. The circumstances are unclear, and no one believes Cathy’s horrific account. Locked away against her will, she has been further victimized by her treatment. Now, she can not only reveal the ugly truth but be spared more damage.\n\nRandolph is spellbinding as she recounts the details of a summer holiday at Cabeza de Lobo to those assembled, led by an always stellar Bradley Tejeda as Dr. Sugar, who skillfully guides the proceedings as he gently probes a vulnerable and broken Cathy.\n\nCathy knows she is being manipulated, and after being injected with a truth serum, weaves a riveting account of being a decoy to attract young boys for the predatory Sebastian’s exploitation. She was used just like they were, but instead of earning sympathy, she’s trying to be suppressed by everyone.\n\nDr. Sugar’s not entirely convinced Cathy is insane, but at stake is a large donation to his psychiatric research from Mrs. Venable.\n\nTejeda, brilliant as Tom in 2021’s outdoor “The Glass Menagerie” and comical as Alvaro in last year’s “The Rose Tattoo,” is cool and calm in a crisp white suit, fully aware of the evil in the Venable’s jungle-garden, where his interrogation takes place.\n\nLisa Tejero deftly commands the stage as the controlling Mama Bear who makes her late husband’s family feel small in her presence, ready to pounce on those she considers duplicitous and weak. She will do whatever it takes to preserve her son’s legacy, even if it is fiction.\n\nClad in black and using a cane as a scepter, Tejero displays cunning in all interactions, as well as impatience and aggravation when things don’t go her way. She also conveys selfishness, an appalling lack of civility as a socialite and less-than-gracious hostess.\n\nCathy’s mother and brother, Mrs. Holly and George, eager to not have anything interfere with the $100,000 inheritance bequeathed by Sebastian in his will, are trying not to act anxious, but their true colors emerge. Rengin Altay as the fretful in-law, and Harrison Farmer, as her ambitious son, comfortably service Williams’ script in these stock characters.\n\nIn other supporting roles are Bethany Barr as Violet’s accommodating assistant Miss Foxhill, and Ieshah Edwards as the not-so-compassionate Sister Felicity.\n\nOf course, Williams would name characters Venable and Felicity, as he mines his life for a sad exploration of horrible human behavior.\n\nThe production team has enhanced the Southern gothic moods, with captivating lighting design by Matthew McCarthy, evocative set design by James Wolk, and polished period costume design by Dottie Marshall Englis. Henry Palkes’ original music score, this third for TWSTL, adds so much texture to these productions.\n\nWhat is missing in Williams’ play is the protagonist, and it is up to the cast to flesh out Sebastian, and all his contradictions, through the filters of his mother and cousin. The actors conjure up graphic images through their ability to craft a portrait through language.\n\nMany of Williams’ tortured soul characters face moral dilemmas, either as prey or predator, to survive in an unforgiving world. Randolph’s unnerving portrait of a victim shatters the norms, which is what Williams so often does.\n\nWhile her performance leaves a lasting impression, that’s not the only memorable aspect. The nuance and craft have left their mark on this eighth annual festival, which continually surprises with new ways and different angles to Williams’ storytelling.\n\nThe Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis presents “Suddenly Last Summer” Sept. 7 – 17, with Thursday through Saturday performances at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday matinees at 3 p.m. in the Catherine B. Berges Theatre at COCA, University City.

The festival celebrates his influence and art through his enduring works and early writings.\n\nAlways a detailed retrospective with speakers, education components, readings, films, tours and more, the fest’s fresh looks have a way of bringing out further insights during its 10-day schedule.\n\nA bold and risky move, the exaggerated flourishes — while cinematic and reminiscent of Fellini fantasies — aren’t necessary to convey the heart of the matter, which is love in a time of chaos and the push-pull of grief, desire, and hope.\n\nWhile the amusing accoutrements add to the production’s overall uniqueness, Williams’ poetic flair remains at center stage.\n\nThe nimble ensemble slips into the colorful characters that are part of an Italian immigrant community on the Mississippi gulf coast.\n\nWilliams’ play, which premiered in Chicago in 1950, became his fourth New York produced piece in 1951 after “The Glass Menagerie,” “A Streetcar Named Desire” and “Summer and Smoke.” It is his only one to win a Tony Award for Best Play.\n\nWilliams adapted the three acts for the movie in 1955, perhaps best known as the vehicle for which Anna Magnani won an Academy Award. The film was nominated for eight Oscars, also winning for cinematography and art direction.\n\nMagnani, once described as the “volcanic earth mother of Italian cinema,” was a friend of the playwright. He wrote the part for her, considered her “the most explosive emotional actress of her generation.” But, thinking her English wasn’t up for the stage, she declined – and four years later, it was her first English language film role.\n\nThe earthy Serafina Delle Rose is an indelible heroine – suffering but not silent. Maureen Stapleton originated the role on Broadway, and Maria Tucci (1966), Mercedes Ruehl (1995) and Marisa Tomei (2019) played the tempestuous widow in subsequent revivals.\n\nUnder the Big Top, professional actress and academic Rayme Cornell commands the space as the fiery Sicilian seamstress.\n\nLet’s face it, as written, both she and love interest Alvaro could be construed as antiquated over-the-top ethnic stereotypes. Chalk it up to dated material from 70 years ago. So, she and Bradley J. Tejeda walk a tightrope in dialect delivery.\n\nSerafina is a complicated woman. Williams knows how to set up pain and passion, that’s for sure. Happily married to virile truck driver Rosario, Serafina discloses she is pregnant with her second child and that a rose tattoo appeared on her breast the night of conception, albeit temporary.\n\nWe never see Rosario but learn he ran black-market cargo for the mob underneath bananas and cheated with the delectably-named Estelle Hohengarten (Rachael Fox, on horseback). His life ends badly – shot, then his 10-ton truck crashes and bursts into flames.\n\nPlunged into mourning, miscarriage, and misery, Cornell glowers, wails, and rages. In a well-worn pink slip, she deteriorates as a bitter recluse, refusing to face reality. A shrine to the Blessed Virgin Mary gives her sustenance.\n\nYou can’t tell by intermission, but “The Rose Tattoo” is a departure from Williams’ signature dramas. Considered more light-hearted, it still has his emotional whiplash.\n\nDeep sorrow eventually yields to comedic interplay when a chance flirtatious encounter is life-changing.\n\nThat’s when the charming Tejeda swoops in as Alvaro Mangiacavallo, a buffoonish truck driver, and the play blossoms in his presence.\n\nTejeda, a New York-based actor and Yale School of Drama alum, has made his mark on local stages – first at St. Louis Shakespeare Festival in “Love’s Labour’s Lost” in 2019 and then the radio plays when the festival pivoted in 2020.\n\nLast year, he brought both a sweetness and restlessness to Tom Wingfield, an extraordinary performance in the triumphant production of “The Glass Menagerie” outside at the Central West End apartment where Williams once lived.\n\nAs Alvaro, he demonstrates his prowess in physical comedy, channeling Charlie Chaplin in looks and expressions, acrobatic in slapstick and darting around the set. It’s a splendid performance, injecting the play with a needed boost of vitality.\n\nHe easily won over the audience, especially when he joked that his last name Mangiacavallo means “eat a horse.”\n\n“It’s a comical name, I know. Maybe two thousand and seventy years ago one of my grandfathers got so hungry that he ate up a horse. That ain’t my fault,” he said, eliciting laughter.\n\nSerafina describes him as having a clown’s face on her late husband’s body. Even with their skilled performances, Cornell and Tejeda do not spark any sensuality.\n\nBut the young couple revealing an attraction that blooms into love does. Valentina Silva, memorable in Metro Theater Company’s “Last Stop on Market Street” last winter, plays Serafina’s smart, sheltered, and neglected 15-year-old daughter, Rosa Delle Rose, with youthful elan.\n\nStifled by her mother during the three years since her father’s accident, Rosa rebels, wanting to go out and have some fun. You feel her yearning for freedom, eager to take flight.\n\nShe is infatuated with a wholesome sailor, Jack Hunter, who was immediately smitten with the vivacious teen at a school dance. Oliver Bacus, who is quickly making a name for himself on local stages, seen last month in The Midnight Company’s seismic “Rodney’s Wife,” eloquently delivers Williams’ distinct dialogue.\n\nTheir innocent love story is a catalyst for Serafina to change, to let go, and that is illustrated by aerialists Annika Capellupo, Natalie Bednarski, Sage McGhee and Maggie McGinness of On the Fly Productions, with choreography by owner Jason Whicker. It is a lovely, graceful sight — but does this illuminate or distract?\n\nThe aerialists use satiny scarlet ribbons of fabric, which is the shade of a shirt Serafina is sewing, requested by her husband’s mistress to give her “wild like a gypsy” beau on their one-year anniversary, which is the last day he’s alive.\n\nSo much of Williams’ writing deals with symbols – consider the rose itself, with red buds a sign of romance, love, beauty, and courage. Here, it is a symbol of new beginnings too.\n\nUnderstanding Williams’ dreams and desires has always been part of the fest, and the focus on Italy explores how visiting the country, soon after his first wave of success, was restorative to his psyche.\n\nGiddy with fleeting joy and discovery of his new happy place, Williams dedicated his “love-play to the world” to his partner, Frank Merlo, an Italian American from New Jersey who served in the U.S. Navy during World War II: “To Frankie in Return for Sicily.” They met in 1948 in Provincetown, Mass., and spent 15 years together. Merlo died of lung cancer at age 43 in 1963 while Williams lived to age 71, passing in 1983.\n\nThe supporting cast captures the local flavor, and the quirky people he immortalized on paper.\n\nAssunta, Serafina’s friend with psychic abilities, is played by Carmen Garcia with an air of mystery. She senses that “something wild is in the air.” Holly Maffitt is the “Strega,” considered a traditional witch, because the fates are part of this narrative.\n\nTyler White, a lively presence whenever on The Black Rep’s stage, is delightful as part of the neighborhood’s gossipy hens, as is Julia Crump as perky busybody Bessie.\n\nHarry Weber is both teacher Miss Yorke and Father De Leo, the community’s strict moral gatekeeper.\n\nThe always fun to watch Mitchell Henry-Eagles enlivens the proceedings as an accordion-playing salesman and a doctor. Tony Viviano occasionally pops up to sing.\n\nThey serve as a Greek chorus of sorts, observing, moving in and out. Director David Kaplan likes to keep the players in motion, engaging the audience, and breaking the fourth wall.\n\nKaplan is well-versed in Williams’ aesthetic as one of the preeminent interpreters of his works. He is the curator and co-founder of the Provincetown Tennessee Williams Festival, now in its 17th year.\n\nSt. Louis experienced his perceptive vision in the dynamic “The Rooming House Plays,” four short plays he staged in the Stockton House, a local Victorian mansion, for the 2016 inaugural fest.\n\nWilliams’ works on longing and loss always move me more when we are in close quarters or exposed to a different canvas, so that I can feel the lyricism, make a specific connection. So, the cavernous Big Top was a challenge, but the cast’s immersion helped considerably.\n\nJames Wolk’s innovative set brought out an entirely new dimension, using multiple frames and shutters to stand in for doors and windows. The versatility punctuated the scenes, and the cast, adept at quick changes, did not lose a beat. Obviously, well-rehearsed, and efficient work by all.\n\nThe sound, however, had some issues Friday but was worked out. Designer Nick Hime engineered the sound and operated the board.\n\nJess Alford’s lighting design made use of dusky twilight in the early evening. Michele Friedman Siler’s thoughtful costume design differentiated the characters, and she effectively mixed textures.\n\nThis daring production has many moving parts, including four goats and a horse, which is difficult to pull off smoothly, and the esprit de corps is apparent. Stage Manager J.M. Bock and assistant stage manager J. Myles Hesse kept it flowing smoothly.\n\nWilliams was fascinated by the ebb and flow of time, which is a major component here. Between 1948 and 1959, he had seven plays produced on Broadway. This early one, however, is one of the few happy endings – because they found love in a hopeless place.\n\nThe Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis presents “The Rose Tattoo” Thursdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m. and Sundays at 3 p.m. through Aug. 28 at The Big Top in Grand Center, 3401 Washington Avenue. For more information and tickets, visit www.twstl.org, and for a complete schedule of events.\n\nThe schedule includes a free showing of “The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone,” based on Williams’ novel which he adapted for the screen in 1961, starring Vivien Leigh and Warren Beatty. It will take place at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 24, at St. Ambrose Church on the Hill, 5130 Wilson Avenue.\n\nA Bocce Tournament starts at noon on Saturday, Aug. 27, at the Italia-America Bocce Club, 2210 Marconi Avenue.\n\nLynn (Zipfel) Venhaus has had a continuous byline in St. Louis metro region publications since 1978.

Any time you can be joyfully swept up by the catchy hooks and upbeat sounds of the Four Seasons catalog is a good day.\n\nAlthough the music is the big draw, the personal stories of bandmates Frankie Valli, Nick Massi, Bob Gaudio and Tommy DeVito combine for the irresistible musical “Jersey Boys.” The four lads from New Jersey’s rough-and-tumble journey through the music business is a fascinating rags-to-riches story, the quintessential American Dream tale.\n\nIn its Stages St. Louis premiere, the Tony Award winner comes alive in the Kirkwood Performing Arts Center’s intimate staging in the Ross Family Theater. The show runs through Oct. 24.\n\nThis can’t-miss combination overflows with energy and charm – and 30 songs, including their chart-topping hits “Sherry” in 1962, “Big Girls Don’t Cry,” “Who Loves You” and their last number one from 1976, “December 1963: Oh! What a Night!” The group sold 175 million records.\n\nDirected with verve by Stages’ mainstay Michael Hamilton, with input from associate director Gayle Seay and assistant director Christopher Kale Jones, each number is vibrantly staged. Dana Lewis’ choreography is snappy and stylized.\n\nThe addition of live music at Stages, with the band perched atop of James Wolk’s grid set design, is a major plus. Music director Jeremy Jacobs kept up a peppy infectious beat with a tight band.\n\nWolk has efficiently used the space to set up different nooks conveying time and place, from recording studios to Las Vegas, with Sean M. Savoie’s savvy lighting choices expertly enhancing the designs, starting with streetlamps, and moving on to glitzy showbiz venues.\n\nAfter it opened on Broadway in 2005, the musical became a juggernaut, winning four Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Actor, Featured Actor and Lighting Design in 2006, and ran until 2017, with multiple resident companies in the U.S. and abroad, in addition to several national tours pleasing crowds for years.\n\n“Jersey Boys” is currently the 12th longest-running Broadway show (4,642 performances in 11 years).\n\nStages has assembled a very capable quartet of smooth operators who mesh as a group –singing actors Christopher Kale Jones, Brent Michael DiRoma, Jason Michael Evans and Ryan Jesse are funny, appealing, good singers whose harmonizing brings a strong dynamic to the show.\n\nJones, as indefatigable lead singer Frankie Valli, pours his heart and soul into the role, with a comfortable falsetto and a passionate delivery. His rendition of “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You,” one of the show’s biggest moments, will give you goosebumps. He played Frankie on the first national tour.\n\nJason Michael Evans is an amusing Nick Massi, the quirky bass player, and he pulls off the deadpan delivery and crisp comic timing required of the role. Brent Michael DiRoma, who was so strong as Jerry in Stages’ “The Full Monty,” brings out the complexities of the swaggering troublemaker guitarist Tommy DeVito. He also had national tour experience, but in other roles.\n\nThe songwriting talents and keyboard prowess of young musical genius Bob Gaudio is charismatically portrayed by Ryan Jesse, who performed the role on Broadway and on tour.\n\nStages’ ensemble adroitly fills in the supporting roles: Edward Juvier is Bob Crewe and others, while Dereis Lambert, Jenna Coker-Jones, Nic Thompson, Brady Miller, Sarah Ellis, Donna Louden, Steve Isom, John Flack, Dena Digiacinto, Trevor James Berger, and Erik Keiser fluidly move the story along. The entire production has a close-knit feel.\n\nThey journey through backstage drama, in-fighting, inside show-business wheeling and dealing, and unsavory parts of personal and professional relationships.\n\nClever book writers Rick Elice and Oscar-winning screenwriter Marshall Brickman presented different points of view and broke the Fourth Wall, where characters talk directly to the audience. It’s a masterful touch.\n\nThe vintage outfits from several decades are crafted with flair by resident costume designer Brad Musgrove, who knows how to go way back into the time machine of early rock ‘n roll and sharply dress performers.\n\nBecause it resonates so well, “Jersey Boys” remains a blissful experience, a delightful jukebox musical with a smartly constructed book that features humor and heartache – not to mention it’s based on a remarkable true story. And those songs!\n\nIt was thrilling to be back together in a theater where you could feel the electric jolt on stage – and in the audience. I’ve seen this show, I think, seven times, and it is always a home run. Performers may be better than others, but such pizzazz.

DeGarmo emulates Cline’s richly textured, emotive voice, and effortlessly delivers 27 numbers, including five with Vonder Haar, who plays Cline’s fan-turned-friend, Louise Seger.\n\nDeGarmo, who was the runner-up on Season 3 of “American Idol” at age 16 in 2004, which Fantasia Barrino, 19, won (a total of 65 million votes were cast for both), has since pursued a music and musical theatre career, appearing on Broadway and in national tours.\n\nPreviously in St. Louis, she was impressive as Doralee Rhodes in the first national tour of “9 to 5: The Musical,” which stopped at the Fox Theatre in February 2011, and also at the Fox in 2014 as the Narrator in the revival tour of “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.” Her husband, Ace Young, was Joseph. (She met Young, who was on American Idol’s fifth season, when they were cast in “Hair” and have been married since 2013).\n\nShe is poised and commanding as she interprets one hit song after another, showcasing her range and control. The vocals on the ballads “Crazy,” “I Fall to Pieces” and “Sweet Dreams” are particularly lush, tugging on your heart strings.\n\nShe has fun changing tempos with the more down-home numbers, such as “Stupid Cupid” and “Shake Rattle and Roll.”\n\nDeGarmo projects an elegance, which is enhanced by Brad Musgrove’s gorgeous vintage costume designs, and she is exquisitely lit by lighting designer Sean M. Savoie.\n\nShe has a dynamic chemistry with feisty firecracker Vonder Haar, the veteran fan favorite who has played Louise twice before. Vonder Haar won the St. Louis Theater Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical for the first time (and would go on to win that same award for Stages’ “The Full Monty” two years later).\n\nIt’s a good match. Seger, a colorful Texas housewife, was a devoted fan who first saw Patsy on “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts” in 1957, when she won after singing “Walkin’ After Midnight.” Living near Houston, she attended the singer’s show at the Esquire Ballroom in 1961, and they connected as friends, writing letters and talking on the phone until the singer’s tragic death at age 30 in a plane crash in 1963.\n\nPlaywright Ted Swindley fashioned the interviews Seger did for the biographies “Patsy Cline: An Intimate Biography” and “Honky Tonk Angel: The Intimate Story of Patsy Cline” into the source material for his 1988 two-woman tribute revue, “Always…Patsy Cline,” which is the epitome of a crowd-pleaser. It is licensed by Cline’s family and estate.\n\nFrom Seger in “Country Weekly”: “The person inside me recognized the person who lived inside her. It was truly eerie.”\n\nPatsy joined Louise and her friends and after the show accepted an invitation to Louise’s home for a late-night breakfast. “It was like I was living in a dream. There was Patsy Cline in my kitchen helping me fix bacon and eggs. She took her shoes off and wore an apron I gave her.\n\n“She told me about her life, her hopes, her dreams. We discussed loves lost, loves found, loves yet to be.\n\n“We talked about her troubled marriage and the pain she endured being away from her children. It was just two people baring their souls.\n\n“We both sang and harmonized old Gospel songs and hillbilly tunes. We sat there and smoked and sang until 4:00 in the morning.”\n\nLouise rushed Patsy to the airport, expecting never to hear from her again. But within two weeks, Louise received her first in what was to be many letters and phone calls they would exchange.\n\n“I often would receive calls at 1:00 in the morning. She’d be singing in some town wanting a friend to talk to.”\n\nOf course, this was 60 years ago, before entertainers had security, a ‘team’ and ‘people.’ It was just two women bonding at a kitchen table.\n\nWhile Swindley took some poetic license, the story is true – a glamorous celebrity who grew up without privilege and her plain-spoken, music-lovin’ pal.\n\nFrom the moment she sashays on to scenic designer James Wolk’s vintage 1950s-era kitchen set, Vonder Haar, a St. Louis treasure, is a funny and sincere Louise. She engages the audience as comic relief with her folksy charm, coming across like a neighbor joining you for a kaffee klatch.\n\nThis memoir, which opens the theater company’s 35th anniversary year, is the most popular show in Stages’ history. This is the third time it’s being presented, after back-to-back runs in 2013 and 2014, which demonstrates again how endearing and charming it is. It was as warmly received Aug. 11 as it was seven and eight years ago.\n\nThe cozy show, first at Stages’ former home at Kirkwood’s Community Center, then moved intact to The Playhouse at Westport Plaza, is opening their new venue, the Kirkwood Center for the Performing Arts. The Ross Family Theatre seats 529 comfortably.\n\nArtistic Director Michael Hamilton has recreated the production, capitalizing on the actress’s strengths. The premise is simple – showing Cline singing at the Grand Old Opry and other locations, with Louise listening to her on the radio, which was a communication lifeline for people back then.\n\nA simpler time, a touch of nostalgia, admiration for a career cut way too short, but spotlighting music that continues to warm hearts to this day.\n\nThe lively band, conducted by music director Jeremy Jacobs, who also plays the piano, is an expert blend of Steve Hitsman on steel pedal guitar, Dave Black on electric and acoustic guitars, Kevin Buckley on acoustic guitar and fiddle, Eric Grossman on bass and Joe Meyer on drums. Their tight sound is mighty in an alcove perched behind a scrim.\n\nOriginal orchestrations for the band and vocals were crafted by August Eriksmoen and Tony Migliore.\n\nWhile the songs take center stage, the fascinating tale of a close friendship between kindred spirits is what resonates, drawing an audience in, one who welcomes the warm embrace of harmony in music and life.\n\nStages St. Louis presents “Always…Patsy Cline” through Sept. 5, performance times vary, at the Ross Family Theatre inside the Kirkwood Performing Arts Center at 210 Monroe St. ASL interpreting and audio description by MindsEye will be available for the Aug. 20 show.

(And eager audiences are\n\nready).\n\nIntegrated with the snazzy dance numbers choreographed by Tony Gonzalez, and\n\ncostumes to match, they capture the look and sound of a bygone era — but also\n\na universal feeling.\n\nAnd certainly not that we were all the cool kids. Far from\n\nit.\n\nBy now, the worldwide smash hit is as familiar as your\n\nsenior year in high school. So why do people return over and over to watch high\n\nschool shenanigans?\n\nPhoto by ProPhotoSTL“Alone at the Drive-In Movie,” “Beauty School Dropout,” “Those\n\nMagic Feelings” and “It’s Raining on Prom Night” touch on all the fretting that\n\ncomes with being a teen, no matter what generation.\n\nMaybe it’s that sense of trying to fit in, to belong. That\n\nunderneath that tough T-Birds exterior are guys desperate to figure it out —\n\nmasking those insecurities (on display so well in James Dean’s “Rebel Without a\n\nCause”). And the Pink Ladies really wanting to be Gidget, but not letting on\n\nthey are afraid they don’t measure up.\n\nOn the surface, it is all fun times, that sweet flush of\n\nyouth during a more innocent time – but dealing with grown-up issues AND\n\nhormones.\n\n“Greaser” Danny Zuko (Sam Harvey) fancies “good girl” Sandy Dumbrowski (Summerisa Bell Stevens) one summer, and lo and behold, she transfers to his public high school, not the Catholic one. Whoa. Kind Frenchy (Lucy Moon) invites Sandy to hang out with the Pink Ladies, but rough-and-tough Rizzo (Morgan Cowling) is not nice to the new girl. Rizzo has her own issues with boyfriend Kenickie (Jesse Corbin), but school isn’t a high priority with anyone except Patty Simcox (Aisling Halpin) and nerd Eugene (Brad Frenette). “Grease” is a cultural phenomenon nearly 50 years old — and has been revised multiple times, with the most significant changes made in the 1978 movie, then adopted for a 1993 London stage version, which incorporated four chart-topping songs from the movie written by Barry Alan Gibb, John Farrar, Louis St. Louis and Scott Simon. This is the version Stages has the rights to, and it makes a difference.\n\nYou would not much recognize the original 1971 stage version,\n\nwhich has been sanitized from Jim Jacobs’ and Warren Casey’s initial effort\n\nabout working-class high schoolers in a Polish part of Chicago, based on\n\nJacobs’ alma mater in Cicero.\n\nPhoto by ProPhotoSTLThe duck-tailed, hot-rodding Class of 1959 of Rydell High\n\nresembled those ruffians, and the gum-snapping and hip-shaking Pink Ladies were\n\na combination of bad and mean girls. The raunchier version has been toned down,\n\nbut there are still the themes of peer pressure, teen pregnancy, gangs, class\n\nconflict, and good old garden-variety teen rebellion.\n\nThis cast, with a few who have been out of high school for some time, seem to\n\ngel well. They sure can shake, rattle and roll in their musical numbers, and\n\nexaggerate their characters for comic effect. Their school and home scenes,\n\nunder Michael Hamilton’s smooth direction, delve deeper into social\n\ninteraction, with different conversations and motives at play.\n\nWhile it’s obvious the cast is older, “Grease” isn’t a\n\nproduction that hinges on authenticity. Just go with the fantasy.\n\n(After all, back in my day, most of these people would have\n\nbeen considered juvenile delinquents, not people to emulate. And changing into\n\na sexy siren to get a guy? Oh dear. When would that fly today?)\n\n“Grease” did not become a massive hit because everyone’s enamored with\n\nhooligans. The modest musical parodying the 1950s had an eight-year run on\n\nBroadway and two popular revivals in 1994 and 2007, plus the movie is the no. 1\n\nmovie musical of all-time, not to mention all the productions in schools,\n\nregional and community theater.\n\nPeople can identify with awkward adolescence and ‘types’ – if you don’t\n\nrecognize yourself, you know others who do. The supporting cast is appealing,\n\nparticularly Patrick Mobley as shy Doody, eager to be a chick magnet with his\n\nguitar, and merry Brooke Shapiro as Jan, desperate to have a beau.\n\nPhoto by ProPhotoSTL\n\nMoon is terrific as Frenchy, and “Beauty School Dropout” is\n\none of this show’s highlights, in staging, choreography and costumes. Showing\n\noff her powerful pipes, Kendra Lynn Lucas is a showstopper as the Teen Angel.\n\nShe also doubles as Miss Lynch, but in a rather confusing development is flirty\n\nwith students.\n\nSteve Isom evokes those early rock ‘n roll disc jockeys in\n\nhis on-air patter and hosting dance contest duties as Vince Fontaine.\n\nJulia Johanos is admirable as a stylish Marty, who acts worldly\n\nolder on purpose, while Collin O’Connor is amusing as Roger of ‘Mooning” fame.\n\nFrankie Thams tries to be a rowdy Sonny.\n\nSummerisa Bell Stevens is a radiant Sandy, and after\n\nimpressive turns as Sophie in “Mamma Mia” and Doralee in “9 to 5,” she\n\ndemonstrates her vocal talents once again. She is at her best with “Hopelessly\n\nDevoted to You.”\n\nI didn’t feel the pairings of Danny and Sandy and of Kenickie and Rizzo were\n\nall that convincing, but their singing and dancing skills were dandy. Harvey\n\ndid a nice job with the ballad “Sandy,” and as much as Rizzo’s mean-spirited\n\n“Look at Me, I’m Sandra Dee” annoys me, her “There Are Worse Things I Can Do”\n\nwas fine.\n\nThe rest of the energetic ensemble includes Bryan Purvis as Peggy-Sue, Madison Tinder as Doreen, Matthew Weidenbener as Frankie, Erik Keiser as Junior, Zach Trimmer as Johnny Casino and Tiger Brown as that fleet-footed Cha-Cha Di Gregorio. Lisa Campbell Albert did her usual stellar job as musical director, with orchestral arrangements by Stuart M. Elmore.\n\nThe cast certainly looks the part in their stunning vintage\n\noutfits, tailored to perfection by resident costume designer Brad Musgrove and\n\nhis crew. His choice of fabrics is spot-on and he has created looks that could\n\nbe straight out of the movies “Pillow Talk” and “A Summer Place,” or McCall’s\n\nmagazine, complete with bobby sox and saddle shoes.\n\nScenic Designer James Wolk makes interesting use of the\n\nspace with two staircases so that transitions are smooth, and he has built a\n\ncar – a red convertible that serves its purpose. He had me at hi-fi and 45s. Sean\n\nM. Savoie’s lighting design enhances it beautifully.\n\nThis “Grease” does what it’s supposed to do – present a time, a place and a feeling, and as a bonus, has the groove and meaning audiences want.\n\nStages St. Louis presents “Grease” through Aug. 18.

You can’t\n\nget much higher on the Cute Meter.\n\nEver since Walt Disney snapped up Dodie Smith’s 1956 novel\n\nand turned it into an adorable animated feature released in 1961, which became\n\nthe highest-grossing film that year, we’ve been smitten with spots. Author Smith\n\nused her own dog’s 15-pup litter as the basis for a family-friendly heist tale,\n\nthen Disney’s animators visually amped up one of the all-time great cartoon\n\nvillains, Cruella de Vil. She’s just as memorable in this live-action edition.\n\nPhoto by Peter WochniakIn a two-tone hair wig, Tyler Jent plays up the exaggerated\n\nmannerisms of Cruella as she tries to buy the puppies, but owners Roger and\n\nAnita turn her down. Little do they realize that she wants their pelts for an\n\nelaborate fur coat and has collected 86 other Dalmatians.\n\nCruella hatches a diabolical plot to steal the pups by using their favorite\n\ntreat, Kanine Krunchies, to lure them away. With his comically expressive face accented\n\nwith bold makeup, Jent is deliciously dastardly in musical numbers “Cruella’s\n\nScheme,” “The Fur Vault” and “My Beautiful Coat.”\n\nShe is accompanied by bumbling henchmen Jasper (Ryan Cooper)\n\nand Horace (Joshua Roach), who are goofy sight gags on their own. They demonstrate\n\ntheir slapstick skills as they botch the job and succumb to defeat after “The\n\nChase.”\n\nPhoto by Peter WochniakThe dog network helps– as does a few other furry critters –\n\nusing the “Twilight Bark.” With the help of the savvy “Dogs of London – Boxers\n\n(Carson Davis, Caden Michael Self), Poodles (Trenay Labelle, Anna Wright),\n\nScotties and Chihuahuas (Laura Ernst and Mitchell Holsclaw) — they nab the\n\nburglars, returning the pups to Roger and Anita, and their parents Pongo and Perdita.\n\nLight-hearted Eric Michael Parker and Larissa White are lovely\n\nas the couple while Drew Humphrey and Dena DiGiacinto are lively as the proud\n\nparental pooches.\n\nImmensely likeable pairs, they lead the upbeat group\n\nnumbers, with peppy music direction by Tali Allen. That catchy “Cruella de Vil”\n\nwill again be stuck in your head. Their fine voices blend in sweet harmony and\n\ncaptivate the audience, young and old, as they encourage interaction.\n\nLaura Ernst plays the kind Nanny besides donning doggie\n\ncostumes, with Jacob Flekier as Sergeant Tibbs and Mitchell Holsclaw doubles as\n\na police officer.\n\nIn addition to professional actors, twelve students from\n\nStages Performing Arts Academy are included in the cast as puppies. Among the\n\nhouse brood are Thomas Woodrow as Pepper, Luke Swaller as Patch, Hallie Fisher\n\nas Penny, Aaron (AJ) Bentley as Spot and Sophie Gorgen as Dot, with Arden\n\nDickson and Dan Wolfe.\n\nDirector Peggy Taphorn has kept the show breezy and choreographed\n\nthe dances to be appealing and fun, starting out with a “Dalmatian Conga” and\n\nwrapping it up with “Dalmatian Plantation” before the finale.\n\nWith the same attention to detail that they put into the\n\nmainstage productions, Stages’ crackerjack creative team has crafted a charming\n\nand delightful show suitable for youngsters and just as enjoyable for the\n\nadults who accompany them.\n\nVisually, scenic designer James Wolk has drawn warm and\n\nwhimsical rooms in a storybook way, and the smaller set neatly fits inside the current\n\nmainstage show, with “The Boy from Oz” light grid framing the stage. Sean M.\n\nSavoie’s lighting design takes advantage of the bright color scheme.\n\nSnazzy outfits were designed with flair by resident costume designer Brad Musgrove, and every familiar character is immediately identifiable. With his penchant for glittery over-the-top garments, he has a ball with Cruella’s flamboyant ruby-and-fur (fake) diva attire.\n\nEach puppy, covered in black-and-white print, is distinct to bring out their personality, whether it’s a hat or a piece of their ensemble that helps them stand out. A bow tie! A propeller cap! Those darling little tails!\n\nThis short-and-sweet affair is a jolly good time in old\n\nLondon town, and you’ll be enchanted with puppy power – and the expert human\n\nperformers who bring this entertaining musical to merry life.\n\nPhoto by Peter WochniakStages St. Louis presents Disney’s “101\n\nDalmatians”as the Emerson Family Theatre Series from June 18 to June 30 at the\n\nRobert G.

Allen died of AIDS-related throat cancer in 1992; he\n\nwas 48.\n\nYou may not recognize the name, but you have heard Allen’s\n\nsongs, and this show reminds us of his catchy pop hits and power ballads, which\n\nhe often wrote for other artists (Olivia Newton-John, Melissa Manchester, Rita\n\nCoolidge).\n\nThe Stages production is the Midwest premiere of this rarely\n\nproduced musical, although Hugh Jackman won a Tony in 2004 for Leading Actor in\n\na Musical in the first Australian production ever mounted on Broadway.\n\nBorn in a small bush town, Aussie Allen became one of the greatest showmen of the 1970s and ‘80s, and in the title role, David Elder makes him unforgettable. With his charming smile and boundless energy, Elder glides into the role with ease – singing and dancing with oodles of pizzazz, from tender love songs to the era’s disco beats.\n\nElder’s bravura performance is a stunning display of sass, class and Energizer Bunny motion. Winning over the crowd from his first appearance as the adult Peter, he dynamically captures the life force that Allen was, daring to say: ‘I am who I am, and you can’t ignore or stop me.’ It’s one of the most muscular and joyous lead performances of the year.\n\nAs Allen’s fame grew, he was a regular on the talk show\n\ncircuit, brightening up those couches, often wearing his trademark Hawaiian\n\nshirts. I recall how genuine he seemed as an entertainer, although extremely\n\nflamboyant – he clearly loved the glamour of showbiz, opened at Carnegie Hall,\n\ndanced with the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall and sang on the Academy\n\nAwards.\n\nThis musical, with a snappy book by Martin Sherman and Nick\n\nEnright, emphasizes his life as tailor-made rags-to-riches name-in-lights legend.\n\nThe cheeky wit is endearing as Elder narrates Allen’s first-person story.\n\nTo chronicle his life, original producers Ben Gannon and Robert\n\nFox used Allen’s own music and lyrics: “Best That You Can Do” (1981 Oscar\n\nwinning song known as “Arthur’s Theme” co-written with Burt Bacharach, Carole\n\nBayer Sager and Christopher Cross), “I’d Rather Leave While I’m in Love,”\n\n“Everything Old is New Again,” “Love Don’t Need a Reason,” “I Honestly Love\n\nYou” and “Don’t Cry Out Loud” among them.\n\nCorinne Melancon and David Elder. Photo by Peter Wochniak“Not the Boy Next Door” turns out to be a fun number between\n\nmother and son. Reliable veteran Corinne Melancon, who seemingly can play any\n\nkind of role, from the pious Mother Superior in “Sister Act” to strong-willed\n\nsingle mother Donna Sheridan in “Mamma Mia!” during her frequent summers at\n\nStages, provides affection and pride as Peter’s mother Marion Woolnough, strong\n\nin voice and characterization.\n\nAnd it’s not just Elder who is sensational, but two debuts are noteworthy. While his Allen interpretation is a slow build – I mean, he doesn’t start at 11, Michele Ragusa is an astonishing Judy Garland, feisty right out of the gate, quickly becoming a patron favorite and stealing the show with her well-timed quips, mannerisms and powerful vocals. Garland’s husband, Mark Herron, discovered Allen in of all places, Hong Kong.\n\nRagusa soars in “All I Wanted Was the Dream” and “Don’t\n\nWish Too Hard,” and the moving “Quiet Please, There’s a Lady on Stage” with\n\nElder.\n\nGarland’s daughter and his future wife, Liza Minnelli, is played with panache by Caitlyn Caughell. She assumed the role after Sarah Ellis (St. Louis Theater Circle nominee as Laurie in “Oklahoma!”) was injured and needed surgery.\n\nShe portrays the right mix of bravado and vulnerability as Liza embarks on her own celebrated career, shows her mettle in “Come Save Me” and “She Loves to Hear the Music” with the ensemble. The couple, who divorced after seven years of marriage, remained friends for life, and Elder and Caughell convey that bond.\n\nMichele Ragusa as Judy GarlandZach Trimmer portrays Peter’s longtime love, Texas model\n\nGreg Connell, who died of an AIDS-related illness in 1984. He’s not a warm and\n\nfuzzy character, so their relationship appears to have some holes in the\n\nretelling. The pair share two affecting duets, “If You Were Wondering” and “Love\n\nDon’t Need a Reason.”\n\nTwo boys, Ben Iken and Simon Desilets, alternate playing an\n\neager young Peter, who just wants to entertain, singing and dancing for small\n\nchange. Versatile mainstage mainstay Erik Keiser excels as Peter’s first\n\nsinging partner, Chris Bell, in their “brother act,” first appearing on\n\nAustralian Bandstand as The Allen Brothers. They would have a successful\n\ntouring cabaret act and appear on TV.\n\nAs is customary at Stages, Steve Isom plays several roles,\n\nfrom Peter’s abusive alcoholic dad Dick Woolnough to his brusque manager Dee\n\nAnthony.\n\nThe ensemble is as energetic and enthusiastic as Elder is,\n\nand their showstopping grand finale, the 1976 salsa-flavored disco hit, “I Go\n\nto Rio,” is a rousing number in which dancers make quite an entrance in Brad\n\nMusgrove’s elaborate sequined costumes. Musgrove, who never met a sequin he\n\ndidn’t like, outdoes the Follies here in spectacular shiny silver-and-white outfits.\n\nThe costumes received their own applause, as did Dana Lewis’ robust choreography.\n\nJames Wolk’s scenic design is straightforward, allowing the\n\nmusic numbers to be the focus, and there is a lovely nighttime New York skyline\n\nthrough an apartment picture window. Sean M. Savoie’s brightly colored lighting\n\ndesign complements Wolk’s set beautifully.\n\nDirector Michael Hamilton emphasizes the vivacious side of Peter while not forgetting the sorrow. He crisply stages the Judy-Peter-Mark-Chris number “Only an Older Woman” with as much oomph as he does with the exuberant ensemble numbers “Sure Thing Baby” at the Copacabana and “When I Get My Name in Lights.” Stuart Elmore’s orchestrations work well, while music director Lisa Campbell Albert varies the tempo to suit each singer.\n\n“Caught between the moon and New York City” will always\n\ndefine Allen for me. It’s just one of those phrases that you’ll always remember\n\nwith a smile, especially if you have fallen in love with the city like he did. And\n\nhe’s impossible to forget after seeing his story, “The Boy from Oz.”\n\nDavid Elder and Ben Iken as old and young Peter AllenStages St. Louis presents “The Boy from Oz” May\n\n31-June 30 at the Robert G.

Their colorful collaboration burns bright with vivid characterizations.\n\nThe ensemble’s good cheer emanates. Based on Lynn Riggs’ 1931 play, “Green Grow the Lilacs,” the first book musical by Oscar Hammerstein II and Richard Rodgers focuses on romantic conflicts — between Laurey and her two suitors, Curly and Jud, and Ado Annie and two men she’s drawn to Ali Hakim and Will Parker.\n\nSet on the Oklahoma territory in 1906, the musical reflects both its innocent time and the rugged pioneer spirit, the hands that built America. Director Michael Hamilton conveys a strong sense of community throughout, and the cast does its part, creating dynamic interactions in a small prairie town.\n\nThe cast infuses the old-fashioned characters with plenty of personality, making them appealing to a modern audience. The characters don’t remotely resemble any contemporary archetypes, so they remain quaint caricatures, and the ensemble plays them broadly.\n\nBlake Price, Sarah Ellis and Zoe Vonder Haar in “Oklahoma!”As Curly and Laurey, Blake Price and Sarah Ellis have a playful chemistry together as they tussle, clearly meant for each other, and their vocal ease is a high point of the show.\n\nPrice sets the tone with “Oh What a Beautiful Morning” and is a convincing charmer in “The Surrey with the Fringe on Top.” Their “People Will Say We’re in Love” is a superb rendition as they project yearning.\n\nEllis showcases a satiny soprano, outstanding on “Out of My Dreams” with the girls, and flawless both “People Will Say We’re in Love” and reprise.\n\nBut then there’s hired hand Jud (versatile David Sajewich), whose undercurrent of menace has some others on edge. Today, he’s viewed as a tragic figure who boils over in frustration and anger, misunderstood. You do feel sympathy for Jud, especially when Sajewich sings “Lonely Room.”\n\nSparks fly with the comical love triangle between lively Ado Annie, cowboy Will Parker and peddler Ali Hakim, who play their characters strictly for laughs.\n\nCon O’Shea-Creal, with a winning smile and jaunty demeanor as Will, is convivial in “Kansas City,” an ebullient dance number unleashing rodeo spirit!\n\nNewcomer Lucy Moon is the spunky boy-crazy lass Ado Annie and animated Matthew Curiano, with crackerjack comic timing, had the crowd on his side as the charming peddler stuck in the middle.\n\nZoe Vonder Haar, who has been part of Stages St. Louis for 31 of its 32 years, crackles as Aunt Eller. Her spunky delivery is another bright spot.\n\nStages’ veterans Leah Berry stood out as Gertie Cummings, with her distinctive laughter, while John Flack as crusty Andrew Carnes and Steve Isom as the lawman Cord Elam capably crafted lived-in characters. In Flack’s case, his shotgun-daddy character is a real “character” – he was straight out of Yosemite Sam’s playbook.\n\nWith their first collaboration, the legendary songwriting duo of Rodgers and Hammerstein set the gold standard with their innovations in 1943, seamlessly integrating music, dance, drama and comedy. They changed musical history and won a special Pulitzer Prize for their efforts.\n\nThe music effortlessly flows, and each number is crisply delivered and smooth as corn silk. Stuart M. Elmore handled the orchestral design while Lisa Campbell Albert oversaw the music direction.\n\nThe robust rendition of the title song brings out the community pride at being settlers in this new land. Since I learned it in fourth grade music class, it has always been one of my favorites, especially with the exquisite harmony and the modulated delivery.\n\nAgnes DeMille’s landmark original choreography is honored by choreographer Dana Lewis. While the Dream Ballet is a beautiful component of this show, it’s a wee bit jarring when the Dancing Curly is a different guy – primo ballet dancer Nicholas De La Vega (who stood out in The Muny’s “Jerome Robbins’ Broadway” this summer) when Dancing Laurey is ballet-trained Ellis. Effortless nonetheless.\n\nWith the cast’s vitality shining through, the dance sequences fit the stage well. Costume designer Brad Musgrove has made eye-popping homespun costumes that stand out too.\n\nThe intimate staging at the Robert G. Reim Theatre works well for the large ensemble. Scenic Designer James Wolk’s work is stunning. His scrim and set evoked early American paintings and breathtaking vistas of what motivated pioneers to embark on an adventure. Sean Savoie’s exquisite lighting design accented every scene beautifully.\n\nSteeped in Americana, this vigorous “Oklahoma!” honors our country’s love of the land, and our hard-working ancestors who believed in the American Dream and most definitely, the pursuit of happiness.\n\nWhat a fitting way to end Stages’ 32nd season.\n\nPhotos by Tom Sakiyama\n\nLynn (Zipfel) Venhaus has had a continuous byline in St. Louis metro region publications since 1978.
