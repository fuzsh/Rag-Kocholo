        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nStanding outside the restaurant Angus McIndoe, around the corner from the Marquis Theater, where he's currently starring in the Broadway production of \"The Drowsy Chaperone,\" the actor and writer Bob Martin was only barely recognizable from his performance the night before in the role known as Man in Chair.\n\nA small part of the discrepancy was cosmetic: playing an aging, lonely musical theater buff, Mr. Martin's curly strawberry blond hair is unkempt and wild and he wears an unflattering long wool cardigan; off stage his locks were somewhat tamed, and he was dressed in a crisp striped shirt. But it was the difference in bearing that was most striking. Mr. Martin seemed inches taller than his character, and certainly sunnier. Even so, Mr. Martin, like his character, stooped just a bit. For Man in Chair, the stoop is a signal of a certain cringing shyness, while for Mr. Martin it seemed almost a gesture of politeness to those around him who might not be so tall.\n\nGenerally speaking, for someone in the unusually ego-gratifying position of being both star and co-author of an original Broadway play, Mr. Martin, a Canadian born in England, seems beset by an almost absurd amount of humility about his place among the New York actors and producers involved with the show. \"I thought I'd feel like an interloper,\" he said, once seated at the restaurant. \"But people haven't been condescending -- they've been really respectful, and I'm really happy about that.\"\n\nOf all the ways stars have made it to Broadway -- via, say, the Dolly Dingle Midwestern dance studios, or with the benefit of a family with long lineage in the theater -- Mr. Martin's route has surely been one of the more unconventional. A former creative director of the Toronto branch of the live comedy troupe Second City, Mr. Martin, 43, was a well-established performer in that city's sketch-comedy scene before he started writing for Canadian television, helping to create, among other programs, \"Slings and Arrows,\" a popular show about the backstage dramas of a Shakespearean theater company that has also been shown in the United States on the Sundance Channel.\n\nMr. Martin was practically the only one of his close friends from the Toronto performing scene who wasn't involved in the first production of \"The Drowsy Chaperone,\" which was originally performed as a gift for him and the comedian Janet Van De Graaff at a party in 1998 honoring their coming marriage. At the outset, the play was merely a loose homage to the goofy Marx Brothers revues, which Mr. Martin loved, as well as the zany 20's-era musicals dear to Lisa Lambert, the production's lyricist (and high school friend of Mr. Martin).\n\nMr. Martin and Ms. Lambert, as well as another high school friend, the filmmaker Don McKellar, and the musician Greg Morrison, decided to produce the show for the 1999 Toronto Fringe Festival. They added a role for Mr. Martin that would provide a framing device for the show: Man in Chair, an obsessive fan of old musicals who imagines performers coming to life in his shabby apartment whenever he plays one of his favorite cast recordings (in this case a fictional one), \"The Drowsy Chaperone.\" Mr. McKellar said, \"We knew the general public would be baffled if they saw this show without someone sort of saying, 'You're allowed to laugh.' \"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
