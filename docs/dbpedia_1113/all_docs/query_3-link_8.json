        "text": "It's enough to make you drowsy for real. The Drowsy Chaperone, the Canadian-penned \"musical within a comedy,\" received 13 Tony Award nominations yesterday, the most for any production this season, and one for every category for which it's eligible. This valentine to 1920s American musicals was nominated for best musical; best performance by a leading actor for Bob Martin; best original score for Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison; and best book of a musical for Martin and Don McKellar. The show started life in Toronto in 1998 as a wedding present for Martin and is the first musical by a Canadian creative team to make it to Broadway in 25 years.\n\nOther Drowsy nominations include best performance by a leading actress in a musical for Sutton Foster; best featured actress and actor in a musical for Beth Leavel and Danny Burstein, respectively, while Casey Nicholaw picked up nods for best direction and choreography. It was also nominated for best orchestrations as well as best scenic, costume, and lighting designs for a musical.\n\n\"It's definitely an unprecedented day in my life,\" said Martin yesterday, on the phone from his New York apartment. The Tony nominee found out the news by logging on to the Tony Awards website yesterday. His first actions were to kiss his wife, Janet Van De Graaff, and call Nicholaw, his director. \"He was such a great collaborator throughout the process. I can't thank him enough.\"\n\nDrowsy received two more nominations than its closest rival for top honours, The Color Purple, co-produced by Oprah Winfrey, which came in second with 11 nods, including one for best musical. The two other nominated entries in the best musical category are Jersey Boys, about sixties pop idols Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, which received eight, and the musical version of the eighties-themed Adam Sandler movie The Wedding Singer, which garnered five.\n\nThe Elton John musical Lestat and Phil Collins's Disney-produced Tarzan were shut out of the best musical nominations. Lestat received two nods for best performance by a featured actress and for costumes, while Tarzan's only recognition came in the lighting design category. A revival of The Pajama Game, starring Harry Connick Jr., received nine nominations, including one for the jazz crooner. Julia Roberts, who is currently starring in Broadway's hottest ticket, a revival of Richard Greenberg's play Three Days of Rain, failed to get a nomination.\n\nThe race for the best musical Tony -- the only category that has a measurable impact on a show's box office on Broadway as well as raising the profile of any future national tour -- is not so much tight this year as it is unpredictable.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone has been dubbed the \"sleeper hit\" of the season by Broadway watchers -- a euphemism for the musical with the least \"product\" recognition value. Yet, it's by far the most clever and most original of the nominated shows. Drowsy could indeed replicate the upset win of another audience favourite, Avenue Q, which snatched the award from the shoo-in Wicked in 2004.\n\nEven if reviews haven't been as unanimously favourable as its creators would have hoped, word of mouth has been building steadily in New York and beyond over the past few weeks. The musical's box-office gross for the week ended May 14 was a solid $633,072 (U.S.) or 81 per cent of capacity. Yesterday's nominations are expected to create a booking frenzy this week.\n\nThe Wedding Singer follows a trend of musical versions of popular Hollywood movies, but despite its five nominations, it's not considered a strong or serious contender.\n\nThe Color Purple, a popular if critically maligned musical, is based on a beloved book and Hollywood film and has the almighty Oprah Winfrey's name above the title as one of its producers. For the tour bookers who make a substantial segment of the Tony voters, the allure of taking an Oprah-backed show on the road, particularly in Middle America, is as safe as a money-back guarantee. That and not its actual artistic merits may give it a boost come voting time.\n\nAlthough the jukebox musical is (thankfully) past its brief popular ascendancy on Broadway -- as the recent flops of shows based on the songbooks of Johnny Cash, John Lennon and Earth, Wind and Fire prove -- Jersey Boys is a sharply directed and exuberantly performed example of the genre. It's Drowsy's most serious rival for the Tony for best musical of the year. Its leading man, John Lloyd Young, is Martin's major competitor for the top acting honours in a musical. Des McAnuff, the American-born director who was raised in Toronto, is also considered a favourite for the best direction of a musical award.\n\nWhere Drowsy is likely to dominate is in music and lyrics as well as the best book categories. Back in Toronto to do his \"taxes and some household tasks,\" McKellar welcomed the nomination sweep as \"amazing\" and \"exceeding\" expectations.\n\n\"I agree with everyone's assessment that Jersey Boys is our stiffest competition. I haven't had a chance to see it,\" he acknowledges. \"It depends on what kind of show they [Tony voters]want to go with.\"\n\nFor McKellar, Drowsy is a very tour-friendly show. \"In some way, even though they're saying Jersey Boys is a great touring show, a lot of it is based on the novelty of this incredible performance [by John Lloyd Young] To do Frankie Valli is not something that you can find everywhere. It might be a performer-oriented show. The good thing about our show is that it can be adapted to performers. . . . We're certainly unique in not having a movie star or not being based on a movie, so we've got all that to fight. We were kind of counting on these awards. It was a risk of course. The producers opened right in the award season hoping it would get something because we need it more than the other shows.\"\n\nCommenting on Drowsy's chances of snagging the Tony away from Jersey Boys, Martin believes that the two shows couldn't be more different. \"The reason Drowsy has been successful is that it has a surprisingly broad appeal. . . . Many people have come up after a performance and said to me 'I hate musicals, but I loved your show.' \" While Martin is a fixture of the show as long as it runs in New York (and even if it transfers to London), McKellar intends to make regular trips to Broadway to check on it. He's already kept June 11 free on his calendar for the awards ceremony to be held at Radio City Music Hall. \"It's not very often that you have a musical on Broadway. It's certainly something to impress other friends with. Strangers, too.\"\n\n***\n\nThe major nominees\n\nPlay: The History Boys; The Lieutenant of Inishmore; Rabbit Hole; Shining City.\n\nMusical: The Color Purple; The Drowsy Chaperone; Jersey Boys; The Wedding Singer.\n\nBook (musical): The Color Purple, Marsha Norman; The Drowsy Chaperone, Bob Martin and Don McKellar; Jersey Boys, Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice; The Wedding Singer, Chad Beguelin and Tim Herlihy.\n\nOriginal score: The Color Purple, Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray; The Drowsy\n\nChaperone, Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison; The Wedding Singer, Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin; The Woman in White, Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Zippel.\n\nActor (play): Ralph Fiennes, Faith Healer; Richard Griffiths, The History Boys; Zeljko Ivanek, The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial; Oliver Platt, Shining City; David Wilmot, The Lieutenant of\n\nInishmore.\n\nActress (play): Kate Burton,\n\nThe Constant Wife; Judy Kaye, Souvenir; Lisa Kron, Well; Cynthia Nixon, Rabbit Hole; Lynn Redgrave, The Constant Wife.\n\nActor (musical): Michael Cerveris, Sweeney Todd; Harry Connick Jr., The Pajama Game; Stephen Lynch, The Wedding Singer; Bob Martin, The Drowsy Chaperone; John Lloyd Young, Jersey Boys.\n\nActress (musical): Sutton Foster, The Drowsy Chaperone;\n\nLaChanze, The Color Purple; Patti LuPone, Sweeney Todd; Kelli O'Hara, The Pajama Game; Chita Rivera, Chita Rivera:\n\nThe Dancer's Life.\n\nDirection (play): Nicholas Hytner, The History Boys; Wilson Milam, The Lieutenant of Inishmore; Bartlett Sher, Awake and Sing!; Daniel Sullivan, Rabbit Hole.\n\nDirection (musical): John Doyle, Sweeney Todd; Kathleen Marshall, The Pajama Game; Des McAnuff, Jersey Boys; Casey Nicholaw, The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nChoreography: Rob Ashford, The Wedding Singer; Donald Byrd, The Color Purple; Kathleen Marshall, The Pajama Game;\n\nCasey Nicholaw, The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\n***\n\nTaking home Tony\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone's tally of 13 nominations is impressive, but it's not a record breaker, nor does it guarantee a sweep. Last year's most nominated musical, Monty Python's Spamalot, received 14 nods but took home only three trophies. The Light in the Piazza, nominated for 11 awards, the same as The Color Purple this year, packed six awards by evening's end.\n\nIn 2004, bookies' favourite Wicked entered the competition with 10 nominations and walked out with three prizes, losing the best-musical and best-score awards to underdog Avenue Q.\n\nThe record for most nominations and awards sweep in Tony history belong to the Mel Brooks musical The Producers. It received 15 nominations and won 12 awards, sweeping every category for which it was eligible.\n\nThe record for most nominations and zero wins is shared by the 1976 original production of Chicago and 1997's Steel Pier; both had 11 nominations. In 1976, Chicago lost in all categories to the year's smash hit A Chorus Line. In 1997, Steel Pier was overtaken by a revival of Chicago which went on to win six Tonys. -- K.A.S."
