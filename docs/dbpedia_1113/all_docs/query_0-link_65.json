        "text": "The Drowsy Chaperone\n\nRoles:\n\n​\n\nPrinciple Roles\n\n​\n\nJanet Van de Graaff: Star of Feldzieg’s Follies who is conflicted about giving up her life on the stage to marry Robert Martin. Attractive, vivacious, outgoing personality. She loves being the center of attention and is the consummate 1920s starlet. Strong movement and special skills (acrobatics, juggling, etc.) a plus. Vocal range: Alto with big belt (G3-E5)\n\n​\n\nRobert Martin: The groom-to-be who is deeply in love with Janet. He is the token 1920s leading man – debonair, dashing, and a matinee idol. He is cheesy, cheerful, and optimistic. Must be able to tap dance and roller skate.Vocal range: Tenor (C3 – Ab4)\n\n​\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone: Janet’s alcoholic confidante. Care-free, often because she is drunk. An experienced “woman of the world” who couldn’t care less what the world thinks. A melodramatic diva to be reckoned with who gleefully chews the scenery and steals just about every scene she is in. Great comedic role. Think Liza Minnelli meets Tallulah Bankhead. Vocal range: Alto with strong belt (F3-D5)\n\n​\n\nAldolpho: Latin lothario. A womanizing cad who is very impressed with himself. He is confident, vigorous, and a buffoon. Vaudeville-style acting and fake Spanish/Italian accent required. Should have great comic timing. Vocal range: Bass/Baritone + great falsetto (A#2-G4)\n\n​\n\nMrs. Tottendale: A wealthy widow and host of the wedding. She is flighty, eccentric, often times forgetful, and funny. She is absolutely charming, bubbly and oblivious to the confusion her behavior generates in other people. Vocal range: Alto character voice (G3-Db5)\n\n​\n\nUnderling: Mrs. Tottendale’s unflappable butler and manservant. He is stoic, dry-humored and sarcastic. A cross between Arthur Treacher and Niles the butler from The Nanny. Vocal range: Tenor character voice (Ab2-G4)\n\n​\n\nMr. Feldzieg: Harried producer who will do anything to stop the wedding in order to keep Janet in the Follies. He is nervous, sarcastic, impatient, overbearing, and insensitive. Vocal range: Baritone (Db3-Db4)\n\n​\n\nKitty: 1920s dumb blonde chorine. She is Mr. Feldzieg’s companion and will do anything to be a leading lady. A cross between Norma Cassady from Victor Victoria and Lena Lamont from Singin’ in the Rain. Vocal range: Soprano comedic belt (Bb3-F5)\n\n​\n\nGeorge: Robert’s anxious best man. He is loyal, sincere, and nervous. Makes looking out for Robert’s interests his top priority so that the wedding will come off without a hitch. Must be able to tap. Vocal range: Tenor (F3-Bb4)\n\n​\n\nGangsters 1 & 2: Two jovial gangsters who are posing as pastry chefs. Typical 1920s Broadway gangsters full of word play and stylized movements. Good comic timing and dancing skills required. Vocal range: (Db3-Gb4)\n\n​\n\nTrix the Aviatrix: The brave and brash female aviator. She is sassy, sleek and a take charge kind of gal. May double in the ensemble. Vocal range: Alto (Ab3-Eb5)\n\n​\n\nAuxiliary Roles\n\n​\n\nSuperintendent\n\nReporter\n\nDirector and Crew\n\nMobsters\n\nWedding Staff"
