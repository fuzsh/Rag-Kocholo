        "text": "April 4 -6 & 11- 13, 7:30 pm and April 7 & 14, 1:30 pm\n\nThe FGRHS Drama Club is proud to present this year’s spring musical, The Drowsy Chaperone, a loving send-up of the Jazz age Broadway musical. Written by Bob Martin and Don McKellar, with music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, The Drowsy Chaperone is the winner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone begins as a die-hard theater fan listens to his favorite cast album. As he does, the characters come to life around him and hilarity ensues. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theater producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan, and a chaperone on a sugar-high, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight.\n\nTickets are $5 each and will be available at school lunches each week of the show. The show will be staged at Riverside Arts Center, 76 N. Huron St, Ypsilanti at 7:30 pm on Thursday – Saturday, April 4 – 6 & April 11 – 13 and at 1:30 pm on Sundays, April 7 & 14."
