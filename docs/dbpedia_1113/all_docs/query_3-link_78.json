        "text": "A statement from our Dance Program on the life of a wonderful colleague and friend:\n\n“Our dear Brian Sepel lost his battle with cancer on November 24, 2016.\n\nFor over a decade, Brian Sepel brought music, humor, and his generosity in helping us discover more of the dancing within each of us. As our fulltime professional musician here at the Theatre and Dance Department at Cal State University Fullerton, he was a unique force of support and collaboration and music. He fed all of us with his contagious pleasure of making rhythm, melody and atmosphere, and helped us all find inspiration and meet the challenges of our days. Although it always seemed to simply pour out of him, Brian worked tirelessly to keep his music rich and meaningful whether drumming for a modern class or on the piano for a ballet class. I know that we have all greatly missed him this last year and will always cherish having had him as a colleague and as a friend.\n\nIn Brian’s memory, we plan on creating the Brian Sepel Dance Major Scholarship. It is something we can do to honor him, his music and to help continue his warm support of our dance students.\n\nBrian was born in South Africa and started his musical life playing in a variety of successful original rock and jazz bands, he built and ran his own recording studio, writing and producing audio for radio and TV advertising. After moving to America he free-lanced as a dance accompanist, playing piano for ballet, and percussion for modern dance classes at UCI, Chapman, IVC, Fullerton College, Santa Ana College and a number of smaller private studios, before settling down at Cal State University Fullerton. Some of the ballet luminaries he worked with include: Mignon Furman (AAB), Barbara Arms (Ballet Russe), Glenn Eddy (Nederlans Danse), Stephanie Saland (NY City Ballet), Brian Loftus (Sadlers Wells). The modern luminaries he worked with include: Donald McKayle, Risa Steinberg, Colin Connor, Louis Kavouras, Bonnie Oda Homsey. Together with his sister Merle Sepel-Wagner, Brian combined all his skills as an accompanist, composer and recording engineer to produce The Enchanted Doorway series. This educational series includes five titles of narrated story with music and instruction, for teachers to use as a dance class for children ages 4 to 6.”\n\nWe send our regards and keep his family in our thoughts.\n\nFULLERTON, CA–Cal State Fullerton’s production of “The Drowsy Chaperone” with Music and Lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison and Book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar is directed by Sarah Ripper, choreographed by William F. Lett, with musical direction by Mitchell Hanlon. Performances will be held in the Little Theatre, November 18-December 11, 2016.\n\n“The Drowsy Chaperone” is a joyous send-up of the Jazz age musical featuring one show-stopping song-and-dance number after another. With the houselights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life and the musical begins as the man in the chair looks on. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not so bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight. The original production was hailed by New York Magazine as “The Perfect Broadway Musical.”\n\nDirector Sarah Ripper earned her MA in Educational Theatre from NYU, and received her BFA in Musical Theatre from Sam Houston State University. Sarah was the runner up in the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival Directing Competition in 2015 and is in her last year in the Department of Theatre and Dance’s MFA in Directing program. Some of Sarah’s directing credits include “Moon Over Buffalo” and “Spring Awakening” at Sam Houston State University and “Really Really” and “Dancing at Lughnasa” at Cal State Fullerton.\n\nThe cast of “The Drowsy Chaperone” includes Joshua Johnson as Man in Chair, Adriana Rodriguez as Mrs. Tottendale, Colby Hamann as Underling, Quentin Carbajal as Robert Martin, Cody Bianchi as George, Joe Stein as Feldzieg, Allison Schynert as Kitty, Marqell Edward Clayton as Gangster 1, Kyle Kayvaun Pazdel as Gangster 2, Ala Tiatia as Aldolpho, Kristina Dizon as Janet Van De Graaff, Erin Tierney as The Drowsy Chaperone, Kayla Contreras as Trix the Aviatrix, Matthew Ollson as Superintendent and the ensemble includes Evan Borboa, Lily Bryson, Hannah Clair, Jeff Garrido, Scout Lepore, Matthew Ollson, Allison J. Parker, Olivia Pence, Anthony Michael Vacio, and Samantha Wojtaszek.\n\nScenic design is by JR Luker, lighting design is by Katy Streeter, costume design is by Bradley Lock, sound design is by Cierra Peet and hair/makeup design is by Leland Stephens.\n\n“The Drowsy Chaperone” plays at 8pm on November 18, 19, December 1,2, 3, 8, 9, 10 and at 2pm on December 3, 4, 10, 11.

Tickets are available by calling (657) 278-3371, 11am-5pm, Monday through Friday and online.\n\nCal State Fullerton’s production of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, adapted by Jon Jory, is directed by Professor Mark Ramont and runs November 4-20, 2016 in the Young Theatre on campus. Adaptor Jon Jory was the longtime producing director of Actors Theatre of Louisville who helped form the Humana Festival of New American Plays that produced several notable plays such as “The Gin Games” by Donald L. Colburn, “Crimes of the Heart” by Beth Henley and “Dinner with Friends” by Donald Margulies. In 2000, Mr. Jory’s successful career led him to be inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.\n\nDirector Mark Ramont has worked professionally as a director, artistic administrator and educator at theatres such as Circle Repertory Theatre (NYC), Ford’s Theatre (Washington D.C.), the Alley Theatre (Houston), the Hangar Theatre (Ithaca, NY) and Capitol City Playhouse (Austin). He is a recipient of the Princess Grace Foundation Statuette Award and recent CSUF credits include “The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,” “Loose Ends” and “Don’t Dress for Dinner.” Jane Austen’s classic plot concerns the independent Elizabeth, her overzealous matchmaking mother and a string of unsuitable suitors. When she meets the handsome but enigmatic Mr. Darcy, she is determined not to let her feelings triumph over her own good sense.\n\nThe cast of “Pride and Prejudice” includes Casey Bowen as Mr. Darcy, Jacob Cropper as Bingley, Patrick Curley as Wickham, Jacqueline Del Valle as Jane, Kelly Rosales as Elizabeth, Johnny Eberhardt as Ensemble, Sadie Elizondo as Miss Bingley, Jayson Guthrie as Mr. Gardiner, Megan Hill as Charlotte, Danielle Johnson as Mary, Siena Ledger as Kitty/Georgiana, Timothy Lee as Ensemble, Noa Lev-Ari as Mrs. Bennet, Michael Libera as Mr. Collins, Monique Magpayo as Mrs. Gardiner, Jeremy Mercado as Mr. Bennet, Wyn Moreno as Fitzwilliams/William, Emma Petersen as Lydia, Allie Revelino as Lady Catherine, Isobel Beaman as Ensemble, Sarah Bloom as Ensemble and Leo Torrez as Officer. Scenic design is by Ann Sheffield, lighting design is by Carly McNamee, costume design is by Dianne Graebner, sound design is by John Favreau and hair/makeup design is by Jaqueline Davis.\n\n“Pride and Prejudice” plays at 8pm on November 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 and at 2pm on November 12, 13, 19, 20. General admission tickets are $14 ($12 with advance Titan Discount purchase for students, seniors or with a CSUF ID). All tickets are $14 at the door. Tickets are available by calling (657) 278-3371, 11am-5pm, Monday through Friday and online.\n\nSoon to follow in the CSUF season is “The Drowsy Chaperone” with Music and Lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison and Book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar. The winner of five Broadway musical Tony Awards (including Best Book and Best Original Score), is directed by Sarah Ripper, choreographed by William F. Lett, with musical direction by Mitchell Hanlon. Performances will be held in the Little Theatre, November 18-December 11, 2016.\n\nFor over 20 years, Rob Kapilow has brought the joy and wonder of classical music – and unraveled some of its mysteries – to audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Characterized by his unique ability to create an “aha” moment for his audiences and collaborators, whatever their level of musical sophistication or naiveté, Kapilow’s work brings music into people’s lives: opening new ears to musical experiences and helping people to listen actively rather than just hear. As the Boston Globe said, “It’s a cheering thought that this kind of missionary enterprise did not pass from this earth with Leonard Bernstein. Rob Kapilow is awfully good at what he does. We need him.”\n\nKapilow’s “What Makes It Great?” (WMIG) made its auspicious debut on NPR’s Performance Today over 20 years ago, and with its accessible ten-minute format it quickly attracted a wide base of fans and followers. Snowballing in popularity, it developed into a full-length concert evening and was soon snapped up by presenters looking to build new audiences. What Makes It Great?® has sold out regular subscription series in places as diverse as Kansas City, MO, Cerritos, CA, as well as at New York’s Lincoln Center, the Celebrity Series of Boston, and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC and the National Gallery of Canada.\n\nSince Spring 2013, our School of Music’s University Symphony Orchestra has worked with Kapilow in his “What Makes It Great?” program to present Ludwig von Beethoven’s Violin Concerto with violinist, Bella Hristova, Franz Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony No. 8, and Antonín Dvořák’s Symphony No. 9 “From the New World.” This Wednesday, they join him for the fourth time for George Gershwin’s “American in Paris.”\n\nUnlike normal orchestral concerts, the “What Makes It Great?” program focuses on one piece. The first part of the presentation features Kapilow breaking the piece down for the audience using examples from the score with the orchestra playing and his own compositions answering his question “What if the composer wrote it this way?” “He does a great job of breaking down pieces to the smallest motives so that the audience can understand and connect with the music,” explains senior cello performance major, Emily Balderrama, “He also will involve the audience by having them sing with him or clap a rhythm.” The second part of the program features a full run through of the piece with a question and answer session with the audience that both Kapilow and the orchestra members answer. Unlike any other orchestra concert at CSUF, the orchestra is trained to be flexible to try whatever Kapilow asks them to do.\n\nThe unique experience of the concert/presentation allows for a broad audience of children and adults seeking enrichment in classical music. Emily Balderrama explains that “Kapilow does a great job breaking the fourth wall and welcoming everyone to learn and participate in the world of classical music. It’s great for the performers as well since we learn more and look at our pieces in a new light.” Many of our students use Kapilow’s teaching style and model for their own presentations on music!\n\nFor more information on our School of Music’s Symphony Orchestra with Rob Kapilow, check out the link here!\n\nLast year, the School of Music held its 50th Anniversary with their Dedication Celebration which featured performances by the Symphonic Chorus and University Symphony Orchestra with Titan alumna, Deborah Voigt. Since 2006, the Joseph A.W. Clayes III Performing Arts Center has been the beacon for training the next generation to mold the arts landscape. In it’s 10th year, Dean Dale A. Merrill and the College of the Arts invite students, alumni, supporters and community members to come “behind the scenes” and discover what makes the Clayes Performing Arts Center an amazing resource for arts students and audience members. Step into a variety of performance and rehearsal spaces where students will be showcasing their talents, join a backstage tour that highlights students’ work in our Scenic and Costume Shops, an art exhibition, refreshments and more!\n\nSave the date for Sunday, November 6, 2016 from 2 PM – 6PM. A special Jazz performance will be held in Meng Concert Hall at 4pm and will feature the School of Music’s Jazz Orchestra students alongside with guest artist, Doc Severinsen, and other invited guests.\n\nHere are more events happening during our open house!:\n\nCLAYES 10TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nSCHEDULE OF EVENTS\n\nScene from Pride & Prejudice\n\nJames D.

Graham, named for the often touted “mother of modern dance, ”Martha Graham, is based on “contract and release, ”where dancers use different parts of the body in opposition to create dramatic tension and convey emotion. Lester Horton developed his technique concurrent with Graham, but 3,000 miles west of the epicenter of modern dance, New York City, in California. This physical and creative distance allowed him to freely incorporate folkloric elements from around the world into his style, which approaches dance as an unrestricted expression of movement. Jóse Limón, also a contemporary of Graham and Horton, based his principles of dance on “fall and recovery” where dancers use the floor as a launch pad from which to rise, fall, and rise again, creating gravity defying and theatrical gestures.\n\nThe dance program at Cal State Fullerton is fortunate to have each these significant innovators of dance represented in three of its core faculty: Lisa Draskovich-Long (Graham-based), Debra Noble (Limón), and Alvin Rangel (Horton). The depth and breadth of their professional experience enriches the educational training of their students and contributes to the artistic clarity of the dance program. Each of these faculty members has their own extensive professional background with which to draw from: Rangel has danced professionally in companies from his native Puerto Rico to Mexico to numerous companies across the United States. He also performs with his company, In-Version Project, and was awarded Best Dancer by the Austin Critic’s Table for the 2011/2012 season; Noble, a highly regarded dancer whose choreography has been lauded by Dance Magazine and National Public Radio (among others) has 30-years in the field as a dancer and choreographer. She directed her own dance company, In Forward Motion, for 10 years and choreographed work in the video for musician Dave Matthews’ Grammy® nominated song, Crash; Draskovich-Long danced professionally for over a decade with Dallas Black Dance Theatre, and studied with the legendary David Hochoy, former rehearsal director for Martha Graham and now artistic director of the Martha Graham Dance Company. She has also choreographed several Off-Broadway productions and locally at Rogue Machine Theater in Los Angeles. In interviewing all three professors of dance, one point was consistently –and independently –brought up in each conversation: that the dance faculty at Cal State Fullerton has a unified, student-centered vision based on a passion for the art form, dance technique, and academic rigor. For Alvin Rangel, the goal is to effectively teach historic repertory in order for students to physically and intellectually articulate the tenets of modern dance. This also holds true for Lisa Draskovich-Long. She notes that training in modern dance takes time explaining, “Martha Graham once said that it takes ten years to make a dancer” She also adds that many of the students “start from zero”in terms of modern technique. Since many of them come from competition-based dance studios where modern dance is not taught, they learn these foundations during their time in the program. Another strength of the program comes from its rigor, which is due in part to Debra Noble. Like Rangel and Draskovich-Long, Noble advocates for a strong basis in the language of dance. For her, this basis provides a framework from which students will eventually build their own aesthetic vocabulary, adding that in order to inform your craft, it is essential to stay open to all ideas. Having come from the “dance meccas” of Chicago and New York, her extensive artistic and administrative background enabled her to see the needs of the program with what she calls “a different eye” when she was hired in 2000. She was instrumental in creating assessment-based criteria with an emphasis on training, advisement, and exposure to professional practices. Part of this exposure includes guest artists who teach rigorous workshops, many of whom are internationally recognized. This can lead to professional opportunities after graduation, and many alums have gone on to accept full-time dance contracts right out of school. Rangel often hears from these alums, who thank him and the faculty for having such high expectations of them during their time in the program, a work ethic they have applied as professional dancers, choreographers, and instructors in the field. Noble points out that the comprehensive nature of the faculty is unique among universities. While many dance programs tend to be comprised of faculty with very similar training, the styles of dance represented by faculty at Cal State Fullerton range from ballet to modern.\n\nDraskovich-Long, Noble, and Rangel bring round out this program with their vast depth of experience and knowledge. Through them, the next generation of dancers stands ready to share their gift, inspire, and innovate, much like Martha Graham, Lester Horton, and Jóse Limón did before them.\n\nCal State Fullerton’s production of John Patrick Shanley’s Italian American Reconciliation is directed by Professor Maria Cominis and runs October 7-30, 2016 in the Hallberg Theatre on campus. Italian American Reconciliation is a tale about Huey, a man who is safely divorced from his shrewish first wife (who shot his dog), but he feels he cannot regain his “manhood” until he woos and wins her one more time. This lighthearted romantic comedy by the author of the critically acclaimed movie, Moonstruck, is hailed as “lovely” and “bathed in moonlit madness” by The New York Post.\n\nAward-winning John Patrick Shanley has written over twenty-three plays and ten films. He grew up in a working class family in the Bronx, attended college and failed his first year at New York University. He joined the United States Marines and later enrolled once again at New York University—this time graduating as valedictorian. Perhaps, he is best known for, Doubt: A Parable, which earned a Drama Desk Award, Pulitzer Prize, Tony Award, Drama Critics’ Circle Award and more, and his film Moonstruck, which received three Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Nomination.\n\nProfessional actor, author and director Maria Cominis earned an MFA from the University of California, Irvine. She is the author of Rehearsing in the Zone, A Practical Guide to Rehearsing Without a Director. As an actor, Maria played the recurring role, Mona Clark on ABC’s Desperate Housewives and is a member of Neo Ensemble Theatre in Los Angeles where she both acts and directs.\n\nThe cast of Italian American Reconciliation includes Rey Pulice as Aldo Scalicki,\n\nArash N. Fakhrabadi as Huey Maximillian Bonfigliano, Sarah Ellsworth as Teresa, Summer Ruley as Janice and Rose Genevieve Rodriguez as Aunt May.\n\nScenic Design is by Ana Martinez, Lighting/Sound Design is by Benjamin Hawkins, Costume Design is by Spencer Purdy and Hair/Makeup Design is by Katherine Riddell.\n\nItalian American Reconciliation plays at 8pm on October 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29 and at 2pm on October 9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 29, 30. General admission tickets are $14 ($12 with advance Titan Discount purchase for students, seniors or with a CSUF ID). All tickets are $14 at the door. Tickets are available by calling (657) 278-3371, 11am-5pm, Monday through Friday and online here!\n\nThis past summer, CSUF Dance Majors, Jonathan Kim, Andrew Corpuz, Kevin Lopez and Chris Jensen were selected to represent the CSUF College of the Arts Dance Program at the Jacob’s Pillow Dance in Becket, Massachusetts for Inside/Out American College Dance National Gala Highlights Concert on August 25. The COTA Dance Program was one of four programs out of over 500 in the United States that were chosen to perform at the festival.\n\n“The Pillow” is the country’s only National Historic Landmark that draws people from all over the world to the longest-running international dance festival through the School at Jacob’s Pillow. The school is recognized as one of the most prestigious professional dance schools in the nation and offers hundreds of performances and workshops each season. Professor of Dance and Program Director, Debra Noble, notes the immense honor for both the dancers and the dance program to be selected. “It reflects highly on our dance program and the training that our students are receiving.”\n\nOur students’ experience was highlighted in the September News of the American College Dance Association:\n\n“Humbled is the only word that comes to my mind whenever I am asked to express my short- lived experience at Jacob’s Pillow. Having the privilege of being a part of the first [ACDA performance at the Pillow] was something that pushed me in every way as a dancer. The experience granted me a taste of just how glorious this craft can truly be. The four universities were really able to have the whole VIP experience, with a private tour of the grounds and exclusive look into the Pillow’s own archives which is a gem within an already Historic National Landmark. Mr. Shawn would be so proud of what the farm he bought has become. The Inside/Out, with its free admission, feels just like a summer picnic with friends watching the art of dance. Within the trees, its backdrop of the mountains, the Pillow creates the most ego-free, inclusive environment that I have ever experienced. All that Jacob’s Pillow has shared with us left me full of love for the dance world.” – Kevin Lopez\n\n“Dancing at Jacob’s Pillow was simply one of the most amazing opportunities I have ever encountered. Just thinking about all the people who have come and gone through Jacobs Pillow and we had the chance make our mark in such a special place. Thank you.” – Chris Jensen\n\n“It was an honor to be a part of the historic collaboration between the American College Dance Association and Jacob’s Pillow. Performing on the Inside/Out stage was a surreal, humbling, and rewarding experience that intensified our passion to pursue dance. [The four performers in the dance] each started late, and being a male dancer has brought its own baggage in our respective journeys. The piece August has allowed us to explore masculinity, community, and resilience through movement. Sharing this work with Jacob’s Pillow has been nothing short of dream, a dream worth fighting for.” – Jonathan Kim\n\n“The Pillow was a perfect place to see [the dancers] off and out to our separate paths. It was a breath-taking experience. Thank you.” – Andrew Corpuz\n\nMany thanks for the American College Dance Association and Jacob’s Pillow for the opportunity you provided for our students!\n\n“I’m so proud of you”\n\nCSUF choral students are familiar with this phrase from Dr. Robert Istad. Whether it is after a successful recital of ambitious music or before a performance of a major choral-orchestral work, it serves to validate that they are meeting or exceeding the standards set by the School of Music’s faculty. It is also their sign that they living up to the legacy that has been long established by the CSUF Choral Program.\n\nFor the past five decades, CSUF’s choral program has been a major artistic force in Orange County. Professor David Thorsen founded the choral program in 1960, and maintained a national reputation for musical excellence until his retirement in 1995. In 1996, Professor John Alexander joined the faculty at CSUF and initiated a long-standing relationship between the School of Music and the Pacific Chorale, one of the United States’ most highly acclaimed choral organizations. CSUF’s choirs under Maestro Alexander performed nationally and internationally at major conferences and concert venues. During his tenure, John Alexander reestablished the nationally recognized graduate program in choral conducting, and founded the Elliot and Kathleen Alexander Memorial Scholarship which provides financial support for outstanding choral conducting students at CSUF.\n\nEach summer, Pacific Chorale and Cal State Fullerton collaborate to offer the Pacific Chorale Choral Camp which offers local high school students the opportunity to strengthen and expand their skills as choral singers. Two-year veteran of the summer camp and current sophomore in vocal performance in the School of Music, Danielle Pribyl, explains that “(The camp) gives you an enriching vocal experience over the summer break… you are given theory lessons, work on your musicianship and get the opportunity to sing in a barbershop quartet, mini opera scene, or even mini musical theatre scene.” James Gjurgevich, an incoming freshman and also participant in the choral camp highlights that the camp “allowed me to explore and gain real experience in conducting, barbershop, solo performance, and many more areas of music not generally touched on at the high school level.”\n\nIn 2006, John Alexander retired from academia and Dr. Robert Istad, one of John Alexander’s former students at CSUF, assumed leadership over the choral program. Through Dr. Istad’s commitment to academic excellence and rigorous training, CSUF continues to prepare singers and conductors for further study in performance and teaching positions. With the assistance of Dr. Christopher Peterson, the School of Music boasts a 100% job placement rate for choral music education students in the credential program. With the support of the voice faculty, the vocal program emphasizes the importance of two major skills to their students: Professionalism and Musicianship. These standards earn the students singing opportunities they would not often receive at other institutions.\n\nIn the past year, Dr. Istad has championed the superb standards of his mentor’s choral program in performances of Lauridsen’s “Lux Aeterna,” Stravinsky’s “Symphony of Psalms,” and CSUF’s Christmas celebration, “Deck the Hall” with our University Symphony Orchestra in Meng Concert Hall. The choral program also shared the stage with alumna and international opera star, Deborah Voigt, for the School of Music Gala last fall. Our highest level choral ensemble, the University Singers, sang a full performance of Handel’s “Israel in Egypt” with the Horizon Music Baroque Orchestra and were hired to sing the “The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddess” at Segerstrom Hall. This summer, Dr. Istad prepared members of University Singers and Concert Choir to participate in professional performances with Andrea Bocelli and in the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra’s production of “Star Trek Live,” both at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nIn addition to local touring, CSUF’s University Singers traveled to Carnegie Hall to perform the music of composer, Tarik O’Regan, and 110 singers traveled to Paris, France with our University Orchestra to perform Poulenc’s “Gloria” and Fauré’s “Requiem.”\n\nDuring the 2016-2017 season, the choral program will collaborate with opera star, Kathleen Battle, film composer, John Williams, Andrea Bocelli and the Pacific Symphony Orchestra. The University Singers will tour Scandinavia, the Baltics, and Russia in summer 2017.\n\nDr. Istad was selected to be CSUF’s Outstanding Professor of the Year, in recognition of his accomplishments with the students of the School of Music. CSUF’s tradition of high standards and demand for excellence in the School of Music’s choral program continues, and Cal State Fullerton’s wonderful choirs remain a major artistic force in Orange County.\n\nDr. Istad’s Outstand Professor Lecture will be held on Tuesday, October 4th, 2016 at 4:30 PM in Meng Concert Hall and it is open to the public.

Anna in the Tropics runs September 23-October 9 in the Young Theatre on campus. This poetic play is set in a Cuban-American cigar factory in Florida in 1929 where cigars are rolled by hand while lectors entertain the workers and divert them from their monotonous jobs. The arrival of a new lector is a cause for celebration, but when he begins to read aloud from Anna Karenina, he unwittingly becomes a catalyst in the lives of his avid listeners, for whom Tolstoy, the tropics, and the American dream prove a volatile combination.\n\nAward-winning Cuban-born playwright Nilo Cruz moved to the United States in 1970. A decade later, Mr. Cruz gained an interest in the theatre as an actor and director. After being invited to join Intar Hispanic Playwrights Laboratory, he began his playwriting journey. He is best known for Anna in the Tropics which was selected by a panel of judges who had never seen a production and awarded it solely based on the strong script. Mr. Cruz became the first Latino to win the Pulitzer Prize for playwriting. Some of his other plays include Night Train to Bolina, Two Sisters and a Piano, Lorca in a Green Dress and The Beauty of the Father.\n\nDirector Fidel Gomez, an East Los Angeles native, attended Los Angeles High School for the Arts before making his way to the East Coast to attend New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. He also trained with the American Academy of Dramatic Art, Stella Adler Conservatory (NY), Stonestreet Studios and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He is a co-creator and founding member of The Vault Ensemble based at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. Mr. Gomez is an actor and playwright as well. He wrote and directed The Vault: Bankrupt and The Vault: Unlocked and co-wrote and acted in Melancholia, which toured internationally to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Television credits include NCIS, Walkout, Grey’s Anatomy, Undercovers, and 7th Heaven.\n\nThe cast of Anna in The Tropics includes Miguel Torres as Santiago, Joseph Daniel Zavala as Cheche, Tina A. Burkhalter as Ofelia, Lauren Villalobos as Marela, Shellie Sterling as Conchita, Eric Flores as Palomo and Wyn Moreno as Juan Julian.\n\nScenic Design is by Kristin Campbell, Lighting Design is by John Favreau, Costume Design is by Kaylynn Sutton, Sound Design is by Devon Swiger and Hair/Makeup Design is by Vanessa Cortez.\n\nAnna in the Tropics plays at 8pm on September 23, 24, 29, 30, October 1, 6, 7, 8 and at 2pm on September 25, October 1, 6, 7, 8, 9.

I was always the kid in the class that the others would ask me to draw things for them. I recall drawing a lot of Transformers, Masters of the Universe and M.U.S.C.L.E as a kid. I was really into collecting Mad and Cracked Magazine along with Wacky Packages as a kid. I think these sorts of things inspired me at a young age and led me to believe that one could have a career at making art” states Tolleson. He started at Saddleback Community College and completed an Associates Degree in Art before transferring Cal State Fullerton in 1996. During his time at CSUF, Tolleson was a member of the Pencil Milage Club and participated in an animation program with Warner Bros. He continued on to finish his Bachelors of Fine Arts in Illustration in 2000.\n\nThe Designer Toy Awards (DTAs) is the leading award honoring excellence and innovation in the Designer Toy art field. For his work in 2015, Tolleson was awarded their Artist of Year Award.\n\nFor his spotlight, Tolleson leaves us with advice for aspiring artists:\n\n“Don’t do it unless you have a passion for it. Every artist I know that is successful puts in many many hours and not because they have to but because they want to. Let negativity from others fuel your passion instead of discourage you. Always try new things to keep your interests fresh but also stay focused o the things that are working for you in your art. Always play, learn, experiment and listen.”\n\nFor more information on Scott Tolleson, check out his website here."
