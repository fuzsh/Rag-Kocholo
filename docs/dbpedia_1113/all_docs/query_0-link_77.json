        "text": "The Benjamin T. Rome School of Music presents its spring musical \"The Drowsy Chaperone.\" Music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar.\n\n\"The Drowsy Chaperone\" is simultaneously tribute and farcical satire of the 1920s \"Jazz Age\" Broadway musical. Framed and narrated by an agoraphobic Broadway fanatic known as The Man in the Chair, the musical unfolds in his imagination when he sits down to listen to a record of his favorite musical, the fictional \"Drowsy Chaperone.\" Throughout the play, he offers his own, often disparaging, commentary.\n\nHighlights of the show will include an emphasis on dance, made possible by the addition to the creative team of New York choreographer Kimberly Schafer. The unique set design transforms Ward Recital Hall, says director Jay D. Brock, and offers its own unique twist on a typical interpretation of the musical.\n\nTickets are $20 for general admission, $15 for CUA alumni, $10 for seniors, faculty, and staff, and $5 for CUA students with ID. The Thursday night preview performance will have discounted ticket prices at $15 for general admission, $10 for CUA alumni, and $5 for seniors, faculty, staff and CUA students with ID.\n\nTickets will be available online at music.cua.edu beginning Feb. 1 and can be purchased at the door.\n\nFor more information, contact the music school at 202-319-5414. Individuals requesting accommodations for disabilities should contact cua-access@cua.edu."
