        "text": "Winner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, The Drowsy Chaperone is a loving send-up of the Jazz Age musical, featuring one show-stopping number after another.\n\nA musical comedy fan known only as \"Man in Chair\" puts on his favorite record, the original cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical called The Drowsy Chaperone, and in an instant the record comes magically to life. His apartment is filled up and swept away by a jazz-age evening of madcap delight. Out of the woodwork come two Broadway stars on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theater producer and his moll, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters (--or are they pastry chefs?), an aviatrix, a misguided Don Juan and a very heavily intoxicated chaperone.\n\n\"The Perfect Broadway Musical\" - New York Magazine\n\n​Rated PG. Tickets are $45\n\nRuntime is approximately 2 hours and 3 minutes including one intermission."
