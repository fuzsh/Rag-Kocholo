        "text": "Music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert & Greg Morrison\n\nBook by Bob Martin and Don McKellar\n\nDepartment of Musical Theatre\n\nOctober 13-23, 2016 • Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre\n\nDo you remember that moment when you first got a recording and played it over and over until you had all the songs memorized? Well, that’s the scenario here – an obsessed musical theatre fan needs a little pick-me-up so he puts on a record to hear his all-time favorite cast recording: the fictional 1928’s smash hit, The Drowsy Chaperone. As he begins to share the story (inserting some wry narration along the way), the musical comes to life in his living room – transforming the dingy apartment into a grand estate, perfect for the upcoming nuptials of debonair Robert Martin and Broadway starlet Janet van de Graaff. Unfortunately, not all the guests are in favor of the impending wedding, so as in all good musicals, confusion, mistaken identity, hijinks, and a few big dance numbers abound on the way to the altar.\n\nWhile the The Drowsy Chaperone may not be the most familiar title, the show has garnered incredible buzz from its first performance at the Toronto Fringe Festival in 1999. The Toronto Star declared “The Drowsy Chaperone is so much fun, it’s barely legal!” while The New York Magazine hailed it as “The perfect Broadway musical.” This sleeper hit of a show made its way to Broadway in 2006, winning Tony Awards for Best Book and Score along with Drama Desk awards for Outstanding Musical and Book of a Musical. A loving parody of 1920s American screwball musical comedy, The Drowsy Chaperone is a madcap delight filled with show-stopping dance, witty dialogue, and over-the-top hilarity that guarantees an evening of laughter and enjoyment.\n\nArtistic Staff\n\nDirector: Mark Madama\n\nMusic Director/Conductor: Jason DeBord\n\nChoreographer: Mara Newbery Greer\n\nScenic Designer: Caleb Levengood\n\nCostume Designer: Camille Charara\n\nLighting Designer: Martijn Appelo\n\nSound Designer: Al Hurschman\n\nWig & Makeup Designer: Taylor Thiede\n\nStage Manager: Eleanor Howell-Shryock\n\nCast\n\nMan in Chair: Alexander Sherwin\n\nMrs. Tottendale: Isabel Stein\n\nUnderling: Aidan Ziegler-Hansen\n\nRobert Martin: Kyle McClellan\n\nGeorge: Christopher Campbell\n\nFeldzeig: Riley McFarland\n\nKitty: Jo Ellen Pellman\n\nGangster #1: Joseph Sammour\n\nGangster #2: Simon Longnight\n\nAdolpho: Charlie Patterson\n\nJanet Van de Graaff: Hannah Lynne Miller\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone: Nkeki Obi-Melekwe\n\nTrix: Cydney Clark\n\nSuperintendent: Griffin Binnicker\n\nEnsemble: Spencer Croy, Audrey Kennedy, Carina Kay Louchiey, Christopher Washington\n\nSwings: Griffin Binnicker, McKenzie Kurtz\n\nMedia\n\nProgram\n\nVideo\n\nPhotos\n\n[cycloneslider id=”16-17-drowsy-chaperone”]"
