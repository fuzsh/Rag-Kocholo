        "text": "THE title – “The Drowsy Chaperone,” the avowedly new musical that opened last night at the Marquis Theatre – virtually says it all.\n\nI understand that this little, horrifyingly pastiche musical started life in someone’s living room in Canada. It should have stayed there. It must have been a hoot.\n\nThe show starts in the dark, with an unseen voice assuring us the show is going to be short – mercifully, it is – and it isn’t by Elton John, which must have been comforting except to those few stragglers who might have turned up at the wrong theater expecting “The Lion King.”\n\nThe hidden voice also suggests, on behalf of the audience, “I didn’t pay a hundred bucks to have the fourth wall come crashing down around my ears.” Then the lights go up, revealing someone called the Man in the Chair, who starts to talk to us directly to the sound of a fourth wall crashing.\n\nThis guy lives for musical comedy, and for his collection of old musicals lovingly preserved in the amber of shellac discs. Before you can tell him to get a life, he’s telling you about some fictitious 1928 musical called “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\nWhy not revive “No, No Nanette,” for God’s sake. Oh, Canada! Oh, Canada.\n\nOf course, Canada wouldn’t be Canada without a queen, and this musical comedy queen, played with a neat disparaging humor by Bob Martin (although, as he’s also co-author of the musical’s book, he has a lot to be disparaging about), introduces the characters.\n\nDon’t worry, I won’t.\n\nMartin was assisted on the book-writing by Don McKellar – both could have done with more assistance – and the music and lyrics, which sound vaguely familiar, like songs you can’t quite place dimly heard from another room, are by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison.\n\nThe show’s not a total wipeout. Although its humor tends toward lines such as “an aviatrix, what we now call a lesbian,” there are a few nicely wry jokes; the supposed opening of the second half (luckily, or perhaps cautiously, there’s no intermission) is really smart, and the performers, Broadway veterans all except for Martin, are pretty good.\n\nEncouraged to play within an inch of their lives by first-time Broadway director Casey Nicholaw and wearing Gregg Barnes’ ditsy costumes while maneuvering around David Gallo’s cute but oppressive scenery, they do absolutely fine.\n\nSutton Foster is as bright as a penny as the heroine, and among the musical comedy stooges, an implacable Edward Hibbert as a butler and Eddie Korbich as the hero’s Best Man (the plot disconsolately circles around a wedding) are also outstanding.\n\nBut the show itself should break records – preferably of “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\n—\n\nTHE DROWSY CHAPERONE\n\n[*] (One star)\n\nThe Marquis Theatre, 1535 Broadway; (212) 382-0100, between 45th and 46th streets."
