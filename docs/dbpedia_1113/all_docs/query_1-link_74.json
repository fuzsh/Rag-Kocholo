Hilariously tongue in cheek, Austin O’Brien’s The Drowsy Chaperone had the audience in stitches from start to end.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is a show within a show, a cheeky parody of 1920s American musical comedy. It was first conceived in 1997 for a stag party by Bob Martin, Lisa Lambert, Greg Morrison, and Don McKellar. An introverted man listens to his favourite musical, pausing frequently to make sly commentary on the tale of a wedding with unusual guests, ranging from a self-proclaimed Latin lover to two gangsters disguised as chefs. From a toothy, smiling bridegroom tap-dancing away his cold feet to a tipsy half-hearted chaperone, all the characters come together to create one hell of a spectacle.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nAiden Tymchuk’s portrayal of The Man was a wholesome treat. His dorky dancing and constant engagement was heartwarming, and his realistic portrayal of a contented introvert grounded the more ridiculous characters. Wandering through scenes, Tymchuk possessed the remarkable ability to turn his fantastic stage presence on and off as necessary at the drop of a record needle.\n\nSwaying drunkenly in the spotlight, Olivia Bissoondatt wowed with her confident belting voice. Confidence was the key to her performance, exuding from every aspect. Her chemistry with Allana Griesheimer as Aldolpho, lover of beautiful women, was particularly compelling. Griesheimer’s physicality was simply hilarious. The flexibility of her hips boggle the mind. Completely committed to her character, whenever she popped into view, Griesheimer had the audience laughing along to her ludicrous sexual exploits.\n\nHailey Kilfoy was similarly committed as ditzy Kitty, wannabe showgirl. Her talented voice never wavered as she mimicked the airy voice of a 1920s starling. Playing the roles of gangsters disguised as chefs, Logan Walters and Bethany Murray had incredibly flawless teamwork. Passing their pastry puns back and forth like a practised game of catch, it was as if two people were speaking through one voice.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAs the bumbling yet oddly charming bridegroom Robert Martin, Kyria Bacinski was notable for her unflappable toothy smile. Not even dancing blindfolded on roller skates could shake her exaggerated power stance and dynamic voice. Shriya Chamarty was stunningly charismatic as Janet Van de Graff. Her strong voice accompanied her powerful movements. Smoothly she changed costumes three times during a single dance, leading to her absolutely stunning black dress sparkling in the aftermath of a confetti cannon.\n\nAs head costumer, Olivia Bissoondatt’s months of hard work culminated in a beautiful array of period costumes. Her attention to detail was matched only by the set and props team, lead by Allana Griesheimer. It was obvious there had been a huge amount of time and effort spent bringing their beautiful concept into the world.\n\nThroughout the roaringly hilarious production, Austin O’Brien’s The Drowsy Chaperone never failed to entertain. The highly talented cast and crew came together through months of chaos, their efforts shining through in this hysterical metadrama.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBy Teio Suyal\n\nStrathcona High School\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is the unlikely story of a charming, musical fanatic (The Man) who transports the audience into the world of his favourite record. From their opening scene, Austin O’Brien High School’s production of this musical comedy left the audience truly “bananas” for the story. The actors’ storytelling, commitment to physicality, and comedic timing transported theatregoers back to the 1920s.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone, premièred in 1998 and pays tribute to many 1920s musicals, through its animated characters and slapstick physical comedy. It has won five Tony Awards and seven Drama Desk Awards, since its Broadway debut in 2006.\n\nThe plot follows the wedding day fiascos of the unlikely couple: on one hand, Janet Van de Graff the charming, glittering bride; on the other, Robert Martin the excitable and quirky groom. The couple must navigate the rocky course to the altar, past evil plots, mistaken identities, and gangsters. Luckily, at the end of the day love prevails.\n\nPortraying The Man was the charismatic Aiden Tymchuk. From the opening scene, Tymchuk’s vocal resonance and storytelling made the show soar. His down-to-earth nature, paired with his narrative drive allowed him to ground a show chock full of fantastical characters. His commitment to character and comedic timing truly made him a joy to watch.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nShriya Chamarty’s outstanding musical performance in Show Off, as Janet Van de Graff, left the spectators in awe at her smooth, consistent vocals. Her vocal range and outstanding power astonished theatre-goers throughout the show.\n\nThe cast displayed a remarkable energy and togetherness. Among the most notable were the gangsters, Logan Walters and Bethany Murray, who displayed marvellous chemistry. The two captivated the audience, whether it was their uncanny ability to speak in unison or their breathtaking stunts. The pair’s trust and reliance on each other only further advanced an already outstanding performance.\n\nThe technical design by Claire Bernardino was executed at a professional level. With over 100 lighting and sound cues, Bernardino moved us from The Man’s simple apartment to the extravagant world of the musical with ease. Whether it was lightning-fast light changes or impeccably timed gunshot sound cues, the technical theatre perfectly captured the esthetic of the piece.\n\nOutstanding choreography from Kyria Bacinski, pulled us into the 1920s with flappers doing the charleston and the entire ensemble exploding into an exuberant sock hop. The ambitious choreography was executed seemingly flawlessly by Logan Walters. Walters drew the attention of the crowd whenever he stepped on stage. His stunts never failed to make the crowd gasp in amazement. From cart-wheels to tap dance, Austin O’Brien’s The Drowsy Chaperone had it all.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDriven by the pursuit of joy and comedy. Austin O’Brien brought a fresh new energy to a modern classic. The Drowsy Chaperone truly “does what a musical is supposed to do: it takes you to another world, and it gives you a tune to carry with you in your head when you’re feeling blue.”\n\nBy Meghan Bunn\n\nStrathcona High School\n\nWith white veils, cruel betrayal, and a few too many cocktails, will true love triumph over all, or will this wedding get totally derailed? Full of “mix-ups and mayhem,” the cast and crew of Austin O’Brien invited the audience to “ding along” in their toe-tapping rendition of The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nWith book written by Bob Martin and Don McKellar, along with music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, this spoof of classic 1920s musical theatre was first performed in 1997 in Toronto. The Drowsy Chaperone’s overwhelming success eventually brought it to New York in 2006, with its Broadway debut netting 13 Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical.\n\nFollowing well-known television personality Robert Martin and famed leading lady Janet Van De Graff hours before they are set to be wed, the only thing that could ruin this picture-perfect wedding are the not so picture-perfect guests. Teeming with bold characters and witty repartee, The Drowsy Chaperone details the disastrous hijinks that ensue as the clock ticks closer to the wedding.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nShriya Chamarty as Janet Van De Graff delivered an incredibly versatile performance while remaining consistent in quality and endearing nature. From sickeningly saccharine to brazenly bombastic, Chamarty flipped between lovestruck bride-to-be, and show-stopping showgirl with a wink of an eye, culminating in a diverse and captivating performance.\n\nOpposite Chamarty was Kyria Bacinski as Robert Martin. Bacinski’s rampant energy and showman-like glances to the audience elicited uproarious laughter from the crowd, while her dancing left jaws dropped, with every tap ringing clear as a bell.\n\nSharply cynical and smugly condescending, Olivia Bissoondatt’s portrayal of Drowsy Chaperone, was mature and grounded. Bissoondatt commanded the stage with her mere presence, and offered poise and elegance to the jaded and world-weary character. This combination of bitterness laced with sophistication was perfectly reflected in Bissoondatt’s outstanding vocal performance, flowing between beautifully clear tones and aggressive belting with a stylistic bite.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nTransported to an age of flapper dresses and fedoras, Olivia Bissoondatt, Aiden Tymchuk, and Keeshon Dover’s costume work expertly emulated the 1920s. Finding pieces ranging from classic aviator hats to bright red cummerbunds, the team accentuated every character with the finest details, while the use of powder blue suits and glamorous crimson gowns flawlessly evoked the glitz and glam of Old Hollywood-era show business.\n\nThe ambitious set, designed by Allana Griesheimer, included authentic apartments and astonishing airplanes that were all built from the ground up with meticulous care. The extreme attention to detail created deceptive realism, from the robust stovetop, to the delicate liquor bottles dotting the shelves, while more fantastical elements, such as the airplane, utilized vibrant eye-catching colours to mirror the outlandish circumstances.\n\nCalamity has never been so enjoyable, with grandiose sets, luxurious costumes, and enrapturing performances to match. Full of physicality and overflowing with energy, the cast and crew of Austin O’Brien’s lively production of The Drowsy Chaperone was a loving, if slightly wry, tribute to the over-the-top hilarity of musical theatre, and the genuine joy it can bring.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBy Nico Maiorana\n\nSt. Oscar Romero High School\n\n“It does what a musical is supposed to do. It takes you to another world, and it gives you a little tune to carry in your head for when you’re feeling blue.”\n\nAustin O’Brien comedically embodied the Tony Award winning show. Canadian written and fun loving, The Drowsy Chaperone magnificently mocks the tropes of early 1900s theatre. The jazzy overture lures audiences into nearly two hours of laughter and delight.\n\nLights rise, or rather, don’t rise to the voice of a sarcastic older man seeking distraction from his “non-specific sadness.” Then, with the static hum of a phonograph needle and a record, the narrator’s favourite show tune begins. Music starts and the play comes to life inside an apartment. Along with witty side commentary, the story follows the hectic life of a 1920s star, Janet Van de Graff, on her wedding day as she faces heartbreak, gangsters, and a displeased producer. Accompanied by a forgetful old woman, a Latin lover and others, Janet’s wedding progresses into a chaotic trial to discover that “love is always lovely in the end.”\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAiden Tymchuk believably portrayed the angst of a lonely old man. Providing humorous and insightful comments. His stage presence drew eyes with every side note he recited, and his delivery was often followed by resounding laughter. With quirky movement and intelligent character choices, he perfectly depicted the subtle wit of an elderly Broadway admirer.\n\nWith notes as consistent as her character, Olivia Bissoondatt staggered her way onto stage as the Chaperone. Relating wisdom to a conflicted bride, she authentically portrayed a wobbly elegance. Her amusing facials captivated as she perfectly timed punchlines. She made her role and vocals stand out, leaving lasting impressions on stage.\n\nThe bride herself, Janet Van de Graff was brought to life by Shriya Chamarty. Her quick costume changes and dancing provided stunning flair. She moved with compelling fluidity and spirit. Janet’s partner Robert Martin, played by Kyria Bacinski, danced her way on stage in tap shoes and rollerblades. Bacinski demonstrated a commercial-like comedy, and a charming smile that perfectly expressed her character.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe costume department, led by Olivia Bissoondatt, braved the challenges of whimsical 1920s wardrobes. They supplied several flapper-inspired dresses to their ladies, accompanied by fur scarves and feathered headbands. Contrarily, their more modern narrator was dressed in a beautifully boring ensemble typically seen on older gentlemen. Every costume effectively enhanced the characters and setting that surrounded it.\n\nLeading set, Allana Griesheimer directed her team beautifully. Creating an aged but cosy apartment setting, the team added details to every aspect of the stage. Movable walls, a hideaway bed, and a fridge that transformed into a stage door, showed off Austin O’Brien’s ingenuity. Complete with stocked cupboards and houseplants, the set added simplistic style to the flamboyant show.\n\nIn all, Austin O’Brien’s, The Drowsy Chaperone unquestionably does what a musical should do. With a fantastic script and unique characters, it was an enchanting performance and one hell of a record.\n\nBy Gracie Chute\n\nJ.

Written by Bob Martin and Don McKellar, with lyrics and music by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, The Drowsy Chaperone was originally written to poke fun of classic musicals, embracing and exaggerating all the most ridiculous stereotypes. It debuted at a fringe festival in Toronto in 1998, made it to Broadway several years later, in May 2006, and was an instant success, touring internationally, and now, has been brought back to life by Austin O’Brien.\n\nFrom the minute Aiden Tymchuk stepped onto the stage as “the Man,” the audience was captured. His adorably hilarious characterization immediately brought the character to life and set the stage for all the “mayhem and mischief” to ensue. As he set the dusty vinyl into the record player, in a burst of static the audience (and the man) were transported into the vibrant world of the fictional 1928 musical.\n\nAdvertisement 13\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThere wasn’t a moment in the next hour and a half that didn’t have the audience glued to the stage. Whether it was the high kicks, cartwheels, and costume changes of Shriya Chamarty’s Janet Van de Graff, the unwaveringly vainglorious white-toothed smile of Kyria Bacinski’s Robert Martin, or the hilariously sarcastic and languid Olivia Bissoondatt as the Drowsy Chaperone, the ensemble’s energy and complete commitment to characterization seized every audience member’s attention and smiles.\n\nKyria Bacinski’s choreography was phenomenal, and built off each actor’s unique and exciting skills. The choreography was not only co-ordinated and cohesive, but just as flamboyant and exaggerated as the characters carrying them out. Every tap solo and group dance was impressively executed and left the audience stunned, thrilled, and always wanting to see more splits, spins, and goofy duets.\n\nEverything in an already fantastic show was tied together by the tireless work of tech teams involved. Vibrant, exciting, and era-appropriate costumes (put together by Olivia Bissoondatt, Aiden Tymchuk, and Keeshon Dover) were the icing on the cake for characters, fully immersing the audience in the lively ’20s setting. Sound and lighting, done by Claire Bernardino, was spot on, and though at some points the sound overpowered the voices of the actors, they always bounced back with clear and precise projection that was astounding considering their choice to not mic the cast.\n\nThe occasional prop or vocal mishap was hardly noticeable next to the overall astounding acting, dynamic dancing, and superb singing of the talented actors at Austin O’Brien. It was a truly unforgettable night of laughter and joy.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
