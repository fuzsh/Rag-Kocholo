It was recently performed by Western High School, which did an amazing job capturing the characters’ true feelings and emotions.\n\n“A Heart Divided”, written as a novel by Jeff Gottesfeld and Cherie Bennett, is the story of a liberal-minded girl named Kate, played by Veronica Lempicki, who lives happily with her family in New Jersey and aspires to be a professional playwright someday. All is well until Kate’s father gets offered a job in Redford, Tennessee, a small town with deep southern roots. When Kate starts going to her new school, she is appalled to discover that the school symbol is the confederate flag. However, she soon meets Jackson Redford, played by Bruno Enciso, a third generation good ole boy who is as southern as they get. As they sort through their differences, they fall in love and work together to change the controversial insignia.\n\nOverall, the production had a few flaws, but the entire cast came together to put on a quality show. The actors made a point to highlight both comical and serious areas when necessary, and stayed in full character the entire time. Everyone exhibited high energy and kept the audience on the edge of their seat to find out what would happen next.\n\nThe leads in this show were very strong in their physicality while establishing the mood and vibe for the entire show. Lempicki, who was a narrator of sorts throughout the play, did a superb job of keeping scenes from dragging by conveying her every emotion in a believable way. The same can also be said of Enciso, who played the role as a dominant character with a spot-on southern accent.\n\nThe supporting cast showed strong commitment and enthusiasm in the portrayal their characters. Special praise goes to Brooke Stanish, who played Sally Redford, the strict southern mother of Jackson, and Santiago Zornosa, who played the antagonistic redneck Jared Boose. Both of these characters shone in their roles and brought a sense of professional realism with them on stage.\n\nThe director’s choice of minimal tech categories made for a more natural presentation, which made the audience to feel that they were one with the actors. However, the frequent blackouts and the accidental talking from backstage heard through the microphones were slightly distracting. Even so, the use of the screen center stage was very creative and brought a good visual element when a character was describing a setting.\n\nAll in all, “A Heart Divided” is a difficult and emotional show, but Western proved that this feat was not out of their reach. The entire cast and crew is commended for their triumph on this engaging production.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Carmen Horn of North Broward Preparatory School\n\n“A house divided against itself cannot stand.” Western High School’s production of A Heart Divided explores whether Lincoln’s famous words hold true for a town.\n\n“A Heart Divided” by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld tells the story of the controversy surrounding the confederate flag in a small southern town. In Redford, Tennessee, the confederate flag is a symbol of honor, of tradition, and the school’s emblem. Told almost exclusively through soliloquies directed toward the audience, this show follows a young playwright, Kate, who moves to Redford from New Jersey and quickly takes the side of the students fighting for a mascot change. When she falls in love with Jackson Redford III, descendent of the town’s founder, she learns some important lessons about how the past can shape the present.\n\nVeronica Lempicki played Kate Pride, the primary narrator of the show who emphasized the more liberal view toward the flag. She remained consistent and high energy throughout the production, delivering her lines with emotion and variation. Alongside her was Bruno Enciso, who played the conservative Jackson Redford III, and whose intention and commitment was present.\n\nKate’s younger sister, Portia, played by Micaela Mercado, added a comedic, more lighthearted touch to the production. Her stories were filled with humor and were immensely relatable. She was one of the most believable and genuine characters on the stage. The most intense member of the ensemble was Reverend Roberts, played by Austin Le-Forrester. His speeches added history and background to the story, and kept it grounded in its intent. Another notable performance came from Daniela Cardenez, who played Sara, Jackson’s Ex Girlfriend. Her accent was one of the most consistent in the show, and she was able to transition from cheerleading mean girl to sweet southern belle without any trouble.\n\nThe costumes of the show set the tone of the show instantly, with the entire cast clad in red, white and blue, the colors of the American (as well as Confederate) flag. The cast worked well together, even without much direct interpersonal interaction, and was able to overcome any technical difficulties they encountered, presenting a well put together show.\n\nIn “A Heart Divided”, Western High School’s cast and crew were able to tell a story of separation with remarkable unity.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Michael Valladares of Cypress Bay High School\n\nWestern High School’s production of “A Heart Divided” brings an incredibly relevant story of clashing cultures to life on the stage. Through a play that emphasizes family values and regional differences, Western exposes new perspectives on an incredibly controversial subject.\n\n“A Heart Divided” tells the story of Kate Pride, a liberal-minded girl from New Jersey, who moves to the southern town of Redford Tennessee. While initially reluctant to accept her country-lovin’ culture, she begins to appreciate her new home when she meets Jackson Redford III, a descendant of the town’s namesake. As their relationship blossoms, a petition to replace the local high school’s Confederate flag insignia gains Kate’s support–and soon Kate and Jack’s families are pitted against each other over the meaning of this poignant symbol.\n\n“A Heart Divided” is not a traditional play as it is presented in a presentational style. Rather than engaging in dialogue to advance the narrative, the actors directly address the audience. This reduces the onstage action, but allows the play to become a debate, which allows the audience to be a judge.\n\nLeading the show is Veronica Lempicki as Kate Pride. Lempicki characterized the shy “new girl,” which lead to believable and consistent storytelling. Opposite her is Bruno Enciso, playing Jackson Redford. Enciso maintained phenomenal consistency with his southern accent and embodied the Southern boy through his relationship with Lempicki. From Kate’s family are Micaela Mercado as Portia Pride, Kate’s sister, and Isabella Cring as Jensen Pride, Kate’s mother. Mercado played the self-proclaimed “weird girl.” She embodied the quirky personality of Portia, and her comedic timing was excellent. Mercado manages to get laughs with simple, understated jokes. Cring was an excellent mother as well, being equal parts: protective and friendly. Cring proved a stark contrast to Jackson’s mother, Sally Redford, played by Brooke Stanish. Stanish was extremely believable and an almost toxic person, which was perfect for the role. Lucy and Nikki Roberts, sisters who were leading the petition against the flag, often had moments that were extremely powerful. Played by Kayla McCall and Elan Lewis, respectively, McCall was able to deliver monologues with a poetic feel that fit with the heavy racial themes of the show. Lewis was understated and realistic, and a boon to the cast. While some actors were disconnected from each other, and interpreted the play differently, Western nonetheless has a powerful cast.\n\nWestern’s lighting design, lead by Melody Zapata, was excellent, though it appeared as though actors had to wait for lights occasionally. There were sound issues at times, and, though the projecting of sets onto the stage produced a cool effect, the execution of the projector was not consistent in working.\n\nWestern took a risk with such a heavy play, but it was worth it. To shed light on both sides of an issue that envelops the nation still today is not easy. And to play it with an even-handed viewpoint is even harder. Western left audiences with a real question about what does it mean to be American?\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Isabel Hidalgo of Cooper City High School\n\nSoft, sweet, singing voices full of hope and patriotism in the darkness of a silent theater are the first things that are heard in Western High School’s production of the play, “A Heart Divided.” A moment later, a gunshot rings out, and every actor’s face contorts into a look of horror at the tragedy only those on stage seem to be able to see. Thus begins a show outlining the lives and opinions of those people who live in the small Tennessee town of Redford.\n\n“A Heart Divided” takes place in the present day, when Kate Pride, the lead character, and her family have moved from the NYC suburbs to Redford. At once, Kate is shocked by the way the Confederate flags flies everywhere around the town, including at her own new high school, where the rebel flag is both the school symbol and the football team’s name. Her attention is caught by a petition to change the school’s mascot, but not before she meets an attractive boy that is almost a physical representation of Redford; Jackson Redford III.\n\nThroughout Western High School’s production, many actors and the roles they played shone under the spotlight. Kate Pride, played by Veronica Lempicki, was consistent in her role, reacting genuinely to every action in the play. Several supporting characters, for example, Anne Augustus, played by Milagros Cots, and Nikki Roberts, played by Elan Lewis–were strong in both action and vocal projection throughout the play. Portia Pride, played by Micaela Mercado, played her part with the humor and awkwardness that her role called for, and did so in a way that was authentic and a pleasure to watch.\n\nThe Singers, played by Kyra Mejia and Brian Inerfeld, added an intense emotional connection to the play. Their clear, controlled vocals gave the production a patriotic sentiment that could be easily related to and reminded those watching that the conflict of the Confederate flag within the play was real and still ongoing.\n\nNear the end of the play, Kate Pride stands alone in the center of the stage, looking out onto the audience that has heard her heart-wrenching story. With gentle sadness in her voice, she delivers the lines that best summarize this production: “I’ve been thinking about a heart divided – how the heart of Redford was so divided by a flag from a war that ended seven generations ago. The funny thing is, I think it’s okay. It’s the people who only want one opinion – their opinion – who we have to worry about.”\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Nick Lopez of Cypress Bay High School\n\nWestern High dipped its toes in some rather controversial waters with their production of A HEART DIVIDED, a piece which debates the role of the Confederate flag in the American culture. The choice was bold, but the show did more than just rely on the sensitive subject of the source material; it tugged at the heartstrings by examining a how a community struggles to reconcile common passions tainted in red, white, and blue with a past stained in haunting black-and-white.\n\nA HEART DIVIDED is structured in a presentational style, with characters delivering most of their lines directly towards to the audience and operating within an absence of substantial dialogue. It follows the story of a teenage girl named Kate who moves from New Jersey to a small town Tennessee. She soon takes issue with the school’s use of the Confederate flag as an insignia, but simultaneously develops an affection for a boy with deeply-rooted ancestral ties to the town’s culture and heritage.\n\nVeronica Lempicki led a large cast as Kate with a natural performance that often complemented Bruno Enciso’s passionate portrayal of Jackson Redford III, Kate’s love interest. Micaela Mercado, playing Kate’s younger sister, Portia, gave the most committed performance of the production. She brightened the stage with radiance and energy through every line, gesture, and movement. Unlike some actors, who experienced difficulty in finding different levels of expression, Portia created a well-rounded character capable of quirkiness, humor, and poignant emotion in a memorable, yet nuanced performance.\n\nA supporting cast overcame recurring issues with pacing and chemistry by creating a variety of personalities and archetypes that powerfully developed the idea of a communal identity. Austin Le-Forrester gave the most impressive transformation as Reverend Roberts, an African-American leader in the town of Redford; although some performers struggled with portal their adult characters and delivering consistent accents. Reverend Roberts exuded a credible air of authority and mastered the execution of an authentic Southern accent. Actors who similarly delivered solid emotional performances include Elan Lewis as Nikki Roberts, a girl who initiates the movement against the Confederate flag at the school, as well as Kayla McCall as Lucy, another student involved in this campaign.\n\nThe set design and the majority of visual elements of the show were approached with minimalism to put emphasis on the performances, but a series of projected videos which gave glimpses of events and settings discussed by the characters added a visual balance to the production. The lightning was consistent with the play’s aesthetics thanks to a simplistic yet functional design, although some actors struggled to keep up with black-out-heavy lighting cues.\n\nA difficult subject matter didn’t prevent Western High School from delivering a commendable performance of A HEART DIVIDED. The cast portrayed the material with maturity thus doing justice to a highly relevant story that holds great social and emotional significance.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nReviews of Mr Burns, a post-electric play at Somerset Academy Arts Conservatory on Friday, 2/19/2016\n\nBy Caden McGhie of North Broward Preparatory School\n\nIn a post apocalyptic world where all seems lost, one thing remains to unite the survivors… The Simpsons! In Somerset Academy’s production of “Mr. Burns, a Post Electric Play” we see just how funny and unifying an imaginary cartoon world can be.\n\nWritten by Anne Washburn, “Mr. Burns, a Post Electric Play” takes place shortly after an apocalyptic event. The audience follows a group of survivors as they recount an episode of The Simpsons entitled “Cape Feare.” The same story, characters, and morals from the episode are repurposed to fit the artistic and dramatic cultures decades after the destruction of civilization and reworked into… a musical. The Somerset cast also put on a hilarious dumb show, featuring the classic Simpsons characters “Itchy and Scratchy.” The scenes of their dumb show kept the audience laughing every moment.\n\nAs the survivors share stories around a fire, we are introduced to Lamont Brantley’s character, Gibson, who completely captivated the audience’s attention with his enthralling personality and his animated physicality. From Brantley’s first entrance, to his comedic ending of the Act One, to his build up and breakdown in Act Two, it’s easy to say he had the entire audience entranced with his emotional investment and grandeur. Although the leads in this cast showed emotional investment and incredible relationships, they were not without error. Diction and projection were an issue that covered up key aspects of the performance.\n\nJessica Gomez as Quincy brought her sassy and controlling character to the audience’s attention from the time she spoke her first line. Quincy was played powerfully, but Burns in Act Three, played by Gianna Milici, caught the entire audience off guard. Her shocking and malevolent disposition sent shivers down the audiences’ spine with the gripping darkness she sent into the audience. The most honest way to describe Gianna Milici’s role of Burns is Heath Ledger’s Joker reincarnated.\n\nThe amazing a cappella harmonies of the ensemble’s spot on vocals made jaws drop to the floor as soon as they walked on stage for the first commercial. The ensemble was completely engaged in every moment. They made us feel hopeful and empowered with their moving melodies in Act Two, and fearful in Act Three with their creepy physique. This remarkable ensemble made the entire ambiance of the show possible.\n\nThe technical aspects of this show helped leave a lasting impression. The set accommodated the variety of three different settings and times incredibly for a black box theater. The makeup and costumes captured the emotion of the whole show, but did a remarkable job in Act Three. Three fingered handprints, the faded resemblance of Simpson characteristics in the costumes, and all the other details exemplify the true devotion the crew had to excellence. The glow in the dark paint and makeup lit up the stage and gave a unique 4th dimension to the show.\n\nThis show as a whole had ominous energy and great delivery on the darker comedy. Although there were moments of honest intensity, there were moments where a lack of attentiveness from supporting characters took away from the atmosphere. Unfortunately, a recurring lack of diction and projection made key plot points difficult to understand. Luckily, strong cast members with lasting impressions made up for these issues.\n\nThe students of Somerset Academy succeeded in leaving a haunting and memorable performance of Mr Burns, a Post Electric Play.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Carlo Feliciani of NSU University School\n\nTake your favorite story. Try to retell it with every detail. You will probably forget some parts and make up others. Now imagine retelling the story seven years later as theatre. And now try to envision it 75 years after that, where it morphs into an operatic myth. The Somerset Academy Theatre Factory tackled this task with The Simpsons in Anne Washburn’s Mr. Burns, a post-electric play.\n\nMr. Burns premiered at the Wooly Mammoth Theatre in 2012 and then at the Playwrights Horizons in 2013. Washburn’s concept developed from her thoughts about how pop culture would survive after a nuclear meltdown. Washburn worked with The Civilians theatre company to develop the story by having them try to recount an episode of the Simpsons from memory.\n\nThe retelling of the, “Cape Feare,” episode, where Bart is being threatened to death by Sideshow Bob, developed into the dialogue of the first act; six survivors of the apocalypse try to remember the story. Illuminated by candlelight and a fire in a trash can, Gabe Celik, as Matt, Gianina Mugavero, as Jenny, Alexis Gowans, as Maria, and Ryan Fernandez, as Sam, created the atmosphere of this retelling in a broken world. All of the actors worked well together to move through the rollercoaster of emotions, like Gowans, who told a story about buying duct tape that led to a friend’s quest to save the reactors. Even though there were some issues with diction, the actors’ dealt with the gravity of the situation well, adding certain physicality like shifting weight and biting their fingers, especially Celik and Mugavero, to create consistent reactions to the tragedy.\n\nAfter a new survivor, Gibson, played by Lamont Brantley, joins the group, the story jumps 7 years ahead, where the same group with some additions rehearse as a theatre troupe that retells the stories through the currency of show lines, piecing together episodes with commercials and songs. Brantley commanded the space, either when creating a hysterical rendition of, “Three Little Maids,” or when his character, whose memory fails, believes radiation affected him. The actors shifted in maturity, showing a clear transition in time between the two acts. A medley of chart hits punctuates the rehearsal, performed impressively acapella, with songs that resurface later like Britney Spears’, “Toxic.”\n\nThe third act jumps 75 years after the second, morphing the episode into an operetta set on a student designed house boat splashed with neon colors and a mural that was illuminated by black light. The makeup, which included four-fingered fluorescent handprints on the Simpsons family to represent their connection, and costumes, which were like the TV show but morphed into neon inspirations of each character such as Homer’s bald head becoming a bright yellow bandana, complemented the set and tone. Reminiscent of a Greek chorus, the citizens of Springfield sing the story of the Simpsons being captured by Mr. Burns, played by Gianna Milici. Milici’s portrayal as a sadistic and comical clown villain created an atmosphere where you could not take your eyes off her. Although there were some balance issues, the cast’s real vocal power surfaced in the third act, singing in harmony with very little instrumental cues with highlights from Mandy Nikole Figueroa as Bart. The execution of these cues were made by the crew and stage manager Kayla Benedict, who performed with professionalism.\n\nThe cast and crew of the Somerset Theatre Factory fully committed to the complex and shifting effects of memory and a nuclear apocalypse, highlighting the power of storytelling as a form of survival and teaching us that, “Every story ends on a dark and raging river…”\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Kayla Goldfarb of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\n\nIn a post apocalyptic world, all hope for humanity is lost. Food is scarce, there is no power, and trust is nearly nonexistent. However, at Somerset Academy’s “Mr. Burns: a -post electric play”, there is one thing civilization can cling to – faint memories of the dearly beloved show, The Simpsons.\n\nWritten by Anne Washburn, Mr. Burns is a dark comedy of what would happen to pop culture in a shattered future. The story begins with a group of survivors trying to recount the popular episode of the Simpsons “Cape Feare” and progresses to the future of 7 and 75 years after trying to keep the story and entertainment alive. The play also interweaves modern day music, done by Michael Friedman, throughout the second and third acts to further elucidate the decline from today’s world.\n\nLamont Brantley (Gibson) proved to be a dynamic actor throughout his time on stage. Whether he was impersonating the Simpsons, singing “Three Little Maids from School”, or appearing in the show’s featured commercials, Brantley managed to consistently bring light to this dark story. Yet his versatility was enforced when he shifted between comedic and tragic, especially during his character’s breakdown. Alexis Gowans (Maria) and Gianina Mugavero (Jenny) also stood out in their performances. They appeared to be constantly engaged both with their characters and the setting throughout the show, even if other performers didn’t. Their high attention to detail and particular mannerisms they developed made their performance appear authentic and realistic.\n\nPortraying the titular character was Gianna Milici (Mr. Burns), who didn’t come in until the third act. The wait, however, was well worth it. Milici gave a performance reminiscent of the familiar DC Comics villain, The Joker, yet still captured the essence of Mr. Burns himself. While some portrayals in the show felt too dramatic, her over the top delivery of this ominous character was spot on. Another memorable supporting performance came from Gabe Celik (Matt). Celik had fantastic comedic timing that was especially prominent in the second act.\n\nAs an ensemble, the cast worked together spectacularly. The chemistry between one another was organic and aided in creating seemingly effortless relationships. The artistic choices of the technical team collaborated with the actors nicely to provide such an intimate atmosphere. The musical aspects of the show were beautiful. The whole ensemble sounded exceptionally pleasing, especially powerhouse vocalist Mandy Nikole Figueroa (Bart). Despite some awkward moments, the play relatively captured the mood no matter if it was comedic, dramatic, or down right sinister.\n\nWhen all else fails with our world, “Mr. Burns: a post electric play” proved that no matter what happens, the show must go on.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Brooke Whitaker of Archbishop McCarthy High School\n\nIn a future decimated by nuclear explosions, how can people find comfort in surviving another day? In Somerset Academy’s excellent rendition of Mr. Burns, a post-electric play, a simple cartoon episode becomes a moving testament to the power of art in rebuilding society.\n\nAnne Washburn’s dark comedy centers on a group of survivors retelling a Simpsons episode after a global catastrophe and explores how that recollection becomes a developing theater show seven years into the future and a full-length musical in seventy-five. Equal parts humorous and unnerving, the play embraces the nature of story-telling as a way for people to come to terms with their circumstances and their future however grim and hopeless both might seem.\n\nThe highlight of Somerset’s production was the believability exuded by each of the actors. Both the initial survivors and the later Simpson family had a very natural chemistry that helped drive home the deeper emotional points the show was trying to convey.\n\nLamont Brantley (Gibson), a wanderer who stumbles upon the survivors camp, flowed very well from dramatic moments to more comedic ones, such as when he puts on a hilarious performance of “Three Little Maids From School Are We” for the rest of the group. Alexis Gowans (Maria), another survivor, exhibited great physicality and facials, always remaining completely engaged, especially during her emotional monologue describing her meeting with a man at Walmart. Other characters, such as Gabe Celik’s Matt and Marlo Rodriquez’s Colleen were well-defined and engrossing, exhibiting unique traits and perks that truly made them come alive on stage.\n\nThe third act musical was as vocally powerful as it was visually, partially due to the mutated and glowing Residents of Springfield. Their voices blended beautifully, especially considering most of the songs were sung a cappella. Bobby Morales (Homer) and Mandy Nikole Figueroa (Bart) also had crisp, clear voices that elevated the numerous musical numbers. Gianna Milici was fantastic as the delightfully twisted Mr. Burns, who cackled with murderous glee as she toyed with the Simpsons family in the final act. While overall projection and diction could have been improved, the actors’ animated facials helped make up for the loss of words.\n\nMakeup and costumes were very effective, contributing to the overall ominous mood. The neon hand-prints which adorned the Simpsons during the final act were reminiscent of radioactive material and the iconic outfits were a bit toned down to match the apocalyptic tone.\n\nSomerset Academy’s Mr. Burns is a complex, dark and humorous look at how stories give humanity meaning through troubled times, reminding them that beyond the darkness there is always light.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nReviews of The Importance of Being Earnest at Saint John Paul II Academy on Saturday, 11/21/2015\n\nBy Isabella Cring of Western High School\n\nIn the age of Queen Victoria, the men were gentle and the ladies were covered up. The world was prim, proper, and boring. But, that is not the case in the Oscar Wilde play, “The Importance Of Being Earnest.” This farcical comedy satirizes the aristocracy of Victorian England. First performed in London in 1895, the play follows two haughty men who, in order to escape burdensome social interactions, have created entirely separate identities for themselves. Their other personas get them into trouble when they get the women they love involved. Saint John Paul II Academy presents this “Trivial comedy for serious people” with loads of charm, grace, and corsets.\n\nIt is often difficult, with a period piece like this, to pull off elaborate sets without seeming tacky or gimmicky. Saint John Paul II’s simple approach made the ambiance tasteful and refined. Scene changes were few and far between, and when they did happen, they were quick and seamless. On-que spotlights and flawless audio execution made the show a smooth one.\n\nThe endearingly flawed leading man, Jack Worthing, was played by Charlie Metzger. His physicality and comic timing made him impossible to look away from. His counterpart, Algernon Moncrieff (Nik Ramadan) was a gracious acting partner to anyone he shared the stage with. His chemistry with Metzger was absolutely dazzling and had the audience in stitches. Ramadan also opened the play with a performance on a grand piano that nicely set the tone for the play. Another shining man was Coleton Santacroce in the role of Rev. Canon Chasuble, DD. While his energetic presence wasn’t on stage often, he was by far one of the most memorable characters in the play.\n\nThe ladies of the show were nothing short of dynamic. The classic “disapproving mother” character, Lady Bracknell, was played by Audri Harrypersad. Her portrayal of the boisterous woman was hilarious and ever so relatable. Her daughter, Gwendoline Fairfax (Julia Hartmann), was diminutive in her characterization and left the audience (and her love interest) eating out of the palm of her hand. The young beauty, Cecily Cardew (Arleyce Lima), had hilarious timing and delightful chemistry with her fellow actors. Her portrayal of the slightly disturbed teenager was subtle and absolutely engaging.\n\nSaint John Paul II Academy’s production of “The Importance of Being Earnest” was a captivating piece that captured the outrageousness of Victorian aristocracy. Through antics, misunderstandings, and petticoats, Saint John Paul II Academy taught us that while we don’t always have to be honest, it is of the utmost importance to always be earnest.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Marisa Schloneger of Cooper City High School\n\nAt some point in a person’s life, they have wished to be someone else. However, what if they actually became that person? In Saint John Paul ll Academy’s production of “The Importance of Being Earnest,” you discover the story about the hilarious charade that is Ernest Worthing.\n\nWritten by Oscar Wilde in 1895, “The Importance of Being Earnest,” was written to be a farcical comedy. It follows the stories of two men who are trying to escape their personas due to the distresses of social responsibilities. In the play, the old Victorian lifestyle is proven to have a few burdens carried along with it, such as social status and love and marriage, but are told with a comical twist.\n\nJack Worthing (Charlie Metzger) is a young man with a bit of a secret; he goes by the name, “Ernest.” Although it may seem like a small fault, when he proposes to his love Gwendoline (Julia Hartmann), she admits that most of her excitement comes from the fact that she’s marrying a man named, “Ernest.” After multiple failed attempts of getting her to say that she’d marry a man with a different name, he gives in to the idea of getting secretly rechristened, “Ernest”. Meanwhile, Jack’s good friend, Algernon (Nik Ramadan), pays a visit to Jack’s young ward Cecily (Arleyce Lima). He decides to use his friend’s tactic and introduce himself as Ernest. Soon after falling in love, Algernon proposes and finds himself to be in the same predicament as his dear friend Jack. Ironically, like Gwendoline, Cecily too adores the name Ernest and is adamant that she marry a man with that name.\n\nBoth Metzger and Ramadan were incredible with their high energy and animated comedy. When the two had scenes together, or even alone, they brought life to the stage. Lima captured her character extremely well, and delivered her lines in a very subtle but comedic way. While there were a few characters that may have lacked expression, all together there was a scarcity of dull moments.\n\nOther characters such as Lady Bracknell (Audri Harrypersad), Miss Prism (Jaelyne Vigoa), and Reverend Canon Chasuble (Coleton Santacroce) were truly captivating and pulled the production together. Whether it was an extravagantly ridiculous costume or a humorous biblical reference, each of them was entertaining in their own special way and were truly attention grabbing.\n\nEach set was very different from the other, but very effective. It made you feel as if you were actually in the scenes with the characters. Although there was minimal lighting, it was just enough to justify the play and the sound was very clear.\n\nIn the end, as all truths came out, the declaration that being yourself is what will make you prevail became present. Saint John Paul ll Academy’s production of “The Importance of Being Earnest” was truthfully a must see performance. And that’s the importance of being earnest!\n\n*** **** ****\n\nBy Matthew Bonachea of Somerset Academy Arts Conservatory\n\nFirst performed at the Saint James’ Theatre in London in 1895, “The Importance of Being Earnest,” is a comedic play by Oscar Wilde that takes much professionalism and dedication to perform in modern times. Saint John Paul II Academy was quite determined to pay close attention to the detail of the time period, and deliver the story in a comedic manner.\n\nThe play is comprised of three acts that unfold an interesting story of romance, while invoking laughter from the audience. The story begins with playful bickering between friends Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff over a simple cigarette case. When Jack explains how he sometimes goes by the name Ernest, the witty Algernon cannot help himself but investigate the origins of the alias.\n\nNik Ramadan played the hilariously sassy role of Algernon Moncrieff, and provided the majority of the comedy in the show. Line after line, he brought his own talent and interpretation of the text into the show and made it all the more interesting. When spoken to by his aunt, Lady Bracknell (played by Audri Harrypersad), he exhibited a sense of respect that showed his talent through his ability to give his character a strong range of emotion.\n\nAlgernon’s butler, Lane (played by Blake Earl), complemented the other characters in the show with his dull, and somewhat depressing, character. He brought much needed comic relief into some of the duller moments and did so in a very natural way. Reverend Canon Chasuble, DD (played by Coleton Santacroce) helped turn dramatic moments in the second and third acts into comedic ones with his large and exaggerated movements and lines.\n\nPublicity and Marketing Director Jaelyne Vigoa showed a strong attention to detail when she used an actual photo of the actors who played Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff to design the program and ticket. The production was executed flawlessly by the production staff.\n\nIn staying true to the time period, accents are essential. However, some characters showed some difficulty with the dialect and could have used more development and training. Inconsistencies with the accent was, at times, distracting, but did not detract from the overall quality of the show. Some of the characters were not as developed as others, and a few were somewhat lackluster and did not add anything to the quality of the show.\n\nBeing a very difficult show to produce in high school, Saint John Paul II Academy had a hard task at hand, and tackled it with ease.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Mandy Figueroa of Somerset Academy Arts Conservatory\n\n“The Importance of Being Earnest” is a farcical comedy in which the two protagonists, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, obtain fictitious identities in order to avoid certain social obligations. Written by Oscar Wilde and first performed in 1895, this Victorian London based play follows a series of ironic situations caused by these satirical characters resulting in a comedic performance from a flurry of actors.\n\nSaint John Paul ll Academy’s production of “The Importance of Being Earnest” had a variety of contributing and mediocre elements. Although beautiful and well arranged, the set started out mildly inconsistent and incoherent. However, as the play went on, the sets became more and more expertly crafted, and by the third act we were immersed in a Victorian household. These sets were transported by an efficient stage crew that made good use of their time and were hardly noticed. Each actor for the majority of the show was followed by a spotlight that was at times slightly distracting, but mostly well managed and attentive to the movement on stage. The costumes in this production seemed to display a significant amount of color psychology between characters, and didn’t fail to match to piece accurately. The logo for this production was impressively student-done, and features the actual, digitally-fixed profiles of the actors who played our two protagonists.\n\nThe cast of this production had varying levels of character development and energy. The two lead actors, Charlie Metzger and Nik Ramadan, who play Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, respectively, displayed a high contrast to one another. This contrast in character was the main source of comedy in this farce, and they managed to grab the attention of the audience separately and collaboratively. While both pretending to be the same person at differing times, their face-offs never failed to produce a roar of laughter, and the talent emitting from these two was clear.\n\nArleyce Lima, who portrayed Jack’s young and slightly crazed niece, Cecily Cardew, made acting choices that provided a huge comedic reaction. She played these moments in an original and serious way, which made her entire situation even more humorous and authentic. Coleton Santacroce, who played the eccentric Reverend Canon Chasuble, D.D. stood out in his performance with big gestures and creative reactions. Lady Bracknell, an overbearing aunt, portrayed by Audri Harrypersad, managed to create an antagonistic figure in a skillful way. Lady Bracknell’s daughter, the lovely Gwendoline Fairfax, played by Julia Hartmann, displayed a wonderful chemistry and hilarious tension with Cecily Cardew when on stage together. Although not every actor displayed a full energy-leveled performance, the majority of the show allowed the characters to build and manifest.\n\n“The Importance of Being Earnest” at Saint John Paul ll Academy mostly captured the farcical comedy it was meant to produce. The acting and technical aspects of this production were coherent and well-displayed, and resulted in an enjoyable performance from a variety of actors. It was a pleasure to get to discover, “The Importance of Being Earnest.”\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Savannah Zona of Boca Raton High School\n\nMuffins were flinging, and humor was abounding at Saint John Paul II Academy’s rendition of “The Importance of Being Earnest.” Balancing the 19th century’s absurd notions about marriage with its insistence for such a commitment, this production captured the comedic sincerity of the classic farce, and showed that “the very essence of romance is uncertainty.”\n\nFirst performed in London in 1895, Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest” is a story of irony and deception. Wilde satirizes the ludicrous ideals that surround the institution of marriage in Victorian England with a brilliant use of comical deception. Two friends (John Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff) are engaged to be married, however, they have assumed a common false name in order to win the affection of their beloveds. Each man goes by the name of John’s nonexistent brother Ernest. Each of their fiancés have their heart set on marrying a man with said name and feel as though they would not love the men if their names were not so. Therefore, being that both men are identified under the same name, when the fiancés Cecily and Gwendoline meet, they believe that they are engaged to the same person. As the men try to regain the approval of the women, they discover the true importance of being earnest.\n\nIn its entirety, the show was packed with splendid comedic timing and honorable technical elements. Many cast members infused their characters with a sort of genuine realism that enhanced pertinent moments within the show. Though frantic at times, the technicians were overall competent in their stage duties. The crew was diligent in transforming the stage between scenes, and was successful in creating a subtle ambiance of the Victorian age through the hues of light that illuminated the stage.\n\nAdmirably, the crew paid special attention to detail. Many implements were wonderfully thought out. For example, the show’s merchandise was a design containing two silhouettes of actors from the production. Also notable were the color themes developed in the costumes of John and Algernon. Algernon wore red during Act I, and his counterpart John wore simple beige. In Act II, when Algernon assumed the name of Ernest (the identity which John was already assuming) he wore a beige suit with red pin stripes, which enhanced the combination of his own character with that of the new found identity he now shared with John.\n\nNik Ramadan as Algernon fully committed to his role. Whether he was munching on muffins or professing his affection for his dearest Cecily, Ramadan commanded the stage with his spot on comedic timing, effortless naturalism, and confident demeanor. Helping to develop a dynamic chemistry with Algernon was Charlie Metzger as Jack Worthing. While some actors in the show were inconsistent with their complexity, Metzger and Ramadan led the hilarity with their vivacious range of inflections and emotional commitment.\n\nWilde said: “In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.” Well, the cast and crew of “The Importance of Being Earnest” performed with a memorable essence of style, and being that “memory is the diary that we all carry about with us,” Saint John Paul II Academy’s production will surely be written in its audience’s mental diary for years to come.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nReviews of The Crucible at Archbishop McCarthy High School on 11/22/2015\n\nBy Carmen Horn of North Broward Preparatory School\n\nEveryone is in league with the devil and no one is safe from persecution in Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy High School’s production of The Crucible.\n\nThe Crucible by Arthur Miller centers around the Witch trials of the 1690s in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. When Betty Parris, the minister’s daughter, suddenly falls ill with a mysterious affliction, the town looks to orphan Abigail Williams, who claims that witchcraft is the source. With suspicions running high and accusations flying about, the members of the town turn on each other, using this religious persecution as a way to settle perceived wrongs, especially the devious Abigail, who wants to get her former lover’s, John Proctor, wife out of the way so she can have him all to herself.\n\nThe lecherous but righteous John Proctor was played by Matthew Salas. Salas had consistently high energy throughout the production and commanded the scenes he was in with his projection. Though he kept the intensity high for the majority of the show, the scenes with his wife, Elizabeth, were calm and believable. The two truly connected, and their interactions created a strong foundation for the difficulties surrounding them. Elizabeth was played by Brianna Eljaua with poise and composure, every inch the good Christian woman. She was calm and collected, with careful delivery and a quiet strength, serving as an excellent foil to the bombastic John.\n\nSimilarly calm in the face of all the energy and suspicion was Reverend John Hale, played by Kevin Fitzpatrick. He stayed sensible and coolheaded for the majority of the show, but showed growth as the weight of what he was involved in settled on him. Deputy Governor Danforth, the judge in the trials, had a gravity about him, able to control a scene even when he was speaking quietly. Rebecca Correa played the nervous Mary Warren, one of the girls accusing people of witchcraft, consistently and convincingly, staying active in the back of every scene and portraying believable character growth and decisions.\n\nThe rest of the girls were similarly reactive in the courtroom possession scene. The whole cast maintained a very high level of energy throughout the show. Everyone reacted to the action and stayed invested in every scene.\n\nLighting and sound effects added a significant level to this production thanks to stage manager Christine Fanchini. Makeup, by Bonnie Lynch, and costumes helped set the stage in the 1600s, and were well and subtly done.\n\nThis production of The Crucible did a good job of portraying the themes of this iconic play: truth, lies, death, trust, suspicion, and, most importantly, forgiveness.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Isabel Hidalgo of Cooper City High School\n\nThe word ‘crucible’ can be defined as, ‘a place or situation that forces people to change or make difficult decisions’. With this definition in mind, it is easy to see why there is so much spiritual strife and impassioned anguish that permeates Archbishop McCarthy High School’s production of the well known play, The Crucible by Arthur Miller.\n\nThough the setting of the play is in Salem, Massachusetts in the year 1692, the work was originally written in 1953 as an allegory toward the McCarthyism — a campaign against people thought to be associated with communism — that raged throughout the United States at the time of its creation. Throughout this play, the many characters must deal with various fateful decisions; they must choose between keeping their pride or their lives, being honest or lying to save their lives, and they must choose whether to fight and die for their beliefs or keep what they feel hidden.\n\nWhen a group of Puritan girls are discovered comitting a grave sin–dancing in the middle of the night in the forest–the consequences of their actions end up involving the entire village of Salem as they blame their midnight escapades on witchcraft. Abigail Williams, played by Bella Miulescu, leads the group of girls as they begin accusing and trying the many women and even some men of the village with the serious charge witchcraft and wizardry. Miulescu’s physical and emotional intensity, as well as her commitment to her character throughout the production made for an interesting, albeit malicious role that left the room silent in her wake.\n\nJohn Proctor, played by Mathew Salas, and his wife Elizabeth, played by Brianna Eljaua, are the opposing factors to Abigail and her posse and pay dearly for it throughout the play. As unfortunate event after unfortunate event pile upon them, the two once estranged individuals become closer and in the end, both feel a rekindling of the love they once felt fervidly for each other. Salas carried his character’s poetic lines and actions out with a power and dignity typical of his prideful character. Eljaua was phenomenal as Elizabeth Proctor, reacting and immersing herself deeply into every scene she appeared in. Every action and emotion that crossed Eljaua’s face was completely genuine. It was refreshing to see her calm, strongly sentimental behavior amongst the general intensity of every other character.\n\nThe cast and crew, led by stage manager Christine Fanchini, which had limited space to operate in, did a commendable job in transitioning scenes efficiently. In the makeup department, Bonnie Lynch did a detailed, wonderful job in transforming students for their individual roles.\n\nArchbishop McCarthy’s production of The Crucible is a powerful, profound work that no one will be able to blink from their minds anytime soon.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Neil Goodman of North Broward Preparatory School\n\nIn a world of petulant priests, would-be witches, and terror-filled trials, one man must choose between his life and his good name. The students of Archbishop McCarthy High School showed just how heart breaking a choice like this can be during their production of The Crucible.\n\nWritten in 1953 by Arthur Miller, The Crucible takes place in 1692 Salem and shows the disastrous outcome of mixing a legal system with a belief system. Often viewed as a protest play, The Crucible was written as an allegorical response to McCarthyism and features a group of young girls accusing other townspeople of witchcraft in order to serve their own motives. The story centers on John Proctor, husband of one of the accused, and his struggle to maintain his integrity while attempting to prevent the execution of innocents.\n\nMatthew Salas played the honest yet flawed farmer John Proctor. Salas portrayed the leading man with gusto and had no trouble adding steadfast intensity to his line delivery and physicality. Also, Salas displayed a dynamic chemistry with both his ex-lover, Abigail, and his wife, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Proctor, played by Brianna Eljaua, offered an appealing contrast to her husband with her calming presence, even when she herself was being accused of witchcraft. Eljaua had a masterful understanding of her character arc, which gave Elizabeth a degree of believability usually unattainable for a high school student.\n\nDeputy Governor Danforth, played by Nicholas Palazzo, had a stern and powerful stage presence that added tension and gravity to any scene he was in. Often opposing Danforth in court, Reverend Hale was thoughtfully played by the talented Kevin Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick’s command of both dialogue and moments of silence aided in Hale’s transformation from a pious priest to a broken non-believer. In addition, Rebecca Correa’s portrayal of Mary Warren was equally empathetic and eerie, which was evident in her consistent physicality and reactions.\n\nLooking at tech, the set worked perfectly to accommodate a large cast and display four different settings in a black box theater with minimal transition time. Transitions and technical cues were executed quickly and quietly under the command of stage manager Christine Fanchini.\n\nThe show as a whole had high energy from start to finish-no easy task for such a long play. However, there were moments when excessive yelling detracted from the importance of a scene, but the discipline and focus of the talented cast was clear throughout.\n\nThe students of Archbishop McCarthy High School succeeded in providing a haunting and memorable performance of The Crucible.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Claudia Moncaliano of The Sagemont School\n\n“The Crucible,” written by Arthur Miller, shares a heart-wrenching tale of the lives that were lost to the cruelties of the Salem Witch Trials. This drama became a classic American piece after winning the Tony Award for Best Play in 1953 on Broadway. Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy High School delivered this production with a clear grasp on what it meant to live in a time where the accused were blacklisted and it was safer to confess a lie than to hold on to your known truth.\n\nMatthew Salas, as John Proctor, brought a high level of intensity to the stage as he changed demeanor before the relentless magistrate, his wife Elizabeth Proctor (Brianna Eljaua), and his mistress Abigail Williams (Bella Miulescu). Eljaua and Salas created beautiful pictures on the black box theater stage as they embraced one another in the face of death. Eljaua provided much appreciated levels to the piece as a poised yet tortured woman. Miulescu could not have been more convincing of her possessed state and manipulative mind as she dove to the ground, cried for salvation, and accused more than half the town of witchcraft. Her only care for another was shown through her passionate pleading for Proctor’s hand in her persistent battle to make him hers.\n\nPlaying the role of the formidable antagonist Deputy Governor Danforth, Nicholas Palazzo contributed a powerful presence to the stage while delivering a high level of maturity and command over the court through his characterization. Similarly, Kevin Fitzpatrick as Reverend John Hale conveyed a fully developed character which experienced both a dedication to the court and a fearful guilt and regret for those who were hung.\n\nTituba, Abigail’s first victim, was played by Marisabel Correa who mimicked the shrilling screams of the possessed children and helpless cries of the doomed elder women as she longed for Barbados and to be free of accusations. Some actors lost their way in diction and volume as we heard more paralleled yells than levels in a few scenes. However, others found a great place to rest while still showcasing their talents. Alexandria Palazzo, as Mrs. Ann Putnam, communicated her hurt and angst from losing seven children as she begged the consideration of witchcraft upon Betty Parris, played by Katie Diaz, who shook and claimed to fly under demonic control alongside Abigail.\n\nThe three hour long production was engaging, eye-opening, and profound. By the final scene, the urgency and reality of the corruption between church and state was remarkably vivid to the characters on stage as they plead for one more chance at life and sanity within the magistrate.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Daniel Agmon of JP Taravella HS\n\nArchbishop McCarthy High School provided a powerful afternoon of drama at the theatre: recounting Arthur Miller’s renowned and controversial play, The Crucible and reminding the audience why this piece is a staple of the American theatre repertoire.\n\nWritten in 1953, The Crucible received largely mixed reviews and surprisingly went on to win the Tony award for “Best Play”. Risking his own life and career, Miller was blacklisted by the US government during the McCarthy era when he wrote The Crucible as an allegory for the incredulous accusations of Communism that were taking place in America. The play takes place in the late 17th century during the horrific Salem Witch Trials, when the church governed the law of the land. The righteous yet deeply flawed John Proctor, is put to the test when his ex-mistress, the young and seductive Abigail Williams, accuses his wife of the highest treason of all – witchcraft. This little black lie soon spirals out of control, ensuing mass chaos throughout the New England town.\n\nOverall, the play was superior with an admirable cast beautifully delivering Miller’s poetic language and embodying the play’s strong moral messages. The intense emotional commitment was evident in every actor. The production swept the audience back in time, effortlessly capturing the bleak period it was set in.\n\nMatthew Salas, who starred as the authoritative John Proctor, gave a commanding performance, utilizing superb realistic choices. Proctor’s wife, Elizabeth, portrayed by Brianna Eljaua displayed many deep emotional levels. Her vocal quality and diction were outstanding. The chemistry between Salas and Ejaua was electric and the naturalistic elegance between the two provided a lovely hint of romance.\n\nThe devilish Abigail Williams depicted by Bella Miulescu gave a chilling performance with exceptional energy. Her use of imagery, specifically when she saw these “supposed” spirits, was both eerie and magnetic. Kevin Fitzpatrick playing the agreeable Reverend John Hale attributed to the show immensely with his delightful presence. Other standouts were Liam Mihoulides as Judge Hathorne and Marisabel Correa as Tituba.\n\nTech-wise, the show was perfect; from the lavishly detailed set to the thrilling, exquisite lighting, seamlessly transitioning from shades of navy blue to luscious and dramatic shades of rouge during the climactic moments of the play. The music, orchestrated live, underscored every scene adding, a subtle, yet unnerving tone to the piece. Stage management, run by Christine Fanchini, was exceptional, as cues were never missed.\n\nArchbishop McCarthy High School’s haunting production of The Crucible was majestic, prompting the audience to reflect upon their own conscience, and ponder about the importance of loyalty, love, and the ultimate lesson: to always speak the truth.\n\n*** *** ***\n\n<strong>\n\nReviews of Singin’ In The Rain at South Plantation High School on 11/21/2015\n\nBy Thomas Neira of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\n\nWhen half of Hollywood’s most loved couple is in love with an aspiring actor, and the leading lady has the most obnoxious voice you could imagine, hilarity is bound to ensue. South Plantation High School’s cast and crew proved that they know how to “Make Em’ Laugh” in their delightful rendition of “Singin’ In the Rain”!\n\nAdapted from the 1952 movie of the same name, the timeless musical follows the story of Hollywood’s most loved couple as they transition from silent film to talking pictures. With book by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and lyrics by Arthur Freed, “Singin’ In the Rain” explores the not-so-fabulous life of Hollywood’s silent actors in a whirl of keeping up appearances and being trapped by contracts.\n\nSouth Plantation High School uniquely blended sign language into their performance in to transforming their production into Theater for the Deaf. The cast approached this task with maturity utilizing an ensemble of interpreters who demonstrated their dedication by not only assuming the character’s speech, but also emotion.\n\nAt the head of the production was the talented Jermarcus Riggins as Don Lockwood. Riggins maintained a commanding stage presence and astounded the audience with his rich vocals and impressive tap dance. Even while perfectly executing the challenging choreography, he always maintained his character’s emotion. Playing Lockwood’s best friend, Cosmo Brown, Jesse Castellanos shone with his unflagging energy, maintaining his character’s over-the-top humor and nature throughout the entire show. Castellanos admirably embodied his character’s personality, which was well complemented by his exceptional comedic timing and musicality. Tajah Lee (Kathy Selden) stole both the audience and Lockwood’s heart with her remarkable vocal ability and poise. Lee’s confidence and emotional flexibility allowed her to comfortably portray her character as she falls in love with Lockwood, but maintains her dignity. Other notable performances included Hannah Singer (Lina Lamont), Adam Ortega (R.F. Simpson), and Wayde Boswell (Production Singer). Singer largely added to the comical element, staying true to her character’s superficial nature and maintaining her character’s infamous voice. Boswell was a standout in the ensemble for his incredible performance of “Beautiful Girls”.\n\nAlthough the actors were sometimes left in the dark, the lighting design was commendable, skillfully incorporating different techniques like colored spotlights to add to the mood and energy of the show. The costumes were fitting of the time period and exhibited the glamorous lifestyle of Hollywood’s rich and famous.\n\nIt’s true you can’t believe everything you read in the magazines, but judging by the upbeat musical numbers, superb tap dancing, and delightful fusion of American Sign Language, it’s safe to say that South Plantation High School’s production of “Singin’ In the Rain” was a great success.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Kimberly Moatamedi of NSU University School\n\nLights, Camera, Action! South Plantation High School presents a Monumental Pictures production of “Singin’ In The Rain.” With colorful costumes, elaborate dance numbers, and even talking pictures, the scene is set for a mesmerizing production.\n\nBased on the 1952 movie, “Singin’ In The Rain” is set in the 1920’s and focuses around the story of the successful silent movie actor Don Lockwood and his struggle with his egotistic leading lady Lina Lamont. After a movie entitled The Jazz Singer becomes a huge success as the first talking movie, R.F. Simpson, the producer of Monumental Pictures, is forced to make the first musical talking movie within six weeks. Aside from the production, Don Lockwood meets a talented woman named Kathy Selden, and a love story unravels. With lyrics by Arthur Freed, and music by Nacio Herb Brown, “Singin’ In The Rain” had 367 performances on Broadway in 1985 and was nominated for the Tony categories of Best Book of a Musical and Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical in 1986.\n\nShowing remarkable chemistry through romantic eye contact and passionate kisses, Jermarcus Riggins and Tajah Lee played the roles of the soul mates Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden. Lee portrayed her character’s strong personality and determination for her career while still demonstrating innocence in her relationship with Lockwood. Riggins displayed constant enthusiasm despite complex tap dances and even falling rain on the stage. Playing Lockwood’s sidekick and best friend Cosmo Brown was Jesse Castellanos. Remaining entertaining and hilarious throughout the entire production, Castellanos shined the most during his sensational song “Make Em’ Laugh”. He ensured that the hilarity never ceased when he was on stage with incredible comedic timing and humorous physicality.\n\nDuring the entire show, the ASL interpreters including Jacob Altman, Christiane Lockerd, and Tenny-Ann Dandy, were constantly in character regardless of the character that they were translating for. Though none of them had any spoken lines or much stage movement, their consistent enthusiasm and involvement in the story was beyond impressive.\n\nThe costumes were student designed, gorgeous, and very character appropriate. The student-made sets and props were reflecting the period and were clearly carefully designed for the scene and where it took place. In the song “Singin’ In The Rain”, the stable light post had the durability to hold up as Riggins danced on it. The set behind him stayed together despite the water pouring down on it. The stage crew did a sufficient job as they constantly moved large set pieces around with ease.\n\nSouth Plantation High School’s production of “Singin’ In The Rain” presented limitless energy without straying from the 1920’s ambience. The show left the audience wanting to tap away and sing in the storm developing outside. The heartwarming and humorous show was not a disappointment.\n\nAnd cut! That’s a wrap.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Carlo Feliciani of NSU University School\n\nLights…camera…tap dance! The classic movie era is back in South Plantation High School’s energetic and hysterical spectacle, “Singin’ in the Rain,” based on the 1952 movie starring Gene Kelly.\n\nThe songs, the jokes, and the dances are all there in the Hollywood story about the filming of the silent movie “The Dueling Cavalier,” starring Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, guaranteed to be a hit-until the first “talkie,” movie causes a sensation. The movie business is changed forever, forcing the movie to become “The Dancing Cavalier,” a musical extravaganza. There’s only one problem: the leading Lina has a not-so-pleasant voice. Out of Lot 5 comes Kathy Selden, a singer and actress who can save the picture and wins the heart of Don. When Lina suspects something is up and the movie gets closer to its release, hilarity ensues.\n\nThe overall cast brought an exciting energy throughout the show that was consistent, especially during numbers like “Broadway Melody,” in which the cast came on stage to tap and sing together. Although there were some issues with tonality, the cast made up for it through their commitment to the time period, an example being the viewing of the movies, which were filmed by the cast, where cast members in the audience hackled at the screen.\n\nJermarcus Riggins as Don Lockwood had a professional-level comfort on stage that was mixed with his exceptional dancing and vocals throughout his songs, such as the recognizable, “Singin’ in the Rain.” His chemistry with Tajah Lee as Kathy Selden made it a romance to fight for throughout the story, culminating in the touching reprise of, “You Are My Lucky Star,” as Don sang to Kathy as she walked down the aisle into his arms.\n\nA definite highlight of the night was Jesse Castellanos as Cosmo Brown, with comedy and slapstick galore. Castellanos’s physicality, with no limitations, connected with the comedic heartbeat through accurate timing of jokes and facial reactions, keeping consistency throughout. His duet with Mr. Riggins, “Moses Supposes,” with precise tap dancing and comedic interjections with the Male Diction Teacher, played by Lucas Doytier, created a special moment on stage, and the classic, “Make Em Laugh,” was true to its name.\n\nMost of the technical elements of the production were student created or driven, such as lighting, sound, and costumes. Although there were some inconsistencies with lighting, the energetic and colorful decisions did add the extravagant element to the production. The sets keep the consistency of a movie set with the perfect mix between artifice and reality.\n\nAn important element of the South Plantation production were the American Sign Language Interpreters. By being the only high school in Broward County that offers programs for the hard of hearing, the school makes it a priority to make the arts accessible to all audiences. The interpreters, dressed in costume, kept a connection to the story through active signing in connection with the emotion of the lines.\n\nSouth Plantation High School’s production of “Singin’ in the Rain” created an infectious and extravagant night of tap dancing and classic moments, while also creating a poignant message about the need to make theatre accessible to everyone in the ever-changing world, so that we can all make ’em laugh and sing in the rain.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Claudia Moncaliano of The Sagemont School\n\nIt’s a world of black and white reels, silent film star romances, and red carpet premieres at the Chinese theater, but when the first “talkie” is released, every film crew in town is sent back to the drawing board, knee-deep in records. “Singin’ in the Rain,” written and composed by Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Nacio Herb Brown, and Arthur Freed, was based on the 1952 film of the same name and opened on Broadway for the first time in 1985. The typical performance of this show comes complete with raincoats, umbrellas, tap shoes, and an on-stage rain shower.\n\nSouth Plantation High School’s production showed comedic mastery, dazzling special effects, and took us behind the scenes of a movie set to experience the filming of Lockwood and Lamont’s first talking picture. Unique to South Plantation High School, they also incorporated American Sign Language into the production which added another layer of magic as the numerous interpreters portrayed their characters alongside the traditional actors.\n\nAt the center of the story, Jermarcus Riggins charmed his audience as Don Lockwood, the leading man in silent films. A foil to his brusque and shrill voiced co-star Lina Lamont, played by Hannah Singer, Riggins shared his velvety voice in the heart-felt Act 1 finale “Singin’ in the Rain” where he not only sang, but danced under the on-stage rain shower. Singer was pure comedy every time she came onstage showcasing Lamont’s diva personality and unique articulation every time she spat the words “What do you think I am, dumb or something?”\n\nJesse Castellanos found his niche as Cosmo Brown, Don Lockwood’s best friend, executing his role with eye-catching stage presence, engaging physicality, and spot-on humor. He lit up the stage in his number “Make ‘Em Laugh” where humored the audience with classic comedy bits, pouncing on and off film equipment, props, and set pieces.\n\nThe constant film set chaos was beautifully balanced with Riggins’ and Tajah Lee’s, Kathy Seldon, love affair. Lee played the role of Kathy with much poise, capturing her defensive nature, dulcet voice, and dramatized romance between herself and Riggins. Also a release from the frantic we’re-making-a-movie tempo of the show, the pre-shot screenings of the films were enjoyable to watch projected in full black and white and classic silent film format.\n\nThe ensemble had various standout groups and featured actors such as the Assistant Directors (Keshawn Louis, Jalu Rachel, and Dwayne Reed), who’s sharp rule-of-threes comedy broke the audience into smiles. While some actors, however, had trouble with diction, the on-stage interpreters showed personality and professionalism as they told the story through another lens.\n\nSouth Plantation High School’s production of “Singin’ In the Rain” captured Hollywood madness and manipulation at its finest and had stand-out actors that brought the show to life.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Nick Lopez of Cypress Bay High School\n\nSouth Plantation enjoyed quite the spectacular forecast with its latest theatrical endeavor: a radiant sunshower of charming romances, irresistible slapstick humor, and rousing tap numbers all delivered with 1920s vivacity in this spirited production of SINGIN’ IN THE RAIN!\n\nSINGIN’ IN THE RAIN is a theatrical adaptation of the classic 1952 musical comedy film of the same name; the stage production first premiered in the West End in 1983 before making its Broadway debut in 1985. Both the film and stage musical depict Hollywood’s transition from silent films to sound films in the 1920s; the story centers on Don Lockwood, a silent film star whose equally successful leading lady Lina Lamont is discovered to possess a comically unfortunate speaking voice that may not be a fit for a new era of “talking” motion pictures.\n\nThe driving force behind the production was the entire cast’s unswerving energy throughout the entirety of an incredibly intense and fast-paced show. Despite sometimes suffering from unrefined vocals, the ensemble was always animated and in character, and extensive tap-numbers never lost their excitement and vibrancy. Sign-language interpreters were integrated into the context and atmosphere of the production, thus adding an extra layer of spirit and uniqueness to the show. Jermarcus Riggins exhibited on-stage comfort and charisma as Don Lockwood, the show’s protagonist. He boasted excellent vocals and fantastic tapping ability, all of which led to a consistently refreshing command of the stage. Opposite Riggins was Tajah Lee as Kathy Seldon, a chorus girl who steps in to provide the voice for Lina Lamont’s performance. Lee fit in nicely into the 1920s atmosphere, and her refined vocals provided tender, down-to earth moments that balanced out the hyper-energetic pace of the s\n\nhow.\n\nJesse Castellanos displayed comedic brilliance in his portrayal of Cosmo, Don’s best friend. Castellanos’s dedication to the role was palpable in his sleek execution of over-the-top, slapstick, tongue-in-cheek humor, but he simultaneously exuded a natural charm and stage presence that ultimately made the performance an audience favorite. Hannah Singer also provided moments of laugh-out-loud absurdity as the eccentric Lina Lamont thanks to a clear understanding of the show’s campy style of humor, as did Lucas Doytier as the Male Diction Teacher, who made a resonating impression despite a short stage time due to a hilariously quirky and cartoonish character interpretation. Unlike Castellanos, Singer, and Doytier, some actors lacked enunciation and projection in their line delivery, which interfered with the clarity of the plot. Others struggled in building multi-dimensional characterizations, and sometimes developed unconvincing chemistry between one another.\n\nSouth Plantation’s set was enormous in scope and was vibrantly dressed by dazzling props and period costumes. The lighting design was dynamic and playful, and the creative inclusion of student-filmed black-and-white movie excerpts provided memorable humorous segments to the production.\n\nThe resilience of an energetic cast in the face of a rigorously demanding show won over both fans of the classic movie and newcomers. South Plantation was beltin’, tappin’, and SINGIN’ IN THE RAIN – and audience was laughin’, applaudin’, and lovin’ every second of it.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nReviews of The Wiz at Dillard Center for the Arts on 11/14/2015\n\nBy Paul Levine of NSU University School\n\nAccording to The Wiz, the goal in life is to achieve “power, prestige, and money.” However, Dillard Center for the Arts paints a different picture – the journey of a ragtag group of four which yearns for something more.\n\nBased on the age-old tale, “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” by L. Frank Baum, “The Wiz” tells the story of a girl named Dorothy and her quest to find home. After being dropped off in a mysterious realm, she befriends a Scarecrow, a Tinman, and a Lion, respectively. All trek to the wish-giving wizard to get what they desire, but the wizard has one demand; they need to kill Evilene, the Wicked Witch of the West. Originally premiering at the Majestic Theatre in 1975, the production ran for 1,672 performances and garnered seven Tony awards, including Best Musical.\n\nLeading the show was Paris Webster playing the strong and friendly, yet confused Dorothy. Webster’s consistent energy and bold stage presence carried the show from start to finish. The ingénue showcased her melodic voice in songs such as, “As Soon As I Get Home.” Davion Jones, as Lion, never failed to deliver laughs throughout the night. From his show stopping entrance in, “Mean Ole Lion,” to his drug-induced fantasy in “Lion’s Dream,” Jones unique charisma and boisterous intonation captured the soul-singing motif of the show.\n\nJantanies Thomas, as Aunt Em, embodied the loving themes of the show with her caring and soothing nature. She showcased the rare sight of an actor making a marked impression with little stage time. Portraying the antagonist, Evilene, Imani Brown was able to pull comedy from her lines and executed her role well. She showcased her raspy, yet powerful voice in, “No Bad News.” Opposite of Brown was Lackrishan Campbell, who arrived in style to play her popular sister, Addapearle. Campbell was an audience favorite with her swank, humorous character.\n\nFrom the eleven ensembles in the show, two stood out: the Poppies and the Monkeys. Unlike other ensembles, both radiated energy and characterization. Both also worked well as a whole, playing off each other and reacting accordingly to what was going on in the scene.\n\nAlthough the orchestra sometimes overpowered the actors, they played the jazzy, R&B music with finesse. Even with a large cast and many ensembles, costumes were impressively executed, as was makeup. The overhead projector was used very efficiently. It not only set the scene by projecting different backgrounds onto a backdrop, but also added funky animation to sense the beat of a song.\n\nCome, “ease on down the road,” to Dillard Center for the Arts to catch a heartfelt performance of The Wiz. You are going to want to see “a whole lot of wiz-ness business”!\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Michelle Malove of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\n\nEase on down the road with Dillard High School’s cast of “The Wiz” as the Lion, Tinman, Scarecrow, and Dorothy take you on a journey to find and kill the Wicked Witch of the West!\n\nBased on L. Frank Baum’s classic 1900 children’s novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Charlie Smalls and William F. Brown created “The Wiz: The Super Soul Musical ‘Wonderful Wizard of Oz'” in the context of African-American culture. Opening on October 21st 1974, this Broadway production won seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Original Score, in 1975. “The Wiz” tells the story of Dorothy, a young girl living on a farm in Kansas with her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, until a violent tornado whisks her away to the Land of Oz. In order to get home, Dorothy travels along the yellow brick road in her magical silver slippers, meeting the Scarecrow, Tinman, and Lion who journey with her to see the powerful Wizard of Oz.\n\nDillard High School’s production captured the jazzy and soulful essence of “The Wiz” with such vibrancy in all aspects of the show. Fantastic consistency was displayed among all the characters from the colorful ensemble to that of the leads, all of which were supported by the brilliant jazz music of the orchestra.\n\nPlaying the leading role of Dorothy, Paris Webster carried the show with her dazzling smile, fluid dancing techniques, and soulful singing voice. She provided eminent youthfulness in the portrayal of her character and showed genuine chemistry with the other characters. Another notable performer was Toddrick Graham as The Wiz. His striking stage presence followed by powerful riffs in his singing voice really conveyed the broad traits of The Wiz.\n\nMuch of the production’s success can be credited to the performances of the Lion and Scarecrow. Davion Jones (Lion) and Mikayla Queeley (Scarecrow) supplied an astounding amount of energy and enthusiasm, adding consistent character with every movement. Their admirable singing voices, especially in the song “Mean Ole Lion,” were effortlessly put to work while their natural dancing techniques sharpened the songs. On the more comedic side, these two performers manifested hilarious facials and reactions, truly committing to their characters, and further enhancing the final product of “The Wiz.” The works of the animalistic ensemble, known as The Monkeys, created a strong foundation to the leads, as well as the sassy performance of Evilene, played by Imani Brown.\n\nVisually enhancing the imagery of the show, the beautiful make up design by Grace Sindaco and the impressive costume design of Caroline Campos amplified all aspects of the show with coherent colors and exquisite patterns of all sorts. Following the colors on stage were the exceptional colors of music created by the DCA Jazz Orchestra, giving great resonance throughout the entire theater.\n\nDillard High School’s production of “The Wiz” was an astonishing journey that transported the audience to the Emerald City to meet the great, the powerful, and the wonderful Wizard of Oz.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Haley Amann of Coral Glades High School\n\nCome and ease on down the road to join Dorothy, Lion, Tinman and Scarecrow on the classic journey in the production of “The Wiz”, music and lyrics by Charlie Smalls, and book by William F. Brown. The students at Dillard Center for the Arts certainly filled the room with life and color in the retelling of the classic story of “The Wizard of Oz” in an African-American context.\n\nThe show is based off of the urban re-imagining of L. Frank Baum’s classic 1900 children’s novel “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.” Opening in 1975, “The Wiz” ran for four years on Broadway and won seven Tony awards, including best musical. It was then adapted into a film and released in 1978.\n\nLeading the journey along the yellow brick road was Dorothy played by Paris Webster. Webster remained true to her character throughout her performance with exuberant energy. Playing her counterpart as the mysterious Wiz was Toddrick Graham. Graham displayed a solid vocal performance throughout the night shining through solos like “So You Wanted to Meet the Wizard” and “Believe In Yourself.”\n\nFamiliar faces came into the picture when Dorothy commenced her journey on the yellow brick road. Mikayla Queeley as the Scarecrow had eloquent projection and articulation with elastic physicality. Imani Brissett played the Tinman and displayed a robotic physicality emphasizing what his character entails; this was featured splendidly in his dance solo in “Slide Some Oil to Me.” Davion James playing the “Mean Ole Lion” had spot on comedic timing and left the audience in stitches throughout his performance with vigorous energy. All the principles had stellar vocals that brought the fun and upbeat music to life. Every actor exceedingly committed to their characters physicality and had remarkable stage presence whenever on stage.\n\nOther memorable performances were Imani Brown as Evilene and Yasharwan Blain as the Gate Keeper; both were highlighted in their brief yet memorable stage time by executing their moments gracefully. Brown had a soulful singing voice with a sassy and rousing character while Blain brought comical moments to the show.\n\nThe technical aspects of the show enforced the overall production value by adding creative components such as unique costumes and a simplistic set. Each costume well differentiated the various ensembles and the principles vibrant personalities. Considering the fast and upbeat music, the orchestra had a commendable performance without missing a beat. At times there wasn’t a complete balance between the microphones and orchestra, but overall the performers were heard by the audience.\n\nThere was “No Bad News” about Dillard’s production of “The Wiz.” The cast and crew brought justice to creative twist on the timeless classic.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Aysha Zackria of NSU University School\n\nSuper soulful music, a classic tale about discovering who you are, and high spirits meet seamlessly in Dillard Center for the Arts’s production of The Wiz!\n\nDorothy and her new-found friends, Scarecrow, Tinman, and Lion follow the Yellow Brick Road in hopes of getting what each of their hearts most desires. The supposedly omnipotent and wonderful Wizard of Oz, known in this adaptation simply as The Wiz, is supposed to grant their wishes. First created in L. Frank Baum’s iconic children’s book in 1900, William F. Brown then rewrote and urbanized the classic tale, and with music and lyrics by Charlie Smalls, the soulful musical adaptation came to be in 1974, and won 7 Tony Awards and 5 Drama Desk Awards.\n\nParis Webster, as Dorothy, had a beautiful softness and fluidity in her speech and movements. Throughout the show and especially in her solo, “Home,” her childlike innocence was constant and apparent. Toddrick Graham, playing The Wiz, had a voice that conveyed the awesome power of his character. His large and flamboyant movements made him stand out from the rest of the cast. Conversely, when his true nature was revealed, he instantaneously became casual and relatable.\n\nScarecrow and Lion, played by Mikayla Queeley and Davion Jones, respectively, brought hilarious animation and quirkiness into the show. Queeley sang and danced in character wonderfully, but her comedic and purposeful actions and reactions to other characters are what really made her delightful to watch in songs like “I Was Born On the Day Before Yesterday” and “Ease On Down the Road”. The same is true for Jones, who made the audience roar with bold ad-libs that referenced pop culture. His solo “Mean Ole Lion” was filled to the brim with flair and pizzazz, as it was written to be. Imani Brissett, playing Tinman, skillfully executed the tap dancing in his solo “Slide Some Oil to Me,” as bit by bit, Tinman regained his ability to move.\n\nImani Brown, playing Evilene, portrayed an unafraid wicked witch perfectly. Her body language and fluid movement defined the character. Reflecting the beauty of the show’s musical concept, her voice was warm, rich, and strong. Everett Oats, playing Winged Monkey, was energetic, but still had the intense darkness that his role required. Though some members of the cast weren’t always in character, the entire Monkey ensemble was fully in character, present, and reacting.\n\nThe costumes distinguished character groups and made the show visually appealing. The orchestra flawlessly performed a large number of difficult pieces and stayed in sync with the singers throughout the entire musical. Though sometimes there wasn’t balance between the vocalists and orchestra, the stronger singers made it possible to appreciate the music as a whole.\n\nAfter seeing this fantastical production, the audience didn’t simply drive away, they “eased on down the road”.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Danella Moncaliano of The Sagemont School\n\n“The Wiz,” book by William F. Brown and music and lyrics by Charlie Smalls, was performed by Dillard Center for the Arts and took the audience in a new direction when exploring the Wonderful World of Oz. “The Wiz: The Super Soul Musical” opened on Broadway on January 5, 1975 and ran until January 28, 1979 for a total of 1,672 performances. The production won seven Tony awards, and it opened the door for people to start accepting the works of an all-black cast.\n\nThe Lion (Davion Jones) had exceptional stage presence throughout the entire show, which could have been predicted from the moment he stepped out onto the stage. Jones did an excellent job of portraying a cowardly, sassy, and ironically confident lion and had exquisite comedic timing. There was not a moment on the stage he was not acting to his fullest potential. Jones displayed wonderful characterization during his song “Mean Ole Lion”, and a magnificent singing voice which added even more character and personality to his overall performance.\n\nBoth Tinman (Imani Brissett) and Scarecrow (Mikayla Queeley) embodied their characters and presented them with passion, motivation, and a purpose. Brissett revealed his marvelous singing voice in “To Be Able to Feel,” in which he displayed amazing vocal power, sang in falsetto, and kept character. Queeley committed strongly to her character through her constant stage falls. She did a superb job during her song “I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday” in which she was consistent with her stunts and displayed dynamic vocals without any unsteadiness in her singing.\n\nEach and every one of the costumes was unique and special in its own way. The entire cast was dressed beautifully in an array of different colors and styles which helped bring energy to the stage. The ensemble was full of talented dancers, but could have improved its motivation throughout the show. Many ensemble members kept a plain face during the entire show while dancing and performing their roles in the background. About three or four members of the ensemble showed emotion to what was currently happening in the scene. The ensemble with the most developed group of characters were the Monkeys. They were all energetic, full of life, and never seemed to keep still or stop acting during their time on stage.\n\nEvilene (Imani Brown) truly immersed herself into her character and was larger than life. She made sure that it was known that she was in charge when she took on the stage. Brown had glorious stage presence and body language during her performance. Brown flaunted her remarkable vocal power during the song “No Bad News” in which she showed admirable characterization and gave a reason to fear her.\n\nEach lead showed magnificent character development and breathtaking emotion during the entire production. They showed their emotions and their struggles. They were all after something they wanted and felt they could not reach it. In the end, when at last they met their goal, they truly showed us the importance of why you need to “Believe in Yourself.”\n\n*** *** ***\n\nReviews of Once On This Island at Cardinal Gibbons High School on 11/12/2015\n\nBy Diego De le Espriella of American Heritage School\n\nIn a land of tropical rhythms where mythological figures roam, Love is still able to conquer Death. This perseverance of love was pleasantly portrayed at Cardinal Gibbons High School’s production of Once on this Island Jr. this past week.\n\nOriginally produced at Playwrights Horizons in 1990, it quickly moved to Broadway and was nominated for eight Tony Awards in 1991. The timeless musical by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens beautifully blends classical tales such as Romeo and Juliet and The Little Mermaid set against the backdrop of a socially divided Caribbean island. When a peasant girl falls in love with a wealthy young man, the Gods intervene to see which is stronger: love or death.\n\nCardinal Gibbons’ depiction of the show was greatly supported by their use of theater in real time. From the moment the audience entered the theater the ensemble was moving around the stage, constantly performing even when a scene was not occurring. This directorial choice highlighted the acting ability of the ensemble, they did not usually break character and gave the show a sense of realism and consistency that is sometimes lacking from the rather larger-than-life show.\n\nAnaÏs Mamary portrays Ti Moune, the love struck peasant girl who is prepared to do anything for her love. While Mamary’s vocal and acting capabilities were positively received, it was her incredible dancing that truly impressed. Multiple times throughout the show she showed a deep understanding of the dancing styles of Caribbean culture and executed those styles in a seemingly effortless manner during the song “The Ball”, which was a captivating experience. Patrick Gallagher plays Papa Ge, the narcissistic and slightly sadistic God of Death. His eerie and intense portrayal of the demonic antagonist never wavered and he stayed connected to every character on stage, constantly playing with the bodies and souls of the peasants during the entire show.\n\nOther notable performances were displayed by Emily Tallman and Skylar Sorenson who portrayed Asaka and Ezrulie, respectively. Tallman’s vocal delivery and musicality were some of the strongest aspects of the show, highlighted in the frenetic and charming “Mama Will Provide”. Her earthy characterization and grounded movements were a pleasant contrast to Ezrulie’s flowing and gentle nature. Sorenson’s kind and evoking voice was a moving experience during the romantic number “The Human Heart”.\n\nTechnically, the show ran in a smooth manner. Occasionally, some cues were missed but the cast was refreshingly adaptive and were able to continue the show without falter. Pablo Murray-Campbell’s logo design cannot go without mention, a truly remarkable creation that has a nearly-professional polish and coupled with a well thought out social media publicity campaign, was sure to draw in large crowds for the show.\n\nCardinal Gibbons’ Once on this Island Jr. was an overall enjoyable work of theater, transporting its audience to a magical world of Gods and true love.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Taylor Fish of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\n\nOn an island of social divisions where peasants mercilessly pray to the gods and dance to simply stay alive, one small girl stirs the balance of the delicate social class system. Cardinal Gibbons High School’s production of Once on this Island, Jr. exemplifies the need to choose one’s dreams with care.\n\nBased on Rosa Guy’s 1985 novel My Love, My Love, Once on this Island first graced the Broadway stage with its Caribbean flavor on October 18, 1990, running for well over a year and collecting a total of eight Tony nominations. This one-act musical, with book and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and score by Stephen Flaherty, transports the audience to a faithful island in the French Antilles where the young peasant Ti Moune, rescued by the will of the gods, discovers her purpose in the fate of a wealthy grandhomme named Daniel Beauxhomme, whom she rehabilitates with her “peasant magic” after his terrible car accident during the gods’ storm. The division in their social classes disrupts the common beliefs of this island’s two different worlds and brings into question the ability of love to conquer death in the face of prejudice.\n\nCardinal Gibbons High School encapsulated the charm of the Caribbean through the liveliness and vocal capabilities of the ensemble. In addition to their constant presence on stage to create an authenticity for the production’s location, their vivacious commitment to the island choreography and amplitude in the dynamic harmonies constructed the most enthralling moments of the show during each group number.\n\nWhile Anaïs Mamary’s youthful portrayal of Ti Moune successfully captured the innocence of her character, the true apex of her performance lied within her mesmerizing flexibility and poise during “Ti Moune’s Dance.” Throughout the show, Mamary expressed her characterization through her commanding grace of her physicality, frequently displaying Ti Moune’s good nature with an insuppressible swing of her hips. Her performance at the grandhomme’s ball demonstrated the pinnacle of her ability to captivate a crowd, whether it be onstage or off.\n\nThe accelerating development of the production is credited to the large characterizations and the effervescent engagement of the four gods. The inflated personalities of Emily Tallman (Asaka), Brandon Caradonna (Agwe), Skylar Sorenson (Erzulie), and Patrick Gallagher (Papa Ge) assisted their presence as an omnipotent group among the more feeble characterizations of the ensemble. Each expanding on the story of Ti Moune with poignant solos of varying motivations, the gods soared in their vocal aptitudes, specifically recognizable in Tallman’s deliverance. Her flamboyant portrayal of Asaka’s “Mama Will Provide” was outwardly astounding, from her physicality as the ostentatious motherly figure to her unending vocal range.\n\nFrom the innovative set to the clarity of sound, the technical aspects of the show appeared faultless. Other than a few arguable clothing aspects in the gods’ appearances, the costumes aided the believability of the production, the ragged clothing of the storytellers especially. The cast made commendable use of the set, creating levels of vision to distinguish the different locations in which events occurred during the performance.\n\nThe performance of Once on this Island, Jr. at Cardinal Gibbons High School truly displays the strength of love against the power of death and serves as a reminder as to why we tell the story.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Claudia Moncaliano of The Sagemont School\n\nThe ocean brought them sand, the sand led them to a tree, and the tree brought them…a girl? “Once On This Island Jr.” tells the story of an orphaned peasant girl searching for her purpose in life after being found in a tree by her adoptive parents. Written and composed by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, the original Broadway production of “Once on This Island,” based on Rosa Guy’s “My Love, My Love,” ran from 1990 to 1991 and went on to win the Olivier Award for Best New Musical in 1995.\n\nCardinal Gibbons High School showed a high level of skill and dramaturgy by engaging in real-time theater, enhancing the junior version. Even before the director’s opening speech, the island storytellers invited us into their lives, filling the stage with their rich culture and vibrant traditions. They soon became real-life storytellers, sharing a tale of love versus death on the French Antilles. But it didn’t end there. Before our very eyes, actors changed positions, body language, and characterization, sitting us down at the island gathering to hear the story of Ti Moune (Anaïs Mamary), without a blackout or curtain close to cease their brilliant execution.\n\nMamary charmed us with her graceful yet powerful tribal rhythm as she danced and fell in love with Daniel Beauxhomme (Ciaran Soden). With a classic Romeo and Juliet origin, these two could never be, but together Mamary and Soden convinced otherwise during their synchronized dance to “The Human Heart” where they connected in a way only lovers can.\n\nWith undeniable stage presence, the island Gods of Earth, Love, Death, and Water led the islanders’ movements and actions as they helped tell the story. The entire cast traveled the course of the story with a vivid musicality that enhanced the energy of the production. Papa Ge (Patrick Gallagher), God of Death, in particular made the island tremble with fear as he threatened such islanders’ lives and battled with Erzulie (Skylar Sorenson), Goddess of Love.\n\nWhile some sound issues became a minor distraction to the performance, standout characters such as Asaka (Emily Tallman), Goddess of Earth, shined through them. Tallman’s powerful vocals, elaborate characterization, and eye-catching costume, stood out in her solo, “Mama Will Provide,” and brought another layer of life and energy to the stage.\n\nThe mix of non-stop theatrical activity and well represented island culture turned Cardinal Gibbons High School’s production into a vehicle for the expression of love and loss. All together the cast drew us in with the way they chose to tell the\n\nstory and touched our hearts with the powerful moments they were able to create.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Dylan Redshaw of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\n\nGreetings from the Jewel of the Antilles – Cardinal Gibbon’s island with an enchanting story to tell and one small girl to assist in telling it.\n\nBased on Rosa Guy’s My Love, My Love, Once on This Island premiered on Broadway in 1990. The following year, the show was nominated for eight TONY awards and in 1995 it won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical. With book and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and music by Stephen Flaherty, the show impressed audiences right from the start. Once on This Island succeeds in telling the tale of a young, peasant girl named Ti Moune as she commences on a quest, given by the Gods, to prove that the power of love is stronger than death.\n\nCardinal Gibbon’s Once on This Island Jr. was simply delightful. Anaïs Mamary achieved the vivacious spirit of Ti Moune with her lovely vocals and her fantastic dance skills. Mamary’s rhythm in “Ti Moune’s Dance” was absolutely incredible. Each of her moves blended flawlessly with the next and her solo moved fluently. Papa Ge, self-described as “the sly demon of death”, was depicted by Patrick Gallagher, who heightened the energy with his booming, effective voice and impressive intonations. Whether Gallagher was using his dynamic movements or projecting his malevolent laugh, he had utter control of his character throughout the entirety of the show.\n\nOther notable performances included the balance of the gods. Skylar Sorenson as the Goddess of Love, Erzulie, accomplished many admirable moments and projected a beautiful, intense voice. Emily Tallman, as the Goddess of Earth, Asaka, commanded the audience’s attention in her breathtaking song, “Mama Will Provide.” Tallman delivered sublime vocals and had a resplendent presence onstage. The God of Water, Agwe, portrayed by Brandon Caradonna, provided a clear, articulate singing voice with his striking notes in “And the Gods Heard Her Prayer/Rain”.\n\nAs a whole, the ensemble was a very important factor in this show. The group provided alluring pictures and created magnificent harmonies that stood out impeccably. The dance numbers were truly phenomenal and helped to boost the vigor of the show. The cast altogether was adept and connected ideally with one another.\n\nThe cast used the set to their advantage as it aided in establishing the tropical island setting. Make up, by Catie Babin and Stephanie Bidwill, was designed with utmost detail and was extremely pleasing to the eye. Although there were slight sound issues, each actor worked around them and continued to carry out their lines or songs.\n\nAll in all, the students of Cardinal Gibbons executed their bright, Caribbean-flavored show, Once on This Island, Jr., with great finesse and prodigious talent.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Emily Hunsucker of Boca Raton High School\n\nThe hierarchy of theatre goes God(s), Director, Stage Manager, and then crew/cast. But in Cardinal Gibbon’s performance of “Once on This Island, Jr.”, that hierarchy was changed when the actors became actual gods and goddesses, meddling in the lives of mortals to create this stunning show.\n\n“Once on This Island” was originally staged as an Off-Broadway show in 1990 until the production would open on Broadway that same year where it was nominated for eight Tony Awards and winning a Theatre World Award in 1991. “Once on This Island” is a story of a peasant girl’s life, pain, love, grief, faith, and "
