        "text": "Kicking the bucket: The Drowsy Chaperone, RIP.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone has finally stumbled. After a fairytale journey from stag-party sketch to Fringe festival hit to Tony-winning Broadway smash, the little Canadian show that could has run smack into a wall of indifference in the West End, where it will close on August 4 - not even three months after opening.\n\nThe musical comedy - a real gem I recommend catching before it closes - is about a lonely theatre geek known simply as Man in Chair who wears over-sized cardigans and is obsessed with a fluffy 1920s musical called The Drowsy Chaperone. As he plays the cast recording for the audience, the show comes to life in his apartment and he offers up a knowing DVD-style commentary from his armchair.\n\nFor the London run at the Novello, book writers Bob Martin and Don McKellar inserted a joke that presaged the production's early closing. Whereas, in New York, Man in Chair put the (fictional) original Broadway cast recording of The Drowsy Chaperone on his turntable, in London he put a live recording of the (fictional) 1920s London transfer. Before dropping the needle, Man in Chair noted that there would be little audience laughter heard on this recording, but that is \"typical of American hits transplanted to the West End\".\n\nIronically, The Drowsy Chaperone (the actual show, that is - your confusion is understandable) actually did have London audiences rolling in the aisle, those who got out to see it anyway. If anything, they seemed more enthusiastic than the New York crowds, responding aloud to Man in Chair as if it were a panto for adults. The critics, too, were generally very positive about the show.\n\nSo with good reviews and happy audiences, why the early closing notice? Likely the thing that marks Drowsy as unique on the West End this season was responsible for its downfall: it's an entirely original show. Unlike much of the musical fare that's on right now, it is not a revival and it is not based on a film or book and the songs aren't by a famous pop group, but by a couple of unknown pigeon-lovers named Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison.\n\nIn a crowded West End with higher-than-ever ticket prices, producers have increasingly turned to well-known properties to lure people into the theatre. Why would a tourist take a chance on an unknown show with an odd title, when they already know that they like Dirty Dancing or Monty Python or the music of Queen?\n\nWith a premise that is harder to explain in a sentence than Avenue Q (Sesame Street for adults) or Wicked (The Wizard of Oz from the witch's point of view), The Drowsy Chaperone had to find another way to market itself. Because of a perception that Londoners are sceptical of shows that originate in America (even if they are written by Canadians), the producers unwisely declined to push the show's Tony Award wins in the advertising. Instead, they relied on an idiosyncratic campaign that relied heavily on trumpeting that Elaine Paige was playing the titular character. (This despite the fact that Drowsy is an ensemble show and that, truth be told, while Paige sent herself up well as an ageing actress who tries to upstage the young star, she didn't bring the show to a stop the way Tony winner Beth Leavel did in the same role on Broadway.)"
