Lynn Thompson\n\nFebruary 21-23 and 26-27\n\nWinner of five Tony Awards this musical is a heartfelt and hilarious love letter to jazz-age musicals. Our modern-day narrator takes the audience on a trip down memory lane introducing us to his favorite musical from 1928, “The Drowsy Chaperone.” The recipe for hilarity starts with a Broadway star on the eve of her wedding. Add in a desperate theater producer, disguised gangsters, an over the top Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for madcap delight!"
