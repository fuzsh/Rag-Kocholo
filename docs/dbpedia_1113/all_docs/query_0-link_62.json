        "text": "The Drowsy Chaperone\n\nMusic and lyrics by Lisa Lambert & Greg Morrison\n\nBook by Bob Martin & Don McKellar\n\nDirected by Sean Byrd\n\nMusical direction by Christopher Stordalen\n\nChoreography by Nickie Kromminga Hill\n\nSeptember 6–29, 2024\n\nFridays & Saturdays at 7:00 p.m.* | Sundays at 2:00 p.m.\n\n*Saturday, September 21 is at 2:00 p.m. instead of 7:00 p.m. (Updated from brochure.)\n\nJohn H. Potter Theater\n\n$25–32 for adults | $20 for youth\n\nRecommended for ages 13+\n\nWith the houselights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life and The Drowsy Chaperone begins as the man in the chair looks on. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan, and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight.\n\nWinner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, The Drowsy Chaperone is a loving send-up of the Golden Age musical, featuring one show-stopping song and dance number after another.\n\nPresented through special arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI). All authorized performance materials are also supplied by MTI. www.mtishows.com"
