        "text": "Unlike the Americans, or even the Canadians, the Brits are very stingy with their standing ovations. If you want it, you have to work for it, and work hard. But on Saturday's closing-night performance of The Drowsy Chaperone in London, a sold-out house gave the cast the best parting gift they could have hoped for: a rapturous standing ovation the likes of which I don't recall seeing in the West End for a decade or more. They cheered, hollered and stamped their feel in approval and appreciation.\n\nSuch a warm reception for a such a resounding commercial flop. What gives? Why did The Drowsy Chaperone - the multiple Tony Award-winning Canadian-penned show with music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison and book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar - not catch on in London as it did in New York?\n\nIt couldn't have been the reviews. When it opened at the Novello Theatre in June (for an initial planned run until February, 2008), almost all major British critics cheered its wit, intelligence and heart. The producers cast Elaine Paige, London's \"first lady of musical theatre,\" in the title role.That way, they could at least count on her star appeal to keep the show running for the first few months. (Paige is the original star of both Evita and Cats in London.) But to close after less than two months with these glowing reviews and Paige's name says more about the current state of commercial theatre in London in general than it does about The Drowsy Chaperone in particular.\n\nIn the two days leading up to closing night, both The Guardian and the Evening Standard ran very different analyses of the West End by, respectively, critic Michael Billington and columnist Johann Hari. The one thing the two agree on was the inexplicable fate of The Drowsy Chaperone. Billington was one of the few critics not to be taken by it when it opened in June, but even he couldn't hide his surprise at its early demise. Hari, on the other hand, is decidedly effusive, calling it \"the best musical in the West End.\" The Drowsy Chaperone, he continues, is \"not only a great musical, but also a great defence of the blessed-out, laughter-packed musical as a genre.\"\n\nAmong London's musical-theatre community, this Canadian show has also triggered some soul searching. At the closing-night party, the mood was of defiant celebration and quiet resignation to the prevailing laws of the West End - awash as it is with cheesy jukebox musicals ( We Will Rock You), stage adaptations of films ( Footloose) and revivals cast through call-in TV shows ( Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat). An original like Drowsy with no brand recognition stands little chance of surviving in a theatrical landscape where musicals are sold with the same marketing smarminess of package holidays. The show's lyricist, Lisa Lambert, its director and choreographer Casey Nicholaw and lead producer Kevin McCollum were all mystified by its short run. They all agree that the West End just didn't get this one.\n\nI have no qualms with that theory. With very few exceptions, London's West End is a cultural wasteland. The heart and soul of contemporary London theatre is in the subsidized section and venues like the National Theatre, the Donmar Warehouse and the Royal Court. But, to me, Drowsy's fate underlines the different meanings of camp and irony between Broadway and the West End - particularly as they apply to musicals.\n\nWhile retaining all the cleverness and warmth of the Broadway show, the London production has been retooled for British consumption. Not only have the setting of the show and its jokes been changed, but its very texture is now a lot similar to an English pantomime than a frothy Broadway musical. In the title role, Paige is, theatrically speaking, closer to a Dame in a panto than the lush, Dorothy Parker-like figure from the roaring twenties she's meant to be. It's a delicious turn from Paige, but ultimately, this version of camp feels more like pandering than cultural acclimatization on the director's part.\n\nTo me, the show is and always has been about the golden age of the American musical. To succeed, it has to deliver the show within a show (the fake 1928 musical, \"The Drowsy Chaperone,\" that comes to life as the narrator simply known as Man in Chair plays the cast recording) with all the \"gaiety\" of the real thing. The London production attempts something different and succeeds on these terms but you can't help wondering if this Canadian show should have kept its Americana intact in Britain? The three countries may share the same language but cultural differences between each side of the Atlantic are huge and, as The Drowsy Chaperone learned the hard way, sometimes unbridgeable.\n\nStill, there's no reason to think of the London production as anything other than a bump in the amazing journey of The Drowsy Chaperone. I suspect the show will revert back to its Broadway sensibility when it launches its massive North American tour with a stop in Toronto's Elgin Theatre as part of the brand-new Dancap Productions subscription season. What a homecoming that will be: back to the city that gave it birth and the theatrical milieu that made it thrive."
