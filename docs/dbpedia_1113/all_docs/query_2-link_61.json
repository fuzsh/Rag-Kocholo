        "text": "With music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison and a book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar, “The Drowsy Chaperone” is a multi-Tony award-winning musical with its original Broadway run starting in April 2006. Written as an homage to the American musicals of the Jazz Age, the story revolves around The Man in Chair, a mousy, agoraphobic Broadway fanatic who, in an effort to cure his ennui comes home every night and listens to a recording of his favorite 1928 musical comedy, “The Drowsy Chaperone.” As he listens to the record, the musical comes to life around him.\n\nGeneral admission ticket prices are $20 per person for adults, $16 per person for senior citizens and active military, $14 per person for non-UWF students and UWF faculty and staff, and $7 for high school students. UWF students are admitted free with their Nautilus cards.\n\nTickets can be purchased at the CFPA Box Office, Building 82, by calling 850.857.6285, or online at uwf.edu/tickets.\n\nDue to adult subject matter, this show may not be appropriate for all audiences."
