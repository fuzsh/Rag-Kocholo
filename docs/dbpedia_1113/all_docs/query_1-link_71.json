        "text": "“The Drowsy Chaperone” opens July 15 – the latest production of Sonoma Arts Live is a parody of 1920s American musical comedies, and won five Tony Awards for its 2006 Broadway production.\n\nSonoma Arts Live’s production is directed by Michael Ross, with musical direction by Sherrill Peterson.\n\nThe play, with book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar and music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, begins at the home of a theater-loving gentlemen, who puts on a record of his favorite musical, “The Drowsy Chaperone,” from 1928. “As the record plays, the musical comes to life on stage and he wryly comments on the music, story and actors, and sometimes even joins in the fun,” according to a synopsis from Sonoma Arts Live."
