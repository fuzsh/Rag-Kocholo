        "text": "The character is called Man in Chair. Dressed in corduroys and a cardigan, he greets the audience from his drab apartment, says he is feeling blue and puts on his favorite original cast vinyl LP, Gable and Stein's 1928 hit The Drowsy Chaperone. - Who is this guy? And what kind of musical is this? - \"The audience is catching him on a dramatic night,'' says Jonathan Crombie, who plays Man in Chair. \"He's to the point where he has to wrap himself in this little apartment, wrap himself in the cardigan and let himself be wrapped up in this little musical world that he can imagine and bring to life.'' - Soon after the needle drops on a bubbly overture, the album comes to life and the apartment is transformed into a Broadway stage, with singers and dancers emerging from the refrigerator, the windows and the Murphy bed to perform an extravagant production number about a wedding. - The Drowsy Chaperone, which opens this week at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center, is an homage to the Broadway musical as many fans first experience it: listening to original cast albums and watching old movie musicals on TV. - Lisa Lambert was one of those fans, growing up in Toronto in the 1960s and '70s, listening to her mother's albums of My Fair Lady, Damn Yankees, Guys and Dolls, Fiddler on the Roof and other shows. \"I remember playing Camelot over and over until I memorized it and couldn't stand it anymore and moved on to the next one,'' she says.\n\nYears later, Lambert put all those childhood hours by the stereo to good use. She and Greg Morrison won a Tony Award for the score they wrote for The Drowsy Chaperone, the made-up \"musical within a comedy'' that Man in Chair loves and comments upon throughout the show.\n\n\"I spent all my free time as a kid listening to original cast recordings and reading the plot summaries on the backs of album covers,'' she says. \"I was kind of like the Man in Chair character.''\n\nAlso influencing The Drowsy Chaperone were movie musicals like Love Me Tonight, a 1932 classic with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, and the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies. Margaret Dumont, perennial foil to the Marx Brothers, was the inspiration for Mrs. Tottendale, hostess of the musical's wedding party.\n\n\"Margaret Dumont would often host parties and you weren't even sure why she was hosting them,'' Lambert says. \"Like in Animal Crackers, there's a party happening at her house, and you're never totally sure why it's at her house. In our show we have this hostess and there's really no reason why she's hosting the party except that she's rich.''\n\nMrs. Tottendale (played by Georgia Engel of The Mary Tyler Moore Show) is one of many stock characters in The Drowsy Chaperone. The cast also includes the bride and groom, a gorgeous ingenue and a dashing oil magnate heir; a tap-dancing best man; a preening Latin Lothario; a cigar-chomping producer and his girlfriend; a couple of gangsters disguised as pastry chefs; and an aviatrix named Trix. Then there's the title character, the \"drowsy'' (i.e., tipsy) chaperone to the bride, who sings what Man in Chair calls \"Basically ... a rousing anthem about alcoholism,'' As We Stumble Along.\n\nA long history\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone had a long and winding road to Broadway. It started out in 1998 as a wedding party skit by Lambert and others from the Toronto theater and comedy scene spoofing the marriage of their friends, Janet Van De Graaff and Robert Martin (the names of the bride and groom in the musical). The show, with a book by Martin and Don McKellar,expanded from that skit in the back room of a comedy club to a production at the Toronto Fringe Festival, on to a pair of commercial runs in Toronto, a U.S. tryout in Los Angeles and then Broadway, where it closed at the end of 2007 after 674 performances.\n\nLambert, Martin and McKellar have known each other since high school, all graduating in the class of 1981 at Lawrence Park Collegiate in Toronto. Crombie, whose father was mayor of Toronto in the 1970s, graduated from the same school a few years later.\n\n\"We just lucked out. The Drowsy Chaperone kind of feels like the grand finale to a whole lot of stuff we were doing in Toronto,'' Lambert says. She and her friends were also involved with the Second City comedy troupe and Slings and Arrows, the Canadian TV series (shown on the Sundance Channel) that brilliantly portrays a dysfunctional Shakespeare festival with more than a passing resemblance to the real-world Stratford Festival.\n\nA common thread\n\nSendups of musical theater, from Dames at Sea to The Producers, are nothing new. What distinguishes The Drowsy Chaperone is the impeccably crafted score of the show-within-the-show and the framing device of the Man in Chair.\n\nLambert, who has done a lot of acting and comedy (she played the Drowsy Chaperone in the wedding party skit), mainly contributes lyrics and melodies to the songs she writes with Morrison. \"I'm not a great musician,'' she says. \"I have a little piano background, but a lot of my songwriting comes from instinct and years of absorbing musicals. Usually I'll do a rough outline of a song and be able to sing it, but it has to be musicalized a little better. Greg is a trained musician, so he's able to figure the chords out and give it a stronger musical base. So we're a good combination.''\n\nThe part of Man in Chair, written by Martin (who originated the role and played it on Broadway) and McKellar, was created to be not too much of a musical theater know-it-all, though he offers plenty of snarky opinions.\n\n\"My worry when we started on the show is that it would become a game for the audience to pick up on any mistakes he made about musical theater,'' Lambert says. \"It's more about memory. It's about his emotional state as opposed to how much he knows.''\n\nWhatever the character is about, many in the audience identify. \"So many people come up and say, 'That's me,' because everybody has some weird thing that they listen to or watch or whatever that keeps them going in life,'' Lambert says. \"It isn't necessarily the best thing in the world that they love, but for some reason it works for them.''\n\nThe authors were careful to keep the Man in Chair a bit vague. \"Some people think he's gay, some people think it's not even an issue,'' Lambert says. \"It's more that he doesn't seem to be fully comfortable or in tune with himself. There's a lot of his life he's sort of blocked out and not really addressed, and it's up to the audience to fill in the blanks.''\n\nNor does Lambert think the role is gender specific. It could be Woman in Chair.\n\n\"It really could be anybody in the chair,'' she says. \"There are times when I really want to jump in and be in that chair. Just because it's so much my personality.''\n\nJohn Fleming can be reached at fleming@sptimes.com or (727) 893-8716.\n\nThe musical opens Tuesday and runs through Jan. 20 at Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center, Tampa. $32.50-$72.50 plus service charges.
