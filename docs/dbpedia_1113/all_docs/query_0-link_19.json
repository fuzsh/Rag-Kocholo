        "text": "January 29-February 20, 2011\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Lisa Lambert & Greg Morrison; Book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar\n\n“An ingenious show-within-a-show construct helped The Drowsy Chaperone win the Tony for best book in 2006. But beyond the clever staging, this homage to bygone musicals â€” the ones with overtures, rousing numbers, and, of course, a happy ending â€” is filled with all of those things. Itâ€™s an uproarious production that revels in playing with its construct. And itâ€™s selling well, so get your tickets now if you want to be taken away by this highly entertaining production.”\n\n-The Brooklyn Paper\n\n“What a fun zippy show this is, performed by a wonderful cast. Multiple fabulous musical numbers really bring the show to life. An hour and 45 minutes of theatrical joy.”\n\n-Judith Jarosz, nytheatre.com\n\nProducer – Robert Earle Jones for The Gallery Players\n\nDirector – Hans Friedrichs\n\nChoreographer – Christine O’Grady\n\nMusical Director – Kevin Lawson\n\nScenic Design – Jared Rutherford\n\nCostume Design – Ryan J.

Photo by Bella Muccari.\n\nA musical so fizzy, tart and intoxicating, itâ€™ll go straight to your head!\n\nNo, itâ€™s not a vintage â€˜28 Dom Perignonâ€¦itâ€™s The Drowsy Chaperone, a wildly rambunctious and deliciously funny tribute to musical comedies of the Jazz Age.\n\nTake a spin on our narratorâ€™s turntable and dive into the world of madcap musical mayhem and mischief as the cast album of his favorite Broadway show bursts to life in his living room. Itâ€™s the tale of a brazen follies starlet giving up the stage for love, and all the zany guests whoâ€™ve gathered for her wedding, including the gin-soaked chaperone assigned to keep a watchful eye, albeit at half-mast, on this motley crew.\n\nWinner of five 2006 Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, The Drowsy Chaperone embodies the desire in all our hearts to simply be entertained.\n\nWatch our cast and staff talk about the show:\n\nPerformance Schedule:\n\nSaturday, January 29 at 8:00 PM – Opening night – SOLD OUT\n\nSunday, January 30 at 3:00 PM – matinee – SOLD OUT\n\nThursday, February 3 at 8:00 PM\n\nFriday, February 4 at 8:00 PM\n\nSaturday, February 5 at 8:00 PM – SOLD OUT\n\nSunday, February 6 at 3:00 PM – matinee – SOLD OUT\n\nThursday, February 10 at 8:00 PM\n\nFriday, February 11 at 8:00 PM\n\nSaturday, February 12 at 2:00 PM – matinee – SOLD OUT\n\nSaturday, February 12 at 8:00 PM – SOLD OUT\n\nSunday, February 13 at 3:00 PM – matinee – SOLD OUT\n\nThursday, February 17 at 8:00 PM – SOLD OUT\n\nFriday, February 18 at 8:00 PM – SOLD OUT\n\nSaturday, February 19 at 2:00 PM – matinee – SOLD OUT\n\nSaturday, February 19 at 8:00 PM – SOLD OUT\n\nSunday, February 20 at 3:00 PM – final performance – SOLD OUT\n\nPictured: The cast of The Drowsy Chaperone.
