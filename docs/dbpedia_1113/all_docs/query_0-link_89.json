If you've ever sat in a dark theatre and thought, \"Dear Lord in heaven, please let it be good,\" this is the show for you! To chase his blues away, a modern day musical theatre addict known simply as 'Man in Chair' drops the needle on his favorite LP — the 1928 musical comedy The Drowsy Chaperone. From the crackle of his hi-fi, the uproariously funny musical magically bursts to life on stage, telling the tale of a pampered Broadway starlet who wants to give up show business to get married, her producer who sets out to sabotage the nuptials, her chaperone, the debonair groom, the dizzy chorine, the Latin lover and a pair of gangsters who double as pastry chefs. Ruses are played. Hi-jinks occur. And the plot spins everyone into musical comedy euphoria. Man in Chair's infectious love of The Drowsy Chaperone speaks to anyone who has ever been transported by the theatre."
