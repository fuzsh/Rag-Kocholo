With music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, and book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar, The Drowsy Chaperone is a multi-Tony award winning musical. The show made its Broadway debut in April 2006 and is an homage to the American musicals of the Jazz Age. The Man in Chair, a mousy, agoraphobic Broadway fanatic, seeks to cure his "non-specific" sadness", comes home every night and listens to a recording of his favorite 1928 musical comedy, "The Drowsy Chaperone". As he listens to the vinyl record, the musical comes to life around him.
