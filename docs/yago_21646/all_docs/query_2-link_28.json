        "text": "King Vidor, Raymond Durgnat tells us, \"contained multitudes.\" In a forty-year career that paralleled the growth of American cinema from a charmed adolescence to a tenacious, if tenuous independence, Vidor directed almost every kind of film (comedy, western, war movie, weepie, message film). And many of his pictures (THE BIG PARADE, THE CROWD, SHOW PEOPLE, HALLELUJAH!, OUR DAILY BREAD, NORTHWEST PASSAGE, DUEL IN THE SUN, WAR AND PEACE) remain popular and museum classics.\n\nBut Durgnat, in this book-length study written especially for FILM COMMENT, is talking about something else: the multitude of threads of the American character that are woven into the director and his films. Vidor was a populist and a transcendentalist, a puritan and a sensual lyricist, a conservative and a liberal. In tracing the roots of these complexes and contradictions, Durgnat has in effect written a critical history of American social and political thought. And because Durgnat is equally a film historian and a social critic, his insights into Vidor’s work are as informed as they are idiosyncratic. His extended comparisons of Vidor with virtually every Pantheon director are particularly enlightening. Indeed, like the filmmaker he so admires, Durgnat contains multitudes.—Richard Corliss\n\n* * *\n\n“On the name Vidor, cinema historians have once and for all stuck the label ‘epic poet’. . .” So Etienne Chaumeton writes in Cinema 56, before a long and interesting comparison between Vidor and Gance (“in which, ” one is relieved to discover, “Vidor clearly comes off best.”)\n\nIn film criticism, “epic poet” still suggests a certain simplicity of message that Vidor’s films, however powerful, never quite accept, even on first viewing. And one turns, with a surprised sense of discrepancy, from the libidinous emphases for which certain Vidor films became (perhaps unjustly) notorious, to the stream of gentle, almost pious sentiments and scruples of his autobiography and interviews and to certain suggestive ellipses or intimations therein. The democratic humanism of his films before World War II scarcely accords with his adaptation of Ayn Rand. Complications rapidly appear: not just between films but within them, at their very core.\n\nGiven the standpoint of the social and moral criticism which permeates his work (in exact conformity with his insistence on a moralizing purpose), it’s particularly startling to find his films’ affinities, circumscribed but profound, with certain radical preoccupations. One example: Paul Goodman’s Communitas, with its emphasis on local liberty and a new populism, its declaration of a Jeffersonian anarchism, its faith in the nature of man. Goodman’s statement, “Remove authority and there will not be chaos but self-regulation and natural man,” is a pivot around which Vidor’s thought has also turned, never quite coming to rest.\n\nThe notes which follow try to clarify some of the contradictions and paradoxes—the small print, the finer points, the central conflicts—which comprise a record of Vidor’s love affair with America. It was a love affair variously (or simultaneously) idyllic, recriminatory, indulgent, and imbued with a passion often as quiet and subtle as philosophy. It’s easily assumed that powerful emotions are less discriminating than rational thought. My assumption here has been that certain emotions may be signals from “intuitive” or “preconscious” thought—the kind of thought that seems vague or imprecise only because of a genuine difficulty in verbalizing it.—Raymond Durgnat\n\nThe Big Parade (1925)\n\nVidor saw THE BIG PARADE as the story of an average American, neither overly patriotic nor a pacifist, who goes to war “for the ride and tries to make the most of each situation as it happens.” In the event, the film has to give its hero one of many possible backgrounds rather than another, and its James Apperson (John Gilbert) is one of Vidor’s privileged heroes. An amiable, perhaps spoiled idler (whose social temptation to a lazy languor is symbolized by the hot towels over his face in the barbershop), James has remained perhaps more empty, certainly less responsible, but also spiritually more open than his joylessly industrious brother. If he volunteers upon America’s entry into the war in 1917, it is quite without real commitment, rather bemusedly, as if the brash style of interventionist propaganda sparked off in him some confused yet vivid need to involve and transcend himself. (Perhaps his closest movie cousin, or rather nephew, is Dean Martin in THE YOUNG LIONS, years later).\n\nTo his brother, James loses the girl whose frivolous beauty seemed right for him. And in return he finds, not, like some of his English contemporaries, “the rough male kiss of blankets,” but a more robust and humorous camaraderie. His buddy in the ranks is a riveter and all the exhilarations of social leveling are paraphrased (with, perhaps, a disappointing imprecision) by slightly slapstick brawling. In an estaminet punch-up Apperson ends up hiding in a barrel, an image right out of the rustic side of slapstick.\n\nHis “sentimental education” is extended by his encounter with Mélisande (Renée Adorée) who, as woman, as European, and as working peasant, is his social and spiritual antithesis, and complement. Ignoring all the ooh-la-la and amenable village girls unleashed by WHAT PRICE GLORY?, Vidor honors the “Women of France” who plow the fields in their menfolk’s absence, and are well worthy of comparison with America’s log-cabin matriarchs. When the playboy snatches a kiss she knocks him down, and then picks him up, since her response is an Amazonian common sense rather than a negative puritanism. For this Diana embarrasses the men by catching them naked, and laughs amiably at their embarrassment.\n\nApperson’s mother loves her bad boy, a little too indulgently for his own good, one fears at first; she tempts him to remain a ladies’ man, a mother’s boy. His father seems disapproving of his non-commitment to that Samuel Smiles ethos which prizes industriousness above manliness, and which somehow seems to have crushed the animal spirits of his “good” brother (or, conversely, by which his less spirited and merely “good” brother has allowed himself to be crushed). The mother’s boy rediscovers fraternity, in the true sense, with the riveter; and through the French girl he discovers his “other” father. As her grandfather reads letters from the front, his patriotically sported saber proves so obtrusive that the young doughboy falls backwards off his chair avoiding it. The humor in this profoundly Griffithian scene is on both the nations and the generations.\n\nThe baptism of fire in Belleau Wood can, if one so wishes, be read as the consummation of manhood. Just because war is hell, it is also purgatory, the nitty-gritty initiation by everything an enemy can throw at one. I remember a 1963 audience laughing derisively at what presumably seemed to them no more than an archaically clear-faced American boy marching boldly forward, and enjoying an improbably charmed existence, while the intimations of discomfiture on his countenance signified ham silent acting. Yet the scene may have another meaning. Almost too dazed to be terrified, the unblooded volunteer—one typical of many—is driven on in a cause which isn’t his own.\n\nTwo things keep him advancing, rather than allowing him to scatter and run, as would be logical from a strictly individualist point of view (although already we are beyond a meanly sober logic more characteristic of Apperson’s brother). Real individualism here is a matter of discovering, and proving, moral fiber. And the film concentrates less on the army machine of which Apperson has become part than on his open, soft, anxious eyes, asserting the fears against which Apperson advances. The powers driving him on are of a transcendental order, so long as the word “transcendental” is disassociated from the idealism of the bodiless spirit, and related to some categorical imperative of the life force itself. For Vidor’s emphasis on the physical (the brawls, the baccy chewing, the contrast of hot towels and naked embarrassment) is also an emphasis on the nervous will—or, rather, the spiritual in its animal expression.\n\nEarlier, the untried troops marching along the roads in rigidly orderly columns are attacked by enemy aircraft. They scatter. They re-form. Hesitantly, morale—as a morality—asserts itself, by way of prelude to the march in Belleau Wood itself. The two sequences are anagrams of each other. The earlier, in long shot, stresses the mass, its disruption and reformation. The later, in closer view, emphasizes an individual, and a continuing advance played off against a continuous fear. The first scene features the open road and the open sky; the second brings us into the wood, with the verticals of men and trees. In the first scene, the wounded lie on the road, rocking in pain; in the second, they just fall. The relatively static camera of the first scene becomes a sostenuto tracking in the later. The contrast of elements—of space, of light and shade, of visual tempi—is essentially musical,” and Griffithian. The screw is given a further twist with the enemy’s use of poison gas. After our sensitivities have become attuned to anxious eyes, to flesh (awaiting the bullet), and to forest scents, the men must don respirators. Their eyes become aghast, staring panels of cellophane; their flesh is sealed off under bestial snouts; and before removing them altogether, they sniff the air, apprehensively.\n\nIf this pattern of contrasts seems improbably cerebral for a Hollywood movie of the Twenties, the comparison with Griffith is a useful one. The question can also be approached from the commonsense, or showmanlike, angle. By way of prologue to the march through Belleau Wood, one needs an incident on the same theme, but sufficiently different not to sap the shock of the climax. Hence an episode is devised which will contrast al/ the elements of the climax except the theme. Equally, once the physical atmosphere of the wood has been evoked, the filmmaker seeks a series of physical surprises, in exactly the same way as he might seek a series of dramatic surprises. And, as I shall argue in a little more detail later, the surprise of the “twist” whether in drama or mise-en-scéne— corresponds to the shock in Eisenstein’s meaning of “montage.”\n\nAlthough THE BIG PARADE (like its English counterpart, Anthony Asquith’s TELL ENGLAND) was a little too rapidly assumed by critics to be “anti-war,” Vidor’s comments suggest that its stress on war’s horrors was the precondition of its heroism. And, while one must trust the song and not the singer, the film doesn’t seem to me to imply a tragic-ironic condemnation of the futility of war in general or indeed of that one in particular—albeit it certainly sets its face against cheap heroics, in an engagement which, ten years after the time, many Americans might well have held as readily in respect as the Battle of the Alamo.\n\nAlthough discipline as such is important (Apperson must march off in step with his company), the theme of a “company of buddies”—so carefully worked through the comedy, and kept distinct from the stress on mindlessly tough discipline so prominent after 1945—finds its moral consummation after Apperson’s riveter buddy Slim (Karl Dane) returns from a foray, carrying the tin hats of those whom he has killed (trophies like scalps). There is certainly an admirable exuberance, perhaps even a certain hubris, about Slim’s quiet prowess as a killer. As he lies wounded out in No Man’s Land, the erstwhile playboy is inspired to a compound of self-sacrificial rashness (“Greater love hath no man”) and its antithesis, a revengeful rage. Disobeying orders, Apperson slips out of his trench in an act of insubordination which later became routine in Hollywood military movies, presumably as constituting a guarantee that the hero’s acceptance of authority has not crushed his independent individualism. But the man whom he finds in No Man’s Land is a wounded German—perhaps the man by whom Slim was killed. Apperson’s humanity triumphs over his rage, and the cigarette which he gives his enemy may remind us that the poor little rich boy was taught the rough virility of chewing plugs of baccy by the man whom he set out to avenge.\n\nIn this assertion of human compassion some might see a condemnation of war, others merely a homage to the spirit of the Geneva Convention. And it’s probably worth bearing in mind, cynically no doubt, that a substantial proportion of American spectators, being of not-soremote German descent, might well, war fever over, appreciate Apperson’s humanity. Before Pearl Harbor, Louis B. Mayer was insistent on showing the captured Luftwaffe pilot in MRS. MINIVER as a “good guy,” forcing William Wyler to argue that if he had two Germans he could show one as a good guy, but since he only had one he ought to be a bad, Nazi one. While it’s possible that Mayer had some dramatic pattern of his own in mind, I don’t think one can dismiss the possibility that his considerations included a concern for German Americans— maybe even a certain isolationism. At any rate, the majority of spectators would presumably admire both the murderousness of Slim and the forebearance of his friend. Here, as later, Vidor’s readiness to appreciate apparently opposite forms of moral expression obscures the extent to which he is also a puritanical moralist. In what sense of the word “puritan” we shall try to be more precise.\n\nSpiritual education always comes expensive; in fact its price is life itself. The war leaves Apperson shorn of a leg and embittered in spirit. “You look fine!” enthuses his dishonest brother. “Oh shut up, you know how I look!” His mother, seeing her mutilated son, weeps. And it is to her honesty that he turns. “Mother—there’s a girl in France…” “You must find that girl!” The gift of truth, the gift of tears, the gift of faith—they belong together, they are his mother’s power. If Apperson once seemed in danger of becoming merely a ladies’ man, it was also because femaleness has that power which his generously impressionable (not crudely “tough”) maleness has the caliber to accept. His manhood now affirmed, and injured, and in the midst of masculine negativity and sycophancy, it is female strength and resolution which revives the life force in him. Her command could seem merely optimistic, but it involves other factors as well: a loving mother’s giving away her son to an “alien” woman; her confidence in “that girl,” which is a maternal, magic prescience; and her sending her son on a quest which requires from him the force to defy his mutilation and despair.\n\nEarlier, Apperson’s regiment moved off from its billet to the front line; and Mélisande, clinging to him, pulled a spare boot from his pack, and was left in the road, clasping the boot to her bosom. This is the first of the three scenes in which marching is asserted against potential disruption. And, given the magic of female love in a world whose romanticism is the fruit of a transcendental vision rather than of a mechanical optimism, it’s perhaps the strength given to that boot by Mélisande’s embrace which—reinforced by the love of a mother too generous to be a rival—gives him the strength to limp back to her. The young Vidor’s romanticism is more optimistic than it will later become, but we might have expected this poet of the earth (fields, desert, swamp) to have made a great deal of death in the trenches. But the predominant theme is marching—the stamp of Anteus forever spurning Mother Earth, yet sustained by her.\n\nObeying, Apperson finds his Mélisande. It’s not easy, and yet it’s as if by magic. As he recognizes her from afar, and hobbles on his crutches towards her over the fields, it is as if a combination of maternal and manly energies had somehow compelled time, space, destiny itself to yield. It is always difficult to judge how artificial a set seemed in its time, and particularly in the emotional context of its time (for the cinema’s entertainment mainstream can fairly be described as hallucinatory, given the readiness with which feeling is expected to override accurate seeing). But it seems to me that here Vidor has emphasized, rather than underplayed, a non-realism for which, in HALLELUJAH! and OUR DAILY BREAD, he will find, by Seventies criteria, subtler and more effective means.\n\nThe conclusion yields its fuller meaning when contrasted to Apperson’s earlier attempt to find her. Half-delirious, he struggles up from his bed, in a church turned hospital, while, behind him, a patient so delirious that he has had to be strapped down seems the symbol of his helplessness and his crazy initiative. But his attempt is futile, and it is not until his return to his mother’s faith and the pseudo-sanity of bitterness that he can find his beloved. The combination of delirium, madness, and a church setting creates an aura of supernatural forces, and the implication certainly seems to be that (whatever their good works) either Christianity or the official, established forms of it are sterile compared with the family magic of mother and son, of two human beings united by blood and sexuality, and somehow compelling the universe to respond with a concession—a miracle. Thus the individual, as linked by love, may prove himself both natural and supernatural.\n\nAnd this seems to me the film’s overall sense, rather than an affirmation of peace and love as against war, which, after all, enabled Apperson to meet his Mélisande. Why go to war? Because it is there—or, rather, because man must not just test but perfect himself one way or another. His absence of rational militaristic enthusiasm may well have arisen as a result of, or functioned as an accommodation of, the isolationist feelings which, in 1917, were sometimes mixed with pacifist inclinations. Thomas Ince’s CIVILIZATION was avowedly anti-interventionist, and it’s tempting to ask whether some such sentiment doesn’t underlie the apotheosis of Griffith’s INTOLERANCE. It would be surprising if isolationism, as a traditional American attitude, never found accommodation on the screen. (And at least one neutral’s film, Holger Madsen’s HIMMELSKIBET [THE SKY SHIP, 1918], from Denmark, strikes me as, on balance, both pacifist and pro-German—not surprisingly, if one considers where its main market was likely to lie.) Insofar as any clear moral about war is concerned, THE BIG PARADE is absolutely ambiguous, and Vidor’s real concern seems to be a man’s need to face risk and danger if he is to grow and yet to remain true to the roots of his strength, his family.\n\nA book about family tensions in American movies is long overdue, but I suspect that the “mother” theme, here as in many American films and songs of the Twenties, is far from being merely a facile exploitation of sentimentality. On the contrary, it attempts a desperately “inspirational” answer to specific social tensions: between immigrant parents and would-be all-American offspring; between traditional peasant or European notions of the family and American individualism; and the accelerated fluidity of American society—notably the “internal immigration” from depressed rural areas to the cities.\n\nYears later (1968), a specifically hawkish and pro-militarist film, YOURS MINE AND OURS, will bring together the only apparently distinct themes of THE BIG PARADE—the family and the armed forces—as when Henry Fonda is flown back from an aircraft carrier off Vietnam for the birth of yet another son. In his documentary MARINES, Francois Reichenbach mentions the vulgar-Freudian hypothesis that, if so many young Americans readily volunteer for harshly disciplined training, it’s in order to assert their manhood against Momism. But film examples apart, it’s obviously schizoid to assume, as in our attacks on sentimentality we too often do, that by becoming part of an army you cease to be your mother’s son any more than you cease to be your wife’s husband; having raised the point one needn’t, I hope, dwell on it. Certainly the triangle (son-mother-toughness) is obsessive in gangster movies (SCARFACE, LITTLE CAESAR, PUBLIC ENEMY, WHITE HEAT), and in the first two films the immigrant theme is absolutely clear. THE BIG PARADE inverts the theme: the American WASP finds a foreign wife.\n\nBut ambiguities remain. Just as Mélisande resembles a log-cabin wife, so the French grandfather, with his saber, resembles a veteran Of the Civil War in a Griffith film. Doubtless Vidor is taking an easy line against an easy assumption that foreigners are either ridiculous or sinful or lacking in true grit. The “foreignness” of Southern tradition affords him a useful common denominator, particularly since he is a Southerner himself; and Vidor’s intermittent interest in “over-privileged” sons may have some autobiographical root.\n\nNot that national differences are altogether forgotten. Just as Slim teaches Apperson to chew baccy, so Apperson teaches Mélisande to chew gum, and maybe there’s a kind of hierarchy of virility here, counterpointed though it is by Slim’s death and by Mélisande’s Amazonian response to a first kiss. Baccy, gum, and kiss are all initiations; and the series of oral acceptances is continued by the cigarette which Apperson gives his wounded enemy—which as a gesture of compassion, of relenting, of valediction, is in a sense a reverse of initiation. Criticism is sometimes too quick to assume that symbols which are all of a kind must point in the same emotional direction. Yet that familiar word “twist” indicates that sudden, subtle changes of direction are well known in dramatic structures. And clearly the same search for quick strong contrasts is applicable at every level of imagery.\n\nThe change from baccy to gum also implies a switch from the rough-and-ready he-man American style to something softer, blander, slicker. Apperson uses the chewing-gum lesson to prelude his successful seduction of Mélisande into a kiss; thus the “pioneer” woman is tricked—and eased—into a loss of integrity which is also a womanly fulfillment. The irony parallels the way Apperson is seduced from his aimless comforts into signing up—by a somewhat callow, fervid propaganda. The irony is, eventually, reversed into faith. It was right for Apperson, and Mélisande, to yield—even if the vulgarity of the means strikes a discordant note.\n\nThis mixture of impressionability and resolution is the moral theme of the film. Apperson doesn’t make much of an issue of commitment to a particular choice: “death or glory,” “make or break,” ‘be a coward or a man,” etc. The alternatives hardly exist for him, and perhaps his closest relatives in the ambit of film culture are Renoir’s elusive corporal, his Captain Georges, and his Captain John in THE RIVER. In terms of persistence against the world and acceptance of it, Apperson comes halfway between the first man and the last; and, like the man in the middle, he is brave, responsive (particularly to the moral authority of the female), decent and dependent.\n\nVidor’s real subject is not so much morality as morale, and an affirmative abandonment to nature-cum-fate. One acquiesces in nature by asserting one’s own nature (and not one’s social ego!) respectfully against nature, yet within it. Interestingly, Vidor and Renoir both show pantheistic tendencies. Both have a reputation as lyricists of sexual love, although their range is wider and they are often critical or ironical about passions, even while respecting them. And the honor which both directors accord moral unself-consciousness suggests that, for them (to paraphrase Keats’ observation about poetry), “if morality doesn’t come as naturally as leaves on a tree, it had better not come at all.”\n\nDespite Hollywood’s subsequent fixation on toughness, Vidor isn’t alone in asserting the need for the “masculine” man’s acceptance of female strength, although critics anticipate the general public’s feeling that Momism is sentimental or positively regressive. Hence THE BIG PARADE is remembered largely as an ‘anti-war” film, and its family-sexual theme virtually forgotten. Yet the latter didn’t seem to me to have dated any more than the comradely brawling. If anything, it seemed fresher, simply because so many films by Ford, Hawks, et al., had done all the variations on the Flagg-and-Quirt bit (a) more lyrically and (b) to death. By 1963 (when I first saw it) the theme of family vitalism, and its style, were old enough to be new. And by 1973 most of Ford’s THE QUIET MAN celebrates its coming of age by looking quite as empty and contrived as the one or two facile passages of Vidor’s film.\n\nIt’s unsurprising that the Belleau Wood sequence has become the best remembered. What surprises, in view of the film’s unevenness, is its power to survive as a whole structure and to move consistently. While, clearly, the better sequences in any film may transform our apprehension of the rest (and vice versa), the discursive structure of THE BIG PARADE might seem to minimize any such effect, and reduce it to one or two anthology pieces best seen divorced from their context.\n\nIts survival of the ravages of time may be partly a matter of Vidor’s Napoleonic luck. The failure of some more dated scenes to involve us is congruent with Apperson’s mixture of partial detachment and his surprise at his own involvement (although, no doubt, the film involved its audiences in its time—earlier, fuller, and with a steadier progression than it does us). Nonetheless, Apperson’s relationship with worlds which at first he finds strange, and to none of which he permanently commits his spirit, remains slightly like Harry Langdon’s. He’s a little outside it, as are we, albeit affectionately. This lucky chance would be inadequate indeed without the unifying effect of two aspects of Vidor’s style.\n\nThe first, deployed most obviously in the Belleau Wood sequence, is what Vidor terms his “favorite obsession” “silent music,” which may be defined as visual rhythms in the sense both of cutting and of the whole orchestration of physical movement—mise-en-scene as well as montage. Such formal, stylistic inventiveness might seem to result in a “lyrical” quality, a simple, easily summarizable feeling. But it is quite as likely to work on the contrasts within the overall feeling, just as an overall emotional tension is often the product of conflict, i.e. contradiction. Thus the depiction of courage requires the vividness of actual or potential fear. We have indicated some aspects of this “alternating current” in contrasting the air attack and the Belleau Wood sequence, and will consider another in discussing the climax of OUR DAILY BREAD.\n\nTHE BIG PARADE owes much of its strength to its director’s combination of tightly controlled tempi, lyrical acting, and strong mise-en-scéne—qualities whose meanings are far from being tautologous to each other. The sense of speed counterpoints (sometimes overrules, sometimes concentrates) that of the acting, while the organization of visual elements often asserts another aspect of experience altogether. Vidor retains and develops the aesthetic of Griffith into what is, in a way, the American counterpart of the Russian silent cinema. The contrast has been stated in terms of Murnau versus Eisenstein; but Murnau isn’t the clearest instance, since the moving camera usually creates a condition intermediate between fast cutting (montage) and visual development within the static shot (mise-en-scéne). In this sense, the Belleau Wood sequence comes closer to the Murnau style, while the air attack is closer to mise-en-scéne (the role of depth of focus in Renoir and Wyler).\n\nThe unself-conscious physical reactions of Griffith’s heroes, of Chaplin and Lillian Gish, find their counterpart in the strong sense of bodies in Eisenstein and Pudovkin—albeit geared to slow peasant solidity rather than the nervous speed which inspired slapstick. Although American cutting soon slows, the slower cutting goes with a brisk narrative pace and relatively fast acting. Conversely, Russian actors tend to be static rather than mobile, partly because the cut tends to fragment (and maybe even arrest) movement within the shot, which mise-en-scéne allows a fuller continuity and blossoming. To take a very simple example, what was called the “Russian cut” would show a man rising from a chair in two set-ups. An eye-level or high-angle shot of the seated man, whose head rises out of frame, followed by a second shot, of the space which he promptly filled. The American preference was normally for a shot sufficiently distant to contain both phases, since, though visually “slower,” it was less distracting (and cheaper).\n\nA second scene is that in which Mélisande clings to Apperson as he leaves for the battlefront. It’s important, of course, that the theme of marching recurs, and that the fondled boot presages the lost leg. But Vidor’s unabashed way with emotion belongs with Griffith and Chaplin rather than with his nearer contemporaries Wellman and Hawks. Ford, like Vidor, also comes between the two; but Vidor comes nearer to the more archaic pole in which strength of feeling is felt to be a natural concomitant of strength—which is implied, and not questioned, by enthusiasm and tears, and which doesn’t really need to be distinguished from weakness by any display of impassiveness or toughness. There is a faint incongruity in John Gilbert’s presence in the barracksroom world; the incongruities are a source of our uncertainty and interest. The film affirms the integrity and solidarity of human existence all the more poignantly because it suggests that it’s only through normally untapped reservoirs of life force, of feeling, of “magic,” that the world’s deeper unity can be asserted against its all-too-obvious incongruities—contrasts, conflicts, and ruptures. Similarly, throughout the thirty years or so when Hollywood normally classified films as men’s films and women’s films, Vidor’s had a curious way of being both at once—possibly because he accepted, quite lyrically, the weaknesses of men and the strengths of women.\n\nApperson never loses his spiritual differences from his comrades, yet his contact is real with his spiritual antitheses—the business-minded brother, the ferocious hardhat, the peasant girl. The film’s discursive structure is appropriate to its eventual, precarious affirmation of a man’s élan vital deepening and consolidating itself by a risky interaction with disparate milieux and values—mother’s love and the trenches, the rich boy and the riveter, responsiveness as both weakness and transcendence. This gives it its extraordinary central position, at a crossroads between the “tough” world of Hawks or Walsh, the male tear-jerkers of Ford, the romanticism of Borzage, the stoic ironies of Sternberg, the sense of rural self-help in Wellman. Vidor’s film becomes a kind of “layman’s progress” through a vitalist world. And the precarious balance of weakness and courage in Apperson’s self-giving and self-withholding is a poignant and daring one.\n\nThe difference of caliber between Vidor and Hawks may be indicated by contrasting THE BIG PARADE with SERGEANT YORK. Hawks’s initially rustic, puritan, pacifist hero makes his private’s progress to an Old Testament doctrine (of picking off the evil Hun from the rear, like duck-shooting) and finally enters the presence, if not of God, then at least of God’s Own Country’s President. But it’s something in Hawks, rather than the requirements of wartime propaganda, which leaves his straightforward conversion story with a sense of emotional problems slickly solved. THE BIG PARADE, only intermittently more perfect in its surface texture, has a profounder movement. In much the same way, Wellman’s PUBLIC ENEMY is built on contradictory ideas, and seems to me far more interesting—and therefore moving—than Hawks’s SCARFACE, whose perfection of atmosphere goes along with a single and simpleminded put-down of a scapegoat for rather more diversified forms of corruption—which is the real reason why Hollywood had such difficulty in stopping its public from admiring even its gangster villains.\n\nIs a narrow lyricism, or a fidelity to the texture of unexamined experience, artistically more valid than a structure sufficiently tension-riddled both to undermine simple, intense, and obvious “moods” and to substitute another kind of excitement? This question still hasn’t been properly debated. Both the partisans of lyricism (those who prefer the Hawks to the Wellman) and the aesthetic structuralists (whose connections with the left might have bred a preference for those structures which involve strong contradictions) tend to assume that ideas and emotions, ideology and lyricism, are separate realms or systems, rather than being closely integrated ones. Another useful example is the curious way in which many of the critics who declare themselves “apolitical” not only resent radical criticism of the status quo, but become uneasy even when political orientations of any kind are so much as noticed. Yet if they were really apolitical they would find radical criticisms altogether acceptable, if only as representing some people’s experiences and feelings.\n\nMy own feeling is that the most valuable works of art allow one neither just a pleasant wallow in one’s favorite emotions nor just a merely intellectual diagram of some thematic circuitry. At any rate, one is likely to do Vidor equal injustice by approaching him either as merely a kind of epic lyricist, devoid of ideas, or as an essentially transcendental thinker who is content to assert simple ideas. For he frequently explores, with a critical fascination, the embroilment of complications and contradictions which is the human lot. Since the critical emphasis has lain on the lyrical Vidor, ours will rest, for once, on the underlying ideas.\n\nThe notion of Vidor the merely emotional lyricist also does scant justice to Vidor the dramatist. For in a sense drama is the conflicts arising when different feelings (or attitudes, or drives) collide and can’t merge. If the self-consciously lyrical dramas of so many Victorian poets flopped, it was because, in their desire to build up the lyrical intensity, they underestimated both the lyrical force of sudden contradiction (the overall feeling of a structure of feelings), and the extent to which the greatest romantic lyrics, like Shelley’s Ode to the West Wind, abound in varied and contradictory emotional conflicts. The drama has already penetrated the lyric, or, rather, generated it. To be sure the lyric can accept or subsume the various elements; it is, as it were, a moment, perhaps a crucial one, in a continuing drama. But, like every other moment of that drama, it includes all the elements of that drama. It is neither an abstraction devoid of conflict nor a sentimental defense against conflict—two attitudes that produce bad lyrics and worse dramas.\n\nThe Crowd (1928)\n\nJohn (James Murray) begins life with an indulgent father who means to give him all the advantages. But with his father’s untimely death comes the great middle-class nightmare so vividly described by George Orwell, and John is precipitated down among the crowd. An obstinate, foolish, and admirable ambition sustains him through his marriage and the birth of a daughter until, as she lies dead, he convinces himself that she is merely sleeping, and tries to quiet the traffic so she won’t awaken. But one can t expect to hush New York. Although Vidor attributes to New York none of the positive cruelty that an expressionist might have underlined, the scene still reads as:\n\n“With all the best will in the world, crowded cities are unneighborly plates.”\n\nDemoralized, John finally acquiesces in his responsibilities, and takes the job as a sandwich man whom he had once, in his ebullient arrogance, thoughtlessly mocked. Dressed as a clown, he sports the legend: “l am always happy because I eat at Schneider’s.” Visiting the cinema, he laughs at a screen clown with frank enjoyment, with neither bitterness nor superiority—and clearly the audience in the film is the audience of the film.\n\nTHE CROWD belongs to an international wave of populist films, if we use populism not in the usual political sense, but in the film one, as being about the petits gens, the lower middle classes and lower. The cycle flourished from just before the beginning of sound until the mid-Thirties, when a mixture of economic stagnation and preparation for war shifted the emphasis different ways in different countries. Some German films—BACKSTAlRS and THE LAST LAUGH, for example—tend to be too quickly subsumed under the label of “expressionism,” their other aspects remaining underrated; and the splendid volume on the German realist cinema by Borde, Buache, and Courtade still hasn’t provoked a widespread awareness of such fascinating films as BERLIN ALEXANDERPLATZ and ASPHALT (which I found briefly reminiscent of Vidor in visual style). Hollywood never overlooked America altogether (vide Gloria Swanson’s comic subway ride in Allan Dwan’s MANHANDLED), and much early Populism may be grouped under the “small town or “rural American” theme; but Paul Fejos’s LONESOME, and Vidor’s THE CROWD and STREET SCENE clearly belong to this international category. French populism remains the best remembered—with Vigo’s L’ATALANTE, Clair’s SOUS LES TOITS DE PARIS and LE QUARTORZE JUILLET, Renoir’s TONI and THE CRIME OF MONSIEUR LANGE, Carne’s HOTEL DU NORD and LE JOUR SE LEVE. For a mixture of excellent and trivial reasons, the same cinematic current was rebaptized “neo-realism” when it resumed after 1945, although Becker’s ANTOINE ET ANTOINETTE indicates the continuance of the earlier strain. The postwar course of populism in the U.S.A. was different altogether, for a variety of reasons, although obvious descendants of THE CROWD include MARTY and STUDS LONIGAN, THE MARRYING KIND and THE APARTMENT, the last featuring an explicit homage to the open-plan office of Vidor’s film.\n\nA particular motif of this screen Populism—the theme of the crowd—pervades the cinema between the wars, for a variety of reasons (ranging from the European recognition that the poor are not a mob, to the internal immigration within America from depressed rural areas to the cities). The sense of the crowd as a dauntingly impersonal mechanism, swelling and subsiding at machine-speed rhythms and routines, inspires Ruttmann’s BERLIN; and its Hollywood equivalents are, amazingly enough, such Busby Berkeley numbers as “42nd Street” in 42ND STREET and “I Only Have Eyes for You” and the chorus-girls’ aubade in DAMES. What Ruttmann and Berkeley have in common is a kind of semi-abstract cinema; indeed, Berkeley qualifies as a Broadway constructivist.\n\nSome parallels between Berkeley and Vidor are intriguing too. What we think of as Berkeley’s “visual choreography” is what Vidor has called “silent music.” And in both directors one finds an inspired, unself-conscious eroticism born of a generalized exuberance. Berkeley ventures into social comment too, in the ‘ ‘Remember My Forgotten Man’ number in GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933. In THE CROWD, Vidor’s camera moves up the office block and then in through one particular window among thousands—a device shared with Berkeley, as well as with René Clair. In THE BIG STORE (Marx Brothers, 1940), Tony Martin’s rendering of “The Tenement Symphony” transposes and trivializes the theme into sentimental operetta terms, only too characteristic of the genre’s decline in wartime Hollywood.\n\nThe subway sequence in MANHANDLED offers a useful example of everyday exasperations translated into gags which, without altogether occluding the real tensions of urban existence, encapsulate them by a crisp humor that may be shaded towards either sarcasm (as in Wilder’s tragicomic THE APARTMENT) or complacency (as in Cukor’s THE MARRYING KIND, which, sensitive as it is, cheerfully renounces the challenge and depth which its scenario renders a theoretical possibility). This common enough entertainment device prevents realism from becoming too drab or depressing. And though it may slightly vitiate some early passages in THE CROWD, it’s given a different quality by Vidor’s characteristic energy, and impregnated by all the latent possibilities established in the prologue. When the shift in tone comes, it is all the more devastating. But, on the whole, the gagsmanship formula serves to underline the temptations into which Vidor’s film doesn’t fall. MGM’s nervousness about it is illustrated by the fact that eight different endings were shot, and that it was offered to exhibitors with the choice of an ending happier than the standard one. Vidor is justifiably proud that only one exhibitor requested it. Perhaps Vidor’s secret is that his sense of human energy gives the most anguishing sequences a scandalous vitality which, as in his postwar excursions into film noir, gives even the unhappy endings their exhilaration.\n\nIn its concern with morale, THE CROWD parallels other films of the Twenties, notably Sternberg’s THE SALVATION HUNTERS, UNDERWORLD, and THE LAST COMMAND (which is also the tale of a social fall: the General becomes a film extra). Such films may well have special reference to the difficulties of survival or cultural shock experienced by immigrants to the city, whether from across the Atlantic or from within America herself. Some aspects peculiar to foreign immigration are touched upon by Chaplin in THE IMMIGRANT, and later by Vidor in THE WEDDING NIGHT (see my remarks in that chapter on “Sons of the Pioneers?” ) and AN AMERICAN ROMANCE.\n\nIn most films, however, the shock of big-city life is usually experienced by a stranger from the virtuously WASP Midwest. Such a hero offers fewer problems of identification, particularly given the sensitivity about foreign origins to which George Seaton attributed the box-office failure of his ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN as late as the early Fifties. Perhaps, too, it was risky to criticize the way of American city life from the point of view of any but that of an unimpeachably American type.\n\nThe white man—redskin love-hate affair so brilliantly described by Leslie Fiedler has, I suspect, more behind it than Rousseauvian romanticism or exoticized homosexuality; it’s also a suitably escapist transposition to problems of blood-brotherships across WASP and ethnic group lines. Conversely, Slim, in THE BIG PARADE, collecting steel helmets like scalps, briefly “becomes” an Indian, prefiguring the coldly efficient Indian machine-gunner in Norman Mailer’s 1942 short story “A Calculus at Heaven.”\n\nIn Vidor’s New York, the ethnic theme is, at least by Seventies standards, conspicuous by its marginality, immigrant tenement childhoods undergoing the usual sea change upwards into a native, middle-class detachment from the city. Which is a comment on the film’s relationship with its New York audiences, rather than an unfriendly criticism of a perspective close enough to Vidor’s own.\n\nIf the expressionist staircase of John’s stuffy childhood home reminds one of something from THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, it is an anachronistic reminder, since an expressionist strain had appeared in Twenties Hollywood. This strain was stirred by a Variety of factors, among them emulation of the German art film and the influence of expressionist theater on all the dramatic arts. It was also partly due, I suspect, to the connections between an individualist Romanticism (whose middle- and lowbrow forms loom so large in the American cinema) and Expressionism—which can be considered as Romanticism shorn of its individualism by Europe’s changing scene, but still concerned with the cosmic in man’s moral spirit, at bay against a stifling and corruptive society. The rough pattern continues when the film noir evolves its tight-lipped expressionism to evoke the city’s pressure on such deviant idealists as Chandler’s Marlowe.\n\nNonetheless, American cinema expressionism remains relatively stylized, for expressionism proper requires an interaction of individual social and philosophical tensions which Hollywood optimism and individualism tend to chill or to restrict to certain mood-states or genres concerning supposedly anomalous subcultures (horror films or private-eye thrillers). A rhapsodic expressionism appears only fitfully, as in THE INFORMER, John Ford’s study of guilt in civil-war-torn Ireland. Welles, in particular, blurs the boundary between lyricism and expressionism by studies of megalomania which can be taken as liberal, but also Nietzschean, criticisms of American ambition and individualism. THE CROWD begins roughly where THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS leaves off, at least insofar as it picks up the theme of the oppressively well-to-do family’s willful young scion being thrown into the world, getting his comeuppance, and learning to muck in.\n\nVidor’s ending evokes, perhaps, more than merely the title of Lon Chaney’s LAUGH CLOWN LAUGH (made in the same year, for the same studio). Chaney was a kind of home-grown Emil Jannings, albeit drawing more from a kind of middle-to-lowbrow Gothic which, like expressionism, was a development out of Romanticism (Dumas, Sue and their successors). In FREAKS, Chaney’s director, Tod Browning, produces what is surely the extreme statement of the possibilities of maintaining one’s morale in situations tempting to paralysis and self-pity. One suspects that Jannings’s angst, like Garbo’s, went increasingly against the developing American trend away from tragedy, which would be resented as “self-pity” if indulged in without some balance of hope, or toughness, or the ingredients of the soap opera. THE CROWD certainly looks like a deliberate rejection of self-pity, its integrity lying in the extent to which it indulges it before the hero rallies his forces. (One wonders if, just as Billy Wilder remembered the office for THE APARTMENT, so Preston Sturges remembered Vidor’s film for the conclusion of SULLIVAN’S TRAVELS, whose ironies are exhilaratingly abrasive rather than inspiring.)\n\nWhile Welles is fascinated by a gigantesque life force in hollowness or decay, and presents attained success as somehow monstrous, Vidor is more likely to celebrate that normal parental love which would bestow all the advantages upon its children. The ebullience of the film’s father is reflected in his prosperous station, normally enough, given a Samuel Smiles optimism about worldly success. And the son shows the same energy and resilience as well as an arrogance, which may be a flaw but is a normal and not unlikable one. Struck by misfortune and then tragedy, that ebullience fulfills itself in a philosophic acceptance which is a profounder spiritual fulfillment—and “inspirationalist” rather than “reformist” in that it all but explicitly rules out the jealousy, bitterness, sadness, or protest which other artists might feel appropriate. But this ultimate optimism is achieved after too much tragedy to be even briefly complacent; and as Professor Bosanquet puts it, “Only that optimism is worth its salt which can go all the way with pessimism and arrive at a point beyond it.” It’s easy to see why Vidor’s affirmation should have meant so much to Hollywood’s most scintillating cynic.\n\nIt’s a tribute also to Vidor’s daemon that, at a glance, he should have recognized his lead actor in James Murray, an inexperienced extra whose life story exemplifies a systematic negation of Vidor’s philosophy—with his defensiveness, his apathy, his self-destructive drift to a bum’s condition. It is as if something in his soul never recovered from the lowest point of John’s depression. It would be highly paradoxical to cite the negation of a film’s philosophy by its leading actor as an enhancement of its authenticity. Perhaps their common factor is nothing more definite than a certain recklessness, to which alternative courses were open. Perhaps, too, it was this which Vidor, most physical of directors, recognized at a glance, just as he insists. This critic agrees that love at first sight is not just a possibility but a natural recognition of everything that body and gesture can reveal about a mind. THE CROWD achieves a delirious integrity of pain which isn’t merely a spiritual negativity; and, in so doing, the film is rare in an already too rare genre.\n\nShow People (1928)\n\nSHOW PEOPLE was ostensibly produced by Marion Davies—i.e., by MGM for William Randolph Hearst, Citizen Kane to some. Vidor, stuck with a stage play which he couldn’t bear to finish reading, decided to draw a little inspiration from the career of Gloria Swanson. His Peggy Pepper (Marion Davies) begins as a butt for custard pies, rises to greater dignity as Patricia Pépoire, and is recalled to her down-to-earth senses when Billy Boone (William Haines), the actor whom she left toiling at the B-features treadmill, catches her in the face with a custard pie which, in view of Hearst’s objections, became instead “a forceful stream from a syphon bottle.”\n\nThe film historians’ emphasis on the more stylized forms of silent comedy (slapstick or Lubitsch) has inclined to eclipse SHOW PEOPLE and its ilk—the straightforward comedy which dips good-naturedly but not unpointedly into satire and near drama. (Cukor’s IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU affords a more recent example.) While the Hollywood setting provides interest and an aura of glamour, it remains (pointedly no doubt, in view of the wide-spread contemporary criticism of Hollywood’s immorality) a place in which the usual moral flaws exact their usual retribution, or forgiveness.\n\nThe matter is pointed by an anti-satirical, anti-Pirandellian scene where, at the MGM stars’ table, MGM’s stars all behave just like their screen selves. The tautology is too evident not to have a hint of deadpan irony, as when Marion Davies as Peggy Pepper stares at Marion Davies as Marion Davies, and is suitably impressed. The irony is democratic also, of course. When Billy mocks the romantic kiss in BARDELYS THE MAGNIFICENT (which Vidor had directed two years earlier), Vidor isn’t criticizing him for it or implying sour grapes any more than he’s agreeing that it’s a reasonably down-to-earth point of view.\n\nAspiring film actors wait outside the casting director’s office, all slumped, patient or passive. But spunky Peggy and her pa step right up to the hatch, won’t take no for an answer, and do their stuff. It’s all very Harold Lloyd in principle, except that, by a nice irony, their stuff’s as bad as could be. Her demonstration of different emotions—with its resourceful use of an unfolded handkerchief to correspond to a cut, and the casting-office hatch as a close-up frame—is such a mixture of the ingenious and the awful that the casting clerk can’t but stare, boggle, laugh, and let her in. Life has its winners and its losers. Talent without initiative is nothing, whereas initiative without talent has at least a chance of proving itself to be something it didn’t know it was (i.e. awful enough to be amusing) and gradually becoming good enough for Hollywood hokum. For Capra’s slickness and Cukor’s fluid warmth, Vidor substitutes a deliberateness and an energy from which a certain placid ruthlessness emerges. A sufficiently trenchant irony (Peggy and her father, each lost in a private, disparate style of pretension) also has a quality of quiet patience, almost gentleness, as if no energy and enthusiasm could thrive without a certain self-centeredness. They involve sins which are natural enough, and so can be purged more readily and naturally than meanness and other twists. In the end, inspiration and illusion are heads and tails—a matter not so much of morality as of a life force whose roots go deeper than morality as human beings can frame it.\n\nCertainly, pretentiousness is the chief of Hollywood’s occupational hazards, and is the vice of Peggy’s courage; this corresponds to the callowness which is the debased form of John’s eventual resilience in THE CROWD. The line between an occupational hazard and criticism of a system (creative or social) is bound to be somewhat hazy, but Vidor’s interest centers on the individual’s response. Indeed, the suggestion here is that social criticism is, if not altogether irrelevant, at least secondary, so long as the system is free enough to allow individuals their choice, including that of opting out. Perhaps, in the postwar period, Vidor’s concern moves nearer to social criticism, without quite arriving at it. But the youthful Vidor’s emphasis is on the way in which life at every level offers its protections against pretentiousness. The commensalism of the stars’ table is one; Vidor’s affable ironies about BARDELYS THE MAGNIFICENT are another. And: “Hey, Billy, leave the sob squad and come jump off a rock.” Billy is ready enough to replace the exhausted stuntman and stand-in for Toni, the spaghetti-house waiter turned delicate star. Of all SHOW PEOPLE’s characters, only the comic is consistently himself. And Vidor’s affable ironies about BARDELYS aren’t illogical. For, the exigencies of professionalism apart, there is a deeper synthesis, akin to that underlying THE CROWD’s John looking and laughing at the clown which is” his degradation. If THE BIG PARADE ends in an affirmation, it certainly is not one of romanticism without knockabout, of buddy love against mother love, of Apperson’s compassion without Slim’s expertise at killing.\n\nWhen Peggy’s mutation into La Pépoire separates her from her lowly and sensible Billy, they bid adieu against back-lot scenery. The apparent innocence of their sexual relationship thus far is an acceptable convention, which Vidor shows no signs of wishing to undermine by even so much as a wink and a nod or a fancy-dress party sequence, let alone one of those verb. sap. fadeouts on a big close-up kiss—which meant as much or as little as each spectator chose, but certainly evoked the swooning sensations of the ellipsis in “Their lips met…” Surely the man who can admire Mélisande’s Amazonian intransigence in The Big Parade can also admire the calm, unstrained relationship of a couple whose feelings for each other exist calmly alongside a kind of rich yet latent sensuality. (A corresponding patience is evoked in Renoir’s Les Cahiers du Capitaine Georges.) And something of the same calm appears in Billy’s conspicuous lack of envy or resentment at Peggy’s success, although it is her success which parts them. This absence of resentment in conspicuous enough, I think, to strike those spectators who don’t get around to thinking of it as a corollary to the conclusion of THE CROWD, or relating it to the constructive faith of the bad girl’s mother-figures in DUEL IN THE SUN and RUBY GENTRY. It’s a crucial moral affirmation. In his way, Billy continues to love his Peggy, he doesn’t pine, and this resilience is managed in a way that hasn’t the coldness of the “cool.”\n\nVidor also manages the rather daunting task of poking fun at slapstick, a feat achieved thanks to his sensitive eye for physicality. (The jumps which the cops do as they run are just a bit too deliberate, too heavy.) A similar nuancing of comic business occurs when Peggy, having been brought to her senses, continues the funny business in a manner which isn’t exactly reverent but is imbued with a quality of spiritual liberation. In an earlier scene, the director instructs her, “Don’t anticipate,” and we anticipate her anticipating, which is a neat and subtle twist.\n\nAn amazing comic chase, where everything runs along including a laid-out corpse, anticipates the more Boschian flights of Tex Avery (although this was, of course, the era of the great Ub lwerks and other crazy cartoonists). Although Vidor is hardly remembered as a comic director, SHOW PEOPLE’s smooth nuances enable it to be seen forty-five years later with very little “making allowances,’ even of the intuitive sort which one practices unconsciously—and it whets one’s appetite for all those other early Vidors which weren’t remembered by that most unreliable of oracles, the critical consensus.\n\nHallelujah! (1929)\n\nZeke (Daniel L. Haynes) lives with his mother’s family in a ramshackle one-room hut in South Carolina. When he goes up-river with his younger brother to sell the year’s cotton crop, Zeke meets up with Chick (Nina Mae McKinney), who rapidly persuades him to gamble the family’s money away to her lover Hot Shot (William Fountaine). Zeke won’t let his family be robbed so easily, even when Hot Shot, who isn’t all that anxious for a showdown, pulls a gun. But Zeke ‘s very courage is one of the factors that get his younger brother killed, and he returns to the village with his body. Plunged into an ecstasy of grief and guilt, he discovers a vocation as revivalist preacher. Chick comes to sneer and finds herself stirred; but after Zeke has baptized her by total immersion in the river, the two elope, Zeke finding work in a sawmill. Chick is bored by her day-long solitude and her man ‘s poverty and fatigue, and abandons him when Hot Shot returns for her. Zeke pursues them; the carriage sheers off a forest road; Zeke throttles Hot Shot; and Chick, injured in the crash, dies in his arms. Zeke serves his prison sentence and returns to his family—all passion spent, all crime purged, his conscience cleansed, strumming his banjo.\n\nThis long-cherished project of Vidor’s could only be realized when the advent of sound persuaded MGM to gamble on the popularity of spirituals and jazz as the film’s musical accompaniment. So there’s much to be said for John Kobal’s contention that it’s really a musical. While I’d argue that it is and it isn’t (since the music accompanies rather than expresses most of the climaxes), its story is clearly a progenitor of Hollywood’s sideline in Negro religiosity (GREEN PASTURES, CABIN IN THE SKY) on the one hand, and sexual operettas à la CARMEN JONES and PORGY AND BESS on the other.\n\nThe cotton-picking Negroes, contented on their little patch of land, don’t carry Uncle Tom overtones, for Vidor celebrates the same life style for the enterprising white community of OUR DAILY BREAD. This film’s contrast of rustic frugality and slick cheaters corresponds to the city-country dichotomy featured in innumerable American films (from WOMAN OF THE WORLD through SUNRISE and MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, right on down to its pointed rebuttal in MIDNIGHT COWBOY), and featured more consistently in Vidor’s work than most. Here, certainly, the film affirms the values of the family, the land, the rural community, and (at least in its emphasis on diligence, frugality, hard work, and family individualism) the Puritan ethic.\n\nBut things aren’t quite so simple. Vidor, interviewed by Positif, described the film as a contrast between sex and religion, and a “struggle” between good and evil. But interview remarks can’t always be taken as definitive, for a variety of reasons. This description implies a far less interesting intrication of factors than that given in his autobiography: namely, his sympathetic interest in the southern Negroes whom he knew as a youth—not only in “the sincerity and fervor of their religious expression,” but also ‘ ‘the honest simplicity of their sexual drives,” such that “the intermingling of these two activities seemed to offer strikingly dramatic content.” And I would certainly agree with the Catholic critic Henri Agel that, ferocious as Vidor’s film is, its impression is of an unleashing of elemental forces rather than of evil in its fundamentalist senses. Charles Barr sees Vidor’s film as a genuine tragedy—a conflict between two rights rather than right and wrong.\n\nIt’s true that the scenario is dominated by an obvious moral polarity, family affection vs. an apparently passionate sexuality. For Agel, the “tragic flaw” of Negro vitality is a volatility of all passions, good and bad, so that Chick, Zeke, and perhaps even Hot Shot become, through the very strength of their passions, the childlike instruments of an evil which remains beyond and outside them. 2 It would be surprising if Vidor saw a specifically racial trait here. Emotional intensity characterizes most of his principal characters, and neither Slim the hardhat in THE BIG PARADE nor Colonel Rogers in NORTHWEST PASSAGE proves any less remorseless than his Negro blood brother. Zeke’s revenge situation is crucial to Vidor’s morality—revenge being both a natural impulse and a destructive one, and of varying degrees of legitimacy depending on its social context. Accepted as a moral duty in Wild West movies, its moral permissibility in a backwoods context in the\n\nTwenties is bound to be less clear-cut than the legal disallowance of it. And a certain ambivalence about it is natural and normal enough, not least on one who, like Vidor, combines individualism and a sense of spontaneous community. Pity and self-control, as countervailing factors to the impulse for revenge, are also universal moral matters for Vidor, not racial ones—a point strengthened by the ferocity of Jewel, the white preacher, in RUBY GENTRY, as well as by a parallel infatuation in OUR DAILY BREAD. Vidor is clearly right in assuming that Zeke will retain our sympathies despite his crime.\n\nThe moral might seem purely conventional, except that our sympathies are not so much split as doubled between an eroticism which is at least a deeply moving counterfeit for passion, and a religious vocation which, being a product both of family grief and of frustrated infatuation, is equally a counterfeit for the deeper, everyday piety represented by Zeke’s family and community. Forty years later, Vidor saw the film again and found Zeke’s vocation admirable, as a positive reaction to suffering. This admiration is evinced in the film itself, although the story line continues by suggesting that the revivalist vocation is somewhat hysteric and that the family represents a more stable human effort. It is, of course, an open question as to whether this is a general statement about religion on Vidor’s part, or simply what’s best for Zeke. But the repudiation of narrow and self-conscious religion, as against human participation, seems implicit in some of his other films.\n\nThat this involves something very different from Hays Code piety is suggested by Zeke’s crime passionel and its psychological consequences (or inconsequences). As Chick and Hot Shot speed away into the forest in their horse-drawn carriage, Zeke blasts away at them with his shotgun, as if ready, in his rage, to risk killing the girl whom he might have felt he wanted to rescue. His pursuit on foot of a horse-drawn carriage could be hopeless, were his terrible willfulness not lending wings to his feet, for he runs with almost magic speed. (One suspects that Vidor indulged, however slightly, in fast motion effects, just as he did at the end of OUR DAILY BREAD.) Thus Zeke is gifted with a superhuman, inspired effort of the kind that compels fate (and corresponds to Apperson’s limping pilgrimage after Mélisande).\n\nZeke’s “prayer” is answered (by a ferocious Old Testament God?). The carriage sheers off the road, and though Chick lies injured, he leaves her lying where she is, while he attends to Hot Shot. At this excited moment, one is more likely to notice Zeke’s putting hatred before concern than to think of some longrange rationalization (e.g. Hot Shot, the snake who might creep off, is the demon lover who is Chick’s homme fatale, so killing him might be freeing her). All the same, it’s doubtful if Vidor is criticizing the indiscipline of rage more than he’s allowing us to admire a human and moral rage which, however ambivalent or hysterical, (1) would be justified in Western and hillbilly dramas, (2) is a crime passionel, and (3) is a passionate hubris rather than a subhuman or an inhuman response to a man whose own violence was largely responsible for Zeke’s brother’s death as well.\n\nIt seems likely that Vidor’s ambivalence (the assertion of conflicting values between which Zeke is torn) is not a criticism of Zeke but a condition of the scene’s pity and terror—not least that terror of conflicting guilts and pities which drives too many of us to simplistic moral codes. Zeke, like an agent for the Old Testament God, is, in retaliation, both just and unjust. Hence the scene’s terrible exhilaration. For anguish and satisfaction—which logically might seem to mitigate each other, to create a negative feedback—can also be so patterned as to produce a positive one, and escalate into a passionate acceptance of opposites, a “marriage of heaven and hell.” And from this vicious circle Zeke emerges, by the boldest of twists, his crime expiated, his soul freed, his loyalties renewed. Also startling is the completeness of his emancipation from an attachment which one can never believe was merely sensual, and the exuberance with which he returns to a future of domesticity and toil.\n\nIt retains a certain ambiguity, since the prison sentence asserted by the narrative is denied by the cinematic continuity. We’re told that so many years of jail gave Zeke a chance to come to terms, perhaps with remorse and morality. But what we see is an almost insolently carefree murderer returning to the bosom of his family to live happily ever after. Prison couldn’t break him either. Thus a hypothetical moral chastisement is denied by our experience of the last of a series of dramatic reversals. Rapid and strong, they maintain an ambiguity that must be distinguished from melodramatic imprecision. Is Zeke’s apparent absence of remorse childish? or childlike? or hysteric? or maintained by an antisocially puritancial fury? or a confidence in God’s forgiving crimes passionels? or conscientiously justified? or insolently unrepentant? A variety of possibilities dance in our minds; the last three loom largest in mine. Equally, Chick’s dying cry (“Oh Zeke, I’m broken in two!”) generates tension for its alternative possibilities. Is this her feminine wheedling or her dying pain?\n\nNor is this ambiguity resolved by the immediately succeeding surprise: the style of her dying is such that, as Agel notes, she seems “washed of all perversity at the moment of quitting the earth, and filled with a childlike terror.” (We will see the ambiguity in Lewt’s manner of dying in DUEL IN THE SUN.) The moral underpinnings here seem to me to be both an almost amoral transcendentalism (freed of ego, her energy becomes pure) and a maintained morality (death is terror because she is selfish). One says “because she is selfish” rather than “because she has sinned.” Perhaps man’s Original Sin, wished on him by his body’s isolation rather than by its desires, is the uncertainty of solitude, which only a transcendental sense of oneness can overcome. Thus, even deathbed terror is deprived of all those overtones which, whether Puritanical or Catholic, emphasize being taken to account for acts. By the process of dying, Chick is forgiven, and freed.\n\nEqually subtle is Zeke’s fall from his preacherhood. For a question arises. Why shouldn’t he marry Chick, and carry on preaching? She could play the part of a minister’s wife while his vocation affords her, as presumably it might, the excitement and the money she requires. No doubt there are very real obstacles in her scandalous past, her relationship with Zeke’s brother’s killer (so far as his family is concerned), and her fixation on city-slicker pressures. All this enables the incompatibility of his infatuation and his vocation to pass without question. But such incompatibilities, given Vidor’s sense of sturm-und-drang, might exist only to be overcome.\n\nThe real obstacle is indicated by the details of Zeke’s succumbing, which reveals to them two key factors: her absolute dependence on immediate sensual excitements, and Zeke’s moral weakness. Her “bad faith” during her conversion is not of a gross and obvious kind. Ambivalent as is the ecstasy of her cries as Zeke dips her in the waters of baptism, her impressionability is not a kind that we can easily or contemptuously disown. But when he succumbs to her provocations, in a forest, without question of marriage, his reckless acquiescence exposes his sense of his moral unworthiness, and he unhesitatingly abandons a vocation which less honestly spontaneous souls might have continued to affect. Zeke’s moral integrity is all the more remarkable given the notorious willingness of revivalist preachers, black and white, either to enjoy the consolations of sistren so deeply moved that their feelings transcend fundamentalist prohibitions, or to tolerate hypocrisies which are no more serious for being sexual than those with which the more decorously established churches so depressingly contrive to coexist.\n\nUp to a point, Chick expresses a city-slicker treachery, improvidence, and greed (to contrast with rural diligence and thrift) such that her and Hot Spot’s death is a case of the heathen being smitten hip and thigh—both excused by their background and predestined by it to a nasty end. But Chick expresses a kind of truth also. Her conversion involves a “bad faith” of a subtler kind than mere pretense, and it involves something which isn’t quite bad faith at all. An important element in Chick’s capitulation is the fact that she who came to mock the pious is suddenly the only “sinner” who hasn’t repented, which puts her in a position of acute social embarrassment. And Zeke’s rhetorical power and presence is compounded by the exultation of a whple community, a kind of meta-family, making her a little child again.\n\nIt might be said that Chick is driven by herd feeling and sensuality (two bad reasons) to a conversion which (because they are bad) ends tragically. But are they so unequivocally bad? What is community, in the deepest sense, without them? So, if secular rather than sacred reasons inspire Chick’s quasi-conversion, they are also reasons as positive and human as those that inspired Zeke’s vocation; and her confusion is just as honest as his. The cries called forth by her feigned (or sincere, or genuinely ambiguous, or naturally overdetermined) sensations of regeneration by grace, in Zeke’s arms, become the ecstatic wails of love, of surrender, and—by no very great stretch of the imagination—orgasm. For sensuality lurks in the very temple of religion, perhaps because each plunges its roots so deep into human nature as to draw its strength from the other. Which is why Vidor’s solution becomes family affection.\n\nBut Chick isn’t the only woman in HALLELUJAH! whose inspiration becomes confusion. A middle-aged woman is overcome by hysteria and has to have a bucket of water flung in her face by two deacons, who are standing ready for just this everyday emergency. This “anti-baptism” is also a touch of comic relief, but, like much comic relief, it hints at a lifelong, frustration of instinct by a harsh world. These purificatory immersions—erotic or comic—amidst meadowland, contrast with Zeke’s murder of Hot Shot in marshy forest.\n\nAs the buckets of water may remind us, any revivalist preacher is aware of the ambivalence and instability of the all-too-human emotions involved in the conversion experience. So Chick is as much a victim of seduction by the whole revivalist situation as Zeke was of her sexual presence. His ministry abounds in images which one may possibly find appropriate to the simplicity of his flock, but which one may also find cheaply rhetorical (seductive), or more akin to show business than soul-saving. Thus Zeke rides on an ass, surrounded by children robed in white. This GREEN PASTURES-type production is immediately appealing, but I rather hoped Zeke would prefer a more modestly and honestly committed and physical human involvement.\n\nThis is not to dismiss his evangelical style as gratuitous or merely a sham. The whole situation of the river baptism in front of the congregation expresses, or counterfeits, the values of family, community, and inspiration which are the film’s other moral pole. They find their most stable form and their most beautiful expression in the overcrowded, patriarchal shack, when Mammy takes each of her younger children on her lap, in turn, and sings them to sleep. The promptness of their response isn’t just a gag (though it is that too, of the gentlest kind); it’s also evidence of a magic power to bestow contentment and a magic generosity going far beyond the grasp of jealousy. Man’s real God is his earthly parents, and they’re black—she’s black—and there’s enough love for all their children to be soothed and content. When Zeke “rocks” Chick on his knee into the river of salvation, he is touching on the same emotions in her, emotions which only a real family, and an evolution into the parental role, can satisfy.\n\nMammy adopts a friend’s daughter, Missie Rose, “as her own daughter” (in a sidelong reference to the broken family patterns so common since slavery), so that Zeke can grow up alongside her, come to love her, and marry her. (The parallel with Mrs. Apperson’s command, and with the direct family continuity, is clear. And so, perhaps, is that with the incestuous rage of Ruby Gentry’s brother). Later, Rosie sings Zeke to sleep, as his mother had done for his younger siblings. And, on losing him, she clings to his knees, or searches, wailing, for him, through the forest (like Apperson’s Mélisande). Her womanly paroxysms and her strong patience contrast with Chick’s childlike, sensual, and impatient attack. After all, it is possible to imagine that, with a little more restraint on Chick’s part, the premature seduction in the forest would never have taken place, and that Zeke’s “bad faith” would have remained unrevealed to him.\n\nWe may take this train of thought further. Chick’s impulsiveness is honesty, a touchstone that reveals Zeke’s dishonesty and frees him from a false vocation, to his real piety. But the film’s individual moments and private confrontations are so powerful in immediate impact that it is easy to overlook both the moral tensions arising from the shocks they create as they succeed one another, and the power of all the scenes of community— the one-room home, the funeral, the baptism, and Zeke’s return to the bosom of his family. In contrast, the saloon crowd— at first jolly enough (with Victoria Spivey singing a jazz blues, and giving it that dignity)—scatters as soon as a shooting looks like trouble.\n\nThe feelings of true community, at the funeral, are as orgiastic as any others. And if one considers Zeke’s vocation a false one, they are also misleading, saturated as they are with family contrition. Maybe Vidor is criticizing the negative excesses of community feeling, and an excess of guilt and shame. At this point, error becomes so natural that one can see why Vidor’s transcendentalism has to be founded on a dynamism of resilience, rather than on the ideals of impeccability which come only too easily to rationalism. Here, perhaps, Vidor’s vision reveals one of the tension points which are its inspiration. On one hand, man needs a strong community and a strong morality. On the other hand, community and morality both involve obligations which may limit a man’s freedom. By and large, Vidor’s heroes choose freedom rather than community; THE WEDDING NIGHT condemns the sense of community which HALLELUJAH! upholds. Perhaps the earlier film crosses the color-bar as an unconscious expression of its nostalgic impossibility for Vidor, while his “ideal” community—the one in OUR DAILY BREAD— involves a pointed repudiation of the past.\n\nHenri Agel compares Chick’s frailties to Eve’s. Maybe such a reading comes more easily to Catholicism than to Puritanism; for Puritan piety—more concentrated on the family, and on teaching at mother’s knee—can tolerate misogyny rather less than can the Catholic hierarchy of celibate males. But Biblical patterns don’t apply too exactly here, since it is not God the Father who fashions a mate for his “son,” but rather a strong and gentle matriarch who conceives as well as nourishes all her children, and who can find a bride for her first-born. Nonetheless, Agel’s comparison conveys all the affection which, for all her frailties, Zeke and Vidor (and we) cannot but feel for the woman whose mercurial provocations are her vitality’s response to the exasperating and anomic conditions which are all she has known. As it is, they criss-cross HALLELUJAH’S deeper moral slant effectively enough for the film to be read (as Ado Kyrou reads it) as a celebration of desire. It can also be read as a double tragedy, of the disrupted love implied by Zeke’s instant response to her and by her surrender to his preaching— the nearest to belonging she is ever to get. One need only compare Nina Mae McKinney’s forked-lightning charm, as Chick, with Sher merely decorative presence in Zoltan Korda’s SANDERS OF THE RIVER.\n\nIf Vidor’s sense of bodies is most easily recognized in its erotic mode, it is part of a fuller range of physical sensibility. Money apart, Zeke is too tired by working in a sawmill to take Chick out at nights for the fun she craves. And something as hard, prosaic, and familiar as physical fatigue in a workaday context was well on its way out of Hollywood’s ken. I suspect that, after an initial period of “stage stylization,” the sense of prosaic physicality in American films follows a falling curve from the Twenties through the Thirties to a nadir in the Forties, where its nearest equivalent is the emphasis on oppressive bourgeois interiors. The Fifties brought it back, with Method acting and Elia Kazan (whose complementarity to Vidor will be touched on briefly later).\n\nHere, the scenes stressing Zeke’s sawmill fatigue also happen to turn into a little documentary on work-processes. It’s not simply because of the strong contrasts-within-continuity which such processes may allow, if forcefully cut, but for the same reason underlying Vidor’s earlier combination of what is, in effect, an exposition of the processes in cotton preparation, with a musical number. Vidor’s interest in work is altogether more down-to-earth than usual in Hollywood at the time, as may be suggested by a comparison with Victor Fleming’s RED DUST. That film’s tourist-exotic equivalent— details about rubber preparation in the tropics—doubles as, believe it or not, a series of allusions to Jean Harlow’s bosom! (It’s a series of references too complex to detail here, but it involves the fanning of ewe’s udders to turn their milk to cheese.)\n\nFor today’s spectators Vidor’s interest in cotton as work may be eclipsed, initially at least, by sentimental associations with cotton as emblem of the South’s slavebased prosperity, and by early sound equipment which boxes the musical numbers up into long (or static, or group) shots, minimizing the choreography that became possible a few years later. Otherwise the film moves fast, even by Thirties standards; and Seventies audiences, accustomed to slower tempi or more forceful close-ups, may lose a quarter of an hour or more in adjusting to its pace and relaxing their guard against a sentimentality which (particularly at that speed) may be difficult to distinguish from stereotype. Its classic status is likely to be first apparent from Vidor’s keen eye for supple and adaptive energy; for religious sentiment in its physical mode; for sexuality as an exasperated scream of the spirit; for the exuberance of the rascally and the ferocious.\n\nVidor often seems to be, like Blake’s Milton, of the devil’s party—without knowing it, although no doubt suspecting it— and entertaining a more than sneaking sympathy for energy, even when destructively misled, rather than dull correctitude. Even Vidor’s idea of the family accords with Blake’s notion of the diabolical (that is, the divine) in being founded, not on morality, still less on society’s need for stable units, but on something altogether warmer and in the best sense animal—nearer, in fact, to what Norman Mailer called “hip” in his essay, “The White Negro.” The general differences between Vidor and Mailer hardly need comment, and the interest of our comparison lies precisely in the fact that Vidor must transcend a framework which is essentially rural, Texan, and “square,” while Mailer’s definition of ‘ ‘hip” depends on city anomie. Both converge, however, on a sense of nervous will, of violence and bodily resilience, of body-mind reflexes attaining unity with a cosmic pulse, of man’s difficult mixture of interchange with and resistance to his surroundings.\n\nThe simultaneity of religious and erotic sensations during Chick’s baptism by Zeke is both a hip insight and a transcendental one. The overlap between the two may seem less freaky if one thinks how Whitman’s vitalism can be projected in one direction towards the ethic of nationand character-building by work, and in the other direction towards polymorphous joys la Ginsberg. The transition figure between Mailer and Vidor is Hemingway; in certain respects, Vidor’s NORTHWEST PASSAGE is “School of Hemingway.” The rural, puritan side of Vidor is more clearly and simply displayed in Wellman, and although Vidor condemns the citified hipsters in HALLELUJAH!, the sense of contradiction inspires Agel’s admirable qualification of the film, for all its speed and discipline, as somehow “baroque’ ‘—a description perfectly catching its complicated moral and dramatic strains.\n\nWhile the film’s affirmation of the Puritan ethic is of the essence, French Catholic and Cahiers critics tend to remain satisfied with a general description of Vidor’s films as “Puritan” in a way which begs a multitude of questions. Which particular aspect of which particular variety of Puritanism has the critic in mind? Certainly Vidor’s Puritanism can’t be equated with original “grim” Puritanism, whereby only a repressive theocracy— and work considered as a curse, a curb, and a duty—can save man’s depravity from itself. Seastrom’s THE SCARLET LETTER suggests that such Calvinism wasn’t altogether a spent force in America in the Twenties. In OUR DAILY BREAD, Vidor’s study of a tightly cohesive community, the sinner-girl makes a getaway to the city where presumably her callow soul will be a little less miserable. And liberty of escape is clearly as essential to Vidor’s position as it is contrary to Calvinism’s double predestination.\n\nAt any rate, Puritanism was profoundly influenced by the alternative Protestant option—the Deist or Unitarian one—which was to stress the closeness of man’s nature to God. Thus, it countered the notion of total depravity with an equally extreme opposite: a belief in man’s natural goodness, which led towards “noble savage,” democratic, romantic, and transcendentalist positions. One of the problems in discussing what may be meant by Puritanism or Protestantism in twentieth-century art is the extraordinary variety of contrasts and combinations possible between the two positions. Broadly, however, the great American expansiveness seems to have given an optimistic cast to the Protestant ethic, work coming to seem both self-fulfillment and a way of improving society by self-salvation. To this extent Vidor’s films generally seem to belong to the Hollywood Old Guard (or rather to the American cinema which Hollywood all but killed) in seeing work as a fulfillment of human instincts in a way in which “fun morality” cannot be.\n\nWhen the Cahiers critics call Vidor a Puritan they seem to have in mind a sort of Bible Belt fundamentalist, relying heavily on the more bloodthirsty Old Testament verses about the punishment of sinners and heathen. It is to this attitude that Robert Aldrich pays lip-service in SODOM AND GOMORRAH, where America, like the Hebrews, should go its rural way, while the cities of fun morality are wiped out for effete self-indulgence.\n\nTo me the transcendentalist strain in Vidor’s work seems to be stronger than this—as strong, indeed, as in Moby Dick, whose spiritual mainspring is surely the conflict between the grimly Puritanical and the transcendentalist options. Hasn’t Ahab become more evil than the Great White Whale? Isn’t this one aspect of nature, to whose rich, pre-moral contradictions it is disturbingly difficult to allot moral categories at all? I doubt whether any modern reader can avoid asking himself whether Moby Dick—far from being as evil as critics generally seem content to accept—doesn’t correspond to Blake’s Tiger, Tiger; and whether Ahab’s whaler isn’t a dark satanic mill. My own sympathies are quite clear. Ahab is a contaminated hero, and Moby Dick is a white knight, the champion of his own kind, the true representative of God at sea. And I would have plunged a knife in Ahab’s back to save the whale.\n\nIt’s obvious how the very misanthropy of the grim Puritan must involve him in tremendous difficulties when it comes to hating the sin but not the sinner. But the transcendentalist can’t escape them either, for man’s nearness to God doesn’t save him from the nastier propensities, of which evidence is only too abundant. The smiling face of transcendentalism tends to remain blind and silent before the jungle snarl of Social Darwinism, or the transmogrification of double predestination into Manifest Destiny, or theories of justification by crude life-force, or brute cynicism. Indeed, the transcendentalist vocabulary of freedom and faith in humanity may rapidly turn into notions whereby evil in some form or another— drink, or Communism—is at once absolutely everywhere and so alien as to be expellable through the brief enforcement of a rigid theocracy. Transcendentalist tendencies to high ideals can also be expressed in grimly Puritanical terms about the unacceptability of whatever isn’t extremely ideal. “We needs must love the highest when we see it” can rapidly become a pretext for punishing those who prefer another hierarchy, or need a longer acquaintance than one quick look. Indeed, transcendentalism and grim Puritanism are probably natural bedfellows, happiest when neither can pull all the blankets on its own side.\n\nIn Vidor’s films one can see the optimism of an Emerson or a Whitman taking on a much, sharper, more Nietzschean edge. It’s easy enough for a phrase like “self-reliance is God reliance,” to imply or accommodate “And the devil take the hindmost,” or Vidor’s “l don’t like failures.” Vidor, like Whitman, contains multitudes. In the THE BIG PARADE, he admired both Apperson’s forebearance and the riveter’s killer instincts; in HALLELUJAH! both Zeke’s piety and his ferocity deserve our respect, as complementary rather than contradictory aspects of an underlying élan vital. Perhaps something like a transcendentalist criticism of Puritanical narrowness and otherworldliness underlines Zeke’s pseudo-vocation and his fall from grace, while the crime passionel affords a grimmer variation on Nietzsche’s “A little revenge is healthier than no revenge.” Puritan individualism may have lent itself only too easily to the secularized competitiveness of “the survival of the fittest;” but Vidor prefers to celebrate vitalism whereby work is a mode of reconciliation between individual, community, and Nature.\n\nStreet Scene (1931)\n\nElmer Rice’s play centers on young Sam (William Collier, Jr.), who must escape from the New York tenements to achieve the education he deserves. But, in his struggle to free himself from the environment whose prisoners his friends and neighbors have become, his deadliest enemy is his love for Rose (Sylvia Sidney). And he has almost to be forced from the tenement nest to keep faith with himself, and so, perhaps, with those he loves.\n\nSTREET SCENE, another essay in screen populism, anticipates DEAD END, and wears very much better. As so often happens, though, the slighter film was more successful—not only commercially but also critically—presumably because its theme, juvenile delinquency, enabled it to bathe in the aura of the gangster film. It’s difficult to tell how much of STREET SCENE is Vidor, how much is Elmer Rice, how much is from the original stage production (much of whose cast it shares), and how much is producer Samuel Goldwyn.\n\nGoldwyn’s work lends itself surprisingly well to the auteur theory, with his parallel thematics. On the one hand, he offers us the Goldwyn Girls—early epitome of deodorized (and, one suspects, de-ethnicized) American womanhood—and the spectacular musicals. On the other hand, he produced relatively “Populist” films like STREET SCENE, THE WEDDING NIGHT, and PORGY AND BESS. Both ROMAN SCANDALS and THE SECRET LIFE OF WATER MITTY take the dichotomy into their own structure, whereby a mixture of wish fulfillment, paranoid melodrama, and humor alleviate a realistic mediocrity. Later, Goldwyn’s concern with the family in STREET SCENE and THE WEDDING NIGHT reappears at a higher social level, in the suburban family series of the Forties, which uneasily yokes ingredients from THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES with Korean War era complacency. It’s interesting to wonder what Vidor would have made of PORGY AND BESS, or Sturges or Wilder of WALTER MITTY. (And at this point we abandon auteur theory again, even in its extension to producers, and have to discuss rival Hollywood theories about what the audience wanted. We certainly need a study of the box-office rules of thumb underlying the mixture of realism and wish fulfillment, intimacy and melodrama, in the spectacular musical—notably DAMES, IT’S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER, FORTYSECOND STREET, THE PAJAMA GAME, OKLAHOMA!, and WEST SIDE STORY.)\n\nAt any rate, STREET SCENE rapidly centers our concern on young Sam’s need to escape and better himself. His primary duty is to renounce his narrow, constricting loyalties, and consecrate his fully-developed talents to a newer, broader, younger America—an American America, without the ethnic divisions and all the hangovers from tired old Europe, which are embodied in his father’s despotism and his neighbors’ frustrated, stagnant, or confused lives. Perhaps the surest guarantee that his individualism isn’t mere selfishness is that his decision cuts him to the quick, and that we can imagine him, after all, returning from his college education to fetch his Rose.\n\nEthnic vignettes: An operatic Italian and a gloomy Dane perpetuate a pointless and backward-looking argument about whether Columbus or Leif Erikson discovered America. The Italian couple can’t have babies, and the negated assumption of pullulating bambini may be pat but is poignant enough. An embittered wife, turning to adultery to live out a little of her frustrated life force, has considerable sympathy from the film (and prefigures BEYOND THE FOREST). Another obstacle to Sam’s self-emancipation is the severity of his father, whose concepts of family are still rooted in Central European peasant culture (which prefigures THE WEDDING NIGHT).\n\nIf Sam’s spiritual father-figure is the Irishman Moran, this corresponds well enough to the historical fact that the Irish, as the last of the Old Migration, did play a considerable role in helping later immigrant groups adapt to America. Moran is a kind of transition figure between the Irish gangster and the Democratic party machine of Tammany Hall. But he’s linked with neither; and as an ordinary, honest American, he can guide Sam into an individualist ambition. That ambition is balanced by Moran’s altruism in urging the youth on to values which he himself cannot comprehend—a relationship, of a son surpassing a devoted father, that evokes THE CHAMP.\n\nSam, his neighbors, and the film itself, emphatically reject old Abe Kaplan, the atheistic Jewish Marxist, who at first seemed set to be the younger’s guide, philosopher, and friend. The burly Moran wants to punch Abe for his heathenish ideas; and the film seems to feel that Moran’s impulse, although anachronistically crude, and wrong, is so natural, virile, and healthy at heart that it’s spiritually justified. It’s the gut response of inarticulate honesty to all the insidious double-talk of intellectuals (vide MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN). At any rate, it’s the rough-hewn Moran who takes spiritual charge over the sensitive, fervent boy.\n\nThus STREET SCENE is not only Sam’s story, but also (as its title implies) a cross-section, a slice of life, an omnibus film. In theory at least, it constitutes a neatly unified dramatic structure, involving the youth’s escape, the aids and obstacles contributed by his neighbors, and the big-city pressures which frustrated or limited them, and may do the same to him. If the film had achieved this, it would have been exceptionally sophisticated for its time. As it is, it comes so near as to provoke, in this critic at least, an absolutely unjustified impatience—an obsession with its failure. The concentration on an individual hero, and the wider canvas, come to cross purposes rather than a counterpoint. And there’s probably a multitude of reasons why the film gives the effect of being both direct and sidelong, deeply moving yet never quite memorable, almost neo-realist (Sam seeks an education as the “bicycle thief” seeks a bicycle) in theme, yet profoundly anti-neo-realist, almost anti-Populist, in spirit. Perhaps the American scene, then, was too complex for anyone to clarify within any Hollywood framework—or any one artist’s mind.\n\nVidor feels he was hamstrung by Samuel Goldwyn’s excessive respect for a prestigious stage play (as he seems to have been, later, by PORGY AND BESS). Vidor finds himself with what is virtually a single set: the street and the front facade of an apartment house. This spatial constraint isn’t particularly helpful in tracing the interaction of family groups, though Vidor’s camera movements and alterations of angle are as exceptionally resourceful as one would expect.\n\nThe limitations within which he has to work may be illustrated by reference to Renoir’s roughly comparable THE LOWER DEPTHS. While the latter is hardly a tidy film, its bums and failures are both individuals and a group. A sense of negative coexistence and occasional, unreliable, or involuntary interaction between separate (indeed, anomic) individuals is eased by the very structure of the sets—a courtyard and a dormitory—which have an extensive existence in depth. Similarly, THE CRIME OF MONSIEUR LANGE juxtaposes a printing-works, a courtyard and a laundry—three continuous areas.\n\nNew York tenement streets and fire escapes in summer could equally be a kind of “courtyard.” One can imagine Vidor—with or without the precedents of BOUDU SAVED FROM DROWNING or SOUS LES TOITS DE PARIS—extending his own tracking movements in THE CROWD, and grouping the apartment windows in a manner prefiguring Hitchcock’s way with a similar facade in REAR WINDOW, with its brilliant re-introduction of the third dimension beyond a facade. But one suspects that such a vision of New York would have cut against Vidor’s grain.\n\nWhat is at issue is not, as Lindgren-era theory might have supposed, some cinematic imperative whereby the disunities of space and time must be observed as dogmatically as human fidgetiness can contrive. There is, after all, an infinity of camera angles and opportunities for cuts even if the subject is only a sleeper immobile in a chair. The problem is rather one which Vidor, as a lyricist of individualism, isn’t temperamentally best suited to resolve: the reconciliation of individual decisions and destinies with a socio-environmental pressure which is at once continuous and relentless, but which is expressed through a diversity of human predicaments—Sam’s friends and neighbors.\n\nIt isn’t merely a matter of “the individual versus the mass.” Merely to pose the issue in those terms would be to forget HALLELUJAH! , OUR DAILY BREAD, and NORTHWEST PASSAGE. In these three films the individual fulfills himself within a thoroughly cohesive group in which he shares one direct, common relationship (the family) or purpose (the military expedition). But STREET SCENE depends upon a diversity of purposes within an apparent group. Each individual, or couple, struggles to retain a private integrity, not only against one another (which, as direct conflicts, are easier to handle) but alongside one another, in abrasive coexistence (which is altogether more insidious and evasive). They have a common antagonist in “the city.” The problem lies in the network of unity (everyone is at bay against the city atmosphere), disunity (each apartment isolated), and conflict (as Sam surmounts obstacles and temptations).\n\nIn a sense, the film has a “collective hero”—it is an omnibus version of John’s fate in THE CROWD. But to the individualist American tradition, and to Vidor, the more individualist form comes more easily. John and Mary, like their homonyms in OUR DAILY BREAD, are as generalized as their Christian names imply, but can never conflict with each other, which is where the crunch begins. In STREET SCENE, our identification with Sam and Rose suggests a deeply moving struggle between them, which the minor characters constrict and interrupt. Conversely, the minor characters remain cameos, so limited in their own spiritual potential as to be neither altogether tragic nor altogether relevant. The faithless wife is not quite what Rose might become if Sam abandons her forever and she marries another. We identify with Sam’s rebellion, but very much less (if at all) with his father’s pain. And so on. A major film becomes a minor one—but a minor one teasingly implying more than it can ever quite say. Unlike Chabrol, I prefer the failed great film to the successful minor one.\n\nBehind its failure lies a long American tradition, whereby America’s expansionist fluidity and her individualist creed, reinforcing one another, combine with a sense of national greatness to impose particular confusions on studies of groups and communities. STREET SCENE is a melting-pot equivalent to Winesburg Ohio or Our Town. and in these works also one is struck by the absence of a straightforward and functioning social framework. They are studies in loneliness, or else the dead appear so that a moral-cosmic reference occludes the social pattern of purpose and cross-purpose. (Whereas Faulkner elongates what are essentially social-moral chains of cause-and-effect into long, devious connections which feel more like Greek tragedies underpinned by an Old Testament sense of sin.)\n\nIn contrast, European films have usually found it easier to manage cross-sections and pluralities of coexistence, whether urban-pastoral (LE QUATORZE JUILLET) or pessimistic (HOTEL DU NORD). Wyler’s THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is something of a tour de force in its adaptation of a European theme to American styles. (Wyler’s mixture of virtuosity, caution, and moral solidity is another matter, and I think he has many of the traditional bourgeois virtues as well as an out-of-fashion bourgeois caution.) Eventually, of course, “omnibus Populism” became an American genre also (see my remarks on REAR WINDOW in my book, The Strange Case of Alfred Hitchcock). It might be illuminating to consider STREET SCENE as a Chayefsky—Delbert Mann subject, done in the style of BACHELOR PARTY.\n\nOne must of course remember that German and American populism, of one sort or another, precedes the French variety, and that, so far as social issues go, Clair is much remoter than Capra or Vidor. Nonetheless, Hollywood populism faded in the mid-Thirties. Meanwhile, its French counterpart rose to its apogee along with the Popular Front, the war years inspired the English to MILLIONS LIKE US and IT ALWAYS RAINS ON SUNDAY, and Italian neo-realism thrived in the postwar years, before Hollywood remembered a genre it had forgotten. In STREET SCENE one can sense the reservations which brought Hollywood populism into eclipse.\n\nFluidity and individualism apart, the pitch for American screen populism was further queered by the problem "
