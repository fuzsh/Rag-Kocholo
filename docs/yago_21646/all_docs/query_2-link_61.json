        "text": "King Wallis Vidor (; February 8, 1894 – November 1, 1982) was an American film director, film producer, and screenwriter whose 67-year film-making career successfully spanned the silent and sound eras.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nVidor was born into a well-to-do family in Galveston, Texas, the son of Kate (née Wallis) and Charles Shelton Vidor, a lumber importer and mill owner. His grandfather, Károly Charles Vidor, was a refugee of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, who settled in Galveston in the early 1850s. Vidor's mother, Kate Wallis, of Scotch-English descent, was a relative of the second wife of iconic frontiersman and politician Davy Crockett. The \"King\" in King Vidor is no sobriquet, but his given name in honor of his mother's favorite brother, King Wallis.\n\nAt the age of six, Vidor witnessed the devastation of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. Based on that formative experience, he published a historical memoir of the disaster, titled \"Southern Storm\", for the May 1935 issue of Esquire magazine.\n\nIn 1939, he would direct the cyclone scene for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's The Wizard of Oz.\n\nVidor was introduced to Mary Baker Eddy's Christian Science by his mother at a very early age. Vidor would endow his films with the moral precepts of the faith, a \"blend of pragmatic self-help and religious mysticism.\"\n\nVidor attended grade school at the Peacock Military Academy.\n\nCareer\n\nAs a boy, Vidor engaged in photographing and developing portraits of his relatives with a Box Brownie camera.\n\nAt the age of sixteen Vidor dropped out of a private high school in Maryland and returned to Galveston to work as a Nickelodeon ticket taker and projectionist. As an 18-year-old amateur newsreel cameraman Vidor began to acquire skills as a film documentarian. His first movie was based on footage taken of a local hurricane (not to be confused with the 1900 Galveston hurricane). He sold footage from a Houston army parade to a newsreel outfit (titled The Grand Military Parade) and made his first fictional movie, a semi-docucomedy concerning a local automobile race, In Tow (1913).\n\nIn 1918, at the age of 24, Vidor directed his first Hollywood feature, The Turn in the Road (1919). Vidor would make three more films for the Brentwood Corporation, all of which featured as yet unknown comedienne Zasu Pitts, who the director had discovered on a Hollywood streetcar. The films Better Times, The Other Half, and Poor Relations, all completed in 1919, also featured future film director David Butler and starred Vidor's then wife Florence Arto Vidor (married in 1915), a rising actor in Hollywood pictures. Vidor ended his association with the Brentwood group in 1920.\n\nVidor's earlier films tend to identify with the common people in a collective struggle, whereas his later works place individualists at the center of his narratives.\n\nVidor's most acclaimed and successful film in the silent era is The Big Parade (1925). His sound films of the 1940s and early 1950s arguably represent his richest output. Among his finest works are Northwest Passage (1940), Comrade X (1940), An American Romance (1944), and Duel in the Sun (1946). His dramatic depictions of the American western landscape endow nature with a sinister force where his characters struggle for survival and redemption.\n\nVidor was considered an \"actors' director\": many of his players received Academy Award nominations or awards, among them Wallace Beery, Robert Donat, Barbara Stanwyck, Jennifer Jones, Anne Shirley, and Lillian Gish.\n\nVidor was nominated five times by the Academy Awards for Best Director. In 1979, he was awarded an Honorary Academy Award for his \"incomparable achievements as a cinematic creator and innovator.\" Additionally, he won eight national and international film awards during his career, including the Screen Directors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award in 1957.\n\nIn 1962, he was head of the jury at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nVidor lectured occasionally on film production and directing in the late 1950s and the 1960s at two state universities in Southern California, (USC and CSU, Los Angeles.) He published a non-technical handbook that provides anecdotes from his film career, On Film Making in 1972.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1944 Vidor, a Republican, joined the anti-communist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals.\n\nVidor published his autobiography, A Tree is a Tree, in 1953. This book's title is inspired by an incident early in Vidor's Hollywood career. Vidor wanted to film a movie in the locations where its story was set, a decision which would have greatly added to the film's production budget. A budget-minded producer told him, \"A rock is a rock. A tree is a tree. Shoot it in Griffith Park\" (a nearby public space which was frequently used for filming exterior shots).\n\nKing Vidor was a Christian Scientist and wrote occasionally for church publications.\n\nMarriages\n\nVidor was married three times:\n\nFlorence Arto (m. 1915–1924)\n\n(later married Jascha Heifetz)\n\nSuzanne (1918–2003)\n\n(adopted by Jascha Heifetz)\n\nEleanor Boardman (m. 1926–1931)\n\nAntonia (1927–2012)\n\nBelinda (born 1930)\n\nElizabeth Hill (m. 1932–1978)\n\nDeath\n\nVidor died at age 88 of a heart ailment at his ranch in Paso Robles, California, on November 1, 1982.\n\nFilmography\n\nAcademy Awards and nominations\n\nYear Award Film Result 1927–28 Best Director The Crowd Frank Borzage – 7th Heaven 1929–30 Hallelujah Lewis Milestone – All Quiet on the Western Front 1931–32 Outstanding Production The Champ Irving Thalberg – Grand Hotel Best Director Frank Borzage – Bad Girl 1938 The Citadel Frank Capra – You Can't Take It with You 1956 War and Peace George Stevens – Giant 1979 Academy Honorary Award for his incomparable achievements as a cinematic creator and innovator\n\nDirected Academy Award performances\n\nYear Performer Film Result Academy Award for Best Actor 1931–32 Wallace Beery The Champ Won 1938 Robert Donat The Citadel Nominated Academy Award for Best Actress 1937 Barbara Stanwyck Stella Dallas Nominated 1946 Jennifer Jones Duel in the Sun Nominated Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress 1937 Anne Shirley Stella Dallas Nominated 1946 Lillian Gish Duel in the Sun Nominated\n\nAcademy Awards in King Vidor films\n\nYear Film Academy Award\n\nNominations Academy Award\n\nwins 1927–28 The Crowd 2 0 1929–30 Hallelujah 1 0 1931–32 The Champ 4 2 1936 The Texas Rangers 1 0 1938 The Citadel 4 0 1940 Northwest Passage 1 0 Comrade X 1 0 1946 Duel in the Sun 2 0 1949 Beyond the Forest 1 0 1956 War and Peace 3 0\n\nOther awards\n\nIn 1964, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema. In 2020, Vidor was honored with a retrospective at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, showcasing more than 30 of his films.\n\nImages for kids\n\nKing Vidor and Colleen Moore on location for The Sky Pilot near Truckee, California\n\nHendrik Sartov (cinematographer), King Vidor (director), Irving Thalberg (producer) & Lillian Gish (co-star) on the set of La Bohème\n\nKing Vidor (center) with Renée Adorée and John Gilbert.
