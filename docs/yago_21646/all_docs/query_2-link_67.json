        "text": "The San Luis Obispo International Film Festival debuted November 4-7, 1993. It opened to great fanfare, complete with searchlights and an Opening Night Gala at which the restored film El Cid was presented. The Festival celebrated the 100th anniversary of the movies with a slate of restored and classic films, as well as new independent films. The first King Vidor Memorial Award for lifetime achievements in the art of filmmaking was presented to Academy Award-winning director and producer George Sidney.\n\nThe Opening Night Gala featured the screening of the newly-restored My Fair Lady.

In addition to new films with Central Coast premieres, a number of classic films were shown, and noted screenwriters participated in the Festival’s first panel event, “Ethical Issues in Screenwriting.”\n\nOpening Night featured the screening of A Hard Day’s Night, in honor of the 75th anniversary of United Artists.

Additional highlights included the inaugural year of the George Sidney Independent Film Competition; An Evening with Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro; a Salute to Film Editors with panel discussion and special screenings, and the silent film Wings accompanied by Bob Mitchell.\n\nThe Festival added screenings in Arroyo Grande to the mix, and opened with a Gala Tribute to Academy Award-winning actor Ernest Borgnine, recipient of the King Vidor Memorial Award.

A retrospective of Kramer’s films was shown throughout the Festival. Other highlights included a Salute to Sound in Film with Foley, sound design, and voice effects demonstrations; a collaboration with the Independent Film Channel; and a silent film closing event tribute to Chaplin and Keaton featuring Bob Mitchell and Robert Israel.\n\nOpening Night featured a Tribute to Jim Dee, owner of the Palm Theatre, and the King Vidor Memorial Award recipient for his contributions to film appreciation in our community. A special screening of “Strangers on a Train” with guest Patricia Hitchcock O’Connell added to the evening.

The Festival closed with “Flesh and the Devil,” accompanied by Bob Mitchell.\n\nThe Opening Night Gala featured a screening of the newly-restored Rear Window, and presentation of the King Vidor Memorial Award to the film’s restoration team of Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz. As part of the screenings honoring these artists, 4 restored 70mm films were shown. A Salute to the Visual Effects Society highlighted noted visual effects artists including matte painters and visual effects supervisors. As entries to the George Sidney Independent Film Competition increased, so did the number of new films in the lineup. The first sing-along/costume contest, Oklahoma, made its appearance, and the closing event was the silent film classic, The Wind, with Bob Mitchell.\n\nThe King Vidor Memorial Award was presented to actor Howard Keel on Opening Night, along with a screening of Kiss Me Kate; 4 more of Keel’s films were shown during the Festival. Pre-Code Hollywood was explored along with vintage sci-fi, French New Wave, French and American film noir, and centennial tributes were all part of the offerings. The popular sing-along evening featured West Side Story. A Salute to the Art of Film Titles, a traveling exhibit curated by DesignFilm.org, provided a look at a very interesting element in films, and the closing event was two Keaton classics accompanied by Bob Mitchell.\n\nThe 10th anniversary of the Festival began with an Opening Night tribute to Academy Award-winning film composer Elmer Bernstein, which included a screening of To Kill a Mockingbird. The Magnificent Seven, which includes one of the most famous scores of all time, and Sweet Smell of Success were also presented during the Festival. South Pacific was the Halloween sing-along/costume contest event, and the behind-the-scenes focus was on Historical Preservation of Film Memorabilia. Retrospectives, concert films, and a slate of new films rounded out the event, with a closing silent film starring Marion Davies and featuring beloved artist Bob Mitchell.\n\nIn 2004, the festival moved from October to March and in 2007 welcomed a new Artistic Director, Wendy Eidson and in 2007 she became the Festival Director till 2021. Wendy focused on expanding and featuring new un-released independent films but continuing to incorporate the history of film into the festival every year, with classics, silent films and seminars and panels.\n\nThe 2006 SLOIFF was held just two days after the Academy Awards and included more independent films than ever before. Over 25 filmmakers attended the 6 day festival with 29 films competing for awards. The red carpet was rolled out for Greg Noll, Stacey Peralta, and Jeff Clark attending a special sold-out screening of Riding Giants and later that week, the King Vidor Award for Excellence in Filmmaking went to actor, Morgan Freeman who was applauded by yet another sell-out crowd at the Fremont Theatre after the pre-release screening of his newest film, Lucky Number Slevin. In attendance were good friends Malcolm McDowell, Phil Alden Robinson and Academy Award-winning editor, Neil Travis. Awards were also presented to independent filmmakers by actors Keith Carradine and Zac Efron.\n\nThe 2007 festival played host to over 85 visiting filmmakers, close to 100 independent and classic films, and many special events, workshops and parties. Irving Thalberg recipient, Norman Jewison was honored with a King Vidor Award on the first weekend of the festival along with a screening of one of his great films, “Moonstruck.” Academy Award nominee, James Cromwell was awarded a King Vidor award on the second weekend and participated in an acting panel. Henry Jaglom, Melissa Joan Hart and many other excellent new and veteran filmmakers won awards in the George Sidney Independent Film Competition, and the famous surf filmmaking family, Bruce, Dana and Wes Brown were on hand for the second annual Surf Night in SLO.\n\nThe 2008 festival featured an exciting lineup of over 100 independent and classic films, special guests like Josh Brolin and David Crosby and King Vidor Award honoree, Peter Fonda. Surf Night in SLO sold out once again with a memorable tribute to 95-year old Bud Browne, the grandaddy of surf filmmaking. Legendary surfers, Gerry Lopez, John Peck, Fred Van Dyke, Linda Benson, Joel Tutor and many others were here to pay their respects and enjoyed one of Bud’s films, “Surfin’ the 50’s.” The new Hollywood & Vines events brought together great classic films with excellent local wines and food, at some unusual venues around the county. King Vidor was the focus of film retrospective.\n\nThe March 2009 Festival featured an unusual Opening Night Gala at Corbett Vineyards, where Malcolm McDowell received the King Vidor Award. The Festival boasted a great lineup of new films and many filmmakers and attendees enjoyed the multitude of parties and special events throughout the 10 days, in venues all over the county. Robert and David Carradine, along with stuntmen Norman Howell and other riders, robbed the train at Santa Margarita Ranch; Australian surf legend Nat Young was honored at the 4th annual Surf Nite, with his son Beau and world champion Linda Benson in attendance; and John Waters helped close the Festival with a hilarious show at the Fremont Theatre, after the Independent Film Awards hosted by film critic, Mick LaSalle.\n\nThe 2010 SLOIFF featured well over one hundred films once again and the King Vidor Award went to Academy Award-winning actor, Alan Arkin. Former King Vidor Award recipients James Cromwell and Norman Jewison were on hand for the award ceremony along with his son, Adam and wife, Suzanne. Filmmakers from all over the world enjoyed Central Coast hospitality at a variety of parties and events, including a rousing St. Patrick’s Day-themed Surf Nite featuring Irish surf filmmaker Joel Conroy and his epic film, WAVERIDERS. Surfers Gabe Davies, Peter Mel and Kalani Robb joined the fun.\n\nThe 2011 SLOIFF was shortened to five days but still featured well over one hundred films and a wide variety of filmmakers and special guests were in attendance. The King Vidor Award went to Academy Award-nominated actor, Greg Kinnear. Filmmakers from all over the world enjoyed Central Coast hospitality at a variety of parties and events featuring excellent local wines and food, and several new venues and special events were introduced this year: the Galaxy Theatre in Atascadero was “christened” by the SLOIFF on March 5th, SLOIFF’s first Bike Nite took place at the Fremont Theatre, and women filmmakers were celebrated at a special “Chicks ‘n Flicks” venue, sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn 2012, the Festival continued to screen films all over SLO County over five days, introducing two new venues: in Arroyo Grande (The Spot) and San Simeon (Hearst Castle). The Festival made history when it screened CITIZEN KANE at the Hearst Castle Visitor Center theatre on the huge screen, and garnered international media coverage for the two sold-out screenings. Acclaimed photographer Timothy White was honored with the inaugural Spotlight Award, and Weta Workshop co-founder Richard Taylor was presented with the King Vidor Award.\n\nThe 2013 Festival once again featured a special event at Hearst Castle, with a West Coast premiere of CITIZEN HEARST and the Spotlight Award presentation to the Oscar-nominated director of that film, Leslie Iwerks. A new venue at the Avila Beach Community Center featured a program of “Sports and Shorts” and the Fremont Theatre in downtown SLO was busy all weekend with wine tastings, screenings of new documentaries, a sold out Surf Nite and the King Vidor Award presentation to Oscar-nominated actor, John Hawkes.\n\nThe 2014 Festival was the most successful to date, financially, critically and attendance-wise. It kicked off at the Fremont Theatre with a documentary and presentation of the Spotlight Award to iconic actor, Adam West. That was followed by four more days and nights of exciting events at the historic theatre, which included another sold-out Surf Nite (with a concert by Honk), a new documentary about Anita Hill and the King Vidor Award presentation to actor, Jeff Bridges. Mary Harris was also presented with a Founder’s Award. Central Coast films were highlighted on the closing day, with awards presented in a number of new categories.\n\n2015 continued to raise the bar and the Festival received unprecedented media coverage and had its best year ever financially. The festival made history again with an exclusive screening of CITIZEN KANE in the private Hearst Castle Hilltop Theatre that was attended by only 50 people including TCM’s Ben Mankiewicz, actor Bill Paxton, and Warner Brothers executives. John Milius was honored at a sold-out Surf Nite featuring a BIG WEDNESDAY cast reunion, and the new documentary HOLLYWOOD DON’T SURF, with directors Greg MacGillivray and Sam George in attendance. World premieres of a number of films, great parties and the King Vidor presentation to Peter Bogdanovich rounded out another memorable festival\n\nIn 2017, the Festival continued the new tradition of a Festival VIP Tent located behind the historic Fremont Theatre, and both venues were the site of an epic Opening Night, featuring a Mardi Gras theme. The Fremont Theatre filled to capacity a few times during the festival week, with a world premiere about horse trainers, an Irish-themed Surf Nite and a tribute to actor Josh Brolin. Former King Vidor Award recipient Jeff Bridges presented his friend with the award. Film critic/author Leonard Maltin helped close the Festival, presented with the 6th Annual Spotlight Award by Festival founder, Mary Harris.\n\n2018 was another banner year with increased attendance and pass sales, and long lines for many screenings. The Downtown Cinemas became a hub with six busy theatres playing festival films, and the Festival Tent moved to Mission Plaza. Surf Nite featured the North American Premiere of THE BIG WAVE PROJECT, from Australian filmmaker, Tim Bonython. Actress Pam Grier was honored with the King Vidor Award, presented by TCM’s Ben Mankiewicz. The Spotlight Award was presented once again by Festival founder Mary Harris to screenwriter, Robin Swicord, making a repeat appearance at the SLO Film Fest with her husband and fellow screenwriter, Nicolas Kazan. 2018 Award Winners.\n\n2020 SLO Film Fest will forever be remembered as the festival that almost happened! Only five days before Opening Night on March 17, festival organizers were asked to cancel the festival by the County Public Health agency in accordance with state mandates due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Shortly after that, events, venues and most businesses closed, not only in San Luis Obispo but around the world, and we scrambled to figure out how to offer festival pass holders a sampling of the great movies we had planned to screen for the six day festival. Within a matter of days, over 50 filmmakers agreed to share their films online in a Watch at Home virtual festival and we shared links to a wonderful selections of short and feature films, both local and global from March 17-22 with pass buyers and festival sponsors. We were the first film festival in North America. On the Closing Day at 6pm PST, winning films in three categories were announced and filmmakers shared their excitement and gratitude in online videos.\n\nIn 2021, Skye McLennan became the new Executive Director, with Wendy Eidson as the Artistic Director. The 2021 film festival was again a mostly virtual festival, hosting over 100 films on a robust digital platform. We also hosted our ever popular “Surf Nite in SLO” at the Sunset Drive-In for the first time!"
