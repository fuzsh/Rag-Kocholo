Billy Murcia was born in Bogota, Colombia in 1951 and raised in Jackson Heights, New York. Ronald Sylvain Mizrahi was born in Cairo, Egypt, in 1951, to a Jewish family, but his family were forced to flee in 1959, first to Paris, France and finally in 1961 to Buffalo then Brooklyn-New York, United States. John Anthony Genzale, Jr of Italian descent, was born was born in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York in 1952. David Johansen was born in Staten Island, New York, in 1950, to an Irish American mother and a Norwegian American father.\n\nSylvain Sylvain, Johnny Thunders and Billy Murcia all went to Newtown High School in Elmhurst, Queens. From 1968-70 Billy, Johnny and Sylvain attended (Leonardo) Quintano's School for Young Professionals (on West 56th street in Manhattan directly behind Carnegie Hall). Quintano's was a private school for child actors and models or anyone who did not conform to public school attendence. Arthur went to Martin Van Buren High School in Queens and later attended college at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York as a Food Science and Management student, but dropped out in his third year.\n\nThe London Fogg (a.k.a. The Fogg) In 1967 the band was formed by 4 high school students (at Pratt): Stu Feinholtz Wylder (on vocals & drums), Arthur Kane (on rhythm guitar), George -Rick Rivets- Fedorcik (on guitar) and Kennie Finger (on bass). They played mostly covers of English groups like the Animals, Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, Kinks, and American stuff by the Beau Brummels, Wilson Pickett and The Surfaris/Ventures. They played only in New York City @ The Metropole, Cafe Wha, The Bitter End, NYU, and @ local church and school dances. A second line-up had Gerard Dinces on drums and Stu only on vocals, which played @ a club in Deepdale, Queens. A third, and final line-up, added a new drummer Kenneth -Sparky- Donovan. When The Fogg folds Rick forms The Berries with Arthur, Kenneth -Sparky- Donovan and Keith Tilton. They covered the Stones and Yardbirds, but never played out much. After that band ends Rick and Arthur went, seperately, to Amsterdam in 1970, trying to get a new band together, but ended up selling hash. Rick came back and Arthur followed later, when he got deported after his visa had run out.\n\nThe Pox In 1967 a high school band was formed by Sylvain Sylvain (on guitar), Mike Turby [from The Orphans] (on bass) and Billy Murcia (on drums). They rehearse a lot, in March 1968 record one demo (\"Epitaph\") and among others play live @ the Grand Ballroom of the Diplomat Hotel, New York City (most likely in March 1968), in support for The Group Image, which had Barbara Garrison (in 1977 to marry Arthur Kane) as member. Billy's working @ Grizzly Furs, a vintage clothes shop on St.Marks Place and Sylvain @ a clothing boutique, The Different Drummer, on 790 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, across the street from a local repair of toys and dolls called the New York Doll Hospital. When The Pox fold in 1968 Sylvain and Billy start to design clothes (Sylvain's dad had, next to his banking job, a tailoring business) under the banner Satcha Knits, from late 1968 till August 1969, operating out of Woodstock. Upon returning to New York they design a clothing line, called \"Truth and Soul\" for the brothers Nussbaum's Knitting Mill. In January 1970 Billy and Sylvain leave for Amsterdam (NL), where they see The Who perform at the Concertgebouw on 30-Jan-70. Both returned to Queens in October 1970.\n\nThe Reign/Johnny and the Jaywalkers While in junior high school Johnny -Thunders- Genzale formed a band that later evolved into a short-lived rock band The Reign which included Don Bruce (on vocals), Johnny -Thunders- Genzale (on guitar), George Boyd (on organ), Frank Sardelis (on bass) and John Pisapia (drums). Together they cut one track @ Associated Studios, on 7th Avenue and 48th street, in the winter of 1967, \"Zippered Up Heart\" . At Quintano's School for Young Professionals, Johnny played with Johnny and the Jaywalkers, under the name Johnny Volume. In 1969 Johnny went to London, with someone else's press card, checking out the scene.\n\nThe Vagabond Missionaries/The Electric Japs David Johansen began in 1965 as the lead singer in a local Staten Island high school band the Vagabond Missionaries, and later fast Eddie and the Electric Japs, doing support acts @ Cafe Wha and Cafe Au Go Go in Greenwhich village. The Electric Japs did mainly Motown covers and had Joey Carillo (from Puerto Rico) on drums.\n\nEarly Dolls When Billy and Sylvain return to Queens in October 1970, they start a band with Johnny Thunders, Arthur Kane and George -Rick Rivets- Fedorcik, practicing in the basement of the Murcia family's house. Towards the end of 1970, Johnny had started hanging out @ Nobodys, a club @ 163 Bleecker Street in the West Village. It was there that he met Arthur Kane and Rick Rivets. In May 1971, Sylvain had to return to London (UK) to help Mercedes and Heidi Murcia with their sweaters business for Kensington Market. They all went to the performance of Andy Warhol's play \"Pork\" at the Roundhouse on 06-Jun-71. By July 1971 Arthur, Rick, Billy and Johnny start rehearsing at Arthur's basement on Tenth street.\n\n1971\n\nThe year in which the Dolls perform their first live show.\n\nEarly Dolls Line-up #1 (New York City: July 1971):\n\nJohnny Thunders (vocals/guitar)/ Arthur Kane (bass)/ George -Rick Rivets- Fedorcik (guitar) & Billy Murcia (drums)\n\nJuly-71\n\nUS NY,New York City-Long Island,Arthur Kane's basement on 10th street,rehearsal space\n\nNote: Doing covers of songs like \"Carol\" [Chuck Berry], \"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\" [Bobby Troup/Chuck Berry], \"Pipeline\" [The Chantays/The Ventures], \"Little Queenie\" [Chuck Berry], \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" [Rolling Stones], etc..\n\nSeptember-71\n\nUS NY,New York City-Manhattan,108 West 81st street (off Columbus avenue)\n\nRusty's bycycle shop - rehearsal space\n\nNote: By now the band had moved from Artie's basement to Rusty's (a.k.a. \"beanie\", because he was always wearing a beanie hat) bike rental shop for their rehearsals. The shop doubled as a rehearsal space at night. \"We used to rehearse in this bicycle store up on the West Side, Columbus and 82nd. The guy used to rent bicycles in the summertime and then he would have a set of drums and a couple of amps, and we would go in and rehearse during the wintertime.\" David Johansen interviewed for Vulture/New York Magazine March 26, 2014.\n\nxx-Oct-71\n\nUS NY,New York City-Manhattan,108 West 81st street (off Columbus avenue)\n\nRusty's bicycle shop - rehearsal space\n\nSetlist: That's Poison (a.k.a.

(take 2)/ It's Too Late (take 2)/ We Have Been Through This Before/ Why Am I Alone?\n\nPhoto: Google street view, October 2017.\n\nNote: The rehearsal was taped and made available on the \"Actress: Birth Of The New York Dolls\" CD (Get Back 2000). \"Actress\" is often referred to as the name of the early Dolls, but was never actually used. Incidentally in 1974 there would be an actual NY band called Actress, playing plenty of concerts at the Coventry.\n\n1971\n\nUS NY,New York City,Arthur and Billy invite David Johansen to their rehearsals. It's quickly decided that he would take vocal (and harmonica) duties from then on.\n\nEarly Dolls Line-up #2 (New York City: December 1971):\n\nDavid Johansen (vocals)/ Johnny Thunders (vocals/guitar)/ Arthur Kane (bass)/ George -Rick Rivets- Fedorcik (guitar) & Billy Murcia (drums)\n\n24-Dec-71\n\nUS NY,New York City-Manhattan,Endicott Hotel,Ballroom\n\nChristmas bash\n\nSetlist: (a.o.) Don't Mess with Cupid/ (There's Gonna Be A) Showdown, more..\n\nPhoto: Google street view, October 2017.\n\nNote: The Endicott was then a welfare hotel, located @ 101 West 81st Street,at the northwest corner of Columbus Avenue. From wikipedia:\"By the early 1970s, the Endicott had become very dangerous. At the time, about 40-50% of its tenants were receiving welfare. Management tried to evict \"undesirable elements\" from the premises but was unsuccessful. A violent crime wave struck the building. In 1972, there was a slaying of four women in the hotel. In 1973, a 63-year old welfare recipient was found murdered and the body set afire.\"\n\nThe welfare workers, who had heard the band rehearsing at Rusty's cycle rent shop across the street, invited the early Dolls to play at the Christmas party they organised for the residents at the hotel. \"The Dolls launched into a set consisting of covers such as Otis Redding's \"Don't Mess with Cupid\", \"(There's Gonna Be A) Showdown\" by Archie Bell & the Drells, and other R&B covers.\" (from Kris Needs' and Dick Porter's book \"Trash! - The Complete New York Dolls\").\n\nThis was to be Rick Rivets first and last ever live show with the early Dolls. Soon after he started The Brats with Kenneth -Sparky- Donovan, Keith West and David Leeds. Sylvain Sylvain, who had returned from London, took Rick's place on guitar.\n\n1972\n\nThe year in which the band start their residency at the Mercer Arts Center and tour the UK.\n\nLine-up #1 (New York City: February 1972 - November 1972):\n\nDavid Johansen (vocals)/ Johnny Thunders (vocals/guitar)/ Arthur Kane (bass)/ Sylvain Sylvain (guitar) & Billy Murcia (drums)\n\nEarly 1972\n\nUS NY,New York City-Chinatown,119 Chrystie street loft,above a Chinese noodle shop.\n\nPhoto 1: Google street view, May 2011.\n\nPhoto 2: Screen capture, taken from \"Looking For Johnny\", a film by Danny Garcia.

Songs like \"Frankenstein\", \"Human Being\" and \"Jet Boy\" are born here.\n\n\"Deborah Harry [Blondie] was always around. I talked to her recently, asking '\"Do you remember the loft?\" and she replied, Oh Sylvain, I had so much sex in that loft! But so did we all. We were so careless in those days, because you didn't die if you had sex.\" From Syl's book \"There's No Bones in Ice Cream\".\n\n\"Those rent parties, although there were only a few of them, were the best shows we ever did. Better than Max's, better than the Mercer, better than London and Paris. When people say they saw the Dolls, I don't care where they saw us, if it wasn't at those rent parties, when we were young and hungry and completely untamed, they didn't see us.\" From Syl's book \"There's No Bones in Ice Cream\".\n\n04-Feb-72\n\nUS NY,New York City,Diplomat Hotel,Grand Ballroom\n\n[with Teenage Lust, Evil (aka Takeover), David Peel & the Lower East Side, Uncle Bucks]\n\n(Dana Beal Benefit Boogie)\n\nAd: Scan from the East Village Other 7#2 1972.\n\nNote 1: \"They were formed in January of this year.[...] Their first gig was a political benefit party -they don't know what politcis were involved- but an ad in the Villiage Voice, plus a shoddy picture, launched them.\" From \"You wanna play house with the Dolls\" by Roy Hollingworth, published in Melody Maker 22-Jul-72.\n\nNote 2: (Irvin) Dana Beal (born 1947) is an American social and political activist, best known for his efforts to legalize marijuana.

[...] Anyway Teenage Lust played some great rock and roll while the lead singer of [the] Dolls just blew everyone out.\"\n\n\"... we were also beginning to get talked about outside of the [Chrystie street] loft, which is how we landed our very first 'paying' gig on February 4, 1972.\" From Syl's book \"There's No Bones in Ice Cream\".\n\n26-Mar-72\n\nUS NY,New York City-Manhattan,Central Park Mall (@ East 72nd street)\n\n[with Takeover (aka Evil), David Peel & the Lower East Side, Uncle Bucks]\n\n(\"Zip-In!\" @ 1:00 PM)\n\nAd: Scan from underground newspaper New York Ace 14-Mar-72, courtesy of Sean Howe.\n\nNote: Event organized by (Tom Forcade's) Zippies, an offshoot of Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman's Yippie movement.\n\n05-May-72\n\nUS NY,New York City-Greenwich Village,Mercer Arts Center,The Kitchen\n\n[with The Magic Tramps and Satan the Fire Eater]\n\nAd: Scan of ad.\n\nNote: The MAC was rented and remodeled between March 1970/December 1971 by (former sports car racer) Seymour -Sy- Kaback and his wife Cynthia at the rear entrance of the (1870 opened) Broadway Central Hotel -which was by the 1960s a well-known dump/welfare hotel- @ 240 Mercer Street. The center held its grand re-opening on December 20, 1971, but the upper floors of the former hotel remained derelict and populated with vagrants and drug users. The Kitchen's (in the hotel's former kitchen) opened on June 15, 1971. The remodeledMAC consisted out of thirtheen spaces: on the main floor the Hansberry theater (299 seats), the Brecht theater (199 seats) and a Service bar; on the second floor the O'Casey theater (299 seats), the Shaw Arena theater (224 seats), the Oscar Wilde Room theater (200 seats), the Kitchen video studio and performance space (199 seats), the Obie Alley bar, the Cabaret/DMZ Lounge night club, two acting schools/studios (Gene Frankel Theater Workshop and Viveca Lindfors' \"An Actor Works\"), the Zoo boutique and a rehearsal hall.\n\nThis event was the Dolls first -known- paid ($15) show. Event labeled as \"Video rock - Electronic Excorcise\".

There wasn't a huge crowd - it was mainly people we knew, and people who The Magic Tramps knew, and people who Satan The Fire Eater knew.

By the summer of 1971 Jerry was briefly drumming for Suzy Quatro's Detroit band Cradle, as the only male member. Then he did drums for Wayne County's band Queen Elisabeth at the same time as drumming in Shaker. Jerry would replace Billy Murcia in the Dolls in December 1972. In the mid sixties, while still in high school, Art Steinman had a garage band called The Jagged Edge/The Off-Set.\n\nJune 1972\n\nUS NY,New York City,Talent Recon Inc.

The hotel was occupied by elderly people who lived on welfare, but quickly became infested with prostitutes and drug pushers.\"The basement and the second and third floors of the Pierrepont are rented out to a so-called gay club. The club was known as Man's Country originally, then the 53 Club (for the address of the hotel's side door), and presently (Sep-73) has no name. It consists of a pool, sauna and dance floor in the basement and rooms and meeting areas on the upper two floors. The club advertises regularly in underground sex newspapers, according to local residents. On recent nights a constant stream of men, singly and in couples could be seen entering and leaving the club between 8 P.M. and 1 A.M.\" (source: NYT 24-Sep-73). At the end of 1973 the club moved to Manhattan, @ 28 West 15th Street. Man's Country never had any live musical acts its Pierrepont location. At the West 15th st.

This event is often mixed up (both date and location) and is most likely to have happened at the, better-known, Continental Baths (in Manhattan). There's no evidence they ever played the Man's Country bathhouse although the accounts (of Sylvain and Arthur) below refer to it.\n\nAccounts: From \"I, Doll\" (by Arthur Kane) pages 89-92, Chapter 14 Man's Country. Arthur's recollections set this event at the Man's Country club in Park Slope, Brooklyn in the spring of 1972. [Man's Country was in Brooklyn Heights and the Continental Baths in Manhattan];\n\nFrom a translated interview with Sylvain Sylvain in Ox fanzine Germany 2006: \"One of our first proper concerts - we got an incredible $400 fee - we played in Park Slope, Brooklyn in a men's bathhouse called \"Man's Country\", no kidding. We played at the pool, and around us naked men with towels around the waist. Of course we were loud, and they called, we should play more quietly, and so Johnny and I switched our amplifiers off completely. Anyway, we got our $400 [that's $2,400 in today's money, ed.] and could pay our rent.\"\n\nOn his Facebook page Syl wrote (in 2014) that \"10 August 1971 at Man's Country bathhouse in Brooklyn was the first paid Dolls show\".This places the event before Man's Country even opened (in 1972), and before David Johansen's and Sylvain's presence in the Dolls.\n\nOn pages 133-134 of his book \"There's No Bones in Ice Cream\" (Omnibus 2018), Sylvain recounts in detail the story of this (now undated) gig, which was offered to the Dolls by Jane Friedman (at the time, Patti Smith's manager).\n\n13-Jun-72\n\nUS NY,New York City,Mercer Arts Center,Oscar Wilde room\n\nPhoto: Credit Paul Zone (aka Paolo Cilione).

During weekdays ordinarily a gay bathhouse, but Steve added live entertainment on Friday and Saturday at midnight, allowing straights to enter. The most known artist who performed there was Bette Midler (aka \"The Divine Miss M\" or \"Bathouse Betty\"), accompanied by Barry Manilow on piano, Luther Ricks on drums and the Harlettes as back-up singers. Her engagement started in July 1970 and ended in February 1973. Others who performed were (future \"Gilmore Girls\" TV star) Liz Torres, (Warhol superstar) Holly Woodlawn, Manhattan Transfer, Patti LaBelle, Melba Moore, Phoebe Snow, Cab Calloway, etc.. By 1974 the live musical entertainment was scrapped as the gay audience was losing interest.\n\nIn 1972, the New York Dolls did two live show at a bath house.

I didn't think too much about it but I was a big Faces fan and I went to see them at the Wembley Empire Pool and the New York Dolls were the support. They were just something else. I must be one of the few people in England who actually saw the original line-up, because the drummer (Billy Murcia) overdosed not long after that gig. The place was packed, they did a few numbers and Johnny Thunders broke a guitar string. It was a big gig - 13,000 people or something - and they didn't even have a spare guitar. So the gig was held up while somebody went and got a guitar string, and then Thunders put it on with everything turned up. So you've got 10,000 watts of power going weeeea-aaa aw w-ww. People were booing and David Johansen's going \"Aww, fuck you guys,\" with his feather boa on, while Sylvain Sylvain was rollerskating up and down the stage. They started the same number again, got halfway through it and he broke the string again. It was a big eye-opener in terms of attitude. They really didn't give a shit.

Malcolm, Vivienne Westwood and their friend Gerry Goldstein ended up taking a sixth-floor room at the McAlpine Hotel to showcase their \"Let It Rock\" clothes, then sold at their \"Too Fast To Live, Too Young To Die\" shop @ 430 Kings Road. McLaren and Westwood's first visit to New York. The New York Dolls and McLaren meet for the first time.\n\nNote 2: \"Among the visitors to the fair was New York Dolls' guitarist Sylvain Sylvain. [...] `I always went to the fair if I was in town, so dropped by and saw this fellow dressed from head-to-toe as a Teddy Boy,' said Sylvain. 'Vivienne looked amazing as well and they were both very friendly, though when I said something was nice, he would go: \"Ah go on, you can have it\" while she would grumble at him for being unbusiness-like. We really got on well and then it clicked  I remember having gone to their store. [in November 1972, when Malcolm and Vivienne were not present that day]'. McLaren invited Sylvain back for the closing day of the fair; he brought with him the rest of the group: lead guitarist Johnny Thunders, singer David Johansen, drummer Jerry Nolan, bassist Arthur Kane and their associate Peter Jordan, who sometimes depped for Kane. 'They had some great things: Jerry Lee Lewis underpants and English-style 50s shirts, like Billy Fury and Adam Faith would have worn,' said Jordan. McLaren hadn't heard of the New York Dolls; in fact, he had been deliberately isolating himself from developments in contemporary pop and rock music since the early 1960s [...]\" from \"The Life & Times of Malcolm McLaren: The Biography\", a book by Paul Gorman.\n\nIn his autobiography book \"There's No Bones in Ice Cream\", Sylvain writes that the encounter took place in the spring of 1971, but this is impossible because at the time McLaren was still a student at Goldsmiths art school and Westwood was a schoolteacher in Brixton. On top of that their \"Too Fast To Live, Too Young To Die\" shop was only opened in January/February 1973.\n\nNote 3: The National (Fashion and) Boutique Show was a four-day trade show @ the Hotel McAlpin.

Coming from that flaming multi-colored head such words are already suspect, but the group of individuals they are aimed at, known professionally as the New York Dolls, react with contemptuous laughter and offer suggestions that can't be recounted in a family publication. Rundgren and the Dolls, you see, share this private joke; a joke they're in the midst of making public. Written off by many as just another in the wearisome line of glitter pretenders, the New York Dolls are cooking up a bit of brass-knuckled astonishment for those people.\n\nSinger David Johansen strolls over to the plate glass partition which separates the studio from the control room, and scotch-tapes an advertising flier he's just found to the window so that it faces the booth. \"Too fast to live, too young to die,\" it reads, \"LET IT ROCK!\". He spins around the band launches full-throttle into \"Trash,\" an electric explosion that seconds his gesture with a vengeance, and without which his action would've been empty and melodramatic. In that moment it becomes perfectly apparent that the New York Dolls far from being an easy target for anybody's labels are in the midst of creating a category that doesn't even have a name yet.\" From \"New York Dolls Greatest Hits Volume 1\" by Ben Edmonds published in Creem magazine, October 1973.\n\nJun-73\n\nUS NY,New York City-Manhattan,Hotel Chelsea\n\nNote 1: \"On Sylvain's advice, Goldstein, McLaren and Westwood moved out of the 26th Street Holiday Inn to the more suitable Hotel Chelsea [...]. They hosted a party in their room attended by the Dolls and their entourage, which included the socialite Patti D'Arbanville, Bob Colacello, editor of Andy Warhol's Interview, transsexual superstar Candy Darling, actor Michael J. Pollard and Eric Emerson, the Warholite who had appeared in Chelsea Girls and Heat and fronted the similarly glam-punk the Magic Tramps. `Our entertainment was our rack of clothes from Too Fast to Live Too Young to Die (we wanted everyone to try them on), a punch bowl, some Hula Hoops and the reggae soundtrack of the Jimmy Cliff film, The Harder They Come,' said McLaren. `Guests screamed from the balcony of the hotel down to the streets below, welcoming everyone up. Some peed out of the window.\n\n'Nights were spent attending the Dolls gigs at Max's Kansas City and connecting with the city's demi-monde including punk poet Patti Smith and the face-tattooed `Witch of Positano' Vali Myers. `We had a very wild time,' said McLaren. 'This was the first time I did cocaine and also my first exposure to all sorts of sexual deviancy, voyeurs filming people being whipped, that sort of thing.'[...] At the end of [August] the Dolls departed for Los Angeles and the Brits returned to London, McLaren infused with New York's street energy and ambitious to up the stakes at 430 King's Road.\" from \"The Life & Times of Malcolm McLaren: The Biography\", a book by Paul Gorman.\n\nNote 2: In November 2022, Paul Gorman updated me with new information he received/uncovered that McLaren and the others only were in New York for the first 10 days of June.

It was a new development, and it was expensivetwenty-five dollars a month. Very few homes were wired for it. Part of the licensing deal was that the cable company, Manhattan Cable, would have two channels available for public use, and I decided to put on a show, \"Bob Gruen's Rock and Roll\". Every month, I'd book two half-hour blocks and two one-hour blocks, all at odd times during the week when I thought rock-and-roll people might be watching television. There was no host, just some crude handwritten titles that I would shoot for the beginning and end of each \"episode.\" I never got much of a reaction from it. I was just doing it hoping that somebody would be watching, although I wasn'tthey were only wiring up the wealthy neighborhoods!

So besides all these art people coming to the Waldorf and dressing up in costumes, Wolfman Jack was broadcasting from the gig and telling people, Come down here!

We had a costume contest, and we had a distinguished panel, judges like Rex Reed. Ridiculous prizes. A weekend for three at a lovely motel close to the Newark airport. There was a drag queen who was into dress design. He took the contest very seriously, and insisted that he won. \" David Johansen interviewed for Vulture/New York Magazine March 26, 2014.\n\n07-Aug-73\n\nUS PA,Pittsburgh-Wilkinsburg,Alpine Arena\n\n[support for Mott The Hoople and Blue Öyster Cult]\n\nAd: Scan of ad.\n\n14-Aug-73\n\nUS WI,Milwaukee,Riverside Theatre\n\n[support for Mott The Hoople and Blue Öyster Cult]\n\nPoster: Photo of poster.\n\nNote: Unlikely that the Dolls played as they had a show the same night at My Father's Place, 900 miles away.\n\n14-Aug-73\n\nUS NY,Long Island,Roslyn,My Father's Place\n\n15-Aug-73\n\nUS NY,Long Island,Roslyn,My Father's Place\n\n16-Aug-73\n\nUS NY,Long Island,Roslyn,My Father's Place\n\nAd: Scan of ad taken from the Village Voice 09-Aug-73.\n\nxx-Aug-73\n\nUS NY,Hampton Bays,Hot Dog Beach,bar\n\nNote: On a Saturday afternoon ('Happy Hour') beach party. \"[Twisted Sister] were playing a club called the Mad Hatter [in East Quogue].

Wed just come from London where wed raided Viviennes [Westwood] shop and got the loveliest things which we were trading back and forth between us. Were on stage in the mid-afternoon and Arthur was wearing these big white aviator boots that kind of glowed in the dark and this kid in the front row put some LSD on the front of his boots. The whole band had been drinking a lot, and basically Johnny didnt go to the john [toilet] before the show so were on the third or fourth song, and he had to go. He said something to David and walked right off. That really pissed David off. How could anybody walk off when he was about to sing? I filled in and played some blues Lone Star Queen, and the kids started clapping along, Jerry got into it, swinging on a beat and David started blowing the harp, so it wasnt that bad. Johnny came back, hed taken a leak behind an amp but the gig ended with a spat between David and Johnny. from \"Too Much Too Soon\", book by Nina Antonia.\n\n03-Dec-73\n\nFR Paris,TV show\n\n(afternoon)\n\nNote:\"The day began with the news that [their managers] Marty Thau and Steve Leber had returned to New York, leaving the group without any funds.

[...] Once The Dolls emerged, it transpired that the road crew had been dawdling in their duties and were five hours behind schedule in setting up the equipment at the television studio.

Their show was also no more than that of a starting housewives orchestra, which plunges into pop music. It remains incomprehensible that this group is doing so well with critics and with record companies alike. A singer without any volume. A bass player who apparently cannot tune his instrument. Two guitarists who can only play three chords on their guitar and a drumming lumberjack are presented as if they are the Rolling Stones of the 70s. However, the audience at the Paradiso clearly didn't appreciate them. Witness were the meager applause drowned out by whistling.\"\n\nAd: Ad from Dutch paper.\n\n08-Dec-73\n\nNL Sittard,Stadsschouwburg\n\nAd: Scan taken from Aloha music magazine 4#16, dated 06/20-Dec-1973.\n\nReview: Review taken from Limburgsch dagblad 15-Dec-73. \" New York Dolls: fiasco. The performance of the group, which has been described as the best hard-rock formation since the Rolling Stones, was a major fiasco. [..] As a result [of their absurd food demands], the group arrived two hours late at the theater, where seven hundred young people were waiting impatiently. Once on stage, the group did not bother to adapt the sound of their precious installation to the acoustics of the hall: the musical qualities of The Dolls were lost in the deafening noise. The group refused to make any contact with the audience. The public reacted fiercely when The New York Dolls decided to stop after a one hour. [..] It is therefore a question for me whether The New York Dolls will ever break through.\"\n\n09-Dec-73\n\nNL Amsterdam,Universiteit\n\nNote: Disrupted by homophobic protestors.\n\n10-Dec-73\n\nBE Brussel,BRT TV (@ Flageyplein Studio 6)\n\nBinnen en Buiten-TV show\n\nSetlist: \"Jet Boy\" (playback in the studio).\n\nNote: Recording date.
