Each person included in the study was determined using information from Wikipedia and Wikidata.\n\nEach celebrity’s notability is based on a selection of things, including the number of Wikipedia editions with each individual, the length of their biographies, the number of views for each between 2015 and 2018, and the amount of information retrieved on each person. Geographer and map designer Topi Tjukanov has turned the data into an interactive map pinpointing exactly where each famous face is from.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nThrowback photos show The Beatles visiting Bangor 55 years ago\n\nStrictly Come Dancing's 19 previous winners and their most memorable moments ahead of 2022 series\n\nBelow is a selection of the \"most notable people'' from North Wales.
