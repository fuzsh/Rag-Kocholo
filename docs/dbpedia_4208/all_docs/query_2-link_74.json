        "text": "There are a number of Hull street names that are cause for a bit of tongue-twisting.\n\nRoads such as Wincolmlee and Whitefriargate are oddly-titled but familiar to local people, even if they do not know the heritage of those names. Visitors from out of the area may be bemused and amused in equal measure by the likes of Milky Way and Land of Green Ginger.\n\nThe late Hull historian John Markham uncovered the reasons for the more oddly named streets and roads that crop up across Hull in his book “Streets Of Hull: A History Of Their Names”. It is fascinating to know just how some of them came about.\n\nRead more: See Hull in 1983 as fascinating photos show city scenes from 40 years ago\n\nEven if a street is obviously named after a person, in lots of cases, just who that was and why they were honoured in this way has been lost to the past. Here is just a selection of Hull’s strangest street names and their backgrounds.\n\nStoneferry Road\n\nFrom as early as 1269 a river crossing existed here that was known as a Stanfordrak, but by the 14th century it was referred to locally as Stone Ferry. The small ferry ran from one side of the River Hull to the other and provided a much-needed crossing place for local tradesmen and farmers.\n\nWhitefriargate\n\nThis title is a nod to Hull’s monastic past. Named after the Carmelite friars – or white friars, on account of the colour of part of their habits - who arrived in 1293, the street has been a thoroughfare for traffic as well as a pedestrianised shopping street. It's future remains uncertain with development of flats and independent businesses starting to replace traditional High Streetg shopping names.\n\nBesides Whitefriargate, there is also Blackfriargate in the city, It was named after the Dominican order of monks who wore black.\n\nLand of Green Ginger\n\nThe name of this narrow street at the end of Whitefriargate has been raising eyebrows, and smiles, for years. Home to the George Hotel, which makes the proud boast of having the world's smallest window, Land of Green Ginger was once known as Old Beverley Street.\n\nWhile no one is completely sure where the new name came from, some think it refers to the Middle Ages when ginger was sold and stored there. Others believe a Dutch family with the surname Lindegreen lived there and named it.\n\nArthur Lucan Close\n\nArthur Lucan (born Arthur Towle) was an English actor who performed the drag act Old Mother Riley on stage, radio and screen, with a series of comedy films from the late 1930s to the early 1950s. Lincolnshire born, Lucan left home to pursue a career in music hall and was last seen on stage at the Theatre Royal, Barnsley, on May 14, 1954 in a touring stage adaptation of Old Mother Riley in Paris.\n\nThree days later, Lucan died, aged 68, at the Tivoli Theatre, in Hull. He collapsed in the wings and died shortly afterwards in his dressing room, and is buried in Hull’s Eastern Cemetery. Arthur Lucan Close, off Preston Road in east Hull, is named in his honour.\n\nDagger Lane\n\nA slightly sinister name but actually this isn;t a murderous alleyway in Hull's Old Town. Previously known as both Champaign Street and Hutchinson Lane, around the time it was paved in the mid-1700s, it became known as Daggard Lane. Nowadays it is Dagger Lane, running between Posterngate and Castle Street. It is home to the Humber Lodge of Freemasons No 57, which boasts the oldest purpose-built Lodge Room in this part of the country, having been in constant use since 1804.\n\nWincolmlee\n\nProbably one of the most unusual street names the city possesses, legend has it the name comes from a pub landlady with a distinctive wink. Experts believe, however, it is actually a combination of three Old English words – “wincel”, which means a corner or angular piece of land; “holme”, the old name for an island and “leah”, a field or meadow. Its origin as a field in the corner of an island certainly reflects the old network of ancient drains running into the River Hull in this area.\n\nBowlalley Lane\n\nSome names are more obvious than others. Receiving this title in the late 18th century, Bowlalley Lane, in Hull’s Old Town, was named due to there having been a green for playing bowls within the grounds of a manor house that was once situated there. Paul Gibson’s Hull and East Yorkshire History notes: “It was mentioned in a newspaper advertisement in 1787 when it was described as ‘a clean and retired street nearly in the centre of the town of Kingston upon Hull, with every requisite, out-office, and a spacious garden behind the same’.” More recently, it has been a favoured spot for film makers in Hull because of it's historic buildings.\n\nRavenspurn Grove\n\nRavenspurn was an East Riding town that was lost due to coastal erosion. One of more than 30 along the Holderness coast which have been lost to the North Sea since the 19th century, the town was located close to the end of the peninsula that continues to survive and is known as Spurn Head.\n\nHenry Boot Way\n\nHenry Boot Developments (HBD) oversaw the three-decade-long transformation of the business park, Priory Park, in Hessle, previously a 150-acre brownfield site. HBD said the project had been “transformative for Hull, acting as a catalyst for economic growth, creating thousands of jobs and boosting the skills base across the region”.\n\nThe main route running through the development, Henry Boot Way, is named after HBD founder Henry Boot, the son of a farmer in the Sheffield area, who served a seven-year joinery apprenticeship and gained over 20 years’ practical experience with large local building firms before launching out on his own in 1886. Progress from initial jobbing work was rapid and he soon successfully moved into larger scale public works and housing projects.\n\nTrippett Street\n\nMuch of Sculcoates – the area north of the city centre and south of Sculcoates Lane – is now industrial but for hundreds of years it was also a thriving community. Immediately north of the old town walls was Trippett, roughly where Wincolmlee runs. The origin is unclear but traditionally in England the name Trippet derived from a description for a trickster, magician or medieval entertainer.\n\nIn 1850, grand new baths opened in Trippett Street and were among the first in Britain to include a “mikvah\" – a plunge bath for Hull's thriving Jewish community. The Trippett baths were designed by David Thorp for Hull Corporation and the plunge bath was situated on the first floor in the first-class ladies section. After closing in 1903, the building was taken over for Hull's first telephone exchange but was later to be destroyed in the Second World War.\n\nChevy Chase\n\nLocated in east Hull, some people may be forgiven for thinking this unusual address comes from the American comedian and star of National Lampoon, who goes by the same name. However, the name dates back hundreds of year to the Ballad of Chevy Chase, a medieval folk song which first came to light in the 1500s.\n\nMilky Way\n\nOne to delight the children when touring around the city centre, the Milky Way isn't the entrance to a galactic adventure but actually named after the historic site of one of Hull's largest firms, Northern Dairies. Milky Way was the sire if the Northern Dairies plant just off Spring Bank and is located between Colonial Street and Spring Street. Oddly Milky Way was a brand and slogan used by Unigate, another major dairy.\n\nRead more:"
