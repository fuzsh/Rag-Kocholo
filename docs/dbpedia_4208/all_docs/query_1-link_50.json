        "text": "<< Unreleased Songs & Demos\n\nTweet\n\nCollaborations, 1985-1994 >>\n\nRoger Taylor Collaborations\n\n1970-1985\n\nThis page features details of Roger Taylor's collaborations with other artists, recorded between 1970 and 1985.\n\nSome sources also suggest that Roger appears on 'Whadda You Want From Me' by Billy Squier, and 'Free Me' by Roger Daltrey. However, several other sources, including the Queen Fan Club's biography, do not have any mention of these tracks, so it is likely that Roger was not involved.\n\nNostradamus\n\nAl Stewart\n\n, 1973. Roger plays percussion. Length 9:44.\n\nAvailable on the 'Past, Present And Future' album.\n\nAvailable Versions:\n\n1. Album version (9:44) (on 'Past, Present And Future' and probably various compilations)\n\n2. Single version (3:28) (released as the B-side to the 'Swallow Wind' single, and also included on the 2015 album reissue; this loses a lengthy intro and middle instrumental section, and some of the outro, none of which feature Roger)\n\nLyrics:\n\nIn the east\n\nThe wind is blowing\n\nThe boats across the sea\n\nAnd their sails\n\nWill fill the morning\n\nAnd their cries\n\nRing out to me\n\nMmm-mmm-mmm\n\nOh\n\nThe more it changes\n\nThe more it stays the same\n\nAnd the hand\n\nJust re-arranges\n\nThe players in the game\n\nMmm-mmm-mmm\n\nOh, I had a dream\n\nIt seemed I stood alone\n\nAnd the veil of all the years\n\nGoes sinking from my eyes like a stone\n\nA king shall fall and put to death by the English parliament shall be\n\nFire and plague to London come in the year of six and twenties three\n\nAn emperor of France shall rise who will be born near Italy\n\nHis rule cost his empire dear, Napoloron his name shall be\n\nFrom Castile does Franco come and the Government driven out shall be\n\nAn English king seeks divorce, and from his throne cast down is he\n\nOne named Hister shall become a captain of Greater Germany\n\nNo law does this man observe and bloody his rise and fall shall be\n\nMan, man, your time is sand, your ways are leaves upon the sea\n\nI am the eyes of Nostradamus, all your ways are known to me\n\nMan, man, your time is sand, your ways are leaves upon the sea\n\nI am the eyes of Nostradamus, all your ways are known to me\n\nIn the new lands of America three brothers now shall come to power\n\nTwo alone are born to rule but all must die before their hour\n\nTwo great men yet brothers not make the north united stand\n\nIts power be seen to grow, and fear possess the eastern lands\n\nThree leagues from the gates of Rome a Pope named Pol is doomed to die\n\nA great wall that divides a city at this time is cast aside\n\nThese are the signs I bring to you to show you when the time is nigh\n\nMan, man, your time is sand, your ways are leaves upon the sea\n\nI am the eyes of Nostradamus, all your ways are known to me\n\nMan, man, your time is sand, your ways are leaves upon the sea\n\nI am the eyes of Nostradamus, all your ways are known to me"
