        "text": "On several occasions I have responded to people's queries about what radio was like back in the 70s. There tends to be the view that Radio One was all cheesy pop hits and fantabulous DJs. Although there was an element of that of course, it is worth stressing that daytime programming went much further than that. As proof I have found a list I made of Noel Edmonds' breakfast show records of the week. Sorry for the length but I feel that it does give an idea of how Radio One was not quite the Top 30 radio that many people imagine. Indeed most of the items on this list were far removed from the glitter era. Occasionally a surprising choice went on to become a hit (thanks to the plays, no doubt) e.g. Gaudete Steeleye Span, but apart from the big names (Elton, Bowie,...) it is quite amazing how many radio hits only ever made it to the lower reaches of the charts, if even that. Interesting to note the repeated choices of Jim Croce, John Stewart, Paul Williams, McTell, Goodhand-Tait, ... all quality stuff in my opinion. This is the period 73-75. I have more if anyone is interested and was wondering whether anyone ever noted down J Walker's Records of the week from that era or indeed his Ones that got away (which regrettably were often the same...)\n\nSarstedt Brothers - Chinese Restaurant\n\nPaul Williams - Waking up\n\nJackson Sisters – Why Can’t we be more than friends\n\nDetroit Emeralds - I think of You\n\nPhillip Goodhand-Tait – You Are\n\nDavid Bowie – Life on Mars\n\nElton John - Saturday Night’s Alright\n\nRoger Daltrey – I’m Free\n\nHudson Ford – Pick up the Pieces\n\nDella Reese – It if feels Good\n\nNeil Diamond – the Long way Home\n\nDon Downing – Lonely Days, Lonely Nights\n\nJackson 5 – Skywriter\n\nStrawbs – Shine on Silver Sun\n\nBob Dylan – Knockin on Heaven’s Door\n\nKiki Dee – Amoreuse\n\nLinda Lewis - Play around\n\nJohn Stewart – A man called Armstrong\n\nEddie Kendricks – Keep on Truckin\n\nDoobie Brothers – China Grove\n\nDavid Essex – Lamplight\n\nJim Croce – I got a Name\n\nBob Seger – Rosalie\n\nDr Hook – Life ain’t easy\n\nSteeleye Span – Gaudete\n\nGallagher + Lyle – Shine a light\n\nLeo Sayer – The show must go on\n\nSeals + Crofts – We may never pass this way again\n\nPrelude – After the Goldrush\n\nMelanie – Will you Love me tomorrow\n\nJoni Mitchell – Raised on Robbery\n\nPaul Williams Inspiration\n\nHollies The air that I breathe\n\nHudson Ford – Burn baby Burn\n\nIsaac Hayes – Joy\n\nElton John – Candle in the wind\n\nSteeleye Span – Thomas the Rhymer\n\nGraham Nash – On the line\n\nHot chocolate – Emma\n\nKevin Johnson – Rock n roll\n\nHarry Chapin – WOLD\n\nLindisfarne – Taking care of business\n\nPhillip Goodhand Tait – Reach out\n\nStaple Singers – If you’re ready\n\nJim Stafford – Spiders and Snakes\n\nMelanie – Love to lose again\n\nR Dean Taylor There’s a ghost\n\nAretha Franklin – I’m in Love\n\nHues Corporation – Freedom for the stallion\n\nLeo Sayer – One man band\n\nNeil Diamond – Shilo\n\nJim Capaldi – It’s all up to you\n\nHall + Oates – When the morning comes\n\nBW Stevenson – The river of love\n\nAndy Kim – Rock me gently\n\nHues Corporation – Rock the boat\n\nRab Noakes – Branch\n\nJohn Denver – Annie’s song\n\nPaul Williams – That’s what friends are for\n\nHarry Chapin – Cat’s in the cradle\n\nAmerica Tin Man\n\nJim Capaldi Eve\n\nTymes You Little Trustmaker\n\nGary Shearston – I get a kick\n\nJohn Stewart – July you’re a woman\n\nDetroit Spinners – Then came you\n\nChris Rainbow –Give me what I cry for\n\nBarry White –You’re the first, the last\n\nJohnny Bristol – Memories don’t leave\n\nRalph mc Tell Streets of London\n\nString Driven Thing Mrs O riley\n\nGallagher and Lyle We\n\nLove Unlimited It may be winter outside\n\nBrian Protheroe Fly now\n\nRupert Holmes The National Pastime\n\nDean Parrish – I’m on my way\n\nRighteous Bros – Dream On\n\nLinda Lewis Remember the Days\n\nRonnie Williams Only dreaming\n\nElton John Philadelphia Freedom\n\nRufus stop on by\n\nClifford T Ward Jig Saw Girl\n\nRalph mc Tell El Progresso\n\nKiki Dee How Glad I am\n\nHarry Chapin – I wanna learn a love song\n\nBilly Joel Piano Man\n\nHayward + Lodge I dreamed last night\n\nZero Moonlight\n\nJudy Collins – Send in the clowns\n\nNeil Sedaka The Immigrant\n\nDolly Parton – Bargain store\n\nDoobie Brothers – Take me in your arms\n\nCarly Simon Attitude dancing\n\nRay Stevens Misty\n\nRoberta Flack Feel like making love\n\nJim Croce I’ll have to say I love you in a song\n\nMichael Murphy- Wild Fire\n\nDion Make the woman love me\n\nRonnie Mc Neir Wendy is Gone\n\nBarry Mann I’m a survivor\n\nEric Clapton – Knockin on heaven’s door\n\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band All I have to do is dream\n\nLeo Sayer Moonlighting\n\nLesley Gore Immortality\n\n4 Seasons-Who Loves you\n\nDawn Morning Beautiful\n\nHayward and Lodge Blue guitar\n\nJim Capaldi Love Hurts\n\nBee Gees Nights on Broadway\n\nGoons Bloodnok’s rock’n roll\n\nGladys Knight Part time love\n\nHall + Oates She’s Gone (reissue)\n\nRalph Mc Tell Dreams of you\n\nJoan Baez Diamonds and Rust\n\nKiki Dee Once a fool\n\nGreg Lake I believe in Father Christmas\n\nBarbara Dickson – Answer me\n\nOsibisa Sunshine Day\n\nGloria Gaynor How high the moon\n\nRonnie Lane – Don’t try and change my mind\n\nHarold Melvin Wake up Everybody\n\nNeil Sedaka Breaking up is hard to do (slow version)\n\nAllman Brothers Jessica\n\nTarney + Spencer – I’m your man\n\nI Am not Sure if it was A Record of the Week I recoll he use to Play this A Lot Aroud 1978 the Song 10 to 8"
