        "text": "I always look forward to the monthly Cherry Red newsletter and every once in a while I see something interesting but June 2015 looks one of the best months in a long time!\n\nFirst off, I couldn't believe it when I saw The Complete Recordings Of The Stormsville Shakers with Phillip Goodhand-Tait listed because I knew that it would have to include \"Do You Dream\" by Circus, one of the best pop-psych songs of all time! This song has appeared on CD before but always from a very obvious vinyl source. Here's hoping that this set was remastered from a good tape source.\n\nhttp://shop.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=5040\n\nNext up is a 2 CD \"acid folk\" collection, Dust On The Nettles: A Journey Through The British Underground Folk Scene 1967-1972, with a great song selection.\n\nhttp://shop.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=5079\n\nThen there's 60 Songs From The Cramps Crazy Collection: The Incredibly Strange Music Box with what looks like a super eclectic mix of vintage weirdness!\n\nhttp://shop.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=5038\n\nTo top it off we get two newly remastered \"From The Original Master Tapes\" deluxe edition sets:\n\nJUNIOR'S EYES - BATTERSEA POWER STATION (1969)\n\nhttp://shop.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=5077\n\nPROCUL HARUM - PROCUL HARUM (1967)\n\nhttp://shop.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=5072\n\nBoth of these titles have been released before but it looks like there are a few previously unreleased tracks included on both.\n\nWell, needless to say I'm psyched!\n\nObviously, I also lovethe Cherry Red family. Their CDs make up a good percentage of my collection (mostly RPM, Rev-Ola, Now Sounds, Esoteric and Grapefruit) and I always look forward to their new releases. However, the Cherry Red CD reissues I've purchased in the past few years have been very inconsistent as far as sound quality goes. Some have been remastered from the original first generation tapes (The Cowsills/The Poets/The Collage/Book A Trip Vol. 1 & 2) while others have been remastered from vinyl with heavy processing and noise reduction (Peppermint Trolley Company/The Fun and Games/Tommy Roe/Love, Poetry & Revolution).\n\nIt seems kind of unusual for a reissue label to have such extreme examples in their catalog. Other quality reissue labels such as Rhino have been known to use vinyl sources but as far as I know the results were never this obvious. The vinyl-sourced Cherry Red CDs that I own are still quite enjoyable and a few of the titles sound better than the versions I had previously created myself from my own records (without using noise reduction). I have also noticed some heavy-handed compression in some of their more recent reissues but not to the extent that it’s a deal breaker for me.\n\nFor the kind of music I enjoy most (60’s pop/psych/sunshine pop) their catalog is second to none. It’s obvious that for the people that oversee those labels (Mark Stratford, Joe Foster, Steve Stanley, Mark Powell, David Wells, etc.) it’s been a labor of love. Overall, I am very happy with my Cherry Red label CDs and they are in constant rotation in my house. Despite some of their shortcomings sound-wise, those CDs are a cornerstone of my collection and I know that they will continue to bring me enjoyment for many years to come."
