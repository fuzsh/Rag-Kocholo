And I don't mean like New York or Hollywood or places where famous people are known to be\n\nSubject: Re: Famous people from your area\n\nWritten By: Henk\n\nNah, not really. The only two people I can think of may be (very) famous in my country, but are hardly known elsewhere.\n\nFirst, there's Ard Schenk, a former speed skater -triple Olympic Champion, triple World Champion and triple European Champion.\n\nHe was born in Anna Paulowna, a small village less than 10 miles from where I live.\n\nThe other one is Anton Pieck (1895 - 1987), a painter, artist and graphic artist, who was born in Huisduinen (which basically is a quarter of Den Helder nowadays). He was responsible for the look and layout of the Fairytale Forest Park De Efteling, the largest theme park of The Netherlands, attracting some 4 million visitors each year.\n\nSubject: Re: Famous people from your area\n\nWritten By: Henk\n\nWell, obviously I don't know everything... :-Edward W. Bok, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, was born in Den Helder, as were Nobel Prize-winning physicist Gerard 't Hooft and former ABA/NBA player Swen Nater.\n\nBut perhaps the most famous (of his time) was Dorus Rijkers (1847 - 1924), a lifeboat captain, most famous for his sea rescues of 487 shipwrecked victims over a total of 38 rescue operations, and at least 25 before joining the lifeboat-service.\n\nSubject: Re: Famous people from your area\n\nWritten By: danootaandme\n\nIn the city I live:\n\nKiller Kowalski( for all you wrestling fans) lived here until his demise a couple of years ago.\n\nGary Cherone who played for a while with Extreme and Van Halen(his brother teaches Special Ed at our high school)\n\nEd Ames- Actor\n\nNorman Greenbaum- \"Spirit in the Sky\"\n\nFrank Stella - Artist\n\nSubject: Re: Famous people from your area\n\nWritten By: Howard\n\nRUN DMC is from Hollis Queens.\n\nSubject: Re: Famous people from your area\n\nWritten By: loki 13\n\nMt. Ephraim used to to be home to many pro ball players playing for philadelphia teams, Haddonfield is that town now.\n\nNeighboring towns:\n\nHaddon Heights was home to Willie Mosconi (pro pool player) and Steven Speilberg (film director).\n\nAudubon is the home of Joe Flacco (NFL quaterback) and Merle Reagle (Crossword constructor).\n\nMichael Landon and Kelly McGillis called Collingswood home for awhile.\n\nFrom the town I was born and spent 40 years of my life:\n\nCamden was home to Walt Whitman (essayist, poet), Nick Virgilio (haiku poet), Mike Rozier (NFL), Rawley Eastwick (MLB)\n\nRichard Hollingshead (inventor of the drive-in theater), Dajaun Wagner (NBA), and Dwight Muhammad Qawi (Dwight Braxton-\n\nlight heavy weight boxer).\n\nSubject: Re: Famous people from your area\n\nWritten By: snozberries\n\nDid I mention I spent a year in the Film Studies program with Jack Johnson...course I didn't know him, nor had any clue until he gave a concert here a couple years ago that we probably crossed paths thousands of times.\n\nInteresting article about his time here\n\nFamous UCSB alumni:\n\nBenjamin Bratt (Law & Order)\n\nMichael Douglas (yeah...Kirk's son)\n\nDon Hertzfeldt (Academy Award nominated animator)\n\nGwenyth Paltrow\n\nJim Rome (sports announcer)\n\nEric Roth (writer, Forest Gump & Munich)\n\nScott Frank (writer, Out of Sight, Minority Report, & The Lookout)\n\nHarvey Levin (TMZ)\n\nand a bunch of people I didn't know you may know.... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara_people\n\nSubject: Re: Famous people from your area\n\nWritten By: quirky_cat_girl\n\nFamous people from Westmoreland County (which is the county I live in) and Allegheny County (Pittsburgh, PA)\n\nActress, Frances McDormand\n\nActress, Shirley Jones\n\nActress, Angela Jones (was in Pulp Fiction)\n\nLillian Peacock, who was a silent film actress, was actually from Scottdale (where I live).\n\nFred Rogers (Mr. Rogers)\n\nJeff Goldblum\n\nMichael Keaton\n\nGene Kelly\n\nComedian, Dennis Miller\n\nComedian, Marty Allen\n\nChristina Aguilera\n\nBrett Michaels\n\nMeh, the list goes on and on.
