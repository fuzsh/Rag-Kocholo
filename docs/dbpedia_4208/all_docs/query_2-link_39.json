        "text": "This page offers a detailed timeline of the main historical, literary, and cultural events connected with British slavery, abolition, and emancipation between 1701 and 1800. It also includes references to the most significant events taking place outside of the British zone of influence.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, an informal British Empire was established in competition with the other major European powers and Britain became the foremost slave-trading nation. By the end of the century, however, doubts about slavery at home and the loss of the North American colonies had significantly altered both Britain's imperial and slave-trading roles. A vigorous public debate about the slave trade took place between 1785 and 1795, but the opportunity to abolish either slavery or the slave trade was lost.\n\nWhile there is plenty of detail in this timeline, and I regularly add more information, it is of course impossible to record every event related to slavery and abolition in this period. This timeline is therefore only intended to provide an overview of the topic. If there is something I have left out that you think should be included, please let me know.\n\nClick on a date in the list below, or scroll down the page, for information. Links are given to pages on this website only. For my sources and for further reading, look at the page Further Reading: Slavery, Abolition, and Emancipation.\n\n1400-1500 | 1501-1600 | 1601-1700 | 1701 | 1725 | 1750 | 1775 | 1800 | 1801-1900 | 1901-2003\n\n1701\n\n1712\n\nApril 1712: an uprising of enslaved people takes place in New York. Eight white colonists are killed and many buildings burned down.\n\n7 June 1712: The Pennsylvania Assembly passes An Act to prevent the importation of Negroes, arguably the first piece of antislavery legislation in the British Empire. It is overturned by the Privy Council the following year.\n\n1713\n\n31 January 1713: Birth of Anthony Benezet in St. Quentin, France. Benezet would go on to be one of the most important Quaker abolitionists of the mid-eighteenth century.\n\n1 May 1713: Spain awards the British South Sea Company the Asiento de Negros for thirty years - effectively giving Britain control of the Atlantic slave trade. The South Sea Company works with the Royal African Company to tranport tens of thousands of enslaved people across the Atlantic in the coming decades.\n\n12 August 1713: The Quaker Yearly Meeting in London writes to Friends in Pennsylvania telling them that slave trading 'is not a Commendable nor allowed Practice', but little action follows.\n\n1715\n\n1715: John Hepburn, a Quaker from New Jersey, publishes The American Defence of the Christian Golden Rule, or, An Essay to prove the Unlawfulness of making Slaves of Men. Although it did not circulate widely, it contained almost every argument against slavery used by abolitionists over the coming century.\n\n1720\n\n19 October 1720: Birth of John Woolman in New Jersey. Woolman would go on to be one of the most important Quaker abolitionists of the mid-eighteenth century.\n\n1725\n\n1727\n\n27 June 1727: The Quaker Yearly Meeting in London again writes to Friends in Pennsylvania telling them that slave trading 'is not a Commendable nor allowed Practice'. This provokes debate among Friends in Philadephia.\n\n1728\n\nSeptember 1728: Increased conflict between British troops and the maroon community in Jamaica leads to the start of the First Maroon War. The maroons - former slaves living in independent communities - would conduct a guerilla war against the British for over a decade.\n\n1729\n\n1729: According to his biographer Joseph Jekyll, Ignatius Sancho is born aboard a ship in mid-Atlantic.\n\n1 February 1729: In Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin publishes A brief examination of the practise of the times, an antislavery tract written by the Pennsylvanian Quaker Ralph Sandiford.\n\n1730\n\nOctober 1730: The 'Chesapeake Rebellion', an uprising of several hundred enslaved people in Virginia, ends with the brutal supression of the rebels.\n\n1733\n\n1733: In Rhode Island, the Nantucket Quaker Elihu Coleman publishes A testimony against that antichristian practice of making slaves of men. Although this does not circulate widely, it is nonetheless the first officially sanctioned antislavery text in the Quaker tradition.\n\n25 July 1733: Birth of James Ramsay, who would go on to be an important early abolitionist.\n\n23 November 1733: A group of at least 150 enslaved Africans on the Danish Caribbean island of St. John take control of the colony's sugar plantations. The Danish authorities take almost a year to regain control of the island, making the event one of the longest uprisings of the eighteenth century.\n\n1735\n\n10 November 1735: Birth of Granville Sharp in Durham. Sharp would go on to be one of the earliest British abolitionists.\n\n1737\n\nSpring 1737: In Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin publishes All Slave-keepers that keep the Innocent in Bondage, Apostates, an antislavery tract written by the Pennsylvanian Quaker Benjamin Lay.\n\n1738\n\nSeptember 1738: Benjamin Lay performs his famous 'bladder of blood' protest at the Philadephia Yearly Meeting of Quakers in which he likens slave trading to stabbing the Bible. The stunt spatters those present with fake blood (hidden inside a bladder in a hollowed-out Bible, which he stabbed with a sword), and was successful in drawing attention to cruelty of slavery, but Lay was swiftly disowned by the Quakers.\n\n1739\n\n9 September 1739: In South Carolina, a group of enslaved Africans led by a slave called Jemmy, or Cato, take up arms against their enslavers. The Stono Rebellion, also known as Cato's Rebellion, leads to the death of 25 colonists and up to 50 slaves.\n\n1740\n\n1740: The Jamaican maroon communities under Nanny of the Maroons and others sign a peace treaty with the British, ending the First Maroon War. The British recognise the maroons, but the maroons are forced to accept the slavery system on the island.\n\n10 May 1740: In response to the 1739 Stono Rebellion, the South Carolina Assembly passes the Negro Act 1740, which introduces harsh new restrictions and punishments for the colony's enslaved population. The Act remains in force until 1865.\n\n1741\n\nMarch 1741: A series of fires in New York City leads to a mass panic among the colonists who come to belive in a conspiracy by enslaved people. Although historians are unsure whether such a conspiracy in fact existed, hundreds of slaves are arrested and, by the late summer, dozens had been convicted and hanged and hundreds transported out of the colony.\n\n1743\n\nSeptember 1743: Philadelphia Quakers add the question 'do Friends observe the former advice of our Yearly Meeting, not to Encourage the Importation of Negroes not to buy them after imported' to the 'Queries' which all Quakers in the colony were required to answer.\n\n1750\n\n1754\n\nFebruary 1754: John Woolman publishes Some Considerations on the keeping of Negroes in Phildelphia. This re-opens the debate about slavery among Pennsylvania Quakers.\n\nSeptember 1754: Anthony Benezet, working with John Woolman, publishes An Epistle of Caution and Advice Concerning the Buying and Keeping of Slaves in Phildelphia. This pamphlet, sanctioned by the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, would begin the work of formally turning Quakers away from slave trading.\n\n1755\n\n1755: By his own account, Olaudah Equiano is born in present-day Nigeria, although there is now a debate over whether he may in fact have been born in South Carolina.\n\n1758\n\nSeptember 1758: After several days of debate, the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Quakers expresses 'an Unanimous Concern prevailing to put a stop to the Increase of the Practice of Importing buying selling or keeping Slaves for term of Life' and advises that the Christian Golden Rule should 'induce such Friends who have any Slaves to sett them at Liberty'.\n\n1759\n\n24 August 1759: Birth of William Wilberforce in Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire. Wilberforce would go on to be one of the most important British abolitionists.\n\n1760\n\n28 March 1760: Birth of Thomas Clarkson in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. Clarkson would go on to be one of the most important British abolitionists.\n\n7 April 1760: In Jamaica, a large number of enslaved Africans led by Tacky rise up with the intention of creating an independent Black state. The uprising is quickly put down, and Tacky killed, but the event inspires further rebellions across the island. By the end of 'Tacky's War' later in the year, about 60 colonists and 400 slaves had been killed. The war profoundly disturbed public opinion in Britain and while some urged harsher discipline, others began to question whether the slavery system could be sustained.\n\n1761\n\n14 May 1761: The London Yearly Meeting of Quakers issue what they call 'a strong minute' on slavery in which they 'recommend it earnestly to the care of Friends every where to discourage as much as in them lies a practice so repugnant to our Christian profession and to deal with all such as shall persevere in a Conduct so reproachful to the Society & disown them if they desist not therefrom'. This effectively makes the Society of Friends the world's first antislavery organisation.\n\n1764\n\n1764: The former slave trader John Newton is ordained into the Church of England and publishes An Authentic Narrative of Some Remarkable And Interesting Particulars in which he expresses few reservations about his former career.\n\n1767\n\n1767: Anthony Benezet publishes A Caution and Warning to Great Britain and her Colonies, in a short representation of the calamitous state of the enslaved negroes in the British Dominions in Phildelphia. The pamphlet would inspire Granville Sharp and others to take action against the slave trade.\n\n1769\n\n1769: Granville Sharp publishes A Representation of the injustice and dangerous tendency of admitting the least claim of private property in the persons of men, in England, etc in London, the first major work of antislavery by a British author.\n\n1770\n\nMay 1770: The Scottish philosopher James Beattie publishes An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth which contains important arguments against racism.\n\n1771\n\nOctober 1771: Anthony Benezet publishes Some Historical Account of Guinea in Phildelphia. This comprehensive exposé of the slave trade would inspire a generation of antislavery campaigners.\n\n26 November 1771: James Somerset, a fugitive enslaved African man in London, is recaptured by his owner, Charles Stewart of Boston, who plans to send him to the West Indies. Granville Sharp intervenes and Somerset is ordered to be brought before the court of King's Bench to determine his legal position. This begins the legal battle known as 'the Somerset Case'.\n\n1772\n\nMay 1772: The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Mansfield hears arguments on both sides of the Somerset Case in London. The case attracts widespread public attention.\n\n22 June 1772: Lord Mansfield reaches judgement in the Somerset Case. He rules that no person, whether a slave or otherwise, can be compelled to leave the country against their will. Although this does not in fact make slavery illegal in England, it makes it more difficult to enforce and the judgement is therfore widely interpreted as ending slavery in England.\n\n7 October 1772: Death of American antislavery Quaker John Woolman in York. He died from smallpox while on an antislavery mission to England.\n\nDecember 1772: James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw becomes the first published black author in Britain when his autobiography, A Narrative of the Most Remarkable Particulars in the Life of James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, An African Prince is published in Bath.\n\n1773\n\n5 June 1773: John Bicknell and Thomas Day publish The Dying Negro. The poem, which went into several editions, was important in drawing public attention to the slave trade.\n\n1774\n\nJanuary 1774: The Methodist leader John Wesley publishes Thoughts Upon Slavery.

Seventeen of the 24 founders are Quakers.\n\n19 April 1775: Years of rising discontent in the British North-American colonies boil over into open war with the battles of Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts. The battles mark the start of the American Revolutionary War, also known as the American War of Independence.\n\n1776\n\n28 June 1776: Thomas Jefferson presents a draft declaration of independence to the American Continental Congress. The draft includes an antislavery passage accusing the British King George III of waging 'a cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most sacred rights of life & liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither'.\n\n4 July 1776: The American Continental Congress ratifies its declaration of independence, but omits the antislavery passages that had been included in earlier drafts.\n\n1777\n\n8 July 1777: In its newly ratified constitution, the Vermont Republic becomes the first territory that is now part of the United States to outlaw slavery.\n\n1780\n\n1 March 1780: The Pennsylvania General Assembly passes An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery, one of the earliest laws enacted by an elected body to abolish slavery.\n\n14 December 1780: Ignatius Sancho dies at his home and shop in Charles Street, Westminster\n\n1781\n\n17 October 1781: British forces surrender to American forces at Yorktown, Virginia, effectively ending the American Revolutionary War.\n\n29 November 1781: Luke Collingwood, the master of the slave ship Zong, which was running short of water and provisions, murders 132 enslaved people by throwing them alive into the sea.

Publication of The Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho, an African.\n\n1783\n\n23 February 1783: The Bishop of Chester, Beilby Porteus, preaches a sermon before the Anglican Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts urging the Church of England to treat the the slaves the church held in the West Indies more humanely and to offer them religious instruction.\n\n6 March 1783: Lord Chief Justice Mansfield rules in court that insurers are liable to pay compensation for the 132 people murdered on the slave ship Zong. The ship's owners are not charged with murder. Olaudah Equiano hears about the judgement and takes the news to legal campaigner Granville Sharp who initiates a public campaign.\n\n22 May 1783: in a second trial in the Zong case, Lord Mansfield overturns his earlier decision and rules that the owners of the ship should not be compensated for the death of the 132 enslaved people that Collingwood had murdered. No further action is taken, but the event outrages public opinion.\n\n3 September 1783: The Treaty of Paris formally ends the war between Great Britain and its former North American colonies, now recognised in international law as the independent United States of America.\n\n1784\n\n3 May 1784: Death of Anthony Benezet in Philadelphia.\n\nAugust 1784: James Ramsay publishes An Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies which, although not condemning slavery outright, provokes a vicious response from West-Indian slaveholders, thereby opening a public debate about slavery and the slave trade.\n\n1786\n\n1 April 1786: Birth of Thomas Fowell Buxton at Castle Hedingham, Essex. Buxton would go on to lead the Anti-Slavery Society in the early nineteenth century.\n\n1 June 1786: Thomas Clarkson publishes An essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species, particularly the African, translated from a Latin Dissertation.
