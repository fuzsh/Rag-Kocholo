        "text": "Image used to solely illustrate subject for an album review, and consistent with Fair Use Doctrine\n\nMaybe this is just my inherent bias as a proud Eighties kid, but I’ve always absolutely adored Can’t Wait to See the Movie, Roger’s seventh solo album, which released June 1987. It’s full of that signature Eighties sound, and has so many incredible songs that also have a timeless feel. It’s a shame this criminally underrated classic only went to #41 in Sweden.\n\nRoger has admitted he wasn’t very ambitious about his solo career, didn’t do nearly enough marketing for his albums, and saw it as just a fun side hobby to fill his time when The Who weren’t touring or making an album. Even after the band broke up, he didn’t approach his solo work like a serious full-time job.\n\nAs he said in 1987, “I know it frustrates the hell out of my record company. If this album is a big success, I’d be happy. But if it just sells enough to recoup its costs, that’s okay by me too. I’m not making them for the money. I’m just doing these solo albums because I want to keep singing. I don’t have The Who to sing in anymore. If I had The Who. . . .”\n\nRoger also made the decision early on, back when he released his first solo album in 1973, that he didn’t want to tour by himself to promote his solo work. Touring was mentally and physically exhausting enough with The Who, and doing it for something he approached as just a hobby didn’t make much sense.\n\nRoger also realised most Who fans weren’t that into his solo stuff, and that he was targeting a different market.\n\nSome contemporary critics lambasted CWTSTM as “too polished,” as though Roger were contractually obligated to only ever make Who-like records and never try anything new. I’ve never understood so-called fans and professional critics who expect artists to spend their entire careers constantly making the same album over and over again. It’s called evolving with a changing musical landscape and experimenting with different styles!\n\nAnd as an Eighties kid, I don’t mind the heavy synths at all! I like that trademark musical calling card of my childhood decade!\n\nTrack listing:\n\n“Hearts of Fire” (written by Russ Ballard) (#88 in the U.K.)\n\n“When the Thunder Comes” (Damon Metrebian and Chas Sandford)\n\n“Ready for Love” (Kit Hain)\n\n“Balance on Wires” (Roger and Don Snow)\n\n“Miracle of Love” (Mark Morgan and Jimmy Scott)\n\n“The Price of Love” (Jack Blades and David Foster)\n\n“The Heart Has Its Reasons” (Jimmy Scott)\n\n“Alone in the Night” (Steve Bates, Larry Lee, Tom Whitlock, Richie Zito)\n\n“Lover’s Storm” (Tom Kelly and Gary Usher)\n\n“Take Me Home” (Roger, Axel Bauer, Michel Eli, Nigel Hinton) (#46 in the U.S.)\n\nMy favourite tracks are “Balance on Wires” (possibly one of the best songs Roger ever wrote, and one of the album’s standouts), “When the Thunder Comes,” and “Hearts of Fire.” The only complaint I have is that “Take Me Home” doesn’t quite feel like a proper closing track!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOne of the Boys, which I consider perhaps Roger Daltrey’s most criminally underrated solo album that deserved much better success, was recorded from November 1976–March 1977 at The Who’s Ramport Studios in London and Pathé Marconi Studios in Paris. Because of tax complications, the vocals had to be recorded in Paris instead of at home.\n\nThe album has a more eclectic sound and consistently high-quality material because Roger enlisted the help of a larger group of songwriters instead of just one or two main people with their own particular style. He also used a lot more musicians than on his previous two solo albums.\n\nFor the third time in a row, Roger’s cousin Graham Hughes designed and photographed the album art. The cover is modelled after René Magritte’s painting Not to Be Reproduced, which also depicts the subject reflected from the back instead of showing his face.\n\nRoger generously let students from a nearby technical school in the Battersea district film the London recording sessions for an educational project they were doing.\n\nRoger co-wrote three of the songs, his first time since “Here for More” in 1970 he’d done any songwriting. When he puts his mind to it, he’s more than capable of producing a nice tune. His musical calling, however, is obviously singing, which is where he’s chosen to focus his strengths and develop his talents.\n\nOne of the Boys was recorded during a six-month sabbatical from The Who, and Roger felt it would finally establish a coherent musical direction for himself as a solo artist. In a 1977 Rolling Stone interview, he said, “It’s always been difficult for me to do that up till now. I’ve always said that if I wanted to make a rock and roll album I’d do it with The Who, because that’s the finest rock and roll vehicle in the world. It would be pointless to do second-best to that. But there are all kinds of music The Who don’t touch.”\n\nIn that interview, Roger also admitted feeling overwhelmed and inhibited by Pete’s constant, excellent supply of songs, “but a solo album seemed a good opportunity to put my own material to the test.” His prior songs were “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” (single; co-written with Pete), “See My Way” (on A Quick One), “Early Morning Cold Taxi” (outtake from The Who Sell Out), and the abovementioned “Here for More” (B-side of “The Seeker”).\n\n“The Prisoner” was inspired by John McVicar, an armed robber and prison escapee whom Roger later portrayed in a 1980 biopic. Roger was so fascinated by his stories of prison life, he bought the film rights to Mr. McVicar’s memoir.\n\nTrack listing, with stars by the bonus tracks:\n\n“Parade” (written by Phillip Goodhand-Tait)\n\n“Single Man’s Dilemma” (Colin Blunstone)\n\n“Avenging Annie” (Andy Pratt) (#88 in the U.S.)\n\n“The Prisoner” (Roger, David Courtney, S. Todd)\n\n“Leon” (Phillip Goodhand-Tait)\n\n“One of the Boys” (Steve Gibbons) (features backing vocals and bass by John Entwistle, whose deep “Boris the Spider” voice you can’t miss)\n\n“Giddy” (Paul McCartney)\n\n“Say It Ain’t So, Joe” (Murray Head)\n\n“Written on the Wind” (Paul Korda) (#46 in the U.K.)\n\n“Satin and Lace” (Roger, David Courtney, Tony Meehan)\n\n“Doing It All Again” (Roger, David Courtney, Tony Meehan)\n\n“You Put Something Better Inside Me”* (Gerry Rafferty, Joe Egan)\n\n“Martyrs and Madmen”* (Steve Swindells)\n\n“Treachery”* (Steve Swindells)\n\nI love every single song on this album! It’s held up so well over time, and is hands-down one of Roger’s strongest, finest solo albums. Sadly, it wasn’t promoted well enough, and only achieved modest chart success (#45 in the U.K., #46 in the U.S., #80 in Australia). I’d highly recommend it as a great place to start exploring Roger’s solo work.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
