        "text": "Hull is home to an array of fabulous places to see a show from large halls to cosy, intimate venues which have made their ways into the annals of history.\n\nFrom the hallowed ground of the Adelphi, to Hull's newest venue, Connexin Live - previously known as the Bonus Arena - more acts than ever are flocking to the region.\n\nAnd while we get a host of great names coming to perform in the city, it can be tempting to moan that some of the biggest acts opt to head for bigger cities rather than venture to our humble home.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n30 faces from a 90s night out at The Room in Hull\n\nKingston Retail Park's Chiquito - photos and memories of missed spot that opened in the 90s\n\nBut before we put our city on the back foot, we need to remember that, once upon a time, Hull welcomed some stars who are now listed among the biggest names in showbiz history.\n\nJimi Hendrix blew away the audience with Purple Haze, The Beatles had crowds sleeping overnight to see them, and Radiohead even chose to stay over at The Campanile.\n\nHere are 17 artists and performers who have been to our city ...\n\nThe Beatles\n\nArguably the biggest band in history, and the group that paved the way for pop music, The Beatles played Hull on three occasions.\n\nThe first time was on October 4, 1962, when the Fab Four debuted in the city at The Majestic Ballroom when they were an unknown quartet who'd just hopped off a ferry from Hamburg.\n\nBy the time they returned in February 1963, their star was firmly in the ascendant and by November 24 of that same year, when they headlined the ABC Theatre, they were well on their way to becoming megastars.\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nThe Rolling Stones played Hull City Hall in September 1964, as part of a UK wide tour taking in 30 venues in almost as many days.\n\nThe Who\n\nThe band’s famous album, Live at Leeds, was originally supposed to be Live at Hull, but the recording of the bass guitar in their live set failed due to technical problems.\n\nThe album was still published, however, allowing people to relive the February 1970 gig, but the Live at Leeds album soared.\n\nThe rock icons most recently visited Hull just last summer, with a performance at Craven Park in July 2023 featuring legends Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey.\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nArguably rock's greatest guitarist, Hendrix made his only appearance in Hull on March 9, 1967. Taking to the stage in a red velvet suit, the American musician's 45-minute set included Purple Haze and many of his other now classics.\n\nSupport at the Jameson Street club, which was later to become Romeo and Juliet's, came from bands including The Family, all for a 12-shilling and six pence entrance fee.\n\nDavid Bowie\n\nThe late, great David Bowie's visit to an Anlaby Road off-licence in 1970 is now the stuff of legend. He is reported to have nipped into the shop with his Hull-raised guitarist Mick Ronson.\n\nRumour has it he would also frequent the Elephant & Castle pub in Holderness Road when he was in the city, and would sit undisturbed at a table in the corner.\n\nCharlie Chaplin\n\nThe legendary comic appeared in Hull on September 17, 1900 - long before he became the world famous movie star. Chaplin appeared at Anlaby Road's Palace Theatre aged just 11 as part of The Eight Lancashire Lads – a music hall clog-dancing troupe.\n\nHarry Houdini\n\nEven by the standards of most celebrity appearances, escape artist Harry Houdini's stay in Hull was particularly spectacular. The famed escapologist was watched by a heaving crowd of 8,000 people as he appeared at Hull's Corporation Dock on April 27, 1914.\n\nOnce he had fought his way through the crowd, he was manacled and thrown into the water. He quickly re-emerged from under the waves holding the manacles - and some mud - above his head.\n\nHe was quickly whisked away by a waiting car, only to stop to save a little girl who was being buffeted by the crowds. The death-defying star then went on to appear at the Palace Theatre.\n\nBuddy Holly\n\nA year before he died in one of the most infamous plane crashes in aeronautical history, Buddy Holly and The Crickets appeared at The Regal, in Hull, on March 19, 1958, during his only British tour.\n\nLouis Armstrong\n\nTrumpet man and jazz genius Louis \"Satchmo\" Armstrong received a rapturous response when he performed at Beverley Road Baths on October 12, 1933, with his Harlem Band as part of its tour across the UK.\n\nThe Hull Daily Mail correspondent of the time was even moved to say: \"Armstrong's wizardry with his trumpet delighted everyone and the dance was a decidedly successful innovation.\"\n\nGeorge Formby\n\nThe ukulele-strumming star did his bit for the war effort when he visited Hull on May 24, 1941, and announced he would be raising money for the Raid Distress Fund.\n\nThe Wigan-born actor, who had been turned down by the Army, also revealed that because of the wartime super tax he had received only £350 of the £14,000 he had earned so far that year, but he didn't mind as long as he was \"helping the country\".\n\nLaurel & Hardy\n\nIn 1947, the duo appeared at Hull New Theatre, visiting the nearby Old English Gentleman for a drink and staying at The Royal Hotel.\n\nHull was also to be Laurel and Hardy's last sight of Britain. On June 3, 1954, as recorded in a letter from Stan Laurel to his friend Betty Healy, the duo sailed back from Hull to the US on a Danish cargo ship, after what was to prove their final tour of the UK.\n\nRadiohead\n\nThe band visited Hull’s Adelphi twice in the early 1990s, and performed their hit single Creep at the club in 1992.\n\nYears later, the band admitted it was the only time they had performed in a terraced house, and the group spent the night at the Campanile where they were kept awake by a room full of Chippendales next door.\n\nOasis\n\nNoel, Liam, Bonehead, Guigsy and the other one performed at that breeding ground for future megastars, Hull's New Adelphi, in April 1994, a day before the release of their first single Supersonic and debut album Definitely Maybe.\n\nA little more than a year later, the Mancunians had gone all champagne supernova and were headlining Glastonbury.\n\nMumford & Sons\n\nIn 2009, the band who brought farmer-chic to the fore of pop music performed an intimate gig at Hull’s Adelphi in De Grey Street, and even posed for a mandatory picture in the club's famous toilets.\n\nThe band performed their brand new album at the time, Sigh No More, on September 22, giving fans the opportunity to buy one of just 1,000 copies of a limited edition version of the album.\n\nGreen Day\n\nAnother string to Adelphi’s bow was a performance from punk rockers Green Day on December 20, 1991. They slept in the upstairs of the venue, with crowds packing out the small venue after the band’s sell-out US tour.\n\nTake That\n\nLong before Robbie split, Jason quit and Gary became the good looking one, a young Take That were busy building a fan base by performing at schools up and down the country.\n\nOn January 27, 1992, the fledgling boy band appeared at two Hull schools, Malet Lambert and Kingston High, alongside a gig at Lexington Avenue, in Ferensway. That summer, the group had their first top 10 hit with It Only Takes A Minute.\n\nThe Stone Roses\n\nThe band performed at Adelphi in 1987, just before they exploded on to the music scene. According to reports, the played to about 10 people, and Ian Brown was “going bonkers, running up and down the tables”."
