        "text": "Does your hometown have heroes/celebrities? These can be people born in or who moved to your hometown and are recognized as been famous locally, nationally or internationally. You can be as brief or detailed as you want.\n\nI'll give us five to start off with from my hometown of Hull, England. I may add more later.\n\n---\n\n1. William Wilberforce: Arguably one of Hull's most recognized celebrities. William was born in 1759 and became both a Politician and and Evangelical Christian. Some of the accomplishments in his life included encouraging Christian Missionaries to go to India and being one of the founders of the RSPCA. However, he is most well known for been one of the leaders of a campaign to end the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and give freedom to all slaves in the British Empire.\n\nThe campaign eventually succeeded on both fronts - with the Slave Trade been abolished in 1807 and Bill for the Abolition of Slavery (which covered most of the British Empire with the exception of territories belonging to the East India Company) passing in 1833.\n\nSadly, just days after been told the bill had succeeded, William Wilberforce passed away after a severe case of influenza which he sadly never recovered from.\n\nWilliam was buried in Westminster Abbey, while the exceptions in the Slavery Abolition Bill would be eliminated in 1843. Today, William's house has been converted into a Museum detailing his life and anti-slavery work, has had several buildings named after him including Wilberforce College in Hull and Wilberforce University in Ohio, is commemorated in various Churches within the Anglican Communion and has a monument of him standing in the grounds of Hull College.\n\nA film about William Wilberforce was made in 2006 called Amazing Grace (named after the famous hymn that was written by former slaver turned abolitionist John Newton). However, the film is not historically accurate.\n\n2. Amy Johnson\n\nAmy was an English Aviator born in 1903 who later became famous for been the first female aviator to fly solo from Great Britain to Australia - accomplishing the 18,000km trip in her de Havilland DH.60 (Gypsy Moth) biplane \"Jason\" in 19.5 days. Her success earned her a CBE and the Harmon Trophy. She also earned the No. 1 civil pilot's licence under Australia's 1921 Air Navigation Regulations.\n\nShe later completed several other record flights, both with other pilots and solo, as well as getting married to Scottish pilot Jim Mollison after he proposed to her 8 hours after meeting her!\n\nTheir marriage lasted for 6 years before the pair got divorced. When WW2 broke out in 1939, Amy joined the Air Transport Auxiliary - transporting aircraft from factories to Royal Air Force bases.\n\nSadly, Amy lost her life in 1941 at age 37 after her plane crashed into the River Thames. Her body was never recovered and the details surrounding her death remain a mystery to this day - with some saying she ran out of fuel and others believing that she was accidentally shot down.\n\nToday, a statue of her stands in Hull while several buildings and roads have been named after her across the UK. As part of the City of Culture in Hull, several \"Moths\" have been placed around the city whilst inmates at Hull Prison created a replica of \"Jason\" - which is now hanging from the ceiling in Hull's Paragon Interchange.\n\n3. Captain Henry Lewis Hulbert\n\nA lesser known man from Hull but no less important. Henry Hulbert was born in Hull in 1867 and began a promising Diplomatic career in Malaya. However, this came to an end after a scandalous divorce - with Henry emigrating to America and joining the US Marines.\n\nHere, he would take part in the America-Samoa war in 1889 and was awarded the Medal of Honor after defending a wounded soldier in a rearguard action.\n\nWhen America joined the First World War in 1917, Henry (despite been too old for active duty as he was 50 years old) joined the American Expeditionary Force in France and performed at least three acts of heroism during his short service in the country.\n\nOne of the most notable of these heroic acts involved Hulbert - who was armed only with a rifle - single-handedly attacking German machine-gun positions and, as the citation read, \"left seven of the enemy dead and put the remainder to flight.\" The second citation commended him for continuing to lead his platoon in attacks that routed the defenders of a series of strong points despite being painfully wounded himself.\n\nAfter his third act of heroism, Hulbert became one of the first US Marines to be decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross. Sadly, Hulbert was killed by a German Machine Gunner during a battle at Mont Blanc Ridge in October 1918. He had been approved the title of Captain before his death and was posthumously awarded both the Navy Cross and the French Croix de Guerre Order of the Army. He was later buried with honors in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nFollowing his death, the US Navy Destroyer USS Hulbert was named in 1919 in his honor, serving in the navy until its decommission in 1945, while to this day the Americans award the Hulbert Trophy for outstanding leadership.\n\n4. Clive Sullivan\n\nBorn in the village of Splott in Cardiff, Wales in 1943, Clive Sullivan required operations on his knees, feet and shoulders, making his illustrious rugby league career seem all the more exceptional.\n\nLike many Hull stars before him, Sully joined the British Army, and was posted to Catterick where he played for the Army’s rugby team. He had an unsuccessful trial with Bradford and was then offered a trial at Hull where he scored three tries and signed as a professional the following day.\n\nConstrained by army duties, even more operations and an almost fatal car crash Clive’s first three years at Hull FC were restricted, but the club were certainly intrigued about Sullivan’s capabilities and gave him a chance to play rugby league. Wearing the number two jersey the winger boasted phenomenal speed, and from his debut onwards was a cult hero.\n\nUpon leaving the army Clive put his name among Hull FC’s rich history, scoring a try in the 12-9 Yorkshire Cup Final win over Featherstone. From his Great Britain debut in 1967 Sully’s international career took him to new found heights. He scored a hat-trick against New Zealand in his first World Cup and became captain in 1972. It was then where Clive Sullivan’s name really entered the history books as the last Great Britain World Cup winning captain. He scored a try in all four games, most famously a spectacular length of the field effort in the final against Australia.\n\nClive then moved to Hull FC’s fiercest of enemies Hull Kingston Rovers in 1974. Very few sporting rivalries can match that of the two Hull clubs, especially in rugby league. When Sullivan played for Hull FC he was in his prime, he was lauded as a god. Anyone with the slightest grasp of the intensity of the rivalry between the two teams could well have predicted him to become a figure of absolute hate – but that was not so.\n\nClive was idolized. He managed a respectable total of 118 tries in 213 games for Hull KR, most famously defeating his old employers 10-5 in the 1980 Challenge Cup final at Wembley – for arguably the most famous and well-known final in the history of the competition.\n\nAfter leaving Rovers – amid a brief spell at Oldham – Sullivan was unexpectedly called back into the Hull FC team in 1982 after a period on the coaching staff. At the age of 39 he played in one of the most famous nights in Hull FC’s history as the club defeated Widnes 18-9 in a Challenge Cup Final replay at Elland Road.\n\nClive went on to play for Hull FC until April 1985, tragically dying of liver cancer just six months later. He was aged just 42.\n\nToday Clive’s place in Kingston upon Hull folklore is pretty much unbeatable. Since 2001 the Clive Sullivan Memorial Trophy has been awarded to the winner of the annual pre-season ‘friendly’ between the two Hull clubs. To this day, Clive still holds two Hull FC records to his name. He is the clubs all-time top try scorer with 250, and holds the record for the most tries in an individual match with 7.\n\nBesides that Clive is the only player to have ever scored 100+ tries, and win a Challenge Cup winners medal with each Hull club. Finally, one of Hull's streets was named \"Clive Sullivan Way\" in memory of him\n\n5. Mick Ronson\n\nMichael \"Mick\" Ronson was an English guitarist, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, arranger, and producer. He achieved critical and commercial success while working with David Bowie as the lead guitarist and band leader for Bowie's backing band, the Spiders From Mars. Ronson was also a session musician who recorded and performed with singers Morrissey, Van Morrison and Bob Dylan.\n\nAfter Bowie disbanded the Spiders, Ronson recorded several solo albums, including \"Slaughter on 10th Avenue\" and \"Heaven To Hull\". He played with various bands, but found greater success as a producer and arranger for such acts as John Mellancamp, Ian Hunter, Morrissey and the Leather Nun. He was named one of the greatest guitarists of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, 64th in 2003 and 41st in 2012, but many consider him woefully underrated in that regard.\n\nRonson was married to Suzie Fussey, who was the hairstylist for Bowie during his Ziggy Stardust heyday. Together, they had a daughter, Lisa.\n\nIn 1993, Ronson died of liver cancer. He is a beloved son of Hull and in his honor, a memorial stage bearing his name was erected in Queen's Garden, Hull."
