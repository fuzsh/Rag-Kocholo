        "text": "It was quite by chance that Phillip Goodhand-Tait became a songwriter. His rather good, horn-led 60s r’n’b band, The Stormsville Shakers, had struggled to get a record deal at home but, while playing some French gigs they recorded an EP for EMI offshoot, Odeon. Back home the soon-to-be-legendary Dick James, who’d just signed a young Reg Dwight, was on the scene.\n\n“One of our managers was trying to get his wife signed to a publishing contract with Dick and the negotiations were going reasonably well,” he says. “But Dick wanted something more so the manager said, ‘Well, Phillip Goodhand-Tait wrote these songs which were released in France,’ and Dick, who pretty well signed anything, signed me to a five-year songwriting contract. I thought all I had to do was wait for stardust.”\n\nBut James had his other signing and, as a piano-playing singing-songwriter, he was already in the shadow of the aspirant superstar who became Elton John. “So, I saw a Melody Maker ad – ‘Hit group wants hit songs’ – and sent tapes. I was up a ladder painting my manager’s flat. Love Affair’s Everlasting Love was played to death on Radio Caroline and a flatmate said, ‘Your song’s the B-side’. It was Gone Are The Songs Of Yesterday, and a B-side meant as much as an A-, so I rang Dick and said, ‘Am I going to make money?’ and he sent me £250 on account. On a good week I earned £5 and honestly felt I’d never need to work again.” And that was without the £2,000 arriving six months later.\n\nGoodhand-Tait juggled life as performer and enabler. The Stormsville Shakers had played the Ricky-Tick clubs in Windsor and their home town of Guildford and were recommended to back US rock’n’roller Larry (Bony Moronie) Williams. “We toured and he was great company, as was Johnny Guitar Watson, his big mate,” he recalls. “He was our great hope and we made two albums with him.”\n\nOne was 1965’s Larry Williams On Stage! “But it was done in the studio,” he points out. “Screaming Lord Sutch provided a bunch of people who contrived to be an audience and he and Screamin’ Jay Hawkins made a lot of noise.” But the band weren’t credited and Williams returned to the States without the Shakers getting a song they could make big: “By that stage he couldn’t write a hit song for himself let alone write one for me.”\n\nThe next disappointment was Long Live Love, written by friend Chris Andrews. “It was a bit poppy but whenever we played it went down a storm,” he says. “Chris made a demo with us, took it to his manager and said, ‘This could be a hit.’ She agreed – and gave it to Sandie Shaw.”\n\nIn 1965 Shaw made it her second No 1. “We lost out but I learned valuable lessons about songwriting,” Goodhand-Tait says. “Then began my real songwriting career.”\n\nHaving written a Love Affair B-side he was determined to write an A side. “That was A Day Without Love,” he notes. “From then I was a professional songwriter not a performing artist.”\n\nCue further disappointment: singer Steve Ellis quit and the band collapsed. “And getting covered was difficult because the fashion was for artists to write their own songs,” he explains. “Then Dick started a record company and very shrewdly signed songwriters who could sing on their own demo discs, which was Reg Dwight and me.”\n\nGoodhand-Tait, by default, was a singer-songwriter. His four albums for DJM Records have just been compiled in a Cherry Red Records box. “Playing was the only way I could get my songs heard,” he says. “On the first, Rehearsal [1970], I wasn’t even competent at playing and singing at the same time.” The records featured top musicians. The second, I Think I’ll Write A Song [1971], used a Guildford band. “Andy Latimer, the guitarist, was particularly good.” Then they formed Camel with Pete Bardens. “For the third, Songfall [1972], I went almost acoustic, invited Elton’s guitarist Davey Johnstone and drummer Roger Pope; Rick Wakeman, even. My version of Everyday became a turntable hit: Noel Edmonds played it to death on his Sunday show.” Little chart action, though. “Elton is a far better salesman than I am!” he says.\n\nArtists, however, still used his songs. Roger Daltrey recorded the impressive Oceans Away on Ride A Rock Horse [1975] and Parade and Leon on 1977’s One Of The Boys while Gene Pitney also recorded Oceans Away on Pitney ’75. No One But You was a 1970 Zoot Money single, produced by Alan Price. After his DJM contracts expired he moved to Chrysalis, making two albums before his style was kicked in the teeth by punk. “I was pretty much finished, things were desperate.\n\nI stopped getting royalties and assumed I was so out of favour that my songs weren’t being played anywhere – 10 years later it turned out that the PRS had lost my bank details and I got a cheque for tens of thousands!”\n\nBy then he had moved into film. He became chief executive of video company VCL, which eventually became Virgin Video. In 1983 he linked up with the Trilion production company to form Trilion Pictures, recording concerts for no more than some acts spent on a promo video and then licencing them around the world. It was a million-pound-plus business until the market demanded bigger names, cheaper.\n\nHe formed SpanTV, which also struggled. “The 80s ended me owning a defunct company,” he says – but he had made concert films of many names, from Magnum to Kid Creole, Uriah Heep to Cockney Rebel, and managed to keep the copyright to a vast catalogue.\n\nHe vanished for four years, creating children’s character Green Ted and writing 46 monthly stories for AmericaOnline. But by the turn of the century he was back doing small gigs, with no manager, although a reformed Stormsville Shakers did release an impressive Ricky-Tick … 40 Years On in 2005. And 2008’s The Last Laugh was a fine album in laid-back Shakers style, with his own take on Bringing On Back The Good Times. Both were on his own Span TV label.\n\nEven though the new collection promises to bring on back the good times, he has sold his keyboards and retired… “unequivocally!” he says, laughing. “My final appearance was in 2014 at the Olympia in Paris. One song I’d played with the band that became Camel, Silverwing, was played nightly on French radio, a turntable hit. I felt a great synergy ending my performing career back where it had started. It was a good way to finish.”\n\nInterview: Nick Dalton\n\nGone Are The Songs Of Yesterday, featuring Phillip Goodhand-Tait’s first four solo albums, is on Lemon/Cherry Red."
