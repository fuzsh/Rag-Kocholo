        "text": "One Man & his Bog\n\nPublished in October 2004 to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of The New Adelphi Club.\n\nLimited Edition of 2000 copies. 180 pages including 2 free CDs 39 songs.\n\nNovember 28th 1998, Humberside Ice Arena, Hull. We missed the support band through hanging around in the bar and just managed to make the arena before the main act: Pulp, live at one of the most acoustically barren music venues in the country. The lights go down, tension builds and the crowd erupts as Jarvis Cocker materialises, microphone in hand, tall and majestic on the precipice of the stage.\n\n“Does anyone know Paul Jackson?” he asks.\n\nThe crowd goes berserk, 15 year old girls wailing like banshees.\n\n“How’s Yosser?”\n\nA similar response.\n\n“There was a time when only Hull and Sheffield would give us a gig,” proclaims the tall, charismatic frontman, with humility in his voice. And the band launch into the first song.\n\nStrange to think that, of the 2600 people screaming at this introduction, only a few would actually know what Jarvis was on about. Only a few would know who Paul Jackson, or Yosser was. Or just where in Hull it was that Pulp could always get a gig when no one else, apart from a couple of venues in their home town, would give them one.\n\nThe place was called The Adelphi Club. Paul Jackson was, and still is, the owner. Yosser was Paul’s dog, (but sadly is now no longer with us). During their rise to fame, from Red Rhino and Fire Records to the world-famous Island record label, Pulp performed at the Adelphi on many occasions. They spent some of their most formative years, from 1985 onwards, playing at this small venue, learning their trade. They had become good friends with Paul Jackson and his dog over the years. And now they were famous – but they hadn’t forgotten the importance of their roots.\n\nThe next night we told Paul Jackson about the gig and what had been said. He’d been too busy at his own club the night before to attend himself. He just smiled and said: ‘Well, they were welcome to pop in for a pint. They always know where we are’.\n\nThe Adelphi Club has been open for twenty years now. This is the story of those years: of Paul Jackson and Yosser, his dog; of the bands and performers, local, national and international, who have played at the venue; and of the people who have frequented and supported the club over the years. It’s also about proposed government legislation, in the form of Public Entertainment Licencing (The PEL), and the threat that it poses to grass roots venues and the cultural values they represent. Finally, it’s an argument for why venues such as the Adelphi should be exempted by the local council from the excesses of such legislation and left to continue the unrecognised public and cultural service they provide at both a local and national and, indeed, international level. But, firstly, it begins with a place.\n\nThe New Adelphi club in Hull was originally a three bedroom terraced house, complete with garden, built in 1888 as part of the city’s progressive northward expansion. Located at 89 De Grey Street, which runs between Beverley Road, a main arterial route into the city, and Newland Avenue, a busy shopping thoroughfare, it was, and still is, essentially a down-at-heel residential area with a smattering of retail outlets and small industrial workshops and warehouses. To the rear of the club lies a railway embankment, once the main goods line between Hull and Barnsley, which runs parallel with De Grey Street itself, and is still used for freight to this day.\n\nThe layout of the club consisted of two downstairs rooms, one a front taproom located to the immediate left of the main front entrance, the second a larger concert room at the rear, with a maximum capacity of about 220. The bar was located between front and back rooms, the serving hatch to the front room providing panoramic views of the concert hall. Toilets were to the rear of the building and could only be used by walking through the concert room. The upstairs of the building, accessed through a private door just inside the main entrance, provided living quarters for the club’s subsequent owners.\n\nWhat happened before it became one of the UK’s celebrated underground music venues…\n\n1888 – 89 De Grey Street built (residential household).\n\n1923 – Liquor licence granted – The Victory Club and Institute.\n\n1933 – Imaginatively re-named De Grey Club. New owner: Harold Percy.\n\n1940 – Car park created for De Grey Club (courtesy of the Luftwaffe, who facilitated the abrupt removal of neighbours 83, 85 and 87).\n\n1956 – Becomes the Civil Service Sports and Social Club (sports facilities include: pool, darts, dominoes and five-a-side football – pot-holes and bomb craters permitting).\n\n1965-70 – Typical of the decade, no one can remember.\n\nc.1970 – Becomes an Industrial Laundry (the club starts to clean up its act).\n\n1978 – Re-opens as a drinking establishment with the title, The Adelphi Club.\n\nNew owners: Robert and Trudey Marshall Tomlinson (supposed membership 800 (!), with plans for a wine bar upstairs (!!)).\n\nEarly 1980s – Re-named The New Adelphi Club. New owner: Bruce Bramley. New manager Brian Portman, assisted by Julie.\n\n1st October 1984 – The New Adelphi Club. New owner: Paul Jackson\n\n“Oh, and by the by, there would never be an Adelphi had the Germans not aimed so miserably” (Schneider TM, German band)\n\nMeet Jacko (Paul Jackson)\n\nBorn: in 1954 at the Townsend Maternity Hospital, Cottingham Road.\n\nGrew up: in the villages of Swanland, North Ferriby and Cottingham.\n\nInterests: sports (football, cricket, tennis, high jump, rugby), fishing.\n\nSchools: Swanland Primary School/Cottingham High School.\n\nWork experience: shipping clerk, Fenners Ltd (13 years).\n\nMusical background: church chorister, played guitar and piano.\n\nEarly musical influences: classical music and Elvis (but not the films).\n\nLater musical influences: evolving and eclectic musical tastes, from 1960s and 1970s underground rock and psychedelia, Krautrock, avant garde, through to Indies, World and original, independently produced quality music – especially music that bears repeated listening over time.\n\nMusical interests: buying records (1000s) and attending gigs (1000s).\n\nBuying the Adelphi\n\nPaul left his local high school and worked in the busy shipping office of Fenners, a local industrial company, where he settled into the mundane existence of a nine-to five job. After nearly thirteen years in this, he felt ripe for a change.\n\nIt was natural then that when he felt the need for a change in direction it was to music that he turned. But had this been a secret, lifelong ambition of his? To be involved in running a venue and promoting live music? The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is no. It was simply that it seemed the right thing to do at the time. So perhaps then it was motivated by the spirit of Thatcherism, of free enterprise and the entrepreneurial ethos dominant in the 1980s? Again the answer, less surprisingly, is no. Indeed, the aims and ambitions of Paul Jackson were in many ways the exact antithesis of Thatcherite ideology, a reaction against those very principles. The were no grand schemes for corporate expansion, no expectations of making big money on the back of others. This was about creating and maintaining the very kind of communities that Thatcherism sought to destroy. The intention was to set up a venue where original music could be played and heard. There was no dedicated venue like this in the city and Paul felt that such a club could provide a service to both local musicians and music fans alike. He wanted it to have a positive impact on peoples’ lives, one which served a unique social and cultural purpose. It was based very much on a ‘see how it goes’ philosophy. He had no great expectations beyond surviving past the next few months, let alone keep going for twenty years.\n\nPaul Jackson’s aims and ambitions were quite simple then: to be involved in promoting diverse and original music; to make a bit of a living; and to survive.\n\nInitially, Paul had two potential partners: Vince Lee and Frank Moffat. After viewing several venues, including both New York Hotel on Anlaby Road and the Wellington Club on Beverley Road, Paul decided to go it alone and settled on the much smaller Adelphi club instead. When asked whether the choice had been dictated by its location relative to Hull University and the Colleges of Higher Education, or by the cultural diversity of the surrounding population, the answer was more straightforward than that: the Adelphi was the cheapest club on the market at the time. Perhaps more importantly though, after a few visits the place felt right.\n\nNevertheless, it would soon become apparent that the right choice had been made, whether by design or default. In retrospect, it seems clear now that the type of club he had in mind could only have succeeded in its De Grey Street location; that a similar club elsewhere in the city would have inevitably failed. This can be attributed directly to the diversity of the local population, with its high proportion and turnover of students, many of whom, along with enthusiastic locals, would get involved with the club, either as performer, punter or, as was often the case, as both.\n\nAn added attraction to Paul was the living accommodation above the club. This allowed him, in his own words, ‘to wander downstairs, have a beer and watch a band’. It also saved money, insofar as living expenses were concerned. This factor was important because he knew he would have to live on a tight budget for the foreseeable future. Paul initially planned to run the club while continuing to work at Fenners (his salary was then about £140 per week) – but this juggling act subsequently proved to be impossible. Rumours had it that Paul had received redundancy money from Fenners and that this had allowed him to finance the purchase. But this was simply not the case.\n\nThe freehold to the Adelphi cost £57,000. To someone of limited financial means this represented a tremendous amount of money. After re-mortgaging a small house in Cottingham, he was still left with a shortfall of £45,000, which he managed to somehow borrow from the Whitbread brewery, this despite him never having even worked behind a bar, let alone manage a nightclub. This was perhaps a fitting testimony to the enthusiasm and drive he possessed at the time. He obtained his licence to serve intoxicating liquor soon after this and so the stage was set for the club’s grand opening.\n\nQUOTES\n\n“He was always good at sport, starting with British Bulldog, the sack race, and eventually becoming the egg & spoon champion.” (Joan Jackson, Paul’s mother)\n\n“He was brought up on Elvis, and also learned to play piano, delighting family gatherings with his enthusiastic renditions of Elvis’ ‘Blue Suede Shoes’. (Joan Jackson, Paul’s mother)\n\n“When he told me he was going to give the job up I was quite surprised but wanted him to do what he was happy doing – the first place he mentioned was the New York Hotel and I was agog. He eventually settled on the Adelphi.” (Joan Jackson, Paul’s mother)\n\nOVERVIEW (OCTOBER 1984 – 1986)\n\nGRAND OPENING\n\n“I started at the Adelphi in October 1984. I inherited a run-down working-mens’ club, with a gay night – which meant that working men wouldn’t come near the place! Our regular ‘punters’ consisted of the local gangster fraternity. I felt that virtually all the drugs off Hull docks must have been coming through the club, and that we must have been supplying all of Glasgow if not all of Scotland… There was a constant stream of mean, grizzled, Scottish ex-cons, in big flashy cars – one of which, I recall, was used in an attempt to decapitate someone who had previously been knocked senseless in the car park. As far as my future was concerned, it was hardly what I had in mind! The gay night soon folded after in-fighting began, and, not being gay myself, I felt unable to mediate. So, it was a music venue I wanted and got. The first bands to play here were Vagrant and Cold Dance. After that more bands came – and the regulars went elsewhere. Inside, music replaced the sound of bottles whistling past your ears, whilst outside the street fights and burglaries diminished. The young of Hull rapidly adopted the Adelphi as theirs. The Housemartins were one of the first names to play here, and early out-of-town bands included Pulp and The Shamen. Students also started to attend. The Adelphi was one of only a handful of venues that actually welcomed them.” (Paul Jackson)\n\n“I couldn’t believe what I found. An end of terrace typical Victorian house with a sign attached to it. Was this a joke? Jacko answered the door like one of those characters from the old Hammer House of Horror productions. The only difference was that he was wearing fluffy slippers. And so in I went. I was even more shocked by the inside than I was with the outside. It seemed to be no more than a living room knocked through to the lounge with a small stage at the far end. Where there should have been a kitchen, there was a bar. Where there should have been a porch there was a pool table. Surreal in the extreme. What made it all even more of a mind-blowing experience was the decor. Seventies kitsch meets art-deco. Peters and Lee meets Salvador Dali. Gold Lame on Pebble-dash walls, red velvet curtains to the stage with grotty rope-style tie-backs. And a bingo machine in the middle! I kid you not. A bingo machine!” (Nick Taylor, The Unity Club)\n\n“Our first visit there must have been shortly after Paul Jackson took over. I certainly remember the original dodgy decor. Weren’t there little darts trophies scattered around? Not to mention the old Viking hat… “ (Ted Alkins)\n\n“I started working a few shifts behind the bar in 1984 just a few weeks after Paul took over. There was Gay Night (men dressed as Shirley Bassey, singing Shirley Bassey songs), and Jason, (who had a huge snake as part of his act), Rockabilly Night (people in their twenties dressed like Happy Days characters doing amazing dances) and an increasing trickle of young new bands giving enthusiastic but generally unpolished performances. I was hooked. There were a few older regulars from the social club days of the Adelphi who carried on being a fixture for a few years, occasionally commenting on the (questionable) musical ability of the new talent. After a while I became full time bar manager, doing five nights and five afternoons a week. Lunchtimes were generally fairly quiet, with a dozen or so people having a couple of pints and everyone having a go at the record deck, playing the songs they wanted to hear. Sunday afternoons were generally busier with the Savannah Street Stompers and The Velvetones playing alternate weeks. Evenings were usually busy, with three bands playing most nights and Musicians Night on Mondays. At one point I even had a brief venture providing sandwiches.” (Sharon Clay, bar staff)\n\nThe sandwiches were known as ‘Sharon’s toasties’ and are fondly remembered by Paul Jackson to this day.\n\nCLIENTELE\n\nHere’s a bit more about some of the early clientele, neighbours and bar staff:\n\n“Mad Dennis fended off the great and the good to propel 20 or 30 empty pint glasses at Jacko, who, leg in plaster, did his best Roscoe Tanner impression as he hit shards of broken glass back at him. Or the night Irish Ritchie, completely upside down in the pool-room, one arm flailing at his attacker, the other vainly searching for his pint on the side of the pool table. Or Biffa serving on New Year’s Eve with his shirt in tatters and covered in blood as someone attempts to pull him over the bar for a quiet word. Or it’s Gary pissing in the pool table pockets.” (Chris Elliott, ex-Gargoyles)\n\n“Who can forget Midge the Cellarman (who looked like a character from Captain Pugwash), Steve ‘Biffa’ Gittens, Dave Wrack and Sam Pink Noise…” (Nick Taylor, The Unity Club)\n\n“It had its characters; some very frightening individuals, some incomprehensible ones: Paddy the glass collector, Ernie and George from next door (what can they have thought as, say, F.U.B.B. cranked it up at 9pm on a Thursday night?) and Dave Wrack.” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\nAfter a while, the Adelphi clientele became a strange eclectic mix of old and new:\n\n“People of extreme violence would share the bar with people of extreme peace.” (Eddie Smith, ex-Gargoyles)\n\nEventually those people of extreme violence left, leaving the rest of us. Those people of extreme peace are the people who have been going to the Adelphi for the last twenty years.\n\nEXISTING ACTIVITIES\n\nSome of the pre-existing activities at the club remained for a time. The bingo was definitely out from the start. The dominoes team was knocking shortly after. The darts and pool teams carried on for a while. Paul developed his catering skills accordingly:\n\n“Sandwiches for the visiting pool teams that might just kill.” (Chris Elliott, ex-Gargoyles)\n\nAfter a couple of seasons though it was all over for good – Paul could no longer be arsed to make his killer sandwiches. People still carried on playing pool for fun (there were two tables, one in the front and one in the main room) and the dartboards remained in place for several years, though nobody really played anymore.\n\nALTERNATIVE CABARET\n\nThe Sunday gay night, the Alternative Cabaret, continued for over a year after Paul took over. The assorted comedians, drag acts, male strippers and circus shows were provided by P.J.A.M. Promotions from Keighley in West Yorkshire. Here are some choice observations:\n\n“I remember regularly being a barman on the Sunday Gay nights which provided me with some of the wildest club nights I’ve ever experienced. That really was like the wild west and I remember us having to double as security staff when frequent cat fights broke out! Believe me, you wouldn’t have wanted to be involved in a love-triangle with any of the Adelphi gay crowd. The entertainment on those nights only added to the highly charged atmosphere. Outrageous drag acts, freaky circus shows and sexual magicians whipped the audience into regular frenzies.” (Nick Taylor, The Unity Club)\n\n“Jason’s Horror Show sent 50 grown men to bed weeping, having been chased into the car park by a 20ft python.” (Chris Elliott, ex-Gargoyles)\n\n“Loud music burst forth and onto the stage erupted – a nun! A nun who pranced round the stage, turned his back on the audience and lifted his habit over his head to show stockings, suspenders and frilly panties. A little while and much prancing later he began a tour of the tables. By this time the habit had been cast aside as had some of the underwear. Did he really dip a certain part of his anatomy into peoples’ beers? Or was it more pretence? We didn’t wait to find out.” (Nell Hirst)\n\n“‘Twas a cold dark night, in autumn 1985. The performer, Batman, a spindly youth, theatrically removed his bat-gear to eventually reveal his bat-organ, which was too big to be true – or too good to be true (for the gay lobby). In fact, it wasn’t true, as was revealed when it was snatched off by a punter while Bat-fink was dipping it into a pint of Strongbow. Several minutes of confusion followed. Cue Paul Jackson, stage centre, mike in hand, looking over his glasses, with serious PJ voice: ‘Batman’s willy has been stolen. Batman needs this for his livelihood. I shall turn down the house lights. If, when I turn them back up, I see Batman’s Willy before me, no more will be said about the matter’.” (Dave Rotheray, ex-Velvetones/Beautiful South)\n\n“I was told I could go any night but Sunday” (Joan Jackson, Paul’s mother)\n\nThe eventual demise of the Alternative Cabaret was due to in-fighting between the various factions that made up the Adelphi gay community, as well as the emergent issues associated with AIDS and the negative spotlight it placed on the gay community as a whole at that time.\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe first major change in the club involved the provision of music. There was still some of the stuff that had gone on before:\n\n“It was still a great place to catch celebrities like Eddie Twang, one of the finest musicians that graced any stage. With his thin legs, thin face, thin quiff and huge hearing aid, he would offer knockabout Rockabilly true to the spirit of rock ‘n’ roll. A curious combination between Eddie Cochrane and George Formby, he was dressed in full teddy boy regalia. On stage he would laugh and joke between numbers and, when dancing, he would kick his legs about wildly. I remember once his shoe flew off into the audience, people offered to return it, but he couldn’t hear them because I think his hearing aid was switched off.” (Ann Maguire)\n\nBut the Saturday night resident covers band was dropped and immediately replaced by bands who played their own original music, bands like Vagrant, Cold Dance, The Housemartins, Victims of War, Born Idol and Burgess and McLean. The equipment was basic and so was the audience:\n\n“I can’t remember that much about the gig. I was introduced to Paul Jackson by Nick Swift, a month or so earlier, at the Trades & Labour Club. We (Vagrant) supported the Membranes, and Jacko was suitably impressed to ask us to play his venue. I think Les Zeiga Fleurs were supposed to play on the night with us. Anyway the gig was ok. We only had 40 minutes worth of our own ropey punk rock originals, plus a Clash cover, and Johnny Thunder’s ‘Chinese Rocks’. The club was even grottier then, than ever. The regulars at the time were made up of the local gay community, a few curious music fans, some of our mates, and a friendly Irish family. I can’t remember Yosser being there though (or getting paid!).” (Guy Gibson, ex-Vagrant)\n\n“First played the Adelphi in 1984 with a crappy punk band of my mates called Born Idol (helping out on guitar as the guitarist they had couldn’t really play!). The PA system was a small ramshackle affair, the amplifier housed on top of a small rickety table. Back wall of the stage area was covered with that awful 70’s beaten copper effect wall-covering, particularly popular with fire surrounds!… I think Jacko did the sound.” (Tony Peaks, ex-Kicks/New Day Rising/Suffocation)\n\n“I remember doing an early gig supported by Thin Ice. The Adelphi didn’t have a proper PA in them days (let alone a soundman), so we used Cold Dance’s PA at last the minute. Everybody mucked in with no rivalry between bands. I also remember the famous gold wall paper on the stage backed up by the clapped out piano which took up most of the space on stage!” (Sean Bryant, ex-Victims of War)\n\n“The PA was basically two disco speakers nailed to the wall” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\nThis change in musical orientation was the first tentative step towards Paul’s longer term ambitions for the club: to become a 7-days-a-week dedicated music venue. Gradually the equipment was improved and upgraded and more and more bands started to play at the club. Paul soon linked up with Nick Taylor and Nick Swift of the The Unity Club, and together they brought out-of-town bands to the club. Nick Taylor explains:\n\n“The idea of having a truly independent, autonomous, politically sound, friendly, underground, non-profit making (not intentionally!), creative venue in our own hands was a dream I had already aspired to. So the partnership between the Adelphi and The Unity Club was forged and we got down to the business of bringing up-and-coming bands/acts from all over the country (and later on the world) to the Adelphi. The first one we promoted was a band from Leicester called Yeah, Yeah, Noh. From that point onwards, it developed into more than just a ‘business’ arrangement… We were weeding out all of the up and coming talent in the nation and bringing them to Hull to play at the Adelphi, which because of this exposure, was fast gaining a reputation itself in the music world as one of the most important independent venues. We were ahead of the game. Finger on the pulse. Ear to the ground. All those sorts of clichés, but it was true. We were constantly recognising the next big thing. Some of the acts we found, early on in their careers, went on to absolutely massive. Examples of some of the names we brought to the Adelphi under the Unity banner were: Bogshed, The Godfathers, Manic Street Preachers, 3-Johns, The Housemartins (obviously), The Gargoyles, The Membranes, The Prisoners, The Soup Dragons, Attila the Stockbroker, Vee VV, Happy Mondays, The Farm, Pulp and many others. All went on to become household names or underground legends” (Nick Taylor, The Unity Club)\n\n“Many great bands first came to the Adelphi first through Swift Nick and The Unity Club. I would therefore acknowledge his role throughout the early days of the venue and thank him sincerely, along with cohorts such as Gary, Ian, Dodger, Biffer Bacon, etc. Cheers mates!” (Paul Jackson)\n\nAnd so. with the help of the two Nicks and The Unity Club, the Adelphi became part of the infamous Toilet Tour – one of a handful of venues around the country dedicated to presenting original live Indies music aimed specifically at younger people. This was the start of the Adelphi’s twenty year musical odyssey, one that has seen some of the greatest local, national and international acts grace its humble stage.\n\nTHE HOUSEMARTINS\n\nFirst played – 1984 Times played – c.6 Last played – 1985\n\nIn 1985 The Housemartins, who played the the club several times in these early days, landed a record contract with Go! Discs. They signed the contract on the Adelphi stage on the 20th June, 1985:\n\n“One of the most significant moments in my life was The Housemartins signing the record contract with Go! Discs on the Adelphi stage in June 1985. The Adelphi had been a very important part of building the band’s audience. The occasion of the signing was the culmination of many months of hard work, especially by Paul (Heaton) and Stan (Cullimore), but it was in recognition of the importance of the club for the band, and the support of Paul Jackson, that we decided to set up the event – and also it would be a bit of fun and something special for the fans. Let me tell you it wasn’t easy putting my name to a record contract whilst playing the drums – the point was to keep the song going while we all signed – but fortunately I had another arm and two legs to spare. For the record by the way, I think the song was ‘I’ll be your Shelter’ – not a Housemartins original, but a stage stalwart nevertheless. There are one or two supposedly ‘in the know’ people who allege that the Adelphi signing was entirely symbolic – a way of sharing the ‘promotion’ of one of Hull’s local music ‘teams’ with the punters – and that the REAL contract had been signed in London some days before; but I couldn’t possibly comment.” (Hugh Whittaker, ex-Gargoyles/Housemartins)\n\n“The Housemartins’ signing party – Sam and I had been to Paul Heaton’s house 10 days previously (at his request) and fixed it up. We got paid £56 for the gig as our share (Diary: ‘Big Time’- I can only hope that was an ironic comment, but it probably wasn’t!). They looked just boring and shit, and the rest of us consequently thought that we could easily do what they’d done. But we overlooked the fact that we couldn’t write songs as clever and catchy as that, and neither could we sing in four-part harmony. I was forced to revise my, until then, fairly dismissive attitude towards them when I watched them rehearse ‘Joy, Joy, Joy’ in the soundcheck. Then I got it.” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\n“I still remember the queues down De Grey Street when The Housemartins played, even though I think they got about right when they described themselves as ‘the fourth best band in Hull’!” (Pete Jack, Mambo Jambo)\n\n“The Housemartins are still the best band I’ve ever seen. My first ever gig at the Adelphi was one of their’s. It was a few months before ‘Happy Hour’ and I was a bit nervous about going to see this brilliant band at such a cool venue, thinking everyone would be aloof and full of themselves. I walked into the front bar and there was an old bloke sitting there with his dog and his shopping. I felt right at home after that.” (Katy Noone, ex-Coyote Trap)\n\n“I think the Housemartins were the 3rd band to play the Adelphi on the 3rd Saturday of our existence. Paul Heaton came to the club during the first fortnight to ask for a gig, and got one. I got the instant impression that this was someone who could make things happen, and that whatever he set his heart on, and wanted sufficiently, he would achieve with grace, intelligence & principle. He did!” (Paul Jackson)\n\nThe Housemartins went on to achieve massive success in the national charts. The rest, as they say, is history. They soon became too big to play the Adelphi, but always acknowledged the opportunities that the club gave them. However, Nick Clay recalls:\n\n“Paul Heaton and Ian Cullimore played with us and other bands at the Adelphi Xmas party on 19 December 1986. I have no recollection of seeing them play, but according to what I wrote in my diary I did. They were #1 in the charts when they played.” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\nFootnote: several of their fans came to Hull in order to be near their heroes and visit the Adelphi club. At least two of these Housemarteenies have been Adelphi regulars over the years. You know who you are!\n\nTHE GARGOYLES\n\nFirst played – 1985 Times played – c.20 Last played – 1988/2002\n\nAnother popular band who played early gigs was The Gargoyles, who performed at the Adelphi on a irregular basis over the next three years and who subsequently staged a couple of re-union gigs, to great popular acclaim, in 2002:\n\n“One of my happiest associations with the Adelphi was with a happy band of brothers they called The Gargoyles (originally Funforall) and I still remember our first gig at the club. In those days the backline was played as it was set up – the PA was only big enough to take the vocals so nothing else was miked-up. Fortunately, our frontman was Eddie ‘Mad Banana’ Smith so we never had any problem projecting our act onstage. I can still remember Eddie, while we were fiddling various knobs and making adjustments to drum stands, informing the audience that while they may have enjoyed this band or that, tonight they were going to be treated to ‘some proper bollocks’. Well, anyhow, we used to play with all the bollocks we could muster. And so was signalled the first of many Adelphi gigs by what would become one of its best-loved bands.” (Hugh Whittaker, ex-Gargoyles/Housemartins)\n\n“My first Gargoyles gig. What a spectacle. Ted, Paul (sadly missed) and the rest of the band dressed in over-sized Safari shorts with Eddie stood on top of the speakers with a ‘Frankie says Relax’ t-shirt on, winding his microphone lead around his body, while singing ‘Dead Men’s Boots’! …Fantastic!” (Dave Paine, journalist)\n\n“Gargoyles gigs were just the best. Always full, always good with an unpredictable edge. I was selling off Gargoyles merchandise at their last gig in 1988. It was at the Adelphi and very emotional. When all the stuff went I sold my own ‘Sod the Aquarium, I’m Gonna Live’ t-shirt to a bloke from London who was in tears because the band were breaking up.” (Katy Noone, ex-Coyote Trap)\n\n“My first experience of the Adelphi Club was to see a band called the Gargoyles. I was in my early thirties and walking in the entrance thought – this is not my scene! Four hours later I was hooked! I’m not sure how it happened but a short while later I was manager of the same band.” (Maggie Johnson, ex-manager, The Gargoyles)\n\n“Nothing really compares to seeing the Gargoyles. Their performances were unique. Eddie Smith was a schoolboy comedy genius. His stage prescence was outrageous. He would often scare and woo the crowd by chatting to them during the songs, leaving his band high and dry. Or by much more basic methods – like getting his knob out! The Gargoyles were the Adelphi for me. The first band I saw and still the best.” (Andy Dimmack, roadie, Super Furry Animals)\n\n“They were, quite simply, the must see Hull live band of the mid to late-80’s, one of the greatest live bands you could ever have seen. So how good were The Gargoyles? Well, how many bands could book a 600 cap London venue pretending to be The Housemartins (Hugh and Ted had just rejoined the band from The Housemartins), sell the place out, and get away without being lynched for their audacity? Sure, the unsuspecting audience went berserk. They demanded 4 encores and the band were immediately asked back – but as The Gargoyles next time. Unfortunately, the band never reached the same heights in the studio and the whole thing folded. But what fun we had! It is also important to acknowledge the role of The Velvetones, in that, at that time, there were 2 total one-off bands in Hull, both fronted by indescribably brilliant frontmen, Eddie Smith and Mike Montez of The Velvetones, They were also best mates from their schooldays and I can’t help but assume that this contributed to the parallel development of a uniquely natural humour and sense of showmanship – especially co-events like the ‘Battle of the Elvises’!” (Paul Jackson)\n\nTHE GARGOYLES RE-UNION\n\n“When we got back together for John Rowley’s 50th birthday, the rehearsals were so full of tales and adventures of old that we could hardly play for the laughter.” (Ted Key, ex-The Gargoyles/Housemartins)\n\n“A couple of years ago The Gargoyles performed their first re-union gig. On the night we turned up early, grabbed some seats near to the stage and waited in anticipation. I needn’t have worried. As soon as I saw Eddie bend down with his back to the audience and a dubious looking stain on his trousers I knew everything would be ok. From then on the night was fantastic, every song triggering off another memory. We ended up standing on our seats, dancing and singing along. Reeling with happiness. That was a perfect night and it’s sad it will never happen again but I will always remember it as the best night ever.” (Becky Wareing, ex-bar staff)\n\n“Eddie Smith at The Adelphi December 2002 (2nd re-union gig): ‘My first job was in Teals on Newland Ave. I used to walk around with a condom machine strapped to my front and a tampax machine to my back. I had to ask the customers “Can I help you…?”’ (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\n“The last Gargoyles gig was one of the most enjoyable live sets I have ever seen. The band were loving every minute of it and it clearly would not have mattered if they were playing to an empty room. As it was, however, the room was packed and the crowd were grinning from ear to ear throughout the set.” (Dr Ruth Graham)\n\nShortly after this last re-union gig, bass player with the band, brilliant artist and Adelphi regular, Paul Warhurst, was tragically killed in a road accident. He was a good friend to the club and we all miss him.\n\nPULP\n\nFirst played – 1985 Times played – 7 or 8 Last played – 1988\n\nPulp played at the Adelphi from 1985 onwards on a fairly regular basis and developed a close affinity with the club:\n\n“I think my Pulp debut was at the Adelphi club back in 1986. We played there 4/5 times in the late 80’s. Sometimes the place would be rammed and you’d think ‘come on’, but then next time it would be a dozen spotty indie kids or nutters who had wandered in off the street. On trips to Hull we always tried to set off a bit early and visit the seaside: Withernsea or Cleethorpes. It usually ended with Jarvis falling into the sea and stinking the van out. Once, after we had done our soundcheck we retired to the pub up the road. Instead of walking along the path I decided to jump over a small wall. I tripped, of course, and landed badly on my hand. My index finger really hurt. Several pints later it still hurt and if I stopped moving it, it would seize up. So, keep moving the finger everyone said. The show went ahead in true showbiz fashion. Yes, the finger still hurt. Next day, one Sheffield A&E X-Ray later, revealed a broken finger. Yes, it’s true the show must go on!” (Nick Banks, Pulp)\n\n“I have very good memories of the Hull Adelphi. It must’ve been around the mid to late eighties when we regularly played the Adelphi and our line up changed a few times in that period. In those days we used to basically play Sheffield, London, Bath, Bristol and Hull Adelphi and I found Paul to be the most friendly & generous of hosts. He had a lovely friendly & relaxed attitude & a lovely dog & he used to (originally) invite us up to his kitchen for tea and toast which was always highly appreciated. But sadly this all ended after some other group had abused his trust & I think stolen from him, or something. It was a sad day when our tea upstairs ended!” (Candida Doyle, Pulp)\n\n“One time Jarvis performed the entire set from a wheelchair, think he’d fallen out of a window or something. This just added to the strange spectacle that Pulp were in those days, ‘Little Girl with Blue Eyes’ (There’s a hole in your heart/ and one between your legs), ‘Dogs are Everywhere’, ‘Master of the Universe’, and the drummer’s Krusty the Clown ‘style’ hair.” (Jonny Dawe, ex-Death by Milkfloat)\n\n“Jarvis Cocker doing a gig in a wheel-chair mumbling: ‘…in case you’re wondering why I’m in a wheel-chair… it’s because I’m a cripple!’” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\n“Fond if somewhat hazy memories of Pulp – on one occasion with Jarvis more Davros than Robert Wyatt in his wheel-chair. And on another, or maybe even the same occasion, having all our numerous but cheap guitars stolen out of the ‘back stage’ corridor, only to be retrieved later after being spotted lying on the railway embankmemt at the rear, awaiting an aftershow pick up!” (Noel Kilbride, ex-AC Temple)\n\n“Pulp, an explosion of flares and bad hairstyles, once went back on to do an encore for me after I asked Jarvis for a fag… Silk Cut! Well, you can’t complain can you?” (Jon McArthur)\n\n“I saw Pulp several times early on. They were really avant-garde then, quite different from what they are now.” (Martin Deas)\n\n“As well as being an amazing band for a long time before they became popular, there was also a wicked sense of mischief that seemed to fit in nicely with the feel of the venue. A really great, and mixed, bunch of personalities too – with Jarvis, a star, and probably much the same today. Russell, very businesslike and even quite serious sometimes. Candida, quiet and inobtrusive by nature, but if she chose to speak everyone would shut up and listen. A guy called Manners, who was a right character, along with various others. Thanks for the memories and you were always great to work with.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nYOSSER\n\nA few weeks after taking over, Paul adopted Yosser, a Springer Spaniel, who became the Adelphi’s resident pub dog. Yosser was to become more famous than Paul and certainly sired more offspring than he did. Yosser developed a reputation in the area as a fighting, fucking, no-nonsense, ass-kicker with a particular penchant for female alsations and rottweilers.\n\n“Yosser had a lady friend you know! ‘Our Lass’. He picked her up in the street somewhere.” (Joan Jackson, Paul’s mother)\n\nWe don’t think Yosser was a particularly faithful beau though. He was a bit of a ten-timer. He strutted about the local area like he did about the club – as if he owned the place, which he did really:\n\n“Yosser, patrolled the pool-room making sure no one was sat in his seat and took a chunk out of your arse if you were.” (Chris Elliott, ex-Gargoyles)\n\n“I was trying to create an atmosphere of feedback/wall of sound only to nearly fall over Yosser asleep in front of my amp.” (Mark, ex-Suffocation)\n\nOver the years Yosser liked to get about a bit:\n\n“He turned up at my house in Cottingham in the early hours of one morning. He must have sniffed me out. He’d come from The Adelphi and found his own way, about 4 miles. I was asleep and I heard just one bark, and thought: ‘That’s funny’, just one bark, not very loud, as if to say ‘It’s me’. So I let him in. The next morning the car was covered in paw prints, where he had been looking to see if I was in the car.” (Joan Jackson)\n\n“On several occaions Yosser would follow band members to Spiders. He became a bit of a regular (although he was never made a member). Paul would get a call in the early hours from Spiders saying ‘We’re putting him in a taxi’.” (Joan Jackson)\n\nOver the years, as he got older, Yosser’s speciality was his eye-watering farts. He didn’t need to bite anyone anymore to get them to move. He just offered a little bit of gentle persuasion. As age caught up with him the years took their toll:\n\n“Yosser stole my heart the moment I saw him even though he was deaf, blind and lame, and my hand would smell something terrible after having pet him” (Stefanie Wilson, US exchange student)\n\nThis all culminated in an incident when Yosser, patrolling the roof patio, spotted a butterfly fluttering around the plants and flowers up there. Taking a giant leap he misjudged it and fell ten feet onto the car park below, breaking both his legs. He survived, but was never the same after it. He lived a bit longer, but eventually succumbed to fate in 1995.\n\nDISCOS\n\nAs well as a change in live music, there was a change in the music played on the turntable. This ranged from Paul Heaton’s soul night, DJ Steve Smith’s 50’s Rockabilly disco, Midge’s 60’s night, Matthew ‘Coyote Trap’ Hogg’s Disco, through to the hilarious Mike and Eddie’s Disco:\n\n“Paul’s freedom loving nature allowed me and my pal Mike Montez to treat the Adelphi customers to Mike and Eddie’s Disco. Every Thursday night, Adelphi would be alive with the Mike and Eddie song:\n\nWe’re Mike and Eddie\n\nWe’re Mike and Eddie\n\nWe’re here to have a laugh with you\n\nWe hope that you are ready\n\nMike’s the tall and handsome one\n\nThe lumpy one is Eddie\n\nHere! Here! Raise a cheer\n\nWe’re Mike and Eddie\n\nPaul Jackson would begin to look concerned as me and Mike barged onto the stage with a collection of albums, 45s and a few 78s. All the records were old and unlooked after. The rule of holding vinyl by the label and edge was broken with spectacular relish. You had the Sex Pistols and Bobby Vee or folk music followed by Motorhead then George Formby. We would deliberately put the arm of the record player down so that it bumped and scratched the record. The loud sound of the records being vandalised would pour through the speakers. Paul Jackson could only look on in dismay, as another stylus would be ruined. We would make rude announcements and give out false information regarding up and coming bands. Part of the night would be given over to bands and before they took to the stage Mike and Eddie would encourage the crowd to boo and heckle (it’s amazing how many took it in good spirits). Towards the end of the bands’ sets we would pass round a Viking helmet and generous customers, bar staff and criminals on the run would donate a few coins for the upkeep of the band. It was always a source of hilarity when Mike and Eddie announced how much money the band had received. It would be so much fun to see their disappointed faces as they received a tiny amount of money for a large amount of time. Some of these bands would have crossed the Pennines in a cold shitty van only to receive about £1.70. After the bands had finished we would sing the Mike and Eddie song and get back to the hi-jinks. I fondly remember Mike running out of the club, climbing on to Paul’s low roof-garden and nicking a pair of underpants from his washing line. Mike was such a sight to see: his gormless face would be twisted into an ecstatic grin as he thrust his crotch into the faces of the customers. Laying down on the dance-floor he would slowly peel off Paul’s dark red underpants. We would end the night on a patriotic theme by playing ‘Land of Hope and Glory’ whilst thanking various people who had contributed to the evening, either a ridiculous historical figure, Jesus perhaps, or a bloke at the bar who contributed nothing. Me and Mike reclaimed a whole FIVE pounds, which we would waste on Hot Roasted Chestnuts. The fun of it, the constant disappointment and the sheer lack of talent would make you feel strangely alive. For a bit.” (Eddie Smith, ex-Gargoyles)\n\n“My favourite nights were Thursdays, when Mike and Eddie used to DJ and entertain in between two or three local bands. The Viking helmet would be passed around and shared between the bands at the end of the night. I remember Mike chasing Eddie, both completely naked, with a rolled up newspaper to the Laurel and Hardy theme – Fucking Hilarious!” (Guy Gibson, ex-Vagrant)\n\nPROMOTION (FLYERS / POSTERS, ETC\n\n(To the tune of ‘My Favourite Things’, kinda…)\n\n“Hand-written flyers on odd coloured paper,\n\nSave me from calling the TV repairman.\n\nThere’s DIY ethics coming from it in spades,\n\nThe Adelphi is calling me down to De Grey.”\n\n(Kenny Archibald, poet)\n\nThe Adelphi flyers first appeared shortly after Paul took over the club. During the next 14 months they evolved into the form they still are today. Different things have been tried occasionally, but the old style’s still the best. Similarly, there has been the occasional promotional poster introducing the club and its wares, some creative, some a bit sloppy, but all fit in with the Adelphi’s DIY ethos.\n\n“A quick glance at one of the monthly flyers would leave anyone impressed by the sheer diversity of bands/acts that Paul invites to come and play, not to mention the regular ‘club’ nights which local DJ’s put on. From reggae to punk, folk to hip hop, funk to electronica, there really is something to meet everyone’s musical preferences.” (Lewis McNeill)\n\n“I love the flyers. Personal touch. Never glossed or colour. I always read them top to bottom every month and marvel at the musical diversity.” (Andrew, Yo-Yo)\n\nEND WORD\n\n14 months after Paul had taken over the club some fundamental changes had come about then. The original clientele had largely departed. Gone was the pool, darts and dominoes teams and the Alternative Cabaret. The types of live music performed and the records played had changed. The club was on the Toilet Tour, had provided support to the Housemartins, and had its own unique club nights. Promotion and advertising was done on a shoestring. And a dog owned the place.\n\nOVERVIEW – (1986-1995)\n\nThe period between 1986 and 1995 saw a diverse array of bands, local, national and international, playing at the club, as well as a variety of other related activities. In order to keep a grasp of this dynamic period we have broken it down into two distinct, if not strictly chronological, musical phases. Firstly, we want to consider 1986-89, widely recognised as the most dynamic phase of the club’s history. Secondly, we examine 1990-95, a period when some of the biggest name bands ever to play the Adelphi performed there, whilst, paradoxically, the club was in relative decline. Finally, we reflect on some of the other activities, musical, music-related, political and so on, that took place, or was established at the club, between 1986-1995.\n\nA HULL IN MY HEART\n\n[FOR FATBOY SLIM, HULL, MARCH 10, 2001]\n\nAdelphi mid-eighties. A wonderful place\n\nThe Gargoyles, Pink Noise, and Jacko’s friendly face.\n\nThis poet, twice yearly, a touring Seagull.\n\nAnd you, The Housemartins. ‘Fourth best band in Hull…’\n\nSo who was the best?, well you never let on.\n\n[I liked Death by Milkfloat, now sadly long gone] But you upped and made it, and we knew the score:\n\nIt was there on the cover. London 0, Hull 4.\n\nThen Heato went south with his tongue in his cheek\n\n[though he’s seen at the Mainbrace a few times a week] And you and DH from the punk days in Kent\n\nNow sponsor the Albion. Thanks money well spent.\n\nYes, we’re going places – with SKINT on our kit\n\nThis is our club culture and we’re proud of it!\n\nRespect from someone who was there at the start.\n\nAdelphi, De Grey Street. A Hull in my heart.\n\n(Attilla the Stockbroker)\n\nLOCAL\n\nThe local music scene expanded rapidly following the success of The Housemartins. Suddenly, everybody was in a band, everybody wanted to play at the Adelphi, and everybody was hoping to be the Next Big Thing. As well as some of the earlier Adelphi regulars, like The Velvetones, Coyote Trap and The Gargoyles, there were suddenly a plethora of local acts on the scene. Literally hundreds of bands formed and re-formed in Hull during this time. This newly-found enthusiasm, coupled with more and more national touring bands and the alternative influences they introduced, brought about the most dynamic musical phase in the club’s 20 year history. Virtually every musical form and genre appeared at the club – from indie, rock, punk, reggae, hardcore, noise, blues, folk, jazz – the list is endless. This enthusiasm and dynamism was reflected by the relative success of the Adelphi in financial terms. More importantly perhaps, a strong sense of musical community developed around the club, one that still exists, albeit in a less active sense, to this very day.\n\n“All centred around that place. Like some sort of adult Byker Grove.” (Nick Taylor, The Unity Club)\n\n“There were some wonderful gigs: Pulp, The La’s, The Brilliant Corners, The Three Johns, Attila, The Housemartins, The Gargoyles and Death By Milkfloat. But best of all was the sense of being part of a community capable of making its own entertainment. That is why the audience at gigs by local bands was significantly populated by other bands.” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\n“It was always packed out in the reign of The Gargoyles, Pink Noise and Death by Milkfloat.” (Sarah Collingridge, ex-bar staff)\n\nPINK NOISE\n\nFirst played – 1985 Times played – c.35 Last played – 1989\n\n(Please note: Pink Noise actually first played at the Adelphi in 1985, including supporting The Housemartins’ signing gig, but are located here because they are more clearly identified with the period 1986-9 – oh, and we want to look at them in relation to their main rivals and friends, Death By Milkfloat)\n\n“We ended up storing our gear there and using the club as our private rehearsal space. I don’t know how many times we played there or how frequently, but it was a lot and often.” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\n“Pink Noise used to have The Beat’s ‘Stand Down Margaret’ playing before they came on stage. Hearing that song got the Adelphi crowd on their feet, out of the toilets, through from the front bar. There was always great anticipation before a Pink Noise gig and that song helped set the mood.” (Katy Noone, ex-Coyote Trap)\n\n“Pink Noise, they were a really good band. When they first set off the guitarist was really shrill and loud, I really had trouble getting their sound right. Every time they turned up I’d mention it to them. Eventually we got there.” (Jim Nutter, mixer man)\n\n“There seemed to be a bit of rivalry between Pink Noise and Death by Milkfloat. Both bands used to play regularly, both were trios, both were really good live acts, but for me Pink Noise just had the (thin end of the w)edge.” (Dr Ian Smith)\n\n“Pink Noise were basically Hull’s answer to The Jam, The Redskins and The Neurotics and had the talent, passion, compassion, intelligence and drive to stand shoulder to shoulder with any of them. A great Hull band.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nDEATH BY MILKFLOAT\n\nFirst played – 1986 Times played – c.35 Last played – 1992\n\n“Favourite song title: ‘Take that, you fucker!’” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\n“I managed to infiltrate the inner-most sanctums of the Adelphi Club,\n\ngenerally by hassling Paul a lot. In 1986 me, Phil Dolby, and Steve Kelly formed Death By Milkfloat, playing our first ever show at the club (at the time it gained Paul’s ‘best ever debut gig’ award), and after an illustrious career of mass Peel plays, and Euro tours, we put a full stop to our art school spikiness with a ‘final gig’, again at The Adelphi, in 1992. What goes around comes around!” (Jonny Dawe, ex-Death By Milkfloat)\n\n“I’m not from Hull, but I know that it’s the mainspring of the local scene, the place where everyone started and everyone still does. Just to mention a few: 3 Action, the Gargoyles, Pink Noise, my old mate Swift Nick and the band with the best name in the history of rock n roll – Death By Milkfloat. It’s not for me to say what we sounded like on stage, but Attila the Stockbroker and Death by Milkfloat looked good together on a poster! Of course, it’s where the Housemartins started too, beginning the career of Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim.” (Attila the Stockbroker)\n\n“Milkfloat’s last gig was a great gig for me and probably one of my all-time favourites at the Adelphi. First on, Think Tank, (one of their last gigs also), Kingmaker in the middle and, finally, Milkfloat. I was sad to see them go but pleased it was such a great gig. Raw talent, great big sound with minimum amount of fuss or equipment!” (Tony Peaks, ex-Kicks/New Day Rising/ Suffocation)\n\n“Milkfloat – the best, the cream of the crop (excuse the pun) of all the Hull bands. Last ever gig was a real tearjerker, guitars on nooses and then outside to smash the trusty old van up!!” (Jon McArthur)\n\n“Death by Milkfloat were here with me and even moved into No 69, a few doors away. They were an amazing live band whose recordings never quite ‘worked’ for one reason or another. They were, nevertheless, among the most music literate bands I have ever known, and a great set of lads too.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nNATIONAL\n\nAs well as a wide and diverse local music scene, the club played host to more and more bands from the national scene, including return visits from bands like Pulp, The Shamen and Manic Street Preachers, Kitchens of Distinction, AC Temple, James Taylor Quartet, Tommy Chase, Chumbawamba, Inspiral Carpets and so on. Adelphi’s role as part of the ‘toilet’ tour was firmly established during this period. As a result, there were lots of great live performances at the club, one’s that are still remembered to this day. Like the local music scene, touring bands and performers playing at the club covered a wide variety of musical forms and genres. Several local bands themselves became part of the tour, touring and developing relationships with some of them. The other main bands to play at the club during this era, who often developed a close working relationship and, indeed, friendship with Paul and the Adelphi, included:\n\nHAPPY MONDAYS\n\nFirst played – 1986 Times played – 3 Last played – 1988\n\nThe freaky factory dancers themselves appeared, somewhat controversially, on no less than three occasions.\n\n“They seemed to be on every week at one point.” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise, who perhaps confuses his weeks with his years!)\n\n“I was really shocked the first time I saw them – they just smoked dope onstage as they played as if it were nothing out of the ordinary. They did some great shows though. Bez would be there dancing away – always an interesting distraction!” (Martin Deas)\n\n“The Happy Mondays: friendly and high and pissed.” (Tony Peaks. Ex-Kicks/ New Day Rising/Suffocation)\n\n“Happy Mondays… what a party, the like of which the Adelphi could not have been prepared for. Out of control madness, that somehow held itself together by the tiniest of threads. We all drunkenly danced the night away with a swagger. My memory is fuzzy, but just remember thinking ‘This is fucking brilliant’. Paul had to adjust a few clauses in their contract to try and tame their public chemical abuse on their Adelphi return.” (Jonny Dawe, ex-Death by Milkfloat)\n\n“The Happy Mondays were dominated by both of their managers and the benign smile of a young, and extremely polite, Shaun Ryder, who always seemed grateful for what was given – which was nice. Manager 1, Phil Saxe, resembled both a manager and a gorilla, but was ok. Manager 2 was Shaun’s dad, Derek, whom I came to regard as one of the great characters of the live circuit. He was quiet, highly intelligent, polite and a real music nutcase but with a real serious maverick streak that I came to respect enormously. The Happy Mondays shows here were great.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nTHE LA’s\n\nFirst played – 1987 Times played – 3 Last played – 1987\n\nThe long association between the Adelphi and Liverpool bands The La’s, and their subsequent offshoot, Cast, began around this time:\n\n“I’ve played the Adelphi about 15 times, lots of times with both The La’s and Cast. The Adelphi was the first gig that I ever did, that The La’s ever did, outside of Liverpool. Paul Jackson and the Adelphi came in with a gig for us. We didn’t have a drummer and the three of us drove over there with a hotchpotch selection of guitars. I borrowed one, a Mustang bass. I remember the gig well, like no drummer, but we seemed to have a good laugh. We drove home full of good ambitions and it was the beginning of something, the beginning of all our dreams coming into some kind of order” (Jon Power, ex-La’s/Cast)\n\n“My band Coyote Trap supported The La’s at one of their first Adelphi gigs. They were breathtaking. Loads of people who’d never heard of them came through from the pool room to watch. Brilliant to hear the opening bars to ‘There She Goes’ for the very first time through the Adelphi PA.” (Katy Noone, ex-Coyote Trap)\n\n“I missed The La’s first acoustic only set (think this was their first show outside of da’ pool), but got to see their next Adelphi gig. What a live band they were, these first few Adelphi shows were as good as they get. Paul used to play the demo version of ‘Liberty Ship’ over the Adelphi sound system, a psychedelic epic, which still sends shivers down my spine.” (Jonny Dawe, ex-Death by Milkfloat)\n\n“The La’s: the best band I ever saw at the Adelphi.” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\n“The La’s played their first ‘out of town’ show here, and we did them 3 times in total using the old Adelphi PA. They always sounded great despite the fact that the PA consisted only of a 4 channel mic mixer and some cheapo £7 microphones! Among the folk who saw The La’s here were significant numbers who had seen lots of shows before, and will have seen lots of shows since. Pretty much all of them will say that The La’s live show was the best, or among the best, they ever saw. All of which seems rather bizarre when you consider that chirrupy guitar based ‘Pop’ music is generally seen as something to avoid these days. The La’s were very special indeed and there could yet be a sting in the tail.” (Paul Jackson)\n\n“Lee Mavers gave me his harmonica after one gig. I’ve still got it now.” (Graham, Hairdresser to the Stars)\n\n“At one gig some guy blagged Lee’s harmonica off him. Offered to cut his hair for free or something!” (Jon Power, ex-La’s/Cast)\n\nSTONE ROSES\n\nFirst and last played – 1987 Times played – 1\n\nStone Roses played just prior to making it big to a somewhat disputed audience size:\n\n“They turned up – like most Manchester bands at about 9 o’clock – and demanded a soundcheck. All the kids, their entourage, were saying: ‘this band’s going to me massive’. At that time they were playing to about a thousand people in Manchester, but outside of that nobody had heard of them. They played to about 10 people, maybe. I remember Ian Brown going bonkers, running up and down the tables.” (Dave Stead, ex-mixer man, ex-Viscious Circle/Beautiful South)\n\n“I was paid £4 plus free entry by Jacko for putting up posters for the Stone Roses, and saw Ian Brown jumping all over the punters.” (Guy Gibson, ex-Vagrant)\n\n“My resounding memory of The Stone Rose were that they were really good, although there weren’t many there. A year later they were massive.” (Dave Bush)\n\n“The Stone Roses, playing to the bar staff and a dog, all dressed in paisley shirts – the band that is!” (Jonny Dawe, ex-Death by Milkfloat)\n\n“The Stone Roses were booked to promote the first release of ‘Sally Cinnamon’ by their manager who assured me that the band were going to be massive. The product certainly walked the walk, though the gig itself was not great with a poor turnout of around only 30.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nCARTER USM\n\nFirst played – 1988 Times played – 9 Last played – 1996\n\nCarter USM developed a particular rapport with the club and some of the local bands who subsequently toured with them:\n\n“Carter played nine gigs at The Adelphi, including one on our ‘Favourite Venues’ Christmas tour where we returned to places that we’d outgrown. We had to climb over the DJ booth – which was next to the toilets back then – to get on to the stage. I’d never seen so many people crammed into such a small place. And in the same way that everyone claimed to be at the first Sex Pistols gig, I’d like to think that everyone would say they were at that Carter gig at the Hull Adelphi. The difference being, of course, that everyone was at that Carter gig at The Hull Adelphi. And then returning to the Adelphi a decade later, to play to considerably fewer people on the ‘Who’s The Daddy Now?’ tour, to find Jim still doing the sound, the same pre-gig takeaway (choice between Chinese or a curry) and Paul Jackson with what may or may not have been the same piece of sellotape holding his glasses together. In a land of Barflys and Carling Academys that’s somehow reassuring.” (Jim Bob, Carter USM)\n\n“Christmas Pudding Tour Diary. Hull – The Adelphi 1996 – The Hull Adelphi was one of the places that would book Carter when no one else would. We played supporting Thee Hypnotics and a few others before being given a headline spot and then going on to beat the attendance record. Someone had been doing a bit of decorating since the last time we were there, the bands didn’t have to climb over the DJ booth to get onstage anymore and there was a dressing room, so you didn’t have to wait in the men’s toilets before going on stage. Even though it had been five years since we last played there, it was a bit like we had never been away. Paul Jackson, the guy who runs the place was as generous and helpful as ever and Jim, the soundman, was apologising about the sound equipment as always. As the Adelphi only holds 250 people, the venue was packed pretty much from the word go. Walking through the audience I recognised quite a few faces from the distant past, slightly fatter and with less hair (and that’s just the women… boom boom!). As soon as we came on stage to do ‘Surfin’ USM’ the place was in chaos, with mic stands flying, monitor speakers disappearing and audience members falling onto the stage in vague attempts to stage dive (the stage is only about a foot higher than the floor so it was much more like stage tripping really). After being whacked in the face with my microphone I decided to play it safe a retreat to the back of the stage out of harm’s way. We had to stop half way through ‘Growing Old Disgracefully’ as some fool fell onto the drum kit and sent Wez flying. During our time on stage some fucker nicked one of our microphones, so if anyone knows who did it, tell ’em to send it back to us as we need it and they are bloody expensive. Despite all the damage, everyone had a riotous time and it’ll be a gig that I’ll remember for some time. The entire audience sang the intro to ‘New Cross’, it was a shame that it was in the wrong key, but never mind, it went a bit Jazz Funk there for a moment.” (Fruitbat, Carter USM)\n\n“From ‘Surfin’ USM’ to ‘Sheriff Fatman’, Carter powered their way through ‘101 Damnations’. It was a glorious, torrential downpour of energetic anthems leaving a capacity crowd soaked to the skin. We walked home freezing in the night air with a smile on our faces, wringing our clothes out on the way.” (Chris Dimmack)\n\n“The band had stopped their track and the singer was talking. I did a double-take as he said something along the lines of: ‘This next one’s for Martine, we really hope you made it to see us tonight’. I spun round and stared at the stage, but I hadn’t imagined it. We spent the rest of the set actually watching, as well as listening, and it was a memorable sight. When the band came off and headed for a beer, I introduced myself to the singer, in a ‘Hello, I’m the person you’ve just dedicated a song to, who are you?’ kind of way. Turns out his name was Jim Bob and I’d just witnessed Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine in action.” (Martine Otton)\n\n“Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine! This was a band who’d split about five years before, but came back presumably because they liked the place, not because they could now play nowhere bigger. So one night I left other freshers to their pre-club party, going in search of this off-the-map ‘Music Capital of Hull’. Hardly an auspicious start to city gig-going: a reunion tour for sometime smash hits, and hardly anyone there. ‘Has everyone moved away from Hull?’ asked Fruitbat, inviting the meagre audience to join his buddies at the front of the stage. One pointed at me: ‘He’s from Hull!’” (Al Maceachem, fanzine writer)\n\n“The ensuing friendship struck up with The Von Trapps and Carter USM (‘The north and south are divided no more’), is still ongoing to this day.” (Chris Hudson, ex-The Von Trapps)\n\n“Carter shows were always great – like having mates around for tea. They made great music at the time and nobody could copy it. It started in front of 10 men and a dog, then rapidly advanced to 50, 100, 150 and a couple of sell out shows. The dog was there throughout and never quite knew what to make of Jim Bob and Fruitbat. He would stand in front of the stage staring at Jim Bob as he screeched out ‘Sheriff Fatman’ or something. He would then climb onto the stage and start barking before circling menacingly and snapping (not biting) at the frontman’s heels. Jim Bob’s axeman posturing and face solos during this period would have been the envy of any of our local guitar schools!” (Paul Jackson)\n\nHOT GIGS\n\nBOB, THIN WHITE ROPE AND MY BLOODY VALENTINE\n\nPlayed: Saturday 15th October 1988\n\nA number of contributors mentioned one particular gig which featured three headline bands, Bob, My Bloody Valentine and US band Thin White Rope, all on the same bill. Something to do with a double-booking or some such like. It almost became a ‘battle of the bands’ affair, such was the competition onstage. This gig is remembered as one of the best ever at the Adelphi.\n\n“Bob were London boys, Peel favourites and Adelphi regulars. When they played the place would be packed every time. Then there was one gig in the late 1980s. Half an hour after opening, the Adelphi was absolutely heaving. Sheffield and Manchester accents at the pool table. Six deep at the bar. Bob were headlining, but so were Thin White Rope and My Bloody Valentine. All three on the bill, same night. Double booking? Good planning? Not sure but it was the best billing I ever saw. Richard and Simon from Bob, all melodic Indie angst and tight harmonies. They usually played with a determined intensity on stage but tonight they were jumping around like their lives depended on it. Thin White Rope’s Guy Kyser thrashing his guitar with that usual brooding tension and probably wondering why on earth their home American crowds didn’t react like this seething audience did. And My Bloody Valentine, NME front page regulars, playing that splintering rhythmic noise that didn’t always make sense, but this glorious night it hit you like some sort of revelation. All three. Any one of them could have headlined but you didn’t really care who did. Just to be there was enough. Condensation running down the walls. The bar staff standing on beer crates to see the stage. Members of every one of the local bands of the era in the audience.” (Katy Noone, ex-Coyote Trap)\n\n“My Bloody Valentine / Thin White Rope. I love MBV, this was the first time I’d seen them since they turned noisy, the beginning of the golden years for the Valentines. 2 headline bands were booked in error on the same bill (a discovery made at the last moment), a double plus for music fans, but with both bands on large guarantees Paul kept a nervous eye on the takings that night.” (Jonny Dawe, ex-Death by Milkfloat)\n\n“My Bloody Valentine sharing the bill with Thin White Ropeand Bob. It was a packed, noisy, exciting gig.” (Tony Peaks, ex-Kicks/New Day Rising/ Suffocation)\n\n“It was said that Jacko double-booked them, that they tossed a coin to see who went on last. We knew it was gonna be another brilliant night at the Adelphi – three top bands for just a few quid. Bob came on. I could see everything over the ocean of bobbing heads (I’m 6’ 3”). Then My Bloody Valentine and getting lost in the ‘sonic cathedral of sound’ they used to have then. Last on, Thin White Rope. Lights go down, a hush fell. Very loud drum pattern, a bass rumbling into life, the speakers shook, the vocalist opens his mouth and wow! The shout for ‘last orders’ was ignored as the whole place bounded up and down. You couldn’t see the stage for flying sweat and mist. Fucking amazing, people looking at each other and smiling.” (Dave ‘Dinger’ Bell)\n\n“My Bloody Valentine were brilliant. They blew everyone else out of the water.” (James Bell)\n\n“Regarded by many as the greatest ever Adelphi show. It wasn’t, but loads of people were there, and it was fantastic – certainly among the top 10. The billing was a double booking & the fault was entirely mine. I had MBV down for Oct 15th and TWR for Nov 15th. Fortunately, the agents were cool about it, and the bands even more so. In fact, Kevin Shields seemed pretty elated to get the chance to play with this amazing band from Arizona. Guy from TWR felt pretty much the same way too. Bob, a superb band in their own right, still talk about the night on the odd occasion when I bump into them in London. Fantastic!” (Paul Jackson)\n\nBEAUTIFUL SOUTH\n\nThe Beautiful South were another band that were based locally and were formed in 1989 by Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway following on from The Housemartins. Their first release catapulted them to the top of the charts and immediate success. As a result, from the outset they were too big to play the Adelphi. However, several band members had played at the club in various other formations and some of them still socialise there to this day. Drummer Dave Stead indicates the ‘Adelphi connection’ in relation to the band’s formation:\n\n“I knew Dave Rotheray to nod my head to because he was a part of the local musician’s scene at the Adelphi. I knew who Paul Heaton was because of The Housemartins and he knew who I was, a nod on the street corner, that kind of thing. Dave Hemingway, I knew, he was in a lot of Hull bands – The Newpolitans, The Velvetones and The Housemartins. After The Housemartins, Paul needed a drummer. He’d already recruited Dave Hemingway, Dave Rotheray and Shaun Welch. He asked Gary from 3 Action if he knew a drummer and he suggested me. Paul called and the rest is history as they say. So I guess Paul knew me because of shared friends at the Adelphi who played in bands. It’s the easiest place to recruit. I was 23 and offered a new opportunity with The Beautiful South.” (Dave Stead, Beautiful South)\n\nMUSIC (1990-1995) – DECLINE\n\nAs the 1990s dawned, the earlier dynamism and energy of the local and national music scene of the mid/late-80’s gave way to one of relative decline. This decline wasn’t only in relation to the fortunes of the Adelphi, but more widely a part of the decline of live music itself as a result of important changes within the music industry.\n\nFirstly, the indies music scene, with its emphasis on independence and originality, was effectively bought out by the major labels. The effect of this was to reduce the independence which bands had enjoyed under the indies scene, and to hand more control back to corporate interests and the profit nexus. The indies chart disappeared and indies culture, which had underpinned the Adelphi’s output, largely disappeared with it.\n\nSecondly, there was a fundamental shift from live music in favour of the club scene, with its emphasis on DJ’s, club nights and raves rather than on live performance. Fewer people came to watch live music and, allied with this, fewer saw live performance as a route to success. This, of course, suited the major labels, whose priorities it was to reduce touring overheads, minimise risk and optimise profits.\n\nAt a local level there were two changes that had an important additional negative effect on the club. The Adelphi had always welcomed the local student population, many of whom had formed bands and become regulars at the club. It had also enjoyed a good working relationship with the Student Unions. However, in the early-90’s, the government changed the funding basis for Student Unions, effectively placing them on a corporate footing. Since then the Student Unions’ activities have been set in direct competition to other venues, like the Adelphi, rather than presenting complementary or contrasting events. The Adelphi can no longer advertise gigs in the Union bars without paying exorbitant advertising rates or facing £1000 fines (unlike at the Adelphi, where any other venue is welcome to advertise their events – including the Student Unions). Unfortunately, Student Unions have pursued a dumbed-down approach to culture, with profit as their main goal. Students have missed out on real culture as a result.\n\nIn addition, a new booking agency, SJM, came into being at this time, who, for reasons of their own, decided not to book clients to play at the Adelphi, but place them at larger, more salubrious venues instead. This too had a negative effect on the Adelphi’s fortunes\n\nThese factors explain the club’s decline during this period but, despite these setbacks, the club continued, through the good agencies of Charlie Myatt and others, to put on some of the biggest bands ever to play at the Adelphi. Furthermore, wider opportunities for other musical forms to play at the club came about in the shape of World Music. But, first let’s consider the range of music which came out of the Adelphi between 1990 and 1995.\n\nLOCAL\n\nThe local music scene, which had been frenetic in the late-80’s, was suddenly much quieter, with fewer local bands and fewer local gigs taking place. This lull was reflected by a corresponding fall in audience numbers as well. While there were still several of the older bands on the go, as well as a smattering of new, none really emerged to the same extent as The Gargoyles, Pink Noise and Death by Milkfloat had done in the 1980s. That is not to suggest there were few or no bands of worth, but serves perhaps to illustrate the general apathy and indifference during the period in question. That is except one band, a band who came forth in 1990, began to attract more and more fans to the Adelphi each time they played, and then went on achieve greater national success than any other local band since The Housemartins – Kingmaker.\n\nKINGMAKER\n\nFirst played – 1990 Times played – 12 Last played – 1994\n\nPaul Jackson helped Kingmaker find management and they subsequently signed, with EMI Chrysalis, the first major deal for a Hull band since the The Housemartins back in 1985. They went on to tour supported by bands like Suede, Elastica and Radiohead.\n\n“Seeing people queuing up outside the front door of the club for one of our shows, before it had even opened, was a big moment. We had played much bigger venues by the time we got to fill the Adelphi. And I really mean FILL. The night in question saw the whole place so full that every last breathing space was filled with heaving, sweaty, breathless T-shirted friends, family and fans. It was August and it was hot. Sitting behind the kit all I could see was a wall of cotton, flesh and hair. Before our opening barrage the faces looked edgy and expectant, but there was a real sense that this was going to be shared experience, something special. Sweat ran in increasing trickles down my arms before we had even started. Once the battering commenced it all hurtled along in a frantic blur of crashing bodies, sticks so slippery they felt like ice-pops, sore hands, stinging muscles and a glorious noise, not only from us but the rest of the Adelphi throng. The bodies have never been piled as high as they were that night.” (John Andrew, ex-Kingmaker)\n\n“My memories of the Adelphi are tied inextricably to my memories of Kingmaker. I’d been to Hull before – to interview Paul Heaton, of course – but here was a band whose ascent from local heroes to NME cover stars was seemingly played out at the city’s most iconic ‘smaller venue’. They began as Rain (first gig: the Sherlock Holmes pub situated, yes, on Hull’s Baker Street), then turned into Tombstone Graffiti, advertised for a drummer in a local music shop window with the words, ‘Wanted: drummer. Must be educated to A-level standard’, and Kingmaker were born. By the end of 1990, they had a publishing deal, a record contract, a London PR and a debut EP. Most significantly, they sold out the Adelphi on New Year’s Eve. Did they feel, I asked them, that they could take on the world at that point? ‘We felt like we could take on the Adelphi.’ I saw Kingmaker at the Adelphi. We non-local music journalists called it the Hull Adelphi, to mark it out from all the other Adelphis. We also called the Princess Charlotte the Leicester Princess Charlotte and the Old Trout the Windsor Old Trout. It made things easier as we very occasionally left London. Kingmaker often came to London, to visit their publishing company, their record company or their PR, but it was best to go to Hull. To the Adelphi. It must have been in 1991, the year Kingmaker broke free of the indie herd. Of course it was packed. Of course everyone had a Kingmaker shirt on. Of course I felt privileged to be there. Of course sweat dripped down the walls. Of course I could’ve been in any smaller venue in any town in Britain once the po-going started, but if I had it wouldn’t have felt so special. So local. So Hull. Their best-known song at the time was ‘Really Scrape The Sky’. In the Adelphi, they really scraped the ceiling. Kingmaker’s philosophy was to return. They gigged hard, 50 dates at a time, and instead of moving to a bigger venue when they came back to a particular town, they played the same venue again. And again. That said, the next time I came to Hull to see them, it was at the bigger, 700-capacity Tower Ballroom. Traitors. Did they feel they could take on the Top 40? Yes, and they felt they had taken on the Hull Adelphi.” (Andrew Collins, ex-editor NME)\n\n“I hit the road with Kingmaker. I had an amazing time and loved being out on the road. The Kingmaker tours all started or ended (and sometimes both), at the Adelphi. This was in homage to Jacko for his hard work in helping Kingmaker get signed. He hooked them up with management and gave them all the best slots at the Adelphi. These gigs were tremendous. The band was tight and the gigs were rammed. I remember one Kingmaker night standing round the corner of the stage, not being able to see it, outside the old toilets. I was joined by the bass player’s family all dripping with tobacco stained punk sweat. It was mayhem of the finest kind. The drummer by the way was shit hot. I ended up learning a thing or two off him in the couple of years. But not about hairstyling!!! But mind you, the others two made up for that. They were always neatly presented with brylcream quiffs. The next few tours saw Kingmaker supported by Suede, Elastica and Radiohead. All of whom went on to more success.” (Andy Dimmack, roadie, ex-Kingmaker/Elastica/Super Furry Animals)\n\n“I first saw Kingmaker in 1990 when they were supposed to be supporting Dr. Phibes and the House of Wax Equations. Dr Phibes cancelled and Kingmaker were bumped up to headliners and played one of the best gigs I’ve ever seen.” (Priya, Yo-Yo)\n\n“Kingmaker’s New Years Eve gig don’t get much better. John Andrews’ weird blue drum kit, Loz all Bob Dylan and Myles looking like one of Ned’s Atomic Dustbin – didn’t keep that look for long!” (Mark, ex-Suffocation)\n\n“I went to see some ‘Special Guests’ play a supposedly ‘secret’ gig. The band turned out to be Hull’s very own Kingmaker and they sounded amazing. This was my first experience of seeing a gig in a small venue. Apart from the sweat, energy and excitement of the night, I remember walking away, wondering how a dog had managed to remain fast asleep at the front of the stage for the entire gig (maybe it preferred dance music?).” (Martin Knight, ex-Mind Candy/The Favours)\n\n“Kingmaker – nice bunch of lads and, dare I say it, some good tunes!” (Jon McArthur)\n\n“The first Kingmaker demo was the most basic recording imaginable, but it had a remarkable quality and maturity and worked a treat. I soon found myself firing copies off to a few folk in London, getting a pretty much instant response from none other than 2 agents: namely Charlie Myatt and John Gammon. To cut a long story short, I fixed them up with management and the band were duly signed to EMI Chrysalis. For the next couple of years Kingmaker were the ‘happening’ band of the moment, alongside other emerging bands of the time, such as Radiohead, Blur & Elastica, before it all went pear shaped.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nNATIONAL\n\nWhile Kingmaker became part of the national music scene, other national bands, some of who have subsequently become household names, came to play at the Adelphi. However, these were the exceptions in a period of progressive, and then suddenly rapid, decline in the club’s fortunes.\n\nPJ HARVEY\n\nFirst played – 1991 Times played – 2 Last played – 1992\n\n“PJ Harvey – she and her band sat on the same table as me and my mates when she supported Leatherface. I would like to say she blew them away… but she didn’t!” (Jon McArthur)\n\n“Having a friend who was putting out her early records, I came pre-prepared for PJ (may have already seen her in London, can’t remember),\n\nand couldn’t wait for the Adelphi gig. I think these early songs still stand up as some of her best. I guess this gig holds more of a personal significance (as gigs can), and represents a point in her career that I could relate to in terms of my musical advances, sort of ‘growing older with Polly Harvey’, if you get my drift. Remember talking to the bass player about boring muso stuff – he was more boring than me!” (Jonny Dawes, ex-Death by Milkfloat)\n\n“At the soundcheck she looked like a washed out bag lady, two hours later a screaming banshee.” (Paul Watts, ex-Suffocation)\n\n“P. J. Harvey played twice here. The 2nd show accompanied the release of ‘Sheela Na Gig’ and sold out, which meant that there was little in the way of social contact or pleasantries. Great night though, as was the first show, in which Polly and band supported none other than Frankie Stubbs and the mighty Leatherface. She had found all this rather intimidating though the Geordies were always a pleasure to work with and the billing worked a treat.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nRADIOHEAD\n\nFirst played – 1992 Times played – 2 Last played – 1993\n\nRadiohead played twice at the Adelphi and were chosen to support Kingmaker during their subsequent national tour. They also supported them at a special gig, promoted by Paul Jackson, at the larger venue, The Tower, in Hull.\n\n“We played twice at the Hull Adelphi and I loved them both. We’d never played in a terraced house before; we’d rehearse in the house we shared then in Oxford, which was only semi-detached. At the end of May, 1992, I remember rolling up in the rusty white van, and unloading our purple-boxed gear round the back, which was where the audience came in. We all marvelled at the pool table in the front room, and were grateful for a fiver each from Paul Jackson to eat out at a delicious local Thai restaurant. We even had a support band, called Think Tank, very cordial folk who were patient with our soundcheck. There was an old, deaf dog who sat directly between the mixing desk and a pillar of loudspeakers, and failed to respond to any of our noisy exertions. The second time we played, in February 1993, we had the beginnings of some success with ‘Creep’, but what made the night most memorable was that we were staying in the local Camponile motel, instead of the usual five hour slog back to Oxford. What luxury! Unfortunately, we shared the hotel with a visiting troupe of Chippendales, who were stalked by a posse of older women at the hotel gates. Tired from our show at the Adelphi, we were kept up by the sounds of screaming and vomiting from their floor. Truly rock and roll! The only consolation came the next morning when the hotel maid mistook Ed for a Chippendale, which he loved, obviously. We loved playing the Adelphi, for its quirks and hospitality, and the closeness of the audience. Now, I’m afraid, we could never do it, because there would be no room for our ‘ego’ ramps into the audience, costume changes and individual flight-cased purple wardrobes. Also, security would be a nightmare, because we’d end up talking to the fans… maybe we should’ve toured with the Chippendales.” (Colin Greenwood, Radiohead)\n\n“Who’d have thought they’d turn into the monster they are now? Not me, but I’m glad they did.” (Jonny Dawe, ex-Death by Milkfloat)\n\n“The Radiohead gig was superb. They brought their own light show. Well, 5 par cans with no gel in them, so it entirely lit up the room from the stage end. They had just started out as a small Oxford band and they were outstandingly tight and a real wall of sound. They even covered ‘Rhinestone Cowboy’! I have seen them many a time since, but that 1st time was special.” (Andy Dimmack, roadie, Super Furry Animals)\n\n“Radiohead had just released ‘Creep’ and they were on the brink of being enormous. I was completely blown away by the quality of their songs.” (Priya, Yo-Yo)\n\n“I saw Radiohead just after ‘Creep’ was released as a single. A large group of people were sat cross-legged on the main part of the floor, preventing a huge queue of people from getting in. A message came up on the scrolling LED display saying something like: ‘This is not a student party. Get off the fucking floor’ – or words to that effect, and they promptly scattered. Once everyone stood up, I couldn’t actually see anything, but the music sounded great!” (Dr Ruth Graham)\n\n“We supported Radiohead at the Adelphi. Talking to them in the front bar before the gig we found they were really polite, friendly and quietly-spoken. When they came on though they were so loud it was untrue. They were mesmerising. You could tell they were something special, but never expected them to be as big as they’ve become.” (Alan Jones, ex-Spacemaid)\n\n“Radiohead played here twice and were like ‘best mates’ to work with. They told their agent Charlie Myatt that the Adelphi was the best show on the small gig circuit. I like to think that all this was because they were treated like human beings and were able to mix with music literate people like themselves. The shows worked on all levels. They also toured with Kingmaker, which must have left a ‘Hull in their hearts’. I regard Radiohead as one of the few genuinely great bands left on this planet, and among the all time top ten, while still retaining the potential to push boundaries still further. Have fully deserved everything they have got since.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nCAST\n\nFirst played – 1992 Times played – 8/9 Last played – 1994\n\nCast, John Power’s own band following the demise of The La’s, became a bit of a regular fixture at the club. He still plays solo at the Adelphi to this day:\n\n“We were all really excited because John Power’s new band Cast were playing. John took up position at the front. I was a big fan of The La’s so I was nervous about how it would go. Any doubts were soon dispelled though because the new material was really good. No one was disappointed. Everyone went mad!” (Graham, Hairdresser to the Stars)\n\n“The drummer was like Keith Moon. He had a really odd-sized bass drum and a wide-eyed stare. They sounded like a real 50’s Mersey beat with 4 part harmonies and drew a real big crowd.” (Mark Richards, ex-Suffocation)\n\n“Cast – the Adelphi house band during the early-90’s – saw them more than I saw my cats!” (Jon McArthur)\n\n“I saw John Power earlier this year at the Adelphi, playing an acoustic solo set. The performance was exhilarating, all the classic Cast, a few La’s, and a handful of new songs. Watching just one man and a guitar the audience were enthralled. Alone on stage, without interference from other instruments, the songs somehow stripped and pure. Power’s genius shone brightly through the small venue, warming the hearts of those who had ventured out on such a miserable night. He may have been to the Adelphi 8 or 9 times over the years in different guises, but I know he’ll be back. Musically there’s whole lot more to come.” (Chris Dimmack)\n\n“The material John Power had written as the 2nd La’s album struggled out of the bag in the form of Cast: and what a struggle it was. No-one would put the band on, and Go! Discs seemed to pull off every imaginable, dodgy corporate trick to ensure that this was a career doomed to failure. I would think that between 1992-4 Cast played the Adelphi 8 or 9 times, during which time they progressed from the vaguely shambolic to something approaching, and almost equalling, the magnificence of The La’s. “ (Paul Jackson)\n\nOASIS\n\nFirst and last played – 1994 Times played – 1\n\nThe original Oasis gig booked at the club was cancelled. By the time they honoured the gig, they had attained overnight success on the popularity of ‘Supersonic’.\n\n“This guy was sat all on his own on the way out to the toilets. I realised that it was Liam Gallagher and told him that I liked the new single (‘Supersonic’). His response? ‘Cheers, mate’. But when the gig started they played one which I thought was a cover for ‘I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing’. I decided I wasn’t that keen anymore. I preferred Shed Seven – who’d been on the week before!” (Graham, Hairdresser to the Stars)\n\n“I went down De Grey Street early one evening and saw a queue outside the club. I remember thinking that I didn’t know what was going on any more. I’d never seen queues there before.” (Nick Clay, ex-Pink Noise)\n\n“This was a gig of enormous rock ‘n’ roll proportions. People were squeezed in every available space. They were totally amazing!” (Priya, Yo-Yo)\n\n“The best gig I’ve ever been to at the Adelphi has to be Oasis. It was probably only a week after they played ‘Supersonic’ on The Word and the venue was as packed as I’ve ever seen it. I remember standing at the front of the stage seeing Liam Gallagher swagger onstage and knowing instantly that this was going to be amazing. Hearing ‘Live Forever’, ‘Cigarettes and AlcohoI’, ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Star’ and ‘Shakermaker’, played in front of 150 people was something I’ll never forget. After the opening song, we were forced to retreat to the back of the venue in fear of getting crushed by the crowd. I’ve seen Oasis a few times since, at places like Earl’s Court and the Leeds Festival, but none of these huge shows could touch the magic of that night at the Adelphi.” (Martin Knight, ex-Mind Candy/The Favours)\n\n“Oasis played here the day before the release of ‘Supersonic’ and consequently sold the place out – substantially, though not excessively. They were actually nice to work with: seemed to love the Tropicana (now Java) curry, and talked incessantly about The Beatles. People think I hate Oasis but they are wrong. What I hated was all the bands, and endless streams of demos, that tried to emulate them. I used to have this nightmare vision of being an A & R man!” (Paul Jackson)\n\nSKUNK ANANSIE\n\nFirst played – 1994 Times played – 2/3 Last played – 1995\n\n“This band started playing, really loud, with the most amazingly tight rhythm section you could imagine. Everyone in the front pool room suddenly stopped, looked at each other, and went to check out what was going on. There was this incredible looking, shaven-headed black woman, really going for it, with this astonishing wall of sound behind her. There was only a handful of people in there. But, you could tell this band were something special – really jaw-dropping, heart-stopping stuff!” (Dr Ian Smith)\n\n“3 fifty year old blokes with a gorgeous young singer. I think they were promoting the tune ‘Selling Jesus’ or something. Intense full-on, energetic rock when live, unlike their chart hits which were more melodic ballads. Really tight with real stage presence.” (Mark Richards, ex-Suffocation)\n\n“Skunk Anansie played here 2 or 3 times and we saw them develop into a huge professional outfit. Skin was a huge talent, a real person, and had the most amazing voice, which should always serve her well.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nSUPERGRASS\n\nFirst and last played – 1995 Times played – 2/3\n\nAn incredibly youthful Supergrass performed at the club several times in quick succession:\n\n“Paula & I refused to knock 50p off a pint for Supergrass, stating they were bloody lucky they were getting served. They only looked about 12!” (Carmel Kilbride, bar staff, aged 13)\n\n”The band went on to play a storming gig. It was at the time when ‘Mansize Rooster’ had been released. Support came from an up and coming band called The Bluetones.” (Priya, Yo-Yo)\n\n“They played a really short gig once, starting with ‘Alright’, followed by half a dozen others, culminating with an encore of ‘Alright’. A few days later they were on ‘Top of the Pops’, playing – you’ve guessed it – ‘Alright’, which had just entered the charts.” (Dr Ian Smith)\n\n“Along with Radiohead, The Bluetones and many other bands, Supergrass came here through the good offices of Charlie Myatt. We got 2 or 3 shows out of them and they were a mighty fine band, and lovely to work with too. People say; as they invariably do, that the best shows they ever saw by Supergrass were those at The Adelphi.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nINTERNATIONAL\n\nThe Adelphi continued to put on a variety of international bands in the early-1990s. One of these, Green Day, went on the achieve major international success.\n\nGREEN DAY\n\nFirst and last played – 1991 Times played – 1\n\n“Being in a crowd of 50 or so, watching new US hardcore band Green Day, thinking they were brilliant for the first 7 songs, and then being bored (I’m still the same now!).” (Guy Gibson, ex-Vagrant)\n\n“Went to see a new American band around this time called Green Day. New Hüsker Dü? We didn’t think so!!!!!” (Tony Peaks, ex-Kicks/New Day Rising/Suffocation)\n\n“Green Day are Shit.” (song title, Santa’s BuggerBoyz)\n\n“Green Day played here just before Xmas, on the back of an acclaimed, and profitable, first US tour. They were great to work with, slept upstairs and got on really well with the dog. This was despite the fact that one of them had actually been responsible for killing a Springer Spaniel a couple of years previously. Even at this early stage the accessibility and poppiness of their ‘hardcore’ shone brightly. I remember making several recommendations to various A & R reps which came to nowt.” (Paul Jackson)\n\nWORLD MUSIC (c.1992 – Present)\n\nAs the Indies scene declined further the number of local bands and national touring bands similarly reduced. Towards the end of the 80’s the club had played host to Sierra Leonian performer, S. E. Rogie, on several memorable occasions, and these gigs became increasingly popular. The opportunity to present more World Music events came about in the early 90’s and helped to fill the ‘vacuum’ created by the reduced number of Indie gigs at the club. These concerts, which have featured wildly diverse music from across the globe, have come to be a significant feature of the club’s output over the years since and offers a unique cultural opportunity to the city and local region. The Adelphi has rightly become very proud of its associations with these highly talented and respected musicians, and the performers themselves, correspondingly, have developed a close affinity with, and respect for, Paul and the Adelphi. Paul reflects:\n\n“We have been doing World Music for over 12 years now. A pretty comprehensive coverage of the various music genres and countries of Africa, throat singers from the Tuva province of Siberia, bands from Cuba, Brazil, India, Morocco, Torres Strait Islands, alongside much from Europe and North America. We love it and they invariably seem to love us too, which is just as well as I always seem to be massively out of pocket afterwards. Perhaps in another world I would have travelled, and this is just me bringing the world to the Adelphi in the absence of those opportunities. Perhaps it is alternately an integral part of the unique cultural agenda of the Adelphi, which works, and which is constantly regenerating itself. Yes, I enjoy bringing the world to Hull. I enjoy it when the world enjoys what it finds here, and when Hull folk enjoy what they find there through music. I enjoy it when the various ethnic communities of Hull interact with each other in peace and harmony and I like it when the world feels just a little bit smaller, and Hull just a little less claustrophobic. I like a room full of different coloured smiles, and friendship, and dancing and sweat running down the walls. When these shows work, as they invariably do, I see them as a cathartic celebration of our humanity. I love them.” (Paul Jackson)\n\n“I’d never even considered I would hear such things except for being taught the shite that they pass off as World Music in schools. Here it was, in the flesh. A room full of people with different backgrounds and bands that couldn’t even speak the same language as them. The only way of communicating they had was song, dance, sweat, smiles and love.” (Matt Edible, bar staff, ex-Edible 5ft Smiths)\n\n“The Adelphi has always been a great purveyor of World Music nights and I have seen some great gigs there, Ifang Bondi for one was a wonderful experience – beautiful spiritually infused Kora music underpinned with rump shaking African percussion. It was completely different music from a different continent and its natural intelligence was spellbinding.” (Mark Young, aka Third Face, Full Cycle Records)\n\n“One special moment which always springs to mind was seeing the West African band, Ifang Bondi. They came with an array of traditional Gambian instruments which they’d hand-crafted themselves and played an amazing gig. For the duration of the night, each member of the band wore the biggest, beaming smiles, which just spread through the crowd, creating the most amazing atmosphere. In any other venue, with a bigger hall or stage, the intimacy that made this atmosphere would have been lost, and that’s the beauty of the Adelphi’s dimensions.” (Lewis McNeill)\n\n“I particularly have loved the African bands, especially some of the East African guitar-based bands, often at least eight or nine musicians who know how to make the most of the intimate atmosphere and get a real thing going with the audience. The Adelphi is transformed into a frenzy of dancing and grinning! There was one band, Bozi Boziana and Anti-Shock, who had about fourteen band members, including five part harmonies and four dancers – that was another electric evening.” (Frankie Banham, Mambo Jambo)\n\n“Thomas Mapfumo‘s first gig was booked at only 8 days notice, so Jacko couldn’t publicise it properly. The place was still packed out, just on word of mouth.” (Andy Hodgson)\n\n“There have been times when I’ve felt quite culturally isolated in Hull. Somehow, the Adelphi has come to the rescue with the most amazing acts from all over the world. Nights where EVERYONE would dance the night away, and then take the long walk home, shivering as the sweat cooled, but with the memory of the night’s performances still firing up the imagination.” (Audrey, ex-Back to Base)\n\n“Yat-kha, some Russian throat singers, came on stage and as soon as they started I was rooted to the spot in awe. Big bears of men that looked like a cross between Eskimos, Triads and rockers, making the weirdest and most amazing sounds that I have ever heard. Think growl/belch/gargle (unbroken for minutes at a time, who knows how these guys breathe) accompanied by traditional instruments, but actually making a danceable rock sound. You could tell that they felt right at home.” (Dr Cath"
