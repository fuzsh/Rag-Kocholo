        "text": "Today is Zhong He Jie in China. What is that you ask?\n\nIt is Blue Dragon Festival. Zhong He Jie is celebrated on the second day of the second lunar month on the Chinese calendar which this year is TODAY. It is sometimes called “2 Month 2”, (Er Yue Er, 二月二) for short. In Chinese culture tradition the dragon is believed to be the king of all insects and is also believed to be in charge of bringing rains(oops, we got snow this year) Both of these are important factors in Chinese agriculture. So… Zhong He Jie is an important tradition of wishing for good harvest in the coming months. Zhong He day is celebrated by eating Chinese “fajitas” known as Chun Bing ” spring pancakes”and noodles. I think it’s kinda like our Pancake day in Canada, although I did some research and Chun Bing is really more like wraps and fajitas than pancakes.\n\nAnother name for Zhong He is also called “Dragon Raising Its Head”. A really interesting thing about Zhong He Jie is that many Chinese believe it is “good luck” to get your hair cut on this day! Zhēn de ma? Haha, I love learning about Chinese culture and tradition!\n\nToo bad David got his cut last week! Happy Zhong He Jie!"
