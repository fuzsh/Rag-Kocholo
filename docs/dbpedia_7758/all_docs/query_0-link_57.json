Zhu Yongpeng, “New Energy Sources.”\n\n3. Fravel, Active Defense, 66–68. Fravel points out that the Communist Party established control over the army after the Gutian Conference in 1929. The understanding of the people’s war was modified to include the mass mobilization of China’s population and resources in the event of armed conflict.\n\n4. Kasza, The Conscription Society, 1.\n\n5.

See also Suehiro, Catch-up Industrialization. Suehiro argues that economically backward countries can achieve compressed development by importing existing technologies of industrialized nations through import substitution, thus short-circuiting the costly R&D process. Suehiro, however, notes that the recipient nation simply follows the path of early adopters of technology and precludes the possibility of late adopters leapfrogging advanced nations.\n\n8.

Seow, “Carbon Technocracy,” 8. Seow understands technocracy as “involving interrelated ideas about the unquestionable superiority of the scientific method in framing and solving problems of society, and the necessity for central directives and state planning to bring that method to bear on problems.” The engineer-bureaucrats featured in this study recognize the limits of scientific methods. They see the rational mindset of profit-optimizing electrical utilities as an impediment to the equitable distribution of electrical power. The “technocracy” that emerges in chapter 7 of this study does not reflect the preeminence of “scientific rationality” but results from scientific experts relinquishing control over power production decisions to party cadres.\n\n16. Yun Zhen, “Yun Zhen zizhuan” [Autobiography of Yun Zhen], February 19, 1944, 129–000000–087A, AH, New Taipei City, Taiwan. The autobiography is filed with the intelligence reports of Chiang Kai Shek’s aide-de-camp. Chiang’s closest aides screened the engineers of the National Resources Commission (NRC) for their political views and monitored their performance in the party education camps.\n\n17. Dodgen, Controlling the Dragon, 7.\n\n18. Elvin, “Three Thousand Years of Unsustainable Growth,” 38.\n\n19. A resurgence in scholarship about the NRC appeared around the early 2000s, as China experts became interested in the dominance of state-owned enterprises. An example of this work is Cheng Linsun, “Zhongguo jihua jingji.” The most comprehensive English-language monograph on the legacy of NRC’s wartime industrialization is Morris Bian’s The Making of the State Enterprise System in Modern China.\n\n20. Survey histories of China’s electrical industries in the Chinese language are collective scholarly endeavors completed with state sponsorship. Examples include Li Daigeng, Xin Zhongguo dianli gongye fazhan shilue; Huang Xi, Zhongguo jinxiandai dianli jishu fazhan shi. Li Daigeng was deputy minister of water resources and electrical power. He thus emphasized the achievements of post-1949 China. Huang Xi’s work largely repeats many of the insights from earlier state-sponsored histories and draws heavily from Li’s earlier work. Huang was diagnosed with cancer and suffered a stroke shortly after completing the manuscript in 2002.\n\n21. R. Bin Wong points out that Chinese and Western scholarship offer different interpretations of the impact of foreigners on the Chinese economy. Chinese Marxists see that “imperialism twisted and distorted China’s path of development,” while Western-trained scholars emphasize that “foreigners created the opportunities and offered the skills and techniques to build a modern economy in China.” See Wong, China Transformed, 21.\n\n22.

The International Library of Technology textbook on cotton milling states that cotton yarn is “divided into coarse, medium, and fine, according to the thickness of the thread, which in turn is determined by the number of hanks to the pound. A hank of cotton yard contains 840 yards, and the size of the yarn is indicated by the number of hanks required to weigh one pound; thus 10s yarn would contain ten hanks, or 10 × 840 yards, making 8,400 yards, in a pound.” There is also no rule that defines which yarn is coarse, medium, or fine. As a rule of thumb, anything below 30s is considered coarse.\n\n42. He Da, “Miansha fangzhi.”\n\n43. Li Shizhong, “Fangzhi yuanliao,” 6.

This could not have been the case, as the diesel generator at the French Concession Power Station was 15,000 kW. There were another 107 diesel-powered generators.

Zimmerman explains that the rate-base rule had been established in 1898 after disputes over railway freight pricing. The public believed that railway companies had set exorbitant rates based on fictitious capitalization. The Supreme Court ruled that return to value had to be calculated based on the present value of the property rather than the investment on the business. This was later extended in 1907 over gas and electric utilities.\n\n66. World Power Conference, Transactions Third World Power Conference, vol. 4, 668.\n\n67.

The construction cost of hydropower, calculated in terms of average cost per kWh, is 100 CNC dollars higher than coal-fired plants. Interest and depreciation of the hydropower dams came up to 12 CNC dollars per kWh. The average cost per kWh for coal-fired power is two CNC dollars.\n\n4. Hughes, Networks of Power, 286.\n\n5.

In his autobiography republished in Zhang Baichun’s volume, Yun Zhen described how the technology transfer for field telephones was complicated by domestic politics and increasing tensions in Sino-German relations. He recalled that T. V. Soong, then the managing director of the Central Bank of China, had personal connections to the Chicago Telephone Company and pressured the deputy minister for the NRC Qian Changzhao to purchase the patents from the Americans. The first shipment of German field telephones, which served as the models for the telephones to be assembled by the NRC, nearly did not make it to China. Unable to receive the shipments in the port of Haiphong, as the colonial government in French Indo-China imposed an embargo on German goods by 1938, the Electrical Works diverted the shipment to their temporary assembly facility in the British colony of Hong Kong. The manufacturing operation was transferred to Kunming in early 1939.\n\n24. Xu Yingqi, “Zhongyang diangong,” 22.\n\n25. Xiangtan dianji changzhi bianzuan weiyuanhui, Xiangtan dianji changzhi.

According to the March 1946 addendum, the Pauley mission did not directly observe all the removals by the Soviets. The mission’s coverage was also limited, as it omitted a number of power stations amounting to a generating capacity of 404,000 kW in their initial calculations. The extent of Soviet removals is unclear. Robert Carin’s 1964 report underestimated the prewar generating levels and concluded that Soviet removals led to a 26.7 percent drop in generating capacity.

The biographies of these industrialists were published in the Dagongbao newspaper and Xin Zhonghua semi-monthly magazine of the Zhonghua bookstore and circulated widely.

Senior engineers like Yun Zhen and Bao Guobao participated in the Guomindang’s political indoctrination camps during the War of Anti-Japanese Resistance before they were posted to the United States. The writings and political assessments of these senior engineers were filed with the papers of the Attendants Office of the Guomindang Military Commission. They were vetted by Chiang’s personal secretaries, thus indicating that the Guomindang made a concerted effort to influence their political leanings. The folders of the engineers who remained in the mainland were stamped with the label “toufei” (defected to the Communist bandits). The National Security Bureau on Taiwan also tried to gather information about these defected engineers but only managed to gather newspaper clippings and biographical dictionary entries.\n\n62.

His execution, like that of Palchinsky, is a “cautionary tale about the fate of engineering that disregards social and human issues.” Graham also notes that the execution of Palchinsky caused Soviet engineers to steer away from economic and social questions and continue to focus on narrow technical tasks. In February 2018, the Control Yuan opened an investigation into Liu Jinyu’s case as an act of restorative justice, recognizing Liu as a victim of white terror.\n\n84.

In March 1955, the PRC readjusted the value of the Renminbi (RMB) at a conversion rate of 10,000 to 1. The “250 million” donation by the workers was only worth RMB 25,000 in 1955 dollar terms. This was a small amount of money. Back in 1951, the cost of 1 kWh of electricity was 55 RMB (old) and the power station generated 2.4 million kWh of electricity daily. (Figures from Shanghai dianli gongyezhi, 44.) The donation was equivalent to two days of Shanghai Power Station’s revenue.\n\n19.
