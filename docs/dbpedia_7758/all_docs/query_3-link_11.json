Calendars are also used to determine days of festivities or natural events (like solar eclipses), and to prognosticate auspicious or non-auspicious days. The calendars of all cultures are based on astronomical phenomena like the movement of the moon, the âmovementâ of the sun, and those of planets and starry constellations. The traditional Chinese calendar is a combination of a solar calendar (based on the âpositionâ of the sun and the resultant seasonal phenomena) and a lunar calendar (following the lunar phases).\n\nThe \"peasant calendar\" (nongli è¾²æ), also called \"old calendar\" (jiuli èæ) or \"Chinese calendar\" (Zhongli ä¸­æ) is the traditional calendar used in China before the official introduction of the Western calendar in 1912. It is still widely used among the people, especially in Hong Kong, Taiwan and among Chinese overseas communities, mainly for traditional holidays and festivities, and for the determination of auspicious days and hours. The peasant calendar divides the year into 24 so-called solar terms (ershisi jieqi äºååç¯æ°£) whose names indicate agricultural activities and the phaenology of the nature like daxue å¤§éª \"Heavy snow\", shuangjiang éé \"Hoar frost descends\", or Jingzhe é©è \"Excited insects\". This traditional calendar is allegedly in use since the Xia period å¤ (17th-15th cent. BCE), and therefore also called the \"Xia calendar\" (Xiali å¤æ). The oldest records on the Chinese calendar are to be found in the book Xia xiaozheng å¤å°æ­£. Because of the great importance of the moon for the calculation of this calendar, it is also known under the name of \"Yin, i.e. moon or lunar, calendar\" (yinli é°æ). The course of the months is stringently geared to the new moon phase, and therefore it is necessary to make from time to time use of an intercalary month (runyue éæ) to cover the leap to the solar calendar that increments in the course of time. A year with an intercalary month is called runnian éå¹´. The \"peasant calendar\" is therefore in fact a luni-solar calendar (modern term yinyangli é°é½æ), and not a purely lunar calendar.\n\nThe first month is called zhÄngyuÃ¨ (!) æ­£æ, but the other months are given regular numbers, like eryue äºæ \"second month\", sanyue ä¸æ \"third month\", and to son. Each month begins at midnight on the day when the lunar path (baijing ç½ç¶) and the solar path (huangjing é»ç¶) fall together. This day is called the \"first day\" (chuyi åä¸), the second chu'er åäº, the third chusan åä¸, and so on, but from the tenth day on the syllable chu is dropped and instead the word ri \"day\" is added, like shiri åæ¥ \"the tenth\", shiyiri åä¸æ¥ \"the eleventh\". There are \"long months\" (dayue å¤§æ) with a length of 30 days, and \"small months\" (xiaoyue å°æ) with a length of 29 days, in such a combination over the year that the real length of a month of 29.53059 days is met on average. This results in a length of the lunar year of 354 of 355 days, which makes for a leap of around between 10 and 12 days to the solar year.\n\nAn intercalary month has therefore to be inserted alternately all two or three years, which makes for an average (called runzhou éå¨ \"intercalary cycle\") of seven intercalary months (called zhangrun ç« é \"full set of intercalary months\") in a period of 19 years (zhangsui ç« æ­² \"full set of years\"). This is because the length of 19 years is very close to the exact length of 235 lunar months, as already observed in the Four-Parts Calendar (sifen li ååæ) from the Warring States period æ°å (5th cent.-221 BCE) . At which time in the year an intercalary month is inserted, depends on the 24 solar terms and the general conditions to be expected during that time. Unlike in the Western calendar, where the intercalary day is always February 29th, the Chinese lunar calendars knows intercalary months throughout the year (except months during which the so-called zhongqi ä¸­æ°£ solar terms occur: yushui é¨æ°´, chunfen æ¥å, guyu ç©é¨, xiaoman å°æ»¿, xiazhi å¤è³, dashu å¤§æ, chushu èæ, qiufen ç§å, shuangjiang éé, xiaoxue å°éª, dongzhi å¬è³, and dahan å¤§å¯), for instance, the \"intercalary (month after the) third month\" (run sanyue éä¸æ). The ancient \"intercalary cycle\" method was still not very perfect, and was therefore ameliorated by Zhao Fei è¶{é+æ¬ } who lived in the small empire of Northern Liang åæ¶¼ (398-439) during the Sixteen States period åå ­å (300~430) and defined the intercalary cycle as 221 intercalary months in 600 years. Zu Chongzhi ç¥æ²ä¹ of the Liu-Song period åå® (420-479) used a relationship of 144 intercalary months in 391 years, which is more accurate that the method of Zhao Fei. Li Chunfeng's ææ·³é¢¨ Linde Calendar éºå¾·æ from the Linde reign-period éºå¾· (664-665) of the Tang period å (618-907) was the last calendar in which the intercalary cycle had to be fixed anew.\n\nThe beginning of the first month of the traditional peasant calendar is oriented towards the winter solstice, that is the date on which the day is shortest and the night longest (December 21 according to the Western Calendar). The New Year's Day (yuandan å æ¦) of the traditional Chinese calendar was (and is), the day of the second newmoon following the winter solstice. The oldest calendar of China was the so-called Xia calendar å¤æ. During the Xia period the beginning of the year was on the first day of the first month (zhengyue chuyi æ­£æåä¸), during the Shang period å (17th-11th cent. BCE) the first day of the twelfth month of the Xia calendar, during the Zhou period å¨ (11th cent.-221 BCE) on the first day of the eleventh month of the Xia calendar, and during the Qin ç§¦ (221-206 BCE) and the early Han æ¼¢ (206 BCE-220 CE), on the first day of the tenth month. During the calendar reform (the introduction of the Taichu calendar å¤ªåæ) under Emperor Wu æ¼¢æ­¦å¸ (r. 141-87 BCE) of the Han dynasty the beginning of the calendric year was shifted back to the first day of the first month of the Xia calendar, which is valid until today.\n\nSources:\n\nChen Jiujin é³ä¹ é (1980). \"Runzhou éå¨\", in Zhongguo da baike quanshu ä¸­åå¤§ç¾ç§å ¨æ¸, Tianwenxue å¤©æå­¸ (Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe), 277.\n\nLi Nengyao æè½è (1980). \"Nongli è¾²æ\", in Zhongguo da baike quanshu ä¸­åå¤§ç¾ç§å ¨æ¸, Tianwenxue å¤©æå­¸ (Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe), 244.\n\nChronology\n\nTime is measured with the help of several methods. Besides units also known in the Western calendar (seasons, months, weeks and hours), the traditional Chinese calendar makes use of several more concepts, namely the 24 solar terms (ershisi jieqi äºååç¯æ°£), the sexagenarian cycle (a combination of the ten signs or characters called Celestial Stems and the twelve signs known as Terrestrial Branches), and the Jupiter year.\n\nDynasties\n\nIn Western historiography the history of mankind (which begins with the existence of written sources) is divided into the three ages of Antiquity (ca. 600 BCEâ600 CE), the Middle Ages (ca. 600â1500), and the Modern Age. Marxist theoreticians divided history into the age of the slaveholder society (corresponding to Antiquity), the age of feudalism (ca. 600-1750), and the age of capitalism. This socio-economical approach is also important for the People's Republic of China where Marxist theoreticians had and still have problems to transfer this model on Chinese history. They see the end of the age of feudalism in the Xinhai Revolution è¾äº¥é©å½ from 1911 and the phase of capitalism from 1912 to the \"liberation\" of 1949. A similar tripartite timeline like the Antiquity-Middle Age-Modern Age model which pretends a kind of intellectual and scientific progress, does not exist in traditional Chinese historiography. Western sinologists see the Chinese age of Antiquity (the \"Golden Age\" that served as a model for later times) as the time from 1200 BCE to ca. 300 CE, that of the Middle Ages (the \"Dark Age\" of equestrian warriors) from 300-900 CE, and the Modern Age (with a great progress in technology and fundamental changes in the social structure) as beginning with the Song dynasty.\n\nInstead, history was in China traditionally divided into dynastic cycles, in which a ruling family or dynasty sees its rise and victory over a predecessor (mostly because of its military, but also moral superiority, and therefore being selected as \"sons of Heaven\", see Heaven), an apogee of cultural, economic and military (seen in territorial expansion) success, and a downfall due to corruption among the officialdom and depravity of the ruling house. The concept of the dynastic cycle focuses on the political history of the dynasty itself and neglects factual changes in the power structure, the administrative system, society, economy and the material and intellectual culture. Chinese history therefore seems to be an everlasting \"revolution\" (in the astronomical sense) of ups and downs of ruling families that sometimes were able to unify the whole territory of China, and sometimes failed to do so, with the result that China was divided into several empires or states. Still today, biographies persons begin with an indication of the dynasty under which he or she lived.\n\nWhile the Egyptian dynasties are counted with numbers, the Chinese dynasties are given names. Most of these names are derived from a territory over which a dynastic founder was the master before becoming emperor. The name of the Han dynasty æ¼¢ (206 BCE-220 CE), for instance, is derived from the name of a river in a region (Hanzhong æ¼¢ä¸­) over which Liu Bang åé¦, the dynastic founder, was made king. Similarly, the Wei dynasty é­ (220-265) has its name derived from the kingdom of Wei, over which Cao Cao æ¹æ, the father of the first emperor of the dynasty (Cao Pi æ¹ä¸), had ruled. The names of the dynasties (chao æ, literally \"the place to be faced\", i.e. the court) are at the same time the name of their empire (guo å). The Han dynasty (Han chao æ¼¢æ) ruled over the Han empire, and the Tang dynasty å (618-907) over the Tang empire. Through history, therefore, \"China\" was known with many different names, changing with the access of a new dynasty. The Japanese even continued to name China \"Tang\" (TÅ) after the downfall of that dynasty. The last three imperial dynasties named themselves with mottos, namely Yuan å  (1279-1368) \"the (new) Origin\", Ming æ (1368-1644) \"the Brilliant\", and Qing æ¸ (1644-1911) \"the Pure\".\n\nThere are not a few cases in which fresh emperors chose a name for their dynasty that had already been used. In order to discern these dynasties and their empires, historians used suffixes (like geographic terms, time words, or family names), like the Southern Qi åé½ (479-502) and the Northern Qi åé½ (550-577), the Liu-Song åå® (420-479) and the (Great) Song å® (960-1279), the Cao-Wei æ¹é­ and the Later å¾é­ or Northern Wei åé­ (386-534). These suffixes are also used to discern between distinctive phases in a dynasty's life cycle, like Western Zhou è¥¿å¨ (11th cent.-770 BCE) and Eastern Zhou æ±å¨ (770-221 BCE), Western è¥¿æ¼¢ or Former Han åæ¼¢ (206 BCE-8 CE) and Eastern æ±æ¼¢ or Later Han å¾æ¼¢ (25-220 CE), Western è¥¿æ (265-316) and Eastern Jin æ±æ (317-420), Northern Song åå® (960-1126) and Southern Song åå® (1127-1279). In all these cases, the dynasty had been forced to move its capital to another place as a consequence of a drastic political incidence (invasion by \"barbarians\" or re-founding of the dynasty after inner turmoils).\n\nThe name of the dynasty is (unlike in Europe, like Tudor, Bourbon or Hapsburg) not identical to the family name of the ruling house (the family Liu å constituted the Han dynasty, the family Li æ the Tang, and the rulers of the Song dynasty had the family name Zhao è¶). The only exception is the short-lived Chen dynasty é³ (557-589), whose founder had the family name Chen, but the name of the dynasty has been chosen because its founder Chen Baxian é³é¸å  had been king of Chen before adoptiong the title of emperor. The names of the dynasties are also used to designate the time during which they ruled. The Han ruled during the Han period (Han dai æ¼¢ä»£), and the Qing during the Qing period (Qing dai æ¸ ä»£).\n\nThis method is problematic during those times during which several dynasties shared \"China\" among themselves. During the Three Empires period ä¸å (220-280), for instance, the three dynasties Wei, Shu è (221-263) and Wu å³ (222-280) were ruling simultaneously over different parts of \"China\". It is therefore not appropriate to speak of the Wu period or the Shu period. Historians disputed about which of the three dynasties was the righteous successor of the Han, and chose the Wei dynasty. The Three Empires period can therefore be identical with the Wei period, but the Wei dynasty was ended before the last of the Three Empires, Wu, was conquered by the Wei's successor, the Jin dynasty. Similar instances or parallel ruling houses are the Southern and Northern dynasties period ååæ (300~600, with a group of dynasties following each other in the south, and several realms in the north that ruled over different parts of northern China), the Five Dynasties period äºä»£ (907-960, with five dynasties ruling consecutively over the north and ten states ruling over various parts of southern China), and the Song period. The Song period is actually an exception from the former cases because the Song ruled only over central and southern China, while the north was occupied by the Liao empire é¼ (907-1125), and then the Jin empire é (1115-1234), and the northwest by the Western Xia empire è¥¿å¤ (1038-1227). There is no overarching term for this period of time like \"Southern and Northern Dynasties\". The three dynasties ruling over the north were of non-Chinese origin (Khitans, Jurchens and Tanguts), just like the Yuan dynasty that was founded by the Mongols and ruled over the whole of China.\n\nReign-Periods\n\nBecause there is no fix year in Chinese history to which the calendar is related to (like the birth year of Jesus Christ, Mohammed's escape of Medinah, or the \"creation of the world\"), the actual ordinal year of an emperor's reign (the reign-period or era) or that of his reign mottos (nianhao å¹´è) were used to indicate a year. Before and in the first decades of the Han period æ¼¢ (206 BCE-220 CE), there were still no reign mottos. Years were therefore indicated by the length of a ruler's reign, like Jingwang shisan nian æ¬çåä¸å¹´ \"thirteenth year of King Jing's (the king of Zhou, r. 520-476 BCE) reign\", or Wendi san nian æå¸ä¸å¹´ \"third year of Emperor Wen's (emperor of the Han dynasty, r. 180-157 BCE) reign\". It is important to note that the first year of a reign-period was not that in which the emperor acceded to the throne, but the next one, after the first New Year had passed. This was an expression of filial piety towards the late king or emperor. King Jing of the Zhou dynasty, for instance, acceded to the throne in 520 BCE, but his first year of reign (Jingwang yuannian æ¬çå å¹´) was 519 BCE. The first year of a reign or reign-period (period under a certain motto) is called yuannian å å¹´, the others are regularly counted (ernian äºå¹´, sannian ä¸å¹´ etc.).\n\nThe first introduction of a new reign era was inaugurated in 163 BCE under Emperor Wen æ¼¢æå¸ (r. 180-157 BCE) who declared this year as Houyuan yuannian å¾å å å¹´ \"First year of the later Origin\". His successor, Emperor Jing æ¼¢æ¯å¸ (r. 157-141 BCE), inaugurated two new reigns, Zhongyuan ä¸­å  \"Middle Origin\" (this name might have been given retrospectively) in 149 BCE, and Houyuan å¾å  \"Later Origin\" in 143 BCE. His son, Emperor Wu æ¼¢æ­¦å¸ (r. 141-87 BCE), was the first who chose a motto for the first full year of his reign, namely Jianyuan å»ºå  \"Establishment of a (new) origin\", in 140 BCE. Six years later he chose the reign motto Yuanguang å å  \"Brilliance of the origin\", which lasted for another six years. Emperor Wu's reign mottos were also the first whose names had a meaningful slogan. During his whole reign from 141 to 87 BCE he made use of eleven reign mottos. From then on all emperors made use of reign mottos, and even usurpers or counter-emperors used to proclaim a reign under new auspices. Liu Yu åè±«, Emperor of Qi é½ (r. 1130-1137), for instance, chose the motto Fuchang éæ \"Brilliance of Qufu æ²é\" (Qufu was the home town of Confucius that was located in Liu Yu's small empire), and the usurper Li Zicheng æèªæ, who proclaimed himself Emperor of Dashun å¤§é  (r. 1644-1645), the motto Yongchang æ°¸æ \"Everlasting brightness\". President Yuan Shikai è¢ä¸å± made himself emperor on January 1, 1916 (forced to resign on April 24) and chose the reign motto Hongxian æ´ªæ² \"All-Embracing Constitution\".\n\nMost reign mottos are two syllables or words long, but during the Song period å® (960-1279) some four-syllable mottos were chosen like Taiping xingguo å¤ªå¹³èå \"Flourishing of the State under the Great Peace\" (976-983), Dazhong xiangfu å¤§ä¸­ç¥¥ç¬¦ \"Auspicious Omen of the Great Centre\" (1008-1016) or Jianzhong jingguo å»ºä¸­éå \"Pacified State Established in the Middle\" (1101). Some mottos were fashionable during certain times, like the words chun æ·³ \"pure\" and you ç¥ \"heavenly assistance\" that are almost exlusively used by the Song dynasty.\n\nTo make identification by a reign motto easier, the mottos were rarely used more than once through Chinese history. Yet there are some exception, like the motto Yong'an æ°¸å® \"Everlasting Peace\" that was used by the Wu dynasty å³ (258-263), the Jin dynasty æ (304), the statelet of Northern Liang åæ¶¼ (401-411), the Northern Wei dynasty åé­ (528-529) and the Western Xia è¥¿å¤ (1098-1100).\n\nThere are two basic problems with this method. The first is that if a ruler was not accepted as the legal sovereign or during times of political division, several mottos (and therefore also different calendars with different years) were used at the same time. During the Eastern Zhou period æ±å¨ (770-221 BCE) it was not only the king of Zhou who ruled by his own calendar, but each of the regional rulers counted the length of his own rule as an instrument of measuring years. This makes it very complicate to identify a year during that time, and leads easily to errors. One example might highlight this complexity.\n\nThe Western year 477 BCE was the ...\n\n43th year of King Jing of Zhou å¨æ¬ç 16th year of Duke Ai of Lu é­¯åå ¬ 4th year of Duke Ping of Qi é½å¹³å ¬ 35th year of Duke Ding of Jin æå®å ¬ 14th year of Duke Dao of Qin ç§¦æ¼å ¬ 12th year of King Hui of Chu æ¥æ ç 40th year of Duke Jing of Song å®æ¯å ¬ 1st year of Lord Qi of Wei è¡åèµ· 14th year of Marquis Cheng of Cai è¡æä¾¯ 24th year of Duke Sheng of Zheng é­è²å ¬ 16th year of Duke Xian of Yan çç»å ¬ the 19th year of King Fucha of Wu å³çå¤«å·®\n\nSimilar, but less extreme cases occurred during the Three Empires period ä¸å (220-280), the Southern and Northern Dynasties ååæ (300~600) period, the Five Dynasties period äºä»£ (907-960), and the period of the Song å® (960-1279), Liao é¼ (907-1125) and Jin é (1115-1234) dynasties.\n\nTable xx.

The change of a reign motto is indicated by the word gaiyuan æ¹å  \"change to a new first year\". Such a change could be made during the course of a year and was sometimes effected just in the middle of a current year, and not necessarily with the beginning of a new calendric year. Empress Wu Zetian æ­¦åå¤© (r. 684-690) was most notorious for this practice because reign mottos, expressing a style of rule or an auspicious omen supporting the reign, played an important role in her legitimization. Yet also other rulers used to play this game. On the day eryue yimao äºæä¹æª ([30th day of the] second month, with the cyclical signs yi and mao) of the sixth year of the Xianqing reign-period é¡¯æ ¶ (i. e. April 4, 661 CE) Emperor Gaozong åé«å® (r. 649-683) changed the reign motto to Longshuo é¾æ, and the first year of this reign began on sanyue bingshen ä¸æä¸ç³ ([1st day of the] third month, with the cyclical signs bing and shen), with the new moon. During his more than thirty-years-long reign he changed his motto no less than fourteen times, and Empress Wu Zetian, who was factual emperor for slightly less than five years, had four reign mottos, on average one for each year. The opposite paradigm was Emperor Xuanzong åçå® (r. 711-755), who ruled even longer, but only proclaimed three reign mottos, the longest, Kaiyuan éå  (713-741), lasting for 29 years.\n\nFrom the Ming period on there were only very few occasions that the reign motto was changed by one emperor. Emperor Yingzong æè±å® (r. 1435-1449) of the Ming chose a new motto when he came back to the throne in 1456; and Huang Taiji, the khan of the Jurchens, who had two mottos, the second of which was chosen in 1636 because he renamed his dynasty from (Later) Jin å¾é to Qing æ¸ (1644-1911). During the Ming and Qing periods each emperor had practically only one reign motto. For this reason the emperors of these two dynasties are usually not called with their posthumous title (like Wendi æå¸ or Wudi æ­¦å¸) or their temple name (like Taizong å¤ªå® or Taizu å¤ªç¥), but with their reign motto (e.g. the Wanli Emperor è¬æå¸, the Guangxu Emperor å ç·å¸). Among these, the Jiajing Emperor åéå¸ (r. 1521-1566) ruled for 45 years, the Wanli Emperor for 48 years, the Kangxi Emperor åº·çå¸ (r. 1661-1722) for 61 years, and the Qianlong Emperor ä¹¾éå¸ (r. 1735-1796) for 60 years. In Western literature, the era names are often used to refer to emperor, like \"Emperor Kangxi\". Reign periods were sometimes abbreviated and joint to expressions signifying two or three reign-period, like Kang-Yong-Qian åº·éä¹¾ for the reign-periods Kangxi, Yongzheng éæ­£ (1723-1735), and Qianlong, or Dao-Xian éå¸ for the the decades of the reign-periods Daoguang éå  (1821-1850) and Xianfeng å¸è± (1851-1861).\n\nA particular problem with chronology is that the first reign motto of a sovereign was only chosen for the new year after the accession of the throne, as an expression of piety towards the predecessor. This means that Kaiyuan yuannian éå å å¹´ (year 713 CE) was the first year with the reign motto Kaiyuan \"Opening the Origin\", but already the second calendric year in which Emperor Xuanzong åçå® (r. 712-755) of the Tang ruled. For the Qing period, this means that the Kangxi reign-period lasted from xxx 1662 to 1722, but the Kangxi Emperor ruled from 5 Feb 1661 to 20 Dec 1722.\n\nTo make things even more complex, the New Year begins in China according to the lunar calendar which is somewhat later than in the Western calendar. The four to eight weeks of difference in the beginning of the year have to be taken into account when converting traditional Chinese years into Western years. It is therefore not quite correct to say that the year Yongzheng yimao éæ­£ä¹å¯ was 1735 (the 13th year of the Yongzheng reign-period, with the cyclical signs yi and mao), but the year yimao (and the 13th year with the reign motto Yongzheng) reached from 24 Jan 1735 to 11 Feb 1736, while the Yongzheng Emperor had already died on October 8, 1735, and his son took over official functions on October 16, the first day of the ninth lunar month. For the reason of convenience, this small overlapping of the Western and Chinese calendar is often neglected when indicating years only, even if this leads to errors in dates.\n\nThis can be very confusing because one year can be referred to by several different reign mottos, like the year 692 that was the third year with the reign motto Tianshou å¤©æ \"Celestial instruction\", yet in the fourth month (approx. May-Jun) the reign motto Ruyi å¦æ \"As we wish\" was chosen, and in the ninth month (approx. Oct-Nov) the motto Changshou é·å£½ \"Longevity\". Similarly confusing is a period of time when several dynasties reigned China. The year 1066, for example, was the third year with the reign motto Zhiping æ²»å¹³ \"Ruling to peace\" in the Northern Song empire, the second year with the reign motto Xianyong å¸é \"Everything in harmony\" in the Liao empire and the fourth year with the reign motto Gonghua æ±å \"Towards an all-embracing [policy]\" in the Western Xia empire. The change of the reign motto was called gaiyuan æ¹å  \"change over to a (new) beginning\". When a new emperor mounted the throne it was common that the reign motto of his predecessor (in most cases, the new emperor's father) was retained until the first day of the next year. Such a proclamation was often combined with a great amnesty (dashe å¤§èµ¦).\n\nThe counting of years by reign mottos was also known in Vietnam and is still in use in Japan (because it is the only one of the East Asian countries where still an emperor exists). The reign motto of the retired Japanese emperor Akihito æä» (r. 1989-2019) was Heisei å¹³æ \"Outbalanced Completion\", and Báº£o Äáº¡i ä¿å¤§ \"Protection of Grandness\" (1926-1945) was the reign motto of the last emperor of Vietnam (while his personal name was Nguyá» n PhÃºc Thiá»n é®ç¦æª). The Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty chose two reign mottos, one in Chinese, and one in Manchurian. The names are not in all cases literal translations of each other. XXX\n\nAfter the foundation of the Republic in late 1911 it was decided to rename the year 1912 into the first year of the Republic (Minguo yuannian æ°åå å¹´). With this decision, the traditional Chinese method of counting years was retained, while the official luni-solar calendar itself was replaced by the Western calendar, at least in public. After 1949, the Republican government in Taiwan retained the \"reign-motto\" method and still uses it today, side by side with the Western year.\n\nReign mottos are also inscribed on coins, instead of using the idealized portraits of rulers, like in the West. A common inscription of a very common and widespread coins was, for instance, Kaiyuan tongbao éå éå¯¶ \"Circulating wealth from the Kaiyuan reign-period (713-741)\".\n\nYears\n\nThe beginning of time periods in the Chinese calendar is always tied to the new moon (shuo æ). Each month in the lunar calendar thus begins with a new moon (black and invisible), just like the year begins at the point of time when Yin (inactive, hidden, dark) prevails over nature. The problem for ancient astronomers was that the velocity of the moon on its path around the earth is not constant (like all celestial bodies, the moon follows an elliptic path on which it moves quicker in the parts of its orbit that are closer to the earth) and therefore the length of time between one new moon and the next are not exactly the same. A long-term middle value of this length is called the \"lunar month\" (shuowangyue æææ) or \"leveled month\" (pingshuo å¹³æ), and the calculation method is called \"fixing (the date of the) new moon\" (dingshuo å®æ). xxx\n\nTable x.

The cycle of these years is independant from historical events and runs permanently.\n\nEach year bears the designation of a combination of two cyclical signs, namely the 10 Celestial Stems (shi tiangan åå¤©å¹²) of the Ten-Years Cycle and the 12 Terrestrial Branches (shi'er dizhi åäºå°æ¯) which are combined to a cycle of 60 (with only the first half of all possible combinations used). In popular belief each year represents one of twelve animals, whose character is ascribed to all persons born in that year. This \"zodiac\" (which has nothing to do with starry constellations like in the West) is connected to the twelve Terrestrial Branches, which are always in the second position of the cyclical combination. This means that all years with the cyclical combinations jiazi ç²å­, bingzi ä¸å­, wuzi æå­, gengzi åºå­, and renzi å£¬å­ are \"years of the rat\". There are many helpful tools in the internet to show which year corresponds to which animal. In translations the animal cycle is often preferred because it is easier to comprehend for a Westerner than a detailed explanation of the the clumsy combination of the two stem and branches cycles.\n\nTable x+1.

The Branches are combined with the Ten Stems to a cycle of sixty years. While the Ten Stems represent a decade of years, the Twelve Branches constitute a \"dodecade\" of years. As can be seen from the existence of astronomical names, they are derived from the stations of the planet Jupiter during its twelve-years-long phase of XXX.\n\nIn combination with a reign motto, years are often indicated by rendering the cyclical combination (a method called ganzhi jinian fa å¹²æ¯ç´å¹´æ³), like Daoguang renchen éå å£¬è¾° \"the year with the cyclical combination renchen å£¬è¾° during the Daoguang reign-period (1821-1850)\", i.e. 1832, or dingchou nian ä¸ä¸å¹´ or dingchou sui ä¸ä¸æ­² \"during the year with the cyclical combination dingchou\". The latter example can only be exactly determined if the historical context of the statement is known, because every sixty years, the cyclical combinations repeat. The year dingchou might be 1877, 1937 or 1997.\n\nApart from the animal cycle and the cyclical combinations, Chinese literature makes use of several alternative designations for years that are partially astronomical, partially colloquial, and some also poetic. The astronomical designations for the twelve Terrestrial Branches are derived from the names of the station of the planet Jupiter (suixing æ­²æ) in its twelve-year cycle around the sun. For each year of the Jupiter cycle, there are designations that probably originate in Indian astronomy. According to this method (called suixing jinian fa æ­²æç´å¹´æ³), the year with the cyclical combination jiayin ç²å¯ , for instance, is called efeng shetige é¼é¢æææ ¼.\n\nThere were historically three different points of time when the calendric year began, known as san zheng ä¸æ­£ \"three first-months\". These were the New Year of the Xia Calendar (Xiazheng å¤æ­£), that of the Yin or Shang Calendar (>Yinzheng æ®·æ­£), and that of the Zhou Calendar (Zhouzheng å¨æ­£). These beginnings of the year were defined as the time when the star Antares (dahuoxing å¤§ç«æ, modern name Xinxiu er å¿å®¿äº) was to be seen at dawn. During the Xia period, this was the beginning of the third astronomical month (yin å¯ XXX), during the Shang period that of the fourth , and during the Zhou period that of the fifth month. The first month of the Xia calendar therefore corresponded to the twelfth month of the Yin/Shang, and to the eleventh month of the Zhou calendar. The consecutive change of the beginning of the year under these three dynasties was called the \"Three connected (calendars)\" (santong ä¸çµ±) and was described in the explanation Santong shuo ä¸çµ±èªª XXX. The historians Wang Tao çé, Zhu Wenxin æ±æé« and ShinzÅ ShinjÅ æ°åæ°è have found out that the theory of these three changes was only developed during the Spring and Autumn or the Warring States period, and can not be proved by historical evidence. Qian Caocong é¢å¯¶ç® is of the opinion that these were regional calendars used by the peoples of the Xia, Shang and Zhou, and not official calendars of the three dynasties.\n\nSources:\n\nChen Jiujin é³ä¹ é (1980). \"Sanzheng ä¸æ­£\", in Zhongguo da baike quanshu ä¸­åå¤§ç¾ç§å ¨æ¸, part Tianwenxue å¤©æå­¸ (Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe), 283.\n\nYan Dunjie å´æ¦å, Xi Zezong å¸­æ¾¤å® (1980). \"Zhongguo gudai lifa ä¸­åå¤ä»£ææ³\", in Zhongguo da baike quanshu ä¸­åå¤§ç¾ç§å ¨æ¸, part Tianwenxue å¤©æå­¸ (Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe), 557.\n\nMonths\n\nThe months of the calendar are normally counted with numbers, barring the first month of the year which is called zhÄngyuÃ¨ (!) æ­£æ. The other months are given regular numbers, like eryue äºæ \"second month\", sanyue ä¸æ \"third month\", and so son. Intercalary months (runyue éæ) are to be found in nine among a cycle of seventeen years. They serve to cover the leap of the lunar calendar to the solar calendar that increments in the course of time.\n\nThe Chinese lunar calendars knows intercalary months throughout the year, except months during which the so-called zhongqi ä¸­æ°£ solar terms occur: yushui é¨æ°´, chunfen æ¥å, guyu ç©é¨, xiaoman å°æ»¿, xiazhi å¤è³, dashu å¤§æ, chushu èæ, qiufen ç§å, shuangjiang éé, xiaoxue å°éª, dongzhi å¬è³, and dahan å¤§å¯). The name of the intercalary months depends on the preceding month, for instance, the \"intercalary (month after the) third month\" (run sanyue éä¸æ). The sequence of the months is therefore sanyue, run sanyue, siyue. There are short months with 29 days and long months with 30 days.\n\nIt is important to note that the number-counted months of the luni-solar calendar (whose year begins between late January and late February) are not identical to the astronomical months whose cycle begins in December XXX. The names of these months are that of the cycle of the twelve Terrestrial Branches. There are furthermore colloquial and poetic names for each of the twelve months.\n\nAccording to the beliefs of correlative thinking each month is related to a cardinal direction, a type of wind, a musical pitch pipe, and one of 28 starry constellations, with which the planet Jupiter culminates in the course of the year.\n\nThe Twelve Months and Their Cosmic Relations no.branchconstellations (boundaries overlapping)direction, mythological animal, seasonal windpitch pipe 1å­ ziæ±å£ Dongbi\n\nçå®¤ YingshiNorth; winter; xuanwu çæ­¦ \"Black Warrior\"; Guangmo wind å»£è«é¢¨é»é¾ huangzhong 2ä¸ chouå± Wei\n\nè Xu\n\né å¥³ XunÃ¼å¤§å dalÃ¼ 3å¯ yinç½ç Qianniu\n\nå»ºæ Jianxing\n\nç® JiTiaofeng wind æ¢é¢¨æ³°è taicu 4å¯ maoå°¾ Wei\n\nå¿ Xin\n\næ¿ FangEast; spring; qinglong éé¾ \"Green Dragon\"; Mingshu wind æåº¶é¢¨å¤¾é¾ jiazhong 5è¾° chenæ° Di\n\näº¢ Hang\n\nè§ Jiaoå§æ´ guxian 6å·³ siè»« Chen\n\nç¿¼ Ji\n\nä¸æ QixingQingming wind æ¸ æé¢¨ä¸­å zhonglÃ¼ 7å wuå¼µ Zhang\n\næ³¨ ZhuSouth; summer; zhuque æ±é \"Vermilion Bird\"; Jingfeng wind æ¯é¢¨è¤è³ ruibin 8æª weiå¼§ Hu\n\nç¼ Langæé¾ linzhong 9ç³ shenç½° Fa\n\nå ShenLiangfeng wind æ¶¼é¢¨å¤·å yize 10é  youæ¿ Zhuo\n\nç LiuWest; autumn; baihu ç½è \"White Tiger\"; Changhe wind é¶éé¢¨åå nanlÃ¼ 11æ xuè Wei\n\nå© Lou\n\nå¥ Kuiç¡å° wuyi 12äº¥ haiæ±å£ DongbiBuzhou wind ä¸å¨é¢¨æé¾ yingzhong Designation of the astronomical months according to the twelve Terrestrial Branches. XXX according to the books XXX.\n\nAll three calendric months of one season are given designations that are also used in the field of family relationships, namely mengchun å­æ¥ \"oldest month of spring\", zhongchun ä»²æ¥ \"middle month of spring\", and jichun å­£æ¥ \"smallest month of spring\", and so on. The astronomical occurrences, the phaenology of nature, and the work of the farmers during each month of the year is described in early texts like the Xia xiaozheng å¤å°æ­£ \"Small calendar of the Xia\" (today a chapter of the semi-Classic Da Dai Liji å¤§æ´ç¦®è¨) or Yueling æä»¤ \"Proceedings of Government in the different months\" (today a chapter of the Confucian Classic Liji ç¦®è¨). About the first month, for example, it is said that the star Ju é appears. At the beginning of dusk the constellation Shen å culminates. The tail of the Northern Dipper points downwards. At that time is favourable wind. It is necessary that there is thunder in the first month. The husbandman goes out as soon as the snow is melting. The frost fades, and people remove the remaining dirt. The hibernate animals wake up, the wild goose appears in the northern villages, the pheasant cries excitedly, the fish appear and brake the ice, in the gardens sprouts the leek, the voles come out, the otters offer fish, the eagles behave like turtledoves. The willows push, the plums, abricots and peaches begin to flower, nodules cover the herb gao ç¸, and the chicks breed and feed (transl. according to Grynpas). In the last month of spring, the sun is in the constellation Wei è, the constellation culminating at dusk being Qixing ä¸æ, and that culminating at dawn Qianniu ç½ç. Rainbows begin to appear. In this month the influences of life and growth are fully developed; and the warm and genial airs diffuse themselves. The rains of the season will be coming down, and the waters beneath will be swelling up. The Elaeococca begins to flower. Moles are transformed into quails. Duckweed begins to grow. The crooked shoots are all put forth, and the buds are unfolded (transl. Legge).\n\nThe important ancient history Chunqiu æ¥ç§ \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" is called so because the entries in this chronicle list the seasons, the months, and the days. This method was so impressive that it gave its name to a whole age, the Spring and Autumn period æ¥ç§ (770-5th cent. BCE).\n\nWeeks and Days\n\nMonths are today divided into three ten-day weeks (xun æ¬). The first week is called shangxun ä¸æ¬, the second or middle zhongxun ä¸­æ¬, and the last xiaxun ä¸æ¬. Yet traditionally the weeks have nothing to do with the lunar months directly, but are a sub-unit of the sexagenary cycle of 60 days, six weeks constituting one cycle. The days of weeks were therefore counted with the help of the ten celestial stems (jia ç², yi ä¹, bing ä¸, ... gui ç¸). The weeks run through the year, independently of the beginning of months and the solar year. Unlike the Western calendric weeks, they are not related to the beginning of a year and overlap the boundaries of the months and the beginning of a new year. For example, the traditional Chinese year in 2009 began on January 26 on the day with the cyclical combination xinwei è¾æª, the year 2010 on February 14 with the combination yiwei ä¹æª, 2011 on February 3 and with the combination jichou å·±ä¸.\n\nThe term xun æ¬ is also used to denote a decade of life, for instance, qi xun ä¸æ¬ \"seventy years (of life)\".\n\nThe Western seven-day week was introduced in China in 1912, although it was known long before under the name qiyao ä¸æ \"seven illuminators\" already during the Tang period å (618-907) and earlier, when it came to China by Buddhist transmission. The Chinese names for the days of the seven-days week changed over time. The earliest reference to the qiyao days is to be found in Fan Ning's èç¯ commentary to the Classic Guliangzhuan ç©æ¢å³ from the Eastern Jin period æ±æ (317-420). The oldest detailed description of the idea behind the seven-day week, and their names in foreign languages, is to be found in the Buddhist calendric treatise Xiuyao lijing å®¿ææç¶ (Tripitaka 1299, full title Wenshushili Pusa ji zhuxian suo shuo jixiong shiri shan'e xiuyao jing ææ®å¸«å©è©è©åè«¸ä»æèªªåå¶ææ¥åæ¡å®¿æç¶, translated from Sanskrit by the monk Bukong ä¸ç©º).\n\nEach day was related to one \"star\" or its deity, similar to the Western week (Wednesday as the day of Wotan, or martedÃ¬ as the day of God Mars). These were sun, moon, the the five visible planets Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. In Chinese translation the names of the five planets were replaced by the five elements correlating to them (see Five Agents), namely fire for Mars, water for Mercury, Wood for Jupiter, metal for Venus, and Earth for Saturn, so that Sunday was riyaori æ¥ææ¥ \"sun-day\", Monday yueyaori æææ¥ \"moon-day\", Tuesday huoyaori ç«ææ¥ \"fire-day\", etc. This system is still in use in Japan and Korea (nichiyÅbi, getsuyÅbi, kayÅbi etc. in Japanes, and ilyoil, wolyoil, hwayoil etc. in Korean). In more recent times (early 20th century?) the term yaori ææ¥ became obsolete and was replaced by a system that centered more on Sunday, the day of the Lord, while the other days were counted with numbers. There are two terms for \"day\" in this system, namely xingqi ææ (an ancient name for the qixi festival ä¸å¤ on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month) and libai ç¦®æ \"ritual prayer\". The latter term clearly shows Christian influence. Sunday is xingqi tian ææå¤© or libai tian ç¦®æå¤© (in the People's Republic rather qingqi ri æææ¥, to avoid the word tian å¤© \"Heaven\"), Monday xingqi yi ææä¸ or libai yi ç¦®æä¸, etc. A rarely seen system of counting days calls Sunday zhuri ä¸»æ¥ \"Day of the Lord\", Monday zhanli er ç»ç¦®äº \"Ritual observation two\" (because according to Catholic day counting Sunday is the first day of the week), etc. It is also used in Vietnam, where Monday is called chá»§ nháº­t ä¸»æ¥, Monday ngÃ y thá»© hai \"day number two\" (Vietamese words) etc. This system leads to some confusion because Saturday is called zhanli qi ç»ç¦®ä¸ \"Ritual observation seven\" (as the last day of the week), while the secular system calls it xingqi liu ææå ­ \"star-period six\" and the Protestant system libai liu ç¦®æå ­ \"Ritual prayer six\".\n\nIn some printed calendars the term zhou é± \"cycle\" is used as a word for \"week\", and the days are called: Sunday zhouri é±æ¥, Monday zhouyi é±ä¸, etc.\n\nAn example of a traditional date looks either like Xuantong san nian ba yue shijiu ri å®£çµ±ä¸å¹´å «æåä¹æ¥ \"Nineteenth day of the eight lunar month of the third year of the Xuantong reign-period\" (i.e. October 10th, 1911), or bayue guichou å «æç¸ä¸ \"eight month, day with the cyclical combination guichou\".\n\nHours\n\nThe traditional Chinese day was divided into twelve hours (\"double-hours\" from the Western perspective, in Chinese shi æ). They do not begin at midnight, but the point of midnight is just in the middle of the mid-night hour, the \"hour of the rat\". The popular names of the twelve hours are that of twelve animals that are also used for the twelve-year cycle. More scholary, the hours are termed with the names of the twelve Terrestrial Branches. The expression mao shi å¯æ means, the time between 5 to 7 AM, or \"the hour of the rabbit\". The animal designations are preferred by Westerners when referring to Chinese time, but rarely used in Chinese. Two of the terrestrial branches are still known in modern time designations, namely zi å­ in ziye å­å¤ \"midnight\", and wu å in the terms shangwu ä¸å \"before noon\", zhongwu ä¸­å \"high noon\", xiawu ä¸å \"afternoon\" and wufan åé£¯ \"lunch\" etc. Quite famous is also the exterior gate of the imperial palace, the Wumen åé that was located to the south (the direction of midday).\n\nIn ancient times the hours were announced publicly from the drumtower (gulou é¼æ¨) in each larger city. Belltowers (zhonglou éæ¨) served to announce the morning, as well as the death of an emperor or an inimical attack.\n\nThe Twelve Double-Hours (shi'er shichen åäºæè¾°) no.branchanimalhour 1å­ zié¼ shu rat, mouse2300-0100 2ä¸ chouç niu ox, cow0100-0300 3å¯ yinè hu tiger0300-0500 4å¯ maoå  tu rabbit0500-0700 5è¾° chené¾ long dragon0700-0900 6å·³ siè she snake0900-1100 7å wué¦¬ ma horse1100-1300 8æª weiç¾ yang sheep, ram1300-1500 9ç³ shenç´ hou monkey1500-1700 10é  youé ji cock, roaster1700-1900 11æ xuç gou or ç¬ quan dog1900-2100 12äº¥ haiè±¬ zhu pig, boar2100-2300 Designations of hours by the twelve Terrestrial Branches, the animal names for these hours (popular in the West), and the corresponding time from 11 PM on.\n\nModules of the Chinese Calendar\n\nThe Twenty-four Solar Terms\n\nThe 24 Solar Terms (ershisi jieqi äºååç¯æ°£) are periods of time during which certain phaenological events take place, particularly the arrival of seasons, the growth and withering of plants, high points in temperature and precipitation, and cycles in the life of insects and other animals. The term jieqi literally means \"nodes of energy\" and refers to the growing and declining energy (qi æ°£) of Yin and Yang in the course of the year. The year begins at the point in which Yin (the less energetic) prevails and Yang (the more energetic) just begins to rise again. This point can either be around the winter solstice (dongzhi å¬è³ \"winter has arrived\"), or when spring visibly begins. Because of this ambiguous definition, the beginning of the year was not always defined in the same way in earlier times. Some authors translate jieqi as \"mini-seasons\", with a length of two weeks. They are related to the solar year because it is the sun that influences the \"energy\" on earth, and not the moon, whose appearance and movement determines the calendar.\n\nThere are two different types of jieqi, namely the twelve proper jieqi, and the twelve zhongqi ä¸­æ°£ \"middle energies\". They alternate with each other. These designations might have origined during the Warring States period æ°å (5th cent.-221 BCE) and are first mentioned in full in the chapter Tianwen xun å¤©æè¨ \"On the patterns of Heaven\" in the book Huainanzi æ·®åå­.\n\nThe solar terms were originally examined with the help of a gnomon (guibiao å­è¡¨) whose shadow can be used to determine the hour of the day (by the position of the shadow in the segment of a circle), but also, by the changing length of the shadow over the months, the process of the year. This is most easy at those points of time when the shadow is shortest (xiazhi å¤è³ \"summer has arrived\") and longest (dongzhi å¬è³ \"winter has arrived\"). The time in-between those occurrences was divided into twelve parts with eleven further points of time that each initiated the beginning of a \"mini-season\". Each of these twelve segments was passed two times a year. The beginning point of the season dongzhi was seen as the beginning of the solar year (the point when the Yang energy is lowest), and the point xiazhi (the Yang energy being strongest) as the medium point of it. During the solar terms chunfen æ¥å and qiufen ç§å the vernal and autumnal equinoxes occur. The term qingming æ¸ æ is also known otherwise because it is the time when the Qingming Festival or tomb-sweeping festival (qingmingjie æ¸ æç¯) takes place. It might be well to recall the fact that the solar terms are part of the lunar year and therefore begin with the Chinese new year.\n\nThis gnomon method is called \"balancing the energy (terms)\" (pingqi å¹³æ°£). Each of the twelve months of the year includes one jieqi point and one zhongqi point (marking the beginning of a term), for instance, the solar term lichun ç«æ¥ as the jieqi and the term yushui é¨æ°´ as the zhongqi. In some cases it can be that one month includes only one of the solar terms because the solar terms operate with the solar year, and the months with the shorter lunar year. With the introduction of the Taichu Calendar å¤ªåæ during the mid-Former Han period åæ¼¢ (206 BCE-8 CE) the rule was therefore established that a jieqi term might occur in the second half of a month and the first half of the following, and a zhongqi term only in the frame of one month. Should there in any case be a month without a zhongqi term, this month is then made an intercalary month of the foregoing month.\n\nA reform of this method was undertaken during the Sui period é (581-618). The astronomer Zhang Zixin å¼µå­ä¿¡ had become aware that the \"velocity of the sun\" is not the same at each time of the year (because the earth moves on a slightly elliptic orbit and is quicker in those stretches where it is closer to the sun). In 604 therefore Liu Chuo åç¯ created the Huangji Calendar çæ¥µæ, in which the course of the sun along the \"Yellow Path\" (the ecliptic of the sun) is divided into 24 segments of equal size. Each solar term begins at the point of time at which the sun enters the particular segment. This new method was called \"fixation of energy (terms)\" (dingqi å®æ°£). Both methods continued to be used, the old one for the calendar in daily use, the new for the scholarly calculation of the method. Only during the Qing period æ¸ (1644-1911) the old pingqi method was finally abolished.\n\nThe Twenty-Four Solar Terms (shi'er jieqi åäºç¯æ°£) solar termmeaningapproximate date of beginning ç«æ¥ Lichun \"Spring begins\" Feb 5 é¨æ°´ Yushui ä¸­ \"Rain water\" Feb 19 é©è Jingzhe \"Excited insects\" Mar 5 æ¥å Chunfen ä¸­ \"Vernal partition\" (Vernal equinox) Mar 20 æ¸ æ Qingming \"Clear and bright\" Apr 5 ç©é¨ Guyu ä¸­ \"Grain rains\" Apr 20 ç«å¤ Lixia \"Summer begins\" May 5 å°æ»¿ Xiaoman ä¸­ \"Grain starts filling\" May 21 èç¨® Mangzhong \"Grain in ear\" June 6 å¤è³ Xiazhi ä¸­ \"Summer arrives\" (Summer solstice) June 21 å°æ Xiaoshu \"Slight heat\" July 7 å¤§æ Dashu ä¸­ \"Great heat\" July 23 ç«ç§ Lichun \"Autumn begins\" Aug 7 èæ Chushu ä¸­ \"Limit of heat\" Aug 23 ç½é² Bailu \"White dew\" Sep 8 ç§å Qiufen ä¸­ \"Autumnal partition\" (Autumnal equinox) Sep 23 å¯é² Hanlu \"Dold dew\" Oct 8 éé Shuangjiang ä¸­ \"Hoar frost descends\" Oct 23 ç«å¬ Lidong \"Winter begins\" Nov 7 å°éª Xiaoxue ä¸­ \"Little snow\" Nov 22 å¤§éª Daxue \"Heavy snow\" Dec 7 å¬è³ Dongzhi ä¸­ \"Winter arrives\" (Winter solstice) Dec 21 å°å¯ Xiaohan \"Little cold\" Jan 6 å¤§å¯ Dahan ä¸­ \"Severe cold\" Jan 21 The twenty-four solar terms (two-week intervals) and their approximate time of beginning.

It was in use from at least the Shang period å (17th-11th cent. BCE), but the date of its introduction is not known. The cycle is used to count years and covers approximately one human lifetime, namely sixty years. It is not joined to any political or cultural occurrence (like the birth of Jesus Christ or Mohammed's flight to Medina). After sixty years, the cycle begins anew. The sexagenery cycle is applied to count year and days, and therefore six times covers the time period of a (lunar) year (6 * 60 = 360), or approximately once the lifetime of a man (sixty years). The twelve branches are also used to count months and the hours of a day (\"double-hours\" from the Western perspective). The ten stems are also generally used to count, for instance, chapters or volumes of a book, or like numbers in a list (up to ten). During the Xia å¤ (17th - 15th cent. BCE) and the Shang periods the temple names of kings included a number of the Ten Stems, like Tai Kang å¤ªåº· (or Tai Geng å¤ªåº) and Kong Jia å­ç² of the Xia and, much more regularly, Shang Jia ä¸ç², Bao Yi å ±ä¹, Bao Ding å ±ä¸ and Bao Bing å ±ä¸ of the Shang. The rules of this pattern are still not sufficiently explained.\n\nThe first unit or \"number\" of the sexagenarian cycle is the cyclical combination jiazi ç²å­, the last combination is guihai ç¸äº¥. Each day and each year are given one of the sixty \"numbers\" in the predefined sequence, and after sixty units, the cycle begins with the first \"number\" again. Because of its cyclical character the sixty combinations can only be used to indicate years within a time frame of one generation (when counting years), or three months (when counting days).\n\nIn practice, therefore, they are combined with the reign mottos of emperors, for instance, Yongzheng yimao éæ­£ä¹å¯, meaning the year with the cyclical combination yimao ä¹å¯ during the Yongzheng reign-period, i.e. 1735. This kind of naming years is often to be found in the late imperial period, when emperors only chose one single reign motto, and was even used in the twentieth century, as can be seen in the designations of important political events, like the reform movement of 1898 (wuxu bianfa ææè®æ³ \"constitutional change during the wuxu year\") of 1898 or the Revolution of 1911 (xinhai geming è¾äº¥é©å½ \"Revolution of the xinhai year\"). Today, the cyclical characters of the year are still indicated on calendars and are also used by artists, particularly calligraphers, to indicate the year in which their work was created.\n\nWhen used for days, it is necessary to combine the cyclical characters with the month, or at least the season, in order to avoid confusion. Today, this method is not any more used in daily life.\n\nThe twelve Terrestrial Branches were also used to count double-hours (shi æ, shichen æè¾°) and months (yue æ). The first of the characters, zi å­, corresponds to the Western hours 2300 to 0100 (11 PM to 1 AM), the second, chou ä¸, to the double-hour between 0100 to 0300 (1 to 3 AM). In order to count months, the cyclical character zi is used to designate the month in which the winter solstice (dongzhi å¬è³) occurs.\n\nSource: Chen Jiujin é³ä¹ é (1980). \"Ganzhi å¹²æ¯\", in: Zhongguo da baike quanshu ä¸­åå¤§ç¾ç§å ¨æ¸, Tianwenxue å¤©æå­¸, Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe, p. 83.\n\nThe Jupiter Cycle\n\nIt was observed in oldest times that the planet Jupiter (modern name muxing æ¨æ) accidentally \"revolves\" around the earth in a timespan (the sidereal period) of roughly twelve years. It was therefore called the \"year star\" (suixing æ­²æ) and used for the calendar. Its path around the earth was divided into twelve segments or \"paces\" (shi'er ci åäºæ¬¡), and it was so possible to name an individual year according to Jupiter's position on the background of the starry sky. Ancient histories of the Spring and Autumn period therefore say, for instance, \"it was the year (when Jupiter was in) Leo\" (sui zai chunhuo æ­²å¨é¶ç«). With the help of such statements, historical event can be dated more exactly. In the history Guoyu the astronomer Ling Zhou Jiu ä¼¶å·é³© says that the conquest of the Shang by King Wu of Zhou took place in the Jupiter year Dunhuo é¶ç« (1057 BCE). The Jupiter positions are also called the \"twelve regions\" (shi'er fenye åäºåé). Their designations are: xingji æç´, xuanxiao çæµ (zhuanxu é¡é ), zouzi è«è¨¾ (shiwei è±é), jianglou éå©, daliang å¤§æ¢, shichen å¯¦æ², chunshou é¶é¦, chunhuo é¶ç«, chunwei é¶å°¾, shouxing å£½æ, dahuo å¤§ç« and zhemu ææ¨.\n\nExcept the twelve segments for the Jupiter years, Chinese astronomers divided the celestial globe into twelve \"double-hour\" segments that were named according to the twelve Terrestrial Branches. The direction of the sequence was opposite to that of the Jupiter segments that follow the direction from west to east. It was believed that there was a counter-Jupiter or \"Grand Jupiter\" (taisui å¤ªæ­²), a kind of imaginary celestial body according to whose movements the double-hours were counted. Similar to Jupiter, the counter-Jupiter revolved once around the earth every twelve years, but in the opposite direction, yet in a fix relation to the Jupiter, so that the position of the imaginary counter-Jupiter can always be known once that of the real planet is analyzed.\n\nThe twelve stations of the counter-Jupiter were also given individual names, additionally to the twelve Branches namely: Kundun å°æ¦ (zi), Chifenruo èµ¤å¥®è¥ (chou), Shetige æææ ¼ (yin), Danâe å®é¼ (mao), Zhixu å·å¾ (chen), Dahuangluo å¤§èè½ (si), Dunzang æ¦ç (wu), Xieqia åæ´½ (wei), Tuntan æ¶ç (shen), Zuoâe ä½å© (you), Yanmao é¹è (xu) and Dayuanxian å¤§æ·µç» (hai). Like these alternative names for the twelve Branches, the ten Celestial Stems have also alternative designations: Efeng é¼é¢ (jia), Zhanmeng æè (yi), Rouzhao æå  (bing), Qiangyu å¼·å (ding), Zhuyong èé (wu), Tuwei å± ç¶­ (ji), Shangzhang ä¸ç« (geng), Chongguang éå  (xin), Xuanyi çé» (ren) and Zhaoyang æ­é½ (gui). Of both cycles, these alternative names can be used instead of the cyclical combination of the sexagenary cycle, like for Efeng shetige é¼é¢æææ ¼ instead of jiayin ç²å¯ . These names are occasionally mentioned in very elegant literature. In some books these designations are slightly differently written.\n\nIt might be that the twelve stations of the Jupiter are derived from the four symbols of the cardinal directions (sigong åå®® \"four palaces\" or sixiang åè±¡ \"four appearances\", i.e. the Black Tortoise çæ­¦ for the North, the White Tiger ç½è for the West, the Vermillion Bird æ±é for the South and the Green Dragon éé¾ for the East) that are divided into three sub-regions. Unfortunately this geometrical division is not congruent with area of the right ascension of the Jupiter. In the chapter on music and astronomy (LÃ¼li zhi å¾æå¿) in the official dynastic history Hanshu æ¼¢æ¸ the twelve stations of the Jupiter correspond with the twenty-four solar terms (ershishi jieqi), the jieqi marking the beginning of the station, and the zhongqi term being located within the Jupiter station.\n\nFrom the late Ming period on, under the influence of European astronomny brought to China by the Jesuits, the designation of the twelve Jupiter stations were also used to designate the twelve zodiacal signs (shi'er gong åäºå®®) of the solar ecliptic, yet the corresponding areas are not exactly congruent. Capricornus (mojie gong é­ç¾¯å®®), for instance, corresponds to the Xingji area (xingji gong æç´å®®), but the beginning (entering point) of this area is identical to the Dongzhi term å¬è³.\n\nThe \"Jupiter year\" is in fact only 11.86 solar years long, and therefore laps to the solar year. Its use (called suixing jinian æ­²æç´å¹´ \"recording years by the Jupiter year\") was in practice abolished with the introduction of the Sifen Calendar ååæ in the Later Han period.\n\nSources:\n\nChen Jiujin é³ä¹ é (1980). \"Suixing jinian æ­²æç´å¹´\", in: Zhongguo da baike quanshu ä¸­åå¤§ç¾ç§å ¨æ¸, Tianwenxue å¤©æå­¸, Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe, p. 339.\n\nWang Jianmin çå¥æ° (1980). \"Shi'er ci åäºæ¬¡\", in: Zhongguo da baike quanshu ä¸­åå¤§ç¾ç§å ¨æ¸, Tianwenxue å¤©æå­¸, Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe, p. 318.\n\nHistory of the Chinese Calendar and Astronomy\n\nChina developed a calendar on its own already during times immemorial. The oldest written traces of the calendar can be found in the oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang period. The calendar is already developed to full maturity during the Warring States period. The amount of literature on astronomical matters is vast, and only third to the large treasure of writings on agriculture and medicine. Astronomy was from the beginning connected to both mathematics and astrology. The latter ranges between philosophy and mathematics, and can therefore be called a kind of pseudo-science. A lot of data are preserved in ancient writings about solar eclipses (rishi æ¥é£), lunar eclipses (yueshi æé£), lunar occultations (yue yanxing ææ©æ), sunspots (taiyang heizi å¤ªé³é»å­, a modern term), meteors (liuxing æµæ), comets (huixing å½æ) and novae (xinxing æ°æ).\n\nIn comparison to the Western calendar, there are a lot of idiosyncratic features that have to be explained in order to understand the Chinese way of calculating and recording time. The difficulty of astronomy made it necessary that the ancient kings employed a \"Grand Scribe\" (taishi å¤ªå²) who was astronomer, astrologer, and then also a historian. Among the treatises of most official dynastic histories a chapter on astronomy is to be found (Lizhi æå¿ or LÃ¼li zhi å¾æå¿). The duty of the astronomer and his bureau was to calculate the beginning of the year, the twelve months, intercalary months, the twenty-four solar terms, the occurrence of lunar and solar eclipses, and the movement and positions of the five planets. This set of data is called the \"calendric standard\" (lifa ææ³). Chinese astronomy was predominantly occupied with the calculation of the data for the calendar, and among these, particularly the movement of the moon and the sun, because these two celestial bodies were both significant for the Chinese luni-solar calendar.\n\nAnother important field of Chinese astronomy was the observation of celestial phenomena. The respective treatises in the official dynastic histories are called Tianwen zhi å¤©æå¿ \"On the patterns of Heaven\". The most important instrument for their observation was the armillary sphere (hunyi æ¸¾å). While the ancient Greeks focused on the ecliptic of the sun (huangdao é»é \"yellow path\"), the Chinese astronomers were interested into the celestial equator (chidao èµ¤é). This was divided into 360 degrees (du åº¦). During the Yuan period the Shoushi Calendar æææ was introduced which can be seen as the most perfect development of the Chinese calendar before the Jesuits brought Western astronomical science to China.\n\nAccording to mythology the oldest Chinese astronomer was Xi He ç¾²å, an official of the mythological emperor Yao å ¯. As a cultural hero Xi He created the calendar and handed it over to mankind. In the chapter Yaodian å ¯å ¸ of the Confucian Classic Shangshu å°æ¸ \"Book of Documents\" it is also said that Zhong He ç¾²ä»² lived in the Yanggu Valley æè°· of Mt. Yuyi åµå¤·, where he brought sacrifices to the sun and brought agriculture in accord with the seasons. This spot is believed to have been located near modern Juxian èç¸£, Shandong, where in the 1960s Neolithic pottery was found on which a symbol of the sun was engraved. This is interpreted as an ancient \"character\" for æ¦ \"dawn\", the rising sun. Three other persons were sent to the other cardinal directions: Xi Shu ç¾²å to Nanjiao åäº¤ in the South, He Zhong åä»² to Meigu æ§è°· in the West, and He Shu åå to Youdu å¹½é½ in the North. These persons determined the seasons by the observation of different stars that appear on the southern sky at dusk (huanghun é»æ). It is also said which activities the peasants undergo during these periods of the year:\n\næ¥ä¸­ï¼æé³¥ï¼ä»¥æ®·ä»²æ¥ 'The day,' (said he), 'is of the medium length, and the star is in Niao - you may thus exactly determine mid-spring.\"\n\næ¥æ°¸ï¼æç«ï¼ä»¥æ­£ä»²å¤ 'The day,' (said he), 'is at its longest, and the star is in Huo - you may thus exactly determine mid-summer.\n\nå®µä¸­ï¼æèï¼ä»¥æ®·ä»²ç§ 'The night' (said he), 'is of the medium length, and the star is in Xu - you may thus exactly determine mid-autumn.\n\næ¥ç­ï¼ææ´ï¼ä»¥æ­£ä»²å¬ 'The day,' (said he), 'is at its shortest, and the star is in Mao - you may thus exactly determine mid-winter. (Transl. Legge)\n\nThe names mentioned for the four seasons in this text are Zhongchun ä»²æ¥ \"mid-spring\", Zhongxia ä»²å¤, Zhongqiu ä»²ç§ and Zhongdong ä»²å¬. In later times these names were used to designate the middle month of the four seasons (middle month of Spring, etc.).\n\nThe chapter Yaodian continues to explain that the year is 366 days long, with four seaons (siji åå­£), and that intercalary months (runyue éæ) are used to bring the lunar calendar back into accord with the solar calendar. The oldest known calendar is the so-called Xia xiaozheng å¤å°æ­£ \"Small Correctness of the Xia\" (zheng being the correct beginning of the year). It was supposedly created during the Xia period and has been handed down as a chapter of the book Da Dai Liji å¤§æ´ç¦®è¨. In this calendar all months are characterized by a certain marks, except the second, eleventh and twelfth month. The calendar does not only note which starry constellation is to be observed at dusk in the southern sky (the hunzhong xing æä¸­æ \"evening star\"), but also which constellations is to be seen at dawn in this place (the danzhong xing æ¦ä¸­æ \"morning star\"). It also notes down in which direction the handle of the Northern Dipper (Beidou åæ, Ursa Maior) shows.\n\nAnother trace of Xia period astronomy is the fact that among the posthumous names of last kings of the Xia dynasty like Kong Jia å­ç², Yin Jia è¤ç² or LÃ¼ Gui å±¥ç¸ include signs of the ten Celestial Stems. These must therefore have already been used as \"numbers\" during that time. The oracle bone inscriptions from the Shang period show that the tem Celestial Stems and twelve Terrestrial Branches were used to designate days in the sexagenary cycle. A long list of these designations is to be found in an oracle bone from the reign of King Wu Yi XXX.\n\nThe months were designated with common numbers, except the first which is called zhengyue. The length of the months differed. Large months (dayue å¤§æ) had a length of 30 days, small months (xiaoyue å°æ) of 29 days. The intercalary month that was used to bring the solar calendar (365 days) into accord with the lunar year (360 days) was put at the end of the year, and not, like in later times, in midst. A lot of eclipses and novae are mentioned in the oracle bone inscriptions. Lunar phases (yuexiang æç¸) play an important role in the bronze vessel inscriptions or in the texts of the Shangshu and the Yizhoushu é¸å¨æ¸. Many texts begin with the indication of a date, like wei shiyue you yiyue dinghai å¯åæåä¸æä¸äº¥ \"In the eleventh month, on the day with the cyclical combination dinghai [the king was in the xyz Palace and did this and that]\". The word shuo æ for the new moon is not mentioned in this type of text, but all other phases of the moon, namely chuji åå (first day after the newmoon to the 7th or 8th day), ji shengba æ¢çé¸(or ji shengpo æ¢çé­, from the 8th or 9th day to the 14th or 15th day of the month), ji wang æ¢æ \"full moon\" (from the 15th or 16th day to the 22nd or 23rd day of the month), and ji siba æ¢æ­»é¸ (or ji sipo æ¢æ­»é­, from the 23rd day of the month to the next newmoon). Astronomical phenomena are also mentioned in the Classic Shijing è©©ç¶ \"Book of Songs\".\n\nAstronomical knowledge of the Eastern Zhou period is reflected in the chapter Yueling æä»¤ \"Proceedings of government in the different months\" in the Classic Liji ç¦®è¨. This text operates with the twenty-eight starry constellations (ershiba xiu äºåå «å®¿) as an instrument to measure time. The text explains which constellations is positioned in the southern sky at dawn in the beginning of each month, and in which position the sun sets, for instance, Mengchun zhi yue, ri zai ying Shi, hun å­æ¥ä¹æï¼æ¥å¨çå®¤ï¼æåä¸­ï¼æ¦å°¾ä¸­ãå ¶æ¥ç²ä¹ã \"In the first month of spring the sun is in Shi, the star culminating at dusk being Shen, and that culminating at dawn Wei. Its days are jia and yi\" (transl. Legge). The histories Chunqiu æ¥ç§ and Zuozhuan å·¦å³ include rich information on the calendar. They mention 37 solar eclipses, 32 of which can in fact be identified with historical eclipses. The year 687 BCE (7th year of Duke Zhuang of Lu é­¯èå ¬, summer, 4th month, day xinmao) records: ye, hengxing bu jian, yezhong, xingyun ru yu å¤ï¼ææä¸è¦ï¼å¤ä¸­ï¼æéå¦é¨ \"at night, the regular stars were not visible. At midnight, there was a fall of stars like rain.\" (transl. Legge). This is the oldest record of a meteorite shower in the constellation Lyra. The year 613 (autumn, 7th month) records: You xing bei ru yu Beidou ææå­å ¥äºåæ \"there was a comet, which entered the Northern Bushel\". This might be the earliest mentioning of Halley's Comet.\n\nAround the year 600 astronomers began to make use of gnomons to measure the length of days and the turning points in the year, the winter and the summer solstice. The winter solstice was called Rinanzhi æ¥åè³ \"southern arrival of the sun\", and not, as later, Dongzhi å¬è³ \"arrival of the winter\". This was the beginning point of the year, and the first month was called Chun wang zhengyue æ¥çæ­£æ \"Spring, correcting month of the King\". The winter solstice is mentioned two times in the Zuozhuan, with a distance of 133 years, and in-between 48 intercalary months (with only one record missing). This exactly corresponds to a relation of seven intercalary months in 19 years. In order to correlate the lunar year with the solar year the calendar consisted of 365Â¼ days, and therefore had the name of Sifen li ååæ \"Quarter Calendar\". The six old calendars (gu liu li å¤å ­æ: the Calendar of the Yellow Emperor é»å¸æ, the Calendar of Zhuan Xu é¡é æ, the Xia Calendar å¤æ, the Yin Calendar æ®·æ of the Shang dynasty, the royal Zhou Calendar å¨æ and the ducal Calendar of Lu é­¯æ) before the calendar reform under Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty were \"quarter calendars\". These calendars did in fact not differ in the calculation method, but had their names from mythological emperors, dynasties, or (in the case of Lu) that of the territory where it was used.\n\nIn the various regional states of the Warring States period there were astronomers, some of whom are known by name. In the state of Qi the astronomer Gan Gong çå ¬ or Gan De çå¾· had written the book Tianwen xinzhang å¤©ææå , and in the state of Wei, master Shi Shen ç³ç³ had authored the book Tianwen å¤©æ. Both books dealt largely with astrology, but also included important information about the movement of planets and the constellations. These are preserved in the text Shishi xingjing ç³æ°æç¶ that is now known under the name Gan-Shi xingjing çç³æç¶.\n\nIt was common for historiographers to name a year according to the year in which a ruler was master of his state. The problem of the Warring States period was that except the king of Zhou, each one of the regional rulers (zhuhou è«¸ä¾¯) claimed to be a more or less independent ruler, and used his own calendar. In order to circumvent this confusion, it was therefore necessary to create a designation for years that was independent from worldly rulers. The result was the introduction of the Jupiter calendar (suixing jinian fa å²æçºªå¹´æ³) that provided the opportunity to call years with the name of a certain position in which the planet Jupiter was located on the path of its \"revolution around the earth\".\n\nThe many \"masters and philosophers\" of the age began contemplating about the shape and the construction of the universe. The book Zhuangzi èå­ (chapter Tianyun å¤©é) and the ballad Tianwen å¤©å of the collection Chuci æ¥è¾­ include many questions in this direction. The sky was seen as \"large cover\" with a round shape, while the earth was believed to be \"square like a chessboard\". The book Laozi èå­ (Daodejing éå¾·ç») touches on the question of the creation of the universe, but only the Han period book Huainanzi æ·®åå­ (chapter Tianwen xun å¤©æè®­) gives a clear account of the conception that there was in the beginning a chaos (hundun æ··æ²) that then separated into the light and pure that ascended to the sky, and the heavy and muddy parts that constituted the earth. The sky represented the active energy (yangqi é³æ°), the earth the inactive energy (yinqi é´æ°). Both mixed together, produced the ten thousand creatures. The Huainanzi is also the first book in which astronomical knowledge is precicely laid down, and the mathematical relations of the musical pitch pipes, weights and measures are explained.\n\nIn the last part of the Warring States period the twenty-four solar terms became more important because they were directly related to agronomical activities, and so to the economic output and the financial revenue of the contending states. These, too, are described in the book Huainanzi. At that time the most important constituents of the calendar were the solar terms, connected with the solar year, and the new moon intervals, connected with the lunar year.\n\nWhen the kingdom of Qin had conquered the various regional states and created the Qin empire, the Zhuan Xu calendar was introduced as the empire-wide valid calendar. In this calendar, the tenth month (roughly corresponding to the Western November and December) was the beginning of the year, and the intercalary months were added to the end of a year. The beginning of the calendar was inaugurated in the year with the cyclical combinations jiayin ç²å¯ , on the day jiayin ç²å¯ of the first month (zhengyue æ­£æ) and the solar term Lichun ç«æ¥, a day of a new moon, and when the five planets were seen in the east.\n\nThe Han dynasty adopted the Qin calendar in the beginning, but Emperor Wu initiated a reform of the calendar and in 104 ordered the astronomer Deng Ping éå¹³ and Luoxia Hong è½ä¸é³ to supervise the reform. The same year (the 7th of the reign period Yuanfeng å å°) was renamed the 1st of the reign-period Taichu å¤ªå. The new calendar was therefore called the Taichu Calendar å¤ªåæ. It is the oldest Chinese calendar whose data are recorded in total. The calculation method of this calendar was not as exact as that of the Sifen Calendar, especially concerning the congruence of the lunar and solar years (or tropical year), but it had some decisive advantages compared to the older calendars: The beginning of the year as fixed as the first month zhengyue æ­£æ (corresponding to Western January and February), and not the tenth month. This brought back a direct relation between the beginning of the year and the seasonal phenomena (the beginning of spring as the beginning of the year, like the month begins after a new moon). The intercalary month was flexibly positioned at the end of a month including a zhongqi term, and not at the end of the year. The orbital periods of the planets are stated very exactly, and the exact times of lunar and solar eclipses are given, and the eclipse year is calculated as 346.66 days.\n\nThe Taichu Calendar was in use of 188 years before it was replaced again by the Sifen Calendar in 85 CE. At that time the tropical year and the times of the new moon were not any more coherent with the calculated data. The scholar Jia Kui è´¾éµ therefore advocated the use of a different method for calculation invented by Fu An å å®, not based on days, but on the movement of the sun and moon along the ecliptic and the position of the 28 constellations. As a consequence, the beginning of the Dongzhi winter term å¬è³ was moved from the position in the constellation Qianniu çµç to the constellation Dou æ. Jia Kui had probably observed the phenomenon of the precession (suicha æ­²å·®) of the axis of the earth, which results in a precession of the equinoxes along the ecliptic. He had also become aware of the different velocities of the moon on its orbit, which is higher when the moon is closer to the earth. He therefore suggested the \"method of the nine ways\" (jiudaoshu ä¹éè¡) or nine segments of the orbit.\n\nIn the very late years of the Han period Liu Hong åæ´ª created the Qianxiang Calendar ä¹¾è±¡æ in which he reduced the fractional number of the length of the tropical year to less than Â¼ and calculated the solar year with a length of 365.2462 days. The Qianxiang calendar was the first calendar that was based on a correct calculation of the lunar month, with the consideration of the change of the moon's velocity, and so using a sidereal month instead of a synodic month.\n\nThe most famous astronomer is the Eastern Han period scholar Zhang Heng å¼µè¡¡ who did not only invent the so-called Hou Feng's earthquake detector åé¢¨å°åå, but also developed an armillary sphere that was moved by a waterclock (loushui zhuan huntian yi æ¼æ°´è½æ¸¾å¤©å) that was an advancement of Geng Shouchang's è¿å£½æ celestial globe (hunxiang æ¸¾è±¡). Somewhat earlier than Zhang Heng, Xi Meng éè, wrote a text called Xuanyeshuo å®£å¤è¯´, in which he explained that the sky cannot be like a hard-shelled egg, but must be boundless and filled with air, on which the celestial bodies float. Zhang Heng later said that the sky is round like a pill and the earth like the yolk of an egg.\n\nIn 1973 an important document of Han period astronomy was discovered in the tomb no. 3 of the Mawangdui site in Changsha, Hunan. Written on a silk cloth, an illustrated text of 8,000 characters speaks about divination methods of the Five Planets (Wuxingzhan äºæå ). It records the position of the planets in a time frame of 70 years, and in 29 illustrations the shapes of comets and their tails are described. The treatise on the Five Agents (Wuxing zhi äºè¡å¿) in the history Hanshu provides a detailed description of a lunar eclipse in 89 BCE, and sunspots seen in the year 28 BCE. This is the earliest mentioning of this astronomical phenomenon. The Chinese were always interested in extraordinary phenomena in the sky because these were interpreted as auspicious or inauspicious phenomena influencing the course of political life. Because of this context between astrology and astronomy Chinese sources are therefore extremely rich in reporting appearances and abnormalities in the sky.\n\nDuring the Three Empires period Yang Wei æ¥å became aware that the intersection of the ecliptic with the moon's orbit plane (huangbai jiaodian é»ç½äº¤ç¹) had moved. In his Jingchu calendar æ¯åæ from 237 CE he described this phenomenon and explained that the beginning point of an eclipse was not any more to be found on the point of intersection, but could be found on any point of the eclipse area (shixian é£é). He developed a better method to calculate XXX æ¥æé£é£åååäºæ¹ä½è§. His collegue Chen Zhuo éå compiled a synopsis of the data on stars that had been compiled in earlier times, those of Master Shi ç³æ°, Master Gan çæ° and Wu Xian å·«å¸. This synopsis describes 283 constellations (xingguan æå® \"star offices\") with exact data of 1,464 individual stars. It remained in use until the late Ming period, when Western knowledge supported Chinese astronomers. Ge Heng èè¡¡ invented an astronomical device, the astrolabe (huntianxiang æµå¤©è±¡.\n\nIn the statelet of Later Qin Jiang å§å² developed a new method to calculate the position of the sun with the help of lunar eclipses. The results were laid down in his Sanji jiazi yuanli ä¸çºªç²å­å å Calendar from 384. He was the first scholar who guessed that the red colour of dusk and dawn was the cause of the sunrays having to cross a larger amout of air. Zhao Fei èµµ{é+æ¬ }, who lived in the state of Northern Liang, made progess in the question of intercalary years and explained that in a period of 19 years there must be 7 intercalary months, or, in other relations, 221 intercalary months in a timespan of 600 years. He published the Yuanshi Calendar å å§å in 412.\n\nSources:"
