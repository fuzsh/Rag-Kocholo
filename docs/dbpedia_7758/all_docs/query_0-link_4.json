        "text": "Post by Admin on\n\nRIP!\n\nso, according to his stories:\n\n- who was kangxi's intended heir?\n\n- did yongzheng lose his head? if so, who cut it off?\n\n- who fathered qianlong?\n\nthese tend to be the most controversial points from these three lives.\n\nI haven't finished Yongzheng novel so I don't know if he lose his head or not.\n\nBut for Kangxi, I really like Kangxi, so not only historical novels, I also bought and read history books about Kangxi. To answer your question:\n\nKangxi really passed his throne to Yongzheng. He had reasons for this. Kangxi loved his second son so much, Yinreng who was born from his empress. The empress died when she gave birth Yinreng. Although it's not specifically mentioned, but apparently Kangxi really loved this empress so much. Therefore after the empress died, Kangxi took Yinreng under his own care. He spent time to educate Yinreng by himself, instead of just throw the responsibility to the imperial teachers. And Yinreng was pretty good in the beginning. While Yongzheng ( 4th Prince aka. Yinzhen) was a moody guy. There was a time when he got depressed, and Kangxi later brought him under his care on his palace. Yinreng, when he grew older, then he got bad influence. From Kangxi's diary, it's pretty much written that he's a bisexual and pedophile. And he often bought young boys, and abused them to death for his pervert sexual conduct. Therefore Kangxi was really displeased with his son which was not a virtuous man. He observed Yinreng and he didn't get any better. Then Yinreng with the help of his uncle, plotted a coup to get the throne. Kangxi then demoted him. BUT, then there's an evidence that the oldest son used black magic to harm Yinreng. Therefore Kangxi thought that all of Yinreng misconduct was because of the black magic influence (This black magic thing was depicted in Dynasty Series).\n\nTo make the story short, Yinreng didn't repent and didn't change. Meanwhile, Kangxi's health became deteriorate (he mentioned in his diary that his sadness because of Yinreng caused his health deteriorated so fast). And as grew older, he didn't have much energy to fight corruptions. And he saw that this Yinzhen was the only son who worked as hard as him, and had the lifestyle similar to him. It's said that Kangxi, and Yongzheng, were simple men, and didn't really care for luxurious things in life. Therefore after observing Yinzhen for years, he decided to pass the throne to Yinzhen.\n\nIn his valedictory, Kangxi wrote all the reasons why he later despised Yinreng and chose Yinzhen. And for the edict, Qing Dynasty's edict was written in three languages, Chinese, Mongolian, and Manchurian. Therefore it's impossible to change the will - as if it's often depicted on the series and urban legends.\n\nreading Kangxi valedictory makes me love Kangxi more and more. he's really one of the greatest emperors among more than 300 Chinese emperors.\n\nfor question no. 3 :\n\nYongzheng HAD an older son. Therefore the story about he and his wife changed their baby daughter to Chen Kelao's son is pretty odd."
