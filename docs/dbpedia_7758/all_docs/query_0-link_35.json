        "text": "History of Zhonghe Festival\n\nThe Zhonghe Festival, also known as the Blue Dragon Festival or Longtaitou Festival, is a traditional Chinese agricultural festival. Longtaitou means ‘the dragon raising its head,’ a reference to the beast said to rule over all living things and more significantly, govern the rains.\n\nThe Zhonghe Festival traces its origin to the time the Tang and Song Dynasties were in power. The Dragon King, often called the ‘Dragon God,’ is believed to be the god of the elements of water and weather. He can appear in a multitude of ways. He is the god of the east; the essence of spring is represented by the Blue Dragon. The festival commemorates the ritual worship of the Dragon King who is believed to be responsible for spring rains. Farmers celebrate the Zhonghe Festival to anticipate good weather and plowing conditions for a successful harvest season. The Lord of the Soil and the Ground, ‘Tudigong,’ is still worshipped to this day. Followers of Taoism and Chinese popular religions have always revered this minor deity. ‘Jingzhe,’ the third solar period of the Chinese calendar, falls around the time of the festival. This ‘awakening of insects’ occurs when the land and its hibernating animals are awakened by the first warm hints of spring.\n\nMany of China’s major cities, however, do not celebrate the Zhonghe Festival — it may not even be commemorated in certain hamlets or villages. The places where it is observed follow a variety of traditions. For one, the Dragon God is revered. Those who participate in this festival hope that the Dragon King or God will bring enough rain for a bountiful harvest."
