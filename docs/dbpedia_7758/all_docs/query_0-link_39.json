        "text": "— Nick Lai wants his four young children to learn Mandarin, the language of his native Taiwan.\n\nYet home lessons pose many distractions, from “Dad, I’m thirsty” to the allure of a favorite toy.\n\nSo Lai decided to offer classes at the Bentonville Public Library.\n\nEvery Saturday morning, the family sets up school in the read-aloud area of the children’s section.\n\n“Why not teach (my kids) with other kids at the same time?” explained Lai, whose name is pronounced “lie.”\n\nAided by colorful visuals and a repertoire of songs, stories and games, Lai tries to build familiarity with the basic concepts of Mandarin, the most widely spoken Chinese language.\n\n“It’s not an easy language,” he admits. “The best thing is to repeat and repeat and repeat 50 times.”\n\nThe Jan. 15 class, for example, included a review of numbers invarious forms. Students repeated the familiar words as Lai pointed them out on a wall chart and then joined in singing a Mandarin rendition of “Ten Little Indians.”\n\nLater in the class, Lai returned to the chart, using the numbers to teach the months of the year. The Chinese word for moon, “yue,” is combined with the numbersone through 12, he said. Students understood, chiming in with “yi yue, er yue, san yue” to name the months.\n\nAn average of 30 people attend each class, Lai said. They comprise a wide range of ages and ethnic backgrounds, from his own toddlers to Caucasian adults. The class is designed for children, but parents seem equally interested.\n\n“I like languages, (and) this is a great opportunity to learn,” said Cristina Rosas, a Mexican-American who has been attending classes since the program started in September. “If you start with the kids, with what they learn, it’s more interesting.”\n\nRosas made notes on a digital notepad while her 5-year-old daughter, Crystal Casasola, sang along with Lai. Other students included a Chinese-American couple with two boys and a baby, a Caucasian family with three elementary-aged girls and a law school student trying to stay fluent in the language he learned as an exchange student.\n\nLai designs the lessons around monthly themes. The program started in September with numbers and continued with Halloween in October and winter holidays in November.\n\nThis month, the focus is on the Chinese New Year, which beginsFeb. 3. The children’s library will host a Chinese New Year celebration on Jan. 29.\n\nChinese New Year\n\nLai told a Chinese story to explain the significance of several new year’s traditions.\n\nThere once was a monster who slept 364 days of the year,he began. When the monster awoke, he was ravenously hungry. He devoured everything he could find - chickens, pigs, cows, sheep, even people.\n\nLai used a story board to teach the animal names. He slipped in a quick grammar lesson: in Chinese, there is only one verb tense. The word “che” means eat, ate, and will eat.\n\nBecause of this monster and his veracious appetite, the people ran and hid on this day. Yet one old woman was too weak to run. An old man asked her why she was crying.\n\n“Because I’m too old to run and hide,” she replied. “I might die tonight.”\n\nThe old man explained that the monster was afraid of two things - the color red and loud noises. Those are still the central elements of the Chinese New Year celebration. In former times, people beat on pots and pans, Lai said. Now, there are lavish fireworks displays that last until dawn.\n\nThe festivities continue for two weeks, with fireworks likely to go off at any time of the day or night, he said.\n\nThe library won’t have fireworks, but there will be plenty of red for the new year’s celebration. Already, there is a red Chinese gate at the entrance of the children’s area. Participants will learn about their Chinese zodiac signs and make masks to represent them. They’ll try their hands at brush painting and chopsticks. Lai will tell stories and volunteers will perform a lion dance.\n\n“As a public library, we get to see the very best of the community,” said children’s librarian Sue Ann Pekel. “We are so lucky to have people come forward like this.\n\n“Everyone is very gratefulfor Nick. He’s such a positive addition to our community.” Lessons Preserve Chinese Heritage\n\nLai has an easy, friendly way of teaching that engages both children and adults. He’s unperturbed by the daughter pressing against his knee or the ebb and flow in the library behind him.\n\nHis lessons incorporate many learning styles - visual, auditory and kinesthetic, Pekel said. He also brings the authority of personal experience.\n\n“Nick personally engages people with fi rsthand information.”\n\nThe strategy seems to be working. Students are learning, Lai said. During the fi rst class after the holidays, he spread pictures and characters of previously learned words on the carpet, asking people to match them with spoken words. They got 80 percent right, he said.\n\nHis own children are learning, absorbing the language of his birthplace. Lai’s wife, Leslee, is not Chinese. The two met in Taiwan while she was teaching there. They moved to the U.S. in 2004. Lai is a business analyst with Walmart International.\n\nStewart and Christine Ong, who started Lai’s classes this month, understand the struggle to keep their heritage intact. The two grew up in Chinese families in the Philippines. When their boyswere very young, the couple spoke Mandarin at home in the U.S. Once the boys started day care, that didn’t seem helpful.\n\n“We want to get them in touch with their Chinese heritage,” Stewart Ong said after Lai’s lesson. “That way they won’t get ignorant. They’ll still know their roots.”\n\nMelissa and Mike Grimm, who attended for the first time Jan. 15 with their three daughters, have a different motivation.\n\nThe family has friends in Taiwan and Mike travels there twice a year on business, Melissa said.\n\n“It’s great to learn the basics. If we ever have the opportunity to go over, we won’t feel so alienated by the language.”\n\n“It’s fun,” said her 8-yearold daughter, Ellie. Her favorite part of the class was a Chinese-language version of the rock, scissors, paper game.\n\nRosas, the language-loving mom, knows from experience how important it is to be exposed to native speakers. She studied English in school in Mexico City, but it wasn’t until she moved to Northwest Arkansas four years ago that she began to feel fl uent.\n\n“When you’re exposed to the language, you can learn.”\n\n***\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nMANGO LANGUAGES\n\nAn online learning database at several area libraries can aid patrons in learning Mandarin - or Farsi or Tagalog or Haitian Creole.\n\nMango Languages teaches 17 languages from around the globe. Lessons are available for two levels of interest - basic conversation and in-depth language and grammar.\n\nThere also is an English-as-a-second language component for English language learners.\n\nArea libraries that have the database include Bentonville, Springdale and Fayetteville. Library patrons can access the program on site or from their homes.\n\nHadi Dudley, director of the Bentonville Public Library, said she purchased the program 18 months ago after noting the interest in foreign languages. It was hard to keep language learning audiobooks on the shelves, she said.\n\n“We are lifelong learners. Many adults are interested in learning a foreign language, to improve their job position” and because they value the multicultural community in which they live, she said.\n\nThe library plans to add Little Pim, an online learning program for children to 6 years of age.\n\nSOURCE: STAFF REPORT YEAR OF THE RABBIT\n\n***\n\n2011 is the Year of the Rabbit. Chinese astrology forecasts a placid year, welcomed after the ferocious Year of the Tiger. Good taste and refinement will reign. People will understand that persuasion is better than force.\n\nIt’s best not to become self-indulgent. The influence of the Rabbit tends to spoil those who like comfort. There will be a tendency to put off disagreeable tasks.\n\nThis will be a temperate year with an unhurried pace. People will be carefree and happy without too many annoyances.\n\nSOURCE: WWW.THEHOLIDAYSPOT.COM\n\n***\n\nGO & DO\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR CELEBRATIONS\n\nBentonville Public Library\n\nDate: 2 p.m. Saturday\n\nPlace: 405 S.
