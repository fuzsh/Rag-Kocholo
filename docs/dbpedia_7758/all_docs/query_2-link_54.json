With the single word “Modernism” as a main title, there were eight volumes published in English in the past decade alone.1 We can see the full breadth of interest in the topic if we expand the title search only slightly, to notable examples such as Marjorie Perlofff’s TwentyFirst-Century Modernism, David Bradshaw and Kevin Dettmar’s Companion to Modernist Literature and Culture, Michael Levenson’s Cambridge Companion to Modernism, Mark Wollaeger and Matt Eatough’s Oxford Handbook of Global Modernisms, and Mia Carter and Alan Friedman’s Modernism and Literature, not to mention the newly emergent journal Modernism/Modernity and its afffĳiliated Modernist Studies Association.2 Yet, apart from Christopher Bush’s Ideographic Modernism: China, Writing, Media, relatively little has appeared in English about Chinese modernism, and even less still about modernism in Chinese poetry.3 The only exceptions are Carolyn FitzGerald’s Fragmenting Modernisms: Chinese Wartime Literature, Art, and Film, 1937–1949, a work quite restricted in time span and focused largely on the historical dimensions of violent conflicts and their efffect on artistic practice across generic forms, and Au Chung-to’s Modernist Aesthetics in Taiwanese Poetry since the 1950s, a work that takes Taiwan as a singular focus.4 1 Heesok Chang, Modernism; Peter Gay, Modernism: The Lure of Heresy; Robin Walz, Modernism; Christopher Butler, Modernism: A Very Short Introduction; Ahmet Ersoy et al., Modernism: Representations of National; Michael Levenson, Modernism; Peter Childs, Modernism (The New Critical Idiom); Laura Winkiel, Modernism: The Basics. 2 See the following: Marjorie Perlofff, Twenty-First-Century Modernism: The “New” Poetics; David Bradshaw and Kevin Dettmar, A Companion to Modernist Literature and Culture; Michael Levenson, The Cambridge Companion to Modernism; Mark Wollaeger and Matt Eatough, The Oxford Handbook of Global Modernisms; Mia Carter and Alan Friedman, Modernism and Literature: An Introduction and Reader. 3 Bush’s work, excellent though it is, does not so much address writing in Chinese as it does the idea of the Chinese character as catalyst for the development of Euro-American modernism. As to work about modernism in Chinese poetry itself, there has yet to be a single volume in print. See Bush’s Ideographic Modernism: China, Writing, Media. 4 FitzGerald’s discussion of poetry is principally about Mu Dan’s, to which she devotes an entire chapter and a signifĳicant segment of the epilogue. Her discussion of Mu Dan, though acknowledging heterogeneous sources in Chinese and Western poetics, does not develop a modernist theme as it could, focusing more on the urban/rural divide and other thematic elements of Mu Dan’s work. Au’s study offfers many detailed insights into a specifĳic set of\n\n© koninklijke brill nv leiden 2019 | doi:10 1163/9789004402898 002\n\n2\n\nManfredi AND Lupke\n\nOur book fĳills this gap; it is the fĳirst broad-based compilation of research on modernist Chinese poetry collected in a single volume in English. The goal of our research, moreover, is not simply to attempt to fĳix “modernism” within the cultural record, Chinese or other. We aim, rather, to narrow the aperture enough to enable in-depth discussion of one style and geographical and generic pairing, Chinese modernist poetry, while at the same time allowing for at least some of the intellectual anarchy Xudong Zhang describes in his 1997 discussion of Chinese modernism, a cultural phenomenon that is “never a neatly developed, fully secured, and glamorously ossifĳied object awaiting gentlemanly scholarship; it is always in a moment of painful birth, and profound ambiguity, mired in its formal and political promises and fragility.”5 Part of the problem, as Zhang points out, is not only the question of origin, but also the attendant problem of scope. Zhang is not the only scholar to address such questions where modernism is concerned, and we fĳind related problems in traditions other than Chinese. Most recently, in a wide-ranging study, Susan Stanford Friedman enjoins “planetary modernism” as a challenge to the most basic assumptions about what we as scholars and literary historians gain by staking out such stylistic or temporal categories. Friedman’s highly ambitious work uses a “more expansive framework” to move back in time to before 1500, a traditional starting point for Western modernity, and then across the planet to various episodes of cultural upheaval and modern development. The real benefĳit of Friedman’s work in the context of our study of modernisms is its successful decentering or complete dismantling of a center (West)—periphery (Chinese) epistemology.6 Such a reorientation, necessary and vibrant though it may be to our current effforts to grapple with modernism worldwide, is still on a slightly diffferent track from what we endeavor to accomplish in this work. While it seems clear that the West did not actually invent modernity, it is evident that the West successfully created the idea that the West created modernity. Further, many cultures, China among them, accepted that invention both because Chinese people were forced to by very real threat of signifĳicant military reprisals by Western powers in the mid to late nineteenth century and because an appeal to exogemodernist poets associated with Taiwan but does not situate them into the broader modern Chinese (language) literary tradition (for good or ill). Moreover, the characterization of them as “Taiwanese” is sure to raise eyebrows among scholars, as all the subjects of her work are waishengren ཆⴱӪ, “mainlanders” who were born in mainland China and migrated to Taiwan after the Civil War. See Carolyn FitzGerald, Fragmenting Modernisms; Au Chung-to, Modernist Aesthetics in Taiwanese Poetry since the 1950s. 5 Xudong Zhang, Chinese Modernism in the Era of Reforms, 3. 6 Susan Stanford Friedman, Planetary Modernisms, esp. ix–xi and 311–313.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nnous authority worked in local context more efffectively than, say, appeal to the authority of tradition, or even more or less ex nihilo creation, if such a thing can be said to exist. In other words, and particularly where literary practice is concerned, the Western “roots” of modernity in China are difffĳicult to deny, even if by recognizing them we to some degree recapitulate the misguided assumptions that accrue to the Western-centric origin story for modern culture. Fortunately, the granular view of poetic practice in the Chinese case in fact efffectively complicates larger narratives so as to make moot the concern of Western hegemony, at least in case of Chinese poetic modernism. Before delving into the granular, though, we will provide a simple but necessary review of the developmental arc of modernism in Chinese poetry. Such an arc is typically described as having occurred in three distinct waves: the fĳirst fully conscious and self-titled “Modernist” Movement in China emerged with the writer Shi Zhecun ᯭ㷴ᆈ (1905–2003) in the early 1930s. The 1932inaugurated journal Les Contemporains (Xiandai ⨮ԓ) is therefore the default enclosure for establishing the “in” and “out” of modernist poetic writing early in the century, and the Chinese term Xiandaipai, or “Modernist group (or school),” of authors refers explicitly to the poets whose works were selected by Shi Zhecun for inclusion in the journal.7 This is also to say that from the point of view of a great deal of Chinese scholarship, the bulk of modernist poetic expression appeared in print between the years 1932, when Les Contemporains fĳirst appeared, and 1935, when it was forced into closure by worsening political and social circumstances in war-torn Shanghai. Some of the writers fĳirst associated with the Modernist group went on to form other modernist-afffĳiliated organizations, but for the most part Chinese scholarship treats modernism as something that grew out of Shi Zhecun’s journal and waned with the same well before the middle of the century. The second wave emerged on Taiwan, with Ji Xian’s ㌰ᕖ (1913–2013) groundbreaking Modern Poetry Quarterly (Xiandaishi jikan ⨮ԓ䂙ᆓ࠺, established in 1954, but adopting an explicitly modernist program beginning in 1956. The fĳinal wave returns us to mainland China, where loosening of the Maoist propaganda apparatus, with its once ubiquitous control and absolute adherence to strict socialist-realism as the only admissible style of creative expression, began to fall apart in 1979. What followed were fĳive or so years of renewed explicit interest on the part of writers and artists alike in modernist styles drawn once again from the West. These are the broad strokes. However, there is considerably more to the story than the three-wave description will reveal. For instance, an earlier, less recognized but 7 A good example of this is Lan Dizhi’s Xiandaipai shixuan, the introduction of which forms chapter 1 of this volume.\n\n4\n\nManfredi AND Lupke\n\nfully modernist expression in poetry and visual art emerged on Taiwan before Les Contemporains was inaugurated. Moreover, modernist writing formed an important backdrop to Ji Xian’s Modernist Movement almost twenty years later. Or, in another important case, some post-Les Contemporains activities of many of the Shanghai group, combined with others from around the country during the short-lived Southwest Associated University in Kunming, found expression in the Nine Leaves poetry of the early 1940s, a sophisticated movement that became an important touchstone for writers later in the century. These and other complexities are explored in detail in this book. Of the questions our inquiry into the term modernism(s) will raise, where and when such modernism may be said to “end” is perhaps the most challenging. Here is where the authors in this volume stake out new territory. Allowing for the obvious importance of postmodern discourse in literature worldwide in general terms, and in Chinese literature and culture beginning with Fredric Jameson’s lectures in Beijing in the mid-1980s, what we see emerging in the fĳinal decades of the twentieth and into the twenty-fĳirst century is a notable continuation of (rather than return to) modernist strategies emerging alongside postmodern challenges to aesthetic practice, both modernist and not. Modernism remains, in other words, an ongoing poetic style the arc of which continues to travel through our shared cultural sky. The fĳirst step in the process of exploring such cultural productivity, however, is to acknowledge the plurality of aesthetic practices associated with the word modernism, and hence our choice of “Modernisms” as a title. At the same time, commonalities do exist among modernist practices in the Chinese cultural record, and part of our goal will be to provide lucid descriptions of what these entail. One notable example is the relationship between cultural production and the social, or even political, self-positioning of artists and writers across the twentieth century, a fundamentally ambivalent or even contradictory status, given modernism’s clear association with progressive modernity, and its coterminous association with an “art for art’s sake” disafffection with social programming in general. This important contradiction inherent in modernism’s status as strand, strain, or shade of modernity is not of course particular to China, but is more pronounced in a Chinese context where modernization was taken to be a matter of survival, a national mission, and not simply a frivolous aesthetic pursuit. The early thrust of this activity was the social and political “selfstrengthening” operation designed to keep China intact just as a multitude of outside pressures sought to literally tear it apart. The end of the nineteenth century in China, then, is the story of fĳinding the best mode of governing that would enable the culture to keep its essential identity while changing enough in practical terms to enter the international community as an equal. It was\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nnot until establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 that such stability was reached, and in exchange for that stability China sacrifĳiced most of its freedom of expression with the establishment of a strict cultural policy concerning what could appear in public record.8 Not surprisingly, when the reins were loosened ever so slightly in 1979, and the stirrings of cultural change began in fĳits and starts around Beijing and other major Chinese cities, it was immediately “modernism” that emerged, for the reformers, as a style rich with new potentialities and, for the censors and others attempting to control cultural and other discourse, the quintessential signal of the erosion of the commitment of artists and writers to the common good. We hope that our volume amounts to more than one more replaying of “the game of origins” (i.e., attempting to identify the specifĳic moment when a discrete “Chinese modernism” can be said to properly start and from which a single “it” develops). Instead, by tracing multiple modernist trajectories from roughly the era of May Fourth modernization through the twentieth and into the twenty-fĳirst centuries, we provide a sufffĳiciently variegated account of poetic practices related to modernism to achieve something approaching a comprehensive view, much of which has not been published before in English, and certainly not in one volume. As we approach the contemporary period in particular the need for such a study is ever more acute given the rapidly shifting status of China as a geopolitical cultural force. After decades of centripetal absorption of everything from technology to political systems, China is now exerting considerable centrifugal influence on the outside world. The degree to which this influence will be soft, meaning cultural as well as economic and political, remains to be seen. But at the very least, China’s newly emergent high position on the global stage means that a review of its cultural record in the modern period is needed. It will be upon this cultural record that subsequent steps are taken by Chinese cultural producers of all kinds, poets included. This is also to say that it may well be time to turn the tables on modernism, to look again at this strain of cultural production now moving in the other direction, from the heretofore peripheral (China/East Asia), now increasingly central, and the heretofore central (Euro-American West), now arguably moving toward the periphery. To return again to one of the central features of the global dynamic as observed by Ezra Pound in his important work Guide to Kulchur, the fragments are now “dispersing” in the opposite direction, a fact 8 The strictures on literature and art in particular were laid down by Mao Zedong in his “Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art” and have remained until the present day. For a translation and comprehensive introduction, see Bonnie S. MacDougall, Mao Zedong’s Talks at the Yan’an Conference on Literature and Art.\n\n6\n\nManfredi AND Lupke\n\nthat makes the question of the globality of such writers such as Xi Chuan 㾯ᐍ (b. 1963), Bei Dao ेጦ (b. 1949), and other prominent Chinese poets of magnifĳied signifĳicance, voices expressed on globalized stages when the takenfor-granted hegemonic fĳigure of a Western empire fĳinally seems to be moving offf to the wings.9 The arrival of China as a global force happens to occur just as the medium of modern Chinese poetry itself celebrates its centennial. The fact that such an event can be dated (albeit roughly) at all is again testament to the selfconscious quality of Chinese cultural modernity, one that patterned itself upon advancement of the nineteenth century in a process of study, appropriation, and implementation of externally (Western) technological or even political systems. For poets, the task of modernizing their art form has been particularly arduous and self-aware given poetry’s longstanding status as China’s premier expressive medium, the one that gave lyrical voice to the experiences of China’s literati culture since at least the turn of the last millennium. The reform of such a voice, particularly along the lines of an imported aesthetic, resulted in an acute sense of identity rupture, one that can be seen repeatedly in the tentative experiments of early reformers. It was, in fact, in the context of this quest for a new, modern, lyrical voice that modernism was introduced into Chinese poetry. Now, after one hundred years of literary practice, modern poetry’s lyrical subjects stand on solid ground, and poetic modernisms of various sorts have lodged themselves in the cultural record in ways that are secure but also continue modernism’s well-established role of oppositional and cutting-edge poetics. In this volume, we will be exploring the center and the edges of modernist practice in Chinese poetry, providing a combination of historical record and careful analysis of loosely but importantly connected aesthetic practices across a century of poetry writing in Chinese. The collection of essays here is divided into four sections that are to some extent chronological, but also geographical, and, to a lesser extent, emblematic of the diffferences that the respective literary milieu inside and outside mainland China have created. The fĳirst section is mindful of the aforementioned receding horizon one pursues in seeking a concrete beginning point to modernism in China. Nevertheless, it provides copious information and analysis with respect to modernist poetry of the Republican era (1911–1949). The second section highlights modernist poetry from Taiwan, a hotbed of creativity for modernist poetry beginning in the 1950s and continuing for several decades. Each of the chapters in the third section of the book deals with a wide variety of poets and transcends political borders, including works from mainland 9 Ezra Pound, Guide to Kulchur, 82.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nChina, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The fĳinal section provides a reassessment of poetry from the post-Mao era in mainland China, over thirty years of great productivity. The demarcations of epoch and milieu certainly have an efffect on the styles and tendencies of modernist poetry in Chinese. Equally important, given the propensity of modernist authors to articulate themselves through painstaking attention to formal uniqueness and idiosyncrasy, is that we do not want to discount individual voice in considering these poets. Each of the poets discussed in this volume is her or his own person, unmistakably inimitable and dedicated to individual expression. One of the paradoxical characteristics of modernism is the way its proponents have sought to distinguish themselves as much from each other as they do from previous movements and poetic trends. Thus, as editors, we resist the urge to present an overly procrustean view of what constitutes Chinese poetic modernisms. Nevertheless, we still seek to take on the daunting task of examining Chinese poetic modernisms in diffferent periods and locales in an efffort to provide the reader with a comprehensive appreciation of how the past century of poetry has been greatly afffected by this global aesthetic phenomenon. The fĳirst section, “Toward an Origin of Chinese Poetic Modernisms,” begins with Lan Dizhi’s 㯽ἓѻ (b. 1940) classic essay originally published in Chinese in 1986 as the introduction to an anthology of modernist Chinese poetry edited by Lan. It sketches the origins of Chinese modernist poetics from the publication of Li Jinfa’s ᵾ䠁Ⲭ (1900–1976) three collections of poetry that appeared in the 1920s and the later Creation Weekly (Chuangzao zhoukan ࢥ䙐䙡࠺) work of Mu Mutian ぶᵘཙ (1900–1971) and Feng Naichao 俞ѳ䎵 (1901–1983), but devotes most of its space to the poetry found in Les Contemporains. Lan’s chapter takes “pure poetry” as the core feature of modernist practice in Chinese in the mid-1930s and credits this period in the larger development of free-verse Chinese poetry with major innovations in form and method. By “pure” the author means poetry free from particular ideological commitment and without explicit social function. In this respect, modernist poetry is distinct from the realist and formalist poetics against which it draws its primary contrast. Lan also elucidates aspects of a modernist style, namely, anti-lyrical, as overtly sentimental poetry lacks refĳinement, anti-rational, as too much logic inhibits poetic freedom, and anti-inspirational, as ebullient feelings often overwhelm attention to craft. Lan addresses another attribute often associated with Chinese modernist poetry: incomprehensibility. Lan diffferentiates between poetry that is fundamentally huise Ზ⏙ (opaque) and that which is merely “difffĳicult to understand” (nan dong 䴓៲). The opaque, he suggests, has no place in poetry. The difffĳicult to understand, by contrast, follows in the tradition of French Symbolists, and\n\n8\n\nManfredi AND Lupke\n\nparticularly Stéphane Mallarmé, who believed that it is not the poet’s responsibility to clearly indicate or explain what the poem is about. Mallarmé in turn was one of the principal influences on Dai Wangshu ᡤᵋ㡂 (1905–1950), a leading author of Chinese modernist poetry in the 1930s. Poetry that is challenging is ultimately worth the time and efffort to understand. Géraldine Fiss’s chapter offfers a reading of one major modernist poet of the Republican period, Feng Zhi 俞㠣 (1905–1993), illustrating how his work establishes a dialogue with that of prior greats, both Chinese and European. Fiss argues that Feng Zhi expresses in his nonpoetic writings, particularly his collection of essays titled On Goethe (Lun Gede 䄆ⅼᗧ), a poetic-philosophical system of thought that is based on a syncretic fusion of classical Chinese aesthetics (Du Fu’s poetry), European Romantic impulses (Goethe’s thought), and modernist poetic practice (Rilke’s experimental innovations). Fiss presents an analysis of key themes in Feng Zhi’s aesthetic thought and delineates his intertextual relations and indebtedness to Rilke, Goethe, and Du Fu, among whom he perceives a correspondence of poetic ideals. Feng Zhi, similar to Rilke, Goethe, and Du Fu before him, seeks to transcend the surface of concrete objects to bring to light the invisible substrata of deeper consciousness that informs our lives. In order to achieve the Goethean ideal of revealing the “open secret of nature,” Feng Zhi writes “thing-poetry” and employs the Rilkean techniques of “turning point,” “transformation,” “sublimation,” and “pure contradiction.” A reading of Feng Zhi’s Sonnets (Shisihang shi ॱഋ㹼䂙, 1942), in relation to his mature poetic-philosophical thought and Rilke’s Sonette an Orpheus (Sonnets to Orpheus, 1923), illuminates the unique modernist traits of Feng Zhi’s art. Although perhaps a slight misnomer to label the “Nine Leaves poets” (Jiuye shipai ҍ㩹䂙⍮) a group or a movement, since the label was applied much after the fact and not all the poets congregated together for an extended period, the group that has come to be known as the Nine Leaves was most active during the same historical moment (primarily the 1940s) and shared a great many aesthetic qualities and interests. Yanhong Zhu, in her chapter, suggests that the salient commonality among the nine poets who form this group is a hybrid dramatization or “drama-tic synthesis” that rifffs offf two denotations of the term “drama”: fĳirst, the poetry indeed is often written in the form of drama or with dramatic efffect; second, the poetry is oftentimes spectacular and dazzling, containing reconceptualizations of time, memory, and history. Time is manipulated in the work of the poets so that the present, the “Now,” as Zhu terms it, emerges as the nodal point of poetic expression, even though embedded within this preoccupation with the present are resurgences of the past. The “modernism with Chinese characteristics” that Yuan Kejia 㺱ਟహ\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\n(1921–2008), one of the poets and the critical exponent of the group, espouses as their dominant aesthetic seeks to infuse modern Chinese poetry with Western modernist poetics and sensibilities. We often see past, present, and future coexisting in the work of the Nine Leaves through what Yuan describes as “nonlinear, spatial logic.” This, for the Nine Leaves, is the essence of New Poetry (xinshi ᯠ䈇), something that defĳies the linear, temporal orientation of preceding poetic work. Not surprisingly, the Nine Leaves poets are some of the best educated and most erudite of modern Chinese literary fĳigures, and all are urban based. The past-present duality is further explored in Dian Li’s chapter concerning “classical echoes” in modernist poetry. Thoroughly undermining the sense of rift upon which much modern discourse is developed, Li locates essential “building blocks” of the modern poetry program within classical poetics. Taking, for instance, shiyi 䂙᜿ (poetic-ness) as an essential trope, Li explores the ways in which a modern poem, while seeming to labor in the shadow of classical poetics, actually more often than not returns to modifĳied classical models to advance formal and other innovation. At the heart of Li’s discussion, then, is a challenge to the zero-sum contest between modernity and tradition, where the modernist poem can succeed only when tradition has thoroughly receded. In fact, as Li demonstrates through a review of work beginning in the contemporary context of Wang Xiaoni ⦻ሿ࿞ (b. 1955) but then working back through May Fourth-era discussions of form in poetry, the Chinese poetic tradition continues to exert considerable influence in modern and modernist poetics throughout the history of the genre of New Poetry. The best example of the classical echo is the modern sonnet, itself an important formal experiment in the development of New Poetry. Part two of the volume, titled “Modernist Poetry from Taiwan,” offfers three essays on modernist poetry published in Taiwan, both by poets who were born in mainland China and immigrated to Taiwan during the Civil War period and by those born and raised in Taiwan. Michelle Yeh’s chapter, which principally addresses the work of a single author, Xia Yu (Hsia Yü) ༿ᆷ (b. 1956), begins with a review of each of the six moments during which modernist style held sway in Chinese poetry. This review spans the urban centers of Shanghai in the 1930s (Modernist school), to Taiwan in the same decade (Le Moulin group), on to Kunming (Southwest Associated University poets) of the 1940s, back to Taiwan and Hong Kong for coterminous modernist movements, and fĳinally the post-Cultural Revolution surge in modernist writing in mainland China. In the process, Yeh advances the importance of a fully historicized reading of this literary history, necessary because transnational application of literary-historical nomenclature often does not account for the fundamental\n\n10\n\nManfredi AND Lupke\n\nvariability and elasticity of its categories. For instance, the internal logic of Chinese poetic modernism permits a much closer proximity between that style and romanticism, against which Euro-American modernism is studiously opposed. Similarly, and more to the point for Yeh’s analysis of Xia Yu, is the fact that modernist/postmodernist divergence is not very acute or, in some respects, even useful, which is to say that Xia Yu’s work often demonstrates an important blend or overlapping of the two literary styles. Building on Michelle Yeh’s work on Xia Yu, Chen Fangming’s 䲣㣣᰾ chapter sets out to account for a paradoxical aspect of Yu Guangzhong’s ։‫ݹ‬ѝ (1928–2017) poetry: the twin features of modernism and traditionalism that pervade his work. Chen argues that Yu Guangzhong neither rejected nor wholeheartedly embraced modernism. Rather, his stance is better characterized as a critical acceptance of modernism, a position that includes an adherence to its fundamental tenets, such as individualism, an existentialist view of life, and a skeptical regard of industrial progress on the one hand and, on the other, a rich devotion to traditional Chinese imagery and symbolism. Chen compares Yu to some of the modernists in Taiwan of the 1950s who advocated a clean break with the past. Yu, by contrast, never sought such a dramatic divestment of traditional aesthetics and literary techniques. Chen suggests that Yu charted his own course in reconciling the salient tenets of modernism with a lyricism that he retained from traditional Chinese poetry, especially Song dynasty ci 䇽. His poetry of this period also presented a unique sense of the self. In the process of establishing his distinctive poetics he unavoidably crossed pens with other writers, including Luo Fu ⍋ཛ (1928–2018). The polemics that arose in poetry circles at the time fully illustrate that the modern poetry written by Chinese émigrés to Taiwan after the War of Resistance was far from a monolithic entity. Pivotal to Chen’s argument is an exposition of how Yu evolved from a poet who in the 1950s largely followed the trends of other modernists into someone who came to eschew such stereotypical modernist topics as exile and alienation as his poetry evolved. A much more characteristic topic of Yu’s mature style is the theme of life afffĳirmation, a subject that went against the generally dour grain of many modernists. As other poets regarded traditional culture with disdain, Yu came to celebrate it, fashioning intertextual relationships between his own work and that of many of the ancients, including Qu Yuan ቸ৏ (c. 340–278 BCE), Wang Wei ⦻㏝ (699–759), and Su Dongpo 㰷ᶡඑ (1037–1101). Like others of his era, his poetry reveals a deep distaste of war and an attempt to seek refuge away from it in intimate, human embrace. His opposition to the Vietnam War, for instance, is evident in poems such as “Double Bed” (“Shuangren chuang” 䴉Ӫᒺ) and “In the Event of a Distant War” (“Ruguo lianfang you zhanzheng” ྲ᷌䚐ᯩᴹᡠ⡝). Ultimately, Yu elects to celebrate\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nreconciliation with the various phenomena of his contemporary environs— including modernization in Taiwan, the status of traditional Chinese culture and literature, and the state of mainland China—over the themes of exile and abandonment. In the process, he forges a complicated, variegated poetic oeuvre that is both a continuation of modernism and an extension of localism. Modernism in postwar Chinese poetry from Taiwan is generally considered to be associated with poets born in mainland China who fled to Taiwan near or at the end of the Civil War in 1949. But the fact that modernist poetry is understood to be an overwhelming feature of the mainland refugees masks the fact that many nativist Taiwanese poets were associated with modernism as well. The nativist or “homegrown” poets who convened and founded the Bamboo Hat poetry group (Li shi she ㅐ䂙⽮), in 1964, though often considered to be primarily “realist” poets and often lumped in with “nativist” or “localist” writers, actually had extensive afffĳinities with modernism and modernist poetry. Ruan Meihui’s chapter on the Bamboo Hat group and its journal illuminates the connections between the modernists and the Bamboo Hat poets. Ruan begins with a detailed description of the complex historical background from which the journal emerged. From there she argues that the Taiwan modernists were fundamentally diffferent from Euro-American, or even Japanese, modernists, because in the latter case modernism had an opportunity to percolate through intellectual circles over decades; whereas in Taiwan, as Ji Xian declared in his 1956 manifesto, modernism was enacted by a process of “horizontal transplantation,” one that could happen suddenly, and at any time. The Bamboo Hat poets founded their eponymous Bamboo Hat (Li ㅐ) journal in 1964 with twelve principal members. Several of these poets were already active in one or more of the three aforementioned poetry societies, having honed their modernist skills long before joining to form the journal. The fluid quality of many of the literary encampments is one misunderstood aspect of Taiwan’s literary history that Ruan seeks to redress. The other is that the journal Bamboo Hat itself was antagonistic to modernism. Ruan provides detailed documentation of various articles, both those originally written in Chinese and those in translation from English, French, German, and Japanese, primarily, to refute this notion. Bamboo Hat poets sought to further extend and modify the evolution of modernism in Taiwan by making it more germane to the precise historical, social, and culture specifĳicities of the island. Bamboo Hat was influential in translating and publishing the manifestos from European literary movements such as Andre Breton’s “Surrealist Manifesto,” F. T. Marnetti’s “Futurist Manifesto,” and Richard Aldington’s “Six Beliefs of the Imagists.” What is often overlooked, however, is that Bamboo Hat established its heritage with previous groups by featuring a number of poets not in the Bamboo\n\n12\n\nManfredi AND Lupke\n\nHat group numerous times over the years. They also published analyses of some of these poets’ works. In spite of these connections, there is certainly no question that the Bamboo Hat coterie moved the line on modernist poetry in Taiwan. Their contribution in reestablishing the link between the Japanese Colonial (1895–1945) and postwar eras in Taiwan as well as highlighting the work of Japanese modernists in their journal stands out as a distinguishing component of their contribution. The Bamboo Hat poets certainly were more engaged with the social issues of the moment in Taiwan in a way that many of the émigré Chinese authors were not, at least not initially. Several articles in the 1960s spoke of the need for poetry to zhenji ⵏ᫺ (strike truth) or of the need to be “truth striking.” By this, the Bamboo Hat poets stressed sincere adherence to life as it was lived at the time in Taiwan; it needed to be empirical. But it also needed to be “modern,” in the sense of being of the times as well as exhibiting the broader characteristics of modernism. Ruan offfers the most substantial, subtle, and evenhanded scholarly presentation of the relationship between those most closely associated with modernist poetry in Taiwan and the nativist poets who formed the Bamboo Hat poetic society. “Bridging Borders in Contemporary Poetry,” the third portion of our volume, contains three chapters that focus on particular stylistic tendencies or thematic propensities that transcend the boundaries of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Nikky Lin’s chapter does what few scholars seem willing to do: it compares a Taiwanese poet with a contemporary mainland Chinese poet. Her paper begins exploring similarities between poetic modernism in Taiwan in the 1950s and that of the so-called Misty or Obscure poets who began writing in China during the 1970s. The return of modernism in the post-1949 era was one of the most prominent literary phenomena in both Taiwan and mainland China: in Taiwan, this reemergence began in the mid-1950s when the government’s interference in art and culture was at its peak; in China, it happened in the late 1970s, shortly after the Cultural Revolution had ended. The rise of modernism in the post-1949 era on both sides not only signaled a break from the political-literary orthodoxy of the day, but was also indicative of a new pursuit of what poetry should be. However, rather than emerging from a highly developed industrial society as it had in the West, the return of modernism in Taiwan and later in China had a strong and specifĳic political element, a corrective to policies that creative writers found oppressive or at least detrimental to the development of their art. For instance, the feelings of “confĳinement” and “exile” are two of the most signifĳicant themes in Taiwanese and Chinese modernist poetry. Lin describes how modernism motivated Taiwanese and\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nChinese poets to broaden poetry’s aesthetic dimension and delve into alienation of the individual, as well as conflicts between the individual and society. She compares the two sides’ unique experiences in regard to this transformative time. By focusing on two modernist poets who experienced physical exile, one Taiwanese and one Chinese, Shang Qin ୶⿭ (1930–2010) and Bei Dao, respectively, she examines how descriptions of “confĳinement” and “exile” are not only a reflection of their own personal experiences caused by historical circumstances, but also serve as pathways to explore the universal state of human existence. And it is therein that the poets’ challenge to what poetry should be can be found. One of the conundrums of modern Chinese literary studies is how to navigate the tortuous road between the particular cultural heritage from which it arises, the global phenomena of such trends as modernism, and the individual creative voice. Some take the tack that indigenous culture and Westernization are mutually exclusive. Others emphasize the need to view Chinese modernism as part of a global trend in which cultural and national specifĳicities are at best superfĳicial, cosmetic, and incidental. In this chapter, through a discussion of specifĳic poems from William Butler Yeats and the three Chinese poets Wu Xinghua ੣㠸㨟 (1921–1966), Luo Fu, and Xiao Kaiyu 㩗ᔰᝊ (b. 1960), Christopher Lupke advances the view that it is precisely the ability to mine the native landscape, transforming it into the rejuvenated imagery of a modern form, that makes contemporary Chinese poets modernist in style and outlook. Utilizing Yeats as a signpost, Lupke suggests that it is not only Asian authors who bridle against the converging trends of modernization. Yeats, who saw himself as residing on the margin, engaged in a battle to maintain and resurrect the myths and narratives of his own cultural heritage. Yeats himself worried about becoming a poet whose verse could be interchangeable with that of anyone in any other language. Facing the same predicament in the second half of the twentieth century, some Chinese poets have also turned to the Chinese tradition with its history, beliefs, and stories and used it as a reservoir for their artistic endeavors. An analysis of modern Chinese poets afffords a picture of complicated, even conflicted, feelings toward the modern predicament that are best articulated through a hybrid style. Rather than asserting a historically deterministic thesis that Chinese authors are influenced by Yeats in a tightly causal sense, Lupke asserts that in some ways their situations were similar, their grievances were shared, their thoughts resound with a certain amount of afffĳinity, and they all possess a desire to express themselves in the somewhat controlled linguistic idiom of verse rather than in a more expansive\n\n14\n\nManfredi AND Lupke\n\nmode of narrative. Lupke concludes that Yeats’s work, preoccupations, and methods of resolving his troubles in writing have some kinship with those of a number of modern Chinese poets. In the 1950s the wave of modernist experiments in Chinese poetry was marked by Ji Xian’s launch of Modern Poetry Quarterly (1953) in Taiwan and Ronald Mar’s 俜䛾 (b. 1933) publication of New Trends in Literature and the Arts (Wenyi xinchao ᮷㰍ᯠ▞ 1956) in Hong Kong. Both Ji Xian and Mar called for a continuation of the May Fourth generation’s project of literary reform and promoted the development of “Chinese modernism” or “new modernism” in poetry writing. Literary works produced during this phase showcase daring experiments with new poetic forms and the Chinese language. Since the use of the vernacular seemed to guarantee the “newness” in New Poetry or modern poetry from its inception, colloquialism and nonconformism in language use has become one of the keys to modernism in the Chinese literary scene. To offfer a fresh perspective to the study of Chinese modernist poetry, Lisa Wong’s chapter looks at how some representative poets writing in Taiwan and Hong Kong—namely, Shang Qin, Luo Fu, Huai Yuan ␞䚐 (b. 1950), Ye Si ҏᯟ (1949– 2013), and Xi Xi 㾯㾯 (b. 1938)—have explored the linguistic possibilities of an almost invisible part of vernacular speech (measure words) in their poems published from the 1960s to the 1980s. By comparing the conventional syntax and pairing of measure words in the received Chinese classifĳier system with the modernists’ application of it to poetry writing, she argues that these poets’ innovative use of measure words has contributed artistically and in terms of technique to seeing things anew by a twist of grammar, using a poetic device unique to the Chinese language. Our fĳinal section turns to mainland Chinese poetry of the post-Mao era, offfering four papers that reconceptualize contemporary poetry in China. We begin with the chapter by Nick Admussen, who addresses recent work on network theory as it bears generally on research in the humanities, and specifĳically on poetry circles in contemporary China. Before looking at Chinese poetry, though, Admussen thoroughly and critically examines the limitations of data-based analysis. Such analysis, in Admussen’s view, “actively performs modernization and globalization on its objects, deforming nonmodern and local materials into parts of a modernist narrative.” With attention to the etymological origins of the “network” itself, a metaphor that is “centrally materialist and commercial … and which has also evolved to accept a top-down, imaginative imposition of order onto a variety or experiences,” Admussen redeploys focus on the “slippage, lacunae, and aporia” that not only delineate the limits of network analysis but also provide fertile ground for exploration of modernist expression. One of Admussen’s essential insights is that nodes are\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nnot only homogenous in many cases, but actually entirely overlapping, where the very same people act in completely diffferent capacities in the social milieu that is contemporary poetry circles. The author then envisions the possibility of a data-based system that allows for necessary switches among categories (in network analysis amounting to shifting dynamics of node-to-edge relationships), accounting for poets who host poetry festivals, business executives who compose and perform at poetry events, and all points in-between. His reconfĳiguration of nodes and edges of network analysis redeems commodity-based hermeneutics and points us toward something that strikes closer to the heart of the contemporary poetry community in China today. Jacob Edmond is interested in the implications of recent scholarship on imaginings of China in Western modernism for reading what Marjorie Perlofff calls “twenty-fĳirst-century modernism.” If, as this scholarship argues, the concept of modernism itself is inseparably bound up with Western modernist imaginings of China, how then do these imaginings play out when they are reimagined by a contemporary Chinese poet such as Yang Lian ᶘ⛬ (b. 1955)? And what models for conceptualizing cross-cultural interaction, translation, and modernism itself do these reimaginings offfer, other than discredited notions of mimetic reproduction and authenticity? Edmond revisits the entwinement of Chinese and Western modernisms and the mutual crosscultural readings and imaginings that inform them by examining the work of contemporary Chinese poet Yang Lian and especially his collaboration with Canadian poet John Cayley. Yang and Cayley share a fascination with Ezra Pound’s translations of Chinese poetry and his and Jacques Derrida’s influential texts on the Chinese language. In their collaborations, they combine theoretical thinking about the Chinese language with a variety of translational and quasi-translational rewriting practices. In Cayley’s digital reworking of Yang’s Where the Sea Stands Still (Dahai tingzhi zhi chu བྷ⎧‫→ڌ‬ѻ༴), for example, a text already built on reiterations is subjected to further repetitions and transformations. Yang and Cayley’s work demonstrates that while translation—and Pound’s translations and imagining of Chinese poetry in particular—played a key and much discussed role in the development of English-language modernist poetry, cross-cultural reading and translational and quasi-translational iterative practices occupy an arguably even more important place in twentyfĳirst-century modernisms. If Edmond’s chapter seeks to shatter the prism through which we have viewed modernist poetry from the West, inverting the paradigm and reflecting on how one Chinese poet reappropriates the classic modernist trope that absorbs Chinese imaginings into itself, the last two chapters in this volume transgress the bounds of media, with Lucas Klein’s chapter placing modernist\n\n16\n\nManfredi AND Lupke\n\nChinese poetry into an architectural context and Paul Manfredi establishing connections with visual art. But Klein’s chapter is not so much about a comparison of Chinese poetry with architecture, although it is that, as it is a meditation on an aesthetic internationalism and new sense of world literature to which he sees Chinese poetry as having a profoundly interventionist strategy. Taking the work of Xi Chuan 㾯ᐍ (b. 1963) as his primary example, and as chief translator of Xi Chuan’s work Klein is intimately familiar with it, he treats modern Chinese poetry as something that resides at the intersection of language, national identity, and memory. He offfers the reader a thorough reprise of modernist and postmodernist architecture, including examples from contemporary China. But his main goal is to indicate how modernist aesthetics allows both for its own rootedness in the local and its continuous reinvestigation of its own history. Xi Chuan views modernism as an ongoing project, and he establishes an erudite dialogue in his work with the multifaceted works of literary and philosophical fĳigures throughout the world. Paradoxically, though, Xi Chuan’s dialogue with the world is “ultimately a dialogue with ourselves,” as he dispassionately observes in one of his most important poems. The conclusion is that no poet in the contemporary world can be shut offf from the world. On the contrary, he or she must reconstitute the matter to which he is exposed into something that is deeply unique and personal, something that functions on an international, a national, and an individual level all at once. Klein’s chapter provides several close readings of important poems by Xi Chuan to exemplify how this is accomplished. The fĳinal chapter of the volume, by Paul Manfredi, focuses on a recent convergence or mutuality of visual and verbal expression in the twenty-fĳirstcentury Chinese poetic context with specifĳic regard to abstract expressionism. Since the year 2000 a strong link has been forged between plastic art and the world of poetry in China, mostly due to the number of poets who are now engaged in visual art production. Their intermedia expressions are akin to modernist practices of the early twentieth century in the West, particularly extensive cross-fertilization, visual and verbal, in texts by William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, and other Imagists. By focusing on specifĳically abstract expression, in both visual and verbal format, Manfredi explores a key facet of poetic innovation in contemporary Chinese literary scene. The Western connection to such art is easily the most visible, as iconic asemic expressions of concrete poetry or even visual art work of Franz Kline are immediately recognizable in the painting of notable contemporary Chinese artists, particularly of the ink brush variety. Manfredi encourages us to recognize, though, a broader visual context for Chinese contemporary poetry that is fĳirmly connected to older traditions. From at least the ninth century but arguably long\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nbefore in China, creative practice both in terms of production and reception was marked by habitual traveling across media (from poetry to painting and calligraphy), often occurring in the same work. Moreover, in many instances literati expression was as much a function of the art displayed as it was a demonstration of the artists’ degree of self-cultivation on extra-artistic levels. By reading contemporary poetry and visual art together, we can observe many contemporary Chinese poets returning to such a holistic mode of cultural expression, one that envelops innovation necessary to the contemporary global context into a milieu of writing and reading that demonstrates inherent cognizance of practices ancient in origins but still relevant. Manfredi’s chapter takes three such fĳigures, poet and abstract painter Lü De’an ੲᗧᆹ (b. 1960), critic, poet, and abstract photographer Yang Xiaobin ὺሿ☡ (b. 1963), and painter, poet, and abstract art theoretician Xu Demin 䁡ᗧ≁ (b. 1953), as points of focus. However, the shared poetics of these three fĳigures is one with considerably wider implication and, Manfredi predicts, long-term influence. By gathering these various discussions, stitching together geographical, temporal, and stylistic features across roughly an entire century of Chinese poetic production, we are able to obtain a complete and complex picture of the multifarious elements known collectively, if sometimes contradictorily, as “modernism” in Chinese poetry.\n\npart 1 Toward an Origin of Chinese Poetic Modernisms\n\n∵\n\nchapter 1\n\nThe Origins and Historical Development of the Modernist Poets Lan Dizhi 㬍ἓѻ Translated by Paul Manfredi\n\nThe Modernists (Xiandaipai ⧠ԓ⍮) were a group of poets who espoused a style of pure poetics relatively early in the development of what is now called Chinese New Poetry (xinshi ᯠ䈇).1 Their work came to prominence in the early 1930s, found its apogee during the middle years of the same decade, and quickly receded shortly thereafter. The “Modernist” name comes directly from the literary arts journal Xiandai ⧠ԓ (Les contemporains, or “The Modern”), where the poets’ work was fĳirst published. The journal was founded by Shi Zhecun ᯭ㴠ᆈ (1905–2003) in January of 1932, immediately following the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, and it ran under the coeditorship of Shi and Du Heng ᶌ㺑 (1907–1964) for a period of two and a half years. Shortly after the journal’s founding, Shi proclaimed that Xiandai “does not risk politics,” and “always takes a middle road.” The journal’s primary motivation, in other words, was commercial rather than political and, in an efffort to meet all tastes, it became nearly kaleidoscopic in nature. Thus, the poems published in Xiandai were stylistically not entirely consistent. However, from both the philosophical\n\n1 Editors’ note: This article by Lan Dizhi was composed in 1983, then revised and published in 1985, a moment in Chinese literary history when the rigid, ideologically inflected policies of artistic expression in place since the founding of the People’s Republic were fĳinally giving way to more nuanced and in-depth readings of Chinese writing. This relatively liberal moment, however, was quickly followed by a conservative backlash, and “modernism” was one of the major points of contention between those who wanted, in essence, more autonomy and freedom of expression in the arts and those who were determined to maintain a strict communist line. We can see in Lan’s essay both forces contending, with sometimes overly enthusiastic praise for modernist writers followed by seemingly contradictorily negative readings of the movement as a whole. Nonetheless, the work is an important step forward in critical discourse concerning literature in general and modernist poetry in particular toward the end of the twentieth century. As a product of that era, the citation style of the original article is diffferent from current expectation. Thus, some diffferences in citation, such as the omission of page numbers for footnoted items, reflects this earlier style.\n\n© koninklijke brill nv leiden 2019 | doi:10 1163/9789004402898 003\n\n22\n\nLan\n\nand artistic points of view, the poems did share enough commonality that a single critical term for describing them, “Modernist,” came into being.2 Other journals were also involved in publishing writing of this style. The poetry that appeared in the literary magazine Huoxing ⚛ᱏ (Mars, October 1934 to March 1935) edited by Bian Zhilin ঎ѻ⩣ (1910–2000) was similar to Xiandai in its push for a new wave of poetic development. In October of 1936, Dai Wangshu ᡤᵋ㡂 (1905–1950), with participation from Bian Zhilin, Feng Zhi ߟ㠣 (1905–1993), Sun Dayu ᆉབྷ䴘 (1905–1997), and Liang Zongdai ằᇇዡ (1903–1983), began editing Xinshi ᯠ䈇 (New Poetry) magazine, bringing a modernist poetic style to its highest point of achievement. At about the same time, numerous other journals appeared, for instance Xiandai shifeng ⧠ԓ䈇仾 (Modern poetry style), Xiandai wenyi ⧠ԓ᮷㢪 (Modern literature and art), Shizhi 䈇ᘇ (Poetry intent), and Xiaoya ሿ䳵 (Elegentia), all demonstrating the spread of this new poetic style. Responding to such a development, Lu Yishi 䐟᱃༛3 (1931–2013) put it this way: The years 1936 and 1937 were the Golden Age of Poetry after the beginning of the May Fourth Movement. During that period, poetic activities in all quarters were lively, and writers of great talent and creative productivity gave rise to a kind of cultural renaissance. Apart from Shanghai, others in Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and such cities all saw relatively small-scale poetry journals and poetry-centric journals that focused on pure literature.4 The style of these various literary journals was actually relatively consistent. In a reference note, Xiaoya editor Wu Benxing ੤྄ᱏ (1913–2004) observed: “for many years, our poetry circles have been desolate beyond belief, the poem’s form becoming a kind of poetry-cum-prose, a bent-out-of-shape creation. But in 1936, a group of pure poetry advocates took an art for art’s sake position, opening up the fĳield of poetry to something very diffferent from the years before.”5 From the point of view of literary development, 1936 and 1937 were the pinnacle of poetic maturity in modernist poetry and indeed an important stage in the entire history of poetry in modern China. However, the “Golden Age” of Chinese modernist poetry was also completely cut offf from the surge 2 Sun Zuoyun, “Lun Xiandaipai shi.” 3 This is the pen name of Lu Yu 䐟䙮, who in the 1950s, writing under the new pen name of Ji Xian ㌰ᕖ, became editor of the influential Xiandaishi jikan ⧠ԓ䈇ᆓ࠺ (Modern poetry quarterly). 4 Lu Yishi, “Sanshi zishu.” 5 Wu Benxing, “Shezhong renyu.”\n\nThe Origins and Historical Development of the Modernist Poets\n\n23\n\nof nationwide resistance to Japanese aggression, in particular the pivotal and patriotic student demonstrations in December 1935. By July of 1937, the cannons of the War of Resistance could be heard across the country, making the concerns of “pure poetry” entirely out of sync with the needs of the age. As a consequence, poetry groups fractured and poets began stepping out from their ivory tower, fĳinally forming new groups to take up positions against the Japanese aggressors. The modernist wave of poetry thus accordingly receded. In the history of literature, major trends or stylistic waves do not emanate from the subjective will of a single artist; in essence, artistic waves stem from the social conditions of the time combined with a given author’s own ideological state of mind. At the same time, literary waves have deep historical origins as they must issue from accumulated changes within the broader trends of literary and artistic production. Even if an author’s advocacy comes to fruition, such advocacy still falls obliquely within a longer trend, making it impossible for any single artist to take full credit for changes in literary style. Although the Xiandai editors proclaimed “no plans to advocate for the creation of a particular literary group,” they also observed that the poems submitted to the journal for publication should “bear some stylistic similarities or common characteristics.”6 These words precisely express the emergence of a literary style, demonstrating deep roots that even those involved themselves did not fully understand. The modernist style in Chinese poetry neither emerged nor receded suddenly. As a literary group, the Modernists were the direct inheritors of a style developed in the 1920s by Symbolist poets led by Li Jinfa ᵾ䠁ਁ (1900–1976) and then later the Creation Society poets Mu Mutian ぶᵘཙ (1900–1971), Feng Naichao ߟѳ䎵 (1901–1983), and Wang Duqing ⦻⤜␵ (1898–1949). In the mid-1920s, Li Jinfa published three poetry collections in succession. In the introduction to his fĳirst collection, Weiyu ᗞ䴘 (Light rain), he stated: “As to the whole of the poetic form, there no doubt will be those who are not happy with the result, but that is not important.” His concern in writing poetry, he explained, was to “express everything.” In the colophon to the poetry collection Shike yu xiongnian 伏ᇒҾࠦᒤ (Visitor in hard times), moreover, he expressed hope for fĳinding “the fundamental root” that would allow him to have Western poetry and Chinese ancient poetry communicate and come to an accord. Li was not satisfĳied with the dispassionate quality of classical Chinese verse, nor with what he considered the absurd scenes that arise from the mere collection of images. He felt that between Chinese and Western poetry there were commonalities of thought, spirit, vision, and even content, and that there was no 6 Shi Zhecun, “Xiandai zayi.”\n\n24\n\nLan\n\nsuperior or inferior to speak of.7 Thus, behind the impenetrable compositions by the “Poet Strange” Li Jinfa, these perspectives are all at work. Li Jinfa’s “expression” of art drew most directly from the symbolist method of French poet Paul Verlaine. His poetry is like pieces of a broken pagoda, or scattered bright pearls, fragments that are obscure and abrupt, full of fantasy and replete with sentimentalism and exotic flavor. What Li refers to as “classical Chinese poetry” is largely that of the late Tang, works written in the mode of Li Shangyin ᵾ୶䳡 (c. 813–858), Wen Tingyun ⑙ᓝ㆐ (812–870), and other poets. It is particularly in this realm that we do in fact fĳind classical Chinese poetry and Western symbolist poetry sharing strong afffĳinity. This is also to view the matter from the angle of so-called pure poetry, an approach that later proved great inspiration for the Modernists. Before Li Jinfa, and even in the pervasive atmosphere of realism in Chinese poetry circles, many writers in fact were already looking to symbolism as a new method. Hu Shi 㜑䘲 (1891–1962) once observed that poetry that can “break through the stupidity of facts” is good poetry.8 Zhou Zuoren ઘ֌Ӫ (1885–1967), unsatisfĳied with the incessant “boringly blank descriptions,” believed instead that bi ∄ (metaphor) and xing ‫( ޤ‬analogy) are the better avenues to success, and that xing really corresponded to what was known as “symbol” in the West. Guo Moruo 䜝⋛㤕 (1892–1978) believed that “real literature and art is a symbolic world generated by rich experience further sublimated by a pure spirit.”9 In sum, a change that served to correct the overemphasis on realism was brewing in many forms at the time. From the perspective of the West, symbolism was a response to naturalism. At the end of the nineteenth century, realism had evolved into naturalism. Symbolists denied the notion that outer reality could be mechanistically imitated, and instead advanced the expression of inner worlds, believing that therein could be found a deeper reality. From another point of view, symbolism is also a refutation of romanticism, even though many characteristics are in fact carried over from romanticism. For instance, the leading Modernist poet, Dai Wangshu, who began writing in the years between 1922 and 1924, observed that “at the time there was a widespread phenomenon of wanting to express the self, to express wildly, to express directly, using a bold and urgent style as a model. In our hearts we harbored a strong rebellion against this trend.”10 Dai Wangshu studied French from 1925 to 1926, and read 7 8 9 10\n\nLi Jinfa, Shike yu xiongnian. Hu Shi, Hui de feng. Guo Moruo, Guo Moruo, wenyi lunji. Dai Wangshu, Wangshu cao.\n\nThe Origins and Historical Development of the Modernist Poets\n\n25\n\nVerlaine’s work in the original. It was from Verlaine’s work that Dai found a path that would resist the “direct and plainspoken” tendency of the time. The Modernists at the same time also inherited the so-called pure aspect of traditional Chinese poetics. Bian Zhilian said that “intimacy” and “implicitness” were two common points connecting Western symbolist and traditional Chinese poetics.11 In Tan xinshi 䈸ᯠ䈇 (On New Poetry, 1948), Fei Ming ᓏ਽ (1901–1967) observed that the Modernists developed out of the tradition of Wen Tingyun and Li Shangyin. He believed that Li’s and Wen’s poems were like sifted gold nuggets; lively, with full range of imagination and free expression, these poems were solid like sculptures, giving the reader a feeling of concreteness. The poetics of Wen and Li that Fei Ming promoted in his writings were a direct refutation of Hu Shi’s style. Hu Shi advocated a poetics of Bai Juyi ⲭት᱃ (722–846), Su Dongpo 㰷ᶡඑ (1037–1101), and others, while the Modernists argued for a continuation of Wen Tingyun and Li Shangyin, therefore markedly diffferent from the road taken in the early stages of the vernacular poetry movement. Liang Shiqiu ằሖ⿻ (1903–1987) maintained that Hu Shi’s standard for poetry writing was a kind of mere comprehensibility or “understand-ism,” but Hu’s corrective was overly correct. According to Liang, “now it is no longer a question of the words of poetry, but a question of poetic substance itself.”12 Again, this was the pure poetry of symbolist poetics, and it was the kind of poetry that the Modernists wanted to write. From one point of view, the Modernists’ arrival on the poetry scene meant the displacement of the Crescent Moon group (Xinyuepai ᯠᴸ⍮) led by Xu Zhimo ᗀᘇ᪙ (1897–1931). From another point of view, though, Modernists can be seen actually continuing the same trends established by the late stage of the Crescent school. Thus, if we take Crescent’s poetry published in Morning Poetry Supplement (Chenbao shijuan Იᣕ䈇䳭) as a kind of classicism, then, coming to the later period, works that appeared in Shikan 䈇࠺ (Poetry), there was indeed a new trend toward symbolism. In poems such as “Taishan” ⌠ኡ (Mount Tai), “Miaoxiao” ⑪ሿ (Miniscule), “Beiwei” ঁᗞ (Petty), “Huangli” 哴呲 (Oriole), and “Ji Hou” ᆓ‫( ى‬Season), Xu Zhimo gave expression to new and subtle feelings. Wen Yiduo 䰫аཊ (1899–1946), publishing in Shikan, contributed a long poem titled “Qiji” ཷ䘩 (Traces), a startling work that appeared after a three-year hiatus from writing. The startling quality, moreover, was precisely to be found in the poem’s symbolist method. Lin Huiyin ᷇ᗭഐ (1904–1955) and Zhu Xiang ᵡ⒈ (1904–1933) also wrote symbolist poetry at the time, while Sun Dayu’s long poem “Ziwo Xiezhao” 㠚ᡁ߉➗ (Self-portrait) 11 12\n\nBian Zhilin, “‘Wei’erlun yu xiangzheng zhuyi’ yixu.” Liang Shiqiu, Guanyu Lu Xun.\n\n26\n\nLan\n\nwas characteristic of the “intricate consciousness” of the modern person. Bian Zhilin was also transitioning from English Romanticism to Symbolism, fĳinding friendly relations. In sum, it would not be wrong to say that the Modernists were actually an amalgam of the Crescents and Symbolists. Symbolism, however, is not a sufffĳicient concept to explain the characteristics of the Modernists in the literary historical record. Modernist poet Fan Cao reflected on this, saying that the poetry he loved was one that drew from both romanticism and symbolism in the matter of poetic substance. He observed that if there is no romantic sentiment, the poem will lack emotional spirit; if there is no symbolist rendering, the poem will have no form.13 Du Heng, in commenting on Dai Wangshu’s poetry, noted both symbolist form and classical content, and strict avoidance of empty sentimentality or falsehoods. Fan Cao also takes Dai Wangshu as a model for modernist expression, not of the “English department approach,” but instead as a blend or summation of the styles of romanticism, Parnassianism, and symbolism. A modernism so construed is the same as the movement in poetic modernism that took root in Latin America, but which also developed in Spain itself and other Spanish-speaking locales. Du Heng once recalled that he and Dai spoke at length about the Spanish Modernists, and that in Dai’s poetry about loneliness and love he could see the projection of many of the Spanish writers. Whether or not the entire Modernist group could be described as having this characteristic is of course another question, but in the poetry of Dai Wangshu, at least, in addition to Verlaine and others, we can certainly see the influence of Spanish writers.\n\n1\n\nThe Characteristics of the Modernist Group\n\nIf we begin to examine more closely the modernist wave, we fĳind that each poet has his or her own characteristics, and that each situation is quite different. Lin Geng ᷇ᓊ (1910–2006) moved from writing modern free verse to classical, rhymed poetry, because he came increasingly to see the commonalities between classical and modern poetics. Hou Ruhua ‫( ॾ⊍ן‬1910–1938), Chen Jiangfan 䱸⊏ᐶ (1911–1970), and Jin Kemu 䠁‫ݻ‬ᵘ (1912–2000) can be found traveling from writing poetry heavily laden with classical sentiments and images to modernist poetry, this transition forming something of a common practice in poetry of the period. The poetry by Shi Weisi ਢছᯟ that 13\n\nQuoted in Zhong Dingwen, “Wo suo zhidao de Dai Wangshu ji Xiandaipai.”\n\nThe Origins and Historical Development of the Modernist Poets\n\n27\n\nleaves the strongest impression is his modernist work exhibiting emotions of hermetic experience. Li Xinruo ᵾᗳ㤕, meanwhile, uses a modernist lens to view rural life, and also wrote of the disorientation and chaos caused by life in the city. The long poems by Li Guangtian ᵾᒯ⭠ (1906–1968) and Fan Cao contain a relatively high amount of descriptive content that is a blend of symbolist and realist methods, seemingly foreshadowing the future development of modernist poetics. As an editor, Shi Zhecun was focused on the image, looking for poetry that would express subtlety and contingent experience, without explanation or observation. Clearly, Dai Wangshu’s work was the outstanding model of this style, with its soft and beguiling lyrical power combined with just a hint of adornment. Ling Jun’s ⧚ੋ style, though, was also perspicuously beautiful, while He Qifang’s օަ㣣 (1912–1977) was full of lovely color and swaying postures. Poems by Fan Cao and Li Baifeng ᵾⲭࠔ (1914–1978) were one half symbolist and one half romantic, lyrical expressions that made fully transparent the poets’ psychological states. Bian Zhilin’s work was like sculptured jade and gold, indirect but warm, portentous, and limitless, like treasure troves in poetic form. In sum, we can see that each poet came to the movement with his or her own distinct characteristics. Despite the fact that the Modernists did abandon the style of cryptic mysticism typical of Li Jinfa’s work, for readers accustomed to romanticism and classicism, modernist poetry was still rather challenging to understand. Generally speaking, the poetry of Dai Wangshu was relatively easy for contemporary readers to read, but works such as “Leyuan niao” Ҁഝ呏 (Garden bird) and even “Yuxiang” 䴘ᐧ (Rain alley)—poems that are heavily infused with symbolist meaning—also proved difffĳicult to comprehend. The French Symbolist Mallarmé once said: “To clearly indicate one’s subject is to take away three quarters of the pleasure that poetry has to offfer.” When Dai Wangshu started writing, he believed that the motivation for poetry was in the combination of expressing and concealing the self at once. In recalling a dream, one discovers an ego buried in the unconscious, whereas in a poem one reveals the buried and secretive soul. In either case what is revealed must remain at least partly obscure. Dai’s later poetry became a way of escaping from the realities of life, fabrications that were too remote for the average reader to easily grasp or identify with. Bian Zhilin’s “Yu huashi” 劬ॆ⸣ (Petrifĳied fĳish), as another example, is full of allusions from both the Western and the Chinese literary traditions, with free associations of his own devising but no explanation, making it almost impossible for a reader to fĳigure out. However, on the level of the sentence, Bian’s poems can be read, and the scenes depicted are concrete, as in:\n\n28\n\nLan\n\nYou stand on the bridge looking at scenery, A sightseer stands on the tower looking at you The moon adorns your window As you adorn another’s dream. ֐ㄉ൘ẕкⴻ仾Ჟˈ ⴻ仾ᲟӪ൘ᾬкⴻ֐Ǆ ᰾ᴸ㻵侠Ҷ֐Ⲵデᆀˈ ֐㻵侠Ҷ࡛ӪⲴỖǄ\n\nAfter reading this, we feel that we have understood, but on reflection we realize that we do not understand completely, and the deeper we go, the more the possible implications proliferate. It is due to situations just like this that Shi Zhecun observed: “just as when we read essays and do not demand full comprehension, when reading poetry a general grasp is sufffĳicient.”14 He believed that the question of understanding or not understanding is fundamentally not a question of the author, but one of the reader, and the question of the reader is again whether or not s/he understands the “substance” of the poem, which is to say understands the diffference between poetry and prose. The English scholar William Empson, writing in Cambridge in the beginning of the 1930s, produced a book called Seven Types of Ambiguity. Empson’s work had broad and lasting influence, exploring the phenomenon of ambiguity in Western poetry from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries with more than two hundred examples. A number of readers derived from Empson’s work that ambiguity has been part of literature for centuries, being in fact a basic feature of literary practice. The untitled works of Li Shangyin even today make readers dizzy with incomprehension. The poems that Empson uses as examples combined with Li Shangyin’s untitled works are precisely what the Modernists inherited as a style, thus a misty ambiguity is unavoidable. Literary periodicals of the time engaged the question of ambiguity or opacity in literature quite seriously. Zhu Guangqian ᵡ‫( ▌ݹ‬1897–1986) felt that the social function of literature could not be dismissed, and thus ambiguity could not be an ideal for poetry. From his point of view, ambiguity in poetry could not but be a form of pollution. For clarity’s sake, though, Zhu advocated replacing the dichotomy between clear and ambiguous with that between understandable and incomprehensible. Ambiguous poetry is indefensible. Poetry that is difffĳicult to understand, on the contrary, has its rightful place. The purpose in taking “understanding” as the main point of his analysis 14\n\nShi Zhecun, “Haishui libo.”\n\nThe Origins and Historical Development of the Modernist Poets\n\n29\n\nwas to move the question away from the literary work itself and refocus it on the specifĳic relationship between work and reader. True appreciators of poetry, Zhu maintains, will each have their own psychological condition, and the degree of understanding of a poem is thus diffferent in each case according to the reader’s experience, training, and personal interest. Some blocks in communication are the failure of the reader’s imagination to accept uncanny associations, breakdowns that are difffĳicult trace because the would-be imaginative associations are buried initially deeply within the unconscious. For the sake of the entire modern poetry movement, Zhu felt that poets and readers alike needed to take time to reflect on who or what is in fact responsible for the breakdowns in communication.15 Lin Geng felt that poetry is a mediation between the normal and the startling, the former being like the beauty of the setting sun—a wonder that is still part of everyday life. The latter, meanwhile, is like “tears falling from a pearly moon above a pale sea, or the jade sun born from smoke above blue fĳields,” something that stands outside everyday experience.16 Modernist poetry, in terms of its art, had a number of clear characteristics. First, the Modernists opposed direct lyrical expression. Even if we take the more sentimental examples of the Modernists’ poems, for instance, Bian Zhilin’s “Petrifĳied Fish,” He Qifang’s “Yuyan” 亴䀰 (Prophecy), or Dai Wangshu’s “Wode lianren” ᡁⲴᙻӪ (My lover), and we compare them with Guo Moruo’s “Ping” ⬦ (Vase), Xu Zhimo’s “Feilengcuide yiye” 㘑ߧ㘐Ⲵаཌ (A night in Florence), or the works of the Lakeside poets, we can clearly see that the Modernists did not bother to reveal their inner emotions, and they are not providing an explanation of their feelings. Instead of empty lyrical idealism, Modernists created distinct poetic shapes and images that indirectly demonstrate, through the use of implication and metaphor, their state of mind. By the late 1930s, Xu Chi ᗀ䘏 (1914–1996) had taken the position that lyricism must be banished from the realm of poetry entirely. Lyricism is beauty, but that can come only after renovation and renewal of this world, this society. At the time of composition, the banishment of lyricism was constructive, and the presence of lyricism was actually destructive, especially in a time of war.17 Anti-improvisation is the other major characteristic of the Modernist poets. A good percentage of old-style poetry was based entirely upon improvisation and inspired allusion. Such serendipitous, question-and-answer poems take the scene as occasion to inspire poetic feelings, and this, according to the 15 16 17\n\nZhu Guangqian, “Tan huise.” Quoted in Ke Ke, “Za lun xinshi.” Xu Chi ᗀ䘏, “Shuqing de fangzhu.”\n\n30\n\nLan\n\nModernists, is too heavily dependent on wit and subjectivity. Real emotion, they believe, does not derive from the scene, as the scene is only the objective correlative found by the emotion. The fĳirst pass of emotion cannot stand alone as poem; it is only the poem’s basis. The Modernist poet monitors his or her own emotions from a distance, adjusting their moods, carefully transforming these emotions into images, sounds, and words. The purpose is to give the feelings more depth through restraint, their expressions thus becoming more deeply evolved and expansive. Given this tendency of the Modernists, any attempt to read the authors biographically through their poetry is untenable. The third characteristic of modernist poetry is its anti-logical quality. This characteristic demonstrates modernist poetry’s fundamental departure from classical, realist, epigrammatic, and philosophical poetry. According to the view of these authors, modernist work is designed not to move people’s emotions, but to inspire their deep contemplation, to bring about truer unifĳication of emotion and thought. Poets worked from studious observation of universal humanity, an observation they accumulated and developed over long periods of time. When the fruits of such observation meet an instant of inspiration, poems are produced, without deliberate intervention by the poet. At this point the poet himself cannot explain the poem, as to do so would amount to writing prose, not poetry. This is why conventional logic cannot be used to explain poetry. There is one view that the principal meaning of a poem is precisely that which cannot be translated or paraphrased. Around the year 1935, Bian Zhilin wrote a number of works including “Juli de zuzhi” 䐍⿫Ⲵ㓴㓷 (Organization of distances), “Bai luoke” ⲭ㷪༣ (White snail shell), and other such poems that led to labeling his poetry “huise” Ზ⏙ (opaque). This is because these poems cannot be interpreted according to the logic of daily life. The poems are a form of structural thinking, taking novel ideas and theories and making with them a kind of revelatory writing wherein juxtapositions of space and time, like entire worlds in grains of sand, or oceans in drops of water, can be seen. These poetic principles are then merged with new scientifĳic ideas (e.g., the Theory of Relativity and four-dimensional thinking) and further combined with the poets’ own long-standing observations of human emotions, collectively becoming the basis for their poems. From the point of view of more traditional poetics, these three characteristics of the Modernists can be reduced to the correspondence of complicated imagery and marvelous concepts. The anti-inspiration and anti-lyricism of modernist poetry is better understood then as the use of images to express emotion, a method of indirect expression, which objectifĳies emotions without squandering them. The French poet Paul Valéry (1871–1945) has said that a naked emotion is just as weak and vulnerable as a naked individual. Such\n\nThe Origins and Historical Development of the Modernist Poets\n\n31\n\na person should be given clothing, and the clothing is precisely the poetic image. In rejecting excited, automatic writing, poets should let their own emotions flow back, and work with them using a distant or dispassionate point of view. In this way, they are able to transparently transform emotion into image. Modernist poetry, particularly in the early years of its development as part of New Poetry, was often referred to as “lyrical imagism” for just this reason. If we look at the Modernists’ most representative works, we fĳind that their poetic images do indeed harbor complex emotions. They express the subtle moments of human experience where ancient and modern, foreign and indigenous, mutually flourish, their respective times and places becoming one. The explanation-laden poetry of the May Fourth period is crystalline and thorough, while the Modernists’ conceptual poetry harbors dense ambiguity, difffĳiculty, a lingering aftertaste, and echoes. The Modernists’ poetry uses images to make suggestions, simplicity to pursue richness, limits to pursue limitlessness, all in a misty state. However, we also must admit that some tendencies of the Modernists were imitative, and their approach of completely eschewing lyricism or denigrating outworn romanticism wound up also destroying a good deal of the romantic spirit of poetry itself. In terms of artistic form, the Modernists carved their own path, creating a free verse style that had prose-poetic beauty. Dai Wangshu’s “Shilun lingzha” 䈇䇪䴦ᵝ (Scattered notations on poetry) clearly laid out the program. Dai believed that the major focus of reform effforts should not be changes in poetic line or form, but poetic sentiment. The question of rhyme is not one that is located in shifts in cadence at the end of lines or stanzas, but in the changes in sentiment at the end of lines or stanzas. Poetry, Dai thought, should be rid of musicality.18 In fact, this idea was expressed by Guo Moruo even before Dai Wangshu mentioned it. Guo observed that internal rhyme derives from the mind and not from the body. Poetry can be said to have the “spirit of music,” but it is not music per se.19 Dai Wangshu, at the beginning of his writing career, was also in pursuit of a formal beauty, endeavoring to make New Poetry into something that could be sung or “intoned” in the manner of ancient poetry. From the point of view of the evolution of form in New Poetry, the Modernists’ challenge was directed toward the Crescent school’s advocacy for poetry’s formal beauty. The Crescent poets’ contribution to the formal development of New Poetry occupies an important place in Chinese literary history and should not be underestimated. That said, when their poetic style ceased to advance and became ossifĳied, its limitations and failings grew all 18 19\n\nDai Wangshu, “Shilun lingzha.” Guo Moruo, “You shi de yunlü shuo dao qita.”\n\n32\n\nLan\n\ntoo conspicuous, as commented upon by Xu Zhimo himself. Dai Wangshu’s accomplishment was to fĳind a poetic practice that could take the place of a strict formal pattern. His poem “Wode jiyi” ᡁⲴ䇠ᗶ (My memory) is a work that exhibits a kind of prose-poetic as its signature formal feature. Dai’s views on poetry are a continuation yet also an important augmentation of 1920s Symbolist poets’ views. Symbolism in China was fĳirst pursued by Li Jinfa, but there was no theory to accompany it. From a theoretical point of view, the beginnings were introduced by Mu Mutian, Wang Duqing, and Feng Naichao. Mu Mutian’s view of a “pure poetry” was one that emerged in a literary space and time characterized by acute attention to both formal and musical beauty. Wang Duqing’s “pure poetics” relied heavily on color and music to advocate for an art-for-art’s-sake aesthetic; his poems are like crystal balls falling onto plates of white jade. Feng Naichao used sonorous rhythms to achieve a hypnotic efffect. Dai Wangshu both absorbed these techniques and refĳined them. Given that the inclination of a prose-based, free verse poetry was to approximate vernacular speech, it had a great deal of flexibility, and was thus able to express a modern sensibility. It also tracked well to the pure poetry trend that was prevalent in Europe, and in this way amounted to a natural critique of the Crescent school’s excessive attention to form. Looking historically, the Modernists wrote a good many excellent poems, amassing a rich body of artistic work that continues to inform writers all the way down to the present day. However, this poetic wave itself also clearly moved beyond its accomplishment as a poetic style, entering a period of decadence, ossifĳication, and then total dissipation. The later poems by Dai Wangshu lost the crispness and clarity of vernacular speech, becoming too laden with foreign allusions and unnatural classicisms; his one-time prose beauty had become prosifĳication. With the advent of the War of Resistance to the Japanese, the conditions that had allowed urban intellectuals in relatively peaceful small cities to freely advocate “modern feeling” and “pure poetry” were no longer available. Before long, the People’s War of Resistance exploded in all areas of the country and the popularization of poetry became more widespread. Many of the Modernists fled from the cities that fell to Japanese aggressors and became more focused on poetry for the people, developing renewed interest in poetry recitation, and poetry returned to more clear meters and structures. Talking about Xiandai, Shi Zhecun once observed that the journal publishes only purely modern poems, ones that exhibit modern emotions of modern people stemming from experiences of modern life. Looking across the Modernists’ poetry, we can see that what is meant by “modern people” is actually a group of young intellectuals who had been strongly influenced by Western ideology and modernist literature; they lived in big cities, were highly educated, and were\n\nThe Origins and Historical Development of the Modernist Poets\n\n33\n\nnot engaged in either government or other mundane work. Looking at their social position and way of thinking, they were upper-class petty bourgeois members of society. What is called “modern life” really amounted to living in the socially warped half-feudal, semicolonial environment. What they referred to as “modern emotion” was really just sentimentalist, confused, hypersensitive, hallucinatory nihilism. It has long been said that there is only one kind of health, while there are myriad forms of sickness. The Modernists’ poetry gives the reader these myriad forms, allowing decadent emotions to spread, delighting in pain, remorse, tears, and romanticizing sadness. Their poetry takes too much interest in personality; it concentrates an entire world of poetic feeling into an individualized subjective wish, pursuit, and sentiment—the “I” of the poem is the core. Such intense subjectivity makes their work too remote from the realities of life, with no concern for what is really happening. Even with these general criticisms in mind, whether on the emotional or philosophical levels, we cannot say that the Modernists have absolutely no positive signifĳicance. The sad tone of the Modernists is in fact also a genuine and notable product of their time and place. They could see no clear path for society, could not divine a strong voice of the age. Instead, they used their fĳinely tuned mournful sensibilities to meld an individual-based experience with the sadness that surrounded them. Their disappointment and disafffection with political afffairs and their sense of loss in the increasingly disfĳigured urban environment all coalesced into a broader condition or malaise shared by people at large.\n\n2\n\nThe Evolution and Evaluation of the Modernists\n\nAt the very mo"
