Fields which are added locally to name authorities from LC should should conclude with $5CaAE to prevent removal by BSLW overlaying. If overlaid by EPL staff using SmartPort, the additional fields, whether or not identified with $5CaAE, will not be preserved.\n\nGenerally, EPL concurs with the national libraries for establishing names, but EPL does have local policies which dictate changes in some national library authority records (see Changes to LC and LAC AUTH records).\n\nIf names in these fields are not available from national library files in the form required, cataloguers should request a new local authority from a cataloguing librarian. Failure to complete this step will mean mis-validation and/or mis-cuttering on physical library materials may occur, e.g.\n\n099 CD ROCK CON\n\n100 1 Fulber, Rhys (Backstage using LC preferred form)\n\n245 10 Exilarch [sound recording] /$cConjure One.\n\nValidation will occur on LC's authority file for Fulber, Rhys, who sometimes uses the name Conjure One. In this case, a local authority for Conjure One is required to prevent mis-validation.\n\n099 CD ROCK CON\n\n100 0 Conjure One (Local authority)\n\n245 10 Exilarch [sound recording]|cConjure One.\n\nPolicy for Cataloguing Librarians\n\nLibrarians will be responsible for making name authority modifications and resolving name problems, such as adding a cross reference and/or a 670 note as well as contacting LC with requests for corrections.\n\nNames are established according to RDA with local policy exceptions noted in a 670 note; new 4XXs and 670s can be added to LC authorities and each field added must be signed $5CaAE to prevent removal by BSLW overlaying; if overlaid using SmartPort, local fields will not be preserved.\n\nEPL's vendor of authority services,Backstage Library Works (BSLW) will attempt to validate all remaining headings against (1) our local authority file first, then (2) LC headings, then finally on (3) LAC headings.\n\nBSLW will generate reports on validations which require review and on headings that remain unvalidated.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAuthorities & Vendor-supplied Cataloguing\n\nFor Physical Objects\n\nIf a cutter does not seem appropriate for the authorized access point, check the bibliographic record for headings which affect cuttering. If reviewing the work for other reasons, such as DDC or intellectual level, also check the headings which affect cuttering.\n\nIf such headings doNOT validate, search WorkFlows for any possible authority record.\n\nIf a match is found for the correct name, the access point can be validated against the existing authority record using the Browse, Get From List, and Next commands.\n\nIf modifications need to be made to an authority in our file, refer it to a cataloguing librarian; new 4XXs and 670s can be added to LC authorities and each field added must be signed $5CaAE; modifications can be made to locally-created authorities without signing each field. Do not import a national library authority to overlay and update an existing record if a change in the form of the authorized name will occur e.g. Binshtock, Avital when updated becomes Andrews, Avital. Refer this situation to a cataloguing librarian for creation of one or more local authorities to replace a national library authority in our file.\n\nLibrarians must report to BSLWany new local authorities created to replace any LC or LAC authorities being deleted from EPL's authority file.\n\nIf validation does NOT occur after searching and finding an appropriate authority in our file or after importing a new national library authority into our file:\n\nRecord the appropriate national library authority form of name in a bibliographic record. (BSLW should download authority records ifneeded for new cataloguing.) If using a national library authority for subject validation, check that the fixed field “Subj_Use” in the authority record is an “a”.\n\nCheck the coding in the bibliographic record, that is, check that the correct codes and indicators have been used for the name. For example, field tag 110 used for a personal name will not validate; fictitious characters may now be coded 600 instead of 650.\n\nFor name subject validation check that the 6XX indicators in the bibliographic record are correct that is, the second indicator may be a zero for LC) a 5 for LAC and a 7 with subfield $2CaAE for local authorities.\n\nIf no appropriate authority is found in in our local file in WorkFlows nor from LC or LAC via SmartPort, refer to a cataloguing librarian for a local authority. Request a new authority sending a screen-print of the title record and any information quickly available on the work:\n\nE.g. born 1979 in Sussex, England from About the author\n\nE.g. teaches psychology at New York State University, Buffalo from book jacket.\n\nE.g. author is a joint pseudonym for mother X and son Y from title page verso\n\nA cataloguing librarian maycopy and pasteauthoritiesfrom LC's website (https://authorities.loc.gov) if necessary; authority records fromSmartPort's LC file may be omitted from time to time or not available within the monthly span covered by BSLW.\n\nBack to Top\n\nFor Digital Works\n\nBibliographic records will be loaded without regard to validation; Backstage will attempt to validate and report on unvalidated headings and headings which may be mis-validated (Report: 1XX/6XX/7XX |a first 4 characters differ).\n\nDelete all subfield “e” content from 1XX and 7XX fields before loading.\n\nBecause digital works do not have cutters, validation of entries and changes to authorities can be done at any time.\n\nBack to Top\n\nVerifying Authorities\n\nAlways verify that the authority is correct, even if it validates:\n\nAlways check the name authority file in WorkFlows for the correct form of name, that is, do not allow a name to validate without checking the authority file first.\n\nDetermine if an appropriate authority already exists in WorkFlows.\n\nSearch national library authority files and if necessary request creation of certain local authorities.\n\nNotes:\n\nA bibliographic record must exist in WorkFlows before requested authority work will be done by a cataloguing librarian.\n\nFor unvalidated corporate bodies with subdivision(s), search WorkFlows and SmartPort for the complete name as well as each part of the name.\n\nWhen searching in WorkFlows, watch for inconsistent forms of name for an author (i.e. several citations of the same name).\n\nBack to Top\n\nChanges to LAC and LC Authority Records\n\nNational library (LAC, LC) authority records are generally established according to RDA although some will still be coded as AACR2. Local authorities are required when national library authorities do not yet exist or when EPL local policies as listed below apply.\n\nIf a downloaded national library record requires additional information that does not affect access, make additions and add a brief 667 explanatory note if necessary. Fields such as 4XX and 670 added by EPL should be identified with $5CaAE to prevent removal by BSLW overlaying. If overlaid by EPL staff using SmartPort, the additional fields, whether or not identified with $5CaAE, will not be preserved.\n\nEPL POLICY: EPL prefers to use the form of the name used on each public work and may need to over-ride a national library authority.\n\nIf an LAC name authority recorddiffers from the form of an LC authority prefer the LC form (unless there is a reason to override the LC form by creating a local authority); add 4XX reference for heading not used as well as 667 explanatory note. E.g.\n\n667 LAC prefers Trudeau, Pierre, Elliott, 1919-2000 (1012L9855E).\n\nIf important information is provided in either national record, transfer it to the new local authority.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCreating a Local Authority Record\n\nGenerally use the chief source of information as source for 1XX form of name -- make 4XX references from all other forms found on item and any other required 4XX and 5XX references, refer to section on Cross References for Names.\n\nDo not rely entirely on one source of information for the form of name – confirm within the item and often with external sources as well, e.g.\n\nDVD with on-screen credits and container listing of performers Sarah Naylor, violin, and David Millar, piano\n\nNo external confirmation for David Millar; Sarah Naylor's duo partner is Douglas Millar\n\n100 Millar, Douglas|c(Pianist)\n\n400 Millar, David|c(Pianist)\n\n670 E-mail from DVD publisher (Q. Who is David Millar; what became of Douglas Millar? A. “this is a mistake that was not spotted … I am surprised that Sarah or Douglas did not say anything but please amend your records”)\n\nComplete the Control folder:\n\nRecord format = Corporate/Personal/Title\n\nSource = CaAE\n\nDate authorized = Today\n\nAuthorization level = Authorized\n\nCreated by = EPL-CAT [system-generated]. The “Extended Info” folder is not used.\n\nIf an error is generated due to 1XX heading not matching the record format, change the format in the Control folder before making changes in the authority folder.\n\nDelete the system-generated 961 overlay field if not required when using the “Duplicate Authority” wizard to generate a new authority record.\n\nAll new authority records should contain at minimum one 670 field providing title information; add additional information about 1XX heading from the item-in-hand, and if considered important, check other online sources for information, e.g. role performed by the person: illustrator, inker, etc.\n\nWhen possible, add 670 note for the nationality of fiction writers as this is important information for the Canadian author note used in fiction bibliographic records.\n\nConfirm form of name found on DVDs in an online source such as IMDb.com (Internet Movie Database) before establishing; generally prefer name as given in IMDb if there is a discrepancy in the spelling of the name.\n\nConfirm the order of Asian names in an online source -- the recognized surname will often be given in capital letters.\n\nGenerally Icelandic names are given in direct order, e.g.\n\n100 |aSverrir Guðjónsson,|d1950-\n\nIf using 1XX form from a national library bibliographic record, code f.f. Srce appropriately and/or provide brief note.\n\nAdd |d dates to personal names if readily available from a reliable source; document source in 670 note.\n\nGenerally do not establish geographic names (151) but do download if available; when a geographic name authority is required, e.g. variant form(s) of place name exist, refer to librarian responsible for subject headings to have name established.\n\nAdd explanatory qualifiers (Musical group), (Musician), (Firm), (Comedy troupe), etc. to 1XX as required.\n\nDistinguishing terms used in personal names:\n\nDistinctive names do not require further details; often the first use of a name will lack any details beyond the “title page form of name.” Accept names when established by LC/LAC without distinguishing terms, e.g.\n\nPrince (n 84079379)\n\n400 |aNelson, Prince Rogers\n\nTatiana (n 93112858)\n\n(a Mexican vocalist)\n\nPoghosian, Michael (no2010036507)\n\n400 |aPogosyan, Mikael, 1965-\n\nAdd date of birth/death or identifying other names, if available, to a personal name, preceding subfield d with a comma but no punctuation before subfield q, e.g.,\n\nHerge,|d1907-1983\n\nGiovanni|q(Giovanni Marradi)\n\nBlond|q(Kevin Senft)\n\nRobson, Ann P.|q(Ann Provost),|d1931-\n\nIf a name is not obviously a personal name, add an explanatory qualifier in parenthesis, e.g.,\n\nRiver|c(Writer)\n\nDream|c(Musician)\n\nFor most given name entries (i.e. without a surname), add an explanatory qualifier in parenthesis (|c), e.g.,\n\nMoses|c(Biblical leader)\n\nEminem|c(Musician)\n\nSailaja|c(Telugu poet)\n\nAlex|c(Vocalist)\n\nLegendary Stardust Cowboy|c(Musician)\n\nAlice|c(Fictitious character from Carroll)\n\nFor generic names with surnames (i.e. where 2 or more people use the same form of name in our authority files), and where dates are not available, use an explanatory qualifier to the degree of specificity available or necessary, indicating vocation. Do not precede the qualifier with any punctuation, e.g.,\n\nSmith, John|c(Captain)\n\nBarnes, James|c(Gardener)\n\nHill, Lynn|c(Founder of the Clandestine Cake Club)\n\nCunliffe, David|c(Cellist)\n\nUse will be made of any of these qualifiers to make unique entries for each name and to distinguish between otherwise identical names having a surname, e.g.\n\nBlack, James, 1879-1949\n\nBlack, James, 1950-\n\nBlack, James, 1975-\n\nBlack, James, approximately 1758-1814\n\nBlack, James|c(Auctioneer)\n\nBlack, James|c(Drummer)\n\nBlack, James H.|q(James Hay),|d1921-\n\nBlack, J. W.|q(James Whyte),|d1924-2010\n\nx-ref Black, James Whyte …\n\nIf a name lacks a surname but is commonly associated with a place of origin or domicile, an occupation or title, or other information, include these words or phrases as an integral part of the name. Precede such words or phrases by a comma.\n\nPaul,|cof Aleppo, Archdeacon,|d1627-1669\n\nFrancis,|cPope,|d1936-\n\nElizabeth,|cEmpress of Russia,|d1709-1762\n\nClinton, Michael,|cM.B.A\n\nBack to Top\n\nProcedures for Creating a Local Authority\n\nCreate a local authority record by duplicating a national authority record (or by copying/pasting LC/LAC information to a new local record).\n\nState why EPL is not using the LC/LAC form in a 667 or 670 note:\n\nE.g. “LC (or LAC) prefers ______ (Control #); EPL prefers the form on each published work.”\n\nEdit the 1XX to EPL's preferred form of name - often this means transferring 4XX information into the 1XX and vice versa, but do NOT delete the entire 1XX\n\nRemember to remove the text DUPLICATE AUTHORITY from the 1XX\n\nDelete LC's 001, 003, 010 (or LAC's 016)\n\nChange the 040 to CaAE|beng|cCaAE or CaAE|beng|cCaAE|erda\n\nNOTE: If LC/LAC's record, which was duplicated, was not already in RDA format, choose whether or not to add |erda to 040 and also change Rules to z (008 position 10) if using RDA.\n\nRDA fields are all optional additions\n\nChange date to today's date, i.e. YYYYMMDD000000\n\nModify fixed fields: Rev_Eval to a (008 position 29) and Sys/Thes to z (008 position 11) (see image above). Save.\n\nOpen Modify Authority wizard to finish editing\n\nAdd CaAE to Source on the Control panel and set date to Today; copy the control number to paste into 001. Save.\n\nEdit to remove 961 as needed. Use your judgment, making sure that the 961 contains the form that should be replaced overnight. Save.\n\nDelete the LC/LAC record\n\nUse form of name found consistently on fiction works for an author's name that has been transliterated from a non-Latin alphabet if required to provide a recognizable “Cutter” for alphabetic shelf arrangement.\n\nA decision may also be made to correct a national library authority record that is in error, e.g. the form of name given is obviously incorrect (spelling, incorrect/lacking birth or death dates, etc.). Major changes will be referred to a cataloguing librarian who will suggest changes to national libraries. If the error is corrected, Backstage can update the LC/LAC authority in our file. If EPL has used a local authority, Backstage will be informed that the local authority has been deleted and an LC/LAC authority will be substituted (by EPL or Backstage).\n\nDelete any |u coding from the end of 5XX references.\n\nCheck MARC 21 Authority Format for correct |w subfield coding in 4XX/5XX name references. In general, in a personal name authority record, if there is a |w subfield in a 4XX or 5XX field, delete the subfield. In a corporate body name authority record, if there is a |w subfield in a 5XX field coding earlier/later forms of name, retain the letter which is in the first position, and delete the remaining codes, e.g.\n\n110 |aCanada.|bDept. of Agriculture.|bResearch Branch\n\n510|wb|aCanada.|bAgriculture Canada.|bResearch Branch\n\nBack to Top\n\nCreating Reciprocal Local Authority Records\n\nReciprocal local authorities for multiple forms of name are to be used if LC/LAC are using a single form of name when EPL's collection contains the name in varying forms (i.e. pseudonyms, pre-and post-marriage names, secular and religious names, etc.). For example, EPL has works by Lisa Unger under her maiden name Miscione, Lisa, 1970-, as well as under her married name Unger, Lisa, 1970-.\n\nProcedures for Creating Reciprocal Locals:\n\nDuplicate an LC/LAC already in EPL's authority file or newly downloaded via SmartPort.\n\nEdit the duplicate record to state why EPL is not using the LC/LAC form in a 667 note (use cut and paste for accuracy): “LC (or LAC) prefers ___ (n __); EPL prefers the form on each published work.|5CaAE”\n\nIf the LC/LAC form is represented in our collection remove the DUPLICATE AUTHORITY; delete LC's 001, 003, 010 (or LAC's 016); change 040 and 005 as above.\n\nEdit 4XX changing any forms also used in EPL's collection to 5XX, e.g.,\n\nEdit the 4XX to the LC/LAC form and modify the fixed fields Ref_Eval to a (008 position 29) and Sys/Thes to z (008 position 11). Save.\n\nOpen Modify Authority wizard to finish editing.\n\nAdd CaAE to Source on the Control panel and set date to Today; copy the control number to paste into 001. Save.\n\nEdit to remove 961 as needed. Use your judgment, making sure that the 961 contains the form that should be replaced overnight. Save.\n\nDelete the LC/LAC record\n\nDuplicate your newly created local authority\n\nExchange places between the 1XX and the first 5XX; remove the text DUPLICATE AUTHORITY; edit the control panel as above. Save.\n\nOpen Modify Authority wizard to finish editing; remove 961. Save.\n\nRepeat as necessary for all forms used in EPL's collection. Arrange all 4XX and 5XX pseudonyms in alphabetical order, e.g.,\n\nBack to Top\n\nCross References for Names\n\nCross references (x-ref) are made when a person/body is known by several forms of name but the forms in the cross-references are not used on any published works, for example, Sia, 1975- has a cross-reference for her birth-name 400 Furler, Sia Kate Isobelle, 1975- as authorized names.\n\nAdd as required all 4XX and 5XX references and provide 670(s) justifying the reference.\n\nCross references are made for:\n\nCompound names: x-ref from part of name not used, e.g.\n\n100 Fra, Irene, 1971-\n\n400 Fra Gálvez, Irene, 1971-\n\n100 Johnstone-Burt, Hugo\n\n400 Burt, Hugo-Johnstone-\n\nNames with prefixes: x-ref from part(s) of name not used, e.g.\n\n100 Cruz, Gloria de la\n\n400 De la Cruz, Gloria\n\n100 De la Parra, Alondra, 1980-\n\n400 Parra, Alondra de la, 1980-\n\n400 La Parra, Alondra de, 1980-\n\nEPL POLICY: If we learn that an EPL name authority is in error, the authority will be corrected.\n\nE.g. Previously, Ricky Van Shelton's works were cuttered VAN (for Van Shelton, Ricky); we now accept LC's preferred form: Shelton, Ricky Van based on later information which clarified that Van is his middle name. Going forward, his works would be cuttered as SHE.\n\nEPL POLICY: Relabelling should be considered rarely and on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMaiden/married names: x-ref from name(s) not used; see also references if both names used, e.g.\n\n100 Grant, Kathryn, 1933- (the film actress in the 1950s)\n\n500 Crosby, Kathryn, 1933- (Mrs. Bing Crosby, memoir author and actress post 1977)\n\n100 Forss, Sarah Nelson\n\n400 Nelson, Sarah (Sarah Jane) (x-ref must not conflict with another Sarah Nelson)\n\n100 Chen, Justina, 1968- (ceased using married name)\n\n400 Headley, Justina Chen, 1968-\n\nEPL POLICY: EPL prefers local authorities for different forms of name when a person has separate identities at different stages in life or for separate activities or markets (more than transliteration or pseudonyms are involved).\n\nE.g. Denise Ho is a Canadian English-language novelist; her books are cuttered HO. LC's preferred form of name is He, Yunshi, which is used for the same person as a Chinese speaking singer/actress in Hong Kong.\n\nE.g. 12 Girls Band recordings are cuttered TWE; we do NOT use LC's preferred form Nu zi shi er yue fang, since EPL has no titles without English-language credits.\n\nReal name/pseudonym(s): x-ref from name(s) not used; see also references if both (or more) names used, e.g.\n\n100 Eliot, George, 1819-1880\n\n400 Cross, Marian Evans, 1819-1880\n\n100 Everage, Edna, Dame, 1934-\n\n500 Humphries, Barry, 1934-\n\nCommon name/title of nobility: x-ref from name(s) not used, e.g.\n\n100 Disraeli, Benjamin, 1804-1881\n\n400 Beaconsfield, Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of, 1804-1881\n\nFull name/shorter form: x-ref from name(s) not used, including nicknames, e.g.\n\n100 Ivy, 1966-\n\n400 Bielinski, Ivan, 1966-\n\n100 Healey, John, 1973-\n\n400 Healey, John Britt, 1973-\n\nName as established/title page form: x-ref from name(s) not used, e.g.\n\n100 Chan, Jaycee, 1982- (actor/martial artist Jackie Chan's son)\n\n400 Fang, Zuming, 1982- (since 2004, this is his name in the Eastern Hemisphere; in the West he is “Jaycee Chan”; credits may list both forms of name)\n\n400 Chan Jo-Ming, 1982 (birth name)\n\n100 Healey, Kevin\n\n400 Healey, K. (Kevin) (author uses only an initial on some published works)\n\n100 Illés, Monika\n\n400 Phillips, Monika\n\nLC prefers Phillips, Monika … ; EPL prefers the form on each published work.\n\nVariant spellings: x-ref from name(s) not used, e.g.\n\n100 Caṭṭopādhyāya, Śaratcandra, 1876-1938\n\n400 Chatterji, Saratchandra, 1876-1938\n\n100 Tchaikovsky, Peter Ilich, 1840-1893\n\n400 Chaikovsky, P. I., 1840-1893\n\nEPL POLICY: EPL accepts forms used by LC/LAC if the variation from title page form arises because of a different scheme of transliteration applied.\n\nAcronyms/initialisms (corp. bodies): x-ref from name(s) not used or name spelled out. E.g.\n\n110 UNICEF\n\n410 United Nationals International Children's Emergency Fund\n\n410 U.N.I.C.E.F.\n\nmake x-refs for initialisms both with and without periods/spaces [SIRSI currently files a period as a space] as they will file differently, e.g. K.T.A.S. and KTAS. E.g.\n\n110 Ukrainian Canadian Committee\n\n410 K.U.K.\n\n410 KUK\n\n110 L.T.D. (Musical group)\n\n410 LTD (Musical group)\n\nDo not establish corporate bodies with periods if work being catalogued does not use periods. RDA prefers to transcribe punctuation as it appears on the source (RDA 1.7.3), adding punctuation only as necessary for clarity.\n\nDirect order names: x-ref from name reversed, e.g.\n\n100 Gunnar Guðbjörnsson (an Icelandic name)\n\n400 Guðbjörnsson, Gunnar\n\n100 Auntie Owl\n\n400 Owl,|cAuntie\n\nName with date to name without a date (and vice versa): use only if date (or name without a date) used by a national library that is a non-preferred source. Ensure that no conflict results from 4XX. E.g.\n\n100 Trudeau, Pierre Elliott, 1919-2000 (LAC's preference)\n\n400 Trudeau, Pierre Elliott (LC's preference)\n\nNote: An EPL authority was created to reconcile LC and LAC (N.B. LC is preferred at EPL and since 2018 LAC does not keep a separate authority file; its English-language authorities shouldagree with LC; add local notes to LC authorities signed $5CaAE to add Canadian details)\n\nMake x-ref from form of name used by a national library when local policy prefers a different form of name – add 667 or a 670 note for clarification. E.g.\n\n100 T. I., 1980-\n\n500 Harris, Tip, 1980-\n\nLC prefers T. I., 1980-; EPL prefers the form on each published work.\n\nBack to Top\n\nFamily Names\n\nIf a national library authority record uses the form of name on the item as its 100 form of name, use the authority record regardless of number of cross-references; but if the form of name on the item only appears as one of the cross-references in the source record, establish the name originally in WorkFlows.\n\nE.g. Form of name on item: Schmitt family\n\nLC establishes the name as:\n\n100 |aSchmidt family\n\n400 |aSchmitt family\n\nEstablish the name originally in WorkFlows, or consider using: 600 Schmitt, Thomas|xFamily instead of 600 Schmitt family if better identification is provided.\n\nBack to Top\n\nPseudonyms\n\nWhen establishing a pseudonym as an authority heading, make a cross-reference to the real name if known (add a 4XX or a 5XX, as appropriate), e.g.\n\nIf the real name is established with dates, use dates in the headings for the other names.\n\nFictitious characters, including animals, are generally considered pseudonyms, even if the \"real\" author's name is unknown.\n\nBack to Top\n\nNon-unique or Non-distinctive names (RDA 8.3)\n\nNames should be made unique and distinctive; differentiate one form from another “by recording as many of the additional identifying elements as necessary in the following list:\n\nTitle of the person (indicating rank, honour or office),\n\nFuller form of name,\n\nProfession or occupation,\n\nPeriod of activity, and/or\n\nOther designation associated with the person.”\n\nBack to Top\n\nPreferred titles for a musical work (RDA 6.14.2), for a legal work (RDA 6.19.2) and for sacred scriptures (RDA 6.23.2.5)\n\nAuthorized access points (author-title) are downloaded/established only for classical music and laws/by-laws/regulations. Laws can be the result of any number of enacting jurisdictions. E.g.\n\n110 United States\n\n245 The narcotic laws of Mexico and the United States… from the United States of America, Mexico, the State of California and the State of Baja California.\n\nAuthor-title entries are used but not need be validated for literary criticism.\n\nPreferred titles are downloaded/established only for anonymous classical music, collected legal documents, such as treaties and collections of treaties, and sacred works, e.g. Bible, Koran.\n\nUse language subfield (l) for classical music and sacred works only.\n\nBack to Top\n\nUniform Titles for Classical Music\n\nUse a reputable, outside source for establishing the title portion of composer-composition title uniform titles. Grove music online is now available as an EPL database through Oxford music online. For required uniform titles, refer to Classical Sound Recordings, Composers/Uniform Titles.\n\nTitles of compositions are given in the original language of composition (not necessarily the nationality of the composer). If original language of composition cannot be determined, establish with language of the item in hand providing an explanation in a 667 note.\n\nDo use the transliterated title of composition for titles that have been transliterated from non-Latin alphabets, e.g. Cyrillic (Russian, Ukrainian, etc.) or Chinese.\n\nEnsure that a 400 uniform title reference is made for any variant form of title found in the title in hand.\n\nCross references for arias. Make a 400 reference for the composer and aria, omitting the name of the opera. Derived LC headings for part titles often require extra 400 references in the form of Composer-Title of opera-Variant part title. Add additional 400s to national library records as required.\n\nMake a 670 note for any useful available information from the item in hand or appropriate online source that expands upon uniform title, e.g. opus no., number of movements, titles of parts of a suite, etc.\n\nLC authority records for some uniform titles, usually collective titles, e.g. |tPiano music.|kSelections, often contain numerous 400 references for all the item titles in which the uniform title was found. Delete these unwanted references (but do not delete actual variant titles) and add a brief 667 note, e.g. 667 |ax-refs deleted. |5CaAE [No longer possible with BLW as they will reinstate original LC records).\n\nFollow RDA for formulating uniform headings for two or more parts of a musical work e.g. Nr. 5 is the preferred title for a part of Johannes Brahm's Ungarische Tänze in a compilation also including Nr. 6 of the same work. There is an alternative rule to identify two or more parts collectively. Record the conventional collective title and Selections as the preferred title for the parts unless the parts form a group called a Suite by the composer.\n\nDownload or establish the uniform title for a complete work when part of the work is being used -- each part of the uniform title (including composer) should be authorized with correct reference structure.\n\nBack to Top\n\nOverlaying of Names\n\nWhen an authority record overlays an existing authority record a 961 field is system generated that updates the headings in bibliographic records from the old heading to the new heading (updates overnight when the “Add, Delete, Update Database' report is run).\n\nUpdating LC and LAC authorities should become the responsibility of Backstage. When updating of entries for which a local authority has been created, forward requests for changes to cataloguing librarians who will not only make the changes, check that they took effect but will also be responsible for notifying Backstage in order that their copy of our authority file will be kept up-to-date. ­­­­­­­­­­\n\nBack to Top\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFor musical group names in the form: [Personal name (first name and surname)] and the [group name], where no national library record exists, two names will be established and used in bibliographical records as a personal name (100) with the accompanying group as a separate entry (710).\n\nKen Smithson and the Moon Trio\n\n100 1\\ Smithson, Ken\n\n710 \\2 Moon Trio\n\nLauren Mann & the Fairly Odd Folk\n\n100 1\\ Mann, Lauren\n\n710 \\2 Fairly Odd Folk\n\nA name, which appears to be a personal name [forename and surname] or a phrase name, should remain with the group name if the name does not represent an individual musical artist.\n\nJive Bunny and the Mastermixers (Musical group) n 92037504\n\n(A British novelty pop music act with a cartoon rabbit in their videos and with a rabbit-costumed human for promotional purposes)\n\nKing Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard (Musical group) no2015170600\n\n(An Australian rock band none of whose members are King Gizzard or the Lizard Wizard)\n\nClovis Crawfish and the All-Star Bayou Band (Musical group) as a local authority\n\n(Clovis Crawfish is a character in a series of Louisiana-based children's books. All-star Cajun musicians present the bits of music from the books in an album by Clovis Crawfish and the All-star Bayou Band)\n\nMusical group names consisting of first name only linked with a group name are generally established as a single entity.\n\n110 2\\ Susanna & the Magical Orchestra\n\n110 2\\ Martha and the Muffins (Musical group)\n\nExceptional cases have been established where a single-word name is not a first name but is the musical artist's established name.\n\n110 2\\ Prince and The Revolution (Musical group)\n\n110 2\\ Fitz and the Tantrums (Musical group)\n\nFollow national library record when available unless deemed in error.\n\nQualifiers for musical groups (Musical group vs. Musical duo/trio): if national library record available, use as found; if no national library record, use term (Musical group) for duos, trios and groups. Make an added entry in the bibliographic record and reciprocal 5XXs in authority records when a member's name is also part of the group's name [see also General Sound Recordings, 7XX Added entries #3].\n\nGenerally do not consider a listing of surnames to be a group name unless established as such by LC or LAC, i.e. trace as separate 1XX/7XX(s); however a listing of first names will be established as a group name if required. E.g.,\n\nJudy & David (Musical group)\n\nChoice of name for authors using pseudonyms -- use name that indicates actual authorship. E.g.,\n\nt.p. Ann Rule writing as Andy Stack\n\n100 1 |a Stack, Andy\n\nBUT\n\nt.p. Ken Goffman (a.k.a. R. U. Sirius)\n\n100 1 |a Goffman, Ken\n\nPhrase names for music artists: enter in direct order unless name can be confirmed as a forename and surname. Check RDA; DJ is a prefix unless there is a surname or initial surrogate. E.g. (RDA headings from LC),\n\nLL Cool J, |d1956-\n\nDJ E-Z Rock, DJ QBert,|d1969-, DJ Sneak, DJ Tamara\n\nDJ Cary, DJ Envy, DJ Koze,|d1972-\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff (RDA 9.2.2.22)\n\nSlick Rick |c (Musician), Magic Slim|c(Musician), Keb' Mo'|c(Musician)\n\nTimber Timbre|c(Musician)\n\nBut do accept LC names where a surname is represented by an initial and one or more other parts of the name are given in full, then record the initial that represents the surname as the first element (RDA 9.2.2.9.1), e.g.\n\nG., Michael\n\nA., Dominique,|d1968-\n\nPerformance names, e.g. African names for performing artists. African performers often assume a \"performance name\" which is then used alone or with their real name in various forms, e.g. Tabu Ley \"Rochereau\". If variant forms of name appear anywhere on a single item (e.g. Rochereau on label; Rochereau Tabu Ley on container), choose one form of name adding 400's for variant forms rather than establishing name authorities for each form of name.\n\nCompound names:\n\nWhen a person variously uses a compound name (with a hyphen) and a single name both beginning with the same name, use one name authority record choosing one form of name (the predominant name, if this can be determined) with a cross-reference for the variant form. E.g.,\n\nItem 1: Joan Bradley\n\nItem 2: Joan Bradley-Smith\n\nName auth.: 100 |a Bradley, Joan\n\n400 |a Bradley-Smith, Joan\n\n400|aSmith, Joan Bradley-\n\nIf a person variously uses a compound name (with a hyphen) and a single name which differ as to the initial element, establish two separate name authority records for that person with connecting see-also references. E.g.,\n\nItem 1: Stephen Kovacevich\n\nItem 2: Stephen Bishop-Kovacevich\n\nName auth.: 100 |aKovacevich, Stephen\n\n500 |a Bishop-Kovacevich, Stephen\n\nAND\n\n100 |a Bishop-Kovacevich, Stephen\n\n500 |a Kovacevich, Stephen\n\nIf a person variously uses a compound name (without a hyphen) and a single name which differ as to the initial element, establish two separate name authority records for that person with connecting see-also references. E.g.,\n\nItem 1: Sebag Montefiore, Simon\n\nItem 2: Montefiore, Simon, 1965-\n\nName auth.: 100 |a Sebag Montefiore, Simon, 1965-\n\n500 |a Montefiore, Simon, 1965-\n\nAND\n\n100 |a Montefiore, Simon, 1965-\n\n500 |a Sebag Montefiore, Simon, 1965-\n\nOdd diacritic markings, hyphens, etc. may be introduced by layout artistry; a name authority should not include markings which are not necessary. E.g.,\n\nPla·ce·bo = Placebo (Musical group) [name included phonetic markings]\n\nA-cou-stix (acoustix in printed text) = Acoustix (Musical group)\n\nChinese names: When it cannot be determined which portion of the name is the surname (i.e. a single syllable surname cannot be identified), assume the order given on the item, regardless of origin of publication, is the Chinese direct order of surname first, forename last; E.g.,\n\nT.p.: Wu Ying\n\n100: Wu, Ying\n\n400: Ying, Wu\n\nAccept LAC names for corporate bodies that have been established with initialisms for the body within the name. E.g.,\n\n110 |a Environmental Management Solutions (EMS) Inc.\n\n110 |a Laboratory Centre for Disease Control (LCDC) Expert Working Group\n\nNames with nicknames: If a person consistently uses a nickname, establish the name with the nickname, e.g.,\n\n100 |a McTell, Blind Willie\n\n400 |a DeJesus, Georgina “Gina”,|d1990-\n\nRecording initials or letters\n\nIf separate letters or initials appear on the source of information without full stops between them, transcribe the letters without spaces between them in the 245 title statement\n\nWhen creating a local authority: if written in capital letters an abbreviation is implied whether full stops or not; use periods and internal spaces for a personal name and periods and no spaces for a corporate name, e.g. Rowling, J. K., Wong, S. G., land, k. d. etc.\n\nInclude any typographic devices when they appear as part of multi-letter abbreviation of a name; leave a space after the full stop following the first initial RDA 8.5.6, e.g. H. D.; D. S., Master\n\nIf an initial representsa given name and the initial is followed by another initial or a name leave a space after the full stop following the first initial RDA 8.5.6.1, Rowling, J. K. ; Mrs. R. F. D.\n\nIf the nameconsists entirely or primarily of separate letters, leave a space between the letters (regardless of whether they are followed by full stops or not) General RDA guidelines 8.5.6.1. and Identifying persons 9.2.2.21\n\nIf the name includes initials or abbreviations forming part of a title or term of address, leave a space between the initial or abbreviation and a subsequent initial, abbreviation, numeral or word e.g. DJ Q\n\nBack to Top\n\nRevised: Feb. 9, 2022\n\nIcon"
