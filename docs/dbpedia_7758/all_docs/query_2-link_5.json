        "text": "Hong Kong actor, screenwriter and film producer\n\nFor other people with the same name, see Anthony Wong.\n\nIn this Hong Kong name, the surname is Wong. In accordance with Hong Kong custom, the Western-style name is Anthony Wong and the Chinese-style name is Wong Chau-sang.\n\nAnthony Wong Chau-sang (born Anthony William Perry; 2 September 1961) is a Hong Kong film actor and singer.[1][2][3] He has worked with many significant directors of Hong Kong cinema since his debut in 1985, including John Woo, Andrew Lau, Ringo Lam and Johnnie To, and is known for his intense portrayals of often-amoral characters.[4] He has won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor three times: for The Untold Story (1993), Beast Cops (1998) and Still Human (2018).\n\nHe is best known to international audiences for his roles as Triad gangster Johnny Wong in Hard Boiled (1992), police Superintendent Wong Chi-shing Infernal Affairs trilogy (2002-03) and General Yang in the Hollywood film The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nWong was born Anthony William Perry on 2 September 1961[5] to a Hong Kong Chinese mother Wong Juen-yee,[6] and an English father, Frederick William Perry, who served with the Royal Air Force during World War II and later as a colonial officer. Frederick Perry walked out on the family when Wong was four,[6] so he lived with his mother \"in the staircase of a pre-war building in Wan Chai\" until he was sent to live with various relatives for two years while his mother \"held down three jobs.\"[6] He kept in touch with his father through letters until they lost contact when he was 12 years old, and he knew that he had three older half-siblings from his father's marriage.[7] He met his half-brothers in 2018.[6]\n\nIn his acting career, Wong's established a reputation for openly critiquing the Hong Kong film industry and its practices, actors' performances and pop culture in interviews and his personal microblog. In some of those critiques, he revealed his experiences of being bullied and discriminated against—for being a \"mixed race foreigner\" and \"during the 1960s, English-Chinese mixed race people like me were regarded as bastards\" and for being born outside Hong Kong—while growing up in Hong Kong and during the early years of his acting career.[8][9]\n\nDuring his late teens, Wong moved to the United Kingdom to attend a college of further education.[9] He returned to Hong Kong to attend a training course in hairdressing until he quit to join Asia Television's (ATV) training programme when he was 21.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter completing ATV's training programme, he continued his training at The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts.[9] He had stated in an interview that his mixed ethnicity initially caused him to be typecast as a villain, due to institutionalised racism in the Hong Kong film industry during this period.[10] He, however, won a Hong Kong Film Award for his performance as the real-life serial killer Huang Zhiheng, who made meat buns from his victims' flesh, in The Untold Story in 1993.\n\nIn the following years, Wong appeared in a wide range of genre films including Rock n' Roll Cop, Hard Boiled, The Heroic Trio, Infernal Affairs, The Mission and The Medallion. He had also several appearances in the popular Young and Dangerous film series as Tai Fei; a rival Triad gangster to Ekin Cheng's character Chan Ho-nam, an ambitious Triad gangster, whom Tai Fei eventually befriends.\n\nWong had also appeared in a number of international English-language films including The Painted Veil and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.\n\nIn 1995, Wong made his directorial debut with The New Tenant.\n\nIn 2014, Wong made his culinary debut in Dinner Confidential, where he would prepare one dish out of a table d'hote candle-lit dinner menu for guests.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2015, Wong became the first Hong Kong actor to have won the best lead actor role award in TV and movies when he won 2015 TVB Anniversary Awards for Best Actor and Best Drama for Lord of Shanghai, marking his triumphant return to TVB. He also became the first Hong Kong actor to have won Best Actor awards in films, stage theatre and TV. He also became the first Hong Kong actor to ever win TVB's Best Actor award on his first nomination.\n\nIn May 2020, Wong travelled to Taiwan for his role in the Public Television Service (PTS) drama Heaven on the Fourth Floor.[11]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nWong married Jane Ng Wai-zing in 1996 and they have two sons. Wong is taking care of his mother who now has dementia,[12] while his sons now live outside of Hong Kong. In June 2018, it was revealed that he had a son named William (born 1998), with a woman known only as \"Joyce\" who is the niece of veteran actor and producer John Shum.[13]\n\nIn March 2018, Wong met his half-brothers, twins John William and David Frederick Perry, after a BBC story[14] on Wong's search for his family was published.[15] He also has a half-sister, Vera Ann. His father died in 1988 in Australia, where he and his first family settled after they left Hong Kong. His half-siblings did not know of Wong's existence until the BBC story was produced.[6]\n\nIn a 2005 interview with Star eCentral, Wong stated that amongst his prolific output during the 1980s and the 1990s, a considerable number of films he appeared in were \"terrible.\"[16] However, he does not regret making those films, as he needed the money to support his family.[16]\n\nWong is a supporter of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, a series of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.[17] This has reportedly led to limited acting opportunities for him in mainland China.[17][18] He has also voiced support for the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests.[19][20]\n\nWong travelled to Taiwan in May 2020, which fuelled speculation that he was moving to the island. However, Wong later revealed he was there for a filming commitment, nonetheless describing Taiwan's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic as \"excellent\" and expressing interest in staying long term.[11][21] On 18 April 2021, Wong was approved for an Employment Gold Card, allowing him to work in Taiwan without needing to apply in advance. It also allows him to receive tax incentives and National Health Insurance.[22]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role 1985 My Name Ain't Suzie (花街時代) Jimmy Koch 1990 When Fortune Smiles (無敵幸運星) Wei (曹家大哥/飛飛大哥) 1990 No Risk, No Gain: Casino Raiders - The Sequel Yeung Sing 1990 Dancing Bull (舞牛) Ngau Ban-tsiu (牛品超) 1990 The Big Score (絕橋智多星) Ma Kwan (馬坤) 1991 Erotic Ghost Story II (聊齋艷譚續集五通神) Ng Tung/Chau-sang (五通（男魔）/秋生) 1991 Don't Fool Me Nerd's brother Su (黑幫小弟) 1991 Casino Raiders II Pow 1992 Sting of the Scorpion (蠍子) Chow Kin (周健) 1992 Now You See Love, Now You Don't Dunno 1992 What a Hero!
