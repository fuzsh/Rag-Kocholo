The black-and-blue metaphor is fitting, though, considering\n\nthe person he's playing: Thelonious Monk.\n\nIn the 78-minute, one-man show booked at the theater, Neal recalls the\n\nbattering the legendary jazz pianist took from society -- not to mention the\n\nmusician's own self-destructive habits.\n\n\"Monk\" is only 50 seconds long before one demon turns up. \"I need a drink,\"\n\nhe says, suddenly interrupting a story he's hardly started. He liberally\n\nswigs from a bottle -- whether it's supposed to be water or vodka is\n\nanyone's guess -- as the performance continues.\n\nLaurence Holder's script contains some sharp details. When Monk (1917-1982)\n\nheard a brook running through Central Park, he noted that it flowed in 6/8\n\ntime. He tells about the thrill of playing his \"first good piano,\" after\n\nyears of out-of-tune uprights. And, he mentions, he purposely showed up late\n\nat his nightclub performances to raise the tension level among the patrons,\n\nwho'd appreciate him more after they began to doubt he'd show at all.\n\nThen there was the time a nightclub patron asked him to play \"Melancholy\n\nBaby.\" Monk did it his way, and only the most astute jazz aficionados would\n\nhave detected the melody.\n\nUnfortunately, too little of Monk's music is heard over the sound system\n\nduring the show. Only a riff here and a riff there is played, to negligible\n\neffect.\n\nThough Monk talks about playing the same note over and over for effect, a\n\nplay cannot be a one-note enterprise, and soon \"Monk\" constantly reiterates\n\nthe same points about substance abuse (\"Getting high when you're playing is\n\ndangerous\") and racism. The audience also is unprepared for a scene in which\n\nMonk mourns the death of his mother. His grief would be more touching if she\n\nwere introduced earlier in the script.\n\nBut Neal deliciously cackles when he punctuates a fond reminiscence, and has\n\nexcellent eye contact with his audience. He personifies a man who can't\n\nstand still when he talks. It may be the booze or the drugs, but it could be\n\nthat music continually flowed through him. His right hand is always in\n\nmotion, as if he's leading a band. What's most astonishing is how\n\nsurprisingly agile he is for a large man; at one point, he even jumps rope\n\nto show off his spryness, and his display is at first impressive, eventually\n\ndazzling.\n\nBut in essence, Neal can only make Thelonious Monk moderately interesting\n\nand rarely riveting.\n\nNEW JERSEY STAGE\n\nMonk\n\nWhere: Crossroads Theatre Company, 7 Livingston Ave., New Brunswick\n\nWhen: Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., Nov. 23 at 3 and 8 p.m., and Nov. 24 at\n\n3 p.m."
