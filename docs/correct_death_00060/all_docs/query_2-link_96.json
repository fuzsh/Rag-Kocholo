        "text": "Of all the stories about jazz musicians who cannot quite handle worldly matters and the companions who manage their lives, the long love affair of Thelonious and Nellie Monk may be the most famous. Thelonious, a socially awkward eccentric who was absorbed in his art and lived through his imagination, depended on his wife and relished her company.\n\nIn 1957 he wrote one of his most beautiful ballads for her, Crepuscule with Nellie.\n\nIn the early 1970s, when Monk moved into the large Weehawken, New Jersey, home of his patron, the Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter, Nellie moved there with him.\n\nNellie Smith was born in 1921 in St Petersburg, Florida. She and her family moved to New York City early in her life, first to Brooklyn and then to the San Juan Hill area of Manhattan, west of Lincoln Centre, where Thelonious Monk's family lived. When she was about 14, she met Monk, who was three years older, on the neighbourhood basketball court.\n\nThe Monks were together from around 1947 until his death in 1982. She provided financial as well as emotional support, working as a seamstress during World War II in a factory and sporadically making clothes thereafter for her husband and for friends. She never became Monk's manager as such, but she collected money from promoters, paid musicians, made sure band members had airline tickets and even helped Monk get dressed. The 1988 documentary Straight, No Chaser showed their mutual devotion, as Nellie shepherded her husband through airports and hotels.\n\nShe was never interviewed at length about her husband; they both kept their family life private. But in Nat Hentoff's book The Jazz Life, Nellie made revealing comments in discussing her and her husband's clashing sense of home decor.\n\n\"I used to have a phobia about pictures or anything on a wall hanging just a little bit crooked,\" she told Hentoff. \"Thelonious cured me. He nailed a clock to the wall at a very slight angle, just enough to make me furious. Finally I got used to it. Now anything can hang at any angle and it doesn't bother me at all.\"\n\nThe story has served ever since as a metaphor for Monk's relation to the world, and for his music, in which a pretty melody is set slightly askew by dissonance, or a swinging rhythmic phrase is gapped with an irregular rest."
