        "text": "Written & Photographed by Kenn Sava (*unless otherwise credited)\n\nIt’s impossible to walk around NYC and not be walking on history. More often than not? You’re walking on a spot where something historic happened. Usually, time and “progress” have left no reminder. You have to be an historian to know, or a long time resident to remember. Unless someone pulls your coat. Just this happened to me this past May 5th as I was walking down Cooper Square between East 4th and 5th Streets in the Lower East Side. When someone did…\n\nThis story begins with chalk on the pavement, and a box.\n\nShortly after the very moment I felt that tug on my coat, a discovery long hidden in the estate of a Magnum Photographer who passed away in 2008 would bring history back to life in the form of a PhotoBook and 2 shows. Before I get too far ahead of myself…\n\nMagnum Photos has been around as the world’s leading Photo Agency, documenting what is history now for 71 years, since being founded by legends Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson along with David “Chim” Seymour, George Rodger, William & Rita Vendivert and Maria Eisner in 1947. Along the way many of the greatest Photographers of our time have been members at one point or another. Today, it’s going as strong as ever, with as well-rounded a roster as its possibly ever had, including Harry Gruyaert, who I recently interviewed, and other living legends, including Bruce Davidson, Elliott Erwitt and Susan Meiselas, as well as a veritable “all-star team” of younger Artists counting Alec Soth, Alessandra Sanguinetti, Cristina de Middel and, in 2018, Gregory Halpern among them.\n\nThose who come now are standing on the shoulders of giants of Photography.\n\nWith so many luminaries in its already storied history, it’s easy for one to slip into a bit of a lack of attention from time to time. Take Burt Glinn for example. Born in Pittsburgh in 1925, he joined Magnum in 1951, one of the first group of Americans in the member owned organization. He became president of it in the 1970s and again in the 1980s. He achieved fame for his international work, including beautiful Portraits of Russia and Japan in color, as well as for his coverage of the Cuban Revolution, which saw him somehow gain access to Fidel Castro and his inner circle. Back at home, he profiled Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, and Katherine Hepburn, while also shooting Queen Elizabeth II’s visit to NYC. Burt Glinn is one of those Photographers who might illicit a “who?” from some today, but as soon as you start looking at his work, that’s quickly replaced by, “Oh, that’s his. So is that. So is that…” Like this one, perhaps the most famous image of Andy Warhol with Edie Sedgewick-\n\nOr, this unbelievable moment-\n\nBut, there are many sides to the work of Burt Glinn. In fact, so many sides, some are still coming to light 10 years after his passing in 2008. While working on an upcoming Burt Glinn Retrospective, Michael Shulman of Magnum Photos, Elena Glinn, the Artist’s widow, and Tony Nourmand of Reel Art Press discovered a box labelled “nonconformists.” Inside were never before seen Photos of those legendary “nonconformists,” the Beats, along with his notes and an original Jack Kerouac manuscript! The Retrospective was immediately put on hold while Reel Art Press published the beautiful PhotoBook, Burt Glinn: the beat scene, in July, that includes the first color Photographs of the Beats ever published. Some of these images were then shown at the Beat Museum, San Francisco, in July, and now others, including many not published in the book, were exhibited at Burt Glinn: Photographs of the New York Beat Scene at New York’s renowned Jason McCoy Gallery, a 40 year fixture in the famous NYC Art Mecca, the Fuller Building, on West 57th Street, from September 12th through October 12th.\n\nThe NYC Art world is a mysterious place to most people on the outside, so having the rare chance to walk through a show in a famous gallery with its curator, particularly this show’s curator, Samantha McCoy, who works regularly with the Photographs of this Artist and his estate, at Magnum Photos, was a special privilege. It turned out that Samantha was also curating a show by Artist Carla Gimbatti at ChaShaMa– at the same time! “He’s a chameleon,” she warned me before we began. As we turned the corner into the first gallery, I saw what she meant.\n\nAs we looked, it immediately became apparent that these aren’t just any Photos of the Beats (Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, LeRoi Jones, who was later change his name to Amiri Baraka, and Gregory Corso). They’re a fascinating window into their daily lives, an invitation to hang out with them in moments public and private, and, in a revelation, they also offer an unprecedented chance to see the Beats in the company of a number of Painters and Sculptors, including Helen Frankenthaler, Willem de Kooning, David Smith, Franz Kline, Joan Mitchell, Larry Rivers, and Musicians, including David Amram and Lee Bostic. These images fire the imagination as they draw you in to ponder just what was being discussed. In addition to being beautiful Photographs that add another dimension to Burt Glinn’s achievement, like so many of his other works, these are vitally important historical and cultural documents. To top it all off, the book and the shows mark the first time color Photographs of the Beats in their early days have been seen!\n\nGiven her experience working with Burt Glinn’s Photographs at Magnum, I asked Samantha what surprised her about this newly discovered body of work. “Before learning about the release of the beat scene by Reel Art Press, I was actually not at all familiar with this particular body of work,” she said. “It was a surprising and exciting discovery. I found it particularly impressive to learn that Burt had followed the Beats on his own accord . As Elena Glinn informed me, ‘It was Burt’s roommate, Clay Felker, who had said to Burt, ‘We have to do something with these nonconformists who are all over the place. Go after those guys. Go to openings.’ Burt just did it, and he went to everything. He went to the poetry readings, to the gallery openings, to artist’s studios.'”\n\n3 years younger than Jack Kerouac, a year older than Allen Ginsberg and 3 years older than Helen Frankenthaler, Burt fit right in with the Beats and the Artists.\n\n” I love how Burt is able to transport you to this pivotal time in New York; he had this uncanny ability to really capture the atmosphere in such a way that you feel you are there,” Ms. McCoy added. “He was a true chameleon in that sense. And then, of course, to put this series into the context of everything else he was shooting at that time is all the more riveting. He was an immensely gifted storyteller.”\n\nI asked Samantha about the her groupings that seem to tell “short stories” within the larger body, and about her approach to installing this show. She said, “This is a very keen observation, and was definitely on my mind while curating, though I must say Burt’s work lends itself to this type of curation.”\n\nShe continued, “There were so many anecdotes that spoke to me when I was making the edit, so I suppose I was hoping to give each of them life. The Beat life in New York was full of small stories, in different landscapes and pockets of New York. I wanted the viewer to have a feeling of all of them, as well as the scope of this movement.”\n\nParticularly interesting to me is that these Photos were taken at the exact moment when the first generation Abstract Expressionists were seeing their hold on the cult of culture in NYC begin to gravitate to the Beats , which would continue well into the Rock ‘n Roll era of the 1960s and beyond. NYC, and indeed, the world, would never be the same.\n\nNo less than half of the Photos included in the show (22) were taken in 1957, the year On The Road was published, the very moment the Beats rose to cultural and literary prominence. That same summer, on stage at the Five Spot, the great Thelonious Monk was joined by the equally great John Coltrane, recordings of which were discovered and released in 1993. A further 14 of these Photos were taken in 1959, the year that Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Larry Rivers, and David Amram, featured here, also appeared in Robert Frank’s legendary film, Pull My Daisy. And, 1959 was also the year that Burt Glinn received the Matthew Brady Award for Magazine Photographer of the Year from the University of Missouri. Heady times, indeed.\n\nAlthough he later went to San Francisco to Photograph the Beat scene there, only one of those shots is on view here. “I really wanted to stay focused on the New York work,” Samantha said.\n\nIn New York, along with the famous Cedar Tavern, perhaps no where was more the place to be in the day than the Five Spot. There aren’t many Photos of the club, or what was going on inside of it, so Burt Glinn’s are an invaluable addition to those we have, taking us right into the midst of it.\n\nThen, there are the recollections of those who were there . I asked gallery owner Jason McCoy what he thought of the show, he said, “The photographs and the New York light brought back a nostalgia and sense of smell I associate with tenement hallways in Chinatown and in the Bowery, all places frequented by artists in those days!”\n\nDuring this time, Burt Glinn was not only busy documenting the activities of the famous and the rising stars, he was also, everywhere else. He showed up at parties where none of the “big names” were. He haunted side streets as well as the bars, all of this enabled him to capture the full flavor of the scene, catching its atmosphere as he strove to find its essence. He’s even in Washington Square as the sun rises on a new day catching a lone minstrel with an acoustic guitar putting the night to bed with a song.\n\nNo matter where he is, in his photos you’re right there- sitting at a crowded table, having drinks, and discussing literature, poetry, Art, life. You’re hunched in a corner of the Five Spot listening to the band, though you can’t even see all the musicians. Or, you’re listening to the Beat poets recite or test drive their latest creation at 2 a.m. You’re in the studio with Helen Frankenthaler, Willem de Kooning, and others. You’re going over to visit LeRoi Jones…\n\nFor the Beats, it was the best of times. Soon, millions of young people (including four lads from Liverpool, England, who would borrow the name) would aspire to be part of what was happening right in front of Burt Glinn’s lens. Back when very few knew.\n\nJack Kerouac knew. He wrote a piece to accompany Burt’s Photographs called “and this is the beat nightlife of new york,” which reminded me why I went through a “Kerouac period.” Fittingly, the original was found with them. Where it belongs. Like in a time capsule. A parchment testament of the times.\n\nBut not the New York Times, these are the On The Road times. The Dharma Bums times. The Howl times. The Subterraneans times. The ‘Round Midnight times. The Pull My Daisy times.\n\nThe times they were a-changin.\n\nBookMarks–\n\nthe beat scene: Photographs by Burt Glinn – Includes that terrific essay by Jack Kerouac, “and this is the beat nightlife of new york,” 170 Photographs, including the first 70 color Photos of the Beats in their early days ever published, and many Photos that show more of the public, and private, life of the Beats, the Artists, Musicians and others. It’s a unique PhotoBook because it shows seminal figures in 20th century Art, Music and Literature in close proximity as they live their lives at what was a key moment in each of their lives, and the culture of the world, along with other folks the world either never knew or has already forgotten, who, as Samantha McCoy said, “were more friends and drinking buddies.” Recommended.\n\nAllen Ginsberg Photographs, 1990- is the other classic book of Photographs of the Beats. Ginsberg is a Poet whose work seems every bit as relevant today as it was when he wrote it, and his Photographs came to public attention, and acclaim, late in his life. They deserve the acclaim, in my opinion. Andrew Roth agreed and he included Allen Ginsberg: Photographs in his The Book of 101 Books: Seminal PhotoBooks of the Twentieth Century, one of the standard references on the subject for many. To date, I have only seen 1991 second edition copies and I found the reproductions lacking, though they are printed in a nice size. Perhaps the paper hasn’t aged well, I’m not sure. Perhaps they’re better in the out of print first edition, or perhaps this important part of Mr. Ginsberg’s oeuvre needs a new edition. In that case, unlike Allen Ginsberg: Photographs, he will no longer be able to oversee it, unfortunately. Recommended, if you can find a copy who’s reproductions do justice to the work.\n\n*-Soundtrack for this Post is The Thelonious Monk Quartet: Live at the Five Spot: Discovery!, a very rare meeting of two Musical giants of the 20th century, Monk & John Coltrane, (let alone whoever may have been in the audience that night), part of which you can hear, here-\n\nMy thanks to Samantha McCoy of Magnum Photos, and to Jason McCoy and Amanda Konishi of Jason McCoy Gallery.\n\nNighthawkNYC.com has been entirely self-funded and ad-free for over 6 years, during which over 250 full length pieces have been published.

I bet they own at least one, and I also bet it’s on display. I’m making this wager based on my experience that every American Museum I’ve been to, including many smaller ones, owns at least one work by Stuart Davis, and that work seems to always be on view . This is a testament to his wide, and ongoing, appeal. Stuart Davis’ Art still has a contemporary look and feel to it. Maybe that’s because so many Artists who have come after him, like much of “Pop Art,” have been influenced by him. Somehow, Davis is also an Artist who is rarely given a show. The last big one I know of was “Stuart Davis: American Painter” at The Met in 1991. It’s left me with years of longing to see more than one or two of his works at a time, so I was very excited when I heard about “Stuart Davis: In Full Swing,” June 10-September 25 at the Whitney.\n\nIt turns out to have been worth the wait. With 75 works ranging from 1923 until his final work left unfinished on his easel the night he died in 1964, we get to see much, if not all, of his accomplishment. The 1991 Met show featured 175 works, 31 before the earliest work in this show. While I’m a bit disappointed the show is missing the first decade of his work, (the title “Stuart Davis: In Full Swing” refers to his career being in full swing during the period of his work displayed), what’s included has been marvelously hung adding much insight into Davis’ process and development.\n\nBeyond this, it’s simply gorgeous to behold. Davis, the colorist, is something not often spoken about, and for me, is under-appreciated. His work needs to be seen in person, where his color makes a vibrant, stunning, often shocking first impression- even in 2016. Looking closer, it becomes apparent that though he uses relatively few colors and repeats them from piece to piece he is a master of color schemes. Has any American Artist used Yellows or Oranges the way Davis has?\n\nHaving come out of the end of the era of “Ashcan School,” Davis’s early work, often depicting street scenes of the greater New York area, shared their darker palette. Here and there he’d inject very bright passages of color, as in “Bleecker Street,” 1912. Soon, they would dominate as the influence of the Europeans, the Cubists , and Joan Miro took hold, his palette brightened. Matisse was also an early influence, and even in the 1950s, Davis’ work features shapes that echo those found in Matisse’s late Cut-Outs.\n\nThe title “Stuart Davis: In Full Swing” is a double entendre, also referring to his love of Jazz- “swing” being the most popular form of the music in the 1920’s and 1930’s. Stuart Davis loved Jazz. As I wrote not all that long ago upon accidentally discovering where he lived for 20 years in Greenwich Village, it was, coincidentally or not, around the corner from some of the greatest jazz clubs in the world .\n\nLooking at his work, it’s clear that he “gets” what it’s like to play Jazz, what goes on in the mind of the musician or singer, and it comes out of his hands, like it does for musicians, too.\n\nWalking around, I spent quite a bit of time trying to associate Davis’ work with specific Jazz Artists. While I found there were many who came to mind for specific works, I came to feel that Davis’ work was ahead of it’s time, musically, as well as visually/Artistically. His shapes seem to anticipate the angular developments of Musicians like Thelonious Monk and Andrew Hill. Standing in front of a work like “Swing Landscape,” 1938, an endlessly fascinating blend of nautical visual motifs in a riot of color, the feeling is like listening to a great Big Band. Take Duke Ellington’s or Count Basie’s classic Big Bands that were chock full of unique soloists. each one with a recognizable solo voice. When Lester Young soloed on Tenor Sax for Basie, there was no doubt who was playing. Same for Johnny Hodges, “Tricky” Sam Nanton, Ben Webster, or Bubber Miley with Duke, not to mention Duke and the Count, themselves. Looking at “Swing Landscape,” is like hearing a big band to me, a band comprised of unique voices (colors on shapes), each playing their own part, but still a part of the whole. There is an overriding feeling of joy, and life. But, there were other works that looked to me more like the music of non-swing Masters Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers and even early Ornette Coleman. Though I mixed them in, and many others, I found myself repeatedly returning to Duke Ellington, one of the greatest composers of the century, in any style of music, who also continually pushed and evolved his style, taking the Big Band to many other places musically, like Davis did with Cubism, as the soundtrack for my visits.\n\nAlso like a Jazz Artist, Davis returned again and again to earlier compositions and “riffed” on them, as Patricia Hills said . Davis re-interpreted his earlier compositions the way Jazz Artists reinterpret standards- using his original theme as a jumping off point to create something entirely new.\n\nIn terms of Jazz in Art, I can’t think of another Artist who has a similar effect on me. Other Artists listened to Jazz, during the same time and later, but Stuart Davis’ work looks like Jazz to me. I get that feeling from isolated works by other Artists, especially that of Romare Bearden, who Davis told to visualize the relationships between jazz and art in 1940, though his works are primarily collages, not paintings, but Davis’s whole body of work, with rare exception, gives me that feeling .\n\nYet, there’s more going on here than Jazz.\n\nWe watch Davis breaking through and coming into his own in works like “Super Table,” 1924, and the “Egg Beater” series of 1927-28, which were revolutionary takes on the Cubist “still life,” that proved to be the jumping off points for all his future work that would see him develop his own approach to Cubism, becoming one of the very few outside of the inventors of the style to do so. While he built upon the influences of others, he was very influenced by place and environment as well. His 1928 trip to Paris crops up again and again in his later work. His summers along the water in Gloucester, Mass supplied a life long reservoir of nautical imagery, as did, NYC, while Jazz provided inspiration. Products appear in Davis’ work, possibly evolving out of the still life works of the Cubists, but quickly becoming his own. He then takes words, first seen in ads and on products, and uses them in new ways, sometimes referencing the “hip” jargon of the time, sometimes cryptically, that only he really understands.\n\nA walk through the show reveals that Pop Art, and a number of it’s leading lights were creating work that featured elements Stuart Davis began using way back in the 1920’s. In fact, after seeing it, you may never look at Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns or James Rosenquist quite the same again. Beyond his use of products, his use of words is something that many Artists since Davis, right up to Ed Ruscha, Jenny Holzer and Wayne White, have continued, some basing their entire Artistic output on them. While his influence is huge, it’s also interesting to me how different his work is from the work of the other Abstract Artists of his time, especially the Abstract Expressionists, who were then working right around him every day in NYC and it’s suburbs. Philip Guston speaks of knowing him . What about Jackson Pollock, (who was born, lived and work, then died during the time Davis was alive)? Did Davis know him? It would seem to me they must have met, especially since they both worked for the WPA (Works Progress Administration). It’s hard to imagine two more different Abstract Artists.\n\nIt must also be mentioned that Mrs. Gertrude V. Whitney was a substantial, and early, supporter of Davis, in a number of ways, both financially (buying his Art and advancing him funds) and through the Whitney Studio Club, the precursor of the Whitney Museum, where he got his “big break,” with a 2 week retrospective exhibit in December, 1926. 90 years later, Davis returns to the latest incarnation of the Whitney Museum, a few minutes walk from where he once lived, something of a “champion” of American 20th Century Art, himself. His influence is ongoing. His achievement is still being considered. Yet? All in Stuart Davis’ Legacy is not painted in the bright colors he used so masterfully in his work.\n\nWhile the joy, beauty and insights this show provides will stay with me for a very long time, it’s impossible not to also be reminded of the fact that 90 works by Stuart Davis were discovered to have been “looted” from the Artist’s Estate by Laurence Salander of Salander-O’Reilly Gallery, the long time dealer for Stuart Davis’ Estate, in 2007. The court ruled that Salander owes Earl Davis and the Estate $114.9 million dollars, but being as Salander is behind bars on Riker’s Island no one knows if and when any of that money will be repaid. As bad as that is, perhaps even more tragically, to this day, I’m not sure that all of Davis’ works have been accounted for. The case led to the creation of new laws pertaining to Artist/Gallery dealings. That is the saddest part of what is otherwise the great and ongoing influence that is the legacy of Stuart Davis, one of America’s greatest, and most influential, Artists.\n\n*-Soundtrack for this Post is “It Don’t Mean A Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)” by Edward Kennedy “Duke” Ellington, the title of which appears on Davis’ painting “Tropes de Teens,” 1956.\n\nNighthawkNYC.com has been entirely self-funded & ad-free for over 8 years, during which 300 full length pieces have been published!
