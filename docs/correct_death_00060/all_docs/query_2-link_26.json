        "text": "‘Ultimately I came to the conclusion that all I must do is take care of the music – even if I do it in a closet. And if I really do that, somebody’s gonna come and open the door of the closet and say: ‘Hey, we’re looking for you.’’\n\nBill Evans\n\nI recently watched a fine documentary about the life and work of jazz pianist and composer Bill Evans. (‘Time Remembered’, 2015, produced by Bruce Spiegel)\n\n'Develop a comprehensive technique, and then forget that and just be expressive.’\n\nWith his unhurried, gentle, impressionistic playing, Evans created elegant, mournful works that meander with intent. Albums like ‘Everybody Digs’, ‘Portrait in Jazz’,’ Explorations’ and ‘Moon Beams’; legendary live recordings at the Village Vanguard, convey a sublime sadness. He teaches us to dig deeper and think harder in the quest for truth and beauty.\n\n‘The jazz player, ultimately, if he’s going to be a serious jazz player, teaches himself.’\n\nBorn in 1929 in Plainfield, New Jersey, Evans began playing the piano at 4 or 5 and was classically trained. At 13 he fell in love with jazz, particularly admiring Nat King Cole and Bud Powell.\n\n‘Jazz is the most central and important thing in my life.’\n\nIn 1955 Evans moved to New York, installing his piano in a small, cramped apartment on 83rd Street. He focused single-mindedly on making it as a musician.\n\n‘At that time I made a pact with myself… I gave myself ‘til I was 30.’\n\nEvans supplemented his natural talent with an incredible work ethic. He practised every available hour, took jobs performing in clubs in the evenings and carried a music notebook wherever he went.\n\n'I like people who have worked long and hard, developing through introspection and dedication. I think that what they arrive at is, usually, deeper and more beautiful than the person who seems to have that ability and fluidity from the beginning.'\n\nAfter producer Orrin Keepnews was played one of his demo tapes over the phone, Evans was signed to the Riverside label, the home of Thelonious Monk. His first album, released in 1956, sold only 800 copies. But he managed to catch the attention of Miles Davis, who took him on the road and enlisted him for the recording of the 1959 classic ‘Kind of Blue.’\n\n‘I want to build my music from the bottom up, piece by piece. And I just have a reason, that I arrived at myself, for every note I play.’\n\nSubsequently Evans formed a series of trios, the first of which, with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian, was seminal. He embarked on a stunning period of music making.\n\n'Jazz music has always been a place where anything is possible.'\n\nTall and thin, sharp-suited; hair slicked back and wearing glasses, Evans played with his head hung over the piano, fingers lightly caressing the keyboard. There was a look of intense concentration on his face. With his own unique harmonic language; with melodies that floated, and rhythms that de-emphasised the beat, he created what Davis described as ‘crystal notes or sparkling water cascading down from some clear waterfall.’\n\nEvans thought deeply about his craft. Though jazz was often regarded as somewhat cerebral, he sustained that it should always express emotions.\n\n'It bugs me when people try to analyze jazz as an intellectual theorem. It's not, it's feeling.’\n\nUltimately Evans held that his music should have a spiritual dimension.\n\n'Art should teach spirituality by showing a person a portion of himself that he would not discover otherwise.’\n\nI was particularly taken with this statement:\n\n'Jazz is not a what, it is a how. If it were a what, it would be static, never growing. The how is that the music comes from the moment, it is spontaneous, it exists at the time it is created.'\n\nIn the creative professions we tend to treat ideas as precious commodities, stable and fixed. We worry a great deal about people stealing our strategies, copying our concepts. What if another Agency gets hold of our pitch deck? What if a competitor mimics our campaign?\n\n'To imitate someone is to insult them.'\n\nI’ve always felt that creative ideas are fragile, mercurial properties, worth little in the hands of rivals. Viewed through other people’s eyes our proposals generally come across as cold, hollow, flat and lifeless. Great concepts need to be articulated by the people who originated them; animated by advocates that believe in them. And then set free.\n\nLike Evans, the best communicators invest their ideas with spontaneity and emotion; with personality and performance.\n\nPersuasion is not a what, it is a how.\n\n'Keep searching for that sound you hear in your head until it becomes a reality.’\n\nEvans was quiet and introverted. He lacked confidence, was hurt by criticism and for much of his life he was haunted by tragedy. In 1961 Lafaro was killed in a car crash. He was just 25. In 1973 Evans’ long-term girlfriend Ellaine Schultz jumped in front of a subway train after he ended their relationship. Six years later his beloved brother Harry, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, shot himself.\n\nEvans consistently turned to narcotics to dull the pain. He died in 1980 from haemorrhaging and bronchial pneumonia, the result of decades of substance abuse. He was 51.\n\nNot long before he passed, Evans called his collaborator and friend Tony Bennett and relayed some advice:\n\n‘Just go with truth and beauty, and forget the rest.’\n\n'The scene is set for dreaming,\n\nLove's knocking at the door.\n\nBut oh my heart, I'm reluctant to start,\n\nFor we've been fooled before.\n\nThe night is like a lovely tune.\n\nBeware, my foolish heart.\n\nHow white the ever constant moon.\n\nTake care, my foolish heart.’\n\nBill Evans and Tony Bennett, ‘My Foolish Heart' (N Washington / V Young)\n\nNo. 432"
