        "text": "IT'S one thing to be a jazz musician in the Village or Hell's Kitchen, but to say you live on Yale Terrace in West Orange or University Court in South Orange are jazz musicians becoming soccer dads?\n\nThelonious Monk Jr. remembers when he sold his brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant 10 years ago and moved with his wife and two children to South Orange.\n\n\"In terms of jazz, I thought I was retiring to the dark side of the moon,\" said Mr. Monk, acclaimed drummer and son of the pianist and composer.\n\n\"It was 1995, and I was in my garden when I heard some jazz,\" he said. \"'Hey, this is pretty good,' I thought.

There must have been 2,000 people listening to the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band.\"\n\nA few days later, Mr. Monk ran into John Lee, the bass player, who told him that James Mtume, a producer, lived around the corner, not far from Virginia Mayhew, a saxophonist, who lived on the same street in West Orange as the guitarists Dave Stryker and Vic Juris, and the vocalist Kate Baker.\n\nBy all accounts, the number of jazz musicians living in New Jersey -- who have won or been nominated for Grammy Awards -- has swelled in the last decade.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
