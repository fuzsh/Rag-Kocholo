        "text": "The man behind many jazz greats has passed away.\n\nJazz engineer Rudy Van Gelder has died at age 91. He recorded with legendary artists like John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk and more and an impressive majority of the Blue Note Records catalog. He was viewed by some as the most important jazz engineer of all time. He also worked with Prestige Records and Savoy Records.\n\nOne of Van Gelder’s biggest contributions to the genre was recording Coltrane’s definitive A Love Supreme over 50 years ago in December of 1965. It was recorded in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, the state that Van Gelder called home and carved out a special place for jazz by working out of his own studios, his first being a special control room designed and built by his parents in their Hackensack, NJ home in 1946.\n\nThe studio was immortalized in the mid-1950s by Monk’s song ‘Hackensack’. Listen to the track below."
