        "text": "GRNOIR WINE & JAZZ CELEBRATES SHATAWN BRIGHAM'S LEVEL 2 CERTIFIED SOMMELIER DESIGNATION, ANNOUNCES 2ND WINE IN GRNOIR COLLECTION\n\nShatawn & Nadia Brigham Also Celebrate Being Named Top Beverages Newsmakers in GRBJ Awards\n\nGRNoir Wine & Jazz co-owners Shatawn and Nadia Brigham are proud to announce four exciting accomplishments: Shatawn’s elevation to Level 2 Certified Sommelier, the upcoming release of the second wine in their GRNoir Collection, their club’s one-year anniversary and being named the top 2021 Beverages Newsmakers by the Grand Rapids Business Journal.\n\nThe Brighams opened their doors at 35 S. Division St. in Grand Rapids to dine-in customers on Feb. 1, 2021. Choosing Black History Month this year to mark Shatawn’s new sommelier certification level and the upcoming launch of their new wine is part of the couple’s mission to make wine more accessible to people of color. Both Brighams work with the Michigan Wine Collaborative to increase diversity in the state’s wine industry.\n\n“Growing up, I always thought you had to look a certain way or have a different socioeconomic status to drink wine,” said Shatawn, the only Black male sommelier in Grand Rapids to hold a Level 2 certification and likely the only one in Michigan. “When I look at my past work in social work and education, and now looking at the work I’m doing in wine educating people, it’s all the same. What we’re creating at GRNoir is a space where people who look like us, and all others, can discover that wine is approachable.”\n\nShatawn earned his elevation to Level 2 Certified Sommelier with Wine & Spirit Education Trust through Napa Valley Academy. The intermediate coursework involved learning to identify the major grape varieties, regions and wine theory, as well as blind tasting to assess a wine’s quality and characteristics. A 2-minute video of Shatawn talking about his journey is here.\n\n“I want to be the very best I can be,” Shatawn said. “When I’m tasting now with my wine reps, I’m tasting a little more intentionally. I want to make sure I apply the knowledge that I learned about what I’m tasting and what I’m looking for.”\n\nThe newest addition to the GRNoir Collection is a semi-sweet blend of gamay, pinot noir, malbec, cabernet franc and merlot grapes. Named The Red Monk in homage to the late jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk, it’s being announced two months after the collection debuted its Select Harvest Riesling, also created in partnership with Chateau Chantal Winery on Michigan’s Old Mission Peninsula near Traverse City.\n\nBrian Lillie, director of hospitality and distribution for Chateau Chantal Winery, said he’s eager to see what GRNoir customers think of The Red Monk. The Select Harvest Riesling was received very well, and Lillie is pleased with the partnership between his winery and GRNoir.\n\n“Creating this Select Harvest Riesling and now The Red Monk for the GRNoir Collection was a wonderful opportunity for both of us,” Lillie said. “The partnership between people who love to make outstanding wine and a sommelier who loves to serve it is a special relationship. We want to congratulate Shatawn on attaining his new status as a Level 2 Certified Sommelier.”\n\nThe Red Monk will be available later this month in-store at GRNoir Wine & Jazz or online for pickup or shipment throughout Michigan.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Business Journal awarded the Brighams its top Beverages Newsmakers Award on January 26 during its annual Newsmakers of the Year event naming winners in 16 categories. The couple designed GRNoir to be a place where guests from all backgrounds can celebrate the complex and colorful connections between American and global cultures through wine and jazz while learning more about both.\n\n“Our business model is about people exploring something they may not have come in contact with, whether that’s jazz or wine. And I feel like we’ve been successful in doing that,” Nadia said. “You see the generational divide being bridged. You see elders and college-aged students here to watch the young jazz players, people pulling up in everything from scooters to limousines. This is community.”"
