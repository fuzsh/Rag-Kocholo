        "text": "If the era of the generally acknowledged classic jazz recording – a genre stretching from Louis Armstrong's West End Blues to John Coltrane's A Love Supreme – was brought to an end first by the passing of the great 20th-century innovators and then by the overwhelming profusion of recordings produced by the musicians of subsequent generations, it would be wrong to assume that no contemporary work is worthy of a place in the pantheon.\n\nWhen historians come to assess the jazz created in the first decade of the 21st century, for instance, they should not overlook Monk's Casino, a recital of all 70 of the compositions attributed to Thelonious Sphere Monk Jr, interpreted by a quintet under the leadership of the distinguished German pianist Alexander von Schlippenbach. Performed in a nightclub and cast in the form of a continuous medley lasting three and a half hours, this prodigious achievement invites the listener to revel not just in the musicians' extraordinary inventiveness but in the ceaselessly surprising nature of the material from which they draw their inspiration.\n\nSchlippenbach's project was original only in its attempt to provide a complete catalogue raisonnée of Monk's tunes. During the composer's lifetime a number of prominent musicians dedicated albums to his compositions; the soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy went further and gave over a great proportion of his career to the deep exploration of Monk's music, like some medieval scholar engaged in a study of theological texts. But still, as Schlippenbach and his colleagues so amply demonstrate, the well is far from dry, and every night in jazz clubs around the world musicians who were unborn when Monk died in 1982 can be found grappling with the melodic, harmonic and rhythmic subtexts of such masterpieces of musical cryptology as \"Well You Needn't\", \"Epistrophy\" and \"Straight, No Chaser\", and exploring the luminous beauty of his ballads, including \"Round Midnight\", \"Crepuscule With Nellie\" and \"Ruby, My Dear\".\n\nIf Monk's compositions, with their unexpected angles, abrupt rhythms and astringent dissonances, are full of mysteries, then so was their creator. Initially derided by all but the inner circle of the bebop revolution, eventually he was embraced by the vanguard of the beat generation, to whom he symbolised the postwar shift of jazz from popular entertainment to intellectual exercise. Monk was the jazz equivalent of free verse or abstract expressionism, wrapped in a suitably enigmatic presence. He never lost his ability to create controversy, whether it was provoking Miles Davis into complaining of his unhelpfulness as an accompanist, or leading influential critics to accuse him of staleness after the effects of a bipolar disorder had begun to undermine his powers.\n\nThe jazz of the last century was peopled with extraordinary characters, but even by those standards Monk was a fascinating and often unreadable figure. The perceived outlandishness of his music seemed to be mirrored by his appearance and behaviour, from his bamboo-framed sunglasses and a variety of exotic headgear to the strange little dances he performed while other musicians were taking their solos. A decade and a half of research into his life and work has probably brought Robin Kelley, a professor of history and American studies at the University of Southern California, as close as anyone will ever come to finding out what made him tick with such an eccentric but compelling rhythm.\n\nThe name, which seemed to have been confected by some beat generation marketing genius, was real. The surname was conferred on his family by one Archibald Monk, a plantation owner who, in the mid-19th century, enslaved Thelonious Jr's great-grandfather. The Christian name came from a Benedictine missionary saint of the seventh century, bestowed first on his father by sharecropper parents with an imaginative cast of mind (there were siblings called Squire and Theodoras). \"Sphere\" was Thelonious Jr's own subsequent addition, adapted from a family name (Speer) on his mother's side.\n\nBorn in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in 1917, he was four years old when his mother left her husband and, with three small children, moved to New York, where they settled in San Juan Hill, a neighbourhood that was home to thousands of emigres from the southern states and the Caribbean. It was here, amid a daily life vividly evoked by Kelley, that Monk discovered music, including the hymns and gospel songs he heard at home and in church and the distinctive New York stride piano styles of Eubie Blake, James P Johnson and Willie \"The Lion\" Smith.\n\nAs his fame grew, it became fashionable to portray him as some sort of noble savage, an untutored genius reaching back to Africa to restore a lost \"purity\" to jazz. In fact, as the author shows, between the ages of 11 and 13 he studied with a teacher who exposed him to the classical literature, including the works of Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Liszt. At 17, having just missed a scholarship to the Juilliard conservatory, he went on the road accompanying an evangelist; at 22, back in New York, he was leading his own quartet, the forerunner of those with which he would tour the world in the 1960s and 70s, after fame, if not fortune, had finally found him.\n\nKelley describes in considerable detail Monk's crucial role in the birth of bebop at such legendary after-hours joints as Minton's Playhouse and Monroe's Uptown House, where Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were among his accomplices (and whose greater success provoked a lasting resentment). He describes how, in 1948, the publicity campaign for Monk's first recordings established the conventional view of \"a shy and elusive person . . . surrounded by an aura of mystery . . . a strange person whose pianistics continue to baffle all who hear him\". This was both true, in that he could be obtuse and unreliable, and much less than the truth, given his parallel existence as a loving husband, doting father, constant friend, cheerful neighbour and generous teacher, and the sheer playfulness of many of his compositions.\n\nGradually, however, the image of the High Priest of Bebop caught the public imagination. Despite being severely hindered by his inability to work in New York clubs for many years thanks to the withdrawal of his \"cabaret card\" by the New York police after a minor drugs offence, a slow and painful path ultimately led to acceptance in the late 1950s, when he became the first black jazz musician to appear on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nA functional rather than an elegant writer, but a terrific sleuth whose copious footnotes are worth perusal, Kelley also charts Monk's troubled experiences with the music industry. After early exposure with the cream of the independent jazz labels – Blue Note, Prestige and Riverside – he joined the glittering jazz roster of Columbia Records, a major company.\n\nUnlike his labelmates Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck and Duke Ellington, however, Monk lacked even the semblance of a careerist impulse and, despite the efforts of Columbia's art department to relaunch him as a countercultural figure in the late 60s, he failed to live up to their hopes of significant commercial success. If the accounting methods of the independent labels were far from immaculate, Columbia's practices invoke a sense of shame: at the end of 1976, after recording 13 albums for the label, Monk was indebted to the company to the tune of $16,594.71, a sum that one imagines has been amply recouped since his death.\n\nThoughtful attention is given to Monk's coexistent relationships with his spouse, Nellie – \"wife, road manager, business manager, mother, caregiver and accountant\" – and his friend and benefactor Pannonica de Koenigswarter, the Bentley-driving Rothschild heiress. It was in the Jazz Baroness's New Jersey home, a modernist house originally built for the film director Erich von Stroheim, that he spent the last years of his life, dressing in a suit and tie every morning in order to spend the day on his bed, watching The Price is Right on television.\n\nLithium treatment had slowed the advance of his bipolar attacks – almost certainly inherited from his father – but had also, probably in combination with a lifetime's use of alcohol and marijuana (regular), cocaine and heroin (intermittent), and amphetamines (prescribed by a rogue medic), brought his musical output to a full stop long before a stroke finished him off. Those 70 compositions survive, a fount of gnomic musical wisdom for future generations to explore.\n\nRichard Williams's The Blue Moment: Miles Davis's Kind of Blue and the Remaking of Modern Music is published by Faber."
