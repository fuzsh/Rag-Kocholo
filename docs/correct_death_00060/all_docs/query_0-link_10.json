In fact, many people think of him as the founder of ‘Bebop’. However he didn’t play this style for very long. [Bebop is a style of jazz from the early 1940s until the late 1950s. It is often very fast and has very talented playing.]\n\nHe was a piano player and wrote a lot of his own music (including all the ‘famous pieces’ mentioned above).\n\nHis playing was quite unusual. It often had few notes and strange chords.\n\nHe often hit lots of notes on the piano with his elbow or forearm! At other times he would get up from the piano and start dancing round in circles!\n\nHe had very few lessons in music and mostly taught himself.\n\nHe played with some of the great jazz artists of his time, including Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker.\n\nHe was a good friend and teacher of Bud Powell.\n\nHe didn’t really care what the public thought of his music. He played what he wanted, and that was that!\n\nHe was known for wearing hats and sunglasses.\n\nHe was very shy and often said very little.\n\nHe played very little in the last ten years of his life. He spent most of this time hiding away in the house of the rich woman, Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter. (She looked after Charlie Parker for a short while at the end of his life too!)\n\nOfficial Website\n\nHere is a video of Thelonious Monk and his quartet (group of four musicians) playing ‘Round Midnight.\n\nThelonious Monk playing &#8216&#8216Round Midnight’\n\nAnd here is a video of them playing Blue Monk.\n\nThelonious Monk playing ‘Blue Monk’\n\nYou can see another video of music written by Thelonious Monk on the following page:\n\nBud Powell.\n\nPicture credits:\n\nThelonious Monk at the piano.

By the way, when I asked Virginia (Ginny) for permission to use this image she wrote back saying, “Monk was unmarked for many years. One day I brought visitors from Canada to his grave site, explaining he was unmarked, and almost jumped out of my skin when I saw there was finally a marker!”\n\nVideo credits:\n\nTHELONIOUS MONK QUARTET – ‘ROUND MIDNIGHT.
