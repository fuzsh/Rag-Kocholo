        "text": "Happy Wednesday and welcome to Song Musings, my recurring midweek feature in which I dig deeper into a song I’ve only mentioned in passing or not covered at all to date. As a huge fan of Steely Dan, today’s pick definitely falls into the first category: Black Cow.\n\nCo-written by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, Black Cow is the amazing opener of Aja, Steely Dan’s sixth studio album released in September 1977 and, I think many fans agree, their musical Mount Rushmore. In August 1978, Black Cow also appeared as the B-side of the album’s third single Josie.\n\nThe single enjoyed moderate chart success, peaking at no. 24 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100. In Canada, it did slightly better, climbing to no. 20. The Aja album, on the other hand, was hugely successful, peaking at no. 3 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200 and in New Zealand, no. 5 in the UK and no. 9 in each The Netherlands and Australia. Aja also reached 2X Platinum status in the U.S. (2 million certified sold units) and Canada (200,000 certified sold units), as well as Gold status in the UK (100,000).\n\nLike the title track and Peg, Walter Becker did not play on the recording of Black Cow. Donald Fagen provided lead vocals and synthesizer. As had become common since the March 1975 Katy Lied album, Messrs. Becker and Fagen relied on contributions from top-notch session musicians: Larry Carlton (guitar), Joe Sample (clavinet), Victor Feldman (Fender Rhodes), Tom Scott (tenor saxophone), Chuck Rainey (bass) and Paul Humphrey (drums). Backing vocals came from Clydie King, Venetta Fields, Sherlie Matthews and Rebecca Louis. Here’s a live version captured by yours truly in New Jersey in July 2018.\n\nBlack Cow has been covered by various other artists over the years. Among others, SecondHandSongs lists jazz pianist Ahamad Jamal (1978), jazz drummer Norman Connors (1980), smooth jazz guitarist Nick Colionne (1999), soul and jazz singer-songwriter Tony Gallo (2006), Canadian art rock band The Darcys (2012) and singer and actress Linda Lavin (2020), among others. Here’s Colionne’s instrumental version, which he recorded for his 1999 album The Seduction.\n\nFollowing are some additional insights from Songfacts:\n\n“Black Cow” has a number of lyrical interpretations: a troubled relationship, an ode to self-doubt, a commentary on nightlife, a reference to Hindu culture (cows are sacred). Or it could be about Thelonious Monk, the American jazz composer who is often regarded as the father of bebop.\n\nIn the Classic Albums episode on the album Aja, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, perhaps showing their wry sense of humor, described the lyric as “self explanatory,” but did offer some insight as to what they had in mind.\n\n“It starts out with this guy talking about this girl he used to be involved with,” Fagan said. “She’s sitting at a counter, and he describes her behavior and habits, and out of that you begin to see her character and their relationship.”\n\nHe added that the “black cow” is a beverage – depending on where you live, it can be a milkshake or a coke float (like a root beer float, but with coke). But it’s something you would get at a soda fountain, where the song takes place. In the ’50s, Fagen and Becker spent a lot of time at these soda fountains.\n\nNote the deceptively simple disco-era instrumental starting out with a bass line and drums, then sneaking in layers of complexity with saxophone accompaniment and the electric piano solo. Steely Dan made a name for themselves with highly polished productions using a wide array of session musicians.\n\nBecker and Fagan would sometimes record a song with one group of musicians, decide it wasn’t working, and try it again with an entirely new set of players – rinse and repeat until it was right. Aja was their sixth album; by this time Fagen and Becker had refined their system and developed an uncommon rapport where they could almost read each other’s musical minds.\n\nThe multitrack masters for “Black Cow” and “Aja” have gone missing, which makes it impossible to do surround-sound versions of these tracks. In the liner notes to the stereo remaster of the Aja album, the band offered a $600 reward for information leading to their return.\n\nThe 1998 hip-hop hit “Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)” by Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz samples significant portions of “Black Cow.” So much that Walter Becker and Donald Fagen are listed as the writers on the track.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; SecondHandSongs; YouTube\n\nHappy Sunday and I hope everybody is feeling groovy. After having put together music time travel itineraries for just over three years, I thought this would be a good moment to step back temporarily and let others pick the six stops for today’s trip. I’ll remain your conductor, and we will still hit six different decades with music in different flavors, so hop on board, fasten your seatbelts, and let’s have some fun!\n\nSonny Rollins/I’m an Old Cowhand\n\nJazz aficionado CB, aka. Cincinnati Babyhead was kind enough to take a break from fishing to determine our first stop: Way Out West, a 1957 album by jazz tenor saxophone great Sonny Rollins. Over an incredible 70-year-plus career, Rollins has recorded more than 60 albums as a leader and appeared on many additional records as a sideman. He has played with the likes of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Max Roach and Modern Jazz Quartet. Off the above mentioned album, here’s I’m an Old Cowhand, a comic song written by Johnny Mercer for the Western musical picture Rhythm on the Range and released as a single in 1936 by its star Bing Crosby. Rollins who is now 93 and retired was backed by Ray Brown (bass) and Shelly Manne (drums).\n\nOzzy Osbourne/Bark At the Moon\n\nNext we’re pushing the pedal to the metal and zip to November 1983, which saw the release of Ozzy Osbourne’s third solo album Bark At the Moon. Can you guess who might have suggested the destination, or should it have been distortion? Of course, our resident heavy metal expert Deke from deKe’s Vinyl Reviews & More…, who also hosts The Distortion Den on YouTube, together with Jex. Bark At the Moon marked the ex-Black Sabbath lead vocalist’s change to a more a synth infused pop-metal sound. Listeners evidently didn’t mind, especially in the U.S. where the album secured 3X Platinum certification (3 million certified sold units). Here’s fiery title song and first single, which like all of the album’s other tracks officially were credited to Ozzy only – melodic kickass rocker that makes it very accessible – ha ha ha ha!\n\nRough Cats/So Alone\n\nTime to take a bit of a breather by traveling back to the present with the latest single by Rough Cats, a group around Aussie singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Brad McClean, aka. Slap Cat. They say their music spans multiple genres with lyrics injecting doses of cynicism, observation and humor. While official information on Rough Cats may be a bit ambiguous, I can say with no uncertainty that I dig So Alone, a great suggestion from fellow music blogger and accomplished and published poet Lisa at Tao Talk. The single came out on December 8, 2023.\n\nTraffic/Dear Mr. Fantasy\n\nTime to pay a visit to the ’60s with a wonderful stop proposed by Max who pens the terrific PowerPop blog and whose sentiments about music are so similar to mine that I’m still convinced we somehow are distant relatives! When English rock band Traffic released their December 1967 debut album Mr. Fantasy, the multi-instrumentalists and vocalists were still in their original line-up of Chris Wood, Steve Winwood, Dave Mason and Jim Capaldi. With Dear Mr. Fantasy, Max shockingly one of my all-time favorite songs, co-written by Capaldi, Winwood and Wood.\n\nBobby Caldwell/What You Won’t Do For Love\n\nOur next stop takes us to the ’70s and a proposition from an expert for that decade, Paul, one of the creators of the fun Once Upon a Time in the ’70s blog. When he told me to feature Bobby Caldwell’s What You Won’t Do For Love, a title I didn’t recall, I immediately knew we had a smooth-sounding winner once I started listening. Co-written by Caldwell and Alfons Kettner, the track was the lead single of Caldwell’s 1978 eponymous debut album and became his signature song. Active between 1968 and 2020, the American singer-songwriter and musician spanned various genres, including R&B, soul, jazz and adult contemporary. Caldwell passed away in March 2023 at the age of 71.\n\nThe Bluetones/Slight Return\n\nFor our sixth and final stop today, I turned to Dave from A Sound Day, where he chronicles and celebrates great music. He also is the fearless host of Turntable Talk, for which he invites fellow bloggers to share their thoughts on topics he proposes. Dave picked Slight Return by The Bluetones, a British melodic guitar pop group I hadn’t heard of before. For this, we shall set our time controls to February 1996 and their debut album Expecting to Fly. Slight Return, credited to all four members – Mark Morriss (vocals), Adam Devlin (guitar), Scott Morriss (bass, backing vocals) and Eds Chesters (drums, percussion) – also became the album’s second single and their highest-charting in the UK, peaking at no. 2 after it had been reissued – lovely sounding power pop and a great way to finish yet another music time travel excursion.\n\nI’d like to thank CB, Deke, Lisa, Max, Paul and Dave for their great itinerary suggestions. This was fun and I may harass you again sometime in the future! 🙂\n\nFor now, here’s a Spotify list of all the above goodies. See ya!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIt’s Sunday again, and I’d like to invite you to accompany me on another fun music time travel trip. As always, the itinerary features six stops taking us to music with different flavors from six different decades. Come on and let’s get out of here together!\n\nJohn Coltrane/Blue Train\n\nOur little excursion today starts in January 1958 with jazz saxophone great John Coltrane, who rightfully has been called one of the most influential artists in the history of jazz. He’s credited to have helped pioneer modal jazz and been on the forefront of free jazz. During his 22-year career, Coltrane has played with the likes of Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, Red Garland and Paul Chambers, among many others, as you’d expect from a player of Coltrane’s caliber! This brings me to Blue Train, the title cut of his January 1958 studio album. Coltrane (tenor saxophone) was in fine company with Lee Morgan (trumpet), Curtis Fuller (trombone), Kenny Drew (piano), Paul Chambers (bass) and Philly Joe Jones (drums).\n\nJesse Colin Young/Ridgetop\n\nNext let’s head to September 1973 to visit a true ’70s gem by Jesse Colin Young. The singer-songwriter first gained prominence as a co-founder of American folk rock group The Youngbloods. Among others, Young sang lead on their sole top 40 hit Get Together, a rendition of a song penned by Chet Powers, of psychedelic rock band Quicksilver Messenger Service. After the break-up of The Youngbloods in 1972 Young resumed his solo career he had first started in the early ’60s. Ridgetop, written by him, is a fantastic yacht rockish track from his fourth solo album Song For Juli. I love the horn work on this song, giving it a cool jazz vibe.\n\nBig Head Todd and The Monsters/Bittersweet\n\nTime to head to the ’90s with a neat track by Big Head Todd and The Monsters, which is right up my alley and hopefully yours as well. This Colorado rock band was formed in 1986. After two albums in 1989 and 1990, they hit it big in February 1993 with Sister Sweetly, which went Platinum in the U.S. and remained on the Billboard 200 for more than a year, though curiously, it only peaked at no. 117. Off that album, here’s the lead single Bittersweet. Like all other songs on Sister Sweetly, it was solely penned by the band’s vocalist, guitarist and keyboarder Todd Park Mohr. Big Head Todd and The Monsters are active to this day and are currently touring, with Mohr remaining part of the current line-up. They also have a great new single out with a cool John Hiatt vibe.\n\nWillie Nile/This Is Our Time\n\nAre you still with me? Coz this is our time, this is our place, this is our journey to jump to June 2013 and the eighth studio album by New York rock & roll singer-songwriter Willie Nile, American Ride. Nile’s recording career started in 1980 with his eponymous debut album. After his 1981 sophomore release Golden Brown, he was dealing with legal problems that bogged him down for the next few years, but eventually, he was able to resume his career. In addition to his solo work, Nile has performed and recorded with the likes of Ringo Starr, Tori Amos, Elvis Costello and Lucinda Williams. From the aforementioned American Ride, let’s listen to This Is Our Time, written by Nile. Yeah, baby, that’s rock & roll!\n\nAnita Baker/Sweet Love\n\nAfter some blistering rock & roll, let’s take a breather with smooth and soulful vocalist Anita Baker. Sweet Love, a song I’ve always dug, is from Baker’s March 1986 breakout album Rapture, her sophomore release. The album’s first single not only became a top 10 hit on the U.S. pop chart, but also won a Grammy for Best R&B Song at the 1987 Annual Grammy Awards. Sweet Love was co-written by Baker, Louis A. Johnson and Gary Bias. Rapture ended up selling more than 8 million copies worldwide and going 5X Platinum in the U.S. alone (5 million certified sold copies), making it Baker’s biggest commercial success. Man, that’s what I call a great captivating voice!\n\nThe Rolling Stones/Under My Thumb\n\nSo, what’s missing as we once again reach our final destination? Of course, a ’60s tune – simply a decade I cannot miss. Let’s make it count with one of my longtime favorite songs by the greatest rock & roll band in the world, who just keep on going like the Energy Bunny after more than 60 years! Of course, I’m talking about The Rolling Stones. Under My Thumb, co-written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, appeared as a single in April 1966, coinciding with the release of the UK edition of the Aftermath studio album. The song, which features marimba played by the one and only Brian Jones, was also included on the record’s U.S. edition, which came out in July of the same year. Take it way, boys!\n\nLast but not least, here’s a Spotify playlist of the above goodies. Hope you had as much fun as I did being your conductor. See you ya!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIs it really Sunday again? And where did January go? Welcome to another musical excursion through space and time! As always, our itinerary includes six stops in different decades with music in different flavors. Let’s do it!\n\nKenny Dorham/Blue Friday\n\nOpening today’s trip is American jazz trumpeter, composer and occasional vocalist Kenny Dorham. Over his relatively short 25-year career, he became one of the most active bebop trumpeters. He played with the likes of Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins and Max Roach. Starting from late 1953 Dorham also released some 20 albums as leader. Sadly, he passed away from kidney disease at age 48 in December 1972. Blue Friday, a Dorham composition, appeared on his February 1960 album Quiet Kenny. His quartet included Tommy Flanagan (piano), Paul Chambers (bass) and Art Taylor (drums).\n\nElton John/Club At the End of the Street\n\nLet’s next head to August 1989 and a song by Elton John I’ve always liked. I was reminded of Club At the End of the Street the other day when I caught it on the radio in my car. While I generally prefer the piano man’s music during the first half of the ’70s, he has also had some great songs thereafter. Composed by Elton John with lyrics from his longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin, Club At the End of the Street is from John’s 22nd studio album Sleeping with the Past. The song was also released separately as a single in March 1990.\n\nMudcrutch/Scare Easy\n\nA great tip from my longtime German music buddy Gerd takes us back to the current century. Before Tom Petty founded the Heartbreakers, he formed Mudcrutch in 1970, together with Tom Leadon, brother of Eagles co-founder Bernie Leadon, and Mike Campbell who would later join the Heartbreakers. While Mudcrutch gained regional popularity in central Florida and southern Georgia and in 1974 got a deal with Shelter Records in Los Angeles, a single they released failed to chart. Therefore, the label dissolved them, keeping only Petty under contract. Subsequently, he formed the hugely successful Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Fast-forward to August 2007 when Petty invited original Mudcrutch members Randall Marsh and Tom Leadon, Campbell and Benmont Tench (also of the Heartbreakers) to reform Mudcrutch. The first outcome was an eponymous album that appeared in April 2008. Another one, Mudcrutch 2, would follow eight years later. From the first album, here’s Scare Easy, written by Petty.\n\nFats Domino/I’m Walkin’\n\nLet’s jump back 51 years to February 1957. That’s when Fats Domino put out one of his most successful singles, I’m Walkin’. Written by him with frequent collaborator Dave Bartholomew, it was Domino’s third single in a row to top the U.S. R&B Best Sellers chart and also peaked at no. 4 on the pop charts, indicating his crossover appeal. Domino wrote the song after his car had broken down and he overheard a fan say, “Hey, look at Fats Domino, he’s walking!” It’s amazing what a car breakdown can do!\n\nLed Zeppelin/All My Love\n\nOur next stop is August 1979, which saw the release of Led Zeppelin’s eighth and final studio album, In Through the Out Door, prior to their breakup in early December 1980 after the death of drummer John Bonham in September that year. Unlike on Zep’s previous albums, bassist and keyboarder John Paul Jones and vocalist Robert Plant played a much more prominent role. Bonham and guitarist Jimmy Page, who were in the throes of alcoholism and heroin addiction, respectively, oftentimes didn’t show up in time at the recording studio. This left Jones and Plant to put together the songs, with Plant and Bonham adding their parts separately. One of the consequences was the prominent use of the Yamaha GX-1 synthesizer Jones had recently purchased. All My Love is a great example of what this baby could do!\n\nLenny Kravitz/Rock And Roll Is Dead\n\nTime to wrap up our trip. For this we shall go to September 1995 and the fourth studio album by Lenny Kravitz, Circus. Peaking at no. 10 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200, it became his first top 10 album there. In the UK where Kravitz had enjoyed more chart success up to that point, the album hit no. 5, marking his third in a row to reach the top 10. Circus was most successful in Switzerland and The Netherlands where it topped the charts, as well as Australia and Austria where it peaked at no. 2 and no. 3, respectively. Here’s the great opener Rock And Roll Is Dead, whose title Kravitz said was widely taken at face value when he actually was poking fun at life as a rock star.\n\nLast but not least, here’s a Spotify playlist of the above goodies. As always, I hope there’s something for you and that you’ll be back to join me for more music time travel next Sunday!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Saturday and welcome to my new music review! In the middle of December, it’s not surprising that new releases are largely limited to “old music” being offered as reissues and special editions. Since this weekly feature is focused on new music, I decided to use the three remaining posts for this year to take a look back at new music I reviewed in 2023.\n\nBetween my Saturday posts and album reviews, there was a lot new music I featured. While I oftentimes note the charts on this blog (typically when it comes to ’60s and ’70s music), in general, you won’t find Taylor Swift, Drake, Rihanna or other music artists who are frequently on the Billboard Hot 100 nowadays – not because there’s anything wrong with their music, but because it’s simply not what I like to listen to.\n\nIf you’ve visited my new music reviews before, you probably know I tend to look at contemporary music through the lens of my preferences, which are largely shaped by the ’60s and ’70s. While that frame of reference weeds out a good deal of new music, it leaves a remarkable amount to discover, if you’re willing to look beyond the mainstream charts!\n\nHere’s how I intend to tackle this look-back on 2023. The first two posts revisit specific songs I enjoyed. Each post highlights six of them, which are also included in a Spotify playlist, along with other picks. Between the two posts, the playlists include 46 tracks, and I could have added more songs – not too shabby! The third and final installment will focus on my favorite new albums of 2023, which I’m still figuring out as I’m writing this.\n\nHere’s part 1 covering new songs that came out in the first half of the year.\n\nThe Bad Ends/Mile Marker 29\n\nMy first pick are The Bad Ends, an alternative rock band from Athens, Ga. Their website notes the group catalyzed when Mike Mantione (vocals, guitar), who gained initial prominence as frontman of popular Athens band Five Eight in the ’90s, had a chance encounter with Bill Berry (drums, guitar, electric sitar), former drummer of R.E.M. The band also features Christian Lopez (guitars, mandolin, banjo), Geoff Melkonian (keyboards, piano, guitars, vocals) and Dave Domizi (bass, vocals). Mantione and Domizi had been friends since 1991, while Melkonian produced one of Five Eight’s previous albums. The Bad Ends “quietly recorded, produced, and mastered what would become The Power and The Glory“, their great debut album. Here’s the opener Mile Marker 29 – not a bad end at all! And, yep, they definitely can’t deny their hometown!\n\nJoe Louis Walker/Is It a Matter of Time?\n\nGuitarist and singer-songwriter Joe Louis Walker has earned most recognition with blues but isn’t a one-trick pony. According to his bio, the Blues Hall of Fame inductee and six-time Blues Music Award winner has recorded with Ike Turner, Bonnie Raitt, Taj Mahal, and Steve Cropper, opened for Muddy Waters and Thelonious Monk, hung out with Jimi Hendrix, Freddie King, Mississippi Fred McDowell, and was a close friend and roommate of Mike Bloomfield. Walker’s 1986 debut album Cold Is the Night on HighTone announced his arrival in stunning fashion...A brilliantly lyrical guitarist, soulful singer, and prolific songwriter, Walker has toured extensively throughout his career, performing at some of the world’s most renowned music festivals, such as Glastonbury and Montreux, as well as on national television. From his latest album Weight of the World here’s Is It a Matter of Time? penned by Walker – the soulful vibe is totally up my alley!\n\nThe Nude Party/Word Gets Around\n\nThe Nude Party are a band from North Carolina I first featured in January 2022 with their eponymous debut from July 2018. They were formed in 2012 when freshman students at Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C. decided to start a band. Their members are Patton Magee (lead vocals, guitar, harmonica), Shaun Couture (guitar, vocals), Don Merrill (piano, vocals), Alexander Castillo (bass, vocals), Austin Brose (percussion, vocals) and Connor Mikita (drums). At the end of their freshman year, they all moved together to a house outside of town and learned how to play their instruments. It still almost sounds a bit like a fairytale! What’s very real is Word Gets Around, a cool-sounding rocker with a ’60s vibe, off their third and latest studio album Rides On, credited to the entire band!\n\nBilly Tibbals/Hollywood Baby\n\nThis brings me to Billy Tibbals, a Los Angeles-based alternative rock artist. From his Bandcamp bio: Moving from London to Hollywood back in 2014, Billy Tibbals quickly found a love for the city and its esoteric, debauched history. Combining this with his childhood obsession with British rock and roll, surrealist literature, and musicals from the 1940’s, Billy’s music presents a unique and fantastical view of the world around us. As a part of the exciting new wave of rock and roll music emerging from Los Angeles, Billy hopes to inspire the youth to get off their phones and come join in with the fun. Tibbals’ latest inspiration is his debut EP Stay Teenage. Here’s the excellent opener Hollywood Baby, which like all other tracks on the EP was solely written by him.\n\nMarty Stuart & His Fabulous Superlatives/Sitting Alone\n\nAmerican country and bluegrass singer Marty Stuart has been active since the late 1960s. Initially working as a touring musician with Lester Flatt and Johnny Cash, Stuart launched his recording career in 1978 with Marty (With A Little Help From My Friends). He has since released 18 additional albums, including his latest, Altitude, appearing as Marty Stuart & His Fabulous Superlatives. Let’s check out Sitting Alone, penned by Stuart, which reminds me a bit of a Tom Petty – love that jangly guitar sound!\n\nFoo Fighters/The Teacher\n\nWrapping up this post are Foo Fighters with a haunting song from But Here We Are. It’s their first new album since the untimely death of drummer Taylor Hawkins in Bogotá, Columbia in March 2022 at the age of 50 during the band’s tour in South America. A brutally honest and emotionally raw response to everything Foo Fighters endured over the last year, But Here We Are is a testament to the healing powers of music, friendship and family, the band said when announcing the album. The statement added the 10 tracks run the emotional gamut from rage and sorrow to serenity and acceptance, and myriad points in between. Here’s The Teacher, a dark-sounding 10-minute track credited to the entire band – quite an epic song!\n\nHere’s the aforementioned Spotify playlist featuring the above and 18 additional songs from the first half of 2023. Look for Part 2, which is scheduled for next Saturday, December 23.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; The Bad Ends website; Joe Louis Walker website; Billy Tibbals Bandcamp page; Foo Fighters website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Sunday and I hope you’re all spending a lovely weekend. As I’m putting together this post, it’s a rainy day in my neck of the woods in central New Jersey, U.S.A. – in other words, a perfect opportunity to get of this place and embark on another imaginary trip through space and time to visit great music of the past and the present. It’ll be fun, so come and join me!\n\nOliver Nelson/Passion Flower\n\nLet’s ease into our journey with soothing jazz by American saxophonist, clarinetist, arranger, composer and bandleader Oliver Nelson. This takes us back to the beginning of Nelson’s recording career as a solo artist and his 1959 debut album Meet Oliver Nelson. It seems Nelson was destined for music. He began to learn the piano as a six-year-old, followed by the saxophone five years later. By 1947 at age 15, Nelson already performed in local bands in the St. Louis area. In the late ’40s and early ’50s, he played alto saxophone with the Louis Jordan Band. Over his 25-year-plus career, Nelson also worked with many other jazz greats, such as Thelonious Monk, Cannonball Adderley, Sonny Rollins, Wes Montgomery and Buddy Rich. Sadly, Nelson’s life was cut short by a heart attack at age 43 in October 1975. Going back to his aforementioned solo debut, here’s Passion Flower, a beautiful composition by Milt Raskin and Billy Strayhorn.\n\nCordovas/Fallen Angels of Rock ‘n’ Roll\n\nI know prior to embarking on this excursion I cheerfully declared leaving the present behind, but at the end of the day, these Sunday trips are all about great music. And to me, this next contemporary pick by Americana and roots rock band Cordovas perfectly fits that mold. Fallen Angeles of Rock ‘n’ Roll is off their latest album The Rose of Aces, which dropped on August 11. The East Nashville, Tenn. group around singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joe Firstman, who initially gained prominence as bandleader from 2005 to 2009 on NBC’s former late-night TV show Last Call with Carson Daly, has been together since 2011. Fallen Angeles of Rock ‘n’ Roll was co-written by Firstman and Cory Hanson, frontman of Los Angeles rock band Wand. I can hear The Band and The Wallflowers in this country rock gem!\n\nMighty Baby/Egyptian Tomb\n\nIt’s time for another out-of-left-field pick, which once again was suggested to me by my not-so-secret-anymore weapon, aka Gerd. My dear longtime buddy from Germany is a music encyclopedia, and I feel he should consider starting his own blog! I had never heard of British psychedelic band Mighty Baby who were born in early 1969. Among others, they included vocalist Reg King and keyboarder Ian Whiteman, both formerly with The Action, a London-based R&B group discovered by George Martin. According to AllMusic, they were “long considered one of Martin’s best discoveries this side of The Beatles.” Mighty Baby released two studio albums before breaking up in late 1971. Here’s Egyptian Tomb, a cool song from their eponymous November 1969 debut album. Or should we call it mighty?\n\nBlur/No Distance Left to Run\n\nNext the magical music time machine shall take us to March 1999 and 13, the sixth studio album by English alternative rock and Britpop band Blur. They only entered my radar screen in July this year when I featured a song from their ninth and latest album The Ballad of Darren, their first new release since an 8-year hiatus. Blur’s name perfectly reflects the black box that the ’90s largely are to me when it comes to what was then-contemporary music. I noticed some of the group’s most streamed songs on Spotify come from 13. Eventually, this led to my pick, No Distance Left to Run, credited to Damon Albarn (vocals, keyboards, guitar), Graham Coxon (guitar, saxophone, co-lead and backing vocals), Alex James (bass, backing vocals) and Dave Rowntree (drums, percussion), who remain Blur’s members to this day. I realize the lyrics aren’t particularly upbeat, but I still dig this song!\n\nThin Lizzy/The Boys Are Back in Town\n\nTime to kick it up a notch, both in terms of tempo and the lyrics, with a classic by Irish rockers Thin Lizzy. For this stop we go back to March 1976 and the group’s sixth studio album Jailbreak, which overall became their most successful, both in terms of chart performance and sales. Undoubtedly, the single The Boys Are Back in Town had something to do with. It became the band’s biggest U.S. hit and won them the 1976 NME Award for Best Single. Yes, the song hasn’t exactly suffered from underexposure, but I still get a kick out of it, especially that neat dual lead guitar action. Like most of their songs, The Boys Are Back in Town was penned by the band’s frontman, lead vocalist and bassist Phil Lynott.\n\nPeter Gabriel/Shock the Monkey\n\nOnce again, we’re reaching the final stop of yet another Sunday Six. To wrap up things, let’s jump into the next decade to September 1982. That’s when England’s Peter Gabriel released his fourth self-titled solo album, aka Security or Peter Gabriel 4: Security. My Peter Gabriel journey started with his next album So, released in May 1986. At the time, his only other song I knew outside his earlier work with Genesis was the catchy Solsbury Hill. As such, Shock the Monkey and other songs from Security were a bit of an acquired taste. But it didn’t take long for me to come around!\n\nLast but not least, here’s a link to a Spotify playlist featuring all of the above tracks. As always, I hope there’s something for you there and that you’ll be back for more music time travel next Sunday!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIt only took listening to the first few bars of Weight of the World, the title track of Joe Louis Walker’s new album, to get a feeling I would love the music. It turns out my gut was right. Weight of the World, released on February 12, is a warm-sounding and rich collection of original songs, including soul, funk, blues and jazz.\n\nIf you happened to catch my latest Best of What’s New installment from Saturday, you may recall I highlighted one of the album’s tracks, Is It a Matter of Time? As I noted in the post, while I had featured Walker once before in June 2020, I hadn’t explored him any further then. Well, I’m glad I paid more attention this time!\n\nBefore getting to the album, I’d like to provide some background on Walker who picked up the guitar as a child and already started performing during his young teenage years in the mid-’60s. It appears for the first two decades as a professional musician, Walker was a sideman before launching a recording career in the mid-’80s.\n\nFrom his current web bio: Walker has recorded with Ike Turner, Bonnie Raitt, Taj Mahal, and Steve Cropper, opened for Muddy Waters and Thelonious Monk, hung out with Jimi Hendrix, Freddie King, Mississippi Fred McDowell, and was a close friend and roommate of Mike Bloomfield.\n\nWalker’s 1986 debut album Cold Is the Night on HighTone announced his arrival in stunning fashion, and his subsequent output for Verve, Alligator, HighTone, and others only served to further establish Walker as one of today’s leading bluesmen. The New York Times raved, “Walker is a singer with a Cadillac of a voice. His guitar solos are fast, wiry, and incisive, moaning with bluesy despair.” Rolling Stone calls him “ferocious.”\n\nWalker, who is in the Blues Hall of Fame and has won various blues awards, is primarily known as an electric blues guitarist. But his latest album demonstrates his influences extend beyond the blues. Time to take a closer look!\n\nI’d like to kick things off with the great aforementioned title track The Weight of the World. The beautiful soul tune was penned by album producer Eric Corne who shared writing duties with Walker and provided guitar and backing vocals. Corne is a Canada-born and Los Angeles-based producer, engineer and singer-songwriter. His bio reveals impressive recording credits, including John Mayall, Glen Campbell, Kim Deal (The Pixies), Lucinda Williams and Walter Trout, among others.\n\nI’m skipping the previously noted Is It a Matter of Time? and go right to Hello, It’s the Blues. The soulful ballad was written by Walker. Beautiful!\n\nDon’t Walk Out That Door is another standout on the album and may in fact be my early favorite. This gem, which was co-written by Walker and Gabriel Jagger, sounds like sweet “old-fashioned” soul you could picture having come out of Stax – so good!\n\nNext things turn funky on Count Your Chickens. This is another track written by Corne -groovy stuff!\n\nHow ’bout some kickass rock & roll? Look no further than Blue Mirror, penned by Walker. Yeah, baby, it’s only rock & roll but I like it. Check out the neat guitar and honky tonk piano action!\n\nLet’s do one more. Did I mention jazz? Here’s the album’s fun closer You Got Me Whipped, another track written by Walker.\n\nWeight of the World, which appears on Forty Below Records, was recorded “just outside of Woodstock, NY.” This review wouldn’t be complete without acknowledging the fine musicians who backed Walker. In addition to Corne, they include Scott Milici (keyboards), Marc Pender (trumpet), David Ralicke (saxophone), Eric Gorfain (violins), Gia Ciambotti (backing vocals), Geoff Murfitt (bass), Eddie Jackson (bongos) and John Medeiros Jr. (drums).\n\nHere’s a Spotify link to the album:\n\nWalker is supporting the album with a tour that is kicking off this Friday (February 24) in Beacon, N.Y. After a few additional dates in Woonsocket, R.I.; Northhampton, Mass. and Boston, Mass., he’s going to Europe, including France, Switzerland and Norway. The current schedule is here. I would love to see him, but unfortunately, none of the current dates work for me. I’m hoping for a second U.S. leg later this year or catch him some other time!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Joe Louis Walker website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIt’s Sunday and I hope everybody is feeling groovy. Let’s embark on another journey to the magical world of music to leave any worries behind, at least temporarily, or simply have a great time! As usual, the trip is eclectic, involving six tunes from different decades in different flavors.\n\nThelonious Monk/Ruby My Dear\n\nToday, our time machine first takes us to the year 1951 and beautiful music by American jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk. The second most recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington, Monk was active as a jazz performer mostly from the early 1940s until the mid-1970s. Apart from a sizable amount of releases under his name, Monk also recorded as a sideman with the likes of Art Blakey, Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins. During the final 10 years of his life, he only made a small number of appearances due to his declining health. Monk passed away from a stroke in February 1982 at the age of 64. Ruby My Dear, one of his many compositions that became jazz standards, was first recorded in October 1947 for Genius of Modern Music, a compilation of Monk’s first recordings as band leader for the Blue Note label, which exists in four different versions released at different times. The earliest came out in 1951. Aw, so soothing!\n\nTonio K./I Can’t Stop\n\nNext, we jump to the late ’80s and a tune by Tonio K. The American singer-songwriter first entered my radar screen in December 2021 when I featured You, a gem he wrote together with John Shanks and Bob Thiele for Bonnie Raitt’s 12th studio album Longing in Their Hearts released in March 1994. K. (born Steven M. Krikorian) has also penned tunes for Al Green, Aaron Neville, Chicago and Wynonna Judd, among many others. In addition to that he has released nine solo albums to date, something fellow blogger Max from PowerPop reminded me of the other when he posted about Life in the Foodchain, K.’s solo debut from 1978. This brings me to I Can’t Stop, a funky song from his fifth solo release Notes from the Lost Civilization, which came out in 1988. Beware, this song with its cool guitar and organ parts is pretty infectious and couldn’t have a better title!\n\nThe Youngbloods/Foolin’ Around (The Waltz)\n\nNo Sunday Six journey can leave out the ’60s. This time, our stop is January 1967, which saw the release of the eponymous debut album by The Youngbloods. Oftentimes, the American rock band is only remembered for their sole U.S. top 40 hit Get Together, which upon re-release in 1969 peaked at no. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. While they may have been a one-hit wonder, the group had other great songs. But they never achieved widespread popularity and disbanded in 1972. After a reunion in late 1984 for a brief tour, The Youngbloods broke up again in mid-1985. Coming back to their first album, here Foolin’ Around (The Waltz), written by co-founder Jesse Colin Young. If I see this correctly, this wasn’t released as a single – perhaps the unusual change from 4/4 to 3/4 time signature didn’t make it particularly radio-friendly.\n\nAlice Cooper/School’s Out\n\nThe other day, I found myself listening to the radio in my car while running an errand when School’s Out by Alice Cooper came on. Christian couldn’t help himself but turn up the volume and sing along full throttle – it was probably a good thing no one else was around and all car windows were closed! This tune took me back to my school days and my only spontaneous protest against teachers when singing along to Pink Floyd’s Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) during a classroom party. When our classroom (English) teacher walked in, he briefly smiled before putting on a more serious facial expression. We quickly stopped singing. Anyway, that’s my longwinded intro to the great Alice Cooper tune, which first appeared in April 1972 as the lead single to the rock band’s fifth studio album with the same title – also a good reminder that before Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier) started performing solo under this name in 1975, there was the band Alice Cooper, which 16-year-old Furnier co-founded in 1964 as The Earwigs with four high school mates to enter a local talent show. After cycling through a couple of other names, they became Alice Cooper in 1968. School’s Out, credited to all members of the band, became their biggest international hit and arguably their signature song. Feel free to scream along! 🙂\n\nThe Verve/Bittersweet Symphony\n\nAnd we’re on to the ’90s and Urban Hymns, the third studio album by English Britpop band The Verve, which appeared in September 1997. Seven years after their formation, not only did it bring them their first no. 1 album in the UK but also broad international sales and chart success. In fact, Urban Hymns became the group’s biggest seller and the 19th best-selling album in UK chart history. It almost didn’t happen. After The Verve had gone through some physical and mental turmoil, frontman and lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft broke up the group in September 1995. While he reunited with two of their members a few weeks thereafter, guitarist Nick McGabe at first refused to return. In early 1997, Ashcroft changed the guitarist’s mind, and he rejoined the band for the ongoing Urban Hymns recording sessions. But the group’s biggest success couldn’t prevent their second split in April 1999. They reformed one more time in 2007 and released one additional album the following year before breaking up again in 2009 – this time for good. Bittersweet Symphony, written by Ashcroft, first appeared as the lead single from Urban Hymns in June 1997. But the single’s success was, well, bittersweet. Following a lawsuit finding The Verve illegally had taken a sample from a 1965 version of The Rolling Stones’ The Last Time by The Andrew Oldham Orchestra, all royalties were relinquished and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were added to the songwriting credits. In 2019, after the death of Allen Klein, the Stones’ manager at the time of the litigation, Jagger and Richards ceded the rights to Ashcroft.\n\nJonathan Wilson/Love to Love\n\nAnd once again, another Sunday Six trip is reaching its final destination, which takes us to the current century. When my former German bandmate and longtime music buddy recently recommended that I check out Fanfare, the second studio album by Jonathan Wilson, the name rang a distant bell. I couldn’t help and search my blog, which revealed Wilson produced Misadventures of Doomscroller, the excellent eighth studio album by American rock band Dawes, which I reviewed here in early January. Apart from his work as a producer for 10-plus years, Wilson has also released a series of solo albums and EPs since 2007. The above-noted Fanfare came out in 2013. Here is Love to Love, which like most other tunes on the album was solely written by Wilson. I’m really beginning to like this man!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nWelcome to another installment of The Sunday Six. After a two-week hiatus, it’s nice to get back into the blogging groove again. At the same time, taking a break wasn’t a bad thing, especially in this case where I used some of the time for a long-sought vacation in Germany to see some family and friends again. Following is a small collage of photos from my visit.\n\nTime to get to some music. Three of the picks are inspired by my recent visit to Germany.\n\nSonny Rollins/In a Sentimental Mood\n\nOur journey today starts with beautiful music by American tenor saxophone great Sonny Rollins, who is widely recognized as one of the most important and influential jazz musicians. Over an incredible 70-year-plus career, Rollins has recorded more than 60 albums as a leader and appeared on many additional records as a sideman. He has played with the likes of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Max Roach and Modern Jazz Quartet. In a Sentimental Mood, composed by Duke Ellington, Manny Kurtz and Irving Mills, is among Rollins’ earliest recordings as a leader. It appeared on a 1956 compilation album, Sonny Rollins with the Modern Jazz Quartet. On this particular tune, he was backed by John Lewis (piano), Milt Jackson (vibraphone), Percy Heath (bass) and Kenny Clarke (drums). My kind of music to ease into a Sunday morning.\n\nWolf Maahn/Irgendwo in Deutschland\n\nNext, we jump to 1984 and the first German-language song featured in The Sunday Six: Irgendwo in Deutschland (somewhere in Germany), the title track of the third studio album by German rock artist Wolf Maahn. The singer-songwriter, actor and producer, who was born in Berlin in 1955 and grew up in Munich, initially started his music career in 1976 as a founding member of the Food Band. Mixing soul, jazz, pop and rock, this group sang in English. Wolf Maahn’s “German language music career” kicked off in the early ’80s with the studio album Deserteure. He gained broad national popularity in the mid ’80s, starting with the Irgendwo in Deutschland album. I listened to that song in my rental car on the day I arrived in Germany. That’s when I decided I would feature it in a Sunday Six.\n\nArthur Conley/Sweet Soul Music\n\nI’m in the mood for some soul and the other day I remembered a tune I’ve always loved, loved: Sweet Soul Music, a big U.S. hit for Arthur Conley in 1967, climbing to no. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the UK, it peaked at no. 7 on the Official Singles Chart. The song, which also became the title track of an album Conley released the same year, was co-written by him and Otis Redding – and Sam Cooke. It’s a version of Cooke’s Yeah Man, a tune that appeared on Cooke’s first posthumous studio album Shake from January 1965. Initially, they didn’t give him any credit. Cooke’s estate eventually sued Conley and Redding and received songwriting credit and a settlement.\n\nDel Amitri/Always the Last to Know\n\nDuring my visit to Germany, I met my former bandmate and longtime music buddy who always gives me great trip listening tips. The next two picks are inspired by him. First, he reminded me of Scottish alternative rock band Del Amitri, who were formed in Glasgow in 1980. During their initial run until 2002, they released six studio albums and two compilations. Since the band reemerged from hiatus in 2013, it looks like they have mainly been a touring act. Only one live record, one compilation and one studio album have since appeared. Always the Last to Know takes us back to their third studio album Change Everything released in June 1992. Written by Justin Currie (vocals, guitar, piano), who remains with Del Amitri to this day, the tune also became the album’s lead single in April 1992 – a nice melodic pop rock tune!\n\nThe Sadies/Stop and Start\n\nThis next pick is from the new album by Canadian band The Sadies, Colder Streams, released on July 22. From their AllMusic bio: One of the most accomplished bands to emerge from the North American indie and roots rock scene, the Sadies are an eclectic group founded by brothers Dallas Good and Travis Good, who crafted a distinctive sound, absorbing influences from traditional country, surf music, and garage rock, and blending them into something unique with their estimable instrumental skills. The band’s best work emphasized mood as much as melody, and they were open to collaboration with artists they respected, cutting albums with Neko Case, John Doe, Gord Downie, and Andre Williams. Here’s Stop and Start, credited to all four members of the band at the time of the recording. Sadly, Dallas Good died unexpectedly on February 17, 2022, at the age of 48 from a recently detected heart condition.\n\nThe Knack/My Sharona\n\nAnd once again, we’ve reached the final stop of yet another Sunday Six. Let’s wrap up with a fun tune by Los Angeles power pop band The Knack: My Sharona, their first single that became an international sensation, topping the charts in the U.S., Canada and Australia, peaking at no. 3 in New Zealand and reaching the top 10 in the UK, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. The song’s huge popularity also propelled the band’s debut album Get the Knack to no. 1 in the U.S., Canada and Australia – a level of success the band never managed to replicate. After their third album, they split for the first time in mid-1982. The Knack had a few reunions thereafter until their permanent end in February 2010, following the death of the band’s lead vocalist and guitarist Doug Fieger from cancer at the age of 57.\n\nHere’s a playlist of the above tunes. Hope there’s something there you like.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nAnother Sunday morning is upon us, at least in my neck of the woods (Central New Jersey, USA). Of course, this means it’s time to embark on another journey to celebrate music of the past six decades, six tunes at a time.\n\nJulius Rodriguez/Gift of the Moon\n\nThis trip starts in the present. The immediate present. Julius Rodriguez, aka Orange Julius, is an American pianist, drummer and composer, whose music combines elements of jazz, avant-garde, R&B, hip-hop and pop. He started studying classical piano at a young age, or I should say at an even younger age – he’s only 23 years old! His father, a jazz connoisseur, introduced him to artists like Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and John Coltrane. Rodriguez has been an active touring member of New York jazz combo Onyx Collective, and has worked as a sideman with numerous other artists like Macy Gray, Wynton Marsalis and Nick Hakim. And, yes, in addition to all of that, Rodriguez has been releasing music under his own name and the Orange Julius moniker since 2015. Here’s Gift of the Moon, off his new album Let Sound Tell All, which appeared on June 10.\n\nJohn & Yoko & Plastic Ono Band/New York City\n\nNow let’s kick it up with some great rock & roll. One artist I’ve always loved in this context is John Lennon. I recall reading somewhere that John said the rock & roll covers The Beatles played at the Star-Club in Hamburg and the Cavern in Liverpool before they were famous were the best music they ever performed. Of course, John said many things about The Beatles after they had broken up, which seemed to dismiss their original music. While I don’t agree with some of his remarks, I think he’s right The Beatles were a great rock & roll band. John was a great rock & roll singer, which he not only demonstrated on his 1975 covers album Rock ‘n’ Roll but also on this tune: New York City, a track that appeared in June 1972 on a double LP titled Some Time in New York City, released as John & Yoko/Plastic Ono Band with Elephant’s Memory – rolls right of your tongue! Go, Johnny, go – que pasa New York!\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival/Born On the Bayou\n\nI don’t know about you, I’m in the mood for more rock. Let’s go to 1969 and the swamp. I trust Creedence Clearwater Revival, aka CCR, don’t need an introduction. If you’d like a crash course, check this AllMusic bio. Like most CCR tunes, Born On the Bayou was penned by the group’s leader John Fogerty. Yes, the man had pretty strong opinions, which he oftentimes imposed on his bandmates. And, yes, I feel sometimes they don’t get the credit they deserve. But there’s no doubt John knew what he was doing. Born On the Bayou is the lead track of CCR’s sophomore album Bayou Country, which appeared in January 1969. It also was released separately as the B-side to the record’s single Proud Mary. In my humble opinion, Born On the Bayou should have been a separate single, and it should have been an A-side – man, I love this tune!\n\nAsia/Heat of the Moment\n\nAnd next, we find ourselves back in ’82. When I caught Heat of the Moment by Asia on the radio the other day, it reminded me of what a catchy tune it is. Growing up in the ’80s back in Germany, I loved much of the music that came out during that decade. I suppose you could say, well, it was in the heat of the moment! While I can’t deny a certain remaining weak spot, nowadays I’m no longer as fond of ’80s music. That being said, some songs are holding up pretty well to me. One is Asia’s debut single, co-written by the band’s John Wetton (lead vocals, bass) and Geoff Downes (keyboards, vocals), which appeared on their eponymous debut album, released in March 1982. After they broke up in 1986, Asia reunited in 1989 and remain active to this day, with Downes as the only original member.\n\nThe Wallflowers/Shy of the Moon\n\nUndoubtedly, being a music artist and offspring of Bob Dylan poses challenges. But I feel Jakob Dylan, a son of Bob and his first wife Sara Dylan (born Shirley Marlin Noznisky), has done pretty well. While Jakob played guitar in various high school bands and was featured as a guitar player on his friends’ group’s eponymous 1987 album, Trash Matinee, he didn’t start focusing on a professional music career until 1989. Together with his childhood friend Tobi Miller (lead guitar) he began forming a band called The Apples. After Barrie Maguire (bass), Peter Yanowitz (drums) and Rami Yafee (keyboards) had joined the group, they changed their name to The Wallflowers and released their eponymous debut album in August 1992. The Wallflowers are still around, though it’s now a music project by Dylan with a revolving cast of touring musicians. Here’s Shy of the Moon, the great openers of The Wallflowers’ above-noted eponymous debut album. Like all except one of the remaining tracks on the album, the tune was penned by Dylan.\n\nSouthern Avenue/Keep On\n\nAnd once again another music trip has arrived at its final stop. If you’re a more frequent visitor of the blog, you probably recall Southern Avenue are one of my favorite contemporary bands. They are also among the nicest, down-to-earth professional musicians I’ve met. The group from Memphis, Tenn., which has been around since 2015, blends blues and soul with flavors of contemporary R&B. I also love the racial diversity they represent. Southern Avenue are Israeli blues guitarist Ori Naftaly; two amazing African American ladies, lead vocalist Tierinii Jackson and her sister Tikyra Jackson who plays the drums and sings backing vocals; white bassist Evan Sarver; and African American keyboarder Jeremy Powell. Tellingly, in 2016 they became the first new act signed to Stax Records in many years. Here’s the great title track of their sophomore album Keep On, released in May 2019.\n\nThis post wouldn’t be complete without a Spotify playlist of the above tunes. Hope there’s something you enjoy!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; YouTube, Spotify"
