        "text": "Thelonious Monk discovered an improvisational, unique style of music that cannot be duplicated. He not only had a distinctive sound, but also an extraordinary vocabulary, fashion sense, rhythm, and sense of humor. He led the bebop-jazz evolution and is the best known composer of his century. Bebop was the new style of jazz that incorporated upbeat tempos, melodies, and intricate harmonies. This form of jazz was prestigious and was only played for listening audiences, not dancing audiences.\n\nOn this day, February 17th, in 1982, Thelonious Monk dies at age 64 in Englewood, New Jersey due to a stroke. Monk was notable for playing the piano with flattened fingers and occasional elbows to produce his unique sound. Although he did not make many public appearances while alive, his music was unearthed shortly after his death and is rated in the company of Miles Davis and John Coltrane.\n\nSadly, Monk is one of the most prejudged musicians in history, and his music is often overshadowed by negative commentary. Nonetheless, Monk gained notable success from his albums, was attributed a U.S. Postal Service stamp, and a jazz institute in his name that promotes and educates people in jazz. To this day, Monkâ€™s work continues to inspire various artists."
