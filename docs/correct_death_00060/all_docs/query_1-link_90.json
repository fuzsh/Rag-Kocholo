        "text": "Jazz trumpet and flugelhorn virtuoso Clark Terry, whose illustrious career spanned more than seven decades, died in the company of family, friends and students on Saturday. He was 94.\n\n“We will miss him every minute of every day, but he will live on through the beautiful music and positivity that he gave to the world,” wrote his wife Gwen, in a message posted on Facebook. “Clark will live in our hearts forever.”\n\nThe legendary trumpeter played along some of the greatest jazz musicians of all time, including Dizzy Gillespie, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk and Duke Ellington.\n\nOutside of performing, Clark was heralded as an influential educator. Over the years, he held numerous high school and collegiate jazz clinics, hosted summer camps for musicians and was also an adjunct professor at William Paterson University in New Jersey."
