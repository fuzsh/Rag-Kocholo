Complete Genius?\n\n6474 Genius 2 Japan?\n\n1980 Japan King K23P-6722 \"Genius Monk\"\n\nSome tidbits about BN (stolen from microgroove - http://microgroove.jp/bluenote-jpn/):\n\n* The \"1200\" series consists of 8 records by either Sidney Bechet or George Lewis, reissuing earlier 78 and 10 inch releases.\n\n* The \"1500\" series commenced in 1955, with catalogue numbers starting at 1501, and running through 1600, released in 1958. The early releases in this series are reissues of earliier 10\" releases primarily from the early 50's, including records by Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Art Blakey, Bud Powell and others.\n\n* The \"4000\" series starts with 4001 (\"Newk's Time\" by Sonny Rollins, released in mono in 1958, stereo, 1959, the year of the first Blue Note stereo releases), and peters out about 400 releases later, (although as noted things get very spotty after around 4250).\n\n* The first number with a stereo release was 1562 - \"The Stylings of Silver\" by Horace Silver, although it was not released until two years after the initial 1957 mono release. There are stereo releases of all subsequent records, except for Sonny Rollins' \"A Night at the Village Vanguard\" (1582), although some of these only became available in the context of later reissue series. (For example, the stereo release of Johnny Griffin's \"The Congregation\" first appeared in 1994 as part of the Connoisseur series.) 1500 series stereo releases have the same catalogue numbers as their mono counterparts; in the 4000 series, stereo releases have an 8 prefixed (e.g. the stereo release of the aforementioned \"Newk's Time\" is 84001). (In referring to records in this series, I will use the 4000 number, although all of these I own, save one, are stereo.) There are \"electronically rechanneled stereo\" releases, dating from the 60's and 70's of mono-only recordings. Some of these, however, are in fact just the monos; check the inner margin, and see if there is the mono catalogue number engraved (i.e. without a prefixed 8). There are also two issues from 1962 on the 9000 series of vocal releases, 9001 \"My Hour of Need\" by Dodo Greene and 9002 \"Portrait of Sheila\" by Sheila Jordan.\n\nLast infos for the road:\n\n547 1948\n\nEvonce / Off Minor\n\nIdrees Sulieman (tp) Danny Quebec West (as) Billy Smith (ts) Thelonious Monk (p) Gene Ramey (b) Art Blakey (d)\n\nWOR Studios, NYC, October 15, 1947\n\nBN309-4 Evonce\n\nThelonious Monk (p) Gene Ramey (b) Art Blakey (d)\n\nWOR Studios, NYC, October 24, 1947\n\nBN317-1 Off Minor\n\nhttp://static.rateyourmusic.com/album_images/793266.jpg\n\n********\n\n548 1948\n\nIn Walked Bud / Epistrophy\n\nGeorge Taitt (tp) Sahib Shihab (as) Thelonious Monk (p) Bob Paige (b) Art Blakey (d)\n\nWOR Studios, NYC, November 21, 1947\n\nBN318-3 In Walked Bud\n\nMilt Jackson (vib) Thelonious Monk (p) John Simmons (b) Shadow Wilson (d)\n\nApex Studios, NYC, July 2, 1948\n\nBN330-0 Epistrophy\n\n10\" 78 RPM (500 serie):\n\nBN 542: Suburban Eyes c/w Thelonious\n\nBN 543: Well, You Needn't c/w 'Round About Midnight\n\nBN 547: Evonce c/w Off Minor\n\nBN 548: In Walked Bud c/w Epistrophy\n\nBN 549: Ruby, My Dear c/w Evidence\n\nBN 560: Humph c/w Misterioso\n\n10\" 78 RPM (1500 serie):\n\nBN 1564: Thelonious Monk - I Mean You c/w Tadd Dameron - Symphonette\n\nBN 1565: Monk's Mood c/w Who Knows\n\nBN 1575: Nice Work If You Can Get It c/w April In Paris\n\nBN 1589: Four In One c/w Straight, No Chaser\n\nBN 1590: Criss Cross c/w Eronel\n\nBN 1591: Ask Me Now c/w Willow Weep For Me\n\n10\" 78 RPM (1600 serie):\n\nBN 1602: Skippy c/w Let's Cool One\n\nBN 1603: Hornin' In c/w Carolina Moon\n\n10\" 78 RPM (1200 serie):\n\nBN 1201: All The Things You Are c/w I Should Care\n\n7\" 45 RPM (1600 serie):\n\n45-1646 Milt Jackson - Lillie c/w Willow Weep For Me\n\n45-1664 'Round About Midnight c/w In Walked Bud\n\n10\" LP (5000 serie):\n\nBLP 5002: Genius of Modern Music\n\n* TOJJ-5002 Feb. 24, 1999 Japan \"Original 10-inch LP Collection from BN5000 Part 1\", Limited Edition, by Toshiba EMI\n\nBLP 5009: Genius of Modern Music, Volume 2\n\n* TOJJ-5009 Feb. 24, 1999 Japan \"Original 10-inch LP Collection from BN5000 Part 1\", Limited Edition, by Toshiba EMI\n\nBLP 5011: Milt Jackson - Wizard Of The Vibes\n\n* BN0005 Japan Mar. 27, 1991 “Blue Note Original 5000 Series Collection”, Limited Edition, by Toshiba EMI\n\n* TOJJ-5011 Feb. 24, 1999 Japan \"Original 10-inch LP Collection from BN5000 Part 1\", Limited Edition, by Toshiba EMI\n\n12\" LP (1500 serie):\n\nBLP 1509: Milt Jackson And The Thelonious Monk Quintet\n\n* Nov. 25, 1970 Japan as NR-8835\n\n* (?)
