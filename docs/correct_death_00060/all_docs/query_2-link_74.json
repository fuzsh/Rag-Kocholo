        "text": "Intergenerational Jazz Power Jam will take place on Sunday, October 10, 2021 at 2pm at The National Jazz Museum in Harlem\n\nNew York City, September 20, 2021 – Next month we celebrate the birthday of iconic composer and pianist Thelonious Monk! Our INTERGENERATIONAL JAZZ POWER JAM series continues live in-person on Sunday, October 10, 2021 at 2 PM EST. Presented by The National Jazz Museum in Harlem, “Celebrating Thelonious Monk’s Birthday with Chembo Corniel’s Afro Blue Monk Project” is our October jam, featuring bandleader and percussionist, Chembo Corniel.\n\nDue to covid-19 restrictions, seating at the museum is very limited but you can tune in through Facebook and YouTube Live at jazzpower.org/powerjam2021 Sunday, October 10, 2021 at 2 PM EST.\n\nProduced by Jazz Power Initiative, the uptown New York City based non-profit organization transforming lives through jazz arts education and community programs, our October Intergenerational Jazz Power Jam features The Afro Blue Monk Project, known for their Afro Caribbean rhythms and harmonies that convey the foundational essence of Latin jazz, in a fun, family-friendly celebration featuring performances by Chembo Corniel (Band Leader/ Percussion), Carlos Cuevas (Piano), Joel E. Mateo (Drums), Ian Stewart (Electric Bass), Hery Paz (Tenor Sax/Flute) and surprise guests.\n\n“Thelonious Monk’s music is filled with Caribbean influences, rooted in the west side NYC neighborhood he was raised in, San Juan Hill. Celebrated band leader, recording artist and conguero Chembo Corniel brings an inspired take on the Monk-Caribbean connection – and mixes it with the music of Mongo Santamaria, the Afro Cuban composer of Afro Blue and other classics. We are so excited to celebrate Monk with his extraordinary musicianship.” – Eli Yamin\n\nINTERGENERATIONAL JAZZ POWER JAM is presented by The National Jazz Museum in Harlem and produced by Jazz Power Initiative, a Northern Manhattan community arts non-profit organization for jazz music education and performance. We thank all of our supporters: The New York State Council for the Arts; The New York City Department of Cultural Affairs; the New York City Council and Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez; The Miranda Family Fund; The Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation, and our individual donors.\n\nAbout the artist:\n\nIan Stewart – Electric Bass: Ian Stewart was born and raised in Syracuse NY, upon graduation Ian continued his studies at State University of New York at Purchase College where he received his BM in Jazz Studies in 2008. Here he would have the ability to study and take classes under Todd Coolman, John Faddis, Ray Vega, Charles Blenzig, Doug Weiss, Kermit Driscoll, Gerard Hecht, Pete Malinverni, Doug Munro and many other members of the Conservatory’s esteemed faculty.
