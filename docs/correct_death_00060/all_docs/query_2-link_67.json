        "text": "(Updated March 24: matrixes of 1st edition)\n\nRecords inexplicably not previously posted. I had occasion to want to check something regarding 1558, went to my pages, only to find it not there. No there there at all. No longer overlooked, but … dissected as an object lesson in how to identify later Blue Note pressings from first/earlier pressings. LJC proudly sponsored by Specsavers.\n\nBN 1558, Sonny Rollins Volume 2, notable for the rare presence of Thelonious Monk and Horace Silver playing together, on the Monk composition “Misterioso”.\n\nSelection: Misterioso\n\nhttps://londonjazzcollector.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sonny-rollins-misterioso-bn1558-volume-2-1961-repress-rvg-ear.mp3\n\n. . .\n\nArtists\n\nJJ Johnson, trombone; Sonny Rollins, tenor sax; Horace Silver, Thelonious Monk, piano; Paul Chambers, bass; Art Blakey, drums. Recorded Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ, April 14, 1957, released September 1957.\n\nMusic\n\nWhile being seduced by the liquid spaciousness of post bop, the freedom-run of leaning further out, this second Rollins album for Blue Note is a good reminder of the pure craftsmanship of the masters at work.\n\nThis all-star fathers of bop convention at Hackensack sees Monk and Silver sharing the piano seat for just the one track, move over, Monk as devilish as always, perhaps more so in the presence of Horace Silver, the piano which smiles. Silver takes the second solo, something which requires some nerve, and four of the five remaining tracks.\n\nRollins is powerful over Monk’s eccentric “comping”, which is peppered with sudden empty spaces and unexpected turns in direction. J.J offers a “second horn” synced with Rollins in textures, harmonies and polished brass lines, all held carefully together by Blakey and Chambers.\n\nQuite a different album from Rollins “Volume 1” which more showcases Sonny, while “Volume 2” rewards you with more ensemble playing. Should be on everyone’s shelf.\n\nVinyl: BNLP 1558\n\nIn the light of recent questions about unexpected combinations of Van Gelder stamps, I take this album as interesting case study in identifying Blue Note provenance. “Original Blue Note” but not the original first pressing. Sadly for me, four small details gives it away. It’s Sherlock Time, let’s go deep dive:\n\nCover: lovely laminated cover, blank spine, 63rd address, all good signs. Printing on the spine first appeared in Spring 1958 so blank spine may be earlier. The back cover Blue Note address changed from 47W63rd to 43W61st in early 1960, so the cover has some signs of early provenance. But it is betrayed by the incorporated company address form on the bottom of the rear slick, Blue Note Records Inc.\n\nFirst killer clue. The incorporated address appears on Blue Note covers from mid 1959 onwards, two years after the release of BN 1558. The cover having 63rd address is therefore likely from a batch manufactured in 1960, as a year later, the cover address would have been 43W61st.\n\nLabels: 47W63rd New York 23 label both sides , no INC. no ®, “original labels” Apparently drawn from labels left over from the first pressing print run.\n\nVinyl: deep groove only Side 2, ridge Side 1. That is the second killer clue. Non-deep groove dies first came into service at Plastylite in early 1961, four years after the first release of BN 1558. Though one-side deep groove pressings are common on Blue Note pressings , in this case it absolutely rules out any possibility of being an early pressing.\n\nRun-out: Plastylite P, 9M (Side 1 only) , RVG stamped. Stamped RVG initials are the third killer clue. In early 1957, Van Gelder masters bore hand-etched RVG initials. RVG stamped initials first appear around Summer 1957 and feature until early 1962, when they were replaced by the full “VAN GELDER” stamp. 1st edition 1558 requires hand-etched RVG both sides. In this case the RVG stamp signals the original master has been replaced (upgraded?) by a Van Gelder re-cut.\n\nMatrix: number suffix -2 both sides: Rudy’s 3rd cut! There have been sightings of pressings which have a hand-etch RVG one side and stamped on the other, not as yet determined whether matrix indicates first cut, 1st re-cut or second re-cut (UPDATE: see foot of post for original 1st Edition matrixes)\n\nThe stamped RVG initials, the absence of deep groove one side, together with a 1960 manufactured cover, identifies it as an original Blue Note, but a re-pressing from around 1961, four years after 1st release.\n\nCollector’s Corner\n\nRe-cuts and their matrix suffix codes has been bothering me of late, and this A-2/B-2 combination added more fuel to the fire. There have been hundreds of auctions of 1558, selling for up to $800, and Van Gelder recuts generally pass beneath the seller’s radar. Just two or three sellers noted them, and then with little insight other than repeat what they see. BN 1558 had a tangled past!\n\nA dip into Discogs fishes up an unusual case where the Discogs uploader has a grip on what they describe as a “second pressing”, even including pictures of the etchings, thank you, sir! I’m not sure we know enough yet to start numbering pressings without a lot more homework, and some understanding of how one pressing differs from another. In this case a change in labels is probably the least important thing, as old stock labels can have a long life, spanning up to decade on some records. With BN 1558 there is at least one underlying change in mastering, possibly more.\n\nLets see if we can do better and nail the date this alleged “2nd pressing”.\n\nThe cover address is without INC, so manufactured before mid-59.\n\nThe labels as seen below are no INC or ®, still 47W63rd, but slightly more recent address: simply 63rd NYC, not New York 23. The New York 23 address appears only on records released between late Spring and Summer of 1957, at least six months after the first release of BN 1558. To some, that would make this correctly a “second pressing” on account of the address change.\n\nDeep groove both sides, nice, but the matrix codes are what throws a spanner in the works:\n\nSide 1 has the same second recut suffix -A-2 and the same stamped RVG, but Side 2 has a first re-cut suffix -B-1 and RVG hand etched. This is a re-pressing which sits somewhere between the 1957 original pressing and my 1961 repressing, manufactured likely somewhere between 1958 and 1959.\n\nFresh labels with the 63rd NYC address were printed, despite the existence of older labels in inventory – which turn up later on my 1961 repress. A takeaway point is that old stock labels were not necessarily always used up chronologically, oldest first, before new ones were printed. An older label can turn up on a newer pressing and vice versa.\n\nAny more for more?\n\nA “fourth re-pressing” appears on New York USA Labels, with a A-2 B-2 matrix observed by just one or two sellers, with “RVG” stamped, so re-cuts appear to have stopped at 2 and continued repressing with same legacy metal.\n\nIt remained for our friends Liberty to bring out a first stereo edition – a Bert-Co West Coast pressing shown below.\n\nBN 1558 was one of the first recordings Van Gelder made on two-track tape, stereo intended for mono, so good luck all who sail in her, not one for me. The Division of United Artists edition from around 1972 – unusually for that series – follows the stereo path too, as does the UA blue label black note, none of which are Rudy’s mastering as it looks like he never prepared a stereo master for 1558.\n\nQuestions\n\nBlue Note Suffix codes are largely undocumented, rarely recorded, and poorly understood. Conventional wisdom says if Van Gelder wasn’t happy with the first cut, he would simply re-cut it and add an increment of one to the matrix code. However it looks like some make it to commercial release, and there were later recuts.\n\nIs there another cutting of Side 1 before A-2? We know there is a -B-1. Is there an -A-1 or did Van Gelder need three goes at Side 1 to get it right? Is there an original master first cut with no suffixes, or did Rudy scrap his initial attempt at mastering and jump straight to A-2 / B-1? Why is there a -B-2 anyway?\n\nIf you have any variation on those identified here – particularly an actual 1957 1st Edition of 1558, it would be great if you would give us the lowdown on matrix codes and etchings. Pictures would be even better.\n\nMarch 24, UPDATE! Jim R has an eye-watering collection of original Blue Notes, including two first edition copies of 1558. Here is what his camera reveals:\n\nWell, I’ll be hornswoggled! The 1st edition of 1558 features Rudy’s first cut of Side 1: BNLP 1558-A no suffix (you can see the hand etched RVG in the corner). Side 2 is first re-cut: BNLP 1558-B-1 (also RVG hand-etched)\n\nVan Gelder made at least two viable cuts of Side 1: -A and later A-2. He also made two viable cuts of Side 2: -B-1 and later -B-2.\n\nFirst cut -B and recut A-1 were both discarded and superceded.\n\nIt has been suggested that re-mastering recordings might be for wholly innocent reasons: Rudy accidentally dropped the acetate, or spilled his coffee on it. But twice? No, what if there was a less innocent reason. Van Gelder was a perfectionist in engineering quality. This is a man who crept about his studio wearing gloves. Something in the original recording needed fixing, there was something he wasn’t happy with his original efforts to fix it, nor his first effort to fix it.\n\nWhere is the YouTube: Van Gelder discusses BNLP 1558 ? What Rudy Did, and What Rudy Did Next? No There there.\n\nOne further thought. When Liberty and later United Artists came to prepare a stereo master from the original (or copy) tapes, they would be probably unaware of what drove Rudy unusually to make three attempts at each side. Perhaps mono -A-2 and -B-2 matrixes offer us the best of What Rudy Did? Who’d be a First Pressing Fundamentalist now…\n\nLJC\n\n]]> A break from the Boogaloo and later ’60s directions, back firmly in the ’50s mainstream when music giants roamed the earth, mono ruled absolutely, and for some, life was but a short, temporary gift.\n\nSelection: Autumn Leaves (Kosma/ Prevert)\n\nhttps://londonjazzcollector.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ernie-henry-last-chorus-autumn-leaves-rlp266-riverside-1956.mp3\n\n. . .\n\nArtists by track:\n\nBehind that illustrious list of names on the cover is not a bebop jazz super-group, but a complex piece of Bill Grauer jiggery pokery, sewing together tracks from various Riverside recording sessions left unfinished due to rising star Ernie Henry’s unanticipated departure. Grauer was never one to let a crisis go to waste. The line up of ’50s jazz alumni is worth a moment’s examination:\n\nCleo’s Chant (alternate version) :Kenny Dorham (trumpet) Ernie Henry (alto sax) Kenny Drew (piano) Wilbur Ware (bass) Art Taylor (drums) Reeves Sound Studios, NYC, August 30, 1956\n\nAutumn Leaves, Beauty And The Blues , All The Things You Are, Melba’s Tune: Lee Morgan (trumpet) Melba Liston (trombone ) Ernie Henry (alto sax) Benny Golson (tenor sax) Cecil Paine (baritone sax) Wynton Kelly (piano) Paul Chambers (bass) Philly Joe Jones (drums) Reeves Sound Studios, NYC, September 15, 1957\n\nBa-Lue Bolivar Ba-Lues-Are: Ernie Henry (alto sax) Sonny Rollins (tenor sax) Thelonious Monk (piano) Oscar Pettiford (bass) Max Roach (drums) Reeves Sound Studios, NYC, October 9, 1956\n\nLike Someone In Love (alternate take): Ernie Henry (alto sax) Wynton Kelly (piano) Wilbur Ware (bass) Philly Joe Jones (drums) Reeves Sound Studios, NYC, September 30, 1957\n\nS’posin’ (alternate take) : Kenny Dorham (trumpet, piano) Ernie Henry (alto sax) Eddie Mathias (bass) G.T. Hogan (drums) NYC, November 13, 1957\n\nArtist profile:\n\nBrooklyn-born altoist Ernie Henry started out in the late ’40s scene, earning places with Tad Dameron, Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra and Illinois Jacquet. After a few years in the shadows Henry emerged in 1956 to play alongside Sonny Rollins on Monk’s Brilliant Corners. Thanks to that exposure his musical career was given a big shot in the arm, leading three Riverside LP’s in 1957, a career cut short before the year was out by a heroin overdose, at the age of only 31.\n\nHenry’s discography is short but sweet, his Riverside debut “Presenting” and follow up “Seven Standards and The Blues” sessions contributed tracks to The Last Chorus, and part from an unfinished album with Kenny Dorham, “2 Horns/ 2 Rhythm” and part from an unfinished album featuring Lee Morgan, And that’s it, Henry was gone, life unfinished.\n\nMusic: Autumn Leaves.\n\nAccording to French pianist and jazz writer Philippe Baudoin, “Autumn Leaves” is the most important non-American jazz standard, recorded over 1400 times by mainstream and modern jazz musicians, making it the eighth most recorded tune in the jazz canon.\n\nThe piece was a favorite of Miles Davis, who apparently had an affair with Juliette Greco in Paris in 1949, the year she recorded the equivalent French lyric “Les feuilles mortes”, which Baudoin suggests could explain Davis’s attachment to the tune, trust a French writer to opt for the romantic explanation. Miles didn’t seem the romantic kind. A more likely reason is that it has an attractive melody, an unusual minor key chord progression and resolution through verse and chorus, and the chord structure is a perfect foil for improvisation. So much for romance.\n\nThe Dead Leaves , not as picturesque as Autumnal ones, but the composition had many fans, some in unlikely quarters:\n\n“As Bond neared the end of the corridor, he could hear a piano swinging a rather sad tune” wrote Ian Fleming in his 1956 novel Diamonds are Forever. “At the door of 350 he knew the music came from behind it. He recognised the tune. It was “Feuilles Mortes”“\n\nThe lyric and the tune behind it taps into certain primal themes, perhaps the loss of love, or the arrival of Autumn, the turning of the seasons, or it is just a beautiful tune, take your pick, the listener brings to it their own baggage.\n\nThe Cannonball Adderley/ Miles Davis version on BLP 1595 Something Else, recorded in 1958 for Blue Note, delivers it to perfection. Adderley’s alto soars light-fingered over that chordal landscape with ravishing beauty. Ernie Henry’s version here is a more up-tempo vocalese delivery of the song, showcasing his burnished bitter-sweet tone.\n\nErnie Henry had a distinctive voice which showed considerable, promise unrealised, and you can see parallels with another associate of Max Roach, trumpeter Booker Little, who’s untimely departure in 1961 at the age of 23 likewise left behind just a handful of titles. Tina Brooks (42) could be added on tenor, Scott La Faro (25) on bass, and Sonny Clark (31) on piano, to complete the line up of the Grim Reaper Sextet (vacancy – drums). All that was needed was a contract with Blue Note Records, and the course of modern jazz history could have been quite different. Instead, clean-living longevity, academic tenures and White House invites sedately ran their course, leaving the youngbloods to deliver promise unfulfilled.\n\nI was shocked to be reminded how soon many other of my favourite players joined the Grim Reaper Orchestra, in no particular order: Bobby Timmons (38) Clifford Brown (25) Doug Watkins (27) Eric Dolphy (36) Fats Navarro (26) Grant Green (43) John Coltrane (40) Lee Morgan (33) Paul Chambers (33) Tubby Hayes (38) Wynton Kelly (39) Oscar Pettiford (37) Cannonball Adderley (46) ….bad drugs, bad driving, bad health care, or just bad luck. It’s a reminder,go listen now, while anything lasts.\n\nVinyl: RLP 12-266 Riverside (1956)\n\nUS deep groove original pressing, pre-incorporation “Bill Grauer Productions” on regular 100mm labels, but Bill Grauer Productions Inc. on cover, 553 West 51st St address (Riverside Guide updated Feb. 21, 2018)\n\nResearch Craft Co. LA pressing (US and GB patents thick/thin rim groove guard stamp in the run out) On previous form, Riverside used Abbey Mfg.Co. for East Coast pressing, and Research Craft Co. for West Coast.\n\nThe patented rim drive was intended to protect record grooves from the operation of an auto-changer, a particularly unnecessary labour-saving device. Etching-ogglers may see a few things of interest, a letter S, a wave type stamp, and a “T 11” hand-etch, absolutely none of which mean anything to me.\n\nCollector’s Corner\n\nI chanced on this copy in an East London store notorious for over-pricing vintage albums imported from Canada, however the prices seem to suit the hipster local demographic, and the new mantra is “availability is king”. You don’t have to buy it, but at least it is there. I was just leaving the store after a purchase when I caught it unexpectedly in the corner of my eye mounted on the wall display top row, and immediately executed a double take.\n\nUm, is that the original Riverside I see up there? Ernie Henry, Last Chorus? You see the Japanese around a lot, and OJC, but I don’t think I have ever seen an original US copy in the flesh before, unusual.\n\nYes, a Riverside “original”, and in decent condition. As I expected, no bargain, fully priced, though not outrageously so. In the era of the Internet, the bargain has long since become a distant memory. Sentiment kicked in. It’s only money. I’ll take it. Sometimes it’s nice to have an original piece of history. Its price-history is respectable but not trophy territory.\n\nCollectors Alternative:\n\n’70s Japanese Victor pressing twenty years later, same track for comparison: Autumn Leaves: Victor Japan 1977 reissue\n\nhttps://londonjazzcollector.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ernie-henry-last-chorus-autumn-leaves-victor-jp-1977.mp3\n\nI quite like the Japanese, but it lacks the sense of jazz history attached to the original. Sometimes, Sentiment is King. You can’t reissue history. Here is a reminder of the “almost original”. I hear an immediacy, freshness, direct engagement, whilst the Japanese sounds more restrained, a little more distant and muffled. Until you put them side by side, you will never know.\n\nhttps://londonjazzcollector.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ernie-henry-last-chorus-autumn-leaves-rlp266-riverside-1956.mp3\n\nUp to you which you prefer. For some, provenance is all, original first… mine is maybe a year or two later, the cover advertising other titles give it away. I would love to pit it against a true first, but I can’t. But no hesitation both early pressings out-perform the Japanese. Your call.\n\nIncidentally, I do recommend “comparative listening”. It is worth listening to different editions of the same title, your own or a friend’s copy, it will open your ears to the differences between editions. They are real, but if you only ever hear one, you will never know.\n\n]]> I’m sure I’ve seen this cover before somewhere, it seems familiar…\n\nSelection 1: Brilliant Corners (London label, Decca Pressing) 320kbps MP3\n\nArtists: Ernie Henry (alto saxophone) Sonny Rollins (tenor saxophone) Thelonious Monk (piano) Oscar Pettiford (bass) Max Roach (drums) recorded Reeves Sound Studios, NYC, October 15, 1956\n\nhttps://londonjazzcollector.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/thelonious-monk-brilliant-corners-london.mp3\n\nBonus track – Selection 2: Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are (London label, Decca Pressing) 320 kbps MP3\n\nArtists: Ernie Henry (alto saxophone) Sonny Rollins (tenor saxophone) Thelonious Monk (piano) Oscar Pettiford (bass) Max Roach (drums) recorded Reeves Sound Studios, NYC, October 9, 1956\n\nhttps://londonjazzcollector.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/thelonious-monk-ba-lue-bolivar-ba-lues-are-london.mp3\n\nMusic:\n\nI’ll hand this one over to Guardian jazz critic John Fordham’s review, which is much more articulate than that what I would like have written, so I quote in full:\n\nBrilliant Corners, recorded for the Riverside label in 1956 with an A-list band including saxophonist Sonny Rollins and former Charlie Parker drummer Max Roach, was the most compositionally ambitious session in the former church pianist’s decade-long jazz career thus far. In a legendarily fractious session, the title track’s growling theme was so treacherous in its lurching phrasing and abrupt time changes that a band this good still spent 25 takes on it, and the final version was only possible by splicing two takes together. But Brilliant Corners was no calculated technical highwire act, but a piece of audaciously adventurous composing that has never lost its power to startle and seduce over the decades.\n\nFrom Monk’s opening stabbed chords (as if he were chipping rock) to the bone-shaking notes, guttural horn harmonies and sudden thematic gallops, Brilliant Corners is gripping – as are the composer’s jangling improvisations, and Rollins’s lazily unfolding and huge-toned tenor solo. The session’s full of captivating variety too – from the urban graininess of Hornin’ In to the relaxed groove of Let’s Cool One, the surreal mix of Monk’s chordal bluntness and the coyness of a glockenspiel on Pannonica to the bleary rootsiness of the wonderful blues Ba Lue Bolivar Ba Lues Are. Arriving just before the late-50s free-jazz upheavals of Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane and Cecil Taylor, this was music that showed just how powerfully song-form harmonies and the tempered scale could be wrenched into new shapes.\n\nI can only agree.\n\nVinyl: London LTZ-U 15097 UK release of Riverside RLP 226 pressing Decca, New Malden. The Best of British:\n\nAlternative cover. Better? No, I don’t think so. Why change a brilliant cover?? But the mastering and pressing…the mighty Decca, New Malden…\n\nCover Shoot Out!\n\nUS Riverside original cover (US cover much better. Case dismissed)\n\nPressing Shoot Out: Brilliant Corners (US Riverside NY pressing)\n\nVinyl: Riverside RLP 226 – New York pressing, Abbey Manufacturing NJ. ( pushed up gain by 20% to compensate for a very quiet recording)\n\nSelection: Brilliant Corners Riverside US pressing – 320kbps MP3\n\nhttps://londonjazzcollector.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/thelonious-monk-brilliant-cornersus-riverside.mp3\n\nUS “original” sounds better?\n\nNot on my system, long way short. The Decca flows effortlessly, is more musical, more pleasurable to follow Monk’s jack-rabbit assault on the keyboard, sit back and hear Rollins and Henry struggling on their 25th take of Monk’s fiendish composition. The Riverside is limp, trailing, dragging, entirely lacking in the fierce malevolent alto/tenor brass of Henry and Rollins.\n\nThe London/ Decca press takes this brilliant corner to a higher plane. Only my opinion of course. You may disagree.\n\nCollectors Corner\n\nFirst blogged the Riverside edition of Brilliant Corners nearly exactly two years ago, April 19, 2012. My, doesn’t time fly when you’re having fun. This UK edition turned up and I couldn’t resist the opportunity to put my “original is best” maxim to the test. As usual, a surprise was just around the corner.\n\nLocated in the south London suburb of New Malden, Decca’s first class engineering skills were honed on the recording and pressing of classical music, strengthened by the consumption of many cups of strong tea throughout the day, and the occasional sticky bun from the factory trolley.\n\nI imagine 1950’s suburban New Jersey to be an only slightly more exciting. No reason why Riverside engineering supported by many cups of strong coffee and the occasional Danish shouldn’t translate into a superior original pressing. But the theory is often confounded by the annoying contrary nature of the facts.\n\nPostscript: WordPress music player\n\nProgress! It’s about two years since I asked WordPress to fix its embedded music player but they have finally done it.. It is now a natty column-width player, in black, which displays the track length, progress bar, and elapsed /remaining time and volume control. That’s nice.\n\nPostscript\n\nI have a second US copy of Brilliant Corners, which is a Research Craft West Coast pressing. Labels here below, smaller size label, deep groove, no Inc. US/GB patent stamps\n\nLike the other copy, both are not first original, but later pressings. The West Coast Research Craft matrices above are straight -A and -B, whereas the NY Abbey Manufacturing pressing featured in the post has matrices -A-PR1 and -B2. Clearly somebody did something locally but they both look like they date from the same period somewhere in the late 50’s early ’60s before the “INC” was added to “BILL GRAUER PRODUCTIONS”\n\nThis is a reminder to me to do more homework on the Riverside label. The wheels are coming off my trolley fast.\n\nPostscript 2: Two different addresses on the liner notes, with earlier and later titles promoted.\n\nThe West Coast pressing (right) has an earlier set of liner notes with the 553 West address which refers to other early catalogue number Riverside releases existing at the time. The NY Abbey pressing cover has a 235 West address and a later set of liner notes which refer to later Riverside titles.\n\nGeek or what?\n\n]]> Black Lion Shoot Out\n\nOne chilly November day in 1971, Monk found himself in LJC’s home town, London, accompanied by another jazz-elder, Art Blakey, and Al McKibbon on bass, to record a session for Alan Bates’ Black Lion label. In the Chappell Studios he recorded many of the tunes he had spent much of his life playing, and it was to be one of his last recordings, the summation of a life’s musical work.\n\nFrom the same source tapes, two pressings that throw light on the different musical experience that results from different engineering decisions. First up the Mosiac, then the “original” 1973 Black Lion release (one of three (possibly two) Black Lion LPs from that session), recording engineer Richard Timperley. Michael Cuscuna chose Rudy Van Gelder as mastering engineer. Can RVG’s master touch breathe new life into the original recording? Was Van Gelder right to opt for a mono mix, or the original’s decision to stick the drums out on the right, and nowhere else to go in stereo? You decide. Interested in all opinions.\n\nBoth in glorious 320kbps MP3 recorded from “Big Sister”. The target track, Misterioso, one of Monk’s most delicious compositions, delicious , it should be said, like all the others, high in musical calories.\n\nSelection 1: Misterioso: Mosaic Complete Black Lion and Vogue Sessions\n\nhttps://londonjazzcollector.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thelonious-monk-misterioso-van-gelder-mosaic-320kbps.mp3\n\nArtists\n\nThelonious Monk (piano) Al McKibbon (bass) Art Blakey (drums) recorded at Chappell Studios, London, England, November 15, 1971\n\nMusic:\n\nMonk’s last studio recordings as leader, paired in this intriguing four LP set with one of his earliest sessions – not well served on vinyl, the Paris Swing (subsequently Vogue) session from 1954. This collection therefore neatly sweeps up the few recordings which fell outside his Blue Note, Riverside and Columbia legacy, contrasting the young devil Monk with the old devil Monk.\n\nVinyl: Mosaic MR4-112\n\nSurprise on opening the box – a Van Gelder re-master! The eponymous EMI Ron McMaster elbowed to one side by Cuscuna, to allow Van Gelder the opportunity to show how it’s done. In an unexpected artistic choice, RVG opts for a mono mix. No indication when this box set was produced but the excellent Mosaic booklet offers one possibility, with liner notes attributed to 1985. One can safely say this wasn’t one Rudy remastered for CD and transferred to vinyl like some of those Japanese modern Toshiba “RVG Remastered” pressings.\n\n2: Original release: Black Lion, 1973\n\nSelection 2: Misterioso – Black Lion (1973 release)\n\nhttps://londonjazzcollector.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thelonious-monk-misterioso-black-lion-1971-320kbps.mp3\n\nVinyl:\n\nPhilips UK pressing, stereo. That cover: only one man can get away with a black leather cap topped with a cherry cupcake and still look cool. But it just wouldn’t look right without the cigarette smoke trails drifting up photogenically in a photographically darkened studio. Oddly it actually captures the physical presence of Monk in a way that the more clinical black and white Mosiac cover doesn’t. Between the two of them they could each have done a better job.\n\nCollectors Corner\n\nThe Mosaic box set came via Ebay, only three bidders, shame on you, British jazz fans. Clearly not the subject of collector-lust in Japan, as no sign of Tokyo Jazz Collector who I am sure is haunting current European auctions of late. Interplanetary Postage can be a bit fierce with Mosiac box sets.\n\nI have had the Black Lion issue for some time, and I felt the audio quality was a bit of a let down whenever I played it. Couldn’t put my finger on why, but the Van Gelder remaster puts it back into a proper perspective. The Mosaic bonus addition of the 1954 Paris Sessions offers an interesting longitudinal perspective on the genius that was Monk.\n\nAll in all, a welcome addition to the burgeoning “M” shelf of the LJC Collection. Mingus, Monk, Mobley, Morgan, Mulligan, Murray … why “M”?\n\nSome people will no doubt prefer the original Black Lion presentation, especially if I voice a preference for the Mosaic. The internet is like that. Oi, LJC, I disagree. Fine with me.\n\n]]>"
