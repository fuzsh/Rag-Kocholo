        "text": "A legendary figure in the world of jazz is gone, but his memory in Essex County – especially his hometown of Newark – won't be forgotten.\n\nNEWARK, NJ — A legendary figure in the world of jazz has passed away, but his memory in Essex County – particularly his hometown of Newark – will not be forgotten.\n\nSaxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter died Thursday in Los Angeles at the age of 89. There was no immediate information on the cause, The New York Times reported.\n\nShorter was born in Newark and graduated from Newark Arts High School.\n\nThe New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC), which is located in Newark, mourned his death and recounted some of the reasons why he is such a revered musician in the jazz community.\n\n\"All of us at NJPAC mourn the passing of jazz legend, Newark native and arguably the best jazz saxophonist in history, Wayne Shorter,\" the nonprofit stated. \"The 12-time Grammy-winning performer and composer redefined the art form — both through his own performances, and his collaborations with Art Blakey, Miles Davis and others — and inspired so many of today’s jazz greats including Herbie Hancock and Christian McBride, with whom he played at the arts center during his last visit here, for our Wayne Shorter Weekend in 2017.\"\n\n\"His artistry will live on forever,\" NJPAC emphasized.\n\nJazz House Kids, which is based in Montclair and counts another jazz titan, Christian McBride, among its ranks, also mourned Shorter on social media. The nonprofit wrote:\n\n“Wayne Shorter – The world lost a titan of jazz today and the Jazz House mourns a friend, mentor and supporter. Tributes are pouring in from all over the world about this pioneering saxophonist and composer, but those of us at the Jazz House and our former students lucky enough to be with him at our 10th Anniversary Gala will never forget witnessing a master at work up close, and his kindness, inspiring the next generation of jazz musicians. Our deepest sympathies to his many friends, family and his wife Carolina.”\n\nJazz radio station WBGO , which worked with the City of Newark to rename Park Place as \"Wayne Shorter Way,\" offered some more details about his connections to the Brick City in an article mourning his passing.\n\nAccording to WBGO:\n\n\"Shorter was born on August 25, 1933 in Newark, N.J and raised in a working class background. His mother worked for a furrier and his father was a welder, but the latter encouraged his son (and brother Alan) to pursue their interests in the arts. Shorter went to Arts High School in Newark ostensibly to pursue the visual arts. He had won an art competition as a 12-year-old and was encouraged by one of his teachers to apply to the program. However, once there, the young man’s attention wavered. 'I walked to school,' Shorter told WBGO’s Nate Chinen, 'and often found myself walking past the school, going around the corner to where the Adams Theater was, to go see a movie and a stage play. I would skip some classes, but not the whole day: I went into the school building when I knew it was time for a certain class.' Eventually inspired by a teacher with the remarkable name of Achilles D’Amico, he got serious about playing music. It didn’t hurt that he had been exposed to great music around the house and in the neighborhood. The sounds of artists like Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie and Duke Ellington were in the air in Newark and many Northeastern cities.\"\n\nSend local news tips and correction requests to eric.kiefer@patch.com.
