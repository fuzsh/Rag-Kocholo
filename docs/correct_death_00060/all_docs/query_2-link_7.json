He is the second-most recorded jazz composer in history.[1][2]\n\nThelonious Sphere Monk was born on October 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, Edgecombe, North Carolina.[3] He was the son of Thelonious Monk and Barbara (Batts) Monk.\n\nIn 1920, Thelonious was living in Rocky Mount, Edgecombe, North Carolina, with his parents, sister, and maternal grandmother.[4]\n\nWhen Thelonious was about four years old, his family left North Carolina and moved to Manhattan.[5][6] In the 1925 New York state census, Thelonious was enumerated at 234 West 63rd Street in Manhattan, New York, New York. He was living with his parents, two siblings, Marion and Thomas, and Claude Smith, a boarder.[7][8] Around this time, Thelonious began taking piano lessons from a neighbor, Alberta Simmons.[1]\n\nIn 1930, Thelonious was living in Manhattan, New York City, New York. He was living with his mother, Barbara, and siblings, Marion and Thomas, and attending school. Claude Smith was lodging with the family. Thelonious's father was not listed in the home.[9]\n\nIn about 1933, Thelonious formed his first band.[1]\n\nIn 1935 and 1940, Theolonious Monk, single, was living at 243 West 63rd Street Manhattan, New York City, New York. Also living in the home was his mother Barbara and sister Marion.[10] On October 16, 1940, Thelonious registered for the World War II draft.[11]\n\nBetween 1940 and 1946, Thelonious was the house pianist at Minton's Playhouse in Manhattan, New York City, New York.[6] In 1944, he released his first commercial recordings. Between 1947 and 1952, he recorded his Monk Blue Note Sessions. Thelonious went on to have contracts with several other recording companies: Prestige Records (1952–1954), Riverside Records (1955–1961), and Columbia Records (1962–1970).[1]\n\nIn 1947, Thelonious married Frances Nellie Smith. They stayed married for the rest of his life. Together they would have two children, including the late Barbara E. Monk.[6]\n\nOn May 30, 1954, Thelonious traveled to Paris, Île-de-France, France.[12] There he met his friend and patron, the Baroness Pannonica \"Nica\" de Koenigswarter, who would remain an important part of his life until his passing. In both 1957 and 1958, he had residencies at the Five Spot Cafe in Manhattan's East Village. On February 28, 1964, he was featured on the cover of Time magazine.[1]\n\nThelonius Monk at the Village Gate\n\nThelonious's health declined during the 1970s and he became increasingly reclusive. From 1976 to 1982, he lived in the home of Nica de Koenigswarter in Weehawken, Hudson, New Jersey.[1] On February 5, 1982, he suffered a stroke. He died on February 17, 1982, in Englewood Hospital in Englewood, Bergen, New Jersey.[13] A memorial service was held on February 22, 1982, at St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, Manhattan, New York City, New York.[6] He was interred in Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum, Hartsdale, Westchester, New York.[14]\n\nIn 1993, Thelonious was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2006, he was given a Pulitzer Prize for \"a body of distinguished and innovative musical composition that has had a significant and enduring impact on the evolution of jazz.\" In 2009, he was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame.[1]\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 Wikipedia: Wikipedia contributors, \"Thelonious Monk,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thelonious_Monk&oldid=902604322 (accessed July 22, 2019).\n\n↑ 1982 Newspaper: \"Newspapers.com,\" database with images\n\n(Newspapers Clip: 142410858 : accessed 3 March 2024)\n\nciting The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Thu, Feb 18, 1982, page 60.\n\n↑ Birth: \"North Carolina, Center for Health Statistics, Vital Records Unit, County Birth Records, 1913-1922,\" database with images\n\n(FamilySearch Record: 8G93-SX6Z : accessed 3 March 2024)\n\nFamilySearch Image: 3Q9M-C3SB-99JC-R\n\nThelious Junior Monk born on 10 Oct 1917, son of Thelious Monk & Barbra Monk, in Edgecombe, North Carolina, United States\n\nciting Digital film/folder number: 008513976_004_M9M8-MK8; Image number: 419.\n\n↑ 1920 Census: \"United States Census, 1920,\" database with images\n\n(FamilySearch Record: MZ29-H4Z : accessed 3 March 2024)\n\nFamilySearch Image: 33SQ-GRF3-NZV\n\nThelious Monk, Jr (2), single son, in household of Thelious Monk (30) in Edgecombe, North Carolina, United States.
