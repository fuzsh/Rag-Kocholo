        "text": "In the Breakfast Club, there are many cognitive advancements that are conveyed. The biggest cognitive advancements that takes place throughout the film are abstract thought, hypothetical thought and multidimensional thought. The movie centers on the essay that the students need to write, “Who do you think you are.” This question requires the group of students to think about their experiences, formulate ideas, acknowledge their knowledge, awareness and reflect on their experiences. The film illustrates how the adolescents thinking changes from concrete thinking- judging their peers and their own lives, to abstract thinking- viewing similarities between the characters and understanding the differences in their lives while showing empathy.\n\nIn both Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart and Peter Weir’s Dead Poets Society, the nature of father and son relationships are dependant on communication, the level of compromise that each is willing to give, and how each respond to one another. In the novel, Things Fall Apart, the village of Umuofia is a place where men are no less than warriors, and must fight for their social status. In the movie, Dead Poets Society, Welton is a strict school that has set rules that shall be followed, and if disobeyed, the students will face consequences. Both of these communities have a specific way of life, but both sons attempt to challenge society, and live their own way. However, their fathers are believers of their respective rules, and are ashamed\n\nThe following poster was designed by Noah Van Belle to explore the deeper meaning, found in the film The Shawshank Redemption, in just a single and simplistic image. The primary image, which is a rock hammer, represents the motifs of friendship and hope that is displayed throughout the film. The rock hammer is the first item that Andy, the protagonist, obtains from Red, who is also an inmate. This exchange between Red and Andy is the spark of their strong friendship. This friendship proved to be beneficial to Andy not only because he was able to obtain the resources, that he needed for his escape, from Red but he also had a partner to keep him from going insane, in a brutal place such as Shawshank. Red also benefited tremendously from his friendship\n\nThe story, Freak The Mighty by Rodman Philbrick has two main characters in the story. One of the characters is Kevin Avery. Kevin lives with his mom named Gwen because Kevin’s dad had passed away. He has Morquio Syndrome which means he has a short life. Kevin always wants to make intelligent inventions that can help Maxwell and Kevin escape from danger. Kevin is a very small kid with physical disabilities. In fact, Kevin is an important character in Freak the Mighty because his cleverness allows him to overcome his physical disabilities.\n\nCount Basie, was born August 21, 1904 in Red Bank, New Jersey. He was a gifted pianist, bandleader, and composer. His mother was a pianist and his father was a mellophonist. His mother, not realizing that he would become an amazing pianist and bandleader, started off his journey by giving him his first piano lessons. Later on, William and his family moved to New York, where he was further influenced by James P. Johnson and Fats Waller. In New York, Waller taught Basie organ playing techniques. Further on in his life Count Basie had many top chart hits such as “One O’Clock Jump” and “Blue Skies” In the 1858 Grammy’s became the first African-American male represent of a Grammy Award. Throughout his career, he won many more. Not only was he a great composer and musician, but he was a good person who influenced many people's lives. This essay will outline the life of Count Basie and all of his\n\nComing of age is a popular theme in literature with many authors, directors, and musicians basing their work around it. They create works with the intent to examine our youth from different perspectives. Two great examples of this would be the film The Breakfast Club and novel The Perks of being a wallflower. Both show a realistic and relatable take on the lives of high schoolers, however I’d argue Breakfast Club better accomplishes this goal. The Breakfast Club takes each classic high school stereotype and grants the viewer some understanding as to who they really are beneath their label, compared to The perks of being a wallflower which performs poorly in trying to accurately portray high school life.\n\nTrack star Gail Devers once said, “Sometimes we fall, sometimes we stumble, but we can't stay down. We can’t allow life to beat us down. Everything happens for a reason, and it builds character in us, and it tells us what we are about and how strong we really are when we didn't think we could be that strong.” In the nonfiction book Unbroken, by Laura Hillenbrand, the determined Louis Zamperini showed that life could not beat him down, and never gave up, not even in the light of the impossible. Louie’s strong minded determination continues to be a factor in his survival until the very end.\n\nIn March of 1994 he was hospitalized in Rome for an overdose, determined as an attempt for suicide, but later he snuck out of a Los Angeles drug treatment center and returned to Seattle where he committed suicide (“Kurt Cobain”). For a long time, Kurt struggled with drugs, and some believe when the limelight got too heavy for him he turned to drugs and broke down because of it. When Kurt was younger he never got the attention or acceptance he needed, and as a result he did not know how to handle all the praise. Even after his death Cobain was still praised by being assigned into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 and being made into a documentary in 2015 (Hilburn). His talent had not disappear with him, but it seemed to be more recognized when he was gone. People still relished and respected his art after his death because it was the type of art that deserved to be made a tremendous deal about. Even after his death, fans still presented their love and loss, “his suicide note was recently printed on tank tops and t-shirts, allowing morbid fans to celebrate the star,” (Latson, 1). Cobain’s impact on this world was gigantic, and his death took a remarkable amount of time for people to recover from.
