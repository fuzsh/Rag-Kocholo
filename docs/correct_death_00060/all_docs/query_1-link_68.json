        "text": "On February 28th…\n\nin 1704, ELIAS NEAU, a Frenchman, opened SCHOOL FOR BLACKS in NEW YORK CITY.\n\nin 1708, one of the FIRST RECORDED SLAVE REVOLTS occurred in NEWTON, LONG ISLAND, NY. Seven White People were killed. Afterward, 2 Black male slaves and a Native American Man were hanged and a Black Woman was burned alive.\n\nin 1776, PHYLLIS WHEATLEY was INVITED TO PRESIDENT GEORGE WASHINGTON’S HEADQUARTERS in Cambridge, MA. Ms. Wheatley was asked to READ A POEM she had written in his honor.\n\nin 1778, RHODE ISLAND GENERAL ASSEMBLY in precedent-breaking act AUTHORIZED THE ENLISTMENT OF SLAVES. After being appointed Commander, Christopher Greene and his staff were sent back to Rhode Island to raise a black regiment to fill the ranks of the depleted 1st Rhode Island regiment. The General Assembly voted that “every able bodied Negro, Mulatto and Indian slave” could enlist for the duration of the war. Bounties and wages would be the same as they were for free men. Once enlisted and approved of by the officers of the regiment, the recruits would be free. At the time, there was a Black and Native American population of 3,331 in Rhode Island. The scheme, which compensated owners for the freedom of their slaves, produced less than 200 men. Seeing how expensive the plan was becoming, the Assembly cut off the recruiting of slaves on June 10, 1778.\n\nin 1854, the REPUBLICAN PARTY was ORGANIZED in RIPON, WI. About 50 SLAVERY OPPONENTS began the new political group.\n\nin 1859, ARKANSAS LEGISLATURE required FREE BLACKS to choose between EXILE AND ENSLAVEMENT.\n\nin 1871, SECOND ENFORCEMENT ACT gave federal officers and courts control of registration and voting in congressional elections.\n\nin 1879, the “EXODUS OF 1879,” Southern Blacks fled political and economic exploitation. Exodus continued for several years. BENJAMIN “PAP” SINGLETON, a former slave, was one of the major leaders of the Exodus movement.\n\nin 1894, ERNEST JUDSON WILSON, Negro League baseball player and manager, was BORN in REMINGTON, VIRGINIA. Wilson’s professional career spanned from 1922 to 1945 and he had a career batting average of .351, ranking among the top five hitters in the league. Wilson died June 24, 1963 and was posthumously inducted into the BASEBALL HALL OF FAME in 2006.\n\nin 1932, RICHARD SPIKES invented the AUTOMATIC GEAR SHIFT.\n\nin 1943, The play “PORGY AND BESS,” starring TODD DUNCAN and ANNE BROWN, OPENED ON BROADWAY.\n\nin 1945, CHARLES AARON “BUBBA” SMITH, retired football player and actor, was BORN in ORANGE, TEXAS. Smith played college football at Michigan State University where he was awarded ALL-AMERICA HONORS in1965 and 1966. In 1967, he was the Baltimore Colts’ number one pick in the NFL draft. This made Smith the FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN SELECTED AS A NUMBER ONE TO ACTUALLY PLAY IN A GAME.\n\nOver his nine season professional career, Smith was a 2-TIME PRO BOWL selection. In 1988, Smith was inducted into theCOLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME and in 2006 his number 95 JERSEY number was RETIRED BY MICHIGAN STATE. After retiring from football, Smith made a number of television and film appearances, including appearing in five of the six “Police Academy” movies.\n\nin 1948, SGT. CORNELIUS F.

He was inducted into the NAISMITH MEMORIAL BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME in 2008. Dantley currently serves as an assistant coach with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nin 1964, THELONIOUS SPHERE MONK was featured on the COVER of TIME MAGAZINE. The piece inside the magazine, called “The Loneliest Monk,” by writer Barry Farrell, gave Thelonious the credit he deserved for helping bring jazz out of the Swing era. “Monk presided at the birth of bop,” Farrell wrote of Monk’s legendary tenure as the resident piano player at Minton’s Playhouse in New York City in the 1940s. Farrell not only characterized the “iconoclastic musical path” that Monk followed through the 1950s, but also of alluded to Monk’s well-known “eccentricity,” which his loved ones knew to be a longstanding but unnamed mental illness.\n\nFor his part, Monk made light of the issue to Farrell, even joking about an incident in which he was briefly hospitalized after being found wandering alone and speaking incoherently: “I can’t be crazy,” he said, “’cause they had me in one of those places and they let me go.” Mr. Monk, an icon, legend and innovator continued performing and pursuing a truly unique direction in jazz until his death on February 17, 1982.\n\nin 1967, WILT CHAMBERLAIN sunk an NBA record 35TH CONSECUTIVE FIELD GOAL.\n\nin 1967, PLATOON SERGEANT MATTHEW LEONARD, Medal of Honor recipient, DIED IN ACTION.

On February 28, 1967, Leonard was serving as a platoon sergeant (P/Sgt.) near Suoi Da, South Vietnam when his platoon came under attack. Leonard’s citation describes his actions during the battle: “Although the platoon leader and several other key leaders were among the first wounded, P/Sgt. Leonard quickly rallied his men to throw back the initial enemy assaults.\n\nDuring the short pause that followed, he organized a defensive perimeter, redistributed ammunition, and inspired his comrades through his forceful leadership and words of encouragement. Noticing a wounded companion outside of the perimeter, he dragged the man to safety but was struck by a sniper’s bullet which shattered his left hand. Refusing medical attention and continuously exposing himself to the increasing fire as the enemy again assaulted the perimeter, P/Sgt. Leonard moved from position to position to direct the fire of his men against the well camouflaged foe. Under the cover of the main attack, the enemy moved a machine gun into a location where it could sweep the entire perimeter. P/Sgt. Leonard rose to his feet, charged the enemy gun and destroyed the hostile crew despite being hit several times by enemy fire. He moved to a tree, propped himself against it, and continued to engage the enemy until he succumbed to his many wounds. His fighting spirit, heroic leadership, and valiant acts inspired the remaining members of his platoon to hold back the enemy until assistance arrived.” President Lyndon Johnson posthumously presented Platoon Sergeant Matthew Leonard with the MEDAL OF HONOR on DECEMBER 19, 1968.\n\nin 1967, PFC JAMES ANDERSON, JR., the FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN UNITED STATES MARINE RECIPIENT OF THE MEDAL OF HONOR, DIED.

On February 28, 1967, he was mortally wounded when, according to his citation, “an enemy grenade landed in the midst of the Marines and rolled alongside Private First Class Anderson’s head. Unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his own personal safety, he reached out, grasped the grenade, pulled it to his chest and curled around it as it went off.\n\nAlthough several Marines receive shrapnel from the grenade, his body absorbed the major force of the explosion. In this singular heroic act, Private First Class Anderson saved his comrades from serious injury and possible death.” Anderson was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, America’s highest military decoration, on August 21, 1968.\n\nin 1968, JUANITA HALL, musical theater and film actress, DIED.
