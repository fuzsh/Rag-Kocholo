I was playing piano with the best band in Pittsburgh – 18 pieces – and the best gig, too.

If the musicians didn’t want us to sit in, he’d run them off the stage, sit down, and play with me. At that time jobs were so few, and musicians had cliques. Times were tight, things were changing, but Monk was just outstanding in himself. He’s a great person.” – Art Blakey, quoted by John Litweiler in Down Beat, March 25, 1976, p.15.\n\nKelly’s Stables, NYC (Fall until November 1942) Mary Lou Williams gig [Allen]\n\n[This group included: Marion Hazel-t; Norris Turney-as; Musa Kaleem (Orlando Wright)-ts; Mary Lou Williams-p; Edgar Willis-b – Jazz Hot 1/59]\n\n“Art Blakey, one of the original members of the Jimmy Murray orchestra before Henderson took it over, had been with Mary Lou Williams at Kelly’s Stables in New York, into November 1942 at least.” – Walter Allen, Hendersonia.\n\n“[Mary Lou] Williams (whose time was impeccable) said they felt that Blakey just didn’t have his rhythm down so she planted him right between she and [Shorty] Baker until he got it!

I met Ben Webster, Don Byas there. We played in and out of Kansas City for about a year. Then the drummer from the Fletcher Henderson band came down and said, ‘I like the way you play, we’d like to have you in the band.’ This was Art Blakey. He invited Harold Clark, the tenor player, and myself to come down and play. Harold and I would say, ‘Well, yeah, maybe it would be a chance for us to go to New York.’ And Blakey, being like a quick talker, said, ‘Yeah, I’m doing managing for the band and I can get you in the band.’ So we went down to hear this concert they played in this concert house there (Kansas City). So Harold Clark said, ‘Man, that’s the saddest drummer in the whole world.’ Art Blakey was a terrible drummer at that time, he didn’t have no technique, he’d lose time (laughter), we had never heard him. We said, ‘No, man, not with that drummer, ’cause he’s terrible.’ So we forgot that.” – Idrees Sulieman, Cadence, September 1979, p.4.\n\n“Oh, Idrees is crazy. That’s the only reason I had the job, the only reason I had the job. I don’t think he heard me that much. What I was playing was kind of different from the drummer that his band was using, maybe he just couldn’t understand it.

Clearly this could not have been anywhere near a year.]\n\nSpring 1944: Marion Hazel-trumpet; Lucius Allen-sax; Walter Harris-tb;\n\nKen Club, Boston, MA (Spring 1944) Blakey small band [Allen]\n\n“He was leading his own band in Boston in 1944, when a call came from Billy Eckstine that led to what Blakey calls the greatest musical experience of his life, three years with Eckstine’s big band.” – Zan Stewart, Down Beat, July 1985, p.22.\n\n“I lived in Boston during the war. Yeah, I had a band there. I had a big band up there. I got there and had a band, you know. Because there was nothing to do and there was a lot of musicians around there and they don’t know, they don’t know how to talk to people. Musicians are not good businessmen and I know – I’m not a good businessman either, but I can bullshit. I know how to talk and get something done. To get things organized, get it going. So that’s what happened and I stayed there, and that’s where I met Roy Haynes. And that’s the world’s most underrated drummer, that man. I met him, and Al Dawson, these kids, you know. And that’s what happened up there. And I joined B from there, and we went on the road from there.” – Art Blakey, Jazz Magazine, Winter 1979, pp.49-50.”So I went up to Boston. Then Art Blakey was in town, but everybody in Boston said, “Man, don’t let this cat sit in ’cause the tempo will start off (fast) and after you play a while it would (be slow). He was the only drummer I knew used to lose time. So anytime he would come in, cats would turn their heads a different way. So one day we were standing on the corner of Massachusetts and Columbus Avenues in Boston and Art came up and said, “Hey man, I got a chance to go with the Billy Eckstine band.” We said, “What!!?” We said, “How’s he going to take that job?” They say the first time was so terrible that Dizzy Gillespie said, “Look man, drummer downstairs gonna show you how to play drums,” and Dizzy took him down and showed him how to drop the bomb and what to do and they say from that night on he’s been like he is now. Dizzy Gillespie taught him how to play drums.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it man, the band came through and I have never been so shocked in my life. He had the audience, he had the band, and I couldn’t believe he was the same drummer. Dizzy knew how to explain things so you learn it in one time. If Billy had asked me then to join the band I would have immediately because of Art Blakey, and when he was with Fletcher Henderson I wouldn’t take the job because he was so bad.” – Idrees Sulieman, Cadence, September 1979, p.6.\n\nBilly Eckstine\n\n“But when I was in Boston, Billy (Eckstine) sent for me and I took my trombone player (Marion Hazel) and trumpeter (Walter Harris) and he hired both of them. Billy heard about me from musicians in the band.” – Art Blakey, Cadence, July 1981, p.10. [The two names have been reversed. Hazel played trumpet and Harris played trombone.]\n\nNYC (April 13, 1944) Billy Eckstine session (DeLuxe) [can Blakey be on this early date?]\n\n[Allen says Blakey joined Eckstine in St. Louis, MO in mid 1944.]\n\nRiviera Club, St. Louis, MO (2 weeks c.

Kind of like to make up for that now.'” – Art Blakey, quoted by John Tynan in Down Beat, October 17, 1957, p.15.\n\n“I didn’t go to Africa to study drums – somebody wrote that – I went to Africa because there wasn’t anything else for me to do. I couldn’t get any gigs, and I had to work my way over on a boat. I went over there to study religion and philosophy. I didn’t bother with the drums, I wasn’t after that. I went over there to see what I could do about religion. When I was growing up I had no choice, I was just thrown into a church and told this is what I was going to be. I didn’t want to be their Christian. I didn’t like it. You could study politics in this country, but I didn’t have access to the religions of the world. That’s why I went to Africa. When I got back people got the idea I went there to learn about music.” – Art Blakey, quoted by Herb Nolan in Down Beat, November 1979, p.20.\n\n“In 1947, after the Eckstine band broke up, we — took a trip to Africa. I was supposed to stay there three months and I stayed two years because I wanted to live among the people and find out just how they lived and — about the drums especially. We were in the interior of Nigeria and I met some people called the Ishan people who are very, very interesting people. They live sort of primitive. The drum is the most important instrument there: anything that happens that day that is good, they play about it that night. This particular thing caught my ear of the different rhythms. The first movement is about a hunter who had went out — there was three of them. They were after one girl. She was a very pretty girl. They wanted her. And this particular one, he went out — the guys would tease him a lot because he was the shortest one in the — tribe. And he went out and he was the best hunter, so he ended up with the girl. And this time they started playing the drums and expressing to her that he had caught the most game and to prepare for the feast that night. And the second movement is a movement where there’s a little girl, she wanted to go out and play, and her mother didn’t want her to go out and play and it was an argument going on between the two and so the drummers would play. And the little brother comes up and he persuades the mother to let her go out. So that’s a big deed that day for the little boy who persuaded his mother, so they played about it. And the last part of it, I have a little bit of — American movements in there, the last bit of it is about the first time they had seen an automobile that day. And that’s the reason I put in some American movements on the drums. And — they played about it that day.” – Art Blakey, transcription of “Art Blakey’s Comments On ‘Ritual'” from the 1957 Pacific Jazz album Ritual.\n\n1947: Seventeen Messengers big band: Ray Copeland-t; Sahib Shihab (Edmund Gregory)-as; [unknown Brooklyn guy]-ts; Cecil Payne-bar; Haleen Rasheed (Howard Bowe)-tb; Thelonious Monk-p; Gary Mapp-b [from Gene Lees Interview of Sahib Shihab, Jazzletter, May 1985] [Both the instrumentation and personnel, however, sound like it would be the nine-piece group (with added congas) from around 1951.

But Art said, ‘Well, if I’m not the leader I’m not going to play’ (laughter). It was a 17-piece band, Dizzy gave us a whole repertoire from his band, his whole book. And were copying like for weeks at night ten or fifteen of his best arrangements. We rehearsed for a whole month from nine in the morning to like six (PM). We made our appearance at Smalls’ Paradise. Dizzy came up and sat in, said, “This is the band I should have had.” – Idrees Sulieman, Cadence, September 1979, p.6.\n\n“The Jazz Messengers really started in 1949, but then it was called the 17 Messengers. The cats that put the band together came to me and told me I was going to be the leader. Being a musician has nothing to do with being a leader; I was a good organizer. That’s always been my talent. The 17 Messengers was a good band; there were a lot of great players in it like Sonny Rollins and Bud Powell. We were just playing around New York – making a few gigs – but economically the band was a disaster, so we had to break it up.” – Art Blakey, quoted by Herb Nolan in Down Beat, November 1979, p.21.\n\n“We had the 17 Messengers and most of the guys were Muslims, this was between ’47 and ’50. Guys started rehearsing, and the guy doing most of the writing was Kenny Dorham. But at that time big bands were going out, not coming in. It was a financial disaster. I was leading the band and I couldn’t carry the weight like that. I had four children and a wife and I couldn’t be bothered with that – so the band broke up.” – Art Blakey, Cadence, July 1981, pp.10-11.\n\n“The Jazz Messengers was originally formed as a 17 piece big band in 1947, however it was not until 1953 that the more popular quintet and sextet editions were formed, with Art Blakey and Horace Silver as co-leaders.” – James Williams, Down Beat, November 1979, p.89.\n\n– NYC (1947) Ida James session (Manor)\n\nLincoln Square Ballroom, NYC (latter 1947) All Star concert [Miles p.105]\n\n– WOR Studios, NYC (October 15, 1947) Thelonious Monk Sextet session (Blue Note)\n\n– WOR Studios, NYC (October 24, 1947) Thelonious Monk Trio session (Blue Note)\n\n– WOR Studios, NYC (November 21, 1947) Thelonious Monk Quintet session (Blue Note)\n\n– NYC (December 5, 1947) Fats Navarro session (Savoy)\n\n– NYC (December 11, 1947) Dexter Gordon session (Savoy)\n\nDecember 22, 1947: Abdul Hamid (Kenny Dorham)-t; Sahib Shihab (Edmund Gregory)-as; Musa Kaleem (Orlando Wright)-ts; Ernie Thompson-bar; Haleen Rasheed (Howard Bowe)-tb; Ibrahim Ibn Ismail (Walter Bishop, Jr.)-p; Laverne Barker-b\n\n– WOR Studios, NYC (December 22, 1947) New Sounds (Blue Note)\n\n1948\n\nJanuary 25, 1948: Bennie Harris-t; Thelonious Monk-p [others unknown]\n\n– Club 845, NYC (January 25, 1948) [unrecorded] [NY Amsterdam News 1/24/48]\n\n“Art Blakely [sic] and his Messengers were advertised as part of ‘Ray Pino Proudly Presents Variation in Modern Music, Sunday, Jan. 25, 1948 3 to 9 PM at Club “845” 160th St. and Prospect Ave., Bronx, NY.'” – NY Amsterdam News, January 24, 1948.\n\nFebruary 16, 1948: Idrees Sulieman-t; Thelonious Monk-p; Curley Russell-b\n\n– Festival of American Music WNYC Broadcast (Chazzer 2002)\n\nc.

Like, you know, playing around Harlem and in the Bronx and all over Manhattan for different dance functions, you know, club affairs and things like that. And anyway, Bo McCain was working with that band. They weren’t working very regular, but he was working with them. But he also played this weekend job out in Carteret, New Jersey, that I worked on. And Art’s piano player at that time was goofin’ off and wasn’t making the rehearsals, or wasn’t showing up sometime for the gigs, something where he’d be late or something, and they wanted a new piano player. So Bo recommended me and he brought me to a rehearsal one day, and I, you know, sat down, and I was able to read the music okay. I read music pretty good and they hired me, you know, for the gig. That’s how I got that gig, that’s how I first met Art Blakey and started working with him, with that nine-piece band. And, as I said before, that didn’t last very long because we could only get maybe one night a week at a dance gig or something, you know.” – Horace Silver, Talking Jazz: An Oral History, November 1985.\n\nNYC (July 20, 1951) Gladys Bruce session (Coral)\n\nS.S.

This guy had a stocking cap on, suspenders, and blowing his horn, warming up. He sounds beautiful. So Ike Quebec was with me at the time. He said, ‘Man, why don’t you tell me you’re getting a farmer to play trumpet.’ (laughter) I say, ‘Well, I don’t know, Bird tells me…’ He said, ‘Man, Jesus Christ, man, plus he ain’t nothin’ but a kid.’ And he (Clifford Brown) had a very high voice and was very sweet. So I said, ‘Well, come on, we’re going to hit.’ He (Brown) came out and played the first chorus of it and after he played the first chorus, Ike turned around and cussed me out, ‘Dirty so-and-so, how come you didn’t tell me the kid could play like that?’ (laughter) That’s what happened.

I told Bird I’m going to Philadelphia, and I’ve got to have a trumpet player. He said ‘I got a trumpet player for you, you go to the gig and he’ll be there.

I used to call him ‘The Connecticut Yankee.’ We met at Birdland when he was with Stan Getz. I had broken up the 17 Messengers and when we formed the group with Horace, Hank Mobley, and Kenny Dorham, he said let’s call it the Jazz Messengers. It started out as a corporation. That didn’t work out too good. So we just went on with it. We just carried on and tried to get other musicians to play jazz and build names and get them out there because we need more groups out there to hold the joints open, the jazz joints throughout the United States.

As a result of earlier successes on the Blue Note label, Horace’s star was in the ascendancy and Alfred Lion was anxious to record more of his brilliant hard driving piano. It was decided that this date would present Horace as a combo leader for the first time. He responded by getting Kenny Dorham and Art Blakey to join himself and two of the members of his Minton’s quartet, Hank Mobley and Doug Watkins. Thus the Messengers were born, or reborn.” – Ira Gitler, notes to Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers.\n\n– “After leaving Gillespie in September 1954, Mobley joined pianist Horace Silver’s quartet at Minton’s Playhouse, a group completed by bassist Doug Watkins and drummer Arthur Edgehill. ‘On weekends Art Blakey and Kenny Dorham would come to jam, ’cause they were right around the corner,’ Mobley recalled to Litweiler.” – Bob Blumenthal, notes to Mosaic Hank Mobley set.\n\n“So Horace Silver got Hank Mobley and Kenny Dorham and Doug Watkins and myself and said, ‘Art, you should be the leader since you have more experience than the rest of the guys and we’d like to have you up here with us.’ And I said, ‘Well, what should we call the band?’ He said, ‘We can’t call it 17 Messengers, so we’ll call it Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.’ And that’s the way the band started and this is what Horace named it and it’s stuck ever since. We didn’t expect the band to go world wide and make a lot of money, we were just trying to make some gigs and play, because we were tired of goin’ on gigs and jamming with a pick-up band, play the same old tunes. People got tired of that shit and I could see they were getting tired and I don’t like chaos anyhow. I like freedom, but without discipline, it’s chaos. So we wrote arrangements, got sharp – got some suits, started paying attention to the audience and put it together.” – Art Blakey, Cadence, July 1981, p.11.\n\nNovember 13, 1954: Kenny Dorham-t; Hank Mobley-ts; Horace Silver-p; Doug Watkins-b\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (November 13, 1954) Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers (Blue Note 1518)\n\n1955\n\n– Fine Recording Studio, NYC (January 3, 1955) Clark Terry session (EmArcy)\n\n– Fine Recording Studio, NYC (January 4, 1955) Clark Terry session (EmArcy)\n\n– Fine Recording Studio, NYC (January 11, 1955) Bud Powell Trio session (Verve)\n\n– Fine Recording Studio, NYC (January 12, 1955) Bud Powell Trio session (Verve)\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (January 25, 1955) Randy Weston Trio session (Riverside)\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (January 30, 1955) Kenny Dorham Sextet session (Blue Note)\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (February 6, 1955) Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers (Blue Note 1518)\n\n– NYC (February 25, 1955) Quincy Jones session (Columbia)\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (March 20, 1955) Julius Watkins Sextet session (Blue Note)\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (March 27, 1955) Hank Mobley Quartet session (Blue Note)\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (March 29, 1955) Kenny Dorham Octet session (Blue Note)\n\n– Carnegie Hall, NYC (April 2, 1955 – actually midnight April 3, 1955) Charlie Parker memorial concert [Reisner: Bird p.237]\n\n– Open Door Café, NYC (April 1955) [from photo caption – no source]\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (May 6, 1955) Herbie Nichols Trio session (Blue Note)\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (May 13, 1955) Herbie Nichols Trio session (Blue Note)\n\n– Syria Mosque, Pittsburgh, PA (1955) [db Music ’70 p.33]\n\n– Rouge Lounge, Detroit, MI (July 1955) [db 9/7/55 p.12] [“appearing here for the first time in 12 years” – looks like 11 years, though]\n\n– Baltimore, MD (Summer 1955) [db 9/7/55 p.12]\n\n– Washington, DC (Summer 1955) [db 9/7/55 p.12]\n\n– Cleveland, OH (Summer 1955) [db 9/7/55 p.12]\n\n– Chicago, IL (Summer 1955) [db 9/7/55 p.12]\n\n– Las Vegas, NV (Summer 1955) [db 9/7/55 p.12]\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (October 10, 1955) Duke Jordan Trio session (Signal)\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (October 15, 1955) Gigi Gryce Quartet session (Signal)\n\n– Jazz for Israel benefit concert, Carnegie Hall, NYC (October 15, 1955) [unrecorded] [Vail, Porter: John Coltrane, p.353]\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (October 22, 1955) Gigi Gryce Orchestra session (Signal)\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (November 20, 1955) Duke Jordan Quintet session (Signal)\n\n– Café Bohemia, NYC (November 23, 1955) At the Café Bohemia vol. 1 (Blue Note 1507); At the Café Bohemia vol. 2 (Blue Note 1508)\n\n– Cambridge, MA (December 2, 1955) Donald Byrd session (Transition)\n\n[In his Encyclopedia of Jazz questionnaire, Donald Byrd indicates he joined the band in December 1955 after working with George Wallington from August to October of that year.]\n\n“My second encounter with him [Horace Silver] was just before I joined the Messengers.

I recorded with him, because Art was under contract elsewhere, so I wound up making “Señor Blues” and “Virgo” and all those things, in 1956.” – Donald Byrd, Radio Free Jazz, March 1977, p.13\n\n– NYC, The Tonight Show TV (December 1955) Bud Powell Trio (Royal Jazz)\n\nMarch 6, 1956: Donald Byrd-t; Hank Mobley-ts; Horace Silver-p; Doug Watkins-b\n\n– NYC, The Tonight Show TV (March 6, 1956) (private recording) [-TN, DM] [date could be March 15, 1956]\n\n– Audio-Video Studios, NYC (March 12, 1956) Kenny Burrell session (Blue Note) [Is Blakey or Shadow Wilson on this?]\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (March 17, 1956) Thelonious Monk Trio session (Riverside)\n\n– Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (April 3, 1956) Thelonious Monk Trio session (Riverside)\n\n– NYC (April 6, 1956) The Jazz Messengers (CBS 897)\n\n– Red Hill Inn, Pennsauken, NJ (“recent weekend date”) [Metronome 6/56 p.17]\n\n– Washington, DC (Spring 1956) [photo in RFJ 3/77 p.22]\n\n– NYC (May 3, 1956) The Cool Voice of Rita Reys (Philips 8006)\n\n– NYC (May 4, 1956) The Jazz Messengers (CBS 897); Originally (CBS 38036)\n\n– [lasted until May 1956.

So he started writing and his writing was good. He kept it up and he was going. He was very quiet and very nice to me. One night on TV – I don’t know where he was – he said, ‘I really thank God for Art Blakey because he really got on me and helped me to go on and start writing.’ And that made me feel so good. I’ve never forgotten it. And we’ve been tight ever since. We’ve been very good friends. His music is beautiful. He learned how to voice very well. He learned how to utilize two horns to the fullest extent. That’s one thing I learned from him. Instead of hearing a whole lot of horns he’d take two horns and get just as much out of two as you can get out of three in most cases. He would utilize every thing. He just turned out to be a hell of an arranger. The more he did it, the better he got. He has some very, very beautiful things like “Nica’s Dream.” I had a ball playing with him in the rhythm section. We seem to fit together. When he got his own groups he wanted all his drummers to play in the same style as I was trying to play. We always got along musically as well as spiritually and otherwise.” – Art Blakey, Radio Free Jazz, March 1977, pp.17-18.\n\n“It first started out being a cooperative thing, but it didn’t work because it wasn’t equal.

He was the first white musician to work with the group. This was the edition of the Messengers that included Donald Byrd, Wilbur Ware, and Kenny Drew. But Ira wasn’t happy just playing tenor; he wanted to play trumpet. He says he feels his taking the Blakey job on tenor was ‘the biggest mistake of my life.’ He explains, ‘I was still under Sonny Stitt’s influence at the time. I couldn’t pick up my tenor without thinking of him. I had little originality, and I didn’t want to be exposed to the public as a tenor man. I wanted to play my trumpet.’ ‘I don’t think Art ever thought of me as a trumpet player,’ he continued. ‘Nobody did except Bird.’ After a month and a half, Ira and the Jazz Messengers parted company. He stayed around New York and recorded with J.R.
