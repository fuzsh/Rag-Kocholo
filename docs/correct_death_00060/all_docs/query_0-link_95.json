        "text": "Hackensack native Rudy Van Gelder, perhaps the most influential recording engineer in the jazz genre, who brought to vivid life the sounds of such legendary artists as Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock and Freddie Hubbard, died Thursday morning at his longtime home and studio in Englewood Cliffs. He was 91.\n\nHe had not been ill and died unexpectedly, said his longtime assistant, Maureen Sickler, who added that Van Gelder was still working as an engineer and pursuing his hobby of nature photography.\n\n“In many ways, Rudy Van Gelder was as important as the musicians themselves, because of the way he presented their music,” said Vincent Pelote, director of operations of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University-Newark.\n\nNoting Van Gelder’s close association with Blue Note Records, Pelote said, “There was a warmth to the sound of those Blue Note recordings that only he was able to produce. Part of it was the way he miked the pianos. It was the Rudy Van Gelder sound, and it’s hard to put into words. But I know it when I hear it.”\n\nIn 2006, Concord Music Group began issuing remasters of Van Gelder’s work and in 2014 a 20-CD box set called “RVG Remasters” was released to mark his 90th birthday. Among the musicians on the remasters were Coltrane, Eddie “Lockjaw” Davis and Etta Jones.\n\nThe jazz tuba player Howard Johnson said that he first recorded with Van Gelder in 1966 and that they most recently worked together about five years ago.\n\n“He was very, very meticulous,” said Johnson, who lives in Harlem. “He was very protective of his equipment because it was all custom made.”\n\nJohnson said that Van Gelder wore white gloves when he was recording and that if a musician happened to lean on the equipment, Van Gelder would reprimand him and immediately clean the spot.\n\n“He was that way about his product, too,” Johnson said. “His records are very well recorded. You can recognize his touch.”\n\nVan Gelder, whose father and uncle both played the trumpet, incubated his fame in his hometown of Hackensack. Young Rudy played the trumpet, too, but he also experimented with ham radios, which stoked an interest in recorded sound. Setting up a monaural tape recorder in the living room of the family home on Prospect Street, he invited his musician friends over to jam.\n\nVan Gelder attended optometry school in Philadelphia after graduation from Hackensack High School and practiced for a time on Cedar Lane in Teaneck, while keeping music recording as a hobby. But the demand for his services grew, and with a $2,000 loan from his parents he built a control room off the family living room. Blue Note Records founder Alfred Lion made the pilgrimage to Hackensack and invited Van Gelder to record his artists.\n\n“The whole thing has been serendipity,” Van Gelder said in a 1989 interview with The Record. “There was no recording industry, really, when I started in all this, and so as I pursued recording as a hobby, I became that kid from New Jersey whom jazz musicians would come to see. The fact that after a while people started paying me for this was a surprise, although I’m happy about that now.”\n\nHe moved his studio to a cathedral-like space in Englewood Cliffs in 1959, several years after his original Hackensack studio was immortalized by Thelonious Monk in the instrumental “Hackensack.”\n\n“I was there in ’66 for the first time,” Johnson said of the studio that was often referred to as “the House that Coltrane Built.” “But what struck me was that the roof from the outside and the inside was four equilateral triangles. I don’t know exactly what that did to the echo or the sound of the room but it sure was what we all liked.\n\n“It was a special occasion to play there.”\n\nVan Gelder, who recorded thousands of jazz albums for Blue Note and other labels, was honored by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences with a Trustees Award Grammy. But he blanched from the praise he received, and in 2005 told The New York Times that the musicians deserved the credit for the sounds he recorded. “I’m an engineer, not a producer,” he said. “My goal is to make the musicians sound the way they want to be heard.”\n\nSickler, his assistant since 1988, said the secret to Van Gelder’s genius was that “all his senses were acute hearing, sight, taste, touch. … He could easily tell if something was wrong.”\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending."
