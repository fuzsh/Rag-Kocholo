        "text": "Perhaps the most famous recording facility in all of jazz, Rudy Van Gelder’s studio, first in Hackensack, then in Englewood Cliffs, is the birthplace of seminal albums by the likes of Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins and hundreds of others.\n\nThe newest gem to emanate from these hallowed halls is the self-titled debut of The Heavy Hitters. Pianists Mike LeDonne/Eric Alexander, trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, alto saxophonist Vincent Herring, bassist Peter Washington, drummer Kevin Washington and guest guitarist Rale Micoc (on the brilliant 7:58 adventure called “Chainsaw”) live up to their band name as they spiral into the stratosphere on their own trips while remaining perfectly in sync with each other.\n\nNo small feat.\n\nIn approximating the classic Blue Note Records playbook, these nine originals—ranging in times from 5:26 to 8:19—span the gamut of post-bop. Using bebop as but a base, they lunge through atmospheric flights of tight ensemble playing and fluid soloing to create one of the year’s best jazz albums."
