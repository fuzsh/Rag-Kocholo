        "text": "Thelonious Monk\n\nThelonious Sphere Monk (October 10, 1917 - February 17, 1982) was a jazz pianist and composer. He is known for his unique improvisational style and many contributions to the standard jazz repertoire, including his classicwork 'Round Midnight. Monk is often regarded as a founder of bebop although his playing style evolved away from the form."
