        "text": "As a rule his productivity is not merely focused on playing his dear guitars, but to keep things interesting to others as to himself, he also indulges himself in composing, arranging and producing (or whatever publishing, running a record label or creating a serious bit of graphical designs through cd-cover production is being called these days).\n\nÂ Born in Holland, Rens Newland started his musical carreer playing in several cross-over bands. Especially Scope was pioneering and successful (eventually it even made it into the Billboard Jazz Charts) ...\n\n2022\n\nBesides playing interesting theatre music (\"3 Groschen Opera\" & \"Jeder stirbt fuer sich allein\") in the Vienna Kammerspielen and Theater in der Josefstadt, in this year I recorded several solopieces and solo productions on which I played or programmed all the instruments.Â\n\nÂ End of the year I decided to put these and my other \"singles\" on a review album \"Singles, Grooves & Memories\"! From 1974 to 2022! That was real fun!Â\n\nÂ With Maya Hakvoort'sÂ Â Voices of Musical\" with me as MD (musical director) we did several regular shows and Christmas shows.Â\n\nÂ Ostinato still is active as well!Â\n\n2021\n\nI tried to use the Corona times as good as possible, so I started the Blues project \"Fuse Bluezz\" with my friend and bass player Peter Gruber. As my roots were in the 1960s Blues, the Electric Blues of John Mayall, Eric Clapton and their alikes in Holland, like Cuby and the Blizzards. and I always tried to keep this deep music feeling in all the projects and styles I did in the meantime, it was no big jump to get back into it.Finding the right singer is not easy, but we did it: Ric Toldon is a cool american guy (is also percussionist) living in Vienna, who even met Jimi Hendrix and was around when the Stones played in the USA. As drummer the young Simon Springer was our first choice, as well as my main keyboard man Martin WÃ¶ss for the piano and Synth additions. We easily did some recording sessions in my Orange House Studios, and I am very happy with the result! We succeeded to get a real bandsound and my guitars sound fresh and saucy! Hoping to do concerts and festivals soon. The album is called\"Blues Indeed\" ,Â Â a concept album, a reflection of the strange and negative atmosphere in the lockdowns, of course with an eyewink, like always in Blues!Â\n\nThe new album of Andi Steirer (the great Ostinato percussionist) is also done and out:\"Trance of Noiz\" ! It is gonna be presented at Porgy & Bess Vienna in dec 2021 - at the yearly Ostinato concert!\n\nThe tracks for the coming up Willi Langer album are done, the mix is going on, so soon it will be finished.\n\nVery exciting: The 2 albums from 1974 and 1975 of my first professional group, the legendary SCOPE (Holland), are now re-released on CDs in Germany and were sold quite good till now!\n\nAgain it will be a \"Bizzy Man's Year\"!!\n\nYou find on the JUST2STRANGERS SITE! album title \"RAGGAJAZZ\".

Rens and his Newland Band did some touring with The Supremes (France, Germany, Austria).\n\n1997-98\n\nThe brand new vibra- phone player of Enfant Terrible - Flip Phillip - turned out to be a congenial musical partner and with him Rens started 1997 the intellectual groove-jazz project Ya- cazu, a challenging band with various vocal soloists, like Cedric or Jacqueline Patricio. As a result of this interesting collaboration a cd was presented in the beginning of 1998.\n\nHe also produced the new Gina Charito come-back album called Wanna make love to you. Besides that a collaboration with Gloria Gaynor started. With the Newland Band he did several international concerts (Switserland, Germany).\n\n1996Â\n\nIn 1996 Rens presented the solo album (about) sexy Jazz with some of his musical friends like Joris Dudli and Herwig Gradischnig. Two other projects followed in '97: his first acoustic solo guitar album and the special septet Brassbabies & Rhythmkids, live and on CD, with Werner Feldgrill, Christian Maurer, Gerald Preinfalk and others.\n\n1993Â\n\nIn 1993, he and Bumi Fian started the Enfant Terrible project with Thomas Lang, Willi Langer and Woody Scha- bata.

The band did a lot of club and festival touring in Austria, Germany and Switzerland.\n\n1977-1980Â\n\nIn 1977 he moved to Vienna (Austria), to play with the Austrian Radio (ORF) Big Band and the Erich Kleinschuster Sextet, performing with some European and American stars (concerts and broadcasting shows in Austria, Germany, Hungary & Switzerland). At this time he was also doing his first solo projects, like Electrio and \"Newland\".\n\n1953-1976\n\nBorn 1953 in Holland, Rens Newland started his musical carreer playing in and for several cross-over bands. Especially Scope was pioneering and successful (eventually it even made The Billboard Jazz Charts). The band toured in The Netherlands, but also in Germany."
