        "text": "PITTSBURGH -- Gloria Gaynor's declaration of independence, set to a disco beat, has supplied strength to countless people.\n\nGaynor tracked down 40 such folks to share their stories in her new book, \"We Will Survive: True Stories of Encouragement, Inspiration and the Power of Song.\"\n\nAlas, with a release date set for early December, Gaynor won't have a stack of books to sign when she greets fans at 7:15 p.m. Friday at the Pittsburgh Macy's, following her Light Up Night performance outdoors. But she'll autograph her Christmas CD as part of her appearance adding extra luster to Pittsburgh's popular holiday kickoff.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to it,\" Gaynor said Monday in a phone chat. \"I've done the Macy's Thanksgiving parade here in New York a few times and that was wonderful.\"\n\nThe Grammy-garnering Gaynor's start in the business can be traced to two Aliquippans -- twins Melvin and Mervin Steals -- who co-wrote her 1973 debut single, \"Honey Bee.\"\n\n\"I remember that was a great song written especially for me,\" Gaynor said. \"The first one I ever recorded. Well, there was one before it, but I try to forget about that one,\" she said with a hearty laugh.\n\nAs an R&B singer, Gaynor cracked the Top-10 a year later with \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" but it was her autumn 1978 disco song, \"I Will Survive,\" where she found chart-topping, double-platinum sales, and international acclaim.\n\nFreddie Perrenco, a songsmith also responsible for disco hits \"Boogie Fever\" by the Sylvers and \"Shake Your Groove Thing\" by Peaches & Herb, co-wrote \"I Will Survive\" with the lesser-known Dino Fekaris.\n\nGaynor made the song her signature work, with her voice powerfully conveying the story of a woman once petrified of losing her man, before realizing she's much better off without him. Gaynor mustered those triumphant studio vocals while wearing a back brace, part of her post-surgery recovery after falling from a New York stage.\n\nIn the 35 years since then, wronged women throughout the world -- some guys, too -- have clenched a fist and proudly sung along with Gaynor as she kicks the jerk out the door with a parting shot of \"Did you think I'd crumble?/Did you think I'd lay down and die?/Oh, no, not I/ I will survive...\"\n\nThe song has popped up prominently in numerous TV shows and movies, though Gaynor has her clear-cut favorite.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" she said. \"I love when the dog sings it in 'Men in Black 2'.\"\n\nGaynor saw the song's full potential immediately.\n\n\"I first read the lyrics and knew right away it was timeless, and I could relate it to things that had nothing to do with unrequited love,\" Gaynor said. \"Others would tell me they did the same thing over the years, so I was right. It's a song people have applied to overcoming all sorts of seemingly insurmountable challenges.\"\n\nGaynor, herself, has tapped into the song's strength to help her overcome the death of her mother and the murder of her sister, both recounted in \"We Will Survive.\"\n\n\"I sing the song to myself every time I face a problem,\" she said.\n\nThe enduring, transcendent power of \"I Will Survive\" prompted her book, written with Vanity Fair reporter Sue Carswell.\n\n\"It's a compilation of 40 stories from friends, family but mostly fans around the world, and how they were encouraged by \"I Will Survive\" to overcome very difficult and in some causes traumatic times in their lives,\" Gaynor said. \"We solicited stories through social media and different support groups like RAINN (Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) and MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving).\"\n\nOne of her favorite stories in the book is from a 93-year-old Holocaust survivor who has relied on the healing powers of \"I Will Survive.\"\n\nIn conjunction with the book, Gaynor will release a Christian CD.\n\nSinging live to pre-recorded music Friday, and joined by backing vocalists, Gaynor plans to perform a song from her upcoming CD, as well as tunes from her 2007 Christmas album. Her set, on a Smithfield Street stage outside Macy's, will begin sometime after 6:15 p.m., following performances by Pittsburgh CAPA students and YouTube singer Alyssa Bernal.\n\nThe first 100 people in line at the men's furnishings department at 7:15 that night can meet Gaynor and get her autograph on a CD.\n\nIt's a safe bet Gaynor will finish her Friday performance with \"I Will Survive.\"\n\nShe said, \"I still love singing it in concert, and on tour I save it for last.\n\n\"That song has really added reason and purpose to my life.\""
