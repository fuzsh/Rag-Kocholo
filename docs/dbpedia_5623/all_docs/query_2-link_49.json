        "text": "2. POPULAR MUSIC literally means “music of the populace,” similar to traditional folk music of the past. As it developed in the 20th century, pop music (as it has come to be called) generally consisted of music for entertainment of large numbers of people, whether on radio or in live performances. From the standard songs and ballads of the legendary Cole Porter, George Gershwin, and Frank Sinatra to the rock and roll craze of Elvis Presley and the Beatles and the present day idols in the alternative music and disco modes, popular music is now shared by the entire world.\n\n3. BALLADS The ballad originated as an expressive folksong in narrative verse with text dealing typically about love. The word is derived both from the medieval French “chanson balladee” and “ballade” which refers to a dancing song. Used by poets and composers since the 18th century, it became a slow popular love song in the 19th century.\n\n4. Today, the term ballad now refers to a love song in a slightly pop or rock style, with the following characteristics: 1.Blues Ballads The form emphasize the character of the performer more than the narrative content,and is accompanied by the banjo or guitar. 2. Pop Standard and Jazz Ballads This is a blues style built from a single verse of 16 bars ending on the dominant or half-cadence, followed by a refrain/chorus part of 16 or 32 bars in AABA form. The B section acts as the bridge, and the piece normally ends with a brief coda.\n\n5. 3. Pop and Rock Ballads A pop and rock ballad is an emotional love song with suggestions of folk music, as in the Beatles’ composition “The Ballad of John and Yoko” and Billy Joel’s “The Ballad of Billy.” This style is sometimes applied to strophic story-songs, such as Don McLean’s “American Pie.”\n\n6. STANDARDS In music, the term “standard” is used to denote the most popular and enduring songs from a particular genre or style, such as those by Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Rodgers and Hart. Its style is mostly in a slow or moderate tempo with a relaxed mood. It also features highly singable melodies within the range and technical capacity of the everyday listener.\n\n8. Another well-loved standards singer was American balladeer Nat King Cole. Although an accomplished pianist, he owes most of his popular musical fame to his soothing baritone voice, which he used to perform in big band, vocal jazz, swing. traditional pop, and jump blues genres. He was the first black American to host his own television show and maintained worldwide popularity over 40 years past his death. He is widely considered “one of the most important musical personalities in United States history.” His hit songs include Unfogettable, Mona Lisa, and Too Young\n\n9. Matt Monroe was an English singer who became one of the most popular entertainers in the international music scene during the 1960s. Throughout his 30- year career, he filled cabarets, nightclubs, music halls, and stadia in Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong to Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. Among his hit singles included Portrait of My Love, Softly as I Leave You, the James bond theme From Russia with Love, Born Free, which became his signature song, and Walk Away. Other popular singers of standards were Perry Como, Bing Crosby, Andy Williams, Sammy Davis Jr., Doris Day, Patti Page, Barbra Streisand, and Paul Anka.\n\n10. ROCK AND ROLL Rock and roll was a hugely popular song form in the United States during the late 1940’s to the 1950’s. It combined Afro-American forms such as the blues, jump blues, jazz, and gospel music with the Western swing and country music. The lead instruments were the piano and saxophone, but these were eventually replaced by modern instruments.\n\n11. The greatest exponent of the rock and roll style was the legendary Elvis Presley. His hit songs such as Heartbreak Hotel and Blue Suede Shoes were complemented by his good looks and elaborate movements that included hugging the microphone as he sang. ELVIS PRESLEY THE BEATLES\n\n12. Presley’s style was the precursor of the British band known as The Beatles, whose compositions further boosted rock and roll as the favorite genre of the times. Examples of The Beatles’ songs in this genre are I Saw Her Standing There, Get Back, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Rock and Roll Music, and Ticket to Ride.\n\n13. The Beatles’ John Lenon and Paul McCartney as Composers/Songwriters John Lennon (1940-1980) was an English musician, singer, performer, songwriter and co-songwriter. He was born and raised in Liverpool, England. He rose to worldwide fame as a founder member of the rock band The Beatles, which was considered as “the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music.”\n\n14. Lennon formed as songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney, which is considered as “one of the most celebrated songwriting partnerships of the 20th century.” Lennon’s hit compositions for the Beatles include Strawberry Fields Forever, Help, In My Life, Tomorrow Never Knows, Rain, Norwegian Road, I am the Walrus, Come Together, You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away, and Happiness is a Warm Gun.\n\n15. Sir James Paul McCartney (1942- ) is an English singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, co-writer, and composer. Paul gained worldwide popularity and fame as a member of The Beatles, which included John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Beatles was one of the most influential groups in the history of pop music. The songwriting partnership with Lennon for the Beatles is one of the most celebrated of the 20th century. McCartney has been “recognized as one of the most successful composers and performers of all time, with 60 gold discs and sales of over million albums and 100 million singles of his work with the Beatles and as a solo artist.” It has been known that more 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song Yesterday, which more than any other copyrighted song in history.\n\n16. DISCO The 1970s saw the rise of another form of pop music known as “disco.” Disco music pertained to rock music that was more danceable, thus leading to the establishment of venues for public dancing also called discos. The term originated from the French word “discotheque” which means a library for phonograph records.\n\n17. Famous figures of the disco genre include ABBA, Donna Summer (“The Queen of Disco”), The Bee Gees; Earth, Wind, and Fire; KC and the Sunshine Band; The Village People; and Gloria Gaynor, bringing us such hits as Dancing Queen, Stayin’ Alive, Boogie Wonderland, and Hot Stuff ABBA\n\n19. POP MUSIC Parallel with the disco era, other pop music superstars continued to emerge. Among them were Neil Sedaka (Laughter in the Rain), Diana Ross and the Supremes(Stop in the Name of Love), Olivia Newton John (Hopelessly Devoted to You), Stevie Wonder (You Are the Sunshine of My Life), Elton John (Skyline Pigeon), The Carpenters (We’ve Only Just Begun), and Barry Manilow (Mandy).\n\n20. MICHAEL JACKSON, The king of Pop The seventh child of the Jackson family, he made his debut as an entertainer in 1968 as a member of The Jackson 5. He then began a solo career in 1971 while still a member of the group and was referred to as the \"King of Pop\" in subsequent years. Jackson's 1982 album Thriller remains the world's best-selling album of all time, and four of his other solo studio albums are among the world's best- selling records: Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995).\n\n21. TODAYS POP IDOL As the 21st century continues to unfold, more and more pop groups emerge spanning an entire range of musical styles and genres. There are music groups like Black Eyed Peas, K Pop (Korean), My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boys, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Souja Boy, Train, Maroon 5, and One Direction. While solo performers include Adele, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Ariana Grande, Justin Beiber, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Nikki Minaj, Selena Gomez, and others.\n\n22. HIP HOP AND RAPHip hop music is a stylized, highly rhythmic type of music that usually (but not always) includes portions of rhytmically chanted words called “rap.” In rapping, the artist speaksalong with an instrumental or synthesized beat. Hip hop arose in the 1970s within the Afro-American and Latino youth in the Bronx area of New York City. But by the 1980s, it had spread to many other countries. It has since evolved into a subculture that encompasses music (rapping, DJing, scratching, and beatboxing); a nearly acrobatic style of dancing, called break dancing; a distinct manner of dress; and graffiti-style artwork.\n\n23. PHILIPPINE POPULAR MUSIC The one word that comes to mind when we think of contemporary Philippine music is the type commonly termed as Original Pinoy Music or Original Philippine Music, or OPM for short. It was originally used to refer only to Philippine pop songs, particularly ballads, such as those popular after the collapse of its predecessor, the Manila Sound, in the late 1970s up until the present.\n\n24. In the 1960s to 1970s, Nora Aunor, Pilita Corrales, Eddie Peregrina, Victor Wood, Asin, APO Hiking Society, and others were highly popular OPM singers. In the 1970s to 1980s, the major commercial Philippine pop music artists were Claire dela Fuente, Didith Reyes, Rico Puno, Ryan Cayabyab, Basil Valdez, Celeste Legaspi, Hajji Alejandro, Rey Valera, Freddie Aguilar, Imelda Papin, Eva Eugenio, Nonoy Zuñiga, and many others.\n\n25. ORIGINAL PILIPINO MUSIC (OPM) The 1980s to 1990s are also regarded as the golden era of Philippine ballads. Among the classics that emerged were those created by: Ryan Cayabyab (Kay Ganda ng Ating Musika, Kahit Ika’y Panaginip Lang) George Canseco (Kapantay ay Langit, Kastilyong Buhangin, Tubig at Langis) Willie Cruz (Sana’y Wala Nang Wakas, Bituing Walang Ningning) Jose Mari Chan (Beautiful Girl, Please Be Careful With My Heart, Constant Change) Gary Valenciano (Sana Maulit Muli)\n\n26. Most of these compositions made use of Western-type melody and harmony, while expressing uniquely Filipino emotions in movingly poetic lyrics. These came to be known as OPM, and were popularized by solo artists like Pilita Corales, Nora Aunor, Basil Valdez, Celeste Legaspi, Hajji Alejandro, Leah Navarro, Sharon Cuneta, Martin Nievera, Gary Valenciano, ZsaZsa Padilla, Regine Velasquez, and Ogie Alcasid.\n\n27. At the start, OPM was centered in Manila, where Tagalog and English are the dominant languages. However, other ethno-linguistic groups such as the Visayan, Bikol, Kapampangan, and Ilocano also began to sing and record their songs in their native dialects. Between the 1980s and 1990s, OPM was led by artists such as Martin Nievera, Gary Valenciano, Lea Salonga, Regine Velasquez, Sharon Cuneta, Vina Morales, Raymond Lauchengco, Francis Magalona, Pops Fernandez, José Mari Chan, Dingdong Avanzado, Janno Gibbs, Ogie Alcasid, Joey Albert, Manilyn Reynes, among many others.\n\n28. In the 1990s, the famous solo artists and bands included The Eraserheads, Smokey Mountain, Donna Cruz, Jessa Zaragoza, Ariel Rivera, Southborder, Afterimage, Andrew E., Jaya, Rivermaya, Parokya ni Edgar, among many others. Underground bands emerged and along with them were their perceptions of idealism and self-expression. More recently, OPM stars have included Yeng Constantino, Sarah Geronimo, Aisa Seguerra, and international singers Arnel Pineda (of the international rock group, Journey), Charice Pempengco, and others.\n\n29. PHILIPPINE POP MUSIC Pop music in the Philippines started as an adaptation or translation, if not complete imitation, of Western hits. It started with Bobby Gonzales’ Hahabol-habol (Hot Pursuit), a local version of the rock and roll songs of the 1950s, and Rico Puno’s Luneta, a local adaptation of The Way We Were. This immediately clicked with the youth and eventually gained wide acceptance even among the “burgis” (bourgeois or elite) crowd.\n\n30. The start of the “Manila Sound” in the mid-1970s gave rise to songs using a colloquial language called Taglish, a combination of Tagalog and English. These Filipino lyrics sung to pop melodies resulted in highly singable songs with contemporary appeal. Among the proponents of the Manila Sound were the Hotdog, Cinderella, The Rainmakers, and the Apo Hiking Society. After waning briefly in the 1990’s, this sound regained.\n\n31. PHILIPPINE JAZZ Philippine musicians have also been inspired by jazz music. Among them are jazz pianist and recording artist Boy Katindig, who comes from the well-known clan of musicians that includes jazz piano legend Romy Katindig and saxophonist Eddie Katindig. The Katindig family pioneered Latin jazz in Manila. Other notable Filipino jazz musicians include Lito Molina, Angel Peña, Emil Mijares, and internationally known jazz pianist Bobby Enriquez.\n\n32. PHILIPPINE ALTERNATIVE FOLK MUSIC The Philippines also saw the rise of alternative folk music which was different from the traditional and popular form. This new form combined ethnic instrumentation with electronic accompaniment, while presenting themes or issues of society and the environment. Some of the Filipino composers who championed this style were Joey Ayala, Grace Nono, and Edru Abraham of Kontragapi (“Kontemporaryong Gamelan Pilipino”). Among other Filipino composers whose styles ranged from folk to semi- ethnic werewere Freddie Aguilar, best known for his song Anak; Yoyoy Villame, composer of Magellan; Florante, composer of Ako’y Isang Pinoy; and Gary Granada, composer of Ka Bayani\n\n33. PHILIPPINE ROCK The year 1973 saw the birth of Philippine or “Pinoy” rock music which successfully merged the rock beat with Filipino lyrics. This new sound was introduced by the legendary Juan de la Cruz Band (with their song Ang Himig Natin) which had for its members Joey “Pepe” Smith, Wally Gonzales, and the originator of Jeproks, Mike Hanopol, who later became a major symbol of Pinoy rock.\n\n34. Continuing this legacy of Pinoy rock today are vocal groups and bands that include River Maya, The Dawn, True Faith, The Eraserheads, Wolfgang, Bamboo, Parokya ni Edgar, Hale, Sandwich, SugarFree, Sponge Cola,and others.\n\n35. PINOY RAP I n the Philippines, rap was also made popular by such composers and performers as Francis Magalona (Mga Kababayan Ko and Watawat) and Andrew E (Humanap Ka ng Pangit). Francis Magalona was born on October 4, 1964 and died on March 6, 2009. He is also known as FrancisM, “Master Rapper,” and “The Man From Manila.” He was a Filipino rapper, songwriter, producer, actor, director, television host, and photographer. He is often hailed as the “King of Pinoy Rap” and is considered a legend in the Philippine music community."
