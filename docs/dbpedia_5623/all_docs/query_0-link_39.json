        "text": "This gospel/blues/soul album offers a laid back experience, full of powerful truths from the scriptures wrapped up in a modern day, lyrical setting. Her pristine vocals settle nicely in the foreground cushioned by exquisite musical arrangements and at times backed by a small choir. This album “Testimony” was recorded at RCA Studio A in Nashville Tennessee, with guest appearances from Jason Crabb, Yolanda Adams, Bart Millard (whose song “I Can Only Imagine” is the best-selling single of all time in the history of Contemporary Christian Music) and Mike Farris. In the late 70s disco artist Gloria Gaynor’s career fully surfaced with her incredible classic disco track “I Will Survive” an anthem on all of our lips at the time regardless of age or whether we fully understood at the time what she was singing about or not, that didn’t matter. It was/is a track that takes us back to the place we first heard it. I was at an ice rink disco skating singing my heart out. Gloria is now 75 years old with a lot of life experience behind her, and of much we can glean from those experiences and her wisdom. She suffered sex abuse at the age of 12 which caused difficulties in later life in her relationships. At a concert in New York she fell backwards over a monitor and woke up the next morning paralyzed from the waist down. She walked again but this injury led to operations and years of chronic pain. She has also lost her parents and siblings, been married and divorced. “I Will Survive” has probably been a personal anthem for Gloria herself throughout her life. Throughout her new album “Testimomy” comes shining through what she has gleaned from her own personal pain to a great understanding of Jesus companionship, love and help as she has walked along her life’s journey. Through her pain she now offers us this beautiful uplifting encouraging album “Testimony”, and it sure is a great testimony of her faith that she passes on to us through these beautiful, encouraging, truthful, uplifting songs. Her track “Back On Top” enables us to hear where she is now. She’s “Back on Top.” Album highlights: From track to track you’re going to hear lyrics that will take you on a journey of your own life, where you have been, where you are and where you are going. “Testimony” will warm your heart and bring hope to your soul. Joy Comes In The Morning: “Joy comes in the morning/If you just be still/Joy comes in the morning/No matter how bad it feels.” He Won’t Let Go: “Take a look at me I’m living proof/Trust and believe He’ll do the same for you/It’s nothing we can earn, it just takes a little faith/It’s nothing we deserve, it’s just His amazing grace/And if you’ll hold on, He won’t let go, He won’t let go/Just put your hand in the hand, in the hand of the man with the master plan/and He won’t let go, He won’t let go/He won’t let go.” This album will bring you a sense of peace if you don’t have it. I’ll leave you with this thought, some people have praise music on in their homes quietly in the background all the time, they say it creates a peaceful atmosphere having words of scriptures, encouraging positive words filling the atmosphere constantly. This album is so relatable, truthful, gentle and laid back it will add to the peace in your life. Gloria Gaynor believes that peace is the greatest gift we can have, she has found it through her faith in Jesus, she offers a glimpse into her world and life through this album showing us that her hand is in the hand of the one with the master plan and our hand can be too.\n\nVivienne Neville 10/10"
