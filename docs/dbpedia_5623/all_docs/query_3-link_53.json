        "text": "Sponsored by Lakeland Bank\n\nGloria Gaynor’s legendary career spans over 50 years never losing momentum. She’s channeled her fame into support for several charities, donating not only her money but also her time and talent. She has been honored in recent years by several institutions including the Martin Luther King Jr Award, the Library of Congress, Buzz Aldrin & the APOLLO XI 50th Celebration, and the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\n\nGloria continues to write and record music. Her recent work in Nashville with an award-winning team delivered her new album, “TESTIMONY.” The album debuted in the BILLBOARD Gospel Chart Top 5, the iTunes Gospel Top 3 and the Amazon Chart’s Top 20. It received rave reviews from Rolling Stone, Billboard, The Herald-Standard, CBS Sunday Morning, and The TODAY Show! “TESTIMONY,” also received two GRAMMY® nominations for Best Roots Gospel Album and for Best Gospel Performance bringing home the Best Roots Gospel GRAMMY® at the 2020 Awards.\n\nA feature documentary from Storyville Entertainment about Gloria will be released later this year. The film reveals how the unstoppable Gaynor, who, despite incredible hardship, has wielded her undeniable musical talent to change the course of her life, having surmounted illness, paralysis, her sister’s murder, a 25-year traumatic marriage (and divorce) and a cleaned-out bank account. Discovering faith and self-love, Gloria never lost vision nor momentum throughout incredibly devastating times. Facing ageism and a ticking clock, she invested her own resources to self-produce “Testimony” – winning her second Grammy 40 years after her first for “I Will Survive.” Helming the documentary are Storyville’s President, Betsy Schecter, and award-winning editor, David Zeiff.\n\nThe new year finds Gloria spending the start of 2023 in Nashville, TN working on co-writing new songs for an upcoming EP that will be released in September 2023. Also coming later this year is a special new perfume scent that Gloria is currently working on with a team of award-winning perfume specialists."
