        "text": "Des Delgadillo\n\nThe Marias at Baby’s All Right | Dec. 18\n\nThis relatively new act out of L.A. fashions some sentimental pop that feels like it wafted out of a 70s club on a cloud of smoke and perfume. The duo composes lush tracks ready to become a part of your love life. Get romantic when The Marias come to Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn with special guests The Pheels and Pecas.\n\nCommon Kings at Brooklyn Bowl | Dec. 19\n\nUnlike what their name might suggest, the sound this band churns out is anything but common. Rooted in Samoa, Tonga, Fiji and Hawaii, the Cotton Kings blur cultural lines with their soul and reggae-infused rock sound. The quartet just dropped their full-length this year, with myriad top producers contributing to the stirring effort. Vibe to the crew’s upbeat sound when they play the Brooklyn Bowl with Roots of Creation.\n\nPentatonix at Beacon Theatre | Dec. 19-21\n\nFew things are as closely intertwined as Pentatonix and the holiday season. Whether it’s at a department store, on television or at the Beacon Theatre from Dec. 19-21, the a cappella group’s sounds are being enjoyed almost as much as gingerbread lattes. The group’s tremendous harmonies and festive tunes are all anyone needs to get that last push into the holiday spirit.\n\nBilly Joel at Madison Square Garden | Dec. 20\n\nLet’s not kid ourselves. Every show the piano man performs as part of his historic Madison Square garden residency is beyond magical, but with Christmas just days away from his next show, this one’s bound to be extra special. Expect all his usual great hits with a side of holiday cheer served up by the maestro himself.\n\nRonnie Spector at City Winery | Dec. 20 + 21\n\nOne of the most enduring staples of the famed “girl group” era, Ronnie Spector came to prominence as part of the Ronettes before breaking away from the group and ex-husband Phil Specter to pursue solo avenues. Her history is full of amazing duets with some of the best in the business. Although her voice doesn’t quite pack the same punch of her glory days, she has adapted to a style more conducive to her strengths, and she continues to flourish amid a sea of newcomers. See for yourself when she plays City Winery.\n\nTaylor McFerrin at Good Room | Dec. 21\n\nAfter contributing to father Bobby Mcferrin’s debut back in the 1980s, Taylor grew to be quite the instrumentalist, incorporating beat-boxing and creative production moves. A fortuitous relationship with Flying Lotus’s Brain Feeder label gave him an outlet for even more creative music that never fails to push the envelope. He’ll keep pushing it in a live setting when he plays Good Room.\n\nJon Bellion at Terminal 5 | Dec. 21 + 22\n\nBellion is best known for penning “The Monster,” a beastlike outing in its own right, with the Eminem-Rihanna duet enjoying an extended stay atop the Billboard Hot 100. Since then, Bellion’s been back in the lab, this time taking on his own music, which borrows from r&b and indie rock to create something full of soul and just enough introspection. Don’t miss him when he plays two dates at Terminal 5.\n\nA Darlene Love Christmas at BB King Blues Club | Dec. 21-23\n\nDespite her status as a Rock n Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Love never had the impressive track record of most solo singers, instead often contributing more behind the scenes. Still, her take on holiday favorites never fails to get listeners in the spirit. She has three dates celebrating the spirit of the season when she plays BB King Blues Club.\n\nNGHTMRE at Terminal 5 | Dec. 23\n\nThe fresh-faced producer made his live debut in a big way, spinning at the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, the Mecca of dance music soirees. It all happened so fast. One minute he lucked out and had one of his tracks played by Skrillex, and the next he was collaborating with Dillon Francis. NGHTMRE’s star’s very much still on the way up. Catch him bringing the grooves to Terminal 5 with Valentino Khan and Justin caruso.\n\nLarge Professor at Highline Ballroom | Dec. 26\n\nOriginally getting his start with Main Source before creative differences forced a split, Large Professor helped power many albums forward from greats like Eric B. & Rakim. His solo work incorporated what he learned from producing those larger-than-life luminaries. Get hyped to his head-nodding beats when Large Professor plays the Highline Ballroom with the iconic Statik Selektah and Roc Marciano.\n\nThe Shivers at Bar Lunatico | Dec. 26\n\nRock, soul and folk epitomize this staple of New York music, and although the lineup might constantly change, their hard-hitting party dynamic remains the same. Their songs range from warm and bubbly to cool as ice. Don’t get left out in the cold. Catch the Shivers at Bar Lunatico.\n\nTrans-Siberian Orchestra at Prudential Center (Newark) | Dec. 26\n\nA group whose first few studio efforts rang clear with holiday tones hits the Prudential Center just 24 hours removed from the day many of their albums celebrate. It’s also a landmark occasion for the larger-than-life project, with this tour marking their first since the death of founder Paul O’Neill.\n\nThe Dillinger Escape Plan at Terminal 5 | Dec. 27\n\nThere are few bands as face-melting in their approach as the Dillinger Escape Plan, with frenetic flurries dotting everything they do. But what separates them from another average Joe hardcore band is the technical prowess with which they rage, with every measure precisely calculated before it’s delivered. Bodies will be flying every which way when they play Terminal 5, so prepare yourself. The mighty Mike Patton and God Mother will also be on the bill.\n\nThe Felice Brothers at Brooklyn Bowl | Dec. 27\n\nThis sonically dazzling quartet of brothers Ian, Simone, and James Felice along with Christmas Clapton make their blend of folk and Americana sound absolutely irresistible. Often driven by accordion, it’s hard not to get lost in the mechanics of every song, that is until the lyrics kick in, making listeners’ brains work just as hard as their grooving bodies. They’ll be bringing all kinds of those grooves to the Brooklyn Bowl on Dec. 27.\n\nThomas Jack at Output | Dec. 27\n\nOne of the leading trop-house pioneers comes to New York for a date at Output. His take on dance music influenced big-name producers including Kygo, and you can hear much of his influence on albums from noteworthy artists like Drake. Feel those uplifting vibes when he touches down in The Big Apple. Just because it’s cold doesn’t mean you won’t be able to feel the sun, especially not when Jack brings his tropical flair.\n\nThe White Panda at Irving Plaza | Dec. 27\n\nThere’s just so much going on when The White Panda comes to town. The mashup kings put on quite the extravagant live performance, complete with the best effects around and digitally projected panda masks. Plus, what’s not to love about your favorite songs getting the mashup treatment, making for a perfect night of hardcore rug-cutting? Don’t miss them when they come to Irving Plaza.\n\nPhish at Madison Square Garden | Dec. 27-31\n\nThe iconic freeform outfit hit MSG for a string of shows that Abbi Abrams herself would be proud of. The group made waves with their emphasis on improvisation, a nod to their jazz routes, while generously throwing heaps of folk influences to boot. Don’t get left out in the cold and catch Phish when they play New York’s entertainment Mecca.\n\nMartin Rev and The Juan Maclean w/ Strange Names at The Bowery Electric | Dec. 28\n\nA musical mastermind whose every album features a new, distinct sound, Martin Rev never fails to impress with his versatility. Couple that with a DJ set from The Juan MacLean, and this is the kind of show to make anyone give a roaring “yippee-ki-yay!”\n\nMatisyahu at Irving Plaza | Dec. 28\n\nWhere Matisyahu’s effortlessly flawless flows go, the party is sure to follow. The rapper and beat boxer has been merging his skills with top-notch reggae production for over a decade, and the result is still a staggeringly energetic and sometimes politically wrought barrage of sound.\n\nTalib Kweli DJ set at Brooklyn Bowl | Dec. 28\n\nOne of the godfathers of conscious hip-hop takes an unfamiliar spot behind the ones and twos, but one can’t help but expect an explosive performance from the man anyway. With a finger adeptly on the pulse, Kweli’s certainly hip to all the new trends before the casual listener is, so he’s bound to drop some gems on the Brooklyn Bowl masses when he gets to spinning some of 2017’s hottest highlights.\n\nMarcus King Band at Gramercy Theatre | Dec. 28-29\n\nSon of grizzled bluesman Marvin King, young Marcus approaches his music with incredible passion and maturity. You wouldn’t know he’s barely lived two decades with the way he takes charge on record and stage. Get a taste of the greatness that’s to come when he hits the Gramercy Theatre with some special guests.\n\nMija, GG Magree, Zomboy, Jauz, Zeds Dead, Bro Safari at New York Expo Center | Dec. 29 + 31\n\nRPM’s hosting a pre-New Years Eve party that’s bound to rock harder than anything involving a ball dropping. Get positively lit with the hottest dance acts right now. It’s a night that will rock so hard you won’t know what hit you the next morning.\n\nLettuce at Brooklyn Bowl | Dec 29 + 31\n\nThese funky favorites got their start in New York, endearing themselves to anyone who would give them the time of day until they proved their detractors wrong. There’s so much levity in the way lettuce plays their instruments and dominates the stage. Unlike actual lettuce, this band is anything but bland. Get down when they play the Brooklyn Bowl, and you have two chances to catch them. Don’t miss special guest Jon Scofield.\n\nFlosstradamus at Brooklyn Steel | Dec. 30\n\nThe DJ duo turned superstar syndicate brought trap to the masses thanks to their big, gritty beats. The Chicago producers are bringing that sound to New York as part of the lead-up to New Years Eve, so expect chaos when they storm Brooklyn Steel. That chaos will be doubled thanks to a special set from Phantoms.\n\nSammy Adams at Gramercy Theatre | Dec. 30\n\nNamed after Boston’s favorite lager, Sammy Adams injects a boastful attitude into everything he chooses to grace with his flow.

Get there early for Millyz, Farrow and Titus.\n\nMacy Gray at Iridium | Dec. 30 + 31\n\nA unique sense of style and a patented rasp gave Gray a ready-made entryway into the music scene, and she was soon putting her signature spin on jazzy standards while giving music fans a palatable alternative to r&b. Her pop appeal might not be as great as it once was, but she continues fortifying an already sound catalogue with more vocal workouts.\n\nThe Budos Band at Knitting Factory | Dec. 31\n\nThis winning afro-beat and jazz-funk ensemble might have a lot of moving parts, but sometimes it takes a crowd to bring so much soul. They’re quick to kick it with huge horns and bone-crunching percussion, and they’ve got big plans this new Years Eve. Get down with them when they bring their worldly to the Knitting Factory.\n\nFSOE 500 at Brooklyn Hangar | Dec. 31\n\nEgyptian EDM standouts Aly & Fila bring FSOE 500 to Brooklyn.

Evelyn Evelyn at Brooklyn Bazaar | Dec. 31\n\nAn interesting project from Amanda Palmer and Jason Webley, Evelyn Evelyn revolves around conjoined twins who performed in a circus from ages 11-19 until Palmer and Webley helped them record an album.
