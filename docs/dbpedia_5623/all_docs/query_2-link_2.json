        "text": "I know it's been an eight year-long process working on the new documentary. What was it like bringing it to life with director Betsy Schechter?\n\nIt was difficult because I was working and there were things happening in both our lives that hindered us from coming together from time to time and progressing with the process — so part of what made it take so long was personal reasons. It was fun and tedious, but most of the time it was fun.\n\nWhat was it like seeing your emotional story on screen for the first time?\n\nWell, I went through several emotions. It was kind of cathartic. It was surprising to see the reactions of people in the audience with me. When I was watching it on my own, I was like, \"Is this going to be popular?\" Because when you're watching your own life, you don't think anything big of it. You think everybody has the same problems and stories. But it was mixed emotions.\n\nPeople are saying they're learning new things about me that they've never known before or suspected. But a lot of people are also saying that they're being encouraged, and uplifted, and empowered by what they've seen in the documentary. It's been really wonderful, when it comes to the response. It's been tremendous.\n\nIn the midst of production of the documentary, you entirely self-funded the album Testimony which later won a GRAMMY for Best Roots Gospel Album in 2020. Why was it important for you to release this independently and take on that risk?\n\nBecause I really believed it was something that God would have me do. When He calls you to do it, of course you do it. Unless I was totally wrong in what I believed I heard, in which case it'd just be an experience.\n\nBut I really felt I had been called to do this, because it was something I've wanted to do for many years. My old management didn't think it was important. He was so interested in the money that would not come from whatever other music I did. So he thought, why bother? But for me, it was more than money.\n\nWhat did vindication of the subsequent GRAMMY win mean to you?\n\nIt was awesome and very, very validating for me. Just uplifting and encouraging. The GRAMMY is an award that comes from your peers; people who are in the business who know what it takes to record an album or talent when they hear it. It was extremely rewarding for me to win a GRAMMY for that album that was so not championed by everybody in the business.\n\nAnd leading up to the win, what was it like when you heard you were nominated?\n\nIt was like, \"Okay, if this happens I'm going to be flying high.\" And for sure I was.\n\nBut this wasn't your first GRAMMY, because I know that distinction goes back to 1980 for \"I Will Survive.\" Do you remember anything from that night?\n\nWell, I was not familiar with the filming of the televising of the GRAMMYs; it was my first time there and I was actually not there when I received the GRAMMY.\n\nWhere were you?\n\nI was in the restroom! I thought I could run to the restroom and get back and seated before it started, and then [my category came up]. Someone else received my GRAMMY and held it for like five years.\n\nFive years, why?\n\nI didn't even know who had it. But it was Tom Moulton, who was the geneious mixologist who did \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" and \"I Am What I Am.\" He received the award for me and kept it before I even found out where it was. [But] I got it back from him!\n\n\"I Will Survive\" was waiting for you for a couple years until you recorded it. So what did you say and what did songwriters Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris say when you decided to record it?\n\nWhat had happened was, I was sent to record a song that the record company president had chosen because he was newly over from England and had a hit with a song there (\"Substitute\", originally by the Righteous Brothers). He wanted to repeat the success of it here in the United States with me.\n\nThey asked me what could be on the B side because they weren't sure about it, and wondered what kind of songs I liked. So I said, \"I like songs that are thoughtful, meaningful and touch people's hearts and have a good melody.\" So they said, \"Well, we think you're the one we've been waiting for to record this song we wrote two years prior.\" I was like, \"Okay, what song is that?\"\n\nWhen I read the lyrics I said, \"What are you stupid, you're going to put this on the B-side? This is a timeless lyric. I'm standing here relating to this song since I had a back brace on from a surgery I had just had. I'm relating it to the fact that my mother passed away a few years prior, something I never thought I'd survive. Everybody is going to relate every traumatic situation they're going through with this song. Any situation they find seemingly insurmountable, they can relate.\" So they said, \"Well, that's the deal we made.\" So I said, \"Well, if it's for me then it won't stay on the B-side.\"\n\nWhat happened when it was released?\n\nIt was definitely on the B-side, but they gave us a box of records, and there were 25 in a box, and we took them to Studio 54 and asked the DJ there, Richie Kaczor, to play it. When he did, the audience definitely responded to it, so I thought, \"Okay, this jaded New York audience is losing their mind over this record, I have no doubt I'm right that this is a hit.\"\n\nSo I asked him to give the records to his DJ friends in New York to play it, and they did and people began to request it on radio. The stations started calling the label: \"Where is this record people keep asking for?\" And the rest is history.\n\nThe song has impacted so many people over the years. Do you have any special memories of hearing how it impacted someone?\n\nWhat immediately comes to mind is a situation that happened when I was in Italy. I had actually rewritten the words because I had become a devout Christian and wanted it reflected in the song. So I changed it from saying \"It took all strength I had not to fall apart\" to \"Only the Lord can give me strength not to fall apart.\" And then when it said, \"Now you see me somebody new,\" I changed it to say \"He made me somebody new.\"\n\nAfter I sang those words for the first time at the concert in Italy, afterwards a young lady came to me and said, \"You saved my life. I've been living here for almost a year and its been really, really difficult for me and I was going to home to commit suicide. But now that I've heard you sing that song, I know where my strength can come from and I don't have to die.\" I'll never forget her.\n\nBefore \"I Will Survive\" you had an early hit with \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" which was originally recorded by the Jackson 5. Take me inside the studio for that one.\n\nWhat I remember about recording that song is that we went into the studio, the track had been done and now I'm putting my vocal on it. The producer told me, \"Look, you can't sing it like Michael Jackson. You have to do your own thing with it. Let's stop now, go home and rehearse it and stop trying to sing it like Michael.\"\n\nI was so frustrated and came back the next day after not rehearsing anything, because I thought, This is the way I sing it. So when I got into the studio I knew I wanted to do something different, so I thought of the words and tried to make them really personal to me and just do it. My attitude after I finished was, \"That's it, and if you don't like it, too bad!\" And as I was thinking that, he jumped up from the console and said, \"That's the take!\"\n\nClive Davis first signed you to Columbia Records in 1973. How quickly did your life change after that?\n\nI was taken to Columbia and introduced by Paul Leka, a producer there at the time, and he was the one who introduced me to Clive. What I remember most of all is that Clive had me do three auditions; I went to New York to sing for him three times. I said, \"There's no way this man has to hear me sing three times before he determines I can sing, he just likes my voice and wants a free concert.\" [Laughs]\n\nHe finally did sign me, but unfortunately right after I recorded my first song he left to form his own company. And I was not signed to Clive, I was signed to RCA, so he couldn't take me with him and I remained at Columbia. So my career took a different course I'm sure than if I had been signed to him specifically.\n\nNew generations continue to discover your music and \"I Will Survive,\" and you've even recorded new material as of late with people like Kylie Minogue. What has your recent resurgence been like?\n\nIt's wonderful, I feel like I have not missed my calling and that I'm on the path I'm supposed to be on. It's extremely rewarding, validating and encouraging. It's wonderful. I feel like a family heirloom, passing me down from one generation to another.\n\nAn Ode To Donna Summer's 1970s: How The Disco Queen Embodied Both Innovator And Vixen\n\nIn Glitter Up the Dark: How Pop Music Broke the Binary, music writer Sasha Geffen explores the history of queer anthems past and present.\n\n\"I think it's important to honor these ancestors in the queer narrative and point to how things don't always go from worse to better,\" Geffen tells GRAMMY.com. \"Right now in our current historical moment, where we're seeing a lot of closing in and that can be really scary, but there has always kind of been this pulsing and there has always been the survival.\"\n\nA Global Musical Movement\n\nIn fact, \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" wasn’t even the first gay anthem. One of the earliest is the 1920 German cabaret number \"Das lila Lied\" (\"The Lavender Song\"), a clear product of the relative sexual freedom of the Weimar Republic. Written around the time of sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld hosting the First International Conference for Sexual Reform, the song recognized the struggles queer people faced while also declaring, \"and still most of us are proud/ to be cut from different cloth!\"\n\nIn Europe, musicals provided sly opportunities to explore queer themes, notably the work of English playwright Noël Coward, whose hidden sexuality was expressed in unrequited love songs such as \"Mad About the Boy'' and \"If Love Were All.\" In the United States, Black women defined many of these early queer anthems, notably Ma Rainey and Billie Holiday, with \"Prove It on Me Blues\" and \"Easy Living,\" respectively. As Geffen says, their music was \"playful and raunchy and it sold.\"\n\nHoliday and Rainey, along with her prodigy, Bessie Smith, were all bisexual — an identity that along with their race and gender threatened their professional careers. They faced not only social ostracization, but also legal threats due to their sexuality. Yet these pioneers still expressed their emotions openly, as Ma Rainey sings on \"Prove It on Me Blues\": \"I went out last night with a crowd of my friends'/It must've been women, 'cause I don't like no men/ Wear my clothes just like a fan/ Talk to the gals just like any old man.\"\n\nThe war years and social conservative of the 1950s didn’t see many lasting gay anthems, as white, male musicians appropriated and made famous the rebellious rock and roll sound of Black musicians. This was clear in songs like Little Richard’s \"Tutti Frutti\" (with clear sexual undertones) and \"Hound Dog\" by Big Mamma Thornton, who wore men’s clothes and has been appreciated for representing Black queerness.\n\nThrough the sexual revolution of the mid-20th century, Black women continued to produce some of the most boundary-pushing music. Nina Simone switched the gender preference in her bubbly version of \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\" — from Lana Turner to… Liberace — and Diana Ross delivered a sultry take on \"Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,\" showing the depths someone is willing to go for their paramour.\n\nYet it’s impossible to include just one song by the disco diva in a compendium of queer anthems, overt or implied. The inspiration for 1980’s \"I’m Coming Out\" actually came out of a New York gay bar: Famed songwriter Nile Rodgers went to the bathroom and noticed a group of Ross impersonators. As Rodgers told Billboard in 2011, \"I ran outside and called Bernard [Edwards, his frequent collaborator] and told him about it and said, ‘What if we recognize Diana Ross’ really cool alignment with her fan base in the gay community?’ So we sat down and wrote, ‘I’m Coming Out.’\"\n\nDuring this period of second-wave feminism, songs of female empowerment were also adapted by the queer community, such as Lesley Gore’s \"You Don’t Own Me\" (Gore herself came out as a lesbian in 2005). Some male acts embraced all that defied social norms, whether around identity or sexuality (although some of their depictions of race and gender can be questioned): \"Lola\" by the Kinks, \"Walk on the Wild Side\" by Lou Reed and \"Rebel Rebel\" by David Bowie, whose glam rock pushed against boundaries in terms of gender presentation.\n\nMore so than any genre before it, the arrival of disco in the 1970s provided a soundtrack for the LGBTQ+ community. In fact, it could be said it was the first genre made for and by queer folks was disco, with high-rotation tracks like Donna Summer’s \"I Feel Love,\" Chaka Khan’s \"I’m Every Woman\" or even ABBA’s \"Dancing Queen.\" But arguably the most powerful queer anthem was Gloria Gaynor’s \"I Will Survive,\" an unabashed tribute to overcoming against all odds that can still be heard blasting from Pride floats today.\n\nIn maybe a less nuanced but equally impactful sense during this time, the Village People also played with gay sexual fantasies in both their appearance and music, notably with their songs \"Macho Man\" and \"Y.M.C.A.\" While the camp was turned up to 11, the Village People’s influence in bringing queer life to the mainstream cannot be underestimated.\n\nOpenly queer artists also began asserting themselves more than ever by the 1980s and the rise of synth pop, finding fans among straight and queer communities, often in a \"you know if you know way,\" according to Geffen. The sound coming from British groups like Culture Club (\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\"), Soft Cell (\"Tainted Love\") or Bronski Beat (\"Smalltown Boy\") was inextricable from queerness; an uptempo beat and thematic undercurrent ran through many of the era's biggest pop songs. These artists were \"talking about an experience that was very specific to the queer community — this idea of figuring out who you are and leaving home and not knowing where you're gonna be ending up and just trusting something out there might be better than what you've got,\" Geffen notes.\n\nAlso during the 1980s, queer anthems also began to proliferate beyond English-language music, proving that a desire to express queerness through music was universal. This was notably seen in Canadian-French artist Mylène Farmer’s \"Libertine\" and \"Sans contrefaçon\" about embracing androgyny. And in the Spanish-speaking world, there was Alaska y Dinarama's \"¿A quién le importa?\" which translates to \"who cares?\"\n\nAnthems Rocked By Trauma\n\nBut this relative opening in terms of gay acceptance in popular culture was quickly shaken by the HIV/AIDS crisis, when queer anthems took on an even stronger political role. Whether it be Queen’s \"I Want to Break Free\" or \"Somebody to Love,\" Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s \"Relax\" or Sylvester’s \"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real),\" these anthems were unabashed about expressing romantic feelings and sexual desire, as well as fighting back against violence, silence and stereotyping.\n\nKnown for his falsetto voice, Sylvester was one of the leading voices in San Francisco’s growing queer community before passing away from AIDS-related complications in 1988. His song \"Stars\" is one of Geffen’s favorite queer anthems, particularly for how he conveyed both the joy and hardship of the queer experience.\n\n\"He had such a powerful voice and powerful control over the subtleties of using it,\" Geffen continues. \"There was this kind of melancholy that I can hear coming through sometimes of celebrating the world that you're in, this kind of sub-world inside the world where these forms of relationships are possible.\"\n\nRead more: 'Spiceworld' At 25: How The Spice Girls' Feminine Enthusiasm & Camp Became A Beacon For Queer Youth\n\nFemale artists — many of whom were open allies of the queer community — also addressed the devastation of the epidemic. TLC’s \"Waterfalls\" (a cautionary tale with a hopeful note to \"believe in yourself\") and Cyndi Lauper’s \"True Colors,\" a torch song to light the way in the darkest of times. Although, this relationship of seemingly straight artists to the queer community was not without faults. Madonna became a queer icon for her string of hits before kicking off the 1990s with \"Vogue,\" a track that brought queer ballroom culture to a mainstream audience. While Madonna was clearly celebrating this art form, and giving a certain amount of recognition to those who created it, she was also making money off the talent and creativity of underrecognized queer communities of color.\n\nOutside of mainstream music, the 1990s saw queer female artists asserting their identity, accompanied by the riot grrrl movement and Lilith Fair. These ranged from the Indigo Girls’ reflective \"Closer to Fine\" to k.d. lang’s yearnful \"Constant Craving\" to Bikini Kill’s \"Rebel Girl,\" \"the queen of my world.\"\n\nThe Sound Of A New Millennium\n\nThe turn of the millennium heralded the beginning of a more assertive acceptance, with anthems coming from sometimes unexpected sources: Christina Aguilera’s \"Beautiful,\" P!nk’s \"Raise Your Glass,'' Robyn’s \"Dancing on My Own\" or Macklemore's \"Same Love.\" With the political fight for marriage equality quickly gaining ground in the U.S., pop artists began responding with overtly pro-LGBTQAI+ messages in their music: Lady Gaga kicked off the 2010s with \"Born This Way,\" with the theme that there is nothing abnormal about being queer.\n\nMore recently, anthems have shed any need to hide their queerness through hidden messages or innuendos. Proudly queer artists are creating music clearly for their communities, and beyond: think Janelle Monae’s ode to female pleasure \"Pynk,\" Perfume Genius’ searing \"Queen\" or Hayley Kiyoko’s \"Girls Like Girls,\" whose title says it all (and was followed up with the more cheerful anthem \"for the girls\").\n\nPerhaps most notably, genres that have been slower to embrace LGBTQAI+ artists have also had their share of anthems. Rap in particular has embraced queer artists from Cupcakke (\"LGBT\") to Frank Ocean (\"Channel\") to Leikeli47’s ​​(\"Attitude\") to anything by Mykki Blanco. This also has been true in country: See Katie Pruitt’s \"Loving Her,\" Kacey Musgraves’ \"Follow Your Arrow'' or Orville Peck and his interpretation of \"Smalltown Boy.\" This honoring of queer history and pioneers defines many modern queer anthems, perhaps most strongly in Beyoncé’s Renaissance.\n\nRead more: How Christina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\" Made An Important Statement About Acceptance — For Society And Herself\n\nWhile her whole discography is full of bangers that have entered the queer pantheon, her latest release Renaissance is an ode to the queer and Black tradition of disco and house. Tracks like \"COZY,\" an embrace of being \"comfortable in my skin,\" quickly entered into heavy rotation at clubs around the world. Beyoncé has centered queer artists like Big Freedia, the queen of New Orleans bounce who wrote a powerful anthem in 2020’s \"Chasing Rainbows\" featuring Kesha (who herself named an album Rainbow and released \"We R Who We R\" after a series of suicides of gay teens across the U.S.).\n\nMost significantly, songs about the queer experience are now defining the careers of many artists and garnering them unprecedented large audiences. This is the case for MUNA with \"Silk Chiffon,\" King Princess with \"1950\" Troy Sivan with \"Bloom'' or even Sam Smith and Kim Petras with \"Unholy.\" This last sexy jam bought Petras unprecedented acclaim after years in the music industry and made her the first openly trans person to win a GRAMMY Award.\n\nThis trend might be most clearly seen in the rise of Little Nas X, who grew up mastering the language and codes of the internet before breaking through and quite quickly coming out. Geffen highlights how he uses shock to garner attention and push back against the homophobic haters, like giving Satan a lap dance in the music video \"MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name).\"\n\n\"I think of Little Nas X as a troll who trolled his way to the top,\" says Geffen,\" knowing what people will respond to positively and what will piss people off.\"\n\nContrasting this increase in openly queer anthems and depictions of queer people in media is a sharp political reality: anti-trans laws proliferate in many states and lawmakers attempt to limit the rights of LGBTQ+ people, threatening many of the forward momentum in queer liberation.\n\nRead more: The Rise Of The Queer Pop Star In The 2010s\n\nThis moment in social and political history highlights the importance of an anthem, which serves as a form of celebration and signaling of allegiance, as well as a salve against repression and motivation to continue the fight.\n\nOf course, this list of queer anthems is far from exhaustive. Artists as diverse as the B-52s, Eurythmics, the Pet Shop Boys, Elton John, Cher, George Michael, RuPaul, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, the Smiths, Kylie Minogue, Brandi Carlile, Carley Rae Jepsen, Sufjan Stevens, SOPHIE, Taylor Swift and many, many others have released music that has deeply impacted the queer community.\n\nAnd really, any song can be a queer anthem if it speaks to someone on a personal level, providing a sense of connection and belonging. As Geffen notes, the magic occurs when a piece of music creates a moment of collective celebration or momentary bliss.\n\n\"There's nothing else quite like that feeling of the physical release of having a song run through you when it's also running through tons of other people who are in the crowd with you,\" they said, highlighting the power of that anxiety of whether you fit in dissolving away: \"It opens a window into what's possible, in a world beyond the one we're in right now.\"\n\nQueer Christian Artists Keep The Faith: How LGBTQ+ Musicians Are Redefining Praise Music\n\nTo recognize the life of Florence Nightingale, the founder of the modern nursing profession and head British nurse during the Crimean War, the first National Nurses Week was observed from Oct. 11–16 in 1954, marking the 100th anniversary of Nightingale's mission to Crimea. This celebratory week was officially proclaimed by President Richard M. Nixon in 1974, and in 1981, May 6 was sanctioned National Recognition Day For Nurses.\n\nIn 1990 the American Nurses Association Board of Directors expanded the holiday into a weeklong celebration beginning May 6 and ending on May 12 — Nightingale's birthday.\n\nAs one of the nation's largest healthcare-related events, this week recognizes the contributions and commitments nurses make and educates the public on the significant work they perform. It may not be a cure for the common cold, but in honor of these notable nurses mentioned below, and nurses everywhere, we present our healing GRAMMY playlist.\n\n**\"Help!\"**\n\nThe Beatles, GRAMMY Hall Of Fame, 2008\n\nIf there was ever a nurse who offered a little help, it was British nurse Edith Cavell. During World War I she was known for helping all soldiers, but achieved everlasting fame for helping Allied soldiers escape from Belgium. The Beatles didn't need much help, as \"Help!\" reached No. 1 on both sides of the Atlantic in 1965.\n\n\"Survivor\" (iTunes>)\n\nDestiny's Child, Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal, 2001\n\nIn this GRAMMY-winning song the ladies of Destiny's Child vow to never give up or stop, promising to work harder. Clara Barton must have made this same vow when she found herself on a short vacation in Europe due to the toll that helping soldiers of the Civil War's First Battle of Bull Run took on her health. She eventually became the founder and first president of the American Red Cross, which was established May 21, 1881, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I Will Survive\" (iTunes>)\n\nGloria Gaynor, Best Disco Recording, 1979\n\nAs long as she knows how to love, Gaynor declares that she will survive. Mary Todd Lincoln, the wife of President Abraham Lincoln, showed her love and loyalty to the Union when she visited, fed and treated Union soldiers during the Civil War.\n\n\"Fever\" (iTunes>)\n\nPeggy Lee, GRAMMY Hall Of Fame, 1998\n\nHazel W. Johnson-Brown could likely cure the common fever and more when in 1979 she became the first African-American woman to achieve the rank of brigadier general in the U.S. Army. \"Fever\" was the right prescription for Lee, as it ascended to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1958.\n\n\"Breathe Again\" (iTunes>)\n\nToni Braxton, Best R&B Vocal Performance, 1994\n\nPioneering nurse Mary Breckinridge probably felt as if she could finally breathe again when she fled to Europe following World War I to join the American Committee for Devastated France after leaving her husband. After returning to the United States, she founded the Frontier Nursing Service in 1925. Braxton was able to breathe easy with \"Breathe Again\" picking up GRAMMY honors in 1994.\n\n\"Help Me Make It Through The Night\" (iTunes>)\n\nSammi Smith, Best Country Vocal Performance, Female, 1971\n\nIf there was ever a nurse, not just any nurse, who could help you make it through the night, it was Nightingale. In 1854 she traveled to Turkey, where she cared for wounded British soldiers and checked in on them at all hours of the night, earning her the nickname \"The Lady of the Lamp.\" \"Help Me Make It Through The Night,\" Smith's biggest hit, was written by fellow GRAMMY winner Kris Kristofferson.\n\n\"Healing Chant\" (iTunes>)\n\nNeville Brothers, Best Pop Instrumental Performance, 1989\n\nThe Neville Brothers' \"Healing Chant\" perhaps serves as an appropriate theme for nurse Jeanne Prentice, who is known for her work in protecting a mother's right to choose a licensed professional to supervise home births in South Dakota.\n\n\"Feel Good Inc.\" (iTunes>)\n\nGorillaz Featuring De La Soul, Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals, 2005\n\nIn her 1966 book The Nature Of Nursing, Virginia Avenel Henderson became famous for her formal definition of nursing: \"assisting individuals to gain independence in relation to the performance of activities contributing to health or its recovery.\" Henderson surely wanted to ensure that every patient of hers felt good, similar to the Gorillaz's musical intentions on the GRAMMY-winning \"Feel Good Inc.\"\n\n\"Doctor's Orders\" (iTunes>)\n\nAretha Franklin And Luther Vandross, Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal nominee, 1991\n\nIt must have been the doctor's orders that Mary Ezra Mahoney followed when she became the first African-American registered nurse. Mahoney also founded the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses in 1908, which eventually merged with the American Nurses Association between 1950 and 1951. Unfortunately for Franklin and Vandross, the doctor ordered a GRAMMY for Boyz II Men's Cooleyhighharmony album in 1991.\n\nThe Healer (iTunes>)\n\nJohn Lee Hooker, Best Traditional Blues Recording nominee, 1989\n\nSophie Mannerheim is known for her work in pioneering the modernizing of the nursing profession in Finland. In the early part of the 20th century, she worked as head nurse of the Helsinki Surgical Hospital and later became president of the Finnish Nurses Association. Though his album ultimately didn't make the grade, blues pioneer Hooker picked up a GRAMMY for Best Traditional Blues Recording in 1989 for his collaboration with Bonnie Raitt on \"I'm In The Mood.\"\n\n\"Sick, Sick, Sick\" (iTunes>)\n\nQueens Of The Stone Age, Best Hard Rock Performance nominee, 2007\n\nAmerican writer and poet Walt Whitman was sick, sick, sick when he read a story about wounded soldiers in Fredericksburg, Va., in 1863. The list included his brother's name and Whitman immediately took a train to Virginia where he worked as a volunteer nurse at more than 40 hospitals. Similarly, the Queens likely felt \"Sick, Sick, Sick\" when they lost, lost, lost to the Foo Fighters for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2007.\n\n\"Heartache Tonight\" (iTunes>)\n\nEagles, Best Rock Vocal Performance By A Duo Or Group, 1979\n\nIf there's going to be a heartache (or any type of ache), the first person you'd want around is a nurse, or Lillian Carter, the mother of President Jimmy Carter, who in 1966 dedicated her time as a Peace Corps volunteer in India. The Eagles were able to turn their heartache into GRAMMY gold in 1979.\n\nWhat song best typifies National Nurses Week to you? Or maybe one that makes you sick…. Drop us a comment and let us know.\n\nEarlier this month, on Music’s Biggest Night, Dua Lipa teleported us from our living rooms and yearlong quarantine to Studio 2054, her homage to New York City’s legendary Studio 54 nightclub where disco thrived from 1977–1980. In a stunning visual display entailing costume changes and dramatic dance interludes, Lipa performed two songs (“Levitating,” “Don’t Start Now”) from her GRAMMY-winning album, Future Nostalgia.\n\n“I wanted to do something that felt fresh and new,” Lipa told GRAMMY.com last year, “something that touched on a memory, something that always rings so true to me, especially in my childhood.” Her dancefloor inspiration was integral to the perfect storm that was a 2020 disco-pop revival, with artists like Doja Cat and Victoria Monet also trying on the groove for size and dancefloor veterans Jessie Ware, Róisín Murphy and Kylie Minogue showing us how it’s done.\n\nRelated: Jessie Ware On Returning To Her Dance Roots And Continuing To Learn\n\nThe success of these recent releases is validation for strong women vocalists who make dance hits spanning multiple decades, sounds and perspectives. Though the genre has evolved over the years, women singers remain a constant. And while they’re not always given their due, it’s their voices we remember, their lyrics we sing and their legacies we celebrate.\n\nDecades before Lipa was born, disco began as a musical movement of four-on-the-floor rhythms, deep synthesizers and lush melodies combining to create a sound for spaces in which Black, Latinx and queer audiences sought refuge and escape. What started underground made its way to the top of the charts and radio airwaves, thanks in large part to disco divas and their soul-stirring hooks.\n\nThe indisputable queen of them all was Donna Summer, who catapulted to international superstardom in the ‘70s with classics including the erotic epic “Love to Love You, Baby,” siren-like “I Feel Love” and the aptly steamy “Hot Stuff.” Together with GRAMMY-winning Italian producer Giorgio Moroder, she brought the sound of urban counterculture to middle America and beyond by simple musical seduction; her voice was warm and sensual, disguising disco’s radical message of liberation to unsuspecting listeners.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0h8Pjf4vNM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nRead: Kaskade Talks New 'Reset' EP, Executing Epic Fortnite Show, NFTs & More\n\n“This is it, look no further,” Brian Eno reportedly declared to David Bowie after hearing “I Feel Love” for the first time. “This single is going to change the sound of club music for the next 15 years.” It was an accurate prediction of Summer’s impact. A bona fide hit machine, she charted 32 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 (including four No. 1s) over the course of her career and nabbed 18 GRAMMY nominations, winning five.\n\nWhile “I Feel Love” radiated euphoria, Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive”—the first (and only) winner of the Best Disco Recording GRAMMY—was a timeless anthem for hard times. Its message transcended the era and also spoke to the moment. \"The problems that we shared during the day,” Gaynor said, “we came together in the evening, to overcome together, or to get away together, and one of the ways we came together was on the disco dancefloor.\"\n\nSister Sledge, Anita Ward, Thelma Houston and Cheryl Lynn each had disco hits of their own, cooing in sultry tones across mirrorball-lit dancefloors. But being a disco diva was about more than being a singer: they were powerful, fabulous and aspirational. Long after disco’s heyday, the legacy of their artistry lives on through new-school chanteuses like Lipa, Ware, Minogue and Murphy.\n\nThe party eventually came to an end, as disco’s ubiquity in the ‘70s prompted a racist backlash in 1979 that abruptly led to its mainstream downfall. After some time in obscurity, club hits came back with a vengeance in the ‘90s as dance music’s next evolution: house music.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/18N2k1TBBRE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nMartha Wash was the powerhouse voice behind two of the decade’s biggest hits, Black Box’s “Everybody Everybody” and C+C Music Factory’s “Everybody Dance Now (Gonna Make You Sweat).” Both songs, released in 1990, topped the Billboard Hot 100 and charted in the Top 10 internationally. While these achievements should have boosted Wash’s profile as an artist, the tracks’ producers had used her vocal recorded from studio demos without crediting her. Adding insult to injury, they cast other women to dance and lip-sync in Wash’s place for their music videos and live performances.\n\nLoleatta Holloway, a vocalist best known from her ‘70s disco hits (including “Hit and Run” and “Runaway” with The Salsoul Orchestra), had faced a similar situation the previous year when Black Box sampled her 1980 single “Love Sensation” without permission on their U.K. No. 1, “Ride on Time.” Believing they were entitled to both compensation and credit for their work, regardless of it being a sample or a demo, Wash and Holloway each successfully sued the artists and their respective labels, winning both credit and financial settlement. Wash’s victory was bigger than herself; it set a precedent enshrining that record labels are responsible for assigning proper vocal credit for all releases, regardless of how the vocal recording was made.\n\nAs Holloway and Wash were writing new rules for vocalists, a singer/songwriter named Crystal Waters was working a government job by day while writing her own club hits on the side. Her second single, “Gypsy Woman (She’s Homeless),” a socially conscious house track based on a true story, has a deceptively simple hook that burrows itself in your brain. Released in 1991, it was the first of Waters’ twelve No. 1 singles on Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart, including “100% Pure Love” and “What I Need.” Like fellow dance music singers Ultra Naté and CeCe Peniston, Waters took four-on-the-floor tracks to the next level with pop-structured lyrics that were cathartic, catchy and universally relatable.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQX2q6WCrbE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nRelated: Janet Jackson's Iconic 'Rhythm Nation 1814' Turns 30 Today & We Still Have Work To Do\n\nDuring this time, Madonna and Janet Jackson approached the dance charts from a pop perspective. Both known for their theatrical performance style and vocal prowess as much as for their versatility, they could drop a ballad one moment and a club-ready track the next, from Madonna’s “Vogue” and “Express Yourself” to Jackson’s “Rhythm Nation” and “Throb.” These expert shapeshifters paved the way for future chameleons like Lady Gaga, Britney Spears and Beyoncé, pop artists who stepped onto the dancefloor with tracks like “Born This Way,” “Till the World Ends” and “Run the World (Girls),” respectively.\n\nBeyoncé dabbled in dance music, but her Destiny’s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland opted for a fully immersive experience, reinventing herself as a solo artist with a fresh, pioneering sound. In 2008, producer David Guetta, a well-established club DJ in his native France, had recently cracked the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time with “Love is Gone” and was looking for a bigger and better sequel.\n\nThat summer, Rowland went clubbing in Cannes, France at the club where Guetta was DJing. She became particularly enamored with a track he played during his set, the instrumental version of what would become their 2009 collaboration “When Love Takes Over.” She asked to write and record vocals for it, the final result being a big-room serenade sweetened with his piano melody but commanded by her euphoric, heart-swelling chorus.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zudbz4hOcbc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n“When I finished producing it, we were like, ‘Wow, we have a monster hit,’” Guetta said in a 2009 interview. “We could feel that it was really, really big.” More than an anthem, “When Love Takes Over” was the launchpad for America’s EDM boom, a neon era of radio-friendly dance-pop that could also bang on club dancefloors and festival stages. The song topped 15 charts across 12 countries, including Billboard’s US Dance Club Songs, and was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 2010 GRAMMY Awards show.\n\nRihanna was also looking to take her music up a few BPMs after her 2009 album Rated R. Her first venture into EDM, 2010’s “Only Girl (In the World),” produced by Stargate and Sandy Vee, was a success, eventually winning Best Dance Recording at the 2011 GRAMMY Awards show. For her 2011 album Talk That Talk, Rihanna recruited Calvin Harris, a Scottish producer who had achieved critical acclaim and A-list studio sessions but who had yet to break through with a global hit. Harris produced two singles on the album: the winding, acid-electro house track “Where Have You Been” and “We Found Love,” on which Rihanna bares her vulnerable falsetto. They reunited for Harris’ massive summer hit (penned by Taylor Swift), “This Is What You Came For” in 2016.\n\nWatch: Ellie Goulding Talks Songwriting, Loving Skrillex & Björk & Growing Up On Electronic Music\n\nRowland’s relationship with Guetta, and Rihanna’s with Harris, was symbiotic. Rowland and Rihanna each became early adopters of a fire-blazing dance-pop phenomenon while Guetta and Harris got to increase their profiles with a new, large and lucrative American audience hungry for more. Hoping to find similar success, pop artists like Ariana Grande, Ellie Goulding and Kelis paired with Guetta, Harris, Zedd, Skrillex and more in the early 2010s. As dance music became more popular, the dynamic between producer and popstar shifted and producers became the popstars themselves, though a vocalist was usually not far behind.\n\nIn the current second-wave EDM era, where white men still sit at the top, Aluna has made it her mission to change how dance music perceives and treats women artists, especially Black women artists, asserting their importance even when it isn't obvious. “She’s there in the lyrics, she’s there in the voice, sometimes you see her in a video, but you don’t see her right there in the middle,” she told Billboard last year. “That’s really the shift we need to make.”\n\nAluna was best known to the world as one-half of electronic-pop outfit AlunaGeorge. Her cherubic vocals are instantly recognizable whether she’s singing on their own songs, such as “You Know You Like It” and “Attracting Flies,” or appearing on Disclosure’s “White Noise.”\n\nIn 2020, she made a huge statement by embarking on her solo career and releasing her debut album, Renaissance, that October. Tired of fielding daily requests from people who “wanted [her] voice, not [her] face. Not [her] Blackness,” Aluna made herself the record’s focal point as the main artist and producer rather than simply feature on different producers’ songs.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/sP0gfBWljU4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nRead More: Aluna On New Album 'Renaissance' & Making Dance Music Inclusive Again\n\nWhereas Aluna has beamed across radio airwaves worldwide, Anabel Englund has long been the voice of dance music’s underground. As a member of tech house supergroups Hot Natured and Pleasure State, the singer/songwriter’s smoldering tone and earworm melodies are the centerpiece of songs like “Electricity” and “Reverse Skydiving,” both of which she co-wrote.\n\nEnglund released her debut album, Messing With Magic, last October, and landed her first Billboard No. 1 on the Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart that same month with syrupy house chiller “Picture Us.” “Working with a group, I have to share my energy as part of a whole,” she said. “Being on my own, I’m able to harness my energy into what I have to say.” Like Aluna, Englund assumed co-production duties on the album in addition to singing and songwriting. Her former bandmates make appearances throughout while she remains the marquee name, never being overshadowed.\n\nA more recent arrival to the scene, Lipa dabbled in dance music before diving headlong into Future Nostalgia’s disco-inspired sounds, including on her 2017 self-titled debut album (“Hotter Than Hell,” “New Rules”). In 2018, she collaborated with Harris and Silk City (Diplo and Mark Ronson), respectively, on the ‘90s-house-influenced hits “One Kiss” and “Electricity.” The latter song won Best Dance Recording at the 2019 GRAMMY Awards show and in a big look for dance music, Lipa performed “One Kiss” during the main ceremony. To cap the night, she also won the GRAMMY for Best New Artist. Between house and disco, Lipa has provided two of dance music’s foundational genres a massive revitalized platform in the pop world.\n\nLong after disco’s prime, Summer’s captivating artistry lives on in chanteuses like Lipa. Meanwhile, the voices and lyrics of Aluna and Englund pick up where Crystal Waters left off, and Wash and Holloway’s legacy can be heard in a new generation of house music divas like Karen Harding, Alex Mills and Kaleena Zanders. Just like Lipa showed on the GRAMMYs stage, each of these singers proves that the women on dance records are capable and deserving of the spotlight, hopefully always getting brighter than the ones that shone on the many women before them.\n\nThe Women Essential To Reggae And Dancehall"
