        "text": "Many aspects define a great song, including a special opening phrase or line. Some are downright legendary. Here are 25 of the greatest opening lyrics of all time.\n\n1 of 30\n\n\"Blue Suede Shoes\" by Elvis Presley (1956)\n\nJoe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal via Imagn Content Services, LLC/USA TODAY\n\n\"Well, it's one for the money, two for the show. Three to get ready now go, cat, go.\"\n\nThe legendary words of Carl Perkins, and obviously this intro, made Elvis Presley star. As legend has it, Johnny Cash encouraged Perkins to write a song about a military airman who referred to the issued footwear as \"Blue Suede Shoes.\" When it came time for the opening lines, Perkins approached it as a nursery rhyme and thought of \"One for the Money.\" The rest, as they say, is history.\n\n2 of 30\n\n\"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon & Garfunkel (1965)\n\nTheo Wargo/WireImage/Getty Images\n\n\"Hello darkness, my old friend / I've come to talk with you again.\"\n\nWhile reportedly in his early 20s, Paul Simon's penchant for writing songs with his guitar in the dark led to the opening lines to one of the great pop songs of all time. The song's overall meaning has been a mystery over the years, but hearing something as simple as playing guitar in a quiet room with the lights off seems like a downer. Great, nonetheless.\n\n3 of 30\n\n\"The End\" by Doors (1967)\n\nMark and Colleen Hayward/Getty Images\n\n\"This is the end / Beautiful friend / This is the end / My only friend, the end.\"\n\nJim Morrison had said often he wasn't sure what exactly he was saying \"goodbye\" to when writing this song. It's a haunting piece — from its simple yet emotional beginning to a maddening and somewhat frightening climax. The track earned a resurgence in popularity for its symbolic use in the opening scene of Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Vietnam War classic Apocalypse Now.\n\n4 of 30\n\n\"All Along the Watchtower\" by Bob Dylan/The Jimi Hendrix Experience (1968)\n\nHelen Comer/DNJ/USA TODAY\n\n\"'There must be some kind of way outta here' / Said the joker to the thief.\"\n\nThis was Bob Dylan's song, but the version done by Jimi Hendrix and his band is more widely recognized. Dylan loves to tell stories through his music. \"All Along the Watchtower\" is a conversational song in many ways. Opening with a quote is rather unique. Hendrix, meanwhile, added more emotion and plenty of amplification to make it a massive hit.\n\n5 of 30\n\n\"Sympathy for the Devil\" by Rolling Stones (1968)\n\nMichael Chow/The Republic, Arizona Republic via Imagn Content Services, LLC/USA TODAY\n\n\"Please allow me to introduce myself / I'm a man of wealth and taste / I've been around for a long, long year / Stole many a man's soul and faith.\"\n\nWhen telling a story from Satan's perspective, it's important to offer a proper introduction. Rock fans have never forgotten the one given by the Rolling Stones. There are songs we know will be special from the opening words, and this is one of them. We can argue for days if this is the Stones' greatest musical effort, but we should agree these might be the most memorable opening words to any song.\n\n6 of 30\n\n\"Joy to the World\" by Three Dog Night (1970)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"Jeremiah was a bullfrog.\"\n\nThough not every band member liked the song upon presentation, Three Dog Night eventually had fun with this beloved classic written by folk legend Hoyt Axton. The band has referred to it as a \"kid's song.\" Chuck Negron's opening proclamation is one of the most memorable lines in music history. The tune hit No. 1 on the Billboard chart in 1971.\n\n7 of 30\n\n\"Let it Be\" by the Beatles (1970)\n\nthe Beatles\n\n\"When I find myself in times of trouble / Mother Mary comes to me / Speaking words of wisdom / Let it be.\"\n\nIt's tough to choose from the Beatles' countless notable opening lines. But this seems to be the most prophetic and poignant. Paul McCartney has stated that the \"Mother Mary\" reference is to a dream he had of his late mother during a particularly tough time in his tenure with the band.\n\n8 of 30\n\n\"The Joker\" by Steve Miller Band (1973)\n\nSteve Miller Band\n\n\"Some people call me the space cowboy, yeah / Some call me the gangster of love /\n\nSome people call me Maurice / 'Cause I speak of the pompatus of love.\"\n\nIn addition to being one of the more underappreciated musicians of his time, Miller had fun with his music. That's the case with \"The Joker,\" with reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. This opening references some of Miller's past songs and also enjoyed fame off the stage. Remember what Joey Tribbiani's imaginary friend's name and profession were?\n\n9 of 30\n\n“Thunder Road\" by Bruce Springsteen (1975)\n\nDavid Gahr/Shore Fire Media, Asbury Park Press via Imagn Content Services, LLC/USA TODAY\n\n\"The screen door slams / Mary's dress sways / Like a vision, she dances across the porch as the radio plays.\"\n\nLike Bob Dylan, one of his idols, Springsteen fancied himself a poetic storyteller. That eventually became undeniable on the Born to Run record. These are the detailed and dramatic opening lines of the album. And while the metaphorical screen door slammed, the door was now open for the Boss to reach the stardom he desired.\n\n10 of 30\n\n\"Blitzkrieg Bop\" by Ramones (1976)\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n\"Hey ho, let's go!\"\n\nFor many pop music fans, this chant defines the Ramones. The group was animated in its persona and attitude, and these words play along with the act while defining American punk rock within the mainstream, even if that's not necessarily the case. In any regard, this basic fist-pumping mantra is highly unforgettable.\n\n11 of 30\n\n\"Hotel California\" by Eagles (1977)\n\nEagles\n\n\"On a dark desert highway / Cool wind in my hair / Warm smell of colitas / Rising up through the air.\"\n\n\"Hotel California\" relates to a journey. These famous opening lines begin that journey into a world unlike any other in America. The dramatic first impressions of Don Henley and Glenn Frey upon driving into Los Angeles for the first time set the stage perfectly.\n\n12 of 30\n\n\"Stayin' Alive\" by Bee Gees (1977)\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n\"Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk / I'm a woman's man, no time to talk.\"\n\nIt was a No. 1 Billboard hit off the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack and remains one of defining songs of the disco era. This famed opening pretty much sums up the character of Tony Manero (John Travolta), or at least the persona he puts out while walking down the street holding a can of paint.\n\n13 of 30\n\n\"I Will Survive\" by Gloria Gaynor (1978)\n\nRobert Hanashiro/USA TODAY via Imagn Content Services, LLC\n\n\"At first I was afraid, I was petrified / Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side / But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong / And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along.\"\n\nOne of the great female empowerment songs and a No. 1 Billboard hit during the disco era. This intro sums up the general theme of a song about moving on from a difficult breakup, even when said ex comes back into her life.\n\n14 of 30\n\n“Werewolves of London\" by Warren Zevon (1978)\n\nPaul Natkin/Getty Images\n\n\"I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand / Walking through the streets of SoHo in the rain / He was looking for the place called Lee Hō Foōk's / Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein.\"\n\nWhile legend tends to state that Zevon had to be coaxed into writing the song and initially did not want it released as the first single off his stellar Excitable Boy record, it's always been a fun romp that never took itself too seriously. That was the point. And it remains a classic.\n\n15 of 30\n\n\"Renegade\" by Styx (1979)\n\nSarah Kloepping/USA TODAY NETWORK\n\n\"Oh, Mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law.\"\n\nGuitarist Tommy Shaw wrote one of Styx's biggest hits (a favorite of Pittsburgh Steelers fans at home games). He's also the lone voice heard, speaking these words as the song's subject, humbly knowing his time on the run could end. His words lead into a strong classic rock track.\n\n16 of 30\n\n\"You Shook Me All Night Long\" by AC/DC (1980)\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n\"She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean / She was the best damn woman that I ever seen.\"\n\nWith Brian Johnson debuting on vocals, AC/DC's unabashed celebration of a wild night of passion, filled with the expected sexual innuendos the band was known for, remains one of the great rock songs. It's one of the more upbeat tracks on Back in Black, the band's tribute to late singer Bon Scott. The song also has a history of controversy, with those close to Scott alleging some of the lyrics were his, though he's not given any writing credit.\n\n17 of 30\n\n\"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey (1981)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world / She took the midnight train goin' anywhere / Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit / He took the midnight train goin' anywhere.\"\n\nWe're actually talking about the entire first verse, but since \"Don't Stop Believin'\" enjoyed a resurgence in the mid-2000s thanks to the Chicago White Sox's run to the 2005 World Series title and the TV show Glee, it's worth the space.\n\n18 of 30\n\n\"Let's Go Crazy\" by Prince and The Revolution (1984)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"Dearly beloved / We are gathered here today / To get through this thing called \"life.\"\n\nTalk about a flair for the dramatic. Not many did it better than Prince. So, it was no wonder pop-rock fans in the 1980s ate up this church organ-like intro from a highlight on the Purple Rain album and movie soundtrack. Prince had many memorable musical moments and notable lines, but this stands tall above the rest.\n\n19 of 30\n\n\"Summer of '69\" by Bryan Adams (1985)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"I got my first real six-string / Bought it at the five-and-dime / Played it till my fingers bled / Was the summer of '69.\"\n\nBryan Adams enjoyed massive success with his Reckless album, anchored by this up-tempo pop-rocker that reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. That memorable opening riff and these words got the ball rolling and took us on a musical trip through a song that had nothing to do with the actual year 1969.\n\n20 of 30\n\n\"Your Love\" by The Outfield (1986)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"Josie's on a vacation far away.\"\n\nThe Outfield enjoyed its day in the sun with a tune that still holds some weight when talking about the new wave/pop sound of the 1980s. Of course, MTV helped, too, by keeping the video in regular rotation for a spell.\n\n21 of 30\n\n\"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\" by R.E.M. (1987)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"That's great, it starts with an earthquake / Birds and snakes, an aeroplane / Lenny Bruce is not afraid.\"\n\nAnd with these opening words, Michael Stipe was off and running on his pop culture stream of consciousness. The song's pace is non-stop, but the mention of Lenny Bruce to start is memorable, even if those singing along have no idea who the comedian/satirist was or why he mattered.\n\n22 of 30\n\n\"Sweet Child o' Mine\" by Guns N' Roses (1987)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"She's got a smile that it seems to me / Reminds me of childhood memories / Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky.\"\n\nGuns' frontman Axl Rose wrote the lyrics to one of the band's biggest hits while dating Erin Everly (daughter of Don Everly from the Everly Brothers fame). It was the most endearing track on the group's otherwise dark, gritty, brutally honest, and raw debut Appetite for Destruction.\n\n23 of 30\n\n\"Bring the Noise\" by Public Enemy (1988)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"Bass! How low can you go? Death row? What a brother knows.\"\n\nWhether talking about this original version from PE or the popular collaboration with thrash gods Anthrax, there might not be a more emphatic opening line in rap or hip-hop than the one spewed on this track. From there, Chuck D's rhymes flow freely as he and Flavor Flav preach how rap is a new force on the popular music scene.\n\n24 of 30\n\n\"Straight Outta Compton\" by N.W.A. (1988)\n\nN.W.A.\n\n\"Straight outta Compton / Crazy motherf—er named Ice Cube / From the gang called N—s With Attitudes.\"\n\nIf we want to get technical, Dr. Dre leads into the song by speaking: \"You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge.\" Then, it's Ice Cube who delivers the opening rap and introduces the music world to N.W.A — with all its graphic and honest depiction of life on the deadly streets of Southern California. N.W.A. lays the blueprint for the gangster rap genre to take off.\n\n25 of 30\n\n\"Mama Said Knock You Out\" by LL Cool J (1991)\n\nJeremy Brevard/USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years.\"\n\nThe album-buying public and some music critics might have felt LL's rap career was on the downside. However, he didn't think so, and this was his answer to those ready to write him off. He drew inspiration for the track from his grandma, who told him not to succumb to the naysayers and prove that he still had what it took to succeed.\n\n26 of 30\n\n\"Dancing on My Own\" by Robyn (2010)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"Somebody said you got a new friend / Does she love you better than I can?\"\n\nOne of the great modern-day anthems of jilted love. Plus, it's easy to dance to and still gets a club riled up to this day. Regardless which version we're talking (electo or synth pop), \"Dancing on My Own\" is certainly a standout moment for Robyn. And, one that has stood well over the years. Wasting no time in questioning the object of her affection, she wants answers. And wants them now. A multi-platinum hit in seven countries, and one that received a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording.\n\n27 of 30\n\n\"Born This Away\" by Lady Gaga (2011)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M.\"\n\nOne of Gaga's most beloved and expressive tracks, \"Born This Away\" states its purpose from the very beginning, and does not stop. She noted on azlyrics.com: \"I want to write my this-is-who-the-#@!-I-am anthem, but I don't want it to be hidden in poetic wizardry and metaphors.\" It does not matter who one loves, just that they love them as much as possible, without listening to, or being harassed by, anybody who thinks otherwise. More than a decade later, that belief might be important now more than ever.\n\n28 of 30\n\n\"Hello\" by Adele (2015)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"Hell, it's me.\"\n\nStraight and to the point. Adele doesn't have the heart to get wordy when it comes to dealing with a lost love. Especially on that she seems to want back. There are plenty of honest and human moments on the superstar artist's celebrated piece. And, it starts with her trying to go back to when times are good, and lovers could take each other for granted with a simple form of hello. From her third studio album, 25, the song proved Adele was one of the great voices of our time, and the tune won Grammys for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance\n\n29 of 30\n\n\"Levitating\" (featuring DaBaby) by Dua Lipa (2020)\n\nYouTube\n\n\"If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy / And I can take you for a ride.\"\n\nA poppy, dance-love song, with a space-age/disco vibe, and including a cameo from a popular rapper. Leave it to the creatively talented Dua Lipa to come up with a unique approach for an up-beat track, complete with a rather fun opening lyric. Interpret it anyway one wants, but this is one of the better beginnings to a song, that's a rocket ship ride of fun, in recent years. From her second studio album Future Nostalgia, \"Levitating\" reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 and won Top Radio Song at the Billboard Music Awards.\n\n30 of 30\n\n\"A&W\" by Lana Del Rey (2023)\n\nBryon Houlgrave/The Register, Des Moines Register via Imagn Content Services, LLC/USA TODAY\n\n\"I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine / I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time.\"\n\nThere's been a lot of good stuff released in 2023. And, while it might be a stretch to call any opening line iconic from the year, Del Rey has a contender with the beginning to this rather dark and emotional track from her ninth studio album Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd. It's quite gripping right off the bat. Checking in a little over 7 minutes in length, the song features two parts. The opening of the ballad has a folk vibe, with groveling, conversational lyrics from the artist, who continues to astound when it comes to her overall talent as a writer and performer.\n\nA Chicago native, Jeff Mezydlo has professionally written about sports, entertainment and pop culture for parts of four decades.
