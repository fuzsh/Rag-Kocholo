        "text": "Gloria continues to tirelessly tour the world performing at concerts in the USA, Europe, South America, and beyond each year. She was a presenter at the 2015 GRAMMY’s and the headliner at the 2015 “Official GRAMMY Celebration.” CCU’s Women in Leadership Conference honored Gloria in early 2015 with their “Celebration of Inspiring Women” Award for her philanthropic and leadership achievements and contributions. On May 16th, 2015 Dowling College presented Gloria with an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Music.\n\nNo stranger to television, Gloria has made guest appearances on Ally McBeal, The Wayans Bros., and That ‘70s Show. She was a featured guest on the premiere episode of Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris and most recently Gloria was a guest on the DR. OZ Show. She also opened up the 2016 UK National Television Awards at the O2 Arena with a performance that had the entire audience on their feet giving Gloria a standing ovation. Also in 2016, Gloria was presented by Ido Aharoni (Consul General of Israel), with the “Martin Luther King Jr Award” acknowledging those who have gone above and beyond to inspire others. And in March 2016, Gloria’s recording of, “I Will Survive,” was inducted into the Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry, preserving sound recordings with great cultural and historic importance to the U.S.\n\nGloria’s 2​nd​ book, We Will Survive: True Stories of Encouragement, Inspiration, and the Power of Song, was a 2015 GRAMMY nominee for Best Spoken Word Album. The remarkable stories in this book reveal that the song, “I Will Survive,” has reached people from all walks of life and touched them in thousands of unique ways. From individuals triumphing over illness to those suffering from the painful loss of a loved one to others piecing their lives together after bearing witness to a national tragedy, “I Will Survive,” has become an emotional anthem for them and for millions of Gloria’s adoring fans around the world. “‘I Will Survive’ is my mantra, the core of my God-given purpose,'” Gaynor said in a statement. “It is my privilege and honor to use it to inspire people around the world of every nationality, race, creed, color and age group to join me as I sing and live the words: ‘I Will Survive.’”\n\n2017 finds Gloria finishing a new album of inspirational songs entitled, “Testimony.” She has spent time in Nashville over the past three years co-writing and collaborating with GRAMMY nominated CCM songwriters and producers such as Yolanda Adams, Melinda Doolittle, Christopher Stevens, Bart Millard from MercyMe, Jason Crabb, and Mike Farris.\n\nGloria is being honored by the Library of Congress on May 6th after having her recording of her global anthem, “I Will Survive,” inducted in the libraries collection of recordings with American historical & cultural significance in 2016. She will be part of an “In Conversation” with fellow survivor, Robin Roberts from Good Morning America, in the Coolidge Theater in the afternoon. And in the evening Gloria will deliver a concert to end all concerts in the Thomas Jefferson Building’s Great Hall. Both events sold out in one minute after going on sale earlier this Spring."
