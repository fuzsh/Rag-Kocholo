        "text": "Not only is Gloria Gaynor surviving, she's thriving.\n\nThe Jersey music legend is nominated for two Grammy Awards. Her LP “Testimony” is nominated for Best Roots Gospel Album and the album track, “Talkin’ Bout Jesus” with Yolanda Adams, is up for Best Gospel Performance/Song.\n\nThe Grammys will air 8 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 26, on CBS.\n\n“Being nominated for two Grammys is really quite exciting for me and it’s kind of a stamp of approval of what I’ve been doing and where I’ve been trying to go and where I’ve been trying to bring my audience,” Gaynor said. “It's saying, 'Yes, you’re on the right track.' And not only that but 'You're doing a good job of it.' So it’s very exciting for me.”\n\n[ Subscribe to the Asbury Park Press and download the app for the latest on the Jersey music scene. ]\n\nGaynor's track leads to the Lord. “Testimony” is a contemporary gospel album.\n\n“This is something I’ve been wanting to do for years but my management, my husband was my manager, he was concerned with doing what he considered successful and didn’t feel he could do it with gospel music,” Gaynor said. “He kept putting me off, putting it off, promising me we’re going to do it, and then after my divorce and I got new management, we decided to do it. And it turns out it’s God’s timing anyway.”\n\nGaynor rolled up her sleeves and got to work. She co-wrote most of the songs and kept the groove steady. On the surface, “Testimony,” sounds like a stellar R&B album.\n\n[ Looking for the trusted place to find the best home service providers?

And when I went back into music, 'OK, what am I supposed to do now? Do you want me to just do gospel music?’ ” Gaynor said. “It became, ‘I want you to go back and sing to the same people you’ve been singing to all along.’ ”\n\nThe return of America's sweetheart: Whitney Houston in Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\nGaynor, a Newark native who now lives in Green Brook, became the Queen of Disco in the 1970s thanks to classics like “Never Can Say Goodbye” and “I Will Survive.”\n\n“I Will Survive” went to the top of the charts in 1979 and has since became an anthem of resiliency, hope and life. Groups as diverse as breast-cancer survivors to the French 1998 World Cup-winning soccer team claim “Survive” as their anthem.\n\nFugees: Ready or not, why we think it's time for NJ hip-hop legends to reunite\n\nOther Jersey Grammy nominations, and there are a few, include the Jonas Brothers of Wyckoff, whose comeback single “Sucker” received a Best Pop Duo/Group Performance notice.\n\nJack Antonoff, a native of New Milford and Hillsdale and a member of Fun and Bleachers, picked up three Grammy nominations for production and songwriting on Lana Del Rey’s hit album, “Norman (Blanking) Rockwell!”\n\nNija Charles, 22 of Union, has four Grammy noms. She's received recognition for co-writing Chris Brown and Drake’s “No Guidance,” 21 Savage’s “I Am > I Was,” Meek Mill’s “Championships” and Beyonce’s “My Power.”\n\nShe's previously won two Grammys.\n\nSea.Hear.Now: Early bird tickets set to go on sale\n\nPerennial R&B hitmaker Rodney Jerkins of Pleasantville, aka Darkchild, received two big nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, thanks to his role on H.E.R.’s single, “Hard Place.”\n\nRobert Santelli, the Point Pleasant Beach native whose credits include curating “In Performance at the White House” concert series for President Barack Obama, is nominated for Best Historical Album for “Pete Seeger: The Smithsonian Folkways Collection” with Jeff Place and Pete Reiniger.\n\nIt’s Santelli’s second Grammy nomination.\n\nR&B ingénue Lizzo has the most nominations with eight for her major-label debut album, “Cuz I Love You,” and her hit single, “Truth Hurts.” Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X each picked up six noms.\n\nBarefoot Country Music Fest: Carrie Underwood first headliner of new Jersey Shore festival\n\nThe awards will be hosted by Alicia Keys and performers include Aerosmith, Camila Cabello, Eilish, Ariana Grande, H.E.R., Jonas Brothers, Lizzo, Demi Lovato, Rosalía, Run-D.M.C, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Tyler the Creator and Charlie Wilson.

She's headlining, with Cheap Trick, the 2020 Grammy Celebration after-party at the Los Angeles Convention Center after the awards show. She's also stopping by Clive Davis and the Recording Academy's Pre-Grammy gala. Gaynor and Davis go back a ways — Davis signed Gaynor to Columbia Records in 1975.\n\n'Your priorities change': Jon Bon Jovi talks giving back after opening third JBJ Soul Kitchen\n\nShe's a survivor. Part of her new outlook includes a successful operation to relieve the pain of a decades-long back injury.\n\n“I’ve had my ups and downs,” said Gaynor, 70. “I’ve had to sing 'I Will Survive' a few times to myself. We all go through things, that’s why the song is so popular because we all go through things that we think are insurmountable and we hope we will survive. God has been good and I’m in a great place right now.”\n\nRecord of the Year\n\n“Hey, Ma” by Bon Iver\n\n“Bad Guy” by Billie Eilish\n\n“7 Rings” by Ariana Grande\n\n“Hard Place” by H.E.R.\n\n“Talk” by Khalid\n\n“Old Town Road” by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus\n\n“Truth Hurts” by Lizzo\n\n“Sunflower” by Post Malone and Swae Lee\n\nAlbum of the Year\n\n“I,I” by Bon Iver\n\n“Norman (blank) Rockwell!” by Lana Del Rey\n\n“When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” by Billie Eilish\n\n“Thank U, Next” by Ariana Grande\n\n“I Used to Know Her” by H.E.R.\n\n“7” by Lil Nas X\n\n“Cuz I Love You (Deluxe)” by Lizzo\n\n“Father of the Bride” by Vampire Weekend\n\nSong of The Year\n\n“Always Remember Us This Way,” Natalie Hemby, Lady Gaga, Hillary Lindsey and Lori McKenna songwriters (Lady Gaga)\n\n“Bad Guy,” Billie Eilish O'Connell and Finneas O'Connell songwriters (Billie Eilish)\n\n“Bring My Flowers Now,” Brandi Carlile, Phil Hanseroth, Tim Hanseroth and Tanya Tucker songwriters (Tanya Tucker)\n\n“Hard Place,” Ruby Amanfu, Sam Ashworth, D.
