        "text": "Early life\n\nHarry was brought up in the beautiful village of Holmes Chapel in Cheshire, 21 miles south of Manchester. Harry's mum is Anne Cox, his dad is Des Styles, and his stepdad was Robin Twist who sadly passed away in 2017. Harry's sister Gemma is three years older than him, and works as a model and journalist, and their step-brother Mike Twist is Robin's son from a previous relationship.\n\n2010: The X Factor\n\nHarry auditioned for the seventh series of The X Factor as a solo artist, singing a version of Steve Wonder's 'Isn't She Lovely'. Harry made it to Boot Camp on his own but failed to make it to Judges' Houses. Therefore, he and four other boys who didn't make the cut were put together as a group - and the rest is history!\n\nHarry, along with Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik reached the final of The X Factor as One Direction and finished in third place.\n\n2011-2015: One Direction – the world’s biggest boyband\n\nAfter releasing their first single 'That's What Makes You Beautiful' back in 2011, the boys quickly started to take over the world. Harry and the 1D boys went on to enjoy huge success, winning over 200 awards including seven BRIT Awards and four MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nOne Direction achieved four UK Number 1 albums and one Top 5 album throughout their time together, along with four UK Number 1 singles and five UK Top 10 singles which spent an incredible 56 weeks in the Top 10 from 2011-2015. Harry and the 1D boys released four albums as a five-piece - 'Up All Night', 'Take Me Home', 'Midnight Memories' and 'Four'.\n\n2015: One Direction's extended hiatus\n\nIn 2015, Zayn announced he was leaving the band and Harry, Niall, Louis and Liam made the decision to carry on as a four-piece.

This album showed a new side of the star that fans had not seen during his One Direction days as the record was made up of soft rock tracks. Harry then released two more singles, 'Two Ghosts' and 'Kiwi' from the album.\n\nHarry also released a documentary about the making of his album in 2017. Entitled Harry Styles: Behind the Album, the 50-minute film showed a behind-the-scenes look at Harry's recording process.
