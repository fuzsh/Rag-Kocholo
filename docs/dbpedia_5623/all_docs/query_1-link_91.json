        "text": "When I was eight growing up in Los Angeles, I remember the first rock n’ roll radio station, KFWB—Channel 98. The jingle sticks in my mind. There was this song about a race car driver whose car crashed during a race. As he lay there on the track dying, he said, “Tell Laura I Love Her.” This song had such an impact on me as a young girl. Ever since then I have wanted to compose and sing to express my feelings. I began singing in choir from elementary school onward. The first band I sang with was the Funktionaries in 1980. Then, in 1984, I formed Wanda and The Way It Is and started composing songs for the band, singing lead. We played our first gig at the Homestead and our second gig at the Canoe Place Inn in East Hampton one 4th of July weekend, opening for Martha Reeves. Three years later, after performing all over Manhattan, Bobby Gossin signed us to Island Record’s, 4th & Broadway label in l987. As a band leader, I strive for a rhythm section like James Brown’s, and a horn section that speaks for itself. Vocal influences for me are Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, and the Pointer Sisters.\n\njlaing97@gmail.com\n\nDionne McClain-Freeney is a pianist, composer, singer, choral director, and teaching artist.
