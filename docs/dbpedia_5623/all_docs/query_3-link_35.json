This is an inspiring comeback for a woman who sings passionately and never lost momentum.\n\nIt was 40 years ago that the world-renowned singer, Gloria Gaynor, won her first Grammy Award for her classic empowerment anthem, “I Will Survive.” She became an icon for empowerment and survival, celebrated and sung around the world. Gaynor, who was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame in 2005, was also inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nGloria Gaynor’s legendary career spans the past 40 years. She has achieved global stardom and musical recognition with hit songs in the charts in all four decades. Gloria has channeled her fame and recognition into support for several charities, donating not only her money but also her time and talent. She changed the lyrics to her world-renowned song and lent her time to a corresponding music video used by the Miami Children’s Hospital to raise awareness and funds for their lifesaving efforts.\n\nNever one to rest, Gaynor recently earned a bachelor’s degree in behavioral sciences to aid in her work with charities and organizations helping at-risk youths and their families.\n\nGaynor continues to tirelessly tour the world performing at concerts in the USA, Europe, South America, and beyond, each year. She was a presenter at the 2015 Grammy’s and the headliner at the 2015 “Official Grammy Celebration.” The CCU’s Women in Leadership conference honored Gloria in early 2015 with their “Celebration of Inspiring Women” Award for her philanthropic and leadership achievements and contributions. On May 16, 2015, Dowling College presented Gaynor with an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Music.\n\nGaynor was also honored by the Library of Congress on May 6, 2017, after having her recording of her global anthem, “I Will Survive,” inducted in the Library’s Collection of Recordings with American historical and cultural significance in 2016. She was part of an “In Conversation” with fellow survivor, Robin Roberts, from “Good Morning, America,” in the Coolidge Theater in Washington, DC, followed by a concert in the Thomas Jefferson Building’s Great Hall.\n\nNo stranger to TV, Gaynor has made appearances on “Ally McBeal,” “The Wayans Brothers,” and “That 70’s Show.”\n\nShe was a featured guest on the premier episode of “Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris” and, most recently, Gaynor was a guest on the “Dr. Oz “ show in NYC and the “Dr. Phil” show in L.A. She also opened up the 2016 UK National Television Awards at the O2 Arena with a performance that had the entire audience on their feet, giving Gloria a standing ovation. Additionally, Gaynor was presented by Ido Aharoni (Consul General of Israel), with the Martin Luther King Jr. Award,” acknowledging those who have gone above and beyond to inspire others.\n\nGaynor was inducted into the NJ Hall of Fame at a special ceremony in Asbury Park, NJ in 2017.\n\nGaynor’s second book, We Will Survive: True Stories of Encouragement, Inspiration, and the Power of Song, was a 2015 Grammy Nominee for Best Spoken Word Album. Forty remarkable stories in this book reveal that the song, “I Will Survive,” has reached people from all walks of life and touched them in thousands of unique ways. From individuals triumphing over illness to suffering from the loss of a loved one, to patching their lives together after bearing witness to a national tragedy, “I Will Survive” has become an emotional anthem for them and for millions of Gaynor’s adoring fans around the world. Gaynor said, “I Will Survive is my mantra, the core of my God-given purpose. It is my privilege and honor to use it to inspire people around the world, of every nationality, race, creed or color and age group to join me as I sing and live the words: ‘I Will Survive.’ ”\n\nGaynor is proud of her new album of inspirational songs entitled, “Testimony,” released in 2020. It instantly became a Billboard Top Five gospel Album in its first week. She recorded it in Nashville over the past three years, co-writing and recording with multiple Grammy and Dove Award winning songwriters/producers F. Reid Shippan and Chris Stevens. This year, Gaynor has been featured on the Today Show, CBS Sunday morning, Rolling Stone, People, Closer and Women’s World Magazines and WXPN’s program, “World Café.”"
