        "text": "Jo Harrop is one of the most popular jazz singers in the UK. The Durham-born singer-songwriter spent several years as a backing singer, performing with the likes of Neil Diamond, Gloria Gaynor and Enrique Iglesias, before getting a record deal as a solo artist. She has earned praise from the likes of Iggy Pop for her vocals and her latest album, The Path Of A Tear, came out in June. Here, Jo talks about her story…\n\nWhat can you tell us about your new album, The Path Of A Tear?\n\nSome people have described it as being a bit like Americana and I knew it would have this mellow kind of sound. It’s not a typical jazz album, it’s got those roots of blues, folk and a little bit of pop.\n\nThe album is produced by the legendary Larry Klein, who has worked with big names such as Joni Mitchell, Madeleine Peyroux and Nora Jones. What was it like working with him?\n\nWhen you think of the people he’s worked with and who he’s produced it was pretty nerve-wracking sending him songs that I’d written. But he put me totally at ease and was very complimentary about my songwriting which meant the most to me, because it’s one thing to be able to sing a song, it’s another to feel you can write a good song. So that was mind-blowingly reassuring.\n\nThere are three covers on the album, what can you tell us about them?\n\nThere’s Leonard Cohen, Steve Earle and one by Leon Russell as well. These are songs that meant something to Larry as well. I think the Leon Russell one was recorded in the same studio as we recorded in the Village [in LA]. Leonard Cohen was a really close friend of Larry’s and Travelling Light is something he thought would really work, and the Steve Earle one is just so moving and so beautiful. I think they work with all the original songs on the album.\n\nYou played in the Spiegeltent at Harrogate Music Festival in 2022. What are your memories of that?\n\nIt was a stunning venue. I’d never even been in a spiegeltent before – I walked in and was like ‘wow, this is going to be an experience.’ I had such a great response from the audience when I played there, I remember it well. Harrogate’s a beautiful town and there’s a lovely energy to it and I remember the sun was shining when I played there last time.\n\nWhere did your passion for singing come from?\n\nI was a very shy and quiet child so why I wanted to put myself on stage in front of people I don’t know. But I listened to pop music all the time, people like Whitney Houston, and I’d learn songs from the radio and songs from musicals so even though I never had any formal lessons I was learning all the time. My dad took me to see Tony Bennett in Newcastle when I was a teenager and I remember thinking at the time ‘how does somebody move an audience quite so much just by singing?’ I realised that I needed to sing. I wanted to be able to touch people with my music in the same way.\n\nYou moved to London from the North East when you were 18 in a bid to kickstart your singing career, what was that like?\n\nI just went for it. I auditioned for anything and everything, like girl bands, though I couldn’t keep up with the dance moves. I can remember performing to three people in the audience and not getting paid and having to pay my band out of my own pocket. The early days were a struggle but you learn that it takes time.\n\nYou got an agent and became a backing singer performing with the likes of Rod Stewart, Neil Diamond and Enrique Iglesias, when they came to the UK. What was that like?\n\nThe longest standing thing was with Enrique Iglesias. You performed with them when they came over here to promote an album, and it was fun. You’d do three minutes on TV, on things like The Graham Norton Show or Top of the Pops, and you’d all go out afterwards because you got invited to some crazy parties.\n\nYou got a record deal and started performing as a solo artist. What made you keep plugging away when other people might have given up?\n\nIt’s not a job, it’s who you are and you’ve got to do it in a way. A lot of people probably want to do it but can’t keep up that lifestyle of not knowing where your next gig’s coming from and wondering if you’re good enough. You have to be healthily competitive because there’s a lot of singers out there and not too many gigs. It’s not about becoming famous; it’s about being successful and making music that people want to listen to. I get people messaging me on social media saying they heard one of my songs and had to stop the car – that kind of thing blows my mind because it means you’ve reached people in a way that music I listened to when I was growing up did to me.\n\nWhere did the interest in songwriting come from?\n\nI’ve always written lyrics and bits of poetry, but it’s about having something to say and finding the confidence to say it. I don’t play an instrument so I’ve relied on musicians to co-write with me so you’re taking your lyrics, which for me are very personal, and baring your soul. There has to be a lot of trust and it’s about finding people you’re comfortable working with.\n\nWhat have been some of your career highlights?\n\nI played in Dizzy’s Club in New York in January and SF Jazz in San Francisco. To go to cities like these and perform in these places is humbling and to work with so many talented musicians and great producers like Larry Klein. I never dreamed I’d be ever doing this – it’s all a highlight.\n\nWhat’s the buzz of playing live and what are you looking forward to about returning to Harrogate?\n\nIt’s that in the moment, never to be done again, experience, and it’s the audiences you meet along the way and making a connection, that’s what makes it special for me. I know people who’ve bought tickets to come and see me in the Spiegeltent and I just know that we’re going to have a good time."
