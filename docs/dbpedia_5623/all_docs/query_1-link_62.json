        "text": "FolkHouse at the Castle!\n\nThe Castle & Cathedral District (C&CD) are excited to announce a new live music series hosted at the Joslyn Castle! FolkHouse Concerts at the Castle features the best in local grassroots, folk, and Americana bands in an intimate venue: the Castle's historic Carriage House.\n\nC&CD has partnered with FolkHouse, the passion project of Jerome Brich and Mary Montag. Since 2000, they have offered music lovers an opportunity to experience live intimate concerts by top-notch professional touring musicians in a comfortable and friendly environment. No clanking bar glasses, noisy espresso machines or other distractions; just a comfortable smoke-free setting where the guests can focus on the music! And maybe best of all, there are plenty of opportunities to socialize with the performers and other music fans at FolkHouse. FolkHouse started in their home, and we're thrilled to welcome them into OUR home.\n\nSeptember 14: Scott Cook and Pamela May\n\nWe're thrilled to welcome our next performers to the Carriage House on September 14th! Scott Cook with Pamela Mae will lead our next installment of our folk music series.\n\nDoors open at 7pm, concerts begin at 7:30pm. This is a 21+ event. Capacity is limited.\n\nIn 2007, Albertan songwriter Scott Cook quit his job teaching kindergarten in Taiwan and moved into a minivan. He’s made his living as a troubadour ever since, touring almost incessantly across Canada, the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere, averaging 150 shows and a dozen summer festivals a year, and releasing seven albums of plainspoken, keenly observant verse along the way. His latest collection Tangle of Souls comes packaged in a cloth-bound, 240-page hardcover book of road stories and ruminations, equal parts introspection and insurrection. The album spent two weeks at #1 on Alberta's province-wide community radio network CKUA, and earned Scott his third Canadian Folk Music Award nomination, for English Songwriter of the Year. Its second single \"Say Can You See\" was the second most-played song of 2020 on Folk Alliance International's folk radio charts, and took top honours for the folk category in both the 2020 UK Songwriting Competition and the 2020 Great American Song Contest. He’s been back on the road full-time since January of 2022, living in a campervan named Roadetta with his sweetheart Pamela Mae on upright bass and vocals, visiting 43 states and 8 Canadian provinces, and broadcasting solar-powered livestreams from the back of the van. In 2024 they're touring Australia and North America, and recording an eighth album for release in the fall.\n\nPast Concerts\n\nAugust 16: Jon Lawton\n\nWhere: Carriage House on the Joslyn Castle & Garden Grounds (3902 Davenport Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68131)\n\nWhen: Friday, August 16th from 7:30 to 9:00 (Doors open at 7pm)\n\nWhat: 21+ event.
