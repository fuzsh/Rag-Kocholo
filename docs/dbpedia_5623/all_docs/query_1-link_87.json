        "text": "It was supposed to be the deal of the century, and in retrospect – if you count art rather than commerce – it was. It was a project bringing together the most talented songwriter of the ’70s with the most charismatic singer of the Disco era.\n\nThe deal should have made them the new Donna and Giorgio – the black Gospel vocalist and a Blue-Eyed Soul disciple, rewriting the American songbook with a Disco groove.\n\nBut it didn’t.\n\nThere’s a reason you haven’t heard the details behind this before – an all-star project released 36 years ago that gathered together Loleatta Holloway (the vocalist), Dan Hartman (the producer), plus Norman Harris and other leading lights of the Disco era. The fault lies not with the project, but with the waning Disco era itself. On its last legs as a commercial genre, the backlash was underway, and everyone who had an inkling of what was to come had begun to scatter for high ground.\n\nToday, nobody suggests that “Donna and Giorgio” should take second place to “Loleatta and Dan” – but in some ways, I’m going to argue, they should. The argument should at least be made, but for a variety of reasons, it never has. For this brief collaboration created two of the most powerful records in music history – records whose DNA is embedded in the vitals of practically every dance music song to come thereafter.\n\nLoleatta and Dan. But especially Dan. Tell me what you know about the man who wrote this song, Dan Hartman, and I will tell you a tale you will not possibly believe.\n\nMuch of his story, for reasons of a musical prejudice, if not a social one, has yet to be told.\n\nDan Hartman survived Disco’s demise by hiding in plain sight – skipping unprofitable parts of his biography and hoping nobody asked about his horrible Disco crimes. They usually didn’t.\n\nDan Hartman could still write hooks, play keys, work a console or manipulate his chameleon-like voice. Loleatta had her voice, and the voice that made her the Queen of Disco left her struggling to reinvent herself away from it."
