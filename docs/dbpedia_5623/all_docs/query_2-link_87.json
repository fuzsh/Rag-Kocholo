        "text": "I am a simple music consumer. My only area of musical expertise is to know what I like and don't like. Before I heard this album I did not know a great deal about Robbie Williams (I do now!), but had truly appreciated his efforts with Swing When You're Winning (his swing CD). On hearing Sing When You're Winning (released August 2000, first heard by me June 2003), I just had to acquire Robbie's earlier and subsequent albums as well!\n\nSing When You're Winning is Robbie's 3rd solo album and is named after an English soccer chant. The soccer theme continues (with lots of Robbie's in various forms) in the CD booklet. Robbie Williams, in one interview, said that this album \"had more grown-up stuff on it\", which I certainly agree with, and that he was just \"trying to beat his best score from his previous album\". He wanted people to \"have a good time, be sad, be in different moods, and go all over the place\", while listening to it. Well, he achieves all that, and more.\n\nOn my first listen, the lyrics made (and still make) me laugh. Not since Bernie Taupin wrote lyrics for Elton John, have I been particularly interested in any song's lyrics -- until I listened to this album, that is. The lyrics here are brilliant; clever, funny, real and sung so sincerely you feel that you are part of each song.\n\nLet Love Be Your Energy: a good song about finding love, but my least favourite of the whole album. Lots of energy and great at a live show, though.\n\nBetter Man is the best ballad on the album, sung and written beautifully (with the help of a prayer to John Lennon, I believe). I know men of all ages who love this song, and Robbie sings it with so much meaning. I also know of two women who were proposed to with this song playing in the background, and yes, they are now happily married. I recently had the opportunity of singing Better Man (with 50,000 others) in a Sydney stadium with Robbie accompanying us on guitar during a concert I'll never forget.\n\nRock DJ is a simply fantastic (and silly) pop song / dance tune with a great beat and funny lyrics. Check out the clever video for this song (where he peels everything off, even his skin) if you haven't already.\n\nSupreme has lyrics that I love, and a bit of Gloria Gaynor's \"I will survive\", a great catchy song.\n\nOn Kids, Robbie's sexy duet with Kylie (\"the singing budgie\") Minogue, the singers sound like they're having fun; Robbie said that he \"wanted her to sing lots of dirty things to me but wasn't brave enough to write the lyric\". No matter, the lyrics he did write do the trick and the chemistry between them is obvious. However, the best bit for me is the fantastic Robbie rap at the end of the song.\n\nIf It's Hurting You is an emotional ballad with soft music and beautiful vocals. Anyone who has been in a relationship can relate to this song.\n\nSinging For The Lonely is a touching, easy-listening song about the trappings of fame.\n\nLove Calling Earth is a good album track from a great performer. Another ballad about love, this dreamy song has definitely grown on me.\n\nKnutsford City Limits is another good song with excellent lyrics, about where Robbie grew up.\n\nForever Texas is a raunchy and fun song. Great stuff. (Apparently some Texans have taken offence at some of the lyrics; makes it even funnier, really.)\n\nBy All Means Necessary showcases brilliant lyrics about wanting fame and fortune……\n\nRoad To Mandalay is another fun catchy tune which can be sung along to, especially the chorus! Everyone feels happy after this song. For those of you who look forward to Robbie's hidden tracks on his CD's, there is a surprise waiting for you 25 minutes after this track.\n\nIf you like this CD (and I don't know anyone who doesn't), do yourself a favour and get hold of a copy of Robbie's \"Where Egos Dare\" DVD, where you can you can see Robbie during the making of this album, as well as the Rock DJ video (with additional footage), some Slane Castle Concert (1999) highlights, and other funny features. You won't be sorry!\n\nSing When You're Winning is a timeless, infectious, feel-good album for all ages. Be proud, Robbie……… Play the CD; listen, sing, dance, laugh, enjoy!\n\nReviewer- Pamela Eggins\n\nREVIEWS\n\nAlbums2005Intensive Care 2004Greatest Hits2003Robbie Williams Live at Knebworth2003Escapology 2003...Me and My Monkey2001Swing When You're Winning2000Sing When You're Winning 1998I've Been Expecting You 1997Life Thru A Lens DVDs2003The Robbie Williams Show - on DVDBooks2004FeelConcerts2003KnebworthSingles2005Tripping2004Misunderstood2004Radio2003Something Beautiful 2003Come Undone2002Feel 2002The Coppice Charity CD - Rock DJ2001Something Stupid 2001Eternity/ The Road to Mandalay 2001Let Love Be Your Energy 2000Supreme 2000Kids [duet with Kylie Minogue] 2000Rock DJ 1999She's The One/ It's Only Us 1998Strong 1998No Regrets 1998Millennium 1998Let Me Entertain You 1997Angels 1997South Of The Border 1997Lazy Days 1997Old Before I Die 1996Freedom"
