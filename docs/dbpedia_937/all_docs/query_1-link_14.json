Because of this, Madera County Animal Services in California has prioritized communicating in both English and Spanish. Director Amy Toler says their many bilingual employees are critical in this process. They publish as much as they can in both languages, and not just the important legal documents. Toler says it's important to share \"the fun stuff as well\" with their Spanish-speaking community. You can find adoption specials, microchip clinics flyers, pet safety tips - you name it - in English and Spanish on their Facebook page. Pro Tip: For printed documents, they put both English and Spanish into one document because it's more cost-efficient and cuts down on paperwork. It can also help non-Spanish speakers provide customer service to Spanish speakers, because they can easily reference the English word next to the Spanish word.

This partnership will enhance connectivity and coordination of care, ensuring that no one falls through the cracks. 🗨️ “Health is measured in more than just medical care.

Here's why CalAIM matters for seniors: 1️⃣ Whole Person Care: CalAIM focuses on addressing not just medical needs but also the broader social determinants of health that impact seniors' well-being. From access to affordable housing to mental health support and beyond, CalAIM is designed to provide comprehensive care that considers the unique needs of each individual. 2️⃣ Innovative Care Models: The program introduces innovative care models tailored to seniors, such as enhanced care management and expanded access to community-based services. These models aim to improve health outcomes and enhance the quality of life for seniors by providing personalized, coordinated care. 3️⃣ Equity and Diversity: CalAIM prioritizes health equity, aiming to reduce disparities in health outcomes among seniors from diverse backgrounds. By addressing social determinants of health and promoting culturally competent care, CalAIM strives to ensure that all seniors have equal access to high-quality healthcare services. 4️⃣ Simplification and Streamlining: One of the key goals of CalAIM is to simplify administrative processes and streamline access to care for seniors enrolled in Medi-Cal. This means less paperwork, easier navigation of the healthcare system, and more time spent on what matters most—improving health and well-being. As California continues to innovate and advance its Medicaid program, seniors enrolled in Medi-Cal can look forward to enhanced support, improved access to care, and a renewed focus on holistic well-being. Stay tuned for more updates on CalAIM and how it's shaping the future of healthcare for seniors in our state! #CalAIM #MediCal #SeniorCare #HealthcareInnovation 🚀🌈💙\n\n3\n\nWe did it! The NSBAC, as part of a mighty coalition of small business owners, small business support and advocacy organizations and community leaders, helped safeguard a vital support program for California small businesses. The Technical Assistance Program was on the chopping block for a proposed $13.1 million budget cut, 56.5 percent of the program's annual funding, but the grassroots efforts and unity of this coalition, along with supportive legislators of pro-small business policies, is what delivered this victory for the 4.1 million small businesses in California. “This is a victory for every voice that spoke up, whether in-person, online or in print against budget cuts to TAP,” said NSBAC President Allison Allain. “In this case, it didn’t just take a village, it took a whole state working together to protect small business owners.” Sign up to join NSBAC to help deliver more victories for small businesses at NSBAC dot US #smallbusiness #smallbusinessadvocacy #californiasmallbusiness #saveTAP\n\n8\n\n3 Comments\n\nOur founder and fearless Latina Leader Yohana I. Quiróz, Ed.D. wrote a piece about our work at Unidos for ECE and the importance of \"Empowering Latino Leadership in ECE: A Vision for Change\" California stands as a beacon of innovation and diversity, with Latinos poised to represent 45% of the population by 2060. However, a critical gap persists: while 46% of the ECE workforce is Latinas, only 12% hold leadership roles in the field. At Unidos for ECE, we stand as the pioneering organization founded and led by Latinas, committed exclusively to forging paths of leadership for fellow Latinas in the realm of early care and education. Our focus is clear: to bridge this leadership gap and unapologetically support Latinas in early care and education. As pioneers in this movement, we're committed to forging pathways of leadership exclusively for Latinas, both within and beyond the ECE sphere. We aim not just to empower but to elevate the Latino community, ensuring their amplified influence and substantial representation and contributions to championing the well-being of all children, but particularly Latino children and families. Recognizing the unique challenges faced by Latina leaders, we delve into intersectionality in leadership, addressing factors such as race, gender, and socio-economic background to foster inclusive leadership reflective of the diverse communities we serve. At the heart of our strategy is our catalyst program-- ELLA-ES, our initiative to build a robust culturally and linguistically responsive and sustaining Latina leadership pipeline. We advocate for intentional efforts to identify, mentor, train and support emergent Latina leaders. Collaboration with philanthropy and organizations, both within and outside the education sector, is pivotal to strengthening this pipeline. Measuring success is not just a goal but a commitment. We define key performance indicators and success metrics for developing Latina leadership in ECE, and Unidos for ECE is unwavering in its dedication to tracking and evaluating the impact of its initiatives.

Dominick Haider is a BJJ black belt and founder of @guardianlosangeles Living in South LA has shown @dnhaider30 that despite the community’s bad rep, residents just want to live and thrive. Lack of investments, resources, and recreational activities make this difficult. With few available/affordable opportunities to participate in, bad influences may drastically affect the trajectory of youth lives in a negative way Dominick wanted to help change this and reached out to @calder.powers (Director of @guardiangym), who offered him the opportunity to open Guardian Gym LA: a place where youths now go to have fun, socialize, study, clear their minds, eat something healthy, and exercise/train – greatly helping students and supporting their families “Jiu Jitsu, to me, is a vehicle to help these kids find a healthy community when oftentimes their communities are lacking or failing them. Our program is structured so that these kids are provided with valuable mentorship and opportunities to learn how to mentor others. As instructors, our focus is to convey discipline, compassion, perseverance, and strong moral character which in turn is mirrored by them and trickles down to every new student that comes in. Unlike many sports or afterschool programs, Guardian classes run year round (and they can do it for the rest of their lives) so these kids always know a place they can go and count on to be there for them, which is invaluable. We all matter. Jiu Jitsu can help EVERYONE but it isn’t available to everyone that wants or needs it. A quote I heard recently is that ‘Talent is universal, Opportunity is not’ – one that many don’t realize or forget. This can be applied to anything and one of Guardian’s main principles is [to] provide that opportunity to those that otherwise wouldn’t have it.” Learn more from the article on our website Fight For It. #sanabul #fighterseries #teamsanabul\n\n3\n\nLatinos Love Podcasts! 🎧 Monthly podcast listenership among Latinos has surged by 52% since 2020, with 38% of U.S. Latinos aged 18+ now tuning in regularly.
