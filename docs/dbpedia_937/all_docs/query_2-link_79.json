Amy has received awards for her AP African American Studies research paper and an award in AP Spanish. Her hobbies include journaling, reading, and she is always adding to her Pinterest boards!\n\n“Three things that I would like to change in my community would be the lack of mental health awareness in our youth, the amount of access underserved communities have to healthy, nutritious foods, and I would like to reduce the amount of pollution thats present in public spaces. ”\n\nElleaire, Grade 10, Coronado High School\n\nElleaire is very active in school, as she has been a part of the Associated Student Body for the past 2 years. She feels that being a school leader brings her purpose of bridging friendships and peer equality. Elleaire was the Coronado Middle School Chapter founder of Kid By Kid from inception in 2019.

Elleaire enjoys hobbies such as piano and art as well as competitive golf and lacrosse.\n\n“At a young adolescent age, remaining in good health is critical. Many factors apply in keeping this balance; both internal decisions and the surrounding environment resources. The three topics that contribute to good health and three community changes I would like to focus on are good healthy eating habits, having access to more nutritious meals, and having better access to exercise and recreational sports. Having healthy eating habits ties into access to more nutritious meals. Reaching out and educating those who struggle with unhealthy eating habits can completely change their outlook and lifestyle. In addition to healthy eating and access to more nutritional meals, proper exercise also helps achieve a healthy lifestyle. I feel it can be hard to feel motivated to exercise, so that’s why having resources and access to recreational sports is so important. Furthermore, getting healthy with exercise may expose you to meeting new people, developing new skills, and becoming more involved with our community.”\n\nKeira, Grade 11, Francis Parker High\n\nKeira is a high school leader with a passion for the empowerment of women in her community. Her presidency in tutorHER, a nonprofit tutoring organization focused on the uplifting of young girls, involvement in FAV (female athlete volunteers), a community service club filled with young female athletes hoping to make a positive change in the world, and commitment to the USCD YAC are examples of Keira’s embracing of her passion. Step by step, student by student, girl by girl, Keira hopes to continue her work and assist her community, especially through the compassion and citizenship of the YAC.\n\n“As stated in my bio, I would like to continue my work and improve the connected girlhood in my community in any way possible, whether it’s tutoring, teaching lacrosse to young girls, or assisting food distributions in my county. Through collaboration in projects or having an activity to bond over, it is crucial for high school girls to communicate with the younger generation, empower, and uplift them in ways the modern world refuses to do. I would also like to focus on growing issues in our San Diego community through the YAC and try to unionize available high school students looking to make a change in the world to address and hopefully overcome any expanding concerns. “\n\nMia, Grade 11, San Diego High School\n\nMia have been on the varsity girls tennis for all of high school.

Her other interests include reading, playing piano, and cooking. After high school, she plans on following a career in law.\n\n“In my community, I think the most important thing to change is our housing crisis. No matter the neighborhood in San Diego, I see homeless people on the street with nowhere to go, and it motivates me to make a difference. The second thing I would like to change in my community is access to healthy food for everyone across San Diego. The last thing I would like to change is to stop the pollution at our beaches in San Diego.”\n\nArthur, Grade 10, Torrey Pines High School\n\nArthur established the ForSocialGoods program, an initiative dedicated to inspiring positive social change to promote food justice, health equity, and public safety.

By joining the Youth Advisory Council (YAC), I am hoping to work with my peers and take the necessary steps to bring about positive changes in our community.”\n\nDurga, Grade 12, Mt.

In the future, he plans to major in a biology or chemistry related field.\n\n“If I could change three things in my community, I would first encourage the community to help fight rare diseases, whether it’s donating money or researching a method to help patients. Many people suffer from rare diseases, yet these diseases go unheard of by the public. Next, I would like to promote STEM education to students in the community. As technology is changing the world rapidly, it’s important to empower people with skills that will help them live a productive life in the twenty-first century. Finally, I would like promote mental health awareness among students. As high schoolers are taking on increasingly difficult workloads, it’s always important to balance work and stress so that us students can enjoy our time as teenagers.”\n\nSaanvi, Grade 10, Del Norte High School\n\nSaanvi is passionate about equity in health and education.

Through Mid- City CAN and Fulfilling Destiny I’ve taken initiative in trying to find solutions and advocating for change within these issues. By joining the Youth Advisory Council I hope to further change within communities by working alongside fellow youth.”\n\nValerie, Grade 11, The Preuss School\n\nAs a young low-income, first-generation, and hard-of-hearing Latina, Valerie’s encounters with social roadblocks throughout her journey towards higher education have made systemic barriers noticeably clear.

I would also like to focus on the implementation of safe, green spaces. Unsafe conditions within the few green spaces in my community have inhibited young athletes from easy access to healthy and active routines. Establishing safer conditions within new green spaces is absolutely necessary for the well-being of younger generations.”\n\nEric, Grade 11, Olympian High School\n\nEric is an extroverted individual who loves to meet and connect with others.

Eric is also a member of his school’s Wellness Club, which promotes a safe and open space for everyone to connect. He hope to pursue a career in chemistry/engineering.\n\n“If I could change 3 things in my community, it would be improving the sense of pride within an individuals culture/religion/background/etc. and to learn to not be afraid to show who you truly are and what represents you; advocating for mental health awareness and creating possible programs/organizations to help diminish the ever-growing issue among students; also, promoting healthy eating and developing new habits. I plan on taking initiative on these changes over the course of my high-school career and will use my prior and current experience in my clubs to ensure that measures are being taken to help achieve these goals.”"
