Over 1,000 agencies across the country are working every day to create opportunities and transform the lives of their neighbors, making communities stronger and helping families across the US thrive.\n\n“Each May, during Community Action Month, we reflect on the impact Mid Michigan Community Action and our network has had on families,” said Jill Sutton, Executive Director of Mid Michigan Community Action. “Last year alone, we served 14,532 people from Muskegon to Bay City, and the network served over 15 million across the country with immediately needed services such as housing and food, and long-term solutions like weatherization and early childhood education.”\n\nCommunity Action Agencies serve America with life-changing services to help families achieve financial stability. All agencies are locally controlled and represented by the private, public, and low-income sectors of the community. “We are proud of our communities’ participation in the development and oversight of our programs,” said Sutton. “Their engagement helps us to be more effective in our approach by determining what our communities need.”\n\nTo honor the commitment to community-led solutions, Mid Michigan Community Action is launching its triennial Community Needs Assessment. The assessment analyses Census data, labor statistics, and most importantly, community survey and focus group findings. To complete the Community Needs Assessment survey, visit www.mmcaa.org/cna. Details on the virtual and in-person focus groups are available through the survey, on the website, and across social media @MidMichiganCommunityAction.\n\n​\n\nMid Michigan Community Action is a member of the National Community Action Partnership and the Community Action network, which was born out of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.

Weatherization implements cost-effective energy solutions to reduce energy costs, increase safety in the home, and improve the health of the residents.\n\nDuring Weatherization, trained professionals known as Energy Auditors use computerized energy audit software and advanced diagnostic equipment such as blower doors and infrared cameras to create a comprehensive energy analysis of the home. This analysis helps determine the most cost-effective measures to install in each home. The Energy Auditor creates a customized work order. Then trained contractors and crew members install the energy-efficiency and health and safety measures, such as insulation, blower-door-guided air sealing of key leakage junctures, and installations such as lighting and water-saving measures.\n\nHealth and safety issues such as elevated levels of carbon monoxide, moisture problems, mold, ventilation needs, and heating systems safety and efficiency are also addressed. There is growing evidence the program provides benefits beyond energy savings. Improved indoor air quality and appropriate ventilation strategies lead to healthier living conditions in Weatherized homes, which often lead to improved health outcomes such as reduced asthma triggers and fewer doctor visits.\n\n“Especially during extreme high and low temperatures, affordable energy is critical,” said Justin Walls, Mid Michigan CAA Housing Director. “In addition to improving energy costs, Weatherization improves the comfort and safety of homes. We are thrilled to begin offering this valuable service in Muskegon and Oceana Counties.”\n\nWeatherization is available to low-income homeowners, renters, homes on land contracts, and landlords with multi-unit housing.\n\nResidents of Bay, Clare, Gladwin, Mecosta, Midland, Muskegon, Oceana, and Osceola Counties interested in Weatherization should contact the Mid Michigan CAA office nearest them: Bay City at 989-894-9060, Big Rapids at 231-660-0271, Farwell at 989-386-3805, Gladwin at 989-426-2801, Hart at 231-923-3066, Midland at 989-832-7377, Muskegon at 231-557-7622 or Reed City at 231-791-7078 or email us at [email protected].\n\n​\n\nMid Michigan Community Action guides local residents on the path to self-sufficiency through empowerment, education and community enrichment.\n\nMid Michigan Community Action Will be Providing Volunteer Income Tax Assistance in 2023\n\nMid Michigan Community Action Agency (Mid Michigan CAA) will be providing free income tax preparation services through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program.\n\nVITA is an IRS program managed by partners all over the country, including Community Action Agencies.
