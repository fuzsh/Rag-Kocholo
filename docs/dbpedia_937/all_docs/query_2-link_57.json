Angela A Guzman – I am currently serving my 2nd elected term on MCWCC, having previously been Budget Committee Chair, Treasurer and now on the Transportation committee. I believe the neighborhood councils are an excellent vehicle and sounding board to assist the City of Los Angeles in a variety of matters.I’m seeking a 3rd term because I see value in participation, it allows me to “spread the word” with credibility and, because I care what happens here!You won’t be sorry to cast your vote for Angela Guzman. I’m grateful for the opportunity to serve my community. Thank you. Lynn Garrett – I rent my home and run my business in Zone 5. If you need a councilperson just for that zone I’m fine with being that person. I wrote that I could be a “Member At Large” since my job at HiddenLA has me often representing Los Angeles as a whole… I’m flexible. David Mann – Hello my name is David Mann. I’m a second generation homeowner in the Miracle Mile. I have a M.A. in Fine Arts. As an independent arts program developer I have produced performing arts events for our community with support from the Chamber and CD4/5.Along with teaching on the college level I have run a 501c3 senior organization, and continue to function as a builder/designer.My engagement with MCW is as a current board member and past chair of the arts committee. I produced the first ArtWalk on the MM, and am working to establish an arts district.As an at large representative I will continue to broaden my scope to declare our area as the cultural center of LA. As such I will continue to reach out to the greater arts, business and political communities.This is my “at large” goal. T. Michael Darner – As an active Board member for the last six years, I have served on both the Transportation and Land Use Committees, first as a member, then as chair of each. I love our neighborhoods and have worked to fairly represent it to help preserve its unique qualities and at the same time to confront and embrace change thoughtfully. I look forward to continuing to serve. Maria Shah Andy Meselson – I have lived and worked in Los Angeles all my life, and I am very familiar with the business community in this area.

Abraham Gelbart – As a resident of this area, I am well acquanted with issues regarding this neighborhood. That aside, I understand how vitally important this committee for the welfare of the community. Jason Reade – As our ever-changing city continues to evolve, we need to ensure that Mid City West is an even better place to live and do business for the diverse community that calls this wonderful patchwork of neighborhoods home.We can help to achieve this by making sure City Hall prioritizes sidewalk and street repairs, by making our streets safer for pedestrians through improved lighting and the placement of protected crosswalks on major commercial thoroughfares, and by maintaining the variety of small business and retail stores that help to enhance Mid City West’s vibrancy.I am an attorney and hold degrees from Occidental College and Brooklyn Law School. I am a Southern California native and have returned to Los Angeles after several years in New York, and am proud to once again call this city I love home. I would be honored to serve you on the Mid City West Community Council. Allison Hendrick – I have lived in the Mid City West area for the last four years. I served as a high school teacher with LAUSD and Green Dot Public Schools before beginning my current position as the Program Coordinator at Hayutin & Associates, where I facilitate independent study and tutoring for students. I believe there should be more people serving the community with backgrounds in education to ensure area schools are a priority in addition to the matters currently in focus. Using my experience, I will work with local schools and educators to facilitate training opportunities for teachers and enrichment for students. I will strive to get students involved with community events, providing growth opportunities both for themselves and for the community. When our schools are strengthened, the whole community benefits. I would be honored if you would vote for me, Allison Hendrick, on March 30th at the Pan Pacific Recreation Center. Andrew C. Jhun – It would be my privilege to continue serving you on MCWCC as a member at large. Over the last year, I served as the chair of the ad hoc strategic plan committee and as a member of the bylaws committee bringing action to mobilize our neighborhood council and enhance access to our stakeholders. I am an attorney having previously worked in the non-profit healthcare sector in the San Francisco Bay Area where I was born and raised. During and after college at Stanford, I was active in community organizing and advocacy. I believe in active listening, consensus building and creative problem solving. My wife, 2-month old son, and I are thankful to be residents of this vibrant community and I hope you will join me in bringing meaningful progress toward a community that is an even better place to live, work, and play.
