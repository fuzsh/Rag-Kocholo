Twenty-nineteen was a big year for us with the most noteworthy events being our recent move to Ottawa Hills Neighborhood (a whopping half mile from our house on Rosewood) and earlier this year Jeff transitioned jobs - he is loving it. Both changes have already begun to shape our year to come and we are excited about the opportunities these changes will bring in the new year.\n\nThis years New Years Eve celebrations were certainly memorable to say the least! Jeff and I hosted the 2020 Winter Games and I could not have been more impressed by my friends for not only showing up, but also for embracing the hilarity of the occasion to it’s fullest.\n\nEach couple who attended was instructed to select a country of their choice to represent; Jeff and I chose the good ole U.S. of A.! Team uniforms were strongly encouraged as well as a dish to pass that represented their heritage. Canada brought Canadian bacon deviled eggs and Canadian bacon pigs in the blanket with maple syrup dipping sauce. Mexico showed up with loaded nachos which got devoured. Italy (and in true Kyle Workman form) brought Italian sausage and other assorted meats and cheeses from the local butcher. We did not go hungry."
