She first aimed to be a biomedical researcher, studying biology and biochemistry at San Diego State University, but switched routes after graduating due to the structural barriers she witnessed in communities of color that resulted in health disparities. She works to ensure that every individual has the right to reach their potential and live a just and healthy life. She has previously worked at Mid-City CAN (Community Advocacy Network), starting as a policy intern before transitioning to coordinating Mid-City CANâ€™s events and programs."
