Charley keeps all information confidential, and everything it shares has been vetted by experienced public health professionals and legal experts.\n\nOver-The-Counter Birth Control Pill – we worked with the FDA to see O-Pill, an oral contraceptive, moved from prescription-only to over-the-counter. This is a huge win for women because it is the first oral contraceptive to be available without a prescription."
