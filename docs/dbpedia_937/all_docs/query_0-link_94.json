        "text": "BikeMN’s newest ride in Southeast Minnesota – Saturday May 24th 2025\n\nA New Annual Tradition – Every Saturday Before Memorial Day!\n\nJoin the team behind BikeMN’s Chapter, We Bike Rochester, to celebrate the great trail network that meanders around Minnesota’s third largest city! We Bike Rochester has been instrumental into bringing community engagement around biking and walking for years and has been wanting an event like this to highlight local businesses, beautiful natural areas, and fun of the Rochester area! Hundreds of volunteer hours have been utilized to repair bicycles for community members, host educational programming, and work to improve safety and access around the city.\n\nCheck-in Details – Yes, you can register on the morning of the ride!\n\nThe tour starts and ends at Cascade Lake Park. Check-in goes from 9-10 a.m. for long route riders. All riders should be underway by 10 a.m. Rest stops and SAG support services end at 2pm. Riders will enjoy food and drink at rest stops along the route. Helmets are required: Protect your melon! Safe cycling to all Meander riders!\n\nLive Music Lineup!\n\nThe 2024 MCM features Loud Mouth Brass, Josiah Smith and Pat Egan.\n\nRoutes are all on paved trails\n\nThe MCM features a signature 29 mile relaxed tour of Rochester’s trail system highlighting what makes the “Med City” a dynamic and vibrant community. From tree canopied riverside paths to gentle Driftless bluffs, this carefully curated route will feature convenient rest stops all along the way! There is also an option to do as many laps around Cascade Lake as you’d like. No need to register for that one, just show up for the fun. 27 Mile Route Link & 2.5 Mile Fun Lap Route Link\n\nNorth and South Trails, Cascade Creek, Bear Creek, and more! Rochester offers a vast network of trails and bike lanes. Check out some of them on the City of Rochester’s Parks and Recreation page or We Bike Rochester’s route library.\n\nVolunteer and Get Involved\n\nWe Bike Rochester is an all-volunteer initiative and would love to engage with Rochester area locals to help with the Med City Meander annual ride and more. Volunteer for the ride and/or join the mailing list and learn more here.\n\nAll Bikes Welcome!\n\nAll e-bikes as outlined in the Minnesota definition of e-bikes in Class I, II, or III are welcome to join BikeMN rides (we do not provide charging along the route so make sure you select the route suitable for your battery life). Analog bicycles, adaptive bikes, tandems, recumbents, tricycles, cargo bikes, burley style kid trailers, even well behaved (and leashed) pets are welcome! We encourage you to be familiar with your bicycle in advance of the ride too and practice riding with larger groups.\n\nOut Town? Here are Lodging Suggestions from Experience Rochester"
