        "text": "(Draft) Inverclyde Community Justice Outcomes Improvement Plan 2024 Last week Inverclyde Community Justice Partnership published its draft Community Justice Outcomes Improvement Plan. This plan initially commenced following publication of the National Strategy for Community Justice in 2022 and developed throughout 2023. The CJOIP has five priority outcomes reflecting the four nationally determined outcomes and a locally determined outcome around housing and homelessness outcomes for those in the justice system. The document outlines progress from the previous CJOIP published in 2015, an analysis of community justice locally and action underway by the Partnership to meet the priority aims. Regarding the priority outcomes a range of proposed actions are included over the next few years. The document has now moved into an engagement phase until mid-March. There is a consultation survey for groups and individuals locally, a planned week of engagement with the third sector, engagement with individuals who have lived/living experience of the justice system and a number of staff engagement sessions from across the Partnership and beyond. The draft CJOIP and consultation survey are available via https://lnkd.in/ep_DHFH9 EDITED COMMENT. The idea of this post is to generate discussion if anyone wants to ask/comment/respond to anything.\n\nI was born and raised in Sierra Leone, a country in West Africa. Over the years, I have participated in several community development initiatives promoting sustainable development through advocacy, sensitization, dialogue engagement, collaboration, resource mobilization, formulation, and implementation of led-action plans to address community and ultimately global \"wicked problems\". I believe that tackling these problems through sustainable development metrics requires \"all hands-on deck\", a deeper understanding of the complex institutional dimensions, and a sincere need for social equity through dialogue, engagement, inclusion, and collaboration.\n\n\"Effective community intervention programs have become instrumental in addressing the root causes of delinquency. These initiatives encompass a broad spectrum of strategies, including early intervention, educational support, mentoring, and conflict resolution. The emphasis on rehabilitation over incarceration has shown promising results in reducing repeat offenses and enhancing community safety.\" https://lnkd.in/g75tjVZy Life Decisions is helping youth get back on track, stay out of trouble and reach healthy adulthood. We cannot do what we do, without the support and investment of the community. Partner with us by supporting the work we do. Together, Bringing Restoration to Rockford. https://lnkd.in/g6j2_X7Q\n\nOne interesting angle on advocacy are the efforts some people devote to prodding certain key players to get more involved. In sectors like philanthropy, there can be a reluctance because it seems too political. As founder of the Center for Community Foundation Policy Leadership, longtime criminal justice reform advocate Stephen Saloom has been focused on encouraging and supporting community foundations to advocate on their issues. As Stephen shared on the podcast, the strongest case for doing so traces back to these organizations' stated missions. Community foundations' missions typically commit them to the well-being of the local populace in the broadest terms—as broadly as any governmental body or public official. So it's only logical, Stephen argues, that community foundations should get engaged in questions of policy that affect the local community. https://lnkd.in/gbzzT-Ba\n\nMy second article for The Borgen Project delved into the street child phenomenon in Durban, South Africa. It takes a look at the work of the organisation, Surfers Not Street Children (SNSC), founded by activist and surfer Tom Hewitt. Tracing the colonial history of South Africa, this article sheds light on the new generation of street children turned surfers who are shifting the boundaries of who can ride the wave in the 21st century. https://lnkd.in/eWYBnxJf"
