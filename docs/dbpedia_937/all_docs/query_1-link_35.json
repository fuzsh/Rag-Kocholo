        "text": "Paul Parker\n\nExecutive Director\n\nPaul Parker joined the Commission on Police Practices as the Executive Director in June 2024, after an extensive national search, that included the involvement of a community panel, the City of San Diego Commission on Police Practices (CPP), and the San Diego City Council. Prior to joining the CPP, Mr. Parker served as the Executive Officer of the San Diego County Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board (CLERB) for almost five years, making numerous recommendations to reduce in-custody deaths, increase transparency of law enforcement operations, reduce racially disparate policing practices, and increase communications with family members of persons impacted by in-custody deaths and deaths associated with law enforcement activities.\n\nMr. Parker was previously the Chief Deputy Director at the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner, Assistant Coroner at the Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner, Director of the Pinal County (AZ) Medical Examiner’s Office and held Chief Investigator roles at the San Diego County Medical Examiner Office and Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office (Phoenix, AZ).\n\nMr. Parker has participated in several thousand on-scene medicolegal death investigations, conducted at least 13,000 solo telephonic/electronically reported medicolegal death investigations, and reviewed and approved reports and circumstances in excess of 20,000 medicolegal additional death investigations. He has also conducted several hundred death notifications.\n\nMr. Parker was a member of the California Coroner Curriculum Development Committee, an instructor at the California Coroner Academy, an American Academy of Forensic Sciences Standards Board Medicolegal Death Investigation Consensus Body Member, and an Executive Board Member of the International Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners (IAC&ME). He has authored hundreds of policies and procedures pertaining to medicolegal death.\n\nPrior to entering the field of death investigation, Mr. Parker had a 10-year law enforcement career during which he progressively held the ranks of police aide, police officer, detective, sergeant, lieutenant, and acting police chief at the Youngtown Police Department (AZ). He was an AZPOST general instructor, physical fitness instructor, field training officer, and hostage negotiator. He has received two lifesaving awards, one for his role as the negotiator in the peaceful resolution of a hostage situation and the other for his efforts during a medical emergency. Mr. Parker was accepted to the FBI National Academy and was the Town Council’s first choice for Police Chief in the late-1990’s but turned down both opportunities to pursue his passion for death investigation after being involved in an on-duty shooting.\n\nMr. Parker is convinced that a properly managed civilian oversight agency helps to increase the community’s trust in its law enforcement agency, especially when collaborative relationships with the community and agency are established. Paul also believes that civilian oversight agencies, even though oftentimes advisory in nature, can start critical community conversations that often result in policy recommendations that, if implemented, would minimize racially disparate practices, minimize uses of force, and increase the safety of community members and police officers alike.\n\nMr. Parker looks forward to assisting the CPP to fulfill its mission by building the staff team, working with all stakeholders to implement the CPP’s draft operating procedures, and increasing transparency of CPP activities.\n\nDuane Bennett\n\nCPP Outside Counsel\n\nDuane Bennett has been a practicing Attorney for 39 years. Mr. Bennett has extensive experience in governmental law, employment, contracts, land use, insurance, civil rights, and civil litigation. He was the former Oceanside City Attorney and Port Attorney/General Counsel for the Port of San Diego. Mr. Bennett was the first African American appointed as City Attorney in the County of San Diego. He also served as an Assistant City Attorney, Police Legal Advisor and Deputy District Attorney. Mr. Bennett has been actively involved in litigation and consultant related to civil rights, due process, and equal protection involving law enforcement agencies throughout the nation. He has conducted workplace investigations in the counties of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego as well as numerous internal investigations for governmental agencies. Mr. Bennett served many years for the Riverside County Sheriffs’ Association and County of Riverside deciding disciplinary matters and grievances. He has also taught law enforcement courses in the states of Arizona, Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana. Even though retired, Mr. Bennett has expanded his private law practice as an experienced arbitrator, mediator and litigator handling employment and commercial disputes involving governmental agencies, financial institutions, and more. He arbitrates and mediates for the American Arbitration Association and serves on the arbitration panel for the San Bernardino Civil Service Commission. Mr. Bennett also serves as outside counsel to San Diego County Law Enforcement Review Board (CLERB).\n\nOlga Golub\n\nChief Investigator\n\nBefore joining the San Diego Commission on Police Practices in 2023, Ms. Golub gained her expertise in civilian oversight at the New York Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), an independent city agency overseeing the nation’s largest police force. During her nearly seven-year tenure at the CCRB, Ms. Golub worked as an Investigator of various seniority levels until she became an Investigative Manager, overseeing a team of investigators. As part of the CCRB, Ms. Golub conducted investigations into allegations of force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, offensive language, and sexual misconduct involving uniformed members of the New York City Police Department. Her work at the CCRB allowed her to understand the nuances of the community-police relationship in the nation’s largest city and obtain extensive knowledge in police practices. Ms. Golub worked on cases that included serious force incidents, complex legal matters, and high-profile cases that garnered national media attention or stemmed from mass protests, among others.\n\nMs. Golub also has a background in investigating sexual violence, sexual harassment, discrimination, and harassment based on protected bases for a major California university and consulting for an international organization focused on developing new strategies to combat transnational organized crime.\n\nMs. Golub holds a Master of Public Administration degree from the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and International Studies from the City College of New York at the City University of New York.\n\nContact: golubo@sandiego.gov\n\nAlina Conde\n\nExecutive Assistant\n\nMs. Alina Conde has a background of over 12 years of administrative support experience.
