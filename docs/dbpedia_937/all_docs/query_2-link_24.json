        "text": "“Approximately 50 community members helped beautify the Miracle Mile on April 13 during Operation Sparkle, a cleanup on Wilshire Boulevard organized by the Miracle Mile Residential Association, the Mid City West Neighborhood Council and The Mirabel. Volunteers filled dozens of bags with hundreds of pounds of trash along the Wilshire corridor.”\n\n“Volunteers bring a sparkle to Wilshire Boulevard”\n\nBeverly Press\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n“Having vibrant businesses within Mid City West is a huge benefit to the community, especially in that area, as we see more revitalization coming through with the addition of the Academy Museum [and] with LACMA getting renovated – it’s really going to be important for us to have businesses to support the tourists and the locals that come to our area to see these world class museums that we have here on the Miracle Mile,” Mid City West Neighborhood Council chair Sara Griebe said. “So, we’re very excited to have something in that space [and] it’s no longer sitting vacant. We hope that more businesses will come to the mid-Wilshire area to help support the infrastructure that’s coming in.”\n\n“Liquor license OK’d by neighborhood council”\n\nby Rance Collins\n\nBeverly Press\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\n“We’re very excited and honored to be able to work with our neighbors once again for the Mid City West portion of the Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count,” Mid West Neighborhood Council board member Julian Stern said. “Obviously, the count is vital in terms of understanding the scope of the problem we’re tackling and qualifying L.A. County for federal funding. But, as a Neighborhood Council, we also value it as a first point of contact with many neighbors looking to be engaged. We hope that, whether folks are able to volunteer with us this year or not, they reach out and attend future committee and board meetings.”\n\n“Annual Homeless Count begins in L.A. County”\n\nby Rance Collins\n\nBeverly Press\n\nJanuary 24, 2024\n\n2023\n\n“[MCWNC Board President Lauren] Nichols also highlighted Mid City West’s Homelessness Connect Days, which are held every Thursday afternoon from 1-4 p.m. in the Gardner Street parking lot at Pan Pacific Park, in the 100 block of South Gardner Street. Homeless individuals can take showers in a mobile unit and receive information about resources that are available. Nichols said she plans to connect people from the encampment on Sixth Street with those services.\n\n‘The mini-connect days are one of the things we are doing and I hope people are using it […] With the homeless count, there are more than 30 census tracts we will cover, including that encampment. That will be one of the zones, and ideally, we can increase the response there.”’\n\n“Tents along Sixth Street continue to raise concerns”\n\nby Edwin Folven\n\nBeverly Press\n\nJanuary 18, 2023\n\n2022\n\n“The Mid City West Neighborhood Council’s Planning and Land Use Committee approved support for a transformational project at the Television City campus during a virtual meeting on Aug. 15… The TVC 2050 project, proposed by Hackman Capital Partners, which purchased the Television City complex from CBS in 2018, will expand facilities within the 25-acre property near Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, creating 1,874,000 square feet of sound stages, production support space, office space and retail space on the site.”\n\n“Mid City West panel supports TV City project”\n\nby Edwin Folven\n\nBeverly Press\n\nAugust 17, 2022\n\n“[Miracle Mile Residential Association President Greg] Goldin said that personally, he has had positive encounters with the individuals staying in the [La Brea Tar Pits homeless] encampments so far. He said his family walks Hancock Park daily and converses with the people staying there.\n\n[But] Lynda La Rose, Mid City West Neighborhood Council’s Homelessness, Renters Rights and Refugees Committee chair, said she has not seen or heard of any outreach being done with people in the encampments, though the encampments are relatively new.\n\n‘I mean, there are a lot of issues at play,’ she said, adding that the council may soon look to re-implement programs that supported individuals experiencing homelessness prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. ‘There will be different projects that we want to take on.’”\n\n“Encampments form in Miracle Mile”\n\nby Aaron Blevins\n\nBeverly Press\n\nJuly 20, 2022\n\n“Juneteenth is a moment where we step back and try to understand the concept of freedom through the eyes of Black people. Through the holiday, we can begin to examine, acknowledge, and address all of the issues, past and present, tied up in the issue of slavery. At [Melrose Trading Post], we plan to honor the liberation and resilience of Black Americans through art created by Black Angelenos, be it through spoken word, dance [and] music.”\n\n- Sara Griebe, MCW Social and Racial Equity Committee Outreach & Civic Engagement Liaison\n\n“Community organizations celebrate Juneteenth”\n\nby Rance Collins\n\nBeverly Press\n\nJune 16, 2022\n\nJune 5, 2022 ribbon-cutting ceremony at Rosewood Gardens. This clip first aired on Sunday June 5 on KTLA's 'Live at 5pm' program."
