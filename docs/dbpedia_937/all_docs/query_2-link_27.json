        "text": "A True Community School: Why My Family Loves Morris Jeff\n\nBy Jennifer Weishaupt\n\nIn the fourth installment of our ten-essay series by parents of students at public schools in Mid-City, Jennifer Weishaupt writes about her family’s experience at Morris Jeff Community School. Mid-City, like New Orleans as a whole, has many public school options for families. In this series, we hear from parents themselves on why their child’s school is right for them.\n\nMorris Jeff Community School lives up to its name. It is focused on building community and having our whole city represented. It is a “neighborhood school” where all of New Orleans is our neighborhood. It is diverse and open access; Morris Jeff wants to truly represent New Orleans.\n\nMy children’s classrooms aren’t just racially and economically diverse. They are diverse in terms of the part of the city that students are from. They are an inclusive school, meaning that they are diverse in terms of learning styles and needs, and children of all abilities learn side by side.\n\nThat is one of the things I am most grateful for about Morris Jeff. My children are learning what it is like to be a part of a diverse community. Everybody in this world is not the same, and that’s what makes it so beautiful. My children are understanding how to cooperate and be part of a true community.\n\nThey are also developing as individuals. My oldest child, Aidan, is in the eighth grade. He’s my “Renaissance Man” because he has very varied interests. Academically, he likes social studies, science, and English. He’s also very athletically talented—he plays soccer, football, baseball, cross-country, and more. He’s talented, too, playing trumpet in the middle school band.\n\nMy middle child, Zachary, is in the fourth grade. He’s very talented in visual arts; he’s always drawing and creating. He finds art topics and then does research to learn about them. He draws comic books – right now, he’s really into Batman and the Joker. His favorite subject is art, of course, and he also loves Spanish.\n\nEmery, my youngest, is in the second grade. She’s a future Supreme Court justice. She’s incredibly smart, very focused on fairness and equity in the environment around her. She also loves athletics. Her favorite subjects are math and reading. She recently organized and narrated a play in her class.\n\nEach of them started at Morris Jeff in pre-K, and since that point, they each have loved their experience. They like getting up to go to school in the morning. They don’t wake up and dread it. They want to see their friends. They also want to see their teachers. My kids have each had amazing teachers year after year—really kind, highly talented, committed educators.\n\nThose great teachers are providing a strong education through the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum. IB is the academic program that children of diplomats follow in their schools worldwide. It focuses on critical thinking and connecting academic subjects. The material is rigorous, and my children thrive because of it.\n\nThe projects they do are so impressive. Aidan’s end-of-year project at the close of fifth grade was on terrorist recruitment through social media. He gave a presentation to his class. His work was complex and interesting. He was covering this important international issue and he wasn’t even in middle school yet.\n\nEmery just finished a mapping project where she made a map of our neighborhood. She had to mark significant places like schools, churches, libraries, and post offices. She did it all herself and then she had to present it to her class. Because this was part of the IB curriculum, Zachary and Aidan did the same project when they were in second grade, and it was fun to be able to look at how they each approached it.\n\nIt’s not just my children that are doing these compelling projects. Their classmates are doing great work, too, and Morris Jeff makes sure that their families can stay in the loop. Because it’s a community school, outreach and engagement is part of the Morris Jeff mission.\n\nWe have a Morris Jeff Family Partnership instead of a “parent organization” because the school knows that families look all different ways, and it takes a village! They hold family events at different times and on different days so that people can make at least one event work with their schedule.\n\nWhen I am together with other Morris Jeff families, I am reminded of just how special our community and our school really is. The idea that we can bring together kids of all different backgrounds and experiences, from all different parts of the city, and have them all learn together—that’s powerful. Morris Jeff proves that you can be a top-notch school and provide a great education without a test or geography that keeps people out.\n\nThat’s what our city needs more of. That’s what Morris Jeff is. I don’t just love it for what it provides for my children. I love it for what it gives our whole community, and I believe it is a model for what schools in New Orleans can be.\n\nMorris Jeff Community School’s PreK-8 campus is located at 211 S Lopez Street. Its high school is located at 1301 N. Derbigny Street. Enrollment for the 2020-2021 school year for Morris Jeff and nearly all New Orleans public schools is managed through EnrollNOLA; the Round Two OneApp application period will begin in March or April, after Main Round school assignments are released. You can find out more information at enrollnola.org or call or visit a Family Resource Center."
