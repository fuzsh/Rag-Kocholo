One of our key priorities in planning our regionâ€™s transportation system is providing an extensive network of bikeways and walkways to ensure biking, walking, and rolling are comfortable and convenient forms of everyday travel.\n\nGuiding the development of the SANDAG Bike Plan Early Action Program (EAP) through the year 2050, our bikeway and walkway projects have a positive impact on the quality of life in the San Diego region by reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, reducing the impact of climate change, and enhancing public health and livability.\n\nUnderstanding the Terminology\n\nSeparated bikeways are protected from vehicle lanes by a vertical element such as raised medians, on-street parking, or plastic posts.\n\nBuffered bike lanes are conventional bike lanes combined with a painted buffer that increases the distance between people on bikes and the adjacent motor vehicle travel lane and/or parking lane.\n\nTraffic calming measures benefit people riding, rolling, or walking alongside vehicle traffic. They include high-visibility crosswalks, curb extensions, rapid flashing beacons, mid-block crossings, traffic circles, and traffic signal enhancements.\n\nA two-way separated bike lane allows people riding bikes to travel in two directions on a street which may be one-way for all other vehicles.\n\nA contra-flow bike lane is a one-way bikeway where the people on bikes travel is the opposite direction of the cars in the lane next to them."
