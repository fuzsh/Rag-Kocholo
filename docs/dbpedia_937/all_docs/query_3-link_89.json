        "text": "SAN DIEGO — Dozens of volunteers spent Monday encouraging City Heights residents to vote in the primary and be counted in the census.\n\nAdvocacy organization Mid-City CAN launched a four-year campaign in 2016 to increase the number of voters from the community and to encourage participation in the 2020 census. The organization aims to build a voter block of 5,000 voters by November 2020.\n\nVolunteers spent the weekend making hundreds of phone calls and knocking on doors to educate neighbors. They will be out again on Tuesday.\n\nCity Heights is an ethnically diverse community located south of Mission Valley and north of State Route 94. Most recent census data shows a population identified as 58 percent Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, 12 percent black and 11 percent white.\n\nThere are thousands of refugees in the community from Somalia and Iraq to Vietnam. More than 49,000 of its people speak a language other than English, according to the San Diego Association of Governments.\n\n“We began this work in 2016 and since then we have been engaging our community, educating them on the power of voting and why their vote matters for their everyday life,” Griselda Ramirez, civic engagement director at Mid-City CAN, said in a press release.\n\nMid-City CAN counted more than 2,790 City Heights residents in 2018 who voted as a result of its voting campaign.\n\nAdvocates say the immigrant population in the community traditionally has been ignored by electoral campaigns.\n\nThe organization hosted a ballot and census education night last Tuesday to encourage residents to participate in the election and complete the 2020 Census.\n\nMid-City CAN is a member of the Count Me 2020, a coalition of more than 100 organizations conducting outreach to hard-to-reach populations in San Diego and Imperial counties."
