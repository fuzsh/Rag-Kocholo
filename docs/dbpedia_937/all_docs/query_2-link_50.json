        "text": "Mayor Gloria's budget is disappointing, and it seems to represent a desire to remain politically neutral rather than serve community needs. Even with the new leadership, the police budget continues to grow, now, reaching an increase of over $205 million for over the past 10 years.\n\nWe've seen this kind of budget before, we've seen it last year, and the year before that, and the year before that. The mayor can do better than this, and our community deserves better.\n\nThis budget is not enough. Do not give us crumbs and then insult us by calling it justice. We don't have enough money for more parks, but there is enough money to police the parks.\n\nOne thing that hasn't been increased, is the funding in the communities that are most impacted by police violence."
