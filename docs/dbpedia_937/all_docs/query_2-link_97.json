        "text": "Reservations may be made in person, by phone or online at mymcpl.org. No fee is charged for collaboration rooms or conference rooms, which are limited to a two-hour reservation. Larger rooms (with a maximum occupancy greater than 10) may have a cost-recovery fee. Please contact the branch regarding room costs or if you want to reserve a larger room for more than two hours. Any person using a Community Room must sign a Community Room Agreement Form.\n\nOrganizations may not, in advance, excessively book a community room. The Library shall determine what is excessive based on time and day of request and intervals between meetings.\n\nTier 1 — 1-16 people | $10 room fee + $10/hour (after two hours)\n\nTier 2 — 17-40 people | $15 room fee + $10/hour\n\nTier 3 — 40+ people | $25 room fee + $10/hour\n\nNote: Hourly room costs are per room (i.e. use of both Community Rooms 1 and 2 means the hourly room cost is $20 per hour since those are two separate rooms).\n\nAdditional Fees\n\nCost recovery fees for use of library technology and serving food in the room apply to any tier level if they are utilized:\n\nTechnology Use — $10 flat fee\n\nFood — $10 flat fee\n\nNote: The fee for food covers staff-time and costs of clean-up when food is brought into a room. Customers must still confirm what types of food are acceptable to serve in the community room and order it on their own. The library does not order food for outside groups.\n\nBranches without Meeting Rooms\n\nBranches that do not have meeting rooms waive the room fee and hourly room fee for groups of 1 – 10 people for up to 2 hours. Flat fees for technology use and food would still apply if utilized.\n\nPaying for a Room Reservation\n\nPayment for reservation fees must be made with either cash or credit card. Bills will not be issued. Payments should be made at the branch where the room is reserved and must be received before the meeting start time. Cancellations must be made three days prior to reservation in order to receive refund.\n\nNOTE:\n\nYou will receive two emails from MCPL. The first states the reservation request was received. The second approves the request. Reservation requests are pending until the reservation has been approved."
