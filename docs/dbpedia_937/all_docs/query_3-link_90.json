        "text": "By Katherine Hart, Mid-City Messenger\n\nThe City Planning Commission, going against its staff’s recommendation, has given a green light to a car wash on Tulane and South Carrollton avenues. The conditional use proposal will move to the City Council with the CPC’s recommendation to approve.\n\nThe city’s staff planners, however, found little to like in the plan for a Take 5 Car Wash. “Relative to other existing and permitted uses in this zoning district, a car wash can be expected to bring more intense levels of noise and traffic,” the CPC report states.\n\nThe car wash would wrap around the Hieux Boil Seafood House and a small retail strip, with the main entrance and exit on Tulane and a second entrance and exit on Carrollton.\n\nThe CPC staff didn’t like that the car wash tunnel — with its conveyer belt, brushes and bursts of water — would be close to the one- and two-family homes on Ulloa Street. And they didn’t like that cars waiting to get into the tunnel could back up traffic on two major thoroughfares, near the drive-thru Chick-fil-A.\n\nThey also determined that a car wash is not appropriate for that spot. The City Charter, staff planners note, requires that land-use actions be consistent with the Master Plan, which emphasizes the creation of a pedestrian-friendly environment on the Tulane corridor.\n\nThe Take 5 Car Wash would be at the edge of a mixed-use (MU-1) district, next to residential district. “The MU-1 Medium Intensity Mixed-Use District is intended to encourage walkable neighborhood centers and corridors, with a mix of residential and commercial uses,” the zoning ordinance states.\n\nWalkability is also encouraged in the area’s Enhancement Corridor Design Overlay. The development fails to meet four of the five design overlay criteria, the staff found.\n\n“By its definition, a car wash is an automobile-centric use that requires an abundance of impervious surfaces with large setbacks to accommodate parking, wash bays, and traffic circulation on site,” the CPC report states.\n\nThe Master Plan may want Tulane Avenue to be walkable, but it’s no Magazine Street, the developer’s land-use attorney, Missy Quigley of Sherman Strategies, told the commissioners at the May 23 hearing.\n\n“To me, it doesn’t look like where people are walking, shopping, talking to each other, drinking coffee,” Quigley said. “It’s across the street from Chick-fil-A, which you [the CPC] also approved recently.\n\n“We understand that the Master Plan wants this to be a walkable corridor,” she continued. “But when you go out there and you look at the reality — maybe the Master Plan needs updating because that’s not what’s happening out there.”\n\nQuigley also stated that the proposal received no opposition during the Neighborhood Participation Project meeting. The only concerns were about crime, she said.\n\nThe NPP report, however, shows that neighbors asked about walkability, stormwater runoff, litter and noise abatement as well as crime prevention.\n\nChris Davis, a local representative for Take 5’s parent company, said the developer had offered to add walkable elements such as a dog park but received pushback from neighbors. “They really didn’t want that out of concerns for congregating in the evening, drug use, crime, things like that,” he said.\n\nCrime is a major concern among neighbors, Thomas Ecker, president of the Mid-City Neighborhood Organization, told Mid-City Messenger, but it’s not the only concern.\n\n“Tulane Avenue has a history of crime, drug dealing and prostitution in the past, and those problems are beginning to redevelop,” Ecker said in an email. The area around Tulane, South Carrollton and Ulloa Street regularly shows up on NOPD and Mid-City Security District offense logs, often for violent crimes.\n\n“Without meaningful security, the location promises to be a prime epicenter of deviant activity, and MCNO has gotten feedback from those who are fearful that, through evening time, this development could exacerbate the resurgence of these problems,” Ecker stated.\n\nThe MCNO is asking for 24/7 security at the site, coupled with high-resolution low-light cameras. The CPC provisos call for a security system that includes a closed circuit camera that can capture all areas.\n\nQuigley said Take 5 is aware of the need for crime prevention measures at the site. “We’re going to have extra security,” she said, “We’re going to have extra lights, and we’re going to do everything we can to mitigate the concerns of the neighbors — which is crime, not this use [as a car wash].”\n\nNeighbors are also concerned, Ecker said, about flooding from the increased runoff due to the loss of the vacant lots’ greenspace and the heavy water usage inherent to the business.\n\n“MCNO wants assurance that the immediate sewerage infrastructure has the capacity of handling the demand,” he said. Quigley has said the stormwater plan will match code requirements and that the landscaping will include bioswales and permeable paving.\n\nNo one spoke against the development at the CPC hearing, but two neighbors wrote the CPC to urge the commissioners to vote for denial.\n\n“This corner is a prominent gateway into the Mid City neighborhood and deserves better than a large parking lot and noisy drive-thru car wash tunnel,” wrote Richard Randal, who lives two blocks away at South Pierce and Ulloa streets. “The proposed development caters to interstate traffic and does nothing for the neighborhood except encourage more traffic, noise, pollution, and crime.”\n\nThree buildings — at 4041 Tulane, 4051 Tulane and 4052 Ulloa — would need to be demolished before the car wash’s 125-foot conveyor tunnel, three pay stations, 22 vacuum bays and four parking spaces can be built. The site is in the partial-control Mid-City historic district, requiring Historic District Landmark Commission approval for demolitions.\n\nThe Tulane Avenue buildings were on the mayor’s “blight tour” in April, Quigley noted. All six properties, including three vacant lots, have racked up fines for multiple code violations over the years. Inspectors have found trash, rodents, overgrown weeds, deteriorating buildings, graffiti and other signs of blight.\n\nThe six parcels that make up the 1.2 acre site are owned by Carlo DeMatteo of Marrero, under C DeMatteo LLC. DeMatteo acquired them from 2007 to 2016.\n\nPhotos of the three buildings, as well as the repeated citations for minimum property maintenance, indicate a decline into blight under DeMatteo’s ownership. The one-story former restaurant building at 2051 Tulane was renovated after DeMatteo bought it for $125,000 in 2009, then left to deteriorate.\n\nWhen the properties, packaged together, went on the market in 2020, a realtor’s description states the three buildings were gutted and have no value. The $2.75 million price tag was based on land value only. A sale is pending.\n\nThere was no discussion before the conditional use was approved with 18 provisos. Six commissioners voted in favor of the conditional use, and one, Robert Steeg, voted against.\n\nThe Take 5 proposal needs final approval from the City Council before moving forward. The land is in Councilmember Joe Giarrusso’s district, and he has not taken a stand on the development.\n\nThe District A land-use director told Mid-City Messenger they have yet to have significant discussions with neighbors on the car wash’s potential impact."
