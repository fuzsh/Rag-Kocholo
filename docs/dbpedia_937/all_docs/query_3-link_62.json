        "text": "Self Help Graphics & Art (SHG) is coordinating a series of workshops and events aimed at youth across the state, thanks to funding from The California Endowment.\n\nOn February 21 and 28, SHG hosted the second expansion of this series in City Heights, San Diego. The SHG team worked with Mid-City CAN’s Youth Council and local artist Lorain Khalil Rihan, for two afternoons of artivism. During the workshops, Youth Council students learned to use printmaking as a tool for advocacy by pairing a symbol or image with a demand that either advocated for or protested against a cause they were passionate about.\n\nOn the first day, participants learned about the teaching artist’s practice, along with examples of different ways other artists use printmaking as a tool for activism. Then, they worked collaboratively to come up with ideas for different poster designs.\n\nOn day two, they learned how to transfer their drawings onto a carving block, carve them and hand print their designs. The themes of the posters were varied, but all of the participants connected to issues of systemic injustice that affects their communities. Some of these topics included transportation justice, domestic violence, gentrification and their ongoing local campaign that advocates for Independent Community-Led Commission on Police Practices.\n\nThank you to Ariana Federico, Youth Organizer for Mid-City CAN, for your support with the coordination of the workshop and to the Youth Council for being open to collaborating with Self Help Graphics!\n\nWatch this video created by the team at Mid-City CAN to learn more about the workshop!"
