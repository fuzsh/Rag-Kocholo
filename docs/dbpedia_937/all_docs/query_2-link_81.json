        "text": "Here are some questions we've had that may be helpful for all:\n\nCan I attend just some of the practice period? Yes! We are making this offering for you to participate to the best of your ability and availability, whatever that may be. You can take part in everything for a very rich experience, or if your circumstances don't allow, you can participate in a 1 day or 3 day sesshin (retreat), for just one or more of the classes, or even just come for the dharma talks that will be offered every Sunday.\n\nCan I attend if I can't pay the suggested donation amount? Yes! All of our offerings are offered with no expectation of a donation--any donation of money or time is always welcome and helps sustain our sangha, but no donation or particular amount is required, ever.\n\nWhat if I don't feel like I have enough experience for a full practice period? The practice period is open to anyone who wants to dive a bit deeper in their meditation and spiritual practice, no matter how much experience you have. Senior teachers will be available for one-on-one support, and there will be many opportunities to meet with other fellow students throughout.\n\nIs it too late to sign up? No, you can still sign up for any of the practice period, and you can find out more below.\n\nWhat if I have questions? Please feel free to reach out to Jon Voss, who will be serving as shuso, or head monk, for this practice period and he can help answer questions or connect you with someone who can.\n\n​\n\nPractice period is a tradition going back to the time of the Buddha, when the monks would cease their wandering in the forests and gather during the rainy season to practice together as a community. In the tradition of Japanese Zen, they tend to be three-month periods of time and are known as “ango,” which is often translated as “Peaceful abiding.” It offers an excellent opportunity for deeper study and practice.\n\n​\n\nVisiting teachers Greg Fain and Linda Galijan will be joining us in person for the practice period. They will be leading an 8 part class that helps inform our teaching and practice for the duration. The practice period will feature dharma talks every Sunday at 11am.\n\n​\n\nWe will be studying the Song of the Jewel Mirror Samadhi. This ancient Zen poem, attributed to Dongshan Liangjie (J: Tozan Ryokai), is chanted regularly in most Soto Zen temples. The Jewel Mirror Samadhi uses a kaleidoscopic series of poetic images to convey the interplay of the Absolute and the Relative. Paradoxically, the song itself also states, “the meaning is not in the words” and “just to depict it in literary form is to stain it with defilement.” Together we will investigate what Dongshan calls “the teaching of thusness,” and how this teaching can inform our lives and ease our suffering.\n\n​\n\nOur Mid City Zen spring practice period will begin on February 24 and end on April 21. We look forward to coming together as a community in peaceful abiding.\n\n​\n\nWe are asking each participant to commit to intensify your practice in whatever way you can. This might mean sitting zazen at home each day, or more study. Visiting Teachers Greg Fain and Linda Galijan will also be available for Dokusan (one-on-one practice discussions) while they are here.\n\n​"
