But last time I went to Wal-mart and ended up paying over $400. I want to get a pair of regular glasses and a pair of either veralux or transitions lenses that get darker, or prescription sunglasses.\n\nAnyone with experience with transitions or veralux lenses that darken outside? Are they really dark, or should I get the separate pair of sunglasses? I try to read outside in Florida, and need something dark.\n\n_________________________\n\nMember of the National Sarcasm Society - like we need your support!\n\nDlynn58\n\nPlatinum Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 789\n\nTexas\n\nI have a pair of transitions and I love them. They don't get quite as dark as a pair of sunglasses, but I still like them. I'm in Texas and even reading outside does not bother me with them on. I think they get dark enough.\n\nTruffle Royale\n\n10K Club\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 17,408\n\nI was advised against transitions because they don't get dark enough. Our older eyes are more sensitive to light, especially if your eyes are blue/green rather than brown.\n\nSeeing as how we're in the same state, I went to Dr. Barne's Eyemart Express with my prescription. I got prescription bi-focal sunglasses for about $150, if I remember correctly. I got a cute, lightweight plastic frame for $49 plus the lens cost. It might be higher if you go with scratch coating, etc. They've got a good guarantee too that replaced the frame when it broke, no questions asked.\n\nRetread\n\nPower Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,548\n\nSoutheast\n\nI have had progressive lenses for at least 20 years and love them. I have had both Varilux and Transitions. I prefer the Varilux, but the cost can be outrageous. I currently have Transitions and like them okay. I was asked if it bothered me that they do not darken in the car, but I told them I hadn't noticed, so I guess it doesn't. If you think it would bother you, you might want to go with the prescription sunglasses.\n\n_________________________\n\nPoliticians are like diapers.

Since I'm in Mi,( or maybe it would be on a sunny snowy day) not a real big deal but in Fl I would think it would be.\n\nNanwa\n\nPower Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 5,564\n\nClintonville, WI, USA\n\nSince I had the shingles in my eye, I am extremely sensitive to light, so I think I might get prescription sunglasses AND regular glasses with veralux.\n\nTruffle, my eyes are hazel, which means when I wear green they look green, when I wear brown, they look brown. Better than colored contacts! I think I may try that Eyemart Express. They are the only ones around here that offer two for one, so I make get some kind of break on the price.\n\n_________________________\n\nMember of the National Sarcasm Society - like we need your support!\n\nFraudman CFCI\n\nPower Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 3,189\n\nLand of Steady Habits\n\nI (eye) wear progressive bi-focal lens glasses. I was told transition lenses do not work while you are in an auto...they are UV sensitive.\n\nI have a pair of dark polarized glasses I wear while driving in sunlight and my regular glasses. Obviously, I wear them at other times, too. I purchased these from Lenscrafters.\n\nI find this works best for me and do not consider this an inconvenience.\n\nthomasj\n\nPower Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 5,063\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPolarized prescription sunglasses ROCK! I had a pair made a few years ago, and though my prescription has changed slightly, I still think I see more clearly with those polarized glasses than my regular lenses. There is something about the polarized lenses that makes them much superior to regular tinted lenses. I go to the eye doc next week and will likely get the sunglasses updated.\n\n_________________________\n\nKnowledge is knowing what to say. Wisdom is knowing when to say it."
