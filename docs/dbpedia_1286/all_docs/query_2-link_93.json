        "text": "A Lowell business dedicated to correcting vision will take part in a campaign to fight cancer.\n\nEyemart Express, located at 3916 E. Franklin Blvd., will take part in its companywide Stand Up 2 Cancer fundraiser.\n\n\"This cause is really important to us because cancer touches everyone in some way shape or form,\" said Jessica Jones, the store's office manager.\n\nEyemart Express pledges to donate $15,000 to the cause, while local stores add $5 for every pair of glasses they sell in its Stand Up 2 Cancer collection.\n\n\"The organization's goal is to help patients become long-time survivors,\" said Jones.\n\nLosing five people close to her to the disease, including her grandfather and three of her employees, inspired Jones to honor the cause not only in her store but in all of Gaston County.\n\n\"We are happy our customers have contributed to the organization but it is more than just that, it is getting the word out to the community to bring awareness,\" said Jones.\n\nThe fundraiser will continue through Saturday, Aug. 28.\n\nBeatriz Guerrero can be reached at 704-869-1828 or on Twitter@BeatrizGue_"
