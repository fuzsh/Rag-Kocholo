        "text": "As the school year comes to a close, end-of-the-year report cards can be a strong indicator of your child’s eye health. The Advanced Vision Therapy Center found that more than 25 percent of children who exhibit learning difficulties in the classroom are not able to see clearly.1 Eyemart Express, a leading optical retailer and provider of quality prescription eyewear, shares key tips to help families navigate eye care and eye wear shopping.\n\nThe importance of eye exams\n\nFortunately for busy families, a comprehensive eye exam takes only a few minutes. Kids who currently wear contact lenses should get annual eye exams to keep prescriptions current and check for eye diseases.2 Kids who wear glasses or have perfect 20/20 vision should schedule comprehensive eye exams every two years.2\n\n“Vision health should be part of the healthy lifestyle conversation because the eyes are linked to so many parts of the body,” says Dr. Tom Patera, Eyemart Express senior executive vice president of professional affairs. “Online eye screenings may be convenient for many families, but they should not be a substitute for an eye exam. A vision screening app on a cell phone or tablet may miss red flags than an optometrist would easily identify,” he adds.\n\nTips to find the right glasses for kids\n\nFor kids who need corrective eyewear, shopping for glasses can be an exciting adventure. The following tips can help you find the right glasses for your kids.\n\nDon’t overlook the lens. From the playground to gym class to after-school sports, kids can be rough on glasses. Consider polycarbonate lenses. In addition to being impact resistant, they’re also lightweight, which can help your kids feel comfortable wearing their glasses every day.\n\nShop from a wide selection of frames. With thousands of frames to choose from, even the pickiest kids can find a pair of glasses they’ll love. Popular collections for young children include My Little Pony, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Transformers, while chic frames in fun colors by GEEK give older kids a trendy look. Athletic safety glasses are also available for kids who play sports like soccer, baseball, and tennis.\n\nPay attention to the fit. The secret to achieving a perfect fit depends on the lens diameter, bridge width, and temple length. Look for expertly trained associates who can provide individualized attention to ensure a proper fit.\n\nYou may be able to go home with a new pair of glasses in one day. Gone are the days of having to wait a week to wear new glasses. Busy families preparing for summer activities and vacations can take advantage of businesses like Eyemart Express, who offer in-store labs and fast service. In fact, ninety percent of glasses purchased from Eyemart Express stores are delivered on the same day."
