        "text": "When it comes to eyewear, glasses are no longer just there to help you see better — they're a fashion statement.\n\nTwo new eyewear retail stores have opened in Fort Collins. The Looking Glass(es) is a family-owned, independent boutique store. Eyemart Express is part of a growing national chain.\n\nThe Looking Glass(es)\n\nThe Looking Glass(es), owned and operated by Kendra Apodaca, sources her glasses frames from smaller, U.S. companies and works with a family-owned lab that makes the lenses.\n\n\"There are a lot of private optometrists that charge a lot for glasses,\" said Apodaca, whose store is at 2601 S. Lemay Ave., Suite 17, in the Scotch Pines shopping center.\n\nLarge chains \"charge pennies for something made in bulk in China. There is nothing in between for high-quality, affordable, boutique eyewear.\"\n\nShe hopes to fill that \"in-between\" niche with a boutique that views eyeglasses as a fashion accessory. Shopping for glasses can be \"something fun to do, like shopping for shoes,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to traditional frames, The Looking Glass(es) sells frames made from recycled materials, vintage frames and designer frames from smaller companies. \"It is our constant endeavor to carry as many American-made frames as possible,\" she said. \"If we don't have that perfect frame in stock ... chances are we can probably get it.\"\n\nApodaca has a \"pay-it-forward\" program that allows customers to buy a basic pair of glasses at cost and place them on a \"suspended\" board. Others who are in need can redeem the suspended eyeglass orders.\n\n\"We encourage every recipient of suspended eyewear to pay it forward in some fashion later on, whether through small acts of kindness or giving to someone else.\"\n\nHer store does not have an optometrist on staff and does not perform eye exams, nor does it accept vision insurance, but customers can submit claims to their own insurance as out-of-network.\n\nThe Looking Glass(es) is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturdays.\n\nEyemart Express\n\nEyemart Express, a national chain with 188 stores in 36 states, opened its first store in Fort Collins in November, buying out Vision Eyeland at 1820 S. College Ave.\n\nVision Eyeland was part of the optometry practice of Drs. Michael and Eric Torgerson, who sold the dispensary to Eyemart Express, said Laura Ladd, general manager of Eyemart Express. Their optometry practice remains.\n\nThe store features an on-site lab so 90 percent of glasses, including progressive lenses, bifocals and trifocals, can be ordered and received the same day.\n\n“We are excited to offer Fort Collins residents a time-saving optical solution with our same-day glasses,” said Michael Bender, Eyemart Express chief executive officer and president.\n\nEyemart Express offers 10 percent discounts for active, non-active and retired military personnel and families, and a 20 percent discount for Poudre School District employees — including teachers, coaches, bus drivers, janitors and others — with a valid school ID.\n\nThe store is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays."
