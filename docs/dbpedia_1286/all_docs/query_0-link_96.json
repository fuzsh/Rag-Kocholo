        "text": "A Dallas-based optical retailer is expanding into new markets.\n\nEyemart Express plans to increase its footprint by opening 25 locations and completing expansion into four new states â Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming â by the end of this year. The company currently owns and operates 206 stores in 38 states, ranking among the largest optical retailers in the country.\n\nEyemart Express said it carries more than 2,000 high-quality, fashionable, and low-cost frames for prescription glasses and sunglasses. Frames range from exclusive private label brands to brands such as Converse, Longchamp, Calvin Klein, Ray-Ban and Nike. Onsite labs allow 90% of glasses to be delivered on the same day.\n\n\"The drive behind our aggressive growth strategy is to make prescription eyewear accessible and convenient for more communities,\" said Michael Bender, CEO, Eyemart Express. \"Seeing clearly should not be a burden or an excessive expense for any family. We work hard to make all our locations an affordable one-stop shop for all eyewear needs.\""
