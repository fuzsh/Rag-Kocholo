        "text": "Brought 2 pair of glasses on Saturday when I got home I realized that I just didn’t like the one pair (that was recommended to me),the shape ,the look ,the color ,all wrong for me. My wife called on Monday early and they weren’t very nice or helpful to her , I called them myself a few hours later . The lady said “didn’t your wife already call “ she went on to say how the same pair in a different color was ordered and they will call me when they come in . Have I just wasted my hard earned money while yet another corporate conglomerate gets even richer , it seems so !!!!!\n\nHello everyone! Let me start by saying that my wife absolutely loves this place! The pricing cannot be beat! The customer service is unparalleled. So, let's just stop for a moment to talk about my most recent experience. My wife and I took my mother in law to get eye glasses. She was hesitant from the start because she thought that the price would be too much. We spent next to nothing in comparison with the counterparts like Sears and JCPennys. She was estatic to have her new glasses and might I add they look amazing. So..... when I go places customer service either makes or breaks the deal for me. Customer service is much more important to me then price or sometimes even quality simply, their customer service has continued to be fantastic. I have purchased several sets of glasses and have received only great service. JESSICA..... that woman has a way with people. She needs to be commended and as soon as I realized that I had a voice in the matter I could not wait to express my feelings about this place. Jessica makes you feel at home from the start, she listens to what you are looking for, makes suggestions but is not too pushy, and makes sure that you leave a satisfied customer. Kudos to eye mart and even bigger kudos to Jessica...... if any of you happen to read this go ask for her.... I promise you will be happy that you did!\n\nI purchased my first pair on December 23, 2016 and they bothered my eyes to the point I returned them to the store. Jessica assisted me in exchanging my initial purchase with a new frame. She advised the frame I had didn't fit the bifocal very well. Additionally the measurements were off which created my problem with the initial pair.\n\nJessica was amazing and assisted me picking out a frame for a better fit. I suggest when you do visit Eyemart Express to see Jessica."
