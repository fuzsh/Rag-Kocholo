        "text": "If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve seen plenty of advertisements for Pair Eyewear‚Äîyou know, the magnetic glasses that let you pop on different front plates to achieve new looks. They seemed cool, but I‚Äôve never been one to trust anything I see plastered all over social media, so I passed.\n\nFast forward a year or so, and I was getting headaches while working. I figured my prescription had changed, so it was finally time to drag myself back to the eye doctor.\n\nUnfortunately, waiting five years between appointments got me booted from their patient roster, so I had to look around. I ended up going to someone who had a practice inside of‚Äîbut was not affiliated with‚Äîan Eyemart Express. Seems convenient, right? Waltz out the door and browse a bigger selection than most doctor‚Äôs offices have on hand. Plus, they have coupons!\n\nCue my *second disappointment. The people who worked there didn‚Äôt so much as grunt in my general direction. As an anxiety-riddled introvert, this seemed like a sign to bolt and order online. That‚Äôs when visions of cute, changeable frames danced in my head‚Ä¶\n\nAfter an excessive amount of research, I decided to go with Pair‚Äîand I‚Äôm so glad I did! Check out my review below:\n\nHow It Works\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Pair\n\nThe Process\n\nHow to Get $25 USD Off\n\n* My third disappointment was the fact that Eyemart Express used to be a Blockbuster Video. Kicked right straight in the ol' nostalgia!\n\nHow It Works\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Pair\n\nThe Good\n\nThey strive to be affordable. A standard pair of single-vision prescription glasses runs about $60 USD. This includes superhydrophobic, anti-reflective, and scratch-resistant treatments. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôve never gotten a decent pair of glasses that inexpensively, and I‚Äôve worn glasses since... well, the days of Blockbuster.\n\nNote: If the price point triggers a ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù alarm in your head, don‚Äôt worry. Pair explains, rather candidly, on their website that the eyewear industry is dominated by a single company that has been able to keep prices artificially high for years. By designing their own products in-house, Pair circumvents those traditional channels to provide eyewear at a fraction of the price.\n\nPair has something for everyone. Literally. In addition to single-vision, reader, and progressive lenses, they offer clear lenses, polarized sunglass lenses, and blue-light lenses for those who don't require a prescription.\n\nBut what do I really love? For every pair of glasses purchased, Pair provides glasses to a child in need via Eyelliance. Learn more here: https://paireyewear.com/pages/giving-back\n\nThe Not-So-Good\n\nThey have an unfavorable rating from the Better Business Bureau. After perusing the complaints, most of them seem to revolve around technical issues and customer service‚Äîboth of which, I can understand to an extent.\n\nPair‚Äôs website did experience an error when I uploaded my prescription, causing a delay in my order. The good news is, because uploading at the time of purchase is optional, their customer service team reached out for those details prior to processing my order. It wasn‚Äôt a huge deal.\n\nThat said, if you need to reach out to them, prepare for a lengthy wait. I don't know if it's a result of them becoming a viral sensation \"overnight\" and they aren't able to keep up or what. I'm hopeful they'll be able to find their stride soon.\n\nThe Process\n\nStep 1: Choose your base frame.\n\nThey have a handful of styles for men, women, and children. For the purposes of this review, I‚Äôll walk you through my selections, starting with the women‚Äôs section:\n\nThe website allows you to further refine those choices with filters, e.g. frame width (extra-narrow, narrow, medium, wide), shape (cat-eye, round, rectangular), and color. I selected:\n\nWide\n\nCat-eye\n\nClear\n\nThis narrowed my choices down to one beautiful style: The Wanda.\n\nThe Wanda comes in Pink Clear, Blue Clear, Black, Crystal Clear, Tortoise, and Blue Tortoise. I opted for Crystal Clear, because I didn't want to risk clashing with future top frames. (More about tops below.)\n\nI should add, I did the virtual try-on in every style and color first, but I have elected to spare you my face. Let‚Äôs move on to the sizing guide. LOL\n\nStep 2: Choose your top frames (optional).\n\nThis is the fun part. You know those magnetic front plates I referred to earlier? They‚Äôre called Top Frames (or simply, tops/toppers). Generally, they run $25-30 each and fall into three categories:\n\nCollections: Sun Tops, Classic Colors, Classic Designs, Sparkle, and Special Occasion.\n\nLimited Edition: As of this posting, 4th of July, Love Wins, Glow-in-the-Dark, Sun Changing, and Summer Vacation lines are featured. Previously this year, they had things like Tiki, Mural Arts, Neon Brights, United with Ukraine, Nautical, Happy Spring, etc. From what I‚Äôve seen, Pair adds new limited editions each month and they don't last all that long before selling out. (I wanted the teal dogs so badly, but they sold out before I was ready to order. üò¢)\n\nCollabs: Van Gogh, Harry Potter, DC, Marvel, Sesame Street, MLB, NBA, and NHL.\n\nFor my first order, I went with a few simple colors to match various outfits: The Black Sparkle and The Navy, along with The Silver Sparkle Sun Top. Then, before I checked out, I convinced myself I needed a fun color and added The Mint Sparkle. LOL It‚Äôs safe to assume that for all foreseeable holidays, I‚Äôll be putting a themed frame top on my list‚Ä¶\n\nFun tip: You can stack your tops, if you like. So, if you get a pair of sun tops and want to change the outer frame, you can always stack another top over it!\n\nStep 3: Select your prescription type and add-ons.\n\nSingle-Vision: Scratch-resistant, anti-reflective prescription lenses for basic vision correction\n\nThis is what I need, for now.\n\nProgressives: Correct near, intermediate, and distance fields of vision in one lens ‚Äî a modern alternative to bifocals or trifocals (+$199)\n\nI don‚Äôt need these yet, but my sister does. I like to tease her about it, because I‚Äôm the younger sibling. üòá\n\nReaders: Scratch-resistant and anti-reflective lenses that offer simple magnification for reading (no prescription necessary)\n\nThis would be an idea for, say, my mother who only needs drugstore glasses for reading.\n\nNon-Prescription: Scratch-resistant and anti-reflective lenses\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine myself making this particular purchase, but I know there are people who enjoy wearing glasses as a fashion statement.\n\nPremium Plus: Pair's most ultra-thin and lightweight lenses. 1.67 high-index lenses are recommended for complex prescriptions. (+$59)\n\nI wasn‚Äôt looking to spend more than I had to, but this was necessary for my particular prescription.\n\nBlue Light Filtering: Recommended for spending time in front of computers, phones, iPads or TVs. (+$49)\n\nI had recently read an article on blue light that convinced me I didn‚Äôt need to justify this expense.\n\nLight Responsive: Lenses transition from clear to a darker tint when they are outside. (+$149)\n\nHonestly, I‚Äôm just not a fan of these. Some people can rock it, though!\n\nSunglass Lens: Polarized, scratch-resistant lenses that block 100% of UV rays. (+$99)\n\nI had just added sun tops to my order, so this wasn‚Äôt something I needed to consider.\n\nNote: I looked up in their FAQs that they can also accommodate prism lenses. (+$60)\n\nStep 4: Proceed to check-out.\n\nHere, you have a chance to review your order and are given the option to purchase a 1-year warranty that covers scratched lenses or damaged frames. They mention it only covers the cost of the base frame. Any lens add-ons will need to be repurchased with the replacement Pair.\n\nI passed. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nNext, Pair gives you options on how to send them your prescription:\n\nRemind me later: No problem. Place your order now and get reminded later.\n\nUpload a photo: A photo of your prescription is perfect!\n\nHave us contact your doctor: Enter in your eye doctor‚Äôs info, and Pair will reach out to obtain your prescription.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I uploaded a photo and it didn‚Äôt work out. If I were you, I would choose one of the other two options. Also, you will need your pupillary distance. A lot of optometrists don‚Äôt include this in your paperwork‚Äîmine didn‚Äôt‚Äîbut thankfully, it‚Äôs something you can measure at home.\n\nPair has a digital tool you can use (https://paireyewear.com/pages/new-pd) or, if you‚Äôre like me, you can just hold up a ruler and ask a friend. Zenni Optical has a helpful guide for this: https://www.zennioptical.com/measuring-pd-infographic. (Sorry, Pair. I know Zenni is your competition, but they had a better resource.)\n\nAt this point, you‚Äôre reminded of your purchase benefits:\n\nFrame case and lens cloth\n\nFree standard shipping and free returns\n\n30-day risk-free trial\n\nFSA & HSA eligible or insurance reimbursement\n\nThen, of course, you have the standard ads for impulse purchases, i.e. cleaning kits, glasses cases, etc. Just a week or two ago, they introduced wall hangers that are admittedly a pretty cool way to keep your top frames displayed safely.\n\nPersonally, I use a galvanized metal sign on my wall. I‚Äôve seen other people in the community use their refrigerators, cookie sheets, metal rulers‚Äîanything the magnets will stick to. There‚Äôs room to be creative.\n\nHow to Get $25 Off\n\nWhen I ordered, I got 10% off from signing up for the newsletter. Now that I‚Äôve made my purchase, I‚Äôm able to pass on a $25 off discount to friends and family‚Äîwhich is basically a free frame top!\n\nI'm slightly jealous, but Pair has made referrals a win, win. If you make your first purchase via my link, I get a credit toward my next top frame, too! Did I mention how spectacular you look today? ü•∞\n\nTL;DR (‚ÄúToo Long; Didn‚Äôt Read‚Äù Summary)\n\n‚ñ∏ Affordable glasses that allow me to express myself? Yes, please!\n\n‚ñ∏ Use my referral code RAF4F892FSP to get $25 off!\n\nüëì Do you wear glasses? üëì"
