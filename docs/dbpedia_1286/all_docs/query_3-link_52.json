        "text": "There are a number of ways to buy eyeglasses, including from local opticians, independent optometrists, optical departments in big-box retailers, and online-only vendors. Regardless of the option you choose, the good news is that prescription eyeglasses do not have to cost hundreds of dollars.\n\nIn this article, I look at the cost of eye exams and prescription eyeglasses from eight optical retailers to help you make your own comparisons and confident decision for the best place to buy eyeglasses.\n\nIn-Store or Online?\n\nThere are two ways you can purchase prescription eyeglasses—in person or online.\n\nBest Eyeglasses In-Store\n\nCostco Optical is definitely worth visiting if you’re more comfortable ordering frames in-person, which is the traditional way, and you’re a Costco member. Costco Optical is hands-down my #1 pick for in-store optical services. Not a member? You can join here.\n\nCostco Optical customer service is extraordinary much like you’d find at the offices of an independent doctor of optometry. The big difference is not only how much money you save at Costco but also the top-notch service after the sale. If you’re not happy, Costco gives you your money back unless prohibited by state law.\n\nBest Eyeglasses Online\n\nI have been a customer of Zenni Optical website for a number of years and still find this to be the best place to buy prescription eyeglasses and sunglasses. Several times I have seen my eye doctor for a routine exam, and then gone prescription in hand to Zenni online to select and purchase the eyeglasses. It’s easy.zenni\n\nBasic frames with prescription lenses start as low as $6.95 with $4.95 shipping in 7 to 14 business days. You can try on frames using the virtual try-on tool (it’s so slick how that works!). With its great prices and customer service, Zenni is the best place to buy eyeglasses online.\n\nBest Overall\n\nMy research shows that Zenni and Costco Optical (more on both below) are the best places to buy eyeglsses. But they aren’t the only eyeglasses providers worth your consideration.\n\n8 Best Places To Buy Eyeglasses\n\nThere are a number of things to consider before you decide where to buy glasses, such as the quality of frames, accuracy of lenses, customer service, total price including shipping, the return and refund policies, and accessibility. Using these criteria and my research, here are eight of the best places to order eyeglasses.\n\nAs you will see, some starting costs for single-vision lenses are $0. At these retailers, the cost of single-vision plastic lenses is included in the cost of the frames.\n\nBelow, you’ll find details on each retailer including details about the selection, how to shop for the best deals, and how to place an order online.\n\n1. Costco Optical\n\nEye Exam Cost: $79 on average\n\nFrames start at: $120\n\nBest for: Customer service and quality\n\nIf you’re a Costco member, you’ll find great prices on frames, lenses, and accessories at Costco Optical compared to other eyeglasses shops and optometrists’ offices. Plus, the warehouse earns exceptional marks on price, follow-up service, quality of frames and lenses, and more from untold numbers of satisfied members. You join Costco online, however, you should know that you will need to activate your new membership in a Costco store. And you’ll get a Costco Shop Card as a welcome gift.\n\nCostco Optical employs independent doctors of optometry whose offices are located within the store or next to it in most states. Anyone can get an eye exam at Costco and visit the eye doctor. And Costco accepts most health insurance plans.\n\nCostco doesn’t offer the lowest possible price on prescription glasses. You’ll find lower prices at online stores such as Zenni or EyeBuyDirect. Even so, the overall quality of frames, lenses, and buying experience may be well worth the extra cost. If you’re more comfortable talking to a real person and trying on frames in person, Costco is a great place to get a quality eye exam and complete optical services.\n\n2. ZenniOptical.com\n\nEye Exam Cost: N/A\n\nFrames start at: $6.95\n\nBest for: Cheapest eyeglasses overall\n\nZenni Optical is an industry disruptor when it comes to buying eyeglasses. The online-only store offers the absolute cheapest prices on plastic frames and includes the cost of single-vision plastic lenses in those prices Progressive lenses are surprisingly affordable.\n\nDespite the crazy low price, Zenni Optical has maintained a good reputation and quality customer service.\n\nAt Zenni, you’ll find a wide range of frame styles and lens options available, and it’ll be easy to place an order through their website. You can expect your glasses to ship for $4.95. They say they usually take 3-5 business days to arrive.\n\nI should note that while in the past Zenni had fallen short for its customer service, the company has really stepped it up in recent years. I have never had a problem, and in fact once when I needed to make a return when the frames did not fit well, Zenni replaced my purchase quickly with no questions asked and absolutely no problem. Zenni’s customer service is excellent.\n\n3. Warby Parker\n\nEye Exam Cost: Beginning at $75\n\nFrames start at: $95\n\nBest for: Selection and style\n\nWarby Parker is an excellent choice for buying glasses both online at WarbyParker.com or in-person at one of its stores. There are lots of choices for both men and women and kids, too. Plus, you get free shipping.\n\nIf you aren‘t sure which type of glasses you want, you can take Warby’s style quiz. Warby Parker offers home try-on, which lets you select five frames to test them out for five days for free. Make your selections, then watch your mailbox. However, my experience is that the most popular styles are not available for this at-home 5-day test option, so be prepared for that. When you buy a pair of glasses from Warby Parker, the company will donate a pair of eyeglasses to someone in need.\n\nSome Warby Parker locations offer eye examinations for $75-$120 per visit. While the prices aren’t necessarily the cheapest available, if you’re looking for convenience and customer service, consider Warby Parker.\n\n4. EyeBuyDirect.com\n\nEye Exam Cost: N/A\n\nFrames start at: $6\n\nBest for: Selecting new glasses online\n\nOnce you have a valid medical prescription from your eye doctor and you’re looking for the best prices, you can save a lot of money by shopping at Eyebuydirect.\n\nYou can take the style quiz when you first visit the website to get some suggestions. You can also click on the heart icon next to the ones you want to buy so that you can easily see them again later. And, like Warby Parker, for every pair that you purchase, another pair is donated to someone in need.\n\nCheck out the promotions on the website to see if there are any discounts. Students and veterans get an additional 20% off. New subscribers may also receive a welcome bonus so look for discounts and free shipping on your first purchase.\n\n5. Sam’s Club Optical Center\n\nEye Exam Cost: $73 on average\n\nFrames start at: $59\n\nBest for: Low cost for both exam and eyeglasses\n\nReviewers regularly give Sam’s Club Optical above-average scores in six out of seven categories including follow-up service, customer service, and quality. Sam’s Club Optical offers one of the cheapest average prices on eye exams as well as good prices on frames.\n\nLike Costco, you need a membership to buy glasses from Sam’s Club, but anyone can make an appointment with the eye doctor. You can visit your nearest Sam’s Club Optical location in person to order your glasses or unlike Costco Optical, you can place your order online.\n\nSam’s Club doesn’t provide a lot of information online about its optical centers. While you’ll find great prices on frames and lenses in-store, you won’t be able to see the available selection or estimate the cost by shopping online. So this option may be more beneficial if you are a Sam’s Club member.\n\n6. Walmart Vision Center\n\nEye Exam Cost: $88 on average\n\nFrames start at: $9\n\nBest for: Convenient locations\n\nIf you live near a Walmart Vision Center, this could be another good place to shop for glasses. You’ll find a huge selection of frame styles and colors at competitive prices, and they’re available both online and in-store.\n\nWalmart Vision Center has been the primary optical center for a number of EC Readers who report that they have always had great experiences. Even so, while Walmart offers low prices available on select frames, there are better prices on higher quality frames with better selections elsewhere.\n\nThe big draw for you is convenience, you will definitely find great deals at Walmart. And it’s good to know that the vision center accepts most major insurance plans for eye exams and in-store purchases.\n\n7. Target Optical\n\nEye Exam Cost: $90 on average\n\nFrames start at: $50\n\nBest for: Checking vision insurance online\n\nYou may find that Target Optical is an even more convenient choice for you, where you can find a wide selection of styles and lens options. Just know that you won’t find the lowest prices available. Target RedCard holders are eligible to get a 5% discount on Target Optical products.\n\nIn addition to offering eye exams with qualified professionals, a unique feature with Target Optical is that you can check your insurance benefits online. Target accepts 50 different insurance plans, and you can enter your personal and plan information online to check your eligibility.\n\n8. America’s Best Eyeglasses\n\nEye Exam Cost: $50\n\nFrames start at: $29.95\n\nBest for: Cheapest eye exam\n\nIf you’re looking for a great deal on simple prescription lenses in plastic frames or a cheap eye exam, you may find America’s Best to be your best option. However, if you listen to customer reviews, getting your eyes checked at Sam’s Club and buying your glasses at Zenni may leave you happier in the long run—a combination lots of reviewers recommend.\n\nWhile an exam by an eye doctor at America’s Best Eyeglasses is typically $50 and glasses start at $69.95 a pair, America’s Best offers a deal including two pairs of glasses plus an eye exam for $79.95 total. You could look at that like way: Two pairs of glasses for $34.98 each, with a free eye examination.\n\nGood to Know\n\nThe cheap prices from online retailers can be very enticing. Just keep in mind that if you order from a site like Zenni Optical or EyeBuyDirect, you’ll first need to get your vision checked by an eye doctor to get an updated prescription. Note that prices quoted above were in effect at the time of publishing, but may have changed in the meantime.\n\nYou’ll also need to find out your pupillary distance (PD), which is the space between the centers of your pupils, expressed in millimeters. Certain frames will not work with certain PDs because the center of the lenses will either be too wide or too narrow. You need a fit that’s just right.\n\nIf your PD is already noted on your prescription, you are good to go. If not, many doctors will provide this information upon request.\n\nUnder the Federal Trade Commission’s Eyeglass Rule, doctors must:\n\nGive you a prescription for glasses at the end of your exam\n\nNot require an extra fee or sign a waiver in exchange for the prescription\n\nNot require that you buy your glasses from the eye doctor to get your prescription\n\nIn some states, your doctor is also required to give you your pupillary distance (PD). You can always ask for this even if it isn’t included in your prescription. If all else fails and you have a doctor who is just not cooperating, you can follow Zenni’s guide or EyeBuyDirect’s guide on how to measure your PD at home.\n\nEverydayCheapskate is reader-supported.
