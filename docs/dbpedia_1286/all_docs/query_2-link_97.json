        "text": "The Importance of Eye Exams\n\nYou rely on your eyesight to connect to your surroundings and help you navigate day-to-day life. As a result, taking care of your eye health is essential. Eye exams play a significant role in eye care because they can measure your sight, help you detect potential eye diseases, and preserve your vision.\n\nWhile eye exams are important for ensuring that vision prescriptions are up to date, they can also be useful for preventive maintenance regardless of your eye health. In some cases, people may not be aware of their eye issues due to a lack of symptoms. An optical exam can help facilitate early intervention and minimize further or permanent damage.\n\nAside from vision problems, an optical exam can also help detect other health conditions. The eyes offer a non-invasive view of the natural state of your blood vessels. During an exam, the eye doctor can identify changes in your blood vessels, which can help detect and diagnose diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and high cholesterol.\n\nChildren\n\nWhen it comes to eye care, early detection is the name of the game—and that extends to all ages. For children aged 3 or younger, examining their eyes early helps avoid the most common childhood eye complications, such as:\n\nLazy Eye\n\nMisaligned Eyes\n\nCross-Eyes\n\nAdditionally, having their eyes examined again before their first year of kindergarten ensures that poor vision won’t get in the way of their education.\n\nEye Exam Frequency for All Ages\n\nBeyond the critical milestones above, adding eye checkups to your regular health routine is essential. Here are various eye exam frequency recommendations based on different age groups according to the American Optometric Association:\n\nAge 3-5: Children aged 3 to 5 should go for an examination at least once between those ages or as recommended if they are at-risk patients.\n\nAge 6-17: An eye exam should be done at least once before the first grade and annually throughout. At-risk patients should go as recommended.\n\nAge 18-39: Adults between 18 and 39 should take an eye and vision exam at least once every two years. The exams should be annual or as recommended if they are at risk of specific conditions.\n\nAge 40-64: This age group has the same recommended examination frequency as the 18-to-39-year-old group or as recommended for at-risk patients.\n\nAge 65 and older: Adults 65 or over are advised to have annual eye exams or as recommended when they are at risk.\n\nAt-risk patients have underlying issues that can affect eye health, such as potential ocular disease or previous eye surgery. Depending on your prescription and condition, your provider will inform you if you are at risk and recommend the ideal eye examination frequency.\n\nEye exams include various tests depending on your reason for scheduling. The tests determine whether you need glasses or lenses, check for general eye problems, or assess your overall health. During a routine eye vision exam for a simple prescription update, there is usually a health evaluation focusing on each eye, checking muscles, blood vessels, dilation response, and synchronization with the other eye.\n\nIn addition, a few standard tests may also be included in a routine optical exam, including:\n\nVisual acuity: The well-known vision test (a Snellen Test) has big lettering near the top and small lettering near the bottom. The test helps determine optical clarity and sharpness.\n\nRefraction: The assessment involves looking through a device called the phoropter or refractor and focusing each eye on an eye chart. Visual refraction tests are done to figure out the prescription lens that can help improve your vision.\n\nVisual field test: This type of test is designed to measure peripheral vision and detect blind spots. It entails identifying moving objects from the corner of your eyes while you focus on an object straight ahead.\n\nAn eye appointment can include other tests that examine specific issues with the eyes. However, if it is a routine visit, your provider will quickly review the results with you, and you’ll leave the appointment in no time with a new prescription in hand.\n\nEyemart Express partners* with skilled eye doctors to ensure there is always a professional in your area.
