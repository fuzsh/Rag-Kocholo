Eclipse glasses, and eclipse viewers, block out 100% of harmful ultra-violet rays, 100% of infrared, and 99.999% of intense visible light, protecting your eyes and letting you view these spectacular natural phenomena. Eclipse viewing glasses allow you to view the sun in its natural orange color. It is important that solar eclipse viewer glasses offer the highest levels of eclipse eye protection. Many other products, and do-it-yourself designs, do not provide full protection from the harmful rays. Our eclipse shades include instructions printed directly on the frames to remind users to wear them during all portions of the eclipse. Our safe solar eclipse glasses are independently tested, and CE certified. These paper eclipse glasses are essential for safe viewing of this solar event.\n\nBig Things Coming in 2023 and 2024!\n\nOn August 21, 2017, millions of Americans witnessed the moon passing between the Earth and Sun, in a total eclipse.

In addition to a big annular solar eclipse in 2023, there will be a 2024 total solar eclipse that will cross Mexico, the central and eastern United States, and portions of Canada. Itâ€™s never too early to prepare for these rare events!\n\nWhere to Buy Eclipse Glasses\n\nAre you looking to buy eclipse glasses for your school, planetarium, science center, or special event?
