        "text": "According to The Vision Council of America, approximately 164 million Americans wear eyeglasses. Additionally, the average consumer reports spending nearly $130 for their frames, and almost 40% of wearers have two or more pairs of glasses.\n\nConsidering how expensive glasses are and the fact that they’re a necessity, it’s unsurprising it’s a $170 billion industry worldwide.\n\nThankfully, there are ways to save money on contact lenses and glasses if you know where and how to shop. Like many industries, online retailers make it easier to find high-quality prescription glasses at affordable prices. Plus, there are affordable in-store eyewear options if you know where to look.\n\nWhere to Buy Affordable Eyeglasses\n\nHere are the top retailers offering great deals on affordable eyewear online:\n\nGlassesUSA\n\nWarby Parker\n\nEyeBuyDirect\n\nZenni Optical\n\nEyeconic\n\nEyebobs\n\nCostco Optical\n\nSam’s Club Optical\n\n39DollarGlasses\n\nDiscountGlasses.com\n\nLensabl\n\nFelix Gray\n\nSwanwick\n\n1. GlassesUSA\n\nLimited Time Offer: Save 50% on frames for eyeglasses and sunglasses with basic Rx lenses + free shipping to your doorstep. Some exclusions apply. Shop at GlassesUSA.com and use coupon code MONEY-CRASHERS-50 at checkout.\n\nGlassesUSA is one of the most affordable ways to buy eyeglasses online and also carries contact lenses and sunglasses, but prescription eyewear is where this website shines.\n\nFrames\n\nIf you shop on clearance, you can get frames up to 60% off and 25% off prescription lenses.\n\nGlassesUSA carries a range of brands and frame styles for adults and kids, including designer name-brand glasses like Ray-Ban, Coach, Oakley, and Givenchy. Use coupon code MONEYCRASHERS40 at checkout to save 40% on select adult designer frames, including Gucci, Prada, and Versace.\n\nYou can also buy blue-light-blocking glasses for any prescription for $29 extra. These glasses have lenses that filter emissions from electronic devices, reducing eyestrain.\n\nOnce you select a frame style, you can use a virtual mirror to see how the glasses suit your face shape. This feature requires uploading a photo or using your webcam. If you’re happy with the frame, choose your new lens type and submit your prescription before ordering. You can provide your prescription manually or upload a photo.\n\nFrames start at $19 on clearance. Regular frames start at $39 but can range to several hundred dollars for designer pairs.\n\nLens Pricing\n\nSingle Vision: Included in frame pricing\n\nNear Vision: Included in frame pricing\n\nProgressive: $94 and up\n\nBifocal: $99 and up\n\nNonprescription: Included in frame pricing\n\nYou can also upgrade your lens package if you want to add coatings for scratch resistance, ultraviolet (UV) protection, and antireflection. It costs approximately $10 to $30 more to upgrade bifocal lenses to the thinnest, highest-quality lenses. Upgrading progressive lenses costs an additional $20 to $60.\n\nFinally, you can upgrade to transition lenses for $149 or buy prescription sunglass lenses with a color tint for an additional $29 or a mirrored tint for $49.\n\nInsurance\n\nGlassesUSA works with numerous vision insurance providers, including United Healthcare, Cigna, Davis Vision, Aetna, and Humana. You can also refer friends to GlassesUSA for a free Amazon gift card ($10), and the person you refer gets 10% off their first order.\n\nShipping\n\nFor shipping, U.S. and Canadian orders are free. Most prescriptions take three to four business days to process. If you don’t like your glasses, you can return them for free within 14 days of arrival. This return policy makes GlassesUSA a risk-free way to buy eyeglasses online.\n\nShop GlassesUSA Now\n\n2. Warby Parker\n\nUnlike most online eyeglass retailers, Warby Parker sells both online and in dozens of retail locations throughout the U.S. and Canada. Warby Parker isn’t the cheapest option for everyday eyewear, but if you’re looking for designer quality and affordability, Warby Parker is still a contender.\n\nFrames & Lens Pricing\n\nPrescription eyeglasses start at $95 for adults, and this price includes single-vision lenses. Progressive lenses are an additional $200. Lenses are scratch-resistant, antireflective, and have UV protection. You can upgrade to blue-light-protective lenses for $50 or add transition lenses for $100.\n\nWarby Parker also carries prescription sunglasses that start at $195 for single-vision lenses. Sunglasses with progressive lenses cost $375.\n\nShipping & Returns\n\nOrders have free shipping and returns. You can also book an eye exam, including a contact lens fitting, for $75.\n\nWarby Parker is certainly more expensive than websites like EyeBuyDirect. However, if you see how Warby Parker glasses are made, the price makes sense. Every frame is hand-assembled and polished and uses premium materials.\n\nIf you’re not satisfied with your pair, you have 30 days to return them for a full refund or exchange. You also have a one-year no-scratch guarantee for all eyewear.\n\nWarby Parker can also replace your lenses if your prescription changes. Replacement fees vary depending on your prescription and the lenses you select, and this service is only available for Warby Parker frames.\n\nBut Warby Parker goes beyond virtual try-ons that the other websites use. Simply complete a short home try-on quiz, pick five frames you’re considering, and get them shipped to your home. When you find the right fit, finish your purchase online and ship the frames back to Warby Parker for free. Warby Parker ships to customers in the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico, and Canada.\n\nIf you want to buy quality eyeglasses while on a budget, Warby Parker is an excellent choice. The prices won’t compete with the cheapest eyeglass options, but with Warby Parker, you get what you pay for.\n\nInsurance\n\nAdditionally, Warby Parker partners with 10 vision insurance providers, so your purchase might be eligible for coverage.\n\nShop Warby Parker Now\n\n3. EyeBuyDirect\n\nEyeBuyDirect is another affordable option to buy eyeglasses online. It’s a worthwhile option if you’re shopping for higher-end brands on a budget.\n\nFrames\n\nEyeBuyDirect only sells three brands: Ray-Ban, Oakley, and their exclusive brand RFLKT. However, there’s still plenty of frame variety to choose from for adults and kids.\n\nAdditionally, if you shop for sales, you can find eyeglasses for up to 50% off on top of the 20% to 30% sitewide discounts EyeBuyDirect frequently runs.\n\nIf the sales section is still too pricey, EyeBuyDirect also has an extensive lineup of cheap glasses. This category has a range of eyeglass frames in the $10 to $15 range, and standard lenses start a bit over $30. Bifocal lenses start at $29, and progressive lenses start at $49. There’s also a range of customization options, like lens tinting and blue-light blocking, but you can keep costs down if you stick with the basics. Blue-light-blocking lenses start at $49, mirrored sunglasses start at $19, and transition lenses start at $99.\n\nLens Pricing\n\nYou also have options for coating upgrades. Standard lenses come with anti-scratch and antireflective coatings.\n\nHowever, there are three other lens options available:\n\nValue lenses: Up to 25% thinner than standard lenses; adds UV protection; at least $45 more\n\nAdvanced lenses: Up to 35% thinner than value lenses; adds UV protection; at least $100 more\n\nPremium lenses: Up to 25% thinner than value lenses; adds UV blocking, anti-smudge, and dust- and water-repellent coatings; at least $135 more\n\nUpgrading to thinner lenses with different coatings can increase the cost quite significantly.\n\nLoyalty Program & Insurance\n\nIf you join the free Focus loyalty program by spending at least $75 within a year, you also unlock:\n\nA buy-one, get-one offer on your birthday\n\n15% off sitewide on your account anniversary\n\n30% off sitewide each quarter\n\nA free eyeglasses case\n\nEarly access to new collections and 15% off\n\nHigher Focus loyalty tiers offer even more generous rewards. For example, spend $250 or more within a year to get up to 50% off a complete pair (up to twice per year) and 30% off sitewide.\n\nEven if you’re not in the loyalty program, you can take advantage of a 20% student discount or veteran discount if you qualify.\n\nEyeBuyDirect doesn’t accept insurance, so check with your vision care provider before shopping to see if they can reimburse you.\n\nShipping\n\nRegular U.S. shipping costs $5.95 unless your order is $119 or more. EyeBuyDirect also ships internationally starting from $19 ($9.95 to Canada). You have 14 days to make a return for a replacement or refund. Your glasses are also covered for one year if there are evident defects in material and build.\n\nIf you don’t mind the lack of brands and want incredibly affordable eyeglasses, EyeBuyDirect is one of the best websites to shop.\n\nShop EyeBuyDirect Now\n\n4. Zenni Optical\n\nWith prices starting at $6.95 for single-vision prescription glasses, it’s hard to find a more affordable solution for eyewear than Zenni Optical.\n\nFrames\n\nLike Glasses USA, Zenni Optical carries various frame styles for adults and kids. In fact, there are thousands of frame designs. Plus, unlike many online glasses retailers, Zenni Optical also manufactures their own eyeglasses.\n\nThat cuts out intermediaries and the need to hold massive amounts of inventory, which is why Zenni Optical is so affordable. Once you find a design that appeals to you, you can also complete a virtual try-on to confirm you like the fit.\n\nYou must provide your pupillary distance (PD) to order glasses. However, measuring your PD is easy if your eye doctor hasn’t already done so. If you’ve never worn glasses before, you can also use the sizing chart to find the right fit. To finalize an order, enter your prescription information and confirm.\n\nLens Pricing\n\nPrices include the frame, basic thin and single-vision prescription lenses, anti-scratch coating, and UV protection. You can add blue-light-blocking lenses to almost any Zenni frame starting at $16.95. Progressive lenses start under $30, and bifocals start under $20. You can also add a sunglass tint for free, though the premium tint option is about $30.\n\nInsurance\n\nZenni Optical doesn’t accept insurance. However, if you have vision insurance, check with your provider to see if they will reimburse your total purchase from Zenni Optical or cover vision expenses up to a certain amount.\n\nShipping\n\nStandard U.S. shipping costs $4.95, and orders take 7 to 14 days to arrive. Zenni Optical also ships internationally. You have 30 days from receiving your glasses to make a return for a 50% refund or one-time 100% store credit reimbursement. If there is a manufacturing error or damage, you receive a full refund under the 30-day warranty.\n\nShop Zenni Optical Now\n\n5. Eyeconic\n\nIf you prefer certain name-brand eyewear or want variety, Eyeconic offers more choice than most online eyewear retailers. In fact, Eyeconic carries nearly 50 brands for adults and kids, including Cole Haan, Columbia, Jones New York, Kate Spade, Oakley, and Saint Laurent.\n\nFrames start at around $120 unless you find a sale. This price includes single-vision lenses with scratch-resistant coating and UV protection. Progressive lenses add approximately $60 to $70 to the price, depending on your frames. Unfortunately, prescription sunglasses don’t include free prescription lenses, and the cheapest pair of single-vision-lens sunglasses starts at around $170.\n\nIf you want an antireflective coating and impact-resistant lenses, you can also upgrade to the gold lens package for about $100. The platinum lens package is $145 extra and includes Eyeconic’s thinnest lenses. Finally, you can upgrade to blue-light-protective lenses or transition lenses for $100.\n\nIf you shop on clearance, you can usually find pairs from designer brands for between $100 and $150. Clearance inventory isn’t where Eyeconic shines, and the selection is admittedly limited. However, where Eyeconic differs from the competition is in their eyewear discounts. Though subject to change at any time, current discounts include:\n\n10% off your first order after signing up for Eyeconic’s newsletter\n\nA limited-time first-order discount up to 50% on select frames\n\n10% off for students, teachers, military members, first responders, and seniors\n\nFree frame adjustment at participating in-network doctors\n\n20% off on eyewear for VSP, MetLife, and Cigna members\n\n$40 or more in credits for VSP, MetLife, and Cigna members for connecting their vision insurance to their Eyeconic account\n\nEyeconic also states that VSP, MetLife, and Cigna members can save up to $220 on eyewear and contacts. Vision insurance is the best way to save money on eyewear at many retailers, but Eyeconic promotes these savings across their website.\n\nIf you have vision insurance with a different provider, you can complete an out-of-network claim form and still benefit from coverage. Note that an out-of-network claim doesn’t guarantee a discount or up to $220 in savings if your provider doesn’t have the same arrangement with Eyeconic.\n\nStandard ground shipping is free. Currently, Eyeconic only ships within the U.S.\n\nEyeconic isn’t the cheapest way to buy eyeglasses online if you don’t have vision insurance. However, between its seemingly permanent 10% discount, limited-time discounts up to 50% for new customers, and vision insurance promotions, it’s an excellent option for VSP-, MetLife-, and Cigna-covered individuals looking specifically for designer eyewear.\n\nShop Eyconic Now\n\n6. Eyebobs\n\nPros: Free U.S. shipping; high-quality readers you can wear that all day; variety of lens upgrades; one-on-one style consultations to help you find the right eyewear; 15% off when you join the email list\n\nCons: Single-vision and progressives are on the pricier side\n\nVerdict: Shop at Eyebobs if you want high-quality readers you can wear all day\n\nEyebobs is another option to buy affordable eyeglasses for adults, especially if you’re looking for high-quality reading glasses.\n\nReaders start at $95 at regular pricing and $49 when on sale. Overall, Eyebobs has more variety for readers than most online eyewear retailers that focus on prescription glasses. According to its website, Eyebobs is the No. 1 premium reader brand. And its all-day readers have a progressive lens with your reader magnification at the bottom part of the lens, half the magnification in the middle, and no magnification at the top. That means you can wear the same pair of readers while reading a book, typing at your computer, or socializing with friends.\n\nBlue-light readers start at $135, and all-day readers start at $155. You can also find dozens of stylish designs for blue-light glasses and sunglasses starting at $95 if you want more than reading glasses.\n\nFor prescription eyewear, Eyebobs is on the pricier side versus the cheapest eyewear retailers, with glasses starting at $245 for single-vision prescriptions and $345 for progressives. Glasses come with coatings for scratch-resistance, antireflection, and UV protection. You also have several upgrades available:\n\nThinner lenses for $50\n\nBlue-light-blocking lenses for $40\n\nTransition lenses for $90\n\nPolarized lenses for $90\n\nThere’s a webcam-powered virtual try-on option that lets you see how most frames fit your face. Eyebobs also has a 10-question style quiz that asks about your face structure, reading habits, and style preferences to find the perfect pair. Finally, you can book a one-on-one virtual Zoom consultation with an Eyebobs team member to find the right eyewear.\n\nU.S. shipping is free, and international shipping rates vary depending on the country. U.S. customers can return or exchange unused eyewear within 90 days for free. International customers also have 90 days for returns or exchange but have to pay for shipping. Eyebobs doesn’t accept vision insurance payments but recommends checking with your provider to see if your purchase is eligible for reimbursement.\n\nEyebobs isn’t the most affordable choice if you want a cheap pair of prescription eyewear with single-vision or progressive lenses. But for premium readers, Eyebobs certainly stands out from the competition with more frame variety and lens upgrade options.\n\nShop Now\n\n7. Costco Optical\n\nPros: In-store optometrists; free shipping on orders of $75 or more; accepts most vision insurance plans\n\nCons: Not the cheapest eyewear option; requires an annual Costco membership\n\nVerdict: Shop at Costco Optical if you already have a Costco membership and prefer buying eyewear in person or need to see an optometrist\n\nFor many households, shopping at Costco is an easy solution to save money by buying in bulk without sacrificing on quality. Warehouse stores generally charge a lower markup than regular retailers, which is why a warehouse membership is often worth it.\n\nA basic Costco membership is $60 per year. However, if you plan to shop at Costco Optical in addition to the regular warehouse, the cost is easily worth it.\n\nCostco isn’t as cheap as online retailers like Zenni Optical. According to Clark.com, the price of an entry-level pair of single-vision glasses at Costco was $126 in 2019, compared with $95 at Warby Parker. This is subject to change over time and between stores, but it’s representative of the difference between Costco and reputable online retailers.\n\nHowever, when you consider the quality of service and availability of Costco, it’s easy to see why Costco Optical is a popular choice for those who prefer shopping for eyewear in person.\n\nNot that you can’t shop online at Costco Optical. You do need an up-to-date prescription, and the risk of buying the wrong frame is higher than shopping in the store. At Costco, you have trained opticians to assist you at every step, from your eye exam to finding the right frame.\n\nCostco accepts most vision insurance plans. You can shop for a range of brand-name and designer frames, like Oakley and Balmain. Costco also carries Kirkland Signature HD progressive lenses, which are antireflective and provide higher-definition vision at any distance.\n\nIf you don’t shop at Costco and would only use your membership for optical purchases, the cost probably isn’t worth it. However, when you consider the quality of service and multiple ways to save money at Costco, their optical center is an affordable option for members.\n\nShop Now\n\n8. Sam’s Club Optical\n\nPros: Free shipping; 20% off eyewear with plus membership; in-store optometrists\n\nCons: Requires an annual Sam’s Club membership\n\nVerdict: Shop at Sam’s Club if you already have a membership there and don’t have vision insurance to take advantage of a 20% discount\n\nSam’s Club is an affordable way to buy everything from electronics and furniture to office supplies, groceries, and sporting goods. A basic membership only costs $50 per year, noticeably less than a Costco membership. You can also buy the plus membership for $110 and earn 2% cash back on select purchases (up to $500 total cash per year), enjoy free shipping, take advantage of Plus-only shopping times early in the morning, and get free select prescriptions.\n\nBut the plus membership also provides 20% off a pair of prescription eyeglasses or prescription sunglasses at regular price. Unfortunately, the offer doesn’t apply if you use vision insurance.\n\nThe optical center is also more affordable than Costco’s, though pricing is subject to change. Designer frames with nonglare, single-vision lenses start as low as $60 and basic progressive lenses come in under $120. You can also change your lenses and frames to suit your needs. Lens options like Pentax are similar to Kirkland Signature HD progressive lenses, and options like UV protection and adaptive lenses are available.\n\nYou can’t purchase prescription eyewear online with Sam’s Club. However, like Costco, Sam’s Club has on-site optometrists, so you can schedule an eye exam. Sam’s Club generally accepts popular vision insurance plans but states that you should contact your local Sam’s Club to check eligible providers.\n\nIf you want to save money on everyday purchases alongside eyewear, signing up for a Sam’s Club membership is undoubtedly worth the money.\n\nShop Now\n\n9. 39DollarGlasses\n\nPros: 4% cash-back rewards program; extensive vision insurance network; offers lens replacements\n\nCons: No free shipping unless you spend $99\n\nVerdict: Shop at 39DollarGlasses during a sale period or if your household can take advantage of the EyeBucks rewards program with multiple purchases\n\nIf you want a happy medium between $6.95 eyeglasses from Zenni Optical and more expensive in-store brands, 39DollarGlasses is for you.\n\nAs the name suggests, 39DollarGlasses carries a variety of prescription glasses for $39. Prescription sunglasses start around $50. All eyewear purchases include single-vision lenses, and regular bifocals and progressive lenses start under $100.\n\nYou can also add lens customizations like HD light and thin or polarized lenses. For single-vision glasses, it’s possible to stay at $39 if you don’t add customizations. Otherwise, expect to pay at least $100 to $150 for a pair of prescription eyewear. Blue-light-protective lenses are also available for an extra $50.\n\nThis retailer also offers lens replacement. Just enter details about your frame, lens type, and whether you want upgrades like blue-light protection. The base price for lenses is still $39, although bifocals and progressives cost at least $80. There’s also a roughly $15 lens replacement fee. Ultimately, it can save some money if you have expensive frames and just need to fix broken lenses or receive a new prescription.\n\nYou can save more money by joining the EyeBucks rewards program. Once you make a purchase, you’re automatically enrolled. This loyalty program pays 4% of eyeglasses purchases in cash-back account credits, and credits don’t expire.\n\nShipping is free if you spend more than $99. Otherwise, regular shipping costs $4.95, and most orders arrive within two weeks. The company also ships internationally. For returns, you have 90 days to seek in-store credit after delivery. If you want a refund, you only have 30 days, and shipping charges are nonrefundable.\n\nThe company occasionally offers coupon codes and seasonal bonuses, so remember to visit their website when shopping around for a new pair of eyewear. The company also partners with 10 vision insurance providers, including Aetna, EyeMed, Humana, and Avesis.\n\nShop Now\n\n10. DiscountGlasses.com\n\nPros: Free shipping; affordable starting frames; offers lens replacements\n\nCons: Fewer options for lens coating customization; no blue-light protection for progressive lenses\n\nVerdict: DiscountGlasses has a competitive clearance section, although there are fewer frame options on sale than websites like Glasses USA\n\nDiscountGlasses.com is another affordable online eyewear retailer that carries over 1,000 designs for adults and kids. Plus, with frames starting under $30 on clearance and under $40 for nonclearance frames, DiscountGlasses has an affordable entry point for eyewear.\n\nPricing includes single-vision lenses. You can upgrade to thin or ultra-thin lenses for an extra $20 or $50, respectively. Basic progressive lenses cost an additional $60, meaning you can find progressive lens eyewear for less than $100 if you buy the cheapest non-clearance frames. Thin and ultra-thin progressive lens upgrades cost about $20 and $50, respectively.\n\nThere are also several upgrades available for your lenses:\n\nBlue-light protection: Only available for single-vision lenses for about $20 extra\n\nTransition lenses: Available for single-vision and progressive lenses for about $80 extra\n\nSun tint: Turn eyeglasses into sunglasses with UV protection for about $5\n\nAntireflective coating: Costs an additional $20\n\nDiscountGlasses also carries prescription sunglasses starting under $20 on clearance and under $40 for nonclearance frames. If they’re not bundled into the cost of the frame, lenses start at around $10 extra, although you can upgrade to thin and ultra-thin lenses for about $30 and $50 extra, respectively. Adding polarized lenses costs an additional $10 or more.\n\nPlus, DiscountGlasses replaces lenses for free within one year of your purchase if your doctor changes your prescription due to vision problems you’re experiencing with your current pair of eyewear.\n\nDiscountGlasses states they are an out-of-network provider for most insurance plans, including Davis Vision, EyeMed, Spectra/United Healthcare, and VSP. If you shop at DiscountGlasses, check with your current vision care provider to see if you have coverage.\n\nStandard U.S. shipping is free with DiscountGlasses, regardless of your order total, which is a plus. There’s also a 365-day return policy under which you can return eyewear for store credit or a replacement pair if you’re unsatisfied with your eyewear.\n\nShop Now\n\n11. Lensabl\n\nPros: Free U.S. shipping; 15% off your first order (limited time only); extensive upgrade options; free blue-light protection; offers lens replacements; more affordable than some of the competition\n\nCons: Not a huge selection of bifocals\n\nVerdict: If you want extensive prescription upgrades, Lensabl is for you; may not be the best option for those who need bifocals\n\nLike Warby Parker, Lensabl offers regular and designer eyewear at affordable prices. While this isn’t the cheapest eyewear retailer, prices are comparable to Warby Parker, though some frames are totally free with a lens purchase. Plus, in terms of lens upgrades, Lensabl has more selection than the competition.\n\nSingle-vision prescription with frames and lenses start around $100, and progressives start around $200. You can also find designer frames from brands like Toms and Grey Ant, but those generally cost around $200 to $250. Additionally, bifocals aren’t an option for most frame types and are usually only available in premium brands, not the $100 starter prescriptions.\n\nUpgrade options include:\n\nPremium progressive lenses. These high-definition, wide-corridor progressive lenses have a wider reading area compared to normal progressive lenses. This upgrade costs about $325 in total.\n\nHigh-index lenses. This single-vision prescription upgrade to 25% thinner lenses costs $50 more.\n\nTransition lenses. These lenses adapt to light, darkening when you’re outdoors and remaining light while inside. This upgrade costs an additional $60.\n\nTrivex lenses. These impact- and shatter-resistant lenses cost an additional $60.\n\nPremium coating package. Get scratch resistance, smudge resistance, UV protection, and a hydrophobic (water-repellant) coating for $40 more.\n\nPremium coating and antifog. Antifog protection plus everything from the premium coating package costs $75 more.\n\nCrizal Prevencia AR. All premium coatings, superior scratch resistance, antifog protection, and blue-light protection costs $125 more.\n\nEdge polishing. Edge polishing helps lenses appear thinner, making it popular for prescriptions with thicker lens edges to enhance their cosmetic appearance. However, polishing can cause more reflections and overall light to enter, so it’s best to pair this with an antireflective coating. Polish the edges of rimless glasses for $15 or polish and roll the edges of rimless glasses for $25.\n\nUltimately, Lensabl’s various coating options let you upgrade your prescription to suit your needs. It’s also worth noting that blue-light protection is available for free, which is a nice touch since most retailers charge extra for it.\n\nLensabl also carries contact lenses and prescription sunglasses. Like regular prescription eyewear, single-vision sunglasses start at around $100 and progressive prescription sunglasses start around $200. Night lenses that are 50% orange-tinted help block blue light are also available for around $130 for single-vision prescriptions and around $230 for progressive prescriptions.\n\nAnother convenient feature Lensabl offers is lens replacement. If you damage your lenses, you can send your glasses to Lensabl for repair and receive your glasses back within four to seven business days. Lens replacement starts at around $80 for single-vision prescriptions. Progressive lenses cost around $200 and bifocals cost around $130. Various coating upgrades or thinner lenses are regular price for lens replacement.\n\nLensabl doesn’t accept vision care insurance as payment. However, some vision care partners allow you to submit your invoice for reimbursement. Lensabl partners include VSP, Atena, United Healthcare, Cigna, Humana, and EyeMed.\n\nU.S. shipping is free, but Canadian shipping is about $40, so Lensabl probably isn’t the best fit for north-of-the-border buyers. You can’t return eyewear, although remakes are free if there’s a defect with your prescription or they were made incorrectly. You have 30 days to ask for a remake.\n\nShop Now\n\n12.

Felix Gray suggests checking with your provider to see if blue-light lenses are eligible for coverage and if eyewear needs a minimum magnification to qualify.\n\nIf you want to buy cheap prescription eyewear and save as much as possible, Felix Gray isn’t the right fit.
