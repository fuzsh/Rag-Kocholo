        "text": "Hello all. My husband sat on my son's glasses yesterday and we now need to buy yet another new pair We usually spend around $150 on them at LensCrafters but feel like maybe we're being ripped off. Or we should try somewhere else. But don't want to sacrifice quality obviously.\n\nCan anyone recommend a good place to buy new quality glasses at a reasonable price? And hopefullly without too much of a wait as my son really can't do without them.\n\nThanks for any advice\n\nI think Walmart is running a special on kids glasses for like 30.00.\n\nyes, basically it is the lens, special coatings, and warranty for $20 for kids 18 and younger ...and then if you pick the $9 frames the total is $29. We got some nicer frames on clearance for $48,and paid $20 for lens package special so it was $68...but they had a decent selection of the $9 frames\n\nGo to http://www.coastalcontacts.com/\n\nChoose a pair of $38 frames. Add lenses. All you pay is around $10 if you want the lenses to have the anti-scratch coating, and the UV and scratch protection. You also pay $11 for shipping & handling. The frames and lenses are free if you use this code: FREEFORUSA\n\nIf the prescription is higher than 1.5 index, there will be an extra charge. You need to have your DS's prescription when you order. I ordered a free pair for myself and a free pair for DD (through my mom's address). They both took a week to arrive. The frames are REALLY nice. Mine are Nike brand, and DD's are a stylish purple -- can't remember the brand.\n\nHopefully the code still works. Coastal Contacts has been posting about it on their facebook page.\n\nZenni Optical is another option if this code no longer works, but then you are getting cheap frames from China and it can take weeks.\n\nGlassy Eyes is a blog dedicated entirely to finding online retailers of eyeglasses.\n\nYou get your prescription from your local optometrist and then buy the glasses online for half the price or less than LensCrafters.\n\nI'm exceedingly happy with the pair I bought from GlassesUSA.com and wear every day now. LensCrafters never sold me a pair that was as good as these, and they were cheaper too.\n\nHello all. My husband sat on my son's glasses yesterday and we now need to buy yet another new pair We usually spend around $150 on them at LensCrafters but feel like maybe we're being ripped off.

And hopefullly without too much of a wait as my son really can't do without them.\n\nThanks for any advice\n\nHow old are they?\n\nhttp://www.lenscrafters.com/eyeglasses/6/1-year-eyewear-protection-plan\n\nWe have used Eyemart Express lately, but in the past we used Walmart's vision center. I have been happy with the quality, price & service at both. The Walmarts in OK do not have vision centers, which is why we have not used them lately.\n\nETA: Several co-workers have used zennioptical in the past and have been very happy. They do take a week or so to get them. You mentioned that your son needs his glasses, so the internet options may not work this time. Maybe you could use them when it is time for new glasses? Just a thought to save money in the future.\n\nDh ordered his last pair on 39dollarglasses. They were about that much and took about a week to arrive. We're both really pleased with the quality and that he was able to order a pair he likes instead of picking from more limited selections. The one thing I will say as a person who has to wear glasses every day all day is to be sure he gets something he actually likes. It's so annoying to have a pair that you bought only because they were less expensive.\n\nSo glad to hear a good review of Coastal Contacts. I just ordered on Friday. I used a different code - I think it was COASTALFREE2011. My son did need to get thinner lenses so it was a bit higher. He basically got his $120 frame free and we had to pay for shipping/ins/lens upgrade.\n\nAmerica's Best bugs me. I've been to two different ones and they seem to try to upsell you on everything. I feel like I spend more time saying No to this, No to that, etc. I'm not sure if it is this area but it just annoying. My sons two pair of glasses at Americas Best was about $220 about two years ago."
