        "text": "If you’re looking for the best place to buy glasses online or in a store, there are several ways you can go: optical chains, independent optometrists, optical departments in big-box stores or online-only sellers.\n\nNo matter which option you choose, the key thing to remember is this: Eyeglasses don’t have to cost hundreds of dollars. I’ve researched prices and the process of buying prescription glasses at a variety of popular retailers to see where you’ll get the best deal and the best customer experience.\n\nIn this article, I’ll take a close look at Zenni Optical, Costco Optical and other great places to buy glasses both online and in-store. Plus, I’ll tell you where you can get the cheapest eye exam, what you can expect to pay and what you’ll need to know before ordering glasses online.\n\nThis article was updated in May 2024 and I review it every three months. Detailed notes on all updates can be found here.\n\nThe Best Place To Buy Glasses\n\nMoney expert Clark Howard has long bought his glasses online from a website called Zenni Optical. Zenni is one of the cheapest places to buy eyeglasses, with prices starting at $6.95 (plus $4.95 for shipping) for basic frames with prescription lenses.\n\nHowever, you may not get the same high-quality frames you’re used to if you typically spend hundreds of dollars on glasses. In fact, Zenni recently dropped from #3 to #11 on Consumer Reports’ survey of the best place to buy eyeglasses.\n\n“The idea is that Zenni still is a customer service machine, but the quality of the glasses you get compared to others? Not good enough,” says Clark. “So how do you beat the cartel, if you’re not happy with the quality of the glasses you get really cheaply from Zenni? The top three places to get glasses in the United States now are Costco, Warby Parker and Sam’s Club.”\n\nConsumer Reports regularly reviews eyeglass retailers and says Costco Optical is currently the #1 best place to buy glasses in America. According to Clark, this isn’t surprising.\n\n“The customer service is extraordinary, much like you’d find at an independent doctor of optometry,” he says. “The big difference is how much money you save at Costco and the service after the sale. If you’re not happy, they give you your money back unless state law prohibits it.”\n\nTo see the list of Consumer Reports’ rankings, you’ll need to subscribe. The current rate for a digital subscription is $39 per year.\n\n8 of the Best Places To Buy Glasses\n\nWhether you prefer shopping online or in a store, Costco Optical, Warby Parker and Sam’s Club are among the best places to buy glasses, though they aren’t the only retailers worth considering. For example, if price is your biggest factor, Zenni Optical will be hard to beat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, there are a lot of things to consider before you decide where to buy glasses. Some of the most important factors include the quality of frames and lenses, total price, customer service and accessibility.\n\nBased on these qualities and my research in May 2024, here are eight of the best places to order eyeglasses.\n\nEye Exam CostStarting Cost for FramesStarting Cost for Single-Vision LensesStarting Cost for Progressive LensesBest for: Costco Optical$88$59.99$59.99$130Customer service and quality Warby Parker$85$95$0$295Selection and style Sam's Club Optical$72$59$0$145Balance between prices and services Zenni OpticalN/A$6.95$0$37.95Cheapest glasses overall EyeBuyDirectN/A$6$0$49Picking out new glasses online Walmart Vision Center$79$9$30$100Nearby in-person service Target Optical$95$38$51$132Using vision insurance online America's Best$69$29.95$0$100Cheapest eye exam\n\nAs you can see, some starting costs for single-vision lenses are $0. At these retailers, the cost of single-vision plastic lenses is included in the cost of the frames.\n\nBelow, you’ll find additional information on each retailer including details about the selection, how to shop for the best deals and how to place an order online.\n\n1. Costco Optical\n\nIf you’re a Costco member, you can find great prices on frames and lenses at Costco Optical compared to independent eyeglass shops and doctors’ offices. Plus, the warehouse earns exceptional marks on price, follow-up service, quality of frames and lenses and more from Consumer Reports. Costco Optical also gets Clark Howard’s stamp of approval.\n\nWhile you do have to be a Costco member to purchase glasses or contacts there, anyone can get an eye exam and visit the eye doctor there. And Costco accepts most major insurance plans.\n\nWhen I checked out the prices in May 2024, Costco offered frames beginning as low as $59.99 and single-vision lenses also beginning at $59.99. To get a basic pair of prescription glasses from Costco, the starting cost would be around $120. These prices may vary from one warehouse to the next.\n\nOf course, Costco doesn’t offer the lowest possible price for prescription glasses. You’ll find lower prices at online retailers such as Zenni and EyeBuyDirect. Still, the overall quality of the frames, lenses and the buying experience may be worth the difference in price. If you’re more comfortable talking to a doctor and trying on frames in person, Costco is a great choice.\n\nIf you’re thinking about buying your next pair of glasses from Costco Optical, check out these four things to know.\n\n2. Warby Parker\n\nWarby Parker is a great option for buying glasses both online and in-store. You’ll find a huge selection of styles as well as competitive prices and fast, free shipping. Consumer Reports ranks them second, just behind Costco Optical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you aren’t sure which style of glasses you’d like, you can take Warby Parker’s style quiz. Warby Parker also allows you to select five frames to test out for five days at no cost if you’re shopping online. And when you buy a pair of eyeglasses from Warby Parker, the company will donate a pair of glasses to someone who needs them.\n\nIf there’s a Warby Parker location nearby, you can also visit in person to try on and order glasses. Some locations offer eye exams for $85-$130. While the prices aren’t necessarily the cheapest available, the convenience and customer service may be worth the difference.\n\nBefore you decide where to buy your next set of glasses, check out these five things to know about Warby Parker.\n\n3. Sam’s Club Optical\n\nAccording to Consumer Reports, Sam’s Club Optical ranks third among 18 eyeglass stores and received above-average scores in six out of seven categories including follow-up service, customer service and quality. I found that Sam’s Club Optical offered one of the cheapest average prices on eye exams as well as good prices on frames.\n\nLike Costco, you’ll have to have a membership to buy glasses or contacts from Sam’s Club, but anyone can make an appointment with the eye doctor.\n\nIf you’re thinking about buying your next pair of glasses from Sam’s Club Optical, here are five things to know before your first visit.\n\n4. Zenni Optical\n\nZenni Optical has proved to be an industry disrupter when it comes to buying prescription glasses. The online-only retailer offers the absolute lowest prices on plastic frames and includes the cost of single-vision plastic lenses in those prices. The cost of progressive lenses is equally surprising.\n\nDespite the crazy low prices, Zenni Optical had always kept a decent reputation. However, it has recently dropped significantly in ranking in Consumer Reports’ rankings.\n\n“Zenni for years had a fantastic rating from Consumer Reports. Recently, their rating in CR dropped from being the third best place in America to get your eyeglasses to 11th,” says money expert Clark Howard. “Their score went from a great score to what I consider to be a failing score, a 59.”\n\nIf you do decide to try Zenni glasses, you’ll find a huge selection of frame styles and lens features available, and it’s easy to place an order online. Shipping costs just $4.95, and the company says you can expect your glasses to arrive in 2-3 weeks. (Team Clark members who have ordered from Zenni have received their glasses early every time.)\n\nTo read more about our experiences with Zenni Optical and learn how to place your first order, check out these six things to know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. EyeBuyDirect\n\nEyeBuyDirect is another one of the best places to buy glasses online. As long as you already have a valid prescription from your eye doctor, you can save a ton of money by shopping at EyeBuyDirect. Plus, like Warby Parker, for every pair that you buy, another pair is donated.\n\nWhen you first visit the website, you can take the style quiz for some recommendations. As you browse available styles, you can click on the small heart next to the ones you like so that you can easily compare choices later. For these reasons, shopping at EyeBuyDirect is a great way to get the competitive pricing of an in-house, online retailer while also picking out a new pair of frames you’ll love.\n\nDon’t forget to check out available promotions on the website to get the most savings. Plus, students and veterans are eligible for an additional 20-30% off. New subscribers may also be eligible for a welcome bonus including a discount and free shipping on your first purchase.\n\nFor more ways to save, check out these five things to know before buying your glasses at EyeBuyDirect.\n\n6. Walmart Vision Center\n\nIf you live near a Walmart Vision Center, this could be another good place to shop for glasses. You’ll find a huge selection of frame styles and colors at competitive prices, and they’re available both online and in-store.\n\nWalmart Vision Center has been my primary optical center for a long time, and I’ve always had great experiences. Still, while Walmart offers low prices available on select frames, there are better prices on higher quality frames elsewhere.\n\nWhen I checked out the prices in May 2024, Walmart offered frames beginning as low as $9 and single-vision lenses beginning at $30. To get a basic pair of prescription glasses from Walmart, the starting cost would be around $39. Of course, these prices may vary by location.\n\nIf convenience is a major factor for you, you can find a great deal at Walmart. Plus, the vision center accepts most major insurance plans for eye exams and in-store purchases.\n\nTo learn more about Walmart Vision Center, check out these five things to know before your first visit.\n\n7. Target Optical\n\nSimilar to Walmart Vision Center, Target Optical may be a convenient choice for you, and it offers a wide selection of styles and lens types.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the prices aren’t necessarily the lowest available, you will find great deals on Target brands including A New Day, Goodfellow & Co. and Cat & Jack. Plus, RedCard holders are eligible for a 5% discount on Target Optical products.\n\nMy favorite thing about Target Optical is the ability to check your insurance benefits online. The company accepts more than 50 different insurance plans, and you can enter your personal and plan information to check your eligibility.\n\nWhen I checked out the prices in May 2024, Target Optical offered frames beginning as low as $38 and single-vision lenses beginning at $51. To get a basic pair of prescription glasses from Target Optical, the starting cost would be around $89. Of course, these prices may vary by location.\n\nIf you’re thinking about buying glasses from Target Optical, check out these five things to know.\n\n8. America’s Best Contacts & Eyeglasses\n\nAmerica’s Best is another place to consider buying your next pair (or pairs) of glasses. While an eye exam is typically $69 and glasses start at $29.95 each, America’s Best offers a deal including two pairs of glasses and an eye exam for $79.95 total. That makes each pair of glasses $39.98 and the eye exam free!\n\nUnfortunately, America’s Best is ranked last on Consumer Reports’ survey and gets below-average scores for both the quality of frames and lenses and policies. The retailer also has a considerable number of low scores from the Better Business Bureau, Consumer Affairs and Yelp.\n\nIf you’re looking for a great deal on simple prescription lenses in plastic frames or a cheap eye exam, America’s Best may be an option for you. Getting your eyes checked at Sam’s Club and buying your glasses at Zenni may leave you happier in the long run.\n\nBefore you decide where to make your purchase, read these five things to know about America’s Best.\n\nWhat To Know Before Buying Eyeglasses\n\nThe cheap prices from online retailers are certainly alluring. But if you plan on ordering from a site like Zenni Optical or EyeBuyDirect, you’ll first need to get your vision checked by an eye doctor to get an updated prescription.\n\nYou’ll also need to find out your pupillary distance (P.D.), which is the space between the centers of your pupils, expressed in millimeters. Certain frames will not work with certain P.D.s because the center of the lenses will either be too wide or too narrow. You need a fit that’s just right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your P.D. is already noted on your prescription, you are good to go. If it’s not noted, many doctors will provide this information upon request.\n\nKnow Your Rights\n\nUnder the Federal Trade Commission’s Eyeglass Rule, doctors must do the following for their patients:\n\nYour eye doctor must give you a prescription for glasses at the end of your exam.\n\nYou can’t be required to pay an extra fee or sign a waiver in exchange for the prescription.\n\nYou can’t be required to buy your glasses or contact lenses from the eye doctor to get your prescription.\n\nNote that for contact lenses, the FTC says your eye doctor must give you the prescription after your fitting, which may require more than one appointment.\n\nIn some states, your doctor is also required to give you your pupillary distance. You can always ask for this even if it isn’t included on your prescription. If all else fails and you have a doctor who is just not cooperating, you can follow Zenni’s guide or EyeBuyDirect’s guide on how to measure your P.D. at home.\n\nTake Time To Comparison Shop\n\nBefore you decide where to buy your glasses, take the time to consider the following factors:\n\nThe cost of an eye exam (if you need one)\n\nThe cost of glasses (frames and lenses)\n\nThe quality of the glasses\n\nCustomer service and follow-up care\n\nIf you’re shopping online, you can look up the specs and prices of available glasses to compare. For in-store shopping, you might have to call your nearest location or visit in person to get an accurate estimate.\n\nIf you’re looking to get an eye exam, calling nearby locations is the best way to accurately compare prices. For a comparison beyond price, you can also look up the names of eye doctors in your area and search for patient reviews online. Online reviews may also be a good way to get an idea of the overall customer service experience and product quality.\n\nClark’s Advice for People Who Have Never Bought Glasses Online\n\nWhen you order online, you shouldn’t expect much customer service after the sale. For example, there’s no one you can go to who’ll adjust the fit if the frames aren’t comfortable. So recognize that there are some trade-offs.\n\nBut again, you’ll usually pay a fraction of the price with online sellers versus traditional retailers.\n\nClark wears progressive lenses he bought online and says he’s never had a problem with ordering glasses this way. But if this is the first time you’re buying glasses online, you may have some reservations.\n\nIn that case, try this advice from Clark:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I recommend a safe harbor until you’re comfortable. I want you to pay too much for your first pair buying them the traditional way to satisfy your fears. Then buy a second pair with a cheap online shop. Compare the two to see if the cheaper pair will work for you moving forward.”\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nFinding the best place to buy glasses can be tricky with so many options. Still, more options mean that you have a better chance of finding a great deal if you take the time to comparison shop.\n\nIf you’re a Costco member, you’ll find great prices, customer service and quality products at the warehouse. If you’re interested in the lowest possible prices and convenience, consider ordering online at Zenni Optical.\n\nWarby Parker is a great place to check out both online and in-store for a huge selection and up-to-date styles. Plus, you can try out five pairs for five days completely free. For a similar online experience with even lower prices, check out EyeBuyDirect.\n\nSam’s Club members will find great deals there, and you don’t even have to be a member to take advantage of the affordable eye exam prices. If you aren’t close to a Sam’s Club location, you may be able to find great prices at your nearest Walmart Vision Center or Target Optical.\n\nFinally, if you’re looking for the lowest prices on an eye exam and two pairs of glasses, America’s Best will have a deal for you, but keep in mind that its ratings (on several sites) aren’t the best."
