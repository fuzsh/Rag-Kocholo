Continuing our popular article from last year, “The Best Eyeglasses Trends for 2023“, we at Poudre Valley Eyecare have once again partnered with Eyemart Express to bring you the freshest and most appealing eyeglass trends for 2024.\n\nThis guide focuses exclusively on the foremost eyewear trends of the year.\n\nFrom classic designs that never go out of style to cutting-edge looks, we’re here to help you find eyeglasses that are a perfect fit for your unique style and personality. Additionally, we’ll dive into the most popular colors and offer our predictions for the trends that will dominate this year.\n\nHow to choose the best eyewear frames?\n\nDetermining face shape: start with a mirror. Do you have sharp angles or soft angles? What is the most prominent feature of your face, consider cheekbones, forehead, and jawline. Can you determine if your face is heart shaped, square, oval, or round?\n\nThis can help you decide which frames suit your face because different types of frames will flatter different facial structures.\n\nHowever, personal preference should win the decision in the end, because when someone is confident they look and feel their best! Our goal is to help you pick a distinctive frame that has both character and functionality, to help you feel your best – no matter the style."
