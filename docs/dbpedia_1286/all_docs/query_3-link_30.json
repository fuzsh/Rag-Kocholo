        "text": "Advantages of aspheric lenses\n\nIn reality, aspheric lenses were originally born to improve the marginalized optical properties of spherical lenses. The aspheric lens with special coating treatment has perfect visual performance, with a clearer, more comfortable visual effect. You can hardly feel the presence of aspheric lenses when you put them on. So you can enjoy the ease brought by aspheric lenses. They are more natural and more realistic, having less visual distortion. The aspheric lens can be designed with a flatter base arc, which not only makes the appearance beautiful but reduces the peripheral magnification so that when others look at the eyes of the people who wear glasses, the size will not change much.\n\nHow to buy prescription glasses online\n\nConsumers should choose different styles of frames according to their age and professional characteristics. Because everyone has different face shapes, different interpupillary distances, and different diopters, the size of the frames should vary from person to person.\n\nLenses are divided into glass lens, resin lens, and PC lens, and you can choose according to your preferences. The glass lens has a stable refractive index, good abrasion resistance, and stable optical performance, but it is relatively heavy and easy to break. Resin lens with high light transmittance is light, safe, and not easy to break, but the surface is easy to wear. PC lens has a high refractive index, but the surface is easy to wear.\n\nEyemart Express\n\nEyemart Express is founded in 1990. The focus is to get you the right glasses at the right price. Eyemart Express is the only retailer with a lens lab in every store that can produce 90% of its glasses on the same day. There are more than 2,000 frames to choose from, including designer brands and safety glasses. At their online store, you can buy prescription glasses anywhere and have them delivered to your door. You can choose the best glasses at the right price and enjoy same-day service.\n\nTrifocal vs Progressive Lenses: Which Are Better?\n\nEach type of glasses has advantages and disadvantages. Progressive glasses offer the wearer a youthful-looking eyewear option, and they can be customized for specific use. Trifocal glasses are not customizable like progressive, but instead, come in a few standard configurations. Trifocal glasses offer a wider intermediate viewing area than progressive lenses do. Hence, trifocal glasses could be more comfortable for computer use.\n\nIn addition, trifocal glasses are cheap than progressive lenses. So, they tend to be more affordable.\n\nWhatâ€™s more, progressive may be used in prescription sunglasses or in photochromic glasses. Trifocal lenses are mostly used in sunglasses or light adaptive glasses, but these may require a special order.\n\nSo, from the above information, you have learned some basic information about trifocal lenses and progressive lenses. As for trifocal vs progressive lenses, you may also have gotten some answers.\n\nTherefore, if you want to buy a pair of trifocal glasses or progressive glasses, you can try Koalaeye Optical. It is an online glasses store, providing all kinds of glasses, sunglasses, and frames. Besides, these glasses are stylish and come at a cheap price. With your great convenience, the package will be mailed for you for free.\n\nOVERSIZED FRAMES\n\nThese mesmerizing oversized glasses provide facial protection for the eyes and are popular. From the fashion of the 70s to the Hollywood glamour of the early 2000s, it makes you feel confident and protected.\n\nWhat does the glasses emoji mean?\n\nThe glasses emoji is a special type of symbol that can be used on smartphones, tablets, and computers. The glasses emoji is an illustration of glasses, used by people with poor vision or those who believe that wearing glasses makes them look smarter, purely as a style element. Different devices may have different versions of the glasses emoji. The glasses emoji, which varies slightly across platforms, depicts a pair of glasses with a gray or black border. Most are square or slightly round. The glasses emoji is used to talk about the fashion of wearing eyeglasses.\n\nIt is more reasonable to use a visor\n\nAccording to experts, if using the sun visor above the seat can solve the problem of dazzling sunlight, it is generally not recommended to use sunglasses. Although high-quality sunglasses can effectively reduce the impact of light on human eyes, they will more or less affect vision. Driving as a high-risk behavior, misjudgment of the environment can easily lead to accidents. If you really want to use sunglasses while driving, it is recommended that you develop a habit of wearing sunglasses to walk or work during your daily. Also, you can choose dedicated driving sunglasses. What needs to be reminded is that if your sunglasses are not usually worn, don't use them alone in the car."
