        "text": "If you wear eyeglasses or contact lenses, you may often wonder how to save money on your costs. There’s one area in the Costco warehouse that may make it worth it for you. Costco Optical offers a full range of eyeglasses and related eye exam services right inside the warehouse clubs.\n\nIn this article, we’ll take a look at Costco eye exams, the cost of eyeglasses and the options for sunglasses, contact lenses and more. Plus, read on for real customer reviews from Clark.com readers who’ve bought eyewear from Costco Optical.\n\nThis article was updated in July 2024 and I review it every three months. Detailed notes on all updates can be found here.\n\nCostco Optical: A Great Choice for Eyeglasses, Eye Exams, Contacts and More\n\nCostco Optical was named the best place to buy eyeglasses, according to a 2022 Consumer Reports survey of more than 11,000 CR members.\n\n“What you’re getting at Costco is a good price, and hopefully, really good customer service,” says money expert Clark Howard.\n\nThe warehouse club chain’s optical department earned winning marks on price, service after the sale, quality of frames and lenses and more.\n\nHere are details on what to expect if you shop at Costco Optical.\n\n1. How Much Is an Eye Exam at Costco?\n\nA Costco eye exam will generally run you somewhere in the neighborhood of $79 to $100, depending on where you live. Most major insurance plans are accepted.\n\nCostco Optical employs independent doctors of optometry who are located within the store or next to it.\n\nBecause the doctors are independent contractors, several posters on this Reddit thread suggest finding out the doctor’s name at your local warehouse club. That way you can read reviews about them online before making an appointment for your Costco eye exam.\n\n2. What Is the Cost of Eyeglasses at Costco?\n\nWhen we checked prices over the phone at Costco Optical locations across the country in July 2024, we found that single-vision lenses start at $63 on average and frames start at around $58 on average. Based on these numbers, you can get a basic pair of prescription eyeglasses from Costco starting at around $121.\n\nAtlanta, GeorgiaLexington, KentuckyDenver, ColoradoSeattle, WashingtonChicago, IllinoisQueens, New York Single Vision Lenses$65$60$60$60$65$66 Frames Starting Price$50$55$60$60$60$60 Eye Exam$100$79$85$100$65$105\n\nOf course, prices will vary based on where you live, the style of frames you choose and how complicated your prescription is. To get a better idea of how much your glasses will cost at Costco, call or visit your nearest Costco Optical and have your prescription details available.\n\n3. Costco Carries a Wide Variety of Designer Sunglasses\n\nIn addition to a wide range of eyeglasses brands, Costco Optical offers a variety of top names in sunglasses including Ray-Ban, Maui Jim, Oakley and more. The Ray-Bans you see above start at $84.99.\n\nCostco Optical also offers the following designer sunglasses:\n\nAlexander McQueen\n\nBollé\n\nBoucheron\n\nBottega Vaneta\n\nChloé\n\nDiff\n\nHobie\n\nKirkland Signature\n\nLancel\n\nMarc Jacobs\n\nMaui Jim\n\nMontblanc\n\nOakley\n\nPalmellato\n\nRag & Bone\n\nRay-Ban\n\nSPY\n\nSaint Laurent\n\nSerengeti\n\nSPY\n\nThom Browne\n\nTOUS\n\n4. Costco Has Great Prices on Top-Selling Contact Lens Brands\n\nThe selection at Costco Optical doesn’t stop at just eyeglasses and sunglasses! You can also buy a variety of contact lenses through the warehouse club.\n\nHere’s a look at a selection of major brand names and prices as of July 2024.\n\nBrandLens TypePrice Acuvue (Moist)Daily (30-pack)$32.87 AquaComfort Plus (Dailies)Daily (30-pack)$32.85 Acuvue (Vita)Monthly (6-pack)$54.98 Air OptixMonthly (6-pack)$48.87 BiofinityMonthly (6-pack)$35.87 ProclearMonthly (6-pack)$43.87\n\nCostco also offers its own brand of contact lenses. The Kirkland Signature Daily Disposable 90-pack costs $58.99 per box and includes 90 disposable lenses.\n\nMeanwhile, you can see how Costco’s prices compare to a variety of other sellers, including 1-800 Contacts, Lens.com and LensDirect.com, in our comparison of the best places to buy contact lenses.\n\nCostco Optical Reviews\n\nI recently went with my dad to purchase new glasses, and he decided to check out the selection at Costco Optical. In the past, he’s typically bought new frames and lenses from Walmart. However, he was surprised by the selection and prices at Costco. After talking to a specialist in the optical department, he decided to order the glasses.\n\nWhen the glasses came in the following week, he noticed something wasn’t exactly right with the prescription. After investigating, he discovered his optometrist (not at Costco Optical) had made a mistake with the written prescription. After getting it corrected, he went back to Costco Optical and they re-ordered the glasses for him with the right prescription and replaced them free of charge. Between the low prices and excellent services, he hasn’t stopped raving about Costco Optical since.\n\nWhile this is only his first pair of glasses from Costco, Clark.com readers have a wealth of experience with getting Costco eye exams and purchasing eyewear through Costco Optical.\n\nWhen we asked readers to share their personal experiences with Costco Optical, the majority of comments we received were positive. However, we strive to give a sense of both the good and the bad aspects our readers reported.\n\nHere’s what our readers had to say:\n\nL H: Love Costco Optical! Our Optometrist has significantly better tools and detailed exams than other opticians I’ve seen. His rates are beyond reasonable and cheaper than “in-network providers” so much so, I dropped optical coverage at work. The frames are fabulous, too.\n\nLorilu: I’ve been very happy with Costco Optical and their prices/service, even having glasses repaired at a Costco far from home while on vacation. The selection of inexpensive frames is extensive, and I’ve had great luck with the Kirkland frames. I’ve been using Costco Optical for about 20 years, but I have never used the Optometrist, preferring my own ophthalmologist.\n\nSamRay: I got a couple of eyeglasses from Costco. I am not sure how much time passed before one pair broke, but I think it was less than a year. We took them back and we were told they cannot be fixed. I treated them well; they must have been defective (definitely at least a poor design).\n\nDawn Scire: Worst glasses I’ve ever owned – from Costco! The lenses had tiny scratches / pitting within 2 months; 6 months later I can hardly see through them! I went with them because everyone raved at how cost-effective they are … not so much if they must be replaced every few months!"
