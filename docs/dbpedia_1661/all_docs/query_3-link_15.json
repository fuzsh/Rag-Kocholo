Their debut album “The Lesser God” (2017) has been internationally recognized for being one of the best Atmospheric and yet melodic Black Metal album out from the US recently.\n\nIf you are not still familiarized with this band, and you like the riffs and atmospheres of bands as diverse as Sacramentum, Dissection, Mgla, Batushka, Satanic Warmaster, Taake, Arckanum, Uada or Burzum, surely Dumal is going to freeze your blood , since the trio has managed to unite in a truly virtuous and skillful way that amalgam of influences and arrangements to create a masterpiece where all these elements work together in harmony, being “The Lesser God” a genuine expression of black metal. But Dumal is much more than an influenced band by the differents Black Metal waves from the 90s onwards, Dumal has an unique aura and their own mark.\n\nMany of you have been asking for a re-pressing of the ultra-limited CD long time sold out. The wait is over, Temple of Darkness Records is proud to announce that in the coming months we will reissue ” The Lesser God” on vinyl format for the first time ever, stay tuned because only 300 LPs will be manufactured. We will also release the CD format limited to 500 copies in luxurious digipack. Follow us on facebook to know when we will enable the pre-order.\n\nTest pressing were approved during May. Final production should be ready within July 20.\n\nhttps://dumal.bandcamp.com/\n\nTemple of Darkness Records is proud to announce that we have a new deal with Richard Lederer (Summoning, Die Verbannten Kinder Evas…) in order to release “Nullify”, the 4th Ice Ages album in a deluxe CD limited to 500 copies. Release plan is Septermber 2019.\n\nThis new album is pure dark art, apocalyptic and yet emotional and evocative. Synth music with a slow and calculated atmosphere that may even eclipse bands natives in the genre largely thanks to the fact that\n\nRichard Lederer has been really inspired and brilliant in this album.\n\nFor all those Summoning lovers out there, that would like to approach to new sounds, you will easily recognize the Richard Lederer signature in the 8 tracks, because the whole album is composed with the same winning formula used to create the Summoning songs. The atmosphere and melodies of “Nullify” will be so familiar for you all, specially in tracks like “Forsaken”, “Death Parade”, “Empty Shrine”, “Reunion” or “Chasm”\n\nYou can listen to the whole album here: https://iceages.bandcamp.com/\n\nDIE VERBANNTEN KINDER EVAS “Nachtaugen: Live In Vaduz” DVD [Cat.Ref.:TOD050/DVD]\n\nPrice: 15,00 €\n\nIn 1996, Die Verbannten Kinder Evas and Weltenbrand performed live in the city of Vaduz, Liechtenstein. The event was recorded, mixed and later that year released on split VHS tape, by M.O.S. Records Ltd., as “Nachtaugen, Live In Vaduz.”\n\nThe first press released to the public, currently known as the “Extended Version”, had a total duration of 70 minutes and featured both live concerts plus one video-clip of each band as\n\nbonus. In the later re-presses, the two bonus video-clips were omitted, resulting in a tape of only 60 minutes.\n\nThe DVD you´re holding in your hand, is the reissue of the “Extended Version” tape in digital format, including only Die Verbannten Kinder Evas´ video footage, that is his live performance & bonus video-clip.\n\nTo be faithful to the original, the film has been preserved in its unaltered form, hence the reason why the 4:3 aspect ratio and the 1996 mixing have been maintained. However, to improve the visual experience, we have added extra material providing the DVD with a menu, an outro and also a photo gallery.\n\nAdditionally, the original video and audio have been remastered using the latest technology and post-production techniques. For over a year now, a team of professionals have been working closely together, to archive both the highest possible image and sound quality. Once we reached the optimal result, we proceeded to the migration of the original remastered recording from analog format to digital format.\n\nThe original recording was previously only available on analogue VHS tapes, a fragile medium with a limited life-span, consequently it was condemned to disappear over the next years. This type of recording media is prone to deterioration and degradation due to the chemical decay of the tape’s magnetic components.\n\nTherefore, this DVD can be considered a relic, not only because we have managed to rescue the only visual document of Die Verbannten Kinder Evas to date, but also because it has been improved and finally transcribed to the next generation of recording systems; the digital format. Amongst other feature, digital recording media has a life expectancy far superior to the already outdated magnetic videotapes. In that way, this DVD will preserve Die Verbannten Kinder Evas´ visual testimony over time.\n\nVinyl-effect DVD with a solid black ridged spiral running around the outside of the disc on the printed side, looking exactly like grooves in a vinyl record. Housed in a card wallet.\n\nThis DVD is the same which is included in the double vinyl set. If you are going to purchase the double vinyl set, you will receive this DVD as part of the set."
