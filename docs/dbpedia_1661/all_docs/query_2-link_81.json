        "text": "DLC Game Packs are individual content packs for Elder Scrolls Online. Following the release of Tamriel Unlimited, all future content updates will be released as DLC, while base game features, bug fixes, and other \"quality of life\" updates will accompany the DLC release as a free base game patch. The term 'DLC' is a misnomer, as all players download the DLC game packs and can even trade for certain DLC-specific items. DLC can be bought permanently from the in-game Crown Store; alternatively, ESO Plus members are given access to all DLC for the duration of their subscription. No progress is lost should you cancel ESO Plus without first purchasing the DLC, and all items and skills earned will remain accessible.\n\nLoyalty Rewards can be obtained by accessing DLC either through the Crown Store or through ESO Plus. Accessible DLC appears in the Collections tab, separate from regular Collectibles. The introductory quest for each DLC can be received through this menu, although doing so is optional, as the quests can also be received naturally through regular gameplay.\n\nNecrom is considered a \"Chapter\" rather than a DLC. Chapters are not available via ESO Plus or the Crown Store and are therefore not listed here. Morrowind, Summerset, Elsweyr, Greymoor, Blackwood, and High Isle were previously only available as Chapters, but they have since been made available in the Crown Store as DLC with the release of the following Chapter.\n\nDLC Bundles\n\nGuilds and Glory\n\nGet the first four Tamriel Unlimited DLC packs for one bargain price!
