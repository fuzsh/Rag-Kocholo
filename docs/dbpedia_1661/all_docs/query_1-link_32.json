        "text": "Steelfest is known for the sonic pleasure of the most obscure and brutal bands sharing two stages. The festival once again had an extremely strong line-up, offering killer bands from the front lines of the death/black metal genre, both underground and mainstream. Despite its relatively small size, the festival has an intimate feel. Those attending the fest definitely know what to expect during these three days. Regular weekend metal maniacs are more or less rare at the festival. Steelfest is hailed as one of the greatest festivals with all extreme bands on the bill. Seeing the crowd from abroad at the fest was a huge pleasure. The Metal-Rules.com team spent the whole weekend at Steelfest, witnessing killer bands… All Hail\n\nTHURSDAY\n\nHellbutcher\n\nWhen Nifelheim went on hiatus for one reason or another, Hellbutcher didn’t want to rest on his laurels. Instead, launching a band under his own name was the next obvious move. Of course, there are references to Nifelheim, known for giving wild and sadistic barbaric live performances. The Hellbutcher show at Steelfest was no exception. The whole band was in brutal shape throughout the gig. Members from several bands, like Unleashed, definitely sounded as extreme as they should. The set included the stuff from Nifelheim for obvious reasons and of course the Hellbutcher album. The crowd went utterly ballistic. With a vicious look, Hellbutcher literally slaughtered the Steelfest crowd.\n\nAntimateria\n\nAntimateria’s first and latest album, VALO AIKOJEN TAKAA, was released six years ago. To be honest, it is about time for their second album to come out. Nevertheless, Antimateria’s set included a huge amount of grand and eloquent riffs and melodies, along with the quintessential Finnish gloominess. Antimateria is a true interpreter of Finnish feelings and emotions, embodying classic Finnish melancholy.\n\nAeternus\n\nAeternus is one of those bands that have played at Steelfest before. The Norwegian death squad received a rather mixed response, so their return to the Steelfest stage was quite obvious. The four-piece deadly ensemble once again delivered a powerful set, mixing both black and death metal elements. The band sounded impressive and played both new and older material. Although the old material sounded killer, the band performed better and more convincingly this time. The audience followed the band’s performance attentively but did not display a ballistic reaction.\n\nHorna\n\nHorna had a three-day slot at Steelfest. The long-time Finnish black metal horde kicked off the first night with their original singer, Nazgul (the current frontman of Satanic Warmaster). The material was from the era when Nazgul fronted the band from 1996 to 2001. The songs were even more barbaric, rawer, and more primitive than before. The set included several black metal tracks from their heyday in the ’90s, such as “Kunnia Saatanalle” and “Tappakaa Kristus!” There was a special guest appearance from Behexen, with their frontman Torog joining for one song, “Pimeys yllä pyhän maan.” It was splendid to hear all those old tunes from the Nazgul era, as the material is still relevant and sounds as evil and grim as ever. These songs haven’t lost any of their impact. Nazgul’s performance with Horna was undoubtedly one of the highlights of Steelfest.\n\nUnleashed\n\nUnleashed has remained loyal to old school Swedish death metal since their inception. The four Swedes are known for being a Viking warship with massive artillery of head-banging riffs and sing-along lyrics. Unleashed is renowned for creating deadly hymns that sound crushingly heavy on stage. Their performance at Steelfest was no exception, delivering pure old school Swedish death metal. The set consisted of both older material from the classic albums released in the early 90s and, of course, newer material. Unleashed proved to be one hell of a brutal live act indeed.\n\nGorgoroth\n\nGorgoroth hit the indoor stage right after Unleashed. The Norwegian black metal squad kicked off the set with “Bergtrollets Hevn”. As usual, the whole band was fully armed with spikes, bullet belts, and, of course, grim-looking corpse paint. The black metal squad delivered a lesson in raw, barbaric black metal to the Steelfest crowd. The current frontman, Hoest, sounded as grim and raw as expected. Essentially, the gig was another day at the office for Gorgoroth. Clearly, the band would have needed some extra boost to unleash the raging black metal fury on stage.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nCadaveric Incubator\n\nThe three-piece death metal band Cadaveric Incubator has been nothing but brutal since their formation. Despite the early playing time and the scorching hot weather, Cadaveric Incubator delivered a lethal set of gore-filled raw death metal. Unfortunately, only a minimal crowd had arrived on time to check them out.\n\nChamber Of Unlight\n\nChamber Of Unlight could be viewed as an all-star line-up as members are different black metal bands such Horna, Ajattara and Deathchain. Therefore, it was quite obvious that the Chamber Of Unlight was going to spread blasphemous messages and bring the grim black metal approach. Vocalist Necrosis voice sounded splendidly fitting to the whole awesomeness of the music of Chamber Of Unlight, the whole five-piece were more or less in the vicious and lethal shape thru the whole set. There was a weak moment in the playing and the performance.\n\nEreshkigal\n\nThe next band was Ereshkigal from Mexico, taking the main stage under the blazing hot sun. Frankly, the band was relatively unknown to the festival crowd, even though they have been around since the early ’90s. However, they drew a good crowd interested in their music and performance. They indeed had the typical black metal war attire: studs, corpse paint, and so on. Musically, they offered an interesting mix of different elements of metal, including Mexican influences. Their black metal sounded absolutely fascinating with old school heavy metal aspects and, of course, those black metal elements. The band was on fire on stage and enjoyed every moment of their performance. Afterwards, people praised Ereshkigal a lot. No wonder why.\n\nInferno from the Czech Republic visited Steelfest some years ago and offered a dark ritual set. The Czech black metallers delivered a blend of traditional black metal with elements flirting with current religious themes and a gloomy sound. Inferno provided a special underground treat, as there were only a few attendees. Their “mystic and occult” antics may be somewhat clichéd, but they perfectly suited their mystic and dark stage performance.\n\nCorpsessed\n\nAnother Finnish extreme death metal band hit the main stage. Corpsessed have always delivered tight and brutal sets of uncompromising death metal, so their performance at Steelfest was definitely not a disappointment. The singer’s utterly brutal growling sounded absolutely splendid. The band could have played on an indoor stage to create a more deadly vibe in their set; however, their death metal totally crushed and killed.\n\nDélétère\n\nDélétère, a Canadian band, featured the Thornspawn member in the lineup. The band presented raw-sounding yet epic black metal. The band frontman’s deadly growing fitted perfectly to the epic yet sounded a bit too solid in some parts. The five pieces sounded kind of traditional black metal stuff, even though the songs had hooks and epic elements. But playing under the burning red hot sun wasn’t definitely the most idealistic timing and place for the Canadian black metallers. This kind of eerie-sounding black metal would have worked better on an indoor stage. However the band looked menace and brutal.\n\nKrzysztof Drabikowski’s Batushka\n\nBatushka had all the cards ready for immense success. However, things took a dramatic turn, and the band split into two different camps. Now, Krzysztof Drabikowski’s Batushka had been booked to perform at Steelfest. They featured mysterious murmuring, ritualistic chants, occult hand gestures, and eerie-looking robes with some Orthodox imagery. As for the music, it encompassed both religious and metallic elements in their super-mystical esoteric style, with a strong ritualistic effort in the performance. This version of Batushka received a good response from the audience, who followed the gig with great interest\n\nVed Buens Ende\n\nBlack metal is such an amazing form of music; it encompasses a wide range of different elements. Bands like Batushka, Blasphemy, and Horna each have their unique sound. Another interesting black metal combo from Norway was Ved Buens Ende. The band has a massive cult following but released only one album and one demo. The material of Ved Buens Ende sounded decidedly eccentric with an original approach that no other band can replicate. There are obvious prog metal elements combined with a black metal touch. Perhaps this kind of music would benefit from an indoor facility to create the desired atmospheric feeling.\n\nMisþyrming\n\nThe Icelandic black metal horde Misþyrming took to the indoor stage next. While Ved Buens Ende was quite mellow and sophisticated, the Icelandic black metallers instead unleashed a relentless gig full of pure aggressive energy. Their playing was undoubtedly tight and well-rehearsed. The entire performance was marked by extreme aggression and intense energy. Their music sounded truly grim, violent, and absolutely killer\n\nInfernal War\n\nInfernal War returned to Steelfest after their previous gig was interrupted due to the drummer’s condition. This time, the Polish blackened death metal squad made up for it by delivering a set of raw and barbaric blackened death metal. The five-piece band was extremely furious throughout the entire set, showing no mercy.\n\nHorna\n\nHorna, second day and second set and of course second singer. Horna continued with the second vocalist Corvus on the mic. The material was for obvious reasons from his era. As usual Horna with Corvus sounded raw as hell. The set was kicked off with ”Vihan Tien” was followed by ”Kuoleva Lupaus”, ”Verilehto” etc. The current frontman of Korgonthurus Corvus didn’t communicate nearly at all, Horna unleashed the brutal, yet amazing black metal set.\n\nKroda\n\nKroda have visited Steelfest twice before and received a good response and following. Therefore, seeing them again at Steelfest wasn’t a surprise. This time, the band drew a massive crowd, with the front line entirely packed as they took to the main stage. Apparently, their blackish pagan metal appealed to the audience quite well. Their music and performance reflected elements of paganism, as well as beauty and gloominess. For some eccentric reason, the frontman of Kroda was positioned towards the back of the stage, near the drummer’s riser. Kroda have established a strong following, making their appearances in Finland a certainty\n\nInquisition\n\nThe two-piece black metal squad Inquisition has always had strong support and received a great response at Steelfest. A huge crowd packed the front area of the stage and gathered in the indoor venue before Inquisition started their ceremony. Although Inquisition consists of just two members, they managed to create the ultimate black metal show with a cosmic and satanic atmosphere echoing throughout the indoor hall. The stage performance was centred on Dagon’s character and movements. Inquisition concluded the first day with a prestigious performance, not letting anyone down. Dagon spoke occasionally, but the music spoke for itself, and the audience was spellbound. The band sounded majestically bombastic\n\nSATURDAY\n\nTorsofuck\n\nThornspawn\n\nThornspawn from Texas is a long-time primitive-sounding black metal outfit. Both “Blood of the Holy, Taint Thy Steel” and “Wrath of War” albums are testament to their raw, barbaric sounding black metal. Unfortunately, playing in the daytime under the searing sun wasn’t the most ideal timing for Thornspawn to perform their black metal. The band would have thrived in a darker setting and atmosphere. Obviously, the band had some hired guns in the lineup, as the second guitarist seemed to watch how others played. Nevertheless, Thornspawn sounded utterly grim and primitive.\n\nSarkrista\n\nThe German black metal band Sarkrista is not a new name on the roster of Steelfest. The black metal horde spread their message of black metal a few years ago. On their second visit, Sarkrista conquered the main stage. Sarkrista has ‘received the goods’ and gained a cult following here in Finland. As a result, the German black metallers drew a very large crowd. Regarding their gig, the frontman Revenant turned out to be a dominating character, taking the audience under his wing. His way of performing songs was intense and controlling, leaving the other members more in the background. Sarkrista’s music includes some influences from Finnish black metal bands, but they certainly have their own unique sound. If the name Sarkrista did not ring a bell for some people, they definitely gained quite a few new followers.\n\nDiocletian\n\nDiocletian, hailing from New Zealand, hit the indoor stage next. Obviously, the band members have relocated to other countries from New Zealand. The band shares the same spirit as Revenge, Conqueror, and, of course, the festival’s main headliner, Blasphemy. Diocletian clearly has a close bond with Blasphemy, as some members have played in that band. Nevertheless, Diocletian’s music sounded absolutely barbaric, raw, and nihilistic. Diocletian didn’t show any mercy or slow down.\n\nBarathrum\n\nThe Finnish grand old black metal patrol Barathrum has been spreading death and destruction since the ’80s. The squad enjoys a maniacal cult following and has gone through a colourful history over the years. Despite the singer’s reputation for being quite a character, the band delivered a vicious and brutal set of eerie-sounding black metal. Barathrum is known for being dangerous and unpredictable. Obviously, technical problems plagued the set a bit, as it took some time to fix the guitar. Despite that, Barathrum’s set consisted of all the essential songs such as “Warmetal,” “I am Possessed,” and “Saatana,” as well as an entirely new song from their upcoming album, which sounded just as Barathrum should.\n\nWhite Death\n\nWhite Death has caused scandalous events at previous shows, such as when the singer was crucified at the last Steelfest. Naturally, the band had new ideas up their sleeve this time. They dragged a lamb’s carcass, which had rotted quite badly and emitted the ultimate reek of putrefaction. A butcher-like figure attempted to chop off the carcass’s head for half of the set, while the band played and performed during the slaughter. It is always expected that some kind of scandalous event will happen at a White Death show, and their music definitely sounded raw and nihilistic\n\nAcherontas\n\nAcherontas, hailing from Greece, hit the main stage. The band had visited Steelfest a few years back and gained respectful interest from the audience. As usual, the faces of each member of Acherontas were covered by some kind of neckerchief with various occult symbols. The ethereal black metal hymns of Acherontas had the well-known Hellenic vibe in their sound. Frankly, Greek mythological black metal has always been unique, with a special tune and trademark in its sonic world. Acherontas definitely sounded distinctive and had an occult aura in their approach.\n\nDødheimsgard\n\nThe Norwegian avant-garde black metal squad Dødheimsgard hit the outdoor stage next. They kicked off the set with “Et smelter” from their latest album, followed by “Sonar Bliss” and “The Snuff Dreams Are Made Of.” Vocalist Vicotnik’s performance and movements on stage were quite personal and eccentric, yet he embodied the music and lyrics perfectly. He was dressed in a peculiar-looking jacket with distinctive face paint. He also had some strange green paint or glitter in his pocket, which he spread around the stage, covering band members and the audience. This somehow reflected the lyrics. At one point, the frontman even jumped into the security pit to engage with the crowd.\n\nHorna\n\nThis was the third Horna slot. As mentioned before, the band performed every day with different singers covering material from their respective eras. On the third day, the current frontman, Spellgoth, took the stage to perform songs from his era. Even though Horna has become a leading name in the Finnish black metal scene, the band has played at quite a few festivals. The set kicked off with “Askel Lähempänä Saatanaa” and was followed by numerous other mesmerizing blackish hymns such as “Kunnia Herralle, Kuninkaalle”, “Nielkää Tuhkaa”, “Saatanan Viha”, and many more. Spellgoth has always been a superb performer and interpreter of Horna’s lyrics. Horna sounded extremely good and nasty as always.\n\nBlasphemy\n\nBlasphemy have performed at Steelfest once before, so their return to the festival was more or less expected. The Canadian black metal skinheads relied on the force of primitive and barbaric black metal onslaught for 60 minutes. Blasphemy was undeniably brutal and barbaric in their musical approach. Black Winds, with his eerie appearance, brutal voice, and raw outlook, commanded the stage. The set was a pure savage, featuring songs from their two albums. This was how raw and barbaric black metal should sound.\n\nMysticum\n\nMysticum concluded the entire three-day festival event by delivering an extreme, apocalyptic, and nihilistic performance in the indoor venue. The fusion of sonic industrial and barbaric black metal approaches truly sounded eerie and menacing. In addition to terrorizing the audience with their apocalyptic sonic torment, the visual aspects played a crucial role in their performance. The strobe lights flashed continuously throughout the gig, nearly inducing epileptic seizures in some. The trio of Norwegian blackened industrial artists delivered an absolutely amazing performance. The guys appeared to be in excellent shape, evident from their decision to perform shirtless.\n\nwww.steelfest.fi"
