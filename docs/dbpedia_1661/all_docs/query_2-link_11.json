        "text": "This article is about recordings released after Hendrix's death. For releases during Hendrix's lifetime, see Jimi Hendrix discography.\n\nStudio albums13Live albums28Singles28Soundtrack albums2Anthologies and retrospective albums19EPs and special releases27Official bootlegs23\n\nJimi Hendrix (1942–1970) was an American guitarist whose career spanned the years between 1962 and 1970. His posthumous discography includes recordings released after September 18, 1970. Hendrix left behind many recordings in varying stages of completion.[2] This material, along with reissues of his career catalogue, has been released over the years in several formats by various producers and record companies. Since Experience Hendrix, a company owned and operated by members of the Hendrix family, took control of his recording legacy in 1995,[3] over 15 Hendrix albums have appeared on the main US albums chart.[4] Several of these have also placed on charts in more than 18 countries around the world.[5]\n\nAt the time of his death, Hendrix was recording songs for a fourth studio album. He was working on enough material for a double album and had sketched out possible track lists. However, only about six songs were nearing completion, with an additional twenty or so in different stages of development. The first attempt at presenting Hendrix's fourth studio album, a single LP record titled The Cry of Love, was released in 1971 and reached number three on Billboard's album chart.[4] A second attempt titled Voodoo Soup, with some different songs and a new audio mix, was released in 1995 and appeared at number 66.[4] In 1997, Experience Hendrix restored the original mixes and added several songs for a third release: the double-album length First Rays of the New Rising Sun, the first to use one of Hendrix's proposed titles, reached number 49.[4]\n\nIn addition to songs planned for a fourth studio album, numerous demos, studio outtakes/alternate takes, and jams have been released. Albums of concert performances and compilations focusing on various aspects of Hendrix's work have been issued. From 1970 to 1992, his record companies Reprise Records in the US and Track Records/Polydor Records in the UK continued to handle his recordings. MCA Records took over in 1992, during the controversial tenure of subsequent producer Alan Douglas.[2] Since 2010, Sony/Legacy Recordings has been distributing the releases produced by Experience Hendrix.[15] Besides legitimate releases, many bootleg and grey market albums have appeared over the years. Many of these have been reissued several times with different album titles, packaging, and song titles. Some purporting to feature Hendrix as a sideman have been shown to be fake. To meet the demand, Dagger Records was established in 1998 to issue \"official bootlegs\" of albums \"that don't meet the technical recording criteria\" and standards for mainstream release.[21] These have included live recordings from various points in his career as well as demo and rehearsal recordings.[2]\n\nStudio recordings\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album details Peak chart positions Certifications\n\n(sales thresholds) US\n\n[4] UK\n\n[22] Other\n\n[5] US release UK release 1971 The Cry of Love 3 2 [a]\n\nRIAA: Platinum[24]\n\nReleased: March 5, 1971\n\nLabel: Reprise (MS 2034)\n\nFormat: LP record\n\nReleased: March 5, 1971\n\nLabel: Track (2408 101)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nRainbow Bridge 15 16 [b]\n\nRIAA: Gold[24]\n\nReleased: October 1971\n\nLabel: Reprise (MS 2040)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nReleased: November 1971\n\nLabel: Reprise (K44159)\n\nFormat: LP\n\n1972 War Heroes 48 23 [c]\n\nReleased: December 1972\n\nLabel: Reprise (MS 2103)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nReleased: October 1, 1972\n\nLabel: Polydor (2302 020)\n\nFormat: LP\n\n1974 Loose Ends — — — Not released\n\nReleased: February 1974\n\nLabel: Polydor (2310 301)\n\nFormat: LP\n\n1975 Crash Landing 5 35 [d]\n\nRIAA: Gold[24]\n\nReleased: March 1975\n\nLabel: Reprise (MS 2204)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nReleased: August 1975\n\nLabel: Polydor (2310 398)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nMidnight Lightning 43 46 —\n\nReleased: November 1975\n\nLabel: Reprise (MS 2229)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nReleased: November 1975\n\nLabel: Polydor (2310 415)\n\nFormat: LP\n\n1980 Nine to the Universe 127 — —\n\nReleased: March 1980\n\nLabel: Reprise (HS 2299)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nReleased: June 1980\n\nLabel: Polydor (2344 155)\n\nFormat: LP\n\n1995 Voodoo Soup 66 83 —\n\nReleased: April 1, 1995\n\nLabel: MCA (MCAD-11236)\n\nFormat: CD\n\nReleased May 1995\n\nLabel: MCA\n\nFormat: CD, cassette\n\n1997 First Rays of the New Rising Sun 49 37 [e]\n\nReleased: April 22, 1997\n\nLabel: MCA (11599)\n\nFormats: CD, LP\n\nReleased: April 22, 1997\n\nLabel: MCA\n\nFormats: CD, LP\n\nSouth Saturn Delta 51 — [f]\n\nReleased: October 7, 1997\n\nLabel: MCA (11684)\n\nFormats: CD, LP\n\nReleased: October 7, 1997\n\nLabel: MCA\n\nFormats: CD, LP\n\n2010 Valleys of Neptune[33] 4 21 [g]\n\nReleased: March 9, 2010\n\nLabel: Legacy (88697 64056 2)\n\nFormats: CD, double LP\n\nReleased: March 8, 2010\n\nLabel: Sony\n\nFormat: CD\n\n2013 People, Hell and Angels[34] 2 30 [h]\n\nReleased: March 5, 2013\n\nLabel: Legacy (88765 41898 2)\n\nFormats: CD, double LP\n\nReleased: March 4, 2013\n\nLabel: Sony\n\nFormat: CD\n\n2018 Both Sides of the Sky[35] 8 8 [i]\n\nReleased: March 9, 2018\n\nLabel: Legacy (19075 81419 2)\n\nFormats: CD, double LP\n\nReleased: March 9, 2018\n\nLabel: Sony\n\nFormat: CD, double LP\n\n\"—\" denotes a release that did not chart or was not issued in that region.\n\nLive albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album details Peak chart positions Certifications\n\n(sales thresholds) US\n\n[4] UK\n\n[22] Other\n\n[5] US release UK release 1971 Woodstock Two[j] 8 — —\n\nRIAA: Gold[24]\n\nReleased: April 1971\n\nLabel: Cotillion (SD 2-400)\n\nFormat: 2LP record\n\nReleased: April 1971\n\nLabel: Atlantic (K600002)\n\nFormat: 2LP\n\nExperience — 9 [k] Not released\n\nReleased: August 1971\n\nLabel: Ember (NR 5057)\n\nFormat: LP record\n\nThe First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies:\n\nIsle of Wight/Atlanta Pop Festival[l] 47 — —\n\nReleased: September 1971\n\nLabel: Columbia (G3X 30805)\n\nFormat: 3LP\n\nReleased: October 1971\n\nLabel: CBS (S 66311)\n\nFormat: 3LP\n\nIsle of Wight — 17 [m] Not released\n\nReleased: November 1971\n\nLabel: Polydor (2302 016)\n\nFormat: LP\n\n1972 Hendrix in the West 12 7 [n]\n\nRIAA: Gold[24]\n\nReleased: February 1972\n\nLabel: Reprise (MS 2049)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nReleased: January 1972\n\nLabel: Polydor (2302 018)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nMore Experience — — — Not released\n\nReleased: March 1972\n\nLabel: Ember (NR 5061)\n\nFormat: LP\n\n1982 The Jimi Hendrix Concerts 79 16 [o]\n\nReleased: August 1982\n\nLabel: Reprise (MS 2306-1)\n\nFormat: 2LP, audio cassette\n\nReleased: August 1982\n\nLabel: CBS (88592)\n\nFormat: 2LP, cassette\n\n1986 Jimi Plays Monterey 192 — [p]\n\nReleased: February 1986\n\nLabel: Reprise (25358-1)\n\nFormats: CD, LP, cassette\n\nNot released Johnny B.
