        "text": "Varathron | Horna | Grave Miasma | Tortorum | Fides Inversa\n\nLive at The Dome in London – May 2, 2015\n\nWritten & photographed by James Speers / Speers Propaganda\n\nA common attribute to music, particularly music that draws influence from social, religious and mythological history, is identity. It is not uncommon for a band to evoke or reflect such an element that is native to their country of origin to an extent. Commonly, this is done as a point of reference without the need for said element to become an overarching motive behind the music. In the arena of death and black metal, these relevant influences are more often than not universally abundant, as opposed to stemming from a singular national or cultural background. Common ideas, coming from various backgrounds, are shared with an end goal in mind. This being music that explores themes of mortality, the encroaching afterlife, death obsessions and the occult – these themes are not exclusive to metal and aren’t likely to go out of vogue within this vast genre any time soon. A common result of these explorations lead to an assemblage of musicians which will play together on a common ground, employing their own interpretations of these elements and simultaneously taking influence from and representing their own native backgrounds. Here we have an assortment of bands from across Europe, gathering from Italy, Norway, Britain, Finland and Greece, to present their takes on these nihilistically unifying themes.\n\nThe opening act for this eclectic line-up are Fides Inversa from Italy, who bring to the throngs their latest material from the new album, Mysterium Tremendous et Fascinans – as the title may imply, they take their cues from Latin history. Fides Inversa nail home these influences during their set by punctuating with interludes of monastic chants, while standing with their backs to the audience, hoods always up, before moving into the next arrangement. The counterbalance to this aesthetic is their style of metal, which is played highly articulately and calculatedly, giving them a freedom to drift and waltz around the stage to their music. During this display, it’s not uncommon for some of their members to appear blissful, passionate and euphoric as they play, while the lights swirl and mist drifts throughout the stage – which provides their style of death metal a far more ‘romantic’ edge. The line they draw between aesthetic and performance is distinct, while this balance is maintained, things never seem to fully become one. Their image remains an ‘image’ rather than becoming fully integrated into the music, arguably this is something which besets many black and death metal bands, as it makes it feel like basic rock ’n’ roll. As openers, Fides Inversa set the bar as more than just an appropriate act, their musicianship is decidedly solid. Even as a relatively new act, they have left a deep, lasting impression.\n\nThe Norwegian Tortorum, on the other hand, feel very removed from the distinct visual appearance of Fides Inversa. Comparatively, they complement their sound with a presence that perfectly mirrors their music. Already with a strong approach in hand, their newest work, Katabasis, is performed with intense accuracy, strongly bringing across its eerie qualities with a passion that is almost violent in its delivery. Vocalist Barghest is highly animated, dressed head-to-toe in a monk’s robe upon taking the stage, his face obscured by his hood with only his bared teeth gleaming. He throws it off to reveal his bloody, shaven head and powder-covered face as he scowls at his audience. The rest of the band are similarly covered in blood and powder while coated in an atmospheric, red lighting. The members are entirely composed and focused, almost meditative – guitarist Skyggen’s eyes bulge at the audience throughout the room. As they march through songs, Barghest is highly entranced, characteristically conveying their atonal sound. This straddling of aesthetics and performance suits the band well, stepping them up from what can be perceived as basic rock ’n’ roll antics and harkening back to original black metal aesthetics without fully diluting the form. Their progression culminates in a fantastical performance of “Beyond the Earth and Air and Sun”, just as they do on Katabasis, giving themselves an appropriately malevolent exit.\n\nIn a contrast to the previous two bands, stage theatrics take a backseat to performance with the London-based, homegrown Grave Miasma. While the band appear in make-up less extravagant and guises more obvious than that of the previous two acts, their musicianship remains as the most top-notch so far. The initial aesthetic difference makes Grave Miasma appear a little underwhelming thanks to the energy brought on by Tortorum. It is a lull that is brief however, as the cavernous sound of their work roaringly fills the hall. The effect is that of something highly influenced and concentrated, the vocals never slip away from being anything less than strong and hoarse, tremolo picked riffs create a layered wall of noise against a backdrop of heavily pounding drums and rhythmic guitar – it is an overall very focused and directed death metal effort. If anything, Grave Miasma carry an atmosphere of lurking evil on their sound alone.\n\nThe penultimate and biggest band on so far are Horna from Finland. Returning to the energy summoned up by Tortorum and building upon it in graphically, their ritual-like proceedings are both lengthy and blackly. Their catalog is extensive and I’m admittedly only familiar with their newest album, Askel lähempänä Saatanaa. Despite my familiarity being limited, the material from this album translates morbidly and evocatively live. With twenty years of dedicated work under their belt, the result is a primitive and unsophisticated style of black metal. It’s a style which sounds like an incredibly well-harnessed concoction of such elements, however. Spellgoth’s vocals are sickly and blood-curdling, he gurgles wildly throughout the performance, able to transform his shrieks to bellows without a break in form before returning to crying maliciously. This against the backdrop of a lowly haunting guitar perfectly characterizes their developed approach to producing something so aurally substratal and evil. Their sound drips with a daunting amount of dread as the drums batter away. The effect is outright thunderous compared to their slightly more dungeon-entrapped sound on record. Much like Tortorum, Horna’s aesthetic and visual appearance is made into a very integral part of their performance, carried almost exclusively by Spellgoth who radiates with an unsettling presence. He stares without flinching, dangles a pentagram coupled with prayer beads from his hand along with a huge chain and cross. He later disrobes himself to reveal his tattooed body and his movements are fully composed and trance-like. Their bassist, Infection stands over the audience with a bold presence while guitarist Shatraug looks on with a deathly gaze. Spellgoth’s lingering, crawling movements and meditative stance heighten his immersive display to that of a seance for the audience.\n\nThe final act, as suitably heralded by those prior, are the Hellenic masters Varathron, who have been firmly anticipated during the previous bands’ equally ardent performances. As one might have guessed, the trait of band members individually clad in black hoods with faces hidden is not unique tonight. Regardless, Varathron has this appear as a type of informal uniform to match their driven, near-martial sound. Singer Stefan Necroabyssius’ presence is strong as he animatedly stamps about the stage, a clenched fist extended out to the audience as he blares out his skillful range of dense vocals. With material most distinguishable from their newest album, Untrodden Corridors of Hades, and also from earlier releases, the temperament of their live performance is fierce. Its weighty sound is effortlessly carried by the band and thrown against the audience. Amidst the structured assortment of strident riffs and collected blastbeats come the heraldic chanting of the opening to the song “Cabalistic Invocation of Solomon”. Necroabyssius stoutly takes to the centre of the stage with a wooden-encased scripture as light beams behind him, the sight of the theatrics coupled with the menacing instrumentation eclipses every prior stunt tonight during this extensive section. This energy does not lapse in the least bit and is carried out straight toward their exit, providing a very satisfying ending to a long event.\n\nIn all, the night has been extremely well-delivered with little-to-no technical hiccups and a highly maintained atmosphere which has been kept throughout. The quality of each band’s performance has been consistent, while the spectacle was increased more and more with each new song. Each band has demonstrated how they can prove themselves aurally and visually, with many strengths prevalent on the common ground of shared themes in their music, as well as in each other’s individual backgrounds."
