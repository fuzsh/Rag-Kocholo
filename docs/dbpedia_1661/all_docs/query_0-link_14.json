Selected by Erick Morillo and blended by Subliminal's Richard F, this is a superb set. “It’s a classic example of up-down motion,\" says Richard. “When I spin, I like to hit the crowd with three banging records and then drop off a little bit. Peaks and valleys are what makes a good DJ.\" The latest addition to the Subliminal crew, Richard F hooked up with the New Jersey jocks through the good word of Harry ‘Choo Choo’ Romero. | “I had a record out called ‘Good Love’,\" recalls the not-quite-native New 5 Yorker. “Harry played it at a gig in Toronto and Erick went mad for it. | Soon after I was invited to join the camp.\" i Richard ’s been hooked up with Subliminal for just over a year now. | Thankfully, things are still pretty crazy. Tm trying to stay out of trouble, \" I he laughs, “but I’m not doing a very good job of it!” 1 MONGOBONIX Mas Pito Richard: “A classic Subliminal record. ‘Mas Pito’ is pure jazz with an element of funk, and the sax is the sound of two genres clashing together. I ’ve yet to drop this tune and not hear someone scream.” 2 RICHARD F Feels So Strong Richard: “This record is doing even better than we expected! It’s got a great jazz sample and a vocal from Paulette. People really love this record in Ibiza - which is great, cos it’s one of mine!\" 3 DA MOB FEATURING JOCELYN BROWN It’s All Good (Full Intention Mix) Erick: “‘It’s All Good’ started out as an expression I’m known for saying. So when Jocelyn Brown came into the studio, she suggested that we write about it. This song sums up our whole attitude to life. Which is to have fun and not let things get to you.\" 4 HARRY ‘CHOO CHOO’ ROMERO Beats Volume One (Beetle Mix) Erick: “This is the first in a new series for us - and after six months of promises, Harry’s finally delivered! It’s got seriously slammin’ techno beats. It’s a reminder that if Subliminal want to go in a tech-house direction, we can. We have a sister label coming out at the end of September and a tech-house label due in December. These beats are having it!\" 5 MONGOBONIX FEATURING INAYADAY I Will (Congobonix Dub) Richard: “Another phat tune. This is the dub mix of Harry’s new record . He’s got a great 6 MZK • * PRESENTS THE SUMMER SOUND OF SUBLIMINAL MIXED BY RICHARD F feel for deep, underground anthems, so this is another peak-time record. It reminds me of ‘In My Life' - it’s got that same dancefloor vibe.” 6 BOB SINCLAR I Feel For You (Acappella) Richard: \"Those French guys are really funking it up right now and this tune is phenomenal. I first heard it at Central Fly in New York and it gave me goosebumps in the DJ booth. Not too many records on the market can do that.\" 7 TANGA CHICKS FEATURING DIMITRI AND TOM Brasil Over Zurich (Original Mix) Richard: \"Another party record. It doesn’t matter where you're from - if you hear this in a club, you’re gonna feel it. It’s a huge tune at Ministry as well as in New York. It's got that whole Brazilian, Latin vibe going on.\" 8 BOTELLA PROJECT Sensual Confessions (The Club Dub Mix) Erick: “This was originally a demo that made its way to Subliminal a while back from a guy in Benelux. I thought it had real potential and energy. He re-tweaked the track and a monster was born. It just goes to prove that we do listen to our demos! \" 9 ATFC PRESENTS ONEPHATDEEVA FEATURING LISA MILLETT Bad Habit (Acappella) Richard: ‘“Bad Habit' is based on a DJ Dove record that originally came out on Catch 22. I played the hell out of that at the time, so I was a little cautious when I first heard this. Then I saw the crowd reaction. Who can’t relate to what she’s singing about?\" 10 RICHARD GREY Stand Up Erick: \"Richard Grey is another producer who sent in a demo to our office. Steely Dan provide the inspiration for this one. The whole EP is quality, but this one really kicks ass!\" 11 PIANOHEADZ Distortion (Harry's Trifling Bitch Mix) Richard: “This is such a classic record. It’s one of the first records Subliminal put out, actually. 'Distortion' is so ahead of its time - the bassline just moves you. And worked in the right way, people go absolutely nuts!” FIVE CLASSIC SUBLIMINAL MOMENTS Da Mob Featuring Jocelyn Brown ‘It's All Good’ Ministers-De-La-Funk Believe' Constipated Monkeys 'Cro-Magnum' Da Mob Featuring Jocelyn Brown ‘Fun’ Jose Nunez Featuring Octahvia 'In My Life' FIVE FUTURE SUBLIMINAL MOMENTS Tanga Chicks Featuring Dimitri And Tom ‘Brasil Over Zurich’ Mongobonix Featuring Inaya Day ‘I Will’ The Committee ‘Scream And Shout' (New Full Vocal Mixes) ATFC 'Bad Habit' (Todd Gardner Mixes) Antoine Clamaron The Energy’ FIVE GOOD REASONS TO LIVE IN NEW YORK The Blue Ribbon on Sullivan Street Erick: “This restaurant’s got everything - and the kitchen is open until four in the morning. From steak to seafood, it's very consistent. There’s no sign outside, but everybody comes here, even Puffy!” The Nightlife Richard: “I only go to one party a week - and that’s Subliminal Sessions at Central Fly on 21 st Street every Thursday from 1 1 till 5.30! It’s very much in a Ministry vibe. Everyone from Derrick Carter to Cassius has spun here. \" Culturally Mixed People Erick: “Nowhere else in the world do you have such racial harmony. We still hate the police, of course!\" Opportunity Richard: \"You can't live in New York and work in a gas station. The cost of living is so high that you have to swim hard to tread water. But there are a lot of opportunities here in NYC.” Convenience Erick: “Everything is at your fingertips here - including one hour video delivery! New York has three airports, so it’s easy to catch a flight pretty much anywhere.” mzk r MUZIK Q&A „„ uju SR; /i m ON TIME TO BURN’, MARADONA AND SHAGGING PAOHA DANCERS THERE ARE TWO SIDE5TO MARK SPOON. One is the humble, culture- loving aesthete with a penchant for fine wine and cigars. The other is a Pacha-crashing , Space-slaying spinner from the darkest depths of Frankfurt. Spoon’s clubland antics are legendary. The larger half of Jam & Spoon (think ‘Stella’ - both the tune and the drink) is in Ibiza for the opening of Xtravaganza’s monumental party at Privilege, As if that wasn 't enough, his latest Storm solo effort, ‘Time To Burn’ is the biggest thing on the White Island this summer. MUZIK: ‘Time To Bum' is the hottest tune of Ibiza 2000. . . MS: \"Ze first Storm record vas big but zis von is even bigger. It’s ein huge tune! It’s ein enormous record everywhere. It's selling in 22 countries. Even Colombia!” MUZIK: Your reputation is one of unashamed hedonism. MS: \"Vot is hedonism? It’s a question of lifestyle, ja? You can cross ze road and die or you can live your life and be free. I just do what I vantto do.” MUZIK: What do you think of the UK dance music scene? MS: \"Tall Paul ist ein good friend of mine - 1 mixed his last single on Duty Free. Also I am massive fan of Sasha. Vee played ze Space opening party together earlier zis summer. Who eez my favourite DJ? Me, myself and Ich!\" MUZIK: We understand you’ve been banged up twice. . . “Zere are zo many stones! Five or six years ago I vas playing on ze terrace at Space and ze guy who runs the club saw me taking an E und called ze polizei. I vent to jail for five days. Zey needed to make ein example of somevun well-known for ze papers and it just happened to be me.” MUZIK: You’re a dedicated follower of Pacha. What have you got up to there? MS: \"Zee best club in ze vorld! Mein proudest moment voz fucking three dancers from Pacha at ze same time backstage. Und having Diego Maradona right next to me doing a line! Zat voz a very proud moment, ja. Diego vonted to join in. I sent him away.” MUZIK: No regrets, though? MS: “I regret not letting him join me. But I said I didn’t vont him joining in. Ivould prefer Mike Manumission, because he could bring Claire, nein? Jade Jagger could join us as well. But ze most sexiest girl on ze island has got to be Amber from The Blue Rose strip club.” MUZIK: You really love Ibiza, don’tyou? MS: \"It’s ein honour to play here und a very emotional thing to play in a club like Privilege. YSTtJ can say vot you like about Manumission but ze energy is incredible. Es Vedra ist ein magical place. Ibiza ist full of special people leading special lives.” ‘Time To Bum’ is out now on Data. Don’t miss it!

DearMuzik readers, I’M sitting here on my flight back from Ibiza to New York nursing a hangover and reading the August issue of Muzik, featuring some dodgy geezer on the front cover. For all you people out there who might be thinking “what a cocky wanker\", I’d like to put a few things straight. For starters, I do not believe that ALL women want to f~* the DJ (well , maybe 80%) or that all British men go out only to getf* ~ed up (well, maybe 90%), and as far as being in the lead with the ladies, if I’m out with 1 0 British guys, this could only work if Robbie Williams, Sasha or Darren Emerson were out of town! So, those of you who were offended by my comments, chill out because IT’S ALL GOOD! Erick Morillo PS I'm also searching for a young DJ called Si Edwards who passed on a tape to me at Muzik’s Fifth Birthday party at AKA. I am incredibly impressed by the mix and wantyou to reach out to me at my Subliminal office in New Jersey, as I would like to feature your talent at a future Subliminal Sessions party. To all the DJs out there - you can never be too persistent. Lady readers: Are you one of Erick’s lucky 80%? Have you had a hot night with a top jock like Erick, Mark Sp oon or Phat Phil Cooper? Call our D J sex hotline on 020-7261-5993. NOT SO CAPITAL Dear Muzik, CAN someone please explain to me why London clubbers have become such a bunch of arrogant tossers? Pretentious doesn’t begin to describe the people surrounding me at a recent Bedrock night. With two of the most influential DJs in the world playing on the same night, I was appalled to find people hanging around the bar, generally chatting and, at worst, even in another room. Surely people in London haven’t totally forgotten how to enjoy themselves? If that’s the case, thank God I now live in Glasgow. Long live Sasha and Diggers, and a quick death to VI P bars. Chris King, Glasgow What’s wrong with VIP bars? Where else are we to get coke blown up our arses by naked dwarves? You won’t get that in Glasgow, mate. ARE FRIENDS ECLECTIC? DearMuzik, IN your 23 Skidoo article, you mentioned that their new single is being championed by “more open-minded DJs” like Gilles Peterson and Ashley Beedle. It is hard to find the music they play very open-minded! This can be said open-minded - playing all these songs together in the same set: Darude, Slipknot, Oasis, Cypress Hill, Korn, Limp Bizkit, The Roots, Finntelligens, Aqua (remixed), Sasha, BT and Eminem. Try to mix these and then talk about open-minded! Jarno, Helsinki, Finland Sorry, Jamo. We fell asleep In the middle of that list. EMPTY GARAGE DearMuzik, WHEN Radio 1 goes out live at events like Homelands, why does the station always seem to focus on the trance tents? There are DJs in the garage arena who should get more recognition - bring on Full Intention, Peppermint Jam and the rest! Dave Smith, Leeds I sonar Muzik's editorial 2000 I team prepares for another top VIPnightout SOMA HOLIDAY DearMuzik, GREAT to see an article on Sonar, which has to be the best techno/dance festival in Europe, and is definitely worthy of your two-page spread. However, you failed to mention the sturdy Spanish contingent. I arrived on Saturday morning to hear Marc Xocoa deliver a slow-burning performance that set the tone for the mad day that followed. Soma’s Funk D’Void, who’s now based in Barcelona, also played two ground-breaking sets for the Spanish public. Jim Mawdsley, Newcastle BOY’S GROAN DearMuzik, KEVIN Sampson’s article, Too Drugged To Ruck’ (Muzik 63) made most interesting reading. Modern clubbing and spending a wet Saturday afternoon being chased around grim back streets by a mob of speed- crazed, Stanley-wielding dole-heads in golfing jumpers have much in common. Fora start, both are generally not much fun. Andy Huckle, London Terry Ihrley replies: “If lever catch you around my manor, Andy, you’ll have the biggest Mars Bar in London. Get my drift?” BASS CADET DearMuzik, THANKS for mentioning me in your recent Moby feature. However, I was not actually a member of L7, although I did record on their ‘ Beauty Process' album - that honour went to the rocking Gail Greenwood, formerly of Belly. Bass Goddess Greta Brinkman Unfortunately, we were far too busy in the VIP bars, Jim. Thanks for clearing that up, Greta.

Young Euan was spotted so utterly bamboozled, bladdered and eventually unconscious in Leicester Square that the police had no choice but to arrest the young whippersnapper. Daddy stood up and told the world that it was sometimes harder being a father than being PM while little E (as he's never been known) looked suitably sheepish. Is this just the beginning? Could it be that Euan and Jack Straw’s son will shortly be dealing crack and running a stable of bitches in Stoke Newington? MARK SPOON What a cad I Not only did Mr Spoon break his hand dancing round the studio while making 'Time To Bum', the not-excessively- gorgeous Jam & Spoon jock also took a real shine to Muzik’s chief snapper on a recent photo shoot in Ibiza Town. “I can see your black panties,” he drooled as she took another shot of the super- heavyweight producer on a plush harbourside boat. We’re too embarrassed to tell you what he proposed next. But suffice it to say that she was somehow able to resist the paunchy, bald lothario’s blatant come-on. DANNY TEN AG LI A Flushed with his Muzik Letter Of The Month success, Danny's on a roll. MrT was spotted handing out little v/hite pills on the Trade dancefloor at Manumission one morning. However, on closer inspection, they turned out to be mints. MIDFIELD GENERAL And everyone else who dropped everything to spin at Wall Of Sound’s annual post- Essential Hobgoblin bash in Brighton. Sadly festivities had to cease when a hunger-crazed General threatened to eat the assembled throng. PAUL OAKEN FOLD It was a wee bit of a surprise when the DJ with no apparent lack of funds sat next to Muzik on a cheapo Air 2000 flight back to Blighty, after a Tuesday night at Pacha's Perfecto night. Could it be an attempt to get 'down with the kids'? YOUSEF Played two - count em! - stupendous sets at Cream recently at another packed Thursday night out. Then young Yous rubbed a fully-cooked flan onto his face. No, really. Well, you would, wouldn 't you? STEVE JACKSON Talk about two-step. Rocking the crowds in Ayia Napa after his unfair dismissal from Kiss FM, Steve's still out on his own, entertaining his people with or without the red tape. Just goes to show you can't keep a good man down. KARAOKE IN SAN ANTONIO If we hear ‘A Million Love Songs’ or 'You Got It' drifting into earshot one more time, we'll scream blue murder. Musical crimes are being committed on the streets of San Antonio. Doesn't anyone warble ‘Come To Daddy’ at these things? GAIL PORTER She may have been mobbed on the beach in San An, but her raving days could well be over. Despite being on the guest list for Cream at Amnesia, young Miss Porter spent the whole night in a car outside the club. Whatever can she have been doing? ALEXP Due to appear on an important Islander photo shoot, Brandon’s young friend was heard screaming on the beach at Bora Bora, incapable of anything except shaking wood in our direction. Not in the American porn sense though, regrettably. THE TABLOIDS How tiresome is the current attack on lovable homophobe Eminem in the inkies right now? The half-hearted outrage aimed at the world's biggest rap star will only result in one thing: more unit-shifting for Slim Shady. ARMAND VAN HELDEN The world’s dopest man successfully cleared the floor at Space with a hip hop set that the punk-ass punters found to be lacking in dope flavas. “Is it because I is crap?” a chastened Van Helden didn't say.

I’ve just spent the last three hours on my float - it was totally unbelievable!” Pete Tong is still recovering from the biggest one- day dance event in British history. Featuring floats from the brightest, brashest organisations in clubland - Gatecrasher and God’s Kitchen were particularly bruising - the highlights were innumerable. Yousef dropped disco bombs on the Cream float, Ashley Casselle got hard for the Gatecrasher crew and Danny Rampling gave The Lovegroove Dance Party a dose of ATFC's ‘Bad Habits’. Not since the heady daze of acid house has so much fun been had with so little money. Why pay forty quid for a wet festival ticket when Love Parade offers so much more for nowt, and with no mudbath? Over on the Dave Pearce disco float, the Man In The Cap is caning hard house and trance - several kids are even spotted swinging from trees to the sound of ‘Sandstorm’ by Darude. Quarter of a million people are having the time of their lives. Like Tongy said, it’s unbelievable.

Sponsored by Topman, it's brimming with lip-smacking lagers and high quality cocktails, and a prime venue for spotting the biggest stars on the island. Coxy, Carter, Morales and Morillo have all been spotted here. A haven for hip Spanish characters and the Ibizaratti, it’s the perfect pre-club bar for Pacha and El Divino. And in honour of The Islander's exclusive clientele, four new cocktails have been concocted for Ibiza 2000. See the box above for details. LATE ONE TUESDAY AFTERNOON, Danny Rampling props his moped outside El Divino and clambered aboard The Freedom Bus. Hours later, we’re still unable to prize him from the jacuzzi-fitted upstairs boudoir. “It's wonderful,” sighs the Lovegroove leader. If I could borrow the bus, I'd invite a load of mates on board, stop off at the Blue Rose and head down to Es Vedra. Then we'd wreak havoc in San Antonio! ’’ Powered by Freedom and sponsored by Durex, our sky- blue auto is busy promoting safe sex across Ibiza all summer. “It’s a great idea,” chuckles Rampers. “People get pretty frisky here, so it’s precisely what this island needs!” The Bus will also be distributing copies of The Islander on its summer of fun - on Saturdays you can find us at Dave Pearce's Ibiza Anthems at Eden, Tuesdays we stop off for Moneypenny's at El Divino, Wednesdays we're at Renaissance Live at Privilege and Fridays we're promoting the Safer Sex On The Beach Party at Pacha Playa Beach Bar.

Muzik understands that Gatecrasher’s weekly line-up will remain relatively unchanged, with Roger Sanchez remaining the club's key resident, while the weekly parties at Space will continue. Pacha’s Musical Director Danny Whittle spoke to Muzik about the move. “Even though we had disagreements, we just split amicably,” Whittle told Muzik. “None of the disagreements were worth getting angry over, we just decided that it was best for both parties to go on and do other things. A lot of it is down to cultural differences. Am I disappointed? A little bit. The Roger Sanchez connection was fantastic. But you have to move on,\" Pacha have now started their own mid-week Global parties featuring guests such as Darren | Emerson, who flew over at three days' notice to £ spin at Whittle's new night late last month. | 'We’re after a couple of superstar DJs,\" Whittle | revealed, “but I can’t tell you their names yet in * case it doesn't happen!\" | Pacha London is due to open at the former Raw H club in Great Russell Street in October 2000.

I’d refused to play there until they moved the DJ booth. It was just all wrong . You had your back to half the crowd and you were next to the barwhere no one was dancing. I don’t ask to be in God-like position, I just like the crowd to be able to see me and for me to be able to see them! They managed to get the new, repositioned booth finished in time for my gig with Danny Tenaglia and the room rocked. It’s changed the whole mood of the room and it was a phenomenal night. Mind you, Danny still wasn’t happy - because there wasn’t enough room for all his equipment! I ended up in Holland two days after they got knocked out of Euro 2000, but it didn’t seem to affect the crowd . 40,000 people in the Ajaxfootie stadium for Sensation, on the pitch, going crazy with the roof closed over their heads and fireworks all over the stadium. Imagine an indoors Homelands - it was like that. An amazing night. Berlin Love Parade was incredible as ever. There were about one and a half million people there. I ended up on Sven Vath's truck which is always the loudest and I think some of you may have heard me on Radio 1 . From Berlin, straight to muddy Scotland and T In The Park. It was brilliant. But wet. The spirit of the people was there, though -that’s the thing. We had a Slam Versus Ultimate Base soundclash - me and Jim Masters versus the Slam boys. But then Darren Emerson got up too, so we had five DJs on four decks battling it out, and it worked so well. Tunes like the new Jeff Mills and Slam's own 2000 remix of ‘Positive Education' mashed it up. Speaking of’ Positive Education', I'm still waiting for a cut of my own remix ofit-c’mon boys! www.djcarlcox.com Yousef / The Contender Yousef’s lO For August 1) Silicone Soul Bight On Right On (Soma) 2) KOT 6* Soul Vision Going Back To Blackvriz (Deep Vision) 3) Plastic Avengers Remix Graffiti Parts 16?2 (NRK) 4) Tanga Chicks Brasil Over Zurich (Subliminal) B) DE(jae Time (Dano’s Remix) (acetate) 6) Credence Summer Sampler (Credence) 7) Ian Poolev 900 Degrees (V2) 8) Wackadaddies A Walk In The Park (Under The Counter) 9) Onionz Latin Hustler (Siesta) 10) Agent Sumo Sunflowers (Peace Division Dub) (Virgin) IT WAS COMEDOWN this month when I headed back to the Octopus club in Tel Aviv, Israel. The last couple of times I’d been there, it was with Darren Emerson, so it had been absolutely ram-packed. This time the promoters decided to just put me on by myself. Well, it was a nice idea, but it didn’t work too well, to be honest. The music in Israel is quite hard, so when I played, people didn't have the energy they were accustomed to. I guess you could say I play tough while they like it hard. What’s the difference? Well, to me, for hard you just grit your teeth and pump -while tough means you keep the funk, mixing and cutting across it! It’s nights like that you realise being a DJis sometimes juk a job -you’ve just got to get on with it and do your best. But what really made up for it was the Leeds Love Parade, I’veneverseen anything like it. I played three floats - Subliminal’s, Radio 1 ’s and Cream's. Subliminal was bananas, especially when the crowd decided to trash the float. Ben Sherman were sponsoring it and all their signs and posters just went flying. Total anarchy! Talking of unusual experiences, I’m used to having people on percussion banging alongside the DJ, but at Urban , they didn’t just have a percussionist, but also a live bass player doing some slapping over my set, giving it some funk. It worked a treat, which was great, because I’ve played my fair share of gigs where some idiot on a bongo or a drum kitruinsitforthe DJ. Onetimein Manchester, some total New Age Dave The Rave had a set of bongos which he was slapping randomly, so I had to ask him to stop. Not nice, but sometimes you’ve gotto do it. It's important for a percussionist to complement the DJ, and not to try to steal the show.

I also made a video in Germany for my new tune ‘Komodo’. It’s based on the [Aliens with more cleavage] film Species.” Would you call yourself a trance DJ? “No. I play music that could be described as techno, house, hard house and trance. The punters always dance which is the most important thing.” What was your big break in musical terms? “I came second in Italy's DMC Championship in 1 988 and joined Media Records. But really it was more a gradual evolution, rather than getting one single break. My next single, ‘Komodo’, could go Top 10 in Europe - maybe that will be my really big break!\" What music did you like listening to as a child? “As a child I listened to pop music on the radio, then got into disco and hip hop in my mid teens, but since then it's been techno in all its forms that presses my buttons.\" Is your life one long sexadelic party zone? “I’m not a wild and crazy guy. In fact when I ' m with Mark Spoon I really fear for my life! I have a wife who I met working at Media and we had a kid a year ago. That sobers you up a lot.” Do the Italians love Nukleuz as much as the British seem to? “Nukleuz takes the best of international and UK trance, techno, and hard house to suit the UK tastes. Much of it derives from our BXR label, which is Italy’s leading dance label. Most Italians are not really aware of Nukleuz, though, as it is only an import label in Italy.” What ventures have you got coming up, in terms of DJing and a release schedule? “I’m extremely busy over the summer playing Ibiza, the UK and all over Europe. I’ve played May Day and Love Parade in Germany this year, so I 've done the two biggest gigs of the year. In the UK and Ireland I'll be playing Slinky and Gatecrasher among others.\" Have you ever had any experiences with lizards? “Of course, I’ve lived a few months with an iguana, check the picture out in my album.\" Isyour studio a dance music production line, like Motown and Phil Spector used to have? “Well, by using the Pro-tools system we can prepare and mix records very quickly. We have working practices that enable us to create tracks and mixes quickly. Having said this, we try to start with a new groove every time.” Who are your heroes? “Most people don't impress me that much. Everyone has talents.” What are your favourite labels? “Our own label BXR would be my favourite as we are making the music we play out. In a DJ set I’ll play 75% BXR records. I like DAVE The Drummer too, and Nick Sentience is fast becoming the best UKtechno producer.” ‘Nukleuz Presentz Mauro Picotto The Lizard Man’ is out now on Nukleuz/Virgin Mauro Picotto’s Top Five Tracks 1) Mauro Picotto Planet/Bug (BXR) “Two versions are included on the ‘Komodo’ album.” 3) Electric Deluxe Electric Deluxe (Plus 8) “Sensational!

Time is short. And still Muzik manages to spend half the designated pub interview slot discussing the ins and outs of the late, great Roger Hargreaves and his Mr Men rather than Andy’s excellent soundtracking melody-fest of an album, 'Nothing Changes Under The Sun’. He’s that sort of bloke: unostentatious, not given to grandiloquence, and certainly not a club monster. “Gatecrasher?” he enquires, \"what’s Gatecrasher? Gatecrashing ’s something I did when I was 17. That clubbing thing is nothing to do with me.” Which isn’t quite true, as he DJs at London’s Sunday Best and is about to take a live show on the road. There are also remixes in the pipeline for Badly Drawn Boy, Minotaur Shock and Fort Lauderdale. But in truth he's far happier in the sphere of film scores. \"My favourite is a Vangelis score to a film I've never seen,\" Andy announces. “It’s called Animal Apocalypse. Then there’s Roy Budd’s Black Windmill, John Barry obviously, Bullitt. . . I've got more of an affinity with all them than Gatecrasher!\" And you can hear it in his lush, bedroom- created music, appearing quietly over the last two years on the low-key Memphis Industries label. Then all too quickly, he rushes off to the game; Mr Busy leaving Mr Silly the journo and Mr Topsy-Turvy the photographer behind. Next thing you know he'll be playing regular golf with Jerry Bruckheimer and working as incidental music supervisor for Bernardo Bertolucci.

Robbie Rivera’s new track starts with the kind of jack-hammer piano line that gets your hips shaking without you realising. The Rhythm Bangers bellow over the top, before Rivera s trademark filter loops turn the whole thing into a salsa-shagging anthem. Swaggering around the dancefloor with the same libidinous Latin strut as Basement Jaxx and DJ Sneak’s more carnival-esque moments, it's a track that, predictably, has snuck up on the Ibizan dancefloors of Pacha and Space and taken them roughly from behind. “I recorded the music for it about eight or nine months ago,\" explains the 23 year old post-grad from his Miami studio. “I was playing it everywhere I went, and it was just getting this great reaction.” Little wonder. Robbie was already something of DJ celeb in his native Puerto Rico before he decamped to Miami University at the age of 18. From starting off DJing at “house parties, weddings, all that kind of shit,\" by the time he left school he'd become a budding Pete Tong, hosting a mix show from 8pm-2am every Friday and Saturday evening on the local radio. “The party scene in Puerto is really cool,” he enthuses. “I went to Ibiza two weeks ago, and when I landed there it felt totally like Puerto Rico. The old town there is exactly the same as Ibiza Town - except the clubs are 20 times better in Ibiza!\" As well as being a purveyor of fine quality house records, Robbie's no slouch behind the decks - something his forthcoming compilation ‘The Real Miami 1 ably demonstrates. “It’s gonna be a bit weird when that CD comes over here, because the real sound of Miami at the moment is trance,\" he confesses. “I feel that there’s so much trance being played in the dubs that people are forgetting about house.\" Of course, most Brits in the dance fraternity’s main experience of Miami is from the infamous Winter Music Conference, an annual event which has led many to tentatively suggest that Miami might be the next Ibiza. . . “I think so too!” he exclaims excitedly. “The last conference was such a lot of fun!\" Clearly a hard-working young lad, Robbie's already finished the follow-up to ‘Bang’. “The minute you hear it, you’ll know it’s me,\" he assures us.

Muzik caught up with the rising star of deep tech-house taking a well- deserved break from the mayhem of his Deep South Friday-nighter (at Home in Leicester Square) on Salinas nudist beach in Ibiza. Which was nice. Relaxing in the late afternoon sun, the hazy DJ is definitely in need of some light R 'n’ R. His summer touring schedule sounds punishing enough to crack a commando. “There's a lot to do. Take this week, for example. I came over to play Perceptions Of Pacha. I’m flying back to London for Deep South tomorrow, there's Scotland on Saturday plus Space on Sunday. Then it’s back to Manchester for a gig at Planet, Friday is Home in London and Saturday I’m off to Middlesborough. My girlfriend’s not going to be happy!” Renowned for his deep, extended sessions in Space, Steve is now as much a part of the terrace as Sasha or Morillo. And as the anti-trance wave sweeps Ibiza, his popularity looks set to escalate. Along with his playing time. '1 can play for seven or eight hours quite easily,\" says Steve. “But I’m not quite ready for a mammoth Tenaglia-style 1 2-hour set just yet.\" But is he happy with that nu-breed title? “It's yet another tag, but it does make sense, because we’re bringing something fresh to the table,\" he says. “But I’ve been DJing for 10 years, so I’m not exactly new!\" Like Lee Burn'dge and Craig Richards, Steve specialises in deeper than deep house and dark tech-electro. Again, Tenaglia looms large. “'Be Yourself' by Celeda was massive on the terrace last summer,” says Steve. “And that's a sound I’m still into now. Having said that, I don't think it matters what music’s being played. When you come to Ibiza, any and all music sounds good.\" Steve says he’s had a bizarre experience everywhere at some point or other. A couple of years back, he spotted a guy doing front crawl on the y top podium in Space. Oblivious to his surroundings, | he was totaiiy naked except for some swimming | goggles. \"I couldn’t decide whether he’d done a load I of gear or was so Balearic he didn’t even realise!\" I chuckles Steve.

A long term interest in Che Guevara had led the band to record an EP about him which got heavy rotation on Havana radio, and in return they were invited over to play. They spent over two months on the island, writing and recording, and taking in the local musical culture, from Latin Beatles cover bands to hip hop groups knocking out beats on congas and timbales. The resulting album ‘Rebel Radio’, named after the pirate station used to broadcast the message of the revolution, was partly recorded in the famous Sonocaribe studio with its dusty Fifties valve amps and a host of notable Cuban musicians. Meanwhile arranger/producer Ein was working hard on the beats back in Bristol. The finished album blends modem breakbeats and samples with more traditional Cuban rhythms. “I think the album shows a contrast between the two cities, a link between the old and new world,” Ein explains. “We haven’t got a Bristol sound particularly but we like to bring in musicians from the surrounding area and mix them with influences from other countries (previous Up, Bustle & Out releases have melded music from as far afield as Spain, India and Bolivia). It can be a bit hit or miss but sometimes you come up with something really wild.\" Having sat on the tapes for the best part of two years - in which they recorded ‘Master Sessions 2’, set up their own publishing house and witnessed the rise of the Buena Vista Social Club phenomenon - the band are itching to move on with their next project. ‘Scenes From The Urban Wasteland’, which will document the lost cultures of eastern Europe. Ein promises it will be “more disjointed and disturbing . . . just really strange stuff.\" (NG) Up, Bustle Out’s ‘Rebel Radio: Master Sessions 1* is out now on Ninja Tune.

S .Tra ive THE MOST FAMOUSLY ‘FREE’ PERSON SINCE JOHN INMAN THE RAIN IS POURING DOWN, the skies are grey and the wind is cold. Welcome to the British summertime, as the Radio 1 Love Parade winds its weary way around the greenery of Leeds’ Roundhay Park. Stationed on Danny Rampling's float, the glammed-up Ultra Nate belts her way through her shiny club anthem ‘Desire’ regardless, and for a brief moment, the sun seems to be shining once again. First gaining recognition with her class of '89 anthem, 'It's Over Nov/', Ultra Nate’s career really took off with the unfeasibly massive ‘Free’, followed by the equally successful ‘Situation: Critical’ longplayer in 1998. Now she’s back with ‘Stranger Than Fiction', a more upbeat collection than its predecessor, and probably her most accomplished work to date. Lead cut ‘Desire’ has taken up residency at the top of the club charts. “It was great not having to run around the world supporting a single,” she i explains, still damp from the traditional ^ Leeds piss-down, i had time sit down z and write what I wanted to write, and I got $ to work with loads of great people.\" | Ultra’s sparkly, dare-we-say-it, sassy a stage presence is in demand everywhere from house clubs to two-step clubs, from MTV to CD: UK, effortlessly working the cred plus cash thing. “I think it’s because, unlike a lot of dance music that’s out there, people have an actual personality to connect with,” she offers. “Once you make the song more alive to people, there’s a person, an image and a sound that they’re buying into, and that’s a lot more memorable.\" But it’s not all recording sessions and promotional interviews - her schedule takes her far and wide, including her occasional cherished forays to Ibiza. “After seeing England and all this greyness, I can see why everyone’s heading for Ibiza!\" she chortles. “I love Ibiza. There's this mad nightlife going on, but if you want to get away from that, you can balance it out with the beautiful beaches. The whole island atmosphere gives you a sense of carefree, unbridled freedom. Although admittedly, that can be quite scary with some people!\" The veteran diva is no Ultra-lightweight, though. “I’ve been out and about in the club scene for so many years that I’m not really shocked by anything,\" she chuckles. On today’s evidence she’s got plenty of years left in her yet.

MARVIN GAYE What's Going On? (Motown) 1 think this might be one of the most beautiful songs ever. He wrote it for his brother who was going off to war, where so many young black men had died. The album’s wicked but this is the tune. 6. EARTH, WIND & FIRE Can't Hide Love (Epic) I’ve been through about six copies because every time 1 get it 1 seem to lose itl The whole way they do things is wicked. 7. NIGHTWR ITERS 12. PRINCE Ballad Of Dorothy Parker (Warners) This was on an import triple ! album with ‘Sign O' The Times’. It cost £20 which was quite a lot at the time. He talks about taking a girt home and having a bath with her - some typically freaky Prince shit. 16. MADONNA Holiday (Warners) 1 went on my first real holiday from school round the time this was out. When we got there 1 realised 1 had my Walkman but no music so a mate of mine gave me a tape. This was on it and over the holiday 1 fell in love with it. 20. DOROTHY MOORE M sty Blue My mum loved this and I’ve gained a lot of appreciation and love of music from her so she can have the last one on the tape. Let The Music Use You (Island) This was maybe where British garage started to come into its own. It was from the club scene, but you could listen to it at home - even my mum liked it! Very soulful music. S3 £ COU*CTW« 'f \\ /Marlnruui.L jD n A il cv 2. MICHAEL JACKSON Rock With You (Epic) This is my favourite track from ‘Off The Wall’. The groove manages to fuse a ballad with a bit of dance. Back in those days he could do no wrong. 8. THE GAP BAND Outstanding (RCA) This takes me back to the age of 1 3- 1 4, listening to Greg Edwards on Capital Radio. Not a lot lean say about it other than it’s one of the greatest soul tunes ever produced. 13. 808 STATE Pacific State (Warners) This came at a time when a lot of the music around appeared not to have a lot of groove or soul. This one, though, did things for me - this and Moby’s ‘Go’ are my favourites from that period. ' ....... 17. CHANGE WSarrn From their 'Change Of Heart’ album, probably their most famous. At the time 1 was 15 and playing house parties and this was the one 1 always dropped - something a little bit less obvious. - Bom: Hackney, London Age: 30 First record you bought: Rose Royce’s ‘Magic Touch’. If you could only have one record what would it be? ‘What’s Going On?’ by Marvin Gaye because even if I was listening to it on my own I’d feel like I had company. Future plans: To put an artist LP out by the end of the year. Most of our dreams have been achieved, so now we want to help bring new people through.” The ‘INCredible Sound Of The Dreem Teem’ mix CD is out now on INCredible 3. GENE DUNLAP & THE RIDGEWAYS Before You Break My Heart (Capitol) This track was from a compilation called 'Capitol Classics’. It’s Soulful and really mellow. 9. MELISSA MORGAN Fod's Paradise Once again, early days of clubbing forme, a nice singalong with my mates. The music then was much less specialist out in the clubs. 18. LUTHER VAN DROSS The Night 1 Fell In Love (Epic) 1 ’ m a bit of a mellow soul boy really and he’s one of the greatest soul crooners of all time. 1 don't mind going right down, right down. . . 4. MASTERS AT WORK 1 Can t Get No Sleep (AM :PM) This is the UK/US garage record that 1 really fell in love with. Takes me back to DJing around the time 1 began to make my name. 10. LL COOL J Rock Da Be ls (Def Jam) When 1 first started DJing I’d always look forward to playing ‘Rock Da Bells’ so 1 could show off a little scratching - it always brought the most adulation. 14. SUGAR MINOTT A House Is Not A Home (Greensleeves) The reggae influence in my house was heavy and Sugar Minott was the one 1 always used to nick out of my mum’s collection. 19. MADNESS Baggy Trousers (Chrysa'is) Madness were a band that appealed to the streets and were brought up not far from where 1 grew up. Even now at weddings and parties, me and my mates, if this comes on we'll stop and find each other. Competition There’s only one copy of Spoony’s tape and it could be yours. Just answer the following easy question. Which of the following is not a kind of team? 5. NOTORIOUS B.I.G. Miss.ng You (Arista) 1 think he’s probably my favourite rapper of all time. What he’s done here is a ballad with rapping. The way he delivers the vocal is so heartfelt. 11. BRANDY Angel (Atlantic) 1 think this is the most current record on my tape. She’s got an absolutely beautiful voice. There was a bootleg which has to be my favourite - 1 doubt it’ll be surpassed. 15. SUGAR HILL GANG Rapper’s Delight (Sugar Hill) One of the top five rap records of all time. Their lyrical skills are phenomenal. Anyone over the age of 22 will know this record - it’s an all-rounder. a) A Football Team b) A Paintball Team c) A Painting Of A Man Wearing A Raincoat Answers on a jerky r£?b bassline to Dreem Topping Comp, Muzik Magazine, IPC, Stamford Street.

Bars are overflowing, a German coach party has arrived, and the security are tensing up at the growing numbers. Some, in leather coats, handlebar moustaches and black cowboy hats, look pretty mean, but to their credit, they keep the party flowing without any unnecessary intervention. Frankly, by sunrise at seven, Muzik, Phil and Jon are gobsmacked. Between us, we’ve seen the odd knees-up over the years, but the Showdown at Sioux City 2000 is something truly spectacular. Surreal, stupendous, sweat-soaked and, er, very, very silly are just some of the adjectives tumbling from our lips as the sun rises over the Muzik banner straddling the stagecoach stop. “We've gotta make this a regular event!\" grins La Rocka as he escorts three stunning senoritas to a private party in his hotel room. Yes we do. And when we do, readers, make sure you book the trip. . . (DF) RIGHT. WHERE DO WE START? We’re on an island off the coast of Africa in Sioux City, a private Wild West enclave run by an Austrian cowboy nicknamed, er, Buffalo Bill. We’re surrounded by wigwams, live bulls, a fully-functioning saloon with dancers, a brothel and 3,500 muntered Spaniards and whoop-it-up holidaymakers. Dust is thick on the ground, coke smoke is hanging in the air and Brazilian transvestites are strip-teasing to loin-clothed percussionists behind the stagecoach repair shop. A-whicky-whicky-wa-ah-wild-wild-west, as Will Smith would so rightly say. We’re here for Muzik ’s first ever Canaries knees- up, and to check out the cow-poking talents of Jon Pleased Wmmin, Phil Perry and Tito LaRocka. Tito’s the pin-up La Palma DJ /promoter who suggested the event in the first place. He's got the most rocking selection of ex-girlfriends this side of Warren Beatty and pupils the size of dinner plates, and right now, he’s dropping a sexy warm-up set of deep house. The music bounces round the canyon, through the hot night air and comes to rest in between the breasts of a Spanish cowgiri. That’s what said cowgiri tells us, anyway. Over in the Saloon, the most hideous selection of bacalao (a sort of gabba-meets-Vengaboys racket) is rocking a sweaty, no-nonsense crowd. The music is accompanied by Wild West showgirls on stage so trollied they can hardly kick up their skirts. It’s fun: but for them only, perhaps. Safe back in British hands, so to speak, Jon of the Pleased builds from disco-groovy to banging, dirty house above the town bank. It’s a pistol-packing set which succeeds in winning over Spaniards used to more predictable fodder, and paves the way perfectly for a Phil Perry shoot-out that must rate as one of the sets of the year. Even if the sound system is sabotaged by the odd power failure. Well, we are in a canyon miles from anywhere. . .

His flippancy is even more remarkable considering the reason Muzik has been summoned to Beer’s home town in the first place. We’re here, y'see, to talk about the impending visit of Masters At Work to Leeds. There’s little doubt that this is one of the clubbing coups of the year. The Masters rarely venture over the Atlantic individually, never mind as a duo. The party they'll play at marks the seventh birthday of one of Britain’s most loved house clubs - Hard Times. More significantly though, the party symbolises the coming together of three of the North's most recognised and revered promoters: Basics' Dave Beer, Stereo’s Dave Elliot and Antony Geogallis and Hard Times’ Steve Rain. It’s the first time Rain has been involved in organising anything in the city for a while now. Three years ago he decided to hand over the reins to others, preferring instead to concentrate on breeding sheep. But once the invitation from the two Daves and the lure of another party with Masters At Work (the headlining guests at Hard Times' first birthday) was on the table, the temptation was too great. All three promoters could theoretically have booked the duo on their own. It’s testimony, however, to Leeds' re-emergence as a major clubbing force that such an alliance could be formed. With rivalry between dance clubs evident in even the smallest and most secluded of British cities, it says a lot about the trust and mutual respect that these Northern musketeers share. “The significance of the event isn't just about MAW, it's about the union of our three clubs,” Rain emphasises. The secret is that they all share a common love and a common goal. The love is house music, and the goal? To put on the best party possible. “I reckon if all our clubs, individually, are as good as they are,” spouts Beer in typically assertive fashion, “just think how great this is going to be now we’ve all come together.” (SM) Stereo, Hard Times G* Back To Basics presents Masters At Work in association with Muzik on Sunday August 27th at The Majestik, Leeds.

A few feet away another guy, pneumatically pumped in his pseudo-trash-punk gear, has a couple of ravishing uber-babes draped around him. They take turns kissing him hard on the lips as they slither about to Joey Negro's mix of Akabu. As preparation for the evening, we fight our way to the bar and stock up on some Vodka Red Bulls. We’re in Cologne, sailing down the Rhine, and we’re here to see Hardfloor play live. Right now though we’re admiring the view from the top deck, listening to a local lad play some fat, chunky house. The dancefloor, the whole boat in fact, is rammed with a cool mix of full-on gays and impossibly beautiful girls. A light rain is falling from the sky as a huge rainbow appears on the other side of the water. “Crikey!” I think to myself as we move downstairs to the main dancefloor where Laurent Gamier is playing, “this is alright.” Laurent looks like he’s having a good time too, busily cutting the vocal from his own ‘Wake Up’ over Josh Wink's mix of ‘French Kiss’ while the crowd goes into orbit. We listen to him for an hour or so before having a few words with the Hardfloor boys. “We don’t really like talking about our music, we just do what we feel at the time,” says Oliver (the tall one) as Ramon nods his head in solemn agreement. Erm, okay, that's the end of that, then. At around 4am, Hardfloor finally take to the stage, warming up with a couple of tracks from their new album 'So What?!’. Huge breaks collide with their trademark acid riffs before they launch in to a thunderous version of the mighty ’Acperience’. They follow that with their mix of ’Yeke Yeke’ and then go into stomping techno mode. Suddenly, or so it seems, the lights go up, the sound fades and the crowd cheer. It goes off one more time and then bang, it’s over. Yep, good fucking party.

If you get tired of admiring the fabulously dressed clientele, there’s always the breathtaking view of Ibiza Town to cast your eyes upon. Overlooking the port, the club has one of the best views on the island. And with Moneypenny’s radiant following it's easy to see why they chose this venue. Resident Danny Rampling holds court here and teases us all into submission with his impeccable choice of tunes and bespoke mixing. And it’s not just Rampling that draws the crowd. Guests include the legendary DJ Sneak. Harry 'Choo Choo’ Romero and Claudio di Rocco. And when the funky and sexy house policy is married to a funky and sexy set of punters, we know exactly why we’re here. Lee Garrick, the face of Moneypenny's, feels the same. He believes that the night has gone from strength to strength over the last four years. \"We bring a touch of the UK club to Ibiza but add a cosmopolitan feel,\" he enthuses. By importing their own dancers and decor and resisting the urge to go over the top, Moneypenny’s has got it right. If you like the glamour and sexiness that goes with a Chuff Chuff night but want it on a more regular basis, Moneypenny’s is where it’s at.

The reception is similar for Armand Van Helden, who slams on the pomp-metal/ house hybrid of ‘Little Black Spiders’ to mass MTV indignation. A quick mix into ‘Koochy’ soon sorts them out. The Rock evidently demands obvious disco thrills over ambitious, out-there atmospherics. Big tunes are the order of the day, which is why ‘Meet Her At The Love Parade’ sent Seb's crowd into such a frenzy - this is house music made for international bright young things. Back on the second stage, Paul Van Dyk drops 'Sandstorm' by Darude. There’s a roar so loud you’d have thought the Berlin Wall had toppled again. Tumbling offstage after a spine-tingling 'Rez', Karl Hyde is considering the impact of Ibiza on their world-renowned stage show. “We’ve played some bizarre places in our time,” says Karl, who’s sweating almost as much as Seb. “Roman amphitheatres, on tops of hills, even a casino in Las Vegas. But we’ve never played in a quarry before. And I have to say, our first quarry was delightful.” Indeed: tonight, disco in a huge chalk-pit feels like the new rock and roll. (RM) SEB FONTAINE has a hangover from hell. “I’ve never felt so supremely ropey in my life,” shudders Seb, desperately trying to hold it together. “I’ve had cold sweats, hot flushes, hot sweats, cold flushes, the works. Maybe that’s because I’m in a superior mood - I am 30 today, after all. Erick Morillo and I partied until five last night - and now he looks as bad as I dol\" Well, not quite. Right now the little man with the big brows and bigger tunes is busy mixing 'Knights Of The Jaguar’ into ‘French Kiss’, which is no mean feat when 10,000 punters are watching you suffer from sleep deprivation. Seb's already sent the crowd at this MTV-sponsored bonanza into orbit with a mix of tech-house and trance-tinged tunes. Now it’s Erick’s turn. Undeterred by an entire night on the tiles, Morillo's box of tricks ensures The Rock, erm, rocks. And Seb? He’s still busy sweating in the comer. “There were only 1 00 people on site when I got here,” he shivers. “Now look at the place!\" Over on the main stage, Underworld are busy discovering if they can still rinse out and wash whiter without Daz.

It’s often the way on a Monday morning, with the big man sitting on his big sofa, viewing his big black V8 Jaguar through the window and waiting for the buzz to recede. The chemical that's been pumping through his veins? High-octane adrenaline. Enough of the stuff to see him through a weekend which took in DJing in front of one-and-a-half million frothing Germans at Berlin’s Love Parade, followed by an ‘intimate’ show in front of more than 1 0,000 at T In The Park. \"It’s been a weekend of people as far as the eye can see,\" he notes triumphantly from behind bookish spectacles. “It’s kind of ironic: 12 years ago everyone was wondering how long this scene would last for. Well here we are in the year 2000, and the kick drum prevails.\" Cox’s rustically appointed living room - complete with brick fireplace and flowery trimmings - couldn't be further removed from the whistle-blowing, pill- popping, half-clothed mayhem of Berlin if it were situated on Alpha Centauri. As well as coming down, he heads back here to peruse the bigger picture. To cogitate on a career he believes has rolled out peculiarly, combining both glory and wealth, but also, as he sees it, misunderstanding and a paucity of acclaim. This comes from a man who's recognised the world over. How can it be? “I still see myself as an unsung hero,\" Cox says. “You look at Paul Oakenfold and he is known as the pinnacle DJ who’s in the Guinness Book Of Records, who’s done all the big tours and gets attention for whatever he does. If anyone’s going to be perceived as breaking America this year it’ll be Paul. But I was there three or four years before he was and able to pull just as many people and cause easily as much hype and interest.” Carl Cox sweeps a hand across the room, pointing out the numerous awards he’s won, including his Muzik/Ericsson smileys for Best DJ and Best Essential Mix, which now take pride of place on his mantlepiece. “Of course it hasn't all been bad, and I can’t afford to be bitter, but I do feel there could be more emphasis on what I’ve achieved.\" He's gone down a storm everywhere from The Big Breakfast, Never Mind The Buzzcocks and Human Traffic to Space, Cream and The End. Surely more than enough ammo to put him on an equal footing with Oakey? “In a sense, yes. I could sit here all day going, ‘Of course I’m bigger than Oakenfold'. And the truth is, if you look at the work I’ve done, how long I've been doing this for, and were to ask people who they’re most into, it’d be me. But in the eyes of the media it’s Paul.\" Mid-train of thought, Cox changes tack. To better illustrate his point, he recounts a bizarre incident from a few weeks ago, which left him uncertain whether to grin or weep. “This kid came up to me and said, 'You’re still the best Number Two DJ in the world’. Hee, hee, boof!\" Cox exclaims, as he mimics punching the kid through the nearest wall. “You have to laugh.\" Too many of us, it seems, aren’t getting with Cox’s schtick. As he puts it, he’s not the DJ who hangs around to “wallow in success\". He’s the one who lays down foundations - in rave, breakbeat, trance, hard house and techno - which others then build upon. In other words, he feels that he does the hard work, then leaves others to pick up the plaudits. “The records I’m playing now are the records that other DJs will be playing in two years' time,\" he insists. “By then, I will have moved on to something new. It's what I’m about as a DJ: I push the elements forward.” And people don’t understand this? “It’s easy to understand Oakenfold, Sasha and Judge Jules, because they make it easy for people to understand them. But still nobody understands me. I don't conform.” If passion for music counts for anything it's hard to believe Carl Cox is anything but the Number One DJ in the world. As much as he epitomises the modern day superstar spinner, the many years he spent plugging away before the acid house explosion demonstrate he’s also a link with times when playing records didn’t have you needing an offshore bank account. “I used to earn 12 quid for playing in Kingston wine bars,\" he recalls. “But that made me hungry, because if I played well, I figured I could ask for 20 quid the next week.\" Ask him to name a DJ who should have broken into the top ranks in these last few years and he opts for Adam Freeland. Once, the nu-skooler was firmly planted under Coxy’s wing, but it appears they don’t see eye to eye any more. “Adam Freeland should have become a star. He had that chance but he choose to run before he could walk,\" Cox says. “He turned into a purist when his music should have been about having fun. The industry was like, ‘Sorxy mate, you’ve got further to go than you think’.” The hunger that Cox gained playing in wine bars lives on, both in the form of the famously addictive enthusiasm he gives off when DJing and his still seemingly effortless prowess for bringing underground sounds to a wider audience. Great performances by Carl Cox become permanently wedged in the brain, that's as true now as ever. This summer, on the opening night of Home at Space, Cox took to the decks indoors for the first time and truly let rip. Incredibly, he pulled this off with only a small bag of records, as the rest of his vinyl had gone astray at the airport. “I want people to feel lucky if they're on the island at the same time as I’m playing - like, I could be anywhere in the world but it just so happens I’m here at the same time as them,\" says Cox of his relatively limited sorties to Ibiza. “I want people to be able to say: ‘I had a great holiday. I got pissed, I got a shag, I lost all me mates, I witnessed a great sunset and I saw Carl Cox DJing’. That's the contribution I want to make to people’s holidays.” Intent on avoiding Ibiza burn-out, Carl Cox has bought himself a villa on nearby Mallorca rather than at the centre of the mayhem. Back in London, meanwhile, he has a home-from-home in Ultimate Base, his friendly, thumping techno institution, which is nearing its fifth birthday. Upon reaching that date, however, Carl reckons it will be time for a change, with Ultimate Base coming to an end and him looking for a choice resident slot elsewhere. “The only place that seems right for me is Nottingham's Renaissance,\" he reveals. “Brilliant club, brilliant people. I’ve said to [Renaissance promoter] Geoff Oakes, I’d like to look at a resident situation with them next year.\" There'll be another New Year’s Eve for Cox to deal with before then. It’s hard to imagine it will match his assault on the new millennium, which saw him playing in Australia, then flying for eight hours and crossing time zones to play in Hawaii. “Hawaii really was new territory,\" he smiles. “Half of the crowd had heard of me - the other half looked at my name and thought I was some sort of strap-on dildo!\" It’s been tough work for Carl Cox to keep his eye on the ball in the five years since he last graced Muzik’s cover. In 1 998, after three years of marriage and many more before that as fVZK 51 boyf riend/f riend , he divorced his wife, Rachel. As well as the heartache, his financial security was thrown up in the air by the divorce settlement. Not surprisingly, this is a sensitive subject, but it's not one that Cox - who’s now happy in a relationship with new girlfriend Helen - shies away from discussing. “I was trying to deal with all this emotional stress as well as being the Number One DJ in Germany, Holland and Britain. That’s hard work,” he notes. “When I got married, it was supposed to be for life but then it broke down, and it wasn’t because I was out late at night or shagging other women. It’s just that my path and her path turned out to be two very different things. I remember sitting in this very room, attempting to plan our future. But it became clear that my future was already mapped out and this was hard for her to understand.” “There was conflict,\" he continues solemnly. “We reached a point where we couldn't handle it any more. I didn’t want to come in after having had a really good night only to have an argument about the reasons why I’d had a good night.\" In the midst of this trauma, Cox put his faith in the life force he trusts the most: the music. “I've learnt how strongly I feel about my music. Without it, I would have turned to drink and drugs, or I would be in a mental institution. I would have become a nasty, angry person.” Compounding the pressure of splitting from his wife, Cox endured various health problems. In fact, two years ago, it seemed his huge frame was falling apart. He acquired a kidney stone, a stomach infection which had him hospitalised in New York for five days and, of all things, gout, an ailment normally perceived as the preserve of elderly aristocrats. “It was like, ding-ding! Warning! No more brandy, champagne or red meat for you,” he laughs. “And I had to learn that I couldn’t do the impossible any more. I could no longer play one hour in Canada, fly straight to Yugoslavia to DJ for an hour and then fly home to paint my basement.” Right now, Carl Cox looks the picture of health. Younger than his 37 years, in fact, and showing few signs of two decades lost in clubs. He puts this down to having discovered water (“No one ever told me before that I was supposed to drink it!\") and to returning to Horsham as often as possible, “instead of going down the Met Bar to meet a load of pretentious mates.\" Cox views the celebrity scene with considerable ambivalence. He’s mates with Sid Owen. He’s met everyone from Kate Moss to Emma Bunton, but only really seems on home ground when talking about star spotting from the other side of his Technics. He beams that familiar beam when recounting the time he stopped off, mid-holiday, to DJ in Los Angeles and found digital editable recordable SONY Will your favourite ever track be your favourite track forever?

The album features the singles '900 Degrees' and 'Coragao Tambor' Available on double pack vinyl and cd. I himself playing to a fully-fledged Hollywood giant. “This guy in a fisherman’s hat and glasses was dancing for two hours on the podium. He came up to me at the end and said, ‘Carl, that was wicked music, man’. It was Wesley Snipes! And he’s an r&b fan!\" The general public are prone to even more dramatic reactions when they catch sight of Cox. “There was this bloke riding along on a scooter. He saw me walking along and kept looking at me. Then crashed into a privet hedge!\" It's little wonder that such a passionate man should hold such fascination. Want to know how much Carl Cox loves his DJing? Enough to have scuppered his production work these last few years. Following the mixed response to his last two albums, the deck work has inevitably seemed more inviting. Particularly when you're getting offers like playing to 45,000 in the Ajax Stadium. Later this year, however, he plans to get started on a new album with several as yet unconfirmed co- producers. The intention is to make “stomping, hardcore Carl Cox-style dance tracks\". Does he think he'll ever make music which matches his stature as a DJ? “I don’t know if that can be achieved. There’s not many people in the world who don't know who Carl Cox the DJ is. It would be difficult for people to accept me as a producer that easily.\" Presently, Carl has a new mix CD, recorded live at Chicago’s Crobar club, out on the American Moonshine label. Featuring cuts from Timo Maas, Aphrohead, Humate and Steve Rachmad it is, rest assured, up to Cox's usual, self-set standards. Furthermore, he’s the director of a new dance- oriented internet project called eJay.com. Oh yeah, and if you were under the impression that Cox’s film career began and ended with Human Traffic, think again. He'll be back in your local “I was DJing when Oakey was this high” multiplex in Elixir, an American clubbing movie which goes into production this autumn with Cameron Diaz confirmed in one of the lead roles. Cox plays a DJ, but says there's more to the part than merely him grinning and spinning. “When you see a window of opportunity, you go for it,\" he remarks. “It's the same as with TV. An old granny might have heard my name from her grandchildren and if I go on the box doing something really normal, like giving everyone my breakfast tips, she can put a face to the name and see that even though I’m from this situation of unacceptability, from DJ-drug-culture, blah-blah-blah, I’m an okay bloke.\" It’s testament to the sheer power and distinction of his DJing that, as many TV or celluloid appearances he may make, they will never eclipse his first love. So despite him nearing 40, this is more mid-term report than final despatch. And as far as he’s come, he's got miles further to go. “It’s never been about the easy route. I'm the sort of person who gets from Horsham to London via Japan,\" he grins. “But I’m one of the pioneers, no one can argue with that. I'm the DJ who says ‘Forget that, that was 10 months ago, check this if you want to experience what’s coming next'.\" Carl's mix album ‘Carl Cox Non Stop’ will be out at the end of September on London Eminem - misunderstood genius or anti-social creep? “Misunderstood genius. Totally. He’s someone I empathise with. He says what he's feeling and you’ve gotta give him his dues for having the balls to stand up for what he believes in.\" Phillip Neville - does he deserve stick all season? “I think he’s got off quite lightly so far. When Beckham makes an indiscretion he gets much more crap and he's one of the best players in the world. I don't think Neville should be killed or have his house burnt down [That’s nice of you - Ed.], but I do think he deserves some shit.’’ Fox-hunting - should it be banned? \"Yes. I can’t see the pleasure of sending out a pack of beagles, or whatever they are, to kill one of God's creatures. These are posh people who are well educated. They should know better.\" What’s your favourite clothes brand? \"I used to like a lot of Paul Smith clothes, until they didn’t fit me any more, that is.\" What’s the most hurtful thing that anyone’s ever said to you? “I've been called a fat wanker. That my music’s shit and that they hope my car breaks down. I don’t let it get to me, though. The majority of the time it’s because people are jealous. They’re the ones who are hurting inside.\" Cox speaks out: “Don’t kill Phil Neville!” What’s the best thing about being Carl Cox? “That I can have a laugh, I suppose - a laugh about anything and with anyone. I think I understand a lot about life now. Even a really good portion of chips makes me happy.\" MZK 55 lit mm k THE SOUND STARTED BY TONY DE VIT AT TRADE HAS NOW HIT THE MAINSTREAM MARKET WITH A VENGEANCE.
