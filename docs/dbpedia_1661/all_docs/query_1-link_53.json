        "text": "With the 27th March set for the release of “Satan Ov Suns” on Immortal Frost Productions, Black Metallers DOEDSVANGR have today posted a video for a track from the album. Created by Moornebheym, the video, for the track “Black Dawn”, can be seen below and on YouTube at https://youtu.be/zItJ2GLLPGM\n\nx\n\nWhilst DOEDSVNGR is a relatively new band, there is no denying the fact that the Norwegian/Finnish lineup comprising Shatraug (HORNA, SARGEIST, BEHEXEN and NIGHTBRINGER), Anti-Christian (TSJUDER, BEATEN TO DEATH) and founder and frontman Doedsadmiral (NORDJEVEL, SVARTELDER, ENEPSIGOS) contains some of the most experienced and respected musicians on the Black Metal scene.\n\nParlaying this experience into their debut album, the trio have created eleven tracks that reek of the traditional darkness and menace one would expect from Black Metal, but which steer well clear anything even remotely formulaic. Recorded at Velvet Recording in Spydeberg with Christer Krohg, and with drums recorded at the Klang Studios in Oslo with Bjarne Stensli, “Satan Ov Suns” is an uncompromising work that offers extreme variations, and, according to the band, “a lot of groove”.\n\nWith artwork by Khaos Diktator Design, tracklisting for “Satan Ov Suns” is as follows:\n\nOur Lord Cometh!\n\nRituals\n\nDoedsvangr\n\nBlack Dawn\n\nNorthern Watchtowers\n\nDiaboli\n\nGnashing Of Teeth\n\nBreath Of Lucifer\n\nThrone Of Black Illumination\n\nBlood Whores\n\nBlack Sun Nimbus\n\nIn a recent comment DOEDSVANGR the band’s prolific frontman “Doedsadmiral” had this to say about the formation of the band, and its direction: “All my other bands each have a different sound and musical ethos one from the other, and DOEDSVANGR is one that comes from a much darker direction. DOEDSVANGR, like the other projects in which I’m involved, does not come from me alone, but is the result of two great musicians coming onboard so that together we can create music the way we all want it to sound, and perform it in a way that we all want to hear it. Will DOEDSVSANGR perform live one day? That remains to be seen, let’s just see where the album takes us first”.\n\n“Satan Ov Suns” will be available in CD, Gatefold Double Vinyl and Digital formats and is available to pre-order in CD and Vinyl formats from HERE and in Digital format from HERE .\n\nThe previously debuted track “Rituals” can be heard below and at http://digital.immortalfrostproductions.com/album/satan-ov-suns\n\nx\n\nMore information about DOEDSVANGR can be found on the band’s Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/doedsvangrofficial\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/doedsvangrofficial\n\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/doedsvangrofficial\n\nBand Contact: Doedsvangrofficial@gmail.com\n\nManagement & PR: patriciathomas@btinternet.com\n\nImmortal Frost Productions: http://immortalfrostproductions.com\n\nContact: surtur@immortalfrostproductions.com\n\nWith a lineup comprising Shatraug (HORNA, SARGEIST, BEHEXEN and NIGHTBRINGER), Anti-Christian (TSJUDER, BEATEN TO DEATH) and founder and frontman Doedsadmiral (NORDJEVEL, SVARTELDER, ENEPSIGOS), it was inevitable that there would be interest in DOEDSVANR’s debut full-length album, “Satan Ov Suns”, and today the band have revealed details.\n\nSatan Ov Suns” was recorded at Velvet Recording in Spydeberg with Christer Krohg, whilst drums were recorded at the Klang Studios in Oslo with Bjarne Stensli. Artwork is by Khaos Diktator Design.\n\nTracklisting for “Satan Ov Suns” is as follows:\n\nOur Lord Cometh!\n\nRituals\n\nDoedsvangr\n\nBlack Dawn\n\nNorthern Watchtowers\n\nDiaboli\n\nGnashing Of Teeth\n\nBreath Of Lucifer\n\nThrone Of Black Illumination\n\nBlood Whores\n\nBlack Sun Nimbus\n\nDespite the evil feel that pervades the whole album, DOEDSVANGR’s vastly experienced Norwegian and Finnish members have not fallen into the trap of producing a formulaic Black Metal album, but have been able to create eleven tracks that offer extreme variations, and, it has to be said, “a lot of groove”.\n\n“Satan Ov Suns” will hit the streets on the 27th March on Immortal Frost Productions. “Rituals”, a track from the album, which will be available in CD, Double Vinyl and Digital formats, can be heard below and at HERE\n\nx\n\nCommenting on the formation of DOEDSVANGR the band’s prolific frontman “Doedsadmiral” recently had this to say: “All my other bands each have a different sound and musical ethos one from the other, and DOEDSVANGR is one that comes from a much darker direction. DOEDSVANGR, like the other projects in which I’m involved, does not come from me alone, but is the result of two great musicians coming onboard so that together we can create music the way we all want it to sound, and perform it in a way that we all want to hear it.

Bands that have not only gained a large fan base, but have also released critically acclaimed albums, and all within a very short space of time.\n\nAnd it seems that his new band, DOEDSVANGR, is set to follow in the footsteps of its predecessors. With Shatraug (HORNA, SARGEIST, BEHEXEN and NIGHTBRINGER) and Anti-Christian (TSJUDER, BEATEN TO DEATH) joining the frontman on guitars and drums respectively, the band has inked a deal with the Belgian label Immortal Frost Productions for the release of its first album.\n\nWith its debut full-length, which will be titled “Satan Ov Suns”, DOEDSVANGER has created an album, that, according to the band is “very dark work, very evil and with extreme variations, but with a lot of groove”. Drums for “Satans Ov Suns” were recorded at the Oslo Klang studios, Vocals were mixed and mastered at Velvet Recording in Sypdeberg, Norway and Guitars and Bass were recorded in Tampere, Finland. The album will be mixed and mastered by producer Bjarne Stensli. “Satan Ov Suns” is set for release in 2017 at a date as yet to be announced.\n\nDoedsadmiral’s bands have proved to be very popular with fans of the Black Metal genre. NORDJEVEL, which includes current and former members of MARDUK, RAGNAROK, FATAL IMPACT, TVANGESTE and BYRDI, is the first of the bands who has stepped out of the studio and is making an impact on the live scene, whilst SVARTELDER, with current and former members of CARPATHIAN FOREST, IN THE WOODS, DEN SAAKALDTE, PANTHEON I and OLD FOREST, and ENEPSIGOS with current and former members of SARKOM, BLUT AUS NORD, DEATHROW, FIDES INVERSA, FROSTMOON ECLISPE and DARVAZA are still studio-based.\n\nSo what does he have in mind for DOEDSVANGR, and why add yet another band to his “portfolio”?\n\n“All my other bands each have a different sound and musical ethos one from the other, and DOEDSVANGR is one that comes from a much darker direction. DOEDSVANGR, like the other projects in which I’m involved, does not come from me alone, but is the result of two great musicians coming onboard so that together we can create music the way we all want it to sound, and perform it in a way that we all want to hear it. Will DOEDSVSANGR perform live one day? That remains to be seen, let’s just see where the album takes us first.\n\n“Why another band? Why not? I’ve been a fan of Black Metal, and all it’s different forms, for as long as I can remember. In fact, it was just the other day that I was saying to my manager, Patricia Thomas, that it has been twelve years since she and I first started talking about doing what I’m doing right now. Whilst many say that I do have some skill as a vocalist, I certainly don’t class myself as a brilliant musician, or writer, or anything even close to it come to that. But I have been fortunate enough to have the means that allow me to create different bands within the Extreme genre and bring together different artists, exceptional artists at that, for whom I have long had an enormous respect, and whose skills and experience fortunately more than make up for my own shortcomings. It’s that “bringing together” of these superb artists and allowing them free reign with what they do musically, that is, and always will be, the crux of what I do. Am I living the dream? Yes, most definitely! Do I work hard at all aspects of it? You bet I do! Will there be more to come in the future? Just watch this space!”\n\nMore information about DOEDSVANGR can be found on the band’s Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/doedsvangrofficial\n\nA rough demo track to give fans an idea of what to expect from the band, can be heard below and at https://soundcloud.com/doedsvangrofficial/black-sun-nimbus\n\nx\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/doedsvangrofficial\n\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/doedsvangrofficial\n\nBand Contact: Doedsvangrofficial@gmail.com\n\nManagement & PR: patriciathomas@btinternet.com\n\nImmortal Frost Poductions: http://immortalfrostproductions.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Immortalfrostproductions/\n\nContact: immortalfrostproductions@hotmail.com"
