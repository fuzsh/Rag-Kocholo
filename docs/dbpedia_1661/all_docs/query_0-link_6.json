        "text": "Finally we got new VORUM „Current Mouth\" CD 9.90€\n\n\"Current Mouth\" definitely is one of the most scary and extreme recordings ever to be spit out from Scandinavia. It's the reminder of what true Death Metal is all about & throws up on every indication of conformity and ingratiation. On \"Current Mouth\", Vorum perfectly combine the darkness of \"Divus de mortuus\", the heaviness of \"Abominations of Desolation\", the insanity of \"Salvation\", the brutality of \"Critical Madness\" and the ignorance of \"Horrified\". vorum.bandcamp.com/album/ current-mouth\n\nAs well as others Sepulhral Voice Records titles:\n\nSVR01 NECROS CHRISTOS „Triune Impurity Rites\" CD/ DLP -12.90€/22.90€\n\nDebut album of german Metal of Death cult!

The record contains an experimental streak with traditional instrumentation and chants utilised to transport the listener towards an endless void. profoundlorerecords.bandcamp. com/album/odori-sepulcrorum-2\n\nSVR012 FUNEREAL PRESENCE „The Archer Takes Aim\" CD/LP - €12.90/€16.90Grotesque, strong-willed and ugly black metal of a band that revives the atmosphere and attitude of a long gone but defining era of the genre.- The Archer Takes Aim is for devotees of the primal, repellent sound! funerealpresence.bandcamp.com/ album/the-archer-takes-aim\n\nSVR013 NECROS CHRISTOS „Nine Graves\" CD/LP - €12.90/€17.90Pure Death Metal darkness, played with utter class and perfection.

Emanating an aura of surreal morbidity with hints of doom and prog, \"Idola Specus\" is as esoteric and introspective as it is dark, heavy, and raw. drowned.bandcamp.com/album/ idola-specus\n\nKVLT/Hammer of Hate/No sign of Life:Goat Semen - Ego Svm Satana Tape/CD/LP (KVLT) - €8.90/€13.90/€19.90At long last, one of the most highly anticipated debut albums ever arrives: GOAT SEMEN's Ego Sum Sathana. At ground zero of the rebirth and resurgence of South American black/death at the dawn of the new millennium, these Peruvian devils delivered one of the most classic demos ever with their self-titled 2002 demo, which has seen countless re-editions in the past decade as well as the band's legendary grow to enviable levels. But alas, a debut album has eluded the band, and the fervor 'n' anticipation for one have reached critical mass in the metal underground. Taking on almost mythical status (not unlike Sadistic Intent's long-promised debut LP), GOAT SEMEN's Ego Sum Sathana has been in the making for literally a decade. Granted, the band's been keeping busy in the underground since the 2002 demo, releasing a handful of splits with the likes of Nazxul, Krieg, Levifer, and Japan's Sabbat, among others, as well as two highly coveted live albums - but each step of the way, it's only been a few songs teasingly released a time. Beherit - Drawing Down The Moon Digipack CD (KVLT) - €11.90\n\nOne of the most important black metal records for the first time on digipak, limited to 1000 copies\n\nAzaghal - Madon Sanat CD (Hammer Of Hate) - €12.90\n\nNew full length studio album, easily the strongest Azaghal album so far. Highly recommended if you like any of their previous releases.\n\nRienaus - Aamutähdelle CD (KVLT) - €11.90\n\nFinnish black metal in traditional Nordic way. Debut full-length album.\n\nSuuri Shamaani - Mysteerien Maailma CD (KVLT) - €10.90\n\nRe-release of only album from ambiet project of Beherit's Holocausto. Limited to 300 copies.\n\nRaate - Menetyksen Tie MC (KVLT) €8.90\n\nTape version of 2nd album released by Spinefarm. Limited to 240 hand numbered copies.\n\nRide for Revenge - Under the Eye CD (KVLT) - €11.90\n\nRide For Revenge celebrates the band´s first full decade by unleashing their third and definitive album. Occult Black Metal with deepest frequencies and heaviest rhythms the genre has ever produced.\n\nBloodhammer / Ride for Revenge - Chords Of The Left Hand CD (KVLT) - €11.90\n\nTwo finnish elite black metal bands has united in this unholy split release. BLOODHAMMER\n\ncontinuing with their filthy old school black metal art, offering really strong material again. RIDE FOR REVENGE goes to the new dimension again, this time with extremely bestial and ugly\n\nblack metal you haven't hear before. This split is not for you!!! LP version comes with noble gatefold covers and heavy weight vinyl. MC is factory pressed and sealed.\n\nPrecambian - Proarkhe 7\"EP (Primitive Reaction) - €7,90\n\nNew band formed by 3 Drudkh members: R.-vocals/ guitars, K.- bass, V.- drums. Slavonic black metal in the vein of HATE FOREST with nordic influences)\n\nOminous - Death…The Beginning MCD (Primitive Reaction) - €7.90\n\nFierce & melodic black metal with former members of Urn and Behexen. CD version of debut recording with bonus track Endless Nightmares and different artwork made by Ritual at Nucleart Design.\n\nScythe - Subterranean Steel CD (Primitve Reaction) - €10.90\n\nForged out of the ashes of the legendary Chicago band Usurper, Scythe was spawned in 2009 to expand upon Usurper's legacy of headbanging, fistbanging, underground metal anthems. Scythe's metal assault incorporates the style of 80's thrash/black/speed metal, combined with elements of classic heavy metal and heavy rock n' roll to create an original sound that follows no modern trends. In 2012 Scythe released its' debut album for Primitive Reaction Records entitled, Beware The Scythe. Beware The Scythe became an instant underground metal classic, garnishing positive reviews and interviews in magazines and webzines worldwide, including a mention in the \"Top Ten Albums of 2012\" from legendary German Magazine \"Voices From the Darkside\". Scythe's second album Subterranean Steel will be released September 2013 on Primitive Reaction Records. Subterranean Steel is a sonic juggernaut of apocalyptic aggression; a nine song pummeling assault of head-banging, fist-banging metal anthems paying homage to end time prophecies, conspiracies and occult powers of the the diabolical elite.\n\nBarathrum - Infernal CD/DLP (Primitive Reaction) - €11.90/€24.90\n\nThird BARATHRUM album finally available again after 15 years of waiting! Jet black metal masterpiece! First time on vinyl! Demonic Christ / Horna - Split 7\"EP (Hammer of Hate) - €7.90\n\nFinland vs USA!

The strongest and most solid AB release so far presenting the new style of AB with mid-tempo crushing and fast blasting Black Metal accompanied with blasphemous vocal outbursts of violent mockery. The theme of the EP is a true story about a transsexual vicar in Finland, ridiculing his perversion of faith and the work against the creation of his god!\n\nAnal Blasphemy - Profane Fornication Ejaculation CD (Hammer Of Hate) - €11.90\n\n2nd album of finnish black metal perversor!!!\n\nVitsaus - Sielunmessu CD (Hammer of Hate) - €9.90\n\nFirst and so far only album of finnish black metal duo!\n\nBloodhammer - Passion of the Devil MCD (Hammer of Hate) - €7.90\n\nOver 20 minutes of music from finnish duo!\n\nFatherland - Blood of the Patriots (No sign of life) MCD - €8.90\n\nDebut minialbum of new Helsinki based Black Metal band.\n\nStormheit - Pohjanmaa CD (Hammer Of Hate) - €11.90\n\nBrand new studio album! National romantic folk metal.\n\nDarkwood My Bethroned - Heirs of The Northstar (No Sign of Life) CD €10.90\n\nPeaceville:\n\nDiabolical Masquerade - Nightwork (Digipack CD) €12.90\n\nDiabolical Masquerade was the solo-project created by Katatonia's Anders \"Blakkheim\" Nyström in 1996, to let off more creative steam away from the gothic/doom metal styling of Katatonia. Diabolical Masquerade was based primarily around symphonic/melodic black metal; creating eerie atmospheres through keyboards and utilizing more high energy & technical compositions than those of his main band, with complex patterns of riffs and hooks.\n\nThis particular album saw a greater prominence of synths than ever before, to convey strong horror-related themes. To further expand this atmosphere, cello and flute were also incorporated.\n\n\"Nightwork\" was the third album by Diabolical Masquerade. It was recorded at The Sanctuary in April 1998 and saw a release later that year. The album was produced by Dan Swanö and Blakkheim.\n\nAlthough a solo-project, Blakkheim enlisted the help of Dan Swanö to perform the drums, as well as contributing with some keyboards and backing vocals to this album. Diabolical Masquerade released 4 albums in total, before Blakkheim laid the project to rest in 2004.\n\nDiabolical Masquerade - Ravendusk in my Heart (Digipack CD) €12.90\n\n\"Ravendusk In My Heart\" was originally released in 1996 and stands as a startling debut of fantastic imagery, shaped by accomplished atmospherics mixed with cold black metal, bringing to mind the early works of Emperor, all brought to life with deeply imaginative tales of fantasy from Blackheim's realm.\n\nThe album was recorded at Unisound Studio in September 1995. It was produced by Dan Swano & Blackheim, and mixed by Dan Swano (familiar for his work with Opeth, Dissection, Marduk, etc).Diabolical Masquerade released 4 albums in total, before Blakkheim laid the project to rest in 2004.\n\nDodheimsgard - 666 International (CD) €12.90\n\nTo fans of black metal, Dødheimsgard need no introduction, being as they are one of the great purveyors of the Norwegian Black Metal creative evolution. The band was formed in 1994 by Aldrahn (Thorns) and Vicotnik (Ved Buens Ende). The early incarnation was that of a raw and melodic black metal band, with their debut album also featuring Fenriz of Darkthrone on bass.\n\nThe band quickly evolved, and by Dødheimsgard's third album, \"666 International\", Vicotnik had taken over a lot of the writing duties, with DHG's style becoming more technical yet ferocious black metal, with strong experimental ideas and industrial elements. Vicotnik's riffs were inspired by cult bands such as Thorns, and perfectly entwined with Aldrahn?s delightfully twisted lyrics and immense vocals to create something truly unique. In its \"666 International\" incarnation, DHG as they were later to be known featured a line-up of well-respected Norwegian musicians including Czral (Aura Noir, Ved Buens Ends, Virus), Apollyon (Aura Noir, Immortal), plus Mr Magic Logic (Fleurety) on keyboards, as the album was constructed over a period of time. All in all \"666 International\" is rightly regarded as a highly influential masterpiece of avant-garde metal by many since its release in 1999.\n\nDodheimsgard - A Umbra Omega (CD/Double LP)€15.90/€29.90\n\nFeaturing a raw and organic production, the 2015 album from DHG (Dodheimsgard) contains 68 minutes of twisted, sprawling epics. With 'A Umbra Omega', the boundary-pushing visionaries of the mid-1990's Norwegian Black Metal evolution take their psychotic Psychedelia-tinged avant-Metal to a new level of creativity. DHG's first album since 2007's 'Supervillain Outcast’, it represents the band's most challenging work to date.Double 180g vinyl edition in a gatefold cover.\n\nDodheimsgard - Supervillain Outcast (Double CD/Double vinyl) €12.90/€26.90\n\nTo fans of black metal, Dødheimsgard need no introduction, being as they are one of the great purveyors of the Norwegian Black Metal creative evolution. The band was formed in 1994 by Aldrahn (Thorns) and Vicotnik (Ved Buens Ende). The early incarnation was that of a raw and melodic black metal band, with their debut album also featuring Fenriz of Darkthrone on bass, & over time they became known as one of the premier avantgarde black metal acts.\n\n\"Supervillain Outcast\" was Dødheimsgard's (also known as DHG) fourth album, & was originally released in 2007. With mastermind Vicotnik at the helm, this was also the first album to feature Mat \"Kvohst\" McNerney on vocals (Hexvessel, ex-Code) after the departure of founding member Aldrahn several years prior. The drums were also performed by Czral (Aura Noir, Virus), & recorded before his accident which had left him paralysed. \"Supervillain\" was a forward-thinking venture through the realms of black/death & industrial metal with progressive experimentation far beyond the usual confines of the genre.\n\nThis new & very special edition of \"Supervillain Outcast\" contains a full extra disc with 7 tracks of exclusive & previously unheard studio tracks & instrumental songs which were captured with top sound quality at a rehearsal in 2002, deep into the writing process for \"Supervillain Outcast\". The booklet features liner notes written by Vicotnik.\n\nEnslaved - Yggdrasill (CD/Vinyl) €12.90/€26.90\n\nEnslaved was formed by Ivar Bjørnson and Grutle Kjellson in 1991, & are based in Bergen, Norway. Ivar & Grutle had previously played together in the death metal band, Phobia. Taking a different route to many of the extreme metal Norwegian bands of the early 90's, Enslaved embraced their Viking history & culture, composing ferocious epics of extreme metal combined with hypnotic riffs & repetitious structures; Enslaved even becoming signed to Euronymous' Deathlike Silence label early in their career.\n\n'Yggdrasill' was the band's second demo (following 1991's feet-finding 'Nema'), showing a young band with great passion & creativity. The songs were understandably raw & contained some traits of the Norwegian wave of black metal sweeping the region at the time, along with their own individual touch. Although more focused on Viking/Norwegian lore than anything satanic, Enslaved's signature sound still captured the magic of the genre with long, hypnotic compositions losing the listener within their vast sonic landscapes.\n\nOver the years, the band has integrated strong elements of progressive music into their compositions & Enslaved has gone on to worldwide notoriety for their stunning live shows & accomplished blend of atmospherics & sumptuous, powerful riffs, receiving numerous accolades along the way, including Norwegian Grammys. This limited black vinyl edition of 'Yggdrasill' features the bonus track 'Enslaved' plus new liner notes written by the band.\n\nMortuary Drape - Buried in Time (CD/Double vinyl)€13.90/€27.90\n\nCult band Mortuary Drape was formed in Italy in 1986 as a trio, including the now long-standing & sole-remaining member, Wildness Perversion. Highly inspired by the dark arts & combining early influences from bands such as Mercyful Fate & Celtic Frost, Mortuary Drape developed their own unique style, defining themselves as black occult metal & releasing the demo ‘Necromancy’ in 1987 which spread their name throughout the underground; though it was not until 1992 that their first official release surfaced, with ‘Into the Drape’. This was followed by the debut full-length album, the classic ‘All the Witches Dance’ in 1994.\n\n‘Buried in Time’ was released in 2004 & was the Italian group’s fourth album. Keeping with the dark ambience of their previous efforts whilst venturing into what could be deemed more accessible territory with clearer production values, ‘Buried in Time’ was still a metallic tour de force of thrashing yet melodic riffing. The album was recorded and mixed at Alpha Omega Studio, Como (Italy) during the summer of 2004\n\n‘Buried in Time is presented here in newly remastered form, with the process itself overseen by the band, & includes 2 extra tracks, ‘Beyond the Veil’ & ‘The Envoy’. Vinyl edition is presented on 180gm heavyweight black double gatefold vinyl.\n\nMortuary Drape - Tolling 13 Knell (CD/Double Vinyl) €13.90/€27.90\n\nCult band Mortuary Drape was formed in Italy in 1986 as a trio, including the now long-standing & sole-remaining member, Wildness Perversion. Highly inspired by the dark arts & combining early influences from bands such as Mercyful Fate & Celtic Frost, Mortuary Drape developed their own unique style, defining themselves as black occult metal & releasing the demo ‘Necromancy’ in 1987 which spread their name throughout the underground; though it was not until 1992 that their first official release surfaced, with ‘Into the Drape’. This was followed by the debut full-length album, the classic ‘All the Witches Dance’ in 1994.\n\n’Tolling 13 Knell’, Mortuary Drape’s third full-length album was originally released in 2000 on Avantgarde Music. Often regarded as one of the band’s strongest works, the album delivers an eerie concoction of evil metal riffing & dark occult atmosphere to unnerving effect. ’Tolling 13 Knell’ has now been fully remastered especially for this release, with the process overseen by the band. This reissue also contains extra tracks in the form of re-recorded versions of the infamous ‘Doom Return’ demo songs. These new versions were recorded during the ‘Tolling 13 Knell’ sessions.\n\nMortuary Drape have recently been busy recording their latest album, as well as performing some high profile shows. This edition of 'Tolling 13 Knell' is presented on 180gm black double gatefold vinyl.\n\nMysticum - In the Streams of Inferno (CD+DVD/Vinyl) €14.90/€27.90\n\nOne of the pioneering industrial black metal forces to emerge in the early 90's, Mysticum brought to the world a completely unique brand of extreme & psychedelic discordant black metal with insane drum machine patterns & synths. They were originally signed to Euronymous' Deathlike Silence Productions label, such was his belief in the band (Mysticum even featured Hellhammer from Mayhem in their line-up for a brief period). However, this venture proved to be cut short following his death, forcing Mysticum to look elsewhere for the release of their eventual debut album, 'In the Streams of Inferno', finally surfacing in 1996.\n\nA perfect concoction of cold, primitive black metal & forward-thinking ideas from an act unafraid to push boundaries, the hell of 'In the Streams of Inferno' has had a lasting & profound impact on many since 1996. For this release, the album has now had some extensive remastering work courtesy of Tom Kvålsvoll at Strype Studios in Oslo to give a better representation of the sound the band initially intended, & includes 2 bonus songs. The packaging also contains new artwork made in close association with the band to fully reflect their intended vision, plus liner notes & additional lyrics.\n\nThis edition of ‘In the Streams of Inferno’ also includes a bonus DVD containing two live shows from 1996. ‘Grotten’, in Asker, Norway has until now been totally unknown to the masses except for the few that were present at the show. The other show is the more well-known Bradford, UK set from Mysticum’s European tour with Marduk & Gehenna. Overall both gigs give a great glimpse into the pure atmosphere & intensity of this cult act, & a must for all fans.\n\nUnifying the core trio of Herr General Cerastes, Prime & Dr. Best in late 2011, Mysticum have commenced work on their follow-up album, ’Planet Satan’, to be released 2013 on Peaceville Records.\n\nThis edition of 'Planet Satan' is presented on 180gm heavyweight vinyl with gatefold sleeve. Please note that this no longer contains a free poster.\n\nMysticum - Lost Masters of the Universe (CD/Double Vinyl) €14.90/€27.90\n\nOne of the pioneering industrial black metal forces to emerge in the early 90's, Mysticum brought to the world a completely unique brand of extreme & psychedelic discordant black metal with insane drum machine patterns & synths. They were originally signed to Euronymous' Deathlike Silence Productions label, such was his belief in the band (Mysticum even featured Hellhammer from Mayhem in their line-up for a brief period). However, this venture proved to be cut short following his death, forcing Mysticum to look elsewhere for the release of their eventual debut album, 'In the Streams of Inferno', finally surfacing in 1996.\n\nCombining the classic demos & early works of this cult band, ’Lost Masters of the Universe’ has also now received some extensive remastering work courtesy of Tom Kvålsvoll at Strype Studios in Oslo - from original tape sources - to give an entirely new breadth to the songs compared to prior versions. This edition of ’Lost Masters...’ also features the legendary ’Piss Off’ promo tape in its entirety for the first time.\n\nThe packaging contains new artwork made in close association with the band, plus liner notes.\n\nThis edition of ’Lost Masters of the Universe’ is presented on double 180gm heavyweight vinyl with gatefold sleeve & poster.\n\nMysticum Planet Satan (digibook CD/Vinyl) €13.90/€29.90\n\nHaving achieved almost mythical status in black metal lore, 'Planet Satan' has been rumoured since the late 1990's, following the band's debut release, 1996's 'In the Streams of Inferno'. Unifying the core trio of Herr General Cerastes, Svartravn & DrBest, 'Planet Satan' is now upon us.\n\nA work of intense and otherworldly black metal power injected with Mysticum's strong cosmic, satanic and psychedelic overtones, 'Planet Satan' welcomes Mysticum to the new millennium with full & unrelenting force, whilst retaining the core elements which made the Norwegians pioneering legends of industrial black metal.\n\nBoth infernal & nihilistic, as well as apocalyptic in its scope and execution, 'Planet Satan' is a new milestone for the genre in its sublime, chaotic ferocity. Primitive minor-chord riff patterns & tortured vocals mixed with the band's manic and often unconventional programmed drum beats makes this an eerily hypnotic work of the darkest order.\n\nThe album was recorded & mixed at Fias Co. Studios with producer Sverre Dæhli, & mastered by Tom Kvålsvoll at Strype Audio in Oslo.\n\nEmerging in the early 1990's, Mysticum brought to the world a completely unique brand of psychedelic discordant black metal with insane drum machine patterns & synths. They were originally (and briefly) signed to Euronymous' Deathlike Silence Productions label, such was his belief in the band.\n\nThis CD edition of 'Planet Satan' is presented in digibook format and vinyl edition of 'Planet Satan' is presented on 180gm heavyweight vinyl with gatefold sleeve. Please note that this no longer contains a free poster.\n\nOphthalamia - A Journey in Darkness (CD)€12.90\n\nThis Swedish band was formed in 1989 by IT, mainly known for his dark band Abruptum, (which was signed to DSP, the label of ex-Mayhem guitarist Euronymous) and his heavy presence in the Scandinavian black metal scene in the late 80's & early 90's.\n\nOpthalamia was a land of pure fantasy created by IT and the songs are connected to stories based around this fantasy-world. The original vocalist of the band was All (also in Abruptum), but he was then replaced by Shadow (Jon Nödtveidt of classic death/black metal band, Dissection). Shadow handled vocals this album, the band's debut album, originally released in 1994.\n\nThough the band could be classified as black metal, there is much more to Opthalamia, with varied metal influences, tempo changes and melodic passages becoming progressively more prominent, helping to distinguish them from their peers. The album was produced by the legendary Dan Swano (Opeth, Katatonia, etc) & Opthalamia at Unisound in 1993.\n\nWorld Terror Committe:\n\nAbsurd / Grand Belial’s Key / Sigrblot - Weltenfeind CD €11.90\n\nOne of the best splits ever.. only unreleased studio material, and (most probably) last GBK recording ever.\n\nAbsurd - Facta Loquuntur CD €10.90\n\nAmestigon - Thier CD €12.90\n\nAt long last, one of the unsung pillars of the Austrian black metal scene returns to reclaim their throne: W.T.C. PRODUCTIONS proudly presents AMESTIGON's monumental second album, Thier. A sprawling, wholly intoxicating mass of metaphysical might and mystical atmosphere, Thier comprises four vast, void-dwelling expanses of obsidian sound, with each track in the double digits and the title track itself topping nearly 20 minutes. And yet, every second of the way, AMESTIGON weave spells that draw in the listener and literally drowns them with dense, patiently evolving layers of otherworldly decibels wrought from mere strings, synth, and drums.\n\nIt's a form of sonic alchemy, one that the band has explored during their on/off career since the mid 1990s, but never have AMESTIGON sounded so potent as they do on Thier. Longtime listeners can cite the album as authentic to the original wave of '90s black metal; however, the band are restless sonic sorcerers and repeating themselves is never an option, so new landscapes of the mind and spirit are sown on this second full-length. From artwork to lyrics to the sound production itself, there is a totality of experience to Thier, and AMESTIGON willingly offer four keys to the beyond. Liberation is yours for the taking.\n\nAcherontas - Ma-IoN(Formulas Of Reptilian Unification) CD €11.90\n\nJewelcase CD version of the latest Acherontas album, “Ma-IoN (Formulas Of Reptilian Unification)“.\n\nDarkmoon Warrior - Nuke 'Em All CD €9.90\n\nAll too appropriately titled, Nuke 'Em All marks the first DARKMOON WARRIOR album in nearly five years, and is their third to date. With a robust and rounded production, DARKMOON WARRIOR's new album continues the German tradition of dense, atmospheric black metal that they helped create in the first place, here with more variation and even more violence. At times vile and thrashing, other times hideous and hypnotic, Nuke 'Em All is a winding journey through arcane secrets, moonlit rituals, and blasphemous hatred. None shall be standing after DARKMOON WARRIOR Nuke 'Em All... (N.T.B)\n\nDarkmoon Warrior - Crown of snakes DigiCD €9.90\n\nAfter several Demo's, the \"We Walk the Infernal Path\" split album with Eternity, Luror and Shadows Toward My Sky and the \"In Fundis Inferiorum\" Mini album, Darkmoon Warrior finally present their debut album \"Cown of snakes\", which holds over 52 minutes of traditional Black Metal.The album comes as a Digi CD, incl. Booklet.\n\nDevathorn - Vritra CD €11.90\n\nDelving into the fathomless Qliphothic depths, Vritra revives the powerful Draconian archetype of the Sulphur Dragon. Bearing the strong symbolism of the restless Adversary, Vritra embodies the fury of Leviathan, the liberating spirit of Prometheus, and the majesty of Sutekh the King. He is the dreaming Dragon Tiamat, Typhon the Destroyer, and Lucifer, the great Adversary. The aspects of Vritra reflect into the forthcoming opus of DEVATHORN that bears his name, emanating 11 mantras of raging black metal madness.\n\nHorna - Askel Lähempänä Saatanaa CD €9.90\n\nHorna's 9th full length album,entitled \"Askel Lähempänä Saatanaa\" (translated: A Step Closer to Satan). Musically the Band describes the album: \"as a union of the early days raging hatred with fresh blood and currents. Our ninth full-lenght is also a step closer to Satan with it's lyrical approach, closing in on a necrospiritual atmosphere\".\n\nSargeist - Feeding The Crawling Shadows - CD/Gatefold LP €11.90/€17.90\n\n\"Four years on from their critically acclaimed Let the Devil In masterpiece, SARGEIST return with their massively anticipated fourth album, Feeding the Crawling Shadows. More than just a quintessentially \"black metal\" album title, Feeding the Crawling Shadows is a veritable raison d'etre for these Finnish scene legends: With faith and devotion, through ritual and necromancy, SARGEIST feed the blackest, most Satanic essence at the core of BLACK METAL and, in turn, wield its clandestine powers with sorcerous might. But while predecessor Let the Devil In was indeed hailed far and wide as a masterpiece, the coven of SARGEIST is always lurking where no light dwells, brewing potent spells more diabolical than the last, and this solemn commitment is played out across the ten tracks that comprise Feeding the Crawling Shadows. Instantly recognizable as SARGEIST - and in particular, the malign riff-majesty of the ubiquitous Shatraug - here, the quartet go a concertedly rawer route, but with no sacrifice in quality. If anything, their freezing landscapes penetrate the soul that much deeper. As such, SARGEIST have once again topped themselves, delivering yet another masterpiece of purest black metal magick in Feeding the Crawling Shadows.\"(N.T.B.)\n\nThe Vinyl version of \"Feeding the Crawling Shadows\" comes with a Gatefold cover and heavy vinyl.\n\nSargeist - The Rebirth Of A Cursed Existence CD/ Gatefold DLP€10.90/€19.90\n\nThis CD features all Sargeist songs which were previously available solely on vinyl, tape and compilation releases.

The pan-international trio's second album, Katabasis is unremittingly dark yet colored with shades of texture generally beyond the purest-of-the-pure hordes: TORTORUM strike deep into the burning heart of black metal whilst exhibiting dazzling 'n' daring compositional prowess. Each song is an epic in its own right, and a cursory scan of the album's song titles - \"In Nameless NonBeing,\" \"Into the Sixth Coil,\" and penultimate closer \"Beyond The Earth And Air And Sun - reveal that the band's lyricism is as deadly committed to transcendence as their multi-hued music. The black sun rises, and it shines upon TORTORUM...(N.T.B.)\n\nThe vinyl version of \"Katabasis\" comes in an heavy cardboard Gatefold LP sleeve with an 12\" booklet booklet attached to it.100 copies of the double lp come with 2 x clear and the remaining copies with 2 x black vinyl.\n\nThy Darkened Shade - Eternvs Mos, Nex Ritvs Gatefold LP & 20 pages booklet €17.90\n\nHigh quality vinyl version of Thy Darkened Shade's debut album.“Eternvs Mos, Nex Ritvs” is nothing but sheer sinister Black Metal brutality, celebrated by Semjaza (Acrimonious),The A and Maelstrom (Thou Art Lord,Ravencult etc.).\n\nVinyl details:\n\n- Gatefold cover (thick cardboard) with UV gloss spot varnish\n\n- printed innersleeve\n\n- LP sized 20 pages booklet\n\n- 180 gr. vinyl\n\n- 100 copies with gold colored vinyl,400 copies with black vinyl\n\nKadotus - Vaienneet Temppelit Gatefold LP (Blut & Eisen Productions) €16.90\n\nVinyl version of \"Vaienneet temppelit\",the second full length album of Kadotus from Finland.\n\nVinyl Details:\n\n- Gatefold Cover with UV spot lamination\n\n- black vinyl (lim. 400)\n\nNebelfee Klangwerke:\n\nAbsurd - Raubritter/Grimmige Volksmusik CD €12.90\n\nAbsurd - Asgardsrei CD €9.90"
