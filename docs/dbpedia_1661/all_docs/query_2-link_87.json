        "text": "Archived\n\nGrief\n\nCome To Grief\n\nCentury Media\n\nGrief’s latest release Come to Grief chugs on like a freight train stuck in a tar pit. The band sets out “to play the heaviest, slowest, most mind-numbing music humanly possible,” and damn if they don’t. Well, what more can I say? It’s doom.\n\nPentagram\n\nBe Forewarned\n\nFierce Recordings\n\nSo what was the name of this band? Pentagramps? Oh… Pentagram. Hey, give me a break. This band has been around since I was wearing diapers—1971 to be exact. I don’t know where I’ve been, but I’ve never heard of these guys in my entire life. I guess it’s because most of their previous material has been kept underground or never released. The band had broken up but in 1990 reformed. The bio states that “…the band at that time was busy with side projects, most notably drummer Joe Hasselvander’s participation in Raven.” Wait a minute… “most notably … participation in Raven.” Raven?? Uh, huh, huh. If you’re into slow, heavily Sabbath influenced music this is one for you.\n\nSHIHAD\n\nKilljoy\n\nNoise Records\n\nShihad must be the new flagship at Noise Records. Can you say the word “hype.” Billboard magazine has touted the band as “…the country’s most exciting international rock prospect.” Yeah, I can see that. They’re way better than that other great band out of New Zealand? Am I missing something? Could be. The band also has some pretty heavy endorsements from people like Faith No More’s Billy Gould, and Metallica’s main axe-grinder Kirk Hammett. If you’re looking for rock with a hard alternative edge, check this out. Or, turn on X-96.\n\nSepultura\n\nThird World Chaos (Video)\n\nRoadrunner\n\nBrazilian sensations Sepultura have recently released their second full-length home video. To love these guys is to see them live, and Third World Chaos gives you plenty to hold you off until their next Salt Lake visit. Live footage includes appearances from Castle Donington, Red Rocks and their home in Brazil. The video also includes many of their videos, which you only saw if you stayed up for the final hour of Headbanger.\n\nShelter\n\nMantra\n\nRoadrunner\n\nThe latest release by the band Shelter has honestly blown me away, and I’m not just saying that (this time). Shelter has been around since 1990, formed by Ray Cappo and Procell who were both members of the now-defunct band Youth of Today. Mantra is Shelter’s fourth release but the first offered by the Roadrunner label. The band’s sound and style are in my opinion reminiscent of the band Rage Against the Machine. A real strong point on this one is the vocals. Cappo’s singing style is very melodic and blends in well with the alternative/hardcore riffing of Porcell. Subject matter for the songs comes from the band’s involvement with the Hare Krishna movement. The band promotes healthy attitudes and lifestyles. What do you mean no damn beer? If you’re looking for a change from the same old crap, check out Shelter’s Mantra. –FORGACH"
