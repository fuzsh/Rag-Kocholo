The best is 95 (QB at Vandy) and there is a 92 as well.\n\nI simmed three recruiting classes in a file. The results I saw were absolutely staggering:\n\nQBs with 91+ speed: 38 per class\n\nQBs with 93+ speed: 22 per class\n\nQBs with 95+ speed: 9 per class\n\nQBs with 97+ speed: 3 per class\n\nAll of these were Athletes with Scrambler QB as their archetype.\n\nIt's absolutely maddening that the devs claimed to look at ten years of historical data to determine pipeline, but they didn't consider their own base roster when developing recruiting classes. I can't quite understand the oversight.. especially when this was a fundamental problem in NCAA 14.\n\nA secondary issue here is that the CPU simply never adjusts an athletes position. As a result they'll hoard 7+ QBs, and I've seen rosters where the CPU will sign three quarterbacks with 90+ speed. It all just becomes homogenous, and the other two archetypes are irrelevant.\n\nRookie\n\nOVR: 3\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2008\n\nLocation: Austin, Texas\n\nRe: Athletes (especially Athlete QBs) need immediate attention from EA\n\nIt's becoming increasingly obvious that very minimal work was done on Dynasty mode beyond the getting key functionalities working at a baseline level.\n\nThey seriously could have just simulated a single season, looked at the results, and gone \"hmm...that doesn't look right\" to SO MANY THINGS, and yet this is what was shipped.\n\nThis is just another example.\n\n__________________\n\nHook 'em Horns!

NCAA 14s dynasty had its issues, but at least the sim engine was okay and we could edit. It took me maybe 45 minutes to realize that the mode is terrible.\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\nLast edited by young22; 08-06-2024 at 04:27 PM.\n\nRookie\n\nOVR: 0\n\nJoin Date: May 2024\n\nRe: Athletes (especially Athlete QBs) need immediate attention from EA\n\nAlso annoying is that when I recruit an athlete QB (and maybe its athlete anything), I cant edit the position when I first get them on the roster. I recruited 3 centers my first year and made two of them guards. But athletes dont show up in the position change section, so youre stuck where the game places them (main position) until one year later.\n\nHas to be a bug. But its annoying.\n\nHaze88 likes this."
