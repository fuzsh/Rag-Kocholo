        "text": "The year is almost coming to an end and here I am writing the October highlights! I know this is very late, I should be posting the November highlights but time hasn’t been my friend lately. With that being said I will simply skip the November edition and jump straight to the albums of the year article with my next article. Before that though be sure to check out my upcoming Horna review, an album that will be a favorite among black metal fans for sure. This month saw some very good releases where the top 5 once again was a hard one to set into stone. Grafvitnir, Wayfarer, Inferi and Necrophobic were all going in and out of the top 5 but eventually fell a bit short from the picks I made so if anything be sure to check those albums out too as a couple of those will be featured on my top 50 of the year! I haven’t made a playlist for this month, due to the fact I’m working on the album of the year list and will have a massive playlist for that. Stay safe out there!\n\nAlbum of the month\n\nWhen it comes to melodic death metal I see Mors Principium Est as the uncrowned kings. Album after album they bring some of the best riffs you’ll ever hear and Seven is no different. Melodic death metal doesn’t get much better than this.\n\nMors Principium Est – Seven was released October 23rd via AFM Records.\n\nRunners-up\n\nAuðn keeps on growing even after a superb debut album back in 2014. Vökudraumsins Fangi is their best work yet and now three albums in of very high atmospheric black metal quality it’s safe to say they are a band to stay on the upper tiers of the genre.\n\nAuðn – Vökudraumsins Fangi was released October 30th via Season of Mist.\n\n16 years after their last album Goratory returns and better than ever! I honestly wasn’t that keen on them before but with Sour Grapes they blew me away. When a band consists of members from acts such as Job For a Cowboy and Deeds of Flesh you could kind of have guessed it would be top notch stuff!\n\nGoratory – Sour Grapes was released October 16th via Everlasting Spew Records.\n\nAs far as doom metal goes for me Draconian is one of the greats. Under a Godless Veil is another example of great craftsmanship where the band once again shows they are the best in the business.\n\nDraconian – Under a Godless Veil was released October 30th via Napalm Records.\n\nAnother return on the list, this time 15 years after their last album! To me Tusen år har gott… is one of the best black metal albums ever released and to see Mörk Gryning coming back with such hunger again is great. I would honestly say this is their best album after Tusen år har gott…, hard to say though when the band have released four superb albums in the past (I won’t name one of them). Safe to say that Hinsides Vrede is an album any black metal fan should listen to!\n\nMörk Gryning – Hinsides Vrede was released October 23rd via Season of Mist.\n\nMore great music of October\n\nInvincible Force – Decomposed Sacramentum\n\nSvartsyn – Requiem\n\nGrafvitnir – Death’s Wings Widespread\n\nDistant – Dawn of Corruption\n\nDemonical – World Domination\n\nWayfarer – A Romance With Violence\n\nWeight of Emptiness – Conquering the Deep Cycle\n\nCarnal Ruin – The Damned Lie Rotting\n\nArsebreed – Butoh\n\nCermonial Bloodbath – The Tides of Blood\n\nSeptage – Septic Decadence\n\nCynabare Urne – Obsidian Daggers and Cinnabar Skulls\n\nÅskog – Varg\n\nWombripper – Macabre Melodie\n\nDisrupted – Pure Death\n\nGrimorte – Revie\n\nLord Almighty – Wither\n\nCoexistence – Collateral Dimension\n\nIskandr – Gelderse poort\n\nStriges – Verum Veterum\n\nIncinerate – Sacrilegivm\n\nAphonic Threnody – The Great Hatred\n\nSkyless Aeons – Drain the Sun\n\nBenediction – Scriptures\n\nJohansson & Speckmann – The Germs of Circumstance\n\nNecrophobic – Dawn of the Damned\n\nInferi – Of Sunless Realms\n\nFurnace – Dark Vistas\n\nCellar Vessel – Vein Beneath the Soil\n\nDesperate – The Last Days of Humanity\n\nWhen Blood Falls Down – Pandæmonium\n\nMorphogenetic Malformation – Into The Odiousness\n\nAntzaat – For You Men Who Gaze Into the Sun\n\nFuneral Harvest – Funeral Harvest\n\nInfera Bruo – Rites of the Nameless\n\nSulphur Sun – Placodermic Heraldry\n\nInfiltration – Point Blank Termination\n\nConjureth – The Levitation Manifest\n\nWallfahrer – Lightbringer​-​Leidbringer\n\nDevoured by the Abyss – Omnipotence\n\nSigns of Omnicide – Interplanetary Harvest\n\nCryogenical Excision – Micro Surgery\n\nFetor – Downwards to Distress\n\nA Pretext to Human Suffering is a new band on the technical brutal death metal, with hints of slam and deathcore, scene. The band features some very high profile names within the community where Marco Pitruzzella on drums is probably the one who stands out the most due to his time in bands such as Rings of Saturn, Six Feet Under, Sobek, Brain Drill and Habitual Depravity. Add 3/5 members of Defleshed and Gutted (two of those are also in Devour the Unborn), a band I personally love and spin ever so often and you got a recipe for great metal ahead! Sadly it doesn’t quite live up to my high expectations.\n\nThe guitar solos are on point with the title track “Rotting Sanctum” and “No Light Lives” goes super hard which both ends up being highlights on this EP. I do find the vocals being too low on the album overall whereas it’s extra noticeable on “Chain of Command // Oppression” to me, a track I end up skipping quite quickly. On “No Light Lives” that isn’t an issue do for some reason as the mix there is perfect. That kinda ruins quite a bit of the experience with Rotting Sanctum in my opinion which is a shame, but also showcase the importance of great production. The guitars though, song after song the riffing is great which is definitely a main reason for me to get back to Rotting Sanctum for a few songs. Otherwise there isn’t anything that stands out enough on Rotting Sanctum that makes me want to take this album for repeat listens, fans of the genre might want to take this for a spin or two but probably jump on to the next album after that.\n\nA shame the production bothers me quite a bit (the sound quality and levels are honestly quite different from track to track, almost like they were recorded on separate sessions with different hardware) as it could potentially be a more solid album if that was better handled, however for now the album suffers for it. Close to a three but there wasn’t enough for me to justify that score when the mixing was bellow average where there were only really two, maybe three songs on a five song EP that I could recommend. “No Light Lives” is a song that goes damn hard though and that will feature on my playlist(s) for a long time. If they keep the levels of “No Light Lives”, “Rotting Sanctum” or even “Loathe” with a decent mix to go with it then next time around I’m sure to have a way better time with A Pretext to Human Suffering. This is only a debut EP though, which did have some good moments, and the members surely have what it takes to dance with the bigger names out there, just not yet.\n\nArtist: A Pretext to Human Suffering\n\nLabel: Realityfade Records\n\nRelease date: November 27th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: No Light Lives\n\nFor fans of: Defleshed and Gutted & Bleak Flesh\n\nScore: 2.5/5 Decent\n\nA Pretext to Human Suffering\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/apths\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/apthscult/\n\nhttps://apthscult.com/\n\nhttps://apretexttohumansuffering.bandcamp.com/\n\nRealityfade Records\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/realityfade\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/realityfaderecords/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realityfadeco\n\nhttps://www.realityfade.com/\n\nhttps://realityfade.bandcamp.com/\n\nCarnal Abhorrence might be a name you’ve heard before as it’s only a bit over a year ago since they released their debut album titled Gormandizing Rapture. In case you haven’t, or simply forgot, let me recap. The band consists of the duo Nick Loria (vocals, lyrics) and AJ Lucas (guitars, drums programming) where you follow Djirinn, an experiment gone wrong and now he want to annihilate the world after having escaped. The journey continues as their second album is approaching us. Will Djirinn succeed in his quest on conquering the world?\n\nYou know what I love? When TBDM goes in full gear from the very first note and guess what? That’s exactly what Carnal Abhorrence does on The Crowned Apocalypse opener, the title track, wasting no time on bashing our skulls in with high quality riffs from AJ Lucas, fast paced drums (programmed, which is a minor negative to me but they do a great job here truth be told) and Nick Loria’s superb vocal performance. The duo’s debut album Gormandizing Rapture was a nasty release but it didn’t quite do it for me personally. Here though they are firing on all cylinders and seem to really have grown a lot as a band in only a year! Massive strides in the right direction and they’ve now gone from a band I thought was ok, but not really something I had my eye on for future releases into a TBDM machine who takes no prisoners.\n\nCarnal Abhorrence has surprised me with this release. From what I thought might be a solid release but nothing more, nothing less turns out to be one of the best TBDM albums I’ve heard this year. Sure the drums are programmed and at times I do miss that organic sound but they have done a much better job with the programming this time around than on Gormandizing Rapture so it doesn’t bug me nearly as much as it did then, so well done improving on what I thought was one of the weakest points on the debut. Add the fact they got two wicked guest artists in both Lucas Mann and Misstiq (now that one did surprise me!) who brings a lot to the table on The Crowned Apocalypse as those songs stands out, changing the pace. Due to these songs though the first half of the album might be a bit all over the place because there are four tracks widely different from one another. One by one the songs kicks ass but I’m not entirely sure I enjoy them on an album as a concept yet but more like singles. However they get an A+ for bringing those two in and trying something new! When “The Butchers Shibboleth” then comes on order is restored as Carnal Abhorrence gets right back at it with their heavy hitting TBDM followed by “Ordained Octane” which switches it up some where the tempo-changes reigns high and mighty, giving some slam elements to it. That song quickly becomes my most played (together with the title track) as it’s instant gains time! “Cycles of Cybernetic De-Evolution” comes on next and it brings more of the same to the table, and damn do I love it when this duo go wild and crazy like this. This is playing to their strengths for sure. Rest of the album just kicks my ass as now I am certain the band should actually stick to their guns because the second half of the album is just a lot cleaner and hits me with a sledge hammer on every song. Nothing against Lucas Mann or Misstiq at all, since they did a good job, but I personally had a better time with The Crowned Apocalypse when the duo got to unleash chaos themselves. Probably because I am not that big of a fan of either Rings of Saturn nor Misstiq as it’s not something you see me listen to. Fans of either will, for obvious reasons, probably love those tracks a lot more than I did.\n\nAll in all Carnal Abhorrence has done a good job to just in a years time reach new levels of brutality. A massive improvement from the debut album and one of the best TBDM albums you will hear this year. Djirinn (the skinless muscular laboratory experiment that album is about) hasn’t quite managed to conquer the world yet with his army of undead but he is well on his way to do so. Bring in a drummer for the next release and maybe skip the guests all together (my personal opinion of course, many will probably disagree haha) and you got yourself an brutal death metal album of the year contender. Still The Crowned Apocalypse is an excellent album, there isn’t a single bad song on it and no one should skip this beauty. Oh and did I mention the album cover is a true work of art? Daemorph has outdone himself with this one in my opinion! Goes perfect with the concept album.\n\nArtist: Carnal Abhorrence\n\nLabel: Realityfade Records\n\nRelease date: November 27th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Ordained Octane\n\nFor fans of: Wormed & Cryptopsy\n\nScore: 4/5 Excellent\n\nCarnal Abhorrence\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CarnalAbhorrence\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/carnalabhorrence/\n\nRealityfade Records\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/realityfade\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/realityfaderecords/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realityfadeco\n\nhttps://www.realityfade.com/\n\nhttps://realityfade.bandcamp.com/\n\nAs we close in on the end of 2020 the album of the year list is slowly starting to come to mind more and more. 2020 being a very strange year due to the pandemic, bands calling it quits, no live shows (or at least hardly any) it has brought some good with it in terms of incredible music being put out that might have had to wait due to less time to write albums. Almost every month have had at least one album that I could see as an album of the year contender and it’s going to be hard to nail that top 50 down later on that’s for sure. September was a big death metal month for me personally where especially Proscription and Scordatura stood out. Note that I might have missed quite a few albums this time around, if so please comment, as I’ve been swarmed with work so not done my usual playlists to dig through all the new music like I usually do. As always, check out the playlist and be sure to follow it as well as look into all the bands you like!\n\nAlbum of the month\n\nWhat can I say, Maveth is one of the best death metal bands to have existed and Proscription continues that legacy with greatness. It doesn’t get much better than this. Read the review here.\n\nProscription – Conduit was released September 24th via Dark Descent Records.\n\nRunners-up\n\nMass Failure is Scordautra’s best work to date and one of the best brutal death metal albums of the year. Read the review here.\n\nScordatura – Mass Failure was released September 25th via Gore House Productions.\n\nWhen Feyen and Lambert does slam/brutal death together the stars align. Human Barbecue is one of the best bands going to mix said genres into a pot of gore.\n\nHuman Barbecue – Bloodstained Altars was released September 13th via Realityfade Records.\n\nSermon of Apathy is, by a mile, Desolator’s best album so far and while there is still some finishing touches to be done songs like “The Great Law of the Dead” and “Creatures of Habit” will be on every death metal fans playlist this year. Read the review here.\n\nDesolator – Sermon of Apathy was released September 4th via Black Lion Records.\n\nWhen it comes to post-black metal not many bands do it better than Russian act Second to Sun. Outstanding how they can release so many great albums in such a short time (four albums in three years) without losing any quality.\n\nSecond to Sun – Leviathan was released September 27th as an independent release.\n\nMore great music of September\n\nHvrt – The Grief That Feeds the Night\n\nDynfari – Myrkurs er þörf\n\nUada – Djinn\n\nMysthicon – Silvia – Oculis – Corvi\n\nDwarrowdelf – Evenstar\n\nMorta Skuld – Suffer For Nothing\n\nTheotoxin – Fragment: Erhabenheit\n\nOssuary Anex – Obscurantism Apogee\n\nVous Autres – Sel de Pierre\n\nVoid Rot – Descending Pillars\n\nFumigation – R0 5.7\n\nAcross the Swarm – Projections\n\nMadrost – Charring the Rotting Earth\n\nHiidenhauta – Riivin\n\nSlit Your Gots – Dogmatic Convictions of Human Decrepitude\n\nContagium – Chronicles of Carnage\n\nJust Before Dawn – An Army at Dawn\n\nVaginal Anomalies – Violent Devotion to Kill\n\nSoulwound – The Suffering\n\nAngelic Desolation – Quorum of Unspeakable Curses\n\nEshtadur – From the Abyss\n\nThorn – The Encompassing Nothing\n\nNoumena – Anima\n\nSadistic Embodiment – Blood Spell\n\nFires in the Distance – Echoes From Deep November\n\nJupiterian – Protosapien\n\nVacant Eyes – A Somber Preclusion of Being\n\nSpectrum of Delusion – Neoconception\n\nThe Last Reign – Evolution\n\nEerie – End of an Era\n\nAborted Fetus – Pyramids Of Damnation\n\nHorde of Hel – Döden Nalkas\n\nHanger Abortion – Population Decay\n\nEvaporated Sores – Ulcerous Dimensions\n\nFinsternis – The Old Tongue\n\nI’ve had the chance to follow and review Oncology since their debut Infinite Regress (read the review here), actually one of the very few bands I have managed to do so with. Even with troubles in the line-up and a rather big change in sound the band keeps on pushing themselves harder, finding their own groove and identity. They recently put out Omniversal Antigenesis (read the review here) which is a killer brutal death metal album. You can read the interview with the founder and last standing original member Alexander Connor Brown bellow!\n\nOncology is probably a new name to many of the readers. Please introduce yourselves, who does what in Oncology and what’s the band all about?\n\nFirstly, thanks for the interview, I really appreciate it. Oncology in 2020 consists of Geoff on vocals, myself, Connor on guitar and Doru on drums. Frank who was on tour with us in January in 2020 on bass has decided to take a step back from the band for personal issues. However, it was us 3 that recorded the album and that’s how we stand currently today.\n\nAt the start you had quite turbulent times with members, especially before the debut album Infinite Regress. What made it hard to find the right members for the band?\n\nDedication. People have a romantic view of being in a band and generally when it comes to the real graft in things, it normally sorts the wheat from the chaff. Its hard work and it takes up considerable amount of your free time in your days but that’s what it takes. Needs must to get the job done. Also, the usual things like musical ability or indeed a mutual love of the same kinda death metal. One of those factors normally lol.\n\nOn Infinite Regress you used drum programming instead of a live drummer. Was this decision made due to the hardships of finding members?\n\nWe did yes, purely because we wanted to write faster songs and not be limited by speed which was a limitation we had in a former band. At the time, in our area, there was no one who could play the speeds we wanted to achieve so we had to go the programmed route. With “Infinite Regress” and “The Metastasis”, the drums were written first, which is a different way of writing all together to what we were used to previously but it makes you think abit differently.\n\nYou’re the last remaining member from the original Oncology lineup Connor, did you create the band from the start too?\n\nI am, yes, and yes, the band was formed by myself and Aaron, who as you know is no longer in the band but we started mashing up ideas somewhere around mid 2013 as we recorded the last album of a previous band we were in. I was heavily into drum programming around here too, starting on an Alesis – SR-16, then to Fruity Loops , which Roger Beaujard from Mortician was using at the time and gave online tutorials on it, so those helped me a lot , more so to familiarise with sequencing. By the time I discovered Toontracks, EZ Drummer that was a god send hahaha. With this, we were able to write much faster songs than our previous band but we always wished we had someone who could play it.\n\nYou’ve been working with the German label Rising Nemesis Records since the start, how did that partnership happen?\n\nYeah we have hahaha It started that old fashioned way of sticking a cd and info sheet in post and sending it to the label and Nasar replied and the rest as they say is history. Although , its worth mentioning that this record is a joint release of Rising Nemesis Records and Sevared Records, which is cool cause I’ve met Barrett in the states way back and he has released my previous bands material so its real cool that’s its joint effort.\n\nThe new album Omniversal Antigenesis recently came out, has the reception been as you’ve hoped?\n\nIts been more than we have could hoped for and people seem to dig the album to which we’re truly grateful for. Theres always doubts and hestitations along the way and those were blasted away when we saw the positive feedback so that’s really cool.\n\nDoru Florin joined the band as your new drummer and his impact was great for Omniversal Antigenesis. How did you find out about him and get to work together seeing he is from Romania and the rest of Oncology is from the UK?\n\nYeah man! Doru is the man! Doru actually got in touch with us. We were looking for a drummer via Facebook and he sent us a message. Doru jammed the songs in Romania to click track and prepared a selection of songs, jumped on a plane and came to Northern Ireland and stayed for a few days and we rehearsed. Every time we have a show we usually meet up a day or two beforehand to have some rehearsals. Also, Doru sends videos of him playing the songs which is really cool to jam to at home. As you know, we toured over in Romania in January so it was really ace to see his homeland as he has been over our way plenty.\n\nSpeaking of Omniversal Antigenesis, there seems to be a red line on the concept for the album. Can you tell me more about it?\n\nWell, conceptually, the entire album is about destruction of everything , the end, not just the earth, of everything. Everything that man has ever known. Deleted, gone, we fucked it, game over, the uncreation. The title is to encapsulate that vibe. The end of all. The cover art, whilst some think its zombies, they’re not, its when the nukes fall and the skin is literally blasted from the body.\n\nIn my opinion your new album has taken Oncology to new heights. You’re more experienced and not only that, you use more elements such as slam in your music now too. While I still think the Suffocation vibes I got a lot of in the first album is still there I now hear bits and pieces from many other influences, you’re creating your own more unique sound this way. How was the process when writing the album and is it just me thinking you’ve taken a big leap, trying out new things on this album or was it intentional?\n\nThanks very much, that’s a huge compliment. Oncology always was influenced by Suffocation and Disavowed in the beginning and those influences are still there but there’s definitely abit more, I dunno, groove on this? Most of my riffs are influenced by some cool part I’ve heard in a band I love and I’ve tried to recreate that vibe that struck me by that part or riff. Folk have said they hear Nile, Morbid Angel, Vader, Hate Eternal, hell, even Origin in the music which is really cool. Music is open for interpretation and if they get that from these songs – then far out man, that’s cool. The album clocks in around just shy of 30 mins and whilst not being a concept album, is written to be listened as a whole piece and I kinda think we’ve achieved that.\n\nWhen Corvid-19 is over and live shows starts happening again I take it you will try to set up something for the new album. Any favorite tour package you would love to have Oncology a part of?\n\nYeah hopefully, everything is kinda up in the air right now. Were supposed to be going to Russia in Feb 2021 and London in July but we just gotta wait and see what happens. Its fucked up out there and these are very strange times but we definitely want to get out and play shows in support of “Omniversal Antigenesis” Id love to play a show or two with Internal Bleeding not purely for fan boy reasons but so the solo of “Transdimensional….” Can happen and Chris Pervelis can do a walk on solo. Hahahah would be well cool 🙂 But on the whole, it’ll just be cool to get out and play some shows.\n\nLast but not least I want to ask you if anyone in Oncology is a gamer. If so what are you playing now and what’s your favorite game of all time?\n\nGeoff is definitely the gamer of the band and he got his pc upgraded for playing games such as Doom Eternal, which we’ve all been rockin’, All the many Doom Mods, Postal 2 and Dusk. As for my fav games definitely gotta be one of the Doom Games or for me, old Wolfenstein. Hard to pick as I could sit all day talking about old games lol.\n\nThat’s all from me, thanks for taking your time and great work on both your albums! Oncology is a solid band that I’m sure will just continue to grow.\n\nMany thanks for the interview mate and thanks for the review. Anyone keen to hear our new album, “OMNIVERSAL ANTIGENESIS” can do so on their favourite streaming platform. Much appreciated, cheers.\n\nOncology\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OncologyBand\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/oncologydeathmetal\n\nhttps://oncology.bandcamp.com/\n\nAfter numerous of reviews here at The Metal Gamer from Realityfade and Vicious Instinct I finally got around to do my very first label interview! Who would be a better guy to interview than Dimitri Sagaidak, the owner of both labels and who have built Realityfade to a extreme metal powerhouse in just five years. I just had to pick his brain!\n\nWhat made you decide to start a record label Dimitri?\n\nHello, Jimmy and the Metal Gamer readers! Since I can remember my love for the Death Metal genre started, I not only liked to follow the bands but the labels that produced all the albums I liked. It was all so interesting to me and I loved to read all the news and check the releases these companies were putting out. In 2015, without any prior experience or knowledge, I went to try the craft for myself and dived into this business full of enthusiasm and excitement. The reason is that I just wanted to do something in the scene I loved. Since I don’t play any instruments I decided to try myself at running a label.\n\nThe first release I am sure was a learning experience. What was the number one thing you took away from the release that’s been with you ever since?\n\nThe first 2 releases Abhorrent Aggression ‘You Only Die Once’ and Reprobation ‘One Final Autopsy’ were worked on and released simultaneously early summer 2016. Just from these two, I’ve learned a lot of things, such as, for example, that you should never release something without a proper promotional campaign 🙂\n\nEvery release for me is trial and error and I still learn every day. Sadly they don’t teach this in uni or online.\n\nA few wise points that I’d like to share are promotion (never stop the promotion), distribution (distribute to as many shops and labels as possible), and money (don’t be afraid to spend some if you want to make a good product).\n\nHave you ever thought of getting your own hardware in order to press albums, castes, LP, or other merch yourselves?\n\nQuite a surprising question but yeah I did actually! I’ve had the idea to buy my own screen printing equipment many times. Though after contemplating and researching I found it to be unreasonable. It would have required to print clothing for other bands, labels, and customers out of the music scene which in turn would require additional space and team to run this as a completely separate business. This would ruin the purpose of running a label for me but I do know a local label who does exactly that and we work with them on most of our merch orders.\n\nRealityfade has grown a lot during the years and seems to have always stuck to the profile with slam, brutal death metal and deathcore. Was this a choice from the start or did it just happen along the way?\n\nInitially, Realityfade was not meant to become a serious business as it is now. I wanted to make a few releases to support a more old-school type of Death Metal with no clear plan after that. All the music that was released after just came naturally. I do try to keep the level of sonic extremity high but there are no clear boundaries for genres.\n\nYou bought Australian label Vicious Instinct Records two years ago. Known for having had bands like Vulvodynia, Whoretopsy and Internal Devour. What was the decision behind that takeover and how did the deal go down?\n\nPrior to the acquisition, we’ve been actively communicating with ex-owner Matt Turkington, sharing our experience with bands, doing distribution deals, and discussing our day-to-day running of the label. One day out of nowhere I asked Matt how much he would sell his label if such a possibility would appear. This was the first step in that direction, a question asked just for fun resulted in me becoming Matt’s assistant for some time until we arranged a full transition.\n\nAt first, when I noticed the communication went into a serious direction, I didn’t think much, I just loved the idea of getting another label who worked with some strong names in the underground scene. Now I have a much clearer vision of VI’s direction.\n\nDo you work full-time with Realityfade and Vicious Instinct or do you have a job on the side?\n\nWhen I stepped in Vicious Instinct I immediately started working and released 3 very solid Deathcore releases. After a short pause with the label, I started to grind like a madman to make VI as awesome as Realityfade. Both labels take a huge chunk of my time and music is my full-time job now.\n\nWhich release has done best so far in terms of sales for Realityfade? Has there been any release you think did a lot worse than you thought it would have?\n\nFor the past 2 years, I’d say all releases went similarly well. I do have to point out that all 2020 releases went even better. I think that the underground community (and especially bands) should understand that the release goes as well as the label and the band managed to push it. I’ve seen people release crappy music which got a lot of praise and do well in sales, and I’ve seen outstanding music wither. All because of promotion or the lack of it.\n\nIt is very hard for an indie label to push its music when you have to compete not only with many other bands and labels, big or small but also with other types of media such as video-games, movies. I think most if not all RF releases deserve to be loved more and the bands should have bigger audiences, but that’s just the thing of promotional capability.\n\nHas there ever been a band you could have signed but never managed to for one reason or another and regret today?\n\nThe most memorable would be Molested Divinity. At the time the label and the band were just starting out. There was no telling if MD would grow big or stay a studio project and we, as a business, were cautious about putting investments into bands like that. We almost had them but the stars didn’t align 🙂\n\nIs there a dream signing for Realityfade? Doesn’t matter how big it is.\n\nI wouldn’t say there is any particular band that I’d like to work with. What interests me more are bands which have already established themselves, bands whose music I like, and bands that have a release or two behind their backs. I still like to get new bands but I rather prefer those who already proved to be serious about what they do, capable of creating great music and growing their fanbase. Sometimes, new bands don’t take their craft seriously, and a label can waste money and more importantly TIME growing and promoting them. In the end they can just split-up or go elsewhere, that doesn’t motivate me.\n\nHave you ever thought of having a Realityfade festival or tour package with Realityfade bands?\n\nOh yeah we did! This is something that I’ve been dreaming to do for quite a while, and got a few offers too. If the future is bright we might do a Realityfade tour next year featuring a lineup of RF’s Euro bands. That’d be just legendary.\n\nYou’re a gamer and a collector like me. Which shows in your new collector’s boxes which has trading cards in them and comes in a nice DVD package with other cool stuff. What made you come up with the idea?\n\nA company called Limited Run Games. When I saw how they treat their game releases I immediately came up with the ‘collector’s edition’ idea for our current release at the time Esophagus ‘Defeated By Their Inferiority’. This is still pretty new for us but people love these editions and they always sell like hotcakes haha.\n\nAs a fellow gamer I have to ask, what do you play now and what’s your favorite game of all time?\n\nOooh, nice question. Like yourself, I’m a huge video-game fan. My very favorite game would be Thief: The Dark Project, so many fun memories and good times with it. Besides the amazing story campaign and 2 awesome sequels, it has a ton of fan-made missions which could make you play it for years.\n\nI also like these franchises a LOT: GTA (with 3’d and Vice City being the best), original Hitman Series, Prince Of Persia Sand Trilogy, Max Payne Trilogy, The Elder Scrolls Series, Gothic Trilogy, Assassin’s Creed, new Batman games, Zelda Series, Castlevania Series. The past few years I’ve been trying to catch up on all the console goodness I missed or haven’t played since I was a kid. I just beat Zelda: The Minish Cap for the Gameboy Advance and currently getting through the Castlevania Circle of the Moon also on GBA, it is such an amazing game!\n\nFinal words:\n\nThank you, Jimmy and The Metal Gamer for the opportunity to talk about Realityfade and Vicious Instinct. Thanks to everyone for reading.

Being an international band (Spain, New Zealand and USA) with members from Putreseminal Viscosity, Face of Oblivion, Acanthostega and even Chalice of Suffering you have a very, and I mean very, varied range of genres mixed in what became Laceratory. That’s not even half the bands the members have been a part of at one point or another but already you have brutal death metal, black metal and funeral doom metal fused together, now this is interesting!\n\nThe opener “Bathed in Entrails” from the get go unleashes some seriously vile vocals from John McGovern which took me by surprise. Honestly at first I thought it was in a bad way, as I’ve not actually heard these kind of gut wrenching sounds before but after a while I get rather used to it and think it’s one of Laceratory’s selling points. Laceratory have some crazy vocals that stand out (might be an hate or love relationship though mind you) but other than that I don’t think this is anything but an average display I’m afraid. Sorry but the drums doesn’t sound organic or fluid at all half of the time, I almost get the feeling it’s drum programming on some songs even. Seeing I know Eric Baumgard has done some nice work in both Face of Oblivion and Glutton for Punishment I’m actually surprised by this performance, I expected a lot more. Add a mix that I don’t think do the album any favors at all and sadly those two things ruin a lot of my time with Laceratory. The guitars have some sick riffs and a heavy guitar tone but are bit too inconsistent (or more like in the shadows) to bring it home. I guess sometimes getting a mix of genres together in a blender to create slam/brutal death metal just becomes a bit subpar compared to veterans of the scene.\n\nThere are some highlights that saves the album from the lower spectrum of the scoreboard though, “Extermination of the Dissidents”, “King of the Maggots” and “Peripheral Slaughter” are definitely songs I will add to my brutal workout playlist but that’s about it. Has to be said that the second half of the album does sound better than the first as until “King of the Maggots” came on I was almost ready to call it quits on my first listen as I only really enjoyed “Extermination of the Dissidents” before that. Less than half a good album doesn’t cut it though when I’ve heard of the best brutal death metal of the year these past weeks.\n\nLaceratory do have some tricks up their sleeve that can maybe make them a a quality stand out brutal death metal band, however the debut shows way too little of that. A very mixed bag that I can only recommend to hardcore followers of the genre who always got that itch for new music.\n\nWritten by J.B.\n\nArtist: Laceratory\n\nLabel: Coyote Records\n\nRelease date: August 1st, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Extermination of the Dissidents\n\nFor fans of: Epicardiectomy & Prostitute Disfigurement\n\nScore: 2.5/5 Decent\n\nLaceratory\n\nhttp://www.laceratory.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Laceratory/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/laceratory_brutal/\n\nCoyote Records\n\nhttp://coyoterecords.ru/\n\nhttps://coyoterecords.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://coyoterecords.bigcartel.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/coyoterecords666"
