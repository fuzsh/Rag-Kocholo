        "text": "Look Away\n\nChicago - Look Away (Official Music Video)\n\nReleased in 1988, this ended up being Chicago's best-selling single and topped the US charts.\n\nIt proved to be their biggest hit since lead singer Peter Cetera left the band.\n\nDoes Anybody Really Know What Time it is?\n\nChicago - Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is? - 7/21/1970 - Tanglewood (Official)\n\nThis jazz fusion track appeared on Chicago's very first album back in 1969.\n\nSongwriter Robert Lamm said of the song: \"[It's] not a complicated song, but it’s certainly a quirky song. But that was my intent.\n\n\"I wanted to write something that wasn’t ordinary, that wasn’t blues-based, that didn’t have ice cream changes, and would allow the horns to shine and give Lee Loughnane a solo. So all that was the intent.\"\n\n25 or 6 to 4\n\nChicago - 25 or 6 to 4 - 7/21/1970 - Tanglewood (Official)\n\nOne of their earliest songs, it was released in 1970, and reached the top 10 in both the US and UK.\n\nWriter Robert Lamm said that it is about trying to write a song in the middle of the night. The song's title is the time at which the song is set: 25 or 26 minutes before 4am. Over the years, it has been incorrectly speculated to be a reference to drugs.\n\nThe Next Time I Fall (with Amy Grant)\n\nPETER CETERA & AMY GRANT - The Next Time I Fall\n\nPeter Cetera teamed up with Amy Grant for this fantastic solo duet, giving him a number one single in the States.\n\nThe song was originally intended for Chicago, with co-writer Bobby Caldwell saying: \"We had his voice in mind, but Paul and I were unaware that he was leaving Chicago at that time, and when we heard the news our hopes were dashed.\n\n\"However, a short time later, I got a call at home from Cetera himself who stumbled upon our demo cassette tape of the song in producer/arranger David Foster's office. He loved the tune and wanted to record it as a duet.\"\n\nStreet Player\n\nStreet Player (2003 Remaster)\n\nThis funk track from 1979 was originally recorded by singer Rufus, before Chicago released their own version.\n\nIt would later be heavily sampled in the 1995 dance hit single 'The Bomb! (These Sounds Fall Into My Mind)' by The Bucketheads.\n\nYou're the Inspiration\n\nChicago - You're the Inspiration (Official Music Video)\n\nReleased in 1984, this song gave Chicago a top 3 hit in the States, but only reached 14 in the UK.\n\nCetera later revealed the song was originally intended for Kenny Rogers, but he eventually passed on it, so he took it for Chicago instead.\n\nHard Habit to Break\n\nChicago - Hard Habit To Break (Official Music Video)\n\nThis song sees the singer realise that they've been taking their partner for granted for years, and want to make up for it.\n\nIn an intriguing move, it uses two very different voices from the band: Peter Cetera sings most of the verses, while Bill Champlin provides the chorus (\"I'm addicted to you baby!\").\n\nGlory of Love\n\npeter cetera - glory of love (Video Official) HD\n\nThis Peter Cetera solo track was co-written with longtime Chicago collaborator David Foster.\n\nIt was written for the soundtrack to The Karate Kid II, and was a huge hit - reaching number one in the States.\n\nIf You Leave Me Now\n\nChicago - If you leave me now - 1977 (HQ)\n\nThis was the song that brought Chicago to a truly mainstream audience, reaching the top spot in the UK and US in 1976.\n\nIt remains one of the best break-up ballads of all time, and surprisingly doesn't actually contain a traditional chorus.\n\nHard to Say I'm Sorry\n\nChicago - Hard To Say I'm Sorry (Official Music Video)\n\nThis 1982 power ballad was a number one hit in the US, and reached the top five in the UK. It actually features three members of Toto, including Steve Lukather on guitar and David Paich and Steve Porcaro on synthesizers.\n\nThe full-length version is over five minutes long and segues into an upbeat song called 'Get Away'."
