        "text": "Hip-hop music during the 1990s is often considered the golden era for the genre. One of the core reasons hip-hop was so potent as a dance floor filler is due to its catchy beats and infectious rhythms.\n\nMany of the key tracks from that era had chunky basslines and groovy drum patterns, which made it easy for B-Boys and B-Girls to really get loose. In addition, the 1990s saw the rise of popular dance styles like breakdancing and krumping.\n\nWest Coast hip-hop which was heavily inspired by 70s funk easily translated to fun, dance-floor material. Hip-hop’s unique way of telling stories while blending catchy hooks, samples, and funk-inspired beats made it very popular in clubs and bedrooms alike.Â\n\nHere are a few of our favoutite hip hop dance floors bangers!\n\nThe Humpty Dance – Digital Underground (1990)\n\nMore fun and colourful West Coast hip hop courtesy of the late great Shock G and Digital Underground. In 2008, The Humpty Dance was ranked No. 30 on VH1’s 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop and No. 65 on VH1’s 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s in 2007.\n\nJump – Kris Kross (1992)\n\nAmerican duo Kriss Krossâ first single became an instant hit thanks largely to the then-new producer on the block Jermaine Dupri. The production features a mix of funky samples and uptempo drum programming, and the very young duo’s energetic delivery and rhymes about partying and having fun.\n\nCan I Kick It? – A Tribe Called Quest (1990)\n\nYes you can, and thankfully they did so for a long time. To create this hip-hop masterpiece, the trio combined elements of Lou Reed’s Walk on the Wild Side, Ian Dury’s What A Waste, rap, and classic seventies funk. In 2022, Pitchfork ranked it at number 25 in their 250 Best Songs of the 1990s.\n\nFeel free, drop your pants, check your hair\n\nDo you like the garments that we wear?\n\nI instruct you to be the obeyer\n\nA rhythm recipe that you’ll savor\n\nHip Hop Hooray – Naughty by Nature (1993)\n\nTreach, Vinnie and DJ Kay Gee crafted this party favourite and ode to hip hop together thanks to a long list of samples including Peter Gabrielâs Sledgehammer. The song spent one week at number one on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nNuthin’ But A G Thang – Dr. Dre feat. Snoop Dogg (1992)\n\nOne of the first but certainly not the last collaboration between these two ex-Death Row hip hop gangstas, this G-Funk staple featured on the mythical LP The Chronic. The song was selected by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 500 songs that shaped rock and roll. Nuff said!\n\nWell, I’m peepin’, and I’m creepin’, and I’m creepin’\n\nBut I damn near got caught, ’cause my beeper kept beepin’\n\nNow, it’s time for me to make my impression felt\n\nSo, sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt.\n\nGin and Juice – Snoop Doggy Dogg (1994)\n\nNot to be outdone, The Doggfather soon released his own G-Funk classic via his ground-breaking debut, Doggystyle. For those invested in more debauched party-related antics including drugs, sex and 40s this song is totally for you.\n\nJump Around – House of Pain (1992)\n\nPack it up, pack it in, let me begin. Produced by DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill, this was the first single from the House of Painâs debut album. The song reached number three in the United States and still has the whole world jumping.\n\nInsane In The Brain – Cypress Hill (1993)\n\nDJ Muggs, Sen Dog and B-Real were very much sane when they concocted this gang-related banger. The track struck number one on the US rap chart, the song also was a mainstream hit, reaching number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1993.\n\nLike Louie Armstrong, played the trumpet\n\nI’ll hit that bong and break you off something\n\nSoon I got to get my props\n\nCops, come and try to snatch my crops\n\nThese pigs wanna blow my house down\n\nHead underground to the next town\n\nU Can’t Touch This – MC Hammer (1990)\n\nThis fun track is easily considered MC Hammerâs signature song and it was the first rap song to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Record of the Year at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards in 1991. Tell me youâve never tried the Hammer dance!\n\nIce Ice Baby – Vanilla Ice (1990)\n\nJust as impactful as Mr Hammer, Mr Ice became a 90s cultural icon just off the back of this track. Amongst a list of accomplishments, the track was the first hip-hop single to top the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nWhoomp! (There It Is) – Tag Team (1993)\n\nWhoomp! (There It Is) catapulted the Miami bass sound into the minds of people all around the world. The track has remained popular to this day thanks in part to multiple placements in film, television, and advertisements.\n\nRump Shaker – Wreckx-N-Effect (1992)\n\nTeddy Riley and all his machinations often danced between hip hop, new jack swing and R&B but this was straight silky hip hop. A beach romp call to action that many have answered over the decades.\n\nTurn to seduction from face hips to feet\n\nA wiggle and a jiggle can make the night complete\n\nNow since you got the body of the year, come and get the award\n\nHere’s a hint, it’s like a long sharp sword.\n\nSummertime – DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince (1991)\n\nSummertime won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 1992 Grammy Awards. Whether youâre in Philly or Australia, the track is still great for a warm, chilled afternoon with friends and beers.\n\nHypnotize – The Notorious B.I.G. (1997)\n\nFeaturing some of the slickest lyrics ever penned on a club track, baby baaaby! Rolling Stone ranked the song as number 30 on their list of the 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time.\n\nIntergalactic – Beastie Boys (1998)\n\nIntergalactic was released as the first single from their fifth studio album, Hello Nasty. On top of being a perfect example of Beastie brilliance, the accompanying music video was super entertaining parody of Japanese Kaiju films.\n\nScenario – A Tribe Called Quest (1992)\n\nTime included the song on the list of its All-TIME 100 Songs. The track is often considered a key moment for Leaders of the New School member Busta Rhymes, who was 19 when this song was released. The music video features cameos by Kid Capri, Spike Lee, Brand Nubian, De La Soul, Fab Five Freddy, and Redman.\n\nNo holds barred, no time for move-fakin’\n\nGots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon\n\nBrothers front, they say the Tribe can’t flow\n\nBut we’ve been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so.\n\nWho Ride Wit Us â Kurupt feat. Daz Dillinger (1999)\n\nAmerican West Coast beats donât get much heavier than this! This was one of many tracks produced by Fred Wreck taken from Kuruptâs explosive second solo album Tha Streetz Iz A Mutha.\n\nJuicy – The Notorious B.I.G. (1994)\n\nBiggieâs first single is still considered to be one of the greatest hip-hop songs ever produced. With timeless rags-to-riches lyrics, this track was juicy in name and sound.\n\nDoo Wop (That Thing) â Lauryn Hill (1998)\n\nDoo Wop (That Thing) became L. Boogieâs first and only US Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit while earning her multiple awards including two Grammys. It also became the first US number-one written, produced and recorded by one sole woman since Debbie Gibson’s Lost in Your Eyes (1989).\n\nDe La Soul – Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey) (1991)\n\nHere De La Soul showcase their left side, jazzy hip hop style on a party jam about overzealous fans pursuing them to pass on demo tapes. The song was a top 10 hit in various spots including Germany, Belgium, Australia, Austria, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the UK.\n\nOnce again it’s another rap bandit\n\nFiending at I and I can’t stand it\n\nWanna be down with the Day-Glo\n\nKnocking on my door, saying, “a yo yo”\n\nCalifornia Love – 2Pac feat. Dr. Dre (1995)\n\nThe song was released as 2Pac’s comeback single after his release from prison in 1995 and was his first single as the newest artist of Death Row Records. Also featuring vocals from legendary funk artists Roger Troutman, the track was a pure celebration of west coast fun and sun.\n\nPhenomenon â LL Cool J (1997)\n\nPhenomenon was the first single released from his seventh studio album of the same name. A killer bass groove and composition drawn from various samples drove this quintessential LL joint.\n\nRosa Parks – Outkast (1998)\n\nInspired by civil rights activist Rosa Parks (despite her suing the group over the name), this is widely considered one of Outkast’s best songs and a great example of the groupâs unique southern hip-hop roots.\n\nAh-ha, hush that fuss\n\nEverybody move to the back of the bus\n\nDo you wanna bump and slump wit’ us?\n\nWe the type of people make the club get crunk\n\nIt’s Like That – Run-DMC vs. Jason Nevins (1997)\n\nIt’s Like That was Run-DMCâs debut single released in 1983 by Profile Records. The Nevins version blurred the lines seamlessly between rap and dance music. In the UK, it became Britain’s third biggest-selling single of 1998.\n\nI Got 5 On It â Luniz (1995)\n\nNumskull and Yukmouth delivered this weed-smoking along with vocalist Michael Marshall. The single was certified Platinum by the RIAA on October 31, 1995 and sold one million copies domestically.\n\nDrop – The Pharcyde (1995)\n\nDrop is still memorable not just because of its trippy film clip but also due to its crisp production from the legendary J. Dilla. The track was released in 1995 as the second single for the group’s second album, Labcabincalifornia.\n\nDonât Sweat The Techinque â Eric B & Rakim (1992)\n\nRakim is still considered one of if not the GOAT and here heâs in fine form alongside his soon-to-be-absent partner in rhyme Eric B. Rakimâs lyrics soar like arrows over Eric B.’s jazzy, soulful production. Does anybody else remember hearing this on the NBA Jam Session VHS? Anybody?\n\nClassical too intelligent to be radical\n\nMasterful, never irrelevant mathematical\n\nHere’s some soothing souvenirs for all the years\n\nThey fought and sought, the thoughts and ideas\n\nIt’s cool when you freak to the beat\n\nBut don’t sweat the technique.\n\nHow Do You Want It â 2pac feat. KC & Jo Jo (1996)\n\nThis was one of several slick dance floor fillers from 2pacâs historic All Eyez On Me double LP. It was released on June 4, 1996 as a double a-sided single with California Love from the same album and was sadly his final single to be released during his lifetime.\n\nCold Rock a Party – MC Lyte (1996)\n\nThis club banger was originally produced by Rashad Smith and sampled Audio Two’s Top Billinâ, however, the single version featured Missy Elliott and was produced by Sean Combs who sampled Diana Ross’ 1980 hit Upside Down.\n\nRuff Ryders’ Anthem â DMX (1998)\n\nThis track brought Swizz Beatz and the Ruff Ryders crew into the spotlight. Its vocals and beat follow the rhythm of a military march that many hip-hop heads are still marching along to (even after DMXâs untimely death in 2021).\n\nSimon Says – Pharoahe Monch (1999)\n\nAs epic as the sample (taken from the 1964 film Mothra vs. Godzilla), Simon Says was Pharoahe Monchâs debut single. With grumbling horns and a tonne of head nodding, this classic could be heard in underground hip-hop dens as well as massive music festivals.\n\nShimmy Shimmy Ya â Olâ Dirty Bastard (1995)\n\nODBâs unmistakable rhyme style is placed in full view on this RZA-produced hip-hop anthem. It was the second single released from the album Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version.\n\nChop that down, pass it all around\n\nLyrics get hard quick cement to the ground\n\nFor any emcee in any fifty-two states\n\nI get psycho killer, Norman Bates.\n\nWoo Hah! Got You All In Check – Busta Rhymes (1996)\n\nBustaâs debut single was a critical and commercial success showcasing his trademark manic delivery. The song peaked at number 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and also peaked at the same spot in New Zealand and the UK.\n\nIn California â Daz Dillinger (1998)\n\nAnother ode to LAâs sun-filled city, Daz joined Lady “V” on this Soopafly-produced track. From the album Retaliation, Revenge, And Get Back the song bangs harder than a million gang bangersâ shotties.\n\nBig Momma Thang â Lil Kim (1996)\n\nTaken from Lilâ Kimâs album Hardcore te track featured rappers Jay-Z andLil’ Cease. An incredible gooey funk-driven beat drawn from Sylvesterâs Was It Something I Said? and laced with Lil Kimâs trademark racy bars.\n\nI used to be scared of the dick\n\nNow I throw lips to the shit\n\nHandle it like a real bitch\n\nHeather Hunter, Janet Jack-me\n\nTake it in the butt, yah, yazz wha.\n\nO.P.P. â Naughty By Nature (1991)\n\nO.P.P. AKA âother people’s Pâ¦â was one of the first hip-hop songs to become a commercial success when it hit No. 6 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 35 on the UK Singles Chart. The track showed the wonderful early chemistry between MCs Vin Rock and Treach.\n\nGot Ya Money – Olâ Dirty Bastard feat Kelis (1999)\n\nThe song was produced by the Neptunes and was R&B singer Kelisâ first appearance on a record. Pitchfork Media included the video on its list of the Top 50 Music Videos of the 1990s.\n\n1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpinâ New) (Timber Mix) – Coolio (1996)\n\nCoolio reached the top 10 in several countries, including France, Iceland, the United States, and New Zealand, thanks to this track. Thumping bass and sharp rhymes from the late great MC were quite a contrast to his previous singles.\n\nIt Was A Good Day – Ice Cube (1992)\n\nSomething more laid back and chill from Ice Cube, this track drew a narrative from the flip side of gang life in LA. In 2008, it was ranked #28 on VH1’s 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.\n\nDrunk as hell, but no throwin’ up\n\nHalfway home, and my pager’s still blowin’ up\n\nToday, I didn’t even have to use my AK\n\nI gotta say it was a good day, shit!\n\nGhetto Supastar (That Is What You Are) – Pras Michel feat. Ol’ Dirty Bastard & MÃ½a (1998)\n\nA delightful blend of R&B and hip hop, this track featured on Prasâ (The Fugees) debut album as well as the Bullworth soundtrack. The track was a critical and commercial success worldwide, peaking at number two in the UK, Sweden, and Australia.\n\nThe Next Episode – Dr. Dre feat. Snoop Dogg (1999)\n\nWho could mistake the opening notes from this follow-up to Dre and Snoopâs 1993 hit Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang. The beat behind the track featured Dr. Dreâs signature style along with additional input from fellow Aftermath producer Mel-Man.\n\nTennessee – Arrested Development (1992)\n\nTennessee won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1993. Group member Speech wrote the song about the experience of losing two loved ones so close together.\n\nRegulate – Warren G feat. Nate Dogg (1994)\n\nThe prototype G-Funk track was an MTV staple and featured on Warren Gâs Regulate… G Funk Era and on the Above the Rim soundtrack. Here, Warren G and Nate Dogg trade verses on a track about a series of ghetto misadventures.\n\n16 in the clip and one in the hole\n\nNate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold\n\nNow they droppin’ and yellin’, it’s a tad bit late\n\nNate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate.\n\nI Wish – Skee-Lo (1995)\n\nA rather sad, lamenting song in many ways but relatable in many too. The track charted well in several countries including the UK, Norway, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, and New Zealand.\n\nFu-Gee-La â Fugees (1995)\n\nPras, Lauryn and Clef went platinum thanks to this jam produced by Salaam Remi. Fu-Gee-La was the lead single from their critically acclaimed album, The Score.\n\nStill Not a Player â Big Punisher feat. Joe (1998)\n\nBig Pun could do nothing wrong around the late 90s to early 2000s with club bangers, punchy lyrics and street bravado. Still Not a Player showed off a few things and people loved it.\n\nCheck Yo Self â Remix â Ice Cube feat. Das EFX (1993)\n\nSampling the epic beat from Grandmaster Flash’s The Message, Ice Cubeâs third single from the huge album The Predator still gets most parties started.\n\nProtect Ya Neck – Wu-Tang Clan (1992)\n\nWu-Tang is not just a hip-hop group, it is a movement and Protect Ya Neck was where it all started. Along with featuring in TV shows and video games, the song is still a true classic and those opening strings are guaranteed to set off any hip-hop head.\n\nDollaz & Sense â DJ Quik (1995)\n\nAlongside No Vaseline and Hit Em Up, this has to be one of the greatest dis records ever recorded. Quik even performed the song live during a Death Row medley at the controversial 1995 Source Awards.\n\nRemember Compton’s in the house, and Quik is in the hood\n\nSippin’ yak with all my niggaz ’cause it’s tooted good\n\nSo don’t knock it till you try it, ’cause Eiht he tried to knock it\n\nBut he’s still walkin’ round with my nuts in his pocket.\n\nMs Fat Booty â Mos Def (1999)\n\nReleased on August 2, 1999 through Rawkus Records, this would have to be Mos Defâs (later Yasiin Bey) most thumping dance floor track. The song’s sequel, Ms. Fat Booty 2 featuring Ghostface Killah was equally banging.\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\nThese other 90s hip-hop music tunes also had to get a little nod:\n\nSaturdays â De La Soul (1991)\n\nFull Clip â Gang Starr (1999)\n\nThe Game â Def Squad (1998)\n\nTime 4 Sumaksion â Redman (1993)\n\nLetâs Play House – Tha Dogg Pound (1995)\n\nSimon Says – Pharoahe Monch (1999)\n\nMe & My Crazy World – Lost Boyz (1997)\n\nVivrant Thing â Q-Tip (1999)\n\nDJ Shinski brings us a great mix of 1990s hip hop below:"
