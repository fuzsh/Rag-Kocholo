        "text": "World Terror Committee\n\nSerpent Noir – Death Clan OD Review\n\n“Hmmm… a Greek black metal band that sounds like Marduk, Gorgoroth, and Ofermod? Yeah, that oughta work. And this year’s Death Clan OD is only their third release. Well, this should be easy enough. *Five minutes into 2012’s Seeing Through the Shadow Consciousness (Open Up the Shells)* What in the hell was that?! *Five seconds into the 2015 follow-up, Erotomysticism* What in the fucking fuck?! So much for an easy, middle-of-the-road black metal release.” Clan wars.\n\nBarshasketh – Barshasketh Review\n\n“One of the saddest things in music is the “almost there” album. It’s the album that has all the traits of something that should work, and yet it doesn’t. It’s the kid on the soccer team who is bad, but not bad enough to know he’s bad. It’s the guy in the friend group who everyone tolerates, but no one would be sad if he moved away. It’s the hundreds of albums that are released every year, met with a shrug at best, and are swiftly forgotten.” That’s not ominous or anything.\n\nSargeist – Unbound [Things You Might Have Missed 2018]\n\n“Like many of you, I respect the hardworking artists of the underground. Guys with main bands, side-projects, and loads of guest appearances. Black metal, in particular, is a genre full of artists like this. Shatraug is one. To the casual Finnish black metal fan, Shatraug is the guitarist for the mighty Horna. To others, he’s the man behind Gandr, Mortualia, and Necroslut, as well as guitarist for Hoath and Doedsvangr. And that only scratches the surface. The other band you might know Shatraug from is Sargeist. And their newest release, Unbound, might be their best to date.” A man of 50 shades.\n\nShaarimoth – Temple of the Adversarial Fire Review\n\n“January isn’t known for being a break-out month for music. With Shaarimoth’s sole output being 2005’s Current 11, they return after a lengthy period of inactivity with Temple of the Adversarial Fire. Can their rituals hold up after a lengthy lay-off?” Everything has a return these days.\n\nAdaestuo – Tacent Semitae Review\n\n“As readers of Angry Metal Guy, y’all know what happens when a new black metal band throws itself at the teeming hordes while trying to remain anonymous. Guessing games ensue. Frantic-yet-fruitless searches begin on various websites. Unicorns mysteriously appear. Nine times out of ten, though, nothing new is really brought to the forefront of our collective psyche. In other words, anonymous rehashes can only go so far, and repaintings of the same ol’ Deathspell Omega portrait get old quickly.” The picture of Deathspellian Gray.\n\nTortorum – Rotten. Dead. Forgotten. Review\n\n“Bergen is a charming city located on the west coast of Norway. It’s Europe’s utopia, a haven from scum and villainy and home to wonderful landscapes, picturesque architecture, politeness, order, harmony, and BLACK METAL! Tortorum claim to be from Bergen although the two founding members of the band are from the UK and Poland. Despite this, the evilness that resonates from the name Bergen is undeniable. I’m shaking as I type this and I haven’t slept since I received the promo because I fear the terrors that Tortorum may summon. Rotten. Dead. Forgotten. is a mini-album straight from the demonic depths of Hell. Proceed, if you dare.” We warned you, but also dared you.\n\nKvltist – Catechesis Review\n\nLadies and germs, we have come to that time of year where we prepare for the holidays. Trees are cut down and decorated garishly, propped up in living rooms for approximately one month before being tossed aside or used as kindling in your fiery pits of Hades. But us writers? We’re putting together our lists, checking them twice, and solidifying them for all to see. Does German black metal duo Kvltist have the chops to usurp my solidified year-end collection of subjective metal importance with their debut, Catechesis?” Grymm has a list and he’s checking it thrice.\n\nHorna – Hengen Tulet Review\n\nThis post has been removed because it promoted Nazi or Nazi-adjacent metal bands or musicians. We apologize.\n\nAmestigon – Thier Review\n\n“Near the end of Disney’s Ratatouille there’s a climactic scene during which the harsh, scrupulous restaurant critic Anton Ego (personality modelled, clearly, after AMG’s staff) savours the best ratatouille he’s ever had. Overwhelmed by the tastes and flavors that transport him back to his childhood, he’s left altogether dumbfounded with his usual negativity utterly dismantled. In a way, that’s the effect Amestigon’s Their had on me.” Did he just compare us all to a rat?"
