        "text": "Featuring a member from a black metal band I often listen to (I listened to Endtime Divine the same day I write this) Setherial we have Swedish symphonic black metal duo Svartghast and their debut album Perdition. I had rather high hopes from this debut due to it being season musicians and it would seem it landed somewhat in between my hopes.\n\nSvartghast is definitely all about that old school vibe, think Emperor, Old Man’s Child, Limbonic Art and Dimmu Borgir having a lovechild then you’re close to the music the band offers. However here they hardly live up to at least the hype I had going for them. “Beyond the Veil of Mist” is a superb song, by far the best on the album, but the rest doesn’t quite reach those levels. “The Fall of the First” also offers some killer riffs and a nice change of pace on Perdition that stands out while “Luciferian Dawn” is a great closer. It’s a rather mixed bag of quality on the album as a whole though but with that said it doesn’t mean the rest of the album is bad, it’s simply just good but not good enough to make Perdition become an album I revisit in the future. One thing that took me some time to get used to was the vocals, which I at first had a really hard time enjoying thinking it held the album back. After a few listens I came to like it as it works well with the musics atmosphere. Fans of the symphonic black metal sound from the 90’s should give this a few spins though if your craving more from that school.\n\nArtist: Svartghast\n\nLabel: Dusktone\n\nRelease date: November 27th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Beyond the Veil of Mist\n\nFor fans of: Emperor & Old Man’s Child\n\nScore: 3/5 Good\n\nSvartghast\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/svartghast/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/svartghast/\n\nhttps://svartghast.se/\n\nDusktone\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dusktone\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dusktone\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dusktone/\n\nhttps://dusktone.bandcamp.com/\n\nWhen it comes to Finnish black metal Horna is a household name and probably the biggest black metal band the country have ever produced. Not only are they one of the oldest bands going but they have released a shitload of albums during the years, with most being of very high quality! While it wasn’t long ago we got some Horna music as they released a split with Pure two years ago, it’s been five years since their last full-length album Hengen Tulet which received some mixed criticism but was at it’s peaks a very good album. I personally think Hengen Tulet was one of the better albums they’ve produced and it was only the mix that was a bit off to my ears. That’s the funny thing with Horna though, they do switch it up a bit with many of their releases and you will see a lot of fans have different favorites when it comes to the bands discography. With Kuoleman Kirjo I hope we get more of that pure dark and evil black metal we all know Horna can do.\n\nWhen an album clocks in on over an hour long warning bells actually rings to me. Why? Simply due to the fact that’s a lot of time to keep ones interest going when it comes to music and it usually means fillers (which is why I loose interest). When it comes to Kuoleman Kirjo I have to say Horna does a great effort on giving the listener a varied enough album, where the riffs are actually some of the best I’ve heard on a Horna album, yet keeping the core sound intact throughout the album and you sit there slowly headbanging from start to finish. No fillers here folks! The ice cold atmosphere and pure evil Horna is all about oozes from this release as it has a much better mix than their last effort, really giving the guitars the space it deserves, and a Horna hungry to put the world onto a veil of darkness once again.\n\nWhile it’s hard to beat what I personally think is their best album so far Sanojesi Äärelle Horna means business with Kuoleman Kirjo and I can honestly say this is one of their best albums to date, where only Envaatnags Eflos Solf Esgantaavne and of course Sanojesi Äärelle beats it when I write this. Of course I’ve only had a weeks time to get acquainted with Kuoleman Kirjo but during that week I’ve only come to like the album more and more. This is Horna with some fresh blood amongst their ranks, which seems to have reinvigorated the band as they’ve made their best album in over ten years (which says a lot seeing how many good album they’ve released during those years). They’ve somewhat gone back more to their roots when crafting this occult ritual and it has done them a huge favour. Personal favorites “Saatanan Viha”, “Elegia” or “Mustat Vuodet” are pure black metal gold that you need to hear, but honestly the whole album kicks some serious ass which is a most listen to black metal fans around the world.\n\nArtist: Horna\n\nLabel: W.T.C. Productions\n\nRelease date: December 8th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Mustat Vuodet\n\nFor fans of: Sargeist & Satanic Warmaster\n\nScore: 4/5 Excellent\n\nHorna\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HornaOfficial\n\nW.T.C.

I know this is very late, I should be posting the November highlights but time hasn’t been my friend lately. With that being said I will simply skip the November edition and jump straight to the albums of the year article with my next article. Before that though be sure to check out my upcoming Horna review, an album that will be a favorite among black metal fans for sure. This month saw some very good releases where the top 5 once again was a hard one to set into stone. Grafvitnir, Wayfarer, Inferi and Necrophobic were all going in and out of the top 5 but eventually fell a bit short from the picks I made so if anything be sure to check those albums out too as a couple of those will be featured on my top 50 of the year! I haven’t made a playlist for this month, due to the fact I’m working on the album of the year list and will have a massive playlist for that. Stay safe out there!\n\nAlbum of the month\n\nWhen it comes to melodic death metal I see Mors Principium Est as the uncrowned kings. Album after album they bring some of the best riffs you’ll ever hear and Seven is no different. Melodic death metal doesn’t get much better than this.\n\nMors Principium Est – Seven was released October 23rd via AFM Records.\n\nRunners-up\n\nAuðn keeps on growing even after a superb debut album back in 2014. Vökudraumsins Fangi is their best work yet and now three albums in of very high atmospheric black metal quality it’s safe to say they are a band to stay on the upper tiers of the genre.\n\nAuðn – Vökudraumsins Fangi was released October 30th via Season of Mist.\n\n16 years after their last album Goratory returns and better than ever! I honestly wasn’t that keen on them before but with Sour Grapes they blew me away. When a band consists of members from acts such as Job For a Cowboy and Deeds of Flesh you could kind of have guessed it would be top notch stuff!\n\nGoratory – Sour Grapes was released October 16th via Everlasting Spew Records.\n\nAs far as doom metal goes for me Draconian is one of the greats. Under a Godless Veil is another example of great craftsmanship where the band once again shows they are the best in the business.\n\nDraconian – Under a Godless Veil was released October 30th via Napalm Records.\n\nAnother return on the list, this time 15 years after their last album! To me Tusen år har gott… is one of the best black metal albums ever released and to see Mörk Gryning coming back with such hunger again is great. I would honestly say this is their best album after Tusen år har gott…, hard to say though when the band have released four superb albums in the past (I won’t name one of them). Safe to say that Hinsides Vrede is an album any black metal fan should listen to!\n\nMörk Gryning – Hinsides Vrede was released October 23rd via Season of Mist.\n\nMore great music of October\n\nInvincible Force – Decomposed Sacramentum\n\nSvartsyn – Requiem\n\nGrafvitnir – Death’s Wings Widespread\n\nDistant – Dawn of Corruption\n\nDemonical – World Domination\n\nWayfarer – A Romance With Violence\n\nWeight of Emptiness – Conquering the Deep Cycle\n\nCarnal Ruin – The Damned Lie Rotting\n\nArsebreed – Butoh\n\nCermonial Bloodbath – The Tides of Blood\n\nSeptage – Septic Decadence\n\nCynabare Urne – Obsidian Daggers and Cinnabar Skulls\n\nÅskog – Varg\n\nWombripper – Macabre Melodie\n\nDisrupted – Pure Death\n\nGrimorte – Revie\n\nLord Almighty – Wither\n\nCoexistence – Collateral Dimension\n\nIskandr – Gelderse poort\n\nStriges – Verum Veterum\n\nIncinerate – Sacrilegivm\n\nAphonic Threnody – The Great Hatred\n\nSkyless Aeons – Drain the Sun\n\nBenediction – Scriptures\n\nJohansson & Speckmann – The Germs of Circumstance\n\nNecrophobic – Dawn of the Damned\n\nInferi – Of Sunless Realms\n\nFurnace – Dark Vistas\n\nCellar Vessel – Vein Beneath the Soil\n\nDesperate – The Last Days of Humanity\n\nWhen Blood Falls Down – Pandæmonium\n\nMorphogenetic Malformation – Into The Odiousness\n\nAntzaat – For You Men Who Gaze Into the Sun\n\nFuneral Harvest – Funeral Harvest\n\nInfera Bruo – Rites of the Nameless\n\nSulphur Sun – Placodermic Heraldry\n\nInfiltration – Point Blank Termination\n\nConjureth – The Levitation Manifest\n\nWallfahrer – Lightbringer​-​Leidbringer\n\nDevoured by the Abyss – Omnipotence\n\nSigns of Omnicide – Interplanetary Harvest\n\nCryogenical Excision – Micro Surgery\n\nFetor – Downwards to Distress\n\nThere are probably few seasoned black metal fans who don’t know of the name Ondskapt, who have been going for 20 years this year. While only one original member remains in Acerbus he decided to keep the Luciferian act alive when bringing Gefandi Ör Andlät on bass (Dys Inbunden, ex-Mephorash), Daemonum Subeunt on drums (Claymords, Sterbhaus, ex-Netherbird) and J.Megiddo (Marduk, In Aeternum, ex-Shining, ex-Degial) on guitars together to give us the fourth full-length album from the band 10 years after their latest offering, Arisen from the Ashes. Obviously this raises some questions, does the band still hold strong after 10 years from the scene and have all these line-up changes hurt them along the way?\n\nFirst of let me start with saying I personally think Ondskapt has released one of the best black metal albums ever with Dödens Evangelium back in 2005. That album was a masterpiece, a complete package, and I spin it a lot even today. While the 2010 release Arisen from the Ashes was a solid album I didn’t think it was quite close to the levels Ondskapt reached on the album prior. I didn’t know what to expect from Grimoire Ordo Devus, would Ondskapt continue to lower their quality (granted could still be a good album, as Ondskapt got no bad ones) of get back on track with these line-up changes and a lot of time to work on a new album?\n\nA mix of both it would turn out to be. New life seems to have been given Ondskapt as I feel in love with the evil atmosphere that’s surrounding the album from the very start, the mix is on point too, and this old demon seems to have some fire left. It doesn’t burn as bright as Dödens Evangelium (almost nothing does though) but it’s better than I’d hoped it would be truth be told as I did fear this could become a nail in the coffin, that’s not the case. There are some lows such as “Opposites” and “Possession” which are quite the snooze in my book and I actually skip those songs all together after a few spins with the album. On the other spectrum songs like “Ascension” and “Paragon Belial” stands tall though and finds their way high up the Ondskapt tiers overall.\n\nAs stated I didn’t have that high hopes for Grimoire Ordo Devus due to various reasons but this turns out be a very good album even with its flaws. I hope we don’t have to wait ten years for the next album and that they can build on this release to reach the levels I know Ondskapt can reach. Celebrating 20 years of black metal worship is a big deal and while the celebration might not be as grand as I think it could be it’s still a damn good party. For those who loves occult black metal this will surely be a treat for your ears where fans of Ondskapt can make a statement they are back in style, but it’s probably not something you bring up in your album of the year talks.\n\nArtist: Ondskapt\n\nLabel: Osmose Productions\n\nRelease date: November 27th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Paragon Belial\n\nFor fans of: Watain & Ofermod\n\nScore: 3.5/5 Very good\n\nOndskapt\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ondskaptofficial/\n\nhttp://www.ondskapt.com/\n\nOsmose Productions\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/osmoseproductions/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/osmoseprod\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/osmoseproductions/\n\nhttps://www.osmoseproductions.com/\n\nhttps://osmoseproductions.bandcamp.com/\n\nAntzaat is a new acquaintanceship of mine and it probably is for most as the band has only an EP to their name and was founded in 2015, so they haven’t been around for long. Reason I got into this band are two things actually, one being they’re on a label I respect when it comes to black metal namely Immortal Frost Productions. Then there is the fact that the bands vocalist and lead guitarist Ronarg is also in the band Ars Veneficium (where he is the lead guitarist and does backing vocals), a band which I’ve previously both interviewed and reviewed their latest album Usurpation of the Seven (which was a solid album). So I had my hopes for Antzaat debut full-length album being a good one.\n\nQuickly Ronarg makes me succumb to his shrieks of anguish as that’s what initially pulls me into liking this album. When the rest of the band accompany him well in creating an uneasy atmosphere that’s well fitted for this occult offering and you’re in for a black metal treat. There is a lot of Finnish influences throughout the album where bands such as Sargeist, Behexen and Baptism comes to mind. I even get some Behemoth vibes from the title-track “For You Men Who Gaze into the Sun” which they pull of well. Funny enough I didn’t like that song at all on my initial listen but it’s grown on me with each listen and it stands out. For a debut full-length the band do try to add a lot of variation into the album and while it isn’t a perfect album I think they nail it quite well making this a go to album for me these past few weeks. You got “Through the Eyes of a Rotten Mind” which is a bit slower with a touch of funeral doom to it that makes you get a breather (at least the first half of the song) for what otherwise is a rather fast paced affair. Then you have my personal favorites “Radiant Fire” and “Veil of Darkness” where the hostile (Antzaat means hostile/hateful in old Dutch) atmosphere truly shines to me.\n\nThe future is bright for Antzaat and I can’t wait to see what they got in store next, this was really close to a 4 in my book and I might even regret not giving it a higher score later on (I hate giving scores haha). Fans of the Finnish school of black metal will have a great time here no matter what score it gets though.\n\nArtist: Antzaat\n\nLabel: Immortal Frost Productions\n\nRelease date: October 30th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Radiant Fire\n\nFor fans of: Sargeist & Behexen\n\nScore: 3.5/5 Very good\n\nAntzaat\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Antzaat\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/antzaatblack/\n\nhttps://antzaat.com/\n\nImmortal Frost Productions\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Immortalfrostproductions\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ImmortalFrostPr\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/immortalfrostproductions/\n\nhttps://www.immortalfrostproductions.com/\n\nhttps://digital.immortalfrostproductions.com/\n\nSvartsyn is a band I’ve followed for a long time, who formed in 1991 under the name Chalice and is one of the oldest bands still active today. Requiem is the bands 10th release and when a band has been going for so long you obviously expect a high level of music, even more so when the name Svartsyn has always equalled one word “solid”.\n\nWhile Svartsyn has never really stood out with those close to masterpiece albums I’ve always known that I will get a high quality album when I spin anything with the name Svartsyn on it. That truth is still valid as, just like any other Svartsyn album, Requiem is a very good black metal album full of aggression with the satanic theme still intact. A pure black metal onslaught just like it should be. With a discography like Svartsyn has where all albums are of high quality it’s hard to rank them but I don’t get the same feeling like I did with their 2017 offering In Death or their crown jewel …His Majesty from 2000.\n\nThe opener “The Pale Horse” does give me chills with the atmosphere it lays where the guitartone makes your blood turn to ice as Ornias vocals shrieks of misanthropy and death. The tempo changes are so ridiculously well made and the close to seven minute track is over almost too quick. So well rounded and got everything I want in a black metal song. That song alone as an opener made me initially think had done it, they’d created an album I might give a 5/5. The rest of the album doesn’t pack quite the same punch though apart from “Spiritual Subjection” and while that by no means mean the rest of the album is bad, quite the opposite, it’s just with an opener like that it made me think this could be an album of the year contender that would beat everything they’ve ever done. “The Desolate” drags on a bit too long though for my taste and after several listens I find that song doesn’t have the same hook that “The Pale Horse” had, if the song had been slimmed down by a couple of minutes I would probably enjoy my time with it way more, same can be said about “Little Horn” but I don’t find it as notable here. This is obviously a bit of nitpicking on what is a great album though.\n\nSo here I am, still spinning Requiem almost daily (together with the new Grafvitnir album) since I got it in my mailbox over a month ago. That in itself speaks volume and no black metal fan should skip out on Requiem. Svartsyn knows how to create very good black metal and while I don’t get that “wow factor” I know fully well that’s partly because the band has been active for so long, with no bad albums to its name, that this is what I’ve come to expect from them. Svartsyn has delivered a dark offering worthy your time once again and that’s all that matters.\n\nArtist: Svartsyn\n\nLabel: Carnal Records\n\nRelease date: October 30th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: The Pale Horse\n\nFor fans of: Arckanum & Ondskapt\n\nScore: 4/5 Excellent\n\nSvartsyn\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/svartsyn666\n\nCarnal Records\n\nhttp://www.carnalrecords.com/\n\nhttps://carnalrecords.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Carnalrecords.sweden\n\nAs we close in on the end of 2020 the album of the year list is slowly starting to come to mind more and more. 2020 being a very strange year due to the pandemic, bands calling it quits, no live shows (or at least hardly any) it has brought some good with it in terms of incredible music being put out that might have had to wait due to less time to write albums. Almost every month have had at least one album that I could see as an album of the year contender and it’s going to be hard to nail that top 50 down later on that’s for sure. September was a big death metal month for me personally where especially Proscription and Scordatura stood out. Note that I might have missed quite a few albums this time around, if so please comment, as I’ve been swarmed with work so not done my usual playlists to dig through all the new music like I usually do. As always, check out the playlist and be sure to follow it as well as look into all the bands you like!\n\nAlbum of the month\n\nWhat can I say, Maveth is one of the best death metal bands to have existed and Proscription continues that legacy with greatness. It doesn’t get much better than this. Read the review here.\n\nProscription – Conduit was released September 24th via Dark Descent Records.\n\nRunners-up\n\nMass Failure is Scordautra’s best work to date and one of the best brutal death metal albums of the year.

Why? Because K.P. gave that album a 5/5, one of the very few that’s been given on The Metal Gamer during the years! When I did my end of the year list it landed on a 40th spot, a spot K.P. thought was way too low of course haha but still means it was one of the best black metal albums you could hear in 2019. So why do I mention Murdryck when this is a review about the first demo (first ever demo review I do!) titled Varg from a band called Åskog? Well as faith had it when Murdryck sadly disbanded early 2020 2/3 members from Murdryck, including the founder Adam Chapman, decided to start a new black metal project Åskog. For obvious reasons this was one of the most hyped bands in The Metal Gamer camp this year. Can it continue the insane quality Födelsen had?\n\nWith Varg Åskog offers three songs, where the track “Vatten” being exclusive to the cassette edition. Åskog shows straight from the bat they know fully well how black metal should be played when going back to the roots. Much like the latest releases from Darkthrone, Satyricon, Svarttjern and 1349 there has been a wave of drawing influences from the 80’s and 90’s thrash, black and classic heavy metal scene. Which in my opinion fits very well together as a sweet blend of chaos. Åskog differs a lot from those said bands though in the sense that they are taking inspiration from the cold and harsh brutality of nature, which we all know can be a version of hell itself at times. As I’d hoped Åskog keep up the very high quality Murdryck had as the duo seem very inspired where the songwriting, again, being something that stands out from most black metal bands. As the duo showcase their technical skills and sync throughout the album that they’ve acquired after years of playing together you quickly realise Åskog is no ordinary new band but a duo that’s been creating music for years and know how they work well as a unit. Of course being a demo it’s a short offering, but a sweet one at that. The three songs show fully well what Åskog are capable of with all three showing different sides and venture further than Murdryck did as they incorporate more elements into the mix while still keeping the fundamentals into the black metal world.\n\nWhile I do mention Murdryck a lot in this review I want you to bear in mind that Åskog is far from a pure extension to Murdryck as the sound of Åskog is vastly different. Which I think is a good thing as otherwise they might as well have kept Murdryck going, instead Åskog is here to spread a harsh cold blizzard over the world to succumb in as the wolf howls with its might. Åskog have their own identity with a fresh take on black metal while keeping the black flames of old alive. This is more in the veins of other powerful Swedish acts such as Lifvsleda, Svederna, Armagedda and Sorhin with a touch of Darkthrone and Svarttjern for good measures. I actually find it quite remarkable that this demo was written between July and August in 2020 seeing it’s of such high quality. Åskog delivers while still managing to surprise me in a positive way and it’s safe to assume their coming full-length debut next year should be something special in the works.\n\nArtist: Åskog\n\nLabel: Independent\n\nRelease date: October 16th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Varg (note it’s cassette exclusive!)\n\nFor fans of: Svederna & Lifvsleda\n\nScore: 4/5 Excellent\n\nÅskog\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/askog666/\n\nhttps://askog.bandcamp.com/\n\nI recently reviewed the latest album from Karmanjaka titled Hugin (read it here). There were quite a few questions in my head, who is in the band, what made them go with Astrid Lindgren themed black metal to begin with and so on. What better way to get those questions answered than to ask the band themselves!\n\nLets start with a standard question that I always want to know, who is Karmanjaka? How did the band come to life?\n\nKarmanjaka is a band composed of musicians from the bands Zonaria, Folkmord, Gudars Skymning among others. We all knew each other but the one who brought us together was “Tengil”, he had been thinking of starting a heavier band for a while so me(“Karm”) and him got together in my studio to produce our first EP called “I Törnrosdalen”. All of the other members were just people whom almost naturally came together in this studio session.\n\nYou are a relatively new band, forming in 2016, and as far as I can tell I can’t find\n\nanything about you guys and your past! Do tell, you don’t have to say too much,\n\nhave anyone of you a past or is active in another band?\n\nWe all have! Past bands for the members are such bands as: Zonaria, Gudars Skymning, Folkmord, Death Maze, Destiny and many more. So you could say that we’re all very active musicians, and we all have a long background in playing all sorts of different metal and genres relating to metal.\n\nThe band has stayed the same since its formation and has in such a short time put\n\nout two EP’s and two full-length albums. Where do you get all the inspiration from\n\nin order to be so productive?\n\nA big part of the reason is that we simply enjoy writing and creating music together. We do every part of the process ourselves and it’s very enjoyable seeing your creations come to life. Something that has been very important for the process is that we all get along very well in the band. Creating things together is very uncomplicated, as it should be!\n\nInitially the band, where you also got your name from, had a very unique approach\n\nin doing black metal about the Astrid Lindgren fantasy novel The Brothers\n\nLionheart. Where did you get this idea from?\n\nIt was Tengils idea to begin with. I think the project was to be named Tengil in the start as well. The idea to start with was to just sing about the fantasy novels, now we sing about fantasy worlds and myths in general. This is mainly because we find these subjects very interesting. But a note about Astrid Lindgrens works, they are very underrated. I think that Tengil is one of the best fantasy villains there is. We actually have her descendants and companies stamp of approval to use the name Karmanjaka.\n\nWhat made you go with the Nordic Mythology theme for your latest release Hugin?\n\nSimply put, it’s something we find very interesting personally and that is very underappreciated by society today. Our old myths say a lot of very meaningful things about our past and who we were as a people.\n\nWill you go back to more The Brothers Lionheart themed music in the future?\n\nFor sure there will be more hints to that in the future!\n\nI don’t think I’ve seen any information on Karmanjaka performing live yet. Is that\n\nsomething we will see in the future?\n\nWe have done just one show, that was at Gamrocken 2019 in Grängesberg. More shows are actually planned in the future, though it’s very unclear right now when they’ll be able to take place…\n\nI see quite a few bands write a lot more music during Corvid-19 pandemic than before, mainly since they can’t tour I guess. How has Corvid-19 affected the band?\n\nHave you done even more writing on music perhaps than if the pandemic wouldn’t\n\nhave happened?\n\nWell to be honest we always have a lot of music written and write music all the time. So that is basically the same as before. Though we were planning to play more live after the release of Hugin. This of course can’t happen right now which is a shame.\n\nWhat’s next for Karmanjaka?\n\nWhen the pandemic has settled down we aim to play some shows of course. But the biggest thing right now is probably that we’re going to enter the studio to record a new full-length album in December.\n\nLast but certainly not least, does anyone in Karmanjaka play video games? If you do, got any favorite game of all time?\n\nYes we do! Everything from a lot of World of Warcraft to Dota 2 and Zelda. On the favourite game part I can only speak for myself, but I was very moved by Breath of the Wild. When I just has picked up the game it felt like when I was a kid again and had just picked up Ocarina of Time. That feeling as an adult is something very rare.\n\nKarmanjaka\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Karmanjaka-855892574540437/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/karmanjakaofficial/\n\nWhat first made me check out Karmanjaka was actually due to their name. Being Swedish and growing up with Astrid Lindgren series it’s a name I’m very familiar with. The Brothers Lionheart (Bröderna Lejonhjärta) is a Swedish fantasy novel written by Astrid Lindgren, in which Karmanjaka is the name of a cave resided by the dragon Katla (taken from metal archives). The bands debut EP from 2016 was even called I Törnrosdalen which is also a place from the same world. Their music is, as you might now realise, heavily inspired by the fantasy novel. That alone doesn’t mean it’s good music of course but luckily they do the inspiration justice as Karmanjaka has crafted some great black metal music in the past and with their new EP Hugin I was hoping for more of the same calibre.\n\nOnly a year after the full-length album Seven Names for the Witchqueen came out Karmanjaka are already back with an EP titled Hugin. As the title suggests Karmanjaka has taken a turn to the Nordic mythology on this album, that’s for obvious reasons also close to my heart but also something that’s being done by a lot of bands nowadays with mixed results. 4 songs, clocking in at 20 minutes is what Hugin offers and it’s yet again a solid release from this unsigned band (if I could sign them for Grind to Death Records I would in a heartbeat). Songs like “Vildvittra” had some folk elements in them on their last album but on Hugin they’ve marched further down that road as this album incorporates that sound a lot more. “Age of Fire” is an epic opener with sick riffs to close the song out where Karmanjaka has managed to create wicked music where the likes on Enslaved, Borknagar and Ereb Altor meets. “Raven Wings” provides more of the same black metal opus for the ears but then “Eitr” slows it down a lot where 1:30 into it the distinct drumms and riffing fury breaks unleashes. First time I heard the song I wasn’t too keen on the change of pace but after a few listens it grew on me and it works out well as a sort of contrast as the album closer “Fornjotś Call” is also of a slower pace than the first two tracks. “Fornjotś Call” is also the longest song, with its 6:45 minutes, Karmanjaka has done yet. Adding some additional vocals in play I think it was a cool idea which adds something new to their toolbox. They haven’t quite unlocked their potential yet though as I feel like there is something missing to really get my attention on those last two songs.\n\nHugin presents a new side of Karmanjaka where the two halves of the EP differ quite a bit to me. Personally I enjoyed “Age of Fire” and “Raven Wings” more than “Eitr” and “Fornjotś Call” but the album as a whole is a nice listen which I can recommend wholeheartedly to black metal fans who wants just a pinch of folk metal influences in the mix. Just like the jötunn Fornjótr, the father of Hlér (‘sea’), Logi (‘fire’) and Kári (‘wind’), Karmanjaka is a force from the north to be reckoned with. Karmanjaka is an underrated band that I hope will reach a wider audience sooner rather than later.\n\nArtist: Karmanjaka\n\nLabel: Independent\n\nRelease date: October 2nd, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Raven Wings\n\nFor fans of: Borknagar & Ereb Altor\n\nScore: 3.5/5 Very good\n\nKarmanjaka\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Karmanjaka-855892574540437\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/karmanjakaofficial/"
