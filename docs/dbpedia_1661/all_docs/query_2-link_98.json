        "text": "Tito Puente\n\nAllmusic Biography : By virtue of his warm, flamboyant stage manner, longevity, constant touring, and appearances in the mass media, Tito Puente is probably the most beloved symbol of Latin jazz. But more than that, Puente managed to keep his music remarkably fresh over the decades; as a timbales virtuoso, he combined mastery over every rhythmic nuance with old-fashioned showmanship -- watching his eyes bug out when taking a dynamic solo was one of the great treats for Latin jazz fans. A trained musician, he was also a fine, lyrical vibraphonist, a gifted arranger, and played piano, congas, bongos, and saxophone. His appeal continues to cut across all ages and ethnic groups, helped no doubt by Santanas best-selling cover versions of \"Oye Como Va\" and \"Para Los Rumberos\" in 1970-1971, and cameo appearances on The Cosby Show in the 1980s and the film The Mambo Kings in 1992. His brand of classic salsa is generally free of dark undercurrents, radiating a joyous, compulsively danceable party atmosphere.\n\nRooted in Spanish Harlem, of Puerto Rican descent, Puente originally intended to become a dancer but those ambitions were scotched by a torn ankle tendon suffered in an accident. At age 13, he began working in Ramon Oliveros big band as a drummer, and later he studied composing, orchestration, and piano at Juilliard and the the New York School of Music. More importantly, he played with and absorbed the influence of Machito, who was successfully fusing Latin rhythms with progressive jazz. Forming the nine-piece Piccadilly Boys in 1947 and then expanding it to a full orchestra two years later, Puente recorded for Seeco, Tico, and eventually RCA Victor, helping to fuel the mambo craze that gave him the unofficial -- and ultimately lifelong -- title \"King of the Mambo,\" or just \"El Rey.\" Puente also helped popularize the cha-cha during the 1950s, and he was the only non-Cuban who was invited to a government-sponsored \"50 Years of Cuban Music\" celebration in Cuba in 1952.\n\nAmong the major-league congueros who played with the Puente band in the 50s were Mongo Santamaria, Willie Bobo, Johnny Pacheco, and Ray Barretto, which resulted in some explosive percussion shootouts. Not one to paint himself into a tight Latin music corner, Puentes range extended to big-band jazz (Puente Goes Jazz), and in the 60s, bossa nova tunes, Broadway hits, boogaloos, and pop music, although in later years he tended to stick with older Latin jazz styles that became popularly known as salsa. In 1982, he started reeling off a string of several Latin jazz albums with octets or big bands for Concord Picante that gave him greater exposure and respect in the jazz world than he ever had.\n\nAn indefatigable visitor to the recording studios, Puente recorded his 100th album, The Mambo King, in 1991 amid much ceremony and affection (an all-star Latin music concert at Los Angeles Universal Amphitheatre in March 1992 commemorated the milestone), and he kept adding more titles to the tally throughout the 90s. He also appeared as a guest on innumerable albums over the years, and such jazz stars as Phil Woods, George Shearing, James Moody, Dave Valentin, and Terry Gibbs played on Puentes own later albums. Just months after accepting his fifth Grammy award, he died on June 1, 2000. Several months later, Puente was recognized at the first annual Latin Grammy Awards, winning for Best Traditional Tropical Perfomance for Mambo Birdland.

One New York-reared puertoriqueno who soared to the top of the salsa world in the 1950s was timbale player/vibist Tito Puente. Boasting such early Puente gems as \"Cual Es La Idea,\" \"Oye Mi Guanguanco\" and \"Yambecua,\" the exuberant, infectious Cuban Carnival is essential listening for anyone with even a casual interest in Afro-Cuban music. Many of the players Puente employs in his driving orchestra -- including Mongo Santamaria, Willie Bobo and Carlos \"Patato\" Valdez -- would become among the most celebrated percussionists in Latin music. Whether the style is mambo, son, cha-cha or rhumba, Cuban Carnival is outstanding from start to finish.

And even those who would normally stay away from such intense polyrhythmic music can still find a pair of masterpieces; bassist Bobby Rodriguez lends his groove to the quartet on a pair of highlights, \"Four Beat Mambo\" and \"The Big Four.\" Album: 3 of 40\n\nTitle: Dance Mania\n\nReleased: 1958\n\nTracks: 12\n\nDuration: 38:28\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify TrackSamples AlbumCover 1 El cayuco (02:36)\n\n2 ComplicaciÃ³n (03:22)\n\n3 3-D Mambo (02:24)\n\n4 Liego Mijan (03:13)\n\n5 Cuando te vea (04:14)\n\n6 Hong Kong Mambo (03:47)\n\n7 Mambo gozÃ³n (02:46)\n\n8 Mi chiquita quiere Bembe (03:56)\n\n9 Varsity Drag (02:51)\n\n10 Estoy siempre junto a ti (03:12)\n\n11 Agua limpia todo (02:55)\n\n12 Saca tu mujer (03:06)\n\nAlbum: 4 of 40\n\nTitle: Mucho Cha-Cha\n\nReleased: 1959\n\nTracks: 12\n\nDuration: 33:05\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Cha-Con-Cha (03:04)\n\n2 Suave Asi (02:31)\n\n3 Un Cha Cha (02:24)\n\n4 Campanitad de Cristal (03:02)\n\n5 El Bajo (03:19)\n\n6 Cha-Cha-Son (03:04)\n\n7 Cha-Cha-Gua (02:49)\n\n8 Delisse (02:15)\n\n9 El Palo (02:46)\n\n10 Doing the Cha-Cha (02:39)\n\n11 Chanchulla (02:30)\n\n12 Guataca (02:37)\n\nMucho Cha-Cha : Allmusic album Review : Though generally slower and more languid than the high-octane mambo that typified the Latin dance craze of the 1950s, cha-cha was a staple in the repertoire of many Latin bands at the time. The great Tito Puente was no exception, and MUCHO CHA-CHA brings together some of Puentes best work in this vein. Cha-chas are by no means ballads--their tempos, while not frenetic, are still infectious, building on mid-tempo, sexy grooves with more slink and sway than your average mambo.\n\nThe tunes on MUCHO CHA-CHA (most of which were penned by Puente) are led by bright, brassy horn lines with a burbling undercurrent of polyrhythms moving things along. Puentes late-50s band (the tracks here are culled from session cut in 56 and 59) was one of his best, and featured luminaries such as conguero Mongo Santamaria, bongo player Willie Bobo, and Cuban percussionist Ray Barretto. This is a charming set of classic late-50s Latin jazz with strong tunes, brilliant arrangements, and excellent playing (despite a crack session team, Puentes timbales are not to be outdone). New digital sound, remastered directly from the analog tapes, is an added bonus.

Cuba y Puerto Rico Sonâ¦ has firepower like no listener could have expected, despite the fact that two of Latin musics most explosive artists were headlining an LP. All of the major Cuban and Puerto Rican forms are heard, from the opening mambo (\"La Guarachera,\" with no holds barred) to bomba (the equally frenetic \"La Plena Bomba Me Llama\"), and a softer detour into bolero for \"Desencanto.\" (Celia even sang a sultry pop number for \"Mi Desesperacion.\") Puentes orchestra is in prime form, and he provides all the arrangements, while Cruz ably matches the band for energy. An outing remarkably free of salsa, Cuba y Puerto Rico Sonâ¦ covers nearly every popular Latin rhythm and remains one of the high points in each artists nearly incomparable discographies. Album: 6 of 40\n\nTitle: The King\n\nReleased: 1968\n\nTracks: 10\n\nDuration: 32:56\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Fiesta con Puente (02:53)\n\n2 TPs Shing-a-Ling (02:50)\n\n3 Guaguanco Margarito (03:18)\n\n4 It Was Love (Fue amor) (03:23)\n\n5 Safari (05:06)\n\n6 TP Treat (03:57)\n\n7 Pata Pata (03:15)\n\n8 Erasmo el loco (02:47)\n\n9 Sing-a Tin Tin (02:14)\n\n10 Ta contento el pueblo (03:13)\n\nThe King : Allmusic album Review : With a title like The King, you can expect ten great tracks. With superb material and performances by Santos Colon, Andy Senatore, and Rudy Calzado, as well as one top instrumental (\"Safari\"), El Rey is possibly the king of Puente albums on Tico. Three are originals, and two are by Bobby Marin, but all feature the great arranging talent of Puente. \"It Was Love\" is a swinging ballad, and the mod excursion \"Safari\" is topped off by a sax-anticipating Harlem River Drive. \"T.P. Treat,\" the second great Senatore song, is a wild \"scat\" boogaloo, and, of course, \"Pata Pata\" was obligatory in the boogaloo era. \"Erasmo el Loco\" keeps the crazy party going while taking a brief step back from the mainstream. \"Shing-a-Tin Tin\" is final proof that Puente can cut as good a boogaloo album as anyone. That may not be saying much, and indeed El Rey does not say much, but it sure feels good, and thats the point.

Puente, who solos on timbales, marimba, vibes and the timbalito, performs a wide-ranging set that perfectly combines bop-oriented jazz with heated Latin music. Among the many highlights are Bud Powells \"Un Poco Loco\" (a natural to be turned into Afro-Cuban jazz), his own \"Machito Forever,\" \"Killer Joe\" and \"Swinging Shepherd Blues (Goes Latin).\" A strong effort which, as with all of Tito Puentes Concord Picante recordings, is easily recommended to fans of the style. Album: 13 of 40\n\nTitle: Salsa Meets Jazz\n\nReleased: 1988\n\nTracks: 9\n\nDuration: 43:12\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Corner Pocket (04:25)\n\n2 Salsa Caliente (03:21)\n\n3 Consternation (04:09)\n\n4 Pannonica (07:20)\n\n5 Carioca (03:54)\n\n6 Guajira Soul (03:32)\n\n7 Repetition (05:33)\n\n8 CariÃ±oso (05:28)\n\n9 Con Alma (05:30)\n\nSalsa Meets Jazz : Allmusic album Review : For this particular Tito Puente recording, his exciting three-horn, three-percussion Latin jazz octet (which includes longtime saxophone soloist Mario Rivera) is joined by alto great Phil Woods on three of the eight selections, including Thelonious Monks \"Pannonica\" and \"Repetition.\" Such songs as \"Corner Pocket,\" \"Carioca\" and Dizzy Gillespies \"Con Alma\" sound perfectly natural in this Afro-Cuban jazz setting, and Puente (well featured on vibes and timbales) is responsible for two originals and seven of the nine arrangements. The music is danceable, adventurous and quite fun.

Among the key players are trumpeter Charlie Sepulveda, trombonist Papo Vazquez, Mario Rivera on tenor, and no less than four Rodriguezes (bassist Bobby, trumpeter Piro, John on bongos, and Jose on chekere). Among the most memorable performances are Thelonious Monks \"In Walked Bud,\" a Latinized \"S Wonderful,\" \"Descarga,\" \"Amanecer Guajira,\" and \"Latin Percussion Summit.\" Highly recommended and probably the most rewarding in Tito Puentes long string of Concord Picante recordings.

On this CD (which is exciting, danceable and quite surprising within the boundaries of the genre), Puente and his 11-piece unit (which includes trumpeter Charlie Sepulveda and tenorman Mario Rivera) play at their best. \"Things to Come\" is a strong opener, Fats Wallers \"Jitterbug Waltz\" gets an off-the-wall but successful transforation and even \"Passion Flower\" and \"If You Could See Me Now\" (neither of which would normally be thought of in this context) work well. All five horns have their opportunites to star (the flute tradeoff on \"The Best Is Yet to Come\" is impressive) and the rhythm section shows that it can compete favorably with that of any other Latin band. Other than the remarkably juvenile liner notes from jazz wannabee Bill Cosby, this is a highly recommended set.

The music (mostly obscure originals plus three standards) swings, and although none of the sidemen became household names, (best-known is altoist Dave Schildkraut), the musicianship is fine.

For this date Puente (who performs on timbales and marimba) uses six horns, piano, bass, synthesizer and three other percussionists to play everything from \"Donna Lee\" and \"Stompin at the Savoy\" to his own exotic originals. Soloists include the many reeds (including piccolo) of Mario Rivera, trumpeter Tony Lujan, trombonist Art Velasco and of course the percussion section. One of Tito Puentes better recordings of recent times.

Throughout the colorful set, Puente shows that practically any song (including the traditional Japanese melody \"Sakura Sakura,\" Charles Mingus \"Nostalgia in Times Square,\" and Maurice Whites \"Sun Goddess\") can be turned into exciting Latin jazz.

So does this one, including a minor riot with Celia Cruz riding a big, burly mambo arrangement by a band full of just everybody, and a wonderful \"El Bribon del Aguacero\" with Chocolate Armenteros on trumpet.

In fact, other than his own \"Lucky Dog,\" all dozen selections on this retrospective are jazz standards, including \"Airegin,\" \"On Broadway,\" \"Donna Lee,\" \"Jordu,\" and \"Killer Joe.\" In addition to Puentes regular band, there are guest appearances by George Shearing (on \"Lullaby of Birdland\"), Maynard Ferguson, Phil Woods, and Terry Gibbs included on this worthwhile overview.

The band is loaded with such all-stars as saxophonists Peter Yellin and Mitch Frohman, the equally legendary sax/flute master Mario Rivera, trumpeter Ray Vega, pianist Sonny Bravo, conga vet Jose Madera, bongo/conga man John Rodriguez, Jr., and lead vocalist Frankie Morales, among others. Puentes writing prowess is on display on seven of the 11 cuts. A wild combination of unison and counterpointed horns with churning rhythm informs the Puente-penned title track. Group vocals and swirling horns cement the guaguanco-based \"Juventud del Presente,\" one of two pieces written by Silvestre Mendez. \"Ban Ban Quere\" is a famous Latin-jazz standard, done here in swift rumba mode featuring Bravos deft montuno and off-tune coro. A quick tempo and steady, slow beat drive \"Como Esta Miguel,\" which features a fine trombone solo from J.P. Torres. Riveras immortal flute gives off a strong, steady vibe that the band picks up on for \"Cha Cha Cha Mambo.\" The other Mendez track, \"Guaguanco Margarito,\" is flavored by bata drums, and \"Mi Mambia\" features a group chorus in full bloom. The ultra-hot Puente chart \"Mambo Gozon\" is spurred by bubbling percussion led by Rodriguez and Tito on timbales (which he plays exclusively for this performance), while \"Oye Mi Guaguanco\" uses vocals and horns trading eights, then fours, in the initial melody lines. The set ends with two classics: \"Ran Kan Kan\" has feverish horns, jubilant singing, and a hefty timbale solo, while \"Oye Como Va\" is spiced with Riveras brilliant flute accents. Puente has put out more than 100 recordings over his long career, but in little over an hour, this skillfully edited live session manages to capture the essence of that huge repertoire and get to the pure root of Latin jazz. Highly recommended.

Puentes Latin rhythms and beats meshed with the swing and bebop of Hermans band on half of the discs cuts, and the results were hot and delightful. With Puente heading the rhythm section and playing timbales, Robert Rodriguez on bass, and assorted percussion from Gilbert Lopez, Raymond Rodriquez, and Ray Barretto, the band stays locked into the Latin groove while the saxophonists and trumpeters weave in, out, and around the beat. There are also more conventional Herman swing numbers such as \"Blue Station\" and \"Woodchoppers Ball,\" where the standard Herman stomping sound is in effect.
