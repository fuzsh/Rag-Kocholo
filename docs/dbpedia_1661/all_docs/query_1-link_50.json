        "text": "I'm going to assume you got the general gist of what the genre entails from the doc. So I'm going to give you some albums I really like that hit upon some of the various sub-genres within the black metal genre itself.\n\nFor more industrial, atmospheric black metal, I highly recommend a band out of France named Blut aus Nord. I like all their albums, but the last few which are known as the 777 trilogy are especially good. In some respects, the remind me a bit of Godflesh, but also retain elements of black metal.\n\nI also highly recommend the band Drudkh as a band that has fairly accessible stuff that is interesting as well. Check out Blood in Our Wells which is quite good. Immortal's Sons of Northern Darkness is very good and kind of walks the line between black metal and more traditional thrash & speed metal. In truth, Immortal is one of more accessible Black Metal bands to me. They're a good place to start as well. Early Darkthrone is another band to check out. Transylvanian Hunger is considered a classic.\n\nAnother band that blends progressive metal elements with true black metal is Enslaved. They're one of my favorites. I definitely recommend Below the Lights as a good starting point for them. I've also like the last three Nachtmystium albums, but most true black metal fans dismiss these records as they're too progressive and a bit psychedelic and, perhaps, atmospheric in places. I like the atmospheric stuff the best which is why I recommended Blut aus Nord in that they're definitely strong in that department. Others in this field that are good are Lurker of Chalice, Leviathan, and Negura Bunget. Negura Bunget's 2006 release OM is one of the best atmospheric black metal albums I've ever heard.\n\nFor more true traditional stuff that is good check out Twilight or Weakling. Both are quite good and tend to have good structure to their material while retaining the elements that encapsulate the genre itself. For folk/pagan black metal, definitely look into some Primordial.\n\nProbably the landmark album by which all other black metal albums are judged by, though, is Mayhem's De mysteriis dom Sathanas. It's very famous. Mayhem is probably the most famous/infamous band in the genre for reasons of murder, suicide, and violence. They have a long history of it all.\n\nWolves in the Throne Room is another band to check out. They're pretty popular, but pretty polarizing as well.\n\nThere's a lot more, of course, but I think those are good starting points for you to begin with. If you have any question or want any other suggestions, feel free to ask.\n\nVenom is credited as the first \"black metal\" band, but, in truth, they are really just a NWOBHM band that incorporated bits of thrash and speed metal in their arsenal. Certainly, they're the first band to put forth the imagery & content matter that much of what black metal is today. But their music is decidedly a mixture of what I mentioned above with, perhaps, some punk leanings to it. Mercyful Fate incorporated the same imagery and content as Venom, but their music is more just true heavy metal with some, perhaps, progressive and speed metal leanings.\n\nTraditional black metal is defined by its production values (dry, trebly), its vocal approach (raspy, screeching), and, believe it or not, an almost symphonic approach to the music itself. Though it might sound like a lot of noise, black metal probably closest relates to actual classical and symphonic music than any other genre of metal. I know that might strike people as strange, but, by and large it's true, at least in terms of its structure.\n\nThere are many different sub-genres of black metal, though. Off the top of my head there is atmospheric black metal, symphonic black metal, pagan metal, Viking metal (Bathory is the band that started this genre, in truth), and war metal, to mention a few. There is also \"blackened death metal\" which incorporates stylings from both death metal and black metal.\n\nThere is, of course, a whole wikipedia page devoted to black metal and what it entails, so that's probably a better source of info than little ol' me .\n\nI know, maybe you missed the\n\nI second Immortal and agree that they're one of the more accessible black metal bands overall. The early albums are pretty rough and not really my preference but I really like At the Heart of Winter. Enslaved's Below The Lights is another great choice; these guys are black metal with a touch of Pink Floyd IMO. Mayhem De mysteriis dom Sathanas is very rough but you might dig it. Also check out Bathory. There was a shift towards Viking Metal on 1990's Hammerheart so you might want to check out that album and an earlier one like Under the Sign of the Black Mark. Dissection's Storm of the Light's Bane is considered a classic and it's definitely worth a listen. Borknagar mix black metal with progressive and folk elements and may not appeal to everyone but I dig them.\n\nThere are so many other notable bands like Carpathian Forest, Dimmu Borgir, Marduk, Old Man's Child, Vreid, Keep of Kalessin, Satyricon, Gorgoroth, Burzum, Behemoth (early) that also deserve mention. You're going to find different styles within the black metal subgenre and some might not appeal to you. Since you're just discovering the style, take your time going through the bands and try not to get overwhelmed. I'm sure you'll find some great stuff and wonder why you hadn't discovered it before!\n\nWhile I'm far from as knowledgable about this genre as GodShifter and others, it's worth mentioning just how international black metal has become, at least in the more underground popular music scene. In addition to the US, Canada and Scandinavia (especially Norway and Sweden) which have been a hotbed of metal during the last two decades, black metal has thrived in an amazingly wide range of countries, many of which aren't generally regarded as powerhouses for music - just looking at the Rate Your Music top 100 black metal chart, noteworthy bands/albums in this genre have come from France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Romania, Ukraine, Israel and doubtless others further down. I guess in countries that don't have a big music industry and/or are still suffering from decades of artistic repression, communist rule and corrupt dictatorships, black metal has become one of the few genres that provides opportunities for artists to be internationally heard, especially in this day and age of the internet, YouTube and Spotify when the world has become a lot smaller.\n\nI like weird, outsider black metal so my list is:\n\n-Burzum (The KING!)\n\n-Paysage D'Hiver (Get everything!)\n\n-Darkspace (Black metal from the deepest, freezing depths of space! Wintherr from Paysage is in this band.)\n\n-Trist (Hin-Fort is killer! The first disc is one massive, atmospheric track called \"Hin\". It's awesome!)\n\n-Xasthur (Great US black metal one-man-band. Malefic also sang on Sunn 0)))'s Black One album)\n\n-Pyha (Crushing, outsider black metal from a 14 year old South Korean! Get Haunted House. It's truly hypnotic stuff!)\n\n-Fauna (Amazing Cascadian black metal. These guys are similar to WITTR but much more epic. Rain is the album to get!)\n\n-Summoning (If you dig Lord of the Rings get all their albums NOW! I know it's nerdy but they have a few songs sung in the Black Speech of Mordor. You have to hear it to understand how awesome it is! Oath Bound is the stuff of legends!)\n\n-Blood of the Black Owl (A kind of hybrid black metal/doom band. Banishing Ritual is their best IMO)\n\n-L'Acephale (Weird black metal from Portland. They are pretty avant-garde in their approach but fantastic. I recommend Stahlhartes Gehäuse)\n\n-Nortt (Really great, doomy, black metal artist from Denmark. Ligfærd is fantastic!)\n\n-Wodensthrone (Epic black metal from England. Loss is a simply breathtaking album. HIGHLY recommended!)\n\n-Nihill (Creepy, cold and desolate! These guys slam you with an almost inpenetrable wall of sound. Get Krach and have your mind blown!)\n\nIf you're into Mercyful Fate, check out Absu from Texas, and Rotting Christ from Greece (don't be put off by their name, it is not indicative of their relatively sophisticated music). These two bands have a lot of Priest/Maiden/Fate influence in their riffing style. If you find Rotting Christ to your liking, check out other Greek bands, they all share a similar sense of melody.\n\nOtherwise, mostly good recommendations from everyone. From experience, I know that people easily get into black metal through the more melodic Swedish bands like Dissection, Sacramentum, or Necrophobic (the first album is death metal). From Norway, Emperor, Immortal, and Satyricon are good gateway bands as well. Darkthrone and Burzum are much rawer, as is Mayhem, generally, plus their best album DMDS has a really bizarre vocalist, so approach with caution.\n\nAnd look, while there's a sell-out stigma attached to both these bands, Dimmu Borgir (Norway) and Cradle of Filth (UK) are mostly very good bands, so ignore the naysayers. Good musicianship, accessible production, and engaging songwriting all make for a good entryway to black metal. Of course, earlier albums are better, since both bands became too formulaic later on. Let's say, the first three or four albums by each band are where it's at, plus the EP's from the same period.\n\nIf you see that symphonic black metal (Emperor, Dimmu Borgir...) suits you, then try out the first Arcturus album, maybe Summoning as well.\n\nIf you're into the Hellhammer/early Celtic Frost crawl, try the early Samael albums. Their second album Blood Ritual is my favorite black metal album, although it also has plenty of doom metal passages, and one of the most potently clear production jobs on a metal album. Monstrous, imposing guitar tone. The drumming is also very interesting."
