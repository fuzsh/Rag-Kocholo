        "text": "Deathspell Omega – Drought\n\nThe kings of the French orthodox black metal scene are back with a new EP. Drought continues where their previous album left off. While not part of the previous trilogy of albums, it fits sonically with the sound the band established over said albums. Several of the tracks could easily be outtakes from Paracletus. That said this EP kills.\n\nAnyone who has listened to Deathspell before should know what to expect – dissonant black metal of the highest order. Bookended by two instrumental tracks, are three excellent slabs of sonic malevolence. Chaos and melody interweave and illustrate the bands fantastic musicianship. This EP is a dizzying spiral down into the depths of hell.\n\nOne of the best aspects of the EP is the stellar drumming. While the band incorporates blasts, they are interspersed between unique drum patterns that give a really diverse and interesting feel. Another unusual trait is the spectacular bass lines, something rarely heard on your average black metal album.\n\nThe vocals stick to the mid-range growl the band established on previous albums. They are delivered with passion and invoke that sinister feeling necessary for a successful piece of black metal.\n\nThe EP continues to enthrall and bewilder on repeated listens. Anyone who is a fan of the bands previous work will love it. For those who haven’t heard the band yet, this is a good place to start because all the trademarks of Deathspell’s sound are present and the shorter playtime makes it easier to digest. All in all, another superb piece of music from the French masters.\n\n9/10\n\nElysian Blaze – Blood Geometry\n\nThis is a real masterpiece of blackened funeral doom. Everything the genre has to offer is expertly displayed on this record. The six year wait since Elysian’s previous album were well worth it. I really have nothing bad to say about this album.\n\nThis is one of the few records that show just how amazing keyboards can be when used in the context of extreme metal. Helping to create a breathtaking atmosphere and crushing sense of melancholy. They intersperse perfectly with the albums guitars to create a spectacularly dark atmosphere.\n\nListeners who expect their extreme metal to be a non-stop assault should look elsewhere; this is funeral doom after all. While some segments of the songs on the album incorporate blast beats, generally the music moves along at a funeral pace. Despite its length, this really is an album that one should experience in its entirety. Throw on some headphones and listen to this album late at night after everyone else goes to sleep to get the full experience this album offers.\n\nWhile the vocals are placed way back in the mix, giving a feeling like they were recorded in the depths of some dark cave, they fit the music perfectly. Really everything about this album is perfect. Fans of second wave black metal should like it as well, because the atmosphere created evokes the Norwegian masters. This is a truly crushing album, and a must have for anyone who has any interest in funeral doom.\n\n10/10\n\nIbex Throne – S/T\n\nThis is an all out black metal assault from a sadly defunct American band. Ibex Throne were one of the better black metal bands to come out of America, but for some reason they seem to be unknown to a lot of black metal fans.\n\nThis album has everything a fan of black metal could want, harsh blasts, great riffs, killer vocals and a crushing atmosphere. The vocals range from harsh screams to deathly bellows and even a few unearthly chants/spoken parts. The album is filled with memorable guitar riffs that resonate for a long time after the album stops playing. The drums are fairly standard black metal blasts, but fit perfectly with the bands sound.\n\nReally for the life of me I don’t understand why this band isn’t a household name. This album came out in 2003 when a lot of terrible black metal was released, but unfortunately not many took notice off the quality this American band offered. This album could easily silence anyone who doubts that American black metal has anything to offer.\n\nThis is a non-stop slab of blasphemous darkness that anyone who likes black metal should check out. All around a killer album well worth the price of purchase.\n\n9/10\n\nThe Howling Wind – Of Babalon\n\nThe Howling Wind is just one of several bands featuring Ryan Lipynsky of Thralldom fame. For this effort he enlisted the drumming talents of Aldabaran and Weregoat drummer Tim Call. This appears to have paid off because this is yet another quality piece of black metal from the American band.\n\nWhile not quite as adventurous and brilliant as Thralldom, this is still a pretty solid album. Filled with atmosphere and Lipinsky’s trademark growl, this album sticks to template established on the band previous works.\n\nThis is far from the standard Darkthrone clone that has become increasingly common in today’s black metal. This album has a crushing and disorienting atmosphere from start to finish. From start to end it barely gives the listener any chance to breathe. Despite the relentless attack, the songs have a lot of groove to them, something pretty unique for a black metal band. If there is one complaint about the album it’s that after it’s over, nothing none of the songs are really memorable. That said, the album continues to entertain on repeated listens.\n\nWhile this record didn’t blow my mind, it’s still a good piece of black metal. It’s definitely worth checking out for fans of Lipinsky’s other bands or diehard fans of the genre.\n\n8/10\n\nIts that time of year again folks, where all the music magazines, big and small, begin to assemble their album of the year lists. It has been an interesting year for Black Metal. Following the creative malaise of the late 90s and early 00s, Black Metal has experienced a resurgence of sorts. Yes there is still plenty of generic, unimaginative and uninspired metal, but there is also some brilliant black metal being produced. Whether they are pushing and expanding the boundaries of black metal or remaining dogmatically dedicated to the old style, black metal bands worldwide are keeping the black flame alive. So, without further ado, here are my picks for the top 10 black metal records of 2011.\n\n10. Der Weg einer Freiheit – Agonie\n\nThis German band has been around since 2008, and this years Agonie EP is the second release from the band. Black metal purists will probably hate this band as they represent more of a post-black metal image with corpse paint, leather, spikes and Satan all noticeably absent from the record. Still, the music is firmly rooted in the black metal sound, with blast beats and hints of melody in the otherwise flesh searing guitar work. Add to it traditional black metal screams and you have one of the best pieces of black metal produced this year.\n\n9. Nightbringer – Hierophany of the Open Grave\n\nThis Colorado based band took the US black metal scene by storm in 2008 with their spectacular debut album Death and the Black Work. They are back with their third album this year, and boy is it a beast. The band has maintained their devastating originality and dark atmosphere, while increasing the quality of their songwriting. This record will appeal to both genre purists and those seeking something new in their black metal, as the band adheres to the traditions of the genre while still adding their own flavor to the sound. Overall, Heirophany is another dark and disorienting album from one of the best black metal bands in the United States.\n\n8. Galdr – Galdr\n\nWow, this one really snuck up on me. I stumbled across this band through and album review in the mighty Zero Tolerance magazine, and I haven’t stopped listening to it since. Combing the hypnotic sound of Burzum with his own brilliant songwriting, lone man Draudr has created one of the best pieces of black metal this year. The cloaked figure wandering the frozen tundra on the cover of this album is a perfect image for the sounds on this record. Galdr are one of the few bands to release and album this year where the lo-fi production actually adds to the sound and atmosphere of the album. This is an impressive debut that has me anxiously awaiting more from this talented individual.\n\n7. Midnight – Satanic Royalty\n\nMidnight rules. This Cleveland band has been kicking around in the underground since 2003. They specialize in combining black metal’s image and ideology with elements of speed metal and thrash, to create some of the most ripping metal of the decade let alone the year. This album will take genre purists back to the days of the first wave of black metal with a vicious metallic assault similar to the one delivered by the mighty Venom. There is also a punk influence in the music, with each track sounding on the verge of collapsing into utter chaos. Satanic Royalty is yet another brilliant record from a killer band.\n\n6. Caina – Hands that Pluck\n\nThis year saw the final release from Andrew Curtis-Brignell and his killer black ambient project Caina. The band started out playing a very harsh form of black metal in 2005, and in the years since the band has added influences outside of black metal and metal in general to create something truly unique. The first half of the album is where black metal fans can get their fix, as the second half is mostly instrumental soundscapes combing elements of black metal with darkwave and electronic music. The album features guest vocals from Krieg’s N. Imperial and Starkweather’s Rennie Resmini, on top of Curtis-Brignell’s usual terrifying vocals. This is not an album for black metal fans seeking the same rehashed Darkthrone tunes, but fans with an open mind will find a lot to enjoy in Caina’s music. An amazing swan song for the band and one of the best pieces of black metal produced this year.\n\n5. Rex Mundi – IHVH\n\nThe debut from France’s Rex Mundi will have fans of traditional orthodox black metal foaming at the mouth. The band takes the demented instrumental sound of French black metal and combines it with some of the most terrifying vocals I have heard in years. This record deserves a spot on this list for the vocal performance alone. The vocals range from traditional black metal shrieks to haunting whispers and bone chilling chants. Lyrically this album explores Qabalah and other occult magical systems. This album is a terrifying listen and proves that black metal in 2011 can still feel dangerous.\n\n4. Absu -Abzu\n\nProscriptor McGovern and crew are back with the second installment in their Absu trilogy. This record sees the band continue to hone and tighten their intense black thrash assault. All the usual Absu trademarks are present, blasting technical drumming, flesh searing guitar riffs, and manic black metal vocals. Lyrically the album examines the usual Absu themes of Sumerian Magical systems, from which the band draws its name. While this album isn’t as good as their masterpiece 2001’s Tara, it is still an awesome record and one of the best produced in 2011. Complex and technical while not loosing any of the vitriol or power; Absu continues to be one of the leading lights in US black metal.\n\n3. Craft – Void\n\nCraft is back! And back with a killer of an album no less. This is the Swedish crew’s first record since 2005’s slightly disappointing Fuck the Universe. The time off seems to have done the boys some good as they have unleashed a storm of hatred on the world in the form of Void. There is much more of a doom vibe going on in these songs than on any other Craft work, but fans of the band will be pleased the bands sound is still overall intact. The band has lost a lot of its satanic lyrical bent and instead focuses on the destruction of humankind. With tracks like ‘I Want to Commit Murder’ there is no doubting Craft’s misanthropic intentions. Void is a killer piece of black metal and definitely one of the best pieces of music produced this year.\n\n2. Altar of Plagues – Mammal\n\nThe Irish crew is back with their second full length since their inception in 2006. They continue to expand on the traditional black metal template by adding touches of shoe gaze to their sound. Lyrically the album examines the idea of death and the role it plays in our lives. This is a very personal and introspective piece of music that is easy to get lost in. From haunting melodies to crushing heaviness, this band has it all. Again, elitist fans of black metal will probably hate this band as much as Wolves in the Throne Room, but their compelling music will prove to those with an open mind that they have a lot to offer the world of black metal. Mammal is a masterpiece of a record that fans of post-black metal will be worshipping for years to come.\n\n1. Negative Plane – Stained Glass Reveries\n\nNegative Plane is easily one of the best black metal bands of the last 10 years, and this record is the best piece of black metal produced this year. This band has a truly unique sound that no other band has even come close to achieving. This is music from another world or another dimension. Truly compelling and absolutely haunting at the same time, this record is so unique. It proves that there are still new sounds to explore in the realm of black metal for those who choose to challenge themselves. This album is a challenging listen, and takes several spins before its brilliance really sinks in, but man is it worth the investment. Negative Plane is further proof that the US has some great black metal bands. This album is a must own for anyone who considers themselves fans of truly original black metal music.\n\nSince Halloween is upon us over here in the United States I figured I would use today’s post to examine the seedy underbelly of the word of black metal. Today’s post is not meant to glorify or promote any of the terrible actions described below or any of the many examples of poor taste discussed below, but simply to document the dark side of an already pitch black genre.\n\nThe Killers\n\nVarg “Count Grishnackh “ Vikernes\n\nBands: Old Funeral, Burzum, Mayhem\n\nThe most infamous and widely known criminal events involving black metal musicians or their followers involve this man. He was convicted by Norwegian courts in 1993 of burning several churches and the murder of Oystein “Euronymous” Aarseth. He received the maximum sentence in Norway of 21 years in prison. He was released from jail in 2010 and now resides on his farm in Norway where he continues to produce and release Burzum albums, and slowly tries to pay off the significant cost of rebuilding the churches he was convicted of destroying.\n\nIt should be noted that Snorre “Blackthorn” Ruch was also convicted for his involvement in the death of Aarseth. He was convicted of driving Vikernes to and from Aarseth apartment on the night that Aarseth was murdered. He was released from prison in 1999, and put out one album with his band Thorns in 2001. Little has been heard from him since then. Bands: Stigma Diabolicum, Mayhem, Thorns\n\nBard “Faust” Eithun\n\nBands: Stigma Diabolicum, Thorns, Hesperus Dimension, Disiplin, Sirius, Ulver, Cadaver Inc., Blood Tsunami, Scum, Emperor, Aborym, Zyklon,\n\nThe then Emperor drummer was convicted of the 1992 murder of a homosexual man Lillehammer, Norway, for which he received a 14-year sentence. He was leaving a pub in August of 1992, when he met Magne Andreassen. Bard claims that Andreassen propositioned him and suggested that they go into the woods and have sex. Bard went into woods with the man and ended up stabbing him 37 times resulting in Andreassen’s death. The murder went unsolved, until the investigation into Vikerness lead to the police investigating the entire black metal scene in Norway. He was released in 2003 after serving nine years and four months. He continues to release music in a variety of bands and musical styles.\n\nJon Nodtveidt\n\nBands: De Infernali, Rabbit’s Carrot, The Black, Nifelheim, Ophthalmia, Necrophobic, Dissection\n\nThe mastermind behind Dissection and one of the best songwriters to come out of the Swedish Black Metal scene was convicted on a count of accessory to murder for his involvement of the slaying of an Algerian homosexual man named Josef Ben Meddour in 1997. Nodtveidt was released from prison in 2004 and released one final Dissection album, which he called his masterpiece, before ending the band stating that he had “achieved all his musical goals”. Shortly after ending the band, Nordveidt committed suicide by shooting himself in the head inside a circle of lit candles in his apartment.\n\nHendrik “JFN” Mobus\n\nBands: Absurd\n\nThis German man, along with his then bandmates in black metal band Absurd, was convicted of the brutal murder of 15-year old Sandro Beyer. The trio lured Beyer, a one-time fan turned enemy, out to an isolated bungalow in the woods on the night of April 29. They then tied Beyer to a chair, leading Beyer to beg for his life. Eventually the three used an electrical chord to strangle Beyer. They attempted to hide the corpse, but the body was quickly discovered and the bands arrest followed shortly after the discovery of the body. Mobus was convicted and sentenced in 1994 to eight years. He was released on parole in 1998, but fled to the United States after giving a Nazi salute at a concert, which violated the terms of his parole. He took up residence with infamous white supremacist William Luther Pierce, in the United States. US Marshals arrested and deported Mobus back to Prison in Germany, where he remains.\n\nJarno Elg\n\nBands: No bands, but that didn’t stop the Finnish media from linking this hideous murder to the black metal scene\n\nThe murder 23-year-old Elg was convicted of took place on November 21, 1998. Elg and four other friends, ranging in age between 17 and 23, supposedly spent the first part of the night drinking a homemade alcoholic beverage known as “Kilju” and listening to black metal records. For reasons that have not yet been discovered, four members of the group, including Elg, began to beat and torture the fifth member. The proceeded to beat the man, burn him with hot metal objects, and even urinate on him. The group eventually decided they had gone to far to turn back and stabbed the poor victim to death. After his death, the group mutilated his corpse in a supposedly “satanic ritual”. Eld was convicted and sentenced to life in prison where he currently spends the rest of his days.\n\nThe Abusers and the Tasteless\n\nOryan “Host” Stedjeberg\n\nBands: Taake\n\nHost is another talented Noweigan black metal musician who is no stranger to legal authorities. He has faced several jail sentences for assaults, including a six-month stint for head butting and man at the Inferno Festival. Host was released in September 2007, after serving his most recent and third violence related prison sentence.\n\nHe has managed to stay out of jail since then, but has still garnered his fair share of controversy. One notable incident was his decision to wear a swastika on his chest at a show in Essen, Germany. He refused to apologize for the incident and the following uproar, all the while denying the band is a Nazi or National Socialist band. In fact his post controversy statements did nothing more but continue to offend sensible people and provoke controversy for the band. Taken from the bands website after the incident was the following statement. “…we truly apologize to all of our collaborators who might get problems because of the Essen swastika scandal (except for the Untermensch owner of that club; you can go suck a Muslim)!” Tasteful. Very tasteful.\n\nKristian “Gaahl” Espedal\n\nBands: Sigfader, Trelldom, Wardruna, Gaahlskagg, Gorgoroth, Godseed\n\nThis Norwegian black metal musician has served two prison sentences for two separate assault convictions. The most recent of which was 2006 conviction for which he served six months. In the bizarre case, Espedal was accused of holding a man against his will in his house for several hours where he supposedly tortured the man. The man claimed that Espedal beat him, restrained him, and began collecting his blood in a cup from which he then proceeded to drink. Espedal disputed these claims and argued that the man was asked to leave and refused which provoked the violence. He claims he never drank the man’s blood and only chose to collect it in a glass because he was trying to prevent it from staining his carpet.\n\nEspedal’s former band Gorgoroth also had its brush with controversy surrounding their stage show, this time in Poland. Their stage set up involved nude, blood soaked models on crosses as if being crucified, and severed sheep heads stuck on stakes at the front of the stage. The band was investigated for religious crimes and potential animal cruelty. No charges were ever filed but the band was dropped from several tours and has since released a dvd of the show.\n\nNiklas “Kvarforth” Olsson\n\nBands: Bethlehem, Funeral Dirge, Diabolicum, Skitliv, Den Saakaldte, Shining\n\nKvarforth is another talented black metal musician from Sweden. Kvarforth has struggled with drug addiction as well as mental disorders, which he thankfully has finally been getting treatment for in the last couple of years. His on stage antics have included severe cases of self-mutilation and assaults on audience members.\n\nOne of the most notorious incidents involving Kvarforth was the accidental faking of a suicide. After a night of drinking and drugging with a friend, he gave his buddy a note to pass on to his band members and then proceeded to jump off a bridge into the freezing water below. His buddy never saw him surface and assumed that if he hadn’t died from the fall he would have died from the cold. He passed the note onto the band and told them the news that Kvarforth had killed himself, an idea that really didn’t’ shock anyone. The note said he had selected a new singer to replace him. It said that he had set up a show and the band was to meet the singer at the show for the first time and then play the first show with the new lineup together. This replacement was simply referred to as ‘Ghoul’.\n\nNeedless to say the band, who had finally been generating some buzz outside of the underground they had been toiling away in for years, went to the show and met ‘Ghoul’ who turned out to be a very much alive and just as crazy Kvarforth. Chaos and violence ensued as the band was outraged that Kvarforth had played such a sick joke on them and allowed them to believe their close friend was dead. Yet another fine display of taste, from a genre that has so many notable examples.\n\n*For a more in-depth analysis of these crimes check out the book Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Underground by Michael Moynihan and Didrik Soderlind. The book is overly sensationalized, but remains one of the most in-depth examinations of the actions and motivations of second wave black metal scene.\n\nBefore I get into my defense of the Black Metal scene in the United States there are a few issues that need to be addressed. The fist is to understand the nature of Black Metal scenes around the world. The second is to examine the factors that have caused the worldwide Black Metal scene to look down on the US scene, and the factors that have made the creation of a “scene” difficult in the US.\n\nBlack Metal Worldwide\n\nBlack Metal is a unique genre of music in that it has a common foundation of ideals, atmosphere and sound, but there is a wide variety of individual expression based on the country and culture of the musicians. In general each country or culture, has its own unique take on the genre. Despite the differences between the countries, within any country the scene tends to have a relatively uniform sound. For example, the Finnish scene is know for its brutal and punishing take on the genre, while Norway is renowned for its freezing cold sound and atmosphere, and the French scene is know for its experimentation and the general otherworldliness of its bands like Blut Aus Nord and Deathspell Omega.\n\nThis is the fist real challenge for the US with regards to gaining respect in the world of Black Metal. The US really does not have one specific underlying or unifying sound or theme in our take on Black Metal. It is very individualistic and therefor hard to really build the idea of a scene. First of all, Black Metal is a very abrasive style of metal, even for those who are already fans of metal in general. There are very few people in any one given location that is into this type of music, which makes it very difficult to create a scene. This has lead to a proliferation of one-man-bands and small bands scattered across the country. There really is no unified sound or style that connects the US bands other than the fact that they are from the US.\n\nAn important thing to realize about Black Metal scenes in general is that while their may be a huge number of bands in any one scene, the number of musicians playing this style of music has always been small. Many of the European bands are actually comprised of the same few musicians, just working under different names or with different personnel combinations. Take the Finish scene for example. There are hundreds of Black Metal bands in Finland and they continue to have one of the strongest scenes to this day, but the reality is that for all these bands it is still just a handful of musicians creating the music and scene. Horna, one of the most renowned bands in the Finnish scene illustrates this point well. The five members of Horna have played in or are still playing in a total of 45 different Black Metal bands. The bands primary musical composer, Shatraug, alone has started and played in 20 different bands. This creates the illusion of a gigantic Black Metal scene in the country, when the reality is that it is actually just a few talented musicians. There is some of this same musical incest going on in the US, but because of the wide geographic sprawl and the variety of approaches to Black Metal taken in the US, it has been hard to build a unified “scene”.\n\nCultural Issues for the US Scene\n\nOne of the biggest problems the US Black Metal scenes faces is due to the culture of the United States. It is not just a lack of history or cultural myths to draw upon, but also other countries perceptions of the US culture that damage our standing in the world of Black Metal.\n\nThe first issue is the way other countries with significant Black Metal scenes view the culture in the US. Many Europeans, at least in the underground metal community, view US culture as vapid and even destructive. They view American culture as a threat to their culture and value systems. People like Varg Vikerness have openly spoken out against the US culture and music scene for years. He has stated that he views the American culture in the same way he viewed the Christian culture that conquered Norway in the past. He sees it as a destructive force that has come into his country to try to “Americanize” Norway. Having the scene leaders of the most important scenes in Black Metal deriding and mocking US culture and Black Metal has made it extremely difficult for the US to establish itself as a valid Black Metal scene.\n\nA lack of common history and culture has also made the creation of a unified Black Metal scene in the US difficult. Where countries like European countries like Norway, Sweden, Greece, and France all have 1000’s of years of culture and myths to draw upon and write about, the US only has a few hundred years of history to mine. Having cultural myths and traditions to call upon has been a huge part of Black Metal. Where many Black Metal bands worldwide can draw on the traditional myths, tales, sounds, and instruments of their country to give their music a unique quality the US has not had that advantage. This has meant that there is really no US Black Metal sound, like you could say there is a Norwegian Black Metal sound or a Swedish Black Metal sound. Not having these myths and common culture to call upon has lead to some copying of themes expressed in other countries, leading to the notion that US Black Metal is highly derivative of other Black Metal scenes and has nothing original or new to offer. This is another critical factor in preventing the growth of a strong, unified Black Metal scene in the US.\n\nOne other factor needs to be mentioned in regard to the reasons that the US Black Metal scene is looked down upon by many in the world of Black Metal. That is the musicians’ themselves. In the US Black Metal has become a popular genre for many musicians. In my experience the people who listen to Black Metal in the United States are social outcasts, musicians, or both. This popularity among musicians has led to a bunch of bands forming in the US that take the sounds of black metal and meld it with left wing ideologies and often the abandonment of the imagery of Black Metal. Instead of corpse paint, leather and spikes, these bands have cute haircuts and dress like fashion models. This does not sit well with the underground scene and with genre purists and has lead to a lot of derision and scorn being thrown at the US Black Metal Scene.\n\nWhy the US Black Metal Scene Rules\n\nThis brings me to my defense of the US Black Metal scene and its merits. The reality is that the lack of common culture or a common sound in the US is its strongest asset. This is truly one of the most individualistic scenes in all of Black Metal. Individualism is a key concept that is often expressed as the primary goal of Black Metal, to glorify the individual and destroy the collective heard mentality. One problem in many of the European scenes is that the bands all sound very similar. While this is a bit of a problem in any one specific sub-genre of Black Metal in the US, the diversity of the scene means that most bands have very unique takes on the genre.\n\nThe lack of a unifying culture in the US Black Metal scene also provides a significant advantage. This has allowed US bands to take different lyrical approaches to the genre and push the genre into new territories. Instead of being forced to focus on the mythology of our culture or the pagan traditions as many European bands, US bands are open to discuss any culture or lyrical topic without fears of being labeled false by our own scene. This also has meant that the issue of NS Black Metal and Racist Black Metal has not been as significant in the US as it has been in other countries, which is a good thing. That is not to say that this is not an issue at all in the US scene, but that it is less of an issue in the US than elsewhere.\n\nBut again, the most important and valuable thing the US Black Metal scene has to offer the world of Black Metal is a unique take on the genre. While many other scenes around the world have been rather stagnant, with one or two bands dominating the scene, and all the other bands attempting to copy their sound, the US has seen the genre of Black Metal pushed in all different directions. Whether you are looking for underground Necro Black Metal, Depressive Suicidal Black Metal, Orthodox Black Metal, Nihilistic Black Metal, War Metal, or Post-Black Metal the US Black Metal scene has what you seek. Below I have listed just a few of the Amazing Black Metal bands to emerge from the US Black Metal scene.\n\nUS Black Metal Bands\n\nGrand Belial’s Key\n\nThis Virginia band formed in 1992 during the early stages of the Second Wave of Black Metal. They are an absolutely amazing traditional Black Metal band. They have faced some controversy in their career, namely being accused of being a NS or racist band. Anyone who has ever taken the time to listen to the music or read and interview with the band members would understand that this is a false accusation, thrown at them because they dared to criticize Jewish religion and not simply Christian religion. This is a phenomenal band which proves the US has something to offer the world of Black Metal.\n\nAverse Sefira\n\nThis is an awesome US Black Metal band from Texas. These boys are extremely talented musicians that put on one hell of a live show. Their music is much more technically oriented that most traditional Black Metal. They create disorienting soundscapes and bring a technical and musical prowess that is matched by few in the global Black Metal scene.\n\nJudas Iscariot\n\nThis Illinois band is another example of excellent US Black Metal. While it is highly derivate of the Scandinavian Black Metal sound, it is perfectly executed and proves that the Norwegians are not the only ones who can produce quality Necro Black Metal.\n\nKrallice\n\nThis band is one of those bands that cause debate among scene purists and those wanting the genre of Black Metal pushed forward. This band creates dizzying 8-minute journeys into frozen soundscapes that absolutely hypnotize the listener. The problem is that this music is created buy a bunch of nerdy looking music types, not the usual corpse painted satanic warriors. While I personally believe the imagery of the band is almost as important as the music in Black Metal, one listen to the musical brilliance of their records proves that they have something to offer the Black Metal world.\n\nAgalloch\n\nThis Oregon based band is downright amazing. They are one of the most talented bands to come out of the US Black Metal scene ever. They play a mixture of Black Metal and Folk music that is absolutely compelling. This band is proof that the US has a lot to offer in terms of innovation and creativity when it comes to Black Metal.\n\nLudicra\n\nThis female fronted San Francisco Black Metal band is another great example of the brilliance of US Black Metal. Combing the cold, harsh atmosphere of city life with the bleak sonic palette of Black Metal to create a truly crushing Black Metal masterpiece. Another great US band that also shows that women can valid Black Metal musicians.\n\nProfanatica\n\nThey are one of the earliest US Black Metal bands and also one of the heaviest. This band combines programmed drums with disgustingly heavy riffs, and absolutely guttural profanations from their vocalist. This is some of the most blasphemous and downright offensive Black Metal ever produced, not just in the US, but in the world.\n\nBlack Witchery\n\nThis Florida based war metal band is absolutely devastating in their sonic assault. Combining the brain crushingly heavy sound of old school death metal, with the lyrical and visual components of Black Metal to create a disgustingly catchy brand of sonic violence.\n\nNachtmystium\n\nThis Illinois based band combine underground Necro Black Metal with psychedelic 60s rock to create a compelling new take on the genre. Their unique take on the genre has lead to a broadening popularity with other musical scenes outside of Black Metal as well. When they released “Instinct: Decay” in 2006 many were calling them the future of Black Metal, not just in the US, but worldwide.\n\nNegative Plane\n\nWhat can I say about this New York based band? They create some of the most unique and absolutely haunting Black Metal that I have ever heard. They are pushing the genre to become more individual and to experiment more with the sounds of Black Metal. Their latest album “Stained Glass Revelations” is a breathtaking musical journey into the esoteric world of the occult.\n\n1. Bathory– Under the Sign of the Black Mark\n\nBathory is without a doubt the most important and influential band to ever play black metal. The bands music was so original and unique that not only did it go on to inspire future generation of black metal bands, but went on to influence thrash, death, Viking and metal bands in general. Like Mayhem, the atmosphere of this album is amazing. While nobody will be surprised that Bathory are on this list, the choice of this album might be controversial, but the reality is this was the pinnacle Bathory’s black metal output. It could even be argued that Quorthon realized this as he began to move away from black metal into Viking metal in the albums that followed. The low quality production combined with amazing guitar riffs, and absolutely terrifying shrieks of Quorthon create an album that has not been matched since. This album is the blueprint for future generation of black metal. This album was so far ahead of its time. All of the elements that went on to define the sound of the second and many of the third wave black metal bands can be found on this record. The haunting atmosphere, claustrophobic soundscapes, devastatingly harsh vocals, satanic and evil imagery, and terrifying cover art continue to be influences on bands to this day. This record literally defined what black metal was and would become in the future. In fact, if someone asked me what black metal was I would hand him or her a copy of this record. Anyone who claims to be a black metal fan must own this record.\n\n2. Mayhem– De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\n\nThis is one of the seminal records of the Norwegian Black Metal scene and an absolute essential for any black metal fans record collection. While this band’s sound has not been copied to the extent that a band like Darkthrone’s has, the importance of this band and this record cannot be denied. Many die hard Mayhem fans argue that the only true vocalist for Mayhem was Dead, a notion which is understandable if you have heard the only recording featuring Dead on vocals, the live album ‘Live in Leipzig’. That said, Atilla Csihar the vocalist, originally from the Hungarian band Tormentor, who replaced Dead after his suicide does an amazing job on this album. His vocals are utterly unique and have yet to be matched by any other vocalist since. His style is so completely otherworldly, ranging from demented shouts, blackened howls, and guttural vocalizations. Combined with the amazing riffing of Euronymous, and the blasting drums of Hellhammer this album is absolutely amazing. A critical element of this album is the haunting atmosphere that the album creates. Very few bands before or after this album came out have been able to come close to creating the eerie atmosphere of this record. This record was released about a year after Euronymous’s murder and is a fitting monument to his musical works. Mayhem’s influence on black metal and especially the Norwegian scene makes this, their best album, an absolute must for all black metal fanatics.\n\n3. Burzum– Filosofem\n\nBurzum’s influence on the black metal scene is undeniable. While Varg’s personal statements and actions have been questionable at best, the music he has created has been amazing and unique, with a few exceptions. The sound and atmosphere he created on this record and all three records before this one undeniably influenced generations of bands to come. Understandably many criticize Vikernes (the sole member of the band) for his actions (church burnings and murder) and for his politics (he has often made statements supporting fascism, racism, and national socialism), but his music is spectacular. It should also be noted that Burzum has never been a vehicle to express any of these fascist, racist, or national socialist views. This album is composed of long, highly repetitive tracks that create a hypnotic or sleeplike effect on the listener, pulling you deeper and deeper into the abyss as the album progresses. Vikernes’s vocals sound like haunting shrieks resonating from a pagan past. Some of Burzum’s earlier albums are highly influential as well, but to me this is the pinnacle of his work. He manages to seamlessly intertwine raw black metal with hypnotic electronic elements to create an absolute masterpiece. The influence of this band can be seen in the any of the one-man-band black metal that is so common in today’s black metal scene.\n\n4. Beherit– Drawing Down the Moon\n\nBeherit is a band that is very divisive in the black metal scene. Black metal fans either love the band or absolutely hate them. At the time of the albums creation many outside of Finland and even some in the country absolutely hated the band, to the point where a band was reportedly formed named ‘Fuck Beherit’. The bands early albums took the idea of lo-fi or necro metal to the extreme, making albums like ‘Oath of the Black Blood’ unlistenable to any but the most diehard black metal fan. Their recordings were so raw that the band could easily be confused for a goregrind band with a heavy satanic bent. Drawing Down the Moon improved the production quality slightly and the songwriting immensely. This is another album where the atmosphere is absolutely perfect. This is a truly terrifying record that to this day has yet to be matched in power and overall evilness. This band added some electronic elements onto the raw black metal template to create a truly unique record that has not been matched since. One of the reasons this band is so important is because they were the first big Finish black metal band and helped establish what is today one of the strongest black metal scenes in any country.\n\n5. Blasphemy– God of War\n\nBlasphemy is an absolutely killer band from Canada that introduced a whole new level of brutality to black metal. While some might argue that the band is really more of a death metal band, the connection to black metal is undeniable. They band can be credited along with Beherit as being responsible for the creation of the bestial war metal or bestial black metal scenes of today. If you listen to any of the bands from these scenes, they clearly take liberally from the musical blueprint created by Blasphemy and Beherit. This album is head smashingly heavy from the from start to finish and stands out as some of the most brutal black metal put to record. They also put Canada on the black and death metal map; both genres’ now have very solid scenes and bands in the country. If you are in the mood for some devastatingly heavy black metal then look no further than Blasphemy’s ‘Gods of War’.\n\n6. Deathspell Omega– Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice\n\nThis album was a game changer, and still stands today as the best album to come from the third wave or orthodox black metal scene. The musicianship on this record is truly amazing, and the sounds created by this band are so unique. Angular, shifting riffs, haunting and utterly occult lyrics, and left field direction changes make this music a challenge for the casual listener, but an absolute masterpiece for those dedicated enough to delve into its depths. This is not only the best band and album to come out of the orthodox black metal scene, but also one of the best bands to come out of France, another country with a historically fantastic black metal scene. Mesmerizing and challenging the listener at the same time, this record proved that black metal was alive and well in the 2000s and that the genre still has plenty to offer. The mystic surrounding this project is also significant, as they have done no official interviews and have refused to reveal the names of the musicians in the band. If you don’t own this masterpiece of a record, then your record collection is for incomplete.\n\n7. Emperor– In the Nightside Eclipse\n\nThis band is by far the best band to come out of the symphonic black metal scene, and can be created as the genre’s forefathers. This record, along with its follow up, stands out as the best example of the use of symphonic elements in black metal. The music is still guitar driven, but the keys are used to add a level of atmosphere that few bands before or since have been able to touch. This is a true masterpiece of symphonic black metal. This is some of the most epic metal to come out of the black metal scene and like any good black metal album; it is dripping with magical, occult atmosphere. The vocal performance by Ihsahn’s is also the most powerful and devastating of his entire career. This band has been a huge influence not only on the symphonic black metal scene, but the whole black metal scene in general. The band continued to change and evolve over future albums and is one of the few black metal bands to truly follow their own path with no regard for scene rules or fan expectations. This is a monumental record for symphonic black metal and a must have for any fans collection.\n\n8. Watain– Casus Luciferi\n\nThis band is undoubtedly the biggest band to come out of the world of black metal since the heyday of the second wave bands. I feel bad putting them on this list, because they don’t need any more promotion, but their success and influence are undeniable. This Swedish band has been at the forefront of resurgence the black metal scene has had in the 2000s. Their popularity, and the popularity of black metal spiked with this album’s follow up ‘Sworn to the Dark’, but ‘Casius Lucifari’ is where it all started. A drastic step up from the more death metal influenced ‘Rabid Life’s Curse’ this record is full of magical moments. The band has openly discussed the ritual nature of their music and its hard to deny when you hear the magic that is summoned on this record. The band have undeniable tapped into some “creative force” and there is a magical or mystical feeling to the music. A similar mystic surrounds the band, something that few bands have been able to create since the beginning of the Norwegian black metal scene. This album is a true masterpiece of orthodox satanic black metal, and a must have for anyone claiming to be a fan of black metal.\n\n9. Leviathan– The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide\n\nCall it one-man band black metal, call it basement black metal or whatever moniker you want to place on it, this album is a masterpiece of the genre. Wrest, the only member of this project, created a harrowing album that still terrifies today. While there has been an overflow of absolutely terrible “basement black metal” bands in the last few years, especially from the United States, this record proves that the genre does actually have something to offer. This album takes the listener to a journey through the deepest darkest realms of hell and of self-hatred. I don’t know of any other way to describe this album than utterly devastating. Like any good black metal record this album is dripping with atmosphere, and one listen makes you question the sanity of the music’s creator. Twisted melodies and demented screams fade in and out of this heavily ambient piece of black metal. This album and band went on to have a huge influence on the basement, ambient, and suicide genres of black metal. It also stands out as one of the best pieces of black metal to come out of the U.S. black metal scene. If you don’t already own this album, pick it up immediately.\n\n10. Wolves in the Throne Room– Diadem of 12 Stars\n\nThis is another band that comes from a sub-genre of black metal that many fans of black metal loathe, but like Leviathan they prove that their genre has something to offer the world of black metal. This post black metal or shoegazing black metal band often gets labeled as ‘hipster black metal’ due to their crossover success with more mainstream music fans, but at its core this album is deeply rooted in black metal. This is by far the bands best record, and holds a real mystical power to it. Unlike the other bands on this list, this band is not about Satanism or Occultism, but is more dedicated to getting in touch with nature and the past. This lyrical focus is another reason this band is often hated on by black metal elitists. The reality is that this album is a true masterpiece. Full of atmosphere and clearly connected to the Cascade Mountains where the band reside. Listen to this album while walking through the forest or hiking in the mountains and the magic of the album becomes truly evident. This album really is a masterpiece, and has been a huge influence on the immerging post black metal and shoegazing black metal scenes.\n\nThe Darkness Begins\n\nThe extreme metal subgenre known as Black Metal came into existence in the early 1980s. There are large divisions within the genre of Black Metal and many sub-generes exist within the overall category of Black Metal, but for the purposes of simplicity I will focus on the general history of the “first wave”, “second wave”, and “third wave” of Black Metal. Some will argue that Black Metal has roots back to 70’s bands like Coven, who are the first I know of to have recorded a “Black Mass”, but the image and sound were completely different, therefore this will focus on the “first wave” in the 1980s.\n\nThe First Wave\n\nThe “First Wave” of Black Metal involved four significant bands that sounded very different from each other, and came from very different backgrounds. While each of them looked different, sounded different, and came from different countries, they were united by a “spirt” in their music and a focus on bringing an element of darkness into the world through their music.\n\nVenom is widely accepted as the band that gave the name to the genre with their second album, titled “Black Metal”. Venom is an English band that still continues to play shows around the globe even today (although they only feature one founding band member). They began their career with their first release “Welcome to Hell” in 1981 by making an unholy racket that many in the metal world rejected as a joke, as many believed they could barely play their instruments. What they lacked in musical ability they made up for in raw power, energy, and vision. The band members took on stage names such as Cronos, Mantas, and Abaddon (this use of stage name has been picked up and carried on in the Black Metal scene to this day). They also dressed in leather and spikes trying to look as evil as possible. Their lyrics focused largely on the topic of death and satanism. The reality was that Venom weren’t satanist and didn’t have anything to do with the occult but they exploited the image and inspired a myriad of bands even to this day.\n\nCeltic Frost a Swiss band that began their career’s in 1984 were another hugely influential first wave band. Tom Gabriel Fisher and Martin Ain started the band in their teenage years as an outlet and escape from a very rough childhood. The band began as Hellhammer and released 2 hugely influential demos, which have recently been remastered and re-released on cd. Hellhammer folded and eventually morphed into Celtic Frost. Their initial recordings are extremely low quality but the raw energy and emotion delivered by the band are undeniable. They had a very dark image, again focusing on black outfits, with leather and metal studs. They also wore dark face paint under their eyes to make them look more sinister (a precursor of “Corpse Paint” which would become an essential element of the Black Metal image). While Fisher has denied any satanic influence in his lyrics, the dark nature of them and the overall sound of the band clearly influenced many in the second and third waves of Black metal.\n\nMercyful Fate and their legendary frontman King Diamond are another hugely influential first wave band who began their career in 1981. King Diamond was a large influence because he was the first artist to openly be associated with any satanic order, that being Anton Lavey’s Church of Satan. Diamond has openly admitted his affiliation with the church and the satanic content in his lyrics. While many in the second and third wave consider Lavey and the Church of Satan, as a worthless humanist organization, they were undeniably important influences for later Black Metal Bands. Their sound again is completely different with Diamond preferring to go into a soaring falsetto voice. While many today would laugh at the “dated” sound of their records, the atmosphere and openly satanic stance made them a key band. King Diamond also wore an early version of corpse paint and incorporated inverted crosses in his image (another key symbol in the Black Metal world).\n\nBathory, the final first wave band, truly took the goals of all the bands above and created some of the most evil and influential metal ever created. Bathory’s first three albums had undeniably the largest influence on sound and image in the second wave of Black Metal. Bathory were a Swedish band created by Tomas “Quorthon” Forsberg who’s father was a label executive, which enable him to release his music. Bathory’s first appearance came via a song on a compilation cd released in 1983 by his fathers label, titled “Scandinavian Metal Attack”. Quorthon managed to capture an absolutely terrifying atmosphere in his music that became a key component of future Black Metal releases. His lyrics and image were very dark and satanic and his high pitch, harsh, grating rasp became the go to vocal for many future Black Metal bands. After Bathory’s third album, the devastating “Under the Sign of the Black Mark”, Quorthon began to change the lyrical stance of the band and created the genre now known as “Viking Metal”. Viking metal has developed on its own but still maintains some connection with Black Metal, especially with the Folk/Black Metal bands.\n\nThe Second Wave\n\nThe Second Wave of Black Metal really has its roots in Scandinavia, specifically Norway and Sweden. The second wave is generally considered to have begun with the band Mayhem (who’s scandals will be discussed later), who began the band in the mid 1980’s as essentially a death metal band. The second wave isn’t really considered to have been fully in swing until the 1990’s when Mayhem and several other Norwegian bands finally released their debuts.\n\nIt is critical to understand the beginning of the second wave of Black Metal to begin to make sense of the murders and mayhem that were to follow. The first thing to understand is that many of these band that were involved in church burnings, murders, grave desecrations, and assaults were disenfranchised teenagers. They didn’t see where they fit in their country and many felt lost. While some blamed Christianity for destroying their past culture and viewed their actions as an attempt to reawaken their pagan spirt, and bring meaning back into their lives, the majority were simply confused and easily influenced teenagers that got caught up in being “evil” and “different” and many payed the consequences for their actions. That being said, what follows is a non-judgental narrative of the events and actions of the second wave of black metal.\n\nThe second wave began as a reaction against Death Metal which began as an underground movement and focused on playing dark and brutal music with lyrics about evil, darkness, and death. As the seen progressed, bands began to take influence from the grind and punk scenes and their lyrics and image moved away from darkness and death, to becoming more normal and socially aware. The birth of death metal bands wearing sweat-pants and white tee-shirts and singing about left wing politics is really what spawned the second wave of Black Metal. Euronymous of Mayhem was a key leader in the Norwegian Black Metal scene and his label Deathlike Silence and record store Helevete (despite their total commercial faliure) became critical to the scene. Euronymous has been credited as being a leader of the “Black Circle” a group of Norwegian’s who were credited with masterminding and carrying out a series of church burnings, grave desecrations, and even murders in Norway.\n\nThe second wave Norwegian bands that would eventually label themselves as “True Norwegian Black Metal” each had a unique take on the sound but the overall image of the bands and the lyrical stance was very similar. All of the bands in the scene wore corpse paint, black leather, bullet belts, spikes and chains. This image came from the previoiusly mentioned first wave bands as well as a few South American Death Metal Bands like Sarcofago who wore corpse paint and bullet belts as well. Critical to the scene however was the idea of individuality, and so while the bands often looked alike, they each had their own unique take on the sound and genre. Mayhem maintained their roots in death metal for their first few releases and sounded like very lo-fi evil satanic death metal, they eventually morphed into a more standard black metal sound with high pitched screeching, tremmelo picking, and blast beats. Emperor had the same image as Mayhem but they injected a symphonic element into their Black Metal, creating the sub-genre of Symphonic Black Metal. Immortal took the same image, but instead of focusing on a satanic lyrical slant, they created a fictional world “Blashyrkh” where they existed and ruled as demon lords. Burzum took the sound and merged it with some electronic elements to create harrowing and repetitive soundscapes that transport the listener to darker primitive times. Darkthrone created and absolutely terrifying hellish atmosphere and an evil sound that would go on to be the template for hundreds of future “Necro Black Metal Bands”. If these bands had simply stuck to music, who knows what would have happened, or what magic might have been created, but then again nobody may have heard of them without the controversy.\n\nMayhem\n\nMayhem have by far the most compelling and well known story within the black metal scene. The first real shock that Mayhem gave the metal world came form their singer, a unique, compelling, and amazingly talented individual known as Per Yngve “Dead” Ohlin. The only record of theirs to feature Dead on vocals is the live album “Live in Leipzig”. Dead was a swedish kid, who the band convinced to move out to Norway and join them as their vocalist. A few years after moving out with them, Dead was living with Euronymous (Mayhem’s guitarist) and Hellhammer (Mayhem’s Drummer). Sadly Dead decided to take his own life by slitting his wrists and then finishing himself off with a shotgun blast to the head. He left a suicide note that simply read “please excuse the mess”. The controversy did not end there however, as when Euronymous and Hellhammer arrived home they took photos, skull fragments, (which they made neclaces from and sent some pieces to swedish bands), and even allegedly ate some of the brains (no-one knows if this last part is true or simply something Euronymous said to make himself and the band more evil). One of the photos of the scene was used for the cover of the Mayhem release “Dawn of the Black Hearts” leading to the the bands bassist “Necrobutcher” breaking ties with the band (he would not return to the band until after Euronymous’s murder). Mayhem would make headlines again when Euronymous was brutally murdered in his appartment building by his former friend and band member Varg “Count Grishnackh” Vikernes of Burzum.\n\nBurzum\n\nAs noted Vikernes was convicted of the murder of Oystein “Euronymous” Aarseth as well as being involved in the arson of three different churches in Norway. The story surrounding the murder of Euronymous is well documented in books like Lords of Chaos and the documentary film Until the Light Takes Us. Whether Vikernes was motived by self-defense (very unlikely), issues with Euronymous’s handling of his records (he was signed to Euronymous’s Deathlike Silence Productions), or jealousy over Euronymous’s position in the scene is unknown, but the events that transpired are well documented. Vikerness and bandmate/friend of Euronymous’s Snorre Ruche (also of the band Thorns, largely credited with creating the guitar sound of the second wave bands) drove 4 hours to Euronymous’s town and arrived at his apartment in the early hours of the morning. Vikerness went upstairs, according to him, to sign some papers releasing Burzum from the label, but ended up chasing Euronoymous down his apartments hallway stabbing him multiple times and eventually finishing him off with a stab to the head, while Snorre stood by in the downstairs hallway. The two later drove off and possibly would have gotten away with the murder if Vikerness hadn’t preemptively went to the cops to try to clear his name (he wasn’t a suspect at the time, as the police believe it was someone from the rival Swedish Black Metal scene as they had been sending him death threats in the mail). Vikernes’s arrest and his subsequent interrogation lead to the investgation of the entire black metal scene and resulted in the arrest of members of various bands for arsons and another murder (that being the murder of a homosexual man in a park by Emperor’s then drummer Bard Faust).\n\nSwedish and Finish Scene\n\nAt the same time that the Norwegian scene was developing and exploding, similar scenes and movements were happening in both Finland and Sweden. The most famous band from the Finish scene at the time, Beherit, had an absolutely beastly sound that would go on to influence US and Canadian Bestial Black metal bands like Black Witchery and Blasphemy. The Swedish scene gave rise to amazing bands like Dissection who introduced a new level of melody into Black Metal. Marduk took blasting and speed to a new and unparalleled level, and Gehenna who introduced elements of folk into their music much like the Norwegian band Ulver.\n\nFrom these small Scandinavian scenes a worldwide movement of Black Metal truly began with scenes popping up in the US and Canada, South America, France and Italy, even Russia and Asia have scenes now. Nowadays, each of these scenes brings their own unique take to the genre and offers, often injecting tradition instruments from their culture and focusing on folklore and myths from their own countries and cultures. However, shortly after the murders and arsons were exposed in the Norwegian scene between (1993-1995) Black Metal began to take off in popularity and lost much of its originality, with many copycat bands forming, leading to scene leaders like Ulver, Satyricon, and Emperor to move away from the Black Metal sound to more expansive pastures. These copycat bands along with the post-black metal movement (a movement which took the sonics of black metal but left behind the connection to satanism and pagan ideals) lead to the formation of the “Third Wave” of Black Metal.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nThe Third Wave of Black Metal spawned as a reaction to the stagnation of the Black Metal scene and sound in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Many of the strongest bands from the second wave had changed their sound or moved on from Black Metal completely, and most of the new bands coming out were copy-cat’s of the genre’s originators. This made many in the Black Metal scene feel like Black Metal as a genre was dead, overrun by mediocrity much like the death metal scene the second wave was a reaction against. However, the spirit and essence was still alive in the underground and the third wave other-wise known as Orthodox Satanic Black Metal was born.\n\nAs the name implies this new movement in the Black Metal underground sought to add meaning back into the music and connect the music back to their satanic beliefs. Many bands had taken influence from the second wave bands sound, but moved away from their ideological stance, which sparked the ire of the third wave bands. Some of these bands adopted philosophical lyrics (often nihilistic), pagan themes, or depressive/suicidal themes. To third wave bands there is no such thing as Black Metal without Satan, or at least a connection to Satanism. They sought to bring Satanism and religion back into the genre and to reawaken the dark “spirit” that they felt had been lost in the years following the Second Wave Norwegian bands.\n\nWhile the third wave bands are spread around the globe and Sweden and France have produced the most notable, leaders of the third wave. Probably the most important band for the third wave would be Watain from Sweden. Their popularity in the Black Metal underground and their over the top live shows have propelled Watain to the forefront of the genre these days, with people from the general metal and hardcore community becoming fans (something that almost never happens in the Black Metal world). Their focus on satanic lyrics and insane live shows with inverted crosses, and severed animal heads adorning their stage set-up has made them famous in the scene. Not mention the stench, anyone who has ever been to a Watain show knows what I mean.\n\nAnother critical band in the third wave movement is Deathspell Omega. This French band, along with a few other french bands, helped to bring satanic orthodoxy back into Black Metal as well. Deathspell Omega is a collective which does not release press information and will not even confirm who is in the band. This is key because it brings back to Black Metal part of the mystic that it had originally, that fact that we as an audience know so little about them other than their intention with the music and what we can gleam from their complex music.\n\nThird wave bands continue to tour and form today, with the Black Metal scene being just as strong and underground as ever. While the third wave has not courted the same level of controversy as the second wave (with their murders, arsons, and desecrations), they have faced their fare share of controversy based around their performances. Over the top stage shows and the use of dead animal corpses and blood has many Black Metal bands blacklisted from clubs and venues around the world. Watain has courted controversy by openly stating that they perform animal sacrifices in “satanic rituals”. While many in the scene do not support or endorse any actions like this, their commitment and dedication to their art and their religion has lead to an ever increasing following for the band.\n\nWhat the future holds for the genre is anyone’s guess but the dedication of the artist and fans involved in the Black Metal scene mean that the genre will survive and continue to thrive in the underground. Black metal is not now, and never has been music that is for everyone or could be packaged for mass consumption. If you asked any two Black Metallers what Black Metal means or what defines it, they would give you a different answer, and that individuality is what makes the music so special. It can be spiritual music for you or simply something to listen to if you want to go on a journey into the darkness. Black Metal truly is whatever you make it and its spirit rests in the heart of all the fans and bands that keep the music alive."
