        "text": "I mention frequently these days that I receive a massive torrent of emails from bands and labels alike. I spend a lot of time praising the music, which is at the forefront of everything I try to do with this site. But it has been apparent over the last few years that 1) there are patterns to where my favorite releases tend to come from and 2) we have given labels too much grief over the years. Yes, there are some shifty people lurking in certain record companies, and whether you think their cut of the album profits is fair is up for discussion. But at the end of the day, these are hard-working people just like you and me who are putting up their time and money to pay for recording, mastering, printing, advertising, etc. so that the bands can get their names out their without having to jump through so many hurdles.\n\nIt is with that idea in mind that I present to you my 10 favorite metal labels out there right now. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it contains the ones that, by numbers, tend to bring me the best music money can buy. Be aware while reading this that some of the bands may not currently be signed to these labels, but that they currently distribute a release from that band which blew my mind in some way. A few honorable mentions: Dark Descent, Arachnophobia, Good Fight, Hypnotic Dirge, Candlelight, Satanath, Sentient Ruin, Halo of Flies and Grimoire to name a few. And in terms of major labels, Prosthetic and Relapse are still churning out the highest numbers of quality releases in my opinion."
