        "text": "2013 was a year full of ups and downs for me, personally; this blog actually seems to be getting some attention, and I am getting to use it to help get the word out on some of my friends’ projects, which is cool. I have also been investigating the Twin Cities metal and punk scenes, which has made me lots of new friends and has ensured that I have seen a staggering amount of live music this year, particularly this summer. Burning Fist is publishing some of my reviews, which is totally amazing, and I still have other reviews on the table for other people, not to mention the ones I have yet to finish for this (Inquisition?). I have also finally melted down in pretty much the most awful anxiety-ridden puddle of despair that I’ve been in, which is impressive, considering the past couple of years, and I’m finally starting to claw my way out of that. That, mixed with taking on entirely too much this past semester because I might be an idiot, has ensured that I am way behind on updating, and that I have neglected this blog far more than I would have liked in the past year. But no more. I’m going to fix that. Next semester shall be less crazy, and I still have a pile of new albums I’d like to blather about.\n\nAnyway, things have also been broiling in the black metal world lately. Between more run ins with the law, attention being paid to great underground bands, and the past rearing it’s head, a lot has happened in 2013. So without further ado, enough about me. Let’s talk about…\n\n20 Year Album Anniversaries\n\nThis year contained the anniversary years of a lot of amazing albums. Some of the heaviest hitters, of course, being Immortal’s Pure Holocaust and Darkthrone’s A Blaze In the Northern Sky (the latter has been spinning in my car lately, it being Minnesota and winter and all). Next year, of course, will see the 20th anniversary of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. May have to get myself a vinyl of that to celebrate (and by may, I mean, will, of course).\n\nObscure, Fantastic Black Metal is Seeping Into the States\n\nMaryland Deathfest has just been an absolute hotbed for great black metal lately, and obscure stuff, too. This past year saw Aosoth and Antaeus playing sets on the same day (poor guys must have been exhausted. I was exhausted, and I was just watching them), along with fellow countrymen Glorior Belli and the incredible Ascension, whom I had never before heard of and stand very much corrected. Upcoming in 2014, MDF has plans to host Mgla, Enthroned, and Taake, just to name a few. Hopefully Hoest can stay out of trouble for long enough to play a set in Baltimore, and hopefully he will have pants (dear god, let him have pants. I’ve already seen more of that guy than I want to).\n\nBlack Metal Pop Culture Is At Its Height\n\nBlack metal is gaining popularity outside the underground, for better or worse (hipsters are the new core kids, I ‘spose). However, this is not always a bad thing. Vegan Black Metal Chef, for instance, is working on a cookbook, and metal cookbooks are the best. Likewise, we got a multi-part web documentary on one man black metal projects that was quite illuminating. While the fascination of those whom Nathan Explosion would refer to as “regular jackoffs” has resulted in such happenings as the short film on black metal that aired early this year that I ultimately decided I couldn’t be okay with, this interest in black metal has also resulted in such awesomeness as the brand spanking new book, Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult. My copy just arrived in my hot little hands today, and my, if it doesn’t seem like a treasure trove. Have already heard great reviews from a trusted source on the Mayhem bits, and anyone who actually sees fit to provide Funeral Mist with their deserved place in the canon has my full attention. Looking forward to devouring this thing in the time left before school starts. And speaking of Funeral Mist…\n\nFuneral Mist is Alive\n\nIt lives! Arioch has seen fit to bless his followers with a box set that is pretty much of epic proportions. I am going to do an actual in depth review of the thing soon, but for the time being, suffice it to say that it is an extremely nice edition, and the sound is much improved, at least from the CDs that I have. Trisagion is a beautiful thing, not least of all because it is proof that Funeral Mist is still alive and kicking, at least for a while longer.\n\nVarg Gets, Predictably, and Actually Seemingly Unfairly, Arrested. Again.\n\nBack in July of this year, infamous murdering racist creepy DnD-picture-staging weirdo Varg Vikernes was arrested, again, along with his wife. Vikernes was stockpiling guns, apparently, and was, predictably, taken into custody because when you’re a famous, high profile criminal, and you’re stockpiling weapons, that’s what happens. From the reports that I’ve read, however, it seems to me that Vargy Varg is actually innocent of doing anything wrong this time. Nevertheless, Varg now has one more arrest on his record. Wonder what the French black metal guys think of him?\n\nVarg Quits Black Metal. Again.\n\nApparently everyone’s favorite church arsonist is also throwing in the towel in terms of composing black metal, again. As anyone who’s followed Burzum for longer than twenty minutes can tell you, this is not an uncommon occurrence. He’ll probably be back. But just in case he’s not, Varg’s played himself out with this little ditty, which is, once again, quite lovely.\n\nThe Lid Finally Blows Off on Blake Judd’s Shenanigans\n\nBlake Judd, notorious frontman of Nachtmystium, found himself having a very bad year indeed despite an apparently successful comeback last year that I actually blogged about. Silencing Machine made it onto my list of best albums for 2012, utilizing an original approach that blended black metal and industrial music, Mr. Judd got married, and everyone was so happy to hear that he was finally recovering from his legendary drug addiction. This year, Nachtmystium has been put on indefinite hiatus, rumors are circulating that Judd stole the name and project behind Hate Meditation (whose new release, Scars, is not bad at all), apparently his wife divorced him, and last I heard, he was behind bars in Cook County jail for ripping off countless people who never got the merch and stuff that he’d promised them, having tied up all of their money in… something. Projects. Drugs. Who knows. I don’t. All I know is that I met the guy last year, and he was really cheerful and nice to me and J, and I am sad to hear about all this, because it always sucks to find that people are not as nice as you thought they were.\n\nKim Carlsson Dyes Hypothermia Shirts With His Own Blood\n\nYeah. So that happened early in the year. Fascinating stuff; I decided, however, that Kim and I are just not close enough yet for me to feel comfortable owning a shirt that’s been mixed in his blood. And by that I mean that I don’t know him at all. They are one of a kind anyway. (And there aren’t any more available. Kim has, obviously, a limited amount of materials to work with).\n\nWatain Writes A Ballad\n\nAnd it’s pretty damned good, I think.\n\nRest in Peace, Euronymous\n\nI didn’t do a special post in his honor like I do normally, probably because August 10th was about the epicenter of my depressive meltdown that had been oncoming for about a year and a half. Nevertheless, we should always strive to remember our fallen brothers. Hail, Euronymous. Rest in peace.\n\n***\n\nAnd yes, actually, I’m listening through the new Horna right now, trying to scramble to hear as much new black metal as I can to draft your best of list. (Why does this track sound like Watain?)\n\n-Hagalaz\n\n(Thanks to Jamie for the title…)\n\nIt occurs to me that there are a number of albums out there that much of the black metal community seems to take offense to for whatever reason: Satyricon’s Now, Diabolical, Mayhem’s Grand Declaration of War, and Dissection’s Reinkaos to name a few. It also occurs to me that I tend to like these albums, for whatever reason. As someone who studies literature and is trained to pick things apart as well as my capacity for being bull-headed and enjoyment of playing devil’s advocate, I think that it would be both fun and enlightening to look at these albums, which Jamie calls the “stray mutts of extreme metal,” and figure out why exactly people have the aversion to them that they do, what merit they have, if any, and why it might be worth it to give them another listen (Note: I’m not going to touch Cold Lake. Even I can’t defend some things).\n\nI figured I would go easy on myself and start this segment by discussing an album that is very near and dear to my heart, and that I feel like I know like the back of my hand: Funeral Mist’s Maranatha. Released in 2009, Arioch made us wait five whole years for the thing and then a lot of people were disappointed by it, which I’m sure was frustrating for everyone involved. So let us delve into the common criticisms, as well as what people are really saying when they make them, and look at the possible merits of the album. Then, maybe you will be inspired to give it another shot, or at the very least, you can throw out some specific reasons why it bugged you.\n\nFuneral Mist- Maranatha (2009)\n\nThe Context: Funeral Mist’s Salvation, released circa 2003, is inarguably one of the greatest releases of the first decade of this century. Though a release mostly circulated through and to the black metal underground, Salvation was a milestone in the realm of Orthodox black metal (Arioch claims Ofermod as exact contemporaries and won’t take all the credit for starting the sub-sub-genre, but he certainly spear-headed it), and is considered by many to be proof of the salvation (see what I did there?) of the larger black metal scene. 2009’s Maranatha, by contrast, was lambasted by many of those same people, who, crushed, went home thinking that maybe Arioch wasn’t the savior they’d been hoping for.\n\nThe Complaints:\n\n1) It sounds too much like Marduk. Apparently. This is odd to me. I don’t think it sounds much like Marduk, although I can hear influence from Funeral Mist seeping into Marduk’s newer releases (parts of “Gospel of the Worm” from the new one have that kind of churning feel that Funeral Mist has). However, the reviewer I culled this from claims that Maranatha adopts too much of the blast beats and machine-gun fire from Marduk’s artillery (I’ll stop with the puns. I promise), and I am listing complaints. That’s a valid one. Too much leakage from outside influence.\n\n2) The experimentation on the album. Other complaints deal with the weirder aspects of Maranatha, mostly either how it was too experimental or not experimental enough. “White Stone” is particularly bizarre, and many people found it, and the rest of the album, to fail in terms of being compelling. I also read somewhere that “Blessed Curse” is 8 minutes too long. It’s a long song. It’s a little repetitive, and that preacher guy is creepy and annoying. Experimental albums are risky; these reviewers complain that the risks didn’t work out.\n\nAnother complaint that can be classified under experimentation is consistency. It is said that there is none, that the album is not coherent, that it feels scattered, the screams are too random, the thing is a muddled mess.\n\n3) It is contrived. This is a complaint I have seen A LOT concerning Maranatha. So it was experimental; many people also believe that the vocals and music just sound disingenuous. It doesn’t have the spontaneous ugliness that Salvation had, it’s too planned, too insincere.\n\nWhat They Really Mean:\n\n1) “It sounds too much like Marduk.” Translation: “It’s too linear.” I don’t think Maranatha sounds like Marduk. I do think, however, that what these people are trying to say is that Maranatha is a very linear album. It has A LOT of blast beats. It is very forward-pressing. There are a couple of mid-paced tracks on the album, but most of it is in your face, brutal pummeling. But I don’t think that sounds like Marduk. Musically (atonally) I think it sounds more like Deathspell Omega. Abrasive swirling murk indeed. It is a lot more straightforward than anything on Salvation, however, and I think that this is what these reviewers are trying to get at.\n\n2) Complaints about experimentation. Translation: “This is weird and I don’t know how to approach it.” Experimentation is always risky. Throwing on a track like “White Stone,” which Arioch even contends is weird, is a big risk, especially when your fans are expecting something big from you. I’m not saying that you should like it just because it’s strange and Arioch worked hard on it, and this complaint really is a matter of opinion. I think that “White Stone” is creepy as hell; ugly and creepy is not always synonymous with fast and brutal. Arioch took a risk. Some people didn’t like it. “But Blessed Curse is 8 minutes too long.” Have you ever sat through one of those hellfire and brimstone sermons? They go on forever too.\n\nLikewise, the consistency argument. The complaint here, I think, is that the experimental bits are throwing people off. How does “Anti-Flesh Nimbus” fit into all this? Is there a theme here? Is it about Armageddon, or the Black Death, or both? What the hell is up with that preacher guy? Assuming that the album was not meant as a concept piece, this complaint feels a little weird to me, but I guess I can see how it could feel scattered with a song like “White Stone” right next to “Jesus Saves” (that weird little bit at the end of that song is one of my favorite parts on the album).\n\n3) “It is contrived.” Translation: “It’s too clean, and it contains too much that doesn’t feel real.” There are a lot of moments on the album where Arioch is doing things with his vocals that no mortal man can do, regardless of how close he is with the big guy down below. So Arioch meddled a little with the editing on the vocals. There was some of this on Salvation, too, if you were paying attention, although there’s more of it here. I think that this complaint also fits in with the cleaner recording complaint that always comes up in black metal. Maranatha is not all that grungy sounding, and admittedly, a low-fi recording may have helped make it sound less polished and more to these reviewers’ taste.\n\nBUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, what I hear the most when I hear people complain about Maranatha is “But it’s not Salvation.” And therein, I think, lies the problem.\n\nWhy It Has Merit:\n\n1) The experimentation (yes, groan, I know). Maranatha is a highly experimental album that finds new ways to approach the same kinds of subjects that normally crop up in black metal. “White Stone,” for instance, is very dirge-like, and the vocals sound anguished, which fits the subject matter of being denied nearness to one’s god. “Blessed Curse” (I have sat through those sermons, I know) to me feels like a Burzum-esque atmospheric track that should allow you to get lost in its meanderings. “Anti-Flesh Nimbus” is absolutely lovely, and it’s unlike anything else from Funeral Mist’s catalog. Perhaps these experimentations didn’t go over so well across the board; the fact of the matter is, Arioch is coming up with new ways to represent these things, and is certainly not willing to let the genre stagnate.\n\n2) I feel that it is a very cohesive album. A lot of the songs, with the exception of the ones above, seem to be connected in terms of musical execution and theme. There’s this kind of madness through the entire thing that makes your heart race and your brain reel. This is the way the world ends… Ultimately, the song that sticks out like a sore thumb is “Anti-Flesh Nimbus,” and it is, I think, the best song on the album, so I don’t understand what all y’all’s problem is.\n\n3) It is UGLY. Funeral Mist is really good at creating soundscapes that sound like the bowels of Hell have just opened up in your living room. Maranatha is no exception. The title track, “Jesus Saves,” “Sword of Faith…” all of these and more are some of the most hideous cacophony ever. Funeral Mist has lost none of its brutality. “Anti-Flesh Nimbus” is horrific and beautiful simultaneously, and ties the whole thing together nicely.\n\n4) The vocals are really cool. Okay, so that one guy thought the shrieks and screams were random, but do you honestly think that Arioch would ever put in anything randomly? Sure, not everything could be recreated live, but Funeral Mist doesn’t play live, so I think we can cut him some slack on that front. Also, if you think of the album as a piece of art, I think you can allow the weird editing. Since “A New Light” will likely never be played live, can we not allow for the album to stand as a work of art? Is it really necessary to be able to recreate it in a live setting?\n\nWhy You Should Give it Another Chance:\n\nThis point I’m going to make in reference to Maranatha as an album but also in reference to the complaints and whingings: MARANATHA IS NOT SALVATION. It’s not. I believe that the number one problem people have with this album, the one that they won’t admit, is that they are upset that it is not Salvation Part II. Arioch did not intend to make Salvation Part II. He wanted to do something different. Try not to listen to Maranatha and always place it in comparison; I encourage you to listen to it and value it for its own merits, which are plenty.\n\nSalvation was a ground-breaking and fantastic album, and it’s going to be very hard for anything that comes after in Funeral Mist’s catalog to compare with it. So perhaps we shouldn’t try to. Maranatha is an ambitious, experimental, ugly, beautiful album, and it should be allowed to stand on its own.\n\n***\n\nAnyway, I hope this was as fun for you as it was for me (I love analyzing things, that’s why I do what I do). I’ll be back Thursday with some other stuff.\n\nIn the meantime, give Maranatha another chance. (And then go listen to some Krieg; it’s excellent weather for it).\n\n-Hagalaz\n\nFor the final installment (for now) of my serial on French black metal, I thought I would address a couple of the French labels that have been very influential in the development of both the French scene and the black metal scene in general.\n\nSeason of Mist\n\nFounded in 1996 by Michael S. Berberian, Season of Mist has become a quite famous label and distributor for black metal in particular, although they also release a lot of death metal, pagan metal, avant-garde, and all the other genres us black metal fans find ourselves listening to frequently. Although the label was started in and still has an operation in Marseilles, they also have a Philadelphia office and a partnership with EMI that helps them distribute in the U.S.\n\n[Mayhem’s Grand Declaration of War was the first big black metal release from SOM, which initiated their taking on more black metal bands]\n\nPerhaps the turning point for Season of Mist was their signing of Mayhem and subsequent release of Grand Declaration of War. A controversial album even among fans, this release had to have been a huge risk for the label to take (although I think the album has a lot of merit. There’s a post in there somewhere). Signing a groundbreaker like Mayhem always comes with advantages, however, and soon SOM found themselves with a slew of black metal bands on their hands.\n\n[Like Rotting Christ. Season of Mist collects groundbreaking black metal artists like I collect Mayhem bootlegs]\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Season of Mist’s name originates from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and, yes, also the Sandman volume Seasons of Mist (in which Lucifer retires and hands Hell over to Morpheus). It is also a line in Keats’ “To Autumn.” I personally think this is really rad, as I study literature, and I think it’s very fitting for a label that largely specializes in black metal. For a genre that is so pensive and often references literary sources (ooh, I need to blog about that), a line from Shakespeare is a good fit.\n\n[These guys were also on Season of Mist. Love this song]\n\nSome cool stuff that Season of Mist has put out recently include Watain’s brand spanking new box set o’ vinyls, which looks amazing. They are also re-releasing In Solitude’s first album.\n\nI have almost ordered something from their distro before, and though I completely screwed up my order (my fault, not theirs), they were very, very helpful in helping me sort out the situation.\n\n[Sideshow Symphonies was one of theirs, too. This has been one of my frequent listens in the past couple of months]\n\nNorma Evangelium Diaboli (Noevdia)\n\nNorma Evangelium Diaboli, or Noevdia, is one of the greatest little labels that few have heard of. Begun on January 1 of 2005 by people who remain largely anonymous, but at least one of whom is in Deathspell Omega (yes, that Deathspell Omega), Noevdia has dedicated itself to distributing and promoting bands in the Orthodox Black Metal scene. Of course, Deathspell Omega themselves are very dedicated to their brand of metaphysical Satanism; it makes sense that a label closely affiliated with them would reflect that.\n\n[Of course, they release DSO’s stuff]\n\nAs far as I can tell, Noevdia has yet to sign a band that is not completely awesome. Although they tend to stick with the Satanic black metal bands, they have signed the cream of the crop of that lot to their ranks over the years. Antaeus’ records were released on Noevdia, as were the works of Funeral Mist and Ofermod. Also on Noevdia is Teitanblood, who I didn’t realize I loved so much until just recently.\n\n[How do I love thee, Funeral Mist?]\n\nNoevdia’s website is aesthetically awesome. It’s all in pretty black and grey, and the images are really fantastic. You kind of have to do some investigating to figure stuff out as far as ordering goes, but then again, with the mastermind behind Deathspell Omega working for them, you don’t expect straightforward. It’s an old school way of doing things; you contact them by email and tell them your order, and then they calculate the price plus shipping. My experience with them this past summer was absolutely fantastic. They were very amiable and responded very quickly to my emails, and the turn-around for shipping was extremely fast.\n\n[Spanish black metal. Awesome]\n\nNoevdia is also partnered with The Ajna Offensive, who distributes their releases in the U.S. Typically, Ajna is my first stop for Noevdia artists, and hopefully I don’t have to try to hunt them down elsewhere (although I do attest to the label’s distribution. Like I said, they were wonderful when I ordered from them this summer). Please consider buying their bands’ stuff from them or from Ajna; both are small labels run by (really nice) people who are very dedicated to the music.\n\n[“Cut your flesh and worship Satan”- Antaeus (if I don’t come back from MDF with that t-shirt, I’ve failed somehow)]\n\n(Also, I’m aware that Season of Mist is re-releasing some of the older Noevdia catalog. I don’t know anything about it beyond that, but I will assume nothing nefarious until it’s shown me. If there’s a political issue with me discussing both these guys in the same post, let me know and I’ll fix it]\n\n***\n\nI’m working on trying to compile a best of list for the year, and it’s tricky. First it means I’m trying to listen to the new black metal stuff I haven’t heard yet, sometimes running into road blocks based on availability (as much as I’d love to just immediately buy them all, I can’t afford to). And then trying to pick the bests? Yikes. It has been a very good year for black metal. That’s a lot of pressure.\n\nAnyway, that’s coming up eventually as well as other stuff. Until next time.\n\n-Hagalaz\n\nA while back, Vince Neilstein from MetalSucks wrote a post saying that metal vocalists had outlived their usefulness. Most of them are crap, he said, and pondered the idea that the reason why we keep them around is because they fill a kind of void, that human beings just take comfort in hearing a human voice. He also advocated for more instrumental metal. [Here is the original post, as well as a couple of commentaries.]\n\nWell, I’m sure you all know how I initially reacted to this. “GASP! But what about X, Y, and Z?! No! Vocals are as much an instrument as the guitar is!” The function of the metal vocalist is too important to just shrug off. I mean, we really do need some kind of human connection, and many of the vocalists out there endeavor to do artistic things with their vocals. Of course, that is not always the case; I am forced to admit that Mr. Neilstein is right on the account that there are some extraordinarily terrible vocalists out there. However, since his post, I have been ruminating on some of the better ones, the ones on whose behalf I objected to Neilstein’s premise with such vehemence.\n\nSo let’s do it. Here are some of my all-time favorite black metal vocalists (in no particular order, except for Dead, who I tend to stick at the front of most things).\n\nDead (Morbid, Mayhem)\n\nSome people say that Dead is famous simply because he killed himself and not because he had any actual talent. Those people are philistines and should be disregarded. Dead is a bloody brilliant vocalist. Although I would argue that his best vocal work is with Morbid rather than with Mayhem, I also think that I would feel less certain about that if we had more studio work with Dead while he was in Mayhem. Dead’s vocals with Morbid are more of a raspy death rattle than the shrieks that he incorporates in his Mayhem work. Both, however, are creepy as all get out, and his knowledge of when to apply which vocals and how was impressive. Dead also has the added bonus of not being a very good singer, which makes his “la la la”s on songs like Disgusting Semla extremely endearing.\n\n[La la la la la!]\n\n[Have some Carnage. You don’t need to hear Freezing Moon again]\n\nArioch/Mortuus (Funeral Mist, Marduk, Triumphator)\n\nIn the same vein as Dead, Arioch (or Mortuus, or whatever he is going by now) has a very unique vocal style. He claims that he considers his voice as an instrument. Jamie says that Arioch is the Whitney Houston of black metal, and I reckon he’s pretty much right. Not only can the man belt out some of the ugliest screams and groans I’ve ever heard, but he does so on pitch. There’s a certain note (yes, note) that he hits in “Anti-Flesh Nimbus” that makes me convinced that he is also a very good singer. The fact that he has managed to do these kinds of vocals for as long as he has (he’s been pretty active since about 1996) without damaging his throat is impressive. One of the most versatile vocalists I have ever heard, his voice ranges from majestic adulations to frenzied screams. In my personal opinion, the best vocal cords/lungs in black metal.\n\n[Resisting the urge to post “Holy Poison” because I want you to hear the crazy screaming]\n\n[Been listening to this song a lot lately. And people say Marduk are a one trick pony. Pssshaw, I say]\n\nDagon (Inquisition)\n\nI really like Dagon’s vocals because he approaches the entire concept of black metal vocals from a whole other angle than most of his contemporaries. Dagon claims that he found the traditional shrieks of black metal to be increasingly cliched, and wanted to approach the music from a different perspective. Thus, Dagon’s weird, croaky, and inhuman chants were born. If Inquisition’s goal is to ask us to meditate on the cosmos and the metaphysical, Dagon’s bizarre, yet somehow soothing, chanting provides the perfect commentary.\n\n[I absolutely cannot wait for this to happen live]\n\nKim Carlsson (Lifelover/Hypothermia/Kyla/Life Is Pain/Kim has been in so many bands he has an “Etc.” by his name on Encyclopedia Metallum)\n\nA very over the top showman, it is tempting to want to dismiss Kim Carlsson because of his seeming enthusiasm to bleed all over everyone and everything as well as his vocals, because to be honest, he doesn’t have that good of a voice. This is precisely why I love his vocals, however. The guy makes do with what he has, and his vocals, while they may not be all that pretty, have a veritable ton of feeling behind them. Kim Carlsson’s shrieks are positively (negatively?) agonized, and are all the better for their lack of finesse. That raw edge is just what the doctor ordered if you are feeling that your blood needs curdling.\n\n[Never really could get into Lifelover, but I still dig the vocals]\n\n[Now that I can get behind]\n\nICS Vortex (Arcturus, Borknagar, Lamented Souls, solo work, ex-Dimmu Borgir)\n\nICS Vortex has, quite simply, one of the most awesome voices I have ever heard. His range is simply amazing, covering every inch of ground between harsh growls and vibrato-laden falsetto. A very versatile vocalist, he has sung for bands of every ilk, including doom metal, black metal, and avant garde. Very few singers can claim Vortex’s virtuosity, and songs like Arcturus’ “The Chaos Path” are indicative of his skill (I’m pretty sure they wrote that song just for him, or he wrote it, or something. I am convinced that there is not another vocalist in the world who could do justice to it in the way Vortex does). Also, Vortex seems like just about the nicest guy on the entire planet, with a goofy stage presence and a friendly smile. He is really good about interacting with his fans (he once left me a comment on MySpace back in the day, just, it would appear, to be nice and make a fan’s day). A personality to match his pipes.\n\n[The best Dimmu Borgir song. No, don’t argue. I’m right]\n\nAttila Csihar (Tormentor, Mayhem, and more bands than I could possibly ever name)\n\nIn terms of Mayhem’s vocalists, there seems to be endless debate as to who is the best. Attila, for some reason, often seems to get short shrift in this battle. I’ve never really understood why. He’s got a powerful voice, and he can actually sing as well (which is more than can be said for our poor friend Dead). His chanting on “De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas” is one of my favorite parts of that entire album; it’s instant chills. Also, Attila has a really fun stage persona; when I saw Mayhem about a year ago, he sang to a skull that he brought on stage with him and wore a cape. Besides his work with Mayhem, his band Tormentor (from his native Hungary) was groundbreaking in the early black metal underground. In interviews that I have seen with him, Attila seems like one of the kindest and most thoughtful guys in the black metal scene, making him someone I’d love to sit and have a beer with.\n\nE (Watain)\n\nErik Danielsson (or E) of Watain should win the award for biggest lungs on the smallest vocalist. His vocals are powerful and his stage presence is mighty, and even though Watain is not the Erik Danielsson show, his charisma on stage makes it hard to tear your eyes from him. Multi-talented, he also plays the bass on all of Watain’s albums (though they hire a bassist to tour with them so that he can focus on doing what he does). I particularly love the way he incorporates his vocals into Watain’s songs; someone on the interwebs once described E’s vocals as “slithering” in and out of the music, and I think that perhaps that is the best way to describe it. E has a way of knowing exactly how to incorporate the lyrics into the song, and that combined with the sheer emotion he exudes makes him a formidable force.\n\n[The first verse of this one is a good example of the “slithering” I mentioned]\n\nGarm (Ulver, Arcturus, Borknagar)\n\nGarm is another of those talented vocalists who has as lovely a singing voice as he has a scream. I love watching videos of Arcturus live and seeing Vortex sing the songs that Garm recorded with the band, because it becomes very clear in such instances what very different vocalists they are, though they have been in many of the same bands. Garm’s voice is a lot lower than Vortex’s, for instance, and he is much more comfortable with screaming and growling. Ulver’s early black metal albums are some of the most influential in the genre, also, and their later work, while often wildly experimental, is never not good.\n\n[One of my all time favorite songs]\n\nAbbath (Immortal, I)\n\nAbbath may have the most instantly recognizable voice in black metal. His grim and frostbitten croak was what originally lured me into the subgenre. Like Dagon from Inquisition, Abbath’s vocals are more of a croak than the shrieks that tend to define the genre, and even when he sings passages (like in “All Shall Fall”), his voice is raw and more raspy than clear. Abbath has often been said to sound like Popeye, and this mixture of seriousness with good-natured humor is one of the main reasons perhaps for Immortal’s continuous success.\n\nGaahl (Trelldom, God Seed, Gorgoroth)\n\nGaahl and King ov Hell’s less than amicable split with Gorgoroth left a lot of fans feeling hurt and confused and understandably resentful, but regardless of how you feel about the Gorgoroth incident, you have to admit that Gaahl does some great vocals. His voice sounds almost violent (is the only way I can think of to describe it), and certainly inhuman. With just the right amount of shriek, Gaahl is able to keep in line with the traditional vocals while still maintaining a unique sound. The result is something really quite nightmarish. His band Trelldom is also quite good, and unfortunately often overlooked. Sorry kids, Gaahl is my favorite Gorgoroth vocalist, yes, even more than Pest, whose voice I can only stand when the recording doesn’t sound like it was done on a tape recorder in someone’s bathroom.\n\n[I didn’t tag this as NSFW, so you can watch the video on your own time]\n\n***\n\nIn short, I think metal vocalists are still relevant. At length… everything I just typed. So what do you all think? Do you think that vocalists are important to the genre of metal? Who are some of your favorite black metal vocalists?\n\nStay tuned, I’ll be covering Melechesh before I go to see them on Friday (oh my gosh. So excited. What a show, and Melechesh and Inquisition are the OPENERS).\n\nStay kvlt.\n\n-Hagalaz\n\nWeeeeelll, ladies and gentlemen, it’s my birthday. Which means that instead of an actual post, you shall get a gratuitous, “hey everyone this is what I like” post. So shortly following will be a playlist I strung together for my birthday.\n\nFirst of all, though, I wanted to express my excitement over my birthday present. I was actually at WalMart (I normally avoid WalMart like the plague; I forgot that they sometimes have stuff) getting some universal remote controls when I stumbled upon this little gem. I had a gift card from forever ago which I’ve never used, because I don’t ever go to WalMart, and my mom paid for part of it for my birthday gift.\n\nIt’s a 5 in 1 music player, which is pretty much exactly what I needed. I wanted something I could play my CDs on that had bigger sound than a boom box (this has stereo sound), a tape player, and a turntable. And this has all of that! And a line in for an mp3 player. Awesome. It makes just enough noise for my small apartment, and it’s got good sound for the price. I’m really excited about it, because now I can start buying records. I have often longed to hear Emperor on vinyl; now maybe I can.\n\nI also managed to track down a Funeral Mist shirt. It’s much too big for me to wear, but I plan on making art of it anyhow (although I am keeping an eye out for one in my size as well for the reason of actually being able to wear a Funeral Mist shirt).\n\nSo now, for the playlist! (It goes to 11, as all things metal should, and also because 11 is the biblical number for chaos and “symbolizes the potential to push the limitations of the human experience into the stratosphere of the highest spiritual perception; the link between the mortal and the immortal; between man and spirit; between darkness and light; ignorance and enlightenment.” (Numerology.com)\n\n1. The Devil’s Blood- Voodoo Dust\n\nThe Devil’s Blood is one of my favorite bands right now. I recently saw them on the Decibel Tour and ye gods were they amazing. The Mouth of Satan (as she goes by) has an amazing voice.\n\n2. Deathspell Omega- The Shrine of Mad Laughter\n\nI just recently acquired my first DSO album, and it’s not this one. They are part of the same trilogy of albums, however, based on god, Satan, and man’s relationship to both. DSO is black metal taken to its (il?)logical conclusion, kind of like Abruptum. A structured cacophany. Fraaance.\n\n3. Mayhem- Freezing Moon\n\nThis one is always on rotation, always. Mayhem knocked me off my feet the first time I heard them, and they, along with Funeral Mist, are probably by favorite metal band ever. This particular version my friend claims is the “best seven minutes in recorded black metal history.”\n\n4. Agalloch- Faustian Echoes\n\nBrand spanking new from Agalloch! Hot off the press! I get to see these guys in a couple of weeks and I’m stoked about it. I’m really digging this song right now, too, because I actually study Renaissance drama, and Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus is my favorite play.\n\n“Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed\n\nIn one self place, for where we are is hell,\n\nAnd where hell is must we ever be.\n\nAnd, to conclude, when all the world dissolves,\n\nAnd every creature shall be purified,\n\nAll places shall be hell that is not heaven.”\n\n5. Marduk- World of Blades\n\nI think everyone who reads this knows how I feel about Marduk, and if you want, you can read how I feel about their new album, too (in previous posts). My favorite album of the year so far. This track is one of my favorites (dat bass). (Also, stupid YouTube commentors are stupid.)\n\n6. In Solitude- To Her Darkness\n\nThe first time I heard In Solitude I appreciated it because I appreciate metal, but I thought it really wasn’t my style. Since seeing them live I’ve become quite a fan. They are fantastic musicians for their age, and they are very nice as well. This is my favorite off their latest, and it is also their new video!\n\n7. Morbid- From the Dark\n\nBack in February I said something about how it was a good day for Morbid’s “Disgusting Semla,” and got the remark “when do you ever think it’s NOT a good day for Dead?” Which is a good point. I like his voice with Morbid even better than with Mayhem.\n\n8. Immortal- Where Dark and Light Don’t Differ\n\nImmortal is great. They were the first band I really got into in terms of heavy black metal, probably because they are so thrashy. I have always loved them and their approach to black metal, and this album is my favorite.\n\n9. Azarath- Throne of Skulls\n\nAzarath is one that I have just recently learned of. They do that blackened death metal thing that Poland is so good at, and Inferno from Behemoth is also their drummer. He is one of my favorite drummers, and I am very fortunate to have seen him live.\n\n10. Funeral Mist- Anti-Flesh Nimbus\n\nI have lost track of how many times I have heard this song, and it never, ever, ever gets old to me. It’s hideous and beautiful, terrifying and inspiring. In other words, everything I love about Funeral Mist in one nice little package.\n\n11. Watain- The Waters of Ain\n\nThis song is for endings. I’d say it’s in my top three of favorite songs ever. It is Watain’s magnum opus, and it even features Selim from The Devil’s Blood. Even when they start touring for a new album cycle, I hope they still end with this one. I can’t believe I *almost* saw Watain two nights in a row! (Damned visa problems).\n\nWell, that’s it. That’s the gratuitous birthday playlist of things I am currently obsessed with (or eleven of them, at any rate). Hopefully you will get some enjoyment out of some of my personal favorites.\n\nI shall be back with reviews soon. Next up, the new Naglfar.\n\nUntil then,\n\n-Hagalaz\n\nGavin Baddeley’s Lucifer Rising: Sin, Devil Worship and Rock and Roll is another book that my friend loaned me for research on my black metal paper. The book is largely about Satan and Satanism in pop culture, so the references to metal are supplemented by the surrounding events in the larger cultural sphere at various times. Although this book deals less specifically with black metal in particular, I much preferred it to Lords of Chaos.\n\nMr. Baddeley clearly did a lot of research in the writing of this book, and his sources span a large amount of time. During his writing of the book he actually became a card-carrying member of the Church of Satan, and Anton LaVey allegedly told him that he was a “smart cookie.” Despite his own personal alliance with the CoS, however, Baddeley presents his information on other Satanic organizations without being derogatory. It’s easy to see where his opinion lies- he’s super snarky- but he tends to be critical across the board and is always more informational than anything. He’s also not dismissive of theistic Satanism in the way that I felt that Moynihan was in Lords of Chaos either, which was one of the things that made me bristle when reading that book.\n\nThe interaction between the music aspects of the book and the pop-culture references is really cool. For instance, the take-over of heavy metal in the 80s is put up against the backdrop of the “Satanic panic” witch-hunts in the United States, in which it was believed that cults involved in a Satanic conspiracy were practicing ritual abuse on and abducting children. Likewise, Baddeley looks at the connection between Satanism and many of the more famous serial killers- and undermines the argument that they were Satanists in most cases. The book also details the rise of the Church of Satan in response to the hippie movement and talks about the Process Church and their music.\n\n[Some re-recorded Process Church music by Sabbath Assembly. This stuff is cool.]\n\nIncidentally, one of the Process Church’s magazines used the same cover art as Funeral Mist’s Devilry EP, which I thought was interesting. One of the best parts of the book, I think, is the intersection where metal and pop-culture cross over.\n\nAnother cool part is, like in Lords of Chaos, the interviews. Baddeley talked with LaVey quite a bit. He also interviewed many other major Satanists in pop-culture, like Kenneth Anger, as well as the leaders of some Satanic organizations. There is also, for us black metal geeks, a late interview with Euronymous, who discusses his own views of the Devil and black metal.\n\nI was a little confused as to what Baddeley meant when he talked about “black metal.” Of course the first and second waves are black metal, and Venom, but he did seem to be a little less exclusive with the term than I am. What other black metal bands were contemporary with Venom? I don’t know, and so that was a little confusing to me. Other than that minor confusion, however, I didn’t have any problems with this book. Baddeley is irreverent while maintaining an underlying seriousness. He’s snarky and I like that. His opinion of Moynihan also seems to be much like mine, which I will admit made me feel a little smug. Moynihan was an interviewee as well, which was kind of cool because you get to see the man not necessarily attempting to be objective like he was in writing his book. It’s easy to see where some of Moynihan’s biases lie and helps to contextualize some of the weirder parts of Lords of Chaos.\n\nThe illustrations were also really cool, and I was happy to see that the cover illustration was actually done by an American. I at first thought it was H.R. Giger, but I was wrong. It’s cool to see some Satanic artwork from my own home front. I also really loved the historical bits in the beginning, particularly Baddeley’s discussion of the gnostic cults, as that is a kind of Satanism that is very fascinating to me. I will need to do some more reading on this, clearly.\n\nSo if you are looking for a book on black metal in particular, this book may not be exactly what you need. Lords of Chaos, for all its problems, does actually address the scene itself a little better (though if you want straight from the source, pure, unaltered black metal you should read The Slayer Mag Diaries). As far as widening the scope, though, Lucifer Rising is the way to go. Unlike Lords of Chaos, it doesn’t get so close that you can’t see the forest for the trees at times, and Baddeley places the metal scene in context with the larger representations of Satan in pop-culture, helping to show how the two interacted with each other. It’s a fun and interesting read and I highly recommend it.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nHagalaz\n\n**Thought I’d mention edits- I’m tweaking my post on the new Marduk album a little, and I’m also adding a note on the distros page concerning the back patches (see below). I will more than likely have another post up this week, but maybe not on Thursday.**\n\nSo, this post is late, and I know it is, and that’s because we drove into town at 6:30 AM Sunday and I spent most of the day in a cloud of sleep deprivation. I wrote part of this Monday when I was a little more awake and then traveled 10.5 hours home Tuesday. So now that that is all over, I can chronicle the greatest concert experience of my life.\n\nFirst off, Friday night my friend and I had a watch party for the new Watain DVD, Opus Diaboli. It’s amazing, and you should try to get a copy if you can (it’s been hard to get a hold of. We had to resort to YouTube, although we’ve got copies coming. They are, however, imports- the box set seems to be the only version released in the U.S. right now and although I’m enough of a Watain fangirl to own one, I am also a poor student and am therefore forced to not be quite so fiscally irresponsible). In honor of the old school scene we had cheap screwdrivers because we’re adults and don’t have to wait for our orange juice to ferment, and I baked black metal/Watain cupcakes.\n\nMy only stipulation was that I got to eat my Dead cupcake.\n\nIt was only a few people, but it was fun, and the cupcakes were a smash. They were (of course) devils food, some with chocolate icing and some with cream cheese icing.\n\nBut then- then Saturday we headed up to St. Paul to see Marduk! A couple of local bands from the Twin Cities opened, and they were both really good. I believe it was Drona’s first show, so I can’t find any video of them, but they were excellent.\n\nGood old fashioned black metal. The second band, Burning Bethlehem, was also really good (although my friend and at least one other guy heard “Burning Meth Lab”- they should invest in a banner with their name on it so no one is confused because man, that’s a big difference). I was particularly impressed by their vocalist, who has got a good scream on him. I talked to their drummer a bit and he said it was only their second show, but they played very well together. I’m looking forward to getting to see more of both these bands.\n\n[Rawr! They have a YouTube channel. Check it out!]\n\nI then went back to the merch stand to go ahead and get my stuff, and I’m glad I did, because the Marduk shirts in the small sizes were quickly dwindling. I picked up this one in a medium.\n\nThe 1349 shirts were still available in smaller sizes and I got a small of this one. I decided to get the one with the dates on since I didn’t get the Marduk one with dates.\n\nThe guy running the merch booth was really nice and took good care of me. He made sure I got all my stuff signed- although more on that later. I also picked up a Morbid patch for the battle jacket, and I learned that my Funeral Mist back patch is a bootleg! I’m a little mortified, and now I’m trying to figure out how to make this right. My thought right now is to track down a couple of shirts so I can perform surgery on one and make my own back patch (the other I would of course wear everywhere). I wanted Funeral Mist to get the premier spot on my jacket, but I also want Arioch to get paid for it. He’s brilliant and very dedicated to what he does, so I figure the least I can do to show my appreciation is make sure he gets his dues.\n\nBecause I was hanging out with my new friend I missed the first part of Weapon’s set, but I got to see about the last half. They were really good- I’m going to be keeping an eye out for them in the future. I was a little distracted because I was torn between being bummed that my patch is a bootleg and being glad I didn’t wear my jacket after all (it was in the 90s and I don’t believe they had the air on. Thanks, Minnesota, but if I’d wanted hot weather I’d have stayed in the South), so I didn’t pay as much attention as I should have.\n\n[Weapon- a band that deserves a much more attentive audience than me]\n\nNext up was Withered, who opened for Marduk the first time I saw them in Des Moines a couple of years ago. They destroyed. Dude. Withered was great last time, but they have gotten even better live since then. My friend picked up one of their albums, too, and they are just as excellent on a recording. They play kind of sludgy black/death metal, and it is heavy stuff. If you catch this tour (and you should totally catch this tour), make sure you’re around when Withered plays. I’m going to have to watch them a little more closely from here out.\n\n[Us Southerners do black metal very well, if I do say so myself.]\n\nI was really excited to see 1349’s set- they’re a band I’ve always wanted to see live. Their set was fantastic. Their bassist wore these heavy robes the entire time, which is amazing because it was horribly hot. I was drenched in sweat, so I can only imagine what it would be like to be wearing robes through a whole set under stage lighting. Ravn had some crazy gauntlets on; they looked like they had railroad spikes sticking out of them. They were sharp too- after they played he climbed down into the area between the rail and the stage to high five people in the crowd and I caught my hand on one. Ouch.\n\n[This is not from the other night. But Ravn was wearing the same Hellhammer t-shirt]\n\nAs that was happening, however, I felt a slight tap on my upper arm. I thought “no way,” and sure enough, Archaon had thrown a pick into the crowd and it had stuck on my arm! (Seriously. Really sweaty). I’ve never caught a pick before, and I’ve been doing this for a while, so it’s about time!\n\nThen it was time for the mighty Marduk! I had come to get my face melted and they delivered (also, it was so hot in there my makeup literally melted). They played a variety of songs from through their entire career, so there was something for everyone. The only song they played from the new album was the title track, but it was cool to hear the major chords live. They also let Devo have the spotlight for a couple of minutes which was nice- that guy is a fantastic bassist, and one of the things I’ve always appreciated about Marduk is that they utilize the bass really well instead of mixing it out completely like so many black metal bands. I managed to catch his eye at one point, too, and he threw me the horns.\n\n[This isn’t from the other night either. But they did play Womb of Perishableness even if there was no fire, alas. Also this is a really cool video]\n\nThe sound was really good as well, which is nice. Last time at the Mews I felt like the settings were way too trebly, and this time I could hear Morgan a lot better as well as the bass. And Mortuus- ye gods, I will never tire of that guy’s voice. He is absolutely amazing, and watching him live is always a treat.\n\nSo after Marduk’s set, my friend Jamie and I decided to go camp by the bus and see if we could get my stuff signed. They took off to get food, so we were sitting outside for a bit, but it worked out for the best- Archaon from 1349 came out of the bus and we talked to him for probably 20 minutes about touring in Texas and Minnesota breweries. I had brought along my Slayer ‘zine (a guy from their crew had glanced through it earlier. It’s a fun way to meet people, and I think I should maybe consider wagging it with me everywhere) and he flipped through it and was commenting on several of the articles and pictures, which was really cool. When you’re in the Midwest U.S. it’s easy to forget how small the scene actually is, and hearing him talk about things like actually going to the “rebirth of Dissection” show was a really cool and unique experience.\n\nShortly after he got back on the bus the guys from Marduk came back from dinner and I got to meet them all (rather quickly- they had to run). I did get to tell Morgan that Marduk was my first black metal concert two years ago, however, which was fun for me, and I got to talk to Devo for a moment or two. They all signed my CD case/book, and Mortuus signed my Funeral Mist interview from my Slayer ‘zine (as Arioch).\n\nThey were all really nice and polite despite being exhausted, I’m sure. It was a fantastic end to an amazing show. I wish I had longer to talk to them because I have SO MANY things I’d like to ask them, but that will have to wait until next time (because it’s not like I will ever pass up an opportunity to see Marduk. They have a very special place in my heart, as I’m sure anyone who has ever looked at this blog can tell). I scored the crown jewels of my autograph collection, and I FINALLY caught something from one of the bands! It was pretty much the best experience I’ve had at a concert.\n\nNow to just figure out my jacket…\n\nUntil next time,\n\nHagalaz\n\n**EDIT**\n\nA video appeared of Drona! Here they are- check them out! (I’m totally in this video too!)\n\n-Hagalaz"
