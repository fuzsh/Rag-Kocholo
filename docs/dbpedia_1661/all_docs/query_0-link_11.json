While he's headed for the Aegean just as the British sun finally shows its fairly fearsome face, his underlings sprawl in pub chairs on the gum-stained \\ / tarmac outside King 's Reach Tower, slowly roasting in the blistering heat. With skin- tones varying from boiled shrimp to satsuma we shout random lyrics from Armand Van Helden’s filthy ‘I Can Smell U’ at bewildered passers by. We drink absinthe cocktails, roar at our own wit and raise endless toasts to acid house, tribal chuggers and breakbeat garage. And also, of course, to this issue - cos it’s a corkerl Check it - our man in the Balearics gets fruity with the laydeez at Space (oh, and garners the club’s whole history); our man in Johannesburg gets the low-down on the township club scene; our man with the exposed bum-cleavage helps out on the road with Felix Da Housecat; and Bedroom Bedlam goes out and about with Sasha and BB winner James Zabiela. From these opening words to Marc Almond’s final page wisdom, it is, as Morillo’s so fond of repeating, all good. Now I must away and carry a nameless member of staff out of the public eye, fortheirown dignity, you understand. If I can stand up, that is. . .

Stratford upon Avon, Warwickshire GODSKITCHEN have thought long and hard about how to make this night stand out as one of the best nights ever in clubland, something completely different from the rest. Months of planning have gone into covering everything from DJ line-ups, to sound and lighting, attractions and decor and the result, is the GLOBAL GATHERING. We firmly believe that we have devised a festival that no one will have ever witnessed before, where the music will be perfect all night and the atmosphere simply electric. 25,000 dance music enthusiasts will witness what will possibly be the most extreme dance music festival ever. We will be building a virtual entertainment complex featuring six of the most spectacular dance arenas playing host to over 75 of the worlds leading DJs, with more being confirmed every day. The production in these arenas will be out of this world, with each one being themed individually using huge stage sets alongside the latest technology In sound and lighting enabling Global Gathering to deliver a production spectacular beyond anyone's highest expectations. And whilst the production in the arenas will be phenomenal, outside will be beyond belief. As you walk out of the six breathtaking dance arenas you will witness a sight that no dance festival has ever seen. Placed around the site and above the arenas will be huge inflatable characters and visual spectacles; a 25ft high dancing cow, an enormous zeppelin, inflatable rocket ships seeming to take off into the night sky, a 100ft long dragon breathing fire and smoke, 30ft tall inflatable animals everywhere, surrounded by vast luminous planets floating eerily above the arenas! For chill out arenas, imagine tents draped out as harems for you to lie and relax in whilst being served by sumptuous belly dancers. Imagine two hundred street performers dressed as various weird and wonderful fantastical characters such as Alice in Wonderland running around all night servicing your every whim and the fantasy is nearly complete Surrounding the site will be attractions to stun your senses. Look left and you'll see a Scad Drop, look right at a bungee, swimming pools and free fall simulators. Look up in wonderment at the overhead rollercoaster and be dazzled by the lasers shooting into the night sky. Look around at video screens broadcasting the event to different areas of the site, whilst the images are simultaneously beamed across the Globe to other events and clubs. These are just a small selection of things that can be expected from the Godskitchen Global Gathering. A festival is about music but also a night of shared experiences and heightened exaltation; somewhere to lose yourself, discover new friends and take with you memories to last a lifetime Memories that just might change your life.

ERICSSON ^ Letter Of .The Month Dear Sir/Madam, Over the last fevy/ years, I have seen a great deal of bigotry and hatred shown towards different styles of ‘dance music’ from reviewers. I see them as a new breed of ‘anal chin strokers’, spitting hatred at anything that doesn’t match their musical tastes, not giving a flying fuck about the feelings or the hopes that they shit on with their ‘constructive criticism’ . In future if the record, DJ orformat isn’ttheir cup of tea the magazine should simply not publish their obsessed hatred of it. Keep the faith, DJ Johnny Bel) Thanks Johnny. We showed your letter to our reviewers and they replied: “DJ Johnny’s letter is a load of old cack biscuits. His outmoded use of the phrase ‘anal chin strokers’ reveals him to be a man living in the past. This is his first letter to Muzik. We hope it will be his last.” Dr Bob Jones, however, awarded it five stars, so don’tbe downhearted. El Hard house: Shit? Dear Muzik, In response to the letter from Ben Stevens, Derby (issue 74) and the Deep Dish “hard house is shit” debate. Unfortunately kidda, hard house IS shit! As you mature into later life (although I have no idea how old you are) you ' II realise that music is meant to be food for the soul. It's this that touches you inside (no pun intended) and makes you laugh, cry, dance! Without that delicate touch, hard house is doomed, my friend! Chris Gibson, Newcastle Re: Ben Stevens Sorry, Ben, hard house IS shit. The new hardcore, my arse. The new HAPPY hardcore would be a more accurate description, I think. THEM BUZZ, via e-mail Readers, we must know. Is hard house shit? Or is it great? Ring our ‘Hard house: Is it shit or is it great?’ hotline on 020-7261 -5933 and let us know your views on this issue. E Blake’s Heaven Dear Muzik, It’s a slightly pedantic point, but the William Blake quote (Decade Raid, issue 74) is \"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom\". Another good one is “The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship”. Big up to the visionaries! Ray De Showssay, via e-mail Bet Ministry don’t get letters like this. E Compilation indignation Dear Muzik, With thousands of crap mix CDs being released each month and selling shitloads. I’ve decided to get in on the action and I’m going to release ‘Now That What I Call UK Hard Breakbeat Ibiza Chill Out Garage House In The World Ever Vol 1 '. Nowall I have to do is get Judge Tongenfold to mix it. Peter Dancer, County Wicklow You missed out key words such as ‘deep’, ‘progressive’, ‘The Sound Of. . .’ and ‘. . . Sessions’, so you’ve got fuck-all chance, Peter. Sorry. E Letters From America We’ve had several letters from Americans annoyed by European arrogance. The words ‘pot’ and ‘kettle’ spring to mind. Dear Muzik, The other day I was sitting on the can reading the June issue of your magazine [Enduring image. Cheers -Ed.] and I got the distinct impression you feel that the American scene is just waiting for Europeans to come over and teach us howto party. This isn’t true. Let me remind you of something you’ve either forgotten or never knew in the first place: in America, yuppies go to clubs, kids go to raves. Yes, I said it, the dirty ‘R’ word. American ‘club kids’ get turned off by huge crowds and corporate mega- clubs. Baggy pants, sports bras, and glowsticks are in, dress codes, tight-ass pants, and commercial tunes are out. The UK may be the leader in ‘club culture’, but you guys have neglected the ‘dance’ part of dance music. I don’t Write to Mouth Off at Muzik, IPC Media, King’s Reach Tower, Stamford Street, London SE1 9LS. Ore-mail us at muzik@ipcmedia.com Please Include your name and address. IPC Media reserves the right to re-use any submissions senttothe letters column of Muzik in any format or medium know what kind of drugs you do, but us Yanks take the ones that make us dance, not just stand in one place and pretend to move our hips. We don’t need Europeans telling us howto party, we’ve been doing it our own way for a long time. Mark Bryan, Washington DC Dear Muzik, As a British ex-pat living in San Francisco, I found your ‘ UK Clubland Cracks America’ cover story inaccurate and embarrassing. America has avast, largely untapped dance market, but the Americans are already fed up with the patronising tone that the British DJs, press and clubs take towards the scene here. Roger Kemp, San Francisco Alright, alright, the American scene’s great, and we Europeans are lucky to be there. Read the editor’s letter in issue 73, and you’ll find we said just that, then. E Gorillas In Our Midst Dear Muzik, Love the mag , but the release of Basement Jaxx's simian-themed ‘Rooty’ has made me realise you don’t carry enough pictures of gorillas, apes, gibbons and other similar species (Oakey aside). Could you please rectify this? Alan Hedge, Bournemouth Happy to oblige, Alan. . .

The finals, in conjunction with Missdemeanours, took place last month in London, at a completely rammed AKA bar, with 2Funky and Norman Jay providing the after-battle entertainment. The joint winners were Keiron Hart and Sacha Pullin, who split the Vestax mixer and decks between them, and who each landed future slots at Serious at The Cross. By day a Tree Officer for Woking Borough Council, Keiron, 27, enthused, “It was excellent! Especially speaking to Norman Jay - he’s a DJ I’ve got a lot of respect for. And meeting Sacha was good - we got on well immediately.” Pullin (also 27, and a teacher of DJing and sound engineering in Sheffield) 2 agreed: “It was surreal and I 5 didn’t expect to win, but it I was nice that Keiron and I g hit it off.

Joey Beltram Energy Flash (R&S) MUZIK ISN’T given to hyperbole, but ‘Energy Flash’ must be in the running for the greatest post-acid house dancefloor tune of all time. Forget yer ‘Unfinished Sympathy’, danced to at weddings and round coffee tables. Joey Beltram, an unreconstituted Slayer fan and techno head from New York, singlehandedly kick-started ‘proper’ hardcore with this monstrous juggernaut of echoing noise, signed first to Derrick May’s Transmat, then to Belgium’s R&S. Can you hum it? No chance, apart from going, “Bao-bao-ba-ba-bao”, which doesn’t count.

God’s Kitchen and your favourite phalanx of pen-brandishing music experts (that’s us, obviously) have joined forces to bring you the best night of the whole summer. To business. The event takes place on Saturday July 28th, and not only offers a storming line-up but also a staggering range of other, bizarre entertainments. God’s Kitchen chief chef Chris Griffin explains: “Some festivals can be pretty boring visually, and although it is all about the music, I also think clubbers deserve more than just an excellent line-up. We wanted to build a kind of Disneyland, and 1 know people will clearly notice the difference. You’ll never have seen anything like this I\" No idle boast. Having spent millions on stage props, God’s Kitchen will bring you 25 foot high inflatable cows and pigs, huge banks of extra lights, lasers, TV screens, and a swimming pool. There’s also a bunch of rides to make your pints reappear on cue and your nervous system file for divorce. Try the rollercoaster, the scad drops, the zero gravity drop, the bungee jump, the reverse ejector seats and the ferris wheel. There’s even a 1 25 foot high fire-breathing dragon to greet you on arrival. And all that’s before you’ve checked out a single DJ. The six massive dance arenas (see right hand column for the full lowdown) boast a stellar line-up, including a live performance from headliners Chicane. “People will be blown away,’’ enthuses Chris. “God’s Kitchen has always been about great value and great entertainment. We’ve ploughed so much money into making this event look extraordinary, and it’ll really pay off.” (?)

Stratford-upon-Avon MZK21 words SIMON MORRISON The world’s least fiery Latin on life after Cafe Del Mar SOME PEOPLE claim to have graced the dancefloors of Ibiza before 1 988’s Summer Of Love. Jose Padilla can justifiably claim to have done the same before disco. He arrived on the island from the mainland in 1 975 in a quest for adventui e and enlightenment and found his niche behind the decks at Cafe Del Mar, playing the sunset sets and recording the chill out albums that became one of the island’s trademarks. Why have you called your new album ‘Navigator’? Every track tells a different story, so it’s a way of navigating through all those experiences, using the music. Is the track ‘Adios Ayer’ about your departure from Cafe Del Mar? When I do a tiack or a piece of music it is because of my emotions so that’s what I wanted to express - it was Cafe Del Mar, it was my girlfriend, it was many things that I was leaving behind. Sometimes you have to move, you cannot take all the decisions. For me, music helped me a lot to make my negative emotions and sadness into positive. The album features two notable collaborations - how did they come about? I had the ‘Look Of Love’ cover version, and in Ibiza I couldn’t find that voice I wanted so I suggested names. I’m a big fan of N’Dea Davenport - I’ve loved her ever since she was in the Brand New Heavies, and I thought that she was right for the track. And we wanted to make ‘Adios Ayer’ appeal to more people so again we needed a voice. The company offered me different names and I split them into the ones I liked and the ones I didn’t. The one on the top was Seal. Do you enjoy weaving different influences into your music - from traditional flamenco to more contemporary drum patterns? The music is more Mediterranean, of course, because that’s my roots and that’s where I’m coming from. But if I travel to India then that music is in my head and that influences me; if I go to Brazil then Brazilian music will influence me. That’s the album - a mix of styles. I think in music you get very positive results from this fusion, from these experiments. Playing music as the sun sets, in front of the natural elements that feed into your own music - will you ever do that again? This is something that I did, so it’s finished for me. But of course sometimes I miss it, so maybe I will do it one day - when I get poor I’ll go past somewhere and play a few records. . . What do you think when you walk into a record store nowadays and see shelves stacked with Ibiza chill out albums? That’s the industry, isn’t it? Sometimes I feel proud that I started something that now is so big. Sometimes I feel pissed off because it’s just copies with little imagination - albums called Cafe Del This, Cafe Del That. . . it’s a bit sad, you know. If someone came to you and said “Jose, I need to chill the fuck out,’’ what would you suggest? The place. . . we all know the place can be anywhere. We always say in front of the sea watching the sunset, so now I’m going to say under a tree in Ibiza with a nice picnic, on a nice blanket, with a nice bottle of wine and a nice girlfriend. ‘Navigator’ is out now on East West 22 K/I21K ■^Fabric Saturdays Art direction: Loue m July Rfrt. 1 / Ralph Lawson Hu^^y Crai^ Richards Random Factor (Liue) Rm. 2 / Suburban Knight Ian O'Brien Tayo Rm. 3 / Amalgamation Of Soundz 21 July Rm. 1 / Tyler Stadius Lee Burrid^e Bill Brewster Rm. 2 / Terry Francis Adam Freeland Terry Mitchell Rm. 3 / Krash Slau^hta Mastomic 77a Charterhouse Street London ECl 10.00pm \" 7.00am £15.00 / £12.00 NUS T +44(0)20 733G 8898 WWW . f abriclondon . com 4 Ausfust Rm. 1 / Crai^ Richards ferry Francis Aril BriKha ’ (Liue) 1 / am Cliue Henry Rm. 2 / Paul Daley Crai^ Richards Terry Francis Nathcin Scott Rm. 3 / Dub Pistols Soundsystem July Rm. 2 / Keuin Saunderson Paul Dauis (Circulation) Technasia (Liue) Rm . 3 / I.G.

While other decksmen were booted out of the main arenas after a paltry 40 minutes or so, the baseball-capped Miami man refused to budge, swinging from the sublime angst- rock of The Smashing Pumpkins’ ‘ 1 979’ to the (faintly ridiculous) re-edit of Derek And The Dominos ’ ‘ Layla’ . Ed Chemical Opting for a last-minute holiday in the sun, Ed Chem (Mo from The Simpsons) left brother Tom in London for a brief summer holiday in the Balearics - his first white island experience in six years, after getting royally fed up with the fun-isle. Popping over to Pacha, Ed arrived just in time to hear Erick Morillo drop ‘Africa’ to mass hysteria. He’ll be back! Sasha Sasha’s been showing admirable support for Bedroom Bedlam by taking former BB winner James Zabiela onto the books at his management company Excession. And following a weekend of gigs up north with Zabiela, an impromptu call came in to Muziktwo day later from The Man himself, still raving about the other Man known round these parts as Jay-Z. Respect! Todd Terry Rumour has it that Ibiza’s new drink du jour is Guinness, thanks to the not-noticably-lacking-in-self-esteem Todd Terry’s new Gypsymen single. Sampling the original ‘Babarabatiri’ by Beny More and Perez ‘Prez’ Prado, the track is used in the current Guinness ad on TV (called ‘that one with the snails’) and has prompted an unprecedented demand for the black stuff. Goldie In an unexpected soap/junglist crossover, Goldie took centre Square as he embraced the role of kick-arse hard man Angel in Eastenders. Acting Beppe Del Marco off the screen (not hard, admittedly), Goldie’s triumph was only slightly diminished by his appearance on The Big Breakfast the next day, playing tennis with some pants -hilariously -around his ankles. Charlie The Clown Yousef sent Charlie to the Muzik office in a bid to turn our midweek frowns upside down. And after nearly two hours of balloon animal and hat-based fun we were so over-excited that we had to take a nap. Only Muzik’s Duncan Bell got the fuzzy end of the fun lollipop when he was unluckily doused with water in a trick gone wrong. Oh how we laughed. Armand Van Helden For his new record under the - some would say - slightly pretentious guise of Ghandi Khan, and its appalling ‘Smell The Glove’ style artwork: a topless Armand spinning on decks set on the backs of - hey! - two naked women on all fours.

Missy decided that six songs was all that her Brixton Academy audience deserved. ‘She’s A Bitch’ and ‘The Rain’ rocked hard but crowd participation seemed higher on the agenda than a proper performance on the night.

Sara Cox took great delight in playing the clip repeatedly the following Monday. Euuch . Richard Madeley A million-odd viewers curled their toes as he cosied up to Eddie Grant on This Morning to promote the remix of ‘Electric Avenue’ (a song inspired by Britain’s worst race riot). “Do you believe in reincarnation, Eddie?” asked the dad-dancing Madeley.

Middleton and crew are back at spiritual home The End to blow out the candles on August 1 1 th ★Techno god Carl Cox’s international escapades^ THE MONTH began with a huge party in Amsterdam, an event for about 35,000 people at The Rai. It was called Shockers, and they’d filled the venue with these vast, 40-foot high industrial containers - they had about 150 of them, stacked up like Lego bricks! It looked incredible. The overall production was second to none, sort of like Homelands indoors. Almost as amazing was the technological equipment of John Acquaviva, who was playing before me. He had this programme called Final Scratch, which allows you to download your entire record collection onto a PC and then play tracks (via special, digitally-connected pieces of vinyl) just as you would on a pair of decks. You’ve just gotta pray the computer doesn’t crash [And there’s more on computer-based DJing on page 136 - Ed.]. Then it was off to Ireland to play at Planet Love. Everyone was there - Dave Angel, Mr C, Pete Tong, Paul Van Dyk, Judge Jules. . . Our room, for about 3,000 people, was hosted by the guys who do Shine in Belfast. At the end of my set, Mr C grabbed the mic and did some of his rapping over the tracks. He wasn’t bad! Florida 1 35 at Fraga in northern Spain is a club that’s got to be put on the map. It’s one of the most amazing places I’ve ever played in, constructed inside like a real street with shop fronts, pubs and lamp posts! The whole place was carved out of the side of a mountain about 60 years ago, and has rooms for films, Spanish music and rock. I played outside, on the house terrace, before driving back to Barcelona at about eight in the morning with the sun in my eyes. 1 Green Velvet La La Land (Music Man) 2 Felix Da Housecat Control Freq (City Rockers) 3 Funk D’Void & Percy X Breaking Out (Soma) 4 DJ One Finger House Fucker (Get Fucked Mix) (Missile) 5 Billy Lo Party People (Rumpsheyka) 6 Valentino Kanzyani House Soul (DJ Q Remix) (In-Tec) 7 Wolf ’N’ Flow I’m Feelln’ Moody (Moody) 8 Basement Jaxx Romeo (XL) 9 Tiga & Mateo Simulation (white label) 10MrG Homeward Bound EP (Duty Free) Next stop was Slovenia, and a night called Designs Of Love, held in an old sports hall.

The Slovenian countryside is incredibly beautiful, and I’d definitely go again. Homelands was great, aided by the fantastic weather. I was playing in The End’s arena hosted - a great line-up, including Mr C, Sven Vath, Darren Emerson, Richie Hawtin and Layo & Bushwacka!. Sadly, I had to rush off to Renaissance and couldn't stay to enjoy the party. By the time I arrived in Detroit for the Electronic Music Festival, I was so run down I ended up in hospital with a virus. After a few days of taking it easy, I spent some time working on a new track with the great Kevin Saunderson.

CRAZY TAXI 2 Dreamcast Clearly the rise of unlicensed cabs has opened a gap in the games market.

Three things you’ll be hard pressed to find among the insipid eunuchs populating today’s designed-by- committee, made-for-TV pop groups, not to mention dance music’s glut of determinedly unglamorous DJs. So when Casey Spooner performs his sticky Human League-meets-Munich electropop tunes dressed as a Yeti, or wearing red rubber tights and spitting fire, while a coterie of singers, dancers, choreographers, freaks, weirdos and hairdressers attend to his every whim like Caligula’s naked slaves, you’ve got to admit it - a star is born. Erm, have you always been this way? “I grew up in the south, and hung out with a bunch of country fried rockers,” Casey explains as Muzik’s crack team of psychologists lies the now-native New Yorker down on the couch. “I had a great time! I lived in Athens, Georgia for a while. . . and had an affair with Michael Stipe. It was very scandalous - 1 was 18, and had a complete nervous breakdown. So then I decided to go to art school in Chicago.” Ah, the hallowed home of house. Marshall Jefferson, DJ Pierre, Frankie Knuckles. . . the perfect education. Or not. “I used to go to house parties, but I never knew what the hell I was listening to. Mostly the people I meet are completely baffled at how clueless and stupid I am. Warren Fischer is the music man. I’m just the head of style and bullshit -the charisma department,” he admits gleefully. Casey met Warren in New York when the pair worked on various \"young and earnest” performance art projects. Later Fischer made music with post- rock luminary Jim O’Rourke, while Spooner faced the inevitable and ditched art for pop. “I was tired of people scratching their chins and pretending to be aloof,” he elaborates, displaying a touching naivete about the habits of the house and techno community. Inspired by the “100% entertainment” of Bollywood musicals, peculiar strains of histrionic pop music from Egypt and Russia, and Dutch electro producer l-F - “Warren loved the flat, prefab quality” - they met Munich mogul DJ Hell by chance while on holiday in the Bahamas. Hell’s now releasing Fischerspooner’s debut album on his International Deejay Gigolos label. “He didn’t like us at first, until we made a video,” Casey says. “Then he basically fell in love with me. The rest is history.” Now he’s set his sights on a Muzik front cover. “Just tell me who I have to sleep with and I’ll do it! I’m sure I’ve done worse. . .” The mind boggles. Fischerspooner’s ‘No1’ album is out now on International Deejay Gigolos Went ★ Steve (left) and Rob in the sort of dark tunnel you wouldn’t want to meet them in Muzik catch up with the sexy duo who are about to go stellar ROB CHETCUTTI and Steve McGuiness met in Malta in the late Eighties. The former was a native, playing in a jazz band, while Steve was an enthusiastic b-boy from the UK who had come to the island to DJ in the clubs “for a laugh\". After an initial booze-fuelled meeting, the pair’s first musical adventure was a hip hop group. This foundered due to the rapper being, as Rob confides, “a total wanker,\" so in the early Nineties, the duo moved to the UK. They started making house tunes as The Rhythm Masters and I moved to Brighton shortly afterwards. “It’s full of S nutters so we fit right in,\" chortles Steve. 0 They embarked on a remix career which 1 eventually took in high-profile work for the likes ^ of Michael Jackson, INXS and Jocelyn Brown. I Since then they’ve drummed up an incredible = 200 remixes. Why so many? 3 “For the money!\" they chorus heartily. “We « had £250 and a 1 4 second sampler when we i came here. We needed money for a studio so ■ all the money we made from the mixes went back in. Now we can do what we want.\" That includes their first long player, ‘Disconnect Your Head’, which will be preceded by a single, ‘Underground’. That starts life as a dark, moody affair but changes halfway through into a hands-in- the-air shuffler, and the focus on innovation and energy persists throughout the album, aided by some distinctive vocal collaborations, including one with Heaven 1 7’s Glenn Gregory. Avoiding “anything too gospel or disco\", the record’s UK house sound compares favourably with the more influential US version. “I think we’ve achieved our own sound on this album, and it’s a UK sound,\" stresses Steve. “We’re trying to apply the same originality to our live show. We’ve got a guitarist, breakdancers, a percussionist and vocalists. . .’’ And none of them will be wankers, hopefully. ‘Disconnect Your Head’ is out now on Black & Blue “I can’t do the pop thing. I felt I’d wandered too far away from the dance fold, off up showbiz alley. From time to time I’d totally freak out, feeling I just didn’t belong there. I was worrying I was becoming an OK!

For a label like True Playaz, it’s the witty sampling and crazed breaks-manipulation of early hip hop that features most strongly. For artists such as Bad Company and Ram Trilogy, it’s the terror-drone and clipped beats of Belgian hardcore techno. And for Dillinja, above all else, it’s the sub-bass brutalism of dub. This, though, is dub reinforced and toughened almost beyond recognition. Dub on steroids, if you like. Dub whose trainers you don’t step on if you want to get home alive. Tracks like the commendably vicious ‘Valve Sound’, which opens the new ‘Dillinja Presents Cybotron’ album, bear the same relation to the pastoral skank of King Tubby as an armoured vehicle does to a haycart. William Burroughs once said that a truly great author would be able to write something that could kill people. Does Dillinja have a similar desire to hurt people with his music? \"Definitely. That’s the intention. On the dot, man. I wanna make ’em feel their ribcage, make ’em bleed.” There are other sounds and influences discernible on the album: ‘F^uman B Bop’ looks back to old skool hip hop, while ‘All Aboard’ has a distinctly Caribbean flavour. But these are never more than settings. \"The jewel is always the bass. Building the track around the bass, that’s the thing,\" Dillinja comments. \"Then you can take them into another world - my world. Like they say, sometimes you gotta be cruel to be kind.” ‘Dillinja Presents Cybotron’ is out now on London Meet prog-housers Kinky Drunk and Stinky Fish ER, KINKY DRUNK and Stinky Fish?

It could be you. . . “IT’S AMAZING for someone so young to have such a defined sound,” says Sasha. “His energy is fantastic and the way he puts records together really can make a club go off . Fuck knows what the future holds, but I do get a great vibe off of James. The next couple of years will be tough but the signs are really positive. He’s a diamond geezer!” When Sasha speaks, people listen. In the few short months since Sasha’s management company Excession signed up one of Bedroom Bedlam’s brightest stars, James Zabiela has travelled to Helsinki with Nick Warren, flown to Holland to spin alongside Sander Kleinenberg and warmed up for Sasha in Northern Ireland. This weekend he’s about to repeat that warm-up performance at Foundation in Newcastle and Cream in Liverpool. Not bad for a boy who was working as a graphic designer in Southampton six months ago. “As soon as up-and-coming DJs get a bit of action, it sends them a bit mental,” shrugs Sasha. “But with James there’s a different attitude: people take a shine to him straight away. Now he's lapping it up. . . I think I get more nervous than he does!” He’s got a point. Returning to Foundation for a Global-sponsored shindig in Newcastle, James looks perfectly at ease as he drops mid-tempo cuts like ‘Saudade’ by Coco Da Silva. He’s found the perfect blend of cool house chuggers and darker, techno-inf luenced material. Spinning until just after midnight, James does his best to hide that smile. And fails miserably. Everything’s fallen into place for you, hasn’t it? “It’s all been too perfect,” nods James, chomping on an Opal Fruit after his set. “It’s very strange. I won Bedroom Bedlam last year, gave a mix tape to Lee Burridge at Bedrock who gave my tape to Tara at Excession, and somehow he got Sasha to listen to it. Amazing!” James says “amazing” an awful lot. The word crops up in his conversation about once every five minutes. “A month after that, a meeting was called. It was the week before Christmas and I was only in their office for five minutes. But I got the best Christmas present ever!” When Sasha arrives, the two hug warmly and James lets his new boss take over. “The trick is not to play too hard or to play ‘big’ records,” notes James. “Nick Warren tipped me off about that!” Turning the heat up till four in the morning, Sasha drops killer tunes like ‘Rapture’ by Vaiio and Pete Heller’s mix of Moby’s ‘Southside’. Deep, trippy house music for E-heads, basically. But James has never gone down that road. He doesn't drink, smoke or take drugs. His only vice is a sweet-toothed craving for Opal Fruits and M&Ms. “People can do what they like, it’s up to them,” reckons James. “I’ll never judge anyone. But I’ve never been tempted. I had a drink on my 1 8th birthday, though, I think it was Grolsch. I’m happy the way lam.” He’s not a total pussycat, though. “Coffee sends me loopy,” he says. There's a brief pause. “You wouldn’t like me on coffee!” Despite his hectic new schedule, James still works in his local record shop one day a week. “I got given decks for Christmas when I was 1 5,” he reminisces. “A local promoter called Gary Bennetton taught me what mixing was. He’s the only hope for music in Southampton - he runs the High Tide boat parties - so I guess I owe him a drink. Or a hundred!” 36MZK For a Friday night out, though, the evening ends quietly. \"I got a good night’s sleep,\" says James. “I was in bed by five!\" He won’t be saying that again in a hurry. Driving up to Liverpool to join Sasha, Judge Jules, Tall Paul, Darren Emerson and Yousef at Cream, the mood of our party is excitable to say the least. Unsurprisingly, the next night is nothing short of outstanding. “The kind of night you read about,” says James, not quite realising what he’s said. Waiting to spin in front of the biggest crowd of his career, James is joined backstage by Darren Emerson, Yousef and Steve Gerrard (the latter pair both former BB winners themselves), all on hand to offer some support. It’s a big night at Cream. Sasha’s not spun here for over a year and there’s a queue of punters waiting to squeeze in. James plays a selection of deep underground cuts that sends them flying. After his set, he’s elated. “It was amazing,” he smirks. “I felt sick before I went on but Cream couldn’t have been more perfect.\" Sasha ends his set with ‘Xpander' - and it works. “It just felt right,” he smiles. “One for those special nights, definitely. The reaction was mental!” Twenty minutes later, we’re back at the hotel, eager to find some fun. Everyone’s buzzing on the night’s adrenaline and there’s no reason to stop now. James retires to his room and we drag Darren Emerson back for some post-club natter. At 5:30am, James get a knock on his door. Wearing nothing but a pair of South Park boxers, he’s greeted by Sasha who tells him to get dressed. An after-party awaits! What follows is rather surreal. It’s now six in the morning and James and Sasha are playing back to back. In someone’s kitchen, no less. This goes on for hours. And it rocks. Post-set, Sasha sits down for a swift drink and a much-needed Marlboro Light. Tired but elated, he’s keen to reflect on the weekend so far. Looking over at James - who’s still slightly shellshocked from that Cream reaction - we can’t help but notice how unaffected he remains. “Hah!” smiles Sasha mischievously. “Give it two years and it’ll be flights on business class, hookers and huge mounds of cocaine!” Tsk.

I got a great response at Cream after appearing on Radio 1 - people came and gave me cards and stuff. Then I shot off to Bed in Sheffield. Next time I think I’ll ask to play for longer, as I was only just getting into my stride when the lights came up. Amsterdam was next - a venue called The Kremlin, and my first time in the city of dubious pleasures. I took along my old friend Mike who indulged enough for the both of us! The night was good, a new-lsh Friday session that they’re trying to give more of an American house vibe. After a brief detour via Rotterdam, I was off to Tribal Sessions in Manchester. It turned out to be one of the best nights I’ve had out for a long time. It was just a fantastic atmosphere, and I’d recommend it to anybody. The month’s high point, though, was the following week, back at Cream, one of the best nights I’ve had there for years. I was playing alongside Sasha, Darren Emerson and James Zabiela. There were about 3,500 people there, and It felt just like the old Cream: fantastic. By the time you read this I’ll have started my summer-long fortnightly residency at Cream at Amnesia in Ibiza. We’re going to try to recreate the atmosphere of the Annexe. With an extra 10k of newly installed sound, hopefully the venue will be up to it this year. See you there!

Jo^ Negro Joey, aka Dave ‘Disco’ Lee, on the tunes he most likes to ‘sample’ cv Born: Isle of Wight (not Essex as frequently reported!) Age: 36 First record bought: The Sweet - ‘Blockbuster’ Desert island tune: Anything by Phillip Schofield or Darren Day (‘Joseph's Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat', etc.) Future plans: To shave my head, announce to the world that I’m a Guru and recruit lots of gullible followers. If the above dastardly plan doesn’t work out, then I’ll probably just continue making records in my north London studio and hatching other futile plans for leading the world astray. . . 1. Stevie Wonder Do I Do (Motown, 1 982) Though this wasn’t one of his really big hits, for me it’s one of his finest moments. The musicianship is brilliant, the groove is really tight and there’s an understated energy throughout. 2. M.F.S.B. K-Gee (Philadelphia International, 1 975) I first heard this when I bought the ‘Saturday Night Fever' soundtrack back in 1 978. It’s a big string and brass-led instrumental, but isn’t overplayed like ‘We Are Family’. 3. The Osmonds Crazy Horses (MGM, 1972) I was mad about this when it came out -well, I was only eight. It was their attempt to shrug off the ballads and the clean-cut image and reinvent themselves as dangerous glam rockers. There’s a really distinctive horse-like guitar sound In the chorus that I’ve spent years imitating. 40 MZK 4. B52s Song For A Future Generation (Island, 1983) I love the B-52s. They don’t take themselves too seriously, but I really rate their music and they know how to come up with proper, ridiculous lyrics. This track is a semi piss-take of The Floaters’ ‘Float On’ which was used on the Cadbury’s Creme Egg ads about star signs! 5. Visage Pleasure Boys (Polydor, 1981) weren’t old enough to hear them first time round, get the ‘Computer World’ album [which this track comes from] - it still sounds more modern than most of today’s techno. 7. Underground Resistance Jupiter Jazz (UR, 1993) This came out in the mid-Nineties when I may have sported the odd bandanna or two. Though this is a techno record, it has a dark, futuristic, but very musical, jazzy approach. It has an attitude about it that isn’t easily faked or manufactured. 12. George Benson Star Of The Story (Warner, 1 979) This is a song from his ‘Gimme The Night’ album. It’s produced by Ouincy Jones and written by Rod Temperton, the team behind many of Jacko’s best. It’s the sort of thing you’d play if you had an early hours radio show. The tone is very moody and mysterious. 13. Dusty Springfield Nothing Has Been Proved (Parlophone, 1 989) Produced by her sometime collaborators the Pet Shop Boys and taken from the film Scandal, this was one of Dusty’s last UK hits. There’s an evocative string refrain which makes the track a real tear- jerker, especially if you’re a bit of a girl - like me! 14. Blue Six Music & Wine (Naked Music, 1 999) This is definitely one of my favourites from the last few years: it’s what the term deep house should mean. Naked Music have deservedly gone from strength to strength in terms of profile, but I still feel this is their best release to date. 15. Fifth Dimension My Beautiful Balloon (Bell, 1 973) I’ve always loved this song: it’s so upbeat and happy! There are quite a few covers of this, but this is the best one - they keep it simple and don’t ruin it with over-the-top harmonies. 16. George Duke Brazilian Love Affair (Epic, 1979) This reminds me of the summer I left school. Igotthisjobonalocalonion farm and for the first time I was able to spend loads of money buying records. Priortothis, I preferred forcing shops to take back the record I’d bought the previous week, because it was so crackly (the metal polish never failed me!). The Rhodes solo at the end means it should never be cut short. 17. Miss Kimberly My Boyfriend Is A Communist (Bob Cat, 1983) “I’ve always had a thing for hilariously bad records. This appalling rip off of Joe Jackson’s ‘Steppin’ Out’ by hi-NRG producer Bobby O has the most stupid lyrics I have ever heard, and as for Miss Kimberly’s voice. . . Well, let’s just say she ain’t no Aretha! Always brings a smile to my face. WIN! THERE’S ONLY ONE COPY OF JOEY NEGRO’S TAPE AND IT COULD BE YOURS.

Dworkin Send your answers on the backof a rejected application for sample clearance to: Do Us A Tape, Muzik Magazine, King’s Reach Tower, Stamford Street, London SE1 9LS. Dusty Springfield: It’s suspected that all her fans are queens, but ‘nothing has been proved’ 10. ErykahBadu Next Lifetime (Universal, 1997) 11. Nancy Sinatra You Only Live Twice (CBC, 1 968) 8. Will Powers Adventures In Success (Island, 1 983) This is a really unique tune. A slow- rolling hypnotic groove with a Paul McKenna style motivational diatribe about self-belief. I once briefly saw a clip of the video and there was this image of an enormous rotating head. It’s stuck with me ever since and I’m always trying to get video directors to let me wear one. 9. De La Soul Stakes Is High (Tommy Boy, 1 998) This samples Ahmad Jamal and was responsible for turning me on to him as an artist. What De La Soul have done with the sample is better than the original track, which is very rare. I first heard this being blasted out of a bar on the beach in Greece. Although I was pleasantly pissed and half asleep in the hot sun, I made the effort to get up and ask what it was. I’m more old age than new age, but the idea of meeting up with a lost lover through reincarnation appeals. John Barry’s output is phenomenal. His songs always have a very distinctive, haunting atmosphere and a great use of orchestration. This track is probably the most memorable thing about the Bond film it accompanied. Whenever I hear it, I’m compelled to sing along very badly and loudly. A bit of a b-boy anthem in New York for the electro breakdown, but I must admit I like it in its camp entirety! I was never much of a New Romantic myself, but I did have a friend who claimed to be a Futurist. Apparently there’s a difference. . . 6. Kraftwerk Numbers (EMI, 1981) It’s always been hip for dance producers to cite Kraftwerk as the prime innovators of electronic music, but don’t let that put you off. If you MZK 41 New; Easy Control Styler from Wella ShockWaves. Gives your hair ultra strong hold, without stickiness. Wella ShockWaves. Simply take control. Wella.

Smokin’ Jo “I DIDN’T WANT THIS MIX to be an exact replica of what I do in a club,” says Smokin' Jo. “I also steered away from big vocal tracks because I wanted an easy feel, something to groove along to at home or in your car.” A tough yet teasing tribal-ish house mix, Muzik's 70-minute session is as flamboyant as the lady herself. Now busierthan ever, this summer Jo has a residency at Manumis"
