        "text": "As the writers try to make their way through Season 6, we have another rather strange episode. Maurice has tapped into some prehistoric well and is starting to sell Cicely Water. The thing is that when women drink it they become lustful and aggressive; the men begin to see their softer sides. Doctor Capra tries to deal with it because the women are sexually destroying the men (does this sound as stupid to you as it does to me?). The town is up in arms but the women don't want any changes. In the secondary plot, Joel gets word from the IRS that a mistake was made an he is a free man. He even gets a few bucks for extra days performed. He is free to do what he wants but his response to this is interesting."
