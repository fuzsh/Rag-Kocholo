This version of the show was called the “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” and it ran until 1995, with toys being released until the beginning of 1996. The toy line showed massive sales numbers and proved to be only the beginning of this powerhouse franchise. Bandai released several sub-sets, vehicles, and accessories for the Mighty Morphin line, and it remains the largest Power Rangers line produced to date.\n\nFor more information about Bandai’s Mighty Morphin Power Rangers line, see bottom of the page for a complete summary.\n\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers (1993): Basic Figures (2200)\n\nThe first series of figures released in 1993 featured the original five Rangers, in a triangular box with bright green and yellow colors. These figures are the ones most fans remember from growing up in the 1990’s.\n\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers (Basic Series)\n\nYear Released: 1993\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: This was the very first line of Power Ranger figures to ever hit the toy shelves back in 1993, and stores had trouble keeping up with the massive demand at the time. These figures had little in the way of articulation but were painted well with solid sculpting.\n\nEvil Space Aliens (1993 – 1994): Basic Figures (2210)\n\nBandai changed the packaging just a bit for the bad guys, by making it a more conventional squared box with a yellow/blue tone. There were seven Evil Space Aliens released in this series from 1993-1994.\n\nKing Sphinx\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $25 – $40\n\nLoose $7 – $13\n\nPutty Patrol\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $25 – $40\n\nLoose $7 – $13\n\nSquatt\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $30 – $45\n\nLoose $7 – $13\n\nEvil Space Aliens (Series 1)\n\nYear Released: 1993, 1994\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: This was the first series of bad guys for the Power Ranger line to be released in 1993, and proved very popular. They are not terribly difficult to find on the secondary market because so many of each were produced.\n\nKarate Action Power Rangers (1994): Basic Figures (2201)\n\nThis series of Power Rangers figures once again featured all five of the original Rangers, but with a new “Karate Action” feature. The packaging was a traditional squared shape with the same bright green/yellow colors.\n\nKarate Action Power Rangers\n\nYear Released: 1994\n\nScarcity Factor: Easily found on the secondary market.\n\nNotes: This series of Ranger figures once again featured each of the original five Rangers, but Bandai added a karate kicking action feature. The figures lacked articulation and were mass produced in large numbers, making them easy to find nowadays.\n\nDeluxe Evil Space Aliens (1994): Basic Figures (2211)\n\nThe Deluxe Evil Space Aliens series featured six new Evil Space Aliens in a “Deluxe” format, meaning they all came with fancy weapons. This series also saw the first figure of the Power Rangers main villain, Lord Zedd.\n\nGoo Fish\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $15 – $25\n\nLoose $5 – $10\n\nGuitardo\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $20 – $30\n\nLoose $5 – $10\n\nLord Zedd\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $20 – $30\n\nLoose $5 – $10\n\nPirantis Head\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $15 – $25\n\nLoose $5 – $10\n\nRhino Blaster\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $15 – $25\n\nLoose $5 – $10\n\nSocadillo\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $20 – $30\n\nLoose $5 – $10\n\nDeluxe Evil Space Aliens (Series 1)\n\nYear Released: 1994\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: This was the second series of bad guys for the Power Ranger line, but were released as Deluxe Evil Space Aliens. This wave contained all new different characters, including the iconic Lord Zedd.\n\nAuto-Morphin Power Rangers (1994): Basic Figures (2310)\n\nThe “Auto-Morphin” series was an extremely popular one when released in 1994, mostly due to the Power Rangers show hitting its pinnacle around this time. The series featured all five original Rangers, along with the very first figure of Tommy, the Green Ranger.\n\nAuto-Morphin’\n\nBilly\n\nMarket Value:\n\nCarded $25 – $40\n\nLoose $8 – $15\n\nAuto-Morphin’\n\nJason\n\nMarket Value:\n\nCarded $25 – $40\n\nLoose $8 – $15\n\nAuto-Morphin’\n\nKimberly\n\nMarket Value:\n\nCarded $25 – $40\n\nLoose $8 – $15\n\nAuto-Morphin’\n\nTommy\n\nMarket Value:\n\nCarded $50 – $75\n\nLoose $15 – $25\n\nAuto-Morphin’\n\nTrini\n\nMarket Value:\n\nCarded $25 – $40\n\nLoose $8 – $15\n\nAuto-Morphin’\n\nZach\n\nMarket Value:\n\nCarded $25 – $40\n\nLoose $8 – $15\n\nAuto-Morphin Power Rangers\n\nYear Released: 1994\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: The Auto-Morphin Power Ranger figures were incredibly popular because for the first time, kids were finally able to see the human faces of their favorite Ranger characters through the “Auto-Morphin” process, which was basically a head that would flip around to see each face version. Another huge note about this series was it was the first that featured the fan favorite character, Tommy the Green Ranger.\n\nAction Feature Aliens (1994): Series 1 Figures (2320)\n\nThe Action Feature Aliens series featured 12 bad guys in a slightly smaller scale, but all came with new “Action Features”. All were brand new releases to the toy line and featured many popular baddies from the television show.\n\nAction Feature Evil Space Aliens (Series 1)\n\nYear Released: 1994\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: This was the first series of bad guys for the Power Ranger line in the standard 5″ format. This was a large series, and a very fun one too because of the wide variety of characters released. They were produced in large numbers, which is why they are not difficult to find on the secondary market.\n\nAction Feature Aliens (1995): Series 2 Figures (2350)\n\nThe second wave of the Action Feature Aliens series, released in 1995, added six more bad guys to the “Action Features” line. Most were brand new releases to the series, except for Lord Zedd and Goldar, who had been seen before in the Deluxe Evil Aliens series.\n\nAction Feature Evil Space Aliens (Series 2)\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: This was the second series of bad guys for the Power Ranger line in the standard 5″ format. The new wave was not as big as the first, but did feature several new characters, including the popular Putty Patrol and Lord Zedd.\n\nTalking Power Rangers (1995): 8″ Figures (2390)\n\nBandai released the “Talking Power Rangers” in 1995, which included the original five Rangers, and Tommy, who converted from green to white. In addition a Talking Lord Zedd figure was also released, but in a different packaging style.\n\nTalking Red Ranger\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $40 – $60\n\nLoose $12 – $20\n\nTalking White Ranger\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $75 – $100\n\nLoose $25 – $40\n\nTalking Yellow Ranger\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $40 – $60\n\nLoose $12 – $20\n\nTalking 8″ Power Rangers\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: The Talking Power Ranger figures were incredibly popular because for the first time, kids were finally able to hear the voices of their favorite Ranger characters. Even though Tommy the Green Ranger had been released the year prior in 1994, this was the first series that featured Tommy as the White Ranger, making it among the more popular figures of the line.\n\nMovie Edition Power Rangers (1995): 5.5″ Figures (2420)\n\nThe Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Feature Movie was released in 1995, and proved to be extremely popular with the fan base, so movie figures seemed like a no-brainer. The 5.5″ figures included all six Rangers on a new movie style blister card.\n\nMovie Edition 5.5″ Power Rangers\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Can prove a bit difficult to track down, but can still be found on the secondary market.\n\nNotes: The Power Ranger movie in 1995 proved extremely popular with fans and audiences, so a new line of figures from the movie was inevitable. This series was very popular because of the metallic appearance of the characters, with Tommy the White Ranger being the most popular figures of the series.\n\nMovie Edition Evil Space Aliens (1995): 5.5″ Figures (2450)\n\nIn addition to the Movie Ranger figures, Bandai also released four new Evil Space Aliens figures from the movie in a 5.5″ version. This included three new movie characters, along with Lord Zedd.\n\nMovie Edition Evil Space Aliens\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: This series of bad guys featured four of the characters seen on the big screen for the mega successful Power Ranger movie, released in 1995. Mordant and Tengu Warrior were brand new figures, and can prove a bit tougher to track down than the other two.\n\nMovie Edition Power Rangers (1995): 8″ Figures (2430)\n\nSince the feature Power Rangers movie proved to be so popular in 1995, Bandai released a series of 8″ figures as well as the previously mentioned 5.5″ versions. Once again, this series included all six Rangers.\n\nMovie Edition 8″ Power Rangers\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Can prove a bit difficult to track down, but can still be found on the secondary market.\n\nNotes: The Power Ranger movie in 1995 proved extremely popular with fans and audiences, so new figures from the movie was inevitable. This 8 inch series was released just after the 5.5 inch wave, and of course proved very popular, with Tommy the White Ranger being the toughest to find of the series.\n\nMovie Edition Evil Space Aliens (1995): 8″ Figures (2488)\n\nThe three main villains from the Power Rangers movie in 1995 were released in a “deluxe” 8″ version.\n\nHornitor\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $75 – $100\n\nLoose $35 – $50\n\nIvan Ooze\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $40 – $60\n\nLoose $12 – $20\n\nScorpitan\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $75 – $100\n\nLoose $35 – $50\n\nMovie Edition 8″ Evil Space Aliens\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: This series of bad guys featured three of the characters seen on the big screen for the mega successful Power Ranger movie, released in 1995. Ivan Ooze was also found in the smaller 5.5″ format, but Hornitor and Scorpitan were new and remain harder to find nowadays on the secondary market.\n\nSpecial Edition Auto-Morphin’ (1995): Metallic Figures (2560)\n\nThe Rangers were released in a new “Special Edition” version in the Fall of 1995, which featured each character in a new metallic version. The original yellow/green packaging was also brought back.\n\nSpecial Edition Auto-Morphin Power Rangers\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Tough to find on the secondary market.\n\nNotes: The first Auto-Morphin Power Ranger series was incredibly popular, so it was brought back in a “special edition” with the new figures having a metallic appearance. The “Auto-Morphin” process, was basically a head that would flip around to see the human face of each character. This set can be difficult to find on the secondary market.\n\nAuto Morphin’ Power Rangers Series 2 (1995): Basic Figures (2440)\n\nThe Auto-Morphin series was brought back with a second wave in the Fall of 1995, but only included four of the seven Rangers for some reason.\n\nAuto-Morphin Power Rangers (Series 2)\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Tough to find on the secondary market.\n\nNotes: The Auto-Morphin Power Ranger figures were incredibly popular in 1994, so a second wave was released in the Fall of 1995. This wave featured the first Auto-Morphin White Ranger figure. This set was among the last waves of releases for the Ranger line and can be tough to find on the secondary market.\n\nAction Evil Space Aliens (1995): Basic Figures (2460)\n\nIf new Ranger figures are continually being released, then it only makes sense that new bad guys for them to fight should also be released. This series of baddies each came with new action features.\n\nAction Feature Evil Space Aliens (Series 3)\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: This was the third series of bad guys for the Power Ranger line in the standard 5″ format. Like the previous two waves, this one featured all new figures with fun action features. Rito Revolto and Master Vile remain among the harder to find of the series.\n\nDeluxe Evil Space Aliens (1995): Series 2 (2521)\n\nA second wave of Deluxe Evil Space Aliens was released in 1995, featuring six new figures.\n\nDeluxe Evil Space Aliens (Series 2)\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Some can be tougher than others to track down on the secondary market.\n\nNotes: This was the second series of deluxe bad guys for the Power Ranger line, with the first being released the year prior in 1994. The series contained a mix of new and previously released characters, and can be tougher to track down due to being a late released for the line in the Fall of 1995.\n\nAction Ninja Rangers (1995): Basic Figures (2470)\n\nThis set of figures featured the six Ranger characters with Ninja costumes. Notice the two female Rangers (Pink and Yellow) are actually wearing skirts……\n\nAction Ninja Rangers\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Can still be found, but getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: The Action Ninja Power Ranger figures were not terribly popular when released in 1995, mostly due to the blocky appearance of the characters and poor articulation.\n\nBattle Borgs (1996): Basic Figures (2660)\n\nThe final set of action figures based on the Mighty Morphin line was released in early 1996, and were called the “Battle Borgs”. The series included all six Rangers with a new robot style morphing feature.\n\nBattle Borgs Power Rangers\n\nYear Released: 1996\n\nScarcity Factor: Tough to find on the secondary market.\n\nNotes: The Battle Borg Power Ranger figures were the final series of figures released for the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers line in 1996. This was also the only Mighty Morphin series released this year before transitioning over the the Power Rangers Zeo line. These figures are very difficult to find on the secondary market due to limited production numbers.\n\nMighty Morphin’ Power Rangers (1993 – 1995): Accessories\n\nBandai released several role playing accessories for kids to mirror their favorite Ranger characters.\n\nPower Morpher/\n\nPower Gun-Sword\n\nReleased 1993\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $175 – $250\n\nLoose $70 – $100\n\nDragon\n\nDagger\n\nReleased 1994\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $200 – $300\n\nLoose $80 – $120\n\nPower\n\nCannon\n\nReleased 1994\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $85 – $115\n\nLoose $30 – $45\n\nSaba The Tiger Saber\n\nReleased 1994\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $150 – $225\n\nLoose $60 – $90\n\nPower Blaster\n\nReleased 1995\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $100 – $150\n\nLoose $40 – $60\n\nPower Rangers Accessories\n\nYear Released: 1993, 1994, 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Most can still be found, but they are getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers line remains incredibly popular to this day, but most of its accessories can still be found at somewhat reasonable prices. The Dragon Dagger and Saba Tiger Saber are among the more difficult to find items, while the Power Cannon is among the easier to find.\n\nMighty Morphin’ Power Rangers (1994): Playsets\n\nBandai only released one actual playset for their Mighty Morphin action figures, and that was the Power Dome Playset in 1994. This was the Rangers headquarters and included the only release of the Rangers mentor, Zordon.\n\nPower Dome Morphin’ Playset\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $150 – $225\n\nLoose $40 – $60\n\nPower Dome Morphin Playset\n\nYear Released: 1994\n\nAccessories: Alpha 5 Figure, Zordon Voice Morpher, Transport Tube, Secret Door, Cycle Launcher, Viewing Globe, Console\n\nScarcity Factor: Can be a bit challenging to find, especially in good packaging.\n\nNotes: The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Power Dome Playset was at the top of just about every kid’s Wishlist back in the day. It was the only place that you could find Zordon and an Alpha 5 figure, making this a pretty big deal. Not to mention that it was the only playset released for the Mighty Morphin line, this set remains very popular and can be a bit challenging to find one complete in a good package.\n\nMighty Morphin’ Power Rangers (1993 – 1995): Vehicles\n\nThree different lines of Ranger vehicles were released during the Mighty Morphin line. This included the Battle Bikes, Thunder Bikes, and the Shark Cycles.\n\nBattle Bikes\n\nReleased in 1993\n\nMammoth Battle Bike\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $40 – $60\n\nLoose $10 – $18\n\nTriceratops Battle Bike\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $40 – $60\n\nLoose $10 – $18\n\nTyrannosaurus Battle Bike\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $40 – $60\n\nLoose $10 – $18\n\nThunder Bikes\n\nReleased in 1995 (Spring)\n\nShark Cycles\n\nReleased in 1995 (Fall)\n\nPower Rangers Vehicles\n\nYear Released: 1993, 1994, 1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Most vehicles can still be found, but they are getting tougher to find each year.\n\nNotes: The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers line remains incredibly popular to this day, but most of its vehicles can still be found at somewhat reasonable prices. The Battle Bikes and Thunder Bikes are definitely easier to locate on the secondary market than the Shark Cycles, which were a later release.\n\nMighty Morphin’ Power Rangers (1993 – 1995): Vehicles – Zords\n\nZords are vehicles, which are controlled by each Ranger. These Zords are used to battle enemies when they grow to larger sizes. They can also combine into a larger Megazord when needed. There were several Zords released during the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers run between 1993 and 1995, and they typically bring high prices on today’s secondary market.\n\n1993\n\nScarcity Factor: The initial 1993 Zords are difficult to find on the secondary market.\n\nNotes: The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers line were incredibly popular when released, and that continues to this day. This is especially true with the Zord released in 1993. They are definitely on the expensive side, and can be tough to find, especially in good and complete packaged condition.\n\n1994\n\nScarcity Factor: The Zord releases from 1994 can be challenging to find on the secondary market.\n\nNotes: The Mighty Morphin Power Ranger Zords released in 1994 were just as popular as previously released in 1993. The Deluxe Thunder Megazord and Special Sized Thunder Megazord are among the harder to find from this group.\n\nDeluxe\n\nThunder Megazord\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $250 – $350\n\nLoose $90 – $130\n\nRed Dragon\n\nThunderzord\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $100 – $140\n\nLoose $35 – $55\n\nThunderzord\n\nAssault Team\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $150 – $200\n\nLoose $50 – $75\n\nThunder Megazord\n\n(Special Sized)\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $350 – $450\n\nLoose $90 – $140\n\nTor the Shuttlezord\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $160 – $210\n\nLoose $65 – $90\n\nWhite Tigerzord with\n\nWhite Ranger\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $175 – $250\n\nLoose $80 – $120\n\n1995\n\nScarcity Factor: Most of the Zord releases from 1995 are easier to locate on the secondary market, with some exceptions.\n\nNotes: The Mighty Morphin Power Ranger Zords released in 1995 were still very popular, but more were produced so they were a bit easier to find. The Deluxe Movie Ninja Megazord, White Ranger’s Movie Deluxe Falconzord and Lord Zedd’s Serpentera are among the harder to locate Zords from this group.\n\nDeluxe Auto-Morphin\n\nNinjor\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $85 – $115\n\nLoose $35 – $55\n\nNinja\n\nMegafalconzord\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $100 – $140\n\nLoose $40 – $60\n\nNinja\n\nMegafalconzord (Movie)\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $90 – $120\n\nLoose $35 – $55\n\nThe Return\n\nOf Titanus\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $100 – $150\n\nLoose $40 – $60\n\nWhite Ranger’s\n\nDeluxe Falconzord\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $90 – $140\n\nLoose $35 – $55\n\nWhite Ranger’s Deluxe\n\nFalconzord (Movie)\n\nMarket Value:\n\nBoxed $200 – $275\n\nLoose $40 – $60\n\nThe Power Rangers are one of the most iconic franchises in today’s toy world, and have been a staple on the small screen and toy aisles since 1993, but their journey to getting to that point was a long and sometimes complicated one, to say the least. In 1992, Saban Entertainment purchased the U.S distribution rights to the popular Japanese television show, Super Sentai. The show, about a group of super hero teens, was adopted into an English speaking format called the “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers”, which debuted in August of 1993, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThe television series initially consisted of five Power Ranger characters, Red Ranger, Blue Ranger, Black Ranger, Yellow Ranger and the Pink Ranger. These Rangers would go on to battle a small army of different and very……….unique villains called “Evil Space Aliens”. A sixth Ranger, Tommy, would later be added. He would known as the Green Ranger, and later on, the White Ranger. Multiple waves of action figures would fill the toy aisles of retail stores during this time, featuring various iterations of the Rangers characters, along with the evil aliens. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Movie was released in 1995, which spawned new lines of figures based on the movie characters. Several Zords and Vehicles would also be released during this Mighty Morphin line from 1993 to 1995.\n\nThe figures and accessories from this initial line of Power Rangers from 1993 to 1995 are generally considered to be modern day classics, and built the foundation of the Power Rangers franchise as we know them today. This particular line remains the largest one from the Power Rangers franchise, with the most released products of any other Rangers iteration. This toy line is fondly remembered by the kids of this generation and remain highly sought after in today’s secondary market."
