        "text": "It is in my opinion just people speculating that as those guitars have reached or are approaching 20 years old that they will suddenly become valuable rare collectibles. However, I don't believe that these will ever be as sought after as true vintage instruments (a.k.a. \"pre-CBS\" or at least pre-1972 or so when Leo was still working at Fender). For one thing, they were mass produced on automated equipment in large numbers. They aren't going to be rare any time soon, there were just plain too many of them built.\n\nMy personal opinion is that quality at Fender (and Squier for that matter) is about as high right now as it has ever been. If you are looking for a PLAYING guitar, I think you would be stupid to pay a premium for a 1990s guitar instead of a more recent model. If you are a speculator looking for an investment, then the people who are betting they will go up may or may not be right. The question is whether these things will appreciate more than inflation, or more than other things someone could collect or invest in like gold, comic books, etc. My personal bet is that true vintage Fenders will probably continue to appreciate in value over time faster than 1990s models will.\n\nAll that said, 1990s models probably are better players on average than 1980s models, and more so even than 1970s models. So if you are a bargain hunter and you can find a 1990s model cheap as a player then there is nothing really wrong with them. I'm just saying that for the same $$$ the 2000s models are probably better yet.\n\nI am not a fan of them in general.They play and sound fine but I hate the body contouring on them...Fender had it all wrong then.The horns were really bulky and the bodies were more slab like.Finally in 1998,Fender redesigned the U.S. Strats to be more 50s-60s vintage accurate with the classic body profile.Now they are much sleeker and sexier looking.I think Fender is making some of their finest guitars these days.\n\nI would tend to agree... the bad contours and square slab bodies go back into the 1970s. Back in the early days it was blamed on worn tooling, lazy Fender employees or employees just being too rushed building them. But Fender was slow to correct things, part of the reason why a lot of people liked the JVs that were more true to the contours of vintage than the USA models.\n\nI also agree about the current models being some of the best Fender has ever made.\n\nIf you're talking Strat Plus and Plus deluxe, I think it was a major leap forward for the first time in a long time for Fender with those models. In the late 80's they licensed the Lace sensors which went a long way to reduce 60hz hum and still sound fairly \"strat-like\". By then they'd gone back to the 4 bolt neck which alot folks didn't like the 3 bolt ones. The roller nut and two point trem was a nice improvement. Trem-setter thingie I guess was something useful if you tend to break strings often. TBX control is also pretty cool for tonal control. The swimming pool routing under the pick guard was a little weird but it sure makes it easy to swap out your pg for a HSH setup or whatever you want. If you wanted a better Strat then you had to get a CS one.\n\nI see them creeping up in price too. I have a '89 + Dlx and follow the pricing.\n\nBut hey, it was 20 years ago. 20 yr old Strats seem to creep up there. I remember the early 80's when 20 yr old strats were 2 or 3 grand and I thought it was outrageous then.\n\nI own a few 90's Strats and a few 2000+ strats and I see/hear no difference between any of them. There are minor tonal differences, yes, but quality and workmanship is just as good. I wouldn't pay any more for a mid 90's strat than I would for a 2005, 2006, or even a 2008 strat.\n\nHere are pics of 2 strats that I own. One is from the 1990's and the other from the 2000's. I know it's difficult to decifer differences in photos (especially when I took them), but my thoughts are that they look and play very similar.\n\nIf you find one that you like and at a decent price, buy it, don't look at the year of manufacture.\n\nI own a few 90's Strats and a few 2000+ strats and I see/hear no difference between any of them.
