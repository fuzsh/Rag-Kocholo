        "meta_description": "Horna is a Finnish black metal band formed in 1994. The band has appeared on over thirty releases including splits, demos, EPs and albums since 1995, which have been released through numerous record labels. The name \"Horna\" is Finnish for \"abyss\" or \"hell\". It was chosen because, to Shatraug, it sounded harsh and powerful.",
