        "text": "Suomi Melodic Black Metal attack.\n\nWhen someone calls a band melodic it always causes cringes on the majority of blokes around the block but the matter of fact is that if it’s applied in black metal is a good thing totally different when applied on Death Metal. To draw some similarities the black metal would have to be called symphonic or whatever.\n\nThat being said, one doesn’t have to confuse Ymir (this one’s from Finland) with the Italian one.\n\nThis debut really brings the old spirit of Scandinavian black metal to the fore (not just the Finnish one) being a really true and enjoyable release.\n\nFor example, a song like Resurrection of The Pagan Fire although not being a long one is epic as hell with lots of parts that it doesn’t make for “experimental”, “progressive” or “post-black metal” bull, but simple metal as in satanic form with various parts as metal should be and the same case can be applied in a track called Winterstorms that although remembering Dimmu Borgir from For All Tid, it is a good thing because For All Tid is a good album and far from being the “symphonic” Dimmu Borgir, so see it as words of praise.\n\nHowever, it is the very first track called Pagan Mysticism that Ymir shows all its power with a very fast 2nd wave approach, really sounding like a Swedish or Norwegian band from 90’s rather than the Finnish black metal tradition and if it was the point Ymir wanted to make it was a BULLEYE! Faster approach, non-overdone keyboards, cool drum fills, repetitive guitars and bellows straight from hell remembering Emperor and early Setherial, totally my thing, lemme say.\n\nAnother killer tune is Frostland Conqueror that methinks summarizes the whole album into one song, so if you want to know what to expect from Ymir seek this song out!\n\nYmir is back to basics band, that for a black metal fan is a must hear. Nothing new, nothing fancy, just good old black metal.\n\nYmir is going to be out tomorrow on CD and LP via Werewolf\n\nRating: 8.0/10\n\nRoderick Totentanz\n\nSuomi Finland Svart Metall! Arrrggh!\n\nThis sophomore Shadow’s Mortuary album brings to the fore the great tradition of Suomi Black Metal, and I’m not going to put on an obvious list of super perfect Finnish bands… if you don’t know your Suomi black metal, go fetch some!\n\nBut I digress…\n\nA 30-minute 8-track album, Kuoleman Portit is the pure essence of metal in that country: raw, hard, intransigent music of hell!\n\nOpener Sielun Tuhkaa presents the modus operandi of this spectacular infernal opus: perfect Scandinavian riffs following the old school raw tradition of the north, but not with blast beats. This is more hardcore-like although I can’t see that it is some “blackened punk” in any way. This is the real deal black metal example of music. Although very raw in approach, this is not a terribly noisy and nonsense opus as the production is good. The riffs are the great highlight of this album for sure.\n\nRiipus is a little more dramatic, using hissing guitar sound, very simple but efficient approach. For me this is the best song of the album, and even though the vocalist Void uses his native Finnish language, it seems that one can understand the harsh message. Of course, I know nothing about the lingo, but that’s the impression. Great song, really.\n\nRuoska is another great song and it can be said that it is the mix of Sielun Tuhkaa and Riipus… the dramatic riffage is still there, but this song is a bit faster than the latter. Abyssal sensations are transmitted by the pure hateful atmosphere of the band.\n\nKuoleman Portit (the title-track) starts with a mid-tempo drumming to over again go to the same modus operandi as before, only that this time around the vocals are different and the guitars are not, well, melodic… The riffs are looser and not so impressive but that’s the deal.\n\nThe other tracks are cool but the aforementioned are aces for sure.\n\nAll in all, this album is an ode to the true Suomi Black Metal musical tradition in pure infernal metal assault and it’s essential to all maniacs and die-hards of pure orthodox black metal. If you don’t like this album go back to your fashionable bands…\n\nKuoleman Portit is out now on Purity Through Fire.\n\nRating 9/10\n\nThe underrated cult!\n\nFinnish Black Metal still thrives better and better, and this new album from Aegrus (the third full length amongst demos and Ep’s) is the proof of that.\n\nThey are slowly rising from the deep underground to show their bona fide satanic black metal (a mix of raw and melodic sounds). But the big question I want to pose is: why in the fucking hell this band hasn’t got the attention they deserve? I mean, this is the real deal, no shit infernal stuff, yet other bands with less interesting sounds take all for themselves.\n\nFirst song Hymn To The Firewinged One cannot be truer to Satan’s cause, fast drums, earworm riffs, everything blended with care to make the aural experience the better possible, while the second track Nightspirit Theosis with its imponent massacre of traditional sound rips the eardrums with gusto for disgrace.\n\nLonger tracks like Ascending Shadows and Nemesis are the way to go. The former is a mid-to-slow tempo song, repetitive but it brings something different than the purest flamethrower attack, while the last is a bit more complex, and while the infernal sound is back, this one deserves more spins to be fully recognized.\n\nThis is an album that brings nothing new, but that is the deal… No experimental bullshit. This band bets in a great production and if one likes Sargeist, Behexen, Inquisition, Watain and Dark Funeral he cannot lose it.\n\nAs if it was nothing enough, another release (an EP) is going to be released yet this month. The more the better.\n\nIn Manus Satanas is going to be out on Saturnal and the date of release is October 11th.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n(Roderick Totentanz)\n\nPlease, follow Dark Souls United on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/darksoulsunited\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DSUblog\n\nDirty and mean!\n\nThe filthy band Rodent Epoch is back with their debut full length after they’ve released a demo and an EP.\n\nThis time around the band goes fully into the dirty with extreme metal punk hymns and black metal attitude.\n\nThe production is a mess, and that’s that. Either you love or leave it. There’s no middle ground.\n\nThat said, the first song High On Hades implodes eardrums but it’s just the presentation of things to come.\n\nBoth Cult of Mission and Mayhem In the Courtyard Of God present a noisy form of black metal, with layers of guitar effects working as a feedback, covering the riffs, but that’s the deal. The more you go into the muck, the more you like it and decipher what’s in the backdrop. Although it may seem like a lazy way of doing things, the sound is pure metal, one just has to pass the wall of noise. Needless to say that sometimes the vocals resounds Darkthrone.\n\nThen comes the best song of the album called Red Heavens: it has a sort of old Satyricon riff (in a repetitive mode), bringing to the fore their full black metal side, a must hear for true metal heads.\n\nThe closer Funeral Master is another great song: imagine Venom but much, much more strident. Arrrgghh\n\nThe body count amounts to plenty of metal going through different directions but simply played for extreme and satanic rockers and headbangers. A binge in the hog pen. You might need a long shower after that!\n\nRodentlord is out NOW on Saturnal.\n\n(Daniel “Roderick Totentanz” Death)\n\nPlease, follow Dark Souls United on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DSUblog\n\nAlso you can communicate with us directly through Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/darksoulsunited\n\nDisciples of the Void want to present themselves as purveyors of the second wave black metal\n\nThe Finnish Disciples of the Void will debut with their self-titled album on December 7th under Primitive Reaction label promising to bring back all the fire and fury of the original Scandinavian second wave black metal.\n\nTo do that, the members chose to remain nameless to preserve the pure feeling.\n\nBut don’t you think that they are going to the sole putrid side of the style as their influences are Norwegian bands such as Obtained Enslavement, Covenant, and Troll and their countrymen Darkwoods My Betrothed, Thy Serpent, and Tunrida. If you liked or still like those bands you cannot go wrong with Disciples of the Void.\n\nTracklisting for Disciples of the Void‘s Disciples of the Void\n\nAd Gloriam Invictus Satana\n\nDominion\n\nThe Apocalypse Reign\n\nEnter the Void\n\nPer Aspera Ad Noctum\n\nThe Harvest\n\nThe Heirs of Wormwood\n\nChoronzon\n\nHome of the Once Brave (Bathory cover)\n\nClick here to listen to their fifth track Per Aspera Ad Noctum\n\nEnter on their Official Facebook Page and follow the news.\n\n(Daniel “Roderick Totentanz” Death)\n\nPlease, follow Dark Souls United on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DSUblog\n\nAlso you can communicate with us directly through Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/darksoulsunited\n\nThe finest Finnish Tradition.\n\nArchgoat is the archetype of destruction and satanic intransigence. Their history goes back to the beginnings of Finnish black metal and this says much about the new album The Luciferian Crown .\n\nTraditionally their attack is 100% inexorable, fast velocity, non-stop violence. But in this album, they’ve got a different stance: they are making slower songs and Finnish as they are it’s quite impossible to not link them with Beherit in the days of Drawing Dawn The Moon.\n\nBut, of course the comparisons stop here.\n\nStar of Darkness shows a brutal and raw blackened death metal, like in the old days, organic as fuck. Needless to say, they follow this pure sound all along.\n\nThe Obsidian Flames is the slow one: it follows a quasi-hypnotic tempo, repetitive riffs: the pure sound of evil invocation.\n\nThe title track accelerates things quite a bit, but always maintaining the monstrous sound with a good production, although the guitars seem like a chainsaw!\n\nThe thing that highlights however is the Sinister-like vocals. Naturally their sound has nothing to do with the Dutch band, but the way Lord Angelslayer growls sound like the early vocals of that band.\n\nThe Messiah of Pigs is a crazy interchange of Impaled Nazarene (old) with Beherit and of course, Blasphemy. Cool as hell.\n\nThis album maintains the purest tradition of the goat worship. If you know your real extreme metal, you know Archgoat!\n\nThe Luciferian Crown is out today on Debemur Morti Productions on Digipak CD, vinyl, Bandcamp and other popular digital platforms. Don’t lose this one!\n\n(Daniel “Roderick Totentanz” Death)\n\nPlease, follow Dark Souls United on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DSUblog\n\nAlso you can communicate with us directly through Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/darksoulsunited\n\nBeyond matter there’s only blackness.\n\nI don’t have repeat the obvious, but I will do anyway: Finland has the most satanic black metal bands in the world. Kyy is another one to the biggest pantheon they already have, with this debut album (their first release was last year’s Travesty of Light)\n\nThe song here is a muffed black metal. I know muffed is not even a good word to describe a black metal band, but the production is a middle ground between the true mudded sound and some balanced audible music.\n\nStrange as it may sound in a first spin, the album gets one by his balls: raspy, aghast, horrific music only for fans of Baptism, Sargeist, Horna, Behexen and Azaghal.\n\nSongs like Legio Serpenti, Death Within and mainly the desperation of Reditus pay dividends if one absorbs properly the noxious gasses emanated by the band.\n\nPanta Rhei is a pure black metal insanity, none so vile, second to none: fast drumming, classical Scandinavian riffs, heartless music for insensitive minds.\n\nIt’s all straightforward blackness with doubled vocals, like demons in a bottomless chasm of destruction, spewing blasphemies all over as in the track Erecting Temple of Adversary\n\nThere’s no attribute to this band other than pure perfectness! This is the kind of sound I’d listen everyday, all day long, if I had the opportunity to do so.\n\nBeyond Flesh – Beyond Matter – Beyond Death is out now on Saturnal\n\n(Daniel “Roderick Totentanz” Death)\n\nPlease, follow Dark Souls United on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DSUblog\n\nAlso you can communicate with us directly through Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/darksoulsunited\n\nIn a statement in their Facebook page, Horna closes another chapter of their incredible history.\n\nAs it follows:\n\n“There’s time for everything, and definitely an end to everything. Horna‘s show next weekend will be the last one for me. I won’t bother writing some self-important statement or some gay name-dropping thanks list, but of course bow down in respect to the past and present members of the band, it made up a big part of my life, thanks for the last ten years!” – Vainaja\n\nVainaja (real name Perttu Pakkanen) stayed with the band for a period of ten years (2006-2016)\n\nThe band also says:\n\n“We are honored to have had his talent during all these years of madness and fully support his chosen path. In times of change things often happen on their own and from next week onward the responsibility for drum destruction will be in the hands of LRH.\n\nThank you Vainaja and welcome LRH!”\n\nLRH (Lauri Rytkönen) is supposed to be Kassara from Deathchain and Larha from the classic Darkwoods My Betrothed. He is the brother of Spellgoth (the current vocalist of Horna).\n\nLet’s wait for the other chapter of their pure underground with LRH then…\n\nRead the full statement in their Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/Horna-Official-194755433889352/\n\n(Daniel “Roderick” Death)\n\nPlease, follow Dark Souls United on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DSUblog\n\nAlso you can communicate with us directly through Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/darksoulsunited\n\nPure Suommi Cult!\n\nThe best, I repeat, the best band from Finland and one of the best of the history of Black Metal is back.\n\nHorna is not a name, it’s a brand. One can already infer what the band has to offer: sinister and raw-hardcore Black Metal.\n\nThey are not one of my faves by chance: they always have something new even if their sound is simple. How they manage to do that is anyone’s guess.\n\nThey have no single bad album, but after the excellent Askel lähempänä Saatanaa, this full lengthy Hengen Tulet is even better, cruder and sootier than their other works.\n\nAmadriada opens up the album with a metallic drum set that sounds like it was recorded in a place with a zinc roof. Hardcore song with a break for some “mosh” part, although this is rough as fuck to be considered upbeat art.\n\nThe malevolent attack of tetanus continues in the second noisy track called Ajan Päättyessä. Over again the foul sound takes over!\n\nNekromantia is not fast: along with its ominous riffs, as the drumming goes in a snail pace the guitars become more audible, but the wall of metallic noise is always there! Perfection for it is, as always has been, the truest sound ever, one that rocker fans (do you know, those who like Burzum and System of a Down at the same time?) won’t assimilate and they will fall in the abyss of disgrace if they try the almighty Horna!\n\nTämä Maailma Odottaa is another northern attack of impure metal. Cutting like a rusty knife the music is extreme and boisterous!\n\nTo pack the total disgrace, the track Profeettasi delivers more of the same, but who said that I wanted something different? This is the epitome of a sequence of no compromising oxidized songs that is made to the sole purpose to faze posers, to blow false ones out of the water! Neophites are not welcome in this cult. Go away. Leave the black metal for the cultgoers of Satan!\n\nHengen Tulet is going to be release on September 22nd on W.T.C.Productions.\n\n(Daniel “Roderick” Death)\n\nPlease, follow Dark Souls United on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DSUblog\n\nAlso you can communicate with us directly through Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/darksoulsunited\n\nThree winters are coming from all directions without intervening summer…\n\nThe newest SW release doesn’t deserve a review: without hearing it, it’s all said and done: you already know that it is an über classic of the genre, if this band needs any presentation, and you REALLY don’t know what is all about I fear you accessed this address by some ISP mistake: contact it and change your service.\n\nBut, I have a say about it: BEAUTIFULLY played black metal, over again Werwolf is delivering the goods, it’s a classic riff after a classic riff, it’s a compendium of the very existence of the Scandinavian Black Metal, and of course, our beloved Finnish people never ever do wrong.\n\nFimbulwinter’s Spell, the opener, announces that temperatures are going to decline, even in tropical countries, with its menacing production and perfection: a real Sturm und Drang, the Romanticism of the evilest type is back again to prove the supremacy of one of the most respected acts in the world of true metal.\n\nRecurring to an atavism the high fidelity is stated in the track Funeral Wolves with abysmal riffs and beefy production, gritty vocals and fast drumming.\n\nKorppi is just a reassurance of the already known quality of the album, and by the fourth number When Thunders Hail one is already satisfied with the winter wave of Nordic/Suommi proportions.\n\nThe last track Silent Call of Moon’s Temples is a Burzumic ode to the “gods of GODLESS north”! Atmospheric/ambient plain but not simple! Beautifully executed with hibernal sensations…\n\nSatanic Warmaster is the best band from Finland alongside Horna, and together they make the bulk of the truest type of Black Metal produced in an industrial scale in the world of today. With them, nothing is left to chance; the other bands (woe to bedroom projects and untermensch bands) are just numbers to be forgotten. The cult of SW is eternal and sempiternal. After the Ragnarok, SW will be the corollary of its own work. Fimbulwinter, in this very special case, is just a provocative title for a band that will rule forevermore in the anarchic eschatological period when everything else is going to die. The eternal winter is upon us!\n\nFimbulwinter is going to be released by Hells Headbangers / Werewolf Records and will be out on April 7th.\n\n(Daniel “Roderick” Death)\n\nPlease, follow Dark Souls United on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DSUblog\n\nAlso you can communicate with us directly through Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/darksoulsunited"
