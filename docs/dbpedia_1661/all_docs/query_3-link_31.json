        "text": "Well, I’ve been reading more of Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries, and as such I have been finding more obscure bands lurking in the underground that never quite got the attention they deserved (or garnered that attention later, when they became something else). Thought I’d share some more of them with you.\n\nThe 3rd and the Mortal (NOR)\n\nThe 3rd and the Mortal is a band from Trondheim, Norway, who originally played melodic doom metal. Later they moved to a more poppy sound, but it’s the early stuff I wanted to focus on for today. Their metal releases, the “Sorrow” EP and their first full length album Tears Laid in Earth were both released on Metalion’s Head Not Found record label.\n\n[Trancy. Good meditating music]\n\nThe female vocals are really lovely, and the music is overall very stirring. Wish they had done more metal albums! The band’s lyrical themes include natural landscapes and sadness, which is, I feel made clear through the melancholy feel of the music. Lovely stuff.\n\n[Her voice. Oh my]\n\nBoth these early albums came out in 1994, after which the band turned to pop/industrial/experimental music. They are now broken up, and have released two compilations, one of which is comprised of EPs and rare pieces.\n\nFurbowl (SWE)\n\nFurbowl is a Swedish band that you are probably more familiar with by proxy than you realize. They started off as Devourment, then changed to Furbowl, then to Wonderflow, then back to Devourment when they came back in the 2000s. Incidentally, looking up “Furbowl” on YouTube will find you all sorts of interesting things.\n\n[Not least of them being this song, which, yes, is about sharks]\n\nOne of Furbowl’s members is Johan Liiva, who used to be in Carcass as well as in Arch Enemy. So, although you may or may not have heard of Furbowl, you’ve certainly heard of the other bands with which Furbowl are connected. The death metal world is a small one.\n\n[Some really, really early stuff]\n\nFurbowl only has two full length albums (at least under the name Furbowl) called Those Shredded Dreams and The Autumn Years. However, they also have put out their fair share of demos (the above is from the first one) as well as a compilation, which they released in 2010.\n\nMerciless (SWE)\n\nAnother band to have changed their name several times, Merciless is from Strägnäs, Sweden. Merciless was the name they settled on after cycling through the names Obsessed and Black Mass. They were one of the very first thrash/death bands to come from Sweden, according to Encyclopedia Metallum, getting their start as early as 1986. Unlike most of the bands I talk about in these segments, Merciless is still active, their last release being a self-titled full length in 2003 and a DVD in 2004.\n\n[Rawr]\n\nMerciless is probably most famous as being the very first band signed to Euronymous’ Deathlike Silence Productions. Their first full-length album, The Awakening, was released through DSP. Not long after Euronymous’ murder the band broke up (1994), but they reformed in 1999 and have been going strong since.\n\n[From their 2003 self-titled release]\n\nThough Merciless plays thrashy death metal, their lyrical content is very much in line with second-wave black metal, referencing hatred, war, and anti-Christianity. Like many of these bands likely are, Merciless is referenced in Daniel Ekeroth’s Swedish Death Metal book (I really need to get my hands on that thing).\n\n***\n\nAnd there you have it. Some more cool stuff from the underground. I am taking notes as I go through this book and trying to familiarize myself with some of these important early bands that are not paid much attention anymore. So far it’s been a fruitful venture; who doesn’t like to listen to ragged 80s Swedish death metal demos?\n\nI have a lot of cool ideas that I plan on implementing soon, but this week is already looking crazy. I’m trying to get school stuff out of the way in time for the break next week (so that I can actually have a break. That’d be nice), so I’m not sure when I’ll have something up next. Sometime this week, for sure, but Thursday might be pushing it.\n\nUntil next time, content yourself with these guys, who also made it into Slayer at one point.\n\n[Some cool stuff in the old Slayer ‘zines]\n\n-Hagalaz\n\nThe other day, Metal Sucks did an interview with Cannibal Corpse’s Paul Mazurkiewicz and the topic of the Big Four of death metal arose. Mazurkiewicz claimed that the Big Four of death metal, if there was a Big Four, would be Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, Deicide, and Suffocation. I am not sure; personally, I think Immolation should be on that list somewhere, though I would hate to kick anyone off of it, especially as I am quite the novice in terms of death metal knowledge.\n\nSomeone in the comments then decided to do a Big Four of Any Kind of Metal You Can Shake A Stick At, and came up with the following Big Four for black metal.\n\nImmortal\n\nDarkthrone\n\nEmperor\n\nDimmu Borgir\n\nNow, it is my personal opinion that Dimmu Borgir does not belong on that list. I am not one of the people who hates Dimmu; rather, they were a gateway (HA. See what I did there?) band for me to get into black metal waaaaaay back in high school. Their old stuff is particularly spectacular, and I think they were very strong up through Death Cult Armageddon. Nevertheless, I don’t think they belong on that list. There is already a symphonic black metal band on that list, and nobody, but nobody tops in Emperor in that respect.\n\nWhy Mayhem and/or Burzum is not filling that fourth spot on this person’s list I don’t know. But then herein lies a problem- both Mayhem and Burzum should be in the Big Four of black metal, and so should the other three. And then we are just considering Norway, and only considering the second wave of black metal. Blut Aus Nord has had far reaching influence both in and outside of France, as has Von from the U.S. and Swedish staples like Nifelheim. So, without further ado, I give you (I am taking into account here influence and innovation- I think most black metal bands nowadays can be traced back to these guys) my personal Big Six of Black Metal (with justifications).\n\n1. Mayhem\n\nSeriously. Anybody who does not acknowledge Mayhem as godfathers of the second wave of black metal is kidding themselves. No, they have not been as prolific as other black metal bands (see Darkthrone, holy crap) and have often gone far down experimental roads that have left even the biggest fans scratching their heads, but no one can deny their status as progenitors of the second wave. I mean, Euronymous invented the black metal riff. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas has topped just about every list of the greatest black metal albums of all time, and some of the most brilliant minds in the genre have played in the band. Fenriz claims Live in Leipzig as the album that birthed the second wave of black metal, and Mayhem has been lauded and admired in black metal scenes the world over, especially for their crucial early work. Mayhem should not only be on the list, they should be at the top of it.\n\n2. Darkthrone\n\nWhereas Mayhem has not been all that prolific in album releases (but have in bootlegs the combined weight of the entire band), Darkthrone has been one of the most abundant bands in the scene. Over the years they have released fourteen full length albums, and several demos, EPs, and compilations. Although their early stuff, particularly Transilvanian Hunger, has sometimes been called generic, there is no denying the influence of Darkthrone on black metal as a whole. The title track of the aforementioned album is, of course, one of the most instantly recognizable songs in the entire genre. Darkthrone’s attitude is also a reason for including them on the list; though late to the party (they were playing death metal until someone told them what was up), Darkthrone has maintained their stick-it-to-the-man, punky attitude in a way that most of their contemporaries have not. To this day, Fenriz works a regular job at the local post office, makes time to correspond with fans, and is an ardent supporter of the underground scene. Their later work has been very experimental, seeing the band dabbling in rock and roll and punk, but their attitude has never waned. Darkthrone does what they want, and in doing so they have never let the spirit of the early second wave die.\n\n3. Immortal\n\nWhen Immortal came on the scene, they were met with skepticism. How trve were these guys playing black metal so largely influenced by thrash, who write songs about the weather rather than Satan? Today, however, I think that there is little question of Immortal’s importance to black metal. Immortal reminded us that there is more to darkness than the Devil, such as freezing rain and driving snow, the grim, cold darkness of winter, and the stony bulk of impassive, towering mountains. Their fierce tremolo picking and relentless blast beats even sound like winter, and the ferocity and beauty of the season comes across in their work. Not to mention that their corpse paint, Abbath’s in particular, is some of the most instantly recognizable. Immortal has, in many ways, become the face of black metal, and considering that they seem to be genuinely nice guys, they make very good poster children. Immortal was the first black metal band (well, besides Dimmu) that I really got into, and they have a very special place in my grim, frostbitten heart. They earn their way onto the list for daring to take a different approach and proving wrong all those that doubted them.\n\n4. Burzum\n\nAnother innovator of the early scene, Varg Vikernes deserves a spot on the list. Though I’m not a big fan of him as a human being, and I assume there are others out there who feel like me, you really cannot deny his contributions to black metal. If black metal’s most important aspect is the atmosphere as Fenriz claims, then Varg deserves to be lauded, because Burzum pretty much invented atmospheric black metal. His early work is repetitive, but has just enough subtle variation to never get boring. Astoundingly simple, yet beautiful and haunting. Burzum also incorporated the “necro” sound of low-fi recording like its contemporaries, but almost using it as an instrument to help create the desired atmosphere. Without the atmospheric stylings of Burzum, black metal as we know it today would sound completely different. Varg’s implementation of Norse mythology and culture into his music is also representative of the pagan influence on black metal, which has been taken up by other bands such as Vreid and Enslaved.\n\n5. Emperor\n\n…And then there was Emperor. I don’t think I really need to explain how awesome Emperor is, but I will justify putting them on my list, inasmuch as it needs justification. Every once in a while you hear a black metal band and it becomes very apparent that the members of said bands are skilled and serious musicians. Emperor is one such band. Although it is perfectly acceptable to have earned your chops jamming in your garage there is something to be said for musical training, and Emperor soars to new heights in the complicated nature of their work. Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk was my first Emperor album, and it blew me away. Why? Because the album acts more as a symphony than a modern popular rock album, with certain melodies repeating themselves at various instances throughout the record and a coherent feel to the whole thing. Emperor’s crafty use of keyboards in their music is never silly and always stirring, and their melodic passages make the soul sing.\n\n6(66). Dissection\n\nLast but not least, I would have Dissection. Dissection were contemporaries of all the aforementioned dudes from Norway, but are strikingly different as a result of being from Gothenburg, Sweden, the capital of Swedish death metal. Influenced by that scene, Dissection’s music is melody-heavy in a way that the early Norwegian bands are not. There are guitar solos and there are folky acoustic interludes. Dissection is about as far as you can get from the bleak fuzz of Burzum or the heavy, Venom-influenced Mayhem. Nevertheless, Dissection’s influence in Sweden and elsewhere has been vast. Melodic black metal lines are still used prevalently today by bands like Watain and Naglfar (both countrymen of Dissection), and this more accessible approach has also been inspirational in other scenes like France and the United States, though both I would argue have over time developed their own sounds. Unfortunately, because they were not in the Norwegian black circle at the time that black metal took off, Dissection has not received the attention in the best of lists that I believe they deserve.\n\n***\n\nAnd there you have it. That is my Big “Four” of Black Metal. As you can see, this list is not definitive. My list comprises older bands, bands that were highly influential but still primarily second-wave. I have not taken into account the first-wave, with staples like Venom and Sarcofago. Many third-wave bands like Deathspell Omega and Funeral Mist have also wielded tremendous influence in the scene, and there are big holes in this second-wave list where bands like Marduk, Beherit, and Ulver should go, yet in an effort to keep the list short, this is what I came up with. Also, considering that the Big Four of Thrash takes into account commercial success as well, these early bands are perhaps the most notable in terms of names that people know (I certainly had heard of Emperor and Immortal before I had delved far into black metal). The list is by no means perfect, but I feel like it addresses some of the most powerful of the original innovators, without whom bands like Deathspell Omega might not even exist (can you imagine what DsO might sound like if Burzum had never happened? Certainly different).\n\nIn an effort to get more people talking on this thing, what are your Big Four (or more) of black metal? Do you agree that these bands should be on the list? If not, who would you kick off? Who would you add?\n\nStay grim, my friends.\n\n-Hagalaz\n\nWhy, hello there. This is where I have moved Merrimack, because they are not really raw black metal, and neither is Glorior Belli. However, both bands started out by playing very traditional black metal (blast beats ahoy) and then later morphed into their own sounds as they grew and matured as bands. I have also edited the past post about raw black metal to include Antaeus and Aosoth, since Aosoth’s early work really is more raw and they share as many qualities as they do members. You can find that updated post here, if you are so inclined: https://blackmetallurgy.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/words-as-weapons-raw-french-black-metal-part-i-the-french-black-metal-underground/\n\nA few weeks ago, I did a special on Parisians Merrimack. Like Deathspell Omega, Merrimack began as a pretty traditional sounding black metal band. Interestingly enough, Merrimack did a split with a band called Hirilorn in 1998, some members of which would later form Deathspell Omega. Considering that both bands would later take a more unconventional approach to black metal, it’s an intriguing coincidence that some of the brightest minds from both bands played on a split together.\n\n[I know I’ve posted this song on here previously, but Merrimack’s old stuff is surprisingly hard to track down on YouTube. This is true grit]\n\nTheir first full length album, Ashes of Purification, is a pretty standard representation of traditional black metal (in the French sense). The sound does not seek to imitate the Norwegian scene in that it is not fuzzy. It is not necessarily well-produced, but that is more likely due to a lack of available funds than a preference for low-fi production. Basslines are audible, and Merrimack (a reviewer once jokingly referred to them as “the most Swedish of the French bands”) plays a more melodic form of black metal, seemingly building more from the Swedish tradition than the Norwegian.\n\nIn 2006, Merrimack shifted direction sharply, taking on a more experimental sound. While this sound is certainly more exploratory than their older recordings, Merrimack never quite strays as far into atonality as Deathspell Omega has done. These later recordings actually seem to me to be more in the vein of Blut Aus Nord in their more straightforward moments.\n\nMerrimack’s new album, The Acausal Mass, came out just in June of this year. It is fantastic, and it is clear that Merrimack has found their niche.\n\nGlorior Belli recorded their demo in 2003, and have not been involved in any acts of bandcest with any of the other French bands I’ve discussed so far, which is kind of amazing. They too will be playing at Maryland Death fest next spring (yay). Unlike many of their fellow countrymen, Glorior Belli has only done one split and no EPs, focusing their energy into producing four full-length albums (and also another, which they released under a different name since it is not black metal. Encyclopedia Metallum labels it as “Avant-Garde Post-Hardcore.” Yeah, I don’t know what that means either).\n\n[You can hear the same kind of riffing that DsO does in here, as well as also some influence from Sweden (I think)]\n\nAs you can hear, the melodies here seem to draw somewhat from the Swedish sound, but the French sound solidified by bands like Deathspell Omega and Blut Aus Nord are lurking under there as well. Whereas the Swedish melodic riffs tend to be more solo-ish, these simply lurk under the blast beats before surfacing in unexpected places.\n\nGlorior Belli ripened into their own sound as their career has progressed. Their third and fourth albums in particular develop a sound unlike any other I have heard in black metal. On Meet Us At the Southern Sign they began to experiment some with blues riffs, which is really interesting. In his book Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge, Keith Kahn-Harris claims that the thing that separates extreme metal, black metal in particular, from other kinds of rock music is the complete lack of influence from genres like the blues and jazz. This probably arises from black metal’s roots in Europe as opposed to the United States, where such genres developed. Nevertheless, this is exactly what Glorior Belli is experimenting with here. The result is something that sounds a little like a bluesier version of Pantera with a black metal feel thrown in.\n\n[Kids, I’ve listened to a lot of black metal and I ain’t never heard nothin’ like this]\n\nI can see how people might not like it- it is a strange sound, and much more accessible than black metal traditionally is, so that may put people off. The clean vocals are also strange. Nevertheless, I’m intrigued by it. It’s some interesting stuff, and it’s fun to hear the glories of Satan sung to bluesy black metal. Glorior Belli’s last album, The Great Southern Darkness, experimented a little more thoroughly with these themes. Along with more blues attempts, there are a couple of instrumental tracks, and in some moments it seems to take influence from Nachtmystium. Glorior Belli, then, appears to be taking cues from the United States in the form of blues and Southern rock/metal, and in our own brand of black metal, which sounds pretty much nothing like anywhere else.\n\n[You can really hear the bluesy feel here]\n\n[As you can see, there is still black metal here, and some bluesy meandering around 1:46]\n\nGlorior Belli still, however, is playing black metal. They may be trying to find their feet in weird experimental stuff, but they have not abandoned their roots. The more I listen to them the more excited I am to see them live. Should be a treat.\n\n***\n\nAs you can see, I haven’t been forced to completely give up regular updates yet. My schedule is about to get quite a bit busier in the next couple of weeks, so I don’t know how often I will be able to update. I certainly won’t manage two big posts a week, though I may start doing smaller posts more often. I am also not done talking about French black metal. There’s still plenty to discuss.\n\nBut until then…\n\n-Hagalaz\n\n**EDITED 9/8/12 because Aosoth belongs with Antaeus more than Merrimack does, and because I have decided that Merrimack really shouldn’t be shelved under raw black metal. Shifting things around a bit. EDITED 6/6/13- Retitled.**\n\nSunday I started a mini-series on the French black metal underground (https://blackmetallurgy.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/metamorphosis-dissonant-french-black-metal-the-french-black-metal-underground/). I discussed dissonant black metal to begin with, focusing on avant-garde acts Blut Aus Nord and Deathspell Omega. Perhaps the best place to go from there is to the gritty, raw black metal from France. Though these bands tend to be more traditional in their approach, they can still be collectively identified as belonging to the same scene as the aforementioned bands. They utilize some of the same basic musical themes, like the stately, majestic rhythms and particular structure of melodic lines.\n\n“Words as Weapons”: French Raw Black Metal, The Visceral and the Spiritual (Antaeus, Aosoth)\n\nAntaeus are from Maisons-Laffitte, Île-de-France. Their full length releases are fairly few in number, as they have released several demos and splits throughout their career, seemingly a trend in French black metal. Their first full length album was Cut Your Flesh and Worship Satan (which I think is just about the greatest title ever). Antaeus’ early work is raw and grungy, but dissonant sounds and avant garde melodies appear pretty early on.\n\n[That opening is very experimental. Almost industrial sounding]\n\nTheir second album followed much of the same approach, with absolutely blistering blast beats and a dissonant turmoil of sound. Notice that although Antaeus is often as atonal as Deathspell Omega, they rarely allow themselves the slow passages that the latter often employs. Even the more mid-paced middle of this song gives little reprieve. This is pure onslaught.\n\n[Also there is some more of that weird industrial finagling at the beginning, and some choral bits at the end]\n\nAntaeus’ last full length album was released in 2006. Called Blood Libels, it was released on Norma Evangelium Diaboli, a small label started by members of Deathspell Omega and MkM, vocalist of Antaeus (we will get to Norma, or what I like to call the greatest little label in the cosmos, later). Blood Libels feels more mature to me; it is still uncompromising in its ferocity, but a little more controlled.\n\nEven though they’ve not done a full length album in six years and have only done one split with Katharsis since then (according to Encyclopedia Metallum; again, let me know if you know this info to be incorrect), Antaeus is not any danger of disappearing, as MkM assures fans that as long as he’s around, Antaeus will also exist in some form or another (orthodoxblackmetal.com). They will be playing at Maryland Death Fest in May, and are one of my main reasons for going.\n\nAlso playing at Maryland Death Fest is Aosoth. Aosoth got their start around 2002, when they released a split with Antaeus. Because, surprise! MkM of Antaeus? Yeah. Aosoth is his band too.\n\n[Notice any similarities?]\n\nAosoth’s work is, like Antaeus’, very chaotic. Blast beats abound, yet Aosoth in their very early work seems to have adopted a more traditional approach than Antaeus. Many of the same chord structures that belong to the Norwegian and Swedish scenes make their way into the early stuff. Aosoth’s sophomore album is called Ashes of Angels, and guitarist/bassist BST claims that this album is less specifically centered on the Order of the Nine Angles (a Satanic organization) than the band’s self-titled debut (masterful-magazine.com).\n\n[These more mid-tempo songs start cropping up as Aosoth matures. Not any less brutal, but certainly a deviation from their early stuff and that of Antaeus]\n\nIn an interview with OrthodoxBlackMetal.com, MkM claimed that although Aosoth started off as a side project, it has also carried on where Antaeus left off (after a particularly disastrous tour, MkM decided to stop Antaeus). Though that would seem to be the case, both bands are slated for Maryland Death Fest, implying that Antaeus may not quite be dead yet (holy crap is that gonna be amazing. Mr. MkM is going to be a tired little kitty cat afterwards, though). Aosoth, being later work, draws on all manner of sounds, including more mid-paced songs like the above. Their latest work, III, is a very experimental album that seems inspired by the sounds of their countrymen.\n\n[Really, really great stuff]\n\nI cannot imagine what it will be like to see this in the spring. At least the bands can’t be double booked…\n\n***\n\nNext time I will address Merrimack and Glorior Belli, another MDF band (I’m crossing my fingers for Merrimack as well. They’d be a great choice with a new album out, and we should just have a big French black metal party, I think). Having edited this post to simply address “raw” black metal (and later Aosoth), that post will be more dedicated to themes and variations on traditional black metal. Merrimack is not a raw black metal band, and neither is Glorior Belli. The latter in particular is extremely interesting and odd.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nHagalaz\n\nAs I have watched the list of bands for Maryland Death Fest 2013 unfold, I have become increasingly more convinced that I should go to said festival, even if I have to sell a kidney to be able to afford it. The list is just so good. I mean, come on, Carcass, Pig Destroyer, Ihsahn, VENOM?! (Okay, so Venom was never that good at playing their instruments and it’s doubtful that in the past thirty years they’ve gotten better. Still, seeing “Black Metal” live is a bucket list item, no?) Probably the band I’m most excited about on the bill, however, was Antaeus, a handful of Frenchmen who play gritty, raw black metal. Also, now I see that Glorior Belli will also be playing. My excitement over this prompted the suggestion that I should do a post on the French scene, and I reckon someone should.\n\nI’m kind of unsure how to do these posts. The Swedish black metal one was easy, because I could go off of how it was different from Norway to start with, and then it just blossomed. But the French scene is radically different from the Scandinavian one (for the most part). I suppose I will break it up into genres, and the best place to start is probably Blut Aus Nord, them being early. So here we go…\n\nMetamorphosis- Dissonant French Black Metal (Blut Aus Nord and Deathspell Omega)\n\nBlut Aus Nord is from Mondeville, Lower Normandy, and is probably one of the best known experimental bands in the genre of black metal. They were also one of the prominent earlier bands in the French scene, and one of the forerunners of the more dissonant black metal sound. Though they are always depicted in monks robes, Blut Aus Nord does not play live. Their early material Encyclopedia Metallum labels as atmospheric black metal, and I suppose that is the best way to describe it. It certainly uses a lot of keyboards, which Blut Aus Nord has always used, but it is also very clearly black metal.\n\n[Wait for it…]\n\nAnd then there are also hints of the more strange ambient stuff that they will do later down the line as well.\n\n[This is what hooked me, initially. So simple, yet powerful]\n\nThe band kept with their black metal roots, while transforming into something quite bizarre. You get a hint of that here in this next song, from their fourth full-length, The Work Which Transforms God. The sounds you hear here are sounds I have come to associate with the French scene, namely discordant guitars and effects with wandering, seemingly arbitrary shifts in the beat, and a very stately, majestic feel.\n\nThe 777 albums, the latest offering from this unconventional band, continue with the same strange patterns. 777 Sects and the follow-up, 777 The Desanctification, stray even further from traditional black metal and incorporate more avant garde metal with dark ambient noise.\n\nThe finale to the 777 albums comes out September 21st, and the teaser trailer sounds really good.\n\nThe other black metal band well-known for their avant-garde approach and dissonant melodies (probably the kings of dissonant melodies, actually) is Deathspell Omega. Deathspell Omega is from Poitiers, Poitou-Charentes, and they have never played a live show either. They weren’t always at the head of the avant-garde pack, though; when they started, they played a straightforward black metal.\n\n[Those strident melodic lines have remained, however]\n\nWhile Blut Aus Nord’s lyrics tend to deal more broadly with individualism and philosophy, Deathspell Omega is staunchly focused on metaphysical Satanism. This focus became more prominent with the release of their third full length album, Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice, the beginning of a trilogy of albums focusing on God, the Devil, and man’s relationship to both, in that order.\n\n[I feel weird breaking this song up from its other two counterparts, but I want to point out the melodies here. They remind me a lot of those in the beginning of the previous track]\n\nAs you have probably noticed, things are starting to get a little bit weird, sound-wise. Those melodic lines still punctuate the music- they come soaring out of nowhere it feels like a lot of times- but the melodic structure as a whole is beginning to break down, and the rhythms seem to shift and writhe all over the place.\n\n[Still great for the ears. Can’t say much for trying to wrap your brain around it]\n\nThe previous track is from Fas- Ite, Maledicte, in Ignem Aeternum, the second album in the trilogy. This next one is from the album that seals the deal, Paracletus.\n\n[This was my first DsO song. I was frightened away by it. Eventually curiosity won out, and now they’ve won me over. I quite love them]\n\nDeathspell Omega released a new EP (apparently a follow up to the trilogy) called Drought this summer with very little fanfare (in other words, I knew because I was paying attention and looking in the right place at the right time, but they didn’t exactly announce it). It has been very well received, as far as I’m aware, and DsO is getting *just* big enough that people are perking up and saying “Oh. My. What… Um.” Because admittedly that’s the typical first reaction.\n\nAnd then it grows on you.\n\n[“The Abrasive Swirling Murk”- it’ll grow on you (if Deathspell Omega had any need for a kitschy slogan, that would be it)]\n\nBoth Blut Aus Nord and Deathspell Omega have had tremendous influence across the black metal scene. The discordant melodies and stately feel that both bands draw on have filtered into many scenes beyond their own, but they have also strongly taken root in the French scene. Next time I will talk more about the French scene, though which aspect even I am not sure of yet (there are a couple of places I could go with this).\n\nUntil then…\n\nHagalaz\n\nSo today I’ll be writing this up at the last minute, because I promise I have been working hard on my Burzum post but my friend Jamie told me to stall a day or two because he’s going to do one as well. I know we have fairly different views concerning the matter (how we approach material by artists who offend us with their personal views, or offensive material in general), so that will be a kind of cool thing and I’ll link over to his blog once they are both posted. I do plan to continue working on material and keeping this up to date over the next few days, which means I plan a new post for Sunday as well still. I start back to school in about a week and I’m hoping I can still do the two a week thing, but I may have to go back to one. We’ll see. That’s later.\n\nNow I want to introduce you to a few bands that you may not know. As someone the other day said, “so many of the bands on Encyclopedia Metallum are bands that released two demos in the 80s and then broke up.” That’s true, but a lot of those bands were actually pretty good, however they have faded into obscurity because demos don’t do much for ya in this day in age (now, let us observe a moment of silence for the tape-trading days).\n\nThis is really one of my favorite parts of reading The Slayer Mag Diaries– getting to look up and find on YouTube these obscure bands I haven’t heard of before that kind of faded away, and figuring out what they sound like. And some of them really were important. Like:\n\nMefisto (SWE)\n\nOkay, so if you’ve read my blog you know I like Mefisto, but they never don’t deserve a mention on here. It’s not black metal, really, more like a weird conglomeration of black, thrash, and death (you can hear some Venom and Bathory-esque stuff in there). And pretty melodic openings.\n\n[Maybe a young Jon Nödtveidt was listening to that intro? Reminds me somewhat of the acoustic bits in Dissection]\n\nThey were good at that. Mefisto came into being in 1984, and were a big influence on Swedish death metal while not ever really taking off themselves. Probably most famous as Morbid’s biggest rivals in the early underground Swedish extreme metal scene, I’d say the two bands probably kept each other in check in the best way possible; that is, by making really incredible music.\n\n[Creepy little kids. That first scream raises the hackles, no?]\n\nWinter (US)\n\nWinter is a death-ish doom metal band from the US (represent) that split up fairly early in 1992. Like is unfortunately so often the case, no one much cared until they weren’t making music anymore, but they seem to have developed a bit of a cult following.\n\n[There’s not much of a bottom to it, but that is some heavy stuff]\n\nSomeone on YouTube commented that Winter sounds kind of like Celtic Frost, and they kind of do. Their vocalist certainly sounds a lot like Tom G. Warrior. It reminds me a little of this song.\n\nEither way, Winter is exactly what you would want from an old-school doom band. Slow, grinding riffs with a coldness to them that leaves you feeling like you’re staring into the abyss. And of course, the harsh vocals are nice- they mix things up a bit. This is no Candlemass.\n\nMortem (NOR)\n\nMortem is a really cool band. I knew that some of the guys from Arcturus were in a death metal band at the same time that they were in Arcturus, and I knew that band was called Mortem, and I knew that this Mortem was from Norway, but I did not realize that they were, in fact, the same Mortem until recently.\n\nThat was a mouthful. Ahem. But yes, Mortem is important because these are some of the same guys who brought you Arcturus. Yes, that’s right. Arcturus.\n\n[Obviously ICS Vortex was not in Mortem. Carry on]\n\nMortem was born in 1987 (like me, yay), and was never Arcturus. The two bands were completely different projects, and Mortem also had a revolving door of musicians (though they did share musicians with Arcturus. Hellhammer was in Mortem at some point for sure, though I’m less sure when those points were). Apparently they even got a new line up together in the mid-nineties and jammed around a bit; alas, their 1989 demo Slow Death is their only release (at least that I know of. Please feel free to correct me if I err here).\n\n[Even though the bands are two completely different styles, I feel like you can feel some of Arcturus in here. It’s got that weird carnival beat they play around with so much]\n\nMortem seems to have been most famous for their vocalist, who screams like the worst of the monsters you feared were hiding under your bed as a child.\n\n***\n\nWell, this post is getting a wee bit long- I was going to do five bands, but three is a good number too. I will finish up the Burzum post and post it along with a link to Jamie’s post, and then I will cook up something cool for Sunday too. And don’t think this will be the last of these posts- I am formulating a list of bands to look up while I’m reading The Slayer Mag Diaries, and I will keep posting cool ones I come across as I find them in hopes that other people like listening to this obscure old metal as much as I do.\n\nI will send you off with a random thing that popped up on the black metal reddit the other day. I don’t know what this is and have never heard of Checker Patrol before, but apparently Necro Butcher and Euronymous from Mayhem both played in this band. So have fun with it. It sounds like they did.\n\nAnd have fun hearing that guy from Mortem in your dreams.\n\nSleep tight.\n\n-Hagalaz\n\nSo I was browsing through my stats about a week and a half ago, when I saw that someone had come across my blog by using the search terms “why is the band Dissection so awesome?” Well, random anonymous internet queryer, I shall attempt to answer your question. Dissection is awesome for a plethora of reasons, far more than the simple fact that Jon Nödtveidt is probably the only person to ever successfully rock a face tattoo.\n\n…Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Why is Dissection so awesome? Well…\n\n1) They have a truly original sound.\n\nAs I discussed in my series on Swedish black metal, Gothenburg, Sweden is not exactly the heart of the black metal scene. It has, however, fostered the “Gothenburg sound,” making it a haven for death metal. Dissection created a sound that was truly unique by combining the melodic death metal of their home town with the tri-tone chords and dark feel of black metal. The result was a type of melodic black metal that gave Sweden its own sound amidst a Scandinavian black metal scene dominated by the low-fi fuzz of True Norwegian Black Metal.\n\n[Imagine all the little Burzum fanboys upon hearing this for the first time]\n\n2) They do so many things well.\n\nDissection nailed the death metal sound, and also did a fantastic job infusing that sound with black metal elements. However, that wasn’t the only thing they could do well. Dissection also incorporates folk melodies and a myriad of stylistic textures. For instance, they do this well:\n\nAnd then they turn around and do this equally as well:\n\nThose acoustic parts make The Somberlain a particularly well-rounded album, as the softer moments add a whole other dimension to the music. And then sometimes they blended the two together.\n\n[This song is a waltz, kids. And also, it’s one of the greatest songs ever.]\n\n3) They are a very accessible band who appeal to a wide variety of metal fans.\n\nAnother cool thing about Dissection’s use of multiple styles is that it makes them appealing to more than the standard black metal fan. Their death metal roots ensure that they will appeal to that crowd, and there’s just enough black metal thrown into the mix that us kids whose ears perk up at the sound of a tri-tone will get behind it too. Take “Black Horizons” for instance. That one song has something for everyone.\n\n[Play… ALL THE THINGS!]\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are enough folky bits that those who are into folk metal might be find something in Dissection that they connect with as well. And much as you trve kvlt folks may hate Reinkaos, the songs on that album, being of a sweeping sort of melodic death metal, probably appeals to an even wider audience.\n\nThere’s something for everyone in Dissection. People who don’t like black metal like Dissection, and that’s the sign of a band that’s just all around good.\n\n4) They were serious about their music and their message.\n\nI always made the joke that Dissection was Satan’s favorite band. Many Satanic bands follow the same rules in their music as they do in terms of their religious views- black metal, like Satanism, is only for those who seek it out and should remain in secret. Dissection’s music, however, appeals to a large crowd of people, as I discussed earlier. Death metal, black metal, folky bits, acoustic parts, they’re all in there, therefore making the devil’s music available to the masses. And make no mistake, Dissection was as serious about their Satanism as they were about shredding faces.\n\n[Have a vid with some lyrics]\n\nAs I mentioned previously in my discussion of Swedish black metal, Jon Nödtveidt was a member of the Swedish Misanthropik Luciferian Order, and ended his own life as a part of his beliefs. They also lost a member at one point who left to better focus on his esoteric studies. Now, whether or not you share the same thoughts is your own prerogative, but suffice it to say that Dissection never did what they did for the money. It was all for the art and for the Void and things they truly believed in and cared about, and that lends the music a sincerity it might otherwise lack.\n\n[“Lord Infernal, give me strength…” No, seriously. This is from the Rebirth of Dissection DVD, and when he gets to that part in the song, about 5:37, it makes my breath catch in my throat. That man is serious.]\n\n5) They influenced an entire generation of Swedish black metal that is also awesome.\n\nDespite Dissection’s sheer badassitude, they only released three albums, one of which some people thought wasn’t all that great (someday I will address why Reinkaos is perfectly fine, but that’s another post). Their influence stretches far, however, influencing the current Swedish scene in many ways.\n\nDissection’s melodic form of blackened death metal has inspired a whole slew of bands from their native Sweden. Naglfar is one notable one.\n\nThen there’s Dissection’s most obvious heirs and fellow Chaos-iphers Watain. Although their brand of black metal is also very melodic, Watain’s sound is grittier and darker than Dissection’s strident melodies. However, the blending of serious Satanism and serious shredding is still there, and legend has it that Watain will often play a Dissection song onstage in honor of their old pal Jon.\n\nAnd their influence appears in weird places as well. Although Funeral Mist probably has some of the most original sound currently in the black metal scene, it occurred to me the other day while listening to the Devilry EP that parts of this song are not unlike some of those melodic arpeggios that Dissection popularized.\n\nSo there you have it, random internet inquirer. There are many, many reasons why Dissection is amazing, and I’m sure I’ve only broken the surface here. The band’s influence has stretched far and wide but helped a unique sound blossom in their native Sweden, and their application of multiple sounds has ensured that their fanbase reaches the ends of the earth (did you see how many people were at that concert? Alas, if only I’d been among them…). Their commitment to their art and message also set them a notch above the rest. Dissection is, quite simply, one of the greatest black metal bands ever, and they unfortunately are not recognized enough for their music and influence (really, that’s why I wrote my big posts on Swedish black metal. I was hacked off that Dissection never made it on the “most influential black metal artists” lists).\n\nAnd that, my friends, is five reasons why Dissection is so awesome.\n\n-Hagalaz\n\nGavin Baddeley’s Lucifer Rising: Sin, Devil Worship and Rock and Roll is another book that my friend loaned me for research on my black metal paper. The book is largely about Satan and Satanism in pop culture, so the references to metal are supplemented by the surrounding events in the larger cultural sphere at various times. Although this book deals less specifically with black metal in particular, I much preferred it to Lords of Chaos.\n\nMr. Baddeley clearly did a lot of research in the writing of this book, and his sources span a large amount of time. During his writing of the book he actually became a card-carrying member of the Church of Satan, and Anton LaVey allegedly told him that he was a “smart cookie.” Despite his own personal alliance with the CoS, however, Baddeley presents his information on other Satanic organizations without being derogatory. It’s easy to see where his opinion lies- he’s super snarky- but he tends to be critical across the board and is always more informational than anything. He’s also not dismissive of theistic Satanism in the way that I felt that Moynihan was in Lords of Chaos either, which was one of the things that made me bristle when reading that book.\n\nThe interaction between the music aspects of the book and the pop-culture references is really cool. For instance, the take-over of heavy metal in the 80s is put up against the backdrop of the “Satanic panic” witch-hunts in the United States, in which it was believed that cults involved in a Satanic conspiracy were practicing ritual abuse on and abducting children. Likewise, Baddeley looks at the connection between Satanism and many of the more famous serial killers- and undermines the argument that they were Satanists in most cases. The book also details the rise of the Church of Satan in response to the hippie movement and talks about the Process Church and their music.\n\n[Some re-recorded Process Church music by Sabbath Assembly. This stuff is cool.]\n\nIncidentally, one of the Process Church’s magazines used the same cover art as Funeral Mist’s Devilry EP, which I thought was interesting. One of the best parts of the book, I think, is the intersection where metal and pop-culture cross over.\n\nAnother cool part is, like in Lords of Chaos, the interviews. Baddeley talked with LaVey quite a bit. He also interviewed many other major Satanists in pop-culture, like Kenneth Anger, as well as the leaders of some Satanic organizations. There is also, for us black metal geeks, a late interview with Euronymous, who discusses his own views of the Devil and black metal.\n\nI was a little confused as to what Baddeley meant when he talked about “black metal.” Of course the first and second waves are black metal, and Venom, but he did seem to be a little less exclusive with the term than I am. What other black metal bands were contemporary with Venom? I don’t know, and so that was a little confusing to me. Other than that minor confusion, however, I didn’t have any problems with this book. Baddeley is irreverent while maintaining an underlying seriousness. He’s snarky and I like that. His opinion of Moynihan also seems to be much like mine, which I will admit made me feel a little smug. Moynihan was an interviewee as well, which was kind of cool because you get to see the man not necessarily attempting to be objective like he was in writing his book. It’s easy to see where some of Moynihan’s biases lie and helps to contextualize some of the weirder parts of Lords of Chaos.\n\nThe illustrations were also really cool, and I was happy to see that the cover illustration was actually done by an American. I at first thought it was H.R. Giger, but I was wrong. It’s cool to see some Satanic artwork from my own home front. I also really loved the historical bits in the beginning, particularly Baddeley’s discussion of the gnostic cults, as that is a kind of Satanism that is very fascinating to me. I will need to do some more reading on this, clearly.\n\nSo if you are looking for a book on black metal in particular, this book may not be exactly what you need. Lords of Chaos, for all its problems, does actually address the scene itself a little better (though if you want straight from the source, pure, unaltered black metal you should read The Slayer Mag Diaries). As far as widening the scope, though, Lucifer Rising is the way to go. Unlike Lords of Chaos, it doesn’t get so close that you can’t see the forest for the trees at times, and Baddeley places the metal scene in context with the larger representations of Satan in pop-culture, helping to show how the two interacted with each other. It’s a fun and interesting read and I highly recommend it.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nHagalaz\n\n(Sorry this post is late. We were out howling at the full moon, and it didn’t get finalized until just now. Also, I learned how to do captions!)\n\nRecently, I wrote a paper on black metal and the environment (Scandinavia and US Cascadian black metal in particular) that I still need to upload parts of. The point, however, is that in my research I had to resort to whatever few primary texts were available for black metal, one of which is the much maligned Lords of Chaosby Michael Moynihan and Didrik Søderlind. Varg Vikernes and Fenriz have both shown quite a lot of distaste for the book, dismissing it as sensationalism or claiming that words were twisted, etc. In order to do thorough research, however, I have to show that I am well read, and so that means citing the available, well-regarded sources (well, well-regarded by people who aren’t members of the early 90s Norwegian black metal scene). Now that school is out, I finally had time to sit down and read through the whole thing.\n\nThe first half to two thirds of the book is pretty good. If you know the early 90s Norwegian black metal scene and the happenings therein, it’s pretty much just review. If you don’t know the story/stories, it’s a good primer, although much of the supplementary information I would warn to take with a grain of salt, which I’ll get to in a bit. The thing that really makes the book interesting is the interviews. Now, I would not be surprised if Varg has claimed that he has been misrepresented, or misquoted, or what have you, but my observations on Varg over the years has led me to believe that he just plain talks too much and digs his own grave 90% of the time. There is plenty of him in here. There are also interviews with Faust, Blackthorn, etc., and as the book continues the interviews remain really cool. I found the ones with Ihsahn and Ulver on Satanism to be really interesting.\n\nI did have some issues with the book, however. After the discussion on Varg and Neo-Nazism (which contains large segments of Varg being downright ridiculous), the book tries to focus beyond the initial crimes and scandals of the early 90s, looking at the way black metal has progressed in the world since. Here, I think, is where it falls apart. The author wants to push this idea of “resurgent atavism,” which claims that the ancient gods (in this case, the Norse gods) are more archetypes than gods, and that they are manifesting in modern society through these kids committing these violent acts. To me, this just sounds like a handy excuse for naughty teenagers, complicated by the fact that he refers to this “resurgent atavism” in conjunction with the Nazis- something about the theory that they were Wotan reincarnated. It seems to me like this just gives more ammo to the Nazi kids that the author, in my opinion, spends way too much time on.\n\nIt also leads to some strange divergences. The latter part of the book is all about this resurgent atavism, and it gets weird at times because they start discussing things like the Lords of Chaos, these boys in Florida who raised a lot of hell and have absolutely nothing to do with black metal at all. They weren’t metal fans. They were racists, but one does not imply the other and vice versa. They also talk some about the Electric Hellfire Club, which is fine but which isn’t metal. I guess what I’m trying to say is that it seems like they get sidetracked from their original premise by trying to force these incidents, which have little to do with each other beyond the fact that it’s all teenagers being jerks, under some kind of umbrella with black metal. And that’s where it falls apart for me.\n\nThe discussions on Satanism were particularly interesting however. I really enjoyed reading perspectives from Ihsahn and Ulver, and some of the outside sources were interesting as well. There was one interview with a Christian preacher that was fascinating- he was not judgmental of the Satanic bands but rather has a curious perspective on theistic Satanism as a form of Christianity. I was a little frustrated with the author’s treatment of theistic Satanism as opposed to atheistic Satanism- he projects this feeling that anyone who holds a belief in a higher power is stupid and childish and consistently refers to spiritual Satanism as “medieval.” As someone who has never been able to be an atheist, that’s a personal beef, but he also does little to separate the theistic Satanists of the sort like Watain from the kids who “sacrifice” people because they watch too many horror movies. That’s not the same thing, and it gives a false impression, I think. As a whole this section was really good, however, and it’s interesting to consider how the Norwegians in particular seem to be moving more towards Viking lore and away from the Satanic.\n\nHowever, anymore, where there is Norse imagery there is fascist imagery, and the book gives a somewhat disproportionate portrayal of the NSBM scene. Absurd and Satanic Warmaster are, I think, the only NSBM bands anyone cares about, and the interest in Absurd probably has little to do with their music (I didn’t realize that those kids who killed their classmate were Absurd. I learned that). The NSBM scene, while it does exist, is marginal in the larger black metal subculture, and no one takes it very seriously with the exception of NSBM bands themselves. Which is why they got so livid when Marduk laughed at their allegations that they were an NSBM band. NSBM bands have very little credibility. The book’s focus on Varg goes hand in hand with this issue, and they get a little carried away here.\n\nIf I were to make suggestions for changes in future additions of the book, I would endorse adding more well-rounded info in the section where they talk about black metal’s influence throughout the rest of Europe. Peste Noire and Drudkh didn’t exist when Lords of Chaos was first written, but I think bringing in these bands with clear nationalistic bents but no overt Nazi tendencies would really contribute something interesting to the discussion. I would also follow up on Jon Nödtveidt- as it stands, he’s mentioned alongside a less than flattering quote and then they talk about how he killed someone. Some more info about how he felt remorse for what he’d done and how he came out of prison a better person would be nice, lest people think he’s another Varg. Besides, it’s interesting to be able to compare him, Varg, and Faust all up alongside each other. Final thoughts- if you are a black metal fan and know the story of the early 90s Norwegian scene, the beginning of Lords of Chaos will largely be review for you. You should really consider checking out the interviews, however, as they present all manner of interesting perspectives, such as the preacher, alongside some of your favorite musicians. If you are new to black metal or want to know more about it, the beginning parts seem very accurate based on what I know of that time in black metal history, and you will get an opportunity to hear large parts of it straight from the mouths of the musicians themselves. Be aware, however, that the NSBM scene is misrepresented as being something much bigger and more important than it actually is- very few black metal bands are involved with anything neo-Nazi. Though some will flirt with the imagery, it’s usually in a blasphemous context and is not politically motivated. Also take the sheer amount of crime stories that the authors pack in there with a grain of salt. They get really excited with their resurgent atavism thing, and they go off on a bit of a tangent.\n\nLords of Chaos is a very interesting book, despite the fact that many of our favorite musicians don’t like it. For people doing research on black metal, it’s something you need to cite, through I’d stick to the interviews and the early parts- despite their determination to not sensationalize things like the media did in the early 90s, the authors get a bit over-excited with the Nazi and crime stuff and it becomes a little less reliable. The interviews themselves make it worth reading, however, and it is something you should familiarize yourself with if you are a black metal fan so that you can decide for yourself what is good and what isn’t.\n\nMarduk review on Thursday…\n\nLater,\n\nHagalaz\n\n**Edited for clarity and minor fixes- thanks to X for additional info**\n\nThis entry will conclude the Swedish black metal seminar or whatever you’d like to call it that I’ve been doing on this blog. At least for a while, until I feel the need to shout about it some more. We have covered the shaky beginnings of the scene (found here: https://blackmetallurgy.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/swedish-black-metal-part-i/), the influential second wave bands (here: https://blackmetallurgy.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/swedish-black-metal-part-ii/), and some common themes (and here: https://blackmetallurgy.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/swedish-black-metal-part-iii/). Tonight we will address the current scene in Swedish black metal, a scene that has me in a kind of orthodox black metal euphoria currently. Though I will not be able to address all of the great bands in the current Swedish scene, I will give three examples of bands that are influential and enjoying much success at the moment.\n\nThe Current Scene\n\nWay back in Part I, I made the assertion that Swedish black metal had always struggled to be noticed in the shadow of the Norwegian scene. With the crime and horrific violent deaths (RIP Dead and Euronymous) were big in the Norwegian scene, it was easy for the Swedes to get overlooked. After the dust settled, things started to level out. Bands became established and black metal turned into a thing beyond something to gawk at. But then the late 90s/ early 2000s happened, and the scene in Norway started to stagnate. Immortal broke up. So did Emperor. Nearly everyone in Gorgoroth was in prison, and when they weren’t the band was being torn to pieces by internal legal issues. Erik “Grim” Brodreskrift (drummer for Immortal, Gorgoroth, Borknagar, and anyone else from Bergen who needed a drummer) committed suicide. Darkthrone, while they are still big black metal fans especially of the underground scene, have started playing more traditional metal or crustpunk or whatever they feel like playing today, which is great, but leaves Norway a little shorthanded. Mayhem has survived, crippled but functional, but they release albums so sporadically it’s hard to count on them, and their early stuff is still considered their “glory days.”\n\nMeanwhile, Sweden had its own set of problems. Jon Nödtveidt of Dissection went to prison in 1998 on account of his involvement with the murder of a homosexual man. After his release from prison, Dissection released Reinkaos, which disappointed a whole lot of people (there’s a blog post somewhere in there about how those people are wrong, but that’s for another day). Marduk got a steady lineup and found a steady rhythm and then released the same album about six times. Don’t get me wrong. I love Marduk. Even in their repetitive moments. I enjoyed all of those albums including the ones everyone else hated. But I will admit that they got in a rut. The outlook for the Scandinavian black metal scene was grim.\n\nAnd then something wonderful happened. After a while, it became clear that black metal had not died, Norway had simply passed the torch to Sweden, and to a bunch of young, spry kids which we like to refer to as the third wave (and by “we” I mean “me and at least one other person”).\n\nAnd that’s where our story picks up.\n\nDark Funeral\n\nThough Dark Funeral started in 1993, no one seemed to make much of a fuss about them until much later. Their first full length album was released in 1996, and it had this song on it.\n\n[As far as I’m concerned this is the best thing Dark Funeral has ever done. It is fantastic.]\n\nDark Funeral is perfectly alright. Most people rank them as an 8 or 9; I’d give them a 4. But this is not about my unimpressedness with Dark Funeral and my resentfulness that they cancelled their show in February thereby stopping me from seeing Inquisition live, rather it is about their substantial impact on the black metal scene. Dark Funeral IS the third wave. They rode in on it. They had a sound that was new and different but that relied heavily on the tri-tone, and it sounded very evil (notice the kind of pipe organ feel).\n\n[Another catchy little ditty.]\n\nDark Funeral, as I said before, has a really identifiable sound. Despite not being a huge fan, I can pick them out immediately when I hear them. To this day I think they are the only band that really, truly, sounds like Dark Funeral, and their songs are catchy and more accessible in the long-standing tradition of Swedish black metal. Perhaps their most important contribution, however, was to make people’s ears prick up and swivel towards Sweden. They paved the way for a slew of more underground bands to get noticed, simply because people now knew where to look to notice them.\n\nWatain\n\nWhen Jon Nödtveidt was released from prison, he needed to get a band together so Dissection could do their awe-inspiring reunion concert (The Rebirth of Dissection. It’s on DVD. Check it out if you haven’t- it’s a really wonderful recording of an amazing moment in time, even if my favorite song did get cut from the beginning of it). Enter Set Teitan, a skinny kid with no hair and a knack for guitar playing. Also, Erik Danielsson, who played live on the last few dates of the tour after the band’s bassist quit to go study to become a better Satanist. Both of these young men would perform in Watain; Erik, or “E” is the recording bassist and vocalist, and Set plays guitar live with them. Sadly, this close connection with Dissection has gotten Watain labeled as some kind of baby-Dissection that is derivative and unable to create their own sound by people who clearly haven’t listened to enough of either band. If you couldn’t tell, I disagree- Watain is very gritty whereas Dissection was always super clean, and there isn’t a speck of the death metal sound in their music.\n\n[They were influenced elsewhere, however. Check out the opening riff alongside the Morbid riff at 3:18. I about spit out my tea when I heard that. It’s great to know that Morbid is still being honored! (Incidentally, the awesome occult-rock band The Devil’s Blood took their name from the above song).]\n\nWatain gained a lot of respect in the underground scene with their early work, and then exploded into the black metal scene with their third album, Sworn to the Dark, which features the following catchy number. Watain has since been at the forefront of the third wave, winning fans with their dedication to their dark cause. Extremely dedicated, they consider their live shows a ritual and do not tolerate people crowd surfing or stage diving during them- one video depicts one of the band members kicking in the teeth a fan who tried to interfere.\n\n[Watain is so good, I want to post ALL their songs. ]\n\n2010’s Lawless Darkness is an album I find perfect from start to finish. With a new DVD out (today!), Watain is a band every black metal fan should be watching, if you aren’t already. They are currently at the forefront of Swedish black metal, and black metal in general.\n\nFuneral Mist\n\nFuneral Mist, as I’m sure anyone who has seen my battle jacket on this blog can tell, is one of my absolute favorite black metal bands. Though the band began in 1993, Arioch (who was not a founding member, but was recruited later) was the only member left by 1997, when the EP Devilry was released (Funeral Mist released a couple of demos previously).\n\n[Another one you probably should avoid before bedtime.]\n\nArioch also did session vocals for the band Triumphator, which featured Deathfucker on bass (Morgan from Marduk also contributed some lyrics). Their brilliant little album Wings of Anti-Christ came out in 1999, and is a tough find (but is available on Spotify, where I have listened to it a lot). It, too is very good stuff.\n\n[Good ol’ fashioned orthodox black metal.]\n\n2003’s Salvation was a great success, and Funeral Mist became the talk of the underground. So much that when Marduk vocalist Legion left/was fired (these things are always fuzzy) in the same year, Morgan claimed there was only one vocalist that he wanted to replace him. Arioch said yes, and his contributions to Marduk have helped to revolutionize their sound. Morgan says he uses his voice as an instrument, which is probably the best way I’ve heard to explain it. He gurgles, growls, squeals, retches… It’s horrifying and magnificent. In a lot of ways, he reminds me of Dead- his voice is an effect as well as a vocalization (check out the above Morbid link for a comparison).\n\n[Now, that’s some good stuff. Check out the ending for particularly interesting noises.]\n\nArioch, or Mortuus, as he goes by in Marduk, is also a very serious Satanist, and dislikes the term “orthodox black metal” because he feels all black metal should be orthodox. “Black metal to me is as simple as it gets: it’s metal music with a Satanic, destructive message, or a devil worshipping message. That’s it, nothing else,” he told Blistering.com*. And Funeral Mist’s music is exactly like that- the inversion and twisting of scripture and puritanical Satanic themes. Though Arioch/Mortuus’ work with Marduk is perhaps his most famous and popular, Funeral Mist, along with Ofermod (another band who hasn’t gotten the attention they deserve. Perhaps a lengthier post later on?), kickstarted the “orthodox” black metal movement.\n\n[My favorite Funeral Mist song. Ugly and beautiful at the same time. I love this band/man.]\n\nThe above bands are only three of many that have erupted out of Sweden in recent years. As mentioned previously, Ofermod largely contributed to orthodox black metal as close contemporaries of Funeral Mist. Also, the Swedish band Shining patented an extreme form of DSBM. Naglfar, after remaining largely unappreciated, is also on the rise with melodic black metal reminiscent of Dissection’s early albums. And of course there’s Ghost- though they’re not black metal, the retro-occult rock bands have been closely linked with black metal since the beginning. Sweden is largely where it’s at nowadays, although other countries have had great success in black metal as well, including the United States (!) and France. The fact remains, however, that Sweden was at the front of the line for breathing new life into black metal when it looked like the genre could fall apart.\n\nAnd this concludes my much-more-extensive-than-anticipated series on Swedish black metal. Hopefully you will walk away from it with at least an appreciation for the Swedish scene, which has always been overlooked in favor of their Norwegian friends. Dark Funeral is on tour, Marduk has a new album coming out in June, Naglfar has a new album called Téras (great stuff), and Watain’s new DVD dropped today (with rumors that they’ll be back in the studio this fall). So in your black metal explorations, don’t forget the Swedes. They are very serious about what they do, and their efforts are not always as appreciated. So the next time you get a hankering for new black metal, check out what’s going on in Sweden (it’s highly underground. You’ll be kvlt).\n\nLater.\n\n-Hagalaz\n\n*http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/templateid/16951/menuid/5/tempidx/5009/catid/4/restemp/b%3A0%3B/fPpagesel/2 (source for the above quote)"
