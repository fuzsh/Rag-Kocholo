        "text": "Details : Wing Commander Updesh Sharma (21653) was commissioned in the Indian Air Force in the Accounts branch on 14 Dec 9l. He is serving as the Member, Air Force Pay Implementation Cell (AFPIC). His ability to carry out in depth analysis with clarity of thought enabled the organisation to employ him on identifying 5th CPC anomalies while having rendered only six years of service. His active participation and contribution and skillful handling of the issues enabled IAF to resolve satisfactorily majority of the anomalies. The officer despite being junior in service, as Senior Accountant Officer and Senior Administrative Officer of two Air Force Stations, displayed exceptional leadership qualities to provide best admin support to the unit thereby keeping moral of personnel high at remote and isolated locations. The officer while posted to Naval Plans was involved in the perspective planning of Navy. A task for which he was recognised and commended by the Navy. The enormous knowledge and experience gained by the Officer during his previous tenure enabled the Air Force Pay Commission Cell (AFPCC) to formulate rational proposal on Pay, Pension, Allowances and Condition of services, which passed muster with other two services for consideration of 6th CPC in a time bound manner. His hard work and rational application of rules and regulations has contributed immensely in achieving the goals of AFPCC. The vexing issues of parity and level playing field with civilians were analysed by him. A major share of credit for achieving some important goals like higher Military Service Pay and MACP for Personnel Below Officer Rank, PBA to Wing Commanders does go to him. His advice is keenly sought by the other two Services, DIPAC/PPOC forums, because of his vast experience and expertise. The officer with his professional acumen ensured that no recoveries were affected from the pay of AVM and above. With his extraordinary inter-personal skills, Wg Cdr Updesh Sharma has developed an excellent rapport with the officials of Ministry of Defence, which helped immensely in issues of various Government orders without delay. The positive attitude in execution of his duties, humane and fair relationship with colleagues and subordinates is worth emulating. The officer's capacity to undertake sustained research and produce quality analysis speaks volume of his calibre and professionalism. For the distinguished service of a high order, Hon'ble President is pleased to award Vishisht Seva Medal to Wing Commander Updesh Sharma."
