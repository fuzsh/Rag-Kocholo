        "text": "For RAN ships operating in shallow water, it is important to understand the phenomena of squat and wave-induced motions so as to avoid grounding. The British Admiralty Manual of Navigation gives guidelines to predict squat allowances in different conditions. In this article, we discuss current research in this field, and highlight the important phenomenon of transcritical squat and its implications for frigateand destroyer-type ships. What is squat? Squat is a shipâ€™s tendency to sit lower in the water as it travels faster. This is caused by the Bernoulli effect. Water is accelerated along the sides of and beneath the hull, and the free surface must drop downwards to maintain energy conservation. The ship essentially makes its own wave trough in which it sits, as shown in Figure 1. This effect is additional to the trailing wave pattern with which we are all familiar. Figure 1: The squat effect. (Top) Ship at rest. (Bottom) Ship under way. Squat comprises a midship sinkage and a chang...\n\nA new division of the Suez Canal in Egypt, termed the New Suez Canal, was opened for international navigation in August 2015. It is therefore important to ensure the safety of ships navigating this new section of the canal. Measures to avoid grounding and/or drifting to the canal banks are necessary. Additionally, accurate prediction data for ship squat and under keel clearance is crucial. This paper presents the results of experimental work carried out at the Kelvin Hydrodynamic Laboratory at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, to study the effect of trim on containership sailing characteristics in shallow waters using Kriso Container Ship (KCS) model. A series of model tests were conducted to measure the resistance, sinkage variations with speed, water depth and loading conditions under different trimming angles at 1:75 scale. The objective of this work is to examine the range of ship trim for safe and efficient sailing in restricted water in both depth and width. The study al..."
