        "text": "I went through the websites of Fortunate 50 companies and they all have a few common values that they care about. The values that drive their culture and that they look for in every new and old employee in their company. These top 10 values are: 1. Integrity 2. Innovation 3. Trust 4. Teamwork 5. Professional Excellence 6. Accountability 7. Respect 8. Adaptability 9. Diversity and Inclusion 10. Customer Focus A soldier displays all these values by putting the welfare of the nation, army and its people before their own. Here's how: 1. A soldier shows INTEGRITY by doing what is right - legally and morally. 2. Continue INNOVATION happen in the equipment and procedures improve the efficiency of our forces. 3. Mutual TRUST is the backbone of military culture and soldiers trust each other even in life-and-death situations 4. Whenever you speak with soldiers, they would never say, \"I did it\". Rather, it would always be, \"we did it\". They are best TEAMPLAYERS. 5. When it comes to keeping the country flag high, the stakes are high and thus professionalism can't be anything less than EXCELLENCE. 6. Military deals with sensitive equipment worth billions and matters concerning nation's security. One small mistake can cause national/international level embarrassment and therefore the soldiers are highly ACCOUNTABLE and take OWNERSHIP for their work. 7. Treating people as they should be treated is how RESPECT is defined in the military. 8. In VUCA situations that the military deals with on a daily basis, ADAPTABILITY & FLEXIBILITY are the most commonly used soft skills. 9. Military thrives on DIVERSITY & INCLUSION. It's a community living wherein people work together, eat together, stay together and even worship together 10. Soldiers keep the interest of the country and its people ahead. They are obsessed with their country (translate to CUSTOMER FOCUS) Anyone who has served in the military or anyone who has worked with a military person will agree that these are the same core values that the Indian military thrives on. Military veterans are great talent to hire when they transition from MilitarytoCorporate. Do you have a veteran in your team?"
