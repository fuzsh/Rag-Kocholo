        "text": "The BattleTech universe, because of its origins as a combat board game, provides a rank structure in the role-playing game and novels. Military ranks are used to distinguish a hierarchy within a branch of the armed forces and generally denote some level of responsibility and accountability for the individual. When the Star League collapsed, each house relied upon its own internally-used rank systems.\n\nThe hierarchy of ranks used within a house is specific to that house and generally aren't shared between houses. Mercenary units may choose to either use the house rank structure or, especially in the case of older units, may use one of their own creation. Mercenary officers, however, tend to use ranks that are easily related to existing rank structures used by the houses.\n\nCapellan Confederation[edit]\n\nThe military of the Capellan Confederation is known as the Capellan Confederation Armed Forces (CCAF). Though it is small and often under-equipped, the CCAF is actually among the most powerful of militaries in a one-on-one encounter. The CCAF is unique in that it places more power in the hands of the commander at the regiment level and less at higher levels than do most other militaries. Capellan units are often named after their commander; for example the first regiment of the Victoria Commonality Rangers is known as Kingston's Rangers. The CCAF is also famous for its use of Military Orders. Military Orders are collections of warriors organized on allegiance to a particular set of principles.\n\nCCAF units are composed of 'Mech, conventional, infantry and aerospace forces, and has long relied on mercenaries, more than other Inner Sphere militaries.\n\nDraconis Combine[edit]\n\nThe Draconis Combine's military (called the Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery, or DCMS) is much-feared in the Inner Sphere, due to its strong adherence to personal honor and overarching commitment to the Coordinator. Discipline is very strict in the DCMS and harsh punishments are often meted out for small infractions. At the highest levels of military command, officers who fail in their duties often request and are sometimes granted the right to commit seppuku, or ritual suicide; only through such atonement can an officer regain some of their lost honor.\n\nFederated Suns[edit]\n\nIn terms of strength of arms, the Federated Suns is one of the most powerful nations in the Inner Sphere. The First Princes of House Davion have always been committed to the military of their realm and every Davion is required to serve in the armed forces in order to claim the title of First Prince. The Armed Forces of the Federated Suns (or AFFS) is a highly disciplined, professional force that benefits greatly from technological advances from the New Avalon Institute of Science as well as the high degree of training its members receive.\n\nFree Worlds League[edit]\n\nThe Free Worlds League has a strong emphasis on combined arms tactics, with almost all of their regiments featuring a large number of infantry, armor and aerospace assets, as well as one of the largest navies in the Inner Sphere. The focus on BattleMechs, however, does exist within their elite regiments.\n\nLyran Commonwealth[edit]\n\nMain article: Lyran Commonwealth Military Ranks\n\nThe Brandenberg Edicts of 2413 established the rank system for the LCAF from 2413 through the Fourth Succession War. Following the formation of the Federated Commonwealth, the rank systems of both the Lyran Commonwealth and the Federated Suns were merged into a single structure.\n\nRank Equivalence[edit]\n\nWhile each of the houses uses a house-specific name for each of their ranks, the various hierarchies do allow for the comparison of ranks to one another. The table below shows the equivalent rank between the different house rank structures.\n\nOne note is that the Free Worlds League provided, in the Document of Incorporation, the allowance for each of the three founding states to maintain their pre-League military structures. Therefore, the Marik military ranks are based on the region to which an individual is assigned. The table contains the main Marik ranks. Distinctions between Marik and the Andurien and Oriente ranks are noted in footnotes.\n\nRanks of the Inner Sphere Houses (circa 3025) Enlisted Personnel Capellan Confederation Draconis Combine Federated Suns Free Worlds League Lyran Commonwealth Recruit Recruit Recruit Private Private N/A Private Private Private 1st Class Private 1st Class Lance Corporal Lance Corporal Corporal Corporal Corporal N/A Corporal N/A [1] Sr. Corporal Noncommissioned Officers (NCOs) Capellan Confederation Draconis Combine Federated Suns Free Worlds League Lyran Commonwealth Lance Sergeant Sergeant Sergeant Sergeant Sergeant Asst.
