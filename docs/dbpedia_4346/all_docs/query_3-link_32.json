        "text": "Ranks and insignia are used by the branches of the uniformed services of the Central Galactic Union to indicate position, responsibility, privilege, and status within the respective hierarchy. These ranks are connected to a Rank Grade. These are divided into Officer ranks, abbreviated OF, designating commissioned officers, general officers, and flag officers; and Other ranks, abbreviated OR, designating enlisted persons, non-commissioned officers, and warrant officers. These rank grades evolved from a common scheme of rank grades used by NATO, a 20th and 21st century Earth military alliance; this rank structure was adopted by the UN Security Forces and subsequent Terran military establishments.\n\nThe Defense Forces use ranks and insignia specific to their branches of service. Non-military government service pay grades all have the same rank insignia, including all branches of State Security. However, while non-State Security civil service and magisterial offices use a compensation system modelled after the military and State Security pay grade systems, they have very different levels of responsibility and relative power.\n\nThe various services of the Central Galactic Government can be categorized into basic civil services, uniformed services, and armed and uniformed services. This third type comprises any and all branch of federal service which mandates the wearing of uniforms and insignia, and also is authorized for the use of force through armaments, typically firearms. The Defense Forces are the most prominent grouping of these services, but many others exist.\n\nDefense Forces[]\n\nThe Central Galactic Defense Forces comprise those uniformed services under the administration of the Ministry of Defense. Each branch of the military has its own structure of ranks and insignia, including corps colors, badges of rank, and symbols which are unique to each branch of service. The\n\nThe Central Galactic Union Army has largely inherited its rank structure, compensation system, and insignia from the Terran Imperial Army. This includes the use of an eagle symbol as national emblem, the use of corps-specific colored collars and jacket piping on dress uniforms, the use of twin-braid collar patches for enlisted and officers, and the use of oak-leaf collar emblems for general officers. The eagle symbol was changed from a double headed eagle to a single headed one with outstretched wings, and was normally reserved for ceremonial uniforms. The symbolism of the national emblem represents the unity of mankind under the Republic.\n\nThe Air Force is rooted in Terran air warfare traditions relating to the American, British, German, Russian, and Chinese air arms, which largely began as offshoots of their ground forces. As such, they tend to have similarities with Army insignia and rank structures in their enlisted personnel. However, officers and generals have rank titles similar to that of naval forces. Its Terran roots connect the CGAF to both ground- and sea-based aviation traditions, which had varying levels of presence in Earth national militaries. The Air Force largely has its own insignia for officers and generals, while its enlisted insignia are virtually identical to those of the Army. The Air Force use a modified national symbol, depicting a single-headed eagle with beveled wings as if in flight.\n\nThe Central Galactic Marine Corps are structurally similar to the Army and its rank system bears many similarities. It is rooted almost entirely in the traditions of American and British Marines, which operated as amphibious shock forces for Army units, and likewise are organized and administered as part of the Navy. The Terran Marines and current CGMC have a similar operational role, though they are divided into three components: Space Marines, Ground Marines, and Marine Aviation. The latter two operate from surface warfare installations, including land bases and sea ships. The former deploy from orbit, and receive special orbital warfare training. All subsets of the Marines, however, have the same rank and insignia. Its primary symbol is an eagle clutching a globe and anchor.\n\nThe Central Galactic Navy descends from ocean-going armed forces on Earth, primarily drawing from the traditions of the ancient American, British, and Japanese navies. Its insignia are of great antiquity, little changed from British and American symbols and rank gradation. The primary changes in the Imperial Terran era were the expansion of the admiralty to higher grades, to indicate the levels of planetary responsibility for the defense of a world's waterways. Naval ranks and insignia are used also for the Public Health Corps.\n\nThe space forces are operationally a component of the Navy, and strategically the most important. This stems from the militarization of space in the late 21st century; it came to be dominated by American, British, and Chinese naval aviators. As a result, the Earth unified space forces primarily operated on Naval rank systems and jargon, which has continued under the CGN.\n\nState Security[]\n\nThe Ministry of State Security controls several armed and uniformed services, divided among three departments: Strategic Security, Internal Security, and National Police. Other ministries command their own armed and uniformed branches, typically police agencies; all police forces use the same rank titles, regardless of ministerial administration.\n\nThe State Security Forces are a \"second army\" of \"political soldiers\" commanded by the Ministry of State Security's Strategic Security Department. The Security Forces operate several army groups of panzer troops and air assault infantry. It takes many of its traditions from the Army, but with ts own idiosyncrasies based largely in Earth's military antiquity, modelling many of its rank names and units after Latin or Greek words.\n\nThe Protection Service is a uniformed and armed service administered by Internal Security Department. It is a force responsible for the protection of high-ranking officials and magistrates of the CGU, as well as others persons deemed of national interest. It also deals with counter-terrorism, investigation of assassination plots, and domestic intelligence and counter-intelligence. Its units are organized similarly as the Security Forces, but are significantly smaller in number. It comprises many enlisted agents, deployed as personal security detail. However, only commissioned officers are certified as Special Agents, with investigative and command power.\n\nThe Internal Security Service is the chief directorate of the Republic Security Department, and includes the Secret Police, the Intelligence and Information Directorate, the Alien Crimes Directorate, and other policing agencies with federal jurisdiction and special investigative power over political crimes and alien affairs. Unlike other State Security armed and uniformed services, it does not operate tactical or strategic units. Its agents operate largely on their own. Like the Public Health Corps, it is composed almost entirely of officers, though many were enlisted men in other services before being recruited into the Security Service. It uses the same rank titles and insignia as the Security Forces.\n\nThe Interstellar Police, also called the Space Police, is the primary investigative agency for major, non-political crimes that cross planetary jurisdictions, including organized crime, financial crimes, terrorism, piracy, and substance control. Like the Security Service, it is largely composed of commissioned and warrant officers, given its very high level of authority. Its NCO-level ranks are considered Warrant Officers, as they are warranted for law enforcement and peacekeeping.\n\nThe Central State Police oversees all provincial and colonial police departments and directly polices federal territories. They include regular uniformed police, traffic and highway patrol, and investigative police. Like the Space Police, and most other localized police agencies, its NCO-level ranks are considered Warrant Officers.\n\nOther Services[]\n\nAll ministries, departments, and agencies have a special office for internal criminal investigation. These agents are police investigators of officer rank, bearing insignia and titles corresponding to police grades.\n\nThe Ministry of the Interior contains several law enforcement agencies, within the Parks and Wildlife Administration and the Customs Enforcement Administration. The PWA manages national parkland, wildlife, and natural habitats, and includes the National Park Service and the Fish and Game Service. The National Park Service has law enforcement jurisdiction over national parks, but also promote conservation and environmental stewardship, provide emergency services, conduct search and rescue operations in national parks, and act as guides, educators, and heritage interpreters. The Fish and Game Service also commissions game wardens and rangers to enforce laws on hunting, fishing, and animal control. PWA uniform design, insignia, and ranks correspond to Army models rather than those of State Security or ordinary police forces.\n\nThe Customs Enforcement Administration has jurisdiction over customs and excise, with separate offices for customs, surface border patrol, aviation patrol, maritime patrol, and orbital patrol. It operates in spaceports, border crossings, and weigh-stations to enforce customs and trade laws. Customs Police have the power to search, question, and inspect all traffic and to arrest and detain suspected smugglers.\n\nWhile the Interior Ministry includes a bureau for managing all federal lands, Land Management Agency has no organic law enforcement and security forces, instead operating a liaison with State Security for these purposes.\n\nThe Ministry of Transportation contains the Interstellar Transit Authority, the Public Railway Administration, and the Air Traffic Control Administration, which are uniformed services. Each have special jurisdiction over their respective means of transport, with authority to destroy or disable aircraft, spacecraft, or rail vehicles suspected of endangering the public. Their officers utilize ordinary police ranks and insignia. In all cases, these officers typically rely on the armed capabilities of the Navy or the State Security for enforcement.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice primarily administers the judicial system, and operates few enforcement agencies; most internal security and police duties are handled by State Security. The primary enforcement arm of the Justice Ministry is the Galactic Marshal Service, one of two agencies empowered to deputize civilians to act as corsairs, privateers, and bounty agents through the issue of letters of marque and reprisal. The main duty of the Galactic Marshals is to pursue, capture, and remand fugitives. While holding police ranks and bearing arms, Galactic Marshals are not uniformed.\n\nThe Ministry of Social Services includes the Public Health Service, the galaxy-wide universal healthcare system. The PHS contains the Public Health Corps, a uniformed service whose chief of staff, the Surgeon-General, acts ex officio as head of the Ministry of War's Department of Military Health and is the Deputy Secretary for Health. The PHC is composed solely of commissioned officers, and wear Navy uniforms and use Navy ranks and insignia. The PHC does not have law enforcement capabilities, and instead acts as a body of leaders, advisers, and managers in both military and civilian healthcare service. While not often assigned to combat posts, all officers of the Public Health Corps are authorized to act as an armed service.\n\nThe Ministry of the Treasury operates investigative and enforcement police for financial crimes, specifically tax fraud, securities fraud, and counterfeiting. It usually cooperates with the Interstellar Police in investigating these crimes. These officers are usually plainclothes, but hold ranks and formal uniform insignia based on ordinary police grades.\n\nThe Ministry of Communications contains several regulatory bodies, but mostly devolves its enforcement to the Interstellar Police and other State Security agencies. However, the Central Galactic Post Office operates an inspection and enforcement service, utilizing State Security police ranks and insignia.\n\nRank tables[]\n\nThe following tables display the rank names and insignia of the Army, Air Forces, Marines, Navy, State Security, and Police services, with their corresponding pay grades.\n\nEnlisted ranks and insignia[]\n\nThe following table is of the enlisted ranks. Noncommissioned officers of pay grade OR-8 may be billeted as a First Sergeant, First Petty Officer, First Decurion, or First Watchmaster (depending on the service branch); this is a staff NCO position within the same pay grade, acting as the senior enlisted advisor to a company-level unit, including a police precinct or a Security Forces century, and entitles the holder to the aforementioned rank title. The pay grade OR-10 is for a special rank position; each branch of service has no more than one persons who hold the rank at any given time, acting as the senior enlisted advisor to the general staff of their branch of service.\n\nWarrant Officers hold the same pay grade as Enlisted, but hold different responsibilities and often specialist or technical expertise. Their titles are the same, but they are coded as WO instead of OR. Due to being warranted with the authority to enforce the law, all enlisted civil and military police are considered Warrant Officers.\n\nPay Grade Army rank Air Force rank Marines rank Navy rating State Security rank Police rank OR-1 Private Airman Private Seaman / Astronaut Legionary Watchman Apprentice OR-2 Private First Class Airman First Class Private First Class Seaman / Astronaut First Class Legionary First Class Watchman OR-3 Lance Corporal Leading Airman Lance Corporal Leading Seaman / Astronaut Lancer Senior Watchman OR-4 Corporal Senior Airman Corporal Petty Officer Third Class Corporal Constable OR-5 Sergeant Sergeant Sergeant Petty Officer Second Class Sergeant Sergeant OR-6 Staff Sergeant Technical Sergeant Staff Sergeant Petty Officer First Class Decurion Senior Sergeant OR-7 Sergeant First Class Senior Sergeant Gunnery Sergeant Chief Petty Officer Senior Decurion Junior Watchmaster OR-8 Master Sergeant Master Sergeant Master Gunnery Sergeant Senior Chief Petty Officer Master Decurion Watchmaster OR-9 Sergeant Major Chief Master Sergeant Sergeant Major Master Chief Petty Officer First Spear Chief Watchmaster OR-10 Sergeant Major of the Army Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy First Spear of the Legion Master of the Watch\n\nCommissioned Officers ranks and insignia[]\n\nThe following table is of the officer ranks. These are sometimes classed as \"field officers\" and \"staff officers\" in some branches, such as the Army and the Marines, but other branches do not retain this classification. These such officers are appointed to their rank by a military commission.\n\nPay Grade Army rank Air Force rank Marines rank Navy rank State Security rank Police rank OF-1 Second Lieutenant Air Officer Second Lieutenant Ensign Optio Cadet OF-2 First Lieutenant Flight Lieutenant First Lieutenant Lieutenant Junior Grade Aquilifer Lieutenant OF-3 Captain Flight Captain Captain Lieutenant Centurion Captain OF-4 Major Squadron Major Major Lieutenant Commander Major Major OF-5 Lieutenant Colonel Wing Commander Lieutenant Colonel Commander Vexillarius Lieutenant Colonel OF-6 Colonel Colonel Colonel Captain Standardier Colonel\n\nFlag Officers ranks and insignia[]\n\nThe following table include generals, admirals, and marshals, also referred to as \"flag officers\" due to their bearing of a specific flag of rank on their staff vehicles. These are upper-level leadership and management officers, as well as commanders of large operational and strategic units. Beyond OF-7, these ranks are held in relation to a specific command.\n\nPay Grade Army rank Air Forces rank Marines rank Navy rank State Security rank Police rank OF-7 Brigadier General Air Commodore Brigadier General Counter Admiral Brigadier Inspector OF-8 Major General Major General Major General Rear Admiral Quaestor Division Chief OF-9 Lieutenant General Lieutenant General Lieutenant General Vice Admiral Vice Prefect Corps Chief OF-10 General General General Admiral Prefect General OF-11 Colonel General Air Vice Marshal Colonel General Lieutenant Admiral Legate Assistant Chief OF-12 General Field Marshal Air Marshal Field Marshal Fleet Admiral Praetor Deputy Chief OF-13 Chief Marshal Air Chief Marshal Chief Marshal Chief Admiral Consul Chief of Police OF-14 Grand Marshal Air Grand Marshal Grand Marshal Grand Admiral Exarch Senior Chief of Police\n\nCivil Service ranks[]\n\nThe following table is the rank and pay structure for the civil service. While they are comparable to the military and police pay grades in terms of pay and benefits, they are not necessarily comparable in terms of rank, authority, and power. The Central Galactic Union generally expresses the principle of civilian control over the military and security services, though there is overlap in practice. The civil service pay grades are in the General Schedule (GS) and Command Schedule (CS) brackets, roughly corresponding to the division between enlisted ranks and officers; civil servants of the Command Schedule grades have command authority over those below them.\n\nAbove the rank of State Secretary, roles in a government agency or department are generally considered political appointments rather than part of the civil service career track, and include Vice Ministers and Ministers of State, though their compensation is determined by the civil service Command Schedule."
