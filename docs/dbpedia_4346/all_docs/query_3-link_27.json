        "text": "Navy Officer Candidate School (OCS) is one of four officer training schools located at Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island. This 13 week course is designed to provide a working knowledge of the Navy (both afloat and ashore) in order to prepare you for a commission in the worldâ€™s greatest navy. In order to earn that honor, OCS will test you morally, mentally, and physically to see if you have what it takes to both lead sailors and conduct worldwide naval operations in defense of our nation.\n\nTraining Phase Breakdown\n\nOCS Training is divided into four main phases, Indoctrination (INDOC), Junior Officer Candidate (JOC), Senior Officer Candidate (SOC), and Candidate Officer (Candio). Each phase presents its own unique challenges and experiences that build upon one another in order to prepare you for life as a commissioned officer. Your personal Honor, Courage, and Commitment will be tested at OCS and you will be challenged to live up to the highest standards of these values.\n\nA successful officer candidate is one who embraces the mission of OCS, and develops the ability to execute basic Naval officer functions that are expected upon earning a commission as an Ensign in the United States Navy.\n\nTRAVEL TO NAVAL STATION NEWPORT\n\nIf Flying:\n\nUpon arrival at T.F.
