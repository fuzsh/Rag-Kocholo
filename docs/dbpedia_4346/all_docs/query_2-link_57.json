It operates the BAe Hawk aircraft.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWorld War I[]\n\nThe squadron was established as part of the Royal Naval Air Service on 25 October 1916[10][11] at Dunkirk as No. 8 (Naval) Squadron. In its earlier days, the unit flew Sopwith Pups, 1½ Strutters and Nieuport Scouts. Later in World War I it re-equipped with Sopwith Camels and was assigned to artillery spotting. The squadron returned to the UK briefly before being sent back to France to face the German offensive. While in France a significant number of Camels belonging to the squadron were destroyed by the RAF to prevent the Germans capturing them during their advance. When the Royal Air Force was formed on 1 April 1918, the unit was renumbered to No. 208 Squadron RAF. After the war ended 208 Squadron remained with the occupying forces until August 1919, when it again returned to the UK for disbandment on 7 November 1919 at Netheravon.[12]\n\nDuring the war, the squadron claimed 298 victories. Twenty-five aces had served in the squadron. Notable among them were Anthony Arnold, Charles Dawson Booker, Robert J. O. Compston, Harold Day, Stanley Goble, Edward Grahame Johnstone, William Lancelot Jordan, Robert A. Little, William E. G. Mann, Richard Munday, Guy William Price, George Simpson, Reginald Soar, Ronald Thornley, and James White.[13]\n\nInterbellum[]\n\nThe squadron reformed at RAF Ismailia in Egypt on 1 February 1920 by the renumbering of No. 113 Squadron RAF.[14] It was at first equipped with RE8s and from November 1920 till May 1930 with Bristol Fighters. The years between the wars were by no means quiet, in September 1922 the squadron was sent to Turkey for a year during the Chanak crisis, being stationed at San Stefano, a part of the Bakırköy district of Istanbul, Turkey.[14] After the conflict 208 Squadron went back to Egypt and in 1930 got Armstrong Whitworth Atlas aircraft to replace the old Bristol fighters. The Atlases in their turn were replaced five years later by Audaxes and for one flight by Demons. Just before the outbreak of World War II, in January 1939, these gave way for the Westland Lysander.[15]\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nNo. 208 Squadron was still stationed in Egypt at the outbreak of World War II. It joined the war effort in mid-1940 flying Westland Lysander reconnaissance aircraft and Hawker Hurricane fighters on army co-operation duties in the North African Campaign[16] and the Greek Campaign of 1941. During the war it included a significant number of Royal Australian Air Force and South African Air Force personnel, along with other nationalities. Amongst the members of the squadron at this time was Robert Leith-Macgregor, shot down on more than one occasion, once ending up taxiing through a minefield, but managed not to trigger any mines.[17]\n\nThe unit was later stationed in Palestine, before returning to North Africa. It briefly converted to Curtiss Tomahawks, but received Supermarine Spitfires in late 1943 and flew them for the remainder of the war. From 1944, it took part in the Italian Campaign.\n\nAfter World War II[]\n\nShortly after the war 208 Squadron moved back to Palestine where it was involved in operations against the Egyptian Air Force. In 1948, the squadron moved to the Egyptian Canal Zone. It saw action in the Israeli War of Independence, losing four Spitfires in combat with Israeli Air Force aircraft (which also included Spitfires). The last officially recorded \"Air to Air fighter pilot kill\" (bullets only without guidance systems) occurred on 22 May 1948, at 09:30 two Egyptian Spitfire LF.9s decided to stage a third attack on Ramat David. This time Fg Off Tim McElhaw and Fg Off Hully of 208 Squadron had taken over the standing patrol. Fg Off McElhaw, flying Spitfire FR.18 TZ228, managed to intercept and shoot down both LF.9s.[18]\n\nIn 1951, the squadron relocated to RAF Fayid where its Spitfires were replaced with Gloster Meteor jets. From there it moved to RAF Abu Sueir, relocating to RAF Takali, Malta, in August 1956, with interim spells earlier in the year at RAF Hal Far, Malta, and RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus. It disbanded at Takhali in January 1958, but it reformed the same month in the UK at RAF Tangmere from a nucleus of No. 34 Squadron RAF.[19] Two months later it returned to the Middle East with de Havilland Vampires and subsequently Hawker Hunter FGA.9s. In 1958 and early 1959 it operated from RAF Nicosia and RAF Akrotiri with a detachment at Amman, Jordan. The squadron disbanded at RAF Akrotiri on 31 March 1959. The next day, 1 April 1959, it reformed at RAF Eastleigh, Nairobi, Kenya, by the re-numbering of No. 142 Squadron RAF under Squadron Leader R. Ramirez.[20] It operated from Eastleigh from April 1959 to March 1960, being redeployed home to RAF Stradishall from March to June 1960, but returning to Eastleigh in June, sending detachments to Kuwait and Bahrain during the period. It was moved to RAF Khormaksar in Aden in November 1961, under Air Forces Arabian Peninsula, which became Air Forces Middle East the same year.[21] In June 1964 it moved to Muharraq in Bahrain.The squadron remained in the Middle East until September 1971 when it was disbanded as a consequence of British drawdown of the armed forces from East of Suez.\n\nFlying Buccaneers[]\n\n208 Squadron reformed at RAF Honington in 1974 with Blackburn Buccaneer S2s, assigned to SACEUR operating in a low-level strike role. The squadron's twelve Buccaneers were declared operational to SACEUR from 1975 armed with twentyfour WE.177 nuclear weapons.[22] The squadron was tasked with supporting land forces resisting an advance by the Warsaw Pact into western Europe, by striking at enemy forces, logistics and infrastructure beyond the forward edge of the battlefield, initially with conventional munitions, and with nuclear weapons in the event of escalation.[23] The allocation of the British-owned WE.177 weapon freed the squadron from the time-consuming burden, at a critical time, of using US-owned nuclear weapons held in US custody at a central location. The squadron continued in this role based at RAF Honington until late 1983,[24] when it moved base to RAF Lossiemouth and was re-assigned to SACLANT for maritime strike duties. The squadron's allocation of WE.177 nuclear weapons was reduced to twelve, one per aircraft,[25] although the Buccaneer was able to carry two in its internal bomb bay.[26] The squadron continued in this role until late 1993[27] when it relinquished its nuclear weapons. The unit was one of the last squadrons to operate the Buccaneer before it went out of service in 1994, and after the type's retirement the squadron again disbanded on 31 March 1994.[12]\n\nPresent role[]\n\n208 Squadron reformed again on 1 April 1994 from 234 (Reserve) Squadron, attached to No. 4 Flying Training School. It moved to RAF Valley operating the BAe Hawk that it continues to fly to this day. No.4 FTS is made up of two squadrons; 208 Squadron provides the advanced flying training, students then moving onto No. 4(R) Squadron to receive tactics and weapons training. The vast majority of sorties undertaken by 208 Squadron are flown to teach RAF ab-initio pilots the fundamental skills of flying a fast-jet, to prepare them for tactical weapons training and onwards towards front-line aircraft such as the Tornado, Harrier and Typhoon. A summary of 208 Squadron's present tasks:\n\nAdvanced flying training\n\nTo train RAF, RN and some foreign ab-initio pilots as per the Personnel Training Command (HQPTC) Training Task Programme to Tactical Weapons Unit (TWU) entry standard.\n\nTo re-train RAF and RN multi-engine and rotary pilots as per the HQPTC training Task Programme to TWU entry standard.\n\nTo refresh Short Tucano QFIs as per the HQPTC Training Task Programme to TWU entry standard.\n\nInstructor training\n\nTo train Hawk QFIs as per the HQPTC Training Task Programme to B2 standard in accordance with the current Central Flying School (CFS) syllabuses.\n\nTo upgrade Hawk QFIs to B1, A2 and A1 standard in accordance with the 208 Squadron staff training requirements and CFS syllabuses.\n\nTo train Hawk IREs in accordance with the current CFS syllabuses.\n\nTo convert Qualified Flying Instructors (Tactical Sequences) and Qualified Pilot Navigation Instructors into Hawk QFIs as per the Headquarters HQPTC training Task Programme to B2 standard in accordance with the current CFS syllabuses.\n\nConversion training\n\nTo provide a common conversion course for all qualified pilots re-roling to the Hawk.\n\nTo provide United Kingdom Orientation training for Foreign and Commonwealth pilots destined for fast-jet appointments.\n\nTo provide conversion training for pilots destined for the Royal Air Force Aerobatics Team.\n\nOn 20 April 2007, a BaE Hawk from the squadron crashed near RAF Mona. The pilot was taken to hospital and discharged soon after. The accident was caused by a solo student stalling the aircraft on an overshoot.[28]\n\nAircraft operated[]\n\nAircraft operated by No. 8 Squadron RNAS and no. 208 Squadron RAF, data from[12][15][29] From To Aircraft Version October 1916 November 1916 Sopwith 1½ Strutter October 1916 December 1916 Nieuport Scout October 1916 February 1917 Sopwith Pup February 1917 September 1917 Sopwith Triplane September 1917 November 1918 Sopwith Camel November 1918 September 1919 Sopwith Snipe February 1920 November 1920 Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 November 1920 May 1930 Bristol F.2 Fighter F.2b May 1930 August 1935 Armstrong Whitworth Atlas August 1935 January 1939 Hawker Audax September 1935 March 1936 Hawker Demon January 1939 May 1942 Westland Lysander Mks.I, II November 1940 September 1942 Hawker Hurricane Mk.I May 1941 June 1941 Hawker Audax May 1942 September 1942 Curtiss Tomahawk Mk.IIb May 1942 December 1943 Hawker Hurricane Mks.IIa, IIb, IIc December 1943 July 1944 Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vc March 1944 June 1947 Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IX August 1944 October 1944 Supermarine Spitfire Mk.VIII August 1946 March 1957 Supermarine Spitfire FR.18 March 1951 January 1958 Gloster Meteor FR.9 January 1958 February 1958 Hawker Hunter F.5 January 1958 March 1959 Hawker Hunter F.6 April 1959 March 1960 de Havilland Venom FB.4 March 1960 September 1971 Hawker Hunter FGA.9 October 1974 March 1994 Blackburn Buccaneer S.2A, S.2B April 1994 Present BAe Hawk T.1, T1A\n\nReferences[]\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n[]"
