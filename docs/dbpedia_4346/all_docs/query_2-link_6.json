Major Sketchley, who was with the supports, assisted by Lance-Corporal J. G. Way, prevented some of these men from retiring. further. He then gathered together about 40 of them, reorganised them, and leading them forward, reoccupied some of the trenches.

During this time no attempt was made to return to Headquarters at Mafia, although it was obvious that this could not be done unless a start was made at once. Flight Sub-Lieutenant Arnold continued to send his spotting signals the whole time, and when a quarter of an hour later the machine was again hit and forced to descend, Flight Commander Cull controlled the machine and Flight Sub-Lieutenant Arnold continued to send spotting corrections to the last, after warning the Monitors that they were coming down, and would endeavour to land near them.

Little followed him closely down to 500 ft., the enemy machine falling out of control. On 20th July, 1917, he attacked a D.F.W. After a short fight, the enemy machine dived vertically.
