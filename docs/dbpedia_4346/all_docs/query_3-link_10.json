        "text": "Definition:\n\nan enlisted person of the lowest rank in the marine corps or of one of the two lowest ranks in the army\n\nIn some languages, the lowest and most basic rank for soldiers is simply the word soldier. Private is in fact short for private soldier, and it has its origins in the U.S. Army—the first known use of the term comes from the correspondence of George Washington.\n\nThere are other words for “common soldier” or the lowest army rank, some of them particular to the British army, including fusilier, guardsman, rifleman, and trooper.\n\nThe rank insignia, shown as a cloth patch on the sleeve or a metal collar pin, is a single chevron.\n\nDefinition:\n\nan enlisted man ranking in the army above a private and below a corporal and in the marine corps above a private and below a lance corporal\n\nThe rank of private first class was added to the U.S. Army in the mid-1800s as an intermediate designation between private and corporal that usually represented successful completion of specialized training or the attainment of diploma or degree of some kind. Its rank insignia is a single chevron pointing up with a single arc or line curving down that joins to each point of the bottom of the chevron.\n\nDefinition:\n\na noncommissioned officer ranking in the army above a private first class and below a sergeant and in the marine corps above a lance corporal and below a sergeant\n\nIt might be tempting to connect the lowest grade of noncommissioned officer—presumably someone who disciplines soldiers—with corporal punishment, but that’s not where this word comes from.\n\nThe corporal in corporal punishment comes from the Latin word for “body,” corpus. But the military rank actually comes from the French word for “head of a small unit of soldiers,” caporal, ultimately from the Latin word for “head,” caput, which is also the root of the name for the rank of the head of a company of soldiers, captain.\n\nIt seems possible that the influence of corpus and the French-derived word corps meaning “a group of soldiers” caused the word caporal to evolve into corporal. It’s a strange mixing up of root words meaning “body” and “head” in order to arrive at corporal. The rank of lance corporal is used in the U.S. Marine Corps and represents a rank above a private first class and below a corporal.\n\nDefinition:\n\nan enlisted rank in the U.S. Army corresponding to the grade of corporal\n\nalso : any of several former enlisted ranks corresponding to the grades of sergeant through sergeant major\n\nIn order to acknowledge training and ability for certain military roles, the rank of specialist was created to give the same pay status of a noncommissioned officer without the command responsibilities. The rank of specialist was created in 1955 for the U.S. Army. Specialists may have roles such as medic, musician, engineer, or military police.\n\nDuring World War II, a similar position was called technician and was indicated by the letter T printed under the stripes of a corporal or sergeant.\n\nDefinition:\n\na noncommissioned officer ranking in the army and marine corps above a corporal and below a staff sergeant Sergeant is the common name for many of the noncommissioned officer ranks. Often these are the people directly responsible for training and leadership of soldiers in the field.\n\nThe word sergeant has the same Latin root as servant. The original military use of sergeant was the term sergeant at arms—the position was an “armed servant” of a medieval lord. (Today a sergeant at arms is the title of a person who preserves order, makes ceremonial announcements, and provides security for courtrooms and legislative chambers.)\n\nA drill sergeant is responsible for training soldiers. There are many varieties of sergeants, including a hierarchy of specific ranks denoting duties and seniority, given in detail below.\n\nThe insignia for the rank of sergeant in most U.S. armed forces and police is three upward chevrons. As the different kinds of sergeant rise in seniority, arcs or curved lines below the chevrons indicate increasing rank.\n\nStaff sergeant\n\na noncommissioned officer ranking in the army above a sergeant and below a platoon sergeant or sergeant first class, in the air force above a sergeant and below a technical sergeant, and in the marine corps above a sergeant and below a gunnery sergeant\n\nSergeant first class\n\na noncommissioned officer in the army ranking above a staff sergeant and below a master sergeant\n\nMaster sergeant\n\na noncommissioned officer ranking in the army above a sergeant first class and below a staff sergeant major, in the air force above a technical sergeant and below a senior master sergeant, and in the marine corps above a gunnery sergeant and below a master gunnery sergeant\n\nFirst sergeant\n\na rank in the army above a sergeant first class and below a sergeant major and in the marine corps above a gunnery sergeant and below a master gunnery sergeant\n\nSergeant major\n\n1 : a noncommissioned officer in the marine corps ranking above a first sergeant\n\n2 : a noncommissioned officer in the army, air force, or marine corps serving as chief administrative assistant in a headquarters\n\nCommand sergeant major\n\na noncommissioned officer in the army ranking above a first sergeant\n\nSergeant major of the Army\n\nthe ranking noncommissioned officer of the army serving as adviser to the chief of staff\n\nDefinition:\n\n1 : an officer in the armed forces holding rank by virtue of a warrant and ranking above a noncommissioned officer and below a commissioned officer\n\n2 : a commissioned officer ranking below an ensign in the navy or coast guard and below a second lieutenant in the marine corps\n\nA warrant officer ranks above a noncommissioned officer and below a commissioned officer. Normally a warrant officer has a specialization or skill such as a pilot or a technical specialist rather than command of a unit of soldiers or sailors.\n\nWarrant is used to distinguish warrant officers from commissioned officers, and even though warrant and commission can be synonyms, commission is the term used from the 1500s to refer to the authority granted to an officer.\n\nOriginally, warrant officers in the Royal Navy included the ship’s surgeon, purser, and navigator.\n\nThe Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard all have several grades of warrant officer, usually designated as chief warrant officer followed by numerals for seniority:\n\nChief warrant officer 2\n\nChief warrant officer 3\n\nChief warrant officer 4\n\nChief warrant officer 5\n\nDefinition:\n\na commissioned officer in the navy or coast guard ranking above a lieutenant junior grade and below a lieutenant commander\n\nLieutenant is the lowest of the noncommissioned officer ranks, and the word’s origin helps explain why: the French words lieu tenant literally translates as “place holding.” So a lieutenant is a placeholder, one who takes the place or of or is deputy to a superior officer. In non-military contexts, lieutenant is a synonym of assistant or deputy.\n\nIn the U.S. military, a lieutenant in the navy is the equivalent of a captain in the army. In the army, a junior lieutenant is a second lieutenant, usually a newly commissioned young officer. A first lieutenant is the more senior rank in the army; it was formerly used in the navy to identify the second in command of a ship.\n\nsecond lieutenant\n\na commissioned officer of the lowest rank in the army, air force, or marine corps\n\nfirst lieutenant\n\na commissioned officer in the army, air force, or marine corps ranking above a second lieutenant and below a captain\n\nDefinition:\n\na commissioned officer in the army, air force, or marine corps ranking above a first lieutenant and below a major\n\nCaptain is the most ancient of military rank designations in English, in use as a general word for “military leader” since the 1400s. It came to English, like all the military ranks, from French, and the ultimate Latin root of this word is caput, meaning “head”—a captain is the “head” of a group or organization.\n\nA captain in the army is typically the commanding officer of a company; in the navy, a captain is the commanding officer of a ship. In the U.S. military, a navy captain is the equivalent rank of an army colonel.\n\nDefinition:\n\na commissioned officer in the army, air force, or marine corps ranking above a captain and below a lieutenant colonel\n\nThe military rank of major is in fact a shortened form of sergeant major, which in the 1500s and 1600s was an officer who ranked higher than a captain. The sergeant was dropped as modern distinctions between noncommissioned officers and commissioned officers became more settled.\n\nIn the U.S. military, a major in the army or marines is the equivalent rank of a lieutenant commander in the navy.\n\nDefinition:\n\na commissioned officer in the army, air force, or marine corps ranking above a major and below a colonel\n\nThe words lieutenant colonel put together mean the “assistant” or “deputy” colonel, since lieutenant has those meanings. In practice, it is a senior commissioned officer who can command a brigade or regiment. Because of the abbreviation Lt. Colonel, this rank is occasionally and informally referred to as light colonel. A lieutenant colonel is often referred to or addressed as colonel.\n\nIn the U.S. military, a lieutenant colonel in the army is the equivalent rank of a commander in the navy.\n\nDefinition:\n\na commissioned officer in the army, air force, or marine corps ranking above a lieutenant colonel and below a brigadier general\n\nThe name of the rank of colonel literally derives from being “leader of a column” of soldiers.\n\nIn the U.S. military, a colonel in the army is the equivalent rank of a captain in the navy. The reason that colonel is pronounced like kernel in English is that the French borrowed colonel from Italian and pronounced the word with an /r/ sound, spelling it coronel. The word then came into English from French. By the 1600s, the relationship to the Italian and Latin roots of column was made more clear by respelling the word with an L, but the pronunciation was already established by that time.\n\nDefinition:\n\na commissioned officer in the army, air force, or marine corps who ranks above a major general and whose insignia is three stars\n\nThe rank of lieutenant general originally referred to the officer who is second in command, the deputy or “lieutenant” to the general.\n\nThere is an interesting slippage between adjective and noun in some of these names for ranks.\n\nThey derive from French rank titles, and in French, adjectives often follow nouns rather than precede them; this is where terms like attorney general, poet laureate, and queen consort come from. But some adjectives look just like their related nouns: an attorney general is not a “general who is an attorney” but the “attorney with a broad (general) jurisdiction.” Similarly, a sergeant major is the “major” or “most important” sergeant. Originally, the lieutenant general was the “overall” or “general” lieutenant, or the second in command of all troops in a large body of soldiers."
