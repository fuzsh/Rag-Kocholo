        "text": "Special Operations Group\n\nEstablished in 1971, the United States Marshals Service (USMS) Special Operations Group (SOG) was formed as one of the first federal tactical units. Special Operations Group (SOG)is a flexible, modernized unit with a diverse skill set that conducts specialty operations in any environment and deploys to enhance the tactical capabilities of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Marshals Service both domestically and internationally. SOG's specialty operations span the range of federal law enforcement missions, such as supporting the apprehension of violent offenders, terrorist trials, high-threat prisoner movements, witness security operations, national emergencies, civil disorder, protection of at-risk health facilities and personnel, large scale seizures, actions against anti-government and militia groups, international stability and reconstruction efforts, and other missions as ordered by the U.S. Attorney General.\n\nThe Special Operations Group Tactical Center (SOGTC) is located in Pineville, LA. A full-time cadre of Special Operations Group personnel are assigned to SOGTC, as well as Springfield, VA.\n\nMission Statement\n\nOffice of Emergency Management\n\nThe Office of Emergency Management (OEM) is the primary point of contact for sensitive and classified missions involving homeland security, national emergencies, domestic crises, and the intelligence community. OEM has oversight for the following programs: the United States Marshals Service (USMS) Communications Center (COMM CTR); Emergency Operations Center (EOC); Emergency Support Function 13 (ESF-13); Canine (K9) Operations; Operational Medical Support Unit (OMSU); Incident Management Teams (IMT); and National Continuity Programs (NCP).\n\nThrough resource and information sharing, these programs work together to ensure the effective planning and security of critical governmental programs and personnel. The Office of Emergency Management utilizes a national network of personnel to manage these programs and, when needed, temporarily assigns Deputy U.S. Marshals to assist Districts' permanently-assigned Deputies in carrying out their missions.\n\nOffice of Resource Management\n\nThe Office of Resource Management (ORM) serves as the lead office within the Tactical Operations Division (TOD) for financial, human resources, procurement, and management. ORM serves as the liaison between TOD and other U.S. Marshals Service professional Divisions such as the Human Resources Division (HRD), Financial Service Division (FSD), and Management Support Division's (MSD).\n\nThe Office of Resource Management provides oversight and compliance for annual and bi-annual requirements, and coordinates training request approvals, annual training and certification requirements, IT service contracts, and some property management on behalf of Tactical Operations Division (TOD). ORM is a full-service administrative, financial, and human resources professional support office for Tactical Operations Division (TOD).\n\nStrategic National Stockpile Security Operations\n\nThe Strategic National Stockpile Security Operations (SNSSO) program is an All-Hazards unit that protects the Nation's medical countermeasures (MCM) both while in storage and in transit. Through a Memorandum of Agreement between the United States Marshals Service (USMS) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Strategic National Stockpile Security Operations ensures a nationwide framework exists for the secure delivery of critical medical countermeasures during national emergencies, natural events, or designated National Special Security Events.\n\nOffice of Crisis Services\n\nThe Office of Crisis Services (OCS) provides support to individuals affected by crisis or traumatic situations. OCS also provides resources for those employees who need assistance dealing with personal matters that can sometimes impact their lives. The Office of Crisis Services manages the Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and the Employee Resiliency Program (ERP). Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT) is comprised of volunteer employees who are specially trained as Peers and certified in Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM). The Critical Incident Response Team members are available for immediate deployment in response to traumatic incidents.\n\nThe Employee Assistance Program (EAP is a voluntary, confidential program that assists employees and family members working through various life challenges that may adversely affect job performance, health, and organizational productivity. The Employee Assistance Program provides assessment, short-term counseling, referrals, manager/supervisor consultation and coaching, as well as services to federal employees and their family members. The Employee Assistance Program services are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nThe Employee Resiliency Program (ERP)strives to increase awareness of mental health issues and suicide, instill resiliency, and expand upon resources available for United States Marshals Service (USMS) employees and their families. The Employee Resiliency Program (ERP)staff work to eliminate mental health stigmas and dispel myths surrounding asking for help, such as loss of a security clearance or the impact on promotions. Training courses provided are related to warning signs of mental crises, and preventative measures that would mitigate stress and ultimately lessen the number of suicides.\n\nThe Employee Resiliency Program also oversees the U.S. Marshals Service Work Life Program, which offers extended educational services to individual United States Marshals Service employees and family members, covering matters such as college research, elder care and childcare advice, and health and wellness consultation.\n\nOffice of Security Programs\n\nThe Office of Security Programs (OSP) is responsible for the management and coordination of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) security programs and plans. OSP manages and implements the policies and guidelines for personnel security, document security, physical security, badges and credentials, personnel identity verification, occupant emergency program, communications security, and special deputations.\n\nThe designated USMS Security Programs Managers serve as liaisons with the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department Security Officer (DSO), Security Emergency and Planning Staff (SEPS), Office of Information Safeguards and Security Oversight (OISSO), Litigation Security Group (LSG), Justice Security Operations Center (JSOC), and Personnel Security Group (PERSG).\n\nThe Personnel Security Branch (PSB) is responsible for the United States Marshals Service (USMS) Suitability and Security Program. PSB ensures that the United States Marshals Service (USMS) only employs individuals who are suitable for employment and grants national security clearances only to persons whose employment is consistent with national security interests.\n\nThe Personnel Security Branch also ensures contractors are fit to perform duties for, or on the behalf of, the United States Marshals Service. In addition, the Personnel Security Branch ensures due process is provided when a suitability action is taken or a clearance is denied, suspended, or revoked.\n\nOffice of Strategic Technology\n\nThe Office of Strategic Technology (OST) provides technical protective, wireless communications, and global readiness support to all United States Marshals Service (USMS) missions. The Technical Protective Operations (TPO) program employs state-of-the-art technology to enhance United States Marshals Service protective operations for individuals, locations, and sensitive or classified materials.\n\nTechnology employed includes tactical communications, video surveillance, GPS tracking, and other advanced technical tools. By leveraging this technology, the Office of Strategic Technology (OST) can provide protective details and operations with an additional layer of security through enhanced situational awareness.\n\nThe Global Threat Awareness Program (GTAP) is an integral component of Office of Strategic Technology, which trains and equips United States Marshals Service 1811s who conduct official government business outside of the United States. The Global Threat Awareness Program also provides guidance related to the preparation, planning, coordination, training, and recovery of United States Marshals Service personnel and their dependents that may become isolated during United States Government-sponsored activities outside of the United States.\n\nThe Tactical Operations Division Office of Strategic Technology has multiple vehicles available to support federal, state, and local law enforcement and emergency management operations worldwide. The USMS-equipped Mobile Command Vehicles (MCVs) are response vehicles that facilitate the U.S. Marshals Service ability to expand Command and Control capabilities to a remote location in national emergencies. Full interoperable communications are a standard for these U.S. Marshals Service Mobile Command Vehicles. The Mobile Command Vehicles are essentially an extension of the fixed base Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at U.S. Marshals Service Headquarters. The vehicles were built to be easily operated to allow for quick deployment with minimum personnel.\n\nBusiness Integration Center\n\nThe Business Integration Center (BIC) translates the Agency's strategic goals and objectives into planning products which then drives Tactical Operations Division (TOD) performance and achievement of measurable results. This is accomplished by applying the knowledge and mastery of business process improvement, strategic planning, and project management in order to establish, sustain, and lead a continuous improvement-oriented environment within Tactical Operations Division.\n\nThe TOD Business Integration Center process approach is to develop models, perform trend analysis, use mathematical formulations, study performance metrics, and prepare data-based presentations. The unit interfaces horizontally and vertically across the division by connecting functions performed at the agency level with the support and capability of these same functions at the division level. The Tactical Operations Division Quarterly Progress Reviews (QPRs) are also facilitated by the Business Integration Center. They division leadership each quarter on division performance, external and internal measures, and strategic projects."
