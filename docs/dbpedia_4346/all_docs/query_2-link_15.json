Jellicoe, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet:\n\nSIR,- With reference to my despatch of 24th June, 1916 after full and careful consideration of the recommendations for promotion received from Flag Officers commanding Squadrons and Officers in command of Flotillas, the following lists are submitted for the favourable consideration of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.\n\nOFFICERS RECOMMENDED FOR PROMOTION.\n\nCommanders to Captain.\n\nWalter Lingen Allen. H.M.S. \"Broke\" was very badly damaged and casualties very great, but the morale seems to have been unshaken and the ship was successfully steamed back to port.\n\nThe Hon. Arthur Lionel Ochoncar Forbes-Sempill. A very able executive officer, who had the arrangements for fire, repair and other parties extremely well organised, and who was of great help throughout the action.\n\nJoseph Charles Walrond Henley. Admiral Sir Cecil Burney reports: - Commander Henley rendered me very valuable assistance as my Flag-Commander during the action, and has done very valuable work in the gunnery training of the squadron. He is a most excellent and capable officer. He has served as my Flag-Commander and Second in Command of my Flagship during the past five years, and was of the greatest assistance to me in the occupation and administration of Scutari in 1913. He has been previously recommended for promotion by me.\n\nEdward Astley Rushton. Displayed great promptitude and powers of leadership, especially during and after the night action of 31 May, in which \"Southampton\" suffered considerably in casualties and damage. Was skilful and resourceful in effecting temporary repairs in a rising sea. Strongly recommended.\n\nBerwick Curtis. Carried out an operation on the night of 31st May-1 June with conspicuous skill, gallantry and success.\n\nGeorge William McOran Campbell. Throughout the various actions handled his division with great ability, sinking an enemy destroyer with his division. Attacked enemy battle squadron in company with flotilla, and undoubtedly assisted in blowing up one enemy battleship.\n\nArthur Goodenough Craufurd. The captain of the \"Tiger\" reports that he cannot speak too highly of the valuable and untiring work of this officer between decks under the most painful and trying conditions.\n\nThe Hon. Reginald Aylmer Ranfurley Plunkett. Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty reports: \"Was most valuable in observing the effect of our fire, thereby enabling me to take advantage of the enemy's discomfiture.\"\n\nFrancis Arthur Marten. Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty reports: \"Was of great assistance to the Commodore throughout the action. The work of the light cruisers was very much to be commended.\"\n\nLieutenant-Commanders to Commander.\n\nGuy Charles Cecil Royle. Admiral Sir Cecil Burney reports: \"It was entirely owing to his organisation and work that the ship fired so extremely well, quickly and accurately, during the action, especially so after she had been struck by a torpedo and took up a considerable list. He is a very efficient and capable officer.\"\n\nGeoffrey Charles Candy. Strongly recommended by Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram for his work in connection with the wireless telegraphy of the squadron.\n\nHenry Purdon Boyd. Recommended by Vice-Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee for valuable work.\n\nRichard Wyville Bromley. Remained exposed outside the conning tower, and, in spite of being wounded in leg, arm and neck, took his captain personal reports of the various damages suffered and got the ship in tow afterwards.\n\nPaul Whitfield (now prisoner of war in Germany). In command of \"Nomad,\" made a most gallant attack on the enemy battle-cruisers, after having assisted to drive off an enemy flotilla which was endeavouring to attack our battle-cruisers. \"Nomad\" was disabled by shell fire from the enemy battlecruisers, and subsequently sank.\n\nGerald Fortescue Longhurst. Gunnery officer of \"Lion.\" This officer controlled the fire of \"Lion\" with the greatest coolness, courage and skill, and inflicted immense damage on the enemy.\n\nCecil Burnaby Prickett. Gunnery officer of \"Princess Royal.\" Controlled the fire of \"Princess Royal\" under very difficult conditions with conspicuous success. This is the third time he has controlled the fire of a battle-cruiser in action. A most efficient and resourceful officer. Strongly recommended.\n\nLachlan Donald Ian MacKinnon. First Lieutenant and gunnery officer. By his zeal and skill obtained excellent results. Under his control the firing of the ship was accurate and rapid.\n\nCharles Gwillim Robinson. In command of \"Engadine.\" Was prompt in sending up a seaplane to scout. Handled his ship in a skilful and seamanlike manner, and towed \"Warrior\" for 75 miles, subsequently succeeding in taking off her crew, thus saving their lives.\n\nGeoffrey Corlett. Led his division into action in a most gallant manner and fought a successful action with enemy destroyers, in which they were forced to retire.\n\nJohn Cronyn Tovey. For the persistent and determined manner in which he attacked enemy ships as occasion offered, even though his destroyer was disabled by shell fire and unable to proceed at more than 10 knots.\n\nRobert Stedman MacFarlan. This officer's coolness, ability and resource, especially after he had had a miraculous escape in the torpedo control tower, was most praiseworthy, and the fact that very few communications and lighting failed is entirely due to this officer's work both before and during the action.\n\nStephen Dowell Tillard. Recommended for good service in action.\n\nErrol Manners. Executive officer of \"Comus\" and gunnery officer of the Squadron. An excellent officer, already strongly recommended for promotion, who has contributed very materially to the good gunnery work of the squadron.\n\nReginald Stannus Goff. This officer reported immediately presence of enemy. Subsequently he exhibited initiative with success, and eventually escorted \"Porpoise\" back to harbour and berthed her alongside in a most seamanlike manner.\n\nClarence Walter Eyre Trelawny. This officer, by skilful handling of his ship, managed to ram an enemy cruiser instead of being rammed by her, thereby saving his ship. He showed great coolness and afterwards successfully returned to harbour with his ship in a very damaged condition.\n\nJohn Ouchterlony Barren. This officer stood by the \"Shark\" under a very heavy fire, and although engine-room was wrecked and steering gear broken down and the ship a practical wreck, he successfully, by the aid of \"Nonsuch,\" returned into harbour.\n\nGerald Charles Wynter. Seeing \"Castor\" being engaged with two enemy ships, closed them and fired a torpedo at the second enemy ship. This was followed by an explosion. It may be taken for certain that it was \"Magic's\" torpedo that struck the second ship in the enemy's line.\n\nEric Quintin Carter. Handled his ship with skill and judgment, as is usual with this officer.\n\nEdwin Anderson Homan. This officer handled his ship with great skill throughout the action under difficult circumstances.\n\nOFFICERS RECOMMENDED TO BE NOTED FOR EARLY PROMOTION.\n\nLieutenant-Commanders.\n\nRalph Frederick Seymour (Flag Lieutenant-Commander). Sir David Beatty reports: - Carried out his duties with great coolness on the manoeuvring platform, and maintained efficient communications under the most difficult circumstances despite the fact that his signalling appliances were continually shot away.\n\nStephen St. Leger Moore. Commodore Le Mesurier reports: - This very promising officer has served as 1st and (G) of \"Calliope\" since the ship commissioned, and has been of the very greatest assistance to me in every way, while a large portion of the credit due for the gunnery efficiency of the ship is his.\n\nOFFICERS RECOMMENDED FOR PROMOTION.\n\nSub-Lieutenants to Lieutenant.\n\nCharles Saumarez Daniel. Performed very good service as officer in charge of a turret.\n\nJohn Catterall Leach. Performed very good service as officer in charge of a turret.\n\nDouglas Stanley Swanston. Controlled the 6-inch guns with marked ability, hitting the enemy destroyers, and is believed to have sunk one.\n\nHarry William Algernon Kemmis. For taking command and bringing the ship back to harbour after the commanding officer and first lieutenant had been killed.\n\nEric Vernon Lees. Rendered invaluable service in attending the wounded for five hours after a shell had struck the ship and killed two officers (one of whom was the surgeon) and five men, and wounded seven.\n\nLeicester Charles Assheton St. John Curzon-Howe. In charge of fore transmitting station and carried out his duties in a manner specially to be commended. Was mentioned in despatches after the action of the Falkland Islands.\n\nRoderick Larken Moore. Is reported by his commanding officer to have been of invaluable assistance, taking charge of the torpedo armament with excellent results.\n\nRoger Prideaux Selby. In charge of the transmitting room, the working of which was in every way admirable. Showed coolness in dangerous situations.\n\nRobert Reginald Gibbons. For good service in action. He has only recently recovered from wounds received in action of 24th January, 1915.\n\nFrancis Adrian Blaydes Haworth-Booth. Recommended for good service in action.\n\nHerbert Annesley Packer. Was in charge of \"A\" turret during the action, and is an extremely able officer.\n\nEric Sydney Brand. He was of the very greatest assistance to the gunnery officer throughout the action.\n\nOFFICERS RECOMMENDED TO BE NOTED FOR EARLY PROMOTION.\n\nSub-Lieutenants.\n\nJohn Gerald Yerburgh Loveband. Performed very good service as control officer of secondary armament.\n\nGeorge Sidney Godolphin Cavendish. Performed very good service as control officer of secondary armament.\n\nHumphrey Ranulph Brand. Strongly recommended for excellent service.\n\nNewton James Wallop William-Powlett. Very strongly recommended. This officer showed wonderful coolness under most trying circumstances, and his pluck and cheerfulness after the ship sank was certainly the means of saving the lives of several who would have otherwise given in and succumbed. Captain (D), 4th Flotilla, reports: \"I cannot speak too highly of this young officer's conduct throughout.\"\n\nHerbert Claude Millett. Strongly recommended for good service in action.\n\nGeorge Evelyn Paget How. Recommended for good service in action.\n\nCecil Spurstow Miller. In command of the 4-inch guns' crews, most of whom were killed or wounded. Sub-Lieutenant Miller, himself very badly injured and burnt by shell-fire, stuck to his work, reorganised what was left, and set a fine example.\n\nMates.\n\nAlfred Bowman. Second officer of \"Y\" turret. Highly commended by his officer of the turret for good work during the action.\n\nMatthew McClure. In charge of forecastle group of 4-inch guns. Wounded by a shell splinter, but continued to carry on.\n\n_____\n\nOFFICERS RECOMMENDED FOR PROMOTION.\n\nEngineer Lieutenant-Commander to Engineer Commander.\n\nArthur Lee Picton. Recommended for good service in action.\n\nEngineer Lieutenant to Engineer Lieutenant-Commander.\n\nGeoffrey Morgan. Captain Molteno, late of \"Warrior,\" reports : - ''Utmost gallantry and conspicuous devotion to duty in remaining in the engine rooms after the explosion and endeavouring to take action for the safety of the ship, by which delay he was imprisoned under the grating for over two hours, and very narrowly escaped losing his life by drowning, scalding and suffocation. Was almost overcome when rescued. He afterwards took part with energy and coolness in the work of salving the ship. This officer, under the able supervision of Engineer Commander Kitching, has run the engine-room department extremely well, and greatly increased 'Warrior's' steaming efficiency.\"\n\nOFFICERS RECOMMENDED TO BE NOTED FOR EARLY PROMOTION.\n\nEngineer Commanders.\n\nWilliam Toop. Rendered most valuable services after the ship was struck by a torpedo, and his excellent work in keeping the water under in the flooded compartments was largely instrumental in the saving of the ship. He is a most capable engineer officer.\n\nHerbert Brooks Moorshead. His zeal and ability and care of the main and auxiliary engines and boilers throughout the war, and coolness in action, contributed largely to the efficient working of the engineroom department in the action on 31st May.\n\nJohn Downie Wilson. For the great efficiency of the engine-room department and the example he set to his officers and men during a period of considerable stress, steaming at between 18 and 20 knots for four consecutive days.\n\nCharles Frederick Dunn. Senior Engineer Commander in the 5th Battle Squadron. The Captain of \"Warspite\" reports:- \"I consider that this officer is worthy of reward, as the efficiency of his department has proved to be excellent, and no further remarks are necessary beyond the fact that I was able to obtain full speed whenever I deemed it safe, considering the damage the ship had sustained from shell fire.\"\n\nJohn Benjamin Hewitt. Recommended for service in action.\n\nEngineer Lieutenant-Commanders.\n\nBertram Harvey. The Senior Engineer Lieutenant-Commander in the 2nd Battle Squadron.
