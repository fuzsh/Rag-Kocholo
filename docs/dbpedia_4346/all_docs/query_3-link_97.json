Hence, the government decided to adjust the salary structure to act as a morale booster in the armed forces and increase loyalty.\n\nWith the current Nigerian Air Force salary structure, the airmen now earns befitting take-home pay however, it is not as lucrative as the commissioned officers who are university or NDA graduates.\n\nOutlined below is the Nigerian Air Force salary scale in ascending order;"
