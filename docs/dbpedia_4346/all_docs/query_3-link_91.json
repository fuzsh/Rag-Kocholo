        "text": "Though the RCAF chooses to recognize April 1, 1924 as its formation date, the history of the Canadian Air Force (CAF) extends back further to the establishment of a Canadian wing in Europe which “became operational nine days after the First World War had ended.”\n\nDemilitarization post-First World War was the first challenge of a burgeoning air force. At the time, “middle-ranking civil servants in Ottawa” took up the challenge of “converting the expansive potential of aviation, so clearly demonstrated in war, to constructive peacetime uses.”\n\n“[T]he government delegated responsibility for aviation to an autonomous Air Board in the summer of 1919.” This Air Board was primarily concerned with conserving the aviation experiences of the First World War through the promotion of civil flying. The military arm of the Air Board, the Canadian Air Force, was established along militia lines. Colonel Oliver Mowat Biggar, “one those few middle-ranking personnel in Ottawa,” proposed the formation of the Canadian Air Force “as a non-permanent service” in November 1919 to work alongside the civil aviation division under the control of the Air Board.\n\nThe government accepted the argument for the creation of the Canadian Air Force in February 1920, and Sir Willoughby Gwatkin became the first inspector general of the Canadian Air Force in April 1920 with Air Commodore A. K. Tylee appointed as air officer commanding. The decision to have this militia arm within the Air Board was not universally accepted and, indeed, almost did not happen.\n\nThe question of whether Canada would even have an air force was best summed up by then leader of the opposition, William Lyon Mackenzie King, when he asked in the House, “Where does the Minister expect invasion from? … defence against whom[?]”\n\nThe concept of an Air Board was not novel. The United Kingdom had established an Air Board in 1916 and replaced it with an Air Council in 1917. However, unlike Canada’s Air Board, the developments of command and control of air power in the United Kingdom were centred on the military aspects only.\n\nThe initial Canadian Air Force headquarters opened May 17, 1920 at 529 Sussex Street in Ottawa and consisted of six personnel: Wing Commander R. F. Redpath, Flight Lieutenant G. J. Blackmore, Warrant Officer H. H. Atkinson, Flight Sergeant F. Aldridge and Sergeant A. H. McKay. With such a small headquarters, initial Canadian Air Force regulations were adapted from those of the Royal Air Force (RAF). The Canadian Air Force chain of command for the first air officer commanding was a relatively direct line through the inspector general to the Air Board.\n\nWhile the initial cadre of Canadian Air Force officers and enlisted men were considered “in continuous service but on inactive, unpaid leave except when on refresher training,” their ranks were transferrable from their former Royal Air Force (RAF) or army ranks held during the First World War, once they completed their first training period. Hence, both RAF and traditional army ranks were acceptable and used interchangeably at the discretion of the holder.\n\nIn the earliest days, the choice to use army or RAF ranks seemed to be along civil versus military flying duties. Quite often, members employed the army ranks when flying in support of the civil branch of the Air Board. The same individual would then utilize the air-force rank when flying within the military branch. The rank structure laid down for the Canadian Air Force included: air vice-marshal, air commodore, group captain, wing commander, squadron leader, flight lieutenant, flying officer, pilot officer, warrant officer, flight sergeant, sergeant, corporal, air mechanic (1st class) and air mechanic (2nd class).\n\nAs mentioned, the Air Board was comprised of two flying divisions—the civil and the Canadian Air Force—and would remain a dual system until 1922. It was not until the elimination of the dual system that the concurrent usage of army and air-force ranks within the Air Board was resolved. This was eloquently demonstrated in Camp Borden’s routine orders of 28 November 1922, wherein it stated: “The use of Military Equivalent of Canadian Air Force ranks will be discontinued throughout the Service forthwith and only the ranks hereunder quoted (i.e., group captain to pilot officer) will be used both in correspondence and conversation.”\n\nOn January 1, 1923, the former Air Board (predominantly civilian in nature prior to this point) was consolidated within the Canadian Air Force under the newly formed Department of National Defence, under the control of the chief of the general staff. Although discussion of seeking the “Royal” designation had preceded the amalgamation of January 1, 1923, application for said designation was not made to the Secretary of State for External Affairs until January 5, 1923. Formal reply from the Secretary of State for the Colonies in England was received on February 15, 1923. Weekly Order No. 21/23 on March 12, 1923, promulgated the new title “Royal Canadian Air Force”. Although the promulgation of “Royal” within the title was conferred in 1923, it was not formally adopted until 1 April 1924.\n\nPrior to the official designation of the Royal Canadian Air Force, uniforms were loosely styled on the army dress, with army-style rank badges (pips and crowns). Afterwards, it was decided to adopt the dress and motto of the RAF, and the uniform was patterned on the RAF uniform of the day. These changes would remain extant until unification on February 1, 1968.\n\nAs an aside, the translation of Royal Canadian Air Force to French was not resolved until June 1940, thereafter referred to as Corps d’aviation royal canadien, abbreviated as CARC.\n\nThe date April 1, 1924, which we now celebrate as the “official” birthdate of the RCAF, was significant in that the new King’s Regulations and Orders (KR&O) for the RCAF were now completed after two years of staff work and came into effect on this date. It also marked the commencement of the new fiscal year, after which the new pay and allowances could be administered. It also marked the date after which the use of the “Royal” designation was now approved by KR&O. As demonstrated, however, the true date for the birth of Canada’s Air Force could have been much earlier.\n\nWith the adoption of the KR&O for the RCAF, largely based on the Royal Air Force and the United Kingdom Force Act, the enlisted ranks were adjusted to the following: warrant officer 1st class (WO1), warrant officer 2nd class (WO2), flight sergeant (FS), corporal (Cpl), leading aircraftman (LAC), aircraftman 1st class (AC1) and aircraftman 2nd class (AC2). No significant changes were made to officer ranks with the exception of adding air marshal and air chief marshal.\n\nThe Royal Air Force had arrived at this rank structure as a means of severing the Air Force from the other services. The intent was “to preserve and emphasise the principle of the independence and integrity of the Royal Air Force as a separate service among fighting services to the Crown” while recognizing the requirement for the Air Force to serve the special needs of the both the Army and the Navy “in addition [to having] a strategic and tactical sphere of action independent of the other two fighting services.”\n\nJust as Canada’s burgeoning Air Force was seeking its independence, so too, the Royal Air Force was seeking to establish itself as a credible and independent force separate from the Army and the Royal Navy. Canada automatically adopted the Royal Air Force ranks for use in the RCAF when it based the RCAF KR&O upon the Royal Air Force KR&O and the United Kingdom Force Act.\n\nThese ranks would remain in effect in the RCAF until unification many years later in 1968. During the Second World War, gender-specific language would be included in the rank titles, such as aircraftman/aircraftwoman, to address the inclusion of women in uniform. Concurrent with the maturing of the RCAF, questions were already beginning to arise about dedicated air support to the Navy.\n\nEven before unification in 1968, the use of the RAF rank structure within the RCAF was not without some controversy. In a memorandum to the RCAF Senior Advisory Group in February 1965, the author (Deputy Chief of Personnel) suggests that the titles, “in many instances, originated with the Royal Naval Air Service and later were adopted by the Royal Flying Corps, which in turn became the RAF in 1918.” Principal among the arguments was that the ranks in use by the RCAF were no longer indicative of the officer’s function as it was 40 years previously when the ranks were created. Other arguments included the lack of one-word ranks, thus leading to confusion among the public.\n\nRCAF ranks also did not easily translate into French whereas the Canadian Army ranks did. Lastly, in 1965 it was considered advantageous to adopt the Canadian Army rank structure as it was similar to the rank structures used by the other members of the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with whom the RCAF could be expected work alongside on operations. The recommendation of this report was to retain the rank insignia but adopt the Canadian Army rank titles as this result would be “the best of both choices.”\n\nPrior to unification in 1968, the Canadian Army and the RCN had developed aviation and air arms of their own, which did not belong to the RCAF. Based on this, questions arise today among the tactical aviation and maritime aviation communities as to whether it would even be appropriate to return to RCAF ranks. The question is a little more complicated in that those aviation arms, as will be demonstrated, had closer links to the RCAF than many of today’s aviators realize."
