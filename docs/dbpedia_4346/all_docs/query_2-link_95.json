        "text": "This framework underlies my approach to clinical and forensic work with DID and was the foundation of my assessment of Ms. Neely. The following discussion describes conceptualization and techniques supported by outcome studies of DID treatment, as well as expert consensus (Brand et al., 2011; Brand et al., 2013; Brand, Webermann, Snyder, & Kaliush, 2019). This structure provides a rigorous way to approach forensic assessment of DID and to address many of the conundrums that have vexed the legal system grappling with forensic issues regarding the disorder (Allison, 1984; Armstrong, 2001; Behnke, 1997a, 1997b; Kluft, 1987c; Orne, Dinges, & Orne, 1984; Sinnott-Armstrong & Behneke, 2001; Watkins, 1984). In this work, I use the term “self state” instead of the DSM-5 “personality state or identity state.” I view “self state” as more phenomenologically accurate than other terms for the personified states in DID. I avoid terminology commonly used in the literature such as “alter,” “part,” “dissociative part of the personality,” etc. that can result in reifying the self states (see Loewenstein, Frewen, & Lewis-Fernández, 2017, for fuller discussion of terminology for DID states).\n\nDID is a paradox. It is understood to be both a severe mental illness and a developmental adaptation that preserves important types of resilience through psychobiological sequestration of overwhelming traumatic experiences.\n\nDID: a Posttraumatic Developmental Disorder\n\nDID is best conceptualized as a childhood-onset posttraumatic developmental disorder. In the developmental model of DID, the disorder is not viewed as the “shattering” or “fragmentation” of a “core personality.” Instead, based on Putnam’s Discrete Behavioral State (DBS) model (Putnam, 2016; Trickett, Noll, & Putnam, 2011), Kluft’s Four-Factor Theory (Kluft, 1985b), and the Trauma-Related Altered State of Consciousness (TRASC) model of Lanius and Frewen (2015), DID is viewed as an alternative developmental pathway where the traumatized child fails to develop a consistent sense of self across behavioral/emotional states and contexts. DID has been diagnosed in young children, adolescents, adults, and geriatric individuals (Armstrong, Putnam, Carlson, Libero, & Smith, 1997; Kluft, 1985a, 1985b, 2007b; Putnam, Hornstein, & Peterson, 1996; Putnam, 1997).\n\nThe Discrete Behavioral State (DBS) model of DID is based on observational studies demonstrating discrete behavioral states in the patterning and organization of normal early childhood behavior and affect regulation (Putnam, 1997, 2016). In the dissociative child, discrete behavioral states do not become integrated and coordinated during development, as normally occurs. Instead, unbearable memories and affects are psychobiologically sequestered through processes such state-dependent learning. Repeated traumatic experiences, combined with disturbed caretaker-child attachment and parenting, disrupt the normal metacognitive processes involved in developing a subjectively unified self. These critical processes, prominent between the ages of 1 and 6, establish the child’s capacity to integrate different experiences of self that normally occur across different contexts and emotional states (Putnam, 1997, 2016). The dissociative child usually receives unreliable or no comforting or restorative interactions from caretakers to counterbalance repeated extreme states, further inhibiting normal development of a unified sense of self, as well as profoundly impairing the capacity for emotional regulation (Kluft, 1985b; Silberg, 2004, 2013). The child has to find ways to manage overwhelming experiences, often by entering a shutdown state (Schalinski & Teicher, 2015). As development proceeds through childhood and adolescence, the result is an individual with relatively independent senses of self, often in conflict with one another. Myriad factors determine the subsequent shaping of the subjective and presentational aspects of the DID self states (see below).\n\nTrauma\n\nDID patients have the highest rates of childhood trauma, particularly combined sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, of any clinical population studied (Hornstein & Putnam, 1992; Lewis & Yeager, 1996; Loewenstein et al., 2017; Putnam et al., 1996; Spiegel et al., 2011). Rigorous retrospective studies, as well as studies of maltreated children, have documented the childhood traumas experienced by DID individuals, including specific physical injuries sustained in childhood, and traumas for which the individual denied any recall (Armstrong, 2001; Feldman, Mallouh, & Lewis, 1986; Hornstein & Putnam, 1992; Kluft, 1997; Lewis & Yeager, 1996; Lewis, Yeager, Swica, Pincus, & Lewis, 1997; Putnam et al., 1996). Also, like others afflicted with childhood sexual abuse, various forms of revictimization—intimate partner violence, adult sexual assault, trafficking—are common in this population (Cooper, Kennedy, & Yuille, 2001; Middleton, 2013; Salter, 2017; Snyder, 2018; Webermann, Brand, & Kumar, 2017).\n\nThe types of trauma described in the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study (Felitti & Anda, 2010) are common in the histories of individuals diagnosed with DID. Many come to treatment manifesting a number of the negative outcomes associated in the study with increasing numbers of ACEs. These include PTSD; depression; high rates of suicidal acts and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI); addictions including drugs, alcohol, and gambling; morbid obesity; intimate partner violence; hearing voices; childhood autobiographical memory disturbances; multiple psychiatric co-morbidities; and medical illnesses such as STDs, chronic pain, and heart, lung, liver, gastrointestinal, and auto-immune diseases (Brand, Sar, et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2007; Classen, Palesh, & Aggarwal, 2005; Dell, 2013; Foote, Smolin, Neft, & Lipschitz, 2008; Imperatore et al., 2017; LeBouthillier, McMillan, Thibodeau, & Asmundson, 2015; Myrick, Brand, & Putnam, 2013; Park et al., 2016;; Pilton, Varese, Berry, & Bucci, 2015; Putnam, Harris, & Putnam, 2013; Spiegel et al., 2011; Webermann, Myrick, Taylor, Chasson, & Brand, 2016, Webermann et al., 2017).\n\nResilience\n\nPsychological assessment studies of adult DID patients illustrate the protective and resilience-generating effects of early life dissociation, as well as severe dissociative and posttraumatic interference in testing. Severely dissociative individuals frequently show idiosyncratic posttraumatic activation to testing, such as going into a flashback while reacting to a Rorschach ink blot or performing poorly on a WAIS subtest due to a unique posttraumatic reminder. For the Rorschach, this required developing a specific variable, the trauma content score (TC); DID individuals showed a mean TC score of at least 50% (Armstrong, 1991; Brand, Armstrong, Loewenstein, & McNary, 2009). Testing also showed dissociative defenses against posttraumatic intrusions. Subjects would start to have posttraumatic reactivity during their responses and then rapidly became hyperfocused on small areas of the Rorschach blot, seemingly in a dissociative trance state, and provided complex, emotionally detached descriptions (Armstrong, 1994). When not posttraumatically overwhelmed, DID subjects demonstrated good reality testing, an ability to take distance from cognitive distortions, a capacity for attachment, a sense of humor, creativity, excellent self-observing capacity, and hope (Brand, Armstrong, & Loewenstein, 2006; Brand, Armstrong, et al., 2009). DID individuals demonstrate marked psychological and cognitive complexity, distinguishing them from psychotic, borderline personality disorder (BPD), and combat PTSD subjects (Armstrong, 1991; Brand, Armstrong, et al., 2006; Brand, Armstrong, et al., 2009).\n\nIndividuals with DID show a broad range of functional capacity. On one end of the spectrum, DID has been shown to meet criteria for a serious mental illness, with high rates of disability (Johnson, Cohen, Kasen, & Brook, 2006; Mueller-Pfeiffer et al., 2012; Spiegel et al., 2011). Co-morbidities like PTSD and depression affect close to 100% of DID individuals, along with high rates of substance abuse, somatic symptom disorders, and BPD features. Individuals with DID have substantial rates of suicidal, self-destructive, and high-risk behaviors, often requiring treatment at increasingly restrictive levels of care (Spiegel et al., 2011). However, as in bipolar disorder, the expert consensus is that there is a broad range of functioning in DID, with some individuals highly achieving in professional, and even personal, life and rapidly responding to outpatient treatment alone (International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011; Kluft, 1986, 1990a, c, 1994b).\n\nIn order to diagnose, evaluate, and treat DID, one most hold both levels of this dialectic in mind: this is a human being with a profound mental illness and with significant resilience and adaptive resources. One should not romanticize the resilience and overlook the pathology, nor only attend to the pathology and blind oneself to the strengths found in many DID individuals.\n\nMaking Sense of Self States\n\nThe DID individual is not a collection of separate, static “people” acting independently. DID self states can be represented in different ways over time depending on many developmental and psychological influences (Kluft, 1985b, 1991, 2005, 2006, 2007a; Putnam, 1997, 2016). Outward presentation to others, if any, may vary as well. Many DID self states are only experienced intrapsychically (Kluft, 1991). Fundamentally, DID self states can be conceptualized as relatively separate senses of self (often including a body image), organized around a prevailing affect, a set of state-dependent autobiographical memories, and a limited behavioral repertoire (Kluft, 1988; Putnam, 1988). Following Kluft (1988): “[A DID self state] functions both as a recipient, processor, and storage center for perceptions, experiences, and the processing of such in connection with past events and thoughts, and/or present and anticipated ones as well. It has a sense of its own identity and ideation, and a capacity for initiating thought processes and actions … which may be behaviorally enacted with noteworthy role-taking and role-playing dimensions and sensitive to intrapsychic, interpersonal, and environmental stimuli…” (page 51). DID self states may be experienced with “delusional separateness”—with some self states insisting “they” do not inhabit the same body nor will they be affected by what happens to it (even death)—and/or “delusional disorientation to current circumstances”—with some states maintaining “they” do not exist in the same time and place as the actual human being.\n\nTo understand DID, one must recognize that the mind of the DID individual is subjectively structured as a complex, dynamic, adaptive self-state system that, beginning in early childhood, evolves developmentally. Putnam (1997, 2016) conceptualizes the core phenomenology of DID as the state of multiple states, which can subjectively reconfigure in varying ways over time. Armstrong (2001) uses the simile of understanding light as both particles and waves. She conceptualizes DID both at the level of specific self states and simultaneously at the level of the dynamic self-state system. There is a third level of conceptualization: that of the “whole human being” across all states and the self-state system. For example, in the pharmacological treatment of DID, medications are unlikely to be effective unless the symptoms of a co-morbid disorder, e.g., a mood disorder, are experienced across the whole mind, not just in specific self states (International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011; Loewenstein, 1991b, 2005). In assessing behaviors in the DID individual, one must consider that a number of different self states, in coordination and/or in conflict, account for them, not a revolving door of independently acting “people.” In this regard, it is critical to focus on DID as a self-state system, not an assemblage of relatively independent, recurring entities with stable characteristics.\n\nThe personality of the DID individual is made up of all the DID self states as well as all the non-trauma/dissociation factors that affect development of the human personality (International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011). Individual self states cannot have “separate” personality disorders, as was suggested by one of the forensic examiners in this case. The latter should be diagnosed as co-morbid with DID only if the personality disorder symptoms occur across the whole mind—an assessment of which may require longitudinal observation (International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011). Usually, as with bipolar disorder, the DID individual needs to be stabilized from dyscontrolled dissociative and PTSD symptoms before a personality disorder can be diagnosed.\n\nSeveral studies of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in DID individuals have found that meeting DSM-5 BPD criteria is an indicator of decompensation in DID, with severely dyscontrolled dissociative and PTSD symptoms (Ross, Ferrell, & Schroeder, 2014; Sar, Alioglu, & Akyuz, 2014). Frequently, once the DID individual is symptomatically stabilized, many of the BPD symptoms remit (Armstrong, 1991; Boon & Draijer, 1993; Laddis, Dell, & Korzekwa, 2017; Ross et al., 2014; Sar, Alioglu, & Akyuz, 2017). Many putative BPD individuals, when studied with symptom screening and diagnostic measures for dissociation and DD, will be diagnosed instead with DID, with the BPD symptoms manifestations of the severity of the DD and PTSD symptoms (Sar, Alioglu, & Akyuz, 2017; Sar, Sar, Alioglu, Akyuz, Tayakisi et al., 2017). Many DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for BPD overlap with, and may be confused with, the phenomenology of DID. These include identity disturbance; high-risk, self-destructive behavior and suicidal behavior; “affective instability” which can be mistakenly applied to rapid DID state shifts; and of course, dissociative symptoms. Self-destructive and suicidal behavior are better accounted for as outcomes of ACEs and dissociation rather than personality disorders (Dube et al., 2001; Felitti & Anda, 2010; Ford & Gomez, 2015; Webermann et al., 2016; Weierich & Nock, 2008). In one study, in a logistic regression comparing DD, PTSD, BPD, and substance abuse, where trauma was controlled, a DD diagnosis remained as the only significant predictor of multiple suicide attempts (Foote et al., 2008).\n\nMany DID individuals do not have a pattern of intense, unstable relationships. As in this case history of Ms. Neely, who had been married for almost 30 years, many DID individuals have stable, long-term relationships, albeit many are abusive or highly dysfunctional (Snyder, 2018; Webermann et al., 2017). Many DID individuals are profoundly avoidant of relationships because of their long histories of interpersonal betrayal, abuse, and exploitation. DID individuals frequently do not display the classical “idealization/devaluation” transference. Their transferences are primarily traumatic, with the expectation of exploitation or blindness to exploitation by the therapist, among other posttraumatic relational themes (Kluft, 1994a; Loewenstein, 1993). Also, DID individuals commonly have transference/countertransference themes of belief/disbelief regarding their own symptoms and trauma histories and evoke similar polarization in treatment providers, inpatient psychiatric hospital staff, and the culture at large (Kluft, 1994a; Loewenstein, 1993, 2007; Loewenstein & Wait, 2008).\n\nFactor analytic studies generally have found that DID symptoms are subtle and covert (Kluft, 1991; Spiegel et al., 2011). They are characterized by shifting, overlapping, and interfering states, accompanied by inner voices and much less often by overt switching behaviors (Dell, 2006a). The latter may be associated with more disruption and problems with functioning. In many cases, several states are experienced as simultaneously, adaptively cooperating to manage various life issues and may be experienced as an ongoing co-presence and co-awareness. However, the shifting and overlapping/interference among states also can give rise to highly discomfiting passive influence (Schneiderian first rank—FRS) symptoms including inner voices conferring about the person; “made” emotions, impulses, and actions; thought withdrawal; and unbidden somatic symptoms. (Kluft, 1987a; Laddis & Dell, 2012; Putnam, 2016; Ross & Joshi, 1992; Ross et al., 1990). These symptoms frequently give rise to misdiagnosis of DID individuals as psychotic.\n\nThe phenomenology of FRS in psychosis is different from that in DID (Loewenstein, 1991a). Unless there is an intercurrent psychotic process, the DID individual rarely has delusional explanations for FRS, nor report the FRS of thought broadcasting, audible thoughts, and delusional perception (Kluft, 1987a; Laddis & Dell, 2012; Nordgaard, Arnfred, Handest, & Parnas, 2008; Ross & Joshi, 1992). Also, a number of studies link childhood trauma, dissociation, and/or high hypnotizability to the experience of voice hearing and multi-modal hallucinosis (Berry, Varese, & Bucci, 2017; Longden, Madill, & Waterman, 2012; Longden, House, & Waterman, 2016; Naish, 2013; Pilton et al., 2015; Whitfield, Dube, Felitti, & Anda, 2005). Thus, in both clinical and forensic assessments, tracking the phenomenology of FRS and hallucinations can help differentiate DID from psychosis, an important issue in the forensic assessment of CTS and NGRI/NCR.\n\nKluft (2005) has described the “dissociative surface” as self states that are structured to handle everyday life and to interact with “outside” people, among other functions. He cautions that attending only to the dissociative surface impedes adequate evaluation and understanding of the behavior of DID individuals, many of whom experience behavioral control as emanating from states that remain covert or as a kind of summation of self state “vectors” (Laddis & Dell, 2012). In many cases, the surface self states profess confusion, puzzlement, fear, and shame about experiencing unbidden—often highly ego-dystonic—thoughts, emotions, urges, body sensations, and behaviors. Typically, surface self states describe varying degrees of dissociative amnesia for important experiences, motivations, and behavior, further compromising coherent, cogent understanding. For example, attending only to the dissociative surface compromises the clinician’s ability to assess the risk of dangerousness to self or others, since the clinician is most likely not directly interacting with self states controlling these behaviors.\n\nEven in seemingly inexplicable behavior by DID individuals, veteran clinicians can find a “method in the madness,” a trauma-dissociation-based, psychologically “logical” way of understanding exactly why, how, and when specific—usually problematic—behaviors occur. Behavior that may seem random and incomprehensible actually has very specific determinants in the inner world of the DID self state system. To better understand DID individuals at the system level, the interviewer should inquire about and track the “passive-influence” experiences that result in lack of control of, or struggle about, thoughts, speech, impulses, or behavior. This also can be tracked by attending to DID “inner voices” that comment, censor, berate, and/or support the self states at the dissociative surface. In some cases, the DID individual will deny “hearing voices” but will acknowledge experiencing uncontrollable, seemingly independent trains of thought expressing ideas quite different from what the surface believes, or in conflict with one another. One patient described this as “free-lance thoughts” (Loewenstein, 1991a).\n\nOne may attempt to evaluate, at a given point in time, the totality of the subjective experiences of individual self states, the dynamics of the self-state system, and the level of broad psychological patterns unique to the individual. Comments directed to “all” self states, “the whole mind,” etc. are meant to be implicitly integrative and to assert that the DID individual, notwithstanding a subjective experience of self-division, is a single human being, with only one brain, one mind. In clinical practice, one can accomplish this effectively using a technique called “talking over” to direct queries and comments to non-surface self states, the system of selves, or the “whole mind.” Sometimes, it may seem as if the interviewer is doing group or family therapy for a single individual (Loewenstein & Ross, 1992).\n\nElaboration of Secondary Characteristics in DID\n\nOver developmental time, a variety of posttraumatic, social, cultural, and relational experiences may lead to secondary elaboration of the self states’ characteristics and ways of presenting themselves to others. However, these elaborations are not central to the conceptualization of DID and can be understood in terms of socio-cultural shaping of DID, including trauma-based psychodynamic factors, postulated by Kluft as central to understanding DID (Kluft, 2006, 2007a). The symptoms and clinical presentation of all psychiatric disorders are shaped by socio-cultural factors (Lewis-Fernandez, Guarnaccia, & Ruiz, 2009; Ryder et al., 2008). For example, nineteenth century schizophrenic individuals did not have delusions of being controlled by weather satellites.\n\nThis conceptualization helps make sense of the inclusion of a pathological possession form of DID in DSM-5. In cultures where possession is an accepted experience, for individuals with the pathological possession form of DID, the self states take the form of “possessing entities” that are not congruent with cultural norms (Dorahy et al., 2014; Loewenstein et al., 2017; Spiegel et al., 2011). Individuals with the pathological possession form of DID may have higher rates of childhood and/or adult trauma, compared with others in their culture (Cardena, Van Duijil, Weiner, & Terhune, 2009; Schaffler, Cardena, Reijman, & Haluza, 2015; Van Duijl et al., 2010).\n\nIn other cultures, the experience of possession in DID is a part of the presentation of non-possession-form DID (Bowman, 1993; Ross, Schroeder, & Ness, 2013; Sar, Alioglu, Akyuz, & Karabulut, 2014). Some clinicians even believe there is a differential diagnosis between DID and literal possession (Allison & Schwartz, 1999). Exorcism rites have been performed on DID individuals, usually accompanied by marked clinical deterioration and phobia of subsequent treatment, as well as spiritual damage (Bowman, 1993). Finally, a sub-group of DID individuals experience some self states as so ego-alien that they describe feeling possessed (Spiegel et al., 2011).\n\nDID experts view the external manifestations of separateness of self states including names, stated gender, voice tone, accent, clothing, hairstyle, varying access to skills and knowledge, type of dissociative amnesia, habits (smoker, non-smoker), etc. as secondary and non-essential to the diagnosis and treatment of DID (Loewenstein, 2018), except to the extent that these secondary characteristics are of psychodynamic importance (Loewenstein, 2018; Loewenstein et al., 2017; Kluft, 2006, 2007a). From a psychodynamic perspective, the separateness and distinctness of self states can be viewed as epiphenomena of structured dissociative defenses (Armstrong, 1994, 2001; Kluft, 1988, 1991). These can even vary considerably over the life span, depending in part on stresses the individual may face (Kluft, 1985b; Maaranen et al., 2008). The consensus among DID experts is that less than 5% of DID individuals exhibit the starkly different presentations and behaviors among self states that are the popular stereotype for DID (International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011). A minority of DID individuals display subtler yet consequential presentational differences among states, similar to what Wilbur reported in the book Sybil (Schreiber, 1976) (but more exaggerated in the television and movie versions). Consistent with better overall adaptation and functioning, most individuals with DID do not create or display major disparities in manifest presentation between self states, even when states shift, switch, or are experienced through overlap/interference phenomena (Kluft, 2006; Loewenstein, 2018).\n\nThe DBS conceptualization helps account for multifarious, often seemingly incomprehensible, illogical, even bizarre or “psychotic” self state representations, e.g., child, adult, adolescent, elderly, ageless, traumatized, not traumatized, as well as animal, demonic, deity, fantasy character, body part (“the arm said”), chimerical beast, planets, stars, emotions, nameless, ageless, ad infinitum. Similarly, it helps make sense of apparently “impossibly” large numbers of self states. The DID mind is not a “shattered mirror” with a finite number of pieces; it can represent itself in infinite ways. Kluft (1985b) cites a large number of factors that affect secondary structuring of the self states. Most importantly, these include developmental-trauma-based factors, e.g., a young sexually abused girl develops a “boy” self state, with the futilely self-protective idea that, “if I were a boy, this wouldn’t be happening to me” (Kluft, 2006).\n\nKluft (2006, 2007a) describes the trauma-based psychodynamic factors that, as in the example above, are the most salient ways of understanding self states psychotherapeutically. Other factors include each parent literally treating the person as if he/she was the opposite gender, calling the person by different names, and dressing the person in different gendered clothing. Self states may have relationally trauma-based functions: states that relate only to an abusive parent during incest and others that relate to the parent in everyday contexts (Kluft, 1991). Self states may be subjectively structured to manage a variety of real-world functions: school, work, relationships, parenthood, etc. Other factors can include normal developmental processes like imaginary companionship and childhood fantasy play; personified identification/introjection of people in the child’s life; highly variable cultural factors like books, movies, the internet; religious and spiritual experiences; and poorly conducted psychotherapy (Fine, 1989; Kluft, 1985a, 1985b, 1989a; Silberg, 2013).\n\nAlso, studies of children with DID show that, in general, they have fewer, simpler and less—subjectively or presentationally—elaborated self states (Silberg, 2013; Silberg & Dallam, 2009). These are primarily experienced intrapsychically, as autonomous imaginary companions that affect the individual by voices and passive influence, and less by state shifting (Kluft, 1991; Putnam et al., 1996; Putnam, 1997; Trujillo, Lewis, Yeager, & Gidlow, 1996). With the onset of adolescence, in many cases, the self states seem to “separate and individuate,” with progression to the adult form of DID (Putnam et al., 1996).\n\nThe DBS model assists with another reification problem: the developmentally improbable notion that there is a “real” person, and his/her “alters” that have “split off” from a “core” person or personality. This conceptualization is problematic even if the DID individual reports experiencing him/herself in this way. For example, inexperienced or naïve clinicians often accept this inherently reified literalism, as if the nominal self state was a head of household with visitors: the “host” self state. The latter is a term of art that designates these types of states and has little evidence base (Loewenstein, Hamilton, Alagna, Reid, & deVries, 1987). The term “host” connotes that there is a real person and that all other entities are secondary (see Yalom (1989) for an example of this error). An additional term of art, the “typical host” refers to the classic characteristics of this type of state: confused, overwhelmed, depressed, somatizing, rigidly and ineffectually controlling, beset with dissociative amnesia, and wanting to “get rid of” all the other self states, with the latter viewing the “host” as either shamefully contemptible or pitiable, but needing support (Kluft, 2006; Putnam, 1989).\n\nSome DID individuals come to view their overarching identity as contingent upon having the disorder and being a trauma survivor. This is commonly associated with significant narcissistic investment in “being” DID and in displaying complex secondary elaboration of the separateness of the self states (Chase, 1987; Kluft, 1988, 1991). DID experts view this as predictive of much poorer treatment outcomes (Brand, Loewenstein, & Lanius, 2014; International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011; Kluft, 1994b). The overt presentational differences among self states in some DID individuals can be so compelling as to make it difficult, even for experienced assessors, to hold onto the understanding that the individual is a single human being with a single over-all mind and a single personality. Unfortunately, it is these DID individuals who usually appear in the media and who actually are unwittingly being exploited and victimized by the circus-like, freak-show atmosphere of popular media portrayals of DID (International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011). On the other hand, clinical and epidemiological data suggest that the majority of individuals with DID do not, or only subtly manifest, overt DID symptoms except at times of stress and life crisis (Kluft, 1991; Maaranen et al., 2008).\n\nMost clinicians and forensic practitioners, as well as the public, receive training in DID from the media (Loewenstein, 2018). For many practitioners, the “searching image” for DID is based on these fictional, non-fictional, and popular autobiographical portrayals. Compounding the problem, there is a dearth of training altogether in most mental health fields concerning trauma-related disorders, especially complex posttraumatic and dissociative disorders that are associated with earlier and cumulative trauma (Brand et al., 2018; Brand, Schielke, et al., 2019; Loewenstein, 2018; Stein et al., 2013; Wilgus, Packer, Lile-King, Miller-Perrin, & Brand, 2015). This is particularly unfortunate since epidemiological studies show that traumatic experiences are ubiquitous in the general population, with a 6.8% lifetime prevalence for PTSD, making it more common than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (Green et al., 2010; Kessler, 2000; Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1995; Kessler et al., 2005; McLaughlin et al., 2010). Across international general population studies, the lifetime prevalence of all DD is conservatively estimated as about 10%, with a 1–3.5% lifetime prevalence of DID (Loewenstein, 2018). DID patients spend on average 5–12.5 years in mental health treatment before correct diagnosis (Spiegel et al., 2011). Skeptics wonder how can this be? They have “never” seen a case of DID. DID is hiding in plain sight. The dissociative symptoms are embedded in the co-morbidities and the poly-symptomatic ACE outcomes: subtle, covert, and minimized (Dell, 2009; Loewenstein, 1991a).\n\nThe DBS Model and Other Disorders\n\nPutnam (2016) describes how behavioral state theory can help one understand a variety of psychiatric disorders as “state-change” disorders. For example, he describes the profound shifts in behavioral states he observed when he studied rapid cycling bipolar patients at the National Institutes of Mental Health. As in DID, these patients showed a “switch process,” where marked changes in mood, activation level, motor activity, interpersonal relatedness, and cognition, as well as other variables, would rapidly shift when changing from profound depression to euthymia, to mania, and back again. Other psychiatric disorders can be conceptualized more broadly as state-change disorders: panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, periodic catatonia, brief psychotic disorder, PTSD, ASD, substance use disorders, gambling disorder, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, delirium, intermittent explosive disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, some parasomnias, DD such as dissociative amnesia and depersonalization/derealization disorder, and some forms of conversion disorder, e.g., psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can have aspects of state-change symptoms, e.g., ADHD children can alternate from disorganized, hyperactive states to hyperfocused states, e.g., when playing video games. In anorexia nervosa, loss of weight engenders a food-deprived, starvation state which dominates all aspects of the person’s consciousness. Classically, there are models for markedly different behavioral states during the progression of symptoms during the onset of first-episode psychosis, although more recent studies have found limited evidence for this model (Hafner et al., 2003). Some chronic schizophrenics may have rapid, stress-related onset of worsening in psychotic symptoms that can be understood in the DBS framework.\n\nPutnam (2016) hypothesizes that understanding discrete behavioral states could be a testable, organizing principle in the empirical study of mind/brain/body/behavior across many research paradigms and may allow for translational research from organismal to molecular levels of analysis (Putnam, 2016). For example, DBS theory also provides a framework for studying “normal” altered states: meditation, peak experiences, sexual experiences, epiphanies and spiritual experiences, ecstatic religious states, “secret lives,” and many others. DBS theory is relevant to neurobiological studies such as those of sleep and its stages; waking brain states, such as the default mode network versus other brain network states; very rapid shifts in brain microstates; and in the study of the cellular underpinnings of sleep stages at the molecular, cellular, and genetic levels.\n\nWhy Not Structural Dissociation Theory Instead of DBS Theory?\n\nOnno van der Hart, Ellert Nijenhuis, and Kathy Steele developed what they present as a comprehensive theory of dissociation: Structural Dissociation Theory (SDT) (van der Hart, Nijenhuis, & Steele, 2006; Steele, van der Hart, & Nijehhuis, 2009). SDT postulates an overarching theory of dissociation and attempts to account for a range of posttraumatic disorders, conceptualized as based on “structural dissociation of the personality.” These include all dissociative disorders (DD), acute stress disorder (ASD), “simple” PTSD, complex PTSD (CPTSD), “trauma-related” BPD, disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified (DESNOS) (Herman, 1993), ICD-10 “simple and complex” dissociative disorders of movement and sensation (DDMS) (World Health Organization, 1992), and DSM-5 conversion disorder (CD), also known as “functional neurological symptom disorder” (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; van der Hart et al., 2006). SDT is probably the most widely known theory of dissociation and is particularly prominent in Europe.\n\nSDT is largely based on the conceptual framework developed by Pierre Janet (1859–1947) for understanding psychological functions, as well as his theories about phenomenology and treatment of dissociation and hysteria (Janet, 1887, 1907, 1924; van der Hart & Friedman, 1989). However, consistent with DBS theory, van der Hart et al. report that “[t]he personality as a system can be understood as being comprised of various psychobiological states or subsystems that function in a cohesive and coordinated manner” (van der Hart et al., 2006) (page 2, italics added).\n\nAlthough, at times, SDT theorists use metaphors for psychobiological processes, they primarily describe the mind, behavior, personality, and dissociation using metaphors for structure. In the view of the author, the proponents of SDT appear unaware of the implications of their almost exclusive use of physicalist metaphors in their terminology—and, indeed, that these are metaphors, ones that particularly may lead to problematic reification of self-states (personal communication, Onno van der Hart, November 10, 2002, Baltimore, MD). Some psychoanalytic authors make a similar critique of the term “splitting” in the psychoanalytic literature as likely to lead to concrete, physicalist reification of mental processes (Lustman, 1977). In psychological epistemology, theorists need to be aware of the distance of their conceptualizations from empirical observation and scientific data, and that their terminology for hypothesized mental functions will invariably involve metaphor to convey meaning. Theorists need to be cognizant and explicit in their use of metaphors and, accordingly, be aware of their/our limitations conceptualizing abstractions like “the mind,” “personality,” “dissociation,” etc., and that different metaphors have varying connotations and denotations.\n\nIn SDT, “division in personality” is described by the term “dissociative parts of the personality”—a problematic term since a “personality” is not physical or mechanical, and, as an abstraction, cannot have “parts.” SDT follows the language of Charles Samuel Myers (Myers, 1915, 1916, 1940) who described severely traumatized soldiers in World War I as alternating between an Apparently Normal [Part of the] Personality (ANP), and an Emotional [Part of] the Personality (EP) (the term “Part of the” was added by van der Hart et al. (2006), p. 5). The hypothesized ANP is constricted and avoidant, unaware of traumatic memories, externally focused on daily life, and phobic of internal experiences. The EP is filled with the pain and distress of unintegrated, unprocessed traumatic memory.\n\nIn this theory, ASD, “simple types” of PTSD, DD, and disorders of movement and sensation result from a “single” EP and ANP. “Secondary structural dissociation” with one ANP and more than one EP results in CPTSD, DESNOS, DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) DDNOS, trauma-related BPD, and complex forms DDMS. “Tertiary structural dissociation” results in the development of DID, often with several ANPs and EPs that may be more “autonomous,” with the elaboration of secondary features of DID such as differing names, clothing, physical features, etc.\n\nA major issue with SDT is how to operationalize terms like “apparently,” “normal,” “emotional,” and “personality” for research purposes or for rigorous clinical work. For example, there is no overarching, unified scientific construct for “normal,” let alone “apparently normal.” Individuals with non-developmentally based PTSD can struggle with significant complexity of symptoms and difficulties in life, as well as co-morbidities. In the author’s view, the connotations that some disorders are “simple” and others “complex” are inherently problematic and may have the unintended consequence of individuals with “simple” disorders not being viewed as seriously as those with “complex” psychopathology.\n\nSDT proponents do cite DBS theory as essential in young children for the development of dissociation and attachment pathology, particularly type D, or disorganized attachment (Steele et al., 2009). As described by DBS theory, this type of attachment pathology is particularly associated with dissociation in the mothers, and development of symptomatic levels of dissociation in their children when they reach adolescence (Byun, Brumariu, & Lyons-Ruth, 2016; Farina, Liotti, & Imperatori, 2019; Liotti, 2009; Lyons-Ruth, Dutra, Schuder, & Bianchi, 2006; Ogawa, Sroufe, Weinfeld, Carslson, & Egeland, 1997). However, having posited developmental aspects of dissociation in DBS terms, SDT theorists quickly move back to using the oversimplified language of ANPs and EPs when describing what occurs as children develop. For example, they conceptualize a shifting of ANPs and EPs to explain the complex, interactional behavior of mothers and children with type-D attachment when studied in standardized attachment paradigms, e.g., the Strange Situation, as well as longitudinally (Carlson, 1998; Lyons-Ruth, 2008).\n\nThe SDT model appears to be based on reasoning backwards from observations of adult DID and other severely dissociative complex trauma patients. In contrast, the DBS model is grounded in observational, prospective and retrospective research on infant and child development, on children with attachment pathology, and on traumatized children and adolescents, as well as on a multi-generational, longitudinal case-control studies of sexually abused girls, among others (De Bellis & Putnam, 1994; Lewis & Yeager, 1996; Putnam, 1997, 2006, 2016; Silberg, 2000, 2004, 2013; Silberg & Dallam, 2009; Trickett et al., 2011).\n\nSDT proponents insist that their theory encompasses all forms of ASD and PTSD, not just DD, and that ASD and PTSD are fundamentally “dissociative.” However, comprehensive meta-analyses of PTSD and dissociation, along with rigorous statistical modeling, are consistent with dissociation as either a subtype or a component of PTSD, rather than dissociation as underlying all forms of PTSD (Dalenberg & Carlson, 2012; Dalenberg, Glaser, & Alhassoon, 2012; Carlson, Dalenberg, & McDade-Montez, 2012).Footnote 2\n\nAt the level of clinical theory, SDT can be helpful as a heuristic for aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of posttraumatic and dissociative disorders, notwithstanding the problematic vocabulary (Boon, Steele, & van der Hart, 2011). Like other models of treatment for complex trauma and dissociative disorders, SDT posits a tripartite treatment framework that prioritizes safety and stability, and affect regulation and symptom management skills in stage 1; more intensive work on traumatic memories in stage 2; and focus on integration into life/fusion-integration of self states in stage 3, with additional post-integration therapy continuing in an extended stage 3 (Boon et al., 2011; Brand, McNary, et al., 2012; Herman, 2015; International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011; Kluft & Loewenstein, 2007; van der Hart et al., 2006). Despite their stance as Janetian theorists, SDT proponents do include some ideas from psychodynamic theory such as the therapeutic alliance, treatment frame, etc. (van der Hart et al., 2006). However, these are not integrated into SDT itself, losing a rich body of psychodynamic clinical theory. The author has argued that treatment of DID—as well as of DA—is best served by a synthesis of Janetian and Freudian notions (Loewenstein, 2014; Loewenstein et al., 2017; Loewenstein & Ross, 1992; Loewenstein & Welzant, 2010). SDT has been useful in neurobiological studies of DID, where traumatic identity states (TIS) have been compared with neutral identity states (NIS—presumably ANPs), as well as simulating controls on responses to personal trauma scripts (Reinders et al., 2016). On PET and fMRI scanning, as well as autonomic measures, TIS respond to trauma scripts similarly to non-dissociative PTSD subjects, while NIS respond as if the scripts represent non-autobiographical memory, and appear more like subjects with dissociative subtype of PTSD (Reinders et al., 2014).\n\nFinally, proponents of SDT view SDT as a “general theory” of all dissociative and posttraumatic disorders, as well as of conversion disorder. It is a top-down theory. Proponents of SDT posit that virtually all trauma-related psychopathology should be conceptualized according to their model. They appear to have a hegemonic view of their theory: that it should be uncritically adopted by the DD field, as well as its terminology, e.g., “dissociative parts of the personality,” “ANP,” “EP,” etc. They appear unaware of potential critiques of the theory and are discomfited when told that not everyone agrees with SDT, its terminology, their lack of acceptance of PTSD-DS and positing ASD and PTSD as fundamentally dissociative, etc. (personal communication, Ellert Nijenhuis, Berlin, Germany, March 31, 2012). Often, SDT supporters seem more concerned with adherence to the theory than in developing research methodology that could empirically test it. For example, Nijenhuis, in an attempt to counter the notion of PTSD-DS (2014), and unlike the work of Dalenberg and Carlson (2012) and Carlson et al. (2012), primarily gives theoretical and anecdotal arguments that ASD and PTSD are fundamentally “dissociative.” He does not provide meta-analytic data and cites limited empirical data in support of his view.\n\nIn the author’s view, the major problem with SDT is that it oversimplifies the complex experiences of traumatized individuals at a variety of levels: psychobiological, developmental, attachment-based, intrapsychic, cognitive, intellectual, emotional, interpersonal, relational, socio-cultural, etc. The major SDT proponents appear more concerned to fit all things posttraumatic and dissociative into their theory, rather than developing research to test it.\n\nCourts have diverged in findings of competence to stand trial (CTS) and criminal responsibility (NGRI or NCR) for DID defendants based on differing ways of viewing the disorder (Behnke, 1997b). At least one district court rejected DID as a valid diagnosis to be considered for an insanity defense plea, but this ruling was reversed on appeal (Lewis & Bard, 1991). Both trial and appeals courts in state and federal jurisdictions have ruled that DID meets Frye and/or Daubert criteria so it may legitimately be used as a criminal defense, as well as that DID individuals can testify in court experiencing themselves as specific self states (Armstrong, 2001; Mao, 2019).\n\nIn criminal cases, Mens rea, the state of mind indicating culpability for criminal acts, may seem hard to determine in an individual who claims dense amnesia for crimes and/or who experiences him/herself as dissociative self states that variously profess or deny responsibility for criminal behavior (Armstrong, 2001; Behnke, 1997a, 1997b; Lewis & Bard, 1991; Sinnott-Armstrong & Behneke, 2001). Some legal scholars have suggested that, in jurisdictions that allow it, a DID defendants’ behavior may allow an actus reus defense based on the inability to control one’s actions, as in crimes committed in epileptic or somnambulistic states (personal communication, Alan Scheflin, J.D., L.L.M, March 14, 2008, Baltimore, MD; see Gravely, 1982). In a recent high-profile criminal case, a defendant who shot an alleged past abuser used severe depersonalization—an out of body experience—as a psychiatric defense. He was found not criminally responsible, based on involuntary action. That defendant did not claim a diagnosis of DID (Blair, 2002).\n\nDID defendants may not be able to give reliable testimony in their own defense due to amnesia and lack of awareness of the behavior of self states. Conversely, questions can be raised as to whether the DID individual’s self states can be called to give testimony as “independent” witnesses on behalf of the defendant. When the DID individual is the alleged victim of a crime, similar questions may arise about whether the DID individual is competent to give testimony in court, either as a “whole” human being or as self states testifying as separate entities. In a recent Australian criminal case, a woman diagnosed with DID testified, as several different self states, that her father had subjected her to years of extreme sadistic sexual, emotional, and physical abuse. Based largely on her testimony—in part confirmed by other family members, physical evidence, and the father’s prior record of convictions for sexual crimes—her father was convicted of multiple counts of childhood rape and sentenced to 45 years in prison (Mao, 2019).\n\nOften, the conflation of DID self states with separate people has led to legal rulings based on the question of which self state was in charge of committing the crime, and how to view the “uninvolved” self states with apparent amnesia for the crime (Behnke, 1997b). Behnke describes three analyses that the courts have used in this regard. The first tests the mental state of the “alter that was out [in control of the body]” at the time of the offense. The second tests the mental state of the “host” alter at the time of the crime. The third attempts to test the mental state of “all of the alters” at the time of the crime. The latter has sometimes devolved into attempts to evaluate the mental state of each self state at the time of the crime. One extreme legal theory posits that DID self states should be treated like separate individuals so that those “uninvolved’ in criminal behavior would, by definition, be absolved of responsibility, and a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity would be mandated (Saks, 1997; Watkins, 1976). The fundamental problem with this view is illuminated in the apocryphal rejoinder of a judge responding to an alleged DID murder defendant, “We’ll send the ones of you who did it to jail, and the rest of you can go free.”\n\nThe main critique of these forensic conceptualizations of DID is that courts, forensic evaluators, and attorneys have reified the self states, confounding their cognitions and behaviors with those of separate persons and failing to view the self states as psychobiological entities developed in the mind of an individual human being (Armstrong, 2001; Behnke, 1997a, 1997b; Kluft, 1988; Lewis & Bard, 1991; Loewenstein et al., 2017; Loewenstein, 2018; Putnam, 1988; Sinnott-Armstrong & Behneke, 2001).\n\nArmstrong (2001) and others posit that the clinical standard of holding the “whole human being” responsible for the behavior of any self state should be the foundation for the evaluation of DID criminal defendants (Simeon & Loewenstein, 2009), notwithstanding claims of amnesia or lack of agency. Clinically, this stance is associated with progress and improvement in adaptive functioning (Brand, McNary, et al., 2012; Brand, Myrick, et al., 2012; Brand, Schielke, et al., 2019). Failure to hold the whole human responsible for behavior usually results in regression and treatment stalemate (Beahrs, 1994; Brand, Loewenstein, & Lanius, 2014; International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011). An affirmative case should be made that the DID defendant, as the whole human being, meets the standard for incompetence to stand trial, NGRI/NCR, diminished capacity, etc., just as would be the case for any psychiatric defendant (Behnke, 1997a, 1997b; Sinnott-Armstrong & Behneke, 2001).\n\nThe Hillside Strangler\n\nThe Hillside Strangler case (1977–1983) was a highly publicized, major criminal case involving contentious expert clashes about MPD/DID. It represents a paradigmatic portrayal of the conflicts that can arise about CTS and NGRI and MPD/DID, particularly when forensic experts conceptualize DID self states as essentially equivalent to separate people. As will be discussed, Ms. Neely’s own, often compelling reification of self states was a significant factor in the difficulties forensic examiners had in assessing her for CTS/NGRI.\n\nThe battle of the experts in the Hillside Strangler case pre-figured major debates among academics, legal theorists, and the public about dissociation, DA, and DID that culminated in the early 1990s with the rise of false memory syndrome (FMS) (see Loewenstein et al., 2017). The major expert witnesses, John Watkins, Ph.D., and Martin Orne, Ph.D., both with extensive academic and clinical backgrounds in hypnosis, were opponents in their views of hypnosis, dissociation, childhood sexual abuse, DA, and MPD/DID. Watkins was a pioneer in the diagnosis and treatment of dissociative and posttraumatic disorders (Watkins & Watkins, 1984, 1988). Orne later became a prominent member of the academic advisory board of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF), opposing the validity of DID and DA (“recovered memory”), and discounting the prevalence and importance of reports of childhood sexual abuse (Orne, Whitehouse, Dinges, & Orne, 1988; Karlin & Orne, 1996).\n\nIn the Hillside Strangler case, two cousins, Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono, were arrested for the serial rape, torture, and murder of 10 women in the Los Angeles area between 1977 and 1978. The women were left posed and naked on hillsides, terrorizing the community (George, 2000). In January 1979, Bianchi was arrested in Bellingham, Washington, and charged with the rape and murder of two other women. His apparent behavioral problems led his attorneys to request a forensic psychological evaluation, provided by John Watkins, Ph.D. During Watkins’s extended examination, Bianchi confessed to the Hillside Strangler murders and also implicated his cousin. However, Bianchi claimed that his crimes were “really” committed by an evil self state named “Steve.” Five different psychological and psychiatric forensic experts provided opinions on Bianchi’s diagnosis and mental state during the crimes. Most important was the clash between Watkins and Orne, the major forensic experts for the defense and the prosecution, respectively.\n\nWatkins insisted that his extensive record review, history, and forensic examination of Bianchi, including repeated hypnotic sessions and psychological assessment, conclusively supported the diagnosis of DID (then MPD), and, ipso facto, the finding of lack of criminal responsibility. Watkins believed that, in terms of criminal responsibility, all MPD/DID defendants manifested relatively separate entities, one innocent and one criminal, leading to findings of NGRI (Watkins, 1976). Watkins described two self states said to exist in Bianchi: “Ken,” who was complaisant and unassuming, and “Steve,” a sadistic, sexual psychopath who confessed to the murders (Watkins, 1984). Subsequently, Orne did his own comprehensive examination, including review of the psychological assessment measures; evaluations of Bianchi in apparent hypnotic states; and eliciting ostensible switches between the purported self states. Ultimately, Orne opined that Bianchi met DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association, 1980) diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder and sexual sadism and was malingering both MPD/DID and being in a true hypnotic state (Orne et al., 1984).\n\nBoth Watkins and Orne assessed the purported self states as if these were separate people. Although disagreeing on many other aspects of the case, both Watkins and Orne conceptualized DID consistent with the DSM-III diagnostic criteria for DID, which were very different from all subsequent DSM diagnostic criteria (see Loewenstein et al., 2017 for a discussion of the evolution of the ICD and DSM diagnostic criteria for DID). Orne et al. (1984) opined that, in bone fide DID: “(a) [T]he structure and content of the various personalities should have been consistent over time, (b) the boundaries between different personalities should have been stable and not readily altered by social cues, (c) the response to hypnosis should have been similar to that of other deeply hypnotized subjects, and (d) those who had known [Bianchi] over a period of years should have been able to provide examples of sudden, inexplicable changes in behavior and identity, and evidence to corroborate his claimed intermittent amnesias” (page 118, italics added).\n\nWatkins administered the Rorschach separately, twice to Bianchi, purportedly as each self state, as if he was entirely different people. Testing was scored blindly by defense and prosecution Rorschach experts, who were not told that these were different protocols from the same human being. Watkins’ expert opined that the testing showed definitive manifestations of different people: a mildly “neurotic” person (K) and a murderous, sexually sadistic, extremely ill, possibly schizophrenic, criminal (S) (Watkins, 1984). Orne’s assessor concluded that the tests showed different aspects of the same, sociopathic person (Orne et al., 1984). After Orne’s examination prevailed, Bianchi pled guilty, admitted his malingering and, in exchange for leniency, agreed to testify against Buono, (George, 2000). After a lengthy trial, both men were convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nFactors Affecting Forensic Assessment of DID\n\nLittle systematic data has been acquired about DID individuals in the criminal justice system, except case series (Lewis et al., 1997), and a case series of male DID patients, about half of whom had criminal justice involvement, either for major, violent felonies or for less severe crimes like drunk and disorderly conduct, although female DID individuals also reported engaging in violent and even homicidal behavior (Loewenstein & Putnam, 1990). A recent study of all 82,500 prison inmates in Taiwan found that ICD-10 dissociative disorder diagnoses were the most common in both males and female inmates (Tung, Hsiao, Shen, & Huang, 2019).\n\nWith information about DID increasingly available in academic publications and popular media, feigners may develop more sophisticated ways of imitating DID symptoms and its clinical presentation (Brand, Armstrong, et al., 2006; Brand, McNary, Loewenstein, Kolos, & Barr, 2006; Brand, Webermann, et al., 2016; Kluft, 1991). In general, authorities agree that “authentic DID defendants are more likely to show a complex self state system, not just a “good/bad” self -state dichotomy with putative self states that do not manifest outside of the claim of non-responsibility (Brown & Scheflin, 1999; Kluft, 1987c). In addition to disavowal of responsibility by blaming self states for behavior, some DID individuals, both in clinical and forensic settings, may feign greater severity of DID symptoms, such as more extreme dissociative amnesia (Scott, 2012), report factitious trauma histories, or lie about other aspects of their life history (Brand, Webermann, et al., 2016; Brand, Schielke, & Brams, 2017; Brand, Schielke, Brams, et al., 2017; Brown & Scheflin, 1999; Kluft, 1987c). Bone fide DID defendants may have bizarre, idiosyncratic explanations for why and how they (as different self states) committed crimes, not just that “the bad one did it” (Armstrong, 2001). However, as with psychotic defendants, bizarre, idiosyncratic thinking does not necessarily compel the finding that DID defendants are incompetent to stand trial, NGRI, NCR, etc. (Armstrong, 2001).\n\nSome genuine DID defendants minimize their psychiatric symptoms and attempt to avoid being labeled psychiatrically ill. Others may behave in self-defeating ways that can undermine their defense (Kluft, 1987c; Lewis et al., 1997). Complicating assessment is the phenomenon of “imitative DID,” in which individuals, their concerned others, and even their treatment providers believe in the person’s inaccurate DID diagnosis, with the person building a life around the diagnosis and being a survivor of childhood trauma (Draijer & Boon, 1999). A body of research has attempted to distinguish feigners, including DID individuals who feign aspects of their disorder, on a variety of standard clinical and forensic measures. A group of psychological assessment measures, and an approach to assessing dissociation on these, has been developed that can aid in the differential diagnosis of feigned DID, imitative DID, and genuine DID augmented by feigning (Brand, Armstrong, et al., 2006; Brand, McNary, et al., 2006; Brand, Tursich, et al., 2014; Brand, Chasson, et al., 2016; Brand, Schielke, & Brams, 2017; Brand, Schielke, Brams, et al., 2017; Brand et al., 2018; Brand, Webermann, et al., 2019; Vissia et al., 2016).\n\nAs in all forensic psychiatric assessment, it is the totality of the data that will determine forensic opinions: clinical assessment; corollary history; comprehensive review of psychiatric, medical, social service, prison, and educational records; police reports, deposition and witness testimony; forensic laboratory data; and psychological assessment measures. In some cases, extended periods of observation have been required to successfully assess partial or complete feigning in purported DID individuals (American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, 2015; Brown & Scheflin, 1999; Kluft, 1987c). As in the assessment of any psychiatric defendant, one must consider the presence of co-morbid disorders and factors such as the planning or impulsivity of the crime (Armstrong, 2001; Bourget & Whitehurst, 2007; Bourget, Gagne, & Wood, 2017).\n\nThe Forensic Assessments of Ms. Neely\n\nIn the four forensic evaluations, much of the same data were described concerning Ms. Neely’s past, personal, clinical, and legal history, but the conclusions were discrepant (see Table 3).\n\nThe State\n\nDiagnosis\n\nMs. Neely had forensic assessments and reports from the state forensic psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, and a physical therapist. She was extraordinarily difficult to interview, with substantial variability in clinical presentation, apparent access to memory, and ability to ambulate. The neurological and physical therapy evaluations confirmed the findings that her apparent weakness varied considerably and was not associated with any known neurological pattern.\n\nWhen the forensic evaluators attempted to take a narrative history of the alleged offenses, Ms. Neely denied that she could have set the witnessed fire because she never went anywhere without her leg braces. She absolutely denied setting the fire at her former therapist’s home. When the interviewer asked more about her possible culpability in the fire at Ms. Brown’s home, Ms. Neely switched to a child self state and became non-responsive to questions. When it was decided to take her back to her room, Ms. Neely began to bang her temples with her fists. When approached by male staff to contain the behavior, she bolted out of the chair, ran down the hall, and attempted to break the barred windows. Later, calmer and more grounded, she met with the unit psychiatrist. She both denied recall of the event yet seemed to recall it in detail. When questioned about this, she became defensively externalizing, blaming the unit and the staff and insisting she “was here for treatment of my DID.”\n\nWhen she was able to participate in testing, she exhibited switching behavior with highly variable access to information. When questioned about this, she became defensive and threatened to end interviews. She had highly variable responses to psychological assessments. She took an inordinate amount of time on several measures, e.g., the Structured Interview for Reported Symptoms (SIRS) (Rogers, Bagby, & Dickens, 1992), although she did not fall in the definite feigning range. Due to the excessive amount of time it took Ms. Neely to respond to questions, the assessor gave up on administering the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (Steinberg, 1994), a semi-structured diagnostic interview generally accepted as the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of dissociative disorders, including DID.\n\nMs. Neely answered difficult questions correctly, but not simple ones. For example, she denied ability to read a digital watch but could easily draw an analog clock and number it correctly, but then she put in the incorrect time by reversing the hands. She scored over 80 on the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) (Bernstein & Putnam, 1986), an exceptionally high score generally associated with a “cry for help” pattern or deliberate exaggeration or feigning. Ms. Neely had a high probability of being in the “pathological dissociation” taxon (DES-T) that comprises individuals that meet diagnostic criteria for DID or similar severe dissociative psychopathology (Waller, Putnam, & Carlson, 1996).Footnote 4\n\nOn the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) (Briere, Elliott, Harris, & Cotman, 1995), Ms. Neely had an invalid profile because she did not answer questions about sexuality. On a retest by the defense expert, she again had an invalid profile but wrote cogent comments about her responses in the margin.Footnote 5 Several other measures were invalid due to failure to answer a substantial number of questions. In totality, the state’s expert opined that Ms. Neely did not meet diagnostic criteria for DID because of her highly variable claims of amnesia. The state’s psychological expert also wondered if the DID diagnosis had been so reinforced by “suggestive” prior treatment that even the notable switching behaviors could be better conceptualized as feigning. Further, she made the diagnosis of Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder but was unable to rule out consciously feigned somatic symptoms. She opined that Ms. Neely met criteria for BPD, and could meet criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder, as there were no data concerning the necessary history of antisocial behavior prior to age 18.\n\nCompetence\n\nThe state psychiatrist reviewed all the testing, neurological data, and his own psychiatric interviews, and concurred with these diagnostic conclusions. He opined that Ms. Neely had both the factual and rational understanding to meet the competency standard. He stated that when Ms. Neely was questioned directly about matters related to competency or legal insanity, she professed ignorance, amnesia, and confusion and made grossly incorrect statements, e.g., that she could not have committed a crime that she did not recall. However, when not being questioned directly, Ms. Neely had excellent recall, advocated strongly for her “rights” in the hospital, deflected responsibility for behavior, and remained without dissociative state changes through even long, stressful interactions. At these times, she appeared shrewdly aware of the legal system and her interactions with her attorney.\n\nSanity\n\nIn terms of questions concerning legal insanity, the report continued, “…[Ms. Neely’s] statements indicated that she knew that fire setting was wrong and there is no evidence that she suffers from delusions or hallucinations that would impair her ability to appreciate wrongfulness…She has been able to follow complex rules and conform behavior in a stressful situation…with few exceptions. The theory of complex actions occurring in an altered state is not supported by the psychiatric diagnoses made by the [State Hospital] treatment team and myself…For these reasons…I cannot support a finding of insanity at the time or that she lacked the mental state for the alleged crime.”\n\nThe Defense\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThe forensic psychologist for the defense had considerable experience in the clinical and forensic assessment of DID. His opinions were diametrically opposed to those of the State Hospital team. He conducted lengthy videotaped interviews with Ms. Neely, who had been transferred to state prison. He administered psychological assessment measures, some of which overlapped with those of the state hospital.\n\nHis report began with a series of questions, but the main diagnostic question was dichotomous: does Ms. Neely “have” DID, or is she malingering. He described a plethora of data that led him to conclude the DID diagnosis was accurate. In addition to the findings of his own extended videotaped diagnostic assessment, he cites the historical data from Ms. Neely’s 20+ years of medical records documenting essentially the same named self states, switching behaviors, dense but state-dependent dissociative amnesia, and symptoms and signs of DID that feigners would be unlikely to demonstrate, e.g., headaches in response to internal conflict among the self states or sudden, brief dissociative memory lapses that occur during clinical interviews, sometimes termed “micro-dissociations” (Loewenstein, 1991a). He notes that many non-clinical observers: neighbors, the patient’s husband and sons, Ms. Neely’s attorney, in addition to virtually all previous clinicians, have reported interacting with essentially the same groups of self states, witnessed seemingly uncontrolled switching behaviors, chronic complex dissociative amnesia symptoms, etc. He points out that even the state hospital assessment team documented these same findings, although these evaluators interpreted the symptoms as indicia of malingering or the results of suggestive therapies. He reports that Ms. Neely’s attorney was so baffled by his client that he attended a workshop on DID with one of the world’s experts, Richard P. Kluft, M.D., Ph.D. Further, this assessor persisted in having Ms. Neely complete the SCID-D assessment, with findings supporting the DID diagnosis.\n\nCompetence\n\nThe defense evaluator concluded that Ms. Neely lacked both the factual and rational capacities that underlies a finding of CTS. He based this on what he viewed as uncontrolled, unpredictable switching among self states. Even if some self states could meet the test for competence, others clearly did not. There was no way to assure that the relevant self states could be accessed when needed, or that adequate continuous memory for facts and information would be available. He noted that a seemingly minor, common environmental sound regularly produced an “uncontrolled switch” to a disoriented, confused child state. Once this state was “forward”, Ms. Neely was very difficult to reorient to a more grounded, better adapted state. On video, he documented an event when he was inquiring of Ms. Neely whether there was any internal “control” over switching. Ms. Neely suddenly switched to a violent self state, became highly agitated, banged on the walls with her fists, and finally attacked the camera. Guards entered the interview room to restrain Ms. Neely and the interview ended. Based on these, and similar observations, the evaluator concluded that relatively minor, even irrelevant stimuli could provoke highly maladaptive, uncontrolled, unpredictable switching behaviors that could disrupt interactions with Ms. Neely’s attorney, as well as in court. Thus, he deemed Ms. Neely incapable of consistently understanding the proceedings or rationally collaborating with counsel.\n\nThe expert cited his own theory that the test for whether a DID individual is CTS or NGRI depends on the idea of “coherence” of the self-state system. He described “Doris” as the “core personality” that had no ability to control switching behaviors. Further, he described what appeared to be major amnestic barriers and lack of control of switching among all other self states disrupting Ms. Neely’s ability to participate meaningfully in the legal process.\n\nInsanity\n\nThe defense expert used similar reasoning to support a finding of NGRI for both charges, although Ms. Neely consistently and completely denied the second charge. He reports that, when asking about her mental state at the time of the observed fire-setting, Ms. Neely described the following as the Jeffrey state: “Me and one other [self state] had spotted a person who had hurt Doris in the past at least we thought it was the same person. We’d saw this person like a week or so earlier so we tried to follow them home—so I had an idea where they lived at. …When [Doris] was out driving that morning, I decided to go back [and] pay that person a visit to let them know what they did was not all right in any way. I went with intent to harm that person, not their home, so went in, that’s when we did something else, then this other person comes down the hallways I just think, oh shit it’s the wrong person so I had to get the hell out of there.” The author asked “Jeffrey” about the “something else” that happened and he reported, “Someone else came out and started the fire. I think at that time when the other guy, the kid came out, someone else [the other self state] got startled so they went back in [to the mind] and left me there.” This description, with references to the experience of switching, and of states as if they were separate people, and to the self as plural, or third person singular or plural, is consistent with the way many DID individuals describe the experience of multiplicity (Loewenstein, 1991a).\n\nThe defense expert concludes that “Doris,” “the core personality,” cannot “appreciate” the wrongfulness of conduct she cannot recall, hence meeting the first NGRI test. The seemingly “bizarre” description of the witnessed fire-setting (above) underlies the lack of “coherence” among Ms. Neely’s self states. Accordingly, because of this apparent uncontrolled switching, Doris cannot conform conduct since Doris cannot predict or control emergence or departure of any other self state, let alone recall her behavior when it is under the sway of these chaotically shifting states.\n\nFirst Court-Appointed Forensic Evaluation\n\nGiven these highly divergent opinions, the court, with agreement of the prosecution and defense attorneys, appointed a prominent forensic psychiatrist as an independent expert to evaluate Ms. Neely. He did not hold himself out as an expert in DID, but neither did he hold skeptical views of the existence DID. He had considerable experience in the forensic assessment of PTSD.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nHe reviewed all the data from Ms. Neely’s clinical and forensic records and conducted lengthy interviews with her. He also obtained collateral information from Mr. Neely, Ms. Neely’s attorney, and the law enforcement officers who arrested her for the current charges. Ms. Neely’s attorney described having substantial difficulties attempting to work with a client who claimed amnesia for, or denied committing even witnessed crimes, switched rapidly among various self states, and appeared not to assimilate basic information necessary to assist with her defense.\n\nDuring his interviews, the independent expert encountered switching behaviors among several of Ms. Neely’s self states, with the same names, characteristics, and repertoire of behaviors that had been described in all prior accounts. After evaluating all existing data, he agreed with the accuracy of the diagnosis of DID, although he carefully considered the kinds of discrepant data that were central in the state hospital’s determination of malingering. He agreed that Ms. Neely malingered aspects of her non-medically explained physical symptoms, but stated that some of these symptoms could be understood as a manifestation of a conversion disorder.\n\nHis views of DID led to his opinions about CTS and NGRI.\n\nCompetence\n\nHis opinions regarding Ms. Neely’s CTS were that Ms. Neely demonstrated sufficient factual understanding of the extant legal matters, but that the unpredictable and uncontrolled switching behaviors made her unable to have sufficient, continual rational understanding to consult with her attorney both in individual consultations and in the courtroom. The amnesia was too great, and it was impossible to predict which self state knew relevant information, and which state would emerge in court.\n\nLegal Insanity\n\nWith respect to NGRI, he based his opinions on the following analysis: He had no way of assessing Ms. Neely’s mental state at the time of the fire at Ms. Brown’s home, nor could he see a “reality-based motive” for that crime. Accordingly, he could not determine whether Ms. Neely could either appreciate wrongfulness or control conduct during that event.\n\nOn the other hand, given the data about the witnessed fire, Ms. Neely’s response of, “I’m sick,” clearly indicated an attempt to explain her behavior, and her comprehension at the time “that there was something to be explained.” With this comment, it could be inferred that Ms. Neely was attempting to disavow responsibility for her behavior.\n\nFurther, in past clinical settings, when approached or touched by males in a stressful situation, Ms. Neely had dissociated into the wildly disoriented Dorrie state. In other stressful situations, she had dissociated into dyscontrolled, rageful self states that have destroyed property and/or engaged in extreme forms of self-mutilation. In contrast, when the witness to the fire let go of Ms. Neely’s arm, she is described as calmly walking out of the house and driving away. Accordingly, this expert opined that Ms. Neely did not meet criteria for NGRI on these charges.\n\nHe also suggested an additional evaluation by someone with extensive experience in the diagnosis and treatment of DID. Accordingly, with the agreement of both the state and the defense attorneys, I performed the second court-ordered forensic evaluation of Ms. Neely.\n\nSecond Court-Ordered Evaluation—by the Author\n\nAssessment of Ms. Neely\n\nI reviewed all the available medical, law-enforcement, correctional, forensic, and psychiatric records, including videotaped police interviews and an edited version of the defense expert’s videos. I reviewed the three prior expert forensic reports and the psychological assessment reports, including score-sheets and raw data. I also reviewed emails sent by Ms. Neely to Ms. Brown. I interviewed Ms. Neely for about 20 h over 4 days and also interviewed Mr. Neely and one of their adult sons for 2 h. I interviewed Ms. Brown for about 2 h. Also, I interviewed Ms. Neely’s attorney, as well as medical and nursing staff of the state hospital. Initially, Ms. Neely resisted consenting to my interviewing her past mental health providers. Her lawyer insisted that she give consent, and she reluctantly did so. I interviewed six of Ms. Neely’s prior treatment providers by phone, going back to the clinician who initially made the DID diagnosis. I asked Ms. Neely to complete the self-report diagnostic inventory, the Multidimensional Inventory for Dissociation (MID) (Dell, 2006a, 2006b). As with other instruments, Ms. Neely left much of the questionnaire blank, invalidating the measure.\n\nIn assessing Ms. Neely, I was not particularly interested in the manifest presentational differences of the self states. Rather, I wanted to understand the self states’ subjective “personal” history, functions, and the extent to which both pathological and resilience factors would manifest within particular self states, across the self-state-system, and across “the whole mind.”\n\nInterviewing Ms. Neely\n\nThe first 2 interviews lasted only about 2 h each, as hospital administration mandated that Ms. Neely be interviewed on the inpatient unit. She was inhibited from fully answering questions due to the objectively loud unit and the requirement of an open door for 1:1 observation brought about by her repeated dangerousness to self. Ms. Neely began with a litany of paranoid-sounding complaints. She was being lied to, tricked, railroaded. She refused to allow me to videotape her, as the defense expert had done, stating that the taping would be used against her. She declared that she was being targeted in the hospital unit. She was hypervigilant, and, at one point, suddenly demanded to know if I had a secret recording device under my papers. She querulously perseverated about Ms. Brown. How could she think Ms. Neely would have attempted arson at her home? It was Ms. Brown who had insisted on the termination meeting, on keeping in contact with Ms. Neely after the end of treatment. Why did she threaten a restraining order if Ms. Neely did not stop calling her? How could she have set the fire, as it was discovered while she was at the police station being interrogated, etc.\n\nInitially, she said that I must be there to help her get admitted to the Trauma Disorders Program at Sheppard Pratt. I explained that this was impossible. She began to perseverate that she had been lied to by her lawyer, the defense expert, and others who had “promised” that meeting with me was solely to assist her in transferring to a hospital that would “help” her. In my interview with her attorney, he said he had repeatedly conveyed the correct information to Ms. Neely, but somehow it was never retained. He said that this was typical of the problems Ms. Neely presented as a client. She could not seem to collaborate with him on the legal issues.\n\nAcross all interviews, just as in all prior police and forensic interviews, Ms. Neely never expressed concern about Ms. Brown, her pets, the damage to her home, etc. Referring to the arson resulting in her arrest, she told me that, when brought to the police station, her first question was, “was anybody hurt?” As noted above, her first question, actually, was whether the young man who caught her had said she was using her crutches.\n\nAs prior interviewers found, when I attempted to ask any direct question bearing on her legal situation, Ms. Neely would shift topics, appeared to experience blocking, responded irrelevantly, and/or denied that the questions had any relationship to her situation. She would rock, moan, cover her ears, stare off blankly, and become mute. At this point, I decided to engage by talking over to Ms. Neely’s self states, as I would a putative DID patient in a clinical situation. Also, this was one of the myriad ways that I attempted to indirectly assess the DID diagnosis. As I did so, Ms. Neely began to respond in ways typical of DID. I asked her about inner voices, inner conflict, and inner prohibitions on answering my questions. In particular, whenever I approached a sensitive topic, Ms. Neely reported voices telling her, “move on,” “we’re not answering that now,” etc. She described thought insertion, removal, made impulses, blackouts, finding unexplained possessions, being told of behavior—even positive behavior—she did not recall, and other symptoms pathognomonic for DID. She repeatedly referred to herself in the first person plural and third person singular and plural.\n\nI observed typical DID phenomenology of overlap and interference between self states, such as subtle facial changes including appearing more childlike, variable eye contact with eyes darting to the side as if listening to voices, eyelid fluttering, rapid blinking, touching her face when she admitted hearing voices, shifting posture, leg shaking, then stopping shaking, appearing frozen, etc. (Armstrong, Laurenti, & Loewenstein, 1991).\n\nAs I tracked her responses, far from the chaotic, incomprehensible presentation described by prior evaluators, I quickly was aware that Ms. Neely’s behavior was not random, but purposive. This included her refusals to answer when the “voices” insisted, as well as suddenly appearing to go into a trance, saying the inner voices were getting too “loud inside,” that she had forgotten what had just been asked, etc. This occurred primarily when I approached any question that might bear on the crimes with which she was charged, her understanding of legal processes like CTS, etc. Similarly, she emitted these dissociative symptoms/behaviors when I asked questions related to interactions between self states, control over state switching, and subjectively experienced relationships among self states. I became aware, behind the apparent “surface” chaos, of a hypervigilant awareness that was observing me and appearing to be carefully calibrating Ms. Neely’s responses: “Move on. Next question.” Even the surface Doris state clearly had more internal communication and inner awareness than had been previously described.\n\nAfter the first two abortive interviews, the hospital administration allowed me to interview Ms. Neely in a room off the unit, with staff sitting outside the closed door. During the next six-hour interview, Ms. Neely, as Doris, described and demonstrated a panoply of dissociative symptoms pathognomonic for DID: chronic complex dissociative amnesia; marked forms of passive influence; spontaneous age-regression experiences; blocking; micro-dissociations during the interview; hearing voices in her mind that she identified as those of specific named self states; descriptions of PTSD symptoms; and cues for intrusive symptoms and flashbacks, such as certain dates, colors, a train whistle, certain dog species, all consistent with prior observations. She continued to have variable internal communication with self states during the interview. In the Doris state, Ms. Neely complained about autobiographical memory deficits ascribed to the “3-day coma,” although no memory deficit was present in other self states. As Doris, she continued to hear the voice saying, “move on,” “don’t answer that question,” “we’ll answer that later.” She asked the voice, “what do you know that I don’t know?” then became confused.\n\nThe defense expert portrayed Ms. Neely as a virtual DID feral child: completely ungovernable, chaotic, and without “coherence” because, in his view, she never had proper treatment. Based on the record, Ms. Neely actually had over 20 years of treatment, some reasonably good—including the work by the dedicated Ms. Brown in a very difficult situation. In several treatments, including the most recent one, despite Ms. Neely’s problems, therapists made Herculean efforts to assist her with safety, stabilization, countering regression, and supporting more effective internal communication, collaboration, and coordination among self states. In my interviews, Ms. Neely gave a past history, including trauma history, essentially consistent with the records and reports of prior providers. She described and displayed the same cohort of self states, with the same attributes, as described in all prior medical records and in accounts of past providers. Also, consistently as Doris, she recalled the sequence of events on the day of her arrest consistent with all prior interviews.\n\nIn describing her relationship with Ms. Brown, Ms. Neely spoke of her in a covertly aggrieved tone, implying that she, Ms. Neely, had done nothing wrong, but that Ms. Brown was in the wrong for “accusing me” of setting the fire at her home. When we later returned to discussing the situation with Ms. Brown and I mentioned that, on the defense expert’s video, she had reported calling Ms. Brown, “Mommy,” Ms. Neely expressed surprise and denied this.\n\nSuddenly, she began to shake, tremble, moan, hold her head, cover her eyes, and shake her legs rapidly. She stopped these movements, looked up with a terrified stare, and, in a childlike voice, began talking about not being able to “go see Mommy no more.” She identified herself as “Sonny,” and in a stuttering voice—child self states sometimes present with quasi-childlike speech—perseverated about “Mommy” and how “we be bad. Not go see Mommy anymore.”\n\nIn the state hospital, emergence of the Sonny state led to a cascade of switching followed by a dyscontrol episode and termination of the interview—just when the interviewer was starting to inquire about Ms. Neely’s state of mind at the time of the arson. The defense expert cited the sudden, seemingly unpredictable and intractable emergence of “Sonny” as indicative of Ms. Neely’s uncontrollable PTSD symptoms. However, these disruptions occurred when he inquired about Ms. Neely’s mental state during the alleged crimes, not randomly. Here, the switch to the Sonny self state had a clear prompt: the question about the complex issue of calling a therapist “Mommy,” which Ms. Neely wanted to disavow, as it indicated her attachment to Ms. Brown.\n\nOften, DID individuals report consciously “sending out” a child state to deflect from a difficult topic and appease the interviewer. DID individuals describe learning to be as “little” and inoffensive as possible when endangered by childhood perpetrators, learning not to fight back, as attempts at fight or flight usually resulted in “getting hurt worse.” In clinical work with DID, when a DID patient feels threatened by, or is fearful of, the therapist or of a topic in therapy, shifting to a child state is often an attempt to change the subject. Experienced therapists usually confront the patient about this and educate the patient about the developmental impact of role reversals of adults and children. Most experienced DID therapists do not spend much time interacting with child self states, finding therapy to be more effective if one works preferentially with the states that actually have control functions, which typically are angry, violent, subjectively persecutory, seemingly “bad” self states. I surmised that the appearance of “Sonny” had a dual meaning. It was an attempt to deflect from a topic indicating disavowed distress at losing Ms. Brown. The child state embodied the thwarted dependence and loss of “Mommy.” At the same time, as in the state hospital and the defense expert’s interview, perseverating, disoriented child states would prevent any further inquiry of a topic potentially related to the motive for an arson at Ms. Brown’s home.\n\nAfter interacting with the self state Sonny for a few minutes, I used a technique from clinical work with DID to attempt to retrieve a more functional state. I explained to “Sonny” that “this is a grown-up conversation” and asked whether “he” would agree to “step back” and “perhaps go to sleep in a peaceful, quiet place inside the mind” so I could continue to talk to a “grown-up.” Sonny agreed that as I counted from 1 to 3, he would “take 3 giant steps back within the mind and find a peaceful quiet place to sleep.” As I counted, Ms. Neely responded rapidly and completely, stretching out her arms and putting her head down on them, as would an exhausted child.\n\nUsing this clinical intervention also helped in assessing how readily Ms. Neely’s dysfunctional switching behaviors could be made more manageable and evaluating her innate hypnotizability (International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011; Kluft, 2012). DID individuals have the highest hypnotic capacity of any clinical group (Frischholz, Lipman, Braun, & Sachs, 1992; Kluft, 1992). A common, erroneous idea is that hypnosis is used primarily for “memory recovery” in DID therapy (American Society of Clinical Hypnosis Committee on Hypnosis and Memory, 1994; Brown, Scheflin, & Whitfield, 1999; Kluft, 2012). In the vast preponderance of situations, hypnosis in DID is used for symptom management, containment, grounding, etc. Far from using hypnosis for unearthing “repressed memories,” in work on traumatic memories in DID, hypnotic techniques are used to moderate the impact of overwhelming PTSD flashbacks: disorganizing, disorienting, posttraumatic auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, somatic, and/or somatosensory intrusions (Brand, Loewenstein, & Spiegel, 2014; International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011). Experts point out that, due to the naturalistic occurrence of spontaneous auto-hypnotic phenomena in DID, no treatment of DID occurs without “hypnosis” (International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., 2011; Kluft, 2012).\n\nHowever, despite the high hypnotizability, DID patients can readily resist or rapidly come out of a trance for a variety of psychodynamic and trauma-based reasons. If Ms. Neely had chosen not to respond, she would most assuredly have found a way to further disrupt the interview. Momentarily, without any physical problems, Ms. Neely raised her head again, sat up, blew her nose, and with better eye contact, straighter posture, and a much deeper voice identified herself as “Jeffrey,” stating, “I’ve been waiting to talk to you for 3 days.”\n\nIn this state, Ms. Neely spoke with me for about 2 h, calmly, cogently, without dissociative overlap or interference or intrusive PTSD symptoms. In the Jeffrey state, Ms. Neely talked at length about her childhood history, including abuse. As Jeffrey, Ms. Neely described being able to “walk around” without difficulty. Ms. Neely talked at length about the details of the exorcistic therapy, including attempts to expel demons and in particular the futile attempts to exorcize the Jeffrey state qua “Satan, Lucifer.” Later, Mr. Neely gave a history of that period that was consistent with “Jeffrey’s” description. Some of the therapy history was also confirmed by the therapist with whom Ms. Neely worked subsequently, who reportedly reported the case to the state licensing board.\n\nIn the Jeffrey state, Ms. Neely described the reported rape prior to the end of her treatment with Ms. Brown: “… [It] happened to Anne, Dorrie and another kid [child state].” As Jeffrey, she was able to describe how destabilizing this event had been. Her description is consistent with that of other DID patients recounting the impact of an adult sexual assault. During this description, the Jeffrey state remained grounded, spoke with appropriate affect, and did not display any intrusive symptoms or signs of posttraumatic reactivity.\n\nAs Jeffery, she began to hint at talking with me about the events on the day of the fires. She stated that Red would have to be “the one to talk about it.” Relatively soon afterwards, the Jeffrey state reported that “it’s time for me to go back inside.” With a brief counting induction, I assisted the return of the Doris state, who was concerned that “Dorrie was pushing to come out,” possibly as a delayed, posttraumatic reaction to discussion of the reported rape. Again, I was easily able to help the Dorrie state “step back” and go into a state of subjective sleep, calming Ms. Neely. This dynamic is common in DID. Self states that experience themselves as disconnected from emotions engendered by traumatic memories can talk about traumatic events in matter-of-fact terms, whereas others subjectively “hold” the emotional content. As discussed above, the PET and fMRI studies of Reinders et al. (2014, 2016) demonstrate different brain activation patterns in self states that experience trauma as autobiographical memory, compared with those who do not. These studies delineate what may be a neurobiological substrate for this clinical phenomenon.\n\nI was not surprised that a traumatized self state, Dorrie, would be activated by the discussion and “push forward.” However, I was struck by how easily and completely Ms. Neely responded to hypnotic containment techniques and that the Dorrie state—usually portrayed as an ineluctably emergent force—could so easily be contained. This indicated that Ms. Neely had considerably more control, though surely not total control, over switching behaviors, even when intense posttraumatic reactivity appeared to be intruding.\n\nLater that day, I interviewed the patient’s husband and son for about 2 h. Mr. Neely minimized Ms. Neely’s history of antisocial behavior, deflecting the blame onto past therapists, misunderstandings, overreactions, etc. Neither reported any history of severe head injury. However, they described that the memory loss occurred during a time when Ms. Neely was under severe stress, having to manage the family and children while her husband’s travels for work had escalated. They showed me one of Ms. Neely’s journals from that period. Immediately after the onset of the amnesia, she had written in stylized, quasi-childish block print, “… no member people/places man name [Mr. Neely] say my husband take me to emrgcey (sic) room…” The handwriting and spelling in the journal became more adult over a 3-year period. Overall, the totality of the data indicated a classic scenario of sudden loss of Ms. Neely’s entire autobiographical memory—an episode of generalized dissociative amnesia (GDA), not a cognitive disorder. GDA usually occurs when the person suffers massive stress or overwhelming conflicts (Kritchevsky, Chang, & Squire, 2004; Loewenstein, 2014; Staniloiu & Markowitsch, 2014; Staniloiu, Markowitsch, & Kordon, 2018). Usually, in DID, GDA results from the creation of a “new,” completely amnestic self-state, to attempt to totally forget the conflicts. The issues that lead to GDA are usually extreme, and often are associated with intense suicidal preoccupations. Thus, in GDA, the loss of personal history and identity frequently represents a symbolic suicide (Loewenstein et al., 2017; Staniloiu & Markowitsch, 2014). Successful suicide has been reported when too rapid therapeutic attempts have been made to lyse the GDA (Takahashi, 1988).\n\nThe next day, I met with Ms. Neely for approximately 8 h. Initially, she switched from the Doris state to the Anne state. In the Anne state, she described “listening to everything” that had been discussed. Many DID individuals describe self states that are aware of most or all of what is occurring, with better episodic memory than endorsed by other self states. As Anne, Ms. Neely stated directly that it would be important to discuss the witnessed fire-setting: “It’s good, positive, important…So that the courts will have all the information, we can move on with this, decisions will be made.” Then she switched seamlessly to Jeffrey, expressing uncertainty about the legal implications of discussing with me anything further about the fires. I suggested that Ms. Neely, as Jeffrey, call her attorney to discuss this, and arranged with the hospital staff to allow her to do so. As the Jeffrey state, Ms. Neely returned affirming that her attorney gave the go-ahead to talk about the fires.\n\nShe switched back to the Anne state. As Anne, she spoke evasively when queried about fire-setting and related activities, such as the past bomb threat, but circumstantially about her history of arrests, generally blaming other people, exculpating “Doris”. When I attempted to explore a history of fire-setting, Ms. Neely initially denied setting fires but then hinted that she “might” have set fires, but never “to hurt anybody.” She began to talk about a long-standing fantasy of murdering her parents by immolating them while they slept in their bedroom, making sure only they were in the house, and ensuring the fire was set in such a way to prevent their escape. She described it as a vivid image that had been in her mind since adolescence. She states that the violent Red state most intensely experienced this fantasy.\n\nAfter a break, Ms. Neely returned displaying the characteristics of the Doris state. Then she experienced a violent switch, with the emergence of an apparently male child state, self-identified as “Billy.” In a stammering, childlike voice, Ms. Neely described the morning of the fire-setting and a “struggle” between the Billy state and other states about doing something “bad.” She reported that, as Billy, while she was still in therapy with Ms. Brown, Ms. Neely would tell Ms. Brown about potential suicidal, self-destructive and dangerous behavior to get help with maintaining safety. Initially, the Billy state appeared to be referencing the account of following the man who reportedly raped her, with the idea of wreaking vengeance on him. As Billy, Ms. Neely continued to talk about an internal struggle about “taking care” of this man “who had hurt Anne” and that it was “wrong,” but “Red said will end the pain, will fix everything.” After talking for some time as Billie, Ms. Neely switched again.\n\nShe began to talk with a masculine voice similar to that of the Jeffrey state and self-identified as Red, saying, “I want to set the record straight.” As Red, Ms. Neely graphically described some of the sadistic sexual abuse reportedly experienced by Ms. Neely at the hands of her father, including his involving dogs in the abuse. She admitted to killing the dogs. “I knew enough to know it’s not right to kill the dog… it’s not the dog’s fault,” … but, “as long as it was on the property, he [father] was going to use it.” Eventually, as Red, she stated, “it’s gonna fuckin’ come out sooner or later. People will put the pieces together. Yes, I did go to this man’s house …” As Red, Ms. Neely first said that she had followed “a man who hurt us”—presumably the reported rapist.
