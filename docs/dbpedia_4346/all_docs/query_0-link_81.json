        "text": "Walmer Airfield Memorial April 1917- October 1918 WE PRAY YOU REMEMBER IN THE LORD THESE GALLANT AIRMEN WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN FRANCE AND WHO WERE STATIONED AT THIS AERODROME APRIL 1917 OCTOBER 1918 The above is the main inscription on the Walmer Airfield Memorial which was presented by Countess Beauchamp on Saturday 7 August 1920. In 1917 Walmer Airfield was opened at Hawkshill Common on the southern outskirts of Walmer, <strong>Kent</strong>, in the direction of the parish of Kingsdown. In some data sources it is sometimes referred to as Kingsdown Aerodrome. It was initially used by the Royal Naval Air Service, but when the Royal Air Force was formed on 1 April 1918 with the amalgamation of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps, it became a Royal Air Force Aerodrome and called R.A.F. Walmer. With the cessation of the hostilities it was closed after the Great War. In a different guise it was again put to use by the Royal Air Force for a number of years during the Second World War. The memorial was designed and executed by the Warham Guild of Marget Street, London, and the base, fencing and fixing were carried out by local builders Messrs. G.H. Denne and Son of Queen Street, Deal, <strong>Kent</strong>. The following extract was published in the East <strong>Kent</strong> Mercury:-\"The 1"
