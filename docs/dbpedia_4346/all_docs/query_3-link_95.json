It ranks above two-star air vice marshal and below four-star air chief marshal, and while it is the second-highest rank of a military branch in uniformed services distinct from navy and army, it is equivalent to Vice admiral of navy and lieutenant general of army. Promotion to the rank of air marshal requires a solid record of military achievement by an air vice marshal. However, the rank is also used for fighter pilots as a position advancement. A two-star military aviator with no history of violations and immorality are promoted to the three-star rank in air force.
