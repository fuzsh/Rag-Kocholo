        "text": "Applications are now being accepted for the following Open/Servicewide examinations. Applicants interested in testing for a servicewide classification may apply to take the examination with the state department listed, regardless of where the applicant currently works or wishes to obtain employment. Successful candidates from a servicewide eligible list will be available for hire by all participating state agencies.\n\nCut-Off Dates: Dates utilized when an examination bulletin is advertised as continuous-file (posted year-round). All applications submitted on or before the cut-off date are collected and evaluated against the minimum qualifications listed on the classification specification. Applications submitted after the most recent cut-off date will be held and evaluated once the next cut-off date arrives.\n\nFinal Filing Date: Date utilized when an examination bulletin is advertised as limited-file and is posted/accepting applications for a limited period of time (typically 4-weeks). Candidates must apply on or before the final filing date in order to be considered for the examination. Late applications are not accepted or retained so candidates that miss the deadline must wait to apply during a future filing period.\n\nAviation Officer II (Flight Operations)\n\nFinal Filing Date: 09/03/2024\n\nAviation Officer III (Flight Operations)\n\nFinal Filing Date: 09/03/2024\n\nCommunications Operator\n\nCut-Off Date: 09/30/2024\n\nCommunications Supervisor - Communications Supervisor Fact Sheet\n\nCut-Off Date: 11/01/2024\n\nCook Specialist I\n\nCut-Off Date: 10/11/2024\n\nCook Specialist II\n\nCut-Off Date: 10/11/2024\n\nDirect Construction Supervisor I\n\nFinal Filling Date: 06/06/2025\n\nDirect Construction Supervisor II\n\nFinal Filing Date: 06/06/2025\n\nFire Apparatus Engineer (Paramedic)\n\nFinal Filing Date: 09/06/2024\n\nFire Fighter II (Paramedic)Cut-Off Date: 10/30/2024\n\nForestry Logistics Officer I\n\nFinal Filing Date: 09/05/2024\n\nGraphic Designer I\n\nCut-Off Date: 10/30/2024\n\nGraphic Designer III\n\nCut-Off Date: 09/12/2024\n\nGunsmith\n\nFinal Filing Date: Until Filled\n\nLead Gunsmith\n\nFinal Filing Date: Until Filled\n\nSupervising Cook I\n\nCut-Off Date: 08/31/2024\n\nSupervising Cook II\n\nCut-off Date: 08/31/2024"
