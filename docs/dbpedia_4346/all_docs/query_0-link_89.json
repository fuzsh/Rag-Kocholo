        "text": "One of the noted denouements of stress is the causation of accidents, dangerous occurrences and near misses. In construction, stress has been noted to be on the rise due to several antecedents such as; ambitious deadlines, workload, role conflict, poor communication, and dangerous working environments. This study therefore sought to empirically establish the contribution of organizational stressors, job- related stressors and work environment stressors to the occurrence of construction site accidents, dangerous occurrences and near misses. Data for the study was obtained from a questionnaire survey of 204 construction site workers in Ghana. Structural Equation Modelling was the foremost technique employed in analysing data from the survey. Data on construction related stressors showed ambitious deadlines, low salary and working in dangerous environment to be the stressors causing the most stress on construction workers in Ghana. The overall contribution of stressors to accident occurrence, dangerous occurrences and near misses achieved was 0.968 (96.8%) which denotes a very high contribution. Results from the Structural Equation Model (SEM) also showed workload to be the stressor contributing the most (79%) to accidents, dangerous occurrences and near misses occurring on construction sites. The study provides a powerful insight into the failings of construction site safety measures. It empirically points to the soft side of the problem. Data for the study was collected largely from sites with less labour- intensive work and also highly skewed towards the male gender. This therefore may limit the number and type of stressors identified and used in the study. For better results, construction site health and safety officers will need to collaborate more closely with project managers to ensure stress is better managed on site since these are high contributors to incidents on site that have the potential to cause harm and/or damage.\n\nThis study was conducted to investigate how the work environment and psychological state influence construction workers’ perceptions and safety behaviors. Structural equation modeling was developed with five factors on the working environment (i.e., job demand, job control, job support, rewards, organizational justice, lack of reward), two factors on workers’ psychological condition (i.e., depression and trait anxiety), and four factors on safety perception (i.e., safety motivation, safety knowledge, and safety compliance and participation behaviors). Sample data were collected from 399 construction workers working at 29 construction sites in South Korea and analyzed the direct and indirect effects between those factors. The results showed that construction workers’ safety compliance and participation behavior are related to their safety knowledge and motivation, and depression and trait anxiety were found to lower safety motivation, knowledge, and, eventually, safety behavior. Job ...\n\nPsychological factors are very important in the perception of personal safety of workers in the construction industry. This study was carried out to examine the effects of psychological factors on the perception of personal safety in the construction industry in Pakistan. A questionnaire-type survey was designed based on existing studies and was tailored to the culture and environment of the construction industry in Pakistan. Data were collected from 124 workers from different trades at seven construction sites in Pakistan. A hypothetical structural model was developed based on psychological factors that could affect worker perception of safety. In the hypothetical structural model, five psychological factors were studied: (1) workload, (2) organizational relationships, (3) mental stress, (4) job satisfaction, and (5) job security. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypothetical model. The results of this study confirmed that psychological factors have direct an...\n\nThe construction industry is one of the most at risk to worker safety. The number of work accidents in Indonesia continues to increase so that by 2021 the number of work accidents will reach 234,270 cases. Therefore, in-depth research is needed to maintain the safety of all workers. Recognizing the factors that cause work accidents helps stakeholders take preventive action. It is necessary to increase worker safety behaviour by identifying its factors. Both those that occur in casual workers and permanent workers. Therefore, it is important to see whether employment status affects the safety behaviour of construction workers so that preventive measures can be taken as a form of prevention of work accidents. The research objective was to analyze the status of workers on the safety behaviour of construction workers. Data was collected through a survey method of 300 construction workers in the cities of Surabaya, Malang, and Batu in East Java, Indonesia. The results of the study show t...\n\nThe safety of construction workers is always a major concern at construction sites as the construction industry is inherently dangerous with many factors influencing worker safety. Several studies concluded that psychological factors such as workload, organizational relationships, mental stress, job security, and job satisfaction have significant effects on workers’ safety. However, research on psychological factors that are characteristic of different age groups have been limited. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of psychological factors on the perception of worker safety for two different age groups. After an extensive literature review, different psychological factors were identified, and a hypothetical research model was developed based on psychological factors that could affect workers’ perception of safety. A survey instrument was developed, and data were collected from seven different construction sites in Pakistan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employ...\n\nThis study analyzed the factors of the Occupational Health and Work Safety (OHS) implementation and Risk Management (RM) implementation that affect the performance of site construction workers. It also examined the mediation role of RM between OHS and site construction workers' performance. A quantitative [1] survey method of self-distributing questionnaires was employed using simple random sampling of 600 site construction workers on a site-widening project in Jordan, with a 99% response rate. The results of the questionnaire [1] were used and analyzed for the validity test, reliability, f-test, and t-test for each item of statement. The method of analysis [1] used for testing the hypothesis is Partial Least Square-Structure Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) which utilized AMOS for the descriptive analysis test results. The results of this study show that the Work Safety (WS) variable was the most dominant element as there are 82% of health and safety devices in my workplace. However, in case of any [1] accident on the construction site, there was 81% of the practical result of the Occupational Health variable which was Emergency treatment. The dominant result was Workers [7] for the RM variable assigned for likely hazardous or serious tasks, which was 87% and controlled regularly by the internal audits for testing if they follow the set of procedures and instructions for the safety and health of the workers in my organization. The results of PLS-SEM concluded that the [0] implementation of OHS and RM had a positive and significant effect on the performance of site construction workers. Moreover, the RM plays a partial mediation role between Site Construction Workers' Performance and OHS. [1] The findings show that the application of OHS in the construction projects affects the achievement of the company's work.\n\nThe administration of Health and Safety is an issue that is significant and pivotal to all organizations across all businesses worldwide. This integrates conventional and commercial businesses, data innovation (IT), care homes, schools, higher instructive teaching, travel and relaxation among others. The construction industry in the nation has always suffered due to hazardous working conditions. Occupational Health and safety is specifically significant and vital for the construction industry. The construction industry has a global reputation for the quality of work but, however, remains one of the most dangerous industries within the country. Contractors, subcontractors and their workforce quite frequently face varied risks from hazards which could result in injuries, other illnesses and even deaths in severe instances. This study investigated occupational health and safety on selected construction sites in the Sunyani Municipality in Ghana. Three different sets of questionnaires were distributed to and interviews conducted for consultants, contractors and construction workers in the Building Construction Industry. The focus of the interviews and questionnaires included accident origins, health and safety policy and management, factors affecting health and safety and reporting schedules. The results indicated that the factors responsible for most accidents on construction sites are workforce situations and management operations. It was also revealed that lack of PPE's, technical guidance, training, safety knowledge and fatigue could seriously affect health and safety on construction sites either as one or in combination. The study recommended the enforcement of safety protocols on all construction sites and a progressively consistent and sustainable health and safety educational campaign programmes to enhance awareness of the negative implications of lack of health and safety procedures on site."
