        "text": "SQZ Biotech's story has ended, and here's my prediction on how they'll be remembered. I was there near the beginning, having met the company during its participation in MassChallenge and having a few casual conversations about their earliest designs. You probably know the rest of the story: - IPO in 2020 - market cap as high as around $750M in 2021 - final asset sale last week at just $11.8M. There are measures by which some are labeling SQZ as a colossal failure, citing lost investment (primarily among common shareholders) and a lot of lost jobs. I find such perspectives perplexing and, frankly, foolhardy. Would I prefer that SQZ were a huge success, that it returned huge profits for all its stockholders, and that it continued to employ hundreds of talented people? Yes, absolutely. However, the fact that it didn't end this way ignores all the value it achieved along the way. First and foremost, SQZ made enormous contributions to cell therapy, a field that is still growing. I predict we'll see numerous future breakthroughs attributed at least in part to things learned at, or as a result of, SQZ. The company also developed the careers of a lot of folks. Do you think we've heard the last from former CEO Armon Sharei, PhD? I predict he'll be back with something even better. Dozens of other professionals at SQZ also learned a lot about building a business. I salute SQZ Biotech and its team. It didn't end the way anybody wanted, but the journey was still amazingly valuable and productive. #sqz #lostjob #shareholder #jobs #celltherapy\n\nMaria Khorsand turned Careium’s numbers around in just six months When Maria Khorsand joined Careium as Executive Interim CEO in 2022, her assignment was to lead a turnaround. In just six months, Maria, together with her team, managed to drastically turn the company’s numbers around. Q4 2022 exceeded expectations and the stock raised over 50%. Turning around a company’s sensitive financial numbers usually involves introducing an rational cost-saving package while simultaneously growing the business in a distressed situation, which requires strong leadership and a solid team. “It’s important that everyone is on board and understands that together we create change and stability and that all individuals are important. The management team worked out a cost-saving package that we implemented immediately while we grew our business significantly. I had many one-to-one conversations to drive us forward with collective power, where we are headed. It’s impossible to succeed with a major change if you don’t communicate transparently, clearly, and regularly. Since Careium is listed on the stock exchange, I couldn’t tell everything, but it was important that everyone felt safe and proud”, says Maria. Trivia: At Ericsson, Maria was CEO of their Bluetooth company (Ericsson Technology Licensing), which was the first in the world to develop Bluetooth technology for wirelessly connecting different digital devices. Together with one of their customers, a computer manufacturer, the new technology was to be marketed. Maria had previously given a book to the customer, namely “Röde Orm” by Frans G Bengtsson. In the book, there is a character named Harald Bluetooth – which inspired the technology we now call Bluetooth. #interimmanagement #turnaround #changeleadership\n\nIntroducing the visionaries behind Axmed: Meet Felix Ohnmacht, Ph.D., the fervent co-founder at the heart of Axmed's mission. But who are the individuals behind this innovative venture, and what motivated them to embark on this journey? \"It’s a story of good fortune and freedom, really,\" Felix says. For him, the decision to start Axmed was rooted in a deep, lifelong appreciation for the ingenuity and resilience of people in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Already in his childhood, Felix explains, he was captivated by communities rich in human-centered values and a knack for experimentation. Inspired by great leaders and mentors in LMICs, he harbored a dream of leveraging his skills to create outsized impact, to meaningfully transform healthcare for those in need through social business. \"That company didn't exist, at least not how I imagined it, so we created it,\" Felix says. When the three co-founders decided to establish Axmed, it wasn't merely about identifying gaps in healthcare delivery; it was about recognizing and supporting the tremendous potential for innovative, sustainable solutions to emerge from within LMICs. It was about transcending short-term interests to increase the accessibility and affordability of medicines, with a strong commercial backbone. \"As a technology company, we can push scalability that fundamentally levels the economic playing field and enables real competition on real opportunities,\" Felix explains. \"That's what healthcare needs today, and it has the potential to relieve millions from health challenges so they can enjoy more freedom to thrive.\" Felix' vision for Axmed is ambitious yet simple: to establish a beacon of change – a new kind of company exemplifying that prioritizing the patient and the public is key to building a thriving business. \"Axmed is not just a platform; it's a movement,\" he declares. \"I believe real leadership starts when human beings are in service of others, and the same applies for companies, too. This is where I see Axmed - not just as the world's leading medicines marketplace, but as a trailblazer in ethical business practices and social leadership. In the next weeks, we will introduce Co-Founders Emmanuel Akpakwu and Sofía Radley-Searle - if you have any questions for them about Axmed, simply leave a comment! #Leadership #AccessToMedicine #LeadershipJourney\n\nLast month, we added JENTIS, an advanced server-side web tracking and privacy technologies, to our portfolio, in a Series A funding round. The €11 million round was led by Bright Pixel (former Sonae IM) and included the participation of new co-investor 3TS Capital Partners and existing investor Pragmatech. Now more than ever, control and ownership of data is increasingly critical, and Jentis enables organisations to seamlessly adapt to this evolving landscape, giving them a competitive edge in data management and holistic business insights across channels and devices. The funds raised in this round will be instrumental in driving product development and accelerating Jentis' market expansion. Leonor de L'Hermite (she/her), our Operating Partner, expressed her excitement: \"We are thrilled to be part of the journey to make it much easier for companies to achieve data-driven growth while solving privacy of their users\".
