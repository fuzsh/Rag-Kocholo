        "text": "The present special issue of Studies in Communication Sciences originates from the conference “Argumentation in Dialogic Interaction”, which was held in Lugano on July 1-4 2002. The conference, hosted by the Faculty of Communication Sciences of the University of Lugano, was jointly organized by three scholarly associations: the International Society for the Study of Argumentation (ISSA), the International Association for Dialogue Analysis (IADA), and the International Association for the Study of Controversies (IASC). The conference’s chief aim was to explore the relationships between the objects of study of these three associations, as well as the differences and complementarities in the approaches adopted by the different research traditions these associations represent. We can say that the conference was a remarkable success, not only regarding the number of attendants and the quantity and quality of paper presented, but also for the quality of the scientific dialogues (arguments...\n\nArgumentation has a broad, multidisciplinary scope. Being a point of overlap of diverse spheres of knowledge and sciences makes the study of argumentation so complex an enterprise, which still seeks to determine in precise terms what its object is and how it should be addressed. This paper is meant to offer a concise overview of argumentation and its various approaches. Focus is laid on the fundamental concepts that bear some relevance to the study of argumentation. Further, attempt is made to draw a sketch of its history and an outline of its modern theoretical distinctions. L'argumentation a une portée large et multidisciplinaire. Le fait d'être un point de chevauchement de différentes sphères de connaissance et des multiple sciences rend l'étude de l'argumentation une entreprise si complexe, qui cherche encore à déterminer en termes précis ce que porte son objet et comment il devrait être abordée. Cet article vise à offrir un aperçu concis de l'argumentation et de ses différentes approches. L'accent est mis sur les concepts fondamentaux qui portent un certain intérêt pour l'étude de l'argumentation. En outre, une tentative est faite pour dessiner une esquisse de son histoire et un aperçu de ses distinctions théoriques modernes.\n\n1 This distinctive feature is at the same time an important cognitive capacity and a powerful social phenomenon. It has attracted attention and careful analysis since the dawn of civilization, being intimately related to the origin of any form of social organization, from political debates to law, and of structured thinking, from philosophy to science and arts. As a cognitive capacity, argumentation is important for handling conflicting beliefs, assumptions, viewpoints, opinions, goals, and many other kinds of mental attitudes. When we are faced with a situation where we find that our information is incomplete or inconsistent, we often resort to the use of arguments in favor and against a given position in order to make sense of the situation. When we interact with other people we often exchange arguments in a cooperative or competitive fashion to reach a final agreement or to defend and promote an individual position. Articles"
