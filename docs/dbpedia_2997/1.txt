What happened on June 6, 1944

On June 6, 1944, known as D-Day, a pivotal moment of World War II occurred when 155,000 Allied troops embarked from England and landed on the beaches of Normandy in northern France. This massive operation, named Operation Overlord, marked the beginning of the Invasion of Normandy. It was aimed at breaching the formidable defenses known as the Atlantic Wall, which Nazi Germany had constructed along the coast of occupied Europe. The operation stands as the largest amphibious military operation in history, involving an unprecedented coordination of naval, air, and land forces. The Allies, comprising forces from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and other nations, faced intense German resistance. Despite this, they managed to establish a beachhead and rapidly push inland, initiating a series of battles that would eventually lead to the liberation of Paris and much of France.
