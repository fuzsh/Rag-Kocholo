The first system developed, the PIH-EMR, currently supports the management and monitoring of more than 6,500 patients in treatment for MDR TB in Peru and 1,000 patients in the Philippines. Dr. Fraser also led the development of the HIV-EMR, which is used to support the treatment of HIV patients in rural Haiti. Both of these systems include data analysis tools, as well as components that track the current use of medication and predict future medication needs. The EMR systems used by Partners In Health were designed as part of an international collaboration to develop flexible, open-source medical record systems in developing countries. The first version of this OpenMRS system, of which Dr. Fraser is a co-founder, went live in February 2006 in Kenya and in August 2006 in Rwanda. OpenMRS is now also used to support the Partners In Health projects in Lesotho and Malawi and will soon be used to support MDR TB care in Haiti.\n\nGerald Friedland, M.D., is Director of the AIDS Program at Yale New Haven Hospital and Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology and Public Health at Yale School of Medicine. He is a former member of the Governing Council of the International AIDS Society, National Advisory Council, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Advisory Council, Office of AIDS Research, and currently serves on the WHO HIV/TB Working Group and as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York City. Dr. Friedland has been directly involved in the development of comprehensive HIV care programs since the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981. His work was initially in the Bronx, New York, and has continued since 1991 in New Haven, Connecticut. He has developed and directed large-scale clinical and epidemiologic studies among vulnerable populations with and at risk for HIV disease. His group presented the first convincing evidence of lack of transmission of HIV by close personal contact, and defined the predictors of HIV transmission and natural history of HIV disease among injection drug users and the risk of reactivation of TB among those coinfected with HIV. More recently, Dr. Friedland has worked on clinical trials of antiretroviral therapies. He is currently Principal Investigator of New England ProACT, a regional\n\nAIDS clinical trials network specializing in antiretroviral therapy trials. In this work he has focused on recruitment, enrollment, retention, and special issues with respect to HIV therapeutics among injection drug users and other marginalized populations, including the definition of pharmacokinetic drug interactions between HIV and substance abuse therapies. Dr. Friedland’s research also has focused on studies at the interface of biology, clinical care, and behavior, including adherence to HIV therapies and the integration of prevention strategies and clinical care, notably in the development and testing of interventions to reduce the risk of HIV transmission among HIV-positive persons in clinical care. Dr. Friedland is also actively involved in HIV/AIDS international research aimed at providing access to antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings. The major focus of this work is the integration of HIV and TB care and treatment in coinfected patients, with the aim of improving diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for both diseases. This work has led to the discovery of XDR TB as a major cause of death among HIV/TB coinfected patients in South Africa and now focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and reduction of transmission of MDR and XDR TB in HIV coinfected patients. Dr. Friedland directs and participates in several research projects addressing these issues in rural and urban South Africa, supported by charitable research foundations and NIH. He is a Visiting Professor at the Nelson R.

Moe, Ph.D., Executive in Residence, joined the Health Sector Management program, Fuqua School of Business, in 2001. His research interests include new incentives for innovation in neglected tropical and infectious disease research, private-sector responses to the global health care worker shortage, and the use of business intelligence as a basis for competitive advantage among life sciences firms. Dr. Moe is co-author of “Developing Drugs for Developing Countries” (Health Affairs, March/ April 2006), which led to the Sec. 524 amendment in the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. The article recommended, and the legislation now establishes in law, a new incentive for neglected tropical disease medicines: the priority review voucher (PRV). A PRV is awarded for U.S. registration of a new medicine (new chemical, biologic, or diagnostic) for a tropical disease (one of 16 diseases, including TB and malaria), termed the “tropical drug.” The holder exercises the voucher by receiving priority review of a second drug, the “voucher drug,” for FDA approval to market to U.S. patients. The FDA issued its guidance in October 2008 to administer the new voucher program, and the first tropical drug applications for the program were submitted beginning September 28, 2008. Dr. Moe is Chief Executive Officer of the Institute for Global Disease Medicines, Inc. (IGDM). IGDM utilizes a proprietary proteome capture discovery technology that combines focused chemical libraries with parallel affinity capture screens. The drug discovery engine enables new drug candidates to be identified in large combinatorial chemical libraries en masse and rapidly progressed to Phase I clinical trials through directed iterative chemistry. The platform first identifies the use of drug candidates that are preselected based on such criteria as solubility profile, likely pharmacokinetic profile, ability to be derivated, and distinctiveness relative to known compounds. IGDM is structured as a not-for-profit/for-profit hybrid business model and will become a self-sustaining biotechnology organization that is funded by philanthropic donations and grants. Its initial research program will focus on malaria and cancer. Dr. Moe is Director, Private Sector Task Force (TF), which operates under the aegis of the Global Health Workforce Alliance (managed by WHO). The TF identifies and promotes the expansion of private-sector initiatives that are increasing the supply, effectiveness, and retention of health care workers. Dr. Moe leads the research and administration of the Technical Working Group, which carries out analysis, interventions, and evaluation for the TF. The TF is using an innovative social/business “incubator” approach to increase the\n\nscaling and cross-border movement of effective private-sector responses to the worker shortage. Before coming to Duke, Dr. Moe was an executive at GlaxoSmithKline. During a 15-year career he held positions in business development, corporate strategy, marketing, market economics, and human resources.
