He now works with an extensive network of collaborators in several countries to identify vaccine candidates and develop new diagnostic tools to improve the control of neglected tropical diseases, with particular focus on leprosy and leishmaniasis.\n\nMalcolm is currently an Affiliate Assistant Professor, Department of Global Health, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle; a Visiting Professor to the CAPES-Fiocruz/CDTS long-term collaboration program in Brazil; and a Foreign Expert Consultant to Center for Major Infectious Disease, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. Malcolm serves as a member of the Editorial Boards of Infection and Immunity (2012-17) and Journal of Advances in Diseases Diagnosis (2014-) and is a member of the American Association of Immunologists, American Society for Microbiology and American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and British Society for Immunology.\n\nDAVID ROBERTS, PHD\n\nScientific Operations Manager\n\nDavid Roberts is the Scientific Operations Manager for the Tuberculosis Discovery Research Group and is the Biological Safety Officer for IDRI. His work includes management of the BioSafety Level 2 and 3 laboratories, including training personnel.\n\nOriginally from Kenbridge, VA, David obtained his BSc in Biology from Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. He then went on to perform his graduate studies on the mechanisms of pathogenesis of Borrelia spp. causing Lyme disease in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Medical College of Virginia under the supervision of Dr. Richard Marconi. David came to the Northwest and performed his postdoctoral studies under David Sherman at the University of Washington, where he learned the ins-and-outs of Mycobacterium tuberculosisbiology and pathogenesis.\n\nMATTHEW MCNEIL, PHD\n\nPostdoctoral Scientist\n\nMatthew is a Postdoctoral Scientist in the TB Discovery Research group at IDRI. By isolating drug resistant bacteria, Matthew’s work focuses on the identification and characterization of drug targets and mechanisms of drug resistance.\n\nMatthew received his BSc in Genetics and PhD in Microbiology from the University of Otago, New Zealand. His graduate work with Dr. Peter Fineran focused on microbial metabolism. Prior to Joining IDRI, Matthew worked at the Institut de Biologie Integrative de la Cellule, France with Dr. Frederic Boccard applying super resolution microscopy to study the temporal and spatial localization of proteins involved in bacterial chromosome organization.\n\nSAMUEL NJIKAN, PHD\n\nPostdoctoral Scientist\n\nSamuel Njikan is a Postdoctoral Scientist at IDRI. His main work focuses on developing an artificial lymph node system for the assessment of responses to human vaccines. In addition, Samuel also investigates the direct effect of adjuvant treated macrophages on the growth inhibition of disease causing pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, West Nile Virus, Leishmania and Influenza virus.\n\nSamuel obtained a Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Sciences (BMLS) from the University of Buea in Cameroon. He then moved to Cape Town, South Africa where he obtained a Master of Science in medicine in the field of hematology and a PhD in clinical science and immunology all from the University of Cape Town. His PhD thesis with Prof. Willem Hanekom aimed at identifying correlates of risk of TB disease in infants with differential response to BCG vaccination.\n\nGAURI SHETYE, PHD\n\nPostdoctoral Scientist\n\nGauri Shetye is a Postdoctoral Scientist in the TB Discovery Research group at IDRI. Gauri's work focuses on identifying new drug targets against tuberculosis and understanding the mode of action against such targets.\n\nGauri received her BSc and MSc in Chemistry from University of Mumbai and her PhD in Chemistry from Syracuse University. In her PhD study under professor Yan-Yeung Luk, Gauri deployed small molecules for modulating the multicellular behaviors of bacteria like biofilm formation and swarming motility. She also investigated the mode of action for such small molecules in controlling bacterial behaviors.\n\nEDISON S. ZUNIGA, PHD\n\nPostdoctoral Scientist\n\nEdison S. Zuniga is a Postdoctoral Chemist in the Tuberculosis Drug Discovery Group. His work is focused on the elucidation of drug targets and modes of action, as well as the synthesis and discovery of novel biologically active compounds that work against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\nEdison has expertise in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. He received a BS in chemistry and a BA in English from the University of Washington and his PhD in organic chemistry at Stony Brook University. Under the supervision of Distinguished Professor Iwao Ojima, his graduate research focused on the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel taxoids and taxoid-based drug conjugates. While working in the Ojima lab, he also studied cancer stem cell biology with Dr. Galina Botchkina.\n\nJill Ashman, MS\n\nDirector, Clinical Operations\n\nJill has worked in the field of international health and development, infectious diseases and clinical trials for over 40 years. After working as a bench scientist in clinical chemistry she joined the Voluntary Services Overseas and worked in Latin America as a professor of biology and biochemistry and on UNICEF field studies. Jill was the co-founder of Agrosalud, a non-profit health care program in rural Guatemala and collaborated with the University of Miami Field Epidemiology Survey Team on projects in the San Blas archipelago in Panamá, including cholera intervention, scabies and head lice studies. After working more than a decade in the field of HIV and AIDS, coordinating HIV vaccine trials at SCHARP, she joined IDRI in 2003 to set up and manage clinical vaccine trials.\n\nJill earned a BSc first class Honours degree in Zoology from the University of St. Andrews and a MS in Epidemiology from the University of Washington.\n\nZachary Sawaga, MS\n\nManager, Regulatory\n\nZack is IDRI’s Regulatory Manager, part of the team that enables moving IDRI’s vaccines from the lab into human clinical trials. He is responsible for regulatory submissions and all other interactions with regulatory authorities around the world. He provides support to clinical development and operations efforts, including writing and editing funding proposals, protocols, informed consent forms, and many other types of clinical trial documentation. He also oversees the design and execution of GLP toxicity studies, a critical final step before IDRI’s vaccines can be tested for safety and efficacy in humans.\n\nZack has an M.S. in Biomedical Regulatory Affairs from the University of Washington. His background is in biological science research, having completed an M.S. in Biology from the Rockefeller University and several years’ experience as a Research Scientist in academia. He graduated with a B.S. in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Washington, where he was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Research Fellow."
