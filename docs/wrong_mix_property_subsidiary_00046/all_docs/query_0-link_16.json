        "text": "Radioimmunotherapy with radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibodies is a promising new treatment approach for low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, the administration of radiolabeled antibodies presents some added complexity. At the University of Nebraska Medical Center (Omaha, NE), an institutional model has been developed that ensures the efficient and safe delivery of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab (Bexxar; Corixa Corp, South San Francisco, CA and GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, PA). An integrated, multidisciplinary treatment team is responsible for managing all aspects of treatment. Using this model, it is possible to administer tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab safely and effectively in the outpatient setting. Patients can usually be released immediately after treatment. Guidelines and instructions for patient release have been developed and validated and are provided herein. These instructions ensure that radiation exposure of family members and caregivers who are exposed to the patient is maintained as low as reasonably achievable and well within regulatory limits.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Establishing an institutional model for the administration of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab\n\nAU - Hohenstein, Maribeth A.\n\nAU - Augustine, Samuel C.\n\nAU - Rutar, Frank\n\nAU - Vose, Julie M.\n\nN1 - Funding Information: Maribeth Hohenstein and Sam Augustine have received honoraria from Corixa.
