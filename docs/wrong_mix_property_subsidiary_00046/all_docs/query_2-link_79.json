The subcommittee met at 9 a.m., in room SD-106, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter (chairman) presiding. Present: Senators Specter, Cochran, DeWine, Harkin, and Murray. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER Senator Specter. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's 9 o'clock, and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education will now proceed. We have a hearing of unusual importance in a subcommittee which characteristically has hearings of very great importance, but this tops the list of any in recent times. We are looking at a very substantial appropriation to meet the imminent threat of a pandemic flu. I had the opportunity to hear the President's speech yesterday at the National Institutes of Health, and the President really laid it on the line with the potential problems, which are enormous. Last week, when we had full Senate consideration of the appropriations bill, Senator Harkin took the lead, having spotted this problem some substantial time ago, and we worked through a very substantial add-on to our appropriations bill, in the amount of $7,975,000,000. We carefully fenced the money so that the expenditures would be at the discretion of the President and his very able team, many of whom are assembled here this morning. But we did not want to face a situation where Congress adjourned and then the program came forward. We will be looking, perhaps in late November, at a supplemental with the Congress out of session. Supplemental appropriation bills are extraordinarily difficult. They become what we call Christmas trees for many, many other items, so that if we can appropriate for it in due course, which we are moving ahead on, that's the way to handle it. The President has come in with a figure of $6,660,000,000. We have the defense appropriation bill, which has $3,913,000,000. We have an amendment offered by Senator Frist, the majority leader, to the reconciliation bill for $3.954 billion, slightly under $4 billion. So, we're talking about a great many figures, and we're going to--we're going to work them out. That's under 3 minutes, and now I want to save time for our witnesses, and I yield to my distinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin. STATEMENT OF SENATOR TOM HARKIN Senator Harkin. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to join with you in welcoming our Secretary and Dr. Gerberding, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Gellin, Dr. Raub here to this very important hearing this morning. I, first, want to salute the President for coming forward with a plan to prepare our country for avian flu. It is long overdue. We are behind. I--that's not to say that--to blame anyone, other than all of us. We've--all, I think, shoulder a little bit of the blame for not coming forward a long time ago. So, I'm not pointing at any one person. I'm just saying that we've all, sort of, kind of, put this off and put this off, until finally it's staring us in the face. I might exempt from that people who--like Dr. Gerberding and others at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who have been warning us about this for some time, and her predecessor there, Dr. Copland, Dr. Fauci and others at the National Institute of Health, who have been warning us about the lack of the research we needed for vaccines, and others in the past. But I think we all share a little bit of responsibility for not coming forward with something before now. I also want to say, I thought the President's tone was correct yesterday. His tone was correct. I listened very carefully as he sounded the alarm but drew the curtain on panic. We need to have the alarm sounded, but we don't need to have people panic. I thought his tone was absolutely correct in the way he outlined it yesterday. So, now we have a plan from the administration, we have an appropriation here of about $8 billion. Again, this was a bipartisan effort. Senator Specter said--was giving me a lot of undue compliments for that. Actually, Senator Specter has been the lead in this for a long time. We've worked very jointly together. Actually, nothing really happens around here unless we, kind of, have all worked together on this thing. We worked together on this amendment last week, as we did on the one before, on the defense appropriations bill, to try to come up with, you know, What is it that we need? What are the parameters? What do we need to focus on? Quite frankly, I was pleased, but maybe not too surprised, that the President's plan very closely tracked the one that we had offered 1 week ago. I got to thinking about it, and I thought, well, of course; we're all talking to the same people. We're talking to the Secretary, we're talking to NIH, we're talking to CDC, and we're talking to the drug companies. So, we all, kind of, have the same inputs on this. So, they are very closely aligned. There is only one or two elements that I would like to discuss with you this morning. One is just on State and local preparedness, where I think we have focused a little bit more here than the President has. I think we need to talk about that, because with the buildup of vaccines, the stockpiling of anti-virals and stuff, if we don't have the public health infrastructure out there to educate people, to handle the stockpiles, to deliver the medicines, then it doesn't do much good we have all these stockpiles. So, that's the one area where I think there's a slight difference between our approach and what the administration has asked. But, that said, that's about it. I think we're going to have to, kind of, just focus on that a little bit and get those straightened out. Last, I would just hope that this remains as an emergency. I was informed this morning by the Secretary that--it's something I missed yesterday--that the President had asked for this as an emergency. That's the way we put it in our appropriations bill. I hope that the House will acquiesce in that and not try to get into some battle over offsets and things like this. This is a true emergency, and it ought to be handled as such. Last, this is the proper place for this, in the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations Subcommittee of the full Appropriations Committee. I, again, thank my chairman, Senator Specter, for taking the lead on this, as he has on so many other events and things that deal with the health of the American people. With that, Senator Specter, thank you very much. Senator Specter. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Senator Harkin. We're pleased to have with us the chairman of the full committee, who's also, in addition, a member of this subcommittee. Senator Cochran, would you care to make an opening statement? STATEMENT OF SENATOR THAD COCHRAN Senator Cochran. Mr. Chairman, thank you for convening this hearing. We appreciate your leadership and the leadership of the President in this effort to protect the public health of our country. The President has submitted a comprehensive proposal to defend against, and to prepare the Nation for, pandemic influenza. It will require our best efforts. This includes the Congress, our Nation's research facilities, and the capacity of our public health officials and private industry all working together to help ensure that we protect the public health of our country. We thank the witnesses. We appreciate the time and effort you have put into this effort to this point, and your willingness to come discuss the details of the proposal and funding needs for successfully defending against pandemic influenza. I thank you very much. Senator Specter. Thank you very much, Senator Cochran. Senator Murray, would you care to make an opening statement? Senator Murray. I would. STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATTY MURRAY Senator Murray. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for calling this really critical hearing. I think that we all recognize that a flu pandemic is a major public health threat, and we can't afford to play catch-up after a major outbreak. Yesterday, we did see the President unveil his new national strategy, and I think it's important to hear now from the administration about how we plan to carry this out. But it's also really important to find out how we responsibly pay for this $7.1 billion effort. Yesterday, the President indicated, as Senator Harkin just mentioned, that it would be funded through emergency spending. I agree that a flu pandemic is an emergency, and it meets the requirements of an emergency demonstration. I hope the administration doesn't make the same mistake it made last week in its latest Katrina package, something we all considered an emergency, where the administration proposed $2.3 billion in cuts to pay for part of that Katrina package. I don't understand, frankly, how something is an emergency one day and then requires corresponding budget cuts the next day. So, I hope there is no attempt to offset this flu pandemic package with cuts to other programs. Some of my colleagues may be inclined to take the money away from other health programs to pay for this plan, but that would create a lot more problems and more funding shortfalls. We can't forget with this that it's the local hospital, the local community clinic, and the local emergency room staff who are going to the--on the front lines of any outbreak. So, if we cut other funding from our public health infrastructure to fund this new strategy, we're going to make it even harder for those on the front lines to respond effectively. So, I would just encourage my colleagues to remember that cutting our public health infrastructure to fund this new strategy is going to create problems and dangers when local communities are required to respond to any outbreak. We have a lot of work ahead to do to protect our citizens. We don't have a vaccine that's ready to be administered on a global scale, and that puts an even greater emphasis on giving our local public health officials the tool to diagnosis and contain any outbreak that may occur. So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much for holding this hearing. I appreciate the Secretary, CDC, and NIH for being here, and I look forward to your testimony. Thank you very much. Senator Specter. Thank you very much, Senator Murray. Secretary Leavitt is joined by part of his really outstanding team. We're pleased to have Dr. Julie Gerberding here, Director of CDC. When I wanted some spot information recently, she was available, in Bangkok, and--accompanying Secretary Leavitt on a trip there on the scene. Dr. Fauci is here today--does outstanding work as Director of the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases; and Dr. Bruce Gellin, Director of the National Vaccine Program Office; and Dr. Raub, Science Advisor to the Secretary. We appreciate all of your being here, because we may ask some questions which go beyond the testimony of Secretary Leavitt. Secretary Leavitt is the 20th Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. He's had a very distinguished record in public service--the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, elected Governor of the State of Utah on three occasions, served 11 years in that position, has a bachelor's degree in economics and business from Southern Utah University. Mr. Secretary, we appreciate the job you're doing. You've got your hands full, and we want to help. We won't have any clock running for Secretary Leavitt, unlike the clocks for the Senators. The floor is yours, Mr. Secretary. STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL O. LEAVITT, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ACCOMPANIED BY: DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DR. BRUCE GELLIN, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL VACCINE PROGRAM OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DR. JULIE GERBERDING, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DR. WILLIAM RAUB, SCIENCE ADVISOR TO THE SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Secretary Leavitt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll do my best not to abuse that privilege. I will summarize, briefly, so we can get on to questions. In my opening statement, I think it would be valuable for me to just frame the subject. Pandemics. The bottom line is, they happen. Ten times in the last 300 years, and three times in the last 100 years, viruses have mounted a massive pandemic assault that has made masses ill and caused millions to die. They happened before, they'll happen again, and we need to be prepared. Whenever there is a human-to-human transmission of a dangerous killer virus, there is risk everywhere in the world. Leadership, as Senator Harkin pointed out, right now is creating an atmosphere of information without inflaming. It is inspiring preparation and not panic. Our deliberate moving forward on this plan constitutes that action. The current worry, of course, is the H5N1 virus. It is primarily an animal disease right now. The probability of it making the transition to a human-to-human transmittable virus is unknown, uncertain, but the troubling signs are clearly there. The ramifications would be so significant, so world- changing, that we have no alternative but to prepare. But if it isn't the H5N1 virus, it will be another virus, as it has in past, because, in fact, pandemics do happen. As indicated yesterday, the President laid out a broad national strategy. He called upon Congress to appropriate the $7.1 billion that's been mentioned. Later today, or today-- simultaneous with this hearing, I will be laying out with more granularity the plan that HHS is putting forward on the medical and public health portion of it. It constitutes roughly $6.7 billion of the $7.1 billion. I'd like to take just a moment and describe, in broad outline, the nature of that plan. I've put a placard up that lists the six primary components. I'll review them briefly. The first is international surveillance. Many have compared a pandemic to a forest fire. If you're there when the spark happens that sets the fire off, you can mitigate its damage simply by snuffing it out. If it's allowed to burn, it will burn beyond containment very rapidly. In order to identify when the spark happens in a pandemic or a forest fire, you need good surveillance. In pandemics, good surveillance means laboratories, it means epidemic investigators, it means rapid- response teams, it means American experts on the ground in Southeast Asia and other countries where we can be of assistance to them, it means having a joint containment plan with our friends and neighbors around the world so that when the spark happens, if we can get there fast, we can contain it and save the world from the destruction it could bring. The second point is domestic surveillance. Just as in the international arena, if a pandemic virus reaches the shores of the United States, we need to know. We need to know fast, and we need to know that--with the most possible certainly, how broadly it has spread so that we can contain it. That, again, means laboratories, it means medical training for local providers, it means a good communication network. The third point on the plan is the foundation of this plan, which is vaccines. The good news is, we have a vaccine. The scientists at NIH have developed a vaccine that produces sufficient immune response that it can protect a human being when given at the proper dosage. The bad news is, we fundamentally lack the capacity to manufacture it in sufficient volumes in time. The plan lays out two broad objectives. The first is to develop 20 million courses of the closest vaccine possible, given our information today, and then the capacity to produce, within a 6-month time, up to 300 million courses of the appropriate vaccine once the virus has been detected and isolated. To do that, we'll undertake three major tasks. The first is to expand our egg-based vaccine production. The second is to develop new cell-based technology. The third is to test adjuvant technologies, which are dose-sparing technologies, allowing us to spread the limited vaccine that we have available further. In the long run, we would expect to see that 300 million courses that we could produce within a 6-month period break down roughly to 62,500,000 egg-based vaccines and roughly 237,500,000 cell-based vaccines. As we begin the development, we obviously need to have a great deal of flexibility in the way we approach it. We would see ourselves developing a strategy that would operate within four corners. The first is that these technologies need to be domestically produced. In a pandemic, it is a broad view that we will undoubtedly only have the vaccine we can produce on our shores. So, what we develop needs to be produced here. Second, we need to achieve the lowest-cost, highest-quality quotient. The third is that we need to have flexibility, the ability to move within the technologies. If one is working better than another, we need to be able to shift our capacity there. Fourth, we need to produce continuous annual flu benefit so that we're developing a public health asset in doing so. The fourth category that you'll note is anti-virals. I'd like to make an important point. Anti-virals are an important part of a comprehensive plan, but anti-virals are not the equivalent of preparation. There is no certainty of their effectiveness on any particular virus. There is no capacity to change the anti-viral if the virus adapts. There are distribution dilemmas. Nevertheless, it's a very important part of a comprehensive plan, and the plan does call for us to build a stockpile of 20 million courses. The vendors have represented to us that those could be delivered by the fourth quarter of 2006, and we could build our collective stockpiles to 81 million by the summer of 2007. Again, that's a date vendors are able to meet. We will focus on this as a locally deployable asset. Senator Harkin, you mentioned the fact that we need to work very closely with State and local officials. The timeframes involved in the deployment of anti-virals are crucial. I would like to point out that, in the anti-viral category, 400 million of it would be focused on the development of new and better anti-virals. We think that's an important part of a comprehensive plan, is the continual upgrading of our anti- viral arsenal. The fifth category is communication, informing the public with available information so that every community knows what to expect. We need to begin the development of these materials before a pandemic strikes. The last piece I would point out is State and local preparedness--again, something that Senator Harkin and Senator Specter both commented on. This is a unique kind of disaster. It is not like Katrina or Rita or any other hurricane, where we have a confined area of disaster. It is a disaster of unlimited distribution, with an unconfined time, and has to be managed locally. The President indicated, in his speech yesterday, the need for us to immediately begin working with State and local officials to develop readiness plans in every community. Last, I would just say, the budget that's been presented is in two major accounts: vaccine and anti-virals. The vaccine and anti-viral portion totals $4.7 billion, and the other public health efforts, roughly $500 million. In conclusion, I would like to just make this point. We don't know whether the H5N1 virus will be the spark that will set off a global pandemic. We do know that, at some point in time, a pandemic is likely to happen. History makes that very clear. There may be those, if H5N1 does not become the spark, that look back and say we overreacted, or there may be some who would say, ``Well, they cried wolf.'' But I would like to suggest that this is about long-term pandemic readiness, and that at the conclusion of this plan, there will be five things that will be true of this country that are not totally true today. The first is that we will have cell-based technology that will be the key to surging up the production of pandemic flu vaccines quickley and establish an enormous asset scientifically and in public health. The second is, we can make a giant step forward on our annual flu capacity to be able to protect the citizens of this country on a year-to-year basis. Third, our State and local governments will be better prepared, not just for pandemic, but for every kind of medical emergency. Fourth, we'll have an international network of surveillance that will protect not just citizens of the United States, but people around the world. PREPARED STATEMENT Last, we'll have the peace of mind of knowing that we are ready. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Michael O. Leavitt Good morning Senator Specter, Senator Harkin, and members of the Subcommittee. I am honored to be here today to present the President's request for funds for the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan, which is an integral component of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, which the President announced yesterday. In the event that an outbreak of pandemic flu hits our shores, it will surely have profound impacts on almost every sector of our society. Such an outbreak will require a coordinated response at all levels of government--Federal, State, and local--and it will require the participation of the private sector and each of us as individuals. HHS has been a leader in this effort, and today, with this budget request and the release of the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan, we are taking another major step forward to improve our preparedness and response capabilities. The threat of an outbreak of pandemic influenza is real. An influenza virus strain with potential to cause a pandemic of human disease could emerge with little or no warning and in almost any part of the world, as occurred 3 times during the 20th century. Influenza viruses infect birds, pigs, and other animals, as well as humans. The ability of these viruses to cross the species barrier from time to time creates the possibility for the appearance of new viral strains that have the potential to be highly infectious, readily transmissible, and highly lethal. If a pandemic virus strain emerges, it is estimated that upwards of 30 percent of people exposed could become infected and the death rate will likely be considerably higher than that seen with seasonal influenza. Faced with such a threat, the United States and its international partners will need to respond quickly and efficiently to reduce the scope and magnitude of this serious health threat. Today's threat is the H5N1 avian influenza strain, which is spreading widely and rapidly in domestic and migratory fowl in Asia and now in Eastern Europe. While the virus has not demonstrated the ability to spread efficiently from person to person, it has infected more than one hundred people in Asia and approximately 50 percent of these known cases have died. The virus is now endemic in many bird species and in several countries, so elimination is not feasible. The feared pandemic could become a reality if this virus mutates further, remains highly virulent, and acquires the capability to spread as efficiently from person to person as do the commonly circulating virus strains that produce seasonal influenza epidemics. But even if H5N1 does not lead to a pandemic, the likelihood of an influenza pandemic at some point remains high. This is why we need to prepare now in order to swiftly and efficiently respond to an outbreak. I have come here today to ask for your support for funding for the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan, which is our portion of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza. This week, we are taking important steps forward. Today, I am releasing the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan, which is a blueprint for pandemic influenza preparation and response. The HHS Plan provides guidance to national, State, and local policy makers and health departments. The goal is for all involved to achieve a state of readiness and quick response. The HHS Plan includes an overview of the threat of pandemic influenza, a description of the relationship of this document to other Federal plans and an outline of key roles and responsibilities during a pandemic. In addition, the HHS Plan specifies needs and opportunities to build robust preparedness for and response to pandemic influenza. The preparations made for a pandemic today will have lasting benefits for the future. A pandemic outbreak will allow very little time to develop new capabilities or build surge capacity for response if these efforts are not already in place. Unfortunately, current capacity for domestic manufacture of influenza vaccine and antiviral drugs can meet only a small fraction of the need projected for a pandemic response. If we are to have the capabilities and capacities needed when a pandemic emerges, the investments to bring them about must be made now. That is why the President is requesting additional fiscal year 2006 appropriations for HHS totaling $6.7 billion for the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan. Our goals in seeking this funding are to be able to produce a course of pandemic influenza vaccine for every American within six months of an outbreak; provide enough antiviral drugs and other medical supplies to treat over 25 percent of the U.S. population; and ensure a domestic and international public health capacity to respond to a pandemic influenza outbreak. First, we must establish the domestic vaccine production capacity our Nation will need to protect all Americans within six months of detection of a virus that begins to spread efficiently from human to human. In anticipation of an influenza pandemic, we must stockpile in advance sufficient quantities of pre-pandemic vaccine that is protective against circulating influenza virus strains with pandemic potential in order to be in a position to initiate vaccination of health care workers and front-line workers critical to the pandemic response. These pre-pandemic vaccine stockpiles must be regularly reevaluated and potentially replenished as the pandemic virus threat mutates and changes, and as vaccine potency degrades over time. In addition, as the virus strains evolve and potentially escape protection by the existing vaccines, newer vaccines that better match the current pandemic strain will need to be produced and stockpiled. The Nation must also expand its stocks of antivirals, personal protective equipment (masks, gloves, etc.) and other supplies to help provide a potentially over-burdened healthcare system with the means to treat and care for those who become seriously ill in an influenza pandemic. Second, we must enhance the disease surveillance systems both internationally and domestically and train the personnel needed to reliably detect an outbreak quickly and to accurately determine its lethality and transmissibility. This includes obtaining samples of the virus from infected humans and animals and having laboratory capacity, personnel, and supplies necessary to conduct rapid analysis. Surveillance is our early warning system, and faster detection will enable public health officials to make recommendations about containment protocols, such as limits on travel and the assembly of large groups of people. Faster detection and identification of emerging influenza virus strains facilitate the conversion by industry to mass production of pandemic influenza vaccines. Better State, Federal, and international diagnostic laboratory systems will also allow for increased surge capacity needed to support front-line medical personnel, and effectively guide the use of scarce drugs, vaccines, and other resources. Improved surveillance systems, including near real-time collection of data from hospital emergency departments in major metropolitan areas through BioSense, will allow us to continuously track the spread of the virus and the morbidity/mortality it produces and to evaluate the effectiveness or our intervention strategies. This information will be critical to determining the best uses of limited supplies of pandemic influenza countermeasures. We will also track vaccines and immunizations to ensure that we maximize its equitable use as well as its effectiveness and safety. Third, we must develop in advance domestic and international plans for broad public education efforts that are culturally appropriate and provide critical information in ways that acknowledge different levels of health literacy. These efforts before and during a pandemic will help guide individual actions to prevent and reduce infection and clarify the need for prioritization of scarce vaccines and antivirals and other materials. Our request also includes funding for States and local municipalities to develop and/or update their pandemic influenza response plans and to integrate them with Federal plans. INFLUENZA VACCINE The Administration has been aggressively working to be able to acquire, over a two-year period, enough H5N1 vaccine and antivirals to protect 20 million people should they become infected with the pandemic virus. On July 15, 2005, the Administration submitted an fiscal year 2006 Budget Amendment totaling $150 million to implement our ``20/20'' plan. This strategy was designed to give us considerable experience with commercial-scale manufacturing of this new vaccine, and provide some pre-pandemic vaccine to our stockpile. However, as we are only able to obtain pre-pandemic vaccine during the few months of the year when influenza vaccine manufacturers are not running at full capacity making the seasonal trivalent vaccine, we are severely limited in the quantity of vaccine that we can stockpile. In addition to this limitation, since the submission of this Budget Amendment, we received results of H5N1 vaccine clinical trials funded by NIH. As part of this strategy, the NIH has funded clinical trials of H5N1 influenza vaccine--which provided good news and, at the same time, sobering news. The good news was that the vaccine we developed works--it provides a good immune response that augurs well for protecting people against the H5N1 virus. The sobering news was that to achieve the desired immune response, the vaccine needed to be six times as potent as the seasonal vaccine--90 micrograms of the hemagluttinin component instead of 15 micrograms--and that two doses are needed for the protective immune response. This has further driven home a point of which we were all aware--that the nation's capacity to produce enough 90 microgram doses of pandemic vaccine was woefully inadequate. We need an aggressive strategy to achieve the needed domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible, and to initiate similarly aggressive action to implement other immediate preparedness strategies beyond these critical vaccine needs. This budget request is just such a strategy, building on the July Budget Amendment and responding aggressively to the results of the NIH clinical trials and our growing concern that a pandemic could involve hundreds of communities across the United States and around the world. Of today's $6.7 billion funding request, approximately $4.7 billion would go toward investments in creating pandemic influenza vaccine production capacity and stockpiles that will ensure that enough vaccine will be available to every American in the event of a flu pandemic. To accomplish this, HHS will pursue a multi-faceted strategy to create, as soon as possible, domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity aimed at producing 300 million courses (two doses of vaccine per person) within six months of the onset of an influenza pandemic. With this immediate investment, the increased production capacity and related stockpile expansion will be achieved in phases between 2008 and 2013. The initial component of this strategy is to expand the number of licensed domestic egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturers from the single one that currently exists. This would give the United States the ability to develop a 20 million course (40 million doses) pre-pandemic vaccine stockpile by 2009--without disrupting the production of annual seasonal influenza vaccine. In the event of a pandemic outbreak, or perhaps before, the vaccine stockpile would be used to immunize healthcare workers, front-line responders, vaccine manufacturing personnel, and others critical to the pandemic response. Once this capacity is developed, current egg-based production techniques could then provide about 60 million courses of vaccine within six months of an outbreak, or about 20 percent of our goal of 300 million courses within six months. The ultimate surge capacity goal of 300 million courses of vaccine cannot be achieved from eggbased production alone. Our best hope for creating capacity in the United States for rapidly ramping up vaccine production at any point in time is expansion and acceleration of our investment in cellbased influenza vaccines--and much of our planned investment goes toward this initiative. While promising, success of cell-based influenza vaccine production and licensure is still years off, and not a guarantee. Therefore, our vaccine capacity expansion strategy invests in both cellbased vaccines and the traditional, tried and true egg-based vaccines. Therefore, HHS, in collaboration with the vaccine industry and its academic partners, will invest in the advanced development of cell-based techniques for manufacturing pandemic influenza vaccines. By financing the establishment of new cell-based vaccine manufacturing facilities that could open in 2010, our plan will develop the surge capacity needed to provide for the remaining 80 percent (approximately 240 million courses) of the population within six months of a pandemic outbreak. The HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan also acknowledges that existing manufacturing facilities can be directed to this effort and finances the retrofitting of existing domestic manufacturing facilities that would enable them to convert to production of pandemic influenza vaccine production, in an emergency. HHS will establish contingency arrangements with vaccine manufacturers in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration so that, at the onset of an influenza pandemic, they will be able to readily adapt their facilities either to produce influenza vaccines or to provide a critical function, such as fill and finish bulk vaccine produced by other manufacturers. We will also work with industry and academia to support advanced development of dosestretching technologies, such as the use of adjuvants and new vaccine delivery systems. These investments, if successful, will extend the pandemic influenza vaccine supply and allow more Americans to receive pandemic vaccines sooner. We will also invest in research that may have potential to lead to broad-spectrum vaccines to protect against multiple and emerging strains of influenza viruses. This would allow for stockpiling of vaccines that could be useful even as the virus strains evolve and change. However, as we seek to build domestic manufacturing capacity, we also know that the threat of liability exposure is too often a barrier to willingness to participate in the vaccine business. As we recognize the desperate need to create and expand vaccine manufacturing capacity, we have to remove such deterrents to participation by those with the knowledge and experience to accomplish this. It is crucial that those engaged in this work be shielded from unwarranted tort suits. Accordingly, the Administration is proposing limited liability protections for vaccine manufacturers and providers, with an exception to allow suits to proceed against companies who act with willful misconduct. We believe this proposal strikes an appropriate balance of removing the liability risks that dissuade companies from producing pandemic countermeasures, while still retaining appropriate access to court remedies. ANTIVIRALS We also recognize the importance of having available a sufficient supply of stockpiled antiviral drugs to treat and care for infected individuals. For this, we request an investment of $1.4 billion. These funds would help us achieve the national goal of having available 81 million courses of antivirals, which would be sufficient to treat 25 percent of the U.S. population (75 million courses) and a reserve supply (6 million courses) that could be used to contain an initial U.S. outbreak. Funding would also be used to accelerate development of promising new antiviral drug candidates in collaboration with academia and industry, since none of the antivirals today are likely to work perfectly against pandemic influenza. Of the 81 million courses, six million courses will be designated to contain the first isolated domestic outbreaks. Of the 75 million courses that will be used to treat those who are infected with the pandemic virus, HHS would fully fund the procurement of 44 million treatment courses to provide protection to the highest priority groups in the event of an influenza pandemic. We will also work with our State partners to encourage them to acquire antivirals for rapid use for their populations. To help support these States efforts, we would establish contractual arrangements with manufacturers of approved antivirals whereby States may purchase up to 31 million treatment courses and HHS would pay for approximately 25 percent of the costs of these drugs. This arrangement will also ensure a more coordinated inter-governmental approach in the acquisition of antiviral drugs and pre-deployment stockpiles of antivirals around the nation. A guaranteed acquisition of up to 81 million courses of antiviral drugs will enable manufacturers to make significant expansion in its U.S.-based manufacturing capacity--thereby positioning itself to meet future demands much more readily than currently is possible. I have personally been meeting with leaders of relevant vaccine manufacturers to determine how they might participate in preparedness for and response to a pandemic. To facilitate the development of new antivirals, HHS will collaborate with industrial organizations to develop, obtain approval, and establish commercial production of new antivirals that would help protect the citizens of our Nation. DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE, AND RISK COMMUNICATION In addition to the production and stockpiling of vaccines and antivirals, enhancing domestic and international resources to expand surveillance, strengthening public health infrastructure, and effectively communicating with the public about risks of an influenza pandemic are important components of the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan, for which we are requesting $555 million. A critical step in enhancing public health infrastructure and international collaboration will be to implement and refine surveillance and epidemiological response. These investments will help us detect, investigate, and respond to the onset of a potential influenza pandemic anywhere in the world without delay. Because influenza characteristically spreads beyond country boundaries, we have included in our request funding to be used internationally. These funds will follow the evolution of the virus in Asia, detect human cases, and help contain outbreaks, where feasible. With an enhanced domestic and international early warning system, we will be better positioned to mount an immediate emergency response to characterize the outbreak; obtain viral samples for analysis and possible vaccine production; and we will have a greater chance to prevent, contain, and/or retard the spread of infection. The ability to continually analyze data to help predict the further course of the pandemic will help guide the choice and timing of interventions (drugs, vaccine, and public health measures) and will help assess the efficacy of these interventions. Enhancing our public health infrastructure also includes expanding the science base at the Food and Drug Administration, thus allowing for expedited regulatory review of pharmaceutical industry initiatives to develop the necessary new vaccine technologies, as well as speeding the licensure of the facilities and vaccines produced within them. Risk communication is another integral part of an effective public health response plan. We must have in place the capability to employ effective risk communication practices that will guide us in providing the American people with the accurate, timely and credible information they will need to protect themselves and help others during an influenza pandemic. To ensure that our communications efforts resonate with target audiences, we will solicit the public's active participation and involvement in our efforts to develop relevant, easy- to-understand information and materials regarding influenza in general, and pandemic influenza in particular. To help in this effort, we have established a website devoted exclusively to this topic, pandemicflu.gov. Public participation and involvement may include engaging the public in discussions on State and local community preparedness; assisting communities in developing procedures for disseminating information and guidance for all segments of our diverse population; and developing targeted informational tool-kits for distribution to particular stakeholders such as educators, physicians, and employers. STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS Pandemic planning needs to incorporate every department of the Federal government but must also go deeper than that. Every State and local government must have a pandemic plan. Unlike most disasters, a pandemic outbreak can happen in hundreds or thousands of places simultaneously. The Federal government will play an important role, but engaged state and local partners are necessary for our success. Over the coming days, I will be asking the governors, mayors and State and local health and preparedness officials to join me in a concern we all must share--preparing for a pandemic should one happen. Everyone in society has a role. For example, the Federal Government can deliver stockpiles of medication and supplies to a city in the United States in a matter of hours--but it is distribution at the State and local level that defines victory. In a moment of crisis, if we are not able to deliver pills to people over wide areas in short time frames, lives will be lost. We need to create a seamless preparedness network where we are all working together for the benefit of the American people. Of the $555 million for surveillance and public health infrastructure, our Budget request includes $100 million specifically for State and local pandemic preparedness efforts. And, as mentioned previously, we will provide incentives to States to purchase their own stocks of antivirals by allowing them to buy off of HHS-negotiated contracts and subsidizing about 25 percent of the cost. The plan and budget request outlined above will greatly improve our short and long term preparedness posture. We are well-positioned to implement the plan and invest these new resources wisely and effectively only because of the substantial pandemic influenza activities already underway at HHS. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, working with industry, have developed a vaccine that produces an immune response sufficient to provide protection from the H5N1 virus. This bodes well for our ability to develop a vaccine against a pandemic virus that may evolve from the current H5N1 strain. In September, HHS awarded a $100 million contract to manufacture 3.3 million doses of H5N1 vaccine, which at two doses per person would be enough for 1.67 million people. In addition, just last week we announced the award of a $62.5 million contract to produce even more vaccine. We have also initiated contracts to secure an adequate supply of specialized eggs to initiate surge production at any time of year. This is not a new undertaking. I have worked with many of you, and appreciate the Subcommittee's commitment to helping our nation prepare to meet this threat. We are making progress, and with your help will continue to do so. We realize we are asking for significant funding at a time when the Administration and Congress are trying to control spending and reduce the deficit. But we have controls in place at the Department, and within the structure of the funding request to ensure that these funds are used wisely and responsibly. When American lives are at stake, we must take action to protect them. We acknowledge that investing in this plan without perfect knowledge of the future is expensive, and not without risk. However, waiting until a pandemic begins before preparedness is undertaken would be so much more expensive in terms of American lives and economic impact. In our view, waiting is not an option. I look forward to answering your questions, and more importantly, to working closely with you and all members of Congress as we move forward together to protect our citizens. PANDEMIC FLU PREPAREDNESS Senator Specter. Thank you very much, Secretary Leavitt. We'll now proceed with 5 minute rounds of questioning by the Senators. Secretary Leavitt, without seeking to ascribe blame, but looking to preventative measures for the future, we find ourselves caught up in an emergency situation. The President was emphatic that nobody has pandemic flu in the United States yet, and there are good reasons, as Senator Harkin points out, to be alert, but not be panicked. But looking backward--20-20 hindsight is great--when did we first have any indication that this kind of a problem might confront us? The subordinate question--I don't like to ask two questions at the same time, but the subordinate question is, Could we have acted sooner to avoid a situation where we're now, in effect, running for cover? Secretary Leavitt. As I indicated in my opening statement, Mr. Chairman, pandemics have been with us for as long as recorded history, 10 in the last 300 years, 3 in the last 100. Periodically, they happen. The current virus is our concern. Senator Specter. They killed millions of people, so we know how devastating they are. What is the answer to the narrow question: When did we first have some inkling, however slight, that we might be facing this kind of a problem in November 2005? Secretary Leavitt. In 1997, the H5N1 virus first made its appearance. It was in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Government acted in a bold way. They destroyed 1.4 million chickens and began using basic public health techniques to contain the virus. They did so successfully. It did not begin to manifest itself again until 2001, where there were some limited number of cases, and then in 2002-2003. We began to buy anti-viral medications, in December 2003. We bought them again in 2004. The NIH began working on a vaccine. I'll ask Dr. Fauci to give you a brief answer on this, as well, because, in 2004, they were able to isolate the virus by using a sample from a victim in Vietnam. Senator Specter. What did the U.S. Government do in 1997, when this issue first reared its ugly head? Secretary Leavitt. I'm going to ask Dr. Fauci to respond to that. Senator Specter. That was long before your watch, but what was done? Dr. Fauci---- Dr. Fauci. Mr. Chairman, in anticipation of the situation where we are now with regard to the need for a vaccine, the 1997 isolate from the Hong Kong cases that the Secretary mentions was actually used in collaboration with industry to create a seed virus vaccine and test that vaccine in 1999. In fact, the data that we're looking at now is looking at how that vaccine has now covered the virus as it has evolved into the 2003, 2004, and 2005 version. We updated the vaccine in 2004, when it became clear that there was a considerable amount of accelerated activity among birds with infections in Southeast Asia. We took a virus from a Vietnamese patient 1\\1/2\\ years ago, made a vaccine, contracted for a certain number of doses for the clinical trial, and the data that we made public this past summer was related to that vaccine trial that we actually started over 1 year ago in isolating the virus and getting it. So, we started in 1997 and continued it along, and accelerated it as we got into 2004. Senator Specter. The information provided to the subcommittee is that the only United States-based influenza vaccine manufacturing facility is an egg-based facility owned by Aventis Pasteur and located in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania. This came to my attention last year. They had an emergency for $10 million, which is not a huge sum of money. But we had to do handstands to find a way to fund them for $10 million, or they were about to lose their ability to provide what limited facilities we had. I'm interested to know--and I'm going to observe the time limits, because I want everybody else to, and I've only got 16 seconds left, but I would like to have, in writing, the chronology of what was known when and what you told Congress and what we could have done to have avoided being precisely where we are now. [The information follows:] HHS Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Initiatives 1989.--CDC establishes collaborative agreements between the Institute of Virology, Bejing, and CDC's Influenza Branch were implemented in 1989 to establish six surveillance sites in China, considered a geographic focal point for newly emerging epidemic and pandemic variants of influenza. In 1994, a five year contract was awarded to the Institute to ensure the continuation of the program. 1993.--National Vaccine Program Office, in collaboration with CDC, begins review of pandemic preparedness and drafting of national plan. February 1995.--National Vaccine Program Office hosts national stakeholders meeting on pandemic planning. 1995.--CDC initiates a cooperative agreement with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to facilitate and local pandemic preparedness planning. May-December 1997.--CDC assists the Hong Kong Department of Health in the investigation of 18 cases of influenza A (H5N1) in humans, including the initial identification and molecular characterization of avian H5N1 in the index case and 7 subsequent patient isolates. On-going since 1997.--CDC generates sequence information on avian influenza viruses to trace the origin of the H5N1 isolates, design updated primer sets for PCR-based diagnostics and clone genes for vaccine production. August 1997.--CDC conducts outbreak investigations on Avian Influenza (H5N1) infections which occur in both poultry and humans in Hong Kong. This is the first time an avian influenza virus has ever been found to transmit directly from birds to humans. The virus kills six out of 18 people infected. All poultry in Hong Kong are culled (World Health Organization). August 1997.--CDC and FDA publish an update on pandemic preparedness in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. 1997.--CDC develops a rapid and highly specific serologic testing procedure to detect the presence of H5 antibody in humans which was used to analyze over 2,000 serum samples collected from the Hong Kong investigation. This assay was used to determine if person-toperson had occurred and was a key tool in epidemiological studies to evaluate risk factors for H5N1 infection. Results from these studies (1998) determine that exposure to poultry in the retail markets was the primary risk factor for influenza (H5N1) but that human-to-human transmission, although rare, had occurred. September 1997.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) awards a grant to Baylor College of Medicine (Principle Investigator (PI)--Pedro Piedra) to examine whether vaccinating a large percentage of children can protect a community from a possible influenza pandemic. November-December 1997.--CDC develops and distributes over 350 supplemental kits for the identification of influenza A (H5N1) are distributed to domestic and World Health Organization Collaborating Laboratories in response to reported human H5N1 cases in Hong Kong. December 1997.--CDC provides HA genes of 1997 virus to Protein Sciences for production of recombinant HA. 1997.--CDC's Influenza Branch initiates development of H5N1 reassortant viruses as candidate vaccines. Two groups, A and B, of influenza A(H5N1) are differentiated using antigenic properties; this observation proves important for selecting potential vaccine candidate viruses (1998). 1997.--CDC develops and local planning guide, and funds four States and one local health department to critique it. Over the next 4 years 14 s were funded to develop their own plans: CA, CT, FL, IN, KS, MD, MN, NE, NH, NY, NM, NJ, SC, WA. 1998.--CDC begins an active collaboration and provides funding to the Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL) to develop and improve an international influenza database. The Influenza Sequence Database features a web interface and can be accessed at http:// www.flu.lanl.gov. January 1998.--In order to detect the possible importation of influenza A (H5N1) strains into the United States, CDC issues recommendations to s public health officials to establish hospital based surveillance for influenza A (H5N1). Specimens collected as part of this effort are sent to NIH's Vaccine Test and Evaluation Unit for viral isolation. No influenza A (H5N1) infections were identified. 1998.--CDC develops serology testing to screen for antiviral resistance. 1998.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) awards a contract to Protein Sciences Corporation (PI, John Treanor) for the production of a recombinant H5 hemagglutinin vaccine. Within three weeks, the company produces an investigational vaccine which is tested in NIAID-supported clinical trials. January 1998.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) awards the ``Influenza Pandemic Preparedness in Asia'' contract to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (PI, Dr. Robert Webster) to: --Establish an animal influenza surveillance center in Hong Kong. --Determine the molecular basis of transmission of avian flu viruses. --Provide characterized viruses suitable for vaccine development. --Support training of new laboratory personnel in the areas of avian influenza epidemiology and virus diagnostics. --Produce reagents. July 1998.--CDC broadcasts a satellite videoconference on State and local pandemic preparedness. August 1998.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) supported scientists discover that human influenza A viruses employ the enzyme plasmin to help chop hemagglutinin in two. The discovery may explain what amplifies the disease-causing power of influenza A virus and makes the virus uncommonly deadly. August 1998.--CDC seeks to strengthen international laboratory diagnostic capabilities, improve surveillance for influenza, and increase networking among participating countries by offering an international course on the diagnosis of influenza viruses in Panama City, Panama. 1998.--CDC engages in collaborative efforts toward vaccine development by working with scientists at Aviron to produce an attenuated virus that is immunogenic and protects chickens and ferrets from wild-type H5N1 virus challenge. CDC also provides influenza A (H5N1) cDNA to Protein Sciences for the production of recombinant H5 hemagglutinin vaccine, and to Dr. Harriet Robinson at Yerkes Regional Primate Center for the generation of candidate DNA vaccines. December 1998.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) awards a contract to Protein Sciences Corporation (PI, John Treanor) for the production of a recombinant H5 hemagglutinin vaccine. The company produces an investigational vaccine which is tested in NIAID-supported clinical trials. 1998.--CDC develops a mouse model (mammalian model) to investigate the pathogenesis and immunity to influenza A (H5N1) viruses. This model is also found applicable for H9N2 viruses in 1999. January 1999.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) awards a grant to the University of Wisconsin (PI, Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka) to investigate the molecular mechanisms of influenza pandemics. NIAID-supported researchers for the first time succeed in engineering an influenza A virus entirely from cloned genes, a breakthrough that could lead to improved influenza vaccines and new influenza-based gene delivery systems. March 1999.--National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID)-supported researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Wisconsin demonstrate that a new DNA-based vaccine protects mice from experimental challenge with the H5N1 virus. April 1999.--CDC provides technical assistance to the Hong Kong Department of Health and participates in a notable investigation of influenza A (H9N2) in two humans in Hong Kong. Although the threat from this outbreak was determined to be low, it illustrates the need to rapidly assess and monitor novel influenza viruses in both poultry and humans. October 1999.--CDC delivers 2 courses on the diagnosis of influenza viruses in Beijing, China. Fifty-seven participants from 50 Provincial and Municipal Anti-Epidemic Stations throughout China, as well as the Institute of Virology, participated in these courses. 1999.--CDC provides funding to more than 15 Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) sites to improve their ability to culture and subtype influenza viruses and facilitate their participation in the sentinel physician surveillance system. 1999.--CDC develops primer sets for Polymerase Chain Reaction and genetic sequencing for all NA and HA genes of all influenza subtypes. These primers enable characterization of ``untypable'' influenza viruses that are sent to the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza. 1999.--CDC uses molecular techniques to evaluate human influenza A H5N1 virus isolates from China and their relationship to circulating virus in China's bird populations. Analysis indicates that the highly pathogenic influenza A (H5N1) from the 1998 outbreak was a reassortant of avian influenza viruses, and although quite pathogenic in humans, no reassortment between avian and human genes had taken place. 1999.--CDC evaluates the immunogenicity in humans of the recombinant Influenza A H5 HA vaccine produced by Protein Sciences (John Treanor). The highest rate of response was 52 percent. December 1999.--CDC participates in the global Neuraminidase Inhibitors Susceptibility Network (NISN) which is established to address public health and regulatory concerns regarding the potential emergence, and consequences of drug resistance in influenza viruses after licensure of NIs in several countries. The Network includes representative from the World Health Organization (WHO), the four WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza, and scientists from academic and public health institutions in regions of the world where increasing use of these drugs is anticipated. December 1999.--CDC produces supplemental reagents kits for the detection of H9 avian influenza viruses for global distribution and shares with international collaborators on an as needed basis. 2000.--CDC trains staff from the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Hanoi, Vietnam at CDC for 3 months in virology laboratory techniques. May 2000.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID)-supported researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital streamline the use of reverse genetics down to eight plasmids--one for each gene in the virus genomes--making the process simpler and less expensive. June 2000.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) establishes an interagency agreement with CDC and the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of live attenuated influenza A virus vaccine candidates for the prevention and control of pandemic influenza A. June 2000.--A course on the diagnosis and antigenic characterization of influenza viruses is conducted in Buenos Aires, Argentina with support from Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and in cooperation with the CDC. Seventeen participants from six South American countries participate in the course. July, 2000.--CDC broadcasts a second satellite videoconference on State and local pandemic planning. August 2000.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID)'s Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs) conduct a clinical trial to compare the immune responses of healthy adults World Health Organization receive either a full dose or a half dose of flu vaccine. September 2000.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) awards three challenge grants to industry partners for vaccine development: --NIAID awards a grant to Aviron for the production of a live attenuated vaccine for pandemic preparedness and to develop a cell culture-based flu vaccine (PI, Dr. Shengqiant Li). --NIAID awards a grant to Aventis Pasteur for the DNA-based generation of avian influenza virus vaccines (PI, Fred Vogel). The project goal is to use a DNA-based system to rapidly produce influenza vaccine candidates, including those against H5 and/or H7 pandemic influenza, which will be tested in clinical trials by NIAID. --NIAID awards a grant to Novavax (PI, Dr. Louis Potash) to produce several non-egggrown influenza vaccines, with the goal being that the most promising will be prepared for use in clinical trials by NIAID. September 2000.--CDC organizes in collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) a 2 day workshop for States on pandemic preparedness planning which includes a tabletop exercise and expert led discussions on key issues. 2000.--CDC awards funding to 22 State and local health departments through the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) and Emerging Infections Programs (EIP). The funds were provided to (1) culture and subtype influenza viruses, and (2) recruit and retain influenza sentinel physicians. 2000.--CDC works closely with WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, NVPO, NIH, FDA, Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and other groups to develop international, national, and State plans that are necessary to prepare for the next influenza pandemic. Through CSTE, CDC's Influenza Branch provides funding for a pandemic planning meeting in Atlanta for the States. The meeting includes a tabletop exercise as well as discussions on pandemic surveillance, priority groups for vaccination, and the potential role for anti-virals. 2000.--CDC works with WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION and the Chinese Ministry of Health (MOH) on a 5-year (2000-2004) plan of cooperation between the World Health Organization Coordinating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza (WHOCCRRI) at CDC, the WHOCCRRI at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, Japan, and the Chinese MOH to strengthen influenza surveillance in China. Eight provinces begin participating in the program in 2000, and 11 more provinces join the program in 2001. The establishment of active surveillance sites in China provides an opportunity to document the early appearance of influenza shift and drift variants, and immediate isolation of these strains in China's laboratories may provide virus candidates suitable for vaccine production. 2000.--CDC's Influenza Laboratory develops a supplemental kit for the identification of avian influenza A (H6N1). It is known that viruses of this type circulate widely in China and the possibility of their transmission into the human population cannot be excluded. 2001.--CDC establishes a research collaboration on avian influenza with the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Hanoi, Vietnam to better understand the human animal interface. Ongoing since 2001.--CDC pathotypes a wide range of avian H5N1 viruses, to better understand potential to cause disease in humans. March 2001.--CDC and NVPO organize a 2-day pandemic preparedness planning meeting of national experts to identify possibly ways to use antiviral agents during a pandemic. May 2001.--CDC produces a reverse genetics PR8 based reassortant H5N1 vaccine against A/HK/491/97 (HA) and A/HK/486/97 (NA). May 2001.--St. Jude scientists and University of Hong Kong (HKU) collaborators detect the reemergence of H5N1 in live bird markets in Hong Kong. More than one million birds are culled and ``market rest day'' is instituted. Researchers also identify quail as the mixing vessel for the spread of avian influenza viruses from aquatic birds to land-based poultry. Live quail is banned from live-bird markets the following year. May 2001.--CDC provides financial and technical support to World Health Organization (WHO) to conduct an assessment of 111 National Influenza Centers that form the backbone of the WHO influenza surveillance system.Analysis from this assessment helps WHO identify critical gaps and helps the WHO corrdinating Centers in Australia, Japan, the UK and U.S. target scarce resources to provide future support for training and technical assistance to countries with specific needs. June 2001.--Funding is made available through the Association of Public Health Laboratories to CDC to train personnel from State veterinary labs in recognition of the need to increase the interface between the veterinary and human sides of influenza research. July 2001.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) sponsors the Reverse Genetics Workshop, bringing together an international group of researchers in influenza viruses as well as scientists outside of the influenza field with research experience in other human viruses, biosafety, and public policy. The Workshop discussions are centered on using local biosafety committees to examine the research work that will be done at federally funded universities and to make risk assessments and safety recommendations. September 2001.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID)-funded investigators at the University of Wisconsin use reverse genetics to discover that the PB2 gene is key to the virulence of the H5N1 influenza strain. This discovery provides important information that may be useful in understanding the emergence of future viruses that may have pandemic potential. October 2001.--CDC produces H9N2 inactivated whole virus pandemic vaccine candidate to A/ck/HK/G9/99 using conventional reassortant techniques. October-December 2001.--CDC describes an ISCOMs-based parenteral vaccine strategy and a mucosal (intranasal) vaccine strategy that induces strong cross-subtype immunity and protects animals from sublethal H9N2 viruses and/or lethal avian H5N1 viruses. October 2001-2003.--CDC supports a pandemic communications fellow to assist States with assessing and updating their State pandemic plans. 2001.--CDC's Influenza Branch joins the World Health Organization Animal Influenza Network (AIN) in recognition of the importance of a strong interface between human and animal surveillance systems to improve pandemic preparedness. CDC provides course material and technical expertise for a laboratory training course in Harbin, China for Chinese laboratorians involved in animal influenza surveillance. 2001.--CDC's Influenza Branch works with National Vaccine Program Office and several agencies to draft successive versions of the national pandemic preparedness plan. The ``Pandemic Influenza Action Plan'' was approved by the Assistant Secretary for Health in 2001. 2001-2002.--CDC conducts a study in collaboration with Dr. Doan Nguyen of the National Institute for Hygiene and Epidemiology in Vietnam on the prevalence of avian influenza viruses circulating among domestic poultry in Asia and the risk of avian influenza infection among poultry workers. January 2002.--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) awards a grant to the American Registry of Pathology for the complete characterization of the 1918 influenza virus (PI, Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger). February 2002.--CDC produces an Ann Arbor, cold-adapted, live, pandemic vaccine candidate to H9N2 using A/ck/HK/G9/99. March 2002.--CDC reports findings of cohort studies in Hong Kong poultry workers that suggested an increased risk for avian influenza infection from occupational exposure. May 2002.--CDC organizes another national pandemic planning workshop in Atlanta to help States move further along with their pandemic preparedness plans. Over 200 people from the States attend. May 2002.--CDC published first report on the ferret as a model for avian H5N1 virus pathogenesis studies in mammals. The ferret is now recognized by many in the field to be the model of choice for pathogenesis studies and safety testing of candidate vaccines strains derived from highly pathogenic avian viruses. June 2002.--St. Jude scientists and Hong Kong University collaborators detect the second reemergence of highly pathogenic H5N1. More than 20 farms are found to be infected and more than seven different H5N1 genotypes are identified in wild aquatic birds. June 2002.--CDC produces a whole virus H5N2 vaccine candidate with A/Pheasant/NJ/96 using conventional reassortant techniques.
