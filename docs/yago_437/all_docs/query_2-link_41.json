        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO - Robin Wright and her husband, Sean Penn, are calling it quits on their more than decade-long marriage.\n\nPeople magazine reports that Wright filed for divorce from Penn Aug. 12 in Marin County, Calif.\n\nThe magazine says Wright and Penn, who have had a tumultuous relationship, have agreed to share custody of their 16-year-old son, Hopper Jack. Court papers cite \"irreconcilable differences\" for the split.\n\nA representative for Wright did not return an e-mail seeking comment.\n\nThe couple married in April 1996. The Penns have twice before filed for divorce or separation only to dismiss their petition a short time later.\n\nSean Penn won an Oscar for his role in \"Milk\" at the Academy Awards in February but did not thank his wife in his acceptance speech."
