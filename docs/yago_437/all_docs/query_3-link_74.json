        "text": "Sean Penn is definitely feeling bitter about his divorce from Robin Wright. The Oscar-winner and activist has been dedicating himself as a full-time volunteer in the dilapidated nation of Haiti, but is also dealing with some personal issue stateside.\n\nSean, 50, relocated to the impoverished country to aid in relief efforts after the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake ravaged the nation.\n\n\"I had nothing pressing,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter of exiting Tinseltown for a while. \"I got practical issues, like everyone else...I had just got taken for one half of everything I had in the divorce, so it's not like I don't have to work.\"\n\nSean and Robin ended their relationship for good in August 2009, when she filed divorce papers. The couple — who have two children together, son Hopper, 16, and daughter Dylan, 19 — had been together since 1989 and wed in 1996.\n\nOK! GALLERY: SEAN PENN STYLES GUY-LINER, LIPSTICK & EARRINGS ON SET, SERIOUSLY\n\n\"A much more profound change in life for me personally was not being able to raise my son in a whole family through high school,\" Sean said of dealing with his divorce.\n\nCurrently, Sean is leading a camp of 55,000 displaced people in Haiti.\n\n\"When I first came to Haiti, the decision was to go for two weeks,\" he shared. \"There's a great thing Paul Newman said about his long marriage: 'As it turns out, we still love each other.' That’s how I feel: 'As it turns out, I'm still here.' \"\n\nThe actor has always had conflicting beliefs about his A-list status and recognized his sense of distance from Hollywood.\n\n\"Let's face it,\" adds the star. \"I'm a person that feels pretty alienated from the rest of the world and never felt understood by anyone.\"\n\nSo, will he be returning home?\n\n\"There's no end point,\" he said. \"This is where I'll be when I'm not working, for the rest of my life.\""
