        "text": "Here’s something you don’t see every day. A celebrity couple deciding against divorce. Oscar-winning hothead and lefty political activist Sean Penn and his wife, actress Robin Wright Penn, have withdrawn the divorce petition they filed in December.\n\nThis after Penn made the rounds at post-Oscar bashes with Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Petra Nemcova, who is most famous for surviving the 2004 Thailand tsunami by clinging to the top of a palm tree. They were spotted canoodling at Elton John’s AIDS fundraiser together and posed on the red carpet for photos. Nemcova (incidentally?) bears a not dissimilar resemblance to Wright Penn in her Buttercup (“The Princess Bride”) days.\n\nNo word yet on what happened to end that fling, but one can speculate, perhaps, that Penn expects a certain level of intellectual discourse in his relationships. Not that models can’t also be Mensa members! Or maybe it came out that Nemcova is a Republican.\n\nThe divorce proceedings had some zigs and zags. Sean originally filed divorce papers in Marin County December 7. That the petition was dismissed December 18. Wright Penn followed up with the papers on the 21st. That’s the case that was dismissed this week. It came a day after they attended an Eddie Vedder concert at the University of California, Berkeley, where Penn reportedly went on stage to dedicate a song to his wife for her birthday.\n\nThey have two children; daughter Dylan Frances, 17, and son Hopper Jack, 14.Much of Rather lawsuit thrown out\n\nA Manhattan judge on Thursday gutted much of Dan Rather’s $70-million lawsuit against CBS, dismissing the suit’s claims that the network and top executives committed fraud and hurt Rather’s ability to seek new work. Four of the claim’s seven causes of action were dismissed, including those that named Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone and CBS Corp. Chief Executive Leslie Moonves as defendants. Rather claimed the network used him as a scapegoat for a story that claimed President Bush got preferential treatment during his Vietnam-era service with the Texas Air National Guard.\n\nMatrimonial news from all over\n\n• Johnny Depp plans to make his 10-year union with French model-singer Vanessa Paradis official. The couple, who have two kids, Lily-Rose, 8, and Jack, 6, will tie the knot June 14. • Ashlee Simpson, 23, has agreed to marry her baby-to-be’s father, Pete Wentz. He reportedly went to Ashlee’s father, Joe Simpson, to ask for the pregnant singer’s hand before he popped the question to her. • And Michael Bolton and Nicollette Sheridan are edging closer to the altar. “A date has not been set yet. We’re working on a location,” Bolton said.\n\nFamous Tina Fey on famous people"
