        "text": "\"They are both single right now and get along great,\" a source told People. \"Sean has always said that Robin is the love of his life. He regrets many things that happened during their marriage. He really enjoys spending time with her now.\"\n\n“Sean and Robin never stopped loving each other, but it was a flawed relationship,” spilled an insider. “She’s walking a dangerous road.”\n\nIn 2014, Wright described her divorce from Penn as \"devastating\".\n\nAs RadarOnline.com first reported, Wright secured a favorable divorce settlement in her split from Giraudet.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by RadarOnline.com, Wright was awarded her clothing, jewelry, and other personal effects. In addition, she was awarded a home in Santa Monica, a property in New York, a 2017 BMW 340i, all artwork in her possession, and all assets related to her career.\n\nIn addition, the actress walked away with all royalties and residuals owed to her from her acting or producing work, which includes all House of Cards money.\n\nBoth agreed to pay their own legal fees. In his divorce, Penn and George had little to argue over due to an iron-clad prenuptial agreement being signed before they walked down the aisle."
