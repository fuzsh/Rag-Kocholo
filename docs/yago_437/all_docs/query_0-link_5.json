        "text": "Putting the ex in LAX.\n\nSean Penn and Robin Wright who were married from 1996 to 2010, were photographed together for the first time in years, at Los Angeles International Airport over the weekend.\n\nPenn wore cargo pants, boots and a jacket and carried a backpack for the trip, as Wright was seen behind him carrying her own bag, dressed in head-to-toe black with matching black frames.\n\nThe pair share son Hopper, 29, and daughter Dylan, 31, but haven't been seen together in public since 2017.\n\nThe reunion comes 9 months after the Flag Day actor finalized his divorce from Leila George after two years together, and 4 months after the Forrest Gump star filed for divorce from Cl√©ment Giraudet after four years of marriage.\n\nDocuments obtained by E! News state that Penn and George cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split."
