        "text": "Better with Ben! Robin Wright opened up to Vanity Fair in its April 2015 cover story about how her now-kaput marriage to Sean Penn has made her relationship (and sex life!) better with her current fiancé Ben Foster.\n\n“I was pregnant and ostensibly married at 24,” Wright, 48, told the mag. “You hear people say how they have ‘arrived,’ but it was just always there, waiting to come out. For me, it just took a long time. I’m 48. I’m finally a person. I think I’m finally ready.”\n\nIn 1996, the House of Cards actress wed Penn, and they divorced 14 years later; the A-listers share two grown kids Dylan, 23, and Hopper, 21. “I [changed my name] really for my children because we’d had kids before we married,” Wright shared, “and I thought that we should all have the same name. That’s traditional.”\n\nThe mother of two was cautious about discussing her marriage to Penn, who is now engaged to Charlize Theron. “I’m not in the business of talking about what ‘isn’t,'” she told the mag. “My eyes are set forward and I’ve never been happier. I have too much respect for Sean and our two extraordinary children to sell our past joys and woes for public consumption and fodder.”\n\nWright concluded, however, that she and Penn took away several valuable lessons from their union. “I believe we were together not only to have our beautiful children but to learn how to love,” she mused. “For the next time around, the right way. And then, what I’m looking for in people now is kindness.”\n\nThe Forrest Gump actress, who looks ethereal in a cream gown on the cover shot by legendary fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier, found that “right way” with actor Ben Foster. The stars first met in 2011 on the set of Rampart, and Wright debuted her engagement ring from her 34-year-old love last January.\n\nWhile the two briefly split later that year, they eventually found their ways back to each other in January 2015. At the time, a source told Us Weekly that Foster was “the nicest guy” and that Wright knew she “has a keeper.” Wright echoed similar sentiments to Vanity Fair in her interview.\n\n“I’ve never been happier in my life than I am today,” she revealed, spilling some details on her sexy dynamic with Foster. “Perhaps it’s not ladylike [to say], but I’ve never laughed more, read more, or come more than with Ben. He inspires me to be the best of myself. There’s so much to learn. It’s endless. How great! It took me a long time to grow up. Love is possible as life is possible.”\n\nThe April 2015 issue of Vanity Fair hits stands nationally on Mar. 17."
