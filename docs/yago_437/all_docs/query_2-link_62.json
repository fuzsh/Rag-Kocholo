        "text": "Robin Wright is said to have filed for divorce from her husband Clément Giraudet after four years of marriage.\n\nThe House of Cards star, 56, began dating the 38-year-old Saint Laurent executive in 2017, with the pair first seen together during Paris Fashion Week. They wed in secret a year later in La Roche-sur-le-Buis in Southeastern France.\n\nThroughout their relationship, Robin and Clément kept their romance extremely private and rarely made public appearances together.\n\nRobin is thought to have filed for divorce from Clément last Thursday and listed their date of separation as July 31.\n\nThe Princess Bride actress cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the cause of the separation, according to documents obtained by TMZ.\n\nThe filing also calls for no financial support to go to either spouse following the split. Robin reportedly said \"all assets are his/her separate property,\" based on the now-estranged couple’s post-nuptial agreement.\n\nFamed divorce attorney Laura Wasser is representing Robin in the proceedings, according to the report.\n\nThe Mirror has contacted Robin's representatives for comment.\n\nDuring their wedding, Robin and Clément were surrounded \"by their nearest and dearest\", with the Forrest Gump alum reportedly wearing a bohemian lace wedding dress for the occasion, according to Vogue Paris.\n\nRobin, who is well-known for her role as Claire Underwood in Netflix's House of Cards, was engaged to actor Ben Foster before she met Clément.\n\nBen and Robin started dating in 2012 but called time on their romance in late 2014.\n\nRobin was also previously married to Madonna's ex Sean Penn and the pair share two children together - daughter Dylan Penn and son Hopper Penn.\n\nSean and Robin tied the knot in 1996 and has planned on divorcing in December 2007, but called it off four months later.\n\nThey separated again in April 2009 and finalised their divorce in July 2010, more than 20 years after they started dating.\n\nRobin married her first husband, the late Dane Witherspoon, back in 1986 after meeting him on the set of the NBC soap opera Santa Barbara. In the show, Dane played Robin's childhood sweetheart.\n\nDo you have a story to sell? Get in touch with us at webcelebs@mirror.co.uk or call us direct at 0207 293 3033."
