        "text": "Are Robin Wright and Sean Penn in the midst of a romantic reunion? Netizens can't help but wonder the status of their relationship after they were spotted together.\n\nThe former couple, both of whom are now seemingly single, were seen together for the first time in years.\n\nThey were spotted at Los Angeles International Airport over the weekend, either having just landed or ready to take flight as they walked up an escalator with bags and luggage in hand.\n\nWATCH: Robin Wright shares a snippet from her stint as a director on Ozark\n\nMORE: Kelly Ripa's son is unrecognizable in new photo shared ahead of long-awaited change\n\nWhen did Sean Penn and Robin Wright start dating\n\nThe two began dating over thirty years ago, in 1989, shortly after Sean's highly-publicized divorce from Madonna – the actor and the singer were married for four years – and were in an on-and-off relationship until their wedding in 1996.\n\nDo Sean Penn and Robin Wright have children\n\nDuring the span of their marriage they welcomed two children – their daughter Dylan, who is 31, and a son, Hopper, who is 29.\n\nMORE: Charles Spencer shares touching family photo amid release of Spare\n\nWhen did Sean Penn and Robin Wright divorce\n\nThe two divorced in 2010, and Robin, who had previously changed her name to Robin Penn before changing it back to her maiden name after their split, previously opened up about the dissolution of her marriage in a 2014 interview with the Telegraph. She said: \"Divorce in and of itself, and with children, is devastating.\"\n\nThe couple married seven years after they first met\n\nThe actress added: \"One of the reasons why we got back together and broke up so much was trying to keep the family together. If you've got kids, it's a family, and you try again, and you try again.\"\n\nMORE: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck celebrate huge news months after Las Vegas marriage\n\nMORE: Tim McGraw shares peek inside luxury kitchen in sprawling Nashville home\n\nShortly after their divorce, Sean told Vanity Fair that his ex-wife was a \"ghost\" to him now, explaining: \"We spent all those years together,\" and that: \"Now she's just gone.\"\n\nThe couple alongside their children at a 2004 basketball game\n\nHowever, that seemed to change in 2017, the last time the two were spotted together, also in an airport, though then it was New York's JFK.\n\nBoth Sean and Robin married again after their divorce, though they have both since split from their respective spouses. The former finalized his divorce from Lila George in April of 2022 after nearly two years together, and the House of Cards lead filed for divorce from Clément Giraudet in September of 2022 after four years together.\n\nRead more HELLO!
