        "text": "SINCE House of Cards went off the air in 2018, Robin Wright has been busy behind the cameras directing films of her own while getting married and raising her two kids off-screen.\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning actress is celebrating the upcoming release of her latest film, Land, which she directed herself.\n\nWho is Robin Wright and how old is she?\n\nRobin Gayle Wright was born April 8, 1966, in Dallas, Texas and is an American actress and director.\n\nThe 54-year-old began her career as a model when she was 14 before landing the role of Kelly Capwell in NBC soap opera Santa Barbara.\n\nShe transitioned into film with her appearance as Buttercup in the 1987 cult classic The Princess Bride and landed her first lead role in 1996's Moll Flanders.\n\nIn 1997, she co-starred with her then-husband Sean Penn in She's So Lovely. Her nephew Charlie is also an actor who appeared as Rodrick in The Diary of A Wimpy Kid franchise.\n\nWhat else has Robin appeared in?\n\nRobin gained critical acclaim for her performance as Jenny Curran in 1994's Forrest Gump and she also appeared alongside Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson in thriller film, Unbreakable.\n\nHowever, Robin is best known for her role as Claire Underwood, the ruthless wife of political mastermind Frank in Netflix drama House of Cards, a role she's played since the show's inception in 2013.\n\nShe became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only TV series in 2014. For the show's sixth and final season, Robin was promoted to top billing after Kevin Spacey was hit with a series of sexual harassment allegations.\n\nMore recently, Robin played General Antiope in 2017's Wonder Woman and she also stars as Lt. Joshi in Blade Runner 2049.\n\nWho’s her husband and who are her children with Sean Penn?\n\nIn August 2018, Robin married 34-year-old Saint Laurent's International VIP Relations Manager Clement Giraudet in a secret wedding in the French countryside.\n\nThis is Robin's third husband. She was previously married to actor Dane Witherspoon from 1096 to 1998 but her most famous marriage was to Sean Penn from 1996 to 2010.\n\nThe ex-couple has two children together, Dylan Frances, who was born in 1991, and Hopper Jack, who was born two years later.\n\n27-year-old Dylan is an actress and model and one of her earliest roles was alongside her mum's disgraced former co-star Kevin Spacey in 2016's Elvis & Nixon."
