        "text": "i guess not a happy new year\n\nSource\n\nAfter 11 years of marriage, Sean Penn and wife, Robin Wright Penn, are calling it quits.\n\nThe celebrity couple's union lasted more than a decade, practically a record in the world of short-lived celebrity couplings in Hollywood.\n\nPenn, 47, and Wright, 41, have two children together, Hopper Jack, 14, and Dylan Frances, 16.\n\nThey began dating in the early 1990s after starring opposite one another in \"State of Grace,\" and married in 1996.\n\nThey have worked together in several other films, including \"She's So Lovely\" in 1997 and \"Hurlyburly\" in 1998.\n\nPenn's spokeswoman Mara Buxbaum confirmed news of the divorce to People magazine Friday, but gave no details.\n\nPenn was previously married to Madonna for four years; Wright was married to actor Dane Witherspoon for two years.\n\ni like sean penn a lot, but would never want to be married to him. lol. he seems to have a violent temper.\n\nbut it's always sad when a marriage doesn't work out, especially one with kids. oh well. best of luck to the both of them.\n\ni like sean penn a lot, but would never want to be married to him. lol. he seems to have a violent temper.\n\nLol well, I wouldn't go that far. I think he's just a very intense actor and he has a hard quality about him. He's always creeped me out though, the first movie I saw him in he played a crazy rapist murderer guy. I guess that's not a good first impression of anyone. But then I saw him on Friends and he acted really cute in it so it made me feel a little better about him.\n\nI really liked them as a couple. Weird time to announce the divorce, considering the holidays and the award season is upon us. Sean Penn will be all over the awards circuit soon for his film, Into The Wild."
