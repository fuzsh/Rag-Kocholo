        "text": "One of Hollywood’s most famous on-again, off-again couples has reunited for the first time in years.\n\nExes Sean Penn and Robin Wright were photographed traveling together at LAX over the weekend, less than one year after they both divorced their respective partners.\n\nIn photos obtained exclusively by Page Six, Penn was seen carrying a black backpack while rocking a casual beige tee, cargo pants, a black jacket and winter boots.\n\nThe “Forrest Gump” star walked one step behind him with a black suitcase in hand and a white puffer jacket over her arm.\n\nShe looked chic in a black turtleneck, which she paired with dark wash skinny jeans and brown boots.\n\nThe duo, who haven’t been seen together in public in years, were married from 1996 until 2010.\n\nReps for the former couple didn’t immediately return Page Six’s requests for comment.\n\nThe outing came just four months after Wright, 56, split from her husband, Clément Giraudet. The “House of Cards” alum filed for divorce from the Saint Laurent executive in September after four years of marriage.\n\nShe noted that their date of separation was July 31 and cited “irreconcilable differences” as the cause, according to documents obtained by TMZ at the time.\n\nThe “Princess Bride” star also wrote that “all assets are his/her separate property” as laid out in their post-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe now-estranged couple said “I do” in August 2018 in France, where they hosted a small, bohemian-themed reception.\n\nMeanwhile, Penn finalized his split from Australian actress Leila George, 30, in early 2022 after she filed to divorce him the year prior.\n\nPenn and George, who was 32 years his junior and the daughter of Vincent D’Onofrio, dated for four years before secretly tying the knot in July 2020, with Penn confirming their “COVID wedding” a few days later on “Late Night With Seth Meyers.”\n\nThe “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” star, 62, later spoke out about their failed nuptials, explaining that he was the one who “f–ked up the marriage” because he saw his then-wife only on “a day-to-day basis.”\n\n“We were married technically for one year, but for five years, I was a very neglectful guy,” Penn told Hollywood Authentic in April 2022.\n\n“[I] allowed myself to think that my place in so many other things was so important, and that included my place in being totally depressed and driven to alcohol and Ambien at 11 o’clock in the morning, by watching the news, by watching the Trump era, by watching it and just despairing.”\n\nPenn was previously married to Madonna from 1985 to 1989, and he began dating Wright shortly afterward.\n\nThe “She’s So Lovely” co-stars welcomed their daughter, Dylan, in 1991 and their son, Hopper Jack, in 1993 before she walked down the aisle in 1996.\n\n“Marriage ain’t easy, but it’s great most of the time,” Penn told Entertainment Weekly in 1997. “I love Robin. I’ve always loved her.”\n\nWhile Penn’s career continued to skyrocket, Wright’s stalled as she spent time at home raising their children.\n\n“We were learning as we were going along,” she told Vanity Fair in 2015.\n\n“We agreed as parents that we’d not work at the same time so that one of us was always with the kids. He was making more money than I was at the time, so it was a simple decision: ‘You go work — I’ll stay with the kids.'”\n\nShe added, “I turned down so many films because I wanted to be a mom that … they stopped offering.”\n\nWright first filed for divorce from Penn in 2007, but they reconciled shortly afterward. The pair went through this process a handful of times before finalizing their split in 2010."
