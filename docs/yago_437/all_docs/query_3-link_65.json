        "text": "Robin Wright admits her divorce from Sean Penn was \"devastating.\"\n\nThe 'House of Cards' star, who recently got engaged to her boyfriend of two years, Ben Foster, revealed she and the 'Milk' star tried to save their marriage several times for their children, Dylan, 22, and Hopper, 20, before they finally split for good in 2010.\n\nThe 47-year-old actress told the UK's Sunday Telegraph: \"Divorce in and of itself, and with children, is devastating. Worse than that. One of the reasons why we got back together and broke up so much was trying to keep the family together... and we did that for a long time.\"\n\nRobin, who has her new fianc√©'s initial tattooed on her wrist and admitted she gets Botox, hinted that she and her 53-year-old ex-husband, who recently started dating Charlize Theron, are no longer on speaking terms.\n\nShe said: \"Sean sees the kids. They see him. They see me. We've all got our own lives.\"\n\nSean previously claimed he felt like he had never been loved by his ex-wives, including Madonna, and said his split from Robin was a real eye opener after years of struggling to make sense of their on-again/off-again relationship.\n\nHe said: \"When you get divorced, all the truths that come out, you sit there and you go, 'What the f*** was I doing? What was I doing believing that this person was invested in this way?' Which is a fantastically strong humiliation in the best sense.\""
