        "text": "Robin Wright got pretty candid about her love life in the April issue of Vanity Fair.\n\n“House of Cards’” resident scheming ice queen, who posed for photographer Patrick DeMarchelier on the mag’s bright cover, opened up about her current relationship with actor Ben Foster and the dissolution of her previous marriage to Oscar-winner Sean Penn.\n\n“I’ve never been happier in my life than I am today,” Wright told contributing editor Sam Kashner. She added that she’s “never laughed more, read more” or been so satisfied sexually than she is with Foster. (Though she took a less “ladylike” approach with that last point. Her word, not ours.)\n\n“He inspires me to be the best of myself. There’s so much to learn. It’s endless. How great! It took me a long time to grow up. Love is possible as life is possible,” the 48-year-old said.\n\nWright met the “Lone Survivor” star, 34, on the set of the 2011 film “Rampart” and they confirmed their engagement during an after-party for the 2014 Golden Globes when she took home the accolade for actress in a TV drama series. Rumors said the duo called off their engagement last November, but they put on a united front and quashed those rumors when they walked the red carpet together at the Golden Globes in January.\n\nThe “Princess Bride” alum was previously wed to “The Gunman’s” Penn from 1996 to 2010. They have two adult children together, daughter Dylan Penn, 23, and son Hopper Jack Penn, 21, who are also dabbling in show business.\n\n“I was pregnant and ostensibly married at 24,” the actress added (via E! News) before explaining why for much of her professional career she was known as Robin Wright Penn.\n\n“I [changed my name] really for my children because we’d had kids before we married, and I thought that we should all have the same name,” she said. “That’s traditional.”\n\nPenn and Wright appeared to have an acrimonious split. The “I Am Sam” star, who is currently dating longtime friend Charlize Theron, recently put down his exes in an interview with Esquire U.K. saying that he doesn’t consider his first two unions to Wright and pop icon Madonna real marriages. He said that “the floor was pulled out from under” him in one of them (seemingly the one with Wright.)\n\nThe actor also didn’t comment for Vanity Fair’s profile of his ex-wife, and Wright wouldn’t discuss her ex-husband all that much either.\n\n“I’m not in the business of talking about what ‘isn’t,’” Wright said of her once high-profile union. “My eyes are set forward and I’ve never been happier. I have too much respect for Sean and our two extraordinary children to sell our past joys and woes for public consumption and fodder.”\n\nThe “Forrest Gump” actress added that she believes the point of their marriage was to have their “beautiful children” and to “learn how to love … for the next time around, the right way,” adding that now she looks for “kindness in people.”\n\nWright’s full interview hits newsstands in New York and L.A. on Thursday and will be available nationwide March 17."
