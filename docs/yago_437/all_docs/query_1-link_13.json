Case in point: In its latest issue, Star magazine accuses her of sharing a \"passionate embrace\" with married Oscar winner Sean Penn, a claim the actress, via her reps, dismisses as completely untrue.\n\nThe tab alleges that Portman, 27, and Penn, 48, who both served on the Cannes Film Festival jury last year,Hot Gossip: Natalie Portman Blasts Sean Penn Hookup RumorWonderWall, March 25, 2009\n\nRelated: Kat Giantis, Natalie Portman, Sean Penn\n\nBy Kat Giantis\n\nNatalie Portman has a well-earned reputation for being smart, professional and gracious, but even she can sometimes get caught in the tabloids' line of fire. Case in point: In its latest issue, Star magazine accuses her of sharing a \"passionate embrace\" with married Oscar winner Sean Penn, a claim the actress, via her reps, dismisses as completely untrue.\n\nThe tab alleges that Portman, 27, and Penn, 48, who both served on the Cannes Film Festival jury last year, dined together on March 17 at the bar of the Sunset Tower Hotel and were later spotted \"making out.\"\n\nBut Portman's rep says Star's hanky-panky story is a bunch of hooey, and assures us that the pair's bread-breaking was strictly above-board.\n\n\"We flatly deny the story, other than the fact that she joined Sean and several others briefly during their dinner,\" states the spokesperson. \"The rest of the story is patently untrue.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Post, there were three other people at the table that night, including \"Milk\" screenwriter Dustin Lance Black -- not exactly the makings of a romantic evening.\n\nBesides, word is that Portman left soon after the meal to hit the \"I Love You, Man\" premiere with her pal -- and partner in comedic PSA crime -- Rashida Jones.\n\nMeanwhile, it turns out Penn, who reconciled with wife-of-a-dozen-years Robin Wright Penn a year ago, isn't the only thespian being linked to Portman.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times says that Ryan Gosling has been pitching woo in her direction since they met recently at a Los Angeles nightclub.\n\nThe actor has supposedly been sending an \"intrigued\"\n\nNatalie a steady stream of \"very poetic\" text messages, along with first editions of books he thinks she'd enjoy.\n\n\"Natalie always has been attracted to actors and other men who are intellectuals,\" a mole maintains to the paper, \"and Ryan qualifies.\"\n\nBut don't start swooning over \"The Notebook\" star's seemingly impressive courting skills just yet. A Portman confidant tells us that the two have never even met.\n\nSource:msn.com\n\nNatalie Portman and Sean Penn Still Together\n\nMay 08, 2009\n\nby:\n\nBridget Daly\n\nNews of Sean Penn and Robin Wright Penn’s divorce being finalized just broke last week. And now we’re hearing that Penn is still secretly dating Natalie Portman!\n\nStar Magazine reports that the two have been together ever since March 17th, when they were spotted making out at Sunset Tower Hotel’s Tower Bar.\n\nA source tells the magazine, \"She stimulates him in ways no other person has, mentally or professionally. There's a lot more there with Natalie than any of the other girls Sean's been with.\"\n\nAn insider says that Sean’s affair with Natalie was the last straw in the marriage. The source tells Star, \"She was furious he was messing around with such a young star.”\n\nSo scandalous! We wouldn’t expect that from Natalie, who has always stayed out of the tabloids throughout her career. But we all have skeletons in our closet! What do you think of Sean and Natalie as a couple??\n\nhollywoodscoop.com\n\n\"She stimulates him in ways no other person has..\" CRINGE"
