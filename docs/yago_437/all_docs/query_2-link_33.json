        "text": "AKA Robin Virginia Gayle Wright\n\nBorn: 8-Apr-1966\n\nBirthplace: Dallas, TX\n\nGender: Female\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Actor\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: The Princess Bride\n\nRobin Wright's parents divorced when she was two years old, but it was an amicable split. She was raised by her mother, a Mary Kay cosmetics executive, and spent summers with her father. Wright started modeling at 14, and by 15 she was dating Charlie Sheen. By 16 she was a borderline supermodel, having worked on three continents and appeared on several magazine covers. At 17, she was working in Paris when a short-tempered photographer shouted that her breasts were too small. She soon quit modeling and considered becoming a nurse. Instead she got a role on the long-running soap opera Santa Barbara, where she won Soap Opera Digest's award for Outstanding Heroine in 1988, her last year on the show. When she left, her role was given to a Playboy playmate.\n\nBeyond the world of soap operas, most Americans first saw Wright as Buttercup, The Princess Bride, in 1987. She has worked steadily since, generally choosing artistic roles and avoiding big commercial movies. She turned down Jurassic Park, Batman Forever, The Firm, the sorry remake of Sabrina, and the role of Maid Marian in Kevin Costner's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. After reading the script for Born on the Fourth of July, she told writer-director Oliver Stone exactly why she wasn't interested: \"I think you have a problem with women.\"\n\nShe met Sean Penn on the set of State of Grace in 1989, and they had two children before marrying in 1996. Their son, Hopper Jack, is named for family friends Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson. She has been credited as Robin Wright Penn since their marriage. They have worked together several more times, including The Crossing Guard, Loved, She's So Lovely, Hurlyburly, The Pledge, and The Last Face.\n\nFather: Fred Wright (pharmaceutical executive)\n\nMother: Gayle Wright (Mary Kay cosmetics executive)\n\nBrother: Richard Wright (photographer, b. 1962)\n\nBoyfriend: Charlie Sheen (actor, together 1981)\n\nBoyfriend: Eric Stoltz (actor, together 1980s)\n\nHusband: Dane Witherspoon (actor, b. 27-Dec-1957, m. 1986, div. 1988)\n\nBoyfriend: Jason Patric (actor, together 1989-90)\n\nHusband: Sean Penn (actor, cohabited 1990-96, m. 27-April-1996, div. 22-Jul-2010)\n\nDaughter: Dylan Frances Penn (b. 13-Apr-1991, with Sean Penn)\n\nSon: Hopper Jack Penn (b. 6-Aug-1993, wiith Sean Penn)\n\nBoyfriend: Ben Foster (actor, together 2012-14, broken engagement)\n\nHigh School: William Howard Taft High School, Woodland Hills, CA (1984)\n\nKucinich for President\n\nTELEVISION\n\nHouse of Cards Claire Underwood (2013-)\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nBlade Runner 2049 (3-Oct-2017)\n\nWonder Woman (15-May-2017)\n\nEverest (2-Sep-2015)\n\nA Most Wanted Man (19-Jan-2014)\n\nThe Congress (16-May-2013)\n\nAdore (18-Jan-2013)\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (12-Dec-2011)\n\nRampart (10-Sep-2011) · Linda Fentress\n\nMoneyball (9-Sep-2011) · Sharon\n\nThe Conspirator (11-Sep-2010) · Mary Surratt\n\nI'm Still Here (6-Sep-2010) · Herself\n\nA Christmas Carol (3-Nov-2009) · Belle, etc.\n\nState of Play (17-Apr-2009)\n\nThe Private Lives of Pippa Lee (9-Feb-2009)\n\nNew York, I Love You (5-Feb-2009) · Anna\n\nWhat Just Happened?
