        "text": "Long past their 2010 divorce, Robin Wright and Sean Penn have clearly moved on in their romantic lives as they showed in their individual ways over the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday, the “House of Cards” star married her French boyfriend, Clement Giraudet in a casual, low-key ceremony that was followed by a reception and dancing in the lush countryside of the South of France, People and other outlets reported.\n\nThe festivities for Wright, 52, and Garaudet, a VIP relations manager for the French design house Saint Laurent, were shared in an Instagram photo, posted by Wright’s fan page, and in a video, posted by Wright’s 27-year-daughter Dylan.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BmZny5WjVOp/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=embed_loading_state_control\n\nFor the wedding, Wright wore a long, lacy white Bohemian gown, with a leather headband tied around her short platinum hair, while her younger groom opted for a leather vest and cowboy hat.\n\nMeanwhile, the day before and nearly 8,000 miles away in Oahu, the 57-year-old Penn hit the beach with his 26-year-old girlfriend Leila George. In photos published by the Daily Mail, the “Harvey Milk” and “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” star looked buff in green swim trunks while standing on the beach smoking a cigarette.\n\nBoth he and George, slender in a bandeau-top bikini, took a dip in the water.\n\nGeorge is the daughter of “Law and Order: Criminal Intent” star Vincent D’Onofrio and British actress Greta Scacchi. Similar to Penn, D’Onofrio is 58 and Scacchi is 57. George and Penn have been dating for about two years, starting when she was 24.\n\nGeorge also bears a resemblance to Penn’s daughter Dylan, who, like her mother, is breathtakingly beautiful. Both Dylan Penn and Leila George have long blond hair, and both are following that popular career path for children of celebrities. Both have modeled and identify themselves as actresses.\n\nMore than two decades ago, Wright and Penn were one of Hollywood’s “It” couples. They began dating in 1989, following the end of Penn’s volatile and high-profile marriage to Madonna.\n\nWright and Penn became Dylan’s parents in 1991 and then welcomed son Hopper in 1993. They married in 1996 and made the Marin County town of Ross their home while their children were young. But the marriage remained rocky, according to reports, and they finally divorced in 2010.\n\nWright previously dated actor Ben Foster from 2012 to 2014, while Penn dated fellow Academy Award winner Charlize Theron, starting in 2013. Penn and Theron were briefly engaged before ending their relationship in 2015."
