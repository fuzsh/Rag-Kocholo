        "text": "Yes, they're back on again...\n\nAccording to reports, Penn has withdrawn the motion he filed on April 24, and wants to dismiss the legal separation case.\n\nAn arrogant mistake\n\n\"It was an arrogant mistake,\" Penn told the\n\nNew York Daily News\n\n.\n\nThe soap opera that is this on-again-off-again-on-again couple has more twists than a bag of pretzels, so it's no wonder why we can't keep up with their fair-weather love.\n\nThe couple first announced they were splitting back in December 2007, but Mr. Penn, 47, quickly withdrew his divorce petition. However, three days later, Wright Penn, 43, filed her own paperwork. And to cap it all off, the pair requested that their divorce petition be dismissed on April 28.\n\nCross-eyed with all the kinks in this saga? So are we.\n\nA rep for the actor now says that the papers he filed on Friday, April 24 2009 in Marin County, California, citing \"irreconcilable differences,\" have been \"dismissed and taken out of the system,\" according to\n\nAccess Hollywood\n\n.\n\nPenn had asked the court for joint physical and legal custody of their children, daughter Dylan, 18 and son, Hopper, 15. He also asked the judge to dismiss any claim his wife might have to any spousal support.\n\nWright had 30 days to respond to her husband's last filing for legal separation, but she didn't, says the\n\nNew York Daily News\n\n.\n\nSnitches close to the now lovey-dovey couple say: \"They love each other like crazy but they fight like crazy.\n\n\"They may have gotten into a fight where she said she wanted a divorce and he filed just to beat her to the punch, even though he doesn't want a divorce.\n\n\"That doesn't mean they're suddenly happy and in love. It's anyone's guess where this is going.\"\n\nPenn set tongues wagging that his marriage was on the rocks when he failed to thank his wife during his acceptance speech after winning the Best Actor Oscar for his role in\n\nMilk\n\n.\n\nHowever, he later dismissed he'd purposefully omitted his wife from his speech.\n\n\"She knows... She knows,\" he said.\n\nReps for Wright-Penn, who is a juror at the Cannes Film Festival, have kept schtum.\n\nThis latest about-face comes hot on the heel of rumours that Penn had cozied up to\n\nStar Wars\n\nactress\n\nNatalie Portman\n\n. Tabloid rumours speculated that the two were a hot item and had allegedly been seen smooching in a Hollywood hotel.\n\nPortman denied talk of a romance, and said: \"Sean Penn is a friend and colleague. The reports that we are romantically involved are completely untrue.\n\n\"I normally do not respond to rumors about my private life, however, this repeatedly fabricated story has forced me to do so.\"\n\nPenn and Robin Wright married in 1996. Prior to that union he was married to the mighty\n\nMadonna\n\n, but they divorced after their relationship was marred by constant press intrusion and reports of domestic turmoil.\n\nAs an interesting aside, Madonna once said that she \"wouldn't wish being Mr. Madonna on anyone\". Big words from a diminutive pop diva that's five foot nothing, but has the feral fury of a charging rhinoceros and no doubt the tough hide to boot. Truly, you don't survive in the music industry for as long as she has without embracing your inner-biiatch.\n\nWe digress.\n\nLet's see how long this reconciliation lasts. Hopefully longer than it takes to boil a kettle.\n\nLove, eh.\n\nBlogger Bites Back\n\nTwo ticks, two clicks...\n\nComing soon...the\n\n2009 Web Awards\n\n.
