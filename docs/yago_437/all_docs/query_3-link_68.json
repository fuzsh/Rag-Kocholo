        "text": "The mother-of-two – who married Sean in 1996 - said: \"I hit that crossroads a while ago. The 'I know what I don't want' was flashing in neon lights. I have no regrets. I, we, have two amazing children we raised together.\n\n\"There's no limbo anymore. There's no time. I'm too old for this.\"\n\nRobin also revealed she is looking forward to moving on with her life, especially her film career.\n\nThe 43-year-old star said: \"There's clarity of life now. I think I've always been a follow-the-leader with my career, or maybe waiting for things to happen. Now I'm like, 'I'm OK' - I know the direction, whoever's on board can go with me.\"\n\nIn April, Sean filed for separation from Robyn but a month later asked California's Marin County Superior Court to dismiss the case claiming it was an “arrogant mistake”.\n\nIt was not the first time the couple had announced they were divorcing only to change their minds.\n\nSean Penn, 48, first filed for divorce in December 2007, but his petition was dismissed. Three days later Robin filed her own paperwork.\n\nHowever, in April 2008, they requested to have their divorce petition dismissed as they wanted to give their relationship another chance."
