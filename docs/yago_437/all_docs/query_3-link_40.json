        "text": "Sean Penn's wife has filed for divorce. Can't say i blame her. This guy is a great actor, but a real whack job. She should have stayed with Forrest Gump. Run Jenny Run.\n\nSean Penn and Robin Wright Penn are entering a state of divorce.\n\nThe Hollywood twosome, who fell in love on the set of the 1990 thriller State of Grace and later married, are seeking a divorce after 11 years of marriage, according to People.\n\nPenn's longtime publicist, Mara Buxbaum, did not provide details on the split.\n\nThe 47-year-old actor-director and the 41-year-old Wright began dating about a year after Penn ended his four-year union to Madonna in 1989.\n\nThe couple quickly hit it off and moved in together in 1991. They had two children, 16-year-old Dylan Frances and 14-year-old Hopper Jack, and finally tied the knot in 1996.\n\nPenn raised eyebrows in April when he appeared at a Hollywood police station in the wear hours to comfort Eve following her DUI arrest. Police described Penn as simply \"a friend\" of the rapper-actress and he declined to comment on the visit.\n\nThe actor, who has been making headlines in recent years as an outspoken critic of the Bush administration and the Iraq War, won an Academy Award for his stirring performance as a father whose child is murdered in 2003's Mystic River. He also scored Best Actor Oscar nominations for 1995's Dead Man Walking, 1999's Sweet and Lowdown and 2001's I Am Sam.\n\nAside from Grace, the Dallas-born Wright Penn costarred with her Oscar-winning hubby in 1997's She's So Lovely and 1998's Hurly Burly, and they are reuniting in Barry Levinson's suddenly aptly titled Hollywood satire, What Just Happened?, which will debut at next month's Sundance Film Festival. She has also appeared in two flicks Penn has helmed, 1995's The Crossing Guard and 2001's The Pledge, both starring Jack Nicholson.\n\nThe actress, who was previously married for two years to actor Dane Witherspoon, shot to fame playing the titular royal Buttercup in the 1987 hit The Princess Bride. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in 1994's Forrest Gump.\n\nPenn's most recent directorial effort, Into The Wild, is currently being lauded by various critics groups as the best film of 2007, so far earning two Golden Globe nods and four Screen Actors Guild Award nominations."
