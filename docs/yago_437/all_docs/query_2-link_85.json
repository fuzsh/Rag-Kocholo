        "text": "Robin Wright, or Claire Underwood from House of Cards, recently tied the knot in a French countryside wedding, and wowed us all in an embroidered, bohemian-style ivory gown. But as invested as we were in Wright’s nuptials, we still know reasonably little about the groom, Clément Giraudet.\n\nFor all those wondering, we’ve tracked down everything you need to know about Robin Wright‘s relatively unknown French husband—plenty of which will probably make you swoon.\n\nWho Is Clément Giraudet?\n\nRobin Wright’s new husband is a French VIP public relations manager for Saint Laurent Paris, according to US Weekly.\n\nThe 34-year-old fashion PR businessman is eighteen years younger than 52-year-old Penn.\n\nHow Long Have Robin Wright And Clément Giraudet Been Together?\n\nWe’re unsure as to how long Giraudet and Wright have actually been together, considering Penn’s private life and Giraudet’s relatively low-key career (Penn’s first husband was Oscar-winning actor Sean Penn). However, it’s been estimated the couple have been together for around a year, after they reportedly met at a 2017 Saint Laurent show in Paris.\n\nPage Six also reported the couple were spotted skiing together in California late last year, further fuelling romance rumours after Wright’s split with ex-partner Ben Foster.\n\nWhere Did Robin Wright And Clément Giraudet Get Married?\n\nWright and Giraudet wed in a private ceremony only days ago, in the Southern French rural province of La Roche-sur-le-Buis.\n\nNo official photographs from the event have been released, and the only insight we have into the wedding is from Instagram posts by Wright’s 23-year-old daughter,Dylan Penn.\n\nSince their marriage, the newlywed couple have been photographed honeymooning on the island of Ibiza, Spain.\n\nThe wedding comes after Wright concluded filming the final season of House of Cards."
