        "text": "Robin Wright clarified that she and ex-husband Sean Penn are just friends after they were recently seen together for the first time in years.\n\nWhen asked where the two stood these days during an interview with E! News, Wright said that it was a “gift” to be “friends with the father of your children” because being divorced while having kids is “one of the most difficult things in life.”\n\nThe “House of Cards” alum, 56, added, “When you become estranged and become friends again … we were going to an event for our children. We’re always gonna be a family, whether we’re together or apart, you know, and I think that’s beautiful and I wish that for everybody.”\n\nLast month, the former couple — who were married from 1996 to 2010 — was spotted for the first time since 2017 as they traveled together from LAX.\n\nIn photos obtained by Page Six, Wright sported a black turtleneck, dark-wash skinny jeans and brown boots. She also carried a camo-colored puffer coat over her arm.\n\nThe “Mystic River” star, 62, wore a beige T-shirt, cargo pants, a black jacket and brown winter boots.\n\nThe outing came just four months after Wright filed for divorce from her husband, Clément Giraudet, after four years of marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, Penn finalized his split from Leila George in April 2022 after the Australian actress had filed to divorce him a year earlier.\n\nThe “Dead Man Walking” actor later admitted that he was the reason why his union did not work out with George.\n\n“There’s a woman who I’m so in love with, Leila George, who I only see on a day-to-day basis now, because I f–ked up the marriage,” the “Mystic River” star told Hollywood Authentic last April.\n\n“We were married technically for one year, but for five years, I was a very neglectful guy.”\n\nPenn and Wright share two children together: daughter Dylan, 31, and son Hopper, 29."
