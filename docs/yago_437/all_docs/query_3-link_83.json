        "text": "Sean Penn has been hitched twice before — to Madonna from 1985 – 1989 and actress Robin Wright from 1996 – 2010.\n\nBut in a new interview with ‘Esquire,’ the actor says he’d consider a marriage to girlfriend Charlize Theron to be his first!\n\n“You say I’ve been married twice before, but I’ve been married under circumstances where I was less informed than I am today, so I wouldn’t even consider [it a] third marriage, I’d consider it a first marriage on its own terms if I got married again. I mean, I like the tradition,” he revealed.\n\nSean with Charlize in January 2015.\n\n“To run into somebody now who you care about is a much passionate, deeper, truer and — God! — a much happier feeling. It’s a lot more romantic and a lot more fulfilling to be in a relationship and to think you’re a good person within it,” he added.\n\nSo much for all those years with Madonna and Robin!\n\nRelated Story: Sean Penn’s Famous Friends Help Him Raise $6 Million For Haiti\n\nDespite being divorced from Sean for 26 years, Madonna, 56, allegedly considers her first husband to be the “love of her life,” and has expressed interest in getting back together with the ‘Milk’ actor.\n\nSean with first wife Madonna (left) in 1987 and with second wife Robin (right) in 2008.

He’s never left her heart, and she says she needs to get him back before it’s too late,” a friend of the star told ‘Radar‘ earlier this month.\n\nRecently, Sean reportedly filed paperwork to begin the process of legally adopting Charlize’s 3-year-old son, Jackson."
