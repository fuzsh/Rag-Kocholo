        "text": "Robin Gayle Wright (born April 8, 1966) is an American actress. She is best known for her roles as Jenny Curran in Forrest Gump and as Buttercup in The Princess Bride. She has also been credited as Robin Wright Penn.\n\nWright was born Robin Gayle Wright in Dallas, Texas, the daughter of Gayle (n√©e Gaston), an Independent Executive National Sales Director for Mary Kay cosmetics, and Freddie Gayle Wright, a pharmaceutical executive. She was raised in San Diego, California.\n\nShe was listed as one of twelve \"Promising New Actors of 1986\" in John Willis' Screen World, Vol. 38. . Wright first became famous on television, playing Kelly Capwell on the soap opera Santa Barbara, which earned her three Daytime Emmy nominations. She shot to stardom after her roles as Buttercup in The Princess Bride and Jenny Curran in Forrest Gump, the latter role garnering her Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild nominations for Best Supporting Actress. Wright was offered the role of Maid Marian in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but turned it down because she was pregnant. She had to back out of the role of Abby McDeere in The Firm (1993), with Tom Cruise, upon discovering that she was pregnant with her second child (son Hopper Penn)."
