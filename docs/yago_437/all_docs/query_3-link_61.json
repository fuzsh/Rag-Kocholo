        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Hollywood stars Sean Penn and Robin Wright, who apart from their blockbuster movies have often made news for their on-and-off relationship, were spotted together in public for a second time in less than a week. After being spotted together at the Los Angeles International Airport on January 13, the former couple was seen together again in the city on January 20. Penn and Wright, who share two children together, ended their 14-year-long marriage in 2010.\n\nNotably, both the actors had recently ended their relationships. Penn, 62, formalized his divorce from Leila George in April 2022, and Wright, 56, filed for divorce from Clément Giraudet in September 2022. On January 13, after Penn and Wright were spotted carrying their bags up an escalator at the Los Angeles International Airport several rumors about the two of them getting back together have started surfacing. The rumors have now found more steam after Daily Mail published photos of the couple catching up.\n\nRELATED NEWS\n\nBack on? Sean Penn and Robin Wright spotted together for first time after their divorce 13 years ago\n\nWho is Dylan Penn? Robin Wright spotted with lookalike daughter at Ralph Lauren fashion show\n\nWhen did Sean Penn start dating Robin Wright?\n\nPenn and Wright had been in an on-and-off relationship for almost seven years before finally getting married in 1996. Thye were both married before they started seeing each other. In 1988, Wright split up with her 'Santa Barbara' co-star Dane Witherspoon, whom she had reportedly married in 1986. In 1989, Penn split up with Madonna after four years of marriage. A few months after the much-publicized Penn-Madonna divorce, the 'Dead Man Walking' actor reportedly met Wright at the sets of 'State of Grace' and a romance started brewing between the two.\n\nIn 1991, Penn and Wright welcomed their first child, Dylan, and in 1993, they welcomed their son Hopper. \"I was pregnant and ostensibly married at 24,\" Wright had told Vanity Fair in a 2015 interview. In that same interview, she expressed that she had immense respect for her former husband. \"I have too much respect for Sean and our two extraordinary children to sell our past joys and woes for public consumption and fodder,” she had said.\n\nBreakups, patchups and divorce\n\nDespite Wright adding Penn to her name before officially marrying the actor and a romance that lasted for over 20 years, there were some tumultuous periods in their relationship before they tied the knot in 1996. The couple had a few breaku-ps during this time and during one such period, Penn's year-long romance with singer-songwriter Jewel became a much-talked-about topic. However, in a little over a year, Penn was back with Wright. Finally on April 27, 1996, Penn and Wright tied the knot in a marriage that would last almost a decade-and-a-half.\n\nThe couple experienced their differences even during the time they were married to each other. Ten years into their marriage, the couple sought a divorce in 2007, with Penn and Wright filing papers on separate occasions. As per People, both of their petitions listed “irreconcilable differences” as the reason and asked for joint legal and physical custody of their two children, who were 14 and 16 at that time. However, the couple decided to change their decision."
