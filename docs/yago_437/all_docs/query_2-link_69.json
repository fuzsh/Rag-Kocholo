        "text": "Who is Robin Wright's husband? Good wishes are in order for actress Robin Wright! Everyone's favorite pixie-cut wearing actress is in the news once more, and thankfully for something unrelated to her former co-star Kevin Spacey's antics. The actress has tied the knot for the third time in a super-secret ceremony in the French countryside. How swoon-worthy is that?\n\nHer new husband, Clement Giraudet, is a total dreamboat but because he isn't a Hollywood heavy-hitter like Robin's other well-known beaus, he might not be someone you know really anything about. After doing our homework, we can proudly attest that Giraudet and Wright are a match made in heaven.\n\nHas Princess Buttercup finally found her Dread Pirate Roberts for keeps? Mais non! But she has done one better: she's found a hunky, French, business professional with a passion for sports and animals and married him on the D.L. Here's everything you need to know about Clement Giraudet and his courtship with Robin Wright\n\n1. Who is her husband?\n\nRumors are circulating that actress Robin Wright tied the knot with Clement Giraudet in a secret ceremony last weekend. Yes that's right, people still do that, making sure that the world remains one where romance lives and thrives.\n\nWhile Clement isn't a celebrity himself, he's no stranger to dealing with the rich and the famous.\n\nClement is Saint Laurent’s International VIP Relations Manager, which means, while he isn't in the Hollywood game, he's not exactly new to engaging with people who are wealthy and well-known.\n\nHe's exceptionally well-educated having earned his master’s degree at Emlyon Business School in 2009 and getting his MBA in 2010 from EDC Paris Business School.\n\nSaint Laurent isn't his first foray into fashion, either. Clement has worked for brands like Christian Dior Couture and Balmain since 2009. He also speaks three languages: English, Spanish and French, thus proving that it is not, in fact, possible for a man to be too sexy.\n\nTheir August 11th wedding came after Wright ended a one-year engagement to then-fiance, actor Ben Foster, in August of 2015. Prior to Foster, Robin Wright was married to the actor Sean Penn from 1996 to 2010. Together, they have two children, Dylan, 27 and Hopper, 23. Before she was married to Penn, Robin Wright was married to the late-actor Dane Witherspoon from 1986 to 1988.\n\n2. How did they meet?\n\nRobin Wright is notoriously protective of her private life. That's why after exploding onto the scene with her starring role in The Princess Bride in 1987, Wright opted for smaller, grittier roles, mostly in movies that she considered passion projects.\n\nWhile her starring role in Netflix's House of Cards put her smack dab in the limelight once more, she wasn't about to let that mean easy access to her love life for reporters or fans.\n\nNo one knew about Robin's new fellow until the 2017 Cannes Film festival in May when they appeared on the red carpet together. The couple was then spotted at a soccer game during Paris fashion week in September 2017.\n\n3. What does he do for fun?\n\nIt isn't hard to see what it was about Clement that won over Robin. His Instagram (now tragically private) was a great showcase for his cut figure and his dozens of tribal tattoos.\n\nHe's a passionate movie fan, listing Quentin Tarantino as one of his favorite directors on his LinkedIn profile. But his passions aren't limited to couch-potato antics, either — he's a real outdoorsman who loves surfing, snowboarding, and mountain biking.\n\nClement lives and works in Los Angeles, but travels often to Paris where he owns an apartment. When he's in the city, there's just one way of getting around: skateboarding!\n\nJust when you think there couldn't be anything else about him to love, the dude also volunteered in South Africa working with sick and injured lions! WE CANNOT HANDLE THE HOTNESS OF THIS FACT. I mean come on, he cuddles up with wounded big cats!\n\n4. Where did they tie the knot?\n\nThe couple did not publicly reveal the date or location of their wedding, but in this the age of the internet, it wasn't all that hard to deduce.\n\nRobin's daughter Dylan shared a video of what is believed to be the reception on Instagram. The bride is rumored to have worn a bohemian style dress and head-piece.\n\nThe small ceremony took place at the La Roche-sur-le-Buis, a commune in the Drôme department in southeastern France — at least, that's the location that Dylan tagged in the video she shared of the chill affair.\n\nThe couple was first spotted wearing matching rings back in November, leading to speculation that they had already tied the knot! It seems, with this newest wedding news, that it's more likely that they got engaged and both got a piece of jewelry to show for it."
