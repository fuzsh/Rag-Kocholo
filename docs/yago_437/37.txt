SAN FRANCISCO - Robin Wright and her husband, Sean Penn, are calling it quits on their more than decade-long marriage.

People magazine reports that Wright filed for divorce from Penn Aug. 12 in Marin County, Calif.

The magazine says Wright and Penn, who have had a tumultuous relationship, have agreed to share custody of their 16-year-old son, Hopper Jack. Court papers cite "irreconcilable differences" for the split.

A representative for Wright did not return an e-mail seeking comment.

The couple married in April 1996. The Penns have twice before filed for divorce or separation only to dismiss their petition a short time later.

Sean Penn won an Oscar for his role in "Milk" at the Academy Awards in February but did not thank his wife in his acceptance speech.
