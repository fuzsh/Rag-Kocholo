NEW YORK â€” Sean Penn and Robin Wright Penn apparently tried to make it work, but now it seems their marriage might be over for good. The two are separating after 13 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences.

The double Oscar winner filed the petition April 23 in Marin County Superior Court in San Rafael, Calif., according to court papers.

The couple married in April 1996. Sean Penn has requested joint legal and physical custody of their daughter, 18, and son, 15.
