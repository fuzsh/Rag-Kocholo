Following Saturdayâ€™s defeat at Stourbridge and a run of results that has seen Tamworth fall into a relegation battle, Gary Smith has left his position as manager of the Pitching In Southern League Premier Division Central club by mutual consent.

He lost his joint-manager Andrew Danalyszyn towards the end of December, leaving himself and director of football Tom Baillie in charge.

Smith is a Tamworth `legend`, having played for the club with distinction from 1995 to 2001, representing the club over 200 times.

He previously turned out for Paget Rangers, Sutton Coldfield Town and Worcester City.

Following the arrival of Gary Mills, Smith left the club at the end of the 2000/01 season, and went on to play for Halesowen Town, Gresley Rovers, Evesham United and Grosvenor Park.

Smith is highly recognisable as the first Tamworth player ever to play international football during his time with the club turning out for St Kitts & Nevis in 2000.

He embarked on a coaching career following the end of his playing days, managing Continental Star, as well as the Coleshill Town`s under-21 team, and moved to Tamworth as under-21 manager in June 2018.

Following the dismissal of Dennis Greene, Smith along with Danylyszyn were given the manager`s job on a temporary basis in January 2019 and following on from a very impressive run up to the end of the season, the pair were given the job on a more permanent basis for the 2019/20 season.

A good start to the 2020/21 season was also cut short due to Covid, but, sadly things have not gone as well this season.
